It had two spin-off series: Xena: Warrior Princess, which ran from 1995 to 2001, and the prequel Young Hercules, which ran in 1998 and 1999. This list includes significant characters from all three series.\nMain characters\n, Xena, Hercules and Iolaus]]\n* Hercules (portrayed by Kevin Sorbo as an adult, Ian Bohen as young Hercules in flashbacks, Ryan Gosling as young Hercules in Young Hercules) - The demi-god son of Zeus and Alcmene and strongest man in the world, and arch-rival to his older half brother Ares, the God of War. The champion of man who defeated and reformed the once power-hungry warlord Xena making her see the errors of her ways that set her on her path of redemption\n* Iolaus (portrayed by Michael Hurst as an adult, and Dean O'Gorman as young Iolaus in flashbacks and in Young Hercules) - Hercules' sidekick, best friend, and companion.\n* Xena (portrayed by Lucy Lawless) - Once a power-hungry warlord, she was shown the error of her ways by Hercules and later repented and renounced her old life as an evil warrior. However, as she was about to turn her back on her old life, she came across a group of young girls destined to be sold into slavery, one of which was Gabrielle, who later allied and morally guided Xena in her adventurous journeys. Xena is considered to be a counterpart of Hercules, despite her supposed pure-mortal blood-status. She is considered extremely powerful in the spiritual world, having defeated Alti on many occasions.\n* Gabrielle (portrayed by Renee O'Connor) - One of a number of farm girls who were about to become slaves. She was rescued in Xena's first acts of good and immediately decided to remain with Xena as an ally. Though Xena initially resisted her, Gabrielle pushed her luck and impressed Xena enough to become her sidekick. She is Xena's moral guide, companion, and love interest.\nThe Amazons\nThe Amazons are an all-female tribe who make frequent appearances in the series. They are first depicted as a large nation that spreads throughout the land and then later as a number of tribes scattered throughout the world, segregated by an unknown cataclysm from their distant past. The Amazons trace their creation to the goddess Artemis, and value an all-female society that strives to uphold the same rights and freedoms for women as those of men. Each tribe is headed by a queen, whose position may be either inherited, or passed on as a right of caste to any named successor. A queen's authority may also be openly challenged by another royal Amazon and her title relinquished if she is defeated in single combat.\nAlthough several tribes are known in different countries, Xena deals prominently with the Greek Amazons and the Northern Amazons of Siberia. With her fighting skills and advocacy for women's rights, Xena bears a striking resemblance to the Amazons. But she is careful to emphasize that she is not an Amazon, nor does she deserve the honor of becoming one. She turns down offers to join the tribes, preferring an independent, nomadic lifestyle to the membership of a collective. The series reveals that some of the Amazons do not trust Xena because of atrocities she committed against them in her past, although most respect her abilities as a warrior.\nGabrielle, on the other hand, during her first encounter with the Greek Amazon tribe throws herself over an Amazon named Terreis to protect her from falling arrows. Although Terreis is already dying, she is impressed by Gabrielle's bravery and gives her right of caste. Terreis was the next in line to rule, and by giving Gabrielle the right, Gabrielle becomes an Amazon Princess of the Greek tribe.\nThis chance encounter leads to Gabrielle's acceptance into the Amazons, and with it she carries her title's duties and expectations. Although Gabrielle decides to continue to follow Xena on her adventures, she is occasionally called by her Amazon sisters in times of need or to fulfill her duties as royalty. The tribes also value Xena as an experienced warrior, and occasionally request her assistance.\nAmong the known Amazons are:\n* Amarice (portrayed by Jennifer Sky) - She is an over-zealous young Amazon.

When Gabrielle decides to step down from her role as queen and remain with Xena, Gabrielle gives her Right of Caste to Chilapa to serve as official queen of that tribe.\n* Lilith (portrayed by Susan Brady as an adult, Jodie Rimmer as a teenager) - Jason's first love, and mother of his daughter Seska.\n* Melosa (portrayed by Alison Bruce) - The queen of an Amazon tribe of Greece.
