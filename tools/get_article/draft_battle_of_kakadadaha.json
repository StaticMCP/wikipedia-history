The campaign aimed to reclaim the Jejakbhukti country and the fortress of Kalinjar, which had been lost to the Ghurids in the Siege of Kalinjar (1202 CE). The battle took place at Kakadadaha, (in Lalitpur) where the Chandel forces decisively defeated the Ghurid army. Trailokyavarman killed the Ghurid ruler and successfully restored Chandel rule over the Kalinjar fort and his entire ancestral kingdom.\nBackground\nPrithviraj Chauhan (Prithviraja III) was killed after Second Battle of Tarain against the Ghurids in 1192. After defeating the Chahamanas (Chauhans) and the Gahadavalas, the Ghurid governor of Delhi planned an invasion of Chandel kingdom i.e. Jejakabhukti. A force led by Qutb al-Din Aibak, and accompanied by strong generals such as Iltutmish, besieged the Chandel fort of Kalanjara in 1202.\nTaj-ul-Maasir, written by the Delhi chronicler Hasan Nizami, states that Parmar (Paramardi Varman) initially offered some resistance, but then fled to the safety of the fort. Subsequently, he surrendered before ruler of Delhi, and agreed to be his vassal. He promised to pay a tribute to the Sultan, but died before he could execute this agreement. His dewan Aj Deo (Ajaya-Deva) continued to resist the ruler of Delhi after his death. The dewan was finally forced to surrender as the water reservoirs within the fort dried up during a drought. Taj-ul-Masir further states that after the Sultanate's victory, temples were converted into mosques and 50,000 Hindu men were taken as slaves. Qutb al-Din Aibak appointed Hazabbar-ud-Din Hasan Arnal as the governor of Kalanjara, and also captured Mahoba.\nAfter the fall of Kalinjar, to the Muhammadan invaders, Paramardi Varman's sons, along with the surviving members of the Chandel clan, ministers, and the army, withdrew to Ajaygarh (also known as Jayadurga or Kirttidurga), which had not been occupied by the Ghurids. There, they regrouped their forces.\nBattle\nAround 1202-04 AD, the Chandel forces, led by Trailokyavarman, advanced toward Kalinjar. Both the Chandelas and the Ghurids deliberately selected the battlefield at Kakadadaha for a decisive confrontation.\nThe encounter turned into a fierce battle, in which the Chandelas faced the Ghurid army. The Chandela forces gradually gained the upper hand, and Hazabbar-ud-Din Hasan Arnal, the Ghurid governor of Kalinjar was killed during the fight. The battle ended in a decisive Chandel victory, allowing Trailokyavarman to recapture Kalinjar and Jejakabhukti.\nAftermath\nAfter the victory at Kakadadaha, Trailokyavarman became the king and establish his rule over Jejakabhukti with the support of his elder brother (who was the legal successor of the Chandela throne) and the Chandel clan of Jejakbhukti. During his rule, the kingdom again became prosperous and politically stable, maintaining independence and regional influence until the 14th century. His inscriptions, dated from 1205 to 1241, confirm that his kingdom included areas such as Lalitpur, Chattarpur, Ajaigarh state, Panna state, and Rewah State. In 1211–1212, he conquered Rewah in Baghelkhand and likely the entire Dahala-mandala region (Kalachuri Kingdom) from the Kalachuri ruler Vijayasimha.\nReferences\n:Category:1200s conflicts"
