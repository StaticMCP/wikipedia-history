The commander of the Armenian side was the prince of Vaspurakan, Gurgen Artsruni, and the commander of the Arab side was Bugha al-Sharabi.\nBugha's campaign of Armenia\nIn the middle of the 9th century, a new Armenian uprising broke out against the rule of the Arab Caliphate, which differed from the anti-Arab uprisings of the 8th century in being more organized and achieving results. The national uprising ended with the victory of the Armenians, as a result of which Armenia gained full autonomy.\nCaliph Al-Mutawakkil, aiming to put an end to the autonomous state of Armenia, sent the policeman Abuset there in 849, and after the latter's death, his son Yusuf. In 851, Yusuf arrested the prince of the princes of Armenia, Bagrat Bagratuni, and sent him in chains to the Caliph's residence, while the Arab troops continued their raids in various provinces of Armenia. Led by Bagarat's sons Ashot and Davit, as well as Hovnan Khutetsi, the mountaineers of Sasun went out against the Arabs, attacked Mush, and killed the policeman Yusuf.\n]]\nIn order to suppress the Armenian uprising, the Arab Caliphate sent a large army to Armenia in the spring of 852, known for his cruelty, a Turk by nationality, Bugha. He was ordered to send all the princes of Armenia to the palace in chains and seize their property. Bugha first invaded Taron and arrested the leading princes of the uprising, after which he massacred about 30 000 residents of Khut and Sasun, and took Hovnan Khutetsu and many other rebels prisoner. Then Bugha marched across Khlat to Vaspurakan, aiming to besiege and attack the princes of Artsruni. The ruler of Vaspurakan, Ashot Artsruni, not receiving support from the other Armenian princes, was forced to surrender to Bugha. After all this, the Armenian struggle was led by Ashot's younger brother Gurgen, who was able to unite the forces of 900 warriors from the ministries of Gnuni, Gazrikian, Amatuni, Varajnuni, Ovrovuni, Akeatsi, Vahevuni and Andzevatsi. Having united his forces, Gurgen Artsruni fortified himself in the mountains near the village of Tva (Tov) in the Vorsirank province of the Korchayk province, below which the Blood Lake valley spread.\nBattle\nThose accompanying Gurgen soon notice that the Arab army has already adopted a battle formation, from which it becomes obvious that the Arabs do not intend to negotiate. By summoning the Armenian prince Gurgen to negotiations, the Arabs intended to arrest him and, taking advantage of the panic, defeat the Armenians with a decisive attack. Given the situation, Gurgen Artsruni is forced to also line up his forces in battle formation.\nThe Armenian order of battle was divided into two parts:\n* The command of the left wing was given to Mushegh Artsruni, which probably only had infantry units. Considering that the left wing was weaker, Gurgen took up a position on this wing.\n* The command of the right wing was handed over to Apumkdem Artsrunի, in which the cavalry was concentrated.\nIn the morning, the Armenians attack the Arabs from the heights. This attack continues until late in the evening, after which the Arabs flee the battlefield. After the victory, Gurgen Artsruni organizes a pursuit.\nLiterature\n* Tovma Artsruni, \"History of house of Artsrunis\", 1887, pages 143-148\n* History of Armenian people, volume 2, Yerevan, 1984, pages 355-356\nReferences"
