It was derived from the preceding Glina-Schneckenberg culture and succeeded by the Noua-Sabatinovka culture, and was contemporary with the related Tei culture. The Monteoru Culture is divided into Three main phases. IC, IB, IA and IIA. the IC Phase is further subdivided into IC4, IC3, IC2, and IC1. The Phases IC4-IC2 last approximately 2400-2250bc, and are the earliest manifestations of this Group. In this Phase, Inhumation in Stone Cist graves was Common, a trait shared with the Contemporary Naeni-Schneckengerg, Odaia Turculi and Dambotivsa Muscel Groups, whose closeness to Early Monteoru can be grouped into a broader horizon of Stone Cist Graves, dating 2400-2200bc, succeeding the Glina-Schneckenberg Culture.\nAccording to Anthony (2007), chariotry spread westwards to the Monteoru culture from the Multi-cordoned ware culture.\nGallery\nFile:Età del bronzo, parure da sarata monteoru, xvi-xiv sec. ac..JPG|Gold jewellery, c. 1600-1400 BC\nFile:В музее - заповеднике Аркаим.jpg|Chariot model, Arkaim museum\nGenetics\nAccording to genetic studies, the Monteoru culture had male haplogroups I2a and G2a.
