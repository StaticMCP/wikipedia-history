The color scheme used for the insignia's chevron was olive drab for field use uniforms or one of several colors depending on the corps on dress uniforms. The chevron system used by enlisted men during World War I came into being on July 17, 1902, and was changed to a different system in 1919. Specification 760, which was dated May 31, 1905, contained 45 different enlisted insignia that varied designs and titles by different corps of the Army. General Order Number 169, which was enacted on August 14, 1907, created an even larger variety of enlisted rank insignia. Pay grades similar to the current system were not yet in use by the U.S. Army, and instead, the pay system reflected the job assignment of the soldier rather than their rank. By the end of World War I, the system contained 128 different insignia designs.\nExamples of pre war dress insignia\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| No insignia\n|-\n!

One column of the table does show the service’s organization as of October 30, 1918, despite the date of the report.\nThe complex enlisted organization starting in July 1918 is confirmed by War Department General Order 62, dated June 28, 1918, that states “The rank, pay, and allowances of the enlisted men of the Chemical Warfare Service, National Army, shall be the same as now authorized for the corresponding grades in the Corps of Engineers.”\nInsignia for the service was prescribed by Change No. 3 to Special Regulation 42 on February 19, 1918.  Prior to that engineer insignia was probably used.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! Master Engineer Senior Grade After July 1918\n!

It, along with the insignia for chauffeurs is listed under general application for all branches.  An article in the Army and Navy Register from July 4, 1918\nstates that the rank of motor sergeant had been created under authority granted to the president to reorganize the army as needed during the war.  The article goes on the state that there was a law before congress that would create the rank of motor sergeant in all branches and expand the chauffeur ranks also to all branches.  This law did not pass.\nVarious general orders from the American Expeditionary Force do show chauffeurs in various organizations, but as a rank, only in the Signal Corps.  However the title of motor sergeant is never mentioned.  Nor is it used in army order from the War Department itself.  Assistant chauffeurs are listed on tables of organization as privates with duty as chauffeurs in division trains and various organizations in the Coast Artillery Corps.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|\n|\n|-\n!
