His attendance at the event, which came shortly after Super Typhoon Noru and during a period of record-high inflation, sparked public concern after photos of Marcos, his family, and staff at the event surfaced on social media. Labor group Kilusang Mayo Uno criticized the trip as insensitive, while Bayan Secretary General Renato Reyes questioned why the palace did not announce the visit beforehand as it was classified as an official visit. In response, Marcos stated that the trip aimed to foster business relations, humorously noting that while golf is often cited as a way to \"drum up business\", he believed Formula One could serve the same purpose. The Palace later clarified that Marcos and his family traveled to Singapore on a military jet.\nThe controversy resurfaced when Marcos also attended the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix (albeit announced beforehand), prompting new criticism. The National Network of Agrarian Reform Advocates-Youth (NNARA-Youth), a peasant advocacy group, condemned his presence at the event, with spokesperson Marina Cavan criticizing Marcos for \"enjoying the high life\" while Filipinos struggled with rising prices and oil hikes. NNARA-Youth also pointed to Republic Act 6713, which mandates public officials to live modestly, and questioned the President's priorities, especially as he concurrently served as Secretary of Agriculture then. Similarly, Bayan's Renato Reyes lamented Sky Sports F1's broadcast of Marcos at a Ferrari garage during the 2023 race, contrasting it with the economic hardships faced by Filipino motorists enduring consecutive oil price hikes. Reyes questioned whether the Paddock Club tickets, which can cost up to US$11,000 (around ₱425,000) per person, were purchased for the presidential entourage, while also noting the ₱1.4 billion travel budget requested by Marcos for 2024.\nCritics, particularly opposition lawmakers, have framed these trips as part of a broader effort to rehabilitate the Marcos family's image on the global stage. ACT party-list representative France Castro suggested that by associating with influential figures worldwide, Marcos was attempting to distance himself from the legacy of corruption and human rights violations tied to his father's regime.\nPublic opinion on Marcos' foreign travels has shifted over time. A Social Weather Stations survey from mid-2024 revealed that 51% of respondents saw little to no benefit from these trips, a notable increase from 44% in a similar 2022 survey. Conversely, the percentage of respondents who believed the trips had much or very much benefit declined. Despite this, Malacañang maintains that these trips are crucial for securing investments and advancing the administration's economic agenda. Marcos himself has consistently emphasized the importance of positioning the Philippines as a key investment destination in Asia, citing ₱3.9 trillion in investment pledges secured during his travels by mid-2023. These pledges, according to the government, have the potential to create 175,000 jobs.\nChief Presidential Legal Counsel Juan Ponce Enrile has defended the necessity of these international engagements, explaining that many trips are made at the invitation of host countries. He argued that if Marcos declined these invitations, he could be accused of neglecting the country's interests on the global stage. Enrile highlighted that these trips address vital issues such as national security and economic cooperation.\nData from the Department of Trade and Industry supports the administration's position, reporting ₱4.019 trillion (US$72.178 billion) in investment commitments from 2023. These investments, spanning sectors like manufacturing, renewable energy, and telecommunications, could generate over 200,000 jobs. Several projects are already operational, while others are in various stages of progress.\nBudget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman acknowledged that while the travel budget for 2025 was slightly reduced, she expected the President to still pursue international trips to follow up on those commitments. The Commission on Audit, however, noted a significant increase in the Office of the President's travel expenses, which surged by 996% in 2022.\nFormer Trade Secretary Alfredo E. Pascual reported that by the end of 2023, Marcos' foreign trips had already led to actualized investments worth ₱294 billion (US$5.28 billion), resulting in job creation across various sectors. Economist Michael Ricafort has observed an increase in foreign direct investments since Marcos took office, attributing some of this growth to the investment commitments secured during these trips.\nMultilateral meetings\nMultilateral meetings of the following intergovernmental organizations that the Philippines is a member of (or invited to) are scheduled to take place during Marcos' term in office.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Group !!colspan=\"7\"|Year\n|-\n!2022 !!2023 !!2024 !!2025 !!2026 !!2027 !!2028\n|-\n|APEC || November 16–19, Bangkok || |November 15–17, San Francisco || style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|November 15–16, Lima || October 31 – November 1, Gyeongju  || style=\"background:#3Cb371;\"|TBD, Shenzhen || style=\"background:#3Cb371;\"|TBD, || style=\"background:#3Cb371;\"|TBD,\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| ASEAN(EAS) || rowspan=\"2\"| November 10–13, Phnom Penh ||May 9–11, Labuan Bajo|| rowspan=\"2\"| October 8–11, Vientiane || May 26–27,  Kuala Lumpur || rowspan=\"2\"  || rowspan=\"2\"  || rowspan=\"2\"\n|-\n|September 5–7, Jakarta || October 26–28, Kuala Lumpur\n|-\n|UNCCC || style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|November 6–18, Sharm el-Sheikh || style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|November 30 – December 12, Dubai || style=\"background:#ffa07a;\" |November 11–22, Baku || colspan=\"1\"  || colspan=\"1\"  || colspan=\"1\"  || colspan=\"1\"\n|-\n|UNGA || September 20, New York City || style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|September 21, New York City || style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|September 20, New York City || style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|September 21, New York City || style=\"background:#3Cb371;\"|September, New York City || style=\"background:#3Cb371;\"|September, New York City ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"| Others || rowspan=\"5\"| ASEAN–EU Commemorative SummitDecember 14, Brussels || Coronation of King Charles III and Queen CamillaMay 5–6, London || ASEAN–Australia Special SummitMarch 3–6, Melbourne ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|World Economic ForumJanuary 16–20, Davos || United States–Japan–Philippines SummitApril 10–13, Washington D.C.\n|-\n|Milken Institute Asia SummitSeptember 13, Singapore || Shangri-La DialogueMay 31, Singapore\n|-\n|ASEAN–GCC SummitOctober 20, Riyadh || style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"| Ukraine peace summitJune 15–16, Nidwalden\n|-\n|ASEAN–Japan Friendship and Cooperation Commemorative SummitDecember 16–18, Tokyo\n|-\n!colspan=\"8\"|██ = Did not attend; ██ = Future eventEnvironment Secretary Toni Yulo-Loyzaga attended in the president's place.
