The revolt is divided into two phases: the first phase took place in western and southern Macedonia and the second in Chalkidiki. A combination of military defeats and diplomatic pressure from the United Kingdom and France on the government of King Otto resulted in the withdrawal of Greek rebel bands to independent Greece.\nBackground\nKing Otto of Greece saw the 1853 outbreak of the Crimean War between the Russian and Ottoman Empires as an opportunity to expand Greek territory at the expense of the Ottomans. He therefore incited rebellions in Greek majority areas of the Ottoman Empire, including Thessaly, Epirus and to a lesser extent Macedonia.\nRevolt\nIn southern Macedonia, the chieftains of Mount Olympos and fighters from independent Greece and Thessaly and Magnesia captured the Vale of Tempe and some parts of Pieria. In May 1854, Greek insurgents under Theodoros Ziakas inflicted a serious defeat on the Ottoman army at Karpero. In Western Macedonia, Ziakas united with rebel bands from Kozani, Siatista and Samarina and took control of the western Pindus and attacked the area of Grevena. After failing to unite with other rebel bands he entrenched his troops in the mountain village of Spilaio. The Ottomans mobilized an army of approximately 12,000 soldiers under Abdi Pasha near Spilaio and another force commanded by Mehmet Tagu at Parorio. At the same time the Ottomans unleashed a wave of reprisals against the Greek civilian population and threatened to kill Metropolite Agapios of Grevena. British and French attempted to convince Ziakas to cease hostilities and engage in talks with the Ottomans, but the latter refused. On 28 May, the Greeks repulsed the initial Ottoman offensive at Houn Havral but were forced to accept foreign diplomatic intervention after being overwhelmed by the numerical superiority of the Ottoman army. Under the terms of the armistice of 31 May, the rebel chieftains left for independent Greece in June 1854.\nThe second phase took place in Chalkidiki and it was led by Tsamis Karatasos, former adjutant of King Otto. Karatasos had disembarked in Sithonia in April 1854 with 500 irregulars. On 22 of April he launched attacks at an Ottoman encampment in Ormylia, but he faced a counter-attack by 300 bashi-bazouks and his forces retreated. The Ottomans amassed an army of 3,000 men which left Ormylia and marched on the insurgents. In mid-May he fled to Athos and he gathered some volunteers, but was defeated at 28 May and withdrew to Dafni. He also led an attack on Thessaloniki, in which there also was a brief rebellion.\nAftermath\nAfter a brief capture of Karyes in Mount Athos, whose monks hadn't supported the rebellion, Karatasos and the other Greek rebels had to return to Athens on the French naval ship SS Solon.\nThe consuls of the United Kingdom and France took over the protection of both the combatants and the non-combatants who had supported Karatasos from a possible Ottoman invasion of Mount Athos.\nReferences\nSources\n*\nFurther reading\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171227104912/http://www.imma.edu.gr/macher/hm/hm_main.php?el%2FA3.2.2.1.html The revolutionary movement of 1854], Institute of the Museum of Macedonian Struggle\n* [http://www.ime.gr/chronos/12/gr/1833_1897/foreign_policy/facts/02.html The irredentist rebellions of 1854 in mainland Greece], Foundation of the Hellenic World"
