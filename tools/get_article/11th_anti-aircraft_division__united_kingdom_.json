It defended the West Midlands during The Blitz, including the notorious raid on Coventry, and the subsequent Baedeker Blitz, but only had a short career.\nMobilisation\nThe 11th Anti-Aircraft Division was one of five new divisions created on 1 November 1940 by Anti-Aircraft Command to control the expanding anti-aircraft (AA) defences of the United Kingdom. The division was formed by separating two Territorial Army (TA) brigade areas (34th (South Midland) and 54th) from the 4th AA Division in North West England and adding a Regular Army headquarters from the (1st AA Brigade) that had recently returned from the Dunkirk evacuation.\nThe divisional headquarters (HQ) was at Birmingham and the first General Officer Commanding (GOC), appointed on 14 November 1940, was Major-General Sidney Archibald, who had been Major General, Royal Artillery, of Home Forces and was a former commander of the 34th (South Midland) AA Brigade. The 11th AA Division formed part of II AA Corps.\nThe Blitz\nThe division's fighting units, organised into three AA Brigades, consisted of Heavy (HAA) and Light (LAA) gun regiments and Searchlight (S/L) regiments of the Royal Artillery. The HAA guns were concentrated in the Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) at Birmingham and Coventry, LAA units were distributed to defend Vulnerable Points (VPs) such as factories and airfields, while the S/L detachments were disposed in clusters of three, spaced  apart.\nCoventry Blitz\nAt the time the 11th AA Division was created, the industrial towns of the UK were under regular attack by night, to which the limited AA defences replied as best they could. The West Midlands had already suffered badly, with Birmingham and Coventry receiving heavy raids in August and October. The new division was still being formed when the Luftwaffe launched a series of devastating raids, beginning with the notorious Coventry Blitz on 14/15 November.\nThe Coventry raid was preceded by a dozen pathfinder aircraft of Kampfgeschwader 100 riding an X-Gerät beam to drop flares and incendiary bombs on the target. The huge fires that broke out in the congested city centre then attracted successive 40-strong waves of bombers flying at heights between 12,000 and 20,000 feet to saturate the defences. The AA Defence Commander (AADC) of 95th (Birmingham) HAA Rgt had prepared a series of concentrations to be fired using sound-locators and GL Mk. I gun-laying radar, and 128 concentrations were fired before the bombing severed all lines of communication and the noise drowned out sound-location. Some gun positions were able to fire at S/L beam intersections, glimpsed through the smoke and guessing the range. Although the Coventry guns fired 10 rounds a minute for the whole 10-hour raid, only three aircraft were shot down over the UK that night, and the city centre was gutted.\nThe change in enemy tactics led to HAA guns being moved from London to the West Midlands (for example, the 6th HAA Regt).\nBirmingham Blitz\narea, after heavy bombing on 10 April 1941.]]\nThe Coventry raid was followed by three consecutive nights (19–22 November) of attacks on Birmingham and other Black Country industrial towns including West Bromwich, Dudley and Tipton were all hit. Birmingham was bombed again during December (3, 4, 11) and on 11 March 1941, but the full Birmingham Blitz came in April 1941, with heavy raids on the nights of 9/10 and 10/11 of the month, causing extensive damage and casualties.\nThe Blitz is generally held to have ended on 16 May 1941 with another attack on Birmingham. By now the HAA sites had the advantage of GL Mk I* radar with an elevation finding (E/F or 'Effie') attachment, and several attackers were turned away by accurate fire and their bombs scattered widely, some on nearby Nuneaton. The city was attacked again in July, but the Luftwaffe bombing offensive was effectively over. The West Midlands had been the hardest hit area of the UK after London and Merseyside.\nOrder of Battle 1940–41\nThe division's composition during the Blitz was as follows:\n* 1st AA Brigade – HQ Crewe: responsible for Staffordshire, airfields and VPs; left by May 1941\n** 1st HAA Rgt\n** 106th HAA Rgt\n** 45th LAA Rgt\n** 63rd LAA Rgt – new regiment raised in October 1940\n** 61st (South Lancashire) S/L Rgt\n** 78th S/L Rgt\n** 83rd S/L Rgt – new regiment raised in January 1941 at Crewe\n* 34th (South Midland) AA Brigade – HQ Coventry: responsible for Birmingham and Coventry GDAs\n** 6 HAA Regt – arrived from London 24 November 1940\n** 60th (City of London) HAA Rgt\n** 95th (Birmingham) HAA Rgt\n** 110th HAA Rgt – new regiment raised in October 1940\n** 112th HAA Rgt – new regiment raised in October 1940\n** 22nd LAA Regt\n* 54th AA Brigade – HQ Sutton Coldfield: responsible for S/L provision to West Midlands GDAs\n** 45th (Royal Warwickshire Regiment) S/L Rgt\n** 80th S/L Rgt – new regiment raised in October 1940\n* 10th AA 'Z' Rgt – divisional Z Battery rocket unit formed January 1941\n* 11th AA Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals (RCS) – formed at Birmingham November–December 1940 as duplicate of 4 AA Divisional Signals\n* 11th AA Divisional Royal Army Service Corps (RASC)\n** 254th and 912th Companies\n* 11th AA Divisional Company, Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC)\n* 11th AA Divisional Workshop Company, Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC)\nBy March 1941, the 1st AA Brigade HQ together with the Regular 1st and 6th HAA Rgts had returned to the War Office (WO) Reserve pending deployment overseas, but temporarily remained part of AA Command. By mid-May 1941, the 1st AA Brigade had handed over its units and responsibilities to a new 68th AA Brigade and left AA Command, while the 67th AA Brigade had also been created by splitting the 34th AA Brigade.\nMid-War\nBy October 1941, the availability of S/L control radar was sufficient to allow AA Command's S/L sites to be 'declustered' into single-light sites spaced at  intervals in 'Indicator Belts' in the approaches to the GDAs, and 'Killer Belts' at  spacing to cooperate with the RAF's Night-fighters.\nAlthough the Luftwaffes so-called Baedeker Blitz of 1942 was mainly aimed at unprotected cities, Birmingham was hit on several occasions in June and July that year.\nNewly formed AA units joined the division, the HAA and support units increasingly becoming 'Mixed' units, indicating that women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were fully integrated into them. At the same time, experienced units were posted away to train for service overseas. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for the invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) and the need to transfer AA units to counter the Baedeker raids and the Luftwaffes hit-and-run attacks against South Coast towns.\nOrder of Battle 1941–42\nDuring this period, the division was composed as follows:\n* 34th AA Brigade\n** 6th HAA Rgt – left in September 1941 for overseas service;

The 11th AA Division merged with the 4th AA Division into the 4th AA Group based at Preston and cooperating with No. 9 Group RAF.\nThe 11th AA Divisional Signals was amalgamated back into its parent 4th AA Divisional Signals as the 4th AA Group (Mixed) Signals.\nGeneral Officer Commanding\nThe following officer commanded 11th AA Division:\n* Major-General Sidney Archibald (11 November 1940 – 30 September 1942)\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/index.html Basil Collier, History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series: The Defence of the United Kingdom, London: HM Stationery Office, 1957.]\n* Gen Sir Martin Farndale, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Years of Defeat: Europe and North Africa, 1939–1941, Woolwich: Royal Artillery Institution, 1988/London: Brasseys, 1996, .\n* J.B.M.
