The surviving large mansion house, known as Kingston House (near the village of Broadhempston), is a grade II* listed building, rebuilt in 1743 by John Rowe, after a fire had destroyed the previous structure.

There is however a parish and village named Kingston in South Devon, about 14 miles south-west of Kingston, Staverton, and Thomas Hext \"of Kingston\", the first member of the family recorded in the Heraldic Visitations of Devon, married a member of the Fortescue family of Whympston, Modbury, about 2 1/2 miles north-west of the village of Kingston.\nBarnhouse\nKingston was a seat of the Barnhous (alias Bernhous, Barnhous, etc.) family, first noted by Pole, and began with William Bernhous, who resided there during the reigns of the Kings named Edward I (1272-1307) and Edward II (1307-1327).

It is three stories high besides the attic storey with large arched vaults underneath, and adjoining to it is a large walled alcove garden, etc. with a lawn and avenue in it\".\nThe new house contained a Roman Catholic chapel, which room survives as the first floor east room, with a plasterwork overmantel showing the Flight into Egypt in a pedimented frame decorated with putti, with busts supposedly representing Saints Peter and Paul.\nJohn Rowe became a bankrupt at some time before 1784, by which date the estate had been purchased by Thomas Bradbridge.\nBradbridge\nThomas Bradbridge (d.1815)\nIn 1787, Thomas Bradbridge (d.1815) purchased the estate from the Exeter Bank (which had foreclosed on the previous mortgagee) for £5,500, but it was sold two years after his death. He is memorialised in Staverton Church by his surviving neo-classical monument with an urn. By his will dated 14 September 1805 he founded ''Bradbridge's Gift'', a charitable bequest which directed that immediately after his decease, such sum of money should be invested in the three per cent consols, in the names of his trustees, as would produce, yearly, a sum not less than 32 shillings, to be applied at the discretion of his trustees, during their lives, and afterwards by the major part of the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of Staverton, for the time being, the proprietor of Kingston held the authority to decide any issue on which opinions were evenly split, for the purpose of educating poor children in the parish of Staverton in reading; and he also directed that a tablet, with a proper inscription, to specify his donation, might be engraved on marble, and erected in the Kingston aisle of Staverton church; and when all but one of his trustees should be dead, he directed that the stock so to be purchased should be transferred into the names of two respectable inhabitants of Staverton, jointly with him and to be named by him, and so from time to time for ever; By a codicil to his will, dated 9 April 1815, he increased the sum to be invested in the funds to such sum as would produce an annual income of 40 shillings. The stock arising from this gift is £66 13 shillings 4 pence of three per cent consols, standing in the name of Henry Studdy, esq. and two other trustees, the dividends are received at the bank of Messrs. Beutall, and paid over to Mr. Thomas May, one of the present churchwardens of Staverton, who, as none of the trustees reside in the parish, acts for them, and pays the same for the teaching of five poor children at the schools in the parish, at the rate of 8s. Per annum for each child. A tablet, containing a statement of this gift, was duly erected in Staverton church.\nRendell\nIn 1816, Kingston was acquired by the Rendell family, which lived there for 120 years. In 1937 it was the home of William Rendell, a bachelor, and his two unmarried sisters. After William's death, his sisters sold the estate.\nCorfield\nIn 1985, Michael Corfield, a proprietor of a building materials supply group, with his wife Elizabeth, purchased the house in a dilapidated state and 10 acres of grounds for £150,000. They carried out significant repairs (unblocking 33 windows, removing a staircase and repairing original ceiling roses and cornices, reinstating sweeping steps up to the front door) and let out cottages, outbuildings and bed and breakfast bedrooms in the house. They were featured in an episode of the TV show The Hotel Inspector broadcast in August 2010. In February 2011, they offered the house and 10 acres for sale at an asking price of £3 million\nExternal links\n*www.kingston-estate.co.uk, official website, history of Kingston [http://www.kingston-estate.co.uk/history.php]\nReferences"
