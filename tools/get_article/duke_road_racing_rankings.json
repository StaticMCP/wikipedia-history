It was the idea of Isle of Man-based Peter Duke, son of former World Champion Geoff Duke, who in conjunction with road-racing journalist Leslie Moore, author Mac McDiarmid and archivist Phil Edge, developed a scoring system which would recognise the significance of the individual events. Riders' aggregate performances over a season-long assessment of several road racing events acknowledges the most consistent racer as the ‘championship’ winner. Since Ian Lougher's first-year win in 2002,  all big names of road racing have been considered, such as Adrian Archibald, Richard Britton, Jason Griffiths, Darran Lindsay and, more recently, Manxman Conor Cummins.\nBackground\nThe purpose of the Duke Road Race Rankings is to recognise achievements across the year by those riders who enter not just the ‘major’ meetings, but also the smaller road races. To be considered for the Geoff Duke Trophy, star names need to attend lower-profile events to earn points, helping to ensure strong grids for meetings which would otherwise be overshadowed by the main events – the Isle of Man TT, North West 200 and Ulster Grand Prix. The records show a split between Ryan Farquhar and Ian Lougher, apart from 2007 when Manxman Conor Cummins received the award in only his second full-season on the roads.\nThe Duke Road Race Rankings series features around two dozen meetings every year, including many of the long-established Irish and Isle of Man road races, and has remained largely unaltered since 2002 – apart from cancellations and the addition of extra meetings, such as the Armoy Road Races. The series received coverage in leading publications, such as Motor Cycle News, Road Racing Ireland and Bikesportnews, culminating in an annual presentation gathering.\nResults\nThe results of each year follows.\n2024 season\nThe Duke Road Race Rankings commenced its 21st active season at the Bob Smith Spring Cup Road Races at Oliver's Mount over the weekend of 13 & 14 April.\n2024 Results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Ivan making his debut on the 3.8028 mile Circuit da Guia course had to finish in the top six.\nWilliam Dunlop opened his Duke Rankings account at the second round, the Cookstown 100 taking 13th spot in the table, quickly moving into third after a very wet Tandragee 100, the climbing to second.\nA double race victory and record lap at the 'Race of Legends' at Armoy William was back in second spot and so to Dundrod and the Ulster Grand Prix in mixed conditions a 2nd; 4th; 5th; 6th & 10th was enough to put the Tyco Team rider at the top of the Duke Rankings becoming only the sixth rider to see his name engraved on the coveted Geoff Duke Trophy since the Championship Series started in 2002.\n2015 Results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Yorkshire's James Cowton becomes the 13th winner of the Duke Road Race Rankings series since its inception in 2002 and the first English rider to collect the prestigious award.\nTwenty-two year old James had a stellar season on the roads, his third year racing 'between the hedges' amassing six race victories during the year, at Oliver's Mount, Billown and Dundrod, where he took his first international race win at the Ulster Grand Prix.\nJames' first victory of the year was at the Blackford's Pre-TT Classic races in the Post Classic race where he also set a new lap record, following that with a double at the Barry Sheene Race Festival at his home circuit, Oliver's Mount before taking another double win at the Dundrod 150 Road Races.\nAdd in a further nine second and 13 third places out of the 45 races he finished, only three were out of the top six whilst setting seven fastest laps.\nJames received the coveted Geoff Duke Trophy and replica being only the sixth recipient of the unique award in its 13-year history from Geoff's son Peter Duke, managing director of Duke Marketing, who was instrumental in setting up what is now considered to be an accurate 'barometer' of the most successful riders of the season who are dedicated to ‘between the hedges’ road racing, by including the less well-known national events alongside the world-famous international meetings.\nThe 2014 Duke Road Race Rankings was held over 25 rounds commencing at the Spring National Road Races at the North Yorkshire venue of Oliver's Mount in mid April and concluded mid November at the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix, James was third in the table after the opening round and throughout the season maintained a position in the top six, slotting into second after the Ulster Grand Prix climbing on to the top rung after the Steve Henshaw International Gold Cup Road Races, the penultimate round, the final round at Macau un-affecting the top three positions.\nPeter Duke commented: 'Another thrilling season with 479 point-scoring riders underlines the increasing popularity of real roads racing and I am extremely proud that the Duke Series plays its part in the sport.\n'It's often thought Irish riders dominate road racing, but this years results showcase the talent and enthusiasm for 'closed roads' in the rest of the British Isles. Long may it continue!'\n2014 results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Pos\n! Name\n!
