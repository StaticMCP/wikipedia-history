Boyles, an American writer, sociologist, criminologist, professor, and ethnographer. The book is a “participant ethnography conducted from inside of Ferguson protests,” as the #BlackLivesMatter project accelerated into a global movement.\nOverview\nAndrea S. Boyles, creates an “everyday montage of protests, social ties, and empowerment that coalesced to safeguard Black lives while igniting unprecedented twenty-first century resistance.” While focusing on crime prevention and fraught interactions between Black citizens and the police in the context of preserving Black lives, this book investigates how Black citizens organize to counter “disorder, crime, and police conflict.” Boyles provides an “insider analysis of cities like Ferguson,” where a climate of disregard leaves Black neighborhoods susceptible to conflict, where Black lives appear to be dispensable, and where Black citizens are blamed for their own oppression. You Can’t Stop the Revolution works to remind readers that community empowerment is still attainable in neighborhoods “experiencing police brutality and interpersonal violence.”\nTime-stamping Twenty-First Century Black Resistance\nBoyles introduces a “Ferguson” and “Post-Ferguson” chronology as foregrounding for time-stamping the Ferguson Uprising as a historical turning point and launch for twenty-first century Black Resistance and new directions in social movement. The Ferguson Uprising as watershed for twenty-first century Black resistance in Boyles’ book establishes a landmark for “a collective and culmination of mostly Black individuals and community and grassroots organizations and associations—birthed or revitalized post-Ferguson.”\nFrameworks\nBoyles’ “post-Ferguson framework” allows for understanding the often unanticipated and unaccounted for relationships and present-day forms of organizing, that extend protections of Black lives “from both police brutality and interpersonal neighborhood violence” in the twenty-first century. In essence, Boyles’ “post-Ferguson framework” includes and reorders pervasive discrimination as the embodiment of social and physical disorder. Her theoretical reframing of Black oppression chronologically, conceptually, and reflectively foregrounds persisting institutional effects on Black life and their counter-responses in the age of “Black lives matter.”\nRedefining “Disorder”\nIn a “post-Ferguson” context, Boyles defines “(dis)order as historically structured, differential conditions that through institutional means, directly and indirectly, persistently impede or disrupt Black advancement. These conditions manifest socially and physically, noncriminally or criminally,” provoking counteractions from Black citizens. Boyles’ definition of disorder is historical sequence “turned right side up,” highlighting Black citizens’ experiences, perceptions, and responses as consequence of discriminant dominant actors, agencies, systems, and powers (i.e., the government, the criminal justice system).\nAwards\n* Winner of 2020 Media for a Just Society Award, Evident Change\nReferences\n* Bell, Jeannine (2021) “Book Review: You Can’t Stop the Revolution: Community Disorder and Social Ties in Post-Ferguson America.
