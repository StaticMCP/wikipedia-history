It was written by Brecht in 1943 while in exile in California, and is a sequel to the 1923 novel The Good Soldier Švejk by Jaroslav Hašek.\nBackground\nSchweyk in the Second World War is set in Nazi-occupied Prague and on the Russian Front during World War II. In a summary written for potential composer Kurt Weill, it was written: \"The Good Soldier Schweyk, after surviving the First World War, is still alive. Our story shows his successful efforts to survive the Second as well. The new rulers have even more grandiose and all-embracing plans than the old, which makes it even harder for today's Little Man to remain more or less alive.\" Hanns Eisler, ultimately, became Brecht's chief musical collaborator for the work.\nPlot\nAs Schweyk is forced into war, he manages to survive while overcoming dangerous situations in Gestapo Headquarters, a military prison, and a Voluntary Labor Service. The ending finds Schweyk lost in a snowstorm near Stalingrad. He meets an equally lost and bewildered Hitler, whose path is blocked by snow, frozen corpses, the Soviet Army, and the German people. Finally, Hitler does a grotesque dance and disappears into the snow.\nTV production\nPortuguese TV made an adaptation in 1975\n[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0843305/ IMDB link]'\nStage production\nSchweyk in the Second World War was not staged during the lifetime of its writer Brecht, though it has been staged many times across the world in various languages, including Bengali, since its 1957 premiere in Warsaw.\nThe National Theatre in London staged a major revival directed by Richard Eyre with the same company of actors he had directed in his famous 1982 production of Guys and Dolls.\nRed Theater Chicago staged it in October 2012  starring Kevin Cox.
