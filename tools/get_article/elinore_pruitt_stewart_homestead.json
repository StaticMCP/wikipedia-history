Also known as the Elinore and Clyde Stewart Homestead, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\nIt is significant for representing \"the long overlooked role of women homesteaders in the American West\" and for its association with Elinore Pruitt Stewart's book, Letters of a Woman Homesteader, which was a basis for the 1979 film Heartland. Elinore Pruitt Rupert, the author-to-be, arrived in Wyoming in 1909 and filed for homestead property before marrying Mr. Stewart, whose own homestead filing was close by.\nThe homestead house on the property consists of a c.1898 log cabin and c.1909 additions.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://wyoshpo.wyo.gov/index.php/programs/national-register/wyoming-listings/view-full-list/816-elinore-pruitt-stewart-homestead== National Register] at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office"
