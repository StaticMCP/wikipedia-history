The award recognises significant, long lasting and innovative architecture with usually more than 25 years passed since the completion of construction.\nBackground\nWhen first established the award was known as the 25 Year Award. In 2007 the award name was changed to the '25 Year Award for Enduring Architecture (ACT Chapter)' and later becoming the 'ACT Award for Enduring Architecture' in 2011, in line with the national awards program and other chapter awards. In 2018 the award became a named award after well known Melbourne based architect Roy Grounds (1905—1981), a Canberra Medallion winner and a two time winner of the ACT Chapter 25 Year Award in 1998 and 2001.\nThe inaugural 25 Year Award was given in 1995 to the Dickson Library designed by Enrico Taglietti. This was the first instance of an award for enduring architecture to be presented in Australia by any chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects. The inaugural National, New South Wales, Queensland and Victorian awards for enduring architecture were presented eight years later in 2003. The 25 Year Award followed in the tradition of the American Institute of Architects 25 Year Award first presented in 1969.\nThe average age of the 36 projects winning the award, after completion of construction, is 37.2 years (1995—2025).\nNational Award Winners\nRecipients of this local award are eligible for consideration for the National Award for Enduring Architecture presented later in the same year, as part of the Australian National Architecture Awards.\nTwo winning projects located in the ACT have won the National Award for Enduring Architecture. In 2007 the High Court of Australia Building by Edwards Madigan Torzillo Briggs won the local and national award 27 years after the building was completed in 1980. In 2013 the new Australian Parliament House by Mitchell Giurgola and Thorp also won both awards, 25 years after opening in 1988.\nJury Citations\n2021 Award\nThe Jury for the 2021 Sir Roy Grounds Award was Philip Leeson   (Jury Chair) from Philip Leeson Architects, Ken Charlton   an architectural historian and Rachel Jackson, principal at GML Heritage.\nThe 2021 jury citation described the winning Concrete bus shelters in Canberra as  \"... architectural integrity and enduring quality of the design is evident through its simplicity, functionality, and materiality. The form of the bus shelter is unique, yet it serves the utilitarian function well, and better still, the shelters were designed to be relocated when required.\"\n2022 Award\nThe Enduring Architecture Award Jury for 2022 was composed of jury chair Eric Martin (Eric Martin & Associates), Nicholas Goodwin (SQC Group) and Anna Leeson (GML Heritage). The award was given to Robin Boyd's 1956 Manning Clark House the same year as another Robin Boyd project was awarded the Jack Cheesman Award for Enduring Architecture for the Walkley House in North Adelaide, South Australia.\nThe 2022 jury citation described the Manning Clark House that it \"...remains remarkably intact and embodies many design features which were innovative for its time, but are now accepted as sound design and sustainable features for modern houses\".\n2023 Award\nThe Jury for the 2023 Award consisted of Jury Chair Can Ercan  (Filardo Ercan Architects), Yuri Leong Maish  (May + Russell Architects) and Murray Brown, ACT Chapter Heritage Committee Member.\nThe jury citation summary states that \"The Chancery was opened by then Prime Minister Paul Keating in August 1995 and has since undergone various technological and servicing updates, all integrated seamlessly and considerate of the original design intent. It is a well-maintained building that enhances the integrity of Government House and the significant landscaped grounds on Lake Burley Griffin and is a worthy recipient of the 2023 Sir Roy Grounds Award for Enduring Architecture Award.\"\n2024 Award\nThe awarded project was the suburban shopping centre located in the Canberra suburb of Torrens by architect Dirk Bolt and completed in 1968. The jury citation noted that the roof form is a strong gesture that has created 'a generous sheltered area that invites shoppers to stop and chat.' The jury for the 2024 ACT Awards was composed of John Guida, Craig Tan, Vassiliki Gracik, Sally Farrah and Jessica de Rome (Chair).\nAward recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+
