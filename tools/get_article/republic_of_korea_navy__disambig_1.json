The South Korean navy includes the Republic of Korea Marine Corps, which functions as a branch of the Navy. The ROK Navy has about 80,000 regular personnel including 30,000 Republic of Korea Marines. There are about 262 commissioned ships in the ROK Navy. The naval aviation force consists of about 88 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. The ROK Marine Corps has about 300 tracked vehicles including assault amphibious vehicles.\nThe Republic of Korea Navy was established as the Marine Defense Group on November 11, 1945, after Korea was liberated from the Empire of Japan on August 15, 1945. Since the Korean War, the South Korean navy had concentrated its efforts on building naval forces to counteract hostilities of North Korea. As South Korea's economy grew, the ROK Navy was able to locally build larger and better equipped fleets to deter aggression, to protect the sea lines of communication, and to support the nation's foreign policy. As part of its mission, the ROK Navy has engaged in several peacekeeping operations since the turn of the 21st century. The ROK Navy aims to become a blue-water navy in the 2020s.\nDuties and objectives\n}}\nThe objectives of the ROK Navy as the main force for the national security and prosperity are:\n* To deter war\n* To gain victory at sea\n* To protect national interests\n* To contribute to world peace\nHistory\nOrigins\nKorea has a long history of naval activity. In the late 4th century during the Three Kingdoms period, Goguryeo defeated Baekje, fielding amphibious forces of 40,000 men in the process. In 732, the Balhae navy \"attacked the Shandong peninsula and destroyed the biggest seaport of the Tang Empire in the east – Dengzhou.\" In the 9th century, Commissioner Chang Pogo of Unified Silla established a maritime base called Cheonghaejin on an island to foster trading with China and Japan, and to eradicate pirates.\nIn 1380, naval forces of the Goryeo dynasty defeated 500 invading Japanese pirate vessels by deploying shipboard guns, devised by Ch'oe Mu-sŏn. This is reportedly the first use of shipboard guns in naval history.  In 1389 and 1419, Korean naval forces invaded Tsushima Island to suppress Japanese piracy. In the early years of the Joseon dynasty, the naval force reached its peak of 50,000 personnel, in order to combat the ongoing piracy issue.\nDuring the Japanese invasions of Korea (the Imjin War) in the 16th century, the Korean naval force commanded by Admiral Yi Sun-sin, who later became the head of the navy, cut off the invaders' naval lifeline and defeated the Japanese fleet, reversing the war in favor of Joseon.[http://www.barrystrauss.com/pdfs/yi-mhq.2.pdf \"Korea's Legendary Admiral (PDF Format)\"] . barrystrauss.com.

In 1893, the Joseon court requested the British Consul-General to dispatch a naval officer for organizing a naval school in an attempt to modernize the navy. In September 1893, the navy school was established in Ganghwa Island. Lieutenant William H. Callwell, a retired British naval officer, and John W. Curtis, a gunnery instructor, served as instructors for 160 cadets and sailor recruits. However, the Royal Naval Academy was closed in November 1894, and the Joseon navy was brought to an end in 1895 due to the First Sino-Japanese War and the Gabo Reform. In 1903, the government of the Korean Empire purchased its first modern naval ship, KIS Yangmu. Korean naval tradition was disrupted after Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. During the Japanese occupation of Korea, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) built a considerable naval base – Chinkai Guard District in southern Korea (at present-day Jinhae).\nFounding years and Korean War\nROKS Baekdusan (PC 701), the first warship of the ROK Navy, undergoing refitting at Hawaii in March 1950\nThe Republic of Korea Navy was established as the Marine Defense Group on November 11, 1945.

The Superintendent of the ROK Naval Academy is a vice admiral.\nU.S. naval units in South Korea\nSouth Korea has a joint military partnership with the United States as outlined by the Mutual Defense Treaty signed in October 1953. The ROK Navy has worked closely with the U.S. Navy to promote regional stability.\nHeadquartered at Busan Naval Base, the Commander U.S. Naval Forces Korea (CNFK) is a shore command of the United States Navy that serves as the shore support agency for all U.S. naval activity in South Korea. The U.S. Naval Forces Korea was established in July 1957, with headquarters in Seoul.\nOriginally established as the U.S. Naval Advisory Group Chinhae Detachment, the Commander Fleet Activities Chinhae (CFAC) is a U.S. Navy installation in Jinhae.\nBases\n]]\nThe ROK Navy operates several naval bases in South Korea: Jinhae, Busan, Donghae, Pyeongtaek, Mokpo, Incheon, Pohang, Jeju Island, Baengnyeong Island. Naval air stations are in Pohang, Mokpo, and Jinhae.\nSituated in the southeastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, Jinhae has been the major naval port in Korea since the Imperial Japanese Navy built a naval base during the Japanese occupation period. After Korea was liberated from the Empire of Japan, the Korean Coast Guard (later the ROK Navy) was formed in Jinhae. Jinhae Naval Base is the principal homeport of the Republic of Korea Fleet, and hosts vital naval facilities including the Naval Shipyard. The Jinhae Naval Base Command is responsible for protecting the area.\nLocated in South Korea's second most-populous city after Seoul, Busan Naval Base has become another major naval base for the ROK Fleet since its headquarters moved from Jinhae in 2007. The base can accommodate up to 30 naval ships as big as the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier.\nDonghae, Pyeongtaek, and Mokpo hosts the headquarters of the First, Second and the Third Fleet respectively. Incheon hosts the Incheon Naval Sector Defense Command under a one-star admiral responsible for protecting littoral waters close to Seoul, the nation's capital. Pohang has a naval base for amphibious forces such as the 1st Marine Division (\"Sea Dragon\") located nearby.\nJeju Naval Base\nIn February 2016, the ROK Navy completed a new naval base on the southern coast of South Korea's largest island - Jeju, which lies in the Korea Strait. Jeju Naval Base was established to protect the sea lines of communication and to strengthen the Navy's control over the seas around South Korea. It is home of the Maritime Task Flotilla Seven and the Submarine Squadron 93. The base is also known as Jeju Civilian-Military Complex Port because it was designed to be jointly used by military and civilians; there is a pier and terminal for cruise ships. The base can host up to 20 naval vessels and two 150,000-ton cruise ships at the same time.\nJeju Naval Base was the venue for the international fleet review 2018 in October 2018.\nPersonnel\nThe ROK Navy has about 70,000 personnel, including the 29,000 members of the ROK Marine Corps.\nMilitary service is mandatory for all South Korean men. In the ROK Navy, all members are volunteers, with enlisted seamen serving for 20-month periods; commissioned officers, warrant officers, and petty officers serving longer terms than those of enlisted seamen, or as career. Women can volunteer as officers, warrant officers, or petty officers. In 2001, six female ensigns, who had become commissioned officers through the Officer Candidate School, were assigned to serve on surface ships of the ROK Navy, for the first time.[http://www2.mogaha.go.kr/webapp/bbs/notice/view.action?serial=161024&sc_param=for_frame&listStatusStr=rO0ABXNyABpjb20uZ2VuMTI4LmRhdGEuTGlzdFN0YXR1c7sGCWct5HSSAgAESQAHbWF4U2l6ZUkABm9mZnNldEwACmNvbmRpdGlvbnN0ABNMamF2YS91dGlsL0hhc2hNYXA7TAAEc29ydHQAEkxqYXZhL2xhbmcvU3RyaW5nO3hwAAAADwAAAHhzcgARamF2YS51dGlsLkhhc2hNYXAFB9rBwxZg0QMAAkYACmxvYWRGYWN0b3JJAAl0aHJlc2hvbGR4cD9AAAAAAAAMdwgAAAAQAAAAAHh0AAZzZXJpYWw= \"女해군장교들 첫 함정근무 (신문기사)\"] . Ministry of Government Administration and Home affairs Official Website. Retrieved May 11, 2007.\n* Commissioned officers\nChamsuri-class patrol boats in 2012.|right|thumb]]\nThere are several paths to becoming a commissioned officer in the ROK Navy, including the Naval Academy, Officer Candidate School (OCS), and Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC). Officer Candidate School, located at the Naval Academy, Jinhae, provides training for candidates with current or prior enlisted experience in the military and civilian college graduates, which take majority in OCS.\n* Warrant officers\nThe warrant officer rank in the South Korean armed forces falls in between that of non-commissioned and commissioned officers. In the ROK Navy, warrant officers are mostly former non-commissioned officers who had earned the rating of Sangsa (Chief petty officer) or Wonsa (Master chief petty officer) and who had been selected for and completed the warrant officer candidate program. Other routes include the naval aviation program and Air Intercept Controller (AIC) program; a small number of warrant officers serve as language officers who specialize in English translation and interpretation.\nWarrant officers mess in the wardroom with commissioned officers.\n* Petty officers\nthumb\nPetty officers originate from a petty officer candidate program, which trains military personnel and civilians who take majority - seamen experience is not required to become petty officers. In the ROK Navy, personnel with ranks of Hasa (Petty officer) through Wonsa are considered petty officers (i.e. non-commissioned officers). Those at Sangsa and Wonsa are further referred to as \"CPO\" (chief petty officer) collectively and considered a separate community within the Navy. \"CPO\"s have privileges such as separate dining and living areas.\nThere are the appointments of Juim-wonsa and Juim-sangsa equivalent to that of the U.S. Navy's command master chief petty officer (CMDCM). The positions are filled by senior Wonsa and Sangsa respectively and unlike their U.S. Navy counterparts, the ROK Navy Juim-wonsa and Juim-sangsa wear the same standard rate insignia of Wonsa or Sangsa with an identification badge.\n* Seamen\nthumb\nIn the ROK Navy, seamen are referred to as \"Subyeong\" (; Hanja: 水兵). Normally the enlisted seamen serve in the Navy for 20 months; civilian recruits get initial trainings at the basic military training center in Jinhae as Ideungbyeong (Seaman 2nd class). After completing their military services as Byeongjang (Leading seaman), most of them are transferred from active duty to the naval reserve. Others continue the military service as Hasa (Petty officer) and may become career petty officers.\nUniforms\nROK Navy uniforms were influenced by US Navy uniforms with some notable differences. Petty officers, not just chief petty officers, wear uniforms identical to that of a commissioned officer's uniform except with different insignia, and petty officers wear a combination cap with a white cover and a gold chinstrap. Seamen wear dungaree trousers, chambray shirts and \"dixie cup\" hats as their work uniforms. Honor guards and musicians of the navy bands of seaman rates wear sailor caps bearing \"Republic of Korea Navy\" in Hangul with the dress uniforms.\nA new shipboard working uniform similar to the NWU Type I has been issued since 2021.\nRanks and rates\nIn the ROK Navy, as in the rest of the ROK Armed Forces, ranks fall into one of four categories: commissioned officer, warrant officer, petty officer (non-commissioned officer), and seaman, in decreasing order of authority. Commissioned officer ranks are subdivided into flag officers, senior officers (lieutenant commander through captain), and junior officers (ensign through lieutenant).\nROK Navy commissioned officer ranks have two distinct sets of rank insignia: On dress uniform a series of stripes similar to Commonwealth naval ranks are worn; on service uniforms, working uniforms, and special uniform situations (combat utilities and flight suits), the rank insignia are the same as the equivalent rank in the Army or the Air Force. The warrant officer rank insignia is denoted by a gold-colored Sowi insignia, and a single broken stripe.\nAll three branches&nbsp;– the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force of the ROK Armed Forces share the same rank insignia and the same names of ranks in Korean.\n;Commissioned officer\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#CCCCCC;\"\n!

The naval aviation force consists of about 70 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.\nShips\nThe vessels are categorized into four levels. A first-rate ship (Sohn Wonyil–class SS, DDG, DDH, LPH, MLS, and AOE) is commanded by a captain; a second-rate ship (SS, FFG, FF, PCC, LST, ATS, and ASR) by a commander; a third-rate ship (PKG, MSH, and MHC) by a lieutenant commander; and a fourth-rate craft (PKMR, PKM, and LSF) is commanded by a lieutenant or a warrant officer.\nThe ROK Navy employs the U.S. Navy–style letter based hull classification symbols to designate the types of its ships and hull numbers to uniquely identify its vessels (e.g. DDH 975). The names are that of the historical figures, Navy heroes, provinces, cities, counties, peaks, lakes, islands, and birds. The Chief of Naval Operations selects the names of ships.\nThe ship prefix for all the commissioned ROK Navy ship is ROKS (Republic of Korea Ship) when the names of ships are written in English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Class\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Image\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|ROKN classification\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Displacement(light/full tons)\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|First deployment\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Commissioned\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Launched\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Note\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" | Submarines\n|-\n| Dosan Ahn Changho class\n|\n| SS: Submarine || 3,750 (submerged)\n| 2021|| 3|| - || KSS-III Batch-I; 3 in batch\n|-\n| Sohn Wonyil class\n|\n| SS: Submarine || 1,860 (submerged)\n|2007|| 9|| -\n| SS-II (9 in class); Capable of launching cruise missiles\n|-\n| Chang Bogo class\n|\n| SS: Submarine || 1,290 (submerged)\n|1993|| 9 || -|| SS-I (Being upgraded)\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" | Destroyers\n|-\n| Sejong the Great class\n|\n| DDG: Destroyer Guided-missile || 7,650/10,600\n|2008|| 4  || 1 || 3 more planned as KDX-III Batch-II\n|-\n| Chungmugong Yi Sunshin class\n|\n| DDH: Destroyer Helicopter || 4,500/5,520\n|2003|| 6 || -|| DDH-II; To be followed by KDDX\n|-\n| Kwanggaeto the Great class\n|\n| DDH: Destroyer Helicopter || 3,200/3,900\n|1998|| 3 || - || DDH-I\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" |Frigates\n|-\n| Chungnam class\n|\n| FFG: Frigate Guided-missile || 3,600/4,300\n|2024|| 1 || 1 || FFG-III (FFX Batch-III; 6 in batch)\n|-\n| Daegu class\n|\n| FFG: Frigate Guided-missile || 3,100/3,650\n|2018|| 8 || - || FFG-II\n|-\n| Incheon class\n|\n| FFG: Frigate Guided-missile || 2,500/3,251\n|2013|| 6 || - || FFG-I\n|-\n|Ulsan class\n|\n| FF: Frigate || 1,446/2,350\n|1981|| 2 || - || To be replaced by FFG\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" |Corvettes\n|-\n| Pohang class\n|\n| PCC: Patrol Combat Corvette || 950/1,220\n|1984|| 3 || - || To be replaced by FFG\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" |Patrol vessels\n|-\n| Yoon Youngha class\n|\n| PKG: Patrol Killer Guided-missile || 440/570\n|2008||18|| - || -\n|-\n|Chamsuri (PKMR 211) class\n| -\n| PKMR: Patrol Killer Medium Rocket || 210/250\n|2017|| 16 || - || PKX-B Batch-I (16 in batch), Batch-II (18 in batch)\n|-\n| Chamsuri (PKM 268) class\n|\n| PKM: Patrol Killer Medium || 151/170\n|1978|| 26 || - || To be replaced by PKG & PKMR\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" |Amphibious warfare ships\n|-\n| Dokdo class\n|\n| LPH: Landing Transport Helicopter|| 14,550/19,000\n|2007|| 2 || -|| -\n|-\n| Cheonwangbong class\n|\n| LST: Landing Ship Tank || 4,900/8,000\n|2014|| 4|| - || LST-II\n|-\n| Kojunbong class\n|\n| LST: Landing Ship Tank || 2,900/4,900\n|1993|| 4 || - || -\n|-\n| Solgae (LSF 631) class\n|\n| LSF: Landing Ship Fast || 95/155\n|2007|| 4 || 2 ||LSF-II (locally-built LCAC)\n|-\n| Solgae (LSF 621) class\n|\n| LSF: Landing Ship Fast\n|132/149\n|2005\n|3\n| -\n|Assault hovercraft (Project 12061E Murena-E) transferred from Russia[http://www.rusarm.ru/cataloque/navy_cataloque.html \"Navy Catalog\" (PDF Format)] .

In 2025, the United States announced that it had given South Korea approval to build nuclear power-submarines at the South Korean owned Hanwha Philly Shipyard in the US. Days after the US announcement, Reuters reported that a South Korean presidential official had said that South Korea wishes to use enriched uranium from the US to build nuclear power-submarines in South Korea. South Korean Prime Minister Kim Min-seok said the following week that the Hanwha Philly Shipyard did not currently have the capability to build a nuclear-powered submarine. On 5 November, Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back contradicted President Trump's earlier statement asserting that \"there has been no mention of where to build them, whether in Korea or the US\".\n* Aircraft Carrier Experimental (CVX)\nThe ROK Navy initially planned to build an amphibious assault ships capable of operating the F-35B as the LPX-II program. In August 2020, the Ministry of National Defense formally announced its intent to begin construction of a 30,000-ton light aircraft carrier, and it was authorized as the CVX program in February 2021. The ROK Navy plans to acquire an aircraft carrier by 2033.\n* Korea Destroyer Experimental (KDX)\nThe KDX program was a three-phased program to modernize the surface fleet by developing and constructing new destroyers for the ROK Navy with advanced combat systems and weaponry. The outcomes of this program include the Kwanggaeto the Great-class destroyer destroyers, which are the first ROK destroyers to be armed with surface-to-air missiles; the Chungmugong Yi Sunshin-class destroyers; and the powerful , which are equipped with the sophisticated AEGIS combat system for air-defense and anti-missile operations. These new destroyers replaced antiquated destroyers that had been transferred from the U.S. Navy decades ago.\nAs follow up programs, the ROK Navy plans to build three additional AEGIS destroyers (KDX-III Batch-II) by 2028, and six 8,000-ton destroyers (KDDX) by 2030 as successors of the Chungmugong Yi Sunshin-class destroyers.\n* Frigate Experimental (FFX)\nThe FFX program aims to replace the Ulsan-class frigates and Donghae/Pohang-class corvettes with new frigates. The total number of the ships to be built is 26 (FFX batch-I batch-II batch-III batch-IV). These frigates will be armed with the American-made Phalanx CIWS system and the rolling airframe missile system, and they will each carry an anti-submarine warfare helicopter.\nSix s (FFX Batch-I) were commissioned by 2016. The lead ship (FFG 818) in a class of eight in the  (FFX Batch-II) was commissioned in 2018. As follow-up, six  (FFX Batch-III) are planned, and the lead ship is to be delivered in 2024.\n* Patrol Killer Experimental (PKX)\nThrough the PKX program, the ROK Navy plans to build a fleet of a next generation patrol craft with Cooperative Engagement Capability and enhanced weaponry such as 76&nbsp;mm guns and the KSSM anti-ship missiles. There are two variations: PKX-A and PKX-B. The PKX-A is a 570-ton patrol craft with anti-ship missiles; PKX-B is a 200-ton patrol craft. 18 PKX-As and 34 PKX-Bs are planned.\nOn 28 June 2007, the lead ship of PKX-A, PKG 711 named, ROKS Yoon Youngha, captain of PKM 357 at the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong was launched at the shipyard of Hanjin Heavy Industries in Busan. All 18 PKGs were commissioned by 2018 to replace the aging Chamsuri-class patrol craft. The lead ship of PKX-B, ROKS Chamsuri 211 (PKMR 211), was commissioned in 2017.\n* Landing Transport Experimental (LPX)\nThe LPX program was the ROK Navy's new amphibious warfare ship program for which Hanjin Heavy Industries has provided the general design package. The ROK Navy's requirements for the new amphibious warfare ships were to enhance Korea's current amphibious operation capability, both in terms of assault and military operations other than war (MOOTW) type operations.\nOn 12 July 2005, the lead ship (LPH 6111) of the 14,500-ton Dokdo-class amphibious transport dock was launched at the shipyard of Hanjin Heavy Industries in Busan.
