      "text": "# White Revolution (neo-Nazi group)\n\nWhite Revolution was a neo-Nazi group that was active in Arkansas from 2002 to 2011. It was headquartered out of Russellville, Arkansas. The group was founded by Billy Joe Roper Jr., a neo-Nazi activist who identifies himself as a \"Balkanizer\" and a \"Purity Spiraler\". He founded White Revolution in 2002 as an anti-Semitic group promoting white interests. He was a former member of the National Alliance.\nThe party was shut down by Roper in 2011, when he elected to join with Thom Robb's group. Roper now leads the ShieldWall Network, a white nationalist organization with the goal of building a white ethno-state.\nReferences"
