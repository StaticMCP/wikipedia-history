It is located in Sequoia National Park,  southeast of Triple Divide Peak and  northwest of Black Kaweah. The High Sierra Trail traverses Kaweah Gap south of the summit, and Lilliput Glacier is on the mountain's northern flank.\nThe mountain is named for George W. Stewart, editor of Visalia Delta. Stewart was the leader of a campaign to protect the \"Big Trees\". Francis P. Farquhar, author and former president of the Sierra Club, credits Stewart as \"the father\" of Sequoia National Park.\nClimate\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Mount Stewart is located in an alpine climate zone. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Sierra Nevada mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the range.\nReferences"
