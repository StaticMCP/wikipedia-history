It was a discussion series featuring a panel of four. Angus Maude was the original host, later it was hosted by Joe Gullett. In one episode, the panel criticised the banning of the book ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'', in another episode there was a debate on the future of the United Nations, while another episode featured a discussion of the space race.\nEpisode status\nDespite airing in an era where wiping of television series was common, three 1961 episodes are held by the National Film and Sound Archive.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
