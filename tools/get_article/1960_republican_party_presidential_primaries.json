Incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon was selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 1960 Republican National Convention held from July 25 to July 28, 1960, in Chicago, Illinois.\nAt this time, primaries were not conclusive in deciding a party's nominee. However, Nixon faced no formidable opposition. He swept the primaries without difficulty and received the nomination unanimously at the July convention. He was briefly opposed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, who withdrew and endorsed Nixon after struggling in the polls.\nCandidates\nThe following political leaders were candidates for the 1960 Republican presidential nomination:\nNominee\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Candidate\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Most recent office\n!Home state\n! data-sort-type=\"date\" |Campaign\nWithdrawal date\n!Popular vote\n!Contests won\n!colspan=\"2\" | Running mate\n|- style=\"background:linen;\"\n! style=\"background:linen;\" scope=\"row\" data-sort-=\"\" |Richard Nixon\n| style=\"min-width:80px;\" |\n| style=\"background:#FF8080;\" |\n|Vice President of the United States(1953–1961)\n|\nCalifornia\n| data-sort-value=\"0\" |(Campaign)Secured nomination: July 28, 1960\n| data-sort-value=\"4,975,938\" |4,975,938(86.6%)\n| data-sort-value=\"11\" |11\n|Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.\n|\n|}\nOther major candidates\nThese candidates participated in multiple state primaries or were included in multiple major national polls.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Candidate\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Most recent office\n!Home state\n! data-sort-type=\"date\" |Campaign\nWithdrawal date\n|-\n! data-sort-value=\"Rockefeller\" scope=\"row\" |Nelson Rockefeller\n|\n| style=\"background:#5d73e5;\" |\n|Governor ofNew York(1959–1973)\n|\nNew York\n| data-sort-value=\"03-04-2016\" |(Campaign)Suspended campaign: December 26, 1959Re-entered race: June 8, 1960\n|}\nFavorite sons\nThe following candidates ran only in their home state's primary or caucus for the purpose of controlling its delegate slate at the convention and did not appear to be considered national candidates by the media.\n* Former U.S. Senator George H.
