It is typically issued by a local or state authority and is relayed by the National Weather Service. The warning usually mentions a specific hazard such as contaminated water supply, active shooting, unexpected weather alert such as causing roads to be extremely dangerous, major accident, or an imminent or in-progress military or terrorist attack. It may also provide instructions for protective action such as to evacuate, shelter-in-place, boil water or seek medical treatment. The warning has a higher priority than a local area emergency (LAE), as well as a civil emergency message (CEM).\nExamples\nHawaii false missile alert\nOn January 13, 2018, as part of the false missile alert, a civil danger warning interrupted local television and radio broadcasts throughout Hawaii, in addition to the warning sent to smartphones.\nBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII.
