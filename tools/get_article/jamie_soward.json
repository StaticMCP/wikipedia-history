St. George Illawarra started losing matches and he was blamed partially for it. On 17 April he signed a four-year contract with the Penrith Panthers for $1.5 million Australian Dollars.\nIn round 13 he got dropped to NSW Cup. Two weeks later, on 17 June 2013, Soward, after being denied a release to join Penrith by the St. George club, signed with the London Broncos in the Super League for the rest of the 2013 season after a falling out with Dragons coach Steve Price.

In round 9, against the Newcastle Knights at Hunter Stadium, Soward scored his first try for the Penrith club in a 32–10 victory. In Penrith's Finals Week 1 match against the minor premiers, the Sydney Roosters at the Sydney Football Stadium, Soward kicked the game-winning field goal in the last minute of play in Penrith's 19–18 victory over the Roosters. Soward capped off a brilliant season in his first year with Panthers with him playing in 25 matches, scoring seven tries, kicking 63 goals and a field goal.\nOff the field in 2014, Soward began a feud with former NRL player Beau Ryan after Ryan mocked Soward on The Footy Show.  Soward was reportedly angry that Ryan had made fun of his voice and the way that he talked as the player has a lisp.  Ryan came out to the media and said “It's all light-hearted stuff and I didn't mean to hurt anyone, and if I have hurt anyone I'll stop it\".\n2015\nFollowing round 2 against the Gold Coast Titans in the Penrith club's 40-0 win at Bathurst, Soward had back surgery and missed a month and a half. When Soward returned in round 9, against the Brisbane Broncos in the club's 8-5 loss at Penrith Stadium, he was inconsistent at best and, coupled with a spate of injuries, he and the Panthers struggled throughout the season. The Penrith Panthers finished off a brutal 2015 NRL season just two points shy of a wooden spoon. Soward finished the season playing in 16 matches and kicking 22 goals. On 10 October 2015, rumours were floating around about Soward was set be released from the Penrith club but these were dismissed by Soward. In early December, Soward gave himself a 12-month ultimatum: vowing to walk away from the game if he didn't return to his best in the 2016 season.\n2016\nOn 13 February 2016, Soward played for the Indigenous All Stars against the World All Stars, playing off the interchange bench in the 8-12 loss at Suncorp Stadium. In Round 10 of the 2016 NRL season, Soward scored a try and kicked five goals against the New Zealand Warriors in Penrith's 30-18 win, breaking his two-year try-scoring drought in what was one of his best solo performances in over a year. However, Soward's form later slumped and he was dropped to the NSW Cup. On 30 June 2016, Soward was released from his Penrith contract mid-way through the season and he re-joined the London Broncos. Soward was sent off for punching during London's 34-30 defeat by Leigh Centurions.\nOn 15 July 2016, Soward taunted former NRL player Beau Ryan on social media after Ryan had done another skit on The Footy Show making fun of Soward.  In the sketch presented by Ryan on the show, Soward's face was superimposed on the black cat that ran onto Pepper Stadium.  Ryan commented \"Over the weekend we saw a strange new trend of coaches and ex-players trying to sneak into the grounds and not be noticed.  This little scaredy cat (vision of Soward's face on cat) who tried to run away had no-one fooled…\".  Ryan then added in a whiny voice: \"It's too cold…meow\".\nSoward then took to social media platform Twitter and displayed a picture of himself holding the NRL premiership trophy which he won as a player in 2010 with St George and the caption of \"Show me yours and I'll show you mine, oh wait shit sorry you don't have one#\".\nSoward then typed a message at Ryan saying \"He must miss me I'm not even in the country and still doing shit jokes. Oh well guess that's why I work with the gang @FOXSportsAUS all class\".\nOn 7 November 2016, Soward announced his retirement, ending a 14-year professional career. Soward played in 12 matches, scored 1 try and kicked 32 goals for the Penrith Panthers in the 2016 NRL season.\nPost-playing\nIn 2017, Soward began working for Fox Sports. The following year he became a commentator for Channel 9 on their coverage of the Canterbury Cup NSW competition.\nIn 2019, Soward joined the 2GB Continuous Call Team program as one of the co-commentators for the Saturday night matches. Soward also joined Macquarie Sports Radio. In 2020, he launched a podcast which he hosts called Sweet and Soward with semi-regular co-host Nick Davis and ‘The Dereks’ who make guest appearances.\nIn 2021, he joined the St. George Illawarra coaching staff as a kicking coach. That year he was also named as the 2022 St. George Illawarra NRL Women's Premiership team head-coach. On 2 September 2024 it was announced that Soward had been let go as the coach of the NRLW squad after being told the option in his contract would not be activated.\nOn 20 September 2023, he was appointed as head coach of Samoa Women for the forthcoming end-of-year Pacific Championships.\nIn October 2025, Soward was announced as coach for the North Coast Bulldogs for their 2026 season.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.londonbroncosrl.com/players/jamie-soward/ London Broncos profile]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20151223080107/http://www.penrithpanthers.com.au/team/profiles/jamie_soward.html 2015 Penrith Panthers profile]"
