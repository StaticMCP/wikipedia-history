The municipal decision to form the Warsaw Reconstruction Office was formalized by a decree from the State National Council on 24 May 1945, tasking it with overseeing the reconstruction of the capital.\nThe office was led by Roman Piotrowski, with  and  serving as deputy directors. Initially, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office focused on securing and cataloging the surviving remnants of the city's infrastructure.\nIts first headquarters were located in Ludwik Tarnowski's tenement (Cooperative Housing Association of the Ministry of Public Works) at 4  in the  district. In February 1945, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office's secretariat relocated to a tenement at 33 . As the office expanded, it occupied additional buildings at 35 Chocimska Street, 1 and 3 Skolimowska Street, 3 Sędziowska Street in Ochota, and surviving pavilions of the Ujazdów Hospital. Local Warsaw Reconstruction Office studios were established in less-damaged districts such as Bielany, Żoliborz, Mokotów, and Saska Kępa, while the Historic Architecture Department opened branches in the Old Town and Łazienki Park. Many employees and their families resided at the Jazdów Estate, a settlement of Finnish houses.\nThe Warsaw Reconstruction Office served as the city's urban planning body, construction administration, building inspection authority, and conservation office. In 1945, it comprised the following departments:\n* Urban Planning Department\n* Architecture and Engineering Department\n* Historic Architecture Department\n* Engineering Department\n* Economic Planning Department\n* Propaganda Department\n* Contracts Department\n* Supervision Department\n* Surveying Department\n* Administrative and Economic Department\n* Independent Personnel Department\n* Independent Control Department\n* General Secretariat\nIn February 1945, a canteen was opened at the Warsaw Reconstruction Office headquarters on Chocimska Street. In May 1945, on the initiative of Józef Sigalin, the office established a sports club with sections for athletics, boxing, association football, shooting sports, water sports, tennis, and winter sports. It also operated a holiday resort in , known as Bosówka.\nBy July 1945, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office employed approximately 1,500 people, including architects, urban planners, engineers, economists, and lawyers.\nThe Warsaw Reconstruction Office co-organised the Warsaw Accuses exhibition, which opened on 3 May 1945 at the National Museum in Warsaw. Between March and April 1945, the office conducted the \"red plaques\" campaign, placing around 800 red plaques on historic structures, often destroyed, with the inscription: ''Warsaw Reconstruction Office – Historic Building, a Document of National Culture. Altering the Building's Condition is Strictly Prohibited''. These efforts underscored the office's focus on preserving architectural heritage. In October 1945, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office launched the weekly magazine Skarpa Warszawska, which was later transformed into , becoming a platform for urban and social discussions about the city's future. For buildings reconstructed with the office's support, plaques featuring a compass and the inscription National Reconstruction were designed.\nFrom 1947 to 1949, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office oversaw the construction of the East–West Route, including a tunnel beneath Miodowa Street and Krakowskie Przedmieście. By 1952, the office had reconstructed the Old Town, Krakowskie Przedmieście, New World Street, parts of Miodowa Street, , , Theatre Square, and Bank Square. However, these reconstructions were often inconsistent, loosely based on pre-war designs, and occasionally altered their original appearance.\nIn 1945, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office's responsibilities were gradually reduced. In August 1945, responsibility for roads and bridges was transferred to the municipal government, and in March 1946, it assumed building inspections. In mid-1946, the Warsaw Reconstruction Directorate took over the office's investment management, and in September 1946, the Historic Architecture Department was dissolved, with its duties transferred to the City Conservation Office. By 1947, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office primarily functioned as an urban planning office. Its staff decreased from 500 in July 1947 to 280 in January 1948, and 193 by June 1948. The office was officially dissolved in 1951 by a Council of Ministers regulation issued on 6 September 1950.\nDue to the scale of Warsaw's destruction, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office was humorously referred to as \"Boże Odbuduj Stolicę\" (\"God, Rebuild the Capital\").\nThe office's archives, housed at the , comprise 14,679 files containing maps, plans, designs, inventory notes, and photographs from 1945 to 1953. The collection is being digitized. In 2011, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office's archives, along with 44 other global archival collections, were added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.\nControversies\nThe Urban Planning Department's actions drew criticism, as many surviving tenements were demolished under the Warsaw Reconstruction Office's orders, even though they required only minor repairs, such as replacing burnt roofs or ceilings. This led to the destruction of large portions of streets, including , , Ogrodowa, , , Wolska, and Marszałkowska. There were also instances of ideologically driven destruction of building facades and sculptures, justified as \"tidying\", \"modernizing\", or removing \"questionable decorations\".\nNotable people associated with Warsaw Reconstruction Office\n– architect and conservator\n* Jan Bieńkowski – conservator\n*  – architect, member of the Grey Ranks\n*  – architect\n* Jerzy Brabander – architect\n* Barbara Brukalska – architect\n*  – architect\n* Maria Chodźko-Zachwatowicz – architect\n*  – architect, conservator, Home Army soldier\n* Zofia Cydzikowa – conservator\n*  – architect and conservator\n*  – architect and conservator\n* Krystyna Dobrowolska – architect\n* Jan Dobrowolski – architect\n* Zofia Döllinger – nurse\n*  – architect and urban planner\n*  – architect and urban planner\n* Jan Grudziński – architect\n*  – architect\n* Stanisław Jankowski, codenamed Agaton – architect, Polish Armed Forces soldier, Silent Unseen, Home Army intelligence officer\n*  – architect\n*  – architect\n* Halina Kosmólska-Szulc – conservator\n*  – architect, conservator, sculptor\n*  – landscape architect and art historian\n*  – architect and urban planner\n* Roman Piotrowski – architect and politician\n*  – architect, Polish Armed Forces soldier\n*  – architect, urban planner, conservator\n*  – architect and landscape architect\n* Alina Scholtz – landscape architect\n* Kazimierz Adam Saski – architect, urban planner, conservator\n*  – architect\n*  – architect, urban planner, First Polish Army soldier, politician\n* Halina Skibniewska – architect, urban planner, politician\n*  – architect, urban planner, politician\n* Marian Spychalski – architect, People's Guard and People's Army soldier, politician\n* Helena Syrkus – architect\n*  – architect, deputy director of Warsaw Reconstruction Office\n* Stanisław Szurmak – architect\n* Hanna Szwankowska – Warsaw historian\n*  – architect\n*  – architect\n* Jan Zachwatowicz – architect and conservator\n* Juliusz Wojciech Zamecznik – poster artist and photographer\n* Stanisław Zamecznik – architect, visual artist, exhibition designer, graphic designer, set designer\n}}\nCommemorations\n* On 14 February 1985, a commemorative plaque was unveiled on the façade of the tenement at 33 Chocimska Street, reading: In this building, on 14 February 1945, the Warsaw Reconstruction Office began its work.
