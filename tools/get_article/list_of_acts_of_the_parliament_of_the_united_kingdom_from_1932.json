For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n22 & 23 Geo. 5\nContinuing the first session of the 36th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 3 November 1931 until 17 November 1932.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 22 & 23 G. 5.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  the period in respect of which transitional payments may be made in certain cases under the Unemployment Insurance (National Economy) (No. 2) Order, 1931.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  in certain particulars, and also other enactments relating to the Customs, and to make further provision in connection with Finance.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  and section one of the Coal Mines Act, 1931.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  to make provision for applying the rules contained in the said Convention, subject to exceptions, adaptations and modifications, to carriage by air which is not international carriage within the meaning of the Convention, and for purposes connected with the purposes aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and other enactments relating to the young; and for objects connected with the purposes aforesaid.}}\n|  and other enactments relating to the young; and for objects connected with the purposes aforesaid.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  by making provision for the payment of pensions thereunder in respect of the insurance of persons who cease to be insured within twelve months before death or before attaining the age of sixty-five, and by modifying the statutory conditions applicable to such pensions in the case of persons who, after ceasing to be insured, again become insured; to repeal subsection (7) of section forty-four of the said Act; and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and to enable the same rules to be observed in granting outdoor relief under the enactments relating to the poor law.|note4= }}\n|  and section thirty-eight of the Solicitors Act, 1932, and to make provision for the costs of applications under section eighty-four of the Law of Property Act, 1925.|note4= }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n|po1=Maidstone Extension Order 1931|po1year=y|Provisional Order extending a borough.}}\n|  and repealing or amending certain confirmation Acts.}}\n|  for the regulation of an Oyster and Mussel Fishery in certain parts of the sea adjoining the county of Glamorgan.|po1=Swansea Fishery Order 1931|po1year=y|Order for the Regulation of an Oyster and Mussel Fishery in certain parts of the sea adjoining the county of Glamorgan.}}\n|  }}\n|  relating to Edinburgh Corporation.|po1=Edinburgh Order 1932|Provisional Order to consolidate with amendments the Acts and Orders of or relating to the transport and gas undertakings of the Corporation of the city and royal burgh of Edinburgh and the borrowing rating and assessing powers of the Corporation to confer further powers upon the Corporation in respect of these matters to transfer to the Corporation part of the tramway undertaking of the Musselburgh and District Electric Light and Traction Company Limited to make further provision for the local government and improvement of the city to make provision with reference to the registration districts of the city under the Registration of Births Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Acts and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Edinburgh Corporation (Sheriff Court House &c.).|note4=|po1=Edinburgh Corporation (Sheriff Court House, &c.)
