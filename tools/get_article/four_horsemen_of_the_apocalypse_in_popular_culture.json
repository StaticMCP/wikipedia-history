Despite being one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse the Cuylers are not fazed by his presences (at first they think he is part of the US Air Force). He shows his power by releasing a plague of \"scorpions with human faces\" and turns water into blood, however to his astonishment and disgust the squids eat the scorpions and drink the blood.

Alistair claims that the scythe he is carrying was borrowed from an old friend who didn't \"really ride a pale horse\" but who does \"have three amigos\" who are \"jonesing for the Apocalypse\". After the raising of Lucifer at the end of the fourth season, the Horsemen are unleashed onto the world. Each takes the form of a male with an appropriately coloured car and a ring that imbues them their power. However, these rings are also the only apparent weakness of War, Famine and Pestilence, as removing their rings weakens them considerably, although Death is unaffected by the removal of his ring (Death is only following Lucifer's agenda due to a spell binding him to Lucifer, although the other three Horsemen appear to be willing servants of Lucifer). In \"Hammer of the Gods\", the final message of the archangel Gabriel reveals that the Horsemen's rings have the power to recapture Lucifer by re-opening his Cage when they are put together and a particular spell is chanted.\n** In the fifth-season episode \"Good God, Y'All!\", War, portrayed by Titus Welliver, makes an appearance. He drives a cherry red Ford Mustang and uses the ring on his right ring finger to make people hallucinate and kill each other by provoking conflict; in the episode, he divides a town by causing two groups to believe that the other side has been possessed by demons, but his influence is ended when Sam and Dean manage to cut off his ring.\n** In the episode \"My Bloody Valentine\", Famine, portrayed by James Otis, appeared as a sick, wheelchair-using old man and causes suicides in a town by making people consume/perform what they hunger for until their death; examples include a couple hungering for love literally eating each other, a man on a diet gorging himself on Twinkies, a former alcoholic drinking himself to death, and even the protagonist's angelic ally Castiel is attacked through his vessel's hunger for red meat. Arriving with an entourage of demons in a black SUV, Famine would feast on souls until he was strong enough to spread on his own. He was defeated when Dean Winchester proved immune to his powers – albeit because Dean was spiritually dead after the difficulties he had experienced during the Apocalypse – and Sam Winchester's old demonic powers were awakened when Famine restored his addiction to demon blood, allowing Sam to use his demonic powers to attack Famine by attacking the demons he had just consumed.\n** Pestilence, portrayed by Matt Frewer appears at the end of \"Hammer Of The Gods\". He walks into a service station and spreads disease by spreading sickly, green slime everywhere and bringing flies into the place. He is then shown driving away in a dirty Pinto whilst flies flood the car; his rampage is shown in the next episode, \"The Devil You Know\", causing regional outbreaks of swine flu across the nation. He actively appeared in \"Two Minutes to Midnight\", shown capable to infect humans with a plethora of diseases, also being a pivotal part of Lucifer's apocalypse; his pandemic of swine flu allowed the distribution of the Croatoan virus under the guise of vaccines. He was working in a nursing home, crafting hybrid diseases that caused instant death. Castiel was ultimately responsible for destroying him when he proved partly immune to Pestilence's powers despite his weakened condition.\n** The Horsemen Death is summoned to Earth by Lucifer via a ritual in the episode \"Abandon All Hope...\", albeit unseen. He is then mentioned in \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\", though again not seen, where he raises fifteen dead who return to their families only to turn rabid after a certain time. In \"Two Minutes to Midnight\", Death, now portrayed by Julian Richings, is shown walking along the street with a cane; he bumps into a man, who after making a pithy remark, soon falls over dead. Death drives a pale 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Seville. Death explains to Dean that he is unwillingly bound to Lucifer, and is not particularly interested in the apocalypse. Death provides his ring, extracting a promise that Dean will do anything to stop Lucifer. This version of Death claims to be as old as, if not older than, God, as neither of them can remember who came first. An eternal being, Death reappears after the apocalypse, helping Dean recover Sam's soul – still trapped in Lucifer's Cage even after his body was rescued – helping the Winchesters restore Castiel to normal after he was driven mad by the souls he acquired from Purgatory by providing them with the means to perform a ritual to separate the Purgatory souls from Castiel, and coming to talk to Sam when he faced death after failing to complete the trials to seal Hell. Death was killed by Dean in the tenth-season finale when he was preparing to kill Dean to free him from the Mark of Cain – Dean using Death's scythe to slay him – later Sam met another Reaper and after a subsequent conversation with that Reaper revealing that a new Death will be formed and resurrections will no longer be permitted. This reaper, Billie (Lisa Berry), is killed by Castiel in \"First Blood\" while she's preparing to permanently reap one of the Winchesters. A subsequent episode, \"Advanced Thanatology\", reveals that Billie has been promoted under the rule that the first reaper to be killed after Death dies becomes the new Death.\n* In the final episode of Tru Calling, \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas...Again\", Tru calls her foil character Jack the fourth horseman of the apocalypse, as he is frequently referenced as \"death\".\n* The Walking Dead episode \"Arrow on the Doorpost\" was originally titled \"Pale Horse\".\n* In the final season of X-Men: Evolution, Apocalypse transforms Mystique, Storm, Professor X, and Magneto into his Horsemen, respectively giving them the names War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death.\n* In The Young Ones, season 1, episode 5 \"Interesting\", which first aired in the UK in 1982, Rick Mayall and Nigel Planer are preparing the house for a party when a born-again Christian preacher, played by Dawn French pushes her way inside.

One of them on the group photograph remains unidentified, but is implied to be already dead (he's crossed out like the others will be). In the sequel, Modern Warfare 2, the main antagonist, Vladimir Makarov, bears a heavy likeliness to the unidentified horseman from the first game. [This is confirmed in the third game.] Considering both the exploits of Makarov and that the Modern Warfare series was planned as a trilogy, it is very likely that he is the Second Horseman \"War\".\n* In Champions: Return to Arms, the Four Horsemen can be battled in a bonus stage.\n* In City of Heroes, players must defeat the four Riders in the second mission of The Lady Grey Task Force.

They are sitting around a campfire, and make comments about the apocalypse, which has already occurred. Each horseman is in the \"almost dead\" health range, indicating that they have very low health compared to their maximum health. However, if a player attempts to heal any of the horseman, it becomes obvious that they each have ridiculous amounts of health, and that \"almost dead\" is still extremely high. Upon exiting the area, the player's party leader is switched for the squad member with the lowest charisma, thanks to the chaotic nature of the horsemen.\n* In Final Fantasy VII, Sephiroth uses an attack called \"Pale Horse\".\n* In Final Fight: Streetwise, a psychotic priest named Father Bella created a powerful strength-enhancing drug called \"glow\" and hopes to use the drug to bring about the apocalypse.
