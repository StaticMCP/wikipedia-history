      "text": "# 1947–48 Philadelphia Warriors season\n\nThe 1947–48 Philadelphia Warriors season was the Warriors' 2nd season in the BAA (which later became the NBA). Entering this season, the Warriors sought to repeat as champions in the BAA in a shortened up 48-game schedule of play after previously winning the league's inaugural championship over the Chicago Stags in an eleven team league. By the end of their second season of play, the Warriors ended up becoming Eastern Division champions with a 27–21 record, claiming that mark by one game over the New York Knickerbockers. In the 1948 BAA playoffs, the Warriors would defeat the best team of the entire league in terms of records this season, the St. Louis Bombers, 4–3, but were ultimately upset by the only new team of the BAA that season, the Baltimore Bullets from the original American Basketball League that they had already won a championship (or two, according to them) from previously, 4–2, ending the Warriors' bid at being the first BAA team to repeat as champions in their league. With their loss to Baltimore and later seeing the original Bullets squad fold operations on November 27, 1954, the original Baltimore Bullets squad that first started out in the ABL are currently the only BAA/NBA team (as of 2025) to have folded operations while also being crowned champions of the league; that Bullets squad that beat the Warriors would also join the Chicago Stags squad that lost to the Warriors in the previous year's championship and the Washington Capitols in the following year's championship as the only BAA/NBA teams that competed for a BAA/NBA Finals championship to later fold operations altogether.\nBAA Draft\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#003399;color:#FFCC33;\" width=\"7%\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#003399;color:#FFCC33;\"
