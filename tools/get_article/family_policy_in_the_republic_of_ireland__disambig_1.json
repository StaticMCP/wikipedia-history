As Millar, Coen, Bradley and Rau state in their article on parenting, work, and family policies, \"the growing number of Irish women engaged in paid work contributed significantly to economic growth and the so-called \"Celtic Tiger\" boom, from only 7.5 percent in 1971 to 48.8 percent in 2004\".&nbsp;They also state that because of the increase of female labor participation, most Irish women suffer from \"dual burden\", which is because family policies have lagged, leaving no support for child care services.&nbsp; Even though family policies are a bigger concern in Ireland compared to other liberal democracies, the Irish female labor participation is much lower. &nbsp;There is still plenty of improvements that need to be made in Irish family policies.\nReferences"
