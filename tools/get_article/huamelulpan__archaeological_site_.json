The apogee of the settlement is estimated at the Ramos Phase (300 BCE – 200 CE), the period of Mesoamerican urban society's development.\nThe site was part of other early settlements in the region, such as Cerro de las Minas, Yucuita, Diquiyú and Monte Negro. Their apogee is characterized by monumental architecture and sculptures, there is also evidence of clear social stratification within their residential zones.\nDuring site investigations many high quality urns were found here, similar Zapotec samples were found in the central valleys. Carved monoliths were found at the site, these are considered to be unique since none have been found at other Mixtec urban centers that have such similarity to the Zapotec writing of Monte Albán.\nHistory\nThe foundation of this ancient prehispanic city goes back to 400 BCE, it was an important urban center up to 800 CE; it is a good sample of the early Mixtec culture, called Ñuu Sa Na' or \"Ancient People\" (Ñuu Yata in the Mixteca Baja).\nDuring their early urban stages, Huamelulpan and the main Mixtec centers maintained complex and variable relations with Monte Albán. Towards 200 CE, some Mixtec centers were partially or totally abandoned and between 400 and 800 CE, there was another urban center boom, when Huamelulpan and other sites lost their close relationships with Monte Albán and established new relations with Lower Mixtec centers linked with groups from Puebla and perhaps the Valley of Mexico. The Lower Mixtec (Ñuiñe) culture developed at this time. The city was abandoned by the Postclassic and it was only used for sumptuary burials.\nAccording to archaeological history, the site was a very important Mixtec center, where tributes were received, to be traded with Puebla, Tehuacán and all of Oaxaca to the Pacific coast; from Tehuacán and Puebla traded fabrics and yarns, from the coast traded chilies, Jamaica, jicaras, dried fish, salt, sea shells used for necklaces, earrings, etc.\nAncient Huamelulpan had important weapon and fur workshops.\nDiscovery\nThe Huamelulpan archaeological site was discovered in 1933 by Alfonso Caso and many of the pieces found are in exhibition at the Town Community Museum.\nToponymy\nThe name Huamelulpan comes from the Nahuatl language, a language that was not spoken by the original inhabitants. Its Nahuatl name means \"In the huautli mound\", the Mixtec name is Yucunindaba, and it means \"Hill that flew\".\nJansen y Pérez Jimenez offer an alternative opinion, that the native name is Yucunundaua, which translates \"Hill of the Wooden Columns\".\nAccording to the Mexico Municipalities Encyclopedia, the name Huamelulpam was developed from two huamil trees that grew together and formed a letter (h), the story goes that these trees lasted for centuries, and the town was called Huamelulpam.\nMixtec phases\nThe Alta-Mixteca region development has been segregated into various phases; Cruz, Ramos, Las Flores and Natividad, that covers the region development from about 1500 BCE to 1530 CE.\nCruz-Ramos transition. During the transition from the mid-formative period (Late Cruz) to the late- formative (Early Ramos) the number of sites decreased in the studied area.\nIt is considered a consequence of the development of early Mixtec urban centers – a process observed elsewhere in Oaxaca – the Central Valleys, the Huamelulpan Valley, and the Eastern Nochixtlán Valley. Two of the Early Ramos sites – Monte Negro and Cerro Jazmin – were already urban centers covering more than one km2.\nThere is an apparent absence of settlements dating to the Late Ramos (200 B.C.-200 A.D.) in the major part of the area surveyed (only 15 sites, 170 ha comparing to 62 sites and 700 ha of Early Ramos). It is a striking fact because in Yucuita and Huamelulpan this period was a time of the major centralization and florescence of the regional states and general growth of the population. At the same time only two sites in the surveyed area had continuous occupation from Early Ramos to Early Flores while 20 had a gap between these phases.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Mixteca Alta Survey (Tlaxiaco, Teposcolula and Nochixtlán)\n!Phase\n!colspan=\"2\"| Chronnology\n!Tlaxiaco\n!Teposcolula\n!Nochixtlán\n!Total\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Cruz\n|colspan=\"2\"| 1500–300 BCE\n|47 Sites\n|40 Sites\n|29 Sites\n|116 Sites\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Ramos\n|colspan=\"2\"| 300 BCE – 200 CE\n| 41 Sites\n| 27 Sites\n|10 Sites\n|78 Sites\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Las Flores\n|colspan=\"2\"| 200–1000 CE\n|92 Sites\n|67 Sites\n|49 Sites\n|208 Sites\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Natividad\n|colspan=\"2\"| 1000–1530 CE\n| 199 Sites\n| 179 Sites\n|88 Sites\n|466 Sites\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"|Regional survey in the Central Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca, México. Conducted between January 1 and June 15, 1999.\n|}\nMixtec culture\nThe Mixtec (or Mixteca) are indigenous Mesoamerican peoples inhabiting the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero and Puebla in a region known as La Mixteca.  The Mixtecan languages form an important branch of the Otomanguean language family.\nThe name \"Mixtec\" is a Nahuatl exonym, from  'cloud'  'inhabitant of place of'. Speakers of Mixtec use an expression (which varies by dialect) to refer to their own language, and generally this expression means \"word of the rain\":  '''Tu'un Sávi  in one variety, for example, and Dà'àn Dávi  in another.\nMixtec language\nThe Mixtecan languages' constitute a branch of the Otomanguean language family of Mexico. The Mixtecan branch includes the Trique (or Triqui) languages, spoken by about 24,500 people; Cuicatec, spoken by about 15,000 people; and the large group of Mixtec languages proper, spoken by about 511,000 people. Again, the Mixtec languages proper are a grouping within the Mixtecan branch of the Otomanguean family. Virtually all of the remainder of this article is about Mixtec proper; for Cuicatec and Trique, see the separate articles. The internal classification of the Mixtecan branch, i.e., the subgrouping between Trique, Cuicatec, and Mixtec proper, is an open question. As to the Mixtec languages proper, identifying how many there are poses challenges at the level of linguistic theory. Depending on the criteria for distinguishing between a difference of dialects and a difference of languages, there may be as many as 50 different Mixtec languages\nLanguage, codices, and artwork\nThe Mixtecan languages (in their many variants) were estimated to be spoken by about 300,000 people at the end of the 20th century, although the majority of Mixtec speakers also had at least a working knowledge of the Spanish language. Some Mixtecan languages are called by names other than Mixtec, particularly Cuicatec (Cuicateco), and Triqui (or Trique).\n]] The Mixtec are well known in the anthropological world for their Codices, or phonetic pictures in which they wrote their history and genealogies in deerskin in the \"fold-book\" form. The best known story of the Mixtec Codices is that of Lord Eight Deer, named after the day in which he was born, whose personal name is Jaguar Claw, and whose epic history is related in several codices, including the Codex Bodley and Codex Zouche-Nuttall. He successfully conquered and united most of the Mixteca region.\nMuseum, Washington, D.C.]]\nThey were also known for their exceptional mastery of jewelry, in which gold and turquoise figure prominently. The production of Mixtec goldsmiths formed an important part of the tribute the Mixtecs had to pay to the Aztecs during parts of their history.\nMixtec writing\n, a village is being sacked by some warriors.]]\nMixtec writing originated as a pictographic system during the Post-Classic period in Mesoamerican history.  Records of genealogy, historic events, and myths are found in the pre-Columbian Mixtec codices.  The arrival of Europeans in 1520 CE caused changes in form, style, and the function of the Mixtec writings.  Today these codices and other Mixtec writings are used as a source of ethnographic, linguistic, and historical information for scholars, and help to preserve the identity of the Mixtec people as migration and globalization introduce new cultural influences.\nThe site\nThe archaeological site includes two sets of terraces, arranged in the slope of a hill. The first set has platforms with slopped walls, stairway, hydraulic system and stands with carved numerals. The second group is integrated by two platforms, formed by rectangular structures with slopped walls and stucco remains. In addition to these groups, there are several tombs and mounds not yet explored.\nStructures\nThe main structures of this group are oriented to the west and include: a large square platform, with a central plaza and knolls in three sides; a large terrace or Plaza 2 with an altar; and a ballgame court I shaped, 70 meters long. The explorations in the residential zones produced findings of tombs and burials with ceramics and other offerings.\nThere are five main sets at the site, each with several structures.\nCerro Volado\nThis group is formed by two large plazas with a mound in the center; others of smaller size are dispersed in the plazas.\nPantheon Group\nThe group is located to the foot of the \"Cerro Volado\" and has four low platforms around a patio.\nOld Church\nThe group is made up by two badly damaged platforms, with a housing area located between this group and the Pantheon.\nThe Church Group is the largest; it is a hill terrace east of the center of the municipality, with old constructions in its slopes and on which a modern-day church was built with stones removed from the ancient constructions, these can be seen embedded in its walls with visible carved characters.\nWestern Group\nThe group west of the Church has several platforms constructed at different levels.\nRegional communication\nRegional communications in ancient Mesoamerica are believed to have been extensive. There were various trade routes attested since prehistoric times.\nScholars have long identified a number of similarities between the ancient Guatemalan and Mexican art styles and cultures. These similarities start as far north as the Mexico Central Plateau and continue to the Pacific coast and as far as Central America. There are many common elements in iconography, stone sculptures and artefacts. All this led to the investigation of possible trade patterns and communication networks.\nIt is certain this route played a critical role in the political and economic development of southern Mesoamerica, although its importance varied over time. There was material and information trade between the Mexico Central Plateau, the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.\nSee also\n* Mixtec Culture\n* Yucuita\n* San José Mogote\n* Cerro de las Minas\n* Izapa\n* Guerrero\n* Oaxaca\n* Chiapas\n* Chalcatzingo\n* Oxtotitlán\n* Juxtlahuaca\n* Teopantecuanitlan\n* Costa Chica\n* Mazatán, Chiapas\n* Comitán\n* Chiapa de Corzo\n* Tapanatepec\n* Tonalá\n* Pijijiapan\n* Chiautla\n* Huamuxtitlán\n* Tlapa\n* Ometepec\nIn Guatemala:\n* Tak´alik Ab´aj,\n* Bilbao\n* Huehuetenango\n* Quetzaltenango\n* Chimaltenango\n* Mixco Viejo\n* Retalhuleu\n* Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa\n* Escuintla\nIn El Salvador:\n* Chalchuapa\n* El Salvador\nIn Nicaragua:\n* Ometepe\n* Zapatera\nNotes\nReferences\n* Acuña, René. 1984 Relaciones geográficas del siglo XVI: Antequera, Tomos Segundo y Tercero.
