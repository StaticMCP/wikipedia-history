Visveshwaraya Stn., Central College is an underground metro station on the East-West corridor of the Purple Line of Namma Metro in Bengaluru, India. This metro station was opened to the public on 30 April 2016.\nThe station acquires its name from the nearby University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, which had been named after M. Visvesvaraya, an Indian engineer, scholar, statesman and the Diwan of Mysore from 1912 to 1918.\nHistory\nThe Sir M. Visveshwaraya metro station, like all other underground stations on the Purple Line, was built using the cut-and-cover method. The station is located at a depth of 60 feet. Authorities carried out 1,200 controlled blasts to dig through the tough rock structure.\nStation layout\n| legend = track\n| collapsible = no\n| map = HSTg\\HSTf\nPSTR(L)\\PSTR(R) ~~ ~~ ~~ to\n*P1\\PSTR(L)\\PSTR(R)\\*P2\nPSTR(L)\\PSTR(R) ~~ ~~ ~~ to\nHSTg\\HSTf\n| bottom = Station with two tracks and one Island platform\n}}}}\n{|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=30 valign=top|G\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=85 valign=top|Street level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=500 valign=top|Exit/Entrance\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|M\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Mezzanine\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Fare control, station agent, Ticket/token, shops\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=30 rowspan=3 valign=top|P\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px white;\" width=85|Platform 1Eastbound\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px white;\" width=500|Towards → Next station:\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform | Doors will open on the right\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=85|Platform 2Westbound\n| style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=\"500\" |Towards ← Next station: Change at the next station for\n|}\nEntry/Exits\nThere are 5 Entry/Exit points – A, B, C, D and E.
