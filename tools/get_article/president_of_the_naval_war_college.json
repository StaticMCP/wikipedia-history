The President's House in Newport, Rhode Island is their official residence.\nThe functions of the president of the Naval War College actually predate the establishment of the institution. As Commandant of the Newport Naval Station and then as Commodore of the Atlantic Squadron, Stephen B. Luce established enlisted education and training with the Apprentice School along the shores of the Narragansett Bay. Luce had earlier delivered lectures on naval strategy and command from the facilities of the Naval Torpedo Station on Goat Island before he spearheaded efforts to procure the building and surrounding grounds on Coaster's Harbor Island, which still stands as the location of the Naval War College. The office of the president was formally created along with the Naval War College as a whole by U.S. Navy General Order 325, signed by Secretary of the Navy William E. Chandler on 6 October 1884. The order stipulated that a commissioned officer of the Navy no lower in grade than commander be in charge of the college and that that officers title be \"president.\" It also directed that the president be presiding officer of a board consisting of the president and all of the colleges faculty and responsible for determining the professional course of study for students at the college.\nGeneral Order 325 identified the colleges first president as Commodore Stephen B. Luce, who took office on the day Chandler signed the order. The last captain to serve as president left the position in 1913, after which all presidents have been flag officers. Since 1948, all presidents of the Naval War College have been vice admirals or rear admirals.\nWhile college activities were suspended during the Spanish–American War, the presidency was vacant. When activities were again suspended during World War I, and during periods since World War I between the departure of an outgoing president and the arrival of a successor, acting presidents have administered the college until a new president reported for duty.\nThe college counts individuals who serve more than once as president as a separate president for each tour for purposes of chronological numbering of the presidents. Acting presidents are not counted.\nThe presidency of the Naval War College is one of only four positions in the United States Navy which has an official portrait associated with it, the others being the secretary of the Navy, the chief of naval operations, and the superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. The Naval War College Museum holds in its collection the official portraits of all but ten of the presidents, including all presidents since 1939.\nPresidents\nPresidents of the Naval War College in chronological order.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n!\n!Rank\n!Name\n!Photo\n!Term Began\n!Term ended\n!Highlights of Term\n|-\n|1\n|Rear Admiral\n|Stephen Luce\n|\n|6 October 1884\n|22 June 1886\n|Founder of and driving force behind the Naval War College; \"Intellectual Leader of the New Steel Navy\"; saw the college as the highest level of professional naval education and \"place of original research on war ... statesmanship connected with war, or the prevention of war.\"\n|-\n|2\n|Captain\n|Alfred Thayer Mahan\n|\n|22 June 1886\n|12 January 1889\n|First of two terms as president. His 1886 and 1887 lectures at the college formed the basis of his internationally influential 1890 naval strategy book The Influence of Sea Power Upon History: 1660–1783. Mahan was suddenly reassigned from duty at the Naval War College, as efforts to close the institution unfolded in Washington.\n|-\n|3\n|Captain\n|Caspar F. Goodrich\n|\n|12 January 1889\n|22 July 1892\n|Through the efforts of Luce and other supporters, Goodrich supervised the construction of the colleges first purpose-built building which was later to be christened, Luce Hall. During his first of two tours as President of the Naval War College, Goodrich also worked in close conjunction with the General Board of the Navy to synthesize the curriculum with operational innovation in an era of transition from wooden-hulled to steel armored warships, submarines, and automotive torpedoes. Goodrich also helped organize undersea salvage and mine warfare organizations at this time.\n|-\n|4\n|Captain\n|Alfred Thayer Mahan\n|\n|22 July 1892\n|10 May 1893\n|The first person to serve a second term as college president. His 1892 lectures at the college formed the basis of his two-volume 1892 naval strategy book The Influence of Sea Power Upon the French Revolution and Empire: 1793–1812.\n|-\n|5\n|Commander\n|Charles Herbert Stockton\n|\n|10 May 1893\n|13 November 1893\n|First of two terms as college president. Although the Department of the Navy authorized no course at the college in 1893, he and the college's other two staff members prepared one anyway. Discussed the possible closure of the college with Bowman H. McCalla, who in turn wrote to Lieutenant Benjamin H, Buckingham, the commanding officer of the gunboat , which was scheduled to transport Secretary of the Navy Hilary A. Herbert to Newport in August 1893. Herbert planned to close the college during the visit, but changed his mind after Buckingham gave him Mahan's The Influence of Sea Power Upon the French Revolution and Empire: 1793–1812 to read.\n|-\n|6\n|Captain\n|Henry Clay Taylor\n|\n|15 November 1893\n|31 December 1896\n|Established the curriculum the college would use until 1919; made wargaming part of the curriculum and established the use of case studies in studying international law.\n|-\n|7\n|Captain\n|Caspar F. Goodrich\n|\n|31 December 1896\n|23 April 1898\n|Second of two terms as college president. Led the colleges advocacy of advanced rational contingency planning. During this period, Goodrich also hosted the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt. In 1897, Roosevelt delivered a speech to the Naval War College to articulate a vision for the future of American sea power, which he later characterized under the title, \"Our Navy, The Peacemaker.\"\n|- style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||22 March 1898\n||2 November 1898\n||Naval War College served as a venue for the General Board of the Navy to meet during the Spanish–American War.\n|-\n|8\n|Captain\n|Charles Herbert Stockton\n|\n|2 November 1898\n|25 October 1900\n|Second of two terms as college president. Defended the college against attempts to sabotage it by collocating it with the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Argued against Bureau of Navigation insistence that it had no officers to detail to the college for the 1899 course, responding that \"There is no more important duty on shore, except the absolutely essential professional administrative work, than the study of naval warfare,\" and circumvented the Bureau's opposition by arranging with the commander of the North Atlantic Squadron, Rear Admiral William T. Sampson, for Sampson's ships to spend the summer of 1899 anchored off Newport while their officers took the course.\n|-\n|9\n|Rear Admiral\n|French Ensor Chadwick\n|\n|25 October 1900\n|16 November 1903\n|Oversaw the 1901 introduction of battle problems to be wargamed and studied as part of the curriculum and the 1901 publication of the first Naval War College \"blue book\" on international law. Became first occupant of the President's House in June 1903.\n|-\n|10\n|Captain\n|Charles S. Sperry\n|\n|16 November 1903\n|24 May 1906\n|Developed an extensive knowledge of international law. To emphasize the professional character of the college rather than its function as a school, ordered in 1904 that when describing the college's academic activities, the words \"course\" and \"class\" were to be dropped and the term \"conference\" was to be used instead. Oversaw the opening of the college's new library (now Mahan Hall) in 1904 and the appointment of the college's first librarian in 1905.\n|-\n|11\n|Rear Admiral\n|John Porter Merrell\n|\n|24 May 1906\n|6 October 1909\n|1908 summer course suspended by direction of President Theodore Roosevelt on 8 July 1908 so that the General Board of the United States Navy, the bureau chiefs of the United States Department of the Navy, and the colleges staff and students could participate in a \"Battleship Conference\" at the college, with Roosevelt himself visiting to chair the conference for a day on 22 July 1908. Otherwise, Merrell chaired the conference. Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf closed the conference on 1 September 1908.\n|-\n|12\n|Rear Admiral\n|Raymond Perry Rodgers\n|\n|6 October 1909\n|20 November 1911\n|Acting on a suggestion by Captain William Ledyard Rodgers – who had learned it at the United States Army War College – Raymond P. Rodgers introduced the \"applicatory system\" or \"estimate of the situation\" into Navy war planning, requiring that planning be developed through a four-step process involving \"statement of mission, assessment of enemy forces and intentions, assessment of own forces, and evaluation of possible courses of action.\" The first edition of the college pamphlet Estimate of the Situation published under his direction in 1910 to teach the applicatory system to students. Established a 16-month \"long course\" to complement the four-month summer course at the college and allow sufficient time for in-depth study. Tended to favor more cautious approaches in planning for war with Japan. In 1911, Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer removed war planning functions from the college, placing all planning responsibilities in the more aggressive General Board of the United States Navy.\n|-\n|13\n|Captain\n|William Ledyard Rodgers\n|\n|20 November 1911\n|15 December 1913\n|Described the goal of his presidency as to broaden \"the scope of the work to include studies of national policy as the foundation for laying out naval plans of expansion and also of logistics, organization, and administration of navies as the basis of strategy and tactics of battle.\" Second edition of the college pamphlet Estimate of the Situation published under his direction in 1911–1912. In 1913, instituted a three-course plan of instruction, consisting of a two-week elementary course, followed by a four-month preparatory course and then the long course instituted by Raymond P Rodgers but renamed the \"War College Course.\" Introduced an option of taking the elementary course as a correspondence course to ease the detailing of officers to the college. Under his presidency, the college issued its first diplomas in 1913. Last non-flag officer to serve as college president, and the only president after 1906 who was not provided with the use of the President's House for his living quarters.\n|-\n|14\n|Rear Admiral\n|Austin Melvin Knight\n|\n|15 December 1913\n|16 February 1917\n|Oversaw the abolition of the elementary and preparatory courses and the replacement of the 16-month \"long course\" with a 12-month \"long course.\" Doubted the battle readiness of the fleet, viewing the Navy as operating at only 50 percent of efficiency, and advocated that \"every effort of the fleet and every effort of the department [i.e., the United States Department of the Navy] in connection with the fleet should have for its sole aim the war efficiency of the fleet. Every effort which does not directly contribute to this end is in itself a wasteful expenditure of energy, and so far as it is a diversion from this end, is distinctly harmful.\" Also criticized the U.S. Navy, the United States Congress, and the American public as a whole for \"asking, not what do we need for efficiency? but what can we afford to spend for efficiency?”\" Encouraged the discussion of topics of international law and the effects of World War I on that law. Third edition of the college pamphlet Estimate of the Situation published under his direction in 1915.\n|-\n|15\n|Rear Admiral\n|William S. Sims\n|\n|16 February 1917\n|28 April 1917\n|First of two terms as college president. Sent secretly to the United Kingdom in late March 1917 to discuss cooperation between the Royal Navy and United States Navy in the event of the entry of the United States into World War I.\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|–\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|–\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|–\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|–\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|28 April 1917\n|10 April 1919\n| style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"|Naval War College served as a venue for supporting coastal defense planning and maritime strategy during World War I; notably Imperial Russian Navy Admiral Alexandr Kolchak met with the Commander Rufus Z. Johnson, USN, and the staff at the Naval War College during planning efforts to support operations on the European front in the First World War. This work later served as the basis for American expeditionary operations into Siberia during the Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war. Among other administrators presiding at the college: Commander (ret.) Charles P. Eaton, 1 May 1917 – 21 November 1917; Commodore (ret.) James P. Parker, 21 November 1917 – 17 March 1919; and Captain Reginald R. Belknap, 17 March 1919 – 11 April 1919.\n|-\n|16\n|Rear Admiral\n|William S. Sims\n|\n|11 April 1919\n|14 October 1922\n|Having remained in the billet as college president while serving the temporary duty as commander, U.S. Naval Forces in Europe between 1917 and 1919, Sims requested orders to return to Newport. He fell out of step with the secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, and the CNO, Admiral William S. Benson, during the so-called \"Battle of Paris\" which culminated in the Treaty of Versailles, but Sims still held the confidence of the assistant secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt. Returning to Newport, Sims arrived from Europe in four-star rank, but assumed two-stars upon resuming his presidency at the Naval War College. In this role, Sims recognized opportunities to learn from the experience of the First World War and, to this end, Sims drew from the ideas of Sir Julian Corbett. Sims established a \"Historical Section\" under his chief of staff for strategy, Captain Dudley W. Knox, and his former intelligence officers, reserve lieutenants Tracy Barrett Kittredge and Philip Whelpley in 1919.  In addition, Sims joined efforts with Admiral Henry T. Mayo on the General Board of the Navy to sponsor the naval education board, which was composed of Knox, Captain Ernest J. King, and Commander William S. Pye. Using his position as President of the Naval War College, Sims championed efforts to reorganize the navy and make the war college a prerequisite for promotion to higher command. As a result, Sims again stood at odds of Navy Secretary Daniels. Seeking to learn from mistakes of the past, Sims openly challenged the propaganda narrative of Daniels by criticizing American naval performance in the First World War. His views appeared between the lines of his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1920 memoir The Victory at Sea. Sims also influenced the views articulated in the foreword by Rear Admiral Bradley Fiske in Tracy Barrett Kittredge's critique of Daniels, as published in the original documentary compilation Naval Lessons of the Great War. .\n|- style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||14 October 1922\n||3 November 1922\n||Captain DeWitt Blamer served as acting president between the departure of Sims and the arrival of Williams.\n|-\n|17\n|Rear Admiral\n|Clarence Stewart Williams\n|\n|3 November 1922\n|5 September 1925\n|Oversaw establishment of the Junior Course, which in the 1950s would be renamed the Command and Staff Course.

Championed the use of statistics in the study of fleet tactics and established a research department for statistical studies at the college. Demanded \"hard, perceptive, and innovate thinking\" by students, but warned students that most of them did not achieve this because they appeared to view thinking about warfare as being complete by the time of their arrival at the college and limited themselves to \"rehash[ing] the obvious\" in their theses.

Continued the advocacy for the college he had displayed in his first term and oversaw the colleges 1942 production of Sound Military Decision. As a collateral duty, Kalbfus assumed duty as Director of Naval History by the direction of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Ernest J. King, in June of 1942. In this role, Kalbfus fused the efforts of the Historical Section of retired Captain Dudley W. Knox to synthesize the educational and research functions of the Naval War College strategic analysis functions of the Office of Naval Intelligence World War II. Kalbfus worked in close conjunction with his relief, Vice Admiral William S. Pye, to infuse historical analysis with wartime intelligence functions. At the recommendations of Kalbfus and Pye, the Combat Intelligence Division within the headquarters of Admiral King also materialized in the spring of 1943. The following year, Kalbfus established the Office of Naval History as a coequal function to the Office of Naval Intelligence and War Plans Division. His deputy, Knox, coincidentally received promotion to the wartime rank of commodore on the retired list. Together, Kalbfus and Knox also drove a subscription campaign in conjunction with the Naval Historical Foundation to fund a portrait of Alfred Thayer Mahan.\n|-\n|25\n|Vice Admiral\n|William S. Pye\n|\n|2 November 1942\n|1 March 1946\n| Served as Naval War College President during the World War II years. During his tenure, the college conducted abbreviated courses that trained officers in the practical requirements for duty on a staff or in command while serving at sea or with the shore establishment. In March 1944, United States Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox appointed Pye to head a board of officers – referred to as the \"Pye Board\" – to study naval professional military education; it recommended, among other things, that the Navy establish three levels of officer education at the college and vastly increase the number of officers attending the college. The Navy approved little of what the Pye Board recommended, but a subsequent board headed by Rear Admiral James L. Holloway, Jr., took into account the work of the Pye Board. Pye remained on active service on the retired list as a vice admiral while assisting the development of the Army-Navy Staff College (ANSCOL) at the Naval War College. Foreign naval officers from the Allied navies also completed the ANSCOL curriculum during the war.\nThe renowned maritime historian, Dr. Robert G. Albion, and Commodore Dudley W. Knox also provided lectures and advisory support to Pye as the Naval War College directly supported the functions of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral King. Having been the key architect of the Combat Intelligence Division within King's headquarters, Pye built upon the precedence set by the Historical Section in the Sims era and the functions of the Office of Naval History to organize what became the Battle Studies Group.  Pye relinquished command upon the arrival of four-star Admiral Raymond A. Spruance on 1 March 1946.\n|-\n|26\n|Admiral\n|Raymond A. Spruance\n|\n|1 March 1946\n|1 July 1948\n|Assigned while awaiting promotion to five-star rank, which failed to materialize due to the unification debates ongoing in Congress, which later culminated in the so-called 'Revolt of the Admirals' and the subsequent suicide of the former Navy Secretary - Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. Placing an emphasis on the practical importance of education for naval professionals, Spruance expanded the curriculum; established academic chairs for a distinguished civilian historian and a political scientist. Among others, Samuel Eliot Morison and Robert G. Albion frequently participated in college activities, as did retired Commodore Dudley W. Knox. Spruance also set administrative foundations for what would become the Naval War College Press and Naval War College Review\n|- style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||1 July 1948\n||1 November 1948\n||Rear Admiral Allen Edward Smith served as acting president between the departure of Spruance and the arrival of Beary.\n|-\n|27\n|Vice Admiral\n|Donald B. Beary\n|\n|1 November 1948\n|28 May 1950\n|Building upon experience as the chief architect of the Antisubmarine University system in World War II, Beary fused the functions of the Office of Naval History with those of the Naval War College to foster Global Strategy Discussions of the 1950s and Current Strategy Forum. In addition, Beary solicited funding from the retired five-star admirals to establish chairs in their names for the college to host scholars and enliven debates within the classroom setting of the Naval War College. Beary specifically dedicated these reforms to Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King in the 1949 booklet Prospectus of the Naval War College.\n|- style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||28 May 1950\n||1 December 1950\n||The college had two acting presidents – Rear Admiral Thomas R. Cooley from 28 May 1950 to 17 October 1950 and Captain Harry D.

Conolly\n|\n|1 December 1950\n|2 November 1953\n|Made major reforms to allow the college to build on the insights gained during World War II, and restored the civilian academic chairs of history and political science originally created by Spruance. When the Chief of Naval Operations dissolved the Office of Naval History in 1952, Conolly responded by soliciting Fleet Admirals Ernest J. King, Chester W. Nimitz, William D. Leahy, and William F. Halsey, Jr.  Retired admirals Kalbfus and Pye also operated in conjunction with Commodore Knox and the Naval Historical Foundation to assist efforts in the formal establishment of became the King Chair of Maritime History, the Nimitz Chair of Political Economy, the Leahy Chair of Diplomacy, and the Halsey Chair of Naval Strategy and Command. In addition, Conolly championed efforts to write legislation under Title 10 to empower the Secretary of the Navy to appoint civilian scholars under the provisions of Excepted Service at the recommendation of the president of the Naval War College.\n|- style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||2 November 1953\n||3 May 1954\n||Rear Admiral Thomas H. Robbins served as acting president between the departure of Conolly and the arrival of McCormick.

McCormick\n|\n|3 May 1954\n|16 August 1956\n|Having qualified in submarines in the First World War era, McCormick served as to the staff of Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King as assistant chief of naval operations for logistics plans, with additional duty as chairman of the Joint Logistics Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Second World War. He assisted efforts to implement reconstruction during the initial stages of occupation in Japan and through the initial stages of the Chinese Civil War. McCormick then served in four-star rank as the global commander of antisubmarine forces before assuming duty as Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet. From this experience, McCormick continued efforts to synthesize the Naval War College curriculum with global reconstruction strategy by working in close conjunction with Retired Rear Admiral Henry Eccles to educate senior-ranking officers of foreign navies. To these ends, McCormick used the newly concluded provisions of Title 10 to enact the Excepted Service appointments of civilian scholars. While civilians had served at the Naval War College in the commissioned naval rank of professor before the establishment of the Department of Defense in 1947, the provisions articulated in the newly ratified legal provisions under Title 10 of U.S. Code enabled McCormick to make the first Excepted Service appointments under his delegated authority in 1954. McCormick's tenure proved truly significant, although he became the first Naval War College president to die in office.\n|- style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||16 August 1956\n||5 September 1956\n||Rear Admiral Thomas H.

Harley\n|\n|25 July 2016\n|10 June 2019\n|Rear Admiral Jeffrey Harley focused on fixing problems of Professional Military Education (PME) as a leading advisor to the Secretary of the Navy's \"Education for Seapower\" vision. He simultaneously emphasized the Chief of Naval Operations directive to fix administrative problems within the Naval War College. During his three-year tenure in Newport, Harley coordinated efforts to advance the future of Professional Military Education (PME), as articulated in the Secretary of the Navy's \"Education for Sea Power\" and the Chief of Naval Operations \"Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority.\"  Coincident with the transition from the Global War on Terror to global maritime stabilization operations, Harley's efforts at the Naval War College focused upon what he called, \"navalizing,\" international and joint discussions of policy, strategy, and command. He organized a new future-focused curriculum for cyber and space education. Harley also took particular interest in the writings of his previous Naval War College presidents in an ongoing effort to synthesize the past with contemporary discussions of future strategy and command.  In particular, the historical works Mahan and Sims became a focus of his effort to reorganize the functions of the Naval War College archives and museum to support original historical research with an applied focus on issues of immediate concern to contemporary fleet practitioners.  Inspired by the example of Sims and the \"Historical Section\" of the Naval War College of the 1920s and 1930s, Harley considered history to be an \"operational function\" which enabled the formulation of current plans, or what he called an \"unclassified way of coordinating intelligence with a strategic end in mind.\"  Harley was the first president to host a member of the Japanese royal family when Princess Akikko of Mikasa visited for research collaboration with historians at the Naval War College.  Harley also concluded formal agreements for continued historical collaborations with the Japanese Self-Defense Force, Royal Australian Navy, and the War Studies Department at King's College London in conjunction with the Corbett 100 global historical initiatives.  Through these efforts, Harley fostered global collaboration and future fleet requirements through ongoing operational collaborations with foreign navies and the CNO International Fellows Program.  At CNO direction, Harley established the International Maritime Staff Officers Course. The CNO, Admiral John Richardson, formally highlighted these achievements after Harley's retirement after nearly forty years on active service. Having earlier served as an enlisted sailor, Harley commanded multiple warships and then earned the Bronze Star Medal for his service in combat and in multinational operations at sea and ashore. After he attained flag rank, Harley served as Officer in Charge of the White House Situation Room. Harley's tenure at the Naval War College inspired his effort to complete doctoral studies in history.  Following his retirement, Harley earned his PhD in Politics and International Affairs from the University of Reading in 2021 and also served as a Senior Fellow at the Center of Maritime Security.\n|- style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||–\n||10 June 2019\n||1 August 2019\n||Provost Lewis Duncan served as acting president between the departure of Harley and the arrival of Chatfield.\n|- style=\"background:#e6e6aa;\"\n|-\n|57\n|Rear Admiral\n|Shoshana S. Chatfield\n|\n|1 August 2019\n|23 June 2023\n|The 57th President of the Naval War College, Rear Admiral Shoshana S. Chatfield completed an extended four-year tenure during a period of significant uncertainty as punctuated by the 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19).  Chatfield earned her wings as a Naval Aviator and completed multiple squadron tours with deployments to the western Pacific and greater Middle East regions.  Her service ashore included assignments to the Joint Staff, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and then in an educational capacity at the U.S. Air Force Academy.  Having earned her master's degree at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University while ashore, she also subsequently earned Education Doctorate (Ed.D) at the University of San Diego.  Promoted to flag rank in 2015, Chatfield commanded Joint Region Marianas in Guam before reporting as the first woman to serve as President of the Naval War College in 2019.  Chatfield managed the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, using cybernetic means for sustained operations in the virtual classroom setting.  Chatfield also drove efforts to foster a shared understanding of the complex and dynamic global security environment through examination of women’s influence and experience as stakeholders and catalysts of change alongside men in conjunction with the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) initiatives.  Given infrastructure and building maintenance priorities, Chatfield closed the institution's archives and associated historical collections to enable construction projects to proceed on the National Historic District of Coaster's Harbor Island in 2020.  Chatfield also focused upon modernization and infrastructure improvements for the facilities on and around the Naval War College campus.  As the COVID-19 pandemic subsided during her closing months in office, Chatfield then refocused efforts to expand global strategic partnerships and the expansion of NATO following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  Chatfield's subsequent nomination for promotion to the rank of vice admiral also coincided with her assignment to serve as representative to the NATO Military Committee in 2023.\n|-\n|58\n|Rear Admiral\n|Peter A.
