Only the first volume covering material prior to the Norman Conquest was printed in 1848 by G. E. Eyre & W. Spottiswoode for Her Majesty.  It was reprinted by Gregg Publishing in March 1971 ().\nPetrie drafted the proposal to include all the references to Britain in the Greek and Roman writers, as well as general histories and annals.\nIn 1823 the Record Commission, predecessor to the Public Record Office, gave the task to Henry Petrie.  The work was suspended in 1835 by order of the commissioners, after Petrie had prepared the first volume and had started work on the second, \"due to a misunderstanding between them and Petrie.\"  Petrie died in 1842.  The first volume was posthumously published by Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, Petrie's successor.\nVolume I.
