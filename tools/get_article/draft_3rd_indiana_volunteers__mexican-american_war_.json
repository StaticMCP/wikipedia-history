Polk's call for volunteers on May 22, 1846 by issuing a proclamation for Indiana to form volunteer companies of infantry which would aid the growing volunteer force headed to Mexico. The 3rd Indiana Volunteers were organized during the summer of 1846. The regiment consisted of the following companies when it was mustered into service on June 25, 1846:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Original Organization of Regiment in 1846:\n!Company\n!Earliest Moniker\n!Primary Place of Recruitment\n!Earliest Captain\n|-\n|A\n|The Monroe Guards\n|Monroe County\n|John Martin Sluss\n|-\n|B\n|The Washington Guards\n|Washington  County\n|William Ford\n|-\n|C\n|The Johnson Guards\n|Johnson County\n|David Allen\n|-\n|D\n|The Switzerland Rifles or\nThe Switzerland Riflemen\n|Switzerland  County\n|Scott Carter\n|-\n|E\n|The Brown County Blues\n|Brown County\n|James Taggart Jr.\n|-\n|F\n|The Bartholomew Volunteers\n|Bartholomew  County\n|Isaac Boardman\n|-\n|G\n|The Madison Rifles\n|Madison County\n|Thomas L.

Perry, Jim Lane was elected as the original Colonel of the regiment when the unit was mustered into federal service, however, Lane resigned from the position before he even had the chance to command the regiment. Lane's appointed successor was Stanislaus Lasselle (also spelled as LaSalle), the son of General Hyacinth Lasselle (1777-1843), a veteran of the War of 1812 and one of the founders of Terre Haute, Indiana. Lasselle had previously served in the 1st Indiana Volunteers as the Captain of Company G and served under Lieutenant Colonel Henry Smith Lane.\nService\nDuring the Battle of Buena Vista the 2nd Indiana Volunteers and the 3rd Indiana Volunteers contributed heavily to the battle alongside troops of Jefferson Davis's Mississippi Rifles. Edward Deering Mansfield states the following in his book The Mexican War: a History of its Origin, and a Detailed Account of the Victories:\"The Third Indiana regiment, under Colonel Lane, and a fragment of the Second, under Colonel Bowles, were associated with the Mississippi regiment during the greater portion of the day, and acquitted themselves creditably in repulsing the attempts of the enemy to break that portion of our line\".Buena Vista was the 3rd Indiana's only battle during the course of the war. The regiment stayed in Mexico for the remainder of the war until it was sent back to New Orleans and was later mustered out of service in Indiana on May 25, 1847. Many veterans of the 3rd Indiana Volunteers later joined the 4th Indiana Volunteers under Colonel Willis A. Gorman and continued to fight in the war until 1848 with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Others joined the 5th Indiana Volunteers under Colonel Lane, but were never deployed in combat while in Mexico.\nCommanders\n* Jim Lane: May 1846: Resigned\n* Stanislaus Lasselle: May 1846–May 1847.\nNotable people\n* Stanislaus Lasselle (LaSalle): Served as the commander of the regiment during its deployment to Mexico.\n* Willis A.
