Ballet Theatre is based in Brisbane in the Australian state of Queensland.\nHistory\nPredating both the Australian Ballet and the Queensland Ballet, Ballet Theatre of Queensland was established by Phyllis Danaher to bring dance on a regular basis to people in Queensland. Prior to its inception, ballet had only been presented by touring companies such as that of the famous Russian ballerina, Anna Pavlova on an irregular basis. Danaher was determined to change this state of affairs and to provide opportunities for talented Queenslanders to shine in this area of the performing arts. Today the company founded by Danaher continues to present full-scale productions every year at the Playhouse, Queensland Performing Arts Centre, South Bank, Queensland.\nMany wonderful artists have acted as Artistic Director over the years including from 2002 until 2011, Jodie-Anne White and Boris Bivona. Following White's death in 2012 they were succeeded by Timothy Brown and Libby McDonnell,\n}}"
