Incumbent President Elpidio Quirino won a full term as President of the Philippines after the death of President Manuel Roxas in 1948. His running mate, Senator Fernando Lopez, won as Vice President.  Despite factions created in the administration party, Quirino won a satisfactory vote from the public. It was the only time in Philippine history where the duly elected president, vice president and senators all came from the same party, the Liberal Party.\nFraud and violence was prevalent during the election. Carlos P. Romulo and Marvin M. Gray, publisher of the Manila Evening News, accuse Quirino in their book The Magsaysay Story of widespread fraud and intimidation of the opposition by military action, calling it the \"dirty election\".\nCriticism of the election\nThe election was widely criticized as being corrupt, with violence and fraud taking place. Opponents of Quirino were either beaten up or murdered by his supporters or the police, and the election continues to be perceived as corrupt.\nResults\nPresident\n|50.93}}\n|37.22}}\n}}\nVice-President\n|51.67}}\n|35.14}}\n}}\nSee also\n*Commission on Elections\n*Politics of the Philippines\n*Philippine elections\n*President of the Philippines\n*2nd Congress of the Philippines\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070824115409/http://www.pangulo.ph/election_results.php The Philippine Presidency Project]\n* [http://www.comelec.gov.ph Official website of the Commission on Elections]"
