      "text": "# Threekingham Bar\n\nThreekingham Bar is the name given to  interception of the A52 (Grantham to Boston) and A15 (Peterborough to Lincoln and Hull) roads,  to the west of the village of Threekingham, in Lincolnshire, England\nThe interception is arranged as a small modern roundabout.  Both roads are single carriageway.  The countryside is undulating, and the A52 descends into a valley to the west.  The location is rural, with no human habitation.\nThe name dates it to the turnpike era. The A52 approximately follows the route of Salters Way.\nAn 18th-century mile post is in the verge,  south from the roundabout.\nSee also\n*List of road junctions in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
