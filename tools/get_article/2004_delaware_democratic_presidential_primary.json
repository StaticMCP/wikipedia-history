Frontrunner John Kerry easily won the primary while Senator Joe Lieberman came second.\nAs the primary approached Joe Lieberman said that victory in the Delaware primary was required in order for his campaign to continue. He had visited the state four times and got the endorsement of Democratic senator Thomas R. Carper. After his defeat in the primary Lieberman withdrew from the race for the nomination.\nExit polls showed that over half of voters who took part in the primary said they were 'angry' with the administration of George W. Bush and over 80% said they opposed the decision to go to war with Iraq.\nPolling\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
