The area is renowned for its ancient temples, rock-cut caves, and association with Hindu mythology and pilgrimage traditions.\nGeography and location\nThe Bateshwar Hills are situated approximately 10&nbsp;km from Kahalgaon and about 6&nbsp;km from Kursela, on the banks of the Ganges River, close to the confluence with the Kosi River. In this region, the Ganga flows northward, a phenomenon called Uttarvahini Ganga, considered highly auspicious.\nThe hills are part of the Rajmahal volcanic system, composed mainly of basaltic rocks.\nHistory\nLocal legends state that the Vedic sage Brahmarshi Vashishtha performed penance at Bateshwar, establishing a Shivlinga. The main temple, Bateshwar Nath Mahadev, was built around the 7th century and renovated during the 12th century by rulers of the Sena dynasty.\nThe site is sometimes called Gupta Kashi (\"Hidden Kashi\") due to its spiritual importance.\nArchitecture\nThe Bateshwar Nath Temple is dedicated to Shiva and houses eleven Shivlings, referred to as Ekadash Mahadev. There is also a rare idol of Ardhanarishwara, symbolizing the combined form of Shiva and Parvati.\nNearby, ancient rock-cut caves like Patalpuri are found, containing sculptures and inscriptions dating back to the Pala and Sena periods.\nReligious significance\nBateshwar Hills are a major pilgrimage site, especially during the Hindu month of Shravan (July–August), attracting thousands of devotees. Devotees perform Jalabhishek rituals, offering holy water from the Ganges to the Shivlings.\nThe proximity of Bateshwar to Vikramashila Mahavihara, an ancient Buddhist monastic university, highlights the syncretic spiritual traditions of the region.\nAccessibility\nThe Bateshwar Hills can be reached by road via Kahalgaon  which have railway stations on the Sahibganj Loop Line. The nearest airport is Jay Prakash Narayan Airport in Patna, approximately 285&nbsp;km away.\nTo reach the temples, visitors must ascend around 100 rock-cut steps carved into the hillside.\nConservation\nThe Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has identified Bateshwar Hills as a site of archaeological and religious importance, with preservation efforts underway.\nLocal authorities and NGOs have also taken steps to improve visitor amenities and preserve the natural environment.\nSee also\n* Vikramashila Mahavihara\n* Uttarvahini Ganga\n* Kahalgaon\n* Kursela\n* Rajmahal Hills\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://tourism.bihar.gov.in/ Bihar Tourism Official Website]\n* [https://asi.nic.in/ Archaeological Survey of India]"
