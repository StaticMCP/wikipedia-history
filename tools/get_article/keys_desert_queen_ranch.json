Bill Keys was the area's leading character, and his ranch is a symbol of the resourcefulness of early settlers. The ranch is an extensive complex of small frame buildings built between 1910 and Keys' death in 1969. Keys pursued both ranching and mining to make a living in the desert.\nWilliam Franklin Keys was born at Palisade, Nebraska, in 1879. After working as a ranch hand and smelter worker, he was a deputy sheriff in Mohave County, Arizona. During a time in Death Valley, he befriended Death Valley Scotty, becoming involved in a swindle that resulted in the so-called \"Battle of Wingate Pass\". He arrived in the Twentynine Palms, California area in 1910. In the area that became Joshua Tree National Park, he became acquainted with local outlaw and cattle rustler Jim McHaney, taking care of him in declining health. Keys eventually took over McHaney's properties after McHaney's death, gradually expanding what became the Desert Queen, its name borrowed from the nearby Desert Queen Mine.\nKeys married Francis M. Lawton in 1918, and they had seven children together, three of whom died and were buried at the ranch. During a dispute over the Wall Street Mill, Keys shot and killed Worth Bagley.  Keys was convicted of murder and went to San Quentin Prison, where Keys educated himself in the library.  Keys was paroled in 1950 and was pardoned in 1956 through the efforts of Erle Stanley Gardner, author of the Perry Mason novels.\nMining equipment at the ranch includes an arrastra and a stamp mill for ore processing. Other buildings include an adobe barn, a schoolhouse, a tack shed, machine shed, cemetery and a variety of houses and cabins.\nPark rangers provide guided walking tours of the ranch from October through May.  Tours are limited in size and must be booked in advance.\nGallery\nFile:Desert_Queen_Ranch_-_school_house_2.jpg|School house\nFile:Keys Ranch guest house.jpg|Guest house\nFile:Desert_Queen_Ranch_-_gold_mill.jpg|Oxen pulled mill used to crush ore during gold extraction\nFile:Desert_Queen_Ranch_-_Closed_Area_sign.jpg|Closed area no trespassing sign\nFile:Desert_Queen_Ranch_-_crane.jpg|Flood control wall and crane used to build it\nFile:Desert_Queen_Ranch_-_Fordson_1.jpg|Fordson tractor detail\nFile:Desert_Queen_Ranch_-_Fordson_2.jpg|Fordson tractor attached to circular saw\nFile:Desert_Queen_Ranch_-_Willy's_Jeep.jpg|Willys Jeep\nSee also\n*Cow Camp, Jim McHaney's outlaw camp\n*Wall Street Mill\n*Barker Dam\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nps.gov/jotr/planyourvisit/ranchtour.htm Keys Ranch Guided Walking Tour] - official site at Joshua Tree National Park\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080210055908/http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/65keys/65keys.htm Keys Ranch: Where Time Stood Still] - National Park Service historic lesson article\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*[http://www.desertusa.com/mag00/sep/stories/dsrtq.html Desert USA article about Keys Desert Queen Ranch]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121218140903/http://360photo.net/desertqueenranch/ Digital Desert 360 immersive image of the Desert Queen Ranch]"
