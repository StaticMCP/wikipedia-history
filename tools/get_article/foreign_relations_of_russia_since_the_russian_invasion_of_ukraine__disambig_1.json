The Russian government has a specified \"Unfriendly Countries List\" which indicates those countries with which relations are now strained (or non-existent). A Foreign Policy Concept approved by president Vladimir Putin in 2023 identified Russia as a Eurasian civilization state; aligning the country more closely with Asia, the Islamic world, Africa, Latin America, and the rest of the Global South. Russia is also seeking the end of the Western hegemony in the international order.\nEurope\nPositive relations\nAbkhazia\nPresident Aslan Bzhaniya stated that Russia's invasion was \"absolutely justified.\"\nArtsakh\nPresident of Artsakh Arayik Harutyunyan welcomed Russia's declaration of the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. The Artsakh government sent 14 tons of humanitarian aid to the residents of the Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia regions.\nAzerbaijan\nAzerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev expressed his support for territorial integrity of Ukraine, and urged his Ukrainian counterparts to \"never to agree to the violation of your territorial integrity\".

President Alexander Lukashenko stated that Belarusian troops could take part in the invasion if needed. Belarus stated that Russia could bring its nuclear weapons onto Belarusian soil. In March 2022, Oleksandr Kamyshin, head of Ukrainian Railways, said that the railway connection between Ukraine and Belarus had closed, so Russian equipment from Belarus could not be delivered. On 25 March 2023, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would station tactical nuclear operations in Belarus.\nSerbia\nWhile condemning the invasion, Serbia refused to back sanctions against Russia. Serbia did not impose sanctions. Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić said the National Security Council concluded the Republic of Serbia considers \"very wrong the violation of territorial integrity of a number of countries including Ukraine.\" Vučić also said that he would condemn Russia's recognition of the independence of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine only if Zelenskyy condemned the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 on public television.\nSerbian Foreign Minister Nikola Selaković said that \"Russia was Serbia's biggest support in its battle to preserve its territorial integrity and sovereignty and avoid the stigmatisation of the entire Serb people.\" Serbian Interior Minister Aleksandar Vulin stressed that Serbia would not join NATO: \"While Aleksandar Vučić is the head of the state, you should have no dilemma as to what our attitude toward the NATO alliance is.\" Serbia expressed regrets over events, describing both Russia and Ukraine as friendly states and underlining full support for the Ukraine's territorial integrity. The initial weak response by the government was criticised by some commentators in the country and the region.\nThe Serbian organization Women in Black organised anti-war demonstrations in Belgrade, and the Serbian Orthodox Church organised a collection of humanitarian aid.\nOn 2 March Serbia voted 'yes' to the UN's resolution condemning the Russian attack on Ukraine.\nOn 16 May Serbia signed the \"Tirana declaration\" and deplored in the strongest terms the illegal and unjustified aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine in violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nThe Economist classified Serbia as \"neutral\".\nSouth Ossetia\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement: \"The Republic of South Ossetia expresses its support for the decision of the Russian Federation to conduct the special military operation to protect the residents of Donbas from the current nationalist regime of Kyiv.\" On 26 March 2022, South Ossetian President Anatoly Bibilov began sending troops to Ukraine to assist Russia with the invasion.\nTransnistria }}\nOn 26 February, President Vadim Krasnoselsky, asserted that Transnistria was a peaceful state and never had plans to attack its neighbours. Krasnoselski noted the large ethnically Ukrainian population in Transnistria and that Ukrainian is taught in Transnistrian schools and is one of its official languages.\nOther relations\nArmenia\nThe Armenian MFA spokesman on 23 February expressed \"hope that the existing problems between the two friendly states would be resolved through diplomatic dialogue\", and declared Armenia's readiness to accept refugees. On 1 June 2023, during an interview, prime minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan stated, \"Armenia is not an ally of Russia in the war in Ukraine.\"\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nTripartite Presidency Member Željko Komšić said Bosnia would support Ukraine. Croat and Bosniak members of the tripartite presidency, Željko Komšić and Šefik Džaferović, issued separate statements condemning the Russian invasion. The Serb member Milorad Dodik did not, instead stating that Bosnia and Herzegovina was neutral. He'd said the previous day that events showed it was good that Bosnia and Herzegovina had not joined NATO, and that the country would not support sanctions. Foreign Minister Bisera Turković said: \"Bosnia and Herzegovina remains firmly committed to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and we call for an immediate end to fighting and shelling! OSCE principles, security and international law are under attack today. Hostility and suffering of innocent civilians must end immediately\". Turković called on Russia and Belarus to refrain from using force in the interests of peace, and regional and global stability.\nDodik repeatedly visited Russia, including attending Eastern Economic Summit.\nHungary\nPrime Minister Victor Orban had made strong arguments related to NATO expansion to the East, and stated that Ukraine never could join either EU nor NATO.

Slovakia provided Ukraine with an S-300 air defense system.\nTurkey\nOn 3 February 2022, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan volunteered to organize a Ukraine-Russia conference during a visit to Ukraine, as EU leaders increased outreach to the Kremlin to calm worries of a Russian invasion. On 24 February, Erdoğan expressed his support for Ukraine. On 25 February, on the other hand, the Republic of Turkey abstained from voting on Russia's suspension from the Council of Europe, instead calling for open dialogue between the parties under any circumstances. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated Turkey's \"readiness to host negotiations that could take place between the Russian Federation and Ukraine\".\nOn 27 February 2022, Cavusoglu shifted its terminology to refer to Russia's assault on Ukraine as a \"war,\" and committed to enforce elements of the 1936 Montreux Convention's international pact that allowed Turkey to prohibit all warships of the belligerent forces, including those of the Russian navy, from entering the Bosporus and Dardanelles and thus hinder Russian vessels' transit from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. On 28 February, Erdoğan confirmed that the straits would be closed to prevent escalation, while pledging to maintain relations with both Ukraine and Russia. On 10 March, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Dmytro Kuleba met in Antalya in Turkey, the first high-level contact between the two sides since the invasion. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also participated. Mr Cavusoglu said the aim of the diplomatic meeting was \"to pave the way,\" for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, which would be facilitated by Turkey's president.\nTurkey actively participated in mediation efforts.

The Pope called for 2 March, Ash Wednesday, to be a day of prayer and fasting for peace. In an unprecedented departure from diplomatic protocol, the Pope went to the Russian embassy on 25 February to relay his concern.\nThe Pope said to Russian youth, \"Never forget your heritage. You are the descendants of great Russia: the great Russia of saints, rulers, the great Russia of Peter I, Catherine II, that empire – educated, great culture and great humanity. Never give up on this heritage.\" This comment was received negatively by the government of Ukraine.\nStrained relations\nEuropean Union\nThe EU launch a group of sanctions against Russia, which added all EU countries to the list of \"unfriendly nations\".\nAlbania\nIn mid February 2022, Lavrov accused Albania and two other Balkan countries of sending mercenaries to the Donbass conflict in Ukraine.

There were no casualties as its staff had evacuated the building.\nIn mid March, Albania and five other countries at the UN Security Council accused Russia of war crimes. In Albania, President Meta, Foreign Minister Xhaçka and the Speaker of Parliament Lindita Nikolla all condemned Russia for the Bucha massacre and called for an international response and independent investigation.
