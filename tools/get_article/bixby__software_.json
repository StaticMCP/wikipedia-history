It uses voice commands and a natural-language user interface to answer questions and perform tasks, while adapting to the users' preferences and behavior.\nSamsung first launched Bixby in 2017. Along with Bixby voice assistant, its other main component currently is Bixby Vision, a contextual and visual search augmented reality camera app. Formerly, the Bixby suite consisted of a number of other tools but these have since been renamed, such as Bixby Routines (now Modes and Routines).\nHistory\nOn 20 March 2017, Samsung announced the voice-powered digital assistant named \"Bixby\" as a replacement of the S Voice assistant. It was introduced alongside the Galaxy S8 and S8+ and the Galaxy Tab A (2017) during the Galaxy Unpacked 2017 event; although released for these devices, it could also be sideloaded on older Galaxy devices running Android Nougat. A while before the phone's release, the Bixby Button was reprogrammable and could be set to open other applications or assistants, such as Google Assistant. However, near the phone's release, this ability was removed with a firmware update, but can be remapped using third-party apps.\nBixby in Korean was launched on 1 May 2017 (KST). Bixby Voice was intended to be made available in the US later that spring, however, the release of the English version was postponed as Samsung had problems getting Bixby to fully understand the language. The English version was finally rolled out in July 2017 and later that year followed by a Chinese language version.\nIn October 2017, Samsung announced the release of Bixby 2.0 during its annual developer conference in San Francisco. The new version was rolled out across the company's line of connected products, including smartphones, TVs, and refrigerators. Also, third parties are allowed to develop applications for Bixby using the Samsung Developer Kit. Bixby 3.0 was released with One UI 3 at the start of 2021. With version 3.0, Home and Reminders features were separated from Bixby.\nIn 2019, UX developers at Samsung said their intention to use the AR Emoji avatar as a personified Bixby assistant.\nIn June 2021, screenshots surfaced for what some thought as a replacement for Bixby. The three-dimensional virtual assistant, Sam, was popular on social media though it was not intended as a replacement for Bixby.\nBixby launched for Microsoft Windows in October 2021 with distribution through the Microsoft Store. This version of Bixby is optimized for Samsung's Galaxy Book computers and may not function on non-Samsung systems.\nSamsung launched an AI Bixby custom voice creator in 2023 allowing users to record their own voice commands.\nMost recently, in July 2024, Samsung confirmed that it plans to launch an upgraded version of Bixby later this year. This new Bixby would be powered by Samsung's proprietary large language model (LLM) technology, promising a significant boost to Bixby's capabilities with the help of generative AI.\nIn January 2025 with the announcement of Galaxy S25 and the One UI 7 update, Bixby is no longer the default voice assistant now replaced in role by Google Gemini. Despite this, Bixby still continues to be developed and expanded by Samsung, and was revamped at the same time with new AI capabilites. Also, Samsung brought the \"smarter\" Bixby to Samsung televisions, allowing users to speak to their TV sets and also control their homes using it.\nA visual refresh planned for One UI 8.5.\nFunctionality\nresponding to a query]]\nBixby is a voice assistant that can get tailored information about the weather, reminders of meetings, news articles, and others using artificial intelligence. It can learn individual voices, so it can personalize its answers.\nBixby itself was also formerly called Bixby Voice to differentiate from other Bixby tools in the suite.\nBixby Vision\nBixby Vision is an augmented-reality camera that can identify objects in real-time and potentially offer the user to purchase them online, translate text, read QR codes, and recognize landmarks.\nIt comes pre-installed on Samsung Galaxy phones. It is considered to be the imaging component of Bixby.\nFormer Bixby tools\nBixby Home was a vertically scrolling home screen with a list of information that Bixby could interact with, for example weather, fitness activity and buttons for controlling their smart home gadgets. It was renamed \"Samsung Daily\" on One UI 2.1 released in 2020, then in One UI 3.0 Samsung Daily itself was replaced by a new app called \"Samsung Free\" (some countries instead use the name \"Samsung O\"), which has more recently been discontinued. Samsung News is now its replacement and functions as a news aggregator with the option of home screen swipe integration similar to Bixby Home did.\nBixby Routines is a feature that automates tasks by creating custom rules based on specific triggers, such as the time of day or the user's location. As of the release of One UI 5.0, the feature is now renamed to \"Modes and Routines\".\nBixby Text Call is a handsfree call answer feature introduced with One UI 5.0 in 2022. It is found in the settings of the Phone app. It is now named simply \"Text call\".\nBixby Touch is a tool that makes recommendations based on intelligent recognition. The user can access services such as translation, online shopping, and media by touching the screen.\nBixby Global Action, Bixby Dictation and Bixby Wakeup are other older apps.\nRegions and languages\nAs of April 2018, Bixby is available in over 195 countries, but only in Korean, English (American), and Chinese (Mandarin). The limitation is that the models not intended for the Japanese market, like S10e, are not allowed to login to Bixby services from Japan; therefore Bixby becomes blocked. The choice of languages has since expanded: Samsung has deployed Bixby's voice command function in French, and on 20 February 2019 Samsung announced the addition of further languages: English (British), German, Italian and Spanish (Spain). On 22 February 2020, Samsung announced the addition of Portuguese (Brazil), for Galaxy S10 & Note10, in Beta, and later for other models.\nCompatible devices\nFlagship series\n* Galaxy S series: All models since Galaxy S7\n* Galaxy Tab S: All models since Galaxy Tab S4\n* Galaxy Note: All models since Galaxy Note FE and Galaxy Note 8\n* Galaxy Z series: All models\nOther series\n;Galaxy A\n*Galaxy A6/A6+ (Bixby Home, Reminder and Vision)\n*Galaxy A7 (2017) (available to users in South Korea only; Bixby Home and Reminder only)\n*Galaxy A7 (2018) (Bixby Home, Reminder and Vision only)\n*Galaxy A8 (2018) (including A8 Star; Bixby Home, Reminder and Vision only; S Voice used instead)\n*Galaxy A8s (Bixby Home, Reminder and Vision only)\n*Galaxy A9 (2018)/A9s/A9 Star Pro (including A9 Star and A9 Star Lite; Bixby Home, Reminder and Vision only; S Voice used instead)\n*Galaxy A9 Pro (2019) (Bixby Home, Reminder and Vision only)\n*Galaxy A20 (Bixby Home and Service)\n*Galaxy A21s\n*Galaxy A30s (Bixby Home, Vision, Reminder and Routines)\n*Galaxy A40 (Bixby Home and Reminder)\n*Galaxy A41 (Bixby Home, Vision, Routines and Reminder)\n*Galaxy A50 (Bixby Home, Voice, Vision, Reminder and Routines)\n*Galaxy A50s (Bixby Home, Voice, Vision, Reminder and Routines)\n*Galaxy A51\n*Galaxy A52\n*Galaxy A52s\n*Galaxy A53 5G\n*Galaxy A70 (Bixby Home, Voice, Vision and Reminder)\n*Galaxy A70s (Bixby Home, Voice, Vision and Reminder)\n*Galaxy A71\n*Galaxy A72\n*Galaxy A73 5G\n*Galaxy A80 (Bixby Home, Voice, Vision, Reminder and Routines)\n*Galaxy A34 5G\n*Galaxy A54 5G\n*Galaxy A35 5G\n*Galaxy A55 5G\n*Galaxy A36 5G\n*Galaxy A56 5G\n;Galaxy M\n*Galaxy M35 5G\n*Galaxy M36 5G\n;Galaxy F\n*Galaxy F62\n;Galaxy Tab A\n*Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2016) (Bixby Home)\n*Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2017) (Bixby Home and Reminder only)\n*Galaxy Tab A 10.5 (2018) (Bixby Home, Reminder and Vision)\n;Galaxy J\n* Galaxy J4 (2018) (Bixby Home)\n* Galaxy J7+ (2017)\n* Galaxy J6 (2018) (Bixby Vision, Bixby Home and Bixby Reminders)\n* Galaxy J6+ (2018)\n;Galaxy C\n*Galaxy C8 (Bixby Home, Reminder and Bixby Vision only)\nGalaxy XCover\n* Galaxy XCover Pro\nLaptops\n* Galaxy Book series: Models released from May 2021 onwards\nSee also\n* List of chatbots\n* Alexa\n* Alice\n* Clova\n* Cortana\n* Evi\n* Google Lens\n* Haptik\n* Siri\n* S Voice\n* Viv (software)\nNotes\nReferences"
