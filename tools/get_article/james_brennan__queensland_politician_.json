He was educated in Paisley and he arrived in Australia sometime before 1864 and took up mining at Gympie. He was an employee at the Queensland Meat Export and Agriculture Co. in Brisbane and Townsville, and from 1902 was the manager at the Lake's Creek Meatworks in Rockhampton.\nHe was married to Margaret Mills Dale (d.1931) and died at Wooloowin in Brisbane in June 1917. His funeral proceeded from his Miles Street, Wooloowin residence to the Lutwyche Cemetery.\nPublic life\nBrennan, a Kidstonite, won the seat of Rockhampton North at the by-election held in 1907 to replace the sitting member, Henry Turner, who had been appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council. Brennan held it until 1912 when the seat was abolished. He stood for the new seat of Keppel that year but was defeated.\nReferences"
