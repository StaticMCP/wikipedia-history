It was formed in March 1918 and was still in existence at the end of the war.\nChronicle\nThe 68th Corps (z.b.V.) was established in March 1918.  Previously, it had been known as Nordkorps.\nWith the onset of trench warfare, the German Army recognised that it was no longer possible to maintain the traditional Corps unit, that is, one made up of two divisions.  Whereas at some times (and in some places) a Corps of two divisions was sufficient, at other times 5 or 6 divisions were necessary.  Therefore, under the Hindenburg regime (from summer 1916), new Corps headquarters were created without organic divisions.  These new Corps were designated\nGeneral Commands for Special Use ().\n68th Corps was still in existence at the end of the war.\nCommanders\nThe 68th Corps was commanded throughout its existence by Generalleutnant Adolf von Seckendorff.\nSee also\n*German Army (German Empire)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
