The ceremony was held live on September 17, 2018, at the Microsoft Theater in Downtown Los Angeles, California, where 26 awards were presented, and was broadcast in the U.S. by NBC. The ceremony was hosted by Michael Che and Colin Jost.\nThe nominations were announced by Ryan Eggold and Samira Wiley on July 12, 2018. The biggest winner of the night was Amazon Prime Video's comedy-drama The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, which won five trophies, including the honor for Outstanding Comedy Series, making history by becoming the first streaming television series to claim the prize. Game of Thrones also won its third trophy for Outstanding Drama Series, and Peter Dinklage tied for the most wins for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, with his third victory for Game of Thrones. He would get the sole record by winning for the eighth and final season the very next year.\nWith a U.S. viewership of 10.2&nbsp;million that reflects an 11% drop from the previous year, it was the then-least watched show in Emmy history. It was also the first time in the show's history that Modern Family was not nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series after eight successive nominations and a record five wins from 2010 to 2014.\nThe three wins of John Legend, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Tim Rice made them the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth persons to become an EGOT (at the creative arts ceremony).\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (‡).
