Initially, Mahissati  (Sanskrit Mahishamati)  was the capital of  southern Avanti, and Ujjaini (Sanskrit Ujjayini) was of northern Avanti,  but at the  times of Mahavira and  Buddha,  Ujjaini was the capital of  integrated Avanti.  The country of Avanti roughly corresponded to modern Malwa, Nimar and adjoining parts of the Madhya Pradesh.\nBoth Mahishmati and Ujjaini stood on the southern high road called  Dakshinapatha extending from Rajagriha to Pratishthana (modern Paithan).  Avanti was an important center of Buddhism and some of the leading theras and theris were born and resided there.  King Nandivardhana of Avanti was defeated by king Shishunaga of Magadha. Avanti later became part of Magadhan empire.\nMahabharata\nAncient India\nAvanti kingdom is mentioned in the list of kingdoms in ancient India (Bharata Varsha) :- ...the Kuntis, the Avantis, and the further-Kuntis; the Gomantas, the Mandakas, the Shandas, the Vidarbhas, the Rupavahikas; the Aswakas, the Pansurashtras, the Gopa rashtras, and the Karityas; the Adhirajyas, the Kuladyas, the Malla rashtras, the Keralas, the Varatrasyas, the Apavahas, the Chakras, the Vakratapas, the Sakas; the Videhas, the Magadhas.... (6,9)\nAvanti a rich kingdom\nSurrounding the kingdom of the Kurus, are, many countries beautiful and abounding in corn, such as Panchala, Chedi, Matsya, Surasena, Pattachchara, Dasarna, Navarashtra, Malla, Salva, Yugandhara, Saurashtra, Avanti, and the spacious Kuntirashtra. (4,1).\nAvanti was well connected by ancient highways\nWords of Nishadha king Nala to his wife Damayanti of Vidarbha Kingdom.\nThese many roads lead to the southern country, passing by (the city of) Avanti and the Rikshavat mountains. This is that mighty mountain called Vindhya; yon, the river Payasvini running seawards, and yonder are the asylums of the ascetics, furnished with various fruit and roots.  This road leadeth to the country of the Vidarbhas —and that, to the country of the Kosalas. Beyond these roads to the south is the southern country. (3,61)\nSahadeva's conquests\nAllying himself with the vanquished tribes the Pandava Sahadeva then marched towards the countries that lay on the banks of the Narmada. And defeating there in battle the two heroic kings of Avanti, called Vinda and Anuvinda, supported by a mighty host, the mighty son of the twin gods exacted much wealth from them. After this the hero marched towards the town of Bhojakata. (2,30)\nKarna's conquests\nThen going to Shishupala's son, the son of the Suta defeated him and that highly powerful one also brought under his sway all the neighbouring rulers. And having subjugated the Avantis and concluded peace with them, and having met with the Vrishnis, he conquered the west. (3,252)\nVasudeva Krishna's conquests\nThe Avantis, the Southerners, the Mountaineers, the Daserakas, the Kasmirakas, the Aurasikas, the Pisachas, the Samudgalas, the Kamvojas, the Vatadhanas, the Cholas, the Pandyas, O Sanjaya, the Trigartas, the Malavas, the Daradas difficult of being vanquished, the Khasas arrived from diverse realms, as also the Sakas, and the Yavanas with followers, were all vanquished by Vasudeva Krishna (7,11)\nAvanti king in Yudhishthira's Rajasuya\nThe king of Avanti, stood in service of the Pandava king Yudhishthira with diverse kinds of water for the final bath, during the Rajasuya sacrifice.\nAvanti kings allied with the Kauravas in Kurukshetra War\nThe two kings of Avanti (Vinda and Anuvinda), accompanied by a mighty force, brought to Duryodhana, each a separate Akshauhini of troops, for the Kurukshetra War. (5,19)\nThey were considered as the best among the Kaurava heroes as per Duryodhana's words:- Those, however, amongst us, that are our chief warriors, are Bhishma, Drona, Kripa, Drona's son, Karna, Somadatta, Vahlika, and Salya, the king of Pragjyotisha, the two kings (Vindha and Anuvinda) of Avanti, and Jayadratha; and then, O king, thy sons Dussasana, Durmukha, Dussaha, Srutayu; Chitrasena, Purumitra, Vivingsati, Sala, Bhurisravas, and Vikarna. (5,55) (5,66) (5,198)\nRating by Bhishma:- Vinda and Anuvinda of Avanti are both regarded as excellent Rathas. These two heroes among men will consume the troops of thy foes, with maces and bearded darts, and swords and long shafts, and javelins hurled from their hands. Like a couple of (elephant) leaders sporting in the midst of their herds, these two princes longing for battle, will range the field, each like Yama himself.
