It was formerly placed in the genus Accipiter.\nIt is endemic to Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and Buton. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and to a lesser degree lowland forests. It closely resembles the fellow Wallacean vinous-breasted sparrowhawk, but is still thought to be most closely related to besra. All this makes it rather difficult to identify and thus possibly under-recorded. It is one of the smallest members of its family (length approximately 25&nbsp;cm/10in). Hunts insects and small birds.\nIt is threatened by habitat loss. There are not many verified recordings of this species, but it is known to occur at least in Lore Lindu National Park.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Dwarf Sparrowhawk\n\n#REDIRECT Dwarf sparrowhawk\n}}"
