Not only did the song later receive a remix with feature guest appearances from fellow American rappers Saweetie and Trina, but the remix would be featured on her extended play (EP), titled Hit the Latto (2019). The success of the remix led her to sign a record deal with RCA Records in early 2020. Following her signing a record deal after its release of the remix, the single peaked at number 95 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming a certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Within a day prior to the album's announcement, it was revealed that Latto would be included on XXLs Freshman Class of 2020.\nOn August 12, 2020, Latto went on her social media accounts to announce the release of her debut studio album, titled Queen of da Souf, while revealing the album cover artwork, alongside the release date. Three days later, Latto revealed the track listing for the album, but replaced all unknown guest appearances with emojis, opting for her fans to guess the features. Latto revealed the features on August 19, which includes the rap duo City Girls and Georgian-native rapper 21 Savage.\nSingles\nThe album's lead single, \"Bitch from da Souf\" was released in January 2019 and became Latto's breakout hit. The remix version, featuring Saweetie and Trina, was released on December 4, 2019.\n\"Muwop\", featuring Gucci Mane, was released on July 30, 2020, as the album's official second single after Latto recreated Mane's album covers on her social media. The song samples Mane's 2007 single \"Freaky Gurl\" and was released alongside its music video. The single was serviced to US Rhythmic radio on August 25, 2020.\nThe album's third single, \"On God\", had a music video released on Lyrical Lemonade's YouTube account on September 10, 2020.\n\"In n Out\", featuring American rap duo City Girls, was released as the album's fourth single and received a music video which was released on October 15, 2020.\n\"Sex Lies\", featuring Lil Baby, was released as the first single from the extended version of the album and the fifth overall. A music video was premiered on December 11, 2020.\nPromotional singles\nHer first song, titled \"No Hook\", was first released as the album's first single, but instead was its promotional single on April 23, 2020. The song was Latto's first official release since announcing that she had signed to RCA Records and was released alongside its music video. \"No Hook\" tells Latto's come up story to stardom in a single verse, hence the title. The second song, titled \"He Say She Say\", was released alongside a \"quarantine style\" music video as the album's second promotional single in May 2020.\nOther songs\nThe music video for the opening track, \"Youngest and Richest\", was premiered on the release date of the album. A music video for the extended version album track, \"Spend It\", was released on December 22, 2020. The video portrays Latto going to a local Walmart and purchasing essential items for the community.\nMusic and lyrics\nAccording to the BrooklynVegan, \"Queen of da Souf is full of sex-positive anthems that are overflowing with charisma and confidence\". On \"Muwop\", Latto \"twists Gucci Mane’s 2006 hit, “Freaky Gurl” with a feminine flare.\" On \"No Hook\", she \"bravely talks about her pregnancy scares, her terrible relationships, and her rough come-up\". On \"Bitch from da Souf Remix\", the rappers \"trade off and spit bars representative of their respective hometowns–Atlanta, Miami and the Bay Area.\"\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Ratings Game Music\n| rev2score = C\n}}\nFred Thomas of AllMusic rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars. He commented that it \"taps into the same irrepressible swagger and irreverent charm of Latto's runaway hits \"No Hook,\" and \"B*tch from Da Souf\" and pads out the material with plentiful features from established artists.\" Quincy of Ratings Game Music gave the album a C rating. He wrote that \"Mulatto has a bright future and the aura of someone that can end up being one of the greats.\"\nMichael Penn of VMP wrote that Latto shows her versatility by adjusting to featuring artists' styles and choosing beats that suit her attitude. Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork criticized the album, which \"is held back by production that seems like it was chosen by someone who hasn't listened to Atlanta rap in at least half a decade.\"\nYear-end lists\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Publication\n!List\n!Rank\n!Ref.\n|-\n|Genius\n|50 Best Albums of 2020\n|46\n|\n|-\n|The Source\n|20 Best Hip-hop Albums of 2020\n|\n|\n|}\nTrack listing\n| total_length = 31:24\n| title_width   = 40%\n| writing_width = 60%\n| title1        = Youngest and Richest\n| writer1       =\n| length1       = 1:45\n| title2        = Muwop\n| note2         = featuring Gucci Mane\n| writer2       =\n| length2       = 3:20\n| title3        = In n Out\n| note3         = featuring City Girls\n| writer3       =\n| length3       = 3:15\n| title4        = He Say She Say\n| writer4       =\n| length4       = 2:25\n| title5        = Pull Up\n| note5         = featuring 21 Savage\n| writer5       =\n| length5       = 2:36\n| title6        = Toya Turnup Talks (Skit)\n| writer6       =\n| length6       = 0:36\n| title7        = On God\n| writer7       =\n| length7       = 1:53\n| title8        = Look Back at It\n| writer8       =\n| length8       = 2:47\n| title9        = No Hook\n| writer9       =\n| length9       = 1:43\n| title10      = Off Top\n| note10       = featuring 42 Dugg\n| writer10     =\n| length10     = 2:16\n| title11      = My Body\n| writer11     =\n| length11     = 2:58\n| title12      = Blame Me\n| writer12     =\n| length12     = 2:06\n| title13      = Bitch from da Souf\n| note13       = Remix) (featuring Saweetie and Trina\n| writer13     =\n| length13     = 3:44\n}}\n| title_width   = 40%\n| writing_width = 60%\n| title14       = Queen\n| writer14      =\n| length14      = 2:16\n| title15       = Sex Lies\n| note15        = featuring Lil Baby\n| writer15      =\n| length15      = 2:42\n| title16       = Step It Up\n| writer16      =\n| length16      = 2:41\n| title17       = Stank\n| writer17      =\n| length17      = 2:30\n| title18       = Spend It\n| writer18      =\n| length18      = 2:32\n}}\nPersonnel\n* Bankroll Got It – production (1, 5–7, 13, 18)\n* Boadray – production (2, 6, 9, 13)\n* Diego Ave – production (5–7, 18)\n* Mark Bankhead, Jr. – production (4, 9)\n* RTJ – production (4, 9)\n* Hitmaka – production (5, 10)\n* BricksDaMane – production (8, 12)\n* Pooh Beatz – production (8, 15, 17)\n* Johnny Dutra – production (3, 14)\n* IAmXayy – production (8, 17)\n* J.
