The party has headquarters in Albany, Buffalo, and New York City. The purpose of the committee is to nominate Republican candidates for election to New York and federal political roles. It also assists its nominees in their election campaigns.\nHistory\nThe New York Republican State Committee was established in 1855, one year after the founding of the \"Republican Party\" by William H. Seward and Thurlow Weed. Initially, the committee met every three years to plan the Republican National Convention and it occasionally met during the election campaigning periods. The committee nominees were first politically successful in 1856. Since 1959, Nelson Rockefeller (1959–1973) and George Pataki (1995–2006) have been the only two elected Republican governors of New York.\nUntil 1911, the New York Republican State Committee nominated its candidates through a primary or caucus system, which meant the average voter had very little input as to who would be their choice for the state and federal offices. That system was taken out of practice after the passing of the Direct Primary Law in 1911, which allowed for more input from those present at the primary.\nOrganization\n{|class=wikitable\n!

Every two years, in each county, Republicans elect a \"Republican County Committee\". The chair of each county committee is the face of the Republican Party in that county. New York also has 150 Assembly districts. Republicans elect one male and one female leader in each district. The district leaders form part of the executive committee of the respective county committee. The chair and the executive committee seek new party members; control local finances; find candidates to run for public office and choose the nominee (unless both candidates have petitioned enough signatures to trigger a primary).\nSeveral of these counties are notable due to their high population, and impact on national politics. These include:\n*The Bronx Republican Party\n*The Manhattan Republican Party\n*Queens County Republican Party\n*Kings County Republican Party\n*Staten Island Republican Party\nNiagara County Republican Committee\nState committee\nThe New York State Republican State Committee is composed of one male and one female representative from each Assembly District. Before each statewide election, the committee organises a party convention and chooses candidates for offices of the state. 60% of the committee's vote is needed to win the party's nomination. If no candidate wins 60% of the committee's vote, the candidates with more than 25 percent of the committee's vote compete in a \"primary\" which is held in the month of September. A candidate with less than 25 percent of the committee's vote may compete in the \"primary\" if they have a petition of support of greater than 15000 voters.\nThe State Committee also elects one National Committeewoman and one National Committeeman to represent the state committee to the Republican National Committee in Washington, D.C. The current National Committee members are Jennifer Saul, a Republican fundraiser and former chairwoman of the New York County Republican Committee, and Lawrence Kadish, a  real estate developer from downstate New York.\nCurrent elected officials\nThe New York Republican Party holds 22 out of the 63 seats in the New York State Senate and seven of the state's 26 U.S. House seats.\nMembers of Congress\nU.S. Senate\n* None\nBoth of New York's U.S. Senate seats have been held by Democrats since 1999. Al D'Amato was the last Republican to represent New York in the U.S. Senate. First elected in 1980, D'Amato lost his bid for a fourth term in 1998 to Chuck Schumer who has held the seat since.\nU.S. House of Representatives\nOut of the 26 seats New York is apportioned in the U.S. House of Representatives, seven are held by Republicans:\n* NY-01: Nick LaLota\n* NY-02: Andrew Garbarino\n* NY-11: Nicole Malliotakis\n* NY-17: Mike Lawler\n* NY-21: Elise Stefanik\n* NY-23: Nick Langworthy\n* NY-24: Claudia Tenney\nState legislative leaders\nNew York State Senate\n* Rob Ortt: Minority Leader\n* Andrew Lanza: Deputy Minority Leader\n* Patty Ritchie: Chair of the Senate Minority Conference\n* Sue Serino: Vice Chair of the Senate Minority Conference\n* Patrick Gallivan: Minority Whip\n* Joseph Griffo: Assistant Minority Leader\nNew York State Assembly\n* William A.
