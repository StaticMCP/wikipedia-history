In 1970 he presented the weekday morning regional opt-outs from the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 called This is East Anglia.\nIn 1968 Edwards also started working for BBC Radio 1 initially replacing Simon Dee on Midday Spin, later becoming a staff announcer and newsreader on both Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2.\nDuring the 1970s he presented a number of Radio 2 programmes including the weekday and Saturday Early Show, Night Ride, Music Through Midnight, Radio 2 Ballroom and shows featuring the BBC Radio Orchestra.\nEdwards was an in-vision announcer for Thames Television for most of the 1980s, also working for ATV and HTV West. He worked on BBC Radio Norfolk in the 1990s. After recovering from alcoholism, his friend Bob Monkhouse gave him a job as the voiceover artist on the game show Wipeout in the late 1990s.\nIn 2009, Edwards and David Clayton, editor of BBC Radio Norfolk, compiled an hour-long story of his life titled Edwards the Confessor.\nPersonal life and death\nEdwards lived in the village of Heckington in Lincolnshire for nearly 30 years and moved to Lincoln shortly before his death to be nearer to medical facilities.\nHis autobiography, \"Is Anybody There\" was published by Kaleidoscope on 8 December 2018. Edwards used to open his radio show by knocking on the microphone three times and saying: \"Is anybody there?\" During an interview to promote the book, he said, \"My book is a turbulent read but I hope you enjoy it and you can join me on a journey that took me here, there and just about everywhere.\"\nThe book highlights his varied career as a DJ in pirate and commercial radio, as a TV broadcaster working for the BBC and several other TV companies, as well as a period in Hollywood. The book also delves into Edwards' personal battle with alcohol and drug addiction, which he successfully overcame after spending three years in a rehabilitation centre in Lincolnshire.\nEdwards died in a hospice in Lincoln in October 2025, aged 80, after a long battle with cancer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.tom-edwards.co.uk/ Official Tom Edwards Website]\n*"
