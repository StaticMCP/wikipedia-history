Lisa Henderson from Clash magazine called the album as \"an irresistible piece of steamy electro-soul\" and gave the album an 8 out of 10, while Kitty Empire from The Observer called it \"danceable, but not braindead\". Writing for NOW Magazine, Paula Reid gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, saying, \"Andy and James stepped deeper into their own sound, with more inventive lyrics and dynamic melodies.\" Reid also noted the 1970s and 1980s soul and funk influences in the album. The Guardian gave a mixed review of the album, saying, \"a studied sort of soul that belongs more in a Spotify aggregated playlist than on a sleazy late-night radio show.\"\nLiam McNeilly from DIY Magazine gave the album 2 out of 5 stars, saying, \"Honne’s debut could be a triumph, but finds itself prone to mumbling and shallowness.\"\nCommercial performance\nWarm on a Cold Night made its debut in United Kingdom at number thirty-seven.
