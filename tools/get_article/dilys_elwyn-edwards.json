She attended Dr Williams' School for Girls, a grammar school which educated girls ages 7–18 from 1878 to 1975. She was offered the Turle Music Scholarship at Girton College, Cambridge and the Dr. Joseph Parry Scholarship, from Cardiff University. She elected to study at Cardiff and received her BMus degree. She taught music at her old school, Dr Williams', Dolgellau, for the next three years. She then received the Open Scholarship in Composition from the Royal College of Music in London and studied composition with Herbert Howells and piano with Kathleen McQuitty there.\nShe married David Elwyn Edwards, a Methodist minister and theological scholar, in 1947. She moved to Oxford while her husband attended Mansfield College. She taught music from 1946 to 1972.\nIn the 1960s they moved back to Wales, where Elwyn became minister for the Calvinist Methodist chapel in Castle Square, Caernarfon. In 1973 she became a piano tutor at Bangor Normal College and Bangor University in North Wales, where she proved to be a popular, effective and much-respected teacher of the instrument. She was also an Eisteddfod adjudicator, and appeared and performed on radio and television. The BBC commissioned a number of works from her. She died on 13 January 2012, in a nursing home at Llanberis, Gwynedd, aged 93.\nMusic\nShe was known for her soft, melodic art songs (Lied) for voice in both Welsh and English. Charlotte Church and Aled Jones have recorded Caneuon y Tri Aderyn (Three Welsh Bird Songs; 1962): Y Gylfinir (The Curlew), Tylluanod (Owls), and her most famous song, Mae Hiraeth yn y Môr (There is longing in the sea, R. Williams Parry's sonnet set to music). This work was commissioned by the BBC in 1961 for the Welsh tenor Kenneth Bowen. Bryn Terfel recorded in 2004 on his DG CD \"Silent Noon\" The Cloths of Heaven/ Gwisg Nefoedd by Elwyn-Edwards (with text by W.B.
