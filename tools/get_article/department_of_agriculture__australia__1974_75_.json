This was in fact the case; the department's name was changed at the specific request for Senator Wriedt when he became Minister of the Department—intended to recognise practice overseas and in most of Australia's states.\nStructure\nThe department was an Australian Public Service department, staffed by officials who were responsible to the Minister for Agriculture.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
