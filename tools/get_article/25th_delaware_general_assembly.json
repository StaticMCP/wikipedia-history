Elections were held the first Tuesday of October and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. The Assembly met in the state capital, Dover, convening January 6, 1801, two weeks before the beginning of the third year of the administration of Governor Richard Bassett. He resigned February 20, 1801, and James Sykes completed his term.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Federalist majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*James Sykes, Kent County\nHouse of Representatives\n*Stephen Lewis, Kent County\nMembers\nSenate\nSenators were elected by the public for a three-year term, one third posted each year.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*John Bird\n*Thomas Fitzgerald\n*Isaac Grantham\n|\n:Kent County\n*James Raymond\n*James Sykes\n*John Vining\n|\n:Sussex County\n*Charles Draper\n*Nathaniel Hayes\n*David Owens\n|}\nHouse of Representatives\nRepresentatives were elected by the public for a one-year term.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Levi Adams\n*John C.
