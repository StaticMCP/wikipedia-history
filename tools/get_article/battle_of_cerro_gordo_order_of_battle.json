(Juvera and Canalizo Brigades?)\nNotes:\n# Manuel Balbontin, a Mexican artillery officer during the war (La Invasion Americana 1888) does not cover the battle.\n# Mexican Artillery batteries usually had 4 guns. Batteries with larger guns had fewer than this. Guns were grouped together by size, i.e. a battery of 4 four pounders ( 4-4&nbsp;lbs.), or a battery of 3 twelve pounders (3-12&nbsp;lbs.) A total of 43 guns would indicate about 11 batteries. Col. L. Palacios was killed while commanding artillery. Naval Capt P. Ruiz y Baranda, Naval Lt. F. Fernandez, and Capt. V. Arguelles and Lts. M. Camacho, B. Arnable & J. R. Cobarrubias were all captured commanding artillery. Naval Capt. Godinez and artillery officers Malagon and Olzinger were also present. Battery commanders? Naval Capt. Araujo, above was probably a battery commander also. Or, about ten battery commanders.\n# GMT Games (unsure of sources) posits Pinzon with 7 guns (1- 12&nbsp;lbs., 2-8&nbsp;lbs. and 4- 4&nbsp;lbs. about two batteries), Araujo with 8 guns (4- 8&nbsp;lbs. and 4- 4&nbsp;lbs. about two batteries), Badillo with 9 guns (3- 8&nbsp;lbs. and 6- 4&nbsp;lbs. about two batteries), Diaz with 7 guns (4- 16&nbsp;lbs. and 3- 8&nbsp;lbs. about two batteries) Vasques with 4 guns (4- 4 lobs. one battery), Jarero with 5 guns (1- 8&nbsp;lbs. and 4- 4&nbsp;lbs. about one battery). Or about ten batteries.\nReferences"
