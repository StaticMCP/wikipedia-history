      "text": "# Claudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice\n\nClaudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice is a 2009 young adult nonfiction book by Phillip Hoose, recounting the experiences of Claudette Colvin in Montgomery, Alabama, during the Civil Rights Movement.\nPlot\nThis book covers the experiences of Claudette Colvin in the 1950s, specifically focusing on her role in the Civil Rights Movement and her involvement in the Browder v. Gayle trial. Colvin is notable within the case because she refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus when she was 15 years old and nine months before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.\nCritical reception\nClaudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice gained generally positive reviews from critics. They praised the young adult biography for giving Colvin the recognition she never received back in 1955. The Wall Street Journal said \"History might have forgotten Claudette Colvin, or relegated her to footnote status, had writer Phillip Hoose not stumbled upon her name in the course of other research and tracked her down.\" And the Chicago Tribune says, “Hoose makes the moments in Montgomery come alive, whether it’s about Claudette’s neighborhood, her attorneys, her pastor or all the different individuals in the civil rights movement who paths she crossed . . . . An engrossing read.”\nAwards and distinctions\n*2009 winner, National Book Award for Young People's Literature\n*2010 Newbery Honor Book\n*2010 Robert F.
