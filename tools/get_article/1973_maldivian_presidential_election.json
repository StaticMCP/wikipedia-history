The elections took the form of a referendum on the candidacy of incumbent president Ibrahim Nasir, who was re-elected.\nBackground\nNasir had originally been elected for a four-year term in 1968. However, in 1972 a constitutional amendment was passed by the Majlis to extend the presidential term to five years.\nThe constitution required that the President be selected by the Majlis and then their candidacy confirmed through a referendum.\nReferences"
