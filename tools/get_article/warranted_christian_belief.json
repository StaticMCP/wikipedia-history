      "text": "# Warranted Christian Belief\n\nWarranted Christian Belief is a book written by Alvin Plantinga and published in 2000 (Oxford University Press). It constitutes, after Warrant: The Current Debate and Warrant and Proper Function, both published in 1993, the last part of his trilogy on epistemology.\nIn this book, Plantinga wants first to show that it is rational to accept Christian belief. Plantinga also proposes, with what he calls \"the Aquinas/Calvin Model\", an \"account of the way in which Christian belief is, in fact, justified, rational and warranted\".\nWarranted Christian Belief has been described as a \"full-blooded defense of Christianity\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://ccel.org/ccel/plantinga/warrant3 Warranted Christian Belief] at Christian Classics Ethereal Library"
