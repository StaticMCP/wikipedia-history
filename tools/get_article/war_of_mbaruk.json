The sons of Mnkande, who were powerful figures within the kingdom, sought to assert their influence and control over the territory. Mbaruk el Mazrui, a rebel leader from Mombasa, allied with the sons of Mnkande. His forces had recently bolstered their strength by incorporating runaway slaves, presenting a formidable challenge to the reigning authority of Kimweri Maguvu.\nKey events\nThe conflict escalated when Mbaruk's forces, together with the sons of Mnkande, launched a fierce attack on Bagha, a territory northeast of Vugha, the capital. Kimweri Maguvu's forces were initially caught off guard and retreated in disarray, fearing the loss of their capital. In a moment of desperation, Kimweri sought the assistance of Mtoi, the chief of Ubii, who was known for his rain magic. Kimweri offered three cows in exchange for the help of Mtoi. Following this, a violent rainstorm and wind struck, causing chaos among Mbaruk’s men and leading to their retreat.The Shambaa forces counterattacked, driving the sons of Mnkande out of Makanya and capturing many of their soldiers, revealing the weaknesses in the sons of Mnkande's regional political standing.\nInvolvement of the Sultan of Zanzibar\nThe sons of Mnkande's alliance with Mbaruk drew the attention of the Sultan of Zanzibar, Seyyid Barghash. Kimweri and his ally Semboja communicated the threat posed by the sons of Mnkande, prompting Barghash to order an attack on their stronghold in Hundu, East Usambara. A coalition force led by the Wali of Pangani was assembled, which included local allies. This force successfully drove the sons of Mnkande out of Hundu, effectively diminishing their power.\nAftermath of the War\nBy the conclusion of the War of Mbaruk, the sons of Mnkande were reduced to governing only Handei (present-day Handeni), the southern part of East Usambara. Their earlier ambitions were curtailed, and they faced increased isolation. In the following years, Kinyashi, the grandson of Mnkande, sought to restore relations with the Sultan of Zanzibar, indicating a desire to regain political favor after the defeat. The war also highlighted the shifting power dynamics within the region, illustrating how alliances could change rapidly and how external forces like the Sultanate could influence local conflicts.\nSee also\n* Shambaa Kingdom\nReferences"
