It was most recently assigned to the 451st Air Expeditionary Group at Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, where it was inactivated on 1 September 2014.\nThe squadron's first predecessor was the 861st Bombardment Squadron, a United States Army Air Forces unit that was assigned to the 493d Bombardment Group during World War II.  It was part of the last bombardment group to be assigned to Eighth Air Force.  It flew combat missions until V-E Day, then returned to the United States for inactivation.\nThe squadron's other predecessor, the 361st Reconnaissance Squadron was formed during the Vietnam War, flying Douglas EC-47 aircraft, performing electronic surveillance in Vietnam and Thailand until inactivating in 1974, when the United States withdrew from Southeast Asia.  The squadrons were consolidated in 1985, then converted to provisional status as an expeditionary unit.\nHistory\nWorld War II\nInitial activation and training in the United States\nThe 861st Bombardment Squadron, the first predecessor of the squadron,  was first activated at McCook Army Air Field, Nebraska as one of the original four squadrons of the 493d Bombardment Group.  The formation of the squadron was delayed by an administrative error that caused some of the unit's cadre to report to Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona instead of McCook.  It was not until January that all personnel were at McCook.  By this time, the squadron had transferred on paper to  Elveden Hall, England.  The ground personnel of the squadron in the United States had been used to form Boeing B-29 Superfortress units being activated by Second Air Force, while the air echelon remained in Nebraska to conduct training on their assigned Consolidated B-24 Liberators.  Meanwhile, Eighth Air Force formed a new ground echelon for the squadron in England from other units assigned to the 3d Bombardment Division.  This ground echelon moved to the squadron's combat station, RAF Debach, in April 1944.  The squadron's air echelon departed for England via the northern ferry route on 1 May, while a small ground component left McCook and sailed from Boston, Massachusetts on the  on 12 May 1944.\nCombat in Europe\nThe squadron flew its first combat mission on D-Day, 6 June 1944.  It continued to fly Liberators until 24 August 1944, when it was withdrawn from combat to convert to Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, along with other groups of the 93d Bombardment Wing, as Eighth Air Force concentrated all its Liberators in the 2d Bombardment Division.  It resumed combat missions with the B-17 on 8 September 1944.  The squadron concentrated its attacks on military and industrial targets in Germany, attacking an ordnance depot in Magdeburg, factories near Frankfurt, and a synthetic oil manufacturing plant at Merseburg.  It also attacked lines of communications, including a railroad tunnel at Ahrweiler, bridges at Irlich, and marshalling yards near Cologne.\nThe squadron was occasionally diverted to attack tactical targets.  It supported Operation Overlord, the Normandy invasion, striking artillery batteries, airfields and bridges.  It struck enemy ground forces south of Caen and during Operation Cobra, the breakout at St Lo.  It bombed German fortifications to support Operation Market Garden, airborne attacks attempting to secure a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands and attacked communications during the Battle of the Bulge.  Toward the end of the war, it also supported Operation Varsity, the airborne assault across the Rhine in Germany.\nThe squadron flew its last combat mission against marshalling yards near Nauen on 20 April 1945, although it flew food-dropping missions in early May.  The squadron air echelon departed Debach on 30 June, while the ground echelon sailed for home aboard the  on 6 August 1945. In late August, the squadron assembled at Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, where it was inactivated on 28 August 1945.\nVietnam War\nIn January 1966, Military Assistance Command Vietnam expressed a requirement for airborne radio direction finding (ARDF) to intercept enemy radio traffic to locate enemy units.  That month, the Air Force began Project Phyllis Ann, which modified 35 Douglas C-47 Skytrains by installing AN/ARD-18 direction finding equipment in them..\nThe squadron's second predecessor, 361st Reconnaissance Squadron, was organized at Nha Trang Air Base, South Vietnam in April 1966, flying RC-47 aircraft equipped for ARDF.  Detachment 1 of the 6994th Security Squadron operated the planes' direction finding equipment.  In July 1966, Detachment 1 of the squadron was established at Pleiku Air Base, although its first \"Electric Goony\" did not arrive until December.  On 1 February 1967, Detachment 1 was discontinued and transferred its personnel and equipment to the newly organized 362d Reconnaissance Squadron.\nIn the spring of 1967, the squadron was redesignated the 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron and its RC-47 aircraft became EC-47s.  Its mission equipment changed its name from AN/ARD-18 to AN/ALR-34, and Project Phyllis Ann became Project Compass Dart.\nDuring the November 1967 Battle of Dak To, squadron ARDF identified NVA units moving toward the Dak To Base Camp.  During the battle, squadron identification of the location of enemy units was used to target Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strikes on \"known base areas, infiltration routes and strong points.\"  Squadron provided ARDF frequently provided location information for B-52 strikes.\nIn late February 1968, a squadron aircraft returning to base from a mission picked up signals coming from the South China Sea.  ARDF fixes were made on three of the four transmitters, which were trawlers transporting arms to the Viet Cong.  The locations were transmitted to the Navy's Operation Market Time blockading force, which sank one trawler and forced the other two aground in \"one of the most significant victories\" of the operation.\nOperations over Laos became increasingly dangerous with the increase in air defenses there.  In March 1968, a squadron aircraft, Brew 41, operating in the Steel Tiger area was hit by 37mm fire.  The pilot was able to crash land the plane on an abandoned Special Forces camp across the border in South Vietnam.\nThe squadron moved to Thailand in 1972 as part of the USAF drawdown in South Vietnam.  It continued missions over Indochina until 15 August 1973 when United States military flights over Indochina were halted by congressional mandate.  The squadron trained in Thailand until its inactivation on 30 June 1974.\nWar on Terrorism\nThe squadron reactivated as the 361st Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron as part of the War on Terrorism in 2003.  Assigned to first the 407th Air Expeditionary Group, then later the 451st Air Expeditionary Group, the squadron operated a variety of surveillance & reconnaissance aircraft before the United States withdrew from Iraq in 2011 and Afghanistan in 2014.\nLineage\n; 861st Bombardment Squadron\n* Constituted as the 861st Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 14 September 1943\n: Activated on 1 November 1943\n: Redesignated 861st Bombardment Squadron, Heavy on 21 February 1944\n: Inactivated on 28 August 1945\n* Consolidated with the 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron as the 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron on 19 September 1985\n; 361st Reconnaissance Squadron\n* Constituted as the 361st Reconnaissance Squadron and activated on 4 April 1966 (not organized)\n: Organized on 8 April 1966\n: Redesignated 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron on 15 March 1967\n: Inactivated on 1 December 1971\n* Activated on 1 September 1972\n: Inactivated on 30 June 1974\n* Consolidated with the 861st Bombardment Squadron on 19 September 1985\n: Redesignated 361st Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron and converted to provisional status\n: Activated c.
