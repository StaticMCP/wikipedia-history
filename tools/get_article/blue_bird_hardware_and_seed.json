It was built in 1955 in Mid-century modern style.  It was opened as an agricultural supply store, as the area was largely undeveloped and rural at the time.  The building was renovated in 2017 to serve several retail tenants.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.\nReferences"
