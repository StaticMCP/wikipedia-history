The hospital is owned by the RWJBarnabas Health System and is the third-largest hospital in the system.\nNBIMC is affiliated with the New Jersey Medical School of Rutgers University and features over 100 residents. It has an adult and pediatric emergency department, but serious trauma is usually handled by the nearby University Hospital. Attached to the medical center is the Children's Hospital of New Jersey, which treats infants and young people up to age 21.\nHistory\nThe hospital was run under auspices of the Newark Jewish Community and its suburban successors from its inception in 1900–1901 until its purchase by RWJBarnabas Health in 1996.\nIn 2011, the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center was ranked among the top 50 hospitals in the United States for specialty care in cardiology and heart surgery. The following year, it remained highly ranked but was not in the top 50 hospitals nationwide.\nNewark Beth Israel Medical Center is home to one of the nation's ten largest heart transplant centers, according to Becker's Hospital Review.\nIn 2020, the hospital was given an \"A\" by the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade.\nIn 2019 regulators found incidents in which the hospital put patients in \"immediate jeopardy\" following unsuccessful surgeries, and did not carry out its own recommendations, leading to mistakes on subsequent operations. Regulators also discovered instances hospital staff who failed to obtain informed consent or follow patients' and family members' \"do not resuscitate\" orders. Weeks later, Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr. issued a statement about the corrective actions taken by the hospital, saying, \"Based on my communications with the hospital, I believe the situation is moving in the right direction at this time and I will continue to monitor it.\"\nIn early 2020, the hospital suspended a staff member for distributing unauthorized protective gear after the staff member used GoFundMe to raise money to buy gowns and masks for hospital staff to use in dealing with Coronavirus disease 2019 patients.\nIn October 2020, the hospital began a $100 million project to expand and modernize the facility, including the emergency room, intensive care units, a new cardiac center and maternity unit.\nServices\n* Cancer\n* Heart and vascular care\n* Men's health\n* Maternal-Fetal Medicine (High-Risk Pregnancy)\n* Mental health and behavioral health\n* Neuroscience\n* Neonatal Intensive Care (NICU)\n* Obstetrics & Gynecology\n* Orthopedics\n* Pediatrics\n* Senior health\n* Transplant services\n* Weight loss and Bariatric surgery\n* Wellness\n* Women's health\nAwards & Accreditations\n* American Association of Blood Banks: Accredited Laboratory Services\n* American College of Cardiology: Performance Achievement Award for Cardiac Care, Gold, 2014; Silver, 2017\n* American College of Radiology: Breast Imaging Center of Excellence; Diagnostic Imaging Center Excellence; Designated Lung Cancer Screening Center\n* American College of Surgeons’ Commission on Cancer: Silver Level Accreditation and Commendation\n* American Heart Association: Distinguished Physician-Harvey E.
