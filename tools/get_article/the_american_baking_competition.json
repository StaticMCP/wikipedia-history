It was an adaptation of The Great British Bake Off (which aired in the United States under the title The Great British Baking Show). The series aimed to find the best amateur baker in the United States. The series was hosted by Jeff Foxworthy and judged by Marcela Valladolid and Paul Hollywood.  The competition was won by Brian Emmett.\nFormat\nThe show aimed to find among its contestants the best amateur baker in the US.  Ten contestants were chosen for the first season.  In each episode, the amateur bakers were given three challenges: a signature, a technical challenge, and a show-stopper.  The three challenges took place over two days, and the dishes made by the contestants were assessed by the judges after each challenge.  At the end of the three challenges, the judges chose a Star Baker for the week, and a contestant was also eliminated.  In the finale three bakers were left and a winner was chosen from the three.\n* Signature – a dish using their own tried and tested recipe that the amateur bakers make for their family and friends.\n* Technical - a dessert using the same ingredients and recipe provided by the judges.  The recipe given however has missing instructions and is designed to test the knowledge and skill of the bakers.  The bakers are not told beforehand what the challenge might be, and the judges do not observe the bakers at work and judge the resulting dish without knowing who made them. This round is the only one where how each contestant performed is directly revealed. The contestants are given a ranking, but that ranking is not their total score for the episode.\n* Show-stopper - a recipe designed to impress the judges.\nThe competition was held in one location in a specially constructed marquee.  Interspersed in the show were short videos on the background of the contestants, as well as information on the history of baking and visiting various locations.\nThe entire season series was shot over a one-month period.\nThe winner of the competition received a $250,000 grand prize and a publishing contract with Simon & Schuster.\nProduction\nOn October 17, 2012, CBS ordered the series under the original title Bake-Off. Since Pillsbury Company held the trademark to the name (using it for its Pillsbury Bake-Off), the show was later renamed The American Baking Competition.\nCBS placed casting calls for participants on November 14, 2012. Auditions were held between December 1 and December 15, 2012.  The competition took place at the Gibbs Gardens in Ball Ground, Georgia in March 2013.\nBroadcast\nThe first season of The American Baking Competition premiered on May 29, 2013. It aired four episodes in the Wednesdays at 8 p.m. Eastern/9 p.m. Central timeslot. On June 26, 2013, it moved to 9 p.m. Eastern/8 p.m. Central, to make way for Big Brother, and aired its three remaining episodes in that timeslot. Both of these timeslots put the series opposite Fox's MasterChef.\nIn 2015, ABC premiered a second U.S. version of the format, The Great Holiday Baking Show. The Christmas-themed revival ran for four episodes as part of ABC's December lineup, and featured Johnny Iuzzini joined by British judge Mary Berry. The series returned for a second season in 2016, renamed The Great American Baking Show.\nBakers\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Baker\n! scope=\"col\"| Age(on show debut)\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Occupation(on show)\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Hometown\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Brian Emmett\n| 43 || Marketing Executive || Itasca, Illinois || Originally from Glendale Heights, Illinois\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Carlo Fuda\n| 35 || Social Marketing Consultant || Stamford, Connecticut || Originally from Ellwood City, Pennsylvania\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Darlene Pawlukowsky\n| 51 || Project Manager || Johns Creek, Georgia || Originally from Mt.

The theme of the episode was bread and pastries.\nFor the signature bake, the bakers had three hours to make a free-form loaf of bread.  The bread had to be yeast bread, and hand shaped. In the technical bake, the bakers were given one hour and 45 minutes to make eight large soft pretzels using Paul's recipe.  Immediately following the technical challenge, the bakers went on to make the showstopper, which was two types of croissants, one plain and one filled. They were given two hours the first day, allowed the dough to rise overnight in the fridge, and then three hours the next day to finish the bake.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Baker\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Signature(Loaf of Yeast Bread)\n! scope=\"col\"| Technical(Soft Pretzels)\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Showstopper( 24 Croissants)\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"| Darlene\n| Twist-and-turn Pesto Wheel || 1st || Plain and Apricot and Pecan-Filled Croissants\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Brian\n| Onion-Braided Loaf || 3rd || Plain and Ham-and-Chive-Filled Croissants\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Francine\n| Red Hot, Pecan, and Brown Sugar Loaf || 2nd || Plain and Date, Nut and Honey-Filled Croissants\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| James\n| Prosciutto, Capicola, and Pepperoni Loaf || 7th || Plain and Chocolate-Filled Croissants\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Elaine\n| Old-Fashioned Potato Loaf || 4th || Plain and Raspberry and White Chocolate-Filled Croissants\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Effie\n| Enriched Challah Bread|| 6th || Plain and Pear-Filled Croissants\n|- style=\"background:Pink;\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:Pink;\"| Kolette\n| German Pumpernickel || 5th || Plain and Almond-Filled Croissants\n|}\nEpisode 5: \"Desserts\"\nEpisode five aired on June 26, 2013. The theme of the episode was sweet baked goods.\nFor the signature bake, the bakers must make 8 individual custards, either sweet like a crème brûlée, or using a more savory recipe.  They had 90 minutes to finish the task.   In the technical bake, the challenge was to bake a chocolate soufflé, however.  As the soufflé can fall within minutes of coming out of the oven, the start time for the bakers was staggered so that each bake can be judged immediately after it was baked.  The bakers were each given an hour and 45 minutes.    For the final challenge, the bakers were required to produce a layered dessert featuring meringue in five hours.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Baker\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Signature(8 Custards)\n! scope=\"col\"| Technical(Chocolate Soufflé)\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Showstopper(Multi-layer Meringue Cakes)\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"| Darlene\n| Vanilla Custards || 3rd || Chocolate Meringue Cake\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Francine\n|Dreamsicle Custards || 4th || Raspberry, Lemon and Meringue Chiffon Cake\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Elaine\n| Crab and Fresh Corn Custards || 2nd || Nutty Meringue Stack\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| James\n| Caramel Espresso Custards || 1st ||Pavlova and Lemon Layer Cake with Berries\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Brian\n| Jalapeño and Chorizo Custards || 6th || Almond Meringue Cake\n|-style=\"background:Pink;\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:Pink;\"| Effie\n| Lime Pots de Creme || 5th || Hazelnut Meringue Creation\n|}\nEpisode 6: \"Patisserie\"\nEpisode six aired on July 3, 2013.

It was the finals of the competition. The theme was patriotism, with dishes that were all related to the United States.\nThe contestants could make anything for the signature bake but had to include the official state crop of Georgia, the peanut; they had a time limit of two hours thirty minutes. The contestants had two hours forty-five minutes to complete a Paul Hollywood recipe; a dozen Boston Cream Donuts. For the showstopper the final three contestants had five hours to make 72 miniature desserts inspired by the American flag; 24 mini-meringues, 24 mini-tarts and 24 mini-cakes.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Baker\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Signature(Peanuts)\n! scope=\"col\"| Technical(Dozen Boston Cream Donuts)\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Showstopper(72 miniature desserts)\n|- style=\"background:gold\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:gold\"| Brian\n| Vanilla Peanut Chiffon Roll with a Peanut Mousse Filling,topped with Peanut Praline || 3rd || Whipped Cream filled Mini-Meringues with White Chocolate dipped PopcornMascarpone Cream filled Mini-Tarts with berriesRaspberry White Chocolate Mini-Cakes with berries\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Darlene\n| Peanut Cake Roll with Peanut Cream Filling || 1st || 4 July Mini-Meringues with Pop Rocks CandyPeach and Grit Mini-TartsStrawberry USA Mini-Cakes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Francine\n| Spiced Peanut Peanut Butter Torte with a Cream CheeseFilling and a Cookie Crumble Shell || 2nd || Blueberry Cream-Filled Mini-MeringuesRed, White and Blue Mini-Cakes covered in White ChocolatePeaches and Cream Creampuffs pastries\n|}\nReception\nCritical reception\nThe American Baking Competition has received mixed reviews from critics.\nLiane Bonin Starr of HitFix stated that the series was \"surprisingly nice\" for a reality TV series. She felt that it was very mellow, so \"it was up to judges Marcela Valladolid and Paul Hollywood to provide some acid to the recipe.\" She did appreciate the series's showcasing of the food, saying \"what the show lacks in intensity it makes up for in food.\"\nTV Lines Michael Slezak described the series as \"half-baked\" stating that there was \"not really enough time to focus on getting to know the players\" or to get \"a real insight into their baking philosophies.\" Additionally, the pilot's outcome was described as \"as predictable as the use of butter in a pie crust.\" He expressed hope that \"future installments might take a few tips from various Food Network competition shows and put a little more emphasis on the actual dishes.\"\nRatings\nThe series premiered to a disappointing 1.0 rating in the Adults 18-49 demographic and 5.11 million total viewers. This made it the worst ever Wednesday premiere for a CBS show. However, it rose in ratings for the first two weeks, a feat ratings experts called \"extremely rare.\" It had seemed like the series would be boosted by moving behind Big Brother on June 26, but it didn't end up that way, as the ratings were generally the same after the move. The last two episodes did not help the series, as it went down slightly, a movement that was not good for the series's renewal prospects. The show was cancelled in July 2013.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0; width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ Episode list\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=2|\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=2|Air date\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=2|Rating / shareHouseholds\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=2|Rating / share18–49\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=2| Viewers(millions)\n! scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=2|Weekly ranking\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=2| Refs\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| 18–49\n! scope=\"col\"| Total viewers\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1\n| align=\"left\"|\n| 3.4 / 6\n| 1.0 / 3\n| 5.11\n| width=\"12%\"|41\n| width=\"12%\"|27\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2\n| align=\"left\"|\n| 3.1 / 6\n| 1.1 / 4\n| 4.73\n| >25\n| 29\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 3\n| align=\"left\"|\n| 3.9 / 7\n| 1.2 / 4\n| 5.68\n| 24\n| 22\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| align=\"left\"|\n| 3.7 / 7\n| 1.2 / 4\n| 5.80\n| 23\n| 14\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n| align=\"left\"|\n| 3.3 / 5\n| 1.2 / 4\n| 5.10\n| 23\n| >25\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n| align=\"left\"|\n|\n| 1.1 / 4\n| 4.70\n| 23\n| 19\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n| align=\"left\"|\n| 3.1 / 5\n| 1.1 / 3\n| 4.83\n| >25\n| 25\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130609101405/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/tag/the-american-baking-competition-ratings/ The American Baking Competition] at TV by the Numbers"
