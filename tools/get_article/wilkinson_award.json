The award recognises excellence in new residential buildings built in New South Wales, Australia, often for freestanding houses, but at times awarded multiresidential projects and alterations and additions. Since 2005 it has only been presented to new houses with separate awards established for multiresidential and alteration and addition projects.\nBackground\nThe medal is presented in memory of the Australian architect and academic Professor Leslie Wilkinson , (12 October 1882 – 20 September 1973). Born in New Southgate, London, England he emigrated to Sydney in 1918 and became the first Dean of Architecture at the University of Sydney, School of Architecture.\nNational Awards\nWinners of the Named Award, Architecture Award and Commendations are eligible for consideration of the Robin Boyd Award presented later in the same year at the Australian national architecture awards, regarded as the highest award for new houses in Australia. Since 1981 a total of 10 Wilkinson Award winners have won the national Robin Boyd Award.\nMultiple winners\nGlenn Murcutt has won the award on six occasions and Harry Seidler and Ken Woolley on four occasions. Alexander Tzannes and Durbach Block Jaggers have won the award three times each.\nList of recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Wilkinson Award by year (reverse
