The 16 mounds form a zig-zag line of nearly a mile along the Tennessee River. The largest of the platform mounds is located at the center of the site, and was  in height. A trench circling along the east side of this line connects with the river, at the north end and at the south end, thus the river to the west and the trench to the east, entirely encircled this ancient village. These have never been extensively excavated.\nIn 1830, David Robinson, a wealthy landowner and local planter, built a Federal-style home overlooking the Tennessee River on one of the mounds. The house is now known as the Cherry Mansion.\nSee also\n*Shiloh Indian Mounds Site\n*Swallow Bluff Island Mounds\n*List of Mississippian sites\nReferences"
