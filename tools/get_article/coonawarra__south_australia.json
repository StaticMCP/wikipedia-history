It is best known for the Coonawarra wine region named after it.\nThe Aboriginal Australians living in the area when Europeans arrived were the Bindjali people, The word coonawarra is reported to have been their word for honeysuckle, although this meaning has also been ascribed to Penola by the same source. An alternative origin to the name is still rooted in the local indigenous language: “The name of John Riddock’s fruit colony, started by him in 1895. “Coon” being the aboriginal word for “big lip”, and “warra,” for “house,” and was applied by natives to a house in the locality in which a man with a remarkably big lip lived”\nCoonawarra was a station on the Mount Gambier railway line, which opened in 1887 and operated until it closed to freight on 12 April 1995. The Limestone Coast Railway tourist trains stopped at the station from Mount Gambier until 20 March 1999.\nThe township of Coonawarra is a few hundred metres west of the Riddoch Highway which passes along the ridge in the middle of the Coonawarra wine region. The historic Wynn's Coonawarra Winery in Memorial Drive is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.\nClimate\n, (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1985–present)\n|Jan record high C = 44.5\n|Feb record high C = 43.6\n|Mar record high C = 40.8\n|Apr record high C = 36.2\n|May record high C = 29.9\n|Jun record high C = 23.2\n|Jul record high C = 23.2\n|Aug record high C = 25.5\n|Sep record high C = 31.2\n|Oct record high C = 35.8\n|Nov record high C = 37.9\n|Dec record high C = 45.8\n|Jan record low C = 0.2\n|Feb record low C = 2.2\n|Mar record low C = 0.0\n|Apr record low C = -2.2\n|May record low C = -3.0\n|Jun record low C = -3.8\n|Jul record low C = -3.4\n|Aug record low C = -3.6\n|Sep record low C = -2.6\n|Oct record low C = -2.2\n|Nov record low C = -0.2\n|Dec record low C = 0.2\n|Jan high C = 27.7\n|Feb high C = 27.6\n|Mar high C = 24.9\n|Apr high C = 21.0\n|May high C = 17.1\n|Jun high C = 14.5\n|Jul high C = 13.9\n|Aug high C = 14.9\n|Sep high C = 16.9\n|Oct high C = 19.8\n|Nov high C = 22.8\n|Dec high C = 25.3\n| year high C = 20.5\n|Jan low C = 11.8\n|Feb low C = 12.0\n|Mar low C = 10.2\n|Apr low C = 7.6\n|May low C = 6.8\n|Jun low C = 5.3\n|Jul low C = 5.2\n|Aug low C = 5.3\n|Sep low C = 6.4\n|Oct low C = 7.4\n|Nov low C = 8.9\n|Dec low C = 10.2\n| year low C = 8.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 28.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 19.2\n|Mar precipitation mm = 26.3\n|Apr precipitation mm = 36.4\n|May precipitation mm = 55.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 72.4\n|Jul precipitation mm = 76.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 80.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 64.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 41.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 37.6\n|Dec precipitation mm = 34.0\n|year precipitation mm = 575.1\n| unit precipitation days = 0.2 mm\n| Jan precipitation days = 6.9\n| Feb precipitation days = 6.1\n| Mar precipitation days = 8.5\n| Apr precipitation days = 11.8\n| May precipitation days = 17.0\n| Jun precipitation days = 18.6\n| Jul precipitation days = 20.6\n| Aug precipitation days = 20.6\n| Sep precipitation days = 19.1\n| Oct precipitation days = 14.2\n| Nov precipitation days = 11.2\n| Dec precipitation days = 10.4\n| year precipitation days =165.0\n|humidity colour = green\n|Jan afthumidity = 38\n|Feb afthumidity = 38\n|Mar afthumidity = 41\n|Apr afthumidity = 49\n|May afthumidity = 62\n|Jun afthumidity = 69\n|Jul afthumidity = 69\n|Aug afthumidity = 63\n|Sep afthumidity = 60\n|Oct afthumidity = 53\n|Nov afthumidity = 48\n|Dec afthumidity = 43\n|source 1 = Australian Bureau of Meteorology (humidity 1991–2010)\n}}\nReferences"
