It was a Brazilian victory over some of Paraguayan president Francisco Solano López's last remaining  forces; it was fought to the north of the Jejuí Guazú River.\nIt was the last battle fought before the Battle of Cerro Corá in March of the same year, which ended the war.\nBackground and engagement\nAfter the battles of Piribebuy and Acosta Ñu the once-formidable Paraguayan Army had been made unable to wage a regular conflict. The Paraguayan War became a chase of Paraguayan leader López by far superior allied forces.\nOn January 11 of 1870 a Paraguayan column was spotted by the vanguard of general Câmara's troops. It was engaged and routed, with many of its men, including its commander, later being taken prisoner. The men in the column had been surviving on fruits foraged in the forest for the past few weeks and its officers had been debating whether or not to surrender previously.\nThe next battle of the conflict would be that of Cerro Corá, which would bring about its end, as López was killed there.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
