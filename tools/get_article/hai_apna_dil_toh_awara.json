Tony Singh, who is a perfect con artist when it comes to women has his lady love Pooja Mehta in a web of dreams around him.\nRikki Dalwani's life is a beach resort where he has this perfect wife Sanya Dalwani doing all the things, from house hold work to running their boutique and he seems to be engrossed playing a game of monopoly with his friends.\nSaajan Patel and Sanjana Patel's life is straight from the tales of a Gujarati household story where the man is stuck between his mother's love and his duties towards the wife whenever the two women of his heart confront each other in the kitchen, which is a battle ring in the house.\nHaving said this and giving and taking nothing from these bright couples, the story moves towards a plan that Pooja decides to have for her man Tony, a dream getaway destination to Kashmir to spend more quality time with her man in order to move to the next level of their relationship, that is marriage (every woman's dream and a man's nightmare) They seem to be stuck on level one since the past two years.\nBut Tony seems to be in a party mode and extends the invitation to his friends and their wives, utterly to Pooja's dismay.

Meeting their old friend Manjeet Singh Sodhi, the resort owner and his beautiful Persian wife Sonya Singh is a delight for all of them.\nThe sudden shift of gear in their lives seems to be clearing the air of confusion and ego among the three couples.
