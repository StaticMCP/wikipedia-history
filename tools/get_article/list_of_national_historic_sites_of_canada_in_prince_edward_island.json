There are 22 National Historic Sites designated in Prince Edward Island, five of which are administered by Parks Canada (identified below by the beaver icon ).  The first National Historic Site to be designated in Prince Edward Island was Jean-Pierre Roma at Three Rivers in 1933.\nNumerous National Historic Events also occurred in P.E.I., and are identified at places associated with them, using the same style of federal plaque which marks National Historic Sites. Several National Historic Persons are commemorated throughout the province in the same way. The markers do not indicate which designation—a Site, Event, or Person—a subject has been given.\nThis list uses names designated by the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board, which may differ from other names for these sites.\nNational Historic Sites\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"21%\" | Site\n! style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"14%\" | Date(s)\n! style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"9%\" | Designated\n! style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"13%\" | Location\n! style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"36%\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n! style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"7%\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n|-\n| Alberton Court House\n| 1878 (completed)\n| 1981\n| Alberton\n| A simple wooden hall evocative of a pioneer church, now used as the local museum; representative of the six circuit courthouses, all built according to a standard plan after the passage of Prince Edward Island's County Courts Act in 1873\n|\n|-\n| All Souls' Chapel\n| 1888 (completed)\n| 1990\n| Charlottetown\n| A small chapel built of rust-red, Prince Edward Island sandstone, attached to St. Peter's Anglican Cathedral; known as an exceptional example of the High Victorian Gothic Revival style in Canada, and for its 18 interior mural paintings by Robert Harris\n|\n|-\n| Apothecaries Hall\n| 1900 (completed)\n| 1969\n| Charlottetown\n| A three-storey brick building in which an apothecary shop operated from 1810 to 1986, making it one of the oldest continually operated pharmacies in Canada\n|\n|-\n| Ardgowan\n| 1850 (completed)\n| 1966\n| Charlottetown\n| The residence of William Henry Pope, a Father of Confederation; the Popes billetted George Brown and hosted a luncheon for delegates here during the Charlottetown Conference\n|\n|-\n| Charlottetown City Hall\n| 1888 (completed)\n| 1984\n| Charlottetown\n| A Romanesque Revival style town hall, the design of which symbolizes the growth and prosperity of Prince Edward Island and its capital in the late 19th century\n|\n|-\n| Confederation Centre of the Arts\n| 1964 (completed)\n| 2003\n| Charlottetown\n| A Brutalist style multi-purpose cultural centre containing a theatre, art gallery and public library; built as a memorial to the Fathers of Confederation who met at the Charlottetown Conference, the facility is representative of the wave of cultural complexes built in the 1960s and 1970s in Canada\n|\n|-\n| Dalvay-by-the-Sea\n| 1899 (completed)\n| 1990\n| Prince Edward Island National Park\n| A summer residence built for Alexander McDonald, president of Standard Oil of Kentucky; now a hotel, it is a noted example of the Queen Anne Revival style in Canadian domestic architecture\n|\n|-\n| Dundas Terrace\n| 1889 (completed)\n| 1990\n| Charlottetown\n| A wooden three-and-a-half-storey apartment building; a noted example of the Queen Anne Revival style in Canadian apartment building architecture\n|\n|-\n| Fairholm\n| 1839 (completed)\n| 1992\n| Charlottetown\n| A brick villa a carriage house built for Thomas Heath Haviland, Sr.; an excellent and rare surviving example of a Picturesque villa in Atlantic Canada\n|\n|-\n| Farmers' Bank of Rustico\n| 1863 (completed)\n| 1959\n| North Rustico\n| A stone building that housed one of the first people's banks in the country, offering loans to residents in the predominantly Acadian farming community; its establishment heralded the development of the credit union movement in Canada\n|\n|-\n| Former Summerside Post Office\n| 1887 (completed)\n| 1983\n| Summerside\n| A stone post office with Gothic and Romanesque elements; representative of the small urban post offices erected by the Department of Public Works in smaller urban centres during Thomas Fuller's term as Chief Architect; current town hall\n|\n|-\n| Government House\n| 1834 (completed)\n| 1971\n| Charlottetown\n| The official residence of the Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island, it sits on a more extensive property called Fanningbank.
