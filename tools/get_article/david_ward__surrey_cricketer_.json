In all first-class matches, he scored 8139 runs at an average of 38.39, with 16 centuries and a highest score of 294 not out. He scored \"a remarkable 2,072 first-class runs in 1990, including seven hundreds\".\nNicknamed \"Gnasher\" for his prominent teeth, Ward was something of a cult personality as a player. He is now a coach at Whitgift School, where his pupils have included England opening batsmen Rory Burns, Jason Roy and Dom Sibley, wicket-keeper Jamie Smith, and several other players for Surrey, such as Freddie van den Bergh and Laurie Evans.\nWithin the conservative and restrictive world of cricket whites, Ward was able to demonstrate a little eccentricity, occasionally choosing to wear a cap or even helmet decorated in the traditional Harlequin pattern more associated with Douglas Jardine and other players of yester-year.\nWard currently plays club cricket for Old Whitgiftians C.C. in the Surrey Championship when his school duties allow.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/22297.html Cricinfo profile]"
