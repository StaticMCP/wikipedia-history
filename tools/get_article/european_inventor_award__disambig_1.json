Inventions from all technological fields are considered for this award. The winners in each category are presented with an award shaped like a sail. There is no cash prize associated with the award, however there is a cash prize for all 3 of the Young Inventors Prize finalists.\nAward categories and prizes\nThe European Inventor Award is presented in the following five categories and two prizes:\n*Industry\n*Research\n*Non-European countries (Non-EPOs)\n*Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)\n*Lifetime Achievement\n*Young Inventors Prize (introduced in 2022, and consisting of 3rd, 2nd and 1st place prizes)\n*Popular Prize (from among the finalists introduced in 2013, and decided by a public vote)\nNomination and selection\nEach year the European Patent Office calls on its patent examiners, on examiners at the patent offices in the EPO's member states and on public at large to propose inventions for the award that were patented at the European Patent Office and have made a significant contribution towards innovation, economy and society in Europe.\nA short list of nominees is then drawn up from the proposals and submitted to an international jury.
