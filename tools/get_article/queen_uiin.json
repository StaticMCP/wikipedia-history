Her father, Park Eung-sun, was a member of the Bannam Park clan. Her mother was a member of the Jeonju Yi clan. She had a younger brother.\nThrough her mother, Lady Park was a first cousin fifth times removed of her future husband, King Seonjo. King Seonjo and Lady Park both share King Sejong as their ancestor as he's their 5th great-grandfather. King Seonjo's father, Internal Grand Prince Deokheung, was the 3rd great-grandson of King Sejong, and King Seonjo's mother, Internal Grand Princess Consort Hadong, was also the 3rd great-granddaughter of King Sejong.\nThrough her maternal 3rd great-grandmother, she was also a 4th great-granddaughter of Han Hwak and a 3rd great-grandniece of Queen Sohye; the mother of King Seongjong and daughter of Han Hwak.\nHer first cousin, Park Mi, eventually became the 5th great-grandfather of Park Myeong-won; the husband of Princess Hwapyeong who was the eldest daughter of King Yeongjo and Royal Noble Consort Yeong.\nLife as queen consort\nShe became queen consort at the age of 15 in 1569 when she married the 17-year-old King Seonjo. Her mother was given the royal title of \"Internal Princess Consort Wansan\" () and her father being given the title of \"Internal Prince Banseong\" ().\nShe was unable to bear children, and her husband went to concubines to produce heirs.
