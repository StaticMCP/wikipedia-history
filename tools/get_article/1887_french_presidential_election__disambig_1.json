The elections were triggered by the resignation of President Jules Grevy.\nBackground\nThe election was triggered by the resignation of President Grevy, which resulted from the decorations scandal of 1887. This scandal forced Prime Minister Maurice Rouvier into resignation, with no other figure agreeing to be appointed by Grevy as the next prime minister. This caused a government crisis which forced Grevy to resign. The French National Assembly met for a joint sitting on December 3 to elect a new president.\nElection\nJules Ferry, the former prime minister, was initially seen as the front-runner in the race due to his name recognition and experience, but the more-left wing Republicans disliked him. The Radicals within the Assembly, led by Georges Clemenceau, backed an outsider in the form of former Finance Minister Sadi Carnot.\nConservative Monarchists within the assembly rallied behind General .\nOn the first ballot, Carnot came in first with 303 votes (35.69%) while Ferry came in second place with just 212 (24.97%). Both had come short of the majority needed. Seeing he had been outflanked, Ferry withdrew from the race and Carnot was easily elected president on the second ballot with 616 votes (74.49%)\nResults\n|party3=Military|votes3=148|votes3_2=188\n|cand4=Charles de Freycinet|party4=Moderate Republicans|votes4=76|votes4_2=5\n|cand5=Félix Antoine Appert|party5=Moderate Republicans|votes5=72|votes5_2=5\n|cand6=Henri Brisson|party6=Republican Union|votes6=26\n|cand7=Charles Floquet|party7=Radical Left|votes7=5|votes7_2=1\n|cand8=Anatole de La Forge|party8=Radical Left|votes8=2\n|cand9=Félix Pyat|party9=Far-left|votes9=2|votes9_2=1\n|cand10=Louis Pasteur|party10=Independent|votes10=2\n|cand11=Eugène Spuller|party11=Moderate Republicans|votes11=1\n|invalid=3|invalid2=15\n|electorate=852|electorate2=842\n|source=MJP Journal officiel\n}}\nReferences"
