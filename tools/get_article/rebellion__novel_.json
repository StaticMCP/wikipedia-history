The novel was published in the newspaper Vorwärts from 27 July to 29 August 1924. It has been adapted for television twice: in 1962 by Wolfgang Staudte, and in 1993 by Michael Haneke.\nReception\nNicholas Lezard of The Guardian reviewed the book in 2000: \"Roth's tale has that very European, straightforward, fairy-tale logic that makes everything both inevitable yet strangely nightmarish. You wouldn't be far wrong to think of Roth as occupying the fourth corner of a square whose other apices are Kafka, Musil and Stefan Zweig.\" Lezard continued: \"At one or two points the novel leaps into strange, almost magical-realist territory; not a term I like much, but it suggests the sense of dreamlike dislocation you feel from time to time while reading. This portrait of one of the shards of a splintering society is deceptively simple, but will haunt you for a long time afterwards.\"\nIn 2021 the Irish writer Hugo Hamilton published a novel entitled The Pages. It is a story told from the perspective of a book, a first edition of Roth’s The Rebellion.\nSee also\n* 1924 in literature\n* Austrian literature\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4260/1 Rebellion] at Projekt Gutenberg-DE"
