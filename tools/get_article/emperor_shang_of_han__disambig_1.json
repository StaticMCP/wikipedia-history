Liu Hu ascended to the throne when Emperor Shang died in September 106; however, Dowager Deng still remained as the regent for the teenager Emperor An. A decree by Empress Dowager Deng during this reign shed light on bureaucratic inefficiency.\nEmperor Shang's reign, like his father's before him, was once again marred by corrupt eunuchs interfering themselves in important matters of state.\nEarly life\nPrince Liu Long was born in autumn 105 to Emperor He and a concubine whose identity is unknown. Because Emperor He had, during his reign, frequently lost sons due to childhood illnesses, according to the superstitions of the time, both Prince Long and his older brother Prince Sheng were given to foster parents outside the palace to nurture.\nWhen Emperor He died in February 106, his wife, Empress Deng Sui, brought the young princes back to the palace. Prince Sheng was older but regarded as frequently ill and unfit for the throne; therefore  Empress Deng created the infant Prince Long crown prince and soon after had him proclaimed Emperor Shang, with Empress Deng acting as empress dowager.\nReign\nAfter Emperor Shang was proclaimed emperor, his brother Prince Sheng was created the Prince of Pingyuan.\nConcerned that Emperor Shang might not live long, Empress Dowager Deng also kept Liu Hu () – the twelve-year-old cousin of the young emperor and future Emperor An of Han – in the capital Luoyang as insurance against the emperor's death. Prince Hu was viewed by some as the rightful heir to Emperor He, as he was the son of Prince Qing of Qinghe, who was once a crown prince under Emperor He's father Emperor Zhang but was deposed due to machinations of Emperor Zhang's wife Empress Dou.\nAs Emperor Shang was an infant, actual and formal power were vested with Empress Dowager Deng. Her brother Deng Zhi () became the most powerful official in the imperial government. During the short reign, Empress Dowager Deng issued a general pardon to those who had had rights stripped from them for associating with the family of Empress Dou.\nDeath\nIn September 106, Emperor Shang died. The officials had by this time realized that his older brother, Prince Sheng, was not as ill as originally thought and therefore wanted to make him emperor. However, Empress Dowager Deng was concerned that Prince Sheng might bear a grudge at not being made emperor before his brother, and therefore insisted on making Emperor Shang's cousin, Prince Hu, emperor instead.\nEmperor Shang, having died as a toddler, was not given a separate tomb, as is customary for emperors. Rather, in order to avoid unnecessary expenses, he was buried in the same tomb complex as his father Emperor He.\nPrince Hu ascended to the throne – with the posthumous name \"Emperor An\" – when Emperor Shang died in 106; however, Dowager Deng still remained as the regent for the teenager Emperor An. A decree by Empress Dowager Deng during this reign shed light on bureaucratic inefficiency.\nEra name\n* Yanping () 106\nSee also\n* Family tree of the Han dynasty\nReferences"
