The sportspeople are competing two sports: para-alpine skiing and sledge hockey. There were 24 sportspeople, 16 support people and 4 administrators.  First allocated four sports in para-alpine skiing, the country won two more spots and are sending six skiers.  The sledge hockey team goes to South Korea after qualifying at a tournament in Sweden.  They had financial difficulties before the Winter Paralympics because of corruption in sports funding.  This made it more difficult to train and compete for the 2018 Games.\nTeam\nIn June 2017, the Executive Committee of the Czech Paralympic Committee (ČPV) was told by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) they had been given four spots to send people to the 2018 Winter Paralympics to compete in para-alpine skiing.  Three of these spots were for men, and one was for a woman.  Patrik Hetmer was the first skier to be nominated for inclusion on the 2018 team going to Pyeongchang.  In September 2017,  Pavel Bambousek, Miroslav Lidinský and Anna Pešková seemed to be the most likely skiers to be named to the team in para-alpine skiing.  The full team was named by the ČPV on 6 February 2018.  It included people in two sports: para-alpine skiing and sledge hockey. There were 24 sportspeople, 16 support people and 4 administrators. Anička Pešková was the only woman representing the Czech Republic in Pyeongchang.  The team included 6 alpine-skiers and their 2 guides. Tomáš Vaverka, who competed at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in snowboarding, was selected to compete in para-alpine skiing.\nThe group was scheduled to fly to South Korea on 3 March 2018.\nThe table below contains the list of members of people (called \"Team Czech Republic\") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Team Czech Republic\n!Name\n!Sport\n!Gender\n!Classification\n!Events\n!ref\n|-\n|Pavel Bambousek\n|para-alpine skiing\n|male\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Pavel Doležal\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Michal Geier\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Zdeněk Hábl\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Patrik Hetmer\n|para-alpine skiing\n|male\n|vision impaired\n|\n|\n|-\n|Miroslav Hrbek\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Michaela Hubačová\n|para-alpine skiing\n|male\n|guide skier\n|\n|\n|-\n|Zdeněk Klíma\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Benjamínek Tadeáš Kříž\n|para-alpine skiing\n|male\n|vision impaired\n|\n|\n|-\n|Zdeněk Krupička\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Pavel Kubeš\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Martin Kudela\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Miroslav Lidinský\n|para-alpine skiing\n|male\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Miroslav Máčka\n|para-alpine skiing\n|male\n|guide skier\n|\n|\n|-\n|David Motyčka\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Radim Nevrlý\n|para-alpine skiing\n|male\n|guide skier\n|\n|\n|-\n|Martin Novák\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|David Palat\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Anička Pešková\n|para-alpine skiing\n|female\n|vision impaired\n|\n|\n|-\n|Jiří Raul\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Zdeněk Šafránek\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|-\n|Tomáš Vaverka\n|para-alpine skiing\n|male\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Karel Wagner\n|sledge hockey\n|male\n|sledge hockey minimum disability open class\n|mixed team\n|\n|}\nPara-alpine skiing\nQualification\nIn June 2017, the Executive Committee of the Czech Paralympic Committee (ČPV) was told by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) they had been given four spots to send people to the 2018 Winter Paralympics to compete in para-alpine skiing.

This was to prepare for their first races, which took place in November in Landgraaf, Netherlands.  After that, the team went Pitztal to race.\nSupport\nHealth Care in the Hradec Králové supported Czech para-alpine skiers before Winter Games.  This program was supervised by  Deputy Governor for Health Care Ing. Aleš Cabicar. She said, \"The project of the handicapped skiers center is known, especially their teaching program, which they realize in the Krkonoše Mountains. I am very glad that successful athletes are being prepared in our region to achieve great results. When the representatives of the Center approached me with the request for support and support, I did not hesitate and I am glad that the Hradec Králové Region is one of the partners of the Czech representatives.\"\nSkiers\nPatrik Hetmer was the first skier to be nominated for inclusion on the 2018 team going to Pyeongchang.

Corruption in the Czech Republic involving subsidies for sport resulted in the national team getting less money to support their training and ability to compete in tournaments. FAČR Chairman Miroslav Pelta was arrested as part of the corruption issues.  About the corruption, team captain Zdeněk Šafránek said, \"The subsidy scandal has radically reduced the amount we receive. For the sake of illustration, the Czech Paralympic Committee has now gotten less money than last year's sledge hockey players, and it has to be divided into a lot of sports.\"  The team could not buy time to use ice at skating rinks to train much before their final qualifying competition in Sweden. They also could not buy new equipment like sledges, hockey sticks or hockey gloves. To make sure they were ready to qualify, the captain thought the team needed around 1 million Czech Koruna () to pay for all the costs of training and traveling.  Because they could not get funding from the government, players had to ask individuals to support them financially.\nThe team went to Nagano to compete in a tournament in February 2018 to prepare for the Games.\nQualification\nJapan, Sweden and the Czech Republic were the last 3 teams that were able to go to the 2018 Games. They could go because of how they finished at the Qualification Tournament in October in Ostersund, Sweden in October 2017.  Teams participating in the tournament included Sweden, Germany, Slovakia, Japan and Great Britain.\n;Preliminary round\n;5–8th place semifinal\n;Fifth place game\nMedia coverage\nSome of the Paralympics would be broad on television by ČT TV and ČT Sport.  Live streaming of the Winter Games was also made available free on ČT Sport's website.\nReferences"
