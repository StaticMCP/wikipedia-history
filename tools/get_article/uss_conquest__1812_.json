D. Elliott, Conquest cruised constantly on Lake Ontario during the War of 1812, taking part in the attacks on Kingston on 9 December 1812; York (now Toronto) on 27 April 1813; and Fort George on 27 May 1813. She joined in the engagements with the British squadron of 7 to 11 August, 11 and 28 September 1813.\nShe was laid up at Sacketts Harbor, New York, at the end of the war and sold there in May 1815.\nReferences"
