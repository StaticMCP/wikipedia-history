It is the 21st most populated country in the world and has a population density of |/km2|/mi2|disp=preunit|people&nbsp;|people|}}, with England having significantly greater density than Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Almost a third of the population lives in south east England, which is predominantly urban and suburban, with  people in the capital city, London, whose population density was |PD/km2}} in .\nThe population of the UK has undergone demographic transition— from a typically pre-industrial population, with high birth and mortality rates and slow population growth, through a stage of falling mortality and faster rates of population growth, to a stage of low birth and mortality rates with, again, lower rates of growth. This growth through 'natural change' has been accompanied in the past three decades by growth through net immigration into the United Kingdom, which since 1999 has exceeded natural change.\nThe United Kingdom's high literacy rate of 99% at age 15 and above, is attributable to universal state education, introduced at the primary level in 1870 (Scotland 1872, free 1890) and at the secondary level in 1900. Parents are obliged to have their children educated from the ages of 5 to 16 years. In England, 16–17-year olds should remain in education, employment or training in the form of A-Levels, vocational training, and apprenticeships, until the age of 18.\nThe United Kingdom's population is predominantly White British (75.98% at the 2021 Census), but due to migration mostly from Commonwealth nations, Britain has become ethnically diverse. The second and third largest non-white racial groups are Asian British at 8.6% of the population, followed by Black British people at 3.71%.\nThe main language of the United Kingdom is British English. Scots is widely spoken in many parts of Scotland, as is Scottish Gaelic, a Celtic language. Cornish and Irish have been revived to a limited degree in Cornwall and Northern Ireland, but the predominant language in all these areas is English. Welsh is widely spoken as a first language in parts of North and West Wales, and to lesser extent in South East Wales, where English is the dominant first language.\nHistory\nBefore the census, 200–1800\nRoman Britain had an estimated population between 2.8&nbsp;million and 3 million at the end of the second century AD. At the end of the fourth century, it had an estimated population of 3.6&nbsp;million, of whom 125,000 consisted of the Roman army and their families and dependents. The urban population of Roman Britain was about 240,000 people at the end of the fourth century. Roman Britain's capital city, Londinium, is estimated to have had a population of about 60,000.\nFollowing the Roman withdrawal from Britain, Germanic tribes from continental Europe such as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes began a period of significant migration to the southeastern part of the island, notably bringing their language, Old English. Nevertheless, the overall population is believed to have fallen precipitously due to political upheavals and plagues. By the time of the compilation of the Domesday Book in the eleventh century, there may have between 1.25 and 2 million people living in England. Though the Domesday Book did not count the English population, it has been regarded as one of the first attempts to produce a census of the country.\nBetween the years of 1086 and 1750, the English population fluctuated in size due to civil war, famines and plagues. By the end of the 13th century, the population was estimated to have reached between four and six million people. A combination of factors such as widespread famine and disease in the following century collapsed the population dramatically. An agricultural crisis in 1315 to 1322 and the Black Death in 1348 to 1350 collapsed the population by over a third of its pre-existing number, and the growth rate. In 1377, the population was estimated via a poll-tax of all people aged 14 and over, depending on the population amount of those under 14, to be around 2.2&nbsp;million to 3.1&nbsp;million.\nPeriods of instability over the 15th century, such as the Wars of the Roses, caused the population to increase at a slower pace. The general factors behind this were a high mortality rate due to war, fewer marriages within the population, late marriages (keeping fertility levels low) and a net emigration of English people out of the country. By the 16th century, the situation had changed due to political stability under the Tudor monarchy and little civil unrest, which would have resulted in a higher mortality rate. While this was overturned with the English Civil War in 17th century, it allowed the population to grow at a faster pace, causing the population of England to reach a pre-collapse total of 5.74&nbsp;million by 1750.\nIn Scotland, population growth was not to the same extent as it was in England, which resulted in being significantly lower in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, which is often ascribed to similar factors halting it such as a high mortality rate, especially for infants, and later marriage and childbearing patterns. Ireland before the 19th century consistently had rapid population growth, which has been ascribed to higher fertility rates and earlier age of marriage than in England. The Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century also affected the population of Scotland, with an estimated 100,000 Scots migrating to Ulster. The Jacobite rebellion in 1745 also caused significant emigration. The estimated population total of Scotland in 1691 was 1.23&nbsp;million.\nThe impetus to collect population data was reinforced due to food supply concerns and war against France in the late 18th century and the beginning of the early 19th century. In 1800, the Census Act was passed, authorising the first modern census in British history to be conducted.\nCensus established and the demographic transition, 1800–2000\nThe first Census in 1801 revealed that the population of Great Britain was 10.5&nbsp;million. England's population was 8.3&nbsp;million, Wales' population was 0.6&nbsp;million, and Scotland had a population of 1.6&nbsp;million. In Ireland, the population was between 4.5 and 5.5&nbsp;million inhabitants. Since 1801, a census has been conducted almost every decade. In Ireland, it was conducted for the first time in 1821.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, the demographic transition started in the United Kingdom, going from a pre-industrial society demographically to an industrialised society. At the 1841 Census, the population of England and Wales was 15.9&nbsp;million, having doubled in the space of 40 years. Ireland had 8.2&nbsp;million and Scotland had 2.6&nbsp;million. The slightly lower rate of growth for Scotland may be attributed to higher net emigration of Scottish people out of the nation, and two typhus epidemics in 1837 and 1847.\nFactors often associated with the beginning of the demographic transition began to change dramatically as well, which contributed to the rapid increase. For example, child mortality decreased dramatically: the proportion of children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749, to 31.8% in 1810–1829. General mortality was thought to have declined as well, especially after 1850. This, as well as an increased birth rate, caused the English population to sustain itself in the second phase of the transition from 1750 to 1870.\nIn the second half of the 19th century the population of England continued to grow quickly, from 16.8&nbsp;million in 1851 to 30.5&nbsp;million in 1901. This rapid growth was seen in the other constituent nations. In Wales, the population increased from 0.6&nbsp;million in 1801, to 2 million in 1901. In Scotland, the population increased from 1.6&nbsp;million in 1801, to 4.5&nbsp;million in 1901. In contrast, the Great Irish Famine, which began in the 1840s, caused the deaths of 1 million Irish people, and caused well over a million to emigrate.\nMass emigration became entrenched as a result of the famine, and Ireland's population decreased rapidly, from 8.2&nbsp;million in 1841 to 3.2&nbsp;million in 1901. This massive population collapse did not affect Northern Ireland to the same extent, as it was more industrialised and urbanised. While the Northern Ireland population declined, it recovered by the beginning of the 20th century. This prolonged period of emigration and net population decline in Irish history was not reversed until the middle of the 20th century.\nThe total fertility rate of the UK population declined from 4.88 children per woman in 1871, to 2.4 by 1921, representing a transition to the third stage of the demographic transition. Traditional means of birth control, such as abstinence and withdrawal, facilitated the collapse of the birth rate. By the 1930s, this was hastened by more modern methods of contraception, which were beginning to gain increased acceptance. From 1840 to 1930 there was a net emigration of English people out of the country, which scaled back population growth.\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the United Kingdom began to approach the fourth stage of the demographic transition. The deaths of troops in the First World War, coupled with the 1918 influenza outbreak, are estimated to have totalled over 900,000 deaths in the United Kingdom. This reduced the male population of the Lost Generation and altered the sex ratio, which slowed the growth rate of the population. By the end of the Second World War, the fourth stage transition was completed. There was a low but fluctuating birth rate, a low death rate and a slower population growth rate. The British Nationality Act 1948 allowed many people from the British Empire's colonies to migrate to the country, being classed in nationality as the same as a native of the United Kingdom. This law, while an unintentional side-effect, led to the start of modern immigration to the United Kingdom.\nIn the 1960s, there was also major social change in the United Kingdom. Liberalisation of society led to the Abortion Act 1967, which legalised abortion in the United Kingdom for the first time, and the Divorce Reform Act 1969, which made divorce easier. Between these years, the population fluctuated: from the 1950s onwards the population increased through natural growth. By the mid-1970s, the population decreased due to emigration, which took net migration to a negative, and deaths exceeded births. For the first time in 1973, the birth rate of the country fell below replacement level. By the 1980s, the decline of population growth had recovered to an extent due to a reversal of net emigration.\nIn the 1990s, international migration began to contribute more to population growth. In 1998, this overtook natural increase as the main cause of growth. Liberalisation of immigration rules under the Blair government allowed a rapid increase of the number of migrants arriving, quadrupling the number from a net migration rate of 50,000 a year, to 200,000 a year.\nModern century, 2000–present\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, the population of the United Kingdom was 59,113,000 people. In each constituent nation, the population of England was 49,449,700, Scotland had a population of 5,064,200, Wales had a population of 2,910,200 and Northern Ireland a population of 1,689,300. Increased international migration, which began to rapidly increase at the end of the 20th century brought increased ethnic heterogenization to the British population, in ethnicity and race, and country of birth.\nIn 2001, the White British population was registered to be 88.52% of the total population. In 2011, this proportion of the population had dropped to 81.88%. Other ethnic groups rose by 50% of their respective total population in 2001, or doubled entirely.\nSuch rapid immigration growth boosted population growth in the United Kingdom. In 2011, the population was around 63 million people.\nPopulation\nThe population of the UK in the last recorded census in 2011 was 63 million, of whom 31&nbsp;million were male and 32&nbsp;million female. The 2011 census recorded the population of England as 53.0&nbsp;million, Scotland as 5.3&nbsp;million, Wales as 3.1&nbsp;million, and Northern Ireland as 1.8&nbsp;million. At the last recorded population estimate, it was estimated that the UK population was at a total of 67,081,234 people.\nThere are 13 urban areas that exceed 500,000 inhabitants: they are centred on London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds and Bradford, Southampton and Portsmouth, Sheffield, Liverpool, Leicester, Manchester, Belfast, Bristol, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Nottingham.\nPopulation by constituent country\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+Population distribution across the UK\n! class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=2| Constituentcountry\n! colspan=2|Population (mid-2024)\n! colspan=2|Area\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" rowspan=2| Population density (per km2 (per mi2))\n|-\n!

However, since the Second World War, population projections have taken an expanded role in all areas of influencing government policy. The GAD produced population projections every year from 1955 to 1979 and then switched it to every 2 years up to 1991. The Office for National Statistics took control of producing population projections for the country in 2006.\nThe British Office for National Statistics' 2016-based National Population Projections indicated that, if recent trends continue, the UK's population would increase by 3.6&nbsp;million between mid-2016 and mid-2026. This represents an average annual growth rate of 0.5%. Over the same period, the population of England is projected to grow by 5.9%; for Wales, this figure is 3.1%, while for Scotland and Northern Ireland the figures are 3.2% and 4.2% respectively. These projections did not allow for any possible effects of the UK leaving the European Union.\nFertility\nSince 1838 it has been compulsory to register a birth or death in the United Kingdom.\nOfficial data on the fertility rate of the country was first made available in 1938, However, it is possible to estimate the total fertility rate (TFR) from 1541 onwards.\nThe fertility rate of the United Kingdom before the 19th century remained at around 5 children per woman. This rate has been falling since 1870, when the country began into transition into the third stage of the demographic transition. This transition represents the change in reproductive strategy from how many children a mother 'needs' to how many she 'wants', and a substitution of quality over quantity in the offspring produced. From the 1880s onwards, the birth rate began to decline rapidly from its previous levels. In England the rate declined by 44% between 1875 and 1920.\nThe decline has been attributed to a number of factors, including biological, technological, societal socio-economic reasons and cultural trends. The Industrial Revolution led to large scale movements of people to high density urban population centres; income per capita rose significantly especially in the last half of the 19th century, while economic growth improved the livelihoods of the working and middle classes. This growth in the standard of living led also reduced mortality rates (which had been in decline since the early 18th century) and especially in infant mortality. The decline of child labour at the same time meant there was less economic need for a large number of children. Educational standards improved during the same time period, which gave children more economical potential.\nThe increasing number of women in the workforce in the 19th century also contributed to the birth rate decline.\nImprovements in nutrition, which are linked to biological factors such as a decline in lactation, have also been cited as a potential factor in the decline of the fertility rate. Technological developments also began to have an effect; contraceptives became more usable in the latter half of the 19th century due to developments in the production of rubber. Abortion, while illegal, was also used, though the extent is unknown.\nA decline in religious adherence during the 19th century (despite a shortage of data) has also been considered as a reason. While there is debate among demographers as to the relative importance of these factors, it is generally accepted that the combined effect was that mothers could begin to invest more time and nurture 'quality' into their offspring rather than having an increased 'quantity' of children, and that this led to the decrease of the total fertility rate.\nBy 1914, the birthrate was around 2.88 children per woman, but by 1918 this had collapsed by almost 50% due to World War One and sank to 2.03 children. In the post-World War One period, while the birthrate initially boomed reaching a peak of 3.08 children in 1920, this was followed by a rapid decline and had slumped to historic lows by the 1930s, for the first time in the country's history falling below a replacement level fertility rate. The rate did not recover until the end of the Second World War in 1945.\nIn the post-World War Two period, the fertility rate of the country boomed once again, reaching levels not seen since the late 19th century. This peaked in 1964, with a TFR of 2.95. However, by 1973, the fertility rate of the country again dropped below replacement levels, and has continued to decline until the present day.\nIt is said that the sub-replacement level fertility rate is not viewed by the government as  a major issue. Little incentive has been provided to increase the birth rate throughout the UK's post war period. Compared to other countries in Western European, the United Kingdom's rate remains relatively high.\nFamily planning policies were enacted during the 1970s as a result of the rapid population growth during the 1960s. The 1973 NHS Reorganisation Act is one example: this Act made family planning advice and supplies available to the public. With previous liberalising acts such as the Abortion Act and the Divorce Reform Act, and scientific developments such as increased access to contraceptive methods such as the contraceptive pill, it is generally accepted that these social changes contributed to the decline of the fertility rate below replacement level in the latter half of the 20th century. With these changes also, pre-marital conceptions fell to 1950 levels by the late 1970s. This decline in the birth rate follows a similar pattern to other European countries.\nThe government's position was explained in 1984 at the UN Conference on Population in Mexico;The United Kingdom government does not pursue a population policy in the sense of actively trying to influence the overall size of the population, its age structure, or the components of change except in the field of immigration. Nor has it expressed a view about the size of population, or the age structure, that would be desirable... The current level of births has not been the cause of general anxiety. The prevailing view is that decisions about fertility and childbearing are for people themselves to make, but that it is proper for government to provide individuals with the information and the means necessary to make their decisions effective. To this end, the government provides assistance with family planning as part of the National Health Service. The ageing of the population does raise social and economic issues. However, it is believed that these will prove manageable; and also, to a degree, that society will adapt...’ In 2003, Right to Request was setup which allowed the parents of small children to request flexible working times which included shorter working hours for parents to care for their children. However, a report in 2006 found that its impact was negligible as mothers tended to switch employers to get reduced hours regardless.\nMigration in the late 1990s and 2000s led to the overall total fertility rate of the country rising by 0.1% between 2004 and 2011.\nIn 2012, the UK's total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.92 children per woman, below the replacement rate, which in the UK is 2.075. In 2001, the TFR was at a record low of 1.63, but it then increased every year until it reached a peak of 1.96 in 2008, before decreasing again. In 2012 and 2013, England and Wales's TFR decreased to 1.85. In Scotland however TFR was lower: it decreased from 1.75 in 2010 to 1.67 in 2012.

The family size of the average UK family can be estimated for a \"completed family size\" (CFS), which is an estimate of the amount of children a woman has birthed by the end of her childbearing years.\nFamily size within the UK has shifted towards two or one children in recent decades, rather than in the past when larger family sizes were more prominent and sought after. This pattern is similar to other European countries, where couples are having fewer children. Increasingly, there are also more couples who are completely childless; this has been increasing since the 1950s.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Development of family size distribution (percentages)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |No. of children\n! colspan=\"9\" |Years\n|-\n!1920\n!1925\n!1930\n!1935\n!1940\n!1945\n!1950\n!1955\n!1960\n|-\n|0\n|21\n|17\n|13\n|12\n|11\n|10\n|14\n|17\n|21\n|-\n|1\n|21\n|22\n|18\n|15\n|13\n|13\n|12\n|12\n|12\n|-\n|2\n|27\n|28\n|30\n|32\n|37\n|43\n|43\n|40\n|35\n|-\n|3\n|16\n|17\n|19\n|21\n|22\n|21\n|20\n|20\n|21\n|-\n|4 or more\n|15\n|16\n|20\n|20\n|17\n|13\n|11\n|11\n|11\n|-\n!Average family size(Completed family size of all women)\n!2\n!2.12\n!2.35\n!2.42\n!2.36\n!2.17\n!2.03\n!2.02\n!1.95\n|}\nLife expectancy\nLife expectancy has increased in the United Kingdom since the 18th century due to precipitate declines in child mortality, see below, and from relatively minor improvements in healthcare.  A life expectancy of 40, the historical norm, does not mean that person is likely to die at 40 years old but rather when he or she is very old or very young; much in line with a bathtub curve.\nAt the start of the 20th century, the life expectancy at birth was only 45.6 years.\nBy 1950, life expectancy at birth had risen to 68.6 years. During the latter half of the century, further factors influenced the increase of life expectancy: diseases and the improvement of healthcare in the 1950s, decline in smoking in the mid-1970s and improvements in treating heart disease in the 1990s contributed to its decline.\nAt the start of the 21st century, the life expectancy at birth was 77.8 years.\nIn 2011 the life expectancy at birth of the UK was around 80.4 years, but the rate of increase has been stalling. Potential factors behind this may be austerity measures imposed in the beginning of the 2010s, which coincidentally since then mortality rates have slowed down in decline or older people dying off at faster rates than expected. On the topic of austerity measures, Professor Richard Faragher has said that \"It is possible to have high or rising life expectancy during austerity, as is the case in Japan. Similarly, you can have rising life expectancy despite high levels of inequality – this was the case in Britain from 1900–1950.\" but noted that austerity measures to social services like the NHS, especially social care support for the elderly may be causing a stalling of life expectancy increase due to a decreased quality of life for older generations.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n! colspan=\"18\" |Life expectancy from 1543 to 2015\n|-\n! colspan=\"18\" |Years\n|-\n!1543\n!1548\n!1553\n!1558\n!1563\n!1568\n!1573\n!1578\n!1583\n!1588\n!1593\n!1603\n!1608\n!1613\n!1618\n!1623\n!1628\n!1633\n|-\n|33.9\n|38.8\n|39.6\n|22.4\n|36.7\n|39.7\n|41.1\n|41.6\n|42.7\n|37.1\n|38.1\n|38.5\n|39.6\n|36.8\n|40.3\n|33.4\n|39.7\n|39.7\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" |\n|-\n!1638\n!1643\n!1648\n!1653\n!1658\n!1663\n!1668\n!1673\n!1678\n!1683\n!1688\n!1693\n!1698\n!1703\n!1713\n!1718\n!1723\n!1728\n|-\n|34.0\n|36.3\n|39.7\n|39.1\n|33.0\n|33.3\n|33.5\n|37.4\n|32.4\n|31.3\n|35.9\n|36.5\n|38.1\n|38.5\n|36.9\n|35.8\n|35.5\n|25.3\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" |\n|-\n!1733\n!1738\n!1743\n!1748\n!1753\n!1758\n!1763\n!1768\n!1773\n!1778\n!1783\n!1788\n!1793\n!1798\n!1803\n!1808\n!1813\n!1818\n|-\n|36.3\n|35.3\n|34.3\n|36.5\n|39.8\n|38.1\n|35.4\n|36.2\n|39.1\n|37.7\n|35.8\n|39.0\n|37.9\n|38.9\n|40.0\n|40.6\n|41.3\n|40.8\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" |\n|-\n!1823\n!1828\n!1833\n!1838\n!1842\n!1843\n!1844\n!1845\n!1846\n!1847\n!1848\n!1849\n!1850\n!1851\n!1852\n!1853\n!1854\n!1855\n|-\n|40.5\n|41.4\n|40.9\n|40.6\n|41.0\n|41.6\n|41.2\n|42.2\n|40.2\n|38.5\n|39.9\n|37.7\n|42.8\n|41.0\n|40.4\n|40.0\n|39.5\n|40.7\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" |\n|-\n!1856\n!1857\n!1858\n!1859\n!1860\n!1861\n!1862\n!1863\n!1864\n!1865\n!1866\n!1867\n!1868\n!1869\n!1870\n!1871\n!1872\n!1873\n|-\n|42.5\n|40.9\n|39.5\n|40.4\n|41.9\n|41.6\n|42.1\n|40.4\n|39.6\n|39.8\n|40.1\n|42.0\n|41.7\n|41.3\n|40.6\n|41.1\n|42.7\n|43.3\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" |\n|-\n!1874\n!1875\n!1876\n!1877\n!1878\n!1879\n!1880\n!1881\n!1882\n!1883\n!1884\n!1885\n!1886\n!1887\n!1888\n!1889\n!1890\n!1891\n|-\n|42.1\n|41.5\n|42.7\n|43.7\n|42.0\n|43.5\n|43.0\n|45.1\n|44.0\n|44.0\n|43.6\n|44.6\n|44.6\n|45.1\n|46.3\n|45.9\n|44.1\n|44.4\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" |\n|-\n!1892\n!1893\n!1894\n!1895\n!1896\n!1897\n!1898\n!1899\n!1900\n!1901\n!1902\n!1903\n!1904\n!1905\n!1906\n!1907\n!1908\n!1909\n|-\n|45.6\n|44.7\n|48.3\n|45.4\n|47.1\n|46.4\n|46.1\n|45.2\n|45.6\n|46.9\n|48.3\n|49.5\n|48.1\n|49.9\n|49.6\n|50.6\n|51.0\n|51.7\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" |\n|-\n!1910\n!1911\n!1912\n!1913\n!1914\n!1915\n!1916\n!1917\n!1918\n!1919\n!1920\n!1921\n!1922\n!1923\n!1924\n!1925\n!1926\n!1927\n|-\n|53.3\n|51.2\n|54.3\n|53.4\n|53.2\n|51.2\n|54.2\n|54.2\n|47.3\n|54.3\n|57.3\n|58.1\n|57.0\n|59.3\n|58.1\n|58.4\n|59.6\n|59.0\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" |\n|-\n!1928\n!1929\n!1930\n!1931\n!1932\n!1933\n!1934\n!1935\n!1936\n!1937\n!1938\n!1939\n!1940\n!1941\n!1942\n!1943\n!1944\n!1945\n|-\n|59.9\n|57.6\n|60.8\n|60.0\n|60.5\n|60.6\n|61.3\n|62.0\n|61.8\n|62.3\n|63.2\n|63.6\n|60.9\n|61.4\n|64.0\n|64.0\n|64.8\n|65.8\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" |\n|-\n!1946\n!1947\n!1948\n!1949\n!1950\n| colspan=\"13\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|66.3\n|66.3\n|68.4\n|68.1\n|68.6\n|-\n| colspan=\"18\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |1950–55\n! colspan=\"3\" |1955–60\n! colspan=\"3\" |1960–65\n! colspan=\"3\" |1965–70\n! colspan=\"3\" |1970–75\n! colspan=\"3\" |1975–80\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |69.4\n| colspan=\"3\" |70.6\n| colspan=\"3\" |71.0\n| colspan=\"3\" |71.7\n| colspan=\"3\" |72.3\n| colspan=\"3\" |73.0\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |1980–85\n! colspan=\"3\" |1985–90\n! colspan=\"3\" |1990–95\n! colspan=\"3\" |1995–2000\n! colspan=\"3\" |2000–05\n! colspan=\"3\" |2005–10\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |74.2\n| colspan=\"3\" |75.1\n| colspan=\"3\" |76.3\n| colspan=\"3\" |77.2\n| colspan=\"3\" |78.4\n| colspan=\"3\" |79.7\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |2010–15\n| colspan=\"15\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |81.0\n|}\nInfant mortality\nInfant mortality has been on the decline since the Second Industrial Revolution, although the majority of the decline came around from the start to the end of the 20th century. In raw terms for example, infant mortality in England sat around 151 deaths to 1000 live births in 1901 but by the end of the century it had plummeted down to only 6 deaths per 1000 births.\nThere are two general lines of thought which are usually taken from into analysing the decline of infant mortality rates, the first line of thought comes from social historians, who ascribe the decline of infant mortality to social phenomenons of the time such as the need for a healthy population for the sake of the nation's fighting capabilities and political issues surrounding women. The second line of thought comes from demographers themselves which more or less ascribe the decline of infant mortality itself more to the general decline of mortality altogether in the society than any particular reason why.\nPhysical unfitness during the Boer War came into national prominence as many recruits came back to be too medically unfit for service. With this, In 1904, the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration was published which listed large amounts of details of the failings of the British population, and for that matter government, in sustaining a healthy population.\nThe current rate of infant mortality in the United Kingdom is roughly around 3.82 deaths per 1,000 live births.\nAge structure\nInterlinked with fertility and mortality, The age structure of the United Kingdom has varied with how rates of fertility and mortality have changed throughout the country's history. Due to the transition to an industrialised society, the United Kingdom has also undergone a 'demographic transition': that is to say, that it has gone from a high birth rate, high mortality rate society to a low birth rate, low mortality rate society over the space of two centuries.\nBefore the 18th century, the United Kingdom retained an age structure universal to societies in the first stage of the transition theory, with high fertility rates and high mortality rates, in the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution began, kickstarting the country's transition into the second phase: mortality rates declined but birth rates stayed at the same level; by 1870, the country had begun to transition into the third phase: the birth rate began to decline from around near 5 children per woman to below replacement level in the 1930s. The fourth phase of the transition began in the 1960s, when the fertility rate rose, and peaked during the middle of the decade, and then collapsed by 1973 to a below replacement level rate. Since then, the rate has not risen to an above replacement level fertility rate; this has resulted in a population which is currently ageing: in 2007, for the first time in the country's history, there were more people over the age of 60 than there were under the age of 16.\nPeaks and bands within the population represent different periods in which people were born, for example, a large peak of people in particularly for those aged 70–74 born following the Second World War and a wide band for those aged 50–59, born during the 1960s baby boom. Those aged 80 upwards would have been born in the 1930s baby dearth when the birth rate was below replacement level. On the younger band of the population there is a noticeable gap between the ages of 14 and 20, this due to at the beginning of the 21st century a lower number of children being born (and a subsequent lower TFR), however in the years following the birth rate rose during the 2010s and a 'broadening' of the pyramid began for those in the younger years leading to more children in those age cohorts. In relation to the sex ratio of the country, in the higher ages of the population, there are more women than men reflecting the higher life expectancies of women in the population, in the lower ages there are more men than women because there are slightly more boys than girls born each year. In relation to the older age brackets, In 2015, there were estimated to be over half a million people (556,270) aged 90 and over living in the UK, up from 194,670 people in 1985, and there were estimated to be 14,570 centenarians (people aged 100 or over) and 850 people aged 105 or over. The Office for National Statistics has also wrote in their mid-2016 report on population projections that the median age of the British population was 40 years of age, and this will continue to rise as more people in the population age and a below-replacement level fertility level not refilling the population. This will make the number of people aged 85 and over double from 1.6&nbsp;million in mid-2016 to 3.2&nbsp;million in mid-2041.\nThe demographic ageing of the population is not evenly spread geographically, as people in rural areas are typically of a higher age than those living in metropolitan areas such as Greater London for example.\nFile:England Population pyramid estimate 2020.svg|alt=| England (2020 estimate)\nFile:Scotland Population pyramid estimate 2020.svg|alt=| Scotland (2020 estimate)\nFile:Wales Population pyramid estimate 2020.svg|alt=| Wales (2020 estimate)\nFile:Northern Ireland Population pyramid estimate 2020.svg|alt=|Northern Ireland (2020 estimate)\nFile:Under 15s across the UK.svg|Under 15 years old\nFile:Working age population distributed across the UK 2021.svg|16 to 64 years old (working age)\nFile:Above the age of 65 years old across the UK.svg|Above the age of 65 years old\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Age structures 1976–2019\n! scope=\"col\" | Ages\n! scope=\"col\" | 1976\n! scope=\"col\" | 1986\n! scope=\"col\" | 1999\n! scope=\"col\" | 2016\n! scope=\"col\" | 2019\n|-\n| 0–15 years (%)\n| 24.5\n| 20.5\n| 20.4\n| 18.9\n| 19.0\n|-\n| 16–64 years (%)\n| 61.2\n| 64.1\n| 63.8\n| 63.1\n| 62.5\n|-\n| 65 years and over (%)\n| 14.2\n| 15.4\n| 15.8\n| 18.0\n| 18.5\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Median age of the population (projected)\n!Median age\n!1950\n!1960\n!1971\n!1981\n!1991\n!2000\n!2010\n!2020\n!2030\n!2040\n!2050\n!2060\n!2070\n!2080\n!2090\n!2100\n|-\n|Total\n|34.9\n|35.6\n|34.1\n|34.5\n|35.8\n|37.6\n|39.6\n|40.6\n|42.4\n|43.8\n|43.9\n|44.7\n|45.5\n|46.0\n|46.7\n|47.7\n|-\n|Male\n| –\n| –\n| –\n| –\n| –\n| –\n| –\n|39.6\n| –\n| –\n| –\n| –\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|-\n|Female\n| –\n| –\n| –\n| –\n| –\n| –\n| –\n|41.7\n| –\n| –\n| –\n| –\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|}\nUrbanisation and population density\nPopulation density\nThe United Kingdom is one of the most densely populated countries in Europe; in 2020 it was the 8th most densely populated country.\nThe current largest urban areas are listed below:\nUrbanisation\nRapid urbanisation began with the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the mid to late 18th century, shifting jobs and more importantly people away from rural Britain's dominance at the time which was primarily agricultural, to manufacturing jobs within urban areas which started to spring up. In 1750, an estimated total of around only 1 million people lived in some sort of urban area such as a town or city, which was around 1/6th of the estimated total population but a century later this had risen to 8 million people in 1850, equating to just over half of the nation.\nWhile this mass urbanisation affected pre-existing cities to a large degree such as London, smaller and 'newer' towns were in particular effected by the re-distribution of the population and exploded in raw population growth. Cities such as Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Newcastle for example had an explosive expansion in population numbers around the middle of the 19th century due to the industrial expansion of said cities bringing jobs and again people in for work. London during the 19th century become noted as the 'premier city' of the world, being the most populated city from 1825 to 1900 and being the first city in Europe and one of the first in the world to reach the figure of one million inhabitants, and then 5 million inhabitants. This urbanisation in the 19th century has had two phases. This mass influx of the population into the cities resulted in a centralisation of the population into the inner city areas however by the time of the late 19th century and early 20th century when technological advancements in transport kicked off allowing cities to expand their 'peripherals' from the inner areas to create large scale 'city regions' of their own. London in particular during the 19th century had the majority of its population within the city living in the inner centre, however by the 20th century a massive expansion of 'Outer London' began which slowly became larger in population size by the middle of the century than Inner London.\nBy the end of the 20th century the figure of urbanisation was 80% of the country. Importance in population size however of the capital declined during the latter half of the 20th century. By the end of the 20th century, London's ranking on the most populated cities of the world had fallen down to not even being in the top 20.\nThe current classification of an 'urban' area, also termed as a 'built-up area' (BUA) in the 2011 census, is a settlement which takes variables from both numerical population numbers and population density; in population numbers this is roughly more than or 10,000 people living in an area. Anything below that is classified as 'rural', having several levels of distinction to define a rural town and fringe, village or hamlet which is usually taken from population density figures. These areas are then defined within 'output areas' (OA's) themselves, which are geographic areas of the United Kingdom. The population which resides within classified 'urban' areas was 84.4% of total population in 2022 and the annual rate of urbanisation change is estimated to be around 0.8% between 2020 and 2025.\nVital statistics\nStatistics since 1838\nSources:\nNotable events in British demographics:\n* 1920 – End of First World War and Spanish flu\n* 1946–64 – Post-WWII baby boom\n* 1967 – Abortion

registered by both parents and 7% by non-married mothers who registered the birth alone.\nThis varied from each constituent nation, Wales for example had the highest births outside of marriage at 51% in 2004, In England this percentage was 42% and in Scotland 47%. Northern Ireland had the lowest of 35% in 2004.\nFile:Total number of marriages over time in the United Kingdom.svg|alt=|Number of marriages in the United Kingdom 1887–2016\nFile:Opposite sex marriage rates in England and Wales over time.svg|Opposite sex marriage rate over time in England and Wales\nFile:Divorces in England and Wales from 1858 to 2020.svg|alt=|Number of divorces in England and Wales 1858–2020\nFile:Opposite sex divorce rates over time in England and Wales.svg|Opposite sex divorce rate in England and Wales\nFile:Median age at divorce in England and Wales.svg|Median age at divorce in England and Wales\nFile:Culmulative percentage of marriages ending in divorce by year of marriage in England and Wales.svg|Culmulative percentage of marriages ending in divorce by year of marriage in England and Wales\nFile:Age structure of Never Married population group in 2021.svg|Never Married\nFile:Age structure of Married or Civil partnership population group in 2021 in England and Wales.svg|Married or in Civil partnership\nFile:Age structure of Divorced population group in 2021.svg|Divorced or dissolved Civil partnership\nFile:Age structure of Widowed population group in 2021 in England and Wales.svg|Widowed or surviving member of Civil partnership\nHousehold and family type\nFile:Total household's by type in the UK 2021.svg|alt=|Type of households out of total households in 2021\nFile:Total families by type in the UK 2021.svg|alt=|Family types out of total families in 2021\nFile:Age of people living with parents within the UK by percentage of age group.svg|Percentage of age group living with parents in 2021\nSexual orientation\nOut of the 600,000 people in the UK that applied to go to university through UCAS in 2020, 7.2%, or 40,000, described themselves as LGBT on their application form. UCAS estimates this to be a rate 2.5 times higher than the overall UK population. The UCAS report in collaboration with Stonewall also found LGBT students were more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds (compared to those who identified as heterosexual or didn't specify), have a disability (compared to non-LGBT students) and have a mental health condition (compared to non-LGBT students).\nFor the first time, the 2021 United Kingdom census included a question on sexual orientation.

Previously, this was outlawed under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and then the updated Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 which only permitted an abortion if the death of a child was \"done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother\".\nIn 2020, the number of conceptions which led to an abortion was around 25.3%\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Conceptions leading to an abortion from 1969 to 2020\n|-\n!

Irish migration from the Great Famine predominated during the 19th century. Additionally Jewish migration from Russia also arrived famously into Bethnal Green in London.\nStarting from the 1950s onwards, following on from the British Nationality Act 1948 which de jure allowed the migration of upwards 800,000,000 British subjects who were now British citizens in law, modern mass migration to the United Kingdom began. During this decade West Indians from the Caribbean, those from Jamaica and St Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica\nso on began to arrive.\nDuring the middle of the 1960s to the 1970s, migration flipped in origin to the majority of those arriving being of South Asian origin from the Indian sub-continent. Immigration restrictions, in response to the ever increasing number arriving, were introduced, such as the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 and the Immigration Act 1971.\nThrough the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, net migration to the United Kingdom was often negative in terms of numbers, with more people leaving the country, than entering in total.\nSince 1994, net migration in numbers has been in the positives, with more people entering the country, rather than leaving. Migration increased fourfold following the election of Tony Blair in 1997, immigration restrictions were undone such as the primary purpose rule.\nIn 2004, along with Ireland and Sweden, Britain was one of the only countries within the EU to not implement 'transitional controls' on migration flows from the newly joined A8 countries from Eastern Europe. Around 453,000 immigrants, which has been revised upwards in recent years, from these new counties were estimated in 2015 to have migrated to the UK.\nUnited Kingdom migration data\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+ UK Immigration Data (YE June 2012 – present)\n!

An example of recent large scale internal movement in the 21st century has been the departure of 220,000 White British Londoners to other areas of rural England and Wales over the 2000s and over the 2010s around a total of 550,000 people left the city.

According to the projections, the proportion of individuals identifying as White British is expected to decline from approximately 73% of the population to 57% by 2050, and fall below 50% by 2063, thus becoming a minority group. The report further estimates that by the end of the 21st century, the White British population may constitute around 33.7% of the total UK population.\nIt also projects a substantial increase in the share of the population comprising foreign-born individuals and second-generation immigrants—from under 20% to 33.5% within the next 25 years. By 2100, it is predicted that around 60% of the UK population will either have been born outside the United Kingdom or have at least one parent who was an immigrant.\nIn 2010, academic David Coleman produced research postulating a future demographic decline of the White British in Britain, indicating that they would become a minority in Birmingham and London during the 2020s. He also estimated that around 2056 to 2066, the trend of a declining share of the white populace will result in the United Kingdom having an overall white minority.\nIn Prospect, he outlined four projections for a majority-minority scenario within the United Kingdom;\n* If net immigration trends (in 2010) continued its overall trend of 254,000 a year and net emigration of the White British was 74,000 a year (180,000 per year), the White British would decline to 59% of the total population by 2051, 'Other Whites' projected to be at 10% and non-Whites projected to be 31% of the population. By 2066 this would inevitably lead to the White British being a minority of the population.\n* If migration to the United Kingdom was to decline to a net inflow of 80,000 per year, the White British would be 63% of the population by 2051 and would fall below 50% in 2080.\n* Using a cross-party group of MP's recommendation of 'balanced migration', where there is neither a net inflow or outflow, where immigration only consists of 74,000 a year and emigration of the White British the same, the White British would be 67% of the population by 2051 and then fall below 50% by the end of the century.\n* If there is no emigration of citizens and no immigration to the United Kingdom ('natural change' scenario), then the White British would remain at around 80% of the population by 2051 and would still remain the majority by the end of the century, albeit a reduced percentage (roughly around 75 – 70%)\n* A fifth estimate, made by the Philip Rees and the University of Leeds, estimate that if assumptions about ethnic self-identification are taken into account, and that there is a net outflow of citizens at 38,000 a year, most of which are non-white and long term net migration like mentioned turns negative, this would result in the White British remaining at around 80% of the population by 2051, 20% of which would be ethnic minorities and 15% of that 20% would be non-white.\nFile:White population over time including projections in the UK.svg|White population over time\nFile:Ethnic minority population overtime including projections to 2051.svg|Ethnic minority population (non-whites)\nReligion\nIn 2001, the question of religious adherence was asked for the first time since 1851 in the United Kingdom Census.\nThe traditional religion in the United Kingdom is Christianity. In England the established church is the Church of England (Anglican). In Scotland, the Church of Scotland, a Presbyterian Church, is regarded as the 'national church', but there is not an established church.\nIn Wales there is no established church, with the Church in Wales having been disestablished in 1920. In Ireland, the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871. In Northern Ireland and parts of Western Scotland there are lingering sectarian divides between Roman Catholic and Protestant communities.\nThe table below shows data regarding religion for the 2001, 2011 and 2021/22 censuses:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Religion\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2001\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2011\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2021/2022\n|-\n!

Some of these religions were reassigned to one of the main religions offered. In England and Wales, 241,000 people belonged to religious groups which did not fall into any of the main religions. The largest of these were Pagans (56,620), Spiritualists (39,061) and Jains (20,288). Despite its high-profile nature, there were only 2,418 Scientologists.\nThe census recorded 176,632 people stating their religion as Jedi Knight and 6,242 people as Heavy Metal after a campaign by Metal Hammer. These returns were classified as \"No religion\", along with Atheist, Agnostic, Humanist, and Free Thinker. Those who ticked Heathen, who had been categorised as \"no religion\" in 2001, were categorised as \"other\". It is unclear how the ONS treated people who ticked \"Other\" but did not write in any religion.\nIn 2012, the British Social Attitudes Survey found the highest number to be non-religious (48%) followed by Christians (46%) with another six per cent identifying otherwise. Discrepancies found between surveys may be the result of differences in phrasing, question order, and data collection method.\nFuture projections\nThe Muslim population in the United Kingdom, currently estimated at approximately 7% of the population, is projected to increase significantly in the coming decades. According to recent demographic forecasts, the proportion of Muslims in the UK is expected to rise to 11.2% within the next 25 years and to 19.2% by the end of the 21st century.\nUnder a “high Muslim migration scenario”—in which the UK experiences sustained above-average levels of immigration from Muslim-majority countries—the proportion of Muslims in the population could reach 25% by 2100. In this scenario, it is further projected that nearly one in three individuals under the age of 40 could identify as Muslim by the end of the century.\nIn 2017, Pew Research Center found that by 2050, in all scenarios, the Muslim population of the United Kingdom will rise. Depending on the scenario, the percentage of the population in 2050 which will be Muslim will either be 9.7% in a zero migration scenario, 16.7% in a medium migration scenario or 17.2% in a high migration scenario.\nLanguages\nThe United Kingdom's de facto official language is English, which is spoken as a first language by 95% of the population. Six regional languages—Scots, Ulster-Scots, Welsh, Cornish, Irish and Scottish Gaelic—are protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Abilities in these languages, other than Cornish, for those aged three and above were recorded in the 2011 census as follows.\nRegional languages\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n! rowspan=\"4\" |Ability\n! colspan=\"10\" |2011\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Wales\n! colspan=\"4\" |Scotland\n! colspan=\"4\" |Northern Ireland\n|-\n!colspan=2|Welsh\n!colspan=2|Scottish Gaelic\n!colspan=2|Scots\n!colspan=2|Irish\n!colspan=2|Ulster-Scots\n|-\n!Number!!%\n!Number!!%\n!Number!!%\n!Number!!%\n!Number!!%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Understands but does not speak, read or write\n| 157,792  ||\n| 23,357 ||\n| 267,412 ||\n| 70,501 ||\n| 92,040 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Speaks, reads and writes\n| 430,717 ||\n| 32,191 ||\n| 1,225,622 ||\n| 71,996 ||\n| 17,228 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Speaks but does not read or write\n| 80,429 ||\n| 18,966 ||\n| 179,295 ||\n| 24,677 ||\n| 10,265 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Speaks and reads but does not write\n| 45,524 ||\n| 6,218 ||\n| 132,709 ||\n| 7,414 ||\n| 7,801 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Reads but does not speak or write\n| 44,327 ||\n| 4,646 ||\n| 107,025 ||\n| 5,659 ||\n| 11,911 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Other combination of skills\n| 40,692 ||\n| 1,678 ||\n| 17,381 ||\n| 4,651 ||\n| 95 ||\n|-\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| No skills\n| 2,263,975 ||\n| 5,031,167 ||\n| 3,188,779 ||\n| 1,550,813 ||\n| 1,595,507 ||\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Total\n| 3,063,456 ||\n| 5,118,223 ||\n| 5,118,223 ||\n| 1,735,711 ||\n| 1,735,711 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Can speak\n| 562,016 ||\n| 57,602 ||\n| 1,541,693 ||\n| 104,943 ||\n| 35,404 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Has some ability\n| 799,481 ||\n| 87,056 ||\n| 1,929,444 ||\n| 184,898 ||\n| 140,204 ||\n|}\nCornish is spoken by around 2,500 people.

Education is mandatory from the ages of 5 to 18. The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools, only a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Despite a fall in actual numbers, the proportion of children in England attending private schools rose slightly from 7.1% to 7.3% between 2004 and 2007.\nScotland first legislated for universal provision of education in 1696. Four per cent of children in Scotland attend private schools, a rate which has remained relatively stable since 2015.\nIn Wales, one of the most notable distinctive features of education in Wales is the emphasis on the Welsh language – lessons in which are compulsory for all until the age of 16. A significant minority of students (15.7% in the 2014\\15 academic year) were taught primarily through the medium of Welsh.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Level of qualification\n! colspan=\"6\" |England and Wales (aged 16 and over, not in education)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |2001\n! colspan=\"2\" |2011\n! colspan=\"2\" |2021\n|-\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n|-\n|No qualifications\n|10,937,042\n|29.1\n|10,307,327\n|22.7%\n|8,827,472\n|18.2%\n|-\n|Level 1 and entry level qualifications\n|6,230,033\n|16.6\n|6,047,384\n|13.3%\n|4,679,223\n|9.6%\n|-\n|Level 2 qualifications\n|7,288,074\n|19.4\n|6,938,433\n|15.3%\n|6,493,490\n|13.4%\n|-\n|Apprenticeship\n|–\n|–\n|1,631,777\n|3.6%\n|2,590,252\n|5.3%\n|-\n|Level 3 qualifications\n|3,110,135\n|8.3\n|5,617,802\n|12.3%\n|8,225,629\n|16.9%\n|-\n|Level 4 qualifications or above\n|7,432,962\n|19.8\n|12,383,477\n|27.2%\n|16,413,231\n|33.8%\n|-\n|Other qualifications\n|2,609,192\n|6.9\n|2,570,580\n|5.7%\n|1,337,076\n|2.8%\n|-\n!Total\n!37,607,438\n!100%\n!45,496,780\n!100%\n!48,566,373\n!100%\n|}\nSee also\n*Demographics of England\n*Demographics of Scotland\n*Demographics of Wales\n*Demographics of Northern Ireland\n*Demographics of London\n*Demographics of Birmingham\n*Demographics of Liverpool\n*Demographics of Greater Manchester\n*Demographics of Tees Valley\n*City status in the United Kingdom\n*List of cities in the United Kingdom\n*List of UK city regions by population\n*List of urban areas in the United Kingdom\n*Genetic history of the British Isles\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/census2001.asp Census 2001 website]\n*Abstract (1833).
