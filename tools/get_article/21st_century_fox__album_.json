The eurodance-pop album was released by Ichiban Records in 1997. The title is a play on major film studio 20th Century Fox.\nAt the time of the album's release, the studio's parent company was News Corporation, although in 2013 it became part of a new parent company with the same name as this album (21st Century Fox).\nBackground\nAfter a six-year hiatus, Samantha Fox returned to the studio to record her fifth album, 21st Century Fox. She had a new look and a new style in music. In fact, this album focused on the dance genre and was a big hit in clubs around Europe. The first song released was \"Deeper\", which was unsuccessful, though receiving a lot of airplay. She released her first single, \"Let Me Be Free\", which marked a comeback for her, charting in some European countries. The video shows Fox in the box ring with a male lover. Further singles were the Latin-flavoured \"The Reason Is You (One on One)\" and \"Perhaps\". She described the album as \"more personal\" than her previous work.\nTrack listings\nWatching You, Watching Me\nA remixed version of 21st Century Fox was released by Phantom Records as Watching You, Watching Me in 2002.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
