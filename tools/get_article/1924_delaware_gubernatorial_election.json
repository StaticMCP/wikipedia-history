Robinson\n| after_party = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\nThe 1924 Delaware gubernatorial election was held on November 4, 1924. Republican Governor William D. Denney declined to seek re-election, and the Republican state convention unanimously named banker Robert P. Robinson as its nominee; Robinson emerged as a compromise selection.\nOn the Democratic side, several candidates announced their candidacies prior to the convention and a difficult, protracted fight for the nomination developed. Joseph Bancroft, a prominent industrialist, and Josiah Marvel, emerged as the frontrunners. Bancroft won the nomination at the convention after nine ballots; an effort was made to nominate him by acclamation, but Marvel's supporters objected.\nIn the general election, Robinson defeated Bancroft by a wide margin, winning 59% of the vote to Bancroft's 40%. Robinson's landslide victory occurred as President Calvin Coolidge was overwhelmingly winning the state over his opponents, Democrat John W. Davis and Progressive Robert M. La Follette.\nGeneral election\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Delaware House Journal, 100th General Assembly, 1st Reg. Sess. (1925)."
