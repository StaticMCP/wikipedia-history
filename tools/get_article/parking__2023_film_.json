Produced by Passion Studios and Soldiers Factory, the film stars Harish Kalyan, M. S. Bhaskar and Indhuja Ravichandran. In the film, a newly married couple relocate to a new house, but face escalating tensions with a neighbour over a parking.\nParking was theatrically released on 1 December 2023. The film received positive reviews from critics, although it's box office performance was affected by the aftermath of Cyclone Michaung. It won three National Film Awards: Best Tamil Feature Film, Best Supporting Actor (Bhaskar) and Best Tamil Screenplay (Ramkumar).\nPlot\nEshwar, a 28-year old IT professional, and his pregnant wife, Aathika, rent the first floor of a house. Ilamparuthi, the Executive Officer (EO) of Kundrathur Town Panchayat, lives in the ground floor with his wife, Selvi, and daughter, Aparna. Ilamparuthi is an old-fashioned man in contrast to Eshwar. Despite these differences, the two families initially get along well until Eshwar buys a new car for his wife to travel in comfortably. Ilamparuthi, who has lived in the house for the last ten years and has kept the entire parking space to himself since he and the previous first floor tenants never owned a car, is not comfortable with Eshwar's car parked in the parking space. After a couple of incidents, both begin to fight for rights over the parking space. Ilamparuthi sells his motorbike and buys a car just to ensure that Eshwar does not park his car in the parking space.\nA cat-and-mouse game begins between Eshwar and Ilamparuthi over the parking space, which culminates with Ilamparuthi breaking Eshwar's car window when the latter manages to park his car ahead of him. They quarrel in full public view, which turns ugly when Ilamaparuthi insults Eshwar's mother, causing Eshwar to slap him in anger. Seeking revenge for the slap, Ilamparuthi and his brother-in-law force Aparna to file a false case of harassment against Eshwar. Eshwar is arrested, but Aparna, feeling guilty for what she did, withdraws the complaint and Eshwar is released. Eshwar, in retribution, then frames Ilamparuthi for accepting a bribe of ₹30,000, leading to his suspension. Despite Aathika pleading with Eshwar, and also at the same time Selvi and Aparna begging Ilamparuthi, not to escalate their quarrel, the duo refuse to budge. Ilamparuthi goes to the extent of loosening Eshwar's front tyre, which leads to a near-accident when Eshwar is taking Aathika to hospital for her regular checkup.\nEnraged at this attempt to kill him and his wife, even though she is pregnant, Eshwar wrecks Ilamparuthi's car. Selvi and Aparna leave home, fed up of Ilamparuthi's behaviour towards Eshwar. Eshwar, on Aathika's insistence, decides to move out. He manages to find another home and then meets with Ilamparuthi to inform him of the same and make peace with him condescendingly. But instead, Ilamparuthi knocks him out in rage. At this juncture, he finds out that Aathika has gone into labour and manages to drive her to the hospital, where she gives birth. Meanwhile, Eshwar regains consciousness and brutally attacks Ilamparuthi, who has returned home, refusing to listen when he tries to inform him about his wife's delivery.\nAfter knocking him out, he goes to the extent of heating Ilamparuthi's mobile phone in a microwave oven and orchestrating a gas leak with the intention of killing him, but when he eventually finds out that Ilamparuthi had helped Aathika in her time of need, despite their personal enmity, he gets horrified for his attempt to kill him and switches off the main power supply for the house, averting a major disaster. Eshwar and Ilamparuthi apologise to each other for what had happened and both feel they could have adjusted and handled the parking issue in a matured manner. The story ends with both the families moving out of the house, and the owner of the house searching for prospective tenants for both floors under the condition that they do not own a car...\nCast\n*Harish Kalyan as Eshwar\n*M.
