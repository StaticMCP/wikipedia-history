After five seasons and a total of 62 episodes, the series concluded on September 29, 2013.\nUpon its release, Breaking Bad became one of the highest-rated shows on network television and received universal acclaim, with particular praise for its acting, characters, writing, direction, and cinematography;\n* The second season holds a 97% approval rating based on 35 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 84 based on 19 reviews on Metacritic.\n* The third season holds a 100% approval rating based on 35 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 89 based on 15 reviews on Metacritic.\n* The fourth season holds a 100% approval rating based on 34 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 96 based on 15 reviews on Metacritic.\n* The fifth season holds a 97% approval rating based on 97 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 99 based on 22 reviews on Metacritic.}} it entered the Guinness World Records in 2014 as the most critically acclaimed show of all time.
