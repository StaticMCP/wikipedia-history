      "text": "# Crusaders 1\n\nCrusade 1 is a studio album by The Crusaders, released in 1972 on Blue Thumb Records. This album peaked at No. 3 on the US Billboard Top Jazz LPs, No. 29 on the US Billboard Top Soul LPs and at No. 96 on the Billboard Top LPs chart.\nCritical reception\n}}\nAllMusic's Thom Jurek, in a 4.5/5-star review, exclaimed \"In 1971, the Jazz Crusaders reinvented themselves for the first time. First they dropped the word \"jazz\" from their moniker, and secondly they wholeheartedly embraced electric bass and guitars in their mix. Their new \"debut\" is a wonder of jazz-funk as a natural evolution out of hard bop and soul-jazz... The Crusaders were onto something here and set themselves a new watermark, carving out a place for themselves in the new decade, and it turns out for posterity.\"\nAccolades\nCrusaders 1 earned a Grammy nomination in the category of Best R&B Instrumental Performance.\nTrack listing\nAdapted from album's text.\nCredits\n*Drums – Stix Hooper\n*Electric Bass – Chuck Rainey\n*Engineer – Rik Pekkonen\n*Guitar – Arthur Adams, David T.
