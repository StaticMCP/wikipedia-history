The Mōri clan's battles with this larger allied force occupied it to such an extent that Yamanaka Yukimori and Amago Katsuhisa, as part of their arrangement with the Ōtomo, were able to take Izumo province, some distance away on Honshū, and that the Mōri became pressured into abandoning Tachibana.\nReferences\n*''This article's content is derived largely from that on the corresponding article on the Japanese Wikipedia.''\nSee also\n*Battle of Tatarahama (1336)\n*Siege of Tachibana"
