When the Western railway line from Toowoomba to Warwick was being constructed, a worker's camp known as McDonald's Camp was established in the area in 1868 and this gave its name to the general area. However, the railway siding created was known as ''Nobby's Siding and the area become known as Nobby. However, the township that was surveyed alongside the railway in 1891 was named Davenport after George Davenport, a former local Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Drayton and Toowoomba whose pastoral run was at nearby Headington Hill. However, the Railway Department refused to rename the railway station, which created confusion having the railway station and the town with different names, leading to many people continuing to refer to the town as Nobby''. Eventually the town's name was officially changed back to Nobby in 1931.\nOn 24 September 1889, Arthur Martin & Co auctioned 258 town allotments under the name Davenport Township.
