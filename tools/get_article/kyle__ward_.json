Created in 2007, the ward elects three councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 14,546 people.\nThe ward has been split politically between the Scottish National Party (SNP), Labour and the Conservatives with each party taking one seat at every election.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Kyle was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards.\nIt contained all of the former Tarbolton Symington Craigie ward as well as the majority of the former Dundonald and Loans ward and the northern halves of the former Annbank Mossblown St Quivox and Prestwick St Cuthbert's and Monkton wards. Kyle takes its name from the former comital district which covered parts of what is now East Ayrshire and South Ayrshire. The ward includes the northeasternmost part of the council area between its borders with North Ayrshire and East Ayrshire and takes in the towns of Annbank, Mossblown, Tarbolton and Monkton.  Following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections, the ward's southern boundary was moved south but there were no further changes.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Andy Campbell(Labour)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|John Allan(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Hywel Davies(Conservative/Independent)\n|-\n!2012\n|-\n!2013\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Julie Dettbarn(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Arthur Spurling(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Duncan Townson(Labour)\n|rowspan=1|Stephen Ferry(Conservative)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nNotes\nReferences"
