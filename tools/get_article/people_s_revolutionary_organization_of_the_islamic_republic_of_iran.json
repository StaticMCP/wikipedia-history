The major activity of the SATJA and its magazine was to promote Muammar Gaddafi and insult Mostafa Chamran, Musa al-Sadr and Amal Movement.\nAs of Ronen A. Cohen, the SATJA's brief presence left a long trail that is even expressed in the current sensitive political-religious situation in Lebanon.\nOrigins\nThe idea to create the SATJA was first formed before Iranian Revolution. The SATJA and the Forqan group had the same ideological nurturing, but each chose to emphasize different things. Ali Shariati's writings were used as an ideological platform by both the Forqan and the SATJA. The latter took Shariati's books — Shahadat and Pas az Shahadat — as an excuse to export the revolution, but never dealt with the other ideological insights of Shariati's agenda and only chose to use the one that served their aspiration to export the revolution.\nHeadquarters\nThe SATJA was first established in a house in Takht-e Jamshīd Street in Tehran. Also, It is claimed that the SATJA's center was located in the building of The Ministry of Immigration Office on Shahrārā Street.\nActivities\nMontazeri sent many of the SATJA members to Lebanon and Syria to fight Israel. He went to the Mehrabad Airport with his armed forces — whom were mostly young boys and girls — and volunteered to fight alongside the Palestinian guerrillas against Israel, after which he boarded the plane and went to fight Israel. Montazeri also had a close relationship with the tribal parties and leftists in Lebanon and SATJA published the magazine of Omīd-e Irān (Hope for Iran in Persian) as part of this activity.\nAli Akbar Mohtashamipur then-Ambassador of Iran to Syria was among of the SATJA's members.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
