Brunei also fought Spain briefly as well.\nThis war was also the first time Brunei ever used flintlock muskets, as they began acquiring them in the late 17th century and early 18th century\nBackground\nThe Sultan of Sulu was instated by the British to control Manila in 1763. Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin who learned about the situation in Manila, he was displeased as Azim ud-Din I was a apostate. As a result, he commanded an attack on the Sulu Sultanate in Manila with his forces under the command of Pehin Orang Kaya Di-Gadong Seri Lela Awang Aliwaddin.\nWar\nThe mission did not arrive in Manila until 1769 because the expedition's preparations took so long. Sultan Azim ud-Din I (Alimuddin) had already departed Manila for Sulu in 1764 after the Treaty of Paris, therefore Manila was under Spanish rule when the siege began. The siege was successful besieged for Brunei, capturing it in the process.\nThe Sulu Sultanate then despatched a force under the command of Datu Teting to attack Balambangan in 1775, the leaders of Balambangan sought safety in Labuan after the British quickly established a presence in Brunei. When the two forces clashed, Datu Teting surrendered and his troops fled back to Sulu after learning that the warriors of Brunei, led by Pengiran Temenggong Ampa, were far too strong for them to defeat.\nIn 1788, A Sulu army attacked many coastal villages around Sabah as an attempt to invade Brunei, lead by Datu Teting who previously burned Balambangan before retreating, arriving to Kampung Sembulan in said year. They were later defeated by again Pengiran Temenggong Ampa, Sharif Amir and Raja Tua of Mengkabong (in today's Tuaran District, Sabah, Malaysia). Sharif Ali later became the caretaker of Kampung Sembulan, now in present-day Kota Kinabalu, one of the many coastal villages in Sabah that stands until today although most land from sea has been reclaimed due to development.\nAftermath\nwho caused the eventual fall of Brunei.]]\nThanks to their numerical and military advantage over Sulu, Brunei effectively defeated the Sulu Sultanate. Though piracy raids continued after the war, Brunei reclaimed all of their lost territory in the war against Sulu. Brunei stopped any more Sulu invasions against Brunei. The war was pivotal for restoring Brunei's dominance in Borneo and stopped anymore foreign incursions into Brunei until the mid–19th century when James Brooke arrived.\nWho would later be responsible of one of many factors that caused the decline of the Bruneian Sultanate, making it decline heavily into 1870 to 1888, which eventually forced Sultan Anak Hashim to sign the Protectorate Agreement in 1888.\nNotes\nReferences"
