Raja Bhag Singh of Jhind, Jodh Singh of Kalsia, Bhanga Singh and Mehtab Singh of Thanesar and the Bhadaur sardars Dip Singh and Bir Singh agreed to join her while Sardar Tara Singh Ghaiba sent a detachment. These forces combined numbered around 7,000. They marched to meet the Marathas at Mardanpur.\nBattle\nThe Marathas had initially defeated the Sikh contingent, and the latter retreated to Rajpura. Sahib Kaur, following an impassioned speech, rallied the Sikhs to return to Patiala and once again fight the Marathas. The next day, the Sikhs attacked the advance guard of the Marathas, who were later reinforced by the remaining army. During the night, after both sides had retreated to their camps, the Sikhs made a surprise attack on Madho Rao who was busy performing the funerary rites of his dead soldiers, however, the Marathas successfully prevented the Sikhs from infiltrating their camp. Following another attack by the Sikhs before dawn, the Marathas retired to Karnal.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
