Also she is the featured artist in a recent Blackberry Ad  which shows William Ramsay, founder of the Affordable Art Fair, visiting the artist and then using his BlackBerry Torch to share her paintings with his colleagues. She also featured in a BBC program \"Making Art Work: First Idea to Final Piece\"\nArt\nShe normally works in oil and pencil, on paper and board.\n\"This gifted young artist has spent the past two winters working at Joan Eardley's clifftop studio at Catterline. The results are very different from Eardley's wild, densely painted seascapes: cooler, more cerebral, with an almost icy range of colours. Yet something of Eardley's response to nature as an untameable force is echoed in King's bleakly attractive images of post-industrial landscapes: empty feral places where nature is slowly reclaiming the land.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.anna-king.com Official web site]\n* [http://news.scotsman.com/features/Painter-Anna-King--tells.5316771.jp Painter Anna King tells why barren spaces and discarded objects inspire her], New Scotsman, 30 May 2009, by Susan Mansfield\n* [http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/sos-review/Red-lorry-yellow-lorry.3642577.jp   Red Lorry Yellow Lorry] Scotland on Sunday, Aidan Smith 6 January 2008\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110707054549/http://www.108fineart.com/artists/Anna_King/AnnaKing2010.htm Bio. of Anna King at \"108 Fine Art\"]"
