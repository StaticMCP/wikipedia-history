Unlike the others who were summoned to the fantasy world Rathna his guideline (a system given to people from earth that allows them to level up and use skills) was broken and left him to be stuck in Selha Latna a training area for otherworlders that get them ready to transition to Rathna. Han-bin was stuck in Selha Latna for over 20 years constantly leveling up and getting reset back to level 1.  After being stuck for so many years leveling up and getting reset when he escapes, he is way stronger than the normal otherworlders at his level and is overpowered compared to most. After escaping Selha Latna the real story begins as Han-bin adventures out into Rathna with the goal of surviving and getting stronger given to him by the system. As Han-bin explores Ratna he meets his companions Atisse a dragon with the ability to turn himself into a human and Ephyr a wyvern that can also turn into a human that travels with him on his journey. But quickly their adventure turns into a mission to defeat the evil god Ormphlaus (the creator of the guidelines) that is trying to take over the world of Rathna.\nCharacters\n*Ryu-Han Bin\nAfter being discharged from his military mandatory service, Ryu Han Bin was transported to a fantasy world where he’s tasked to fight monsters, however his guide system was filled with errors leaving him trapped in that world for years.\n*Kivye\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://page.kakao.com/content/51800738 Official web novel website] on KakaoPage\n* [https://page.kakao.com/content/54204320 Official manhwa website] on KakaoPage\n* [https://m.tapas.io/series/latna-saga-survival-of-a-sword-king/info Official manhwa website] on Tapas\n* [https://blogverge.com/survival-story-of-a-sword-king-in-a-fantasy-world/ About Survival Story] on Blogverge\n*\n*"
