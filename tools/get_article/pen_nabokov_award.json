The award is financed by the Vladimir Nabokov Foundation, founded by Dmitri Nabokov. It has been called one of the most prestigious PEN prizes.\nIn 2016, after an eight year hiatus, the award was revived with changes. The prize money was increased from US$20,000 to US$50,000, and the name was changed from PEN/Nabokov Award for Fiction to PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature. The criteria of the award was changed to those born or residing outside the United States, meaning previous winners Ozick, Roth, and Gass wouldn't have qualified for this version of the award.\nThe award is one of many PEN awards sponsored by International PEN affiliates in over 145 PEN centres around the world. The PEN American Center awards have been characterized as being among the \"major\" American literary prizes.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+PEN/Nabokov Award\n!Year\n!Recipient\n!Country/Reference\n|-\n|2000\n|\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Adunis\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|Vinod Kumar Shukla\n|\n|}\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.pen.org/grants-and-awards/pennabokov-award PEN/Nabokov Award], official website."
