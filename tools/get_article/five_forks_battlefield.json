The Confederate loss caused them to abandon that city, which undermined the defense of Richmond, the Confederate capital.  Final surrender of the Confederate forces would occur at Appomattox Courthouse eight days later.\nPart of the battlefield site is a unit of Petersburg National Battlefield, with public access that includes access trails to points of interest in the area.  An area of more than  around Five Forks was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved  of the battlefield.\nBattle\nGeneral Robert E. Lee had ordered George Pickett's infantry and several units of cavalry to hold Five Forks at all costs.  In the battle on April 1, 1865, Union troops under Gouverneur K. Warren broke through Pickett's lines, while Philip H. Sheridan personally led the cavalry charge, all of which overwhelmed the Confederate forces.\nThe battlefield area covers nearly all the area of fighting, and it includes a home named \"Burnt Quarter\".  It includes the location of a shad bake (a fish feast), where General Pickett, unaware of the battle going on, was entertained.  It is reported that unusual cloud conditions prevented the sound of artillery from carrying as far as it usually would.\nSee also\n*List of National Historic Landmarks in Virginia\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Dinwiddie County, Virginia\nReferences"
