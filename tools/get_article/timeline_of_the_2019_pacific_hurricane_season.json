The season officially started on May&nbsp;15 in the eastern Pacific—east of 140°W—and June&nbsp;1 in the central Pacific—between the International Date Line and 140°W, and ended on November&nbsp;30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). Tropical cyclone advisories in the Eastern North Pacific basin use both UTC&nbsp;and the nautical time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. Time zones utilized (east to west) are: Central, Mountain, Pacific and Hawaii. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first, with the respective regional time zone included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline\nMay\nMay&nbsp;15\n* The 2019 Eastern Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\nJune\nJune&nbsp;1\n* The 2019 Central Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\nJune&nbsp;25\n* 21:00&nbsp;UTC (4:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT) at &nbsp;– Tropical Depression One-E forms about  southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.\nJune&nbsp;26\n* 15:00&nbsp;UTC (9:00&nbsp;a.m. MDT) at &nbsp;– Tropical Depression One-E intensifies into Tropical Storm Alvin roughly  southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.\nJune&nbsp;28\n* 03:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT June&nbsp;27) at &nbsp;– Tropical Storm Alvin strengthens into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane roughly  southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.
