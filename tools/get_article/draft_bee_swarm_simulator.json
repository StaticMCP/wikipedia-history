The game is owned by its original developer and Bee Swarm Simulator Club, a team owned by Piercen \"Onett\" Harbut. Players collect pollen with tools and your bees. As of May 2021, Bee Swarm Simulator has over 3.2 billion visits.\nHistory\nThe game participated in various Roblox events throughout 2024, alongside a 2020 Egg Hunt event.\nMacroing\nThe phrase \"macroing\" refers to the practice of using automated programs, often known as \"bots\" or \"macros,\" to carry out operations in a game, frequently to automate repetitive activities. Onett has verified that players are permitted to use programs, even though doing so is generally discouraged. Additionally, Bee Swarm players have been utilizing them for years.\nPlayers\nThe highest number of concurrent players Bee Swarm Simulator has achieved is around 200 thousand, at once. Due to the presence of microtransactions in the game and the target demographic typically being young children, there have been instances of children spending large amounts of money on Bee Swarm Simulator.\nWhenever there is a Beesmas update to the game, the number of players playing may even triple.\nSee also\n* List of Roblox games\n* Grow a Garden\n* Sonic Speed Simulator\n* Adopt Me!\n* Dress to Impress (video game)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://shop.beeswarm.com/ Bee Swarm Simulator official website]"
