It took place between 2010 and 2015.\nFrom 2010, the men's event was UCI 1.1 rated and was part of the UCI Europe Tour. In 2011, the race was held as part of an expanded 2.1 rated Ronde van Drenthe, in which Dwars door Drenthe was held the day before the Ronde itself. The two races reverted to a stand-alone format for the 2012 edition. After the race was cancelled in 2013 due to snow, the race continued for two more years. The 2015 edition was won by Manuel Belletti (); this turned out to be the final edition as the race's cancellation was announced the following September.\nWinners\n|nat=ITA|team=}}\n|nat=NED|team=}}\n|nat=NED|team=}}\n|nat=ITA|team=}}\n|nat=ITA|team=}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
