It was erected in 1860, and designed by the local architect E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Paley.  Its estimated cost was £120–140, but Paley made no charge for it.  The monument is constructed in carboniferous limestone and consists of an obelisk on three steps.  Its inscriptions include the names of the local men who died in the war.  The obelisk stands  high.  The monument is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade&nbsp;II listed building.\nSee also\n* Listed buildings in Lancaster, Lancashire\n* List of non-ecclesiastical works by E.
