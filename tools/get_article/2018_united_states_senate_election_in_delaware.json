The Democratic Party nominated incumbent U.S. Senator Tom Carper and the Republican Party nominated Sussex County Councilman Rob Arlett.\nIncumbent Democratic Senator Tom Carper was re-elected to a fourth, and ultimately final, term. Despite Carper's victory, Arlett managed to flip Sussex County, typically a reliably Republican county in Delaware. This subsequently marked the first time Carper lost the county since his first election to the Senate in 2000.\nBackground\nThree-term Democratic Senator Tom Carper was reelected with 66% of the vote in 2012 against Republican Kevin Wade.\nCarper, the incumbent U.S. senator, was challenged in the Democratic primary by Dover activist Kerri Evelyn Harris. Carper previously faced a primary challenge in the 2012 election from businessman Keith Spanarelli. However, Carper defeated Spanarelli by around 70 points. Carper went on to defeat Harris by around 30 points. It was the most competitive Democratic U.S. Senate primary in Delaware in two decades.\nThe main declared candidates in the Republican primary were Sussex County councilman Rob Arlett and businessman Gene Truono, with a perennial candidacy from businessman Rocky De La Fuente, who also ran for Senate in seven other states. Another candidate withdrew before the primary. Rob Arlett defeated Gene Truono in a landslide to win the Republican nomination.\nDemocratic primary\nCandidates\nNominee\n* Tom Carper, incumbent U.S. senator and 71st governor of Delaware\nEliminated in primary\n* Kerri Evelyn Harris, Dover activist and U.S. Air Force veteran\nWithdrew\n* Tykiem Booker, activist\nDeclined\n* Lisa Blunt Rochester, U.S. representative (ran for re-election)\nEndorsements\n;U.S. senators\n* Cory Booker, U.S. senator from New Jersey\n;U.S. representatives\n* Gabby Giffords, former U.S. representative, AZ-08\n;State executive branch officials\n* Rita Landgraf, former Secretary of Delaware Health and Social Services\n;State legislators\n* Debra Heffernan, Delaware state representative\n;Individuals\n* Matthew Albright, moderator of the Democratic primary debate\n* Sandra Hall, 2016 Delaware Teacher of the Year\n* Douglas E.
