      "text": "# Osaka Owarai Championship\n\nThe  was the secondary title contested in the Japanese professional wrestling promotion Osaka Pro Wrestling. It was established in 2008 as the Osaka Pro Wrestling Owarai Championship (before being renamed in 2019) when Kanjyuro Matsuyama declared himself the first Owarai Champion upon vacating the Osaka Meibutsu Sekaiichi Championship.\nBeing a professional wrestling championship, it was not won via direct competition; it was instead won via a predetermined ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a wrestling angle.\nHistory\nNames\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Years\n|-\n|Osaka Pro Wrestling Owarai Championship\n|April 29, 2008 – February 16, 2019\n|-\n|Osaka Owarai Championship\n|February 16, 2019 – January 8, 2023\n|}\nReigns\nDuring the championship's existence, there have been 23 recognized reigns shared among 14 wrestlers with three vacancies.
