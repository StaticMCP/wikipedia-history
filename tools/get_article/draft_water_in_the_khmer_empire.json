Characterised by their monumental architecture and complex hydraulics system of barays and canals, this society has left a resounding impact on modern archaeological discourse.\nSpirituality\nMythology and Cosmic Importance\nWater plays a central role in Khmer spirituality and is an essential component in Hindu religiosity. The myth of Samudra Manthana, and the story of the ‘Churning Sea of Milk,’ emphasises this role, and is clearly exhibited throughout much of the Ancient Khmer architecture and art. Prominently featuring in Angkor Wat bas-reliefs ‘The Churning Sea of Milk’ is the myth in which the gods had to churn the cosmic ocean to retrieve the lost amrita, or elixir of immortality, after it had been expelled into the water following the curse of the sage Durvasas. Using the half-human, half-serpent Vasuki as a rope, the gods churned the ocean, symbolizing the creation of life and order from chaos, and recovering the amrita.\nMoats\nMajor temples in Ancient Cambodia, including Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom, were often surrounded by a moat. This moat fulfilled many purposes including acting as a defensive mechanism and as architectural stability, however it was also a powerful symbol in Khmer spirituality. The temples represented Mount Meru, the dwelling of the gods, and the moats signified the cosmic ocean that surrounds it. As such, the temples were not only a place for worship and prayer, but a metaphysical place for the intersection of the divine and the mortal worlds. This notion was heightened by the moats representation of the barrier one must cross between the two.\nBlessings and Ceremonies\nDue to the central role water played in Khmer spirituality and everyday life, it is unsurprising that it also is a key motif in many blessings and rituals. Mount Kulen provides the headwaters for several of the rivers that feed Angkor’s hydraulic system, including the Kbal Spean River, home to the key religious site, Kbal Spean. This site, also known as ‘The River of a Thousand Lingas,’ is a carved riverbed featuring thousands of carved lingas (the phallic symbol of Shiva) over which the water runs, sanctifying the flow before it reaches the plains of Angkor.  This site also has carved displays of Shiva and other deities to aid with this blessing.\nConsequently, water is sacred to the Khmer people and has been used in all major ceremonies since the 9th century such as the coronation of kings, curing diseases, bringing luck or praying for rain.\nFurthermore, the sacredness of water also reiterated to the public the need to protect water resources and ensured the sustainability of the system, transforming engineering requirements into a form of religious duty.  This was essential for the development and productivity of the Siem Reap region.\nArchitecture\nWater played a critical role in maintaining the incredible temples and architecture that would provide the foundations for the Khmer legacy. The land around Angkor is made up of unstable soil that would ordinarily be unable to support the weight of these structures due to erosion or collapse, especially during the monsoon season. To counteract this the Khmer engineers designed moats, canals and reservoirs around the temples, carefully regulating the water levels and harnessing the underground water table and sandy composition of the soil to stabilise and strengthen the ground. As such the moats were central in both their spiritual representation and architectural necessity.\nIrrigation and Agriculture\nWater was also harnessed to aid the agricultural industries of the Khmer people. The hydraulics system meant there was a continuous supply of water year round, drawing water from the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake into the network of barays and canals to be stored and used throughout the dry season.  This had resounding effects in the rice cultivation sector, enabling 3-4 harvests a year, compared to the 1-2 harvests yielded by other societies of the period in Southeast Asia, boosting trade relations and feeding a growing population. The Tonle Sap Lake played a major role in supporting this population as an incredibly fertile inland fishery, providing another food source for the society to harness.   Subsequently, the importance of water is further realised through its key role in facilitating  the regions main food sources and trade goods.\nTrade and Transport\nThe economic prosperity of the Ancient Khmer was dependent on internal and external trade relations. Maritime trade, particularly predominant in the Funan period (1st century BC – 6th century AD), and traceable through extensive archaeological evidence of bead trade between South and Southeast Asia,  played a significant role in Khmer society.  Chinese tertiary texts describe Funan in this period as a prominent political entity in the region and establish the area as a convenient waypoint along the route to the Indian Ocean, facilitating the trade relations the Khmer were so dependent on at the time.  These texts further illustrate Funan as possessing a complex canal transportation network, emerging before large-scale Indianisation, including a 70 km long canal between Oc Eo and Angkor Borei. Traversable throughout the entirety of the year due to the sophistication of the Khmer water management system, local individuals were able to transport goods such as manufactured crafts or produce throughout this water network with ease for export or import of coveted items, ultimately sustaining the economy.  As such, the complex systems of canals and tributaries that characterised the Ancient Khmer landscape were essential in facilitating transport between trade centres and ports sustaining livelihoods further emphasising the importance of water in everyday life.\nDecline\nThe collapse of Angkor is closely linked to the failure of its water management system. Prolonged periods of drought and flooding would have made the maintenance of this system increasingly difficult.  The collapse can also be attributed to the increase in deforestation for farmland, the extra run-off clogging the irrigation channels with soil and silt, negatively impacting efficiency, water supply and fish populations.  These failures also contributed to a decrease in agricultural output creating food shortages leading to a declining population. Furthermore, the decrease in harvests, from 3-4 to 1-2 annually, led to less prosperity in the region due to the lack of trade of excess rice. Ultimately, the collapse of this system, combined with growing external threats, led to the decline of Angkor, demonstrating the critical role of water in this ancient society.\nReferences"
