It was founded by Ladislao S. David, a prominent entrepreneur of Guagua in 2003.\nHistory\nSource:\nIn 2003, a local philanthropist and the founder of the House of David Group, Ladislao S. David, had a clear vision. It focused in establishing an educational institution providing “Academic Excellence and Integral Formation” for underprivileged, deserving students into higher level of education.\nHe converted the Guagua Shopping Mall into a learning institution. In its initial year of operation, the college offered programs in business, education, and computer studies.\nStarting in 2007, it has added courses such as BS Information Systems, BS Hotel and Restaurant Management, BS Information Technology, Bachelor of Elementary Education, and BS Accounting Technology.\nIn 2009, the institution tied with government agencies such as the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and, thus, MQC-Career Institute was founded, as the technical vocational arm of MQC offering short vocational courses.\nIn 2012, MQC started offering night classes intended for working individuals who want to continue and finish college education.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
