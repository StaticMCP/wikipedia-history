The Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Spain) Act 1820 (Ley de Desvinculaciones de 1820) simply took away the legal and juridical rights pertaining to these lordships but preserved the property rights attached to them and the dignity of their honours including the right to use the feudal title and the coat of arms. In the present days, despite having no political power as such, lordships, like titles of nobility, simply remain rights held as prerogative of honour.\nList of Spanish feudal baronies\n*Barony of Polop\nBibliography\n*VALDEÓN, Julio, SALRACH, José María y ZABALO, Javier (1987).
