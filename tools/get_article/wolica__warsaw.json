It is located at the boundary between districts of Ursynów and Wilanów, and divided between City Information System areas of Ursynów-Centrum and Błonia Wilanowskie. It is a small residential area consisting of single-family housing, centred in the area Kokosowa Street.\nWolica was most likely founded in the 14th century, and its oldest known records date to 1424. Throughout most of its history, it was a small farming community. In 1951, it was incorporated into Warsaw. In the 1970s and 1980s, most of its area became part of then-constructed multifamily housing neighbourhood of Na Skraju.\nHistory\nWolica, historically known as Wola Służewska () was most likely founded in the 14th century. The first known records of it come from 1424. The names Wolica and Wola are related to Polish term wolność (\"freedom\"). Historically, since 13th century, name Wola was given to the villages whose population had certain freedoms, such as being exempt from paying taxes. This suggests that Wolica was founded as one of such settlements, attracting settlers with temporary exemption of taxation. The village was part of the Catholic parish of the Church of St. Catherine.\nIn the 15th century, the village was owned and inhabited by petty nobility. It was located at the road between Warsaw and Czersk, which currently forms part of Nowoursynowska Street. In 1528, it had the total area, including its farmlands, equal to around 85 ha, and was owned by Wierzbów family.\nIn 1730, the village was bought by nobleperson Maria Zofia Czartoryska, and added to the Wilanów Estate. In 1775, in Wolica were located 15 houses, and in 1827 it had 177 inhabitants in 13 households. Following the abolition of serfdom in 1864, in Wolica were founded 30 peasant-owned farms, which collectively had an area of 178 ha. The village was incorporated into then established municipality of Wilanów.\nIn 1905, Wolica was inhabited by 478 people in 34 houses, all of which were constructed out of wood and with thatched roofs. In 1908, the village burned down, with only two houses surviving. Buildings constructed after the fire were primarily made from brick. In 1912, there lived 471 people, and it included 360 ha of farmland, half of which was owned by local families, and the rest by the noble family of Branicki. There were grown vegetables such as onion and radish. In 1921 it was inhabited by 336 people in 40 houses.\nDuring the German occupation of Poland in the Second World War, in Wolica were stationed German soldiers.\nIn 1948, there was opened the bus line no. 104, connecting Wolica with the Southern Bus Station. It ended with a turning loop at Nowoursynowska Street. In 1949, the village was connected to the electric network. On 14 May 1951, it was incorporated into the city of Warsaw. In 1956, the portion of Wolica farmlands became property of the Warsaw University of Life Sciences, which organised there a test field. In the 1950s, in the village was also founded the Kolejarz Wolica association football club.\nIn the 1960s, the construction of new housing buildings in the village was forbidden. Wolica became part of an area where between 1976 and 1981, was constructed the neighbourhood of Na Skraju, consisting of the high-rise multifamily housing. The land was acquired by the government with small compensation. In the 1990s there were also build villas. In 1990, the bus line no. 104 was rerouted away from Wolica, via Rosoła Street to Kabaty, end eventually discontinued in 1993.\nIn 2001, at the site of former cemetery, begun the ongoing construction of the Catholic Church of Blessed Edmund Bojanowski at 12 Kokosowa Street.\nCurrently, a few houses of the original Wolica remain, mostly at Kokosowa Street.\nCharacteristics\nWolica is a small residential neighbourhood consisting of single-family housing, centred in the area Kokosowa Street.
