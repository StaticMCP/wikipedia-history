On June 26, 2015, the landmark US Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges effectively ended restrictions on same-sex marriage in the United States.\nPre-1950s\n1886\n* In Grand Rapids, Michigan, male impersonator Annie Hindle married her dresser Annie Ryan while on a tour through the mid-west. Hindle dressed in male clothing and gave her name as Charles and a local Baptist minister performed the ceremony.\n1950s\n1953\n* August: Shipment of the August 1953 issue of ONE magazine, with the cover story \"Homosexual Marriage?\", is delayed by U.S Post Office officials for three weeks while they try to determine whether its contents are obscene.\n1958\n* January 13, 1958: In One, Inc. v. Olesen, the United States Supreme Court rules that homosexual writings cannot be banned from mailing under the guise of obscenity.\n1960s\n1964\n* A woman in Jess Stearn's popular non-fiction work The Grapevine: A Report on the Secret World of the Lesbian explains that she congratulated two men on their wedding because \"Having no status in the law of the land...the homosexual marriage must be maintained only through mutual love and devotion of those involved.\"\n1966\n* Publishers Weekly reports that Jean Genet's The Miracle of the Rose \"delicately describes a secret homosexual marriage\".\n1967\n* December 3: Theologians who object to acceptance of homosexual relationships are reported to be \"dubious about how 'fulfilling' even a lasting homosexual relationship can be and point out that a homosexual 'marriage' lacks the discipline and formal commitment of legal sanctions\".\n1968\n* December 22: A report in the New York Times says the plot of Spitting Image, a play scheduled for Off Broadway in February, involves \"a pair of homosexuals who marry and have a baby\". It calls the premise \"farcical\" and an \"outrageous charade\".\n1970s\nprohibited federal recognition of same-sex marriages.]]\n1970\nThe modern gay movement for PRIDE and marriage equality in the United States began on the Minneapolis campus (U&nbsp;of&nbsp;M) of the University of Minnesota. James Michael McConnell, librarian, and Richard John Baker, law student, applied for a marriage license. Gerald R. Nelson, Clerk of District Court, denied the license because both applicants were men.\n* Baker sued Nelson, insisting that the license was not forbidden.\n* Courts were not persuaded.\n1971\n* January 26: Look magazine devotes three pages of its cover story \"The American Family\" to a gay couple, Jack Baker and Michael McConnell.\n* June 4: Members of the Gay Activists Alliance demand marriage rights for same-sex couples at New York City's Marriage License Bureau.\n*Jack Baker and Michael McConnell apply and are granted a marriage license in Blue Earth County, Minnesota after discovering the county has no laws prohibiting same sex marriage.

Nelson that the state's statute limiting marriage to different-sex couples does not violate the U.S. Constitution. However this ruling did not invalidate the 1971 license in Blue Earth County\n1972\n* The National Coalition of Gay Organizations calls for the repeal of all statutes that limit marriage to different-sex couples and for extending the legal benefits of marriage to all cohabiting couples.\n* March 21: Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, principal sponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment, defends it against critics who contend it would require states to permit same-sex marriages: \"All it says is that if a state legislature makes a judgment that it is wrong for a man to marry a man, then it must say that it is wrong for a woman to marry a woman\".\n* October 10: The United States Supreme Court dismisses appeal in Baker v. Nelson, a decision that refused to invalidate Minnesota's restriction of marriage to different-sex couples, \"for want of a substantial federal question.\"\n** Until 26 June 2015, dismissal of the appeal challenging the Minnesota opinion was treated as a binding precedent. Thus, lower federal courts could not offer a contrary conclusion when presented with the precise issue \"necessarily decided\" by the Court.\n** Because Hennepin County had argued that the marriage license issued previously in Blue Earth County rendered this case Moot, the \"precise issue\" necessarily decided by the Court may not have been the inherent right of gay citizens to marry the adult of one's choice.\n1973\n* January: The Yale Law Journal publishes an unsigned article, \"The Legality of Homosexual Marriage\", which argues that \"[a] credible case can be made that the denial of marriage licenses to all homosexual couples violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\" and that the proposed Equal Rights Amendment would make such a claim irrefutable.\n* July 1: Maryland bans same-sex marriage, the first state to enact such a statute.\n* November 9: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rules in Jones v.

Hara that the state's statute banning same-sex marriage does not violate the state constitution and raises no federal issues.\n1975\n* March 26 – April 22: In Colorado, the Boulder County Clerk, Clela Rorex, issues marriage licenses to 6 same-sex couples after receiving a favorable opinion from an assistant district attorney. When one of those married in Boulder tried to use it to sponsor his husband for immigration purposes, he lost his case, Adams v.

Freund of Harvard Law School before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n1982\n* February 25: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, deciding Adams v. Howerton, holds that for immigration purposes Congress intended its use of the words marriage and spouse to have their \"ordinary meaning\" which \"contemplates a relationship between a man and a woman\".\n* May: San Francisco Board of Supervisors passes Harry Britt's measure to extend health insurance coverage to same-sex domestic partners of public employees, largely because of the reaction to the early days of AIDS, but does not provide for a registry available to the general public.
