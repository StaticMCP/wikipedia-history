It introduces a new approach about the ethnogenesis of the early Slavs, especially in Southeastern Europe, advancing a hypothesis that the early Slavic identity was an invention of the Byzantine Empire on the Danubian Limes, and with Slavic language it spread without mass migration from Slavic Urheimat.\nA new revised version of the work was published as Slavs in the Making: History, Linguistics, and Archaeology in Eastern Europe (ca. 500-ca. 700) in 2020 by Routledge, as \"another attempt to convince the skeptical scientific community of the viability of a postmodern interpretation of the early medieval Slavs\".\nAcademic journal reviews\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nAbout the author\nSee also\n* Myth of Nations.
