There have been seven heads of state of the Central African Republic and the Central African Empire since independence was obtained from France on 13 August 1960. This list includes not only those persons who were sworn into office as President of the Central African Republic but also those who served as de facto heads of state.\nJean-Bédel Bokassa served as a de facto head of state (and also reigned as emperor from 1976 to 1979), while David Dacko (who served as de facto'' head of state from 1979 to 1981), André Kolingba, Ange-Félix Patassé, and François Bozizé were elected into office at some point during their tenure. To date, Kolingba is the only former head of state of the Central African Republic to voluntarily step down from the office through a democratic process, following the 1993 general election.\nThe current president of the Central African Republic is Faustin-Archange Touadéra, since 30 March 2016.\nSuccession\nBefore the adoption of the 2023 constitution, the president of the National Assembly was the constitutional successor of the president in the event of a vacancy.\nTerm\nBefore the adoption of the 2023 constitution, there was a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of the Central African Republic. The term limit was not met by any president. The constitution of 2023 removed term-limits and extended the presidential term from five years to seven years.\nList of officeholders\n;Political parties\n|Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Central African Democratic Union (UDC)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Central African Democratic Rally (RDC)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People (MLPC)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|United Hearts Movement (MCU)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Other affiliations\n|Military|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Independent|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"5%\"|\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\"|Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"20%\"|Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\"|Elected\n! colspan=\"3\" width=\"20%\"|Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\"|Political affiliation\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"20%\"|Notes\n|-\n! width=\"20%\"|Took office\n! width=\"20%\"|Left office\n! width=\"20%\"|Time in office\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\"|Central African Republic (1960–1976)\n|-\n| —\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n| David Dacko\n| —\n| 14 August 1960\n| 12 December 1960\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\"|MESAN\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Dacko served as president of the government from 1 May 1959 until the country declared its independence on 13 August 1960.\n|-\n| 1\n| David Dacko\n| 1964\n| 12 December 1960\n| 1 January 1966\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Jean-Bédel Bokassa\n| rowspan=\"2\"| —\n| rowspan=\"2\"|1 January 1966\n| rowspan=\"2\"|4 December 1976\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n! style=\"background:\" |\n| Military\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Bokassa seized power from Dacko in a successful coup d'état.

Dacko had support from the French government.\n*  Bokassa seized power by staging a coup d'état from 31 December 1965 until 1 January 1966. Bokassa forced Dacko to officially resign from the presidency at 03:20 WAT (02:20 UTC) on 1 January.\n*  Bokassa staged a military coup against the Dacko government on 31 December 1965 – 1 January 1966. After becoming president, Bokassa took control of MESAN and imposed one-party rule under MESAN.\n*  Bokassa, then-president for life of the Central African Republic, instituted a new constitution at the session of the MESAN congress and declared the republic a monarchy, the Central African Empire (CAE). Bokassa became the emperor of the CAE as \"Bokassa I\".\n*  By 1979, French support for Bokassa had all but eroded after the government's brutal suppression of rioting in Bangui and massacre of schoolchildren who had protested against wearing the expensive, government-required school uniforms. Dacko, who was Bokassa's personal adviser at the time, managed to leave for Paris where the French convinced him to cooperate in a coup to remove Bokassa from power and restore him to the presidency. The French successfully executed Operation Barracuda on 20–21 September 1979 and installed Dacko as president.\n*  General Kolingba (who was also the armed forces chief of staff) overthrew Dacko from the presidency in a bloodless coup.\n*  On 21 September 1985, Kolingba dissolved the Military Committee for National Recovery, and created the positions of head of state and president.\n*  A constitution was adopted by a referendum on 21 November 1986 and Kolingba was elected to a six-year term in office.\n*  The country held a multiparty presidential election on 22 August and 19 September 1993. Patassé was the candidate from the Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People party and ran on the platform that he would pay the previously withheld salaries to soldiers and civil servants. Patassé defeated Dacko, Kolingba, Bozizé and Abel Goumba to win the election.\n*  Bozizé's second coup attempt was successful; he seized power in Bangui on 15 March 2003.\n*  Djotodia ousted Bozizé in the 2012–13 conflict; he seized power in Bangui on 24 March 2013.\n*  Under pressure from other central African heads of state gathered for a crisis summit on the situation in CAR, Djotodia resigned in N'Djamena, Chad on 10 January 2014.\nTimeline\nColors =\nid:ind     value:rgb(0.8,0.8,0.8)    legend:None_(Independent)\nid:mil     value:rgb(0.76,0.69,0.57) legend:Military\nid:mesan   value:rgb(0,0,0)          legend:MESAN\nid:bokassa value:rgb(0.9,0.78,0.1)   legend:None_(Absolute_monarch)\nid:udc     value:rgb(0.47,0.66,0.27) legend:UDC\nid:rdc     value:rgb(0.98,0.89,0.23) legend:RDC\nid:mlpc    value:rgb(0.08,0.64,0.28) legend:MLPC\nid:knk     value:rgb(0.99,0.4,0)     legend:Kwa_Na_Kwa\nid:seleka  value:rgb(0,0.5,0)        legend:Séléka\nid:rpr     value:rgb(0.39,0.58,0.93) legend:RPR\nid:mcu     value:rgb(0.04,0.45,0.78) legend:MCU\nid:gray1  value:gray(0.85)\nid:gray2  value:gray(0.95)\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1960 till:31/12/+1}}\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:gray1 unit:year increment:5 start:1960\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:gray2 unit:year increment:1 start:1960\nLegend     = columns:1 left:150 top:60 columnwidth:170\nTextData =\npos:(20,65) textcolor:black fontsize:M\ntext:\"Political party:\"\nBarData =\nbar:Dacko\nbar:Bokassa\nbar:Kolingba\nbar:Patassé\nbar:Bozizé\nbar:Djotodia\nbar:Nguendet\nbar:Samba-Panza\nbar:Touadéra\nPlotData =\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:9 shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbar:Dacko\nfrom: 14/08/1960 till: 01/01/1966 color:mesan\nfrom: 21/09/1979 till: 01/03/1980 color:mesan\nfrom: 01/03/1980 till: 01/09/1981 color:udc     text:\"David Dacko\"\nbar:Bokassa\nfrom: 31/12/1965 till: 01/01/1966 color:mil\nfrom: 01/01/1966 till: 04/12/1976 color:mesan\nfrom: 04/12/1976 till: 21/09/1979 color:bokassa text:\"Jean-Bédel Bokassa / Bokassa I\"\nbar:Kolingba\nfrom: 01/09/1981 till: 06/02/1987 color:mil\nfrom: 06/02/1987 till: 22/10/1993 color:rdc     text:\"André Kolingba\"\nbar:Patassé\nfrom: 22/10/1993 till: 15/03/2003 color:mlpc    text:\"Ange-Félix Patassé\"\nbar:Bozizé\nfrom: 15/03/2003 till: 30/01/2005 color:mil\nfrom: 30/01/2005 till: 21/08/2009 color:ind\nfrom: 21/08/2009 till: 24/03/2013 color:knk     text:\"François Bozizé\"\nbar:Djotodia\nfrom: 24/03/2013 till: 10/01/2014 color:seleka  text:\"Michel Djotodia\"\nbar:Nguendet\nfrom: 10/01/2014 till: 23/01/2014 color:rpr     text:\"Alexandre-Ferdinand Nguendet (acting)\"\nbar:Samba-Panza\nfrom: 23/01/2014 till: 30/03/2016 color:ind     text:\"Catherine Samba-Panza\"\nbar:Touadéra\nfrom: 30/03/2016 till: 08/11/2018 color:ind\nfrom: 08/11/2018 till: $today     color:mcu     text:\"Faustin-Archange Touadéra\"\n}}\nLatest election\nSee also\n* Politics of the Central African Republic\n* History of the Central African Republic\n* Emperor of Central Africa\n* List of heads of government of the Central African Republic\n* Vice President of the Central African Republic\n* List of colonial governors of Ubangi-Shari\nReferences\n;Specific\n;General\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\nExternal links\n* [http://presidence.govcf.org/ Official Website]\n* [http://africanelections.tripod.com/cf.html Elections in the Central African Republic]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/country_profiles/1067615.stm BBC News Timeline: Central African Republic]"
