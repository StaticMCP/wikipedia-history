It returned New France (Quebec, Acadia and Cape Breton Island) to French control after the English had seized it in 1629, after the Anglo-French War (1627–1629) had ended.\nOn 19 July 1629, an English fleet under the command of David Kirke managed to cause the surrender of Quebec by intercepting its supplies, which effectively reduced Samuel de Champlain and his men to starvation.  This action occurred following the signing of the Treaty of Suza and thus was considered illegitimate. The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye resolved this issue, returning New France to French control. It also provided France with compensation for goods seized during the capture of New France.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nReferences"
