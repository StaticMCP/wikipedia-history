In May, the U.S. Labor Department reported a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 3.9% for April and an increase of 164,000 jobs. Wages grew by 2.6%. Hiring gains were broad based with jobs being added in the fields of professional and business services, health care, manufacturing, and mining.\nPublic opinion\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight, President Trump's approval rate at the beginning of this quarter was 40.5%, down 4.9% from the start of his presidency.
