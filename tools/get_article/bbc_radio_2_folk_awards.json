The awards have been given annually since 2000 by British radio station BBC Radio 2.\nAward recipients have included Joan Baez, Cat Stevens, John Martyn, Steve Earle, The Dubliners, Martin Carthy, Billy Bragg, Shirley Collins, Kate Rusby, Cara Dillon, Eliza Carthy, Bellowhead, June Tabor, Oysterband, Aly Bain, Richard Thompson, Nancy Kerr, Seth Lakeman, Show of Hands, Lau, Tom Paxton, Don McLean, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Nic Jones, Bella Hardy, Rhiannon Giddens, Norma Waterson, The Chieftains, Joan Armatrading and James Taylor.\nHistory\nat the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2015]]\nThe awards are managed by independent production company Smooth Operations, now part of 7digital. Kellie While of Smooth Operations has stated that the idea of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards was conceived by the company in 1999, inspired by the Country Music Awards, and brought to the BBC, and The Guardian has attributed their creation to John Leonard, who formed Smooth Operations in 1995.\nThe awards event has been staged in different regions of the United Kingdom, including The Brewery in London, The Lowry theatre in Salford, the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall during the 2013 Celtic Connections festival, the Bridgewater Hall during the 2019 Manchester Folk Festival, the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff in 2015,\nand the Belfast Waterfront in 2018.\nIn 2014, 2016 and 2017, the event was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\nReviewing the 2014 Royal Albert Hall event, Colin Irwin remarked on how much more glamorous it had become since the first event fifteen years earlier.\nBetween 2000 and 2012 the Folk Awards were hosted by Mike Harding, and broadcast on BBC Radio 2. Mark Radcliffe and Scottish Gaelic singer Julie Fowlis took over presenting the ceremony in 2013. In 2004 the awards were shown on television for the first time, on BBC Four. The event has been streamed live in audio and video on the BBC Radio 2 website, the BBC iPlayer and/or the BBC Red Button TV service.\nThe BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Award has been included in the award event since 2011, having previously been awarded in a separate ceremony, but its selection process remains independent.\nIn 2016, Rhiannon Giddens became the first non-British winner of the 'Folk Singer of the Year' award.\nIn 2020, there was no award ceremony due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSelection\nThe controlling body is the Folk Awards Committee, comprising two BBC staff, two from the production company 7digital Creative, and one external expert. Two Nominated Representatives, one from 7digital and one from the BBC oversee the process. The Folk Awards Committee selects a panel of 150 representatives from the British folk world, including broadcasters, journalists, record producers, festival organisers, venue bookers, record company directors, agents and promoters. The panellists vary slightly from year to year, with new panellists being invited (or self-applying) each year.\nThe nominations in most categories are made by the panel. The four most-nominated artists go through to the second round. The winner is then selected from the nominees by a second vote among the same panellists. Since 2013, following criticism of the lack of transparency of the selection process, there have been some exceptions to this general process. The second round of the \"Best Album\" category is determined by a public vote, hosted on the BBC website. The two track categories, \"Best Original Track\" and \"Best Traditional Track\" were removed from the main panel. They are now voted by a much smaller specialist panel of judges, appointed by the Folk Awards committee, whose identities are published.\nBroader categories, including the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" and the \"Good Tradition Award\" are chosen by two rounds of votes by the Folk Awards committee only. These may not be awarded every year.\nThe BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Award, although presented at the Folk Awards ceremony since 2011, has its own independent selection process.\nThe selection process has been the subject of criticism, with accusations of bias, cronyism, and lack of transparency. In 2012 The Independent reported that there had been at least two Freedom of Information requests to identify the panellists, which have been rejected by the BBC. The BBC and 7digital have responded that the panellists are kept secret to avoid lobbying and bribery.\nCompilation album\nA Folk Awards double-album, featuring music by most of the nominees, was released annually by the event's producers in collaboration with BBC Radio 2 and the record label and distribution company, Proper Music.\nHall of Fame\nIn 2014, a posthumous award was introduced to celebrate the contribution of significant figures in folk music's past.\n* 2019 inductee: Leonard Cohen (with tribute performance by Thea Gilmore)\n* 2018 inductee: Nick Drake (with tribute performance by Olivia Chaney)\n* 2017 inductee: Woody Guthrie (with tribute performance by Billy Bragg)\n* 2016 inductee: Sandy Denny (with tribute performance by Rufus Wainwright and original members of Fairport Convention)\n* 2015 inductee: Ewan MacColl (with tribute performance by Guy Garvey and the MacColl family)\n* 2014 inductee: Cecil Sharp\nAward winners\n2019\n* Folk Singer of the Year: Ríoghnach Connolly\n* Best Duo / Group: Catrin Finch & Seckou Keita\n* Horizon Award: Brìghde Chaimbeul\n* Best Traditional Track: The Foggy Dew -
