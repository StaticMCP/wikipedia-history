The bestowal is decided by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and presented by the President of China. According to law, this medal is bestowed on \"outstanding individuals who have made great contributions and established outstanding merits in the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics and defense of the country.\"\nOn 27 December 2015, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a law establishing three national orders of merit: the Medal of the Republic, the National Honorary Titles, and the Friendship Medal, effective on 1 January 2016.\nDescription\nThe Medal of the Republic adopts an overall color scheme of red and gold. The badge features the National Emblem and the five-pointed star, as well as symbolic representations of the Yellow River, the Yangtze, mountain peaks, and peonies (specifically the  牡丹, or Paeonia × suffruticosa). The chain incorporates motifs inspired by the Chinese knot (), the ruyi (), and orchid. Various metalworking techniques, including cold-press forging, filigree inlay, and enamelling, are involved in the process of its production.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Name\n!Native name\n!Main identity\n!Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" |2019\n|Yu Min\n|\n|Nuclear physicist\n|Medal bestowed posthumously\n|-\n|Shen Jilan\n|\n|Former congresswoman\n|\n|-\n|Sun Jiadong\n|\n|Aerospace engineer\n|\n|-\n|Li Yannian\n|\n|Retired military officer\n|\n|-\n|Zhang Fuqing\n|\n|Retired military officer\n|\n|-\n|Yuan Longping\n|\n|Agronomist\n|\n|-\n|Huang Xuhua\n|\n|Nuclear submarine designer\n|\n|-\n|Tu Youyou\n|\n|Pharmaceutical chemist\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|Zhong Nanshan\n|\n|Public health scholar\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2024\n|Wang Yongzhi\n|\n|Aerospace scientist\n|Medal bestowed posthumously\n|-\n|Wang Zhenyi\n|\n|Medical scientist\n|\n|-\n|Li Zhensheng\n|\n|Geneticist\n|\n|-\n|Huang Zongde\n|\n|Retired military officer\n|\n|}\nReferences"
