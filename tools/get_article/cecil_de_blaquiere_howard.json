      "text": "# Cecil de Blaquiere Howard\n\nCecil de Blaquiere Howard, sometimes Cecil Howard, (April 2, 1888 – September 5, 1956), born in Clifton, Welland County, Ontario, Canada (today Niagara Falls) was an American painter and sculptor.\nThe sculptor devoted his work to the presentation of the human body in various circumstances and styles, in sports or at rest, experimenting with figurative, polychrome sculptures, cubism, traditional African art, art deco, classicism or neoclassicism. Using different techniques, including modeling and direct carving, he worked with a range of materials, including clay, stone, marble, wood, plasticine, terracotta, plaster, wax, bronze and silver.\nBiography\nHoward was the fourth child of British businessman George Henry Howard (1840–1896) and his wife Alice Augusta (née Farmer, 1850–1932). As the youngest son, Cecil was given his maternal grandmother's name \"de Blaquiere\" as his middle name. The family moved to Buffalo (New York) in 1890, and took American citizenship in 1896.\nHoward left school early to study with James Earle Fraser at the Art Students' League of Buffalo, which had recently relocated into the basement of the Albright–Knox Art Gallery, still under construction. At the early age of sixteen, he traveled to Paris to study at the Académie Julian with Raoul Verlet. Soon he befriended Rembrandt Bugatti, whom he accompanied in 1909 on a journey to Antwerp, where together they made drawings and sculptures of animals in the Zoological Garden. Howard presented these early pieces at the Salon d'Automne in 1910, but later destroyed many of these plasters, as he regarded them as inferior in comparison to Bugatti's works. After his return from Holland, the sculptor moved to a studio on the Avenue du Maine, in Montparnasse, and regularly presented his works in Parisian salons and galleries.\nIn 1913, Howard presented one of his earlier female nudes, simply entitled Woman, at the Armory Show in New York and Boston. This was his first exhibition in the United States. In the early days of World War I, Howard served in an Anglo-French hospital as a stretcher-bearer, and in 1915 he joined an English Red Cross unit heading for Serbia, ravaged by war and typhus.Art & Progress: vol. 6.

SERBIA BATTLES WITH TYPHUS — Young American Sculptor, Working with the Red Cross, Writes of Conditions in the Fighting Zone At the end of his six months engagement, he was back in Paris, and went on to produce a series of polychrome cubist sculptures, mainly inspired by scenes in Parisian dance-halls.\nBy October 1915, after ten years in France, Howard returned to the United States for the annual exhibition of American sculpture at the Gorham Galleries in New York. Four months later, after a few sales, he was back in Paris. In November 1916 he featured again in the annual exhibition at the Gorham Galleries, where he presented Decorative Figure, a sculpture of a tall African woman bearing a vase on her shoulder, and ''L'Après-midi d'un faune (Afternoon of a Faun''), representing two dancers, inspired by Nijinsky's innovative ballet.The Sun: P. 12.

Recent American Sculpture on Exhibition — […] The superb \"L'Après-Midi d'un Faune\" by Cecil Howard is the most striking illustration we have had of a theme in art that has passed through at least three incarnations. The poses of the Russian dancers were studied with amazingly happy result from the decorative art of antiquity and the modern sculptor undoubtedly found his inspiration in the Russian dance. Thus antiquity and the living present are brought together in this remarkable sculpture which emphasizes the lusty gravity of the animal not yet man[…] Both pieces were exhibited the following months at the National Academy in Manhattan and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts of Philadelphia.New York Evening Post: p. number illegible. December 23, 1916. THE NATIONAL ACADEMY — The sculpture exhibit is minor, but several pieces give enjoyment. Two such pieces, seen earlier in the season at the Gorham Gallery, are ''L'Après-Midi d'un Faune and Decorative Figure by Cecil Howard. These as much as any of the exhibits hint at aesthetic ideas to which the academic sculptor is generally averse[…]And :American Art News'':  p. 1-2. February 10, 1917. James B. Townsend. Annual PA.

After World War I, he received a commission to create two war memorials in Normandy. Several of his pieces were acquired by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, while Henry Luce also commissioned works from him. Very well acquainted with most of the Parisian art world, Howard occasionally socialised with his French fellow sculptors Charles Despiau, Antoine Bourdelle, and particularly Aristide Maillol. In 1925 the Whitney Studio Galleries of New York presented the first American exhibition dedicated exclusively to Cecil Howard's works.\nTaking part in several international traveling art shows, like the Tri-National Art Exhibit, he also participated in the Century of Progress fair in Chicago in 1933, and was awarded two Grand Prix in the Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in 1937. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. After the declaration of World War II, when German troops invaded France, Howard drove an American Red Cross truck carrying food and medicine to the hastily erected prison camps around Paris. Five months later, his situation as an American became increasingly strained with the occupying authorities and he decided to head back to the United States with his family.\nFile:Cecil Howard - Mother & child 1918.jpg|Mother & Child 1918\nFile:Cecil Howard - Lucy Krohg 1920.jpg|Lucy Krohg 1920\nFile:Cecil Howard - Baigneuse 1920.JPG|Bather 1920\nFile:Cecil Howard - Dance 1920-24.jpg|Dance 1920\nCecil Howard - Pomone (La Pomme) 1923.JPG|The Apple 1923\nFile:Cecil Howard - Standing Figure 1928.jpg|Standing Figure 1928\nIn late 1943, Cecil Howard exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, a male nude entitled American Youth or The Sacrifice, rewarded in 1944 by the George D. Widemer Memorial Gold Medal from the Academy. The same year he became the sixteenth president of the National Sculpture Society, and was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services. From 1945 onward he worked for the United States Office of War Information, and three weeks after D-Day, he came ashore at Utah Beach, in Normandy. In 1947 Howard became Vice President of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and participated in an exhibition co-organised by the Whitney Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The same year, the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris  bought a large sculpture of a reclining nude entitled Sun Bath, and in 1948 the French government awarded him the Legion of Honour.\nIn 1953, for the 20th annual exhibition of the National Sculpture Society, he received the Herbert Adams Memorial Award Medal, and in 1954 the Architectural League of New York unanimously awarded him the highly coveted Golden Medal of sculpture. That same year, Cecil Howard featured in a long photo shoot by Andreas Feininger for Life magazine, and he also appeared in Uncommon Clay, Thomas Craven's documentary about six of America's leading sculptors at work in their studios.\nCecil Howard died in New York in 1956 and was posthumously awarded the E. N. Watrous Gold Medal from the National Academy Museum and School in 1957.\nFile:Cecil Howard-Couple de danseurs (1913-15).jpg|Cecil Howard-Couple de danseurs\nFile:Cecil Howard - Fatigue 1920-24.jpg|Cecil Howard - Fatigue\nFile:Cecil Howard - Knockout 1935.jpg|Cecil Howard - Knockout\nFile:Cec Howard - The Bowl 1913-14.JPG|Cec Howard - The Bowl 1913-14\nFile:Cecil Howard - Side headlock and butt 1928-35.JPG|Cecil Howard - Side headlock and butt\nFile:Cecil Howard - Robert Winthrop Chanler 1925-28.jpg|Cecil Howard - bust of Robert Winthrop Chanler\nFile:Cecil Howard - Scène de café (Gouache, 1915-17).jpg|Cecil Howard - Scène de café (Gouache)\nCollections\n* Whitney Museum of American Art\n* Spencer Museum of Art\n* Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris\n* Albright–Knox Art Gallery\n* Brookgreen Gardens\n* Smithsonian American Art Museum\n* Metropolitan Museum of Art\n* Musée d'Orsay\n* Los Angeles County Museum of Art\nBibliography and filmography\nBooks in English\n*  (Biography based on interviews with the sculptor)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Thomas Craven, film, Uncommon Clay.\nBooks in French\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.artnet.com/artists/cecil-de-blaquiere-howard/past-auction-results Cecil Howard on Artnet]\n* [https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/search?q=cecil+howard Images of Cecil Howard by Andreas Feininger]\n* [http://www.dickjohnsonsdatabank.com/howard-cecil.html Cecil Howard as a medallist]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/arts/youth-and-beauty-at-brooklyn-museum-review.html New York Times article: Ken Johnson Nov.3, 2011; \"An Era That Offered Much More Than Modernists\"]"
