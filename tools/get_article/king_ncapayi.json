He was the second son from the first wife of King Madzikane, the firstborn being Sonyangwe his elder brother. He resided at his father's royal residence in Mpoza facing the Mganu mountains and also built another residence in the nearby Lutateni. While trying to attack the Mpondo people due to the Maitland treaty he fell off the cliff and died in a place called Nowalala near Ntabankulu in March 1844. Faku ordered he must be killed to save him from pain and agony he had suffered as for days he had plunged beneath the cliff.\nSee also\n* List of Bhaca kings\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bhaca.co.za Bhaca| AmaBhaca]"
