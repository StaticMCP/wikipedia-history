A \"Senate coup\", or a motion of no confidence, or declaring the presidency as vacant, or a resolution containing the signatures of a majority of senators supporting another senator as Senate president, may happen mid-term and requires for an election.\nProcedure\nFrom 1941 to 1972, a Senate presidential election is held at the opening of each session immediately following a senatorial election.\nSince 1987, a Senate presidential election is held at the opening of each Congress.\nOutside the opening of each session or Congress, an election for the Senate presidency occurs if there is a vacancy.\nList since 1987\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%:'\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election date\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Reason\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Cong.\n! colspan=\"4\" |Elected Senate president\n! colspan=\"4\" |Losing candidate(s)\n! colspan=\"2\" |Other votes\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Name\n!Party\n!Votes\n! colspan=\"2\" |Name\n!Party\n!Votes\n!Abstentions\n!Against\n|-\n|July 24, 1987\n|Convening of Congress\n| rowspan=\"2\" |8th\n|bgcolor=|\n|Jovito Salonga\n|Liberal\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|December 12, 1991\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" bgcolor=|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Neptali Gonzales\n| rowspan=\"2\" |LDP\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 27, 1992\n|Convening of Congress\n| rowspan=\"2\" |9th\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|January 17, 1993\n|Resignation of incumbent\n| rowspan=\"2\" bgcolor=|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Edgardo Angara\n| rowspan=\"2\" |LDP\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 24, 1995\n|Convening of Congress\n| rowspan=\"4\" |10th\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|August 28, 1995\n|Resignation of incumbent\n|bgcolor=|\n|Neptali Gonzales\n|LDP\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Edgardo Angara\n|LDP\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|October 10, 1996\n|Resignation of incumbent\n|bgcolor=|\n|Ernesto Maceda\n|NPC\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|January 26, 1998\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Neptali Gonzales\n|LDP\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 27, 1998\n|Convening of Congress\n| rowspan=\"3\" |11th\n|bgcolor=|\n|Marcelo Fernan\n|LAMMP\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Francisco Tatad\n|Gabay Bayan\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|April 13, 2000\n|Resignation of incumbent\n|bgcolor=|\n|Franklin Drilon\n|LAMMP\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|November 14, 2000\n|Motion to vacate the chair carried\n|bgcolor=|\n|Nene Pimentel\n|PDP–Laban\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Teofisto Guingona Jr.\n|Lakas\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 23, 2001\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Convening of Congress\n|12th\n|bgcolor=|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Franklin Drilon\n|Independent\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Nene Pimentel\n|PDP–Laban\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 26, 2004\n| rowspan=\"2\" |13th\n|bgcolor=|\n|Liberal\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Nene Pimentel\n|PDP–Laban\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 24, 2006\n|Resignation of incumbent\n| rowspan=\"2\" bgcolor=|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Manny Villar\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Nacionalista\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 23, 2007\n|Convening of Congress\n| rowspan=\"2\" |14th\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Nene Pimentel\n|PDP–Laban\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|November 18, 2008\n|Resignation of incumbent\n| rowspan=\"2\" bgcolor=|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Juan Ponce Enrile\n| rowspan=\"2\" |PMP\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 26, 2010\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Convening of Congress\n|15th\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Alan Peter Cayetano\n|Nacionalista\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 22, 2013\n|16th\n|bgcolor=|\n|Franklin Drilon\n|Liberal\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Juan Ponce Enrile\n|UNA\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 25, 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" |17th\n|bgcolor=|\n|Koko Pimentel\n|PDP–Laban\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Ralph Recto\n|Liberal\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|May 21, 2018\n|Resignation of incumbent\n| rowspan=\"2\" bgcolor=|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Tito Sotto\n| rowspan=\"2\" |NPC\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 22, 2019\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Convening of Congress\n|18th\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 25, 2022\n| rowspan=\"2\" |19th\n|bgcolor=|\n|Juan Miguel Zubiri\n|Independent\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|May 21, 2024\n|Resignation of incumbent\n| rowspan=\"2\" bgcolor=|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Francis Escudero\n| rowspan=\"2\" |NPC\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|-\n|July 28, 2025\n|Convening of Congress\n| rowspan=\"2\" |20th\n|\n|bgcolor=|\n|Tito Sotto\n|NPC\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|September 8, 2025\n|Motion to vacate the chair carried\n|bgcolor=|\n|Tito Sotto\n|NPC\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|\n|\n|}\n1st Commonwealth Congress\nManuel Roxas was elected Senate president in 1945.\n2nd Commonwealth Congress\nIn the convening of Congress in May 25, 1946, senators from the minority walked out of session after the majority argued that a majority vote shall be enough to organize itself. The minority senators led by Tomas Confesor, insisted that the rules of the pre-World War II Senate should apply. José Avelino was later elected Senate president and read out the result of 1946 Philippine presidential election, during the inauguration of Manuel Roxas.\nThe United States granted the Philippines independence on July 4, 1946, and the 2nd Congress of the Commonwealth of the Philippines became the 1st Congress of the Republic of the Phllippines.\n1st Congress\n1948\nAvelino retained the Senate presidency at the opening of the third regular session of the 5th Congress.\nFebruary 1949\nIn February 22, 1949, Senate president Avelino and nine of his supporters walked out of session. After they left, the remaining twelve senators ousted Avelino and elected Mariano Jesús Cuenco as Senate president. Avelino branded the subsequent session, his ouster and Cuenco's election as illegal, while President Elpidio Quirino recognized Cuenco as the new Senate president.\n2nd Congress\n1950\nCuenco was reelected at the convening of the 2nd Congress.\nFebruary 1952\nAt the resumption of session after the 1951 Philippine Senate election, the Nacionalista Party and Liberal Party had 12 senators each, and the Senate was deadlocked. After 35 days, Felisberto Verrano of the Nacionalista Party crossed the floor and broke the tie for the Liberals, electing Quintín Paredes as Senate president.\nApril 17, 1952\nCamilo Osías won a Senate presidential election, ousting Paredes.\nApril 30, 1952\nEulogio Rodriguez won a Senate presidential election, ousting Osías.\nApril 1953\nCamilo Osías won a Senate presidential election, ousting Rodriguez.\nMay 1953\nJose Zulueta won a Senate presidential election, ousting Osías.\nNovember 1953\nEulogio Rodriguez won a Senate presidential election, ousting Zulueta.\n3rd Congress\n1954\nRodriguez retained the Senate presidency at the convening of the 3rd Congress.\n1956\nIn the opening of the third regular session, Senate president Eulogio Rodriguez was nominated by Decoroso Rosales, then was seconded by Soc Rodrigo. Cipriano Primicias Sr. then moved that the nomination be closed and was approved, reelecting Rodriguez anew.\n4th Congress\n1958\nRodriguez retained the Senate presidency at the convening of the 4th Congress.\n1960\nRodriguez retained the Senate presidency at the opening of the third regular session of the 4th Congress.\n5th Congress\n1962\nRodriguez retained the Senate presidency at the convening of the 5th Congress.\n1963\nFerdinand Marcos won a Senate presidential election, ousting Rodriguez.\n1964\nMarcos retained the Senate presidency at the opening of the third regular session of the 5th Congress.\n6th Congress\n1966\nArturo Tolentino won the Senate presidency at the convening of the 6th Congress after Marcos was elected president in the 1965 Philippine presidential election.\n1967\nGil Puyat won a Senate presidential election, ousting Tolentino. Puyat asserted a term-sharing deal which President Marcos acknowledged, something that was denied by Tolentino.\n1968\nPuyat retained the Senate presidency at the opening of the third regular session of the 6th Congress.\n7th Congress\n1970\nPuyat retained the Senate presidency at the convening of the 7th Congress.\n1972\nPuyat retained the Senate presidency at the opening of the third regular session of the 7th Congress.\nPresident Marcos declared martial law on September 23, 1972. A constitution was then approved in a 1973 plebiscite which dissolved Congress, including the Senate.\n8th Congress\nAfter winning the 1986 Philippine presidential election, President Marcos fled the country at the height of the People Power Revolution in February 1986. Corazon Aquino, who also claimed to have won the election, ascended to the presidency. A new constitution approved in a 1987 plebiscite restored Congress, including the Senate.\n1987\nOn the inauguration of the restored Senate, only 23 senators were present, as the 24th and final senator was still undetermined due to delays in tallying of votes. Jovito Salonga was elected Senate president.\n1991\nIn December 1991, Salonga, agreeing that there was no quorum, adjourned the session. Later that morning, a rump session of 13 senators (the smallest number that can constitute a quorum) elected Neptali Gonzales of the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), while the pro-Salonga senators were meeting in his office.\n9th Congress\n1992\nOn the opening of the 9th Congress, Gonzales was reelected as Senate president via acclamation, with only Arturo Tolentino abstaining.\n1993\nIn January 1993, Gonzales resigned from the Senate presidency after renegade members of the LDP and Lakas–NUCD senators elected Edgardo Angara as new Senate president.\n10th Congress\nJuly 1995\nAngara was elected Senate president in the convening of the 10th Congress.\nAugust 1995\nA month later, Gonzales mustered enough support to force an election against Angara on which the former won.\n1996\nIn October 1996, admitting that he had lost the support the majority of his peers, Gonzales resigned as Senate president. Ernesto Maceda, upon support from his Nationalist People's Coalition, Angara, and a couple of independent senators had him elected as Senate president without an opponent. While 16 senators signed the resolution supporting Maceda, only 13 were present on the actual nomination and election.\n1998\nIn January 1998, Gonzales won a Senate presidential election.\n11th Congress\n1998\nMarcelo Fernan was elected Senate president at the convening of the 11th Congress.Fernan resigned the Senate presidency on June 1999, and died days later. Blas Ople succeeded Fernan being Senate president pro tempore.\nApril 2000\nOple resigned due to a term-sharing agreement with Franklin Drilon. On April 13, 2000, Drilon was elected Senate president via unanimous vote after Teofisto Guingona Jr. withdrew his candidacy after being nominated by Robert Barbers.\nNovember 2000\nWith the impending impeachment trial of president Joseph Estrada, Drilon was ousted in November 14. Drilon had previously anti-Estrada protests a week before, and had resigned on the Lapian ng Masang Pilipino. Juan Ponce Enrile motioned to declare all leadership positions vacant, which was sustained by a vote of 12–7. On the ensuing election between Pimentel and Guingona, and where candidates traditionally abstained or vote against each other, saw Guingona abstain and Pimentel voting for himself. If Pimentel did not vote for himself, no one would have won the election.\n12th Congress\nAt the convening of the 12th Congress, Pimentel and Drilon were the candidates for the election. Drilon won 13–11, with the balance of power on neophyte and independent senator Noli de Castro.\n13th Congress\n2004\nAt the convening of the 13th Congress, Drilon defended the Senate presidency against Pimentel, and entered a term-sharing agreement with Manny Villar.\nBy senator\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+Vote of each senator in the 2004 President of the Senate of the Philippines election\n!width=\"200px\"|Drilon\n!width=\"200px\"|Pimentel\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n# Joker Arroyo\n# Rodolfo Biazon\n# Pia Cayetano\n# Juan Flavier\n# Dick Gordon\n# Lito Lapid\n# Ramon Magsaysay Jr.\n# Kiko Pangilinan\n# Nene Pimentel\n# Ralph Recto\n# Bong Revilla\n# Mar Roxas\n# Manny Villar\n| valign=\"top\" |\n# Edgardo Angara\n# Miriam Defensor Santiago\n# Franklin Drilon\n# Loi Ejercito\n# Juan Ponce Enrile\n# Jinggoy Estrada\n# Panfilo Lacson\n# Alfredo Lim\n# Jamby Madrigal\n# Serge Osmeña\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" |Source: [https://web.senate.gov.ph/lisdata/35395911!.pdf Senate]\n|}\n2006\nDrilon resigned in the opening of the third regular session in 2006; he then nominated Villar to be his successor.
