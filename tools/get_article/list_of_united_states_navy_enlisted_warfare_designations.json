When awarded in accordance with appropriate guidelines, enlisted sailors are authorized to place the designator in parentheses immediately after the member’s rate abbreviation, for example, MM1(SW) Smith, HM2(CAC) Jones.  In cases of multiple designators, the designators are separated by a slash enclosed in parentheses, for example, MM1(SW/AW) Smith, HM2(FMF/CAC) Jones.  Although commissioned officers have warfare pins and designations, such as Surface Warfare Officer, they do not use warfare designators in their titles.\nAviation community\n* (AW) - Aviation Warfare Specialist\n* (CAC) - Marine Combat Aircrew\n* (NAC) - Naval Aircrew Warfare Specialist\nSurface Warfare community\n* (SW) - Surface Warfare Specialist\nUndersea Warfare community\n* (SS) - Submarine Warfare Specialist (or \"Qualified Submarine Specialist\")\n* (SU) - \"In training for submarine qualifications\"\n* (SQ) - \"Qualified in submarines, but not planned for future assignment to submarine duty.\"\n* (SG) - \"Qualified in submarines, but not in submarine source rating; not detailed by the submarine community.\"\n* (SP) - \"Previously assigned in submarines; assigned only to those personnel disqualified for submarine duty and serving in a submarine support billet; detailed by the submarine community, but not to be reassigned to submarine duty without prior approval of NAVPERSCOM.\"\n* (IUSS) - Integrated Undersea Surveillance System Specialist\n* (DSI) - Deep Submergence Insignia\nMarine Corps support community\n* (CAC) - Marine Combat Aircrew\n* (FMF) - Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist\nParachutist community\n* (PJ) - Basic Parachutist or Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist\n* (FPJ) - Free Fall Parachutist\nSpecial Operations community\n* (DV) - Diver - applies to personnel with Navy Enlisted Classifications:\n:: 5311 - Saturation Diver\n:: 5342/5931 - Diver First Class\n:: 5343/5932 - Diver Second Class\n:: 5345 - SCUBA Diver\n::\n:: HM-8493 - Medical Deep Sea Diving Technician\n:: HM-8494 - Deep Sea Diving Independent Duty Corpsman\n* (MCD) - Marine Combatant Diver - applies to personnel with Navy Enlisted Classifications:\n:: HM-8403 - Fleet Marine Force Reconnaissance Independent Duty Corpsman\n:: HM-8427 - Fleet Marine Force Reconnaissance Corpsman\n* (MDV) - Master Diver - applies to personnel with Navy Enlisted Classifications:\n:: 5341/5933 - Master Diver\n:: 5346 - Master Saturation Diver\n* (DSW) - Diving Salvage Warfare Specialist\n* (EWS) - Explosive Ordnance Disposal Warfare Specialist\n* (EOD) - no longer used; see (EWS)\nSpecial Warfare community\n* (SEAL) - Naval Special Warfare Specialist; a designator for Special Warfare Operator (SO) rating\n* (SWCC) - Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen; a designator for Special Warfare Boat Operator (SB) rating\nExpeditionary Warfare community\n* (EXW) - Expeditionary Warfare Specialist\nConstruction community\n* (SCW) - Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist\n* (EXW) - Expeditionary Warfare Specialist\nInformation Warfare community\n* (IW) - Information Warfare Specialist\nIDW was updated to IW in July 2016.\nSee also\n*United States Navy enlisted rate insignia\n*List of United States Navy ratings\n*Uniforms of the United States Navy\n*Badges of the United States Navy\n*List of Naval Officer Designators\n*United States Navy officer rank insignia\n*List of United States Navy staff corps (insignia)\n*Navy Enlisted Classification\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070320040334/http://buperscd.technology.navy.mil/bup_updt/upd_CD/BUPERS/MILPERS/MILPERSMAN%20%201220%20%20-%20ENLISTED.pdf MILPERSMAN]\n* [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spektral-investment-bank-to-acquire-3-billion-worth-of-oil-securities-301210664.html Erdal Can Alkoçlar]"
