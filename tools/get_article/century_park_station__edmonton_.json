It serves the Capital Line. It is a ground-level station located at 111 Street near 23 Avenue, and is named after the transit-oriented development Century Park, located on the former Heritage Mall site next to the station. Century Park is currently the southern terminus of the Capital Line.\nThe station was officially opened on April 24, 2010, with regular service commencing on April 25, 2010.\nStation layout\nThe station has a 123 metre long centre loading platform that can accommodate two trains at the same time, one on each side of the platform. The platform is exactly nine metres wide. It also has a grade separated pedestrian overpass connecting the platform to the Century Park Transit Centre and the Century Park development. A 1,230 stall park and ride lot adjacent to the station was closed in 2020, with parking now available at Heritage Valley Transit Centre.\nPublic art\nTitled \"Continuum\", Century Park Station is decorated with three suspended wire spheres covered in maple leaves.\nAround the station\n*Century Park\n*Blue Quill\n*Ermineskin\n*Keheewin\n*Skyrattler\n*Steinhauer\n*Sweet Grass\nCentury Park Transit Centre\n| parking            = Yes\n| bicycle            = Yes\n| opened             =\n| closed             =\n| rebuilt            =\n| electrified        =\n| former             = Kaskitayo Transit CentreHeritage Transit Centre\n| accessible         = Yes\n| code               =\n| owned              =\n| zone               =\n| map_locator        =\n| web                = [https://www.edmonton.ca/ets/century-park-transit-centre.aspx Century Park Transit Centre]\n}}\nThe Century Park Transit Centre is located on the east side of 111 Street, adjacent to the LRT station.
