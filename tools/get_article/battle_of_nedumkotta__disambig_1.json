This battle was fought between Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore and Dharma Raja, Maharaja of Travancore. Mysore army attacked the fortified line in Thrissur district at the Travancore border known as the Nedumkotta. Tipu did eventurally break through the lines and camped in Alwaye, but had to retreat when the Company attacked Mysore.\nSituation in Travancore\nThe strength of the Travancore Army was greatly reduced after several earlier battles with Hyder Ali's forces.. The death of the Dutch-born commander Valiya-kappitan Eustachius De Lannoy in 1777 further diminished the morale of the soldiers. The death of Makayiram Thirunal and Asvati Thirunal in 1786 forced the Travancore royal family to adopt two princesses from Kolathunad. As the threat of an invasion by Tipu Sultan loomed in the horizon, Travancore's maharajah Dharma Raja tried to rebuild his army by appointing Chempakaraman Pillai as the Dalawa and Kesava Pillai as the Sarvadhikaryakkar.\nThe first clash\nMysorean troops encroached into Travancorean territory to apprehend fugitives, clashed with Paravoor Battalion patrols, and attacked the Nedumkotta lines. They initially captured ramparts and overpowered three batteries but were repulsed by Travancorean soldiers (800 men) using a 6-pounder gun and flank fire from the woods, killing the Mysorean commander. Reinforcements arrived during the four-hour battle; retreating Mysoreans panicked, many trampled or forced into the burning ditch. Tipu Sultan was injured (wound on back, arrow in leg), his horse killed, and he was carried away. Mysore lost ~1,000 soldiers; Travancore ~200. Captives included European and Maratha troops. Travancore recovered Tipu's sword, palanquin, dagger, and ring from the ditch. Mysore used rockets; Travancore defended with cannon  He was carried back to Mysore by his loyal followers, with a wound on his back and an arrow lodged between his hamstrings and buttocks.\nThe second battle\nTipu Sultan was now determined to retaliate against Travancore. He remained in the vicinity of the northern frontier and concentrated a large army there of infantry, cavalry and artillery. The Madras Government was duly informed of the Sultan’s position, and the Maha Rajah received assurances from the British Governor of assistance in the event of invasion. In the meantime, Travancore repaired its northern frontier line and concentrated all available troops there. Recruits were enlisted, and guns, stores and ammunition were stored in the arsenals.\nTipu concentrated a large army on the northern frontier. Travancore repaired defenses and enlisted recruits. On 1 March, 1,000 Travancore troops advanced into Mysore territory but were repulsed with losses. On 9 April, 1,500 made another failed advance. Mysorean artillery breached the wall (~0.75 mile) by 15 April; Travancore abandoned the lines. Tipu advanced with 6,000 men, occupied Cranganur (8 May), and captured forts like Ayicotta and Parur, plus 200 cannons and stores. He demolished the wall personally. Advance halted at Alwaye by severe monsoon floods, submerging fields and wetting ammunition. Travancore strengthened southern defenses under Kesava Pillai with stockades and militia. British assured aid and assembled forces at Trichinopoly. Tipu retreated in two divisions via Chalakudy/Trichoor/Palghat and Cranganore/Chavakkad/Palghat due to impending British attack at Srirangapatna.\nAftermath\nMysore's actions against Travancore breached the Treaty of Mangalore, which led to further conflict with the British Empire, and the Third Anglo-Mysore War. The Travancore force joined the British army at Falghautcherry, Coimbatore and Dindigul, and fought under the command of British officers against Mysore up to the conclusion of the war and the Treaty of Seringapatam. The Mysorean invasion provided the East India Company a chance to conquer and tighten their grip on the ancient feudal principalities of Malabar and to compel the Travancore to accept the subsidiary alliance of the company.\n}}\nSources\n*\n* Marshman, John Clark (1863).
