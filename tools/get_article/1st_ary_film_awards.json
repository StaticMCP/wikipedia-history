Shaan used his opening monologue to address patriotism, and the lack thereof, in the Pakistani industry. Specifically calling out artists who accept work from across the Indian border, he labeled all those who choose to work outside Pakistan as unpatriotic sell-outs. At the occasion, where he also unveiled the first look of his upcoming film Arth 2, he blamed local celebrities for making Bollywood a stairway to their success. Shaan's comment was seen as a thinly veiled dig at Ali Zafar, who was set to receive the International Icon Award of Pakistan later that night. In replied when Ali come up to stage to receive his honorary award said that we make excuses to hide our weaknesses, sometimes, in the name of patriotism, sometimes, in the name of other things. We should speak the truth and the time has come when the new generation should be told the truth. Ali mentioned that calling him an unpatriotic means calling artists like, Ghulam Ali, Zeba Bakhtiar, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Atif Aslam and many more who have made their mark in India through their work and have received tremendous appreciation for it, unpatriotic too. Aftermath in press Shaan replies that \"It hurts to see when your own misunderstand you. Ali Zafar needs to understand when I said undersell it means you are worth more than you are selling for positivity is a sign that show us that ego is not making your decisions.  I havent lost until my own leave my side. I hope you understand as I still have hope that one day you will realize we are all green and have a place next to the crescent on our flag, he added.\" Many critics and filmmakers favors Shaan like Altaf Hussain, Chaudhry Ijaz Kaleem while director-writer Pervaiz Kaleem said that \"Shaan evidently loves his nation and advocates inhabitant firmness while thespian Ali Zafar is ignorant about such nationalistic emotions.'Our nation is a identity'. What is discernible is to use a talent for a possess country. Ali Zafar needs to call Shaan Shahid and apologize to him.\"\nSee also\n* 4th Pakistan Media Awards\n* 2nd Hum Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n; Official websites\n*\n;News resources\n* [https://www.bbc.com/urdu/entertainment/2014/04/140428_ary_afa_film_awards_rh AFA's Awards] BBC Urdu\n* [http://www.arynews.tv/ary-film-awards-2014-waar-mhsa-steal-show/ 1st ARY Film Awards] ARY News\n* [http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/04/29/entertainment/star-studded-ary-film-awards-attended-by-all-pakistani-mega-stars/ ARY Film Awards] Pakistan Today\n;Analysis\n* [http://www.brandsynario.com/articles/ary-film-awards-2014-complete-winners-list AFA'14] on Brand Synario\n* [http://www.pakium.com/2014/05/24/watch-ary-film-awards-2014-live-online ARY film Awards Updates] on Pakistan Ultimate Media\n;Other resources\n* [http://www.arydigital.tv/videos/category/afa/ AFA] at ARY Digital"
