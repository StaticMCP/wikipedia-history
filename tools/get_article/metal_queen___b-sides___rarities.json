It is unclear if this is a fully licensed compilation, an unofficial release or even a pirated publication. The album is not present in the discography section of Doro's official site and Discogs lists the album as an \"unofficial release pretending to be released under No Remorse Records label\". On the contrary, Encyclopaedia Metallum lists it as an official compilation.\nAs of 2010, this is the only compilation collecting many b-sides of Doro's EPs and singles, as well as songs performed by Doro in other compilations and in albums by other artists.\nTrack listing\nCD 1\n# \"I Adore You\" (B-side of the single \"White Wedding\", 2000) - 3:23\n# \"I Want More\" (bonus track of the album Calling the Wild European edition, 2000) - 2:31\n# \"Alone Again\" (feat.
