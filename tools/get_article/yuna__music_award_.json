Nominees and winners are determined by a professional jury. The first ceremony took place in 2012, and it has been held every year since. Its hosts have included celebrities such as singer Potap and television presenter Anatoly Anatolich. In 2020, a youth version of the award, called YUNA Junior 2020, also took place.\nIn 2022, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the award ceremony was held online. The 2023 edition of the event only had one award category: Song of Indomitable Ukraine.\nBackground\nThe award ceremony was established on 27 October 2011 by radio and television presenter Pavlo Shilko and businessman Mohammad Zahoor. Nominees and winners are determined by a professional jury, and the accounting firm Deloitte regulates the final vote tally.\nHistory\n2012\nThe first YUNA ceremony, which took place on 8 February 2012 at Palace \"Ukraine\" in Kyiv, honored the best in Ukrainian music spanning the twenty years since the country's independence in 1991 and was later named \"YUNA: The Best of 20 Years\". The event didn't have a host; rather, awards were presented by different celebrities. From 28 nominees, who had been announced on 12 December 2011, the jury selected 9 winners.\n2013\nThe second YUNA ceremony, celebrating the best in Ukrainian music for the previous year, was hosted by singer Potap. It added two new categories, namely Best Duet and Breakthrough of the Year.\n2014\nThe 2014 YUNA gala was held under the slogan \"YUNA – Music Unites! / YUNA – Get United!\"\n2015\nThe 2015 event came with the slogan \"Ukraine. Music. The Best!\"\n2016\nThe fifth YUNA ceremony took place on 25 February 2016.\n2017\nThe sixth edition of the event was held on 21 February 2017 and was again hosted by Potap.\n2018\nIn 2018, YUNA was hosted by Anatoliy Anatolich.\n2019\nThe eighth edition of the ceremony took place on 22 March 2019.\n2020\nThe 2020 event was held on 9 July. That year, a youth version of the award, called YUNA Junior 2020, was also organized.\n2021\nThe tenth ceremony was held on 12 May 2021.\n2022\nIn 2022, YUNA was scheduled for 16 March, but due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was held online on 17 July instead. The event's host, television presenter Volodymyr Ostapchuk, and producer Pavlo Shilko, announced that winners would not receive their trophies that year. Instead, they would be auctioned off, with proceeds being donated to the Ukrainian military.\n2023\nThe twelfth ceremony was again held online, on 18 April 2023, and it only had one award category: Song of Indomitable Ukraine. According to updated YUNA regulations, adapted to the realities of martial law, the jury selected winners from a top-100 list of most-frequently played new songs on Ukrainian radio stations from the previous year, starting from the Russian invasion.\n2024\nThe 2024 event took place on 23 May, at the International Center of Culture and Arts of the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine, in Kyiv.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
