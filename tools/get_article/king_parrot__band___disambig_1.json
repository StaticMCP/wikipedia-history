They have released four studio albums: Bite Your Head Off (2012), Dead Set (2015), Ugly Produce (2017) and ''A Young Persons' Guide to King Parrot (2025).\nHistory\nKing Parrot formed in Melbourne in 2010 with the original line-up of Matt Young (vocals), Ed Lacey and Ari White (guitar), Slatts Everday (bass) and drummer Matt Rizzo. White, Rizzo and Lacey had come directly from their previous band Watchdog Discipline, Slatts Everday was a member of Warrnambool rock band Cockfight Shootout. Lacey had also been a member of The Berzerker for several years and Rizzo was formerly with Blood Duster.\nAfter the release of The Stench of Hardcore Pub Trash EP in 2011, Lacey left King Parrot and was replaced by Andrew Livingstone-Squires, formerly of Dreadnaught and Cemetery Urn. The group recorded and independently released their debut full-length album Bite Your Head Off'' in 2012, which was picked up by UK based metal label Candlelight Records in 2013 for worldwide release. Shortly after the album's release Rizzo was replaced by Matt \"Skitz\" Sanders, formerly of Damaged but the band's heavy touring schedule meant he was replaced on overseas dates by Rob Brens of Alarum. King Parrot had by now established themselves as intense live act, and their unsettling sense of humour, most notably in their music video \"Shit on the Liver\", which was a finalist in the 2013 Australian Music Video Awards.\nAfter extensive touring within Australia, supporting Obituary, Carcass and Thy Art Is Murder, King Parrot were invited to play a number of prominent music festivals including an appearance at the 2013 Hammersonic Jakarta International Metal Festival in Indonesia, Australia's Soundwave Festival and the 2014 SXSW in Austin, Texas, which was part of a 45-date North American tour. They later signed a management deal with Extreme Management Group in New York. Pantera and Down vocalist Phil Anselmo personally interviewed them on his Housecore Records YouTube channel.\nIn June 2014, at the end of their Australian tour with Carcass, it was announced that Todd Hansen, formerly of The Berzerker and Headkase, would be taking over from Sanders. In late 2014 King Parrot recorded their second album Dead Set at Anselmo's studio in Louisiana. It was released in May 2015 and peaked on the Australian albums chart at #21. Dead Set was nominated for an ARIA Award for Best Hard Rock or Heavy Metal Album that year but lost to Northlane's Node.\nKing Parrot toured Australia with Psycroptic and Revocation in early 2017, following which the band recorded their third album in Melbourne. Ugly Produce was released on 22 September and reached #21 on the ARIA chart. During October, the band toured the US with Superjoint and DevilDriver.\nThe singles \"Banished, Flawed then Docile\" and \"Nor is Yours\" - the second featuring Anselmo on vocals - were released in 2020 while the band was unable to tour due to COVID restrictions. The EP Holed Up in the Lair appeared in October of that year. A tour 10th anniversary Australian tour was postponed and rescheduled several times in 2021.\nDuring 2023 King Parrot toured extensively throughout Australia and the US once again and in March 2024 they were the opening band at Knotfest Australia.\nMembers\nCurrent\n* Matthew \"Youngy\" Young – lead vocals (2010–present)\n* Ari \"Mr. White\" White – lead guitar (2010–present)\n* Wayne \"Auntie Slatts\" Slattery – bass, backing vocals (2010–present)\n* Andrew \"Squiz\" Livingstone-Squires – rhythm guitar (2011–present)\n* Max Dangerfield - drums (2025–present)\nFormer\n* Ed Lacey – rhythm guitar (2010–2011)\n* Matt Rizzo – drums (2010–2012)\n* Matt \"Skitz\" Sanders – drums (2013–2014)\n* Todd \"Toddy\" Hansen – drums (2014–2025)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2010\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2010\nColors =\nid:V      value:red         legend:Lead_vocals\nid:LG     value:teal        legend:Lead_guitar\nid:RG     value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitar\nid:B      value:blue        legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\nid:D      value:orange      legend:Drums\nid:album  value:black       legend:Studio_album\nLineData =\nlayer:back\nat:10/01/2012 color:album\nat:05/15/2015 color:album\nat:09/22/2017 color:album\nat:06/06/2025 color:album\nBarData =\nbar:MY   text:\"Matt Young\"\nbar:AW   text:\"Ari White\"\nbar:EL   text:\"Eddie Lacey\"\nbar:AS   text:\"Andrew Squires\"\nbar:WS   text:\"Wayne Slattery\"\nbar:MR   text:\"Matt Rizzo\"\nbar:MS   text:\"Matt Sanders\"\nbar:TH   text:\"Todd Hansen\"\nbar:MD   text:\"Max Dangerfield\"\nPlotData =\nwidth:11\nbar:MY   from:start till:end color:V\nbar:AW   from:start till:end color:LG\nbar:EL   from:start till:11/01/2011 color:RG\nbar:AS   from:11/01/2011 till:end color:RG\nbar:WS   from:start till:end color:B\nbar:MR   from:start till:12/31/2012 color:D\nbar:MS   from:01/01/2013 till:07/01/2014 color:D\nbar:TH   from:07/01/2014 till:04/01/2025 color:D\nbar:MD   from:04/01/2025 till:end color:D\n}}\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| AUS\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Bite Your Head Off\n|\n* Released: October 2012\n* Label: Impedance Records (IMP034)\n* Formats: CD, digital download, LP\n| -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Dead Set\n|\n* Released: May 2015\n* Label: EVP Recordings (EVP004)\n* Formats: CD, CD+DVD, digital download, LP\n| 21\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ugly Produce\n|\n* Released: September 2017\n* Label: EVP Recordings (EVP012)\n* Formats: CD, CD+DVD, digital download, LP\n| 21\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''A Young Person's Guide to King Parrot\n|\n* Released: June 2025\n* Label: Dead Serious Recordings\n* Formats: CD, digital download, LP, streaming\n|\n|-\n|}\nExtended Plays\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of EPs, with selected chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| AUS\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The Stench of Hardcore Pub Trash\n|\n* Released: September 2011\n* Label: Impedance Records (IMP030)\n* Formats: CD, digital download\n| -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Holed Up in the Lair\n|\n* Released: October 2020\n* Label: Dead Set Records (DS001)\n* Formats: LP, digital download\n| -\n|}\nAwards and nominations\nARIA Music Awards\nThe ARIA Music Awards are a set of annual ceremonies presented by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), which recognise excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of the music of Australia.
