At first, the building was built as the first jail of Campina Grande, 24 years after it became a vila, the Vila Nova da Rainha. For 60 years, the ground floor served as a jail and the first floor functioned as the \"Casa da Câmara\" (currently Municipal Council ).\nIn 1824 Vila Nova da Rainha participated in the Confederation of the Equator, helping with the \"accommodation\" of prisoners brought from Ceará. Frei Caneca, a participant in the revolution, was trapped in the prison building, where the Historical and Geographical Museum now stands.\nOn January 13, 1896, the Telegraph Station initially called \"Telephone Station\" was inaugurated. The phrase \"Telegrapho Nacional\" is still stamped on the top of the building.\nIn January 1983  the building began to house the historical museum.\nCollection\nThe museum's collection is dedicated to the historical, social and cultural development of Campina Grande. It has photos, articles, maps, furniture, weapons, vehicles, jewels, dolls and tools organized to tell the story of the city.\nReferences"
