It uses the chalky water of the local Chiltern Hills, which has high levels of minerals and salts.\nHistory\nIt was founded in 1993 by two former students of Sir William Borlase's Grammar School, and is now brewing around 125 barrels per week, serving over 200 pubs in a 30-mile radius of Marlow. In 1998 it bought Courage's former Pilot Brewery, and in 2003 acquired a pub lease, the Three Horseshoes in Marlow.  The brewery hosts open evenings coupled with a tour every first Tuesday of each month for visitors and every second Tuesday of each month for the 2000 members of its beer club.\nBeer varieties\nThe Rebellion brewery produces four fresh all-year ales; IPA (India Pale Ale; 3.4% ABV), 'Smuggler' (4.2% ABV), 'Overthrow' (4.3% ABV) and 'Roasted Nuts' (4.6% ABV).  These names follow in a tradition of giving beers subversive or rebellious names. In addition, there are six bottled ales also available all year; 'Lager' (4.4% ABV), 'Red' (4.5% ABV), 'Blonde' (4.3% ABV), '24 Carat' (5% ABV), 'Roasted Nuts Extra' (5.8% ABV) and 'Black' (5.2% ABV). The brewery also produces various seasonal beers such as their 'Monthly' range which releases every month, or special one-off beers for certain events such as sporting events or Christmas.\nThese beers are available in many local pubs, as well as from the Rebellion Brewery Shop. Rebellion beer is also sold in Waitrose. The company specializes in beer made with all-natural ingredients that are designed to be flavourful, as part of a marketing strategy to increase sales through supermarkets offering a greater selection of artisan beers.\nAwards\nThe Rebellion Beer Company has won numerous awards from the Society of Independent Brewers at both a local and national level. Its Rebellion White won the supreme champion award in the wheat beer challenge of the Society of Independent Brewers in 2003.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"row\" | 2018\n| SIBA Midlands Independent Beer Awards\n| Bottle/Can British Premium Bitter (4.5% to 6.4%)\n| Red\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"7\" scope=\"row\" | 2019\n| rowspan=\"3\" | SIBA Midlands Independent Beer Awards\n| Bottle/Can Premium PAs (4.4 to 5.4%)\n| 24 Carat\n|\n|\n|-\n| Bottle/Can Session Lager & Pilsners\n| Lager\n|\n|\n|-\n| Bottle/Can Speciality Light Beers\n| White\n|\n|\n|-\n| SIBA National Independent Beer Awards\n| Keg Session Lager & Pilsners\n| Lager\n|\n|\n|-\n| World Beer Awards\n| UK Lager\n| Lager\n|\n|\n|-\n| World Beer Awards\n| UK Stout & Porter\n| Black\n|\n|\n|-\n| International Beer Challenge\n| Lagers\n| Lager\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"row\" | 2020\n| SIBA National Independent Beer Awards\n| Bottle/Can Session Lager & Pilsners\n| Rebellion Lager\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | 2021\n| SIBA Midlands Independent Beer Awards\n| Cask British Bitters (up to 4.4%)\n| Overthrow\n|\n|\n|-\n| SIBA Midlands Bottle & Can Beer Awards\n| British Dark Beers (4.5 to 6.4%)\n| Roasted Nuts Extra\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"7\" scope=\"row\" | 2022\n| rowspan=\"4\" | SIBA Midlands Independent Beer Awards\n| Keg Lager\n| Rebellion Lager\n|\n|\n|-\n| Cask British Bitter\n| Overthrow\n|\n|\n|-\n| Keg Pale Ale\n| 24 Carat\n|\n|\n|-\n| Keg Stout & Porter\n| Black\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | SIBA National Independent Beer Awards\n| Cask British Bitters (up to 4.4%)\n| Overthrow\n|\n|\n|-\n| Bottle/Can Session Lager & Pilsners\n| Rebellion Lager\n|\n|\n|-\n| Keg British Dark Beers (4.5 to 6.4%)\n| Black\n|\n|\nSee also\n* Brewery\n* List of microbreweries\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.rebellionbeer.co.uk/ Official website]"
