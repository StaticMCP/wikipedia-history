      "text": "# King Conan\n\nKing Conan is a collection of five fantasy short stories  by American writer Robert E. Howard featuring his  sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It is also the name of two separate comic book series featuring the character.\nThe book was first published in hardcover by Gnome Press in 1953. The stories originally appeared in the 1930s in the fantasy magazine Weird Tales. The collection never saw publication in paperback; instead, its component stories were divided and distributed among other \"Conan\" collections.\nChronologically, the five short stories collected as King Conan are the fourth in Gnome's Conan series; the novel Conan the Conqueror follows.\nContents\n*\"Introduction\" (L.

Schuyler Miller received the collection favorably, praising Howard's ability \"to make the preposterous doings of his superhuman hero so real.\"\nEverett F. Bleiler found that the original text of \"The Black Stranger\" \"is much superior to the adaptation\" provided here. He characterized the collection overall as \"a weak selection\", although singling out two scenes as effective.\nReferences"
