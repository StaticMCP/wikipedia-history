The Romans, led by dictator Gaius Sulpicius Peticus and his magister equitum, Marcus Valerius Poplicola, defeated the Gauls at their encampment near Pedum after a prolonged standoff.\nBackground\nNews of Gallic tribes in Latium had been common towards the end of 359 BC.  Upon hearing news of a force of Gauls entering Latium and encamping near Pedum, the Romans resolved to appoint Gaius Sulpicius Peticus as dictator, who, along with his magister equitum, Marcus Valerius Poplicola, quickly set off for Pedum in anticipation of an easy victory.\nUpon reaching Pedum, Peticus, to the displeasure of his men,  ordered that no soldier be permitted to attack without his command.  Peticus's men soon began publicly voicing their distaste for the dictator's orders.  The opposition culminated when Sextus Tullius, one of Peticus's senior centurions, delivered a speech to his men, denouncing Peticus's choice and effectively convincing Peticius to engage with the Gauls.\nBattle\nSkirmishing began between Romans and Gauls shortly after Tullius's address, prompting Peticus to formulate a strategy.  Peticus decided to send a mix of muleteers and cavalry atop a nearby mountain, and lined up the rest of his forces along the plains near base of the mountain.  The Gauls were quick to attack after they spotted the Romans descending the mountain, but the move ultimately resulted in disorder, and the Romans were able to rout both the right and left flanks of the Gaulish forces, driving them to retreat.  At this, Peticus ordered his cavalry and muleteers to intercept the fleeing Gallic army.\nAftermath\nPeticus, Poplicola, and the Roman force returned to Rome with a considerable amount of gold taken from the Gallic camps.  The spoils were brought to the Capitoline Hill and consecrated.\nReferences"
