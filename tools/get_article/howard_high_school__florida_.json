The building burned down in 1887, and a new school was built the next year at the corner of Adams and Bay, which is now Northwest Second Street and Northwest Seventh Avenue, at a cost of $1600. The teachers and additional financial support and the teachers came from the Freedmen's Bureau.

The building burned again in 1935, and was replaced with a new brick building. For years, books were provided after students were finished with them at the white schools.
