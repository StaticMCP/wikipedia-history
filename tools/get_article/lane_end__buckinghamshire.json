It is just south of the M40 from High Wycombe, about  west of Booker. The village is twinned with Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron in France.\nThe village is situated in the Chilterns, around  above sea level, in rolling hills of farmland, beech woods and footpaths.\nThe civil parish includes the hamlets of Cadmore End, Ditchfield, Moor Common and Moor End, and had a population of 3,583 at the 2001 Census.\nThe largest and most popular road in Lane End is Simmons Way.\nHistory\nLane End was historically on the borders of the parishes of Great Marlow, Hambleden, Fingest and West Wycombe, with a small part (Ackhampstead) belonging to the parish of Lewknor in Oxfordshire until 1895. In 1867, the ecclesiastical parish of Lane End was formed from the neighbouring parishes.  The village continued to be divided among the four neighbouring civil parishes until 1934, when the parts within Great Marlow, Hambleden and West Wycombe civil parishes were transferred to Fingest (renamed Fingest and Lane End in 1937).  In the 1980s the parish of Fingest and Lane End was abolished, and the civil parish of Lane End was formed.\nIn addition to working the land to provide wheat and barley to the breweries in Marlow and Henley, the inhabitants traditionally manufactured chairs or worked in a local iron foundry.\nDuring the Second World War, King Zog of Albania lived at Parmoor House in Frieth, a hamlet a mile south of Lane End, and with many Albanians living in Lane End, used to attend village events.\nAccording to local legend, the village is haunted by the ghost of a girl in a red dress, who died two weeks before her wedding day in 1766.\nSchool\nThe main school in Lane End is Lane End Primary School which is situated on three acres of land. It has a total pupil capacity of 210, and teaches 2-11 year olds. The school is defined as a mixed, community school and has an Ofsted rating of Good.\nLane End Primary School's facilities include a nursery for children ages 2-4; seven classrooms which are equipped for teaching students throughout the years; a refurbished learning cafe, which was opened on 15 May 2017; natural areas including a pond. Lane End Community Centre is situated on the school grounds.\nThe school is often likened to Haddenham, Buckinghamshire  Junior School for their similarities.\nThe Headteacher is Mrs D Williams.\nChurches\nThe oldest church in the village is the Methodist church which started as a congregational church, meeting in a chapel in Marlow Road in 1801.  Later this was replaced by a chapel, built in 1835, which is now Lane End Studios.  A Wesleyan chapel was built in 1866, but the congregation now meets at the Parish Church.\nThe parish is served by the church of the Holy Trinity in Ditchfield Common, which was designed by John Oldrid Scott and built in 1878, replacing one built in 1832. The arch brace trusses, purlins and wind braces of the roof are from Marlow's medieval Manor Hall, built c.1200 and demolished in 1878. These were rescued by Thomas Somers-Cocks of Thames Bank, Marlow, who bought the roof timbers and paid for their carriage to Lane End where they fit Scott's nave perfectly.\nA Gospel mission hall dating from 1888 at Moor End now meets as the Elim Christian Centre in the centre of the village near the large estate area.\nHoly Trinity Church Lane End\nAmenities\nLane End Youth and Community Centre is used for activities including classes, lunches for local elderly residents, band practice, and private functions.\nThe parish council meets at the village hall, whose other uses include dances and The Lane End Players.\nThe village has two ponds, one on the High Street, the other approximately 80m away on The Row.\nLane End has been twinned with St Pierre d'Oleron on the West coast of France since 1999.
