The libretto, an adaptation of Marie von Borch's German translation of the fairy-tale play Der var engang by the Danish author Holger Drachmann, was written by Maximilian Singer.\nPerformance history\nThe opera was first performed on 22 January 1900 at the Vienna State Opera conducted by Gustav Mahler with Selma Kurz and Erik Schmedes in the principal roles. Mahler insisted on numerous changes during rehearsals: the closing portion of Act One was reworked and several cuts implemented, including the central section of the Prelude. The successful premiere resulted in a run of twelve performances. Zemlinsky made further revisions in 1912. Revivals followed in Mannheim in May of that year (with Zemlinsky's former pupil Artur Bodanzky conducting), and in October at the Neues Deutsches Theater in Prague, under the composer's direction.\nRoles\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role\n!Voice type\n!Premiere Cast22 January 1900(Conductor: Gustav Mahler)\n|-\n|Princess|| soprano || Selma Kurz\n|-\n|Prince|| tenor || Erik Schmedes\n|-\n|Kaspar || baritone || Wilhelm Hesch\n|-\n|King || bass || Franz von Reichenberg\n|-\n|A suitor || tenor || Franz Pacal\n|-\n|A commissionaire || baritone || Arthur Preuß\n|-\n|Commander || bass ||  Ferdinand Marian\n|-\n|Herald ||  bass   ||  Benedikt Felix\n|-\n|First lady in waiting || soprano || Jenny Pohlner\n|}\nInstrumentation\n* 3 flutes (2nd and 3rd doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais), 2 clarinets in B-flat/A, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons (3rd ad lib);\n* 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, bass tuba;\n* timpani, percussion (cymbals, bass drum, side drum, triangle, glockenspiel), 2 harps;\n* strings\noffstage: 2 piccolos, 2 horns, 4 trumpets, trombone, tambourine, side drums, solo violin\nRecordings\nIn 1990 the German record label Capriccio released the world premiere recording: a June 1987 recording from Danish Radio with Hans Graf conducting the Danish National Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
