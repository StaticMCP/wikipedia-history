It was published initially by Oxford University Press and subsequently republished by Liberty Fund. Among the best-known admirers of and advocates for this book was W.H. Auden, who wrote: \"Since the appearance of the first edition in 1940, I have read this book many times, and my conviction of its importance to the understanding not only of the epoch with which it is concerned, but also of our own, has increased with each rereading\". It was also much admired by Harold Innis, who described it as \"the first major Canadian contribution to the intellectual history of the West\".\nSee also\n*W.H.
