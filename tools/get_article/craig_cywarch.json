The nearest village is Dinas Mawddwy on the A470.\nClimbing routes on the various buttresses range from E2 to V Diff. Access paths can be rather overgrown and even finding the bottom of the routes can be rather difficult.\nSee also\n* Aran Fawddwy\nReferences\n* Paul Williams, Rock Climbing in Snowdonia\nExternal links\n*[https://www.geograph.org.uk/search.php?i=3531310 www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Craig Cywarch and surrounding area]\n* http://www.geologywales.co.uk/storms/winter0405c.htm"
