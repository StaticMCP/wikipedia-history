It stars Chris Barrie as Gordon Brittas, the well-meaning but incompetent manager of a leisure centre in Southern England. It first aired between 1991 and 1997 on BBC1. It was created by Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss, who together co-wrote the first five series (1991–1996). A total of seven series and 52 episodes were created, including two Christmas specials (1994 and 1996) and two short sketches for Children In Need (in 1995 and 1996 respectively). Most of the main characters are in all episodes, but Laura is only in the first five series. Helen Brittas is in all but one episode (in series four); Linda does not appear in two episodes of the first series. Angie is only in series one, and her replacement is Julie, played by Judy Flynn, who is in all episodes from series two onwards, except for the 1996 Christmas special.\nThe cast appeared all in character for the Royal Variety Performance of 1996, and the success of the series has resulted in it being released on VHS and DVD by 2 Entertain, BBC Warner, and Eureka Video throughout the 1990s and 2000s. An audiobook, read by Barrie as Brittas, was also released.\nEpisodes\nSeries 1 (1991)\nAll episodes were filmed and produced in 1990 and broadcast on BBC1 Thursdays at 20:30.\n|ShortSummary=Gordon Brittas arrives at Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre to find enthusiastic staff, but receptionist Carole is depressed. She gave birth three weeks ago and her husband left her for her best friend. Within minutes of arrival, Brittas brings along some very complicated rotas, which he refuses to change, upsetting the staff - one of whom tries to drop a table tennis table onto him. In response to Brittas' condescending attitude, the cleaner walks away. The builders react to Brittas by going on strike and pouring concrete into his car. Councillor Dapping soon regrets the council appointing Brittas as manager of the new leisure centre.\n|LineColor=FF6C6C\n}}\n|ShortSummary=The Duchess of Kent is to visit the centre on its first day open to the public.

However, a misunderstanding involving a baby leads to him deciding not to return to her.

Witness to the madness is 17-year-old jobseeker Beverley.\n|LineColor=FF6C6C\n}}\n|ShortSummary=Brittas is convinced there is a thief amongst the staff, so he employs a series of methods to discover the culprit.
