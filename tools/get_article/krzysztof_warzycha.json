At international level, he played for the Poland national team, scoring nine goals in 50 appearances. In 1988, he won the Polish Footballer of the Year Award presented by the Piłka Nożna football weekly.\nClub career\nRuch Chorzów\nWarzycha played for Polish team Ruch Chorzów, won the Polish Championship in 1989 and was the top scorer in the Polish premier league the same year.\nPanathinaikos\nWarzycha joined Panathinaikos in December 1989, and won five Greek championships (1990, 1991, 1995, 1996, 2004), five Greek cups (1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2004), two Greek super cups 1993, 1994, while he was the highest scorer of the Greek championship 3 times (1994, 1995, 1998).\nHe is Panathinaikos' all-time leading goalscorer and an idol for the club. Warzycha is considered by many to be one of the best foreign players who have played in Greece. He was one of two Poles in the title-winning side of 1995, with fellow countryman Józef Wandzik keeping over a dozen clean sheets (shutouts) during the season.\nHe is the top scorer of Panathinaikos with 319 goals in all competitions.\nThe most iconic goal\nOn 3 April 1996, Warzycha scored probably the most important goal of his career (according to a late interview), against Ajax Amsterdam in 1995–96 UEFA Champions League Semi-Finals in Amsterdam Olympic Stadium [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RESiNeJRNw8] and gave Ajax their first home defeat in four years, in their last home match before the demolition of the stadium.\nFirst goal scorer\nAt the end of the 2000–01 season, Warzycha had scored an incredible 235 goals in 352 matches and had been the Greek Alpha Ethniki premier league's top scorer in three different years in the 90s (1994, 1995 and 1998 seasons). His appearances in the UEFA Champions League have been no less impressive – he scored six goals in Panathinaikos' nine games on the way to the semi-finals of the 1995–96 competition.\nWith eight goals scored in all UEFA Champions League games, Warzycha remained the best scorer of Polish nationality in this competition until the 2012–13 season, when Robert Lewandowski scored 10 times for Dortmund in Dortmund's surprise run to the Champions League final.\nOn 29 April 2001, during a match against Ionikos FC, Warzycha scored the 233rd goal of his career in Greece, climbing to second place on the list of all-time goal scorers, tied with Mimis Papaioannou. Warzycha later scored his 234th goal and become sole occupant of this spot.\nHe was granted Greek citizenship in 1998. He retired in 2004.\nManagerial career\nAfter Panathinaikos head coach Henk Ten Cate was let go on 8 December 2009, Warzycha was appointed as assistant coach alongside Nikos Nioplias.\nOn 1 March 2012, Warzycha was appointed as the head coach of Delta Ethniki side Egaleo, with this being his first venture into management.\nIn 2012, Warzycha was the head coach of Fokikos.\nIn April 2017, he was appointed manager of Ruch Chorzów, replacing Waldemar Fornalik.\nInternational career\nWarzycha played 50 times for Poland, scoring nine goals. He played his last game for the Poland national team in April 1997 against Italy in Napoli, in a 3–0 loss.\nLater life\nWarzycha ran in the Greek local elections, 2014 with a New Democracy backed combination for the municipality of Athens. He was also an ANEL candidate to parliament in January 2015 legislative elections, but without success.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Greek Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Europe\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"15\"|Panathinaikos\n|1989–90\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||21||14||0||0||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|—|||23||15\n|-\n|1990–91\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||31||18||0||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||35||18\n|-\n|1991–92\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||21||12||0||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||25||12\n|-\n|1992–93\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||33||32||0||0||4||4||colspan=\"2\"|—||37||36\n|-\n|1993–94\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||31||24||0||0||4||2||1||0||36||26\n|-\n|1994–95\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||33||29||0||0||4||3||1||0||38||32\n|-\n|1995–96\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||32||19||0||0||11||6||colspan=\"2\"|—||43||25\n|-\n|1996–97\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||34||21||4||1||4||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||42||23\n|-\n|1997–98\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||34||32||7||3||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||41||35\n|-\n|1998–99\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||25||12||5||5||6||2||colspan=\"2\"|—||36||19\n|-\n|1999–00\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||30||9||4||0||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||37||10\n|-\n|2000–01\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||27||13||8||3||13||3||colspan=\"2\"|—||48||19\n|-\n|2001–02\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||12||6||8||3||2||0||colspan=2|—||22||9\n|-\n|2002–03\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||21||3||7||2||6||3||colspan=\"2\"|—||34||8\n|-\n|2003–04\n|Alpha Ethniki\n||5||0||4||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||9||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Panathinaikos Total\n!390!!244!!47!!17!!63!!25!!2!!0!!502!!286\n|}\nInternational\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by national team and year\n|-\n!National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"14\"|Poland\n|1984||2||0\n|-\n|1985||0||0\n|-\n|1986||0||0\n|-\n|1987||4||0\n|-\n|1988||6||1\n|-\n|1989||13||3\n|-\n|1990||6||0\n|-\n|1991||3||0\n|-\n|1992||3||2\n|-\n|1993||3||1\n|-\n|1994||2||0\n|-\n|1995||1||0\n|-\n|1996||4||2\n|-\n|1997||3||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total!!50!!9\n|}\n:''Scores and results list Poland's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Warzycha goal.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ List of international goals scored by Krzysztof Warzycha\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|No.\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Venue\n!scope=\"col\"|Opponent\n!scope=\"col\"|Score\n!scope=\"col\"|Result\n!scope=\"col\"|Competition\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|1 || 19 October 1988 || Silesian Stadium, Chorzów, Poland ||  || align=\"center\"|1–0 || align=\"center\"|1–0 || 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|2 || rowspan=\"2\"|7 February 1989 || rowspan=\"2\"|Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica, San José, Costa Rica || rowspan=\"2\"| || align=\"center\"|1–0 || rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|4–2 || rowspan=\"2\"|Friendly\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|3 || align=\"center\"|3–0\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|4 || 12 February 1989 || Estadio Mateo Flores, Guatemala City, Guatemala ||  || align=\"center\"|1–0 || align=\"center\"|1–0 || Friendly\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|5 || 19 May 1992 || Stadion Lehen, Salzburg, Austria ||  || align=\"center\"|3–1 || align=\"center\"|4–2 || Friendly\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|6 || 27 May 1992 || City Stadium, Jastrzębie-Zdrój, Poland ||  || align=\"center\"|1–0 || align=\"center\"|1–0 || Friendly\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|7 || 19 May 1993 || Stadio Olimpico, Serravalle, San Marino ||  || align=\"center\"|3–0 || align=\"center\"|3–0 || 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|8 || 27 August 1996 || Stadion GKS, Bełchatów, Poland ||  || align=\"center\"|1–0 || align=\"center\"|2–2 || Friendly\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|9 || 10 November 1996 || Stadion GKS Katowice, Katowice, Poland ||  || align=\"center\"|2–0 || align=\"center\"|2–1 || 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification\n|}\nHonours\nRuch Chorzów\n*Ekstraklasa: 1988–89\n*II liga, group I: 1987–88\nPanathinaikos\n*Alpha Ethniki: 1989–90, 1990–91, 1994–95, 1995–96, 2003–04\n*Greek Cup: 1990–91, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95, 2003–04\n*Greek Super Cup: 1993, 1994\nIndividual\n* Piłka Nożna'' Polish Footballer of the Year: 1988\n*Ekstraklasa top scorer: 1988–89 (24 goals)\n*Marlboro Cup top scorer: 1989 Chicago (4 goals)\n* Super League Greece top scorer: 1993–94 (24 goals), 1994–95 (29 goals), 1997–98 (32 goals)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n}}\n}}"
