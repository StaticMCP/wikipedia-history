There, he worked for various newspapers and became the founder-editor of the Natal Advertiser, a newspaper that was published until 1937. The Natal Advertiser publicized the prospects for wealth from gold mining and fully supported British imperialism.\nMathers also wrote guides and handbooks for British migrants. In the 1880s, he travelled throughout the Transvaal gold fields, wrote about them, and became the first journalist to foretell their great future prospects.\nReturning to England in 1888, Mathers founded the weekly newspaper South Africa, and inaugurated annual South African dinners in London. The newspaper South Africa was published from 1889 to 1961.\nPersonal life\nIn Durban, South Africa, on 6 August 1885, Mathers married Mary Augusta Powys, a daughter of R. H.
