Guest appearances include Slug of Atmosphere, Muja Messiah and Malcolm.\nBackground\nWhen first creating the album, I Self Devine and DJ Kool Akiem had in mind to involve the album into present day news, and the name of the record was first named The Emperor & the Terrorist in response to the 9/11 attacks. However, the group decided to change the name when getting closer to release as to avoid any controversy.\nTrack listing\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.discogs.com/Micranots-The-Emperor-The-Assassin/release/1377547 The Emperor & the Assassin] at Discogs"
