First, Różyński went to his estate in ,Pavoloch where he dealt harshly with the peasants accused of participating in the unrest. After achieving a few local successes, he moved toward Bila Tserkva, where Shaula and Nalyvaiko were also heading.\nBattle\nOn the night of April 2-3, seven thousand Cossacks armed with sabres and handguns appeared at the city walls. In Bila Cerkiew, Różyński had only five hundred soldiers from Żółkiewski's company and his own posts, but Żółkiewski rushed to help him, despite the terrible condition of the softened, muddy roads, covered with a fresh layer of snow. Różyński, having learned about the approaching Cossacks, attacked Shaula, who had not expected such a quick reaction from the Polish side and, after the destruction of the camp, saved himself by escaping. Supposedly thousands of Cossacks were killed in this attack. In the meantime, Nalewajko's troops entered Bila Tserkva, which had been abandoned by Różyński. When Różyński returned from the pursuit, he was unexpectedly attacked by them, so he locked himself in the fortress and sent a messenger to Żółkiewski asking for help. Stanisław Żółkiewski did not wait for news from Różyński, hearing the sounds of battle, he set off on a forced march towards the city. Events began to take an unfavourable turn for the Cossacks, so they began to retreat to Trypillia.\nAftermath\nHaving realized that the Cossacks had recently fled, Żółkiewski quickly went after them. He caught up with them a few kilometers outside the city, because the Cossacks, knowing the hetman's energy and his eagerness to fight, had managed to form a camp of their own. Żółkiewski attacked them at Ostry Kamień.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
