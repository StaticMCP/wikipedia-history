It serves small farmers and loggers who use draft horses, mules, and oxen in their business. The former headquarters was in Gainesboro, Tennessee. The headquarters of the magazine is in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It is self-published on a small Iowa farm and distributes its issues mainly through direct mailing.
