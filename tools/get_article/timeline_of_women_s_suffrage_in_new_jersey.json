Women and African Americans had the right to vote in New Jersey until the state constitution was changed in 1807, disenfranchising all but white men. Any early suffrage protest was taken by Lucy Stone in 1857 who refused to pay her property taxes because she could not vote. Additional attempts to make women more equal under the law took place in the 1880s and 1890s. There were also several court cases that challenged women's right to vote in the state. Eventually, a voter referendum on a state constitutional suffrage amendment took place in 1915, however the measure was voted down. Activists continued to fight both in the state and to protest in Washington, D.C. as Silent Sentinels. By February 10, 1920, New Jersey ratified the Nineteenth Amendment.\n18th century\n1770s\n1776\n* The Constitution of New Jersey allows men and women who meet the property requirement to vote.\n1780s\n1787\n* Two women appear on a New Jersey polling list.\n1790s\n1797\n* October 18: A poem about women's suffrage is published in the Newark Centinel of Freedom.\n*Women in New Jersey vote in much greater numbers after this year.\n19th century\n, appearing in ''Harper's Weekly'' in 1880]]\n1800s\n1802\n* African Americans and women vote in Hunterdon County.\n1807\n* Women lose the right to vote in New Jersey under the claim that this is \"election reform.\"\n1820s\n1824\n* It is reported that a few widows voted in Barnsboro.\n1840s\n1844\n* June 18: John C.
