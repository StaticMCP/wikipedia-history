Modelled on the Old French chanson de geste, it was composed in two distinct parts: William of Tudela wrote the first towards 1213, and an anonymous continuator finished the account. However, recent studies have proposed the troubadour Gui de Cavalhon as the author of the second part. It is one of three major contemporary narratives of the Albigensian Crusade, the Historia Albigensis of Pierre des Vaux-de-Cernay and the Chronica of William of Puylaurens being the others.\nThere is a single surviving manuscript of the whole Song (fr. 25425 in the Bibliothèque nationale), written in or around Toulouse about 1275.\nContents\nFirst part\nThe first was written by William of Tudela (he names himself as \"maestre W.\" in laisses 1 and 9).\nThe author also names the date of the beginning of the composition, as 1210 (laisse 9).\nIt comprises the first 2749 lines, in 130 laisses (rhymed stanzas of varying length), and takes the story to the beginning of 1213.\nIt is strongly partisan, in favour of the Crusaders and against their opponents, the Cathars and southerners in general. The text has the earliest use of the term crusade (as crozada).\nSecond part\nThe second part comprises the remaining 6811 lines of the poem, in laisses 131 to 214. The author's identity is not certain, although the name of Gui de Cavalhon has been recently proposed. This second part covers events from 1213 onwards and takes the opposite point of view, critical of the Crusaders and strongly in favour of the southerners (though not of Catharism). To historians the Song is important for this whole period because it is the only major narrative source that takes the southern viewpoint; it is especially important from April 1216 to June 1219, because the prose narrative by Pierre des Vaux-de-Cernay becomes more sketchy and incomplete from 1216 onwards.\nThe author was apparently an educated man, displaying some knowledge of theology and law, and belonged to the diocese of Toulouse (since he calls bishop Folquet de Marselha \"our bishop\"). Michel Zink suggests that he was with Raymond VII of Toulouse in Rome and Provence during the years 1215 and 1216. The poet mentions the death of Guy of Montfort, which actually took place in 1228; it is questionable whether the whole of part 2 was written after that date, or whether the reference to Guy's death was a later insertion.\nSaverio Guida has proposed that Gui de Cavalhon may be the author. Gui, besides being a troubadour, was also a noble, and one of the most faithful allies of Raymond VI of Toulouse.\nEditions and translations\nThe text was first edited by Claude Charles Fauriel in 1837.\nThe first critical edition was published with a French translation, as Chanson de la croisade contre les albigeois, by Paul Meyer in two volumes (1875–1879).\nEugène Martin-Chabot published another multi-volume edition and French translation under the title Chanson de la croisade albigeoise (1931–1961).\nGougaud (1992) published a new single-volume French translation.\nAn English translation was published by  Shirley (1996).\nReferences\n*Fauriel, Claude,  Histoire de la croisade contre les hérétiques albigeois, Imprimerie Royale, Paris (1837).\n*Meyer, Paul, ed. and tr.,, Chanson de la croisade contre les albigeois.
