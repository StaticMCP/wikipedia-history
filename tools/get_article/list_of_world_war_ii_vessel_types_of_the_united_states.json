This list includes submarines, battleships, minelayers, oilers, barges, pontoon rafts and other types of water craft, boats and ships.  this list is not complete.\nArmy\nUnder the Army organization of 1940, the Army Quartermaster was charged with the responsibility of providing the Army with all water transport services except those specifically authorized; for the Corps of Engineers in river and harbor work, for the Coast Artillery Corps in mine planting, and for the Signal Corps in cable laying (the Army had no communication ships at this time). In March 1942, most of the transportation functions of the Army Quartermaster were consolidated into the Transportation Division of the newly created Services of Supply and later that same year, on 31 July, the Transportation Corps was established.\nCoast Artillery Corps Mine Planter Service\nThe Army Mine Planter Service was responsible for the minefields of the Coast Artillery Corps' coast defenses. The largest vessels of the service were the U.S. Army Mine Planter (USAMP), which was equipped to install mines and associated control cables. Smaller vessels known as \"junior mine planters\" or \"pup planters\", were occasionally employed as mine planters, but they mostly served as freight and passenger boats for river and harbor duty with the Harbor Boat Service. In addition to the mine planters, there were distribution box boats, used for servicing the mine-cable distribution boxes and rugged utility boats called motor mine yawls.\nMine ships\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Glassford (BSP-2098)\nCommunication ships\nArmy communications ships in the South West Pacific theater of World War II provided radio relay services and acted as command posts for forward elements ashore.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

An \"S\" fleet under Army control was created using local Australian vessels crewed largely by civilian Australians and New Zealanders. It was a miscellaneous collection of luggers, rusty trawlers, old schooners, launches, ketches, yawls, and yachts.\nWater Branch - Army Transport Service (ATS)\nThe Army Transport Service (ATS), originating with the Quartermaster Corps in 1898 and continuing into Transportation Corps as a division, operated the Army's large ships, most of which were transports, but ATS also manned the Army's large cable ships.\n; Troop ships\nTroop ships  included the following.\nSurviving examples include:\n* USAT Agwileon\n* USAT George Washington\n* USAT Orizaba\n; Sunk\n* USAT Cynthia Olsen (sunk 7 December 1941)\n* USAT Meigs\n* USAT Liberty\n* USAT General John McE. Hyde\n; Cargo ships over 1,000 tons\nCargo ships moved freight around the world.\nHarbor Branch - Harbor Boat Service (HBS)\nFM 55-130 Small Boats and Harbor Craft\n; Harbor Vessels\nThe Harbor Craft Company is organized for the purpose of ferrying to shore cargo from freighters and transports arriving in theaters of operation. The vessels may either be riding offshore at anchor in the open sea or more likely, anchored in a harbor. Cargo from the ships is loaded by Transportation Corps port company personnel onto barges. Then tugs, tow boats, or marine tractors propel the barges to the shore for unloading. Any cargo too heavy for the vessel's gear to lift is handled by a 60-ton floating crane.\n* B Barge or Lorcha\n* BB Balloon Barge\n* BBP Balloon Barrage Leader\n* BC Cargo Barge (Med. 110'-130')\n* BCS Cargo Barge (Sm. 45' - 60')\n* BCL Cargo Barge (Large - 210' or more)\n* BD Derrick and Crane Barges\n* BDP Pontoon Derrick Barge\n* BK Knocked-down barge\n* BG Gasoline Barge\n* BSP Self-propelled Barge\n* BW Water Barge\n* BTL Truck Lighter\n* C Navy Type Launch (Obsolete designation)\n* CL Landing Boat\n* D Dory and Dinghie\n* G Marine Tractor\n* HA Hoisting or Retrieving Vessel\n* JR Radio Controlled Boat\n* J Launch up to 50'\n* MT Motor Towboat (Sm. 26')\n* MTL Motor Towboat (Large, over 26')\n* OB Outboard Launch - Detachable Motor\n* OBM Outboard Motor - Stationary Motor\n* Q Launch, more than 60'\n* R Rowboat\n* TKL Tank Lighter\n* V Speed Boat\n* Y Tanker - 176'\n; Cargo ships under 1,000 tons\nCoastwise and inter-island cargo ships, sometimes known as coastal freighters.\n; Small Boat Company\nThe small boat company provided regular coastal and island service to bases in the Aleutian and Pacific Islands to supply food and equipment transported by small coastal and inter-island vessels and water craft that were under 200 feet or under 1,000 gross tons of the following vessel types.\n* Ferry\n* Tanker\n* Water Boat\n* Motor Launch\n* Seagoing Tug\n* Freight-Passenger Vessel\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

There are two classifications of craft: amphibious warfare ships which are built to cross oceans, and landing craft, which are designed to take troops from ship to shore in an invasion. Some vessels called \"landing ships\" did not have the capability to off-load troops and supplies onto beaches; they were just transports or command-and-control vessels.\nShips\n* AGC: Amphibious
