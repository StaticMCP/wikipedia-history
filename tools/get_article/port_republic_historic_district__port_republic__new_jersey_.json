It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 16, 1991, for its significance in architecture, engineering, industry, and maritime history. The district has 110 contributing buildings, including the individually listed Amanda Blake Store, and four other contributing sites.\nHistory and description\nThe oldest part of the Franklin Inn and Store was constructed around 1750. The inn might be named after the New Jersey colonial governor, William Franklin, a frequent visitor. It was later owned by Sea Captain Micajah Smith in the late 18th century. The larger brick section was built around 1815 by Jonas Miller. It was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) in 1940.\nThe Amanda Blake Store was built in 1884 and served as a general store and post office. St. Paul's Methodist Church was completed in 1871 and features Gothic architecture and Romanesque architecture.\nFile:Historic Port Republic sign, NJ.jpg|Historic Port Republic sign\nFile:Historic American Buildings Survey R.
