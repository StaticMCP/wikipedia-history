It has been described as a \"naïve blend of Crosby, Stills & Nash, Dylan & the Band, and Buffalo Springfield, with a heavy dose of early Yes\" (Stephen Thomas Erlewine).\nThe cover was designed by Barney Bubbles for his short-lived graphic art company \"Teenburger Designs\". The original vinyl album (Capitol 11869) was re-issued on CD in 1996 (Repertoire 0004421).\nTrack listing\nAll songs are written by Nick Lowe except where specified\n# \"Hymn to Me\" (Lowe, Rankin, Schwarz, Andrews) – 4:50\n# \"Shining Brightly\" – 4:20\n# \"Rock and Roll Women\" – 3:19\n# \"Lady Constant\" – 7:23\n# \"What Do You Suggest?\" – 4:47\n# \"Mayfly\" – 4:37\n# \"Ballad of a Has Been Beauty Queen\" – 10:26\nPersonnel\n;Brinsley Schwarz\n* Brinsley Schwarz - guitar, percussion, vocals\n* Billy Rankin - drums, percussion\n* Bob Andrews - keyboards, bass, vocals\n* Nick Lowe - bass, acoustic guitar, slide guitar, vocals\n;Technical\n*Bob Hall - engineer\n*Teenburger Designs - cover design, typography\nReferences"
