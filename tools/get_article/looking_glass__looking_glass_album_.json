Davis, who at the time was the president of Columbia Records, signed them to the Epic Records label. After trying to record two times (once with Steve Cropper in Memphis), the band began working with Bob Liftin and recorded \"Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)\". It was not released as the single's A-side, but as the B-side to \"Don't It Make You Feel Good\" in early 1972. The song went unnoticed by most, but not by Harv Moore, a disc jockey in Washington, D.C. The song would go on to peak 6 months after its release, and the album charted for 16 weeks in the U.S.\nCritical reception\nIn his review of the album, Robert Christgau said simply: \"This automatic good time doesn't even have the courage of its own slickness.\"\nTrack listing\nOriginal LP order listed. The cassette listing differs in that \"From Stanton Station\" replaces \"Brandy\" on the A-Side while \"Brandy\" opens the B-Side.\nPersonnel\n;Looking Glass\n*Elliot Lurie – Guitars, lead vocals\n*Pieter \"Piet\" Sweval – Bass, lead vocals, harp on \"Catherine Street\" and \"From Stanton Station\"\n*Larry Gonsky – Keyboards, background vocals\n*Jeff Grob – Drums\n;Additional personnel\n*Chuck Connolly – Backup vocals on \"Brandy\"\n*Tasha Thomas, Barbara Massey, Carolyn Davis – Backup vocals on \"Don't It Make You Feel Good\" (credited as Tasha Thomas and the Feel Good Girls)\n*Eddie Hinton – Guitar (with Elliot Lurie) on \"Golden Rainbow\"\n*James Giampa – Congas on \"Brandy\"\n*Larry Fallon – Horns/Strings arrangements\n*Tim Geelan, Wayne Tarnowski, Pete Weiss (on \"Brandy\", uncredited), Billy Radice – Engineer\n*Ed Lee – Cover design\n*KLN Photos Inc. – Cover photo\n*Bob Liftin – Producer/Audio Consultant\n*Mike Gershman – Executive producer\n*Steve Paley – Special thanks/Back cover photo\n*Don Ellis, Steve Baron, Sandy Linzer, Karmic Guardians – Special thanks\nAll songs published by Evie Music Inc./ Spruce Run Music and Chappell & Co., Inc.
