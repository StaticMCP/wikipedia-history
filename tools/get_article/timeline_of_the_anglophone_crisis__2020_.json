      "text": "# Timeline of the Anglophone Crisis (2020)\n\nThis is a timeline of the Anglophone Crisis in Cameroon during 2020.\nThe Anglophone Crisis is an ongoing armed conflict in the Republic of Cameroon in Central Africa, where historically English-speaking Ambazonian separatists are seeking the independence of the former British trust territory of Southern Cameroons, which has been unified with Cameroon since 1961.\nJanuary\n* On January 1, suspected separatists burned down the office of the Divisional Officer of Muyuka, after clashing with soldiers in the area. In Buea, separatists clashed with Cameroonian soldiers and burned a vehicle. In Donga Mantung, six people were killed in a Cameroonian raid. In Bamessing, Cameroonian forces started a four-day clean-up of road blocks mounted by separatists. The same day, the Ambazonia Military Forces declared that a lockdown encompassing all of Southern Cameroons would take place between February 7 and 12, in order to prevent the 2020 Cameroonian parliamentary election from taking place in the Anglophone regions. The separatists declared that anyone caught outdoors in cities and villages during the lockdown would be considered an enemy, and stated that the declaration had been issued weeks in advance in order to give people time stock up food and prepare.\n* On January 2, civilians in Balikumbat demonstrated against the separatists, accusing them of forcing people to give them money and of bringing insecurity to the village. The protest was guarded by Cameroonian soldiers.\n* On January 4, residents of Balikumbat stormed nearby separatist camp, seized weapons and arrested fighters.\n* On January 5, Fon Ndofoa Zofoa III of Babungo gave separatist fighters in the vicinity 24 hours to release villagers they had abducted, threatening to expel the fighters' families from the village. He also urged villagers to assist the Cameroonian security forces if they could. In response to the ultimatum, armed separatists attempted to storm the palace and abduct the Fon, but villagers intervened and stopped the separatists. In Babessi, separatist fighters abducted the SDF mayor along with at least four councillors. In Ndu, a detainee died after being tortured by Cameroonian soldiers.\n* On January 6, \"General Divine\", a separatist commander based in Meme Division, was killed by his own men, who accused him of terrorizing nearby communities. According to sources, fellow separatists had warned him many times not to commit atrocities against civilians, and when he did not stop, they finally decided to get rid of him. Another commander was also killed during the incident. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the upcoming February 9 election, 350 Cameroonian soldiers were deployed to various locations in Southwest Region to protect voters.\n* On January 7, nine suspected separatists arriving on bikes stormed a gendarme post in Bangourain, West Region. The sole gendarme on duty ran away, enabling the attackers to capture weapons and ammunition without encountering any resistance. In Donga-Mantung, separatists burned down the ELECAM office in Misaje, as part of their campaign to disrupt the February election.\n* By January 8, there had been at least five instances where villagers had attacked separatist camps. Separatist leaders openly condemned war crimes committed by fellow separatists, and the Ambazonia Defence Forces ordered its fighters to arrest anyone caught terrorizing civilians. Separatists also claimed that some of the separatist excesses were actually false-flag actions conducted by Cameroonian forces, an allegation strongly denied by Cameroon. In Meme Division, at least five separatist fighters laid down their arms.\n* On January 9, 350 gendarmes deployed in Northwest Region to counter the separatist effort to sabotage the upcoming elections, following a similar deployment in Southwest Region. In Santa, Cameroonian soldiers invaded the village Mbenjom Awing, killing two separatist fighters, one civilian as well as livestock, and burning down several houses.\n* On January 10, five soldiers of the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) were arrested for abducting a man in Buea.\n* On January 11, a prominent officer of the Red Dragon militia was killed while leading an attack on Cameroonian forces in Menji.\n* On January 12, suspected separatists burned down the residence of CPDM politician Kennedy Acha in Bamenda.\n* On January 13, separatists ambushed and killed one Cameroonian soldier and injured another in Muyuka.\n* On January 14, Cameroonian troops raided the villages of Bangem and Babubock, burning dozens of houses.\n* On January 15, separatist fighters ambushed and killed a Cameroonian soldier in Bamenda. The soldier's girlfriend was also wounded in the incident. In Bamenda, separatists attacked two civilians who had attempted to circumvent a separatist checkpoint, killing one of them and injuring the other.\n* On January 16, separatists ambushed Cameroonian soldiers in Mamfe. The death toll was not revealed.\n* On January 18, a gun battle occurred between Cameroonian soldiers and separatist fighters in Mulang, Bamenda, after the separatists had set fire to a garbage truck. The separatists eventually withdrew to their base in Ntasen. In Meluf, six dead bodies were discovered by villagers. Local sources reported that the dead were ADF fighters who had been abducted and killed by the Southern Cameroons Restoration Forces. It was also reported that the six dead were among a total of 40 ADF fighters who had been abducted. ADF spokesman Tapang Ivo Tanku confirmed the loss. Both the ADF and the Southern Cameroons Restoration Forces condemned each other, while both claimed that the infighting owed to infiltration by the Cameroonian Army. The Cameroonian Army denied this claim.\n* On January 19, \"General Chacha\" of the Southern Cameroons Restoration Forces posted a video where he demanded that all separatist groups submit to his militia.\n* On January 21, suspected separatist abducted 24 school children in Kumba. Security forces rescued the hostages in an operation later the same day, \"neutralizing\" two of the abductors in the process. In Kondengui Central Prison, other prisoners broke into the cells of Sisiku Julius Ayuk Tabe and nine other Ambazonian leaders serving a life sentence, stealing food and money. The victims wrote a letter in which they stated the prison administration had been silent on the matter, despite there being witnesses, and they claimed that there was a conspiracy threaten their lives.\n* On January 22, a soldier was killed in Ndoh. Cameroonian forces retaliated the next day, carrying out a mass shooting inside a market. At least 16 people were killed, and at least five were wounded.\n* On January 23, former Ambazonian general Leonard Nambere, who had returned to Cameroon on December 31, 2019 upon accepting an amnesty deal, went to visit inmates at the Kondengui Central Prison. He was nearly lynched by Anglophone inmates who blamed him for abandoning the Ambazonian cause, and had to be smuggled out of the prison. In Kumba, police officers clashed with separatist fighters, killing one fighter.\n* On January 26, General Chacha of the Southern Cameroons Restoration Forces was captured and summarily executed when Cameroonian soldiers raided his base in Kikaikom, Kumbo. Some estimated 20 other separatist fighters were also killed during the raid. Following the escalation, the Cameroonian police braced for the possibility that separatists could start carrying out attacks in Yaoundé, warning that there was already a network in place that could make such attacks possible. In Ndop, armed men took control of a local radio station and set the building on fire. No one claimed responsibility for the attack.\n* On January 27, Cameroonian forces launched three simultaneous assaults on separatist camps in Kikaikom, Kumbo. According to the Cameroonian Army, separatist losses were 13 dead, while the Cameroonian side suffered two wounded.\n* Between January 28–29, four people were killed when Cameroonian forces raided Mbiame and Nkambe.\n* On January 30, separatists abducted four staff members at a local NGO in Bamenda. The staff members were subjected to physical violence before being released the next day. Three staff members from a different organization were also abducted in Bamenda, but they were all released after it turned out that the separatists had mistaken them for being involved in organizing the upcoming election. In Buea, separatist fighters abducted a student; they chopped off her finger days later, before releasing her after a ransom had been paid.\nFebruary\n* On February 1, separatists carried out two separate attacks on a convoy transporting CPDM activists who were campaigning in Mbengwi and Bamenda.

In the village of Bakebe in Mamfe, at least six people were killed by Cameroonian soldiers.\n* On February 7, a separatist-imposed five-day lockdown, designed to prevent the Cameroonian parliamentary election from being held in the Anglophone regions, came into force.\n* On February 8, the Cameroonian parliamentary election was initiated. Due to the security situation, the turnout in the Anglophone regions was very low, with many civilians having fled days in advance. In addition, separatists had abducted at least 120 candidates within the past two weeks, half of whom were still in captivity on election day. According to the separatists, 98 percent of the population boycotted the election. The Cameroonian government claimed that there had been a massive turnout, and the electoral body Elecam claimed that there had been \"no major incidents\". The results in 11 constituencies were later nullified due to separatist activities on election day, triggering a partial reelection on March 22. In Bafut, separatists burned down a public building that was meant to be used as a polling station on election day. In Sabga, separatists attacked a military convoy, injuring three soldiers. In Ndop and Ndu, Cameroonian forces arrested hundreds of civilians, many of whom were forced to vote.\n* On February 9, two separatist fighters were killed in Babungu, and one Cameroonian soldier was killed in Befang. Fighting took place around several separatist roadblocks in rural areas. In Muyuka, heavy fighting practically prevented anyone from voting in the election. There were also armed clashes in Buea and Kumba.\n* On February 14, at least 22 civilians were massacred in Ntumbo, Northwest Region by Cameroonian soldiers. The Cameroonian Army quickly dismissed claims that a massacre had taken place; it claimed to have killed seven separatist fighters in Ntumbo, and that five civilians had died in a fire caused by an accidental explosion triggered by stray bullets. Independent sources were able to quickly establish that the actual number of civilian casualties was much higher than the figure presented by Cameroon. The massacre was condemned by the United Nations and the United States. After running its own investigation, the Cameroonian government maintained that the civilians who died in Ngarbuh had been accidentally killed during a battle with separatists, and that none of its soldiers had killed any civilians on purpose.\n* By February 16, at least 35 civilians had been killed and 40 houses had been burned down within less than a week.\n* On February 19, a soldier shot dead a civilian while running from security control. He was arrested the following day.\n* On February 24, Cameroonian soldiers arrested a man who had given information about the Ngarbuh massacre to international media.\n* On February 25, separatist fighters attacked a command post in Mendankwe, Bamenda, killing one soldier and wounding another three, killing one civilian engineer, abducting five people, destroying a military vehicle and capturing weapons.\n* On February 27, separatists attacked Cameroonian soldiers in Bamendakwe, Mezam Division, killing one soldier and abducting four people. One civilian was also killed during the attack.\n* On February 29, Cameroonian soldiers attacked Small Babanki, a village in Mezam Division, storming the home of separatist general Richard Nformumbang Ndango, known as \"General Fire\", killing him and his wife. Cameroon claimed to have killed 10 other separatists as well, while local witnesses claimed that the soldiers had massacred 10 civilians. Local sources also claimed that the soldiers had burned down 17 houses and confiscated livestock. In Bui, an alleged eyewitness to the Ngarbuh massacre was murdered.\nMarch\n* On March 1, Cameroonian soldiers raped 20 women, killed one man, and burned and plundered houses in Ebam, Southwest Region. 36 people were taken to a military camp, where many were subjected to severe beating and torture.

The separatists seized weapons before heading back to the Anglophone regions. The Interim Government of Ambazonia issued a statement where it claimed that none of its forces were responsible for the attack, as they fought exclusively within the Anglophone regions. This stance is not shared by the Ambazonia Governing Council (AGovC).\n* On March 8, an improvised explosive device killed one soldier and injured four soldiers, two police officers and one civilian in Bamenda. Following the explosion, five suspects were arrested. In Enyoh, Batibo Subdivision, villagers attacked and burned down a separatist camp and freed a number of prisoners, including the local Fon.\n* On March 9, separatist fighters attacked several police and gendarme units in Bamenda, triggering gunfights that lasted well into the night.\n* On March 10, separatists attacked a military post in Akwaya, Manyu Division.\n* On March 12, separatists killed five hostages, including two mayors.

According to Brigadier-General Valere Nka, among those killed were the ones who had carried out the raid on Galim on March 7. The separatists confirmed the loss of their camps, but claimed that the Cameroonian Army had suffered a higher number of soldiers killed. The Cameroonian Army denied suffering any losses at all. Local witnesses claimed that the Cameroonian soldiers had killed a number of civilians during the offensive; this was also denied by the Cameroonian Army. Meanwhile, a partial legislative election was initiated in 11 constituencies, where the election results from the February 9 elections had been nullified due separatist activities. Hundreds of soldiers were deployed to the 11 constituencies, where some 300,000 people had been asked to vote again. Separatists moved to disrupt the election, clashing with security forces in Bamenda where two civilians were killed in the crossfire. Just like in February, abstention rates were high. In Batibo, clashes lasted throughout much of the day. In Ekondo-Titi, separatist fighters killed two Cameroonian soldiers. In Bui, the Southern Cameroons Restoration Forces started enforcing an unannounced lockdown, effectively blocking all traffic from Jakiri to Kumbo.

This was later proven to be false.\n* On March 25, the Southern Cameroons Defence Forces declared a two-week ceasefire to give people time to get tested for COVID-19. The ceasefire would go into effect on March 29, and would last until April 12. The move was welcomed by the United Nations, which encouraged other groups to follow suit. The Interim Government of Ambazonia conditioned a ceasefire on it being a mutual understanding with Cameroon and observed by international parties. The AGovC supported a ceasefire in theory, but said that Cameroon had to confine its troops to their bases in order for the ADF to declare a ceasefire.\n* On March 28, an armored car transporting 11 officials and a soldier was ambushed by separatists in Oku, slipping off the road and falling into a valley. Eight people died in the crash, while four survivors were shot dead by the separatist fighters. Among the killed were two deputy mayors.\n* On March 29, the same day as the unilateral ceasefire declared by SOCADEF went into effect, President Sako declared the shutting of Ambazonia's borders and restriction of movement and public gatherings in order to limit the spreading of COVID-19.

According to this plan, the Cameroonian government would rebuild 350 schools, 115 health centers, six kilometers of roads including four bridges, roughly 12,000 homes, 45 markets and 500 kilometers of power lines. Separatists quickly denounced the plan, claiming that the government in Yaoundé had no right to carry out the plan in their country.\n* On April 8, in response to the government announcement the previous day, separatists launched attacks in villages across Anglophone regions, attacking military bases and destroying public buildings in Lebialem, Manyu, Bui, Donga-Mantung and Ngoketunjia. The Cameroonian military claimed to have killed 13 separatists during battles in Kumba, Vekovi, Tatum and Mbiame, while the separatists claimed to have inflicted higher losses on the Cameroonian military.\n* On April 8, unidentified individuals attempted to abduct a journalist in Bamenda.\n* On April 10, SOCADEF announced that it would extend its unilateral ceasefire to April 26.

When asked about his conditions for a ceasefire, Ayuk Tabe listed three; that it would be announced by President Paul Biya, that the Cameroonian military would pull out of the Anglophone regions, and a general amnesty for separatists.
