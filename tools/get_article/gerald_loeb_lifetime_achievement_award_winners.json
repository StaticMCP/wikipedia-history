Less obviously, but equally important, they can be judged by the stories they have kept out of the paper. Barney's legend at [The Wall Street Journal] is built on his talents in both realms. But Barney is perhaps best known for the way his tremendous news instincts are moored in something of incalculable value to journalism: an extraordinarily powerful moral compass.\"\n* 2006: Myron Kandel, founding financial editor at CNN\n* 2007: Matthew Winkler, editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News\n* 2008: Daniel Hertzberg, deputy managing editor for international at The Wall Street Journal\n* 2009: Bill Emmott, former editor-in-chief of The Economist\n* 2010: Walt Bogdanich, assistant investigative editor at The New York Times\n* 2011: Steven Pearlstein, columnist for The Washington Post\n::He \"has mastered the journalistic alchemy of making subjects that are complex and opaque into columns that are understandable and compelling.\"\n* 2012: Jerry Seib, deputy managing editor and Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal\n* 2013: John Huey, former editor-in-chief of Time Inc.\n* 2014: James Flanigan, former business journalist at the Los Angeles Times\n* 2015: James Grant, founder and editor of ''Grant's Interest Rate Observer\n* 2016: Paul Ingrassia, managing editor of Reuters\n* 2017: Walt Mossberg, executive editor of The Verge and editor-at-large for Recode\n* 2018: Joann Lublin, former management news editor of The Wall Street Journal\n* 2019: Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times\n* 2020: Lionel Barber, former editor of the Financial Times\n* 2021: Ellen Pollock, business editor of The New York Times\n* 2022: Michelle Singletary, personal advice columnist at The Washington Post\n* 2023: Stephen J.
