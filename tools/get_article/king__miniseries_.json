It aired for three consecutive nights on NBC from February 12 through 14, 1978.\nProduction\nSeveral real-life figures from the Civil Rights Movement had minor roles in the production, including then-Atlanta mayor Maynard Jackson, King's sister Christine King Farris, his niece Alveda King, and his four children: Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter and Bernice. Donzaleigh Abernathy, Tony Bennett, Julian Bond and Ramsey Clark each portrayed themselves.\nReception\nThe miniseries earned nine Emmy Award nominations, including nominations for actors Paul Winfield, Cicely Tyson and Ossie Davis.\nThough heavily promoted, the series met with controversy and was a huge ratings disappointment.  The first installment was the lowest rated of all 64 prime time programs for the week of its debut.\nCast\n*Paul Winfield as Martin Luther King Jr.\n*Cicely Tyson as Coretta Scott King\n*Tony Bennett as himself\n*Roscoe Lee Browne as Phillip Harrison\n*Lonny Chapman as Chief Frank Holloman\n*Ossie Davis as Martin Luther King Sr.\n*Cliff DeYoung as Robert F.
