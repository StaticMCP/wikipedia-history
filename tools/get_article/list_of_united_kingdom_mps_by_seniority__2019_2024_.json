The Members of Parliament (MPs), who were elected in the 2019 general election and during the 58th Parliament, are ranked by the beginning of their terms in office in the House of Commons.\nCriteria\nThe seniority criteria used in this article are derived from how the Father of the House is selected. They are not laid down in Standing Orders but arise from the customary practice of the House of Commons. The modern custom is that the Father of the House is the MP who has the longest continuous service. If two or more members were first elected in the same General Election (or at by-elections held on the same day), then priority is given to the one who was sworn in first. The order of swearing in is recorded in the House of Commons Journal, the official record of proceedings.\nWhen a member has had broken service, that does not affect his or her seniority (for the purpose of qualifying as the Father of the House) which is based on the latest period of continuous service.\nThe Sinn Féin members, who abstain from taking their seats at Westminster, have never been sworn in. They are ranked (in this list) after all other members who have taken their seats. Between themselves, they are ranked by the first date of the election, for the current period of continuous service. If they are equal on that criterion, then they are ranked in alphabetical order by surname.\nSummary of members elected by party\nThe following was the composition of the Commons at dissolution at 00:01, Thursday 30 May 2024, when all 650 seats became vacant pending the 2024 United Kingdom general election.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" class=unsortable style=\"width:40%; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" | Affiliation\n! colspan=\"3\"                              style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | Members\n|-\n! data-sort-type=number style=\"width:20%;\" | Elected in 2019\n! style=\"width:20%;\" | At dissolution in 2024}}\n! style=\"width:20%;\" | Difference\n|-\n|\n| 365\n| 344\n|  21\n|-\n| |group=}}\n| 202\n| 205\n|  3\n|-\n|\n| 48\n| 43\n|  5\n|-\n|\n| 11\n| 15\n|  4\n|-\n|\n| 8\n| 7\n|  1\n|-\n|\n| 7\n| 7\n|\n|-\n|\n| 4\n| 3\n|  1\n|-\n|\n| 2\n| 2\n|\n|-\n|\n| }}\n| 2}}\n|  2\n|-\n|  (E&W)\n| 1\n| 1\n|\n|-\n|  (NI)\n| 1\n| 1\n|\n|-\n|\n| }}\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n|\n| 0\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n|\n| 1\n| 1\n|\n|-\n|\n| 0\n| 17\n| 17\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Vacant\n| 0\n| 0\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Total\n! 650\n! 650\n!\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Effective total voting the speaker and deputy speakers (at this Parliament's dissolution, three Conservative and one Labour) by convention exercise only a casting vote.}}\n! 639\n! 638\n!  1\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Majority\n! 87\n! 44\n!  43\n|}\nFor full details of changes during the 2019–2024 Parliament, see By-elections and Defections, suspensions and resignations.\nNotes\nList\nThis article assigns a numerical rank to each of the members elected in the 2019 general election and subsequent by-elections, except for those who were elected but never sworn in, who are displayed at the bottom without a number.\nMembers named in italics and shaded in pink were no longer sitting when Parliament was dissolved on 30 May 2024.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 85%; line-height: 14px;\"\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n!
