She is suspected of  burning her predecessor, Melanie Dorkus, after filling her spray tan tank with hydrochloric acid in retribution for her abuse. Her cruel attitude and entitled personality, coupled with decades of shady activities within the sorority, lead the Dean, Cathy Munsch, to revoke the charter. However, Gigi intervenes, and Chanel is horrified when she is forced to accept anyone who wishes to join Kappa, causing all the other sisters and potential pledges, aside from her minions known as the Chanels, to leave.\nShe is the on-and-off girlfriend of Chad Radwell, the head of the Dickie Dollar Scholars fraternity. She harbors hatred toward Chanel #5 and often insults her. She also becomes suspicious of Hester, who had undergone a major makeover to become Chanel #6. She was sent to prison after Chanel #5, under the control of Hester, turned her in for the incident involving Ms. Bean, who was unintentionally murdered by Chanel in a prank gone wrong.\nShe harbors anger towards Grace and Zayday after the latter runs for the presidency of Kappa Kappa Tau. The two are forced to become co-presidents after the votes tie. Chanel then reveals that she deliberately wanted Zayday to become president to save herself from becoming a target of the Red Devil. She and the Chanels plan to expose Grace and Zayday, as she believes they are working with the Red Devil. Meanwhile, the other Chanels plan to murder Chanel out of fear that she is the killer, which she reluctantly forgives them for.\nDuring her quest to prove that Grace is one of the killers, she uncovers information about the true identity of Grace's mother and cruelly reveals it to her. However, she later apologizes and admits that she has an abusive mother herself.\nIn \"Black Friday\", Chanel and her Chanels have an encounter with the Red Devil while shopping during the Black Friday sale. When Chanel is cornered by the Red Devil, Chanel is maimed with an arrow before Denise Hemphill arrives, revealing that she is now the head of the police. After recovering, Chanel assumes that Dean Munsch is the Red Devil and plans with the Chanels and Zayday (and initially Grace, before being persuaded otherwise by Pete) to do away with her. However, all of her attempts are unfounded, including her last effort to drown her, which is foiled. When she writes a long and cruel missive to the other Chanels because of their failure to help her in her last attempt to kill the Dean, the media takes hold of the said letter which ruins her reputation. She contemplates suicide but was convinced by Zayday to keep fighting, thus inspiring her to bounce back. Part of this is faking an apology to Melanie and attempting to kill her, as Chanel thought that Melanie was the Red Devil, before Grace reveals the Red Devil is Hester.\nIn \"The Final Girl(s),\" Chanel and the other Chanels are arrested upon Hester claiming they were behind the Red Devil killings and are sent away to Palmer Asylum. While incarcerated, Chanel rises to become asylum president. With a release from the constant pressures of society, she and the other two Chanels find happiness in their new home and even expressed not wanting to leave at all.\nSeason Two\nIn Season Two, Chanel, #3, and #5 leave the asylum after Hester confesses to her crimes due to misunderstanding how double jeopardy works. Chanel graduates from community college, becoming a phlebotomist to rehabilitate her image, as the Chanels were previously hated by the public. Disowned by her wealthy parents, she lives in a rundown apartment with #3 and #5. Cathy Munsch offers Chanel a job at the C.U.R.E Institute Hospital, where she becomes a medical student and dates Dr. Brock Holt. Chanel takes over Dr. Scarlett's show, \"Lovin The D,\" rebranding it to \"Lovin The C,\" with #3 as her executive producer. In the final scene, Chanel discovers an old Kappa Kappa Tau ring and encounters the Red Devil in her car, prompting a scream.\nReception\nRoberts' performance has been met with positive reviews from critics. IGN stated, \"Two Murphy alums, Emma Roberts and Lea Michele, continued to prove that they're great at delivering his dialogue. Roberts in particular was a standout for me, and I relished every bitchy, whiny Chanel line she would give us.\" The Hollywood Reporter said, of Roberts' performance, \"The Scream Queens creators revel in writing mean girls, and Roberts gives gung-ho commitment to spewing the worst of Chanel's eviscerating insults — Chanel's a solipsist, so we're not supposed to quibble at how floridly racist and misogynistic she sounds — while pausing to give just enough beats of underlying humanity.\" Her performance has also been praised by her fellow cast members, with Jamie Lee Curtis stating \"with her delivery. It's a great kind of performance, to then breed the rest of all of us into sync.\"\nDenise Hemphill\n.]]\nDenise Hemphill (Niecy Nash) is Kappa Kappa Tau's new security guard, hired by Gigi. She is very dedicated to her job, though is somewhat incompetent. Her good friend Shondell is murdered by the Red Devil and Denise vows to find out their identity, believing that it is Zayday. Revealed in \"Black Friday\", when most (or all) of the police force was fired, she became the new police chief. She and two other officers corner the Red Devil who injured Chanel, she told Chanel about her promotion unintentionally allowing the Red Devil to kill one of the officers and escape.\nIn season two, Denise played a part in exposing Hester's confession when she played the tape at Chanels' retrial. When the Green Meanie killer starts killing the patients at the hospital Dean Munsch hires Denise to catch the killer, she also lets them visit Hester to try to find out who the killer is which she knows so they move Hester into the hospital. After Chad's death she lets Hester free to go to the Halloween party only so after she will reveal who the killer is but Hester escapes and after finding Chanel #5 stabbed, the Green Meanie throws punch on her and then electrocutes her with a defibrillator, incapacitating her, later her body would be sent into a cryogenic chamber after Dean Munsch reveals Denise still has a slight heartbeat and hopes to bring her back to life. In the finale, Nurse Hoffel turns off her machine to use the power to plant the bombs in the hospital and Denise wakes up just in time to defuse the bomb to save everyone and helps chases Nurse Hoffel into the swamp where they all agree to leave her to die in quicksand.\nGrace Gardner\n.]]\nGrace Gardner (Skyler Samuels) is the Kappa Kappa Tau vice president, formerly pledge, who is also legacy as her late mother Bethany Stevens was the KKT President back in 1995 and refused to help Sophia Doyle, who gave birth in a bathtub during a KKT party. She is horrified by Chanel's behaviour and the current reputation of the sorority and plans to restore Kappa to the way it used to be. She does so by working with Pete, a coffee shop barista who is a secretive investigative journalist. As well as restoring the reputation of KKT, they also are curious about revealing the Red Devil serial killer. She becomes best friends with Zayday Williams, who is also a pledge of Kappa. During Halloween, she supports Zayday's presidency and her charity haunted house she puts together, but when Zayday is kidnapped by the Red Devil, she and Pete go on a search party to find her, and after discovering the Red Devil's evil lair she notices Zayday has disappeared. She then finds Zayday back in Kappa Kappa Tau and is overjoyed when she becomes co-president of Kappa House. She displays a secret hatred toward her father's relationship with Gigi Caldwell. During her investigation, she is horrified to discover that, besides being responsible for the bathtub incident, her mother was a violent drug dealer and alcoholic, and that her father had lied to her about who her mother was. During a Thanksgiving dinner held inside the house, her father accuses her of being the killer. She is shocked, yet he reveals she was snooping around the house when Melanie Dorkus was viciously disfigured and was found by her father meeting Pete dressed in a Red Devil costume. After discovering that Wes is the father of the bathtub babies and she is the half-sister of Boone and the Red Devil, she forgives him and the two decide to catch or kill her siblings to protect each other. In the first-season finale, Grace confronts Pete as he reveals he is one of the Red Devils and killed Boone and Roger and Dodger before he exclaims that the final Red Devil is a KKT pledge causing Grace and Zayday to investigate. In the fast forward to 2016, Grace and Zayday, with Hester, now run Kappa House and have regained the honour of KKT by allowing any girl to join and host fun competitions and games instead of hazing the pledges.\nSkyler Samuels did not reprise the role in the second season since she returned to Stanford University to finish her degree, which was halted when she was shooting the first season. Her character's absence was not addressed at first, but near the end of the season(\"Rapunzel, Rapunzel\") it was revealed by Wes that after the Wallace University murders, Grace tried to have a normal life again and put on an act around her father that everything was okay. But because of the horrible trauma of the Red Devil killings and the Kappa hazing she experienced, she was said to have been driven to insanity and she ended up in a mental institution in Stanford.\nHester Ulrich\n.]]\nHester Ulrich, also known as Chanel #6 (Lea Michele), is the main antagonist of the first season.

She stole an asylum patient's neck brace for her disguise. She got into Wallace University by Cathy Munsch, who accepted her fake background high school information. She refers to herself as the brains of the operation and Boone as the muscle and both poured hydrochloric acid in Melanie Dorkus's tanning spray hoping it would drive Chanel over the edge to be a scapegoat by vilifying her and she turned on the deep fryer machine that burnt Ms Bean's face off.

The Devils are both the children of the deceased Sophia Doyle: her son Boone Clemens and her daughter Hester Ulrich (as well as Pete Martinez (who would assist)) who were both raised by Gigi Caldwell/Jess Meyer in a mental asylum after the shocking suicide of their former guardian Amy. Throughout their time at the institution, the two were taught about murder and orchestrated a 20 year long killing plan against Kappa House. To not be suspected, the two went under disguises: Hester as a girl with severe scoliosis and had to wear a neck brace whilst Boone pretended to be gay and never enrolled at the school whilst his sister managed to get herself in due to her \"neck deformity\" and managed to find the costume who they stole of a mascot who was stabbed to death by Gigi. It is revealed that Hester mostly orchestrated the murders and Boone executed the killings.\nOn March 25, 2014, Hester and Boone (under the Red Devil costume) broke into Kappa and put hydrochloric acid in Melanie Dorkus' tanning spray which resulted in her being disfigured and the incident being blamed on Chanel Oberlin who rose to power as president and would later be framed by Hester alongside her minions for the Red Devil murders once the plan was complete and throughout the events, carefully put together evidence to frame them successfully. The killer first makes an appearance when The Red Devil (Boone) appears and kills Chanel #2 before going off to kill Tiffany, Shondell, Coney, Mandy, Dodger, Caulfield, Sam, Jennifer, Earl Grey and a random truck driver, kidnapping Zayday and recruiting Pete (who joined to find out about Hester's identity and killed Roger and a mall cop) to help him kill Gigi who constantly pressured Hester to get rid of her brother due to the sloppy kidnapping incident. However, Boone was fatally stabbed by Pete (who wanted to finish the murder spree) and died.\nAfter her brother's murder, Hester started to don the costume and decapitated Gigi, stabbed Pete and forced a pizza delivery man to blow up Kappa which resulted in his death. It is also revealed that Hester turned on the fryer that resulted in Ms Bean's death. Her identity was revealed to Zayday and Grace who confronted her however she was found with a stiletto in her eye and blamed #5 before later defending herself by hiring a married couple to say that they are her real parents, even her real parents (Sophia Doyle and Wes Gardner) weren't on her record. The Chanels were successfully arrested for the murders and sent to the same asylum that Hester and Boone grew up. Hester, now as the only survivor of the Red Devil team, ends her plan for revenge and the Red Devil conspiracy in January 2016. At the asylum, Chanel is awoken by a knife wielding Red Devil who was revealed to be her ex-boyfriend Chad Radwell who dresses as the Devil to scare Chanel inside the hospital. After the Green Meanie killers are killed and everyone's lives return to normal and Chanel is leaving her TV show studio a Red Devil is seen waiting in the backseat of her car.\nGreen Meanie\nThe Green Meanie (stunt performed by Riley Schmidt) is the main antagonist of Season 2. The costume consists of green clothing and a monstrous horned mask. The Green Meanie is historically described by some kids in an old legend to be a swamp monster that resided in the toxic swamp near the C.U.R.E. Institute Hospital.\nThe Green Meanie killer wears the costume worn by Dr. Mike on the night of October 31, 1985 where he and Nurse Thomas dumped a patient's body in the toxic swamp so they could not miss out on the Halloween party that was occurring upstairs. However, the patient's wife, Jane, orchestrated a Halloween massacre which occurred a year later, in 1986. She sent her brother (who later died in a car accident years later) to the hospital to kill everyone, including Dr. Mike and Nurse Thomas.\n30 years later, the Green Meanie sneaks into the C.U.R.E. Institute Hospital and mostly kills people during the graveyard shift. The killer murders Catherine Hobart by decapitating her and then kills Tyler by burning his eyes with a laser (which was intended to be used to get rid of his warts) and slitting his throat during the surgery. He also attacks Cathy Munsch. However, she manages to defeat the killer and before she can take off the mask, the Green Meanie is scared away by the presence of Chanel #3 and Cassidy Cascade. The Green Meanie also kills Chad's friend Randal by slashing his chest and killing him (off-screen) and later the new cured patient Sheila by decapitating her with a machete and also injuries Chamberlain but does not hurt Zayday at all. Then not long after kills Chad Radwell by slashing his throat and hiding his body at the church which later falls down in front of Chanel at their wedding. Afterwards the Green Meanie later attacks Denise, however she is able to beat the killer and tries to shoot him but the killer escapes and later the Green Meanie stabs Chanel #5 in the back and when Denise comes to help the killer throws punch on her and electrocutes her with a defibrillator which kills her.\nThe Green Meanie is revealed to be Cassidy Cascade, who is the baby of Bill and Jane Hollis. Nurse Ingrid Hoffel, who is actually the sister of Agatha Bean, discovers this and confronts Cassidy about his role as the Green Meanie and offers to become the brains of the operation, while he is the muscle. He accepts and they kill Chanel #9 together. In the ending, he gives her a Green Meanie costume of her own and they stroll down the hall together in costume. However, he reveals that there is another Green Meanie, who is unrelated to Cassidy and Ingrid's killings. The third killer is revealed to be Wes Gardner who is plotting revenge on the Chanels after Grace was sent to a mental institution due to the trauma of the Red Devil killings and the Kappa hazing she experienced while at Wallace University. He began killing after Cassidy did, believing that his murders would just be blamed on the others.\nThe three killers attack the Chanels at the hospital at night and fail to kill them but finally meet one another. Hester then arranges a Green Meanie summit, where they admit who killed who and arrange who will kill who next. Cassidy admits to killing Catherine Hobart, Tyler, Randal, The Halloween patients, Chanel Pour Homme, Chanel #11, and Chanel #9. Ingrid admits to killing Chanel #9, Chanel #10, and Slade Hornborn. Wes admits to killing Sheila Baumgartner, Chad Radwell, attacking Denise and Chanel #5, poisoning the Halloween party, and killing Chamberlain. Hoffel is granted the opportunity to kill Chanel and Cassidy gets Chanel #3, while Wes is giving everyone else on the list. However, Hoffel and Cassidy decide to betray Wes and he ends up frying in the Hydrotherapy tub filled with oil.\nAfter he and Ingrid attempt to kill Chanel and Chanel #3, Cassidy decides to no longer kill and gives the Green Meanie identity fully to Ingrid. After a talk with Chanel #8, Ingrid devises a plan to blow up the hospital using a fertilizer bomb. Jane offers her assistance to Ingrid after disowning Cassidy, but Ingrid refuses. Nurse Hoffel gets the staff members down to the basement where her bomb is and locks them up, holding them at gunpoint. She reveals her true identity as Ms Bean's sister and the Green Meanie but is interrupted by Jane and Zayday. Jane attempts to convince her to reform like she did but Ingrid instead shoots Jane and leaves them there to die until Denise (who was revealed to have survived the electrocution) shows up and defuses the bomb. They all band together and chase Ingrid outside, where she throws a machete (which was intended for Chanel #3) into Cassidy, killing him. She runs off into the swamp but ends up falling into quicksand before she can escape. They all vote to leave her there, but Cathy decides to come back for her. She tries to pull her out, but fails and Ingrid drowns. It is at this point that the Green Meanies have all been killed and the team is now disbanded.\nReferences"
