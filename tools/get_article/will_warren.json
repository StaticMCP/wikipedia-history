He made his professional debut in 2022 with the Hudson Valley Renegades of the High-A South Atlantic League.

He started the 2024 season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and struggled to a 7.62 ERA through late May. The Yankees promoted Warren to the major leagues and he made his debut on July 30. In 2024, Warren had a 10.32 ERA in  innings for the Yankees and a 5.91 ERA in  innings for the RailRiders.\nDue to injuries to Gerrit Cole and Luis Gil, Warren made the Yankees' Opening Day roster in 2025 as a member of the starting rotation.
