The plant started in 1891 with hogs, and was \"massive\". The company was the 5th biggest at the end of World War II, in 1945. In 1966 it was the ninth largest, and it was also the 249th biggest industrial company of any kind in the United States. It closed in 1985.\nPreservation of the larger complex as a historic district was sought, but was not obtained, as the specialized industrial buildings rapidly deteriorated.\nThe administration building, completed in 1925, is unlike all other buildings in the plant, in that it was designed by a local architect, who was John S. Hartley (1891/92–1985). It was built by the John G. Miller Construction Company, which had submitted the low bid, $78,496, for the project. An extension was later added by contractor Tom McDonald.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.\nSee also\n*Rath Packing Company\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
