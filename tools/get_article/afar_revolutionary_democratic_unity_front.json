It had been a member of the United Ethiopian Democratic Forces (UEDF) coalition opposition party.\nIts name is often simplified to just Uguugumo (also spelled Uguguma or Ugogomo), meaning \"Revolution\", a term sometimes reserved for its militant wing and often confused as being a separate organization that is simply closely tied to ARDUF.\nHistory\nThe party was founded in March 1993 as a coalition of three Afar organizations: the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Union (ARDUU), founded in 1991 and led by Mohamooda Gaas (or Gaaz); the Afar Ummatah Demokrasiyyoh Focca (AUDF); and the Afar Revolutionary Forces (ARF). Mohamooda Gaas was elected as its Secretary General in 1995, but refused the post, leaving it to his deputy Muhyadin Mafatah, who was later extradited from Djibouti to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in August 1996, where he was jailed with two other Afar leaders, Habib Mahammad Yayyo and Jamal Abdulkadir Redo.\nARDUF claimed responsibility for a January 16, 2012 attack on a group of tourists at Erta Ale in which five were killed, some taken as hostages and others wounded. In March 2012, ARDUF released two tourists kidnapped in the attack.\nIn December 3, 2017, Dr. Walter Reopert, a German tourist was shot dead and his guide was injured in the assault, near the Erta Ale Volcano in Zone 2 district, Afar. Some sources suspected that the killing was carried out by the ARDUF.\nAs of 5 November 2021, the ARDUF announced that it had joined the United Front of Ethiopian Federalist and Confederalist Forces. However, the veteran founder of the Afar Revolutionary Democratic\nUnity Front, insisted that his group was never a part of the alliance at all. On 31 January 2022, the ARDUF announced that it was distancing itself from the United Front of Ethiopian Federalist and Confederalist Forces after accusing Tigrayan forces of killing civilians in the Afar Region.\nAfter joining UEDF\nIn July 2003, ARDUF became a member of the newly formed UEDF coalition, in opposition to the ruling EPRDF party. Soon after, on 20 September 2003, it issued a warning against foreigners entering the northern area of Afar Region for the purpose of demarcating the eastern part of the Ethiopian-Eritrean border, as it would be against the party's policy of Afar unity, who live on both sides of the eastern border:\nOur twin enemies, Shabia (Isayas Afewerki's) and Weyane (Meles Zenawi's), have been, under the auspices of the United Nations, carrying out illegal acts of brigandage against our people. Let the whole world know that ARDUF is reiterating its firm stand as it did in 1990, 1991, 1993 and 2000 that it is not only opposed to the illegal act of dividing our Afar people and demarcating our soil under the guise of \"border demarcation\" between Ethiopia and Eritrea, but also ready to render any demarcation exercise ineffective.\nViews\nThe political party aims to unite all Afar people under one flag. Although in the past the mechanism was not clear, whether this entailed the reunion of Eritrea and Ethiopia (as well as Afar lands in Djibouti) or a separate Afar state, the party claimed in 1998 to seek to unite Afars under an autonomous region of Ethiopia, similar to the present-day Afar Region in Ethiopia in existence since 1996 (but with the addition of lands in Eritrea and Djibouti). Consequently, ARDUF does not recognize Eritrea as a sovereign state.\nThe group reportedly supports the Fano insurgency in the Amhara Region.\nReferences"
