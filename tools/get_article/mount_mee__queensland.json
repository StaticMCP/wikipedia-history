The English name Mount Mee is possibly derived from another local word mia-mia, meaning a view or lookout, but this name was not formalised until the establishment of the school in 1899.\nSettlers began arriving in the area around Mount Mee in 1873, many being timber-getters attracted by the red cedar timber that was readily available in the area.  Initially, timber cut down in the area was exported to the nearby towns of Caboolture, D'Aguilar and Woodford, but a sawmill was eventually built in the fledgling town. A number of larger mills were operated on various parts of the mountain until the last closed in 1982.\nDahmongah Provisional School opened on 20 February 1884.
