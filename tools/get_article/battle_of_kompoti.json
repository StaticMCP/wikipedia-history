It was led by Alexandros Mavrokordatos. The Ottomans, informed of the movements of the Greeks, began to gather forces in Preveza and Arta. These forces were led by Kütahı and Ismail Pasha Pliasas. Pliasas, at the head of 500 cavalry, set out from Arta on June 10 with the aim of reconnoitering the Greek positions and at the same time luring the Greek army towards the plain, where it would be attacked by the Ottoman infantry. However, Markos Botsaris realized his intentions and, on his recommendation, the Greeks fortified themselves in natural ditches in the area.\nThus, when Pliasas cavalry began the attack, they were faced with unexpected resistance, led by the Philhellene German general Norman. The Ottomans were forced to flee towards Arta, pursued by the Greeks, leaving many dead behind them, among whom was Pliasas' kehaya (sub-commander), Metzalis, who was killed by the men of Gennaios Kolokotronis.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
