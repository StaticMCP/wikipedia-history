He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military decoration for valor, for his actions on March&nbsp;23, 1945, near Speyer, Germany.\nCarter and six other black Americans who served in World War II were awarded the Medal of Honor on January 12, 1997. The seven recipients are the first and only black American soldiers to be awarded the Medal of Honor for World War II.\nEarly years\nCarter was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1916. He was the son of missionary parents. His father Edward Allen Carter, Sr. was African-American. His mother, Mary Albert, was born to an English father and a Bengali mother in Kolkata, India. Carter grew up in India and then moved to Shanghai, China. He was fluent in 4 languages: English, Hindi, German and Mandarin.\nMilitary career\nChina and Spain\nWhile in Shanghai in 1932, Carter ran away from home and joined the National Revolutionary Army, fighting against the invading Japanese during the Shanghai Incident. After reaching the rank of Lieutenant, he had to leave when it was discovered that he lied about his age and he was actually 15 years old. He eventually made his way to Spain and joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, an American volunteer unit supporting the Spanish Republicans, in their fight against the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War.\nWorld War II\nCarter entered the U.S. Army on September 26, 1941. As a result of his previous combat experience, he stood out among the other recruits. In less than a year, he achieved the rank of staff sergeant. Carter was part of the 56th&nbsp;Armored Infantry Battalion of the 12th&nbsp;Armored Division.\nProvisional platoons of African-American troops were established in the wake of the Battle of the Bulge, which took place during the winter of 1944–1945. Black support and combat-support soldiers were allowed to volunteer for combat duty, and were given brief training in small-unit tactics. Formed into provisional units, they were used to augment depleted divisions. Soldiers volunteering for this combat duty had to surrender their current rank. When the provisional companies were set up, Carter volunteered and went from staff sergeant to private.\nstanding guard over a group of German POWs, April 1945]]\nOn March 23, 1945, Carter, then a 28-year-old infantry staff sergeant, was riding on a tank when it was hit by a Panzerschreck. Dismounted, Carter led three soldiers across an open field. In the process, two of the men were killed and the other seriously wounded. Carter continued on alone and was wounded five times, before being forced to take cover.\nEight German soldiers tried to capture him, but he killed six and captured the remaining two. He used the two as human shields from enemy fire as he recrossed the field. His prisoners provided valuable information on enemy troop dispositions for his unit. For this, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on October&nbsp;4, 1945, and later promoted to  sergeant first class.\nCarter was refused re-enlistment in the Army in 1949, due to allegations that he had communist contacts and allegiances, related to his affiliation with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in Spain, and a \"Welcome Home Joe\" dinner. He died of lung cancer—attributed to shrapnel remaining in his neck—on January 30, 1963. Carter was buried at Los Angeles National Cemetery. He was re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery in 1997.\nPersonal life\nHe married Mildred Hoover in 1940. Together they had two sons, Edward III, born March 27, 1941, and William, born 1944.\nAwards and decorations\nCarter's awards and decorations include:\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n, a Navy container ship of the Military Sealift Command, was named after Carter.\nMedal of Honor\n]]\nIn the early 1990s, it was determined that black soldiers had been denied consideration for the Medal of Honor in World War II on grounds of their race. In 1993, the Army contracted Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, to research and determine if there was racial disparity in the review process for recipients of the Medal of Honor. A study commissioned by the Army described systematic racial discrimination in the criteria for awarding decorations during World War&nbsp;II.\nIn 1996, after an exhaustive review of files, the study recommended that ten black Americans who served in World War&nbsp;II be awarded the Medal of Honor. In October of that year, Congress passed legislation that would allow the Medal of Honor to be passed to seven out of the ten former soldiers. The Medal of Honor was given to Carter's son, the descendants of the other five black Americans, and the only still-living recipient, Vernon Baker, on January&nbsp;12, 1997. Out of the seven, six had their Distinguished Service Crosses revoked and upgraded.\nCitation\n}}\nSee also\n* Vernon Baker\n* John R. Fox\n* Willy F. James Jr.\n* Ruben Rivers\n* Charles L.
