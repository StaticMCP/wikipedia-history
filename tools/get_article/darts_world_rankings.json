Each organization has its own players, and each has its own ranking system.\nAfter the British Darts Organisation folded in 2020, the two main rankings are now maintained by the World Darts Federation and the Professional Darts Corporation.\nThe ranking systems are used to arrange tournament seedings, which are so arranged, that the number one player in the world will not face the number two player until the final of a tournament, providing they both reach that final.\nPDC World Rankings\nThe Professional Darts Corporation's Ranking is based on the amount of prize money won in ranking tournaments on a two year cycle.\nSex\nWDF World rankings\nThe rankings are based on a cumulative points system, calculated on a rolling one-year basis. When a tournament is played, the previous year's results are removed from the rankings and the new tournament scores are used. This list is used to determine seeds for some of the WDF Opens. The World Darts Federation ranking system is designed to provide a measure of the global activities of darts players in every WDF recognized darts event. It used to be very similar to the BDO system but was revised in January 2007 to include categories by country and by events, and the distribution of ranking points reflect the levels of prize money on offer and the numbers of entries in a tournament. Players gain points in six levels of categorized events and prize money and at the end of the season the leading players receive monetary bonus rewards from the WDF.\nCurrent points distribution\nPoints are currently awarded as follows:\nCurrent rankings\nPrevious World Number Ones (Men's, WDF)\nThe following is a list of players who ended the year ranked number one in the WDF.\nAlan Evans\n* 1977  John Lowe\n* 1978  Leighton Rees\n* 1979  John Lowe (2)\n* 1980  Eric Bristow\n* 1981  Eric Bristow (2)\n* 1982  Jocky Wilson\n* 1983  Eric Bristow (3)\n* 1984  Eric Bristow (4)\n* 1985  Eric Bristow (5)\n* 1986  John Lowe (3)\n* 1987  Bob Anderson\n* 1988  John Lowe (4)\n* 1989  Bob Anderson (2)\n* 1990  Eric Bristow (6)\n* 1991  Phil Taylor\n* 1992  Rod Harrington\n* 1993  Leo Laurens\n* 1994  Steve Beaton\n* 1995  Richie Burnett\n* 1996  Martin Adams\n* 1997  Martin Adams (2)\n* 1998  Ronnie Baxter\n* 1999  Raymond van Barneveld\n* 2000  Raymond van Barneveld (2)\n* 2001  Mervyn King\n* 2002  John Walton\n* 2003  Martin Adams (3)\n* 2004  Raymond van Barneveld (3)\n* 2005  Raymond van Barneveld (4)\n* 2006  Martin Adams (4)\n* 2007  Gary Anderson\n* 2008  Scott Waites\n* 2009  Tony O'Shea\n* 2010  Martin Adams (5)\n* 2011  Scott Waites (2)\n* 2012  Stephen Bunting\n* 2013  James Wilson\n* 2014  Alan Norris\n* 2015  Darius Labanauskas\n* 2016  Darius Labanauskas (2)\n* 2017  Scott Mitchell\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n}}\nBDO rankings\nThe BDO Invitational Table relates only to registered playing members of the BDO, who comply with BDO and World Darts Federation (WDF) eligibility rules, including terms and conditions of the 1997 Tomlin Order.\nThe BDO awards points depending on a player's performances within each of its events and other BDO-recognised qualifying events. Forty-nine points are awarded to the champion of each of its three Major Events – The Lakeside World Professional Championship, The Bavaria World Darts Trophy and the Winmau World Masters and A+ events. Lower points are awarded for each round of the tournament reached. Other events are placed into Category A, B, C, and D based on the prize pool and number of payouts, with points for placings slowly decreasing. Only the best 12 placings are added for a player's ranking.\nFinal rankings\nFollowing a cease in tournaments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the BDO stopped publishing rankings on 18 March 2020. The BDO having entered liquidation in September of that year, what follows are the final published rankings by the organisation.\nNotes and references\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dartswdf.com/tables/ Tables : World Darts Federation]\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20160125183750/http://www.bdodarts.com/images/bdo-content/rules/gd/BDO_Invitation_Rules.pdf"
