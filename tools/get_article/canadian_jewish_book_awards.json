In its place, a group of jury members formed the Canadian Jewish Literary Awards for 2015.\nIn February 2016, after a one-year hiatus, the Koffler Centre of the Arts relaunched the awards as the Vine Awards for Canadian Jewish Literature.\nThe new awards have five categories, each with a $10,000 prize.\n# Fiction\n# Non-Fiction\n# History\n# Young Adult/Children's Literature\n# Poetry (awarded every three years)\nList of winners of the Canadian Jewish Book Awards (1989 - 2014)\n1989\n*Jewish Book Committee Award: Szloma Renglich, When Paupers Dance\n*Joseph Tannenbaum Award: Michael R.
