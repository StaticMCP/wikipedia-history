Biggs (1932-2003) was an educator, author of books on methodism and local history, and Methodist lay pastor.\nLife\nBarry John Biggs was born in Leicester in 1932, graduating from the University of Leicester with a degree in history following  National Service in the navy. He gained a teaching diploma from Durham University and a PhD from the University of Nottingham.\nBetween 1956 and 1961 he taught at Darwen Grammar School (now Darwen Vale High School), then at Wesley College, Ibadan, Nigeria between 1961 and 1963. In 1963 he moved to teach at Eaton Hall College of Education (a teacher training college), located in the village of Eaton, where he was principal lecturer until its closure in 1980. During this time he lived in Retford, Nottinghamshire. Afterwards he became Warden of the Lambeth Methodist International House, worked for four years for the Shaftesbury Society (now  Livability), and was the Senior Tutor on the East Midlands Ministry Training Course. After his retirement he became a local lay pastor at Colsterworth.\nBiggs was best known as a prolific and notable author of books and articles on the history of Methodism and North Nottinghamshire - particularly of the Retford area. He did significant amounts of primary research and his books and articles are now frequently cited by contemporary historians, while his histories are held in major collections as far afield as Australia and the US. His 1970 history of methodism in Retford (The story of the Methodists of Retford and District) was cited as a primary source by Historic England in their listing of the the Methodist Chapel in Grove Street, Retford.\nBiggs donated an important collection of photographs assembled during his research work to the local studies library in Retford.\nHe died in April 2003.\nWorks\nNottinghamshire\n'The Pre-Census Population of North Nottinghamshire Parishes' (1972)\n'Early Victorian Schools in North Nottinghamshire' (1977)\n'Living in East Markham', Retford and District Historical and Archaeological Society (1977) - co-authored with Hardy, B.\nRetford\n'Looking at old Retford' (1968)\n'Anthony Metcalfe - printer, bookseller and publisher' (1969)\n'The Story of the Methodists of Retford and District' (1970)\n'The disciplined society: early Victorian preachers in the Retford Wesleyan circuit' (1971)\n'A Cannon for Retford' (1972)\n'Francis Clater, Farrier' (1972)\n'J.
