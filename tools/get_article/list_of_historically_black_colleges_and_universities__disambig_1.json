      "text": "# List of historically black colleges and universities__disambig_1\n\nThis list of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) includes institutions of higher education in the United States that were established before 1964 with the intention of primarily serving the African American community.\nMost HBCUs are located in the Southern United States, where state laws generally required educational segregation until the 1950s and 1960s. Alabama has the highest number of HBCUs, followed by North Carolina, and then Georgia.\nThe list of closed colleges includes some that, because of state laws, were racially segregated. In other words, those colleges are not designated as historically black, they were demographically majority black for as long as they existed.\nCurrent institutions\n|float=center|width=700|caption=Locations of HBCUs in the continental United States (as of 2022). Blue markers indicate a city with one or more public institutions. Red markers indicate a city with one or more private institutions. Purple markers indicate a city with both public and private HBCUs. The University of the Virgin Islands (public) is outside the map area.}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable static-row-numbers\"\n|-\n!
