Pieces are manufactured with cast iron covered with double-glazed enamel.[https://books.google.com/books?id=daBOAQAAQBAJ&dq=Staub+cookware&pg=PA300 Remodelista: A Guide to the 100 Most Beautiful, Useful Household Objects][https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/19/dining/food-stuff-a-dutch-oven-from-france-turns-a-home-into-a-hearth.html Food Stuff; A Dutch Oven From France Turns a Home Into a Hearth – New York Times]\nCompany overview\nIn 2007, approximately 50% of the company's sales revenue came from abroad, and the company generated a total of €44 million in sales. In April 2008, the company had 430 employees, and at this time Francis Staub was president of the company.\nProduction\nIn 2008, Staub operated three production facilities in France, a joint venture in Japan, and a marketing branch in the United States.\nAcquisition\nIn June 2008, Staub was acquired by Zwilling J. A. Henckels, but it remains and has continued to operate as an independent brand.\nProfessional use\nThe cookware's aesthetic complements the decor of some restaurants; some restaurants cook and serve dishes directly to customers at their tables in Staub cookware. The enamel coating makes the cookware rustproof, and easy to clean. Staub's cocottes have nubs on the interior of the lids, which enables condensation to collect and drip down to baste foods uniformly as they are cooking.[https://books.google.com/books?id=CfyKb8rxASsC&pg=PA116 Easy Green Living: The Ultimate Guide to Simple, Eco-Friendly Choices for ... – Renée Loux]. p. 116.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qk90o3a5sE0C&pg=PT98 Les vins d'Alsace – Jacques-Louis Delpal]. pp.&nbsp;98–99.\nExternal links\n*\n*"
