      "text": "# Dwarf Mexican tree frog\n\n}}\nThe dwarf Mexican tree frog (Tlalocohyla smithii) is a species of frog in the family Hylidae endemic to Mexico.\nHabitat and distribution\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, intermittent rivers, and intermittent freshwater marshes.\nIt ranges from central Sinaloa southwards along the Pacific lowlands to southern Oaxaca, and inland in the Balsas-Tepalcatepec Basin Guerrero, Morelos, and Puebla states. It is found at elevations from sea level to 1,332 meters.\nConservation\nIt is threatened by habitat loss. The frog's distribution is caused by abiotic and biotic factors as well as the availability of resources and characteristics of reproductive sites.\nReferences\n*Luna-Gómez, M.
