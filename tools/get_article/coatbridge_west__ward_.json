Covering neighbourhoods in the south-west of Coatbridge (Barrowfield, Dundyvan, Kirkwood, Langloan, Old Monkland) and the separate village of Bargeddie, it elects three councillors. A boundary review in 2017 caused the loss of an area between Langloan Street, the A725 and the A89, with a small decrease in the electorate but no change in the number of seats. The ward had a population of 14,910 in 2019.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Tom Magginis(Labour)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Jim Smith(Labour)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Paul Welsh(SNP)\n|-\n!2012\n|-\n!2013 by-\n|rowspan=3|Kevin Docherty(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1|Mary Gourlay(Labour)\n|rowspan=1|Caroline Stephen(SNP)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Lesley Mitchell(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Gary Robinson(SNP)\n|-\n|}\nElection results\n2022 Election\n|count1=1,254\n|percentage=32.2\n|count2=&nbsp; \t |count3=&nbsp; \t |count4=&nbsp; \t |count5=&nbsp;\n}}\n2017 Election\n|numcounts= 5\n}}\n2012 Election\n|numcounts= 2\n}}\n*Labour Party councillor Tom Maginnis died on 29 November 2012.
