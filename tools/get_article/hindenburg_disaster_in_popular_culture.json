The blimp eventually does explode when crash-landing on an island in \"The Lost Lapras,\" but our heroes are not hurt.\nIn the Blue Mountain State episode \"The Corn Field Pt. 1\", the incident is referenced by Harmon when discussing a large joint of weed.

The episode posits that Joseph Späh was the original saboteur, but changed his mind about carrying out the disaster after all and leading Number Five to come up with an alternative solution.\nTelevision investigations\nThe Discovery Channel series MythBusters explored the incendiary paint hypothesis and the hydrogen hypothesis in an episode that aired January 10, 2007. While their experiments did not concern what actually started the fire, the show's hosts, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, demonstrated that when set alight with a blowtorch a 1:50 scale model of the Hindenburg burnt twice as fast in the presence of diffused hydrogen as without it. Combustion was observed in the burning skin, which would have accelerated the fire, but their experiments showed that hydrogen was the main fuel. The hydrogen-filled model produced a fire with flames that came out of the nose and resembled the newsreel footage of the Hindenburg disaster. That program concluded that the incendiary paint theory (IPT) myth was \"Busted\".\nThe MythBusters constructed three 1/50 scale models made out of welded steel wire and covered in cotton fabric. They were suspended from a hangar ceiling and stayed horizontal the entire time. The first model was painted with iron-oxide and then aluminum powder dopes, closely replicating the actual skin of the Hindenburg. Ignited with a blowtorch, it took about 2 minutes to burn, with thermite-like events (sparkling blazes) noted in a few places. The second model had the same skin, but a water trough inside diffused hydrogen gas at sub-explosive concentrations. This one burned about twice as fast, with more thermite burning. The third model, done more for spectacle than anything else, had the skin painted with a thermite-like iron-oxide and aluminum powder enriched dope. It was noted that it would probably be far too heavy to fly. With model 2's hydrogen enrichment, it took 30 seconds to completely consume the skin. The conclusion was that neither the hydrogen gas nor the flammable skin bore sole responsibility for the speed of the fire, but both contributed.\nThe National Geographic Channel program Seconds From Disaster had veteran air crash investigator Greg Feith study all of the available evidence, including eyewitness accounts, interviews with the last two living survivors, newsreel footage, weather reports, and the Hindenburg blueprints. Feith burned a sample of doped cloth and it took one minute to consume the whole piece, ruling out the skin as the primary accelerant. Feith's investigation came to a conclusion that the hydrogen puncture hypothesis was most probable. He also proved that by adding white cloth to a hydrogen flame that it would change the fire's color from invisible to orange.\nIn Search of..., a show mainly focused on paranormal investigations and conspiracy theories, made an episode based on this tragic accident, and immediately raised the question of whether it was really an accident or instead sabotage by then-Nazi Germany.\nInternet\nIn the shared alternate history of Ill Bethisad (1997 and after), an analogue of the Hindenburg disaster called the \"Dornburg Disaster\" appears. The aircraft was called the Dornburg Db-VI (known colloquially in German as \"Debe-Sechs\"), a flying boat style airplane which was designed in 1935 and built in late 1936 by its namesake, engineer Klaus von Dornburg (a fictional character) from Germany. In the fictional alternate universe setting of Ill Bethisad, airships overtook airplanes as the main form of air transport already in the 1930s and the Dornburg was intended to show off the advantages of the airplane compared to the airship (such as a faster speed). The test fight of the Dornburg was on 3 January 1936 and a flight with the media on board for publicity took place on 15 March. Full commercial flights of the Dornburg began on 2 April which operated by Lufthansa. There was only one Dornburg Db-VI ever made but before the disaster, there were plans to build more advanced versions starting in 1939. The disaster occurs on 6 May 1938 (exactly 1 year after the real life Hindenburg disaster) during a flight in South America from  Natal, in Bahia (a fictional country in the setting) to Rio de Janeiro in Brasil (a much smaller country then its real world counterpart Brazil). The Dornburg was about to land in Rio and was flying to Guanabara Bay when a gusts of wind forces it to make two sharp turns. The plane flies past Sugarloaf Mountain at 2:32pm but a few seconds later, one of the engines caught fire which quickly engulfed the plane which then fell into the bay, sinking there before any rescue attempt could be made. the disaster killed all 58 passengers and 18 crew members on board, a total of 76 deaths in total. The day after, the local newspaper Jornal do Brasil published photos of the crash with the headline \"Isto é desumano\" (meaning \"This is inhuman\" in Portuguese) on its front cover. The headline became world famous and had a major impact on how the world viewed airplanes. As a result of the disaster and the publicity surrounding it, public confidence of airplanes was permanently shattered and the airship quickly overtook the airplane as the most common form of air transport. In the present day, airships are used for civilian uses such as airlines, while airplanes are now relegated to military use with no passenger carrying planes built since the Dornburg crash. The airplanes that do exist are much less advanced compared to reality with many air forces still having propeller airplanes and the jet planes created in the 2000s there use designs that in real life date from the 1940s and 1950s. In addition, the development of jet engines happens later and is much slower than in real life with the first all-jet air force not set to exist until 2025. Also, the rock band \"Lead Aeroplane\" (a fictional analogue of Led Zeppelin) is named after the disaster and used the Jornal do Brasil front page showing the crash as the cover of their self-titled debut album in 1971, with their logo replacing the paper's nameplate. Also, in the Republic of the Two Crowns (a fictional, still existent version of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), an airship manufacturer called \"Wenedyk Hindenburg S.A.\" was founded in 1952 and in the early 21st century, created the \"Stratoliner\" airship which can travel faster than the average airship. The popularity of this particular airship with various airlines means that the once-ailing Wenedyk Hindenburg saw a significant increase in revenue.\nReferences"
