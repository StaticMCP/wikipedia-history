Its scope was filmed to create the various spiral elements used in the opening sequence. The raw footage was curated with aid from graphic designer Saul Bass, and the final near two minute long sequence became the first computer animation in a feature film.\n|-\n| Rendering of a planned highway\n|1961\n|In 1961, a 49-second vector animation of a car traveling up a planned highway at 110&nbsp;km/h (70&nbsp;mph) was created at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology on the BESK computer. The short animation was broadcast on November 9, 1961, on national television.\n|-\n|Simulation of a Two-Gyro Gravity-Gradient Attitude Control System\n|1963\n|Edward E. Zajac, a researcher at Bell Labs, used an IBM computer to create a short showing a communication satellite orbiting Earth.\n|-\n|Boeing Man\n|1964\n|William Fetter, a graphic designer working for Boeing, created the first wireframe animation.\n|-\n| Hypercube\n|1965\n|A groundbreaking animation made by A. Michael Noll using an IBM 7094. Shows two 4th-dimensional cubes on each side.\n|-\n| Hummingbird\n|rowspan=2 align=\"center\" |1967\n|A ten-minute computer-animated film by Charles Csuri and James Shaffer. This was awarded a prize at the 4th annual International Experimental Film Competition in Brussels, Belgium and in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York City. The subject was a line drawing of a hummingbird for which a sequence of movements appropriate to the bird were programmed. Over 30,000 images comprising some 25 motion sequences were generated by the computer.\n|-\n|Flexipede\n|The first entertainment cartoon. Made by Tony Pritchett on the Atlas Computer Laboratory near Oxford and first shown publicly at the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition in 1968.\n|-\n| Kitty\n|1968\n|A group of Soviet mathematicians and physicists headed by Nikolay Konstantinov created a mathematically computable model of the physics of a moving cat. The algorithms were programmed on the BESM-4 computer. The computer then printed hundreds of frames to be later converted to film. An accompanying scientific paper describes the foundation of the employed physics simulation techniques that nowadays are commonly applied to animation films and computer games.\n|-\n| Metadata\n|rowspan=4 align=\"center\" |1971\n|This is an experimental 2D animated short drawn on a data tablet by Peter Foldes, who used the world's first key-frame animation software, invented by Nestor Burtnyk and Marceli Wein.\n|-\n| The Andromeda Strain\n|First use of digital rendering within a feature film. A diagram of the underground laboratory was created using 2D planes and a complex wireframe cylindrical core.\n|-\n| Out of the Unknown\n|Produced by Charles McGhie, some early computer-generated imagery techniques were combined with stop-motion and real-time visual effects to create the opening title sequence for the show's fourth and final series.\n|-\n| Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\n|First use of Scanimate in a feature film. The analog computer animation system was used to create sing-along segments for the Oompa Loompa song after Augustus Gloop and Veruca Salt get their comeuppance for their respective vices. Added to the United States National Film Registry in 2014.\n|-\n| A Computer Animated Hand\n|1972\n|Produced by Ed Catmull, the short demonstrates a computer-animated hand, as well as human faces. Added to the United States National Film Registry in 2011.\n|-\n|Westworld\n|1973\n|First use of digital 2D computer animation in a significant entertainment feature film.
