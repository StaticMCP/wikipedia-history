The battery was recommissioned in 1941 with the installation of two guns of the same type, and these remained in place until the battery's closure in 1946.\nAfter its closure, the battery was used as a caravan site. During the late 20th-century, the battery and its surrounding area was transformed into a public space by Plymouth City Council. The two gun emplacements and magazine were infilled with earth, and all ancillary buildings were demolished. The features that remain visible include the concrete aprons of the emplacements and a concrete parapet. Adjacent to Jennycliff Cafe is the battery's former blockhouse.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal sources\n* [https://www.victorianforts.co.uk/pdf/datasheets/lordhoward.pdf Victorian Forts data sheet on Lord Howard's Battery]"
