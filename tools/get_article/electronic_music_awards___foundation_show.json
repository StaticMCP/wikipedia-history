Russell Thomas served as the program's director. The EMAF has no affiliation with The Electronic Music Awards and is not an extension of EMAF.\nHistory\nThe event, originally called the \"Electronic Music Awards & Foundation Show,\" was formed by Oakenfold, Duddridge, and Cody to give the Dance and EDM community an awards show of their own as well as giving back to the global community with the proceeds going to charities. It was scheduled to take place at the SLS Hotel in Los Angeles, California on April 14, 2016, and air on Fox as a one-hour special on April 23, 2016. This would have marked the first time a major awards show devoted to the Dance/EDM community aired on American television.\nOn April 12, 2016, the event was postponed. In a statement from the organizers \"As this is the first year of the awards, we have the luxury of flexibility, which we are taking advantage of to decide the optimal timetable to present the awards. With this opportunity, we felt that it would be better to represent the electronic music calendar in the fall rather than the spring.\"\nNomination List\nOn February 18, 2016, seven categories were announced, with Calvin Harris, Kygo, DJ Snake, and Galantis tied with two nominations apiece. With the 2017 announcement, there would be eleven categories.\n2016 (announced at the time)\nSingle of the Year\n*Calvin Harris & Disciples - \"How Deep Is Your Love\"\n*The Chainsmokers featuring ROZES - \"Roses\"\n*Galantis - \"Runaway (U & I)\"\n*Kygo featuring Parson James - \"Stole the Show\"\n*Major Lazer & DJ Snake featuring MØ - \"Lean On\"\nAlbum of the Year\n*Alina Baraz & Galimatias - Urban Flora\n*Calvin Harris - Motion\n*Disclosure - Caracal\n*Galantis - Pharmacy\n*Jamie xx - In Colour\nRadio Show of the Year\n*BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix\n*BPM with Geronimo – Sirius XM\n*Danny Howard – BBC Radio 1’s Dance Anthems\n*Diplo and Friends - BBC Radio 1Xtra\n*Jason Bentley – Morning Becomes Eclectic – KCRW\nFestival of the Year\n*Creamfields - Daresbury, England\n*Electric Daisy Carnival - Las Vegas, Nevada, USA\n*Sónar - Barcelona, Spain\n*The BPM Festival - Playa del Carmen, Mexico\n*Ultra Music Festival - Miami, Florida, USA\nDJ of the Year\n*Carl Cox\n*Diplo\n*Dixon\n*DJ Harvey\n*Skrillex\nBest New Artist\n*Bob Moses\n*DJ Snake\n*Jauz\n*KSHMR\n*Kygo\nBest Club of the Year\n*Amnesia\n*Fabric\n*Omnia\n*Sound LA\n*Zouk\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://emafawards.com/ Official Website]"
