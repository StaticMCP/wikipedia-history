In September 2011, King Charles I School was inspected by Ofsted inspectors during a 2-day section 5 inspection. The inspection deemed the school to be \"good, grade 2\" (1 being \"outstanding\", 2 \"good\", 3 \"satisfactory\" and 4 \"inadequate\"), stating: \"King Charles 1 [sic] is a good school that puts students at the heart of everything it does\". However, the inspectors lowered the previous grade of the Sixth Form, from \"good\" in the 2008 report, to \"satisfactory\", stating: \"[S]tandards have fluctuated since the school was last inspected but students make satisfactory progress\".\nHistory\nGrammar school\nThe school was founded around 1566 by Thomas Blount, Esq, Lord of the Manor of Kidderminster. It was in the chantry of the Parish Church of Saint Mary and All Saints from 1566 until 1848, when it moved to the site known as Woodfield, on Bewdley Road. It was granted its royal charter in 1636 by King Charles I and was the only school in England to bear his name. The original premises, Woodfield House built in 1785, and the Hall built about 1848, are now listed buildings.\nComprehensive\nWhen administered by Hereford and Worcester County Council in 1977, the Queen Elizabeth I Grammar School, Hartlebury (all boys) merged with the two Kidderminster grammar schools, King Charles I Grammar School for Boys, and the Kidderminster High School for Girls, the latter of which was founded in 1868, and moved in 1912 to Hill Grove House, which is now also a Grade II listed building.\nThis marked the end of the grammar school system in Kidderminster, as the change to comprehensive education was completed. The transition to this system took place gradually until the early 1980s, becoming a ten-form (five-form each in Years 12 and 13) entry, 13–18 comprehensive school from a six-form entry grammar school.\nMergers\nIt has been subject to several mergers, and, in line with district school reorganisation, following an amalgamation of middle schools and high schools, it reopened in 2007 to operate from two sites, with a total capacity of around 1350 students aged 11 to 18. Under its new structure, the school retains its specialist status as a Science College that was awarded in 2003, and has facilities that cater for students with special needs. Following a November 2011 Ofsted inspection, the school was awarded a grade 2 (\"good\") rating.\nBuildings\nThe school was enlarged with the Brooks Building, neighbouring the Sixth Form Rose Garden, which originally functioned as a science laboratory and theatre, and is now a conference centre. The school has two sites, with the lower school for Years 7 and 8 pupils operating from the premises of the former Comberton Middle School on Borrington Road. On both sites, the school caters for linguistically challenged and autistic students in a Communication Centre.\nAcademy\nThe school converted to academy status in August 2012.\nCurriculum\nThe school offers a wide range of extra-curricular provision, especially in sport. In July 1979, the school held the Guinness world record for the longest continuous cricket match.\nNotable alumni\nKing Charles I School (since 1977)\n* Steven Davies, English cricketer, formerly of Worcestershire, now playing for Surrey\n* Tom Watson, Labour MP from 2001 to 2019 for West Bromwich East\nKing Charles I Grammar School for Boys (until 1977)\n* Mo Anthoine, mountaineer\n* Alan Bowkett, businessman\n* Paul Frampton, physicist\n* Lt-Col Brian Turner Tom Lawrence, conferee of the Victoria Cross during the Boer War\n* Walter Nash, Prime Minister of New Zealand\n* Clifford T.
