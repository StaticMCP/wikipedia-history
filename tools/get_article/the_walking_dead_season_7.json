Developed for television by Frank Darabont, the series is based on the eponymous series of comic books by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. The executive producers are Kirkman, David Alpert, Scott M. Gimple, Greg Nicotero, Tom Luse, and Gale Anne Hurd, with Gimple as showrunner for the fourth consecutive season. The seventh season received mixed reviews from critics. It was nominated for multiple awards and won three, including Best Horror Television Series for the second consecutive year, at the 43rd Saturn Awards.\nThis season adapts material from issues #100–114 of the comic book series and focuses on the oppressive group of survivors known as the Saviors, led by the vindictive Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). He uses numbers, power and lethal brutality to coerce Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), his group of survivors, and the Alexandria Safe-Zone to make regular offerings of supplies and weapons for the Saviors. Eventually, Rick and his group seek allies to help them confront Negan, including members of the survivor communities of the Hilltop, the Kingdom, Oceanside, and the Scavengers, who have had their own dealings with Negan and the Saviors.\nCast\n\" onwards, include (from left to right): Sasha, Daryl, Tara, Michonne, Gabriel, Carol, Rick, Carl, Maggie, Jesus, Rosita, Morgan, and Aaron; absent: Eugene, Negan, Spencer, Dwight, and Gregory]]\nMain cast\nThe seventh season features twenty series regulars overall.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds a score of 66% with an average rating of 6.85 out of 10 based on 620 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Increased character depth and effective world-building helps The Walking Dead overcome a tiresome reliance on excessive, gratuitous violence.\"\nThe first episode of the season, \"The Day Will Come When You Won't Be\", received criticism for the amount of violence depicted in the episode, with one writer calling it the equivalent of \"torture porn\". Subsequently, the first half of the seventh season has seen some of the show's lowest critical ratings. The show's executive producer Gale Anne Hurd claimed that in light of the negative feedback, they tamed some of the more gruesome scenes that were in episodes being filmed for the second half of the season. Hurd said that \"this is not a show that's torture porn... Let's make sure we don't cross that line\". However, this claim was countered by executive producers Scott M. Gimple and Greg Nicotero. Gimple said that the violence used in the episode was \"pronounced for a reason\", specifically that \"there was a purpose of traumatizing these characters to a point where maybe they would have been docile for the rest of their lives\", but noted that he felt that this episode shouldn't represent \"the base level of violence that necessarily should be on the show\". On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 67% with an average rating of 7 out of 10, based on 54 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \"The flashback-laden 'The Day Will Come When You Won't Be' is slow to deliver the payoff from last season's finale—but ultimately delivers with sadistic acts of gut-wrenching violence that will push Walking Dead fans to their limit.\"\n| 67| 95| 73| 61| 74| 61| 78| 76| 88| 83| 86| 76| 85| 72| 67| 83}}\nAccolades\nThe series won two awards at the 43rd Saturn Awards: Best Actor on Television (Andrew Lincoln), and Best Guest Starring Role on Television (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Additional nominations were for Best Supporting Actor on Television (Norman Reedus), Best Supporting Actress on Television (Danai Gurira and Melissa McBride), and Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Television Series (Chandler Riggs).\nThe first half of the season was nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Television Series at the 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards. Additionally, for his portrayal of Negan, Jeffrey Dean Morgan earned himself a nomination and win for Best Guest Performer in a Drama Series at the 7th Critics' Choice Television Awards for the first half of the season, in addition to his guest appearance in the season six finale, \"Last Day on Earth\". Morgan was also nominated at the 26th MTV Movie & TV Awards for Best Actor in a TV Show and Best Villain, winning the latter.\nRatings\nThe Walking Deads seventh-season premiere (\"The Day Will Come When You Won't Be\") received 17.03 million viewers in its initial broadcast on AMC in the United States.
