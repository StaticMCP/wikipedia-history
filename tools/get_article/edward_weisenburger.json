He previously served as Bishop of Tucson from 2017 to 2025 and as Bishop of Salina from 2012 to 2017.\nBiography\nEarly life\nEdward Weisenburger was born in Alton, Illinois, on December 23, 1960, to Edward and Asella (Walters) Weisenburger. He grew up primarily in Lawton, Oklahoma, where he attended St. Barbara School and graduated from Eisenhower High School in 1979. He began his studies at Conception Seminary College in Conception, Missouri, graduating with honors in 1983.  and then attend the American College Seminary at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. He earned his Bachelor of Theology and Master of Religious Studies degrees in 1986. He received his Master of Arts in Religious Studies and Master of Moral and Religious Sciences degrees in Leuven in 1987.\nPriesthood\nOn December 19, 1987, Weisenburger was ordained to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Oklahoma City by Archbishop Charles Salatka.  After his ordination, the archdiocese assigned Weisenburger to St. Mary Parish in Ponca City, Oklahoma. He was sent in 1990 to Ottawa, Ontarion to study at St. Paul University in Ottawa, Ontario.  He earned a Licentiate of Canon Law degree in 1992. After returning to Oklahoma, Weisenburger was appointed vice chancellor and adjutant judicial vicar for the archdiocese.\nWeisenburger was appointed pastor of Holy Trinity Parish in Okarche, Oklahoma in 1995. That same year, he also began 17 years of service on the Council of Priests and the archdiocesan college of consultors. After the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, he volunteered as an on-site chaplain for rescue workers. In 1996, Archbishop Eusebius J. Beltran named Weisenburger as vicar general of the archdiocese.\nIn 2002, Weisenburger was named pastor and then rector of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish. He was also named as promoter of justice for the canonization of Reverend Stanley Rother, an Oklahoma priest murdered in 1981 by a death squad in Guatemala. In 2009, the Vatican elevated Weisenburger to the rank of prelate of honor with the title monsignor.\nBishop of Salina\nWeisenburger was appointed bishop of Salina by Pope Benedict XVI on February 6, 2012. He was consecrated at Sacred Heart Cathedral in Salina, Kansas by Archbishop Joseph Fred Naumann.\nBishop of Tucson\nOn October 3, 2017, Weisenburger was named the seventh bishop of Tucson by Pope Francis.  He was installed on November 29, 2017.\nArchbishop of Detroit\nOn February 11, 2025, Weisenburger was appointed as archbishop of Detroit, succeeding Allen Vigneron. His installation occurred on March 18, 2025.\nDismissal of theologians at Sacred Heart Major Seminary\nIn 2025, Weisenburger terminated three professors of theology and canon law, Dr. Ralph Martin, Dr. Eduardo Echeverria, and Dr. Edward N. Peters, from Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, without explanation.\nThe professors had previously critiqued certain statements and teachings of Pope Francis, particularly regarding theological clarity. For example, in January 2024, Martin wrote a column for the National Catholic Register arguing that Francis’s remarks expressing hope that hell is empty could inadvertently support the heresy of Universalism, which posits that all will be saved. A spokesman for the archdiocese declined to comment on the firings.\nPositions\nImplementation of Traditionis custodes\nIn July 2025, Weisenburger banned the celebration of the Tridentine Mass in parishes. This was based on Traditionis custodes, the 2021 apostolic letter issued by Pope Francis on the Tridentine Mass. Under the new rules, the masses could only take place in non-parochial settings, such as St. Joseph Shrine, and three other designated settings. Priests not assigned to these sites could request permission to celebrate the liturgy on weekdays. The diocese also prohibited lay people from attending Tridentine Masses. In addition, priests performing the masses would have to follow strict conditions, including annual renewal and a written affirmation of the validity of the Novus Ordo liturgy.\nThe July 2025 decree also prohibited the ad orientem posture by priests in the Novus Ordo liturgy, mandating the use of freestanding altars in all parish churches within 180 days. Additionally, the diocese also required that priests read scriptures in the liturgy using the vernacular language of the parish, employing only translations approved by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. In announcing these changes, Weisenburger emphasized the need for unity under papal and episcopal leadership while acknowledging the “rich expressions of the Catholic faith in southeast Michigan.\"\nSexual abuse\nDuring his tenure as vicar general of  Oklahoma City (1996–2012), Weisenburger helped evaluate allegations of sexual abuse by clergy. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) criticized the diocesan response to these allegations, citing a lack of transparency and action in addressing cases of accused priests.\nAs bishop of Tucson (2017–2025), Weisenburger addressed sexual misconduct within the diocese. In September 2018, he announced the firing of ten diocesan employees and rescinded clearances for twelve unpaid workers due to allegations of sexual misconduct. He noted these individuals likely passed initial screenings, but the diocese identified issues during clearance renewals or from separate incidents. Weisenburger stated that the diocese had “no known allegations of sexual misconduct with minors against any of our priests in active ministry today.” In response to a 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury report detailing widespread clergy abuse, Weisenburger denounced the actions of offending priests as “criminal and sinful.” He emphasized the diocese’s policy of reporting allegations to law enforcement, as established in a 2002 agreement with the Pima County Attorney’s Office.\nIn December 2020, the Diocese of Tucson, along with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, were named in a federal racketeering lawsuit by two individuals alleging sexual abuse by four priests in Arizona during the 1970s. One plaintiff, Diana Almader-Douglas, claimed abuse by Reverend Charles Knapp when she was five-years-old in Pirtleville, Arizona. Weisenburger stated that when the diocese learned of these allegations, it had immediately notified police, who declined to investigate them. In addition, an external investigation could not determine the credibility of the allegations. A third individual joined the lawsuit in 2021.\nIn 2018, Weisenburger linked the prevalence of sexual abuse to the cultural shifts of the 1960s so-called “sexual revolution,” a perspective criticized by some as deflecting responsibility from the Church’s institutional failures. The Diocese of Tucson signed a $14 million settlement in 2002 for clergy abuse cases from the 1960s to 1980s and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2004 to address 22 related lawsuits, creating a $22 million settlement pool. Weisenburger acknowledged these past issues, stating, “What happened in the past brought us to this point, and from here, we move forward and will always do it correctly.”\nImmigration\nWeisenburger has been outspoken in support of immigrants. At a 2018 conference of bishops he suggested bishops might issue canonical penalties, potentially including a denial of holy communion or excommunication, to Catholic federal agents who enforce Trump-era immigration laws.\nAs bishop of Tucson, Weisenburger oversaw immigrant programs, including the Casa Alitas shelter operated by Catholic Community Services of Southern Arizona. Casa Alitas, which provides temporary shelter, food, and medical care to illegal aliens who were caught and released from U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody, operates multiple facilities in Tucson, including a high-profile site at a repurposed hotel. In 2024, U.S. Congressman Juan Ciscomani, representing Arizona’s 6th District, called for a federal investigation into Catholic Community Services’ use of taxpayer funds for Casa Alitas. He alleged potential financial mismanagement and a contractor-hiring violation involving inflated charges by a laundry service. Pima County officials confirmed an ongoing investigation into compliance with federal and county grant rules.\nIn a 2025 article for America magazine, Weisenburger advocated for a compassionate approach to U.S. immigration reform, emphasizing the human dignity of migrants and critiquing the inefficiencies of the current system, such as visa backlogs and harsh deportation policies. Drawing on his experience as a bishop on the Arizona-Mexico border and the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas, he urged recognition of immigrants’ contributions and the moral imperative to treat them with reverence, aligning with Catholic social teaching.\nIn July 2025, Weisenburger opposed the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which allocated approximately $46.5 billion for new segments of the Mexico-United States border wall and $120 billion for other immigration enforcement infrastructure. He said this would increase suffering by driving potential undocumented immigrants into dangerous border regions, increasing reliance on smugglers.\nOn July 14, 2025, Weisenburger participated in a procession organized by \"Strangers No Longer,\" a grassroots organization of Catholics including clergy advocating particularly for amnesty rights for immigrants, from Most Holy Trinity Church to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Field Office in Detroit. The event, described as a “solemn procession,” aimed to deliver a letter to ICE Field Office Director Kevin Raycraft, requesting a meeting to discuss concerns about law enforcement practices, including the use of face masks by agents, arrests without federal warrants, and the detention of individuals without felony convictions. The letter was co-signed by Reverend David Buersmeyer and Judith Brooks, the group’s board president. ICE officials declined to accept the letter.\nWeisenburger offered a prayer before the march, emphasizing the Church’s call to uphold the dignity of illegal aliens, stating, “You call us to reverence your presence in all those we meet, but most especially the poor, the needy, the troubled, and the immigrant.” He further underscored the event’s alignment with Catholic social teaching, particularly the principles of human dignity and the common good, and described it as a “prophetic witness” to America’s tradition of charity and welcome.\nEnvironmentalism\nIn March 2024, Weisenburger publicly thanked Pope Francis for his critique of \"irresponsible\" American lifestyles contributing to the theory of anthropogenic climate change, as outlined in Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation Laudate Deum. This document, a follow-up to the encyclical Laudato Si', specifically highlighted the disproportionate per capita emissions in the United States compared to other nations, urging a shift away from unsustainable Western lifestyles.\nWeisenburger’s environmentalism was notable for its alignment with Pope Francis’s call for urgent action on the so-called climate crisis, a position that contrasts with the focus of many Catholic leaders on issues such as abortion, marriage, or religious liberty. His participation in a November 2024 White House meeting with Biden administration officials, including senior climate adviser John Podesta, underscored his commitment.\nAt a University of Arizona event in March 2024, Weisenburger praised Pope Francis for directly challenging American consumption patterns, stating, “I’m a very proud American, but I was so grateful the Holy Father had the nerve to go after us.”\nCOVID-19 vaccine mandates\nIn August 2021, Weisenburger issued a statement to his clergy, directing them not to be involved in supporting applications for religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccine or mask mandates. He said that “all current anti-Covid-19 vaccines may be received without moral compromise,” citing the CDF’s 2020 note about the moral distinction between formal and material cooperation. He acknowledged the ethical concerns about fetal cell lines but maintained that the Church’s teaching resolved these concerns, making exemptions based on Catholic faith untenable.\nSee also\n* Catholic Church hierarchy\n* Catholic Church in the United States\n* Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States\n* List of Catholic bishops of the United States\n* Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.aod.org/ Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit Official Site]\n*[https://www.diocesetucson.org/ Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson Official Site]\n*[http://www.salinadiocese.org/ Roman Catholic Diocese of Salina Official Site]"
