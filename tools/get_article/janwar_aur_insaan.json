The region is being terrorized by a tiger which was wounded by him and has since become even more fearless and a man-eater. Shekhar's attempts to entrap and kill it are all in vain. Then Shekhar meets with Meena and both fall in love with each. Their marriage cannot take place as Meena's father, Gokuldas, had killed Shekhar's dad. But when Mohan kills Gokuldas, the past is forgiven and the couple are allowed to get married. The marriage ceremony is marred with the appearance of the tiger, which runs away after being chased by a rifle-toting Shekhar. After about a year Meena gives birth to Raju but the tiger continues to be at large. When the tiger breaks into Shekhar's mansion, a frantic Shekhar decides to not return home until he kills it. He sets up a bait but the tiger refuses to fall for it. While Shekhar is waiting for the tiger to take the bait, it attacks and kills estate workers, compelling Shekhar to seek a human bait. When no one volunteers, Shekhar takes the matter into his own hands and decides to use Raju as a live bait for this man-eater!!\nCast\n*Shashi Kapoor ...
