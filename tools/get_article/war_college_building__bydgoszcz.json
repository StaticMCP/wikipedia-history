It is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List.\nLocation\nThe building stands on the eastern side of Gdanska Street, in the area delimitated by:\n* Dwernicki street;\n* Żołnierska street;\n* Czerkaska street;\n* Gdańska Street.\nThis whole area lies within the Forest district in Bydgoszcz.\nHistory\nThe building was built between 1913 and 1914 and designed by German architects Arnold Hartman and Robert Schlezinger.\nThe 1913 initial footprint of the project covered an area of approximately 22 hectares within the administrative boundaries of the city.\nThe estate was planned to be the seat of the German War College (), but the start of World War I changed it all, and the edifice housed during the conflict a German military hospital.\nIn 1920 the building was taken over by the Polish authorities of the city. After lengthy negotiations and efforts of General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, then Deputy Minister of Military Affairs, the city agreed to hand over the edifice to the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs.\nOn July 11, 1920, the building housed the High School of Infantry which had moved from Poznań due to the Polish–Soviet War.\nOn August 1, 1922, the school was converted into an Officer Academy for Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) and on August 9, 1928, it has been renamed the NCO Cadet School.\nIn the first half 1939, the building housed the Naval Cadet School.\nFrom July 1, 1943 to January 17, 1945 the building, seized by Nazi armed forces, has accommodated the Intelligence and Cavalry School (). After the liberation of Bydgoszcz in January 1945, Soviet troops were billeted here.\nFrom 1947 to 2007, the edifice housed the Pomeranian Military District Command, and since 2007 it is the seat of the Inspectorate of Armed Forces Support.\nIn an adjacent building is open a military museum.\nArchitecture\nThe massive building has a E-shaped foot print, following eclecticism style with a clear predominance of neo-Baroque elements.\nThe building has a prominent avant-corps on its center and wings: all is topped with high Mansard roofs with dormers.\nThe front portico, with Tuscan styled columns is prominent and topped by a balcony crowned with an elliptical pediment. The facade is divided by a series of decorative cornices and wide pilasters.\nAmong the noteworthy elements of architectural decoration and stucco are:\n* stone balusters and helmets;\n* flaming vases;\n* pelmets and Bydgoszcz's coats of arms.\nThe interiors still preserve the original layout: adorned staircases, arcade hall, tiled corridors and walls with panelling and pilasters, and stucco ceilings.\nNext to the War College is the former Directorate building (). It is an impressive villa with a portico, terraces, balconies and stylised pediments. The whole area is surrounded by a cast-iron fence, decorated with stone trophies.\nThe building and its architectural environment has been put on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List Nr.601325 Reg.A/30/1-6, on December 28, 2000.\nGallery\nFile:Kasern Bromberg map 1914.jpg|Detail of 1914 map with military area\nFile:War college 1916.jpg|War college in Bromberg, 1916\nFile:War college 1938.jpg|War College Bydgoszcz, 1938\nFile:Bydgoszcz, szkoła wojenna, ob. sztab, 1913-1914 9.JPG| View with the cast-iron fence\nFile:Gdańska 190 POW rzeźba.jpg|Stone figure\nFile:Bydgoszcz, willa komendanta, 1913-1914 sd.JPG| Willa Komendanta\nFile:War college.JPG|Commander's house\nSee also\n* Bydgoszcz\n* Gdanska Street in Bydgoszcz\n*  Downtown district in Bydgoszcz\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [http://www.iwspsz.wp.mil.pl/pl/index.html Poslish Armed Forces Logistics Inspectorate]\n*  [http://www.muzeumwl.pl/ Army Museum of Bydgoszcz]\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
