Diplomatic relations were then broken off. In 1924, after the Russian Civil War, Great Britain was the first foreign power to recognize the new Soviet government, sending an ambassador in 1924. However, he was provided with a palace at Boloto, on the Island, or Zamoskvorechye, near the Kremlin in Moscow. The British embassy remained there until 2000.\nAs the Russian Federation replaced the Soviet Union, the British Consulate-General in St. Petersburg was re-opened, and Barbara Hay was appointed as its first new Consul-General in 1992. The consulate would go on to operate for 26 years.\nIn 1997, the Consulate coordinated the British program of events in St. Petersburg dedicated to the three hundredth anniversary of Peter the Great's Embassy to Great Britain.\nThroughout its work, the Consulate supported such traditional cultural events as the \"Days of Scottish Culture in St. Petersburg\", held annually since 1971.\nIn 2018, in response to the UK's decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats following the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, Russia closed the Consulate-General, while also expelling 23 British diplomats and closing the office of the British Council in Russia.\nList of Consuls-General\n*Barbara Hay\n*Monika Sangeeta Ahuja\nOther locations in Russia\nThe British Consulate-General in Yekaterinburg is still operational, as well as the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Moscow.\nSee also\n*List of diplomatic missions in Russia\n*Embassy of the United Kingdom in Moscow\n*Russia–United Kingdom relations\nReferences"
