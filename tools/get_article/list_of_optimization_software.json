Many real-world problems can be modeled in this way. For example, the inputs could be design parameters for a motor, the output could be the power consumption. For another optimization, the inputs could be business choices and the output could be the profit obtained.\nAn optimization problem, (in this case a minimization problem), can be represented in the following way:\n:Given: a function f : A \\to R from some set A to the real numbers\n:Search for: an element x0 in A such that f(x0) ≤ f(x) for all x in A.\nIn continuous optimization, A is some subset of the Euclidean space Rn, often specified by a set of constraints, equalities or inequalities that the members of A have to satisfy. In combinatorial optimization, A is some subset of a discrete space, like binary strings, permutations, or sets of integers.\nThe use of optimization software requires that the function f is defined in a suitable programming language and connected at compilation or run time to the optimization software. The optimization software will deliver input values in A, the software module realizing f will deliver the computed value f(x) and, in some cases, additional information about the function like derivatives.\nIn this manner, a clear separation of concerns is obtained: different optimization software modules can be easily tested on the same function f, or a given optimization software can be used for different functions f.\nThe following tables provide a list of notable optimization software organized according to license and business model type.\nFree and open-source software\nApplications\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
