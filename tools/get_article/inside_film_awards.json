Its name derives from its origins at Inside Film magazine, and changed over the years under different sponsorship. The event was held in Sydney in November each year, apart from between 2006 and 2008, when for three years it was held on the Gold Coast in Queensland. The last awards event was held in 2011.\nHistory\nThe Inside Film Awards were created by the founders of Inside Film magazine, Stephen Jenner and David Barda, The awards were determined by a national audience poll, which differentiated it from the Australian AACTA Awards, which are judged by industry professionals.\nThe IF Awards were first held in 1999, and until 2006 were also known as the Lexus Inside Film Awards, in recognition of its principal sponsor Lexus. The event was held in Sydney in November each year, and was broadcast on SBS Television and Showtime Movie Channels. Guests over this period included Nicole Kidman, Laurence Fishburne, Baz Luhrmann, Toni Collette, Geoffrey Rush, Jacqueline McKenzie, and Bryan Brown.\nIn 2007, the Rising Talent and Indy Spirit Awards were open to public entries.\nEvent partners changed over the years. In 2006, the event moved from Sydney to the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre in Gold Coast, Queensland, after a contract was signed with the Queensland Government. At that time, Angie Fielder was the general manager of Inside Film Awards. In 2008, the promotional trailer for the event was directed by Bonnie Elliott. In that year, the event was hosted by Julia Zemiro at the Royal Pines Resort on the Gold Coast, with Yumi Stynes welcoming the stars. Kate Miller-Heidke performed an acoustic version of her hit song \"Can't Shake It\" at the event, which was broadcast live on SBS TV.\nIn 2009, Kodak acquired naming rights for the awards, maintaining the partnership until 2010. Returning to Sydney, the event was variously known as the Kodak Inside Film Awards Sydney, Kodak IF Awards Sydney, or just Kodak IF Awards. Other partners in 2010 included GHD, Jameson Irish Whiskey, M.A.C. Cosmetics, OK! Magazine, SBS Television, and Screen Australia, among others.\nIn 2011 Jameson Irish Whiskey acquired naming rights, with the event held at Luna Park. Eddie Perfect hosted the event, with presenters including Callan McAuliffe, Richard Roxburgh, David Wenham, Sophie Lowe, Dan Wyllie, and Xavier Samuel. Individual awards were named after various sponsors, such as Showtime IF Award for Best Feature Film; Destination NSW IF Award for Best Actor; Dinosaur Designs IF Award for Best Actress; Fox Studios Australia IF Award for Best Direction; AVID IF Award for Best Editing; Dyson IF Award for Best Production Design; ARRI IF Award for Best Cinematography; South Australian Film Corporation IF Award for Best Sound; and many others. The IF Awards for Best Music, Best Script, Best Film Festival, and Best Short Animation were not named. The lifetime achievement award was called the Jameson Living Legend IF Award.\nIn April 2012, it was announced that the IF Awards would be put \"on hold\", owing to changing economic circumstances, and competition with the AACTA Awards, which had moved to Sydney in 2011. Living Legend award recipient, film critic Margaret Pomeranz, said about the loss of the awards: \"It's a tragedy. They were wonderfully different, focussing not only on our film successes but on emerging talent like Andrew Dominik, Kath Shelper, Ryan Corr, and Anthony Maras. They were irreverent when necessary but also a lovely reflection of Australian audiences' engagement with our films. And it was always the best party in town!\".\nCategories\nThe IF Awards included, among others, the following categories over the years:\n* Contribution to Television\n* Independent Spirit\n* Best Unproduced Screenplay\n* Living Legend\n* Best Animation\n* Best Feature Film\n* Best Script\nNominations and winners\n2007 nominees\nIF Award for Best Feature Film\n*The Home Song Stories – directed by Tony Ayres and produced by Michael McMahon & Liz Watts\n*The Jammed – directed by Dee McLachlan and produced by Sally Ayre-Smith, Andrea Buck & Dee McLachlan\n*Lucky Miles – directed by Michael James Rowland and produced by Jo Dyer & Lesley Dyer\nAnimal Logic IF Award for Best Director\n*Tony Ayres – The Home Song Stories\n*Matthew Saville – Noise\n*Kriv Stenders – Boxing Day\nQueensland Events Corporation IF Award for Best Actor\n*Brendan Cowell – Noise\n*Richard Green – Boxing Day\n*Joel Lok – The Home Song Stories\nInStyle IF Award for Best Actress\n*Brenda Blethyn – Clubland\n*Joan Chen – The Home Song Stories\n*Veronica Sywak – The Jammed\nKodak IF Award for Best Cinematography\n*The Home Song Stories – Nigel Bluck\n*The Jammed – Peter Falk\n*Lucky Miles – Geoff Burton, ASC\nIF Award for Best Music\n*The Home Song Stories – Antony Partos\n*The Jammed – Grant Innes McLachlan\n*Noise – Bryony Marks\nAustralian Film Commission IF Award for Best Script\n*The Jammed – Dee McLachlan\n*The Home Song Stories – Tony Ayres\n*Lucky Miles – Michael James Rowland & Helen Barnes\nHolding Redlich IF Award for Best Short Film\n*Crocodile Dreaming – directed by Darlene Johnson & produced by Sue Milliken\n*Nana – directed by Warwick Thornton & produced by Kath Shelper\n*Soul Mates – directed by Naomi Rossdeutscher & produced by Rachel Clements and Paul Howard\nLab Sydney IF Award for Best Short Animation\n* The Goat That Ate Time – directed & produced by Lucinda Schreiber\n*Richard – directed & produced by Mick Elliott\n*Sweet & Sour – directed by Eddie White & produced by Sam White and The People's Republic of Animation\nSBS IF Award for Best Short Documentary\n*Flour, Sugar, Tea – directed by Lee Willis & produced by Gina Twyble\n*My Brother Vinnie – directed by Steven McGregor & produced by Sarah Bond\n*Nigger Lovers – directed by Rhonda Hagan & produced by Daryl Sparkes & Stephen Hagan\nIF Award for Best Documentary\n*Bomb Harvest – directed by Kim Mordaunt & produced by Sylvia Wilczynski\n*4 – directed by Tim Slade & produced by Joanna Buggy\n*Unlikely Travellers – directed by Michael Noonan & produced by Michael Noonan and John Hart\n3 Mobile IF Award for Best Music Video\n*God Told Me To – directed by Natasha Pincus.
