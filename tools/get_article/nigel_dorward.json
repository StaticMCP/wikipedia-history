He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler who played for Mashonaland County Districts. He was born in Salisbury (now Harare).\nDorward's debut came during the Logan Cup competition of 1994/95, though, batting at number one, he was unable to make much of an imprint on the scorecard.\nDorward's second and final first-class appearance came in the following season, and while he scored 23 and 3 with the bat, he did not play another first-class game.\nExternal links\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/21/21035/21035.html Nigel Dorward] at Cricket Archive"
