She travels to the fictional planet Batuu, which is also the site of Disney's Star Wars theme park attraction. She is aided by Archex, a former First Order stormtrooper. Together, they recruit locals and build a small resistance camp to fight the nearby First Order presence that has been alerted to Vi and Archex's presence.\nReception\nThe book met mixed reviews from multiple critics, some praised the book while others didn't especially enjoy it.\n*Megan Crouse of Den of Geek wrote \"Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge tie-in novel Black Spire is about good people, but, unfortunately, isn’t a very good novel. \"\n*Brian Silliman from Syfy Wire wrote: ''It's one of the first real glimpses we've gotten into what happened after [The Last Jedi] and it is a highly interesting read.\n*Meg Dowell from the website Dork Side of the Force wrote \"...Delilah S. Dawson has told an unforgettable story that has a major impact on the future of the Skywalker saga ... definitely add this book to your list. \"''\nReferences"
