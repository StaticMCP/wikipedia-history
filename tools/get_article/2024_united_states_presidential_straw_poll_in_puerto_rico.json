Puerto Rico is the second U.S. territory to use straw polls for presidential elections, after Guam introduced their own in 1980 and has conducted a preference vote to coincide with every presidential election since.\nPrimary elections\nDemocratic primary\nThe Democratic primary was held on April 28, 2024. Incumbent president Joe Biden won all 55 pledged delegates against minor opposition with 89% of the vote. However, following Biden's withdrawal from the race on July 21, the Puerto Rico delegates were instructed to pledge their support for vice president Kamala Harris at the Democratic National Convention.\nRepublican primary\nThe Republican primary was held on April 21, 2024. Former president Donald Trump, who became the party's presumptive nominee on March 12, was the only candidate on the ballot and secured all 23 delegates.\nGeneral election\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;line-height:17px\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!
