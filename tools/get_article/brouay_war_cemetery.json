The cemetery contains 377 graves, of which 7 are unidentified. The cemetery is adjacent to the commune's graveyard.\nHistory\nDuring the Allies push out of the Normandy bridgeheads, a key target was the taking of Caen. The majority of those interred in the cemetery were killed in heavy fighting in late June and July 1944 as the Allies encircled Caen (Operation Epsom, Operation Jupiter and Operation Spring).\nLocation\nThe cemetery is midway between Bayeux and Caen, in the Calvados department, on the Route d'Audrieu (D.94). It is located 3.25 kilometres southeast of Bayeux. Access is via some steps at the eastern corner of Brouay Church.\nPhotographs\nFile:Brouay War Cemetery -3 (cropped).JPG|Sacrificial cross in Brouay war cemetery\nFile:Brouay War Cemetery -3.JPG|Brouay war cemetery\nFile:Brouay War Cemetery -4.JPG|Graves in the cemetery\nFile:Brouay War Cemetery -9.JPG|Graves and cross in the cemetery\nFile:Brouay War Cemetery -2.JPG|Entrance to Brouay war cemetery\nSee also\n* American Battle Monuments Commission\n* UK National Inventory of War Memorials\n* German War Graves Commission\n* List of military cemeteries in Normandy\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Shilleto, Carl, and Tolhurst, Mike (2008). \"A Traveler's Guide to D-Day and the Battle of Normandy\".
