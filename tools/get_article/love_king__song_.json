The second remix features the rapper Young Jeezy.\nCritical reception\nVibe wrote, \"Terius Nash's new leadoff record from \"Love King\" has no \"-ellas,\" but it's still much of the same: fingersnaps, repetition, and an unescapable catchphrase (you don't know me like that!). We haven't heard mindless music that sounds this good since... The-Dream's last single.\"\nChart performance\n\"Love King\" debuted on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs chart at number 92 in the March 6, 2010, issue. It was officially sent to US radio stations on March 9, 2010. In the week following its release, it re-entered the chart at number 67, and reached its peak at number 37 the following. In the next week, due to the song gaining strong digital sales, it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 92 but fell off the chart the following week. The song later returned onto the chart at #97 but again fell off the following week.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (2010)\n!align=\"left\"|PeakPosition\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|92\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|}\nReferences"
