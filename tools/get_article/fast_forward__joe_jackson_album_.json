The album and tracklist were officially announced via Jackson's official website and was scheduled for a mid-fall release. The record was later released worldwide on 2 October 2015. Excluding his classical releases and film work, the album is his thirteenth studio project.\nThe album was developed out of plans for a series of four-track EPs, each relating to a specific city. Eventually, the EPs were combined and arranged into a full-length studio album. The four cities represented are New York City, Berlin, Amsterdam, and New Orleans, with each of the city's specific tracks having been arranged and recorded there. Jackson worked with a different set of musicians in each location. There are two covers on the album, a remake of Television's \"See No Evil\", and a rendition of the 1930s German cabaret song \"Good Bye Johnny\".\nOn 14 July 2015, Jackson released \"A Little Smile\" as an album teaser via the Caroline Music YouTube channel. On 13 August the album's first single, the titular \"Fast Forward\", was uploaded on SoundCloud.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written and arranged by Joe Jackson, except where noted.\nPersonnel\n; Musicians\n* Joe Jackson\n:-- Performing on the New York recording\n:* Regina Carter - violin\n:* Bill Frisell - guitar\n:* Brian Blade - drums\n:* Graham Maby - bass, vocals\n:-- Performing on the Amsterdam recording\n:* Aram Kersbergen - bass\n:* Benedikt Enzler - cello\n:* Stefan Kruger - drums\n:* Mitchell Sink - vocals\n:* Guido Nijs - saxophone\n:* Jan Van Duikeren - trumpet\n:* Edith Van Moergastel - viola\n:* Borika Van Den Booren, Michael Waterman - violin\n:* Claus Tofft - percussion\n:-- Performing on the Berlin recording\n:* Greg Cohen - bass\n:* Earl Harvin - drums\n:* Dirk Berger - guitar\n:* Markus Ehrlich - tenor saxophone\n:* Dima Bondarev - trumpet\n:-- Performing on the New Orleans recording\n:* Donald Harrison, Jr. - alto saxophone\n:* Robert Mercurio - bass\n:* Stanton Moore - drums\n:* Jeffrey Raines - guitar\n:* Big Sam Williams - trombone\n:* John Michael Bradford - trumpet\n; Production\n* Joe Jackson - arrangements, producer\n* Patrick 'Pat' Dillett - recording engineer (New York)\n* Kasper Frenkel - recording engineer (Amsterdam)\n* Misha Kachkachishvili - recording engineer (New Orleans)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.jj-archive.net/albums/ff.html Fast Forward] album information at [http://www.jj-archive.net The Joe Jackson Archive]"
