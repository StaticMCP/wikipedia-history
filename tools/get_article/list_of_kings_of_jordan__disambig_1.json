He serves as the head of the Jordanian monarchy—the Hashemite dynasty. The King is addressed as His Majesty ().\nJordan is a constitutional monarchy. However, the King is vested with somewhat more executive and legislative power than is typically the case for constitutional monarchs. He is commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Armed Forces and appoints the Prime Minister of Jordan and the directors of security agencies. He also appoints the members of the upper house, the Senate, as well as the members of the Constitutional Court of Jordan.\nThe current King, Abdullah II, took the throne on 7 February 1999 following the death of his father, King Hussein.\nHistory\nThe sons of Hussein bin Ali, the Grand Emir and Sharif of Mecca were set up as the Kings of Iraq and Jordan in the aftermath of the Arab Revolt and World War I.\nThe Jordanian monarchy was set up in 1921, with Abdullah I becoming Emir of the Emirate of Transjordan, a post he held from 11 April 1921 until Transjordan gained independence on 25 May 1946 as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. Once independence was gained, Abdullah was crowned the country's first monarch. The country's name was shortened to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on 26 April 1949, after the Kingdom won control of both sides of the Jordan River as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.\nSuccession\nMonarchs of Jordan (1921–present)\nEmirate of Transjordan (1921–1946)\n| life1        =  –\n| reignstart1  = 11 April 1921\n| reignend1    = 25 May 1946\n| notes1       = Previously King-designate of Iraq for a short period in 1920.Son of Hussein bin Ali\n| family1      = Hashemite\n| image1       = Abdullah I of Jordan portrait.jpg\n| alt1         = Abdullah I of Jordan\n}}\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan (1946–present)\n| life1        =  –\n| reignstart1  = 25 May 1946\n| reignend1    = 20 July 1951\n| notes1       = Proclaimed King of Palestine by the Jericho Conference in 1948\n| family1      = Hashemite\n| image1       = Abdullah I of Jordan portrait.jpg\n| alt1         = Abdullah I of Jordan\n| name2        = Talal\n| nickname2    =\n| native2      =\n| life2        =  –\n| reignstart2  = 20 July 1951\n| reignend2    = 11 August 1952\n| notes2       = Son of Abdullah I\n| family2      = Hashemite\n| image2       = Talal of Jordan (cropped).jpg\n| alt2         = Talal of Jordan\n| name3        = Hussein\n| nickname3    =\n| native3      =\n| life3        =  –\n| reignstart3  = 11 August 1952\n| reignend3    = 7 February 1999\n| notes3       = Son of Talal\n| family3      = Hashemite\n| image3       = Hussein of Jordan 1997 (cropped).jpg\n| alt3         = Hussein of Jordan\n| name4        = Abdullah II\n| nickname4    =\n| native4      =\n| life4        =\n| reignstart4  = 7 February 1999\n| reignend4    = Incumbent\n| notes4       = Son of Hussein\n| family4      = Hashemite\n| image4       = King Abdullah II (cropped).jpg\n| alt4         = Abdullah II of Jordan\n}}\nTimeline\nRoyal Standard\nSee also\n* History of Jordan\n* Royal Hashemite Court\n* Crown Prince of Jordan\n* List of Jordanian royal consorts\n* List of Sunni dynasties\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://kingabdullah.jo/en The official website of the King]"
