These included both original titles (e.g. MC Lothlorien's Pro Mountain Bike Simulator) as well as reissues of other developers' and publishers' software such as River Rescue which it acquired from the liquidation of Creative Sparks Distribution. In 1988, the company's catalogue expanded rapidly when it obtained the rights to re-release games from Piranha Software, Audiogenic, Incentive and Bubble Bus.\nBy late 1988, Commodore Computing International were noting Alternative's success, observing that they had topped Gallup's market share charts almost every week since June of that year, been the number one software house in 7 out of 8 Gallup charts and averaged a market share of 11.2% versus their nearest rival Mastertronic with 10.5%.\nIn 1989, the company began to produce titles centred around popular children's television characters. Beginning with Postman Pat, which the company claimed was the first time a licence had been acquired by a budget software house, later games would feature Count Duckula, Fireman Sam, Sooty, Thomas the Tank Engine,  The Wombles and many others.\nIn a 2015 interview, founder Roger Hulley claimed that by 1990 the company had a 17 percent share of the budget games sector.\nDuring the late 1990s, the company diversified into development of \"paint studio\", \"print studio\" and similar-type software. , the company is still active, with publication Retro Gamer noting in their 30-year retrospective of Alternative that they had \"constantly evolved in order to stay afloat in an increasingly tough industry\".\nReferences"
