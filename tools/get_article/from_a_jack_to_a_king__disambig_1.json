Originally a crossover hit for  artist Ned Miller, who also wrote \"Dark Moon\", \"A Falling Star\", and many other country songs. It has been covered extensively by country music artists.\nNed Miller version\nThe original version was recorded by Ned Miller. First released in 1957 by both Fabor Records (for regional audiences) and Dot Records (for national distribution), Miller's version was unsuccessful until he persuaded his label to re-release it in 1962. Upon re-release, the song became a crossover hit, charting in the Top 10 on the Billboard U.S. country (#2), pop (#6), and adult contemporary (#3) charts. In addition, Miller's version reached #1 on the Irish Singles Chart, while peaking at #2 on the UK Singles Chart. Furthermore, it was the sixth-most-played single of 1963 in the United Kingdom. Miller's chart success was limited after the song, however, and by the 1970s he stopped recording entirely.\nThe song was also recorded in 1962 by Jim Reeves on the occasion of his tour to South Africa in August and charted there that year.\nChart positions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1963)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canada (CHUM Chart) (5 weeks)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nRicky Van Shelton version\n| recorded   = January 19, 1988\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = Country\n| length     =\n| label      = Columbia Nashville\n| writer     = Ned Miller\n| producer   = Steve Buckingham\n| prev_title = I'll Leave This World Loving You\n| prev_year  = 1988\n| next_title = Hole in My Pocket\n| next_year  = 1989\n}}\nIn December 1988, American country music artist Ricky Van Shelton released his own version of \"From a Jack to a King\".
