Composed in 1909, it was not premiered until 6 June 1924 in Prague conducted by Alexander Zemlinsky with Marie Gutheil-Schoder as the soprano. The opera takes the unusual form of a monologue for solo soprano accompanied by a large orchestra. In performance, it lasts for about half an hour. It is sometimes paired with Béla Bartók's opera ''Bluebeard's Castle (1911), as the two works were roughly contemporary and share similar psychological themes. Schoenberg described Erwartung, saying \"the aim is to represent in slow motion everything that occurs during a single second of maximum spiritual excitement, stretching it out to half an hour.\"\nPhilip Friedheim has described '' as Schoenberg's \"only lengthy work in an athematic style\", where no musical material returns once stated over the course of 426 measures. In his analysis of the structure, one indication of the complexity of the music is that the first scene of over 30 bars contains 9 meter changes and 16 tempo changes. Herbert Buchanan has countered this description of the work as \"athematic\", and the general impression of it as \"atonal\", in his own analysis.\nThe musicologist Charles Rosen has said that , along with Berg's Wozzeck and Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, is among the \"impregnable\" \"great monuments of modernism.\" According to Christopher Small, \"Schoenberg's intuitive understanding of the integrative process of dreams is revealed especially in the marvellous closing pages, filled as they are with tenderness and longing. At the end we can almost see the sleeper awake as with a scurry of chromatic scales the music vanished from our hearing and the dream recedes from her waking mind.\"\nPerformance history\n' had its British premiere on 9 January 1931, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by the composer.\nIt was the first live opera shown on Times Square in New York City in a production by Robin Rhode in November 2015 (2 performances).\nRoles\n* The Woman (soprano)\nSynopsis\n:Time: Night\n:Place: A forest\nA woman is in an apprehensive state as she searches for her lover. In the darkness, she comes across what she first thinks is a body, but then realises is a tree-trunk. She is frightened and becomes more anxious as she cannot find the man she is looking for. She then finds a dead body, and sees that it is her lover. She calls out for assistance, but there is no response. She tries to revive him, and addresses him as if he were still alive, angrily charging him with being unfaithful to her.
