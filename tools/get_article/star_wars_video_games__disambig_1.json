Some are based directly on films while others rely heavily on the Star Wars Expanded Universe.\nStar Wars games have gone through three significant development eras: early licensed games (1979–1993), games developed after the creation of LucasArts (1993–2013), and games created after the closure of LucasArts (2014–present), which are currently licensed to Electronic Arts, and include an EA Star Wars logo.\nThe first Star Wars games were developed by a variety of companies after Star Wars creator George Lucas licensed the rights to Star Wars video games; several of these games were released under the Lucasfilm Games banner. Early licensed games, released during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras of gaming, barely featured any kind of narrative, and many were action titles that either retold the stories of the original trilogy (1977–1983) or focused on a single scene of a film.\nLater on, Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market, and decided to create his own video game development company, LucasArts, so he could have more creative control over the games and their narratives. During this era, graphics evolved enough for games to be able to tell complex narratives, leading to games that featured more advanced retellings of the stories of the films, with voice-overs and CGI cut scenes, as well as original titles with new narratives that were set in the same continuity as the films. After The Walt Disney Company's purchase of Lucasfilm in 2012 and the closure of LucasArts the following year, the games developed during the first two eras were discarded from the canon in 2014 and reassigned to the non-canonical Star Wars Legends label.\nFollowing LucasArts' closure, the rights to produce Star Wars video games were reassigned solely to Electronic Arts. Games published during this era are considered canonical to the franchise, and have featured more influence from the Lucasfilm Story Group, responsible for managing aspects of Star Wars canon. The EA Star Wars license had been set to expire in 2023, but in 2021, Lucasarts announced new partnerships for others to produce Star Wars and other Lucasfilm games alongside Electronic Arts.\nAlthough many hobbyists and independent game developers have created freeware games based on the Star Wars movie series and brand, this page lists only the games that have been developed or published by LucasArts, or officially licensed by Lucasfilm.\nAs of 2020, there have been over 90 million copies of Star Wars games sold.\nEarly licensed games (1979–1993)\nIn 1978, Apple Computer produced an unlicensed Star Wars game on cassette tape for its Apple II. As a \"space pilot trainee\", the player destroys TIE fighters using a first-person heads-up display. The first video game cartridge bearing the name Star Wars appeared that year on the RCA Studio II clones Sheen M1200 and Mustang Telespiel Computer.\nThe first official licensed Star Wars electronic game was Kenner's 1979 table-top Star Wars Electronic Battle Command. The game had three levels of play (basic, intermediate, and advanced). Players took turns examining star systems with the aim of avoiding black holes, locating enemies, and searching for MAGNA, \"the FORCE-giving star\". The game was billed as \"the most exciting computer game you will ever play\".\nThe original trilogy\nLicensed releases for the Atari 2600 began with The Empire Strikes Back (1982) in which the player piloted a snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth, destroying AT-AT walkers. Several other games appeared, such as Return of the Jedi: Death Star Battle (1983), where the player controlled the Millennium Falcon in a mission to destroy the second Death Star, and Jedi Arena (1983), the first game to attempt to simulate a lightsaber battle (in this case, clearly inspired by the Star Wars scene, where Luke Skywalker trains with a seeker). In 1983, the Star Wars arcade game was released by Atari based on the 1977 film. In this game (featuring color vector graphics and the first ever digitized speech from a film) the player enters the seat of Luke's Red Five X-Wing fighter, battles waves of TIE fighters led by Darth Vader, weaves through towers across the surface of the Death Star, and plummets through the battle station's trench in an attempt to destroy it. The sequel for the game, The Empire Strikes Back, used the same technology to re-create scenes from the second film, including battles with AT-AT walkers and an asteroid field.\nIn 1987, UK software publisher Domark released several 8-bit versions of the Star Wars vector arcade game, followed by similar conversions in 1988 of The Empire Strikes Back machine. In 1987, Namco developed a Star Wars game for the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom) for the Japanese market exclusively, based on the 1977 film, but with several liberties taken with its storyline.\nIn 1991, the platform game Star Wars was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, Game Boy and Game Gear, and one year later, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back covered the plotline of the fifth episode of the saga. Also in 1992, Super Star Wars was released for the SNES, followed by the remaining games in the trilogy: Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1993) and Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1994), the latter also receiving conversions for the Game Boy and Game Gear in 1995.\nThe following is a list of Star Wars games that are based on the feature films, developed during this development era:\nEpisode IV: A New Hope\n* Star Wars (1983–88) – Arcade\n** Re-released for: Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit computers, ColecoVision, BBC Micro, ZX Spectrum,[Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Apple II, MS-DOS, Mac,[Amiga.\n* Death Star Interceptor (1984/85, System 3 Software Ltd) (unlicensed) – Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum\n* Star Wars (1987) – Famicom\n* Star Wars: Attack on the Death Star (1991) – PC-98, X68000\n* Star Wars (1991–93) – NES, Game Boy, Master System,[Game Gear\n* Super Star Wars (1992, the first game in the Super Star Wars trilogy) -Super NES\n** Re-released for: Wii Virtual Console, PS5, Vita]\n* Star Wars Arcade (1993) – Arcade\n** Re-released for: 32X\nEpisode V: The Empire Strikes Back\n* Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1982) – Atari 2600, Intellivision\n* Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1985/88) – Arcade\n** Re-released for: BBC Micro, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari.\n* Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1992) – NES, Game Boy\n* Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1993, the second game in the Super Star Wars trilogy) – SNES\n** Re-released for: Wii Virtual Console\nEpisode VI: Return of the Jedi\n* Star Wars: Return of the Jedi – Death Star Battle (1983/84) – Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 5200, ZX Spectrum\n* Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1984/88) – Arcade, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari ST, GameCube\n* Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1994, the third game in the Super Star Wars trilogy) – SNES, Game Boy, Game Gear\n** Re-released for: Wii Virtual Console\n* Canceled: Star Wars: Return of the Jedi – Ewok Adventure – Atari 2600 (unreleased)\nStand-alone titles\n1980s\n* Star Wars: Jedi Arena (1983) – Atari 2600\n** Re-released for: Mobile (2005)\n* Star Wars: Droids (1988) – Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum – based on the Star Wars: Droids series\nLucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2013)\nIn the early 1980s George Lucas decided to invest in videogames. So through Lucasfilm, Lucas started his own video game company, which he named LucasArts. However, since Lucas had already licensed the rights to develop Star Wars games, the company instead developed original adventure games and World War II flight combat games. LucasArts regained the rights to develop Star Wars games in 1993, at that point the videogame company put their previous experience in flight simulators to use, and released a Star Wars: X-Wing, the first self-published Star Wars video game and the first space flight simulation based on the franchise.\nThe Phantom Menace\n* Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) – Windows, PlayStation\n* Star Wars: Episode I (1999) – Pinball\n* Star Wars Episode I: Racer (1999) – Windows, Mac, Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color\n** Re-released for: Nintendo Switch (2020), PlayStation 4 (2020), and Xbox One (2020)\n* Star Wars: Racer Arcade (2000) – Arcade\n* Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles (2000/01) – PlayStation, Dreamcast, Game Boy Advance\n* Star Wars Episode I: Battle for Naboo (2000/01) – Nintendo 64, Windows\n* ''Star Wars Episode I: Obi-Wan's Adventures (2000) – Game Boy Color\n* Star Wars: Starfighter (2001) – Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Arcade\n** Star Wars: Starfighter Special Edition (2001) Xbox\n** Star Wars: Starfighter (2003) Arcade\n* Star Wars: Obi-Wan (2001) – Xbox\nAfter the release of Episode I in theaters in 1999, games from the prequel trilogy were released for most major platforms. The first releases were video game adaptation (action-adventure) and Star Wars Episode I: Racer, based on the podracing sequence in movie. Others, including Battle for Naboo and Jedi Power Battles, were released, but with little success. The first strategic game in the Star Wars expanded universe was titled Star Wars: Rebellion and broke new ground in that it incorporated ships and planets not found in the original canon, such as the Rebel Assault Frigate and the Bulwark Cruiser. But for all its ground-breaking new looks, it was not as successful as would have been hoped. The second strategic title, Star Wars: Force Commander was also released, but failed to keep up with other RTS games, since it was more focused on battling (with no resource gathering) and used a primitive 3D engine. About a decade later, resource gathering lost popularity in favor of faster-paced combat-centric RTS games.\nAttack of the Clones\n* Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter (2002) PlayStation 2, Xbox\n* Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2002) (Action) PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox\n* Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) – Game Boy Advance\n* Star Wars: The New Droid Army (2002) – Game Boy Advance\nIn 2002, Attack of the Clones premiered in theaters, and another wave of Star Wars based games, including The Clone Wars, Star Wars Racer Revenge, and Bounty Hunter were released, this time focusing on events and characters from Attack of the Clones such as bounty hunter Jango Fett and the Clone Wars.\nStar Wars: Jedi Starfighter'' was released, allowing the player to be a Jedi Master flying a Jedi starfighter. A third RTS game with a much more conventional approach to the genre's norms and using the Age of Kings engine, Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, offered a better alternative to those seeking strategy in the Star Wars universe.\nRevenge of the Sith\n* Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005) – PlayStation 2, Xbox\n** Handheld and mobile: Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, Mobile\nAdjoining the release of Revenge of the Sith, a video game adaptation (action) was also released close to the premiere, with various degrees of success. Star Wars: Republic Commando was also released in 2005.\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars animated series\n* Star Wars: The Clone Wars – Lightsaber Duels (2008) – Wii\n* Star Wars: The Clone Wars – Jedi Alliance (2008) – Nintendo DS\n* Star Wars: The Clone Wars – Republic Heroes (2009) – Windows, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii\n* Clone Wars Adventures (2010) – Windows, Mac (Shutdown)\nLegends franchises\nFormerly known as Star Wars Expanded Universe, this continuity was renamed into Legends in 2014 and all media based on them, including video games, ceased to be canon. The X-Wing series marked the start of the Star Wars games moving away from remaking the official films and began to focus more on the Expanded Universe. Other titles were published or licensed by LucasArts, such as The Software Toolworks's Star Wars Chess who also used the first \"multimedia explosion\" to release Rebel Assault (1993), which used FMV and photos extensively.\nThe 1996 Nintendo 64 title Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire was part of a LucasArts attempt to create a story between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of Jedi, putting the player in control of mercenary Dash Rendar. Shadows of the Empire featured fan-favorite parts from the Super Star Wars line, such as another reenactment of the Battle of Hoth, piloting a snowspeeder and tying a cable around AT-ATs legs. After the original trilogy was re-released as the \"Special Editions\" in 1997, LucasArts published other titles, including Star Wars: Yoda Stories and Star Wars Monopoly, as well as a Star Wars-themed fighting game, Star Wars: Masters of Teräs Käsi.\nX-Wing\n* Star Wars: X-Wing (1993) – DOS, Macintosh\n** Expansion(s): Imperial Pursuit (1993) and B-Wing (1993)\n** Compilation: ''X-Wing (Collector's CD-ROM) (1994)\n* Star Wars: TIE Fighter (1994) – DOS, Macintosh\n** Expansion(s): Defender of the Empire (1994)\n** Compilation: TIE Fighter (Collector's CD-ROM) (1995)\n* Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter (1997) – Windows\n** Expansions: Balance of Power Campaigns (1997), and Flight School (1998)\n* Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance (1999) – Windows\nStar Wars: X-Wing was one of the best-selling games of 1993, and established the beginning of the X-Wing computer game series, which garnered numerous awards and recognition. Star Wars: X-Wing was followed by several sequels and expansions, such as Star Wars: TIE Fighter, Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, and Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance.\nRebel Assault\n* Star Wars: Rebel Assault (1993) DOS, Mac, Sega CD, 3DO\n* Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire (1995) DOS, PlayStation, Mac\nJedi Knight\n* Star Wars: Dark Forces (1995) DOS, Mac, PlayStation\n* Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II (1997) Windows\n** Expansion(s): Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith (1998) Windows\n* Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast (2002) Windows, Mac, Xbox, GameCube\n* Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy'' (2003) Windows, Mac, Xbox\nThe first step towards modern games was done with 1995's Dark Forces, the first Star Wars first-person shooter video game. A hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy, it featured new gameplay features and graphical elements not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts' custom-designed game engine, called the Jedi. The game was well received and well reviewed, the game put the player in the role of Kyle Katarn, who would later appear in multiple games, novels, and comics. After the Special Edition original trilogy re-release in 1997, LucasArts published Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, then Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith released in 1999. In 2002, its sequel Jedi Outcast was released and gave players the first chance to experience advanced lightsaber duels, and it also detached itself from the usual idea of movie tie-ins. One year later, the last game in the Jedi Knight series, Jedi Academy was released. Katarn is a former Imperial stormtrooper who joins the Rebellion and ultimately becomes a Jedi, a plot arc similar to that of Finn in the 2015 film The Force Awakens.\nRogue Squadron\n* Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (1998) Windows, Nintendo 64\n* Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader (2001) GameCube\n* Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike (2003) GameCube\n** Note: The co-op campaign of Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike, is composed of all the missions of the single player campaign of the previous game, Rogue Leader (except for two missions which are not included), and such missions can only be played in multiplayer, and can not be played in single-player. Additionally as a bonus, the game includes the Arcade games of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.\nStar Wars Racer\n* Star Wars Episode I: Racer (1999) Windows, Mac, Dreamcast, Nintendo 64\n** Handheld: Game Boy Color\n* Star Wars: Racer Arcade (2000) Arcade\n* Star Wars Racer Revenge (2002) PlayStation 2\n** Re-released for: PlayStation Store (2015), PlayStation 4 (2019)\n* Racer-related title:\n** Star Wars: Super Bombad Racing (2001) PlayStation 2\nGalactic Battlegrounds\n* Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds (2001) Windows, Mac\n** Expansion(s): Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns (2002) Windows, Mac\nStarfighter\n* Star Wars: Starfighter (2001) Windows, PlayStation 2\n** Star Wars: Starfighter Special Edition (2001) Xbox\n** Star Wars: Starfighter (2003) Arcade\n* Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter (2002) Xbox, PlayStation 2\nKnights of the Old Republic\n* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (2003) Windows, Xbox, Mac, iOS, Android\n* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords (2004) Windows, Xbox, Mac\n* Star Wars: The Old Republic (2011) (MMORPG) Windows\n** Expansion(s): Rise of the Hutt Cartel (2013), Galactic Starfighter (2014), Galactic Strongholds (2014), Shadow of Revan (2014), Knights of the Fallen Empire (2015), Knights of the Eternal Throne (2016), Onslaught (2019) and Legacy of the Sith (2021)\n* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake (TBA) PlayStation 5, Windows\n* Canceled: Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic III Windows, Xbox\n*** Mobile: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic (2013) iOS, Android\nIn 2003, Knights of the Old Republic, a BioWare RPG that debuted on the Microsoft Xbox and PC. Knights (also known as KotOR among fans) was critically acclaimed, even winning \"Game of the Year\" at the Game Developers Choice Awards, (along with [http://www.lucasarts.com/products/swkotor/awards.html many other critics]) in 2003. Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released in 2004. The Sith Lords was praised for its cerebral writing and moral ambiguity, similar to The Empire Strikes Back, but criticized for being derivative of the first game and being released in an incomplete state. Another MMORPG titled Star Wars: The Old Republic was developed by BioWare, which released globally on 20 December 2011. Pre-orders went up for sale in July 2011 and open beta weekends were confirmed for September 2011.\nStar Wars: Battlefront (Pandemic Studios)\n* Star Wars: Battlefront (2004) PlayStation 2, Windows, Xbox, Mac\n* Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005) PlayStation 2, Windows, Xbox, PlayStation Portable\n* Canceled: Star Wars: Battlefront III (2008) (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)\n** Handheld:\n*** Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron (2007) PlayStation Portable\n*** Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron (2009) PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS\n** Mobile:\n*** Star Wars: Battlefront Mobile (2005)\n*** Star Wars Battlefront: Mobile Squadrons (2009)\nPandemic Studios' Battlefront consisted of two games, Star Wars: Battlefront (2004) and Star Wars: Battlefront II in 2005, both games sharing three common platforms: the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PC.\nA third Star Wars: Battlefront title was planned for 2006 but was cancelled. Two spin-offs were released, Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron, released in 2007 for the PlayStation Portable and Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron on 3 November 2009 for the Nintendo DS and the PlayStation Portable.

Two more games, Star Wars Galaxies: Episode III Rage of the Wookiees (its second expansion, which ties in with the concurrently-released Revenge of the Sith), and after the films, more Star Wars titles continued to be developed and released. Empire at War (an RTS), was released in early 2006. While released and being active for years, Star Wars Galaxies'' servers shut down on 15 December 2011. Notwithstanding the game's closure, there are several private emulator projects in various stages of development that intend to allow users to experience Star Wars Galaxies in different incarnations of the game's existence. However, since the game can no longer be played the way it was originally meant, the game is considered to be cancelled.\nClosure of LucasArts and cancelled stand-alone-games\nAt E3 2012, EA with LucasArts announced Star Wars 1313, which focuses more on the life of a bounty hunter as he descends to the level 1313 on Coruscant to unravel a criminal plot. The game focuses more on gunplay and bounty hunter gameplay rather than the Force users and lightsabers combat. It was set to release in Fall 2013 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Windows. 1313 has subsequently been cancelled by LucasArts following its purchase by Disney. The following are the stand-alone Star Wars videogames that were canceled, the canceled titles that were part of a series are listed along its respective series.\n* Star Wars 1313 (2013) (Action-adventure)\n* Star Wars Outpost (2013)\n* Star Wars: First Assault (2013) (First-person shooter)\n* Star Wars: Attack Squadrons (2014)\n* Star Wars: Battle of the Sith Lords (Action-adventure)\n* Star Wars: Rivals (2018) (Third-person shooter)\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, it was announced that LucasArts' development arm would stop making video games indefinitely. In addition to this, various online browser games have shut down their servers, and can no longer be played.\nElectronic Arts gains the Star Wars license, and the restructuring of the Star Wars canon (2013–2023)\nAfter LucasArts was shut down, on April 3, 2013, Disney and Lucasfilm revealed a partnership with Electronic Arts (EA) that granted EA exclusive rights to produce Star Wars games for consoles and PC for a decade, with Disney retaining the freedom to handle the games for mobile platforms, such as smartphones, tablets, and browsers. On October 14, 2014, EA released its first Star Wars video game under the Disney brand, and their deal was expected expire on October 14, 2024, where Electronic Arts was expected to leave the franchise on the designated date.\nOn April 24, 2014, most of the previous licensed Star Wars video games, novels, and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise.\nAmong the EA subsidiaries responsible for creating the Star Wars games within the deal, were the developers DICE, BioWare, Visceral Games, and Respawn Entertainment. After the canon restructuring, EA announced their new games would fall under the restructured canon. As of the release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, all EA-produced Star Wars games are considered canonical, although only the ones with an actual \"story mode\" narrative.\nFollowing the massive player reception of Star Wars Battlefront II and the success of Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said that they are doubling down on the Star Wars games, meaning that a possible revival for the Battlefront series or more video games that have yet to be reported in development.\nDue to the lower-than-expected sales, EA's exclusive deal was halted in January 2021, more than three years before their contract was set to expire on October 14, 2024. The lower-than-expected sales and mixed fan reception towards Electronic Arts' handling of the Battlefront sub-franchise had led to rumors of Lucasfilm considering changing the terms of the license. Lucasfilm was rumored to be courting either Ubisoft or Activision to either replace EA or share rights to develop Star Wars games with them.\nReboots\nBattlefront (EA DICE)\n* Star Wars Battlefront (2015) – PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One\n** Singleplayer and Multiplayer\n* Star Wars Battlefront II (2017) – PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One\n** Singleplayer and Multiplayer.\nAfter the restructuring of the Star Wars canon, the Battlefront series formerly developed by Pandemic was rebooted by EA DICE. The first game was released in 2015, rushed into the market to tie in with the release of The Force Awakens. As a result of the shorter development time, developer EA DICE decided to take a significant departure from all previous installments of the franchise and focus the game entirely on online multiplayer, completely axing the inclusion of a single player campaign or any sort of narrative; the move was heavily criticized by fans, including Finn actor John Boyega. Only original trilogy characters (Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Boba Fett, Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine) and planets (Tatooine, Hoth and Endor) were playable on launch. Downloadable content later added the planets Jakku (from The Force Awakens), Bespin (from The Empire Strikes Back), Scarif (from Rogue One), in addition to the Death Star battle station (from A New Hope), and heroes Nien Numb, Greedo (Outer Rim), Lando Calrissian, Dengar (Bespin), Chewbacca, Bossk (Death Star), and Jyn Erso and Director Krennic (Rogue One: Scarif). The first Battlefront also received a PlayStation VR add-on mission, the Rogue One X-Wing VR Mission.\nThe second Battlefront is the first in the series to be considered part of the Star Wars canon. It addresses a major criticism of the previous game by including a singleplayer campaign with a story mode set between the ending of Return of the Jedi and the beginning of The Force Awakens, in which the player controls an Imperial special forces commander named Iden Versio; additionally, characters from the films, including Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Han Solo, Lando Calrissian and Kylo Ren are playable. The multiplayer mode features characters from the original, prequel, and sequel trilogies, as well as anthology films. Future content was originally going to be distributed in a \"season\" system, though this was changed to monthly updates.\nStar Wars Jedi series\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (2019)\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a singleplayer game developed by Respawn Entertainment.

On 17 October 2017, EA announced the closure of Visceral Games.

The fan made game was in production using Unreal Engine 4 and was based on the cancelled Star Wars: Battlefront III by Free Radical Design. Although early versions of the game contained assets from Free Radical Design, they soon became \"place holders\" as the full game planned to be released using assets and music made from the ground up. On 4 June 2016, Galaxy in Turmoil gained a distribution deal through Valve and was planned to be released for free on Steam which generated a fair amount of attention.\nOn 22 June 2016 Lucasfilm requested the production of Galaxy in Turmoil be halted. On 31 July 2016, Frontwire Studios announced the cancellation of the game was due to the \"possibility of Galaxy in Turmoil taking away attention from Electronic Arts' Battlefront franchise\". Proposals of Galaxy in Turmoil falling under the paywall of Electronic Arts, and ideas of Lucasfilm giving Frontwire Studios a Star Wars IP licence were both rejected due to an agreement between Electronic Arts and Lucasfilm. Although Frontwire Studios may have fallen within Fair Use laws, legal conflict was avoided and the fan made Star Wars inspired project was canceled. There is a playable alpha that contains assets from Free Radical Design that was released to the public then removed early on within Galaxy in Turmoils lifetime. Galaxy in Turmoil is now planned to be released as a brand new \"cyber-punk\" themed IP without any Star Wars references, but still with Battlefront III-inspired mechanics including space-to-ground battles.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=2358 IPDB entry for Star Wars.]\n* [http://www.pinpedia.com/machine/784 Recent Auction Results for Star Wars]"
