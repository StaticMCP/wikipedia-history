It is compiled by a rotating group of 32 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 800.\n|Week11-1   \t= Connecticut (18-0) (32)\n|Week11-1-Color \t=\n|Week11-2   \t= Notre Dame (15-0)\n|Week11-2-Color \t=\n|Week11-3   \t= Duke
