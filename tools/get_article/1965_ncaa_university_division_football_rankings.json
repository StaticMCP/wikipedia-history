Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| National champion\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nAP Poll\nFor the first time in its history, the final AP Poll was released in January, after the bowl games. This practice would not be repeated again for the next two seasons, but has been the standard since the 1968 season.\nThe AP Poll ranked only the top ten teams from 1962 through 1967. Entering New Year's Day, the top three teams (Michigan State, Arkansas, Nebraska) were all 10–0, but all three lost.\n|Week2Date = Sep 20\n|Week3Date = Sep 27\n|Week4Date = Oct 4\n|Week5Date = Oct
