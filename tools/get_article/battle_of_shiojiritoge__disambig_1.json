Approaching in the night and attacking at dawn, Shingen caught his enemy unprepared, taking the camp as Ogasawara's men \"grabbed their armor and swords.\"\nThis battle was one of many which serve as examples of Takeda Shingen's expertise and specialty in using cavalry to maximum effect.\nReferences\n*Turnbull, Stephen (1998).
