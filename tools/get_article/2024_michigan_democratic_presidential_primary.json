The contest took place concurrently with its Republican counterpart.\nDespite Biden winning in a landslide, he faced a challenge from \"uncommitted\" in an otherwise generally uncontested primary season. It was the first entity to win delegates outside of Biden that primary season, and won over 100,000 votes. The campaign's performance was attributed to Arab, Muslim, young and progressive voters protesting Biden over his handling of the Gaza war. The uncommitted vote in Michigan inspired similar protest votes in other states, eventually becoming a national movement.\nCandidates\nThe Michigan Secretary of State identified the following candidates (listed alphabetically) as Democratic Party presidential candidates in 2024:\n* Joe Biden\n* Dean Phillips\n* Marianne Williamson\n* Uncommitted\nWilliamson suspended her campaign on February 8, following the Nevada primary. However, she was still listed on the ballot, and after finishing ahead of Phillips, she re-entered the race.\nCampaign for \"uncommitted\"\nIn addition, an 'uncommitted' option appeared on the ballot. Any \"uncommitted\" delegate awarded to the Democratic National Convention would essentially be an \"unpledged\" superdelegate and free to support any candidate they chose. Numerous activists and elected officials, including Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud and House Representative Rashida Tlaib, campaigned for voters to select the uncommitted option in protest of Biden's handling of the Gaza war. Some Armenian Americans also suggested voting uncommitted over Biden's actions involving the 2023 Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh.\nIn response, the advocacy group Democratic Majority for Israel ran ads arguing that voting \"uncommitted\" would weaken Biden and support Donald Trump. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer stated that although she acknowledges the \"pain\" people feel about the war, she still encouraged people to vote for Biden because \"any vote that's not cast for Joe Biden supports a second Trump term\".\nEndorsements\nU.S. Senator\n* Gary Peters, U.S. Senator from Michigan (2015–present), U.S. Representative for MI-14 (2013–15) and MI-09 (2009–13)\nU.S. Representatives\n* Dan Kildee, U.S. Representative from  (2013–present)\nStatewide officials\n* Gretchen Whitmer, 49th Governor of Michigan (2019–present), Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee (2021–present)\n* Garlin Gilchrist, 64th Lieutenant Governor of Michigan (2019–present)\nMayors\n* Mike Duggan, 75th Mayor of Detroit (2014–present)\n}}\n}}\n(2019–2023)\n* Rashida Tlaib, U.S. Representative from  (2023−present),  (2019–2023)\n* Beto O'Rourke, former U.S. Representative from  (2013–2019), candidate for president in 2020\nState legislators\n* Abraham Aiyash, State Representative from HD-04 (2020–present) and Majority Floor Leader (2023–present)\n* Erin Byrnes, State Representative from HD-15 (2023–present)\n* Jaime Churches, State Representative from HD-27 (2023–present)\n* Emily Dievendorf, State Representative from HD-77 (2023–present)\n* Alabas Farhat, State Representative from HD-03 (2023–present)\n* Gabriela Santiago-Romero, Detroit City councilmember from District 6 (2022–present)\n* Karen Whitsett, State Representative from HD-04 (2018–present)\n* Dylan Wegela, State Representative from HD-26 (2023–present)\n* Mary D.

However, he recorded his strongest result in the 13th precinct in the eastern part of the city, where a retirement community is located.\nSee also\n* 2024 Michigan Republican presidential primary\n* 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 United States presidential election\n* 2024 United States presidential election in Michigan\n* 2024 United States elections\nNotes\nPartisan clients\nReferences"
