It was built about 1806 and is a rectangular two story, five bay wide center hall brick residence with a one-story three bay side wing.  It was remodeled in the 1860s and in the 1920s.  The 1860s remodeling resulted in the picturesque Gothic / Italianate character with the prominent cross cut gable and decorative front verandah.  The house was used as an inn in the early 19th century and as a roadside restaurant in the 1930s.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nReferences"
