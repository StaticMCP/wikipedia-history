There were also French, British, and German balloon corps.\nThe history of military ballooning includes the American Civil War era Union Army Balloon Corps and the even earlier French Aerostatic Corps.\nType R Observation balloon at USAF Museum]]\nAt the start of World War I, the organization of the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force included observation balloon units organized into companies, squadrons, and wings and each company was equipped with one balloon. Five companies comprised a squadron, and three squadrons made up a wing. By the end of the war 110 companies had been created. In the field Balloon companies were allotted to the ground units they supported as needed. In 1918 June, with squadron organization discontinued, company designations were numbered and organized into groups. Only 35 companies made it to France with the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). 17 companies served at the front, making 1,642 combat ascensions, while six other groups were en route to the front at the armistice.\nAfter the war, the National Association of American Balloon Corps Veterans was organized and published a history of the service: Eyes of the Army : a story about the Observation Balloon Service of World War I by Craig S. Herbert. The group published a quarterly newsletter titled Haul Down and Ease Off.\n1 to 50\n* 1st Balloon Squadron\n** A, 14-Aug-1917, Split into 25th, and 26th 16-Feb-1918\n** B,\n** C,\n** D,\n** HHC\n* 2d Balloon Squadron\n** A, - 1st Balloon company 1-Oct-1917 (AEF)\n** B, - 2nd Balloon company ?-?-1917 (AEF)\n** C, - 3rd Balloon company 13-Sept-1917 (AEF)\n** D, - 4th Balloon company 25-Sept-1917 (AEF)\n**HHC\n* 3d Balloon Squadron\n** A, - 5th Balloon company 4-Nov-1917 (AEF)\n** B, - 6th Balloon company 4-Nov-1917 (AEF)\n** C, - 7th Balloon company 3-Nov-1917 (AEF)\n** D, - 8th Balloon company 4-Nov-1917 (AEF)\n** HHC\n* 4th Balloon Squadron\n** A, - 9th Balloon company 14-Nov-1917 (AEF)\n** B, - 10th Balloon company 14-Nov-1917 (AEF)\n** C, - 13th Balloon company 22-Jan-1918 (AEF)\n** D, - 14th Balloon company 13-Nov-1917 (AEF)\n** HHC\n* 5th Balloon Squadron\n** A, - 11th Balloon company ?-?-?
