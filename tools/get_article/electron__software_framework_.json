The framework is designed to create desktop applications using web technologies (mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript, although other technologies such as front-end frameworks and WebAssembly are possible) that are rendered using a version of the Chromium browser engine and a back end using the Node.js runtime environment. It also uses various APIs to enable functionality such as native integration with Node.js services and an inter-process communication module.\nElectron was originally built for Atom and is the main GUI framework behind several other open-source projects including GitHub Desktop, Light Table, WordPress Desktop, and Eclipse Theia. It is also used in Microsoft's proprietary code editor Visual Studio Code.\nArchitecture\nElectron applications include a \"main\" process and several \"renderer\" processes. The main process runs the logic for the application (e.g., menus, shell commands, lifecycle events), and can then launch multiple renderer processes by instantiating an instance of the  class, which loads a window that appears on the screen by rendering HTML and CSS.\nBoth the main and renderer processes can run with Node.js integration if the  field in the main process is set to .\nMost of Electron's APIs are written in C++ or Objective-C and are exposed directly to the application code through JavaScript bindings.\nHistory\nIn September 2021, Electron moved to an eight-week release cycle between major versions to match the release cycle of Chromium Extended Stable and to comply with a new requirement from the Microsoft Store that requires browser-based apps to be within two major versions of the latest release of the browser engine.\nElectron frequently releases new major versions along every other Chromium release. The latest three stable versions are supported by the Electron team.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Version history\n! Release !! Status !! Release date !! End of life date || Chromium version !!

The Brave browser was based on Electron before it was rewritten to use Chromium directly, while Microsoft Teams used Electron before 2.0.\nReception\nThe most common criticism of Electron is that it necessitates software bloat when used for simple programs. As a result, Michael Larabel has referred to the framework as \"notorious among most Linux desktop users for being resource heavy, not integrating well with most desktops, and generally being despised.\"\nResearchers have shown that Electron's large feature set can be hijacked by bad actors with write access to the source JavaScript files. This requires root access on *nix systems and is not considered to be a vulnerability by the Electron developers. Those who are concerned that Electron is not always based on the newest version of Chromium have recommended progressive web applications as an alternative.\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
