About  north of Chihuahua, Mexico, at the crossing of the Sacramento River, American forces numbering less than 1,000 defeated the superior Mexican army.\nBackground\nOn February 8, Colonel Alexander Doniphan's force of 924 soldiers and 300 civilians left El Paso del Norte for Chihuahua, despite learning that John E. Wool had abandoned his march there.  Major Samuel Owens had the civilians formed into a battalion along with the caravan of 312 wagons. On 25 February, they reached the Laguna de Encenillas, where they learned of the Mexican defenses prepared for them.\nGovernor Trias had built up a force under the command of General Jose A. Heredia, consisting of Around 800 cavalry (Gen. Garcia Conde: Vera Cruz Dragoons, Durango & Chihuahua Lancers), 250 infantry (Chihuahua Activos), 119 artillerymen (10 field guns & 6 culverins), 180 National Guards and Mostly Volunteer rancheros. They had constructed a redoubt near the Hacienda Sacramento where the El Paso road crosses the river, and at Hacienda el Torreon  to the west.\nAt sunrise on February 28, the Americans took up the line of march and formed the whole wagon train into four columns with the artillery and mounted men in the middle.  Three companies screened the front. When the Americans arrived within sight of the Mexican defenses, Doniphan made a reconnaissance of the enemy positions. Twenty-three separate works had been dug for twelve 4- to 9-pounders and nine lighter pieces.\nBattle\nDoniphan used his cavalry to screen the movement of his force parallel to the Arroyo Seco and to the right and out of range of the Mexican artillery.  Doniphan formed the wagons into a fort after crossing the gully onto a plateau, and Major Meriwether Lewis Clark Sr.'s guns fired on General Garcia Conde's lancers, forcing them to flee.\nDoniphan's men approached the southernmost Mexican earthworks, held by Heredia's best troops. Doniphan ordered Capt. Richard H. Weightman's twin howitzers to the front accompanied by Capt. Reid's force of mounted cavalry men.  Major Owens was killed in the charge, but Missourians took the fort.\nTrias made a counterattack and Captured an Artillery piece that made the Americans Retreat. By 5 PM the fighting was over.\nAftermath\nUnable to defend Chihuahua, Trias fled to Parras. Doniphan commented, \"The fire of our battery was so effective as to completely silence theirs.\" Doniphan's men marched into Chihuahua on March 2, and on April 23 he was ordered to bring his men to Saltillo, reaching Encantada on May 21.\nMexician sources One recurring phrase in oral retellings (recorded in interviews from the 1930s and 1940s) says:\n“Los americanos vinieron con sus carretas y se llevaron a sus muertos, más de doscientos, para darles sepultura cristiana cerca del río.”\n(“The Americans came with their wagons and took their dead — more than two hundred — to give them a Christian burial near the river.”)\nIn popular culture\nThe Battle of the Sacramento River is mentioned in the 1985 Western novel Blood Meridian. While interned in a Chihuahua City prison, the main character meets a veteran of the battle who recounts the events.\nSee also\n*Battles of the Mexican–American War\nGallery\nImage:Alexander William Doniphan.jpg|Colonel Alexander Doniphan\nFile:Sacramento map Doniphan.jpg|Doniphan's Map from John T.
