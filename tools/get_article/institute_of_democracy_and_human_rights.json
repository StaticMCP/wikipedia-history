The book got through  two editions. The foreword to the 2nd edition of the book was written by the first President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk and the reviewers were: Director of the Institute of National Security Problems of Ukraine, academician of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Gorbulin V.P. and Director of the Institute of Legislation of the Supreme Council (Verkhovna Rada) of Ukraine, corresponding member of the NAS of Ukraine  A. L. Kopylenko, the first rector of the Law Institute of the  Odesa I.I.Mechnikov state university, Doctor of Law, academician of the Academy of Law of Ukraine A. S. Vasilyev, as well as Doctor of law, professor I.V. Postica. This book was donated to the libraries of a number of the best universities of Ukraine and the world, as well as the largest national libraries of Ukraine, Russia, the USA, the UK and Israel.\nThe staff of the Institute (January 2011) individually addressed the ambassadors of all  Western  countries in Ukraine and a number of  the most famous international organizations concerned with the promotion of  human rights and put forward  the project of a national scale. The essence of the project was that several influential human rights organizations of Western countries would act as founders of the unified Ukrainian \"parent\" non-governmental organization on promotion of human rights (NGO), capable of ensuring in all the regions of Ukraine a rapid establishing, effective performance and reliable protection of an extensive network of \"affiliates\" of organizations of human rights promotion. It was supposed to involve decent, educated and motivated young lawyers selected on a competitive basis to carry out the mission of legal education and human rights protection  on the basis of a unified coordinated methodological, cultural and legal, information-legal policy on the part of the \"parent\" NGO. Thus, it was assumed to create on the basis of the above-mentioned network of human rights protection organizations an infrastructure of a civil society in Ukraine. However, the letter was responded to by only one Embassy (the Embassy of Switzerland in Ukraine), a human rights organization   from Australia  and  a mission of the Konrad Adenauer Fund  in Ukraine. All the other addressees left the appeal of the Institute  unanswered.\nMore than once the Institute team have given constitutional and legal conclusions at the request of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine.\nOn February 25, 2016 the Institute sent a written proposal to establish within  Odesa Regional State Administration the post of a Commissioner  on  Human Rights with the purpose of  organizing  legal education, formation of legal culture and creating  on the territory of the region a network of organizations to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms. The proposal was rejected.\nOn April 19, 2016 the Institute appealed to the Vice Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine issues, the Committee on European Integration of the Supreme Council (Verkhovna Rada) of Ukraine and Odesa mayor with a written proposal to establish on an experimental basis unilaterally  according to the international agreement concluded between the European Union and Ukraine, the legal regime of the EU in the city of Odesa, as the first stage of the European integration of Ukraine.\nOn November 8, 2017, the first President of Ukraine, L.M. Kravchuk, addressed the Ambassador of the Swiss Confederation in Ukraine with a request to assist the Institute in establishing contacts with Swiss colleagues with the aim of organizing cooperation in the integration of Ukraine into a unified European space. On February 12, 2018 the response of the Ambassador of the Swiss Confederation in Ukraine to the first President of Ukraine, L.M. Kravchuk was received.\nLegal education\nIn 2000 the Institute organized in the secondary schools of the city a discussion of the Draft of the Charter of the city of Odesa. High school students, who showed themselves in those debate, subsequently participated in television broadcasts dedicated to the discussion of Odesa Development Strategy.\nFrom 2003 to 2006 the Institute team acted as organizers and coordinators of the project \"Youth Council for Human Rights and Development of Civil Society\", which operated with the participation of law students and higher education institutions of Ukraine under the auspices of the Administration of the President of Ukraine, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, the National Institute for strategic studies under the President of Ukraine.\nThe most notable project of the Institute was a series of television programs (2011) with the participation of law students and Odesa universities dedicated to the constitutional and legal reform in Ukraine. The programs were broadcast on the satellite channel \"OK\" for several countries of the world. The first president of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk  addressed  the audience of the first transmission with an opening speech; the second programme was opened by the ex-speaker of the Parliament of Ukraine Alexander Moroz, the fourth  one – by the Chairman of the Central Election Committee of Ukraine V. Shapoval.\nLegal work\nA number of creative ideas, projects and concepts have been worked out in the process of the Institute activities, namely:\n* the idea of the organization of local self-government in the city of Odesa taking into account the original history of the city (the city of Odesa Charter project);\n* the idea of building a civil society in the country through  publication of a special constitutional law (the Draft Law of Ukraine \"On civil society in Ukraine\");\n* the idea of building a civil society in the country through  publication of a special constitutional law (the Draft Law of Ukraine \"On civil society in Ukraine\");\n* the concept of semi-presidential republic in Ukraine;\n* the draft of the Constitution of Ukraine  in the new edition;\n* the system of categories, explaining the essence of the established in Ukraine economic system, system of government  and  political system ( \"nomenclature oligarchy\", \"nomenclature privatization\", \"nomenclature capitalism\", \"nomenclature Law\", \"nomenclature rule of law\", \"quasi-state\", \"Ukrainian system \");\n* the concept of constitutional political science;\n* the concept of  fictitiousness of the state - \"quasi-state\";\n* the concept of \"the culture of dignity\";\n* the version of  confiscation of public property (national wealth)  hidden by  the euphemism of \"state property privatization\";\n* the concept of nationalization of unlawfully confiscated public property;\n* the concept of constitutionally- legal and judicial reforms in Ukraine;\n* the concept of decency as a source of Law;\n* the concept of the national idea.\nLinks\n* (Rus.)
