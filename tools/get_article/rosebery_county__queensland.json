Like all counties in Queensland, it is a non-functional administrative unit, that is used mainly for the purpose of registering land titles.\nThe county is divided into civil parishes.\nHistory\nCounty of Rosebery was traditional lands of the  Wongkanguru people, and the first pastoralists to the area were in the 1870s with the town of Birdsville founded in the early 1880s.\nThe seat of local government is in Bedourie, Queensland, having been in Birdsville till 1953. The Courthouse at Birdsville still operates.\nThe county came into being in March 1901, when the Queensland Governor issued a proclamation legally dividing Queensland into counties under the Land Act 1897.\nReferences"
