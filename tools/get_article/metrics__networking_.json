Router metrics help the router choose the best route among multiple feasible routes to a destination. The route will go in the direction of the gateway with the lowest metric.\nA router metric is typically based on information such as path length, bandwidth, load, hop count, path cost, delay, maximum transmission unit (MTU), reliability and communications cost.\nExamples\nA metric can include:\n* measuring link utilization (using SNMP)\n* number of hops (hop count)\n* speed of the path\n* packet loss (router congestion/conditions)\n* network delay\n* path reliability\n* path bandwidth\n* throughput [SNMP - query routers]\n* load\n* maximum transmission unit (MTU)\n* administrator configured value\nIn EIGRP, metrics is represented by an integer from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (The size of a 32-bit integer). In Microsoft Windows XP routing it ranges from 1 to 9999.\nA metric can be considered as:\n* additive - the total cost of a path is the sum of the costs of individual links along the path,\n* concave - the total cost of a path is the minimum of the costs of individual links along the path,\n* multiplicative - the total cost of a path is the product of the costs of individual links along the path.\nService level metrics\nRouter metrics are metrics used by a router to make routing decisions. It is typically one of many fields in a routing table.\nRouter metrics can contain any number of values that help the router determine the best route among multiple routes to a destination. A router metric is typically based on information like path length, bandwidth, load, hop count, path cost, delay, MTU, reliability and communications cost.\nSee also\n* Administrative distance, indicates the source of routing table entry and is used in preference to metrics for routing decisions\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://rainer.baumann.info/public/tik262.pdf Survey of routing metrics]"
