This time, the military campaign was successful. Among the participants was Shigai Khan, for whom this campaign became his last.\nFleeing persecution, Baba Sultan sought refuge with the Nogais. However, he soon devised a plot to kill the local murzas and seize their lands. His plans were uncovered, forcing him to flee once again. His next destination was Turkestan, where he aimed to resume the struggle for control over Tashkent.\nBattle\nIn the summer of 1582, Tauekel completely defeated Baba Sultan's army and personally delivered the fatal blow. As a symbol of victory, he severed his enemy's head and threw it at the feet of Abdallah Khan.\nEven before this, Tauekel had managed to capture Baba Sultan's brother, Tahir Sultan, whom Abdallah Khan's supporters had struggled to apprehend. Later, he also took Baba Sultan's son, Latif, prisoner. By the order of the Bukharan Khan, both were executed, crushing any remaining hopes of Baba Sultan's supporters for a return to power.\nMeaning\nIn 1582, he served at the court of the Uzbek ruler Abdallah Khan, accompanying him with his own detachment. In August 1582, as a reward for his merits, Abdallah Khan granted him control over the Afrinkent vilayet.\nReferences"
