Plays the boke.\nLife and career\nAkiyama and Baba have known each other since kindergarten, attending the same school from then to high school in their hometown of Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū. Akiyama moved to Tokyo after graduating high school with the initial goal of opening up a grocery store in Daikanyama. This changed as he instead enrolled in the Yoshimoto NSC and invited Baba to also enroll and move to Tokyo. The two of them formed the unit Akiyama-Baba, with Akiyama as the boke and Baba as the tsukkomi. However, the group struggled as Baba's role paled in comparison to Akiyama, and they determined that he was not fit to be a tsukkomi and invited Toshiyuki Itakura (Currently in the comedy duo, Impulse) to play the tsukkomi role. The three formed a trio called Zenairu, but was quickly disbanded soon after as Itakura preferred to play a boke role.\nYamamoto was in the same 4th generation class as Akiyama and Baba, but had formed a unit called Yamamoto Yamazaki, which disbanded after 2 months when his partner quit NSC. After other failed attempts at forming a unit, Yamamoto heard about the disbandment of Zenairu and approached Akiyama and Baba.\nThe three formed the trio in December 1998 and debuted the year after, making strides in their career with various television appearances in the 2000s. Akiyama in particular gained popularity, becoming a regular participant in the oogiri competition special program IPPON Grand Prix. In 2011, the trio won King of Conte.\nMedia\nThis list consists only of media appearances made by the trio when they appear together as Robert.\nCurrent regular programs\nTelevision\n*  (Kyushu Asahi) (2019&ndash;Present) 1st and 2nd Wednesdays\n*  (TBS TV) (2011&ndash;Present)\n*  (TV Asahi) (2004&ndash;Present) Semi-regular\n*  (TBS TV) (2014&ndash;Present)\nWeb series\n*  (AbemaTV) (2018&ndash;Present)\nMovies\n*Cromartie High – The Movie (2005)\nCommercials\n* Proto Corporation (2002-2003)\n* Takara (2004)\n* Hanjuku Hero (Square Enix, 2005)\n* uno (Shiseido, 2006)\n* Nissan (2006)\n* Qosimo (Toshiba, 2006)\n* Sanpo Foods (2008)\n* Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, Nintendo DS (Nintendo, 2008 - 2009)\n* Mizkan (2014)\n* Kapuriko (Ezaki Glico, 2015) - alongside Miru Shiroma (NMB48)\n* Gyu-Kaku (2016)\nVoice acting\n* Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea - Korean ver.
