The property was stocked with sheep, producing 68 bales of wool in 1892 and 71 in 1893.\nBlume sold Bexley in 1939 to T. Scanlan. Blume sold the  completely unstocked but retained the  Yanburra portion of the property for himself.\nThe area was flooded in 1950 and then a plague of snakes with 27 snakes being found in the homestead. In 1953 the property was owned by W. G. Allen and his wife and two sons.\nThe property, owned by the McPherson family, was deluged during a storm in 2001 when a total of  of rain fell during a single storm that lasted nearly 24 hours.\nIn 2011 the property was still owned by Ross and Michelle McPherson.\nSee also\n*List of ranches and stations\nReferences"
