His name comes from the Sanskrit word meaning “ocean.”\nCharacter\nSāgara is listed among the  and is one of sixteen that are spared from the assault of the garudas. His frequent inclusion of Sāgara among the several groups of protective deities in Buddhism is a direct reference to the nāgas and his role as one of their primary leaders. He is listed among the 28 guardians of the thousand-armed Avalokiteśvara.\nThe Avataṃsaka Sūtra reveals that he is the nāga that presides over the world's supply of rain.\nIn East Asian art, he is often depicted with a reddish white complexion and assumes a posture of great authority. In his left hand he holds a snake or dragon and in his right hand he wields a sword. He wears a crown that consists of five snakes.\nAo Guang is his Eastern Asian folklore appearance. He is also associated of the term Azure Dragon.\nUndersea Palace\nSāgara's palace lays at the bottom of the ocean and is the setting of several Mahayana sutras. It is 84,000 yojanas in length and width with an array of decorations that are seven-fold, including walls, banisters, jeweled nets and seven rows of trees. The palace is adorned with the seven treasures and is filled with the song of innumerable birds.\nLiterature\nKing Sāgara appears extensively throughout the Buddhist canon. His name often appears in enumerations of dragon kings that appear among Śākyamuni Buddha's audience. On other occasions, he is a central figure who participates in conversation with the Buddha and bodhisattvas and elucidates matters in the realm of the nāgas.\nLotus Sutra\nChapter 12 of the Lotus Sutra contains the well-known episode of Sāgara's daughter, known simply as nāgakanya (\"nāga maiden\"), whose transformation allows her to procure the male body of a bodhisattva, followed by becoming a fully enlightened Buddha.\nThis event was preceded by Mañjuśrī's visit to Sāgara's ocean palace, where he taught the Lotus Sutra to the nāgas.\nLalitavistara Sūtra\nSāgara makes a few appearances in the Lalitavistara Sūtra. He is one among six nāga kings who make the aspiration to venerate the bodhisattva Siddhārtha with clouds and rain of sandalwood powder.\nWhen Siddhārtha discarded the golden bowl provided by Sujātā, Sāgara took it from the bottom of the Nairañjanā River and later gave it to Śakra to be enshrined among the gods in Trāyastriṃśa.\nTowards the end of the story, the Buddha is described as having a rumbling voice like that of one of Sāgara's thunderclouds.\nSutra on the Questions of the Nāga King Sāgara\nThree extant versions of this sutra exist in both the Tibetan Kangyur and the Taishō Tripiṭaka (T0598, T0599 and T0601). Known in Sanskrit as the Sāgaranāgarājaparipṛcchā Sūtra, all three texts are vastly different from each other regarding their content.\nThe shortest text opens with the Buddha residing in Sāgara's ocean palace accompanied by an audience of 1,250 monks. The Buddha addresses Sāgara and teaches him that speaking the Four Dharma Seals is synonymous with speaking the 84,000 methods of teaching the Dharma.\nAs Ao Guang\nIn the cosmological Dragon Kings of the Four Seas and cardinal directions, Ao Guang is the Eastern Sea Dragon King or also known as the Azure dragon of the east.\nIn the East Asian Folk cultures, Ao Guang appears in various work of arts and literature. In One of the folk tales, the Four Dragon Kings were punished by the Jade Emperor for defying the Heavenly court and bringing rain on Earth without permission during the times of drought.\nIn the Complete Tale of Avalokiteśvara and the Southern Seas, his third son was accidentally captured by the fisherman and he pleads Avalokiteśvara for help. Avalokiteśvara saves the third dragon prince and also takes Ao Guang's daughter, Longnü/Naga Kanya as his disciple.\nIn the myth of The Eight Immortals Cross the Sea, Ao Guang's eldest two sons were killed by the immortals.\nIn Fengshen Yanyi, Ao Guang's third son, Ao Bing meets a tragic end with his friend Nezha. In grief, Ao Guang pleads for justice from the heavens; as a result, Nezha willingly commits suicide after realizing his mistake.\nIn Journey to the West, the Great Sage Monkey King causes a grave disturbance in the underwater palace; through the circumstances, Ao Guang is forced to show Sun Wukong the treasure of the Four Seas,  from where Sun Wukong took the Ruyi Jingu Bang and a set of royal attire—including a phoenix-feather cap, golden chain mail, and cloud-walking boots.\nSee also\n*[[Nagaraja\n*Longnü\n*Dragon King\n*Ao Guang\n*Azure Dragon\n*Ao Bing\n*Ao Run\nReferences"
