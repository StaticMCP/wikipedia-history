They were ultimately victorious, taking Banić prisoner after the battle. However, the infant Ladislas' mother, Elisabeth of Bohemia, died the following year, forcing Ulrich II to recognize Vladislaus III as king as well as release all prisoners. Vladislaus III died soon after in the Battle of Varna against the Ottoman Empire.\nOn March 1, 2006, the 565th anniversary of the battle, the city of Samobor hosted a large reenactment of the event.\nReferences\n*[http://www.vojska.net/eng/history/battle/samobor-1441/ Battle of Samobor 1441 at Vojska.net]"
