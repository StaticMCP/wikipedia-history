The show was produced by Atlantis Films in association with Disney Channel and Buena Vista International, Inc.\nFlash Forward was the first series branded under the \"Disney Channel Original Series\" label.\nCharacters\nTuck James\nTucker \"Tuck\" James (Ben Foster) is a 13-year-old boy who has just started eighth grade and sees it as a life-altering event. Tucker faces the travails of a teen's life with his trademark humor and rebounds from the fouls dealt by bullies and the occasional intruding parent by seeking solace in his friendship with Miles. He and Becca have been best friends since they were born and remain committed to each other through thick and thin.\n* Tucker (age 5) is played by Marc Donato.\nBecca Fisher\nRebecca \"Becca\" Fisher (Jewel Staite), also 13, is the much-flustered best friend of Tucker and is experiencing the same disillusionment with eighth grade. Her new best friend is Christine, someone who Becca sees as an easier person than Tucker to confide in about the things that are starting to matter (namely boys). Becca also faces ridicule from her bossy and stuck-up sister Ellen and carries a secret crush on the local pizza maker, Gooch.\n* Becca (age 5) is played by Jennifer Pisana.\nMiles Vaughn\nMiles (Theodore Borders) is Tucker's new best friend and starts the eighth grade year off as his constant companion. He often acts as the voice of reason in his relationship with Tucker, often bringing Tucker back down to the ground when he allows his flights of fancy to get the better of him.\nChris Harrison\nChristine \"Chris\" Harrison (Asia Vieira) is Becca's new best friend and often finds herself in the middle of Becca's schemes and troubles. She serves as a source of companionship and most importantly a listener, someone Becca can confide in during their ever-changing world. Christine is the owner of the dubiously named Steve, a dog.\nHorace James\nHorace (Ricky Mabe) is Tucker's long-suffering younger brother. He is often the butt of Tucker's jokes and pranks, but holds a great deal of respect for his older brother. He is known for capturing all on his video camera, sometimes using the footage to his advantage as blackmail against Tucker.\nEllen Fisher\nPlayed by both Rachel Blanchard (ep. 1–4) and Robin Brûlé, Ellen is Becca's domineering, self-centered older sister. She has no real respect for anyone other than herself and (arguably) her boyfriend Ryan. Ellen is often a source of pain and discomfort for her younger sister.\nEpisodes\n|ShortSummary    = It's the first day of school and there are let downs (and drop downs - of Tucker's clothing).\n|LineColor       = 00FFFF\n}}\n|ShortSummary=Becca petitions for Christine to be allowed to wrestle, while Tucker mocks the idea of girls wrestling, and a wrestling contest between Christine and his rival, Jack.\n|LineColor=00FFFF\n}}\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|ShortSummary=After Kerry manipulates Tucker into giving her a concert ticket intended for Becca, Tucker tries to find a way to obtain and pay for another ticket, which involves him manipulating a few people himself.\n|LineColor=00FFFF\n}}\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|ShortSummary=Tucker volunteers to look after the fake baby he and Becca are assigned so that Becca will babysit Horace in return, while Christine prepares to get Steve neutered.
