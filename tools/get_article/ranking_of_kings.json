It has been serialized on Echoes' user-submitted Manga Hack website since May 2017 and has been collected in 20  volumes by Enterbrain. The story follows the adventures of a little prince named Bojji, who was born deaf and tiny in size, and his friend Kage, a survivor of a wiped-out assassin clan, who understands Bojji's words despite him being unable to speak.\nAn anime television series adaptation produced by Wit Studio aired from October 2021 to March 2022 on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block. The spin-off series Ranking of Kings: The Treasure Chest of Courage aired from April to June 2023.\nAn anime film adaptation has been announced.\nSynopsis\nSetting\nThe title of the series refers to a same-named system by which a committee, acting in absentia for a race of powerful magical beings known as 'Gods', ranks the power and prosperity of the mortal world's many kings. The king that is bequeathed the number one ranking is entitled to a boon from the 'Divine Treasure Vault', a fabled stronghold brimming with untold riches and holy artifacts. While not all kings seek this power in earnest, the existence of the ranking and the ambitions of those who strive to sit atop it form the driving force of the narrative.\nPlot\nThe story is about a little prince named Bojji who is deaf but above all naive, despite many criticisms from his people about his ascension to the throne, he does his best and dreams of becoming the greatest of kings. One day, he meets Kage (Shadow), a survivor of a wiped-out assassin clan, who understands his words despite Bojji being unable to speak due to his disability. The story follows the pair as they navigate the world and all of its adventures and darkness.\nThe inciting incident of the series' first arc is the death of Bojji's father, King Bosse, a legendary giant warrior who, in his prime, was widely renowned as the strongest man in the world. While Bojji's right to succession is affirmed by Bosse on his deathbed, there are those among the royal court that believe that Bojji's physical shortcomings make him unfit to rule and that his arrogant (but physically capable) younger half-brother, Prince Daida, is more suited for ascension. Chief among these dissenters is Bosse's widow and Daida's mother, Queen Hiling, who calls for a vote to circumvent Bosse's will and forgo Bojji's right to succession. The vote is passed and Daida is placed upon the throne.\nHaving been denied his birthright, Bojji requests he be allowed to undertake a journey so that he may gain experience and grow stronger. Hiling, who once had great affection for Bojji and regarded him as her own son, begrudgingly acquiesces. Unbeknownst to both of them, Daida, under the influence of an enigmatic figure, has set in motion a sinister plot to consolidate his power and achieve the position of number one in the Ranking of Kings.\nCharacters\n;\n:}}\n:The main protagonist of the story and the first prince of the Kingdom of Bosse. Born deaf and tiny in size, he was ridiculed and scorned openly by many within the palace and kingdom. Despite his disability, Bojji dreams of becoming a strong king like his father and always tries to maintain a smile in front of others. He is known for his kindness (which has earned him many unexpected allies), diligence, and intuition, which allows him to read lips and know what people are saying. He also possesses extreme agility and dodging ability unconventional for kings that tend to rely on strength, and like all members of his race is impervious to poison. Following Daida's coronation, he and Kage set off on a journey.\n:His name is a portmanteau of two Japanese words \"Bocchi\" (lonely) and \"Ōji\" (prince).\n;\n:\n:A last surviving member of the shadow clan and Bojji's companion. Born to a clan of assassins, Kage was a young child when he witnessed his entire family murdered by the kingdom they served. He subsequently escaped and was exploited by a thug, who eventually sold him out for his ransom. Tempered by the rough way of the world, Kage then grew up using his clan's abilities to make a living off thieving. He eventually meets Bojji and is touched by his kindness and his situation, pledging to be his faithful friend. He is tasked by Bebin to follow and protect Bojji on their journey.\n:\"Kage\" in Japanese means \"shadow\".\n;\n:|Justin Briner}}\n:An expressionless commander dubbed \"Spear of the King\" who is heavily loyal to King Bosse. Once a cowardly man, he trained with monsters under the supervision of Miranjo and earned his current title. He worked with the Magic Mirror to transfer Bosse's consciousness to Daida's body.\n:His name is an anagram of the Japanese pronunciation of the word \"Spear\".\n;\n:\n:A large man dubbed \"Shield of the Queen\" who guards Hiling. He originally served King Bosse as 'King's Spear', but was later reassigned to guard the new queen, Hiling. Initially, he was upset by the decision but later was given the opportunity to decide whether or not Hiling was worth his protection, answering in the affirmative.\n:His name is an anagram of the Japanese pronunciation of the word \"Shield\".\n;\n:\n:A low-ranking knight who deeply cares for Bojji after the latter comforted him upon his mother's death. He was ordered to accompany Bojji on his journey and look after his personal care, being the only knight that knew sign language. After Domas' betrayal, his pride as a knight and loyalty to Bojji compel him to return to the kingdom, risking his life to inform Hiling of the news. He is rescued by Domas just before his execution and undergoes training to become stronger.\n:His name means \"face mole\" in Japanese.\n;\n:\n:The former king and father of Bojji and Daida. He was a giant who yearned to be the strongest man in the world and made a deal with a demon, choosing to steal power from his very own son. Feeling remorseful later, Bosse chose to become king and establish a country to ensure Bojji had everything he ever wanted in life. He is subsequently reincarnated in Daida's body.\n:His name is from the English word \"Boss\".\n;\n:\n:Bosse's first wife and subsequent First Queen of the Bosse Kingdom, and Bojji's birth mother. She was killed by Miranjo when Bojji was young.\n;\n:\n:A mysterious mirror who advises Daida on his actions. Sealed within is actually the spirit of a woman named Miranjo, whose body is encased in ice within the palace's basement alongside various other deadly monsters. Miranjo has two masked guards who serve her and was previously involved in Apeas' training to become a high-ranking official. She describes herself as \"someone who shared the joys and sorrows of [King Bosse]\", later creating an elixir for Daida to become a vessel for reincarnation. Was later revealed to be the childhood friend of the devil but had an unwilling hand in what it became today. She is then devoured by the devil but is saved and forgiven by Daida after the latter learned the truth of her life.\n;\n:\n:The king of the Underworld and commander of the Order of the Underworld – the most powerful legion of soldiers that slaughter demons and prevent them from wreaking havoc. He has a complex about his face and wide mouth and dislikes his younger brother Despa due to his good looks. However, it does not stop both of them working together in some situations.\n:His name is an anagram of the name of god Hades from Greek mythology.\n;\n:\n:The younger brother of Desha and Despa and former commander of the Order of the Underworld. He once was a kind-hearted prince who swore to found an order of knights that shared his values. He also holds the title of 'Sword King of The Underworld' due to his master skills in swordsmanship. After unwillingly receiving true immortality, an ability that also slowly consumed his humanity, he became a remorseless monster that inflicts pain on his victims.\n:Due to his madness, both of his brothers have no choice other than to imprison him in the Underworld, where he remained until freed by Miranjo to conquer the Bosse Kingdom.\n:His name is an anagram of the Japanese word \"Ken-ō\" (means \"Sword King\").\n;\n:\n:The middle brother of the king of the Underworld and Ōken. Unlike his older brother, Despa is much weaker, vainer and money-minded. He takes Bojji and Kage into his care and promises to train Bojji up to become stronger (for a price).\n; Devil\n: An unknown creature that came out of Bosse's mouth after the king's death. He is known to grant wishes at a certain price and does so at the detriment of others. Originally a kind, childlike entity who befriended Miranjo, he became a monstrous, sadistic and nearly immortal creature. It is said from an old prophecy that Bojji is fated to kill the Devil, but given the presence of others, it is not known if this devil is the devil that was mentioned.\nMedia\nManga\nRanking of Kings is written and illustrated by .
