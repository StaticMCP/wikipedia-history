Its headquarters was located at Vittorio Veneto from 10 November 1917 until the army was disbanded on 22 January 1918. The 14th Army served on the Italian Front throughout its existence.\nHistory\nThe Battle of Caporetto October/November 1917\nAfter the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo, the Austro-Hungarians were exhausted and could not have withstood another attack. They appealed to the Germans for help and the Germans, fearing a collapse on the Italian Front, sent 7 divisions, 540 guns, 216 mortars and about 100 aircraft from the Western and Eastern Fronts.  To control these troops, a new 14th Army under General der Infanterie Otto von Below was concentrated between Tolmin and Bovec. For the Battle of Caporetto a number of Austro-Hungarian divisions were added.\nFollowing the successful offensive, the front soon froze again in trench warfare. The German High Command decided to withdraw its forces again to use on other fronts.  On 23 January 1918 the Army Command was recalled (to form a new 17th Army on the Western Front). The German troops remaining on the Italian front came under the command of 51st Corps until it was withdrawn in February 1918.\nOutline Order of Battle, Battle of Caporetto\nUnits are German unless designated as Austria-Hungary.\n{| style=\"float: right;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-size: 100%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:grey; color:black;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Organization of the 14th Army on 24 October 1917\n|-\n|- style=\"background-color:grey; color:black;\"\n!
