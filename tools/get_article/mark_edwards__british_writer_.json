His books have sold over four million copies and been translated into 12 languages. Edwards has written over a dozen thrillers since his 2013 solo debut, The Magpies, and his 2022 novel No Place to Run made it into the top ten Kindle chart. He has co-authored six books with Louise Voss.\nEarly years\nEdwards was born in Kent, England, on 4 November 1970. He grew up in Hastings, East Sussex, where he attended Rye College. He graduated from Staffordshire University in 1993, with a degree in sociology. While pursuing a career as a writer, Edwards worked for the civil service and did customer service for a rail franchise, and eventually a London-based book publisher. He also had a stint as an English teacher in Tokyo, Japan, while pursuing his first publishing deal.\nCareer\nIn 1999, Edwards appeared in the BBC documentary Close Up: First Writes, which followed three writers, including Jake Arnott, at the start of their writing careers. In 2011, he self-published two novels co-authored with Louise Voss, Killing Cupid and Catch Your Death. This led to a four-book deal with HarperCollins. In 2013, Edwards published his debut solo novel, The Magpies, which reached number one and led to a deal with Thomas & Mercer, part of Amazon Publishing. His 2019 novel Here to Stay received positive reviews, including one from critic Natasha Cooper, who said, \"Mark Edwards has sold millions of copies of his domestic suspense novels. On the evidence of Here to Stay, his latest, it is not hard to see why.\"\nSelf publishing\nWhen Amazon launched its ebook reader, the Kindle, in Britain in 2010, Edwards joined an emerging group of writers who had success self-publishing their work. Edwards and Voss released their first novel, Killing Cupid, on Kindle Direct Publishing, which eventually climbed to the top 100 on the Kindle charts. That same year, the pair published Catch your Death. This earned them TV appearances and a four-book deal with HarperCollins. During an interview with The Guardian in 2013, Edwards said self-publishing on Amazon can be advantageous for emerging writers who don't yet have publishers but are ready to seek out a wider audience. In 2024, Penguin Michael Joseph (PMJ) bought Edwards' thriller The Wasp Trap, the author's first solo traditional publishing deal.\nInfluences\nEdwards has said he is a fan of American authors such as Stephen King, who have shaped the kind of stories he likes to tell: \"Extraordinary, often scary, things happening to ordinary people.\" The works of both Harlan Coben and Linwood Barclay influenced Edwards when he wrote No Place to Run.\nPersonal life\nEdwards lives in Wolverhampton with his wife and their children.\nNovels\nwith Louise Voss\n* Killing Cupid (2012)\n* Catch Your Death (Kate Maddox Book 1) (2012)\n* All Fall Down (Kate Maddox Book 2) (2012)\n* Forward Slash (2013)\n* From the Cradle (Detective Patrick Lennon Book 1) (2014)\n* The Blissfully Dead (Detective Patrick Lennon Book 2) (2015)\n* \"One Shot (Detective Patrick Lennon Book 2.5)\" (short, 2015)\nSolo\n* The Magpies (#1) (2013)\n* What You Wish For (2014)\n* Because She Loves Me (2014)\n* Follow You Home (2015)\n* ''The Devil's Work (2016)\n* The Lucky Ones (2017)\n* A Murder of Magpies (2018)\n* The Retreat (2018)\n* In Her Shadow (2018)\n* Last of the Magpies (2019)\n* Here to Stay (2019)\n* The House Guest (2020)\n* The Hollows (2021)\n* No Place to Run (2022)\n* Keep Her Secret (2023)\n* The Darkest Water (2024)\n* The Psychopath Next Door  (2025)\n* The Wasp Trap'' (forthcoming, 2025)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
