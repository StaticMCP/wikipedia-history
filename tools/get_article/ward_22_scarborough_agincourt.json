It's represented on Toronto City Council by Nick Mantas. It covers the area of the City of Toronto bounded by  Steeles Avenue East to the north, Highway 401 to the south, Victoria Park Avenue to the west, and Midland Avenue to the east. It contains the neighbourhoods of L'Amoreaux, Tam O'Shanter and part of Agincourt.\nHistory\nToronto municipal ward boundaries were significantly modified in 2018, passing through three models (44-ward, 47-ward, and 25-ward). Ultimately, for the purposes of administering the 2018 election, the 25-ward structure was used and later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2021.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the City of Toronto engaged in a ward boundary review evaluating the city's previous 44-ward model.\nBased on this, and in preparation for the 2018 municipal election, the City of Toronto added 3 new wards to  create a 47-ward model.  This model was in effect at the opening of the 2018 municipal election.\nThe 2018 Toronto municipal election ran from May 1, 2018, to October 22, 2018, and while underway the provincial government introduced the Better Local Government Act, 2018, S.O. 2018, c. 11 - Bill 5. The act was assented to on August 14, 2018.\nThe immediate effect of this act was to eliminate all previous ward models, and replace them with a 25-ward model designed to align with the provincial and federal ridings boundaries in effect at that time.\nThe timing of the boundary change was controversial, and the City of Toronto sued the province contesting the provisions' constitutionality. In the absence of an injunction, and with the pending threat of the province invoking the notwithstanding clause which would defeat any constitutional challenge, the election continued under the 25-ward model.\nThe nomination period originally scheduled to close on July 27, 2018, was extended to September 14, 2018. This allowed new candidates to run, and existing candidates to either withdraw or to reassign their candidacy to a different constituency.\nIn a judgment rendered October 1, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of the provisions, and the 25-ward model remained in effect for the 2022 Toronto municipal election.\nFrom 2000 to 2018, Scarborough—Agincourt was represented on city council by Wards 39 (northern half) and 40 (southern half). From 1998 to 2000 Scarborough—Agincourt was represented on city council by Ward 17, and returned two members. From 1988 to 1997 Scarborough—Agincourt was represented on Metropolitan Toronto Council until Scarborough's amalgamation into the city.\nElection results\n2022 Toronto municipal election\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ddf; width:200px;\"| Candidate\n! style=\"background:#ddf; width:50px;\"| Vote\n! style=\"background:#ddf; width:30px;\"| %\n|-\n|Nick Mantas || 8,228 || 48.89\n|-\n|Bill Wu|| 3,153 || 18.73\n|-\n|Antonios Mantas || 1,841 || 10.94\n|-\n|Roland Lin || 1,549 || 9.20\n|-\n|Serge Khatchadourian || 1,383 || 8.22\n|-\n|Anthony Internicola || 677 || 4.02\n|}\n2021 by-election\nA by-election was held on January 15, 2021 to replace Jim Karygiannis who was removed from city council after losing an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada due to exceeding spending limits in the 2018 election.\nIn addition to in-person voting, this was the first municipal election in Toronto to offer a mail-in ballot.
