McEwan was suspended and ultimately resigned after an argument with the team's trainer, Bart Sullivan, during Holy Cross's loss to Brown on November 5. Bunny Corcoran served as the team's interim head coach for the final three games of the season. Holy Cross finished the year with an overall record of 6–2–2. The Crusaders played their home games at Fitton Field in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|W 13-6||\n|October 1|2:30 p.m.||Providence|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|W 26-6||\n|October 8|2:00 p.m.||Maine|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|W 32-6||\n|October 15|||Detroit|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|W 9-7||\n|October 22||at|Rutgers|Neilson Field|New Brunswick, NJ|W 6-0||\n|October 29|2:00 p.m.||Catholic University|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|W 8-0||\n|November 5||at|Brown|Brown Stadium|Providence, RI|L 7-10|20,000|\n|November 12|2:00 p.m.|at|Harvard|Harvard Stadium|Boston, MA|L 0-7||\n|November 19||at|Manhattan|Yankee Stadium|Bronx, NY|T 0-0|8,000|\n|November 26|1:45 p.m.||Boston College|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|T 0-0||\n}}\nReferences"
