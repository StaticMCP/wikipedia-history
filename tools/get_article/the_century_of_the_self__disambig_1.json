It focuses on the work of psychoanalysts Sigmund Freud and Anna Freud, and PR consultant Edward Bernays. In episode one, Curtis says, \"This series is about how those in power have used Freud's theories to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy.\"\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!No\n!Title\n!Broadcast Date\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|\"Happiness Machines\"\n|17 March 2002\n|\n|-\n|2\n|\"The Engineering of Consent\"\n|24 March 2002\n|\n|-\n|3\n|\"There is a Policeman Inside All Our Heads; He Must Be Destroyed\"\n|31 March 2002\n|\n|-\n|4\n|\"Eight People Sipping Wine in Kettering\"\n|7 April 2002\n|\n|}\nOverview\nSigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, changed our perception of the mind and its workings. The documentary explores the various ways that governments, global organizations and corporations have used Freud's theories. Freud and his nephew Edward Bernays, who was the first to use psychological techniques in public relations, are discussed in part one. His daughter Anna Freud, a pioneer of child psychoanalysis, is mentioned in part two. Wilhelm Reich, an opponent of Freud's theories, is discussed in part three.\n| width = 20% | align = left}}\nAlong these lines, The Century of the Self asks deeper questions about the roots and methods of consumerism and commodification and their implications. It also questions the modern way people see themselves, the attitudes to fashion, and superficiality.\nThe business and political worlds use psychological techniques to read, create and fulfill the desires of the public, and to make their products and speeches as pleasing as possible to consumers and voters. Curtis questions the intentions and origins of this relatively new approach to engaging the public.\nWhere once the political process was about engaging people's rational, conscious minds, as well as facilitating their needs as a group, Stuart Ewen, a historian of public relations, argues that politicians now appeal to primitive impulses that have little bearing on issues outside the narrow self-interests of a consumer society.\nThe words of Paul Mazur, a leading Wall Street banker working for Lehman Brothers in 1927, are cited: \"We must shift America from a needs- to a desires-culture. People must be trained to desire, to want new things, even before the old have been entirely consumed. [...] Man's desires must overshadow his needs.\"\nIn part four the main subjects are Philip Gould, a political strategist, and Matthew Freud, a PR consultant and the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud. In the 1990s, they were instrumental to bringing the Democratic Party in the US and New Labour in the United Kingdom back into power through use of the focus group, originally invented by psychoanalysts employed by US corporations to allow consumers to express their feelings and needs, just as patients do in psychotherapy.\nCurtis ends by saying that, \"Although we feel we are free, in reality, we—like the politicians—have become the slaves of our own desires,\" and compares Britain and America to 'Democracity', an exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair created by Edward Bernays.\nContributors\n* Countess Erzie Károlyi\n* Edward Bernays (interviewed 1991)\n* Pat Jackson, PR adviser and colleague of Edward Bernays\n* Peter Strauss, employee of Edward Bernays 1948–52\n*
