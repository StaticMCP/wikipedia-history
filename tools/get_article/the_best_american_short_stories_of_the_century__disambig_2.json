It consists of 55 stories from 1915 to 1998. The volume was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.\nBackground\nThe series is considered one of the \"best-known annual anthologies of short fiction\" and has anthologized more than 2,000 short stories, including works by some of the most famous writers in contemporary American literature, curated by well-known guest editors since 1915.\nIn particular, the Willa Cather Review wrote that The Best American Short Stories series \"became a repository of values\" for creative writing programs, college libraries, and literary magazines.\nCritical reception\nIn a starred review, Publishers Weekly stated that \"Life on this continent may be brutal, but this extraordinary collection offers up dazzling writing that salves the wounds, as well as stories full of the pleasures of life.\"\nThe New York Times stated that \"Updike has made some surprising—even striking—selections, and in consequence this collection seems far less predictable than it might have been\" and that \"Finding wonderful stories that you don't already know is one of this collection's great pleasures.\"\nThe Observer noted Updike's curation based not in national themes but rather human sentimentality, stating that \"The result is a most interesting mix of good and great, of obscure writers and much-anthologized classics, of literary curios and polished diamonds... In sum, this is a terrific collection that ought to be read by anyone interested in good writing or curious about the 20th-century American social scene.\"\nShort stories included\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Author\n!Story\n!Source\n|-\n|1915\n|Benjamin Rosenblatt\n|\"Zelig\"\n|The Bellman\n|-\n|1916\n|Mary Lerner\n|\"Little Selves\"\n|The Atlantic Monthly\n|-\n|1917\n|Susan Glaspell\n|\"A Jury of Her Peers\"\n|Every Week Magazine\n|-\n|1920\n|Sherwood Anderson\n|\"The Other Woman\"\n|The Triumph of the Egg\n|-\n|1922\n|Ring Lardner\n|\"The Golden Honeymoon\"\n|Cosmopolitan\n|-\n|1923\n|Jean Toomer\n|\"Blood-Burning Moon\"\n|Prairie\n|-\n|1927\n|Ernest Hemingway\n|\"The Killers\"\n|''Scribner's Magazine\n|-\n|1929\n|Willa Cather\n|\"Double Birthday\"\n|The Forum\n|-\n|1929\n|Grace Stone Coates\n|\"Wild Plums\"\n|The Frontier\n|-\n|1930\n|Katherine Anne Porter\n|\"Theft\"\n|The Gyroscope\n|-\n|1931\n|William Faulkner\n|\"That Evening Sun Go Down\"\n|The American Mercury\n|-\n|1931\n|Dorothy Parker\n|\"Here We Are\"\n|Cosmopolitan\n|-\n|1933\n|F.
