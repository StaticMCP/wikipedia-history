Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Mali accepted the convention on April 5, 1977, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Mali has four World Heritage Sites, however, because of the instability in the country, three of them are listed in the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger. Mali has served on the World Heritage Committee twice.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\nIn danger|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"|Old Towns of Djenné\n|\n|Mopti Region\n|1988\n| 116rev; iii, iv (cultural)\n|Inhabited since 250 B.C., Djenné became a market centre and an important link in the trans-Saharan gold trade. In the 15th and 16th centuries, it was one of the centres for the propagation of Islam. Its traditional houses, of which nearly 2,000 have survived, are built on hillocks (toguere) as protection from the seasonal floods.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"|Timbuktu\n|\n|Tomboctou Region\n|1988\n| 119rev; ii, iv, v (cultural)\n|Home of the prestigious Koranic Sankore University and other madrasas, Timbuktu was an intellectual and spiritual capital and a centre for the propagation of Islam throughout Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries. Its three great mosques, Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia, recall Timbuktu's golden age. Although continuously restored, these monuments are today under threat from desertification.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Cliff of Bandiagara (Land of the Dogons)\n|\n|Mopti Region\n|1989\n| 516; v, vii (mixed)\n|The Bandiagara site is an outstanding landscape of cliffs and sandy plateaux with some beautiful architecture (houses, granaries, altars, sanctuaries and Togu Na, or communal meeting-places). Several age-old social traditions live on in the region (masks, feasts, rituals, and ceremonies involving ancestor worship). The geological, archaeological and ethnological interest, together with the landscape, make the Bandiagara plateau one of West Africa's most impressive sites.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"|Tomb of Askia\n|\n|Gao Region\n|2004\n| 1139; ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n|The dramatic 17-m pyramidal structure of the Tomb of Askia was built by Askia Mohamed, the Emperor of Songhai, in 1495 in his capital Gao. It bears testimony to the power and riches of the empire that flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries through its control of the trans-Saharan trade, notably in salt and gold. It is also a fine example of the monumental mud-building traditions of the West African Sahel. The complex, including the pyramidal tomb, two flat-roofed mosque buildings, the mosque cemetery and the open-air assembly ground, was built when Gao became the capital of the Songhai Empire and after Askia Mohamed had returned from Mecca and made Islam the official religion of the empire.\n|}\nTentative List\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , Mali has listed fifteen properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Boucle du Baoulé\n|\n|Kayes Region, Koulikoro Region\n| align=\"center\" |1999\n| ii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Es-Souk\n|\n|Kidal Region\n| align=\"center\" |1999\n| ii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Hamdullahi Historic City\n|\n|Mopti Region\n| align=\"center\" |2009\n| i, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Médine Fort\n|\n|Kayes Region\n| align=\"center\" |2009\n| iii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Great Friday Mosque of Niono\n|\n|Ségou Region\n| align=\"center\" |2009\n| iii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Komoguel Mosque\n|\n|Mopti Region\n| align=\"center\" |2009\n| iii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Tata of Sikasso\n|\n|Sikasso Region\n| align=\"center\" |2009\n| i, ii, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Biosphere Reserve of Bafing Makana Park\n|\n|Kayes Region\n| align=\"center\" |2016\n| viii, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Lac Magui Nature Reserve\n|\n|Kayes Region\n| align=\"center\" |2016\n| viii, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Gourma Elephant Biodiversity Reserve\n|\n|Tomboctou Region\n| align=\"center\" |2017\n| viii, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Niger River Basin (from the Markala threshold to Lake Débo)\n|\n| Mopti Region, Ségou Region, Tomboctou Region\n| align=\"center\" |2017\n| viii, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Bamako Cathedral\n|\n|Bamako Region\n| align=\"center\" |2017\n| ii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Mandiakuy Church\n|\n|Ségou Region\n| align=\"center\" |2017\n| ii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Historical Sites and Cultural Landscapes of Manden\n|\n|Koulikoro Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n| ii, iv, x (mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Mosque of Kankou Moussa in Gao\n|\n|Gao Region\n| align=\"center\" |2021\n| ii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
