      "text": "# The Indian Queen (opera)\n\n, c. 1695\n| librettist =\n| based_on = The Indian Queen (play) by Sir Robert Howard\n| premiere_date = 1695\n| premiere_location = Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London\n}}\nThe Indian Queen (Z. 630) is a largely unfinished semi-opera with music by Henry Purcell. It was first performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, in 1695. The exact date is unknown, but Peter Holman estimates it may have been in June.\nIt was created as a revised version of the 1664 play The Indian Queen, in a prologue and five act form by John Dryden and his brother-in-law Sir Robert Howard. In 1694, Thomas Betterton was given £50 to transform the play into an opera, and he commissioned Purcell to compose the music. Purcell, who died in November 1695, left music only for the Prologue and Acts II and III. His brother Daniel completed a masque for Act V.\nThe Indian Queen is one of Purcell's less often performed stage works. This is probably more a reflection of the incomplete state of the score than of its quality.\nCommission and première\nThe Indian Queen was commissioned by the United Company. The managers, struggling with discontented actors who were threatening to leave, and advised by Lord Chamberlain, a theater monitor, asked Sir Robert Howard to revise his earlier 1664 play with added music by Henry Purcell. Howard however would support the actors to leave before the première, and the actors were successful in doing so, creating their own company. This caused the United Company to première The Indian Queen with amateur actors and to commission additional music from Purcell.  The semi-opera would première with some success, but other than a brief revival with added music by Purcell's brother, Daniel, would quickly be forgotten from regular production.\nSellars' 2013 production\nThe 2013 director Peter Sellars led a production of the Indian Queen with the Tchaikovsky Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre (Perm), Teatro Real (Madrid), and English National Opera (London). Sellars rewrote Howards and Dryden's plot to tell the story of the Spanish Conquista. Sellers drew on a book by the Nicaraguan writer Rosario Aguilar.  Stage design was done by American Artist Gronk drawing on Mayan markings. The production received mixed responses from spectators. About these responses Sellars said, “[the spectators] don’t understand that a work like this is about trying to complete a journey together through difficult issues and history.”\nCharacters\n* Indian Boy and Girl\n* King Inca\n* Zempoalla, queen of the Aztecs\n* Montezuma, general of Peru (based on Moctezuma II)\n* Orazia, daughter of Inca\n* Acacis, prince of the Aztecs\n* Traxalla, general of Aztecs\n* Hymen (based on Hymen (god))\n* Ismeron, an Aztec conjurour\n* Amexia, queen  of Mexico\n* Garucca, high priest\n* Envy\n* Fame\n* God of dreams\n* follower of Hymen\n* follower of Envy\n* follower of Cupid\nSynopsis\nSome years before the Spanish Conquest in Mesoamerica—a war began between the Inca and the Aztecs.\nPrologue\nThe prologue opens with two children discussing the Inca conquest of the Aztecs.\nAct I\nMontezuma, a young warrior, leads the Inca army in battle capturing Acais, the son of the mexican queen, Zempoalla.

Montezuma then kills Traxalla.\nIn a shocking twist, Amexia arrives and is revealed as the rightful Queen of the Aztecs.

Zempoalla, now completely distraught, reveals a dagger and stabs herself, taking her own life in grief.\nNow satisfied, King Inca gives Montezuma a blessing to marry.
