Built in 1790, it is a remnant of the first paper mill to be built on the banks of the Charles River.  The -story stone building was built by John Ware, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, and was used for paper production until 1938.  A brick addition was added to the rear of the building in the 19th century; its interior was effectively stripped in the 1973.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts\nReferences"
