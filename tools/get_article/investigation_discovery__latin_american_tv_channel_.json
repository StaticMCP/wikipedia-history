Discovery.\nHistory\nThe channel was launched in October 1997 as the local version of Travel Channel. After the purchase by Discovery Inc. and the BBC, the channel was then renamed \"El Nuevo / O Novo Travel Channel: People+Arts\" (pronounced as \"people and arts\"), and again renamed as simply \"People+Arts\".\nThe station's programming consisted of a mix of British series, reality shows, hobby programs and some American series, either in their original language with subtitling (Portugal) or dubbed in Spanish/Portuguese with optional English soundtrack; a few Spanish programs originally broadcast by generalist networks also ran on People+Arts.\nIn January 2010, it was replaced in Portugal on TV Cabo's Channel 82 by Discovery Travel & Living. On April 13, 2010, People+Arts in Latin America was replaced by Liv, originally a channel dedicated to women's entertainment, but quickly evolved into a general entertainment channel, with the addition of series such as Blue Bloods and the 2010 remake of Hawaii Five-O.\nOn 15 November 2010, BBC Worldwide sold 50% interest in Animal Planet and Liv to Discovery Inc. for $156 million.\nOn July 9, 2012, Liv was relaunched as the Latin American version of the channel (and called Investigação Discovery in Brazil).\nReferences"
