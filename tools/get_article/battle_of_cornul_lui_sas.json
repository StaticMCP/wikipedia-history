By tacking this stance, Potocki openly defied the king's order to avoid any conflict with Ottomans. The battle resulted in a clear defeat of the Potocki's army. Both Stefan Potocki and Constantin Movilă's mother, Elisabeta Movilă were captured by Ottomans.\nThe former voivode of Moldavia Constantin Movilă was taken prisoner by the Tatars, with the intent to ransom him, but he drowned while they were crossing the Dniester.\nThis battle was an episode of Moldavian Magnate Wars.\nThis battle forms the topic of the first chapter in Mihail Sadoveanu's historical novel  (The Șoimărești Family).\nReferences"
