Leonard Part 6 was the biggest \"winner\" with three awards out of five nominations. Although he did not attend the ceremony, actor/producer/co-writer Bill Cosby later accepted all his awards on The Late Show.\nAwards and nominations\nFile:The World Affairs Council and Girard College present Bill Cosby (6343666943) (cropped to Cosby).jpg|Bill Cosby, Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay co-winner, and Worst Actor winner.\nFile:Madonna Rebel Heart Tour 2015 - Stockholm (23051472299) (cropped).jpg|Madonna, Worst Actress winner.\nFile:Daryl Hannah by Dana Fineman.jpg|Daryl Hannah, Worst Supporting Actress winner.\nFile:Norman Mailer 1948 (cropped).jpg|Norman Mailer, Worst Director co-winner.\nFile:Elaine May - publicity1.jpg|Elaine May, Worst Director co-winner.\nFile:George Michael.jpeg|George Michael, Worst Original Song winner.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" align=\"centre\"\n|-\n!
