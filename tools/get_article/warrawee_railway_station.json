It is served by Sydney Trains T1 North Shore line services.\nHistory\nWarrawee station opened on 1 August 1900. It was named after an Aboriginal word which means \"stop here\". It was suggested to the late Mr. Remington (who was largely responsible for securing it) by Mr. J. G. Edwards. A new footbridge was installed in 1977, which had a steel roof added in 1995 for weather protection. In 2009, the platforms were repaired and resurfaced.\nIn August 2020 the station was upgraded and a lift was installed.\nServices\nPlatforms\n|p2linename = T1\n|p2stop     = services to Hornsby and Berowra\n|p2notes    =\n}}\nTransport links\nCDC NSW operates one bus route via Warrawee station, under contract to Transport for NSW:\n*573: Turramurra to Sydney Adventist Hospital\nWarrawee station is served by one NightRide route:\n*N90: Hornsby station to Town Hall station\nTrackplan\n| legend = track\n| map = bs\\bs\\s\\s*↑N to \\\nd\\+d\\bs\\bs\\+cd\\\\c\\b*\\\nb\\\\+s!~s*StationConcourse\\\\bs\\d\\\\vSTR saffron!~MFADEg\\d\nb\\bs\\bs\\b\\b\\vSTR saffron\\\\\nSTRq!~MFADEgq\\STRfq\\STRq\\SHI1lq\\STRq-PLT\\STRq-PLT\\STRq-PLT!~XPLT\\STRq-PLT!~*Platform__align=b\\STRq-PLT\\STRq-PLT\\STRq-PLT!~*2↑__align=b\\STRq-PLT\\SHI1+lq\\STRq\\STRfq\\STRq!~MFADEfq\\b\\vBHF saffron\\\\\nSTRq!~MFADEgq\\STRgq\\STRq\\SHI1rq\\PLT-STRq\\PLT-STRq\\PLT-STRq!~XPLT\\PLT-STRq\\PLT-STRq!~*Platform__align=t\\PLT-STRq\\PLT-STRq\\PLT-STRq!~*1↓__align=t\\SHI1+rq\\STRq\\STRgq\\STRq!~MFADEfq\\b\\vSTR saffron\\\\\nb\\b\\bs\\bs\\\\vSTR saffron!~vNULgf.g\\\nbs\\bs\\bs\\vSTR saffron!~MFADEf\\\\\nc\\bs\\s\\b\\b\\\\\\d*plt__abbr=Platforms\\c\\b*2&nbsp;1\\\nbs\\bs\\s\\s*↓S to \\\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=10101124#/ Warrawee station details] Transport for New South Wales"
