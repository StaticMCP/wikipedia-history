She befriends her classmate, popular supermodel Mai Oduka, and joins her clique. However, her social anxiety causes her to panic during lunch one day, and she flees to the school roof. Mai follows Renako and, mistakenly believing she is about to jump, rushes to intervene. Startled, Renako slips and falls. Mai jumps to catch Renako and redirects their fall into a tree, saving her. Renako explains her social anxiety to Mai. In turn, Mai admits that trying to live up to her popularity makes her feel as if no one knows her real self. The two become closer after confiding in one another. The following day, Mai unexpectedly confesses her love to Renako, surprising the latter as she simply wishes to be friends. The two agree to take turns being friends and lovers, with both vying to convince the other that their preferred relationship would be better. On their first date, Mai gives Renako a kiss on the nose, flustering her. As she leaves, Renako vows that she will convince Mai to be friends.\n| TopColor            = #6AD0E7\n| LineColor           = #10aeaf\n}}\n| TranslitTitle       = Hajimete no Kiss Nande, Muri!\n| NativeTitle         = 初めてのキスなんて、ムリ!\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Yuto Nakamura\n| Aux2                = Natsumi Uchinuma\n| OriginalAirDate     =\n| ShortSummary        = Renako invites Mai to her house, where they play video games. The next day, Mai visits again and challenges Renako to another game, on the condition that if she wins, Renako will accept one request from her. Mai wins and asks Renako for a hug. The hug surprises Renako, as she realizes the depth of Mai's affections. Later, after school, Mai and Renako write lists expressing what they would like to do as girlfriends and friends, respectively. Mai's list is overtly sexual, which flusters Renako. She invites Mai to a friendship outing, and they visit DiverCity Tokyo Plaza. As they are leaving, it suddenly rains, soaking Mai. Mai takes Renako to a hotel to wait out the rain, where they take a bath together. Renako tells Mai what her ideal friendship looks like, and Mai is surprised, saying that her ideal romance with Renako is similar. Mai advances upon and kisses Renako on the mouth. Fearing she will be seduced into fulfilling Mai's sexual desires, Renako panics. Renako tells Mai that the kiss does not count, as they are currently friends. Mai responds by \"friend kissing\" Renako again, reaffirming her affections.\n| TopColor            = #FDAFD4\n| LineColor           = #FD56A4\n}}\n| TranslitTitle       = Muriyari Nande, Dame Muri!\n| NativeTitle         = ムリヤリなんて、だめムリ!\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Daisuke Inoue\n| Aux2                = Daisuke Inoue\n| OriginalAirDate     =\n| ShortSummary        = After their kiss, Mai and Renako both find themselves unable to stop thinking about one another, though Renako denies this. While Mai visits Paris for modeling work, Renako goes shopping with Ajisai. Renako feels insecure due to her attraction to Ajisai, but tells herself it does not count as cheating on Mai since they are not officially dating. Ajisai makes plans to come to Renako's house. Later, Mai calls Renako, and Renako tells her about her outing with Ajisai. Mai is upset and jealous, leading to an argument. Mai arrives unannounced to the Amaori house during Ajisai's visit, surprising Renako. Ajisai leaves, and Mai comes onto Renako, pinning her to the floor and removing her shirt. Despite enjoying being touched by Mai, Renako feels conflicted, reasoning that if the situation escalates, they will not be able to remain friends. Aroused, Mai ignores Renako's pleas to stop. The encounter is cut short when Renako's younger sister Haruna walks in. Embarrassed, she immediately leaves. Renako slaps Mai and admonishes her conduct. Downcast, Mai apologizes and departs. Afterwards, Renako regrets not having been more firm in asserting her boundaries, but considers that she may have wanted to go further.\n| TopColor            = #6AD0E7\n| LineColor           = #10aeaf\n}}\nFull Episode 04  It's Anime［Multi-Subs］ |date=July 28, 2025 |type=Television production |language=en |publisher=Remow |at=Video description |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250728164009/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cri-aqlLXTE |archive-date=July 28, 2025}}\n| TranslitTitle       = Mai Nante, Yappari Muri Muri!

Satsuki calls Renako to the roof, and tells Renako that Mai came to her house and tearfully told the full story. Realizing Mai regrets her actions, Renako resolves to make amends. Ajisai invites Renako to her house. Wanting to accept but unable to, as Mai is a higher priority, Renako enthusiastically tells Ajisai she really likes her and would like to hang out another time, leaving Ajisai flustered. Renako heads to a hotel where Mai is hosting a \"suitors' party\" to which she has invited everyone who has previously confessed to her, seeking a new partner after having decided to give up on Renako. Renako confronts Mai and admits that she has developed romantic feelings. The two kiss, and Mai cancels the suitors' party. Later, when they are set to decide whether they are friends or lovers, Renako says she is still not certain she wants to be girlfriends, but offers an alternative of \"more than friends, less than lovers\". Mai accepts, but declares her intent to convince Renako to commit to a proper romantic relationship before their graduation.\n| TopColor            = #FDAFD4\n| LineColor           = #FD56A4\n}}\nFull Episode 05  It's Anime［Multi-Subs］ |date=August 4, 2025 |type=Television production |language=en |publisher=Remow |at=Video description |archive-url=https://perma.cc/T3SS-KN2C |archive-date=August 8, 2025}}\n| TranslitTitle       = Koibito Toka, Zettai ni Muri!

In order to spite Mai, Satsuki asks Renako to date her. Despite Renako's reluctance, she ultimately agrees on the condition that they only date temporarily until Satsuki and Mai reconcile. Satsuki takes Renako to a shrine where she and Mai met as small children, and declares her intent to \"defeat\" Mai. The two spend some time together, drawing Mai's notice. Mai takes Renako aside privately and assures Renako that as they are not dating proper, she does not need to worry about cheating with Satsuki, as Mai will be satisfied so long as Renako ultimately ends up in a relationship with her. Later, Renako and Mai encounter each other at school, and Satsuki approaches Renako intimately in front of Mai in an attempt to provoke Mai's jealousy, prompting Renako to reflect that she has been caught in the middle of their feud.\n| TopColor            = #6AD0E7\n| LineColor           = #10aeaf\n}}\nFull Episode 06  It's Anime［Multi-Subs］ |date=August 11, 2025 |type=Television production |language=en |publisher=Remow |at=Video description |archive-url=https://perma.cc/GRE3-H6KX |archive-date=August 11, 2025}}\n| TranslitTitle       = Futari Dake no Himitsu ga Osugite, Mou Muri!\n| NativeTitle         = ふたりだけのヒミツが多すぎて、もうムリ!\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Koichi Tamura\n| Aux2                = Natsumi Uchinuma and Takao Kato\n| OriginalAirDate     =\n| ShortSummary        = Satsuki helps Renako study to improve her mediocre grades, and reflects on how she used to struggle academically, until she noticed Mai's academic aptitude and was motivated to improve. That evening, Haruna takes Renako out to get donuts. Satsuki is working at the donut shop and introduces herself as Renako's girlfriend, confusing Haruna, who assumes Renako is cheating on Mai. After Satsuki's shift ends, she takes Renako to her home. There, Renako learns that Satsuki lives in a small apartment with her single mother and that the two both work to support each other, which embarrasses Satsuki. In return, Renako admits her introverted nature, but Satsuki is unsurprised, noting Renako's low self-esteem and anxious attitude. Upset by this, Renako flees the apartment, but is found by Satsuki, who offers to let Renako stay the night. Satsuki bathes with and washes Renako, eager to \"even the score\" with Mai. Renako is aroused by the encounter, and Satsuki finds this irritating. That night, Satsuki asks Renako for a picture of them kissing to have proof of their relationship to show to Mai. Renako kisses Satsuki on the mouth, flustering Satsuki, who assumed the kiss would be on the cheek.\n| TopColor            = #FDAFD4\n| LineColor           = #FD56A4\n}}\nFull Episode 07  It's Anime［Multi-Subs］ |date=August 18, 2025 |type=Television production |language=en |publisher=Remow |at=Video description |archive-url=https://perma.cc/YMJ2-DFDF |archive-date=August 18, 2025}}\n| TranslitTitle       = Shuraba Toka, dō Agaite mo Muri!\n| NativeTitle         = 修羅場とか、どうあがいてもムリ!\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Tomoaki Takatsudo and Yuto Nakamura\n| Aux2                = Atsushi Otsuki\n| OriginalAirDate     =\n| ShortSummary        = Renako's interactions with Satsuki at school are awkward after their kiss, although Satsuki denies that she feels any affections for Renako. Meanwhile, Ajisai expresses interest in spending more time with Renako, but Renako is unavailable due to her obligations to Satsuki. Ajisai speaks with Renako by phone, and they discuss Mai and Satsuki's feud. Renako expresses that she would like them to make up, prompting Ajisai to encourage Mai to do so. Mai asks Satsuki to clarify what offended her, but Satsuki refuses to do so and instead provokes an argument. Mai deflects by saying she will marry Renako, and Satsuki claims that she and Renako are in a relationship, showing the photo of their kiss as evidence, despite Renako's protests. The argument escalates, and Satsuki and Mai declare that they will battle for Renako's hand in marriage. Renako insists on competing as well, on the condition that if she wins, they will all return to the previous status quo as friends. She stipulates that they will play a match in an FPS game to decide the winner. Later, Satsuki comes over to Renako's house to practice her gaming skills.\n| TopColor            = #6AD0E7\n| LineColor           = #10aeaf\n}}\nFull Episode 08  It's Anime［Multi-Subs］ |date=August 25, 2025 |type=Television production |language=en |publisher=Remow |at=Video description |archive-url=https://perma.cc/N6RY-9CZ5 |archive-date=August 25, 2025}}\n| TranslitTitle       = Kanzen Shōri Suru Nante, Muri Muri!\n| NativeTitle         = 完全勝利するなんて、ムリムリ!\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Pei-Ni Hong\n| Aux2                = Junichi Sakata\n| OriginalAirDate     =\n| ShortSummary        = At the FPS match, Mai wins the first of three rounds, while Renako wins the second. Satsuki excuses herself to the restroom, but after she does not return, Renako goes to check on her. Satsuki tells Renako that she is frustrated by thus far not having been able to beat Mai despite putting in all her best efforts, leading Renako to realize that her simply winning the game would not lead to the two of them making up. Renako successfully encourages Satsuki to not give up. During the third round, Satsuki tells the story of how she and Mai became friends as small children, as she let Mai visit her house when Mai, stressed by her obligations to her mother, was reluctant to return home. When Mai's mother came to collect her, Satsuki defended Mai, saying she had not done anything wrong. The recollection distracts Mai long enough for Satsuki to defeat her, satisfying Satsuki's desire for victory, after which Renako wins the match. Later, Mai's group meets up at a diner to celebrate Satsuki's birthday, and Satsuki reveals that she has beaten Mai's test scores.

Ajisai talks about her home life, saying she has no time to herself as she cares for her little brothers while her parents work. Ajisai's brothers challenge Renako to play video games with them. After they prolong their playtime despite Ajisai gently urging them to let her have her time with Renako, Ajisai snaps and yells at them, then sends them to their room. Ajisai is embarrassed by her outburst, and the rest of their hangout is awkward. Later, Ajisai calls Renako and declares her intent to run away from home. Fearing for Ajisai's safety, Renako gets up early to intercept her and the two get on a train together. Intensely anxious due to her infatuation with Ajisai, Renako excuses herself and messages Satsuki for advice. Satsuki sends Renako a list of example topics to discuss with Ajisai, but cautions Renako to not put Ajisai on a pedestal, saying that everyone has flaws. They get off the train at a small seaside town, where Ajisai plans to go to an inn she often visits with her family. Noticing Ajisai's insecurity about going somewhere familiar despite desiring an escape, Renako suggests they go to a different inn.\n| TopColor            = #6AD0E7\n| LineColor           = #10aeaf\n}}\nFull Episode 10  It's Anime［Multi-Subs］ |date=September 8, 2025 |type=Television production |language=en |publisher=Remow |at=Video description |archive-url=https://perma.cc/9UNW-8DU8 |archive-date=September 8, 2025}}\n| TranslitTitle       = Futari Kiri no Ryokou Nante, Muri!?\n| NativeTitle         = ふたりっきりの旅行なんて、ムリ!?\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Daisuke Inoue\n| Aux2                = Daisuke Inoue\n| OriginalAirDate     =\n| ShortSummary        = Ajisai proposes that she pay for their stay, as she feels guilty about running away and believes she must shoulder the expense. Renako disagrees, insisting on covering her share. To settle the issue, they play ping-pong. They express their competing conceptions of friendship, with Ajisai feeling she must shoulder their burdens alone to ensure Renako's happiness. Renako refutes this, saying that their happiness should be reciprocal and they should share their problems. Although Ajisai wins the game, she agrees to let Renako pay, but instead asks Renako to join her in the hot springs. While they are washing themselves, Renako offhandedly mentions that she touched Satsuki's breasts in the bath. Ajisai offers to let Renako touch hers as well. Renako does so, and the two are aroused despite their embarrassment. Later they discuss the differences between romance and friendship, with Ajisai noting Renako's idea of friendship is like dating. The next morning, Ajisai asks Renako to roleplay as her older sister, as she is tired of her responsibilities as an older sibling and wants to be a little sister. Renako plays along with Ajisai's fantasy.

During the festival, Mai tells Ajisai about her attraction to Renako, asking if Ajisai has similar feelings. Ajisai denies it, not wanting to interfere with Mai's own romantic pursuit. Renako reflects fondly on her time with Ajisai and Mai, and Mai leaves in the morning before Ajisai is awake, having to go to work. When Ajisai and Renako go to wait for their return train back, Renako expresses her gratitude to Ajisai for their friendship. Ajisai, in turn, says she has something she wants to tell Renako, but as she says it, the sound of a passing train drowns out her voice, and Renako does not hear Ajisai's confession. Embarrassed, Ajisai drops the subject. She reflects on the morning she ran away, when she had been planning to turn back and go home once she had reached the station until finding Renako there to greet her.

Renako expresses that she often thinks about Ajisai and would like to know if there is any way she can help her feel better. In response, Ajisai begins suddenly crying, and abruptly departs, leaving Renako confused. Renako calls Mai to ask if she might know what trouble Ajisai is having.
