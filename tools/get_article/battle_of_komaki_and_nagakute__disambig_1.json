Hideyoshi and Ieyasu had both served Oda Nobunaga and had not previously come into conflict; this would in fact be their only period of enmity.\nIeyasu achieved tactical victory in the fighting, but both leaders realized that neither could strategically gain from it. The conflict was resolved when Hideyoshi and Ieyasu agreed to exchange hostages; Ieyasu sent his son (Ogimaru) to Hideyoshi, who in turn sent his own sister (Asahi no kata) and mother (Ōmandokoro) to Ieyasu.\nBackground\nIn 1583, at the Battle of Shizugatake, Hideyoshi supported Nobukatsu, the second son of Oda Nobunaga, and defeated Shibata Katsuie, who supported Nobunaga's third son, Nobutaka. After winning the battle, Hideyoshi invited Nobukatsu and other generals to his residence at Osaka Castle, which he had just completed that same year. The meaning of such an invitation was for all the men to pay homage to Hideyoshi, which would reverse the roles between Hideyoshi and Nobukatsu. Therefore, Nobukatsu broke his bonds to Hideyoshi and did not go to Osaka Castle. Hideyoshi offered reconciliation to three of Nobukatsu's chief retainers (Tsugawa Yoshifuyu, Okada Shigetaka and Azai Nagatoki), which led to rumors that they were all in support of Hideyoshi. This in turn led Nobukatsu to become suspicious of the three men, whom he ordered executed on the sixth day of the third month of Tenshō 12 (or 17 March 1584 on the Gregorian calendar)  These actions gave Hideyoshi the justification for attacking Nobukatsu and, as a result, Nobukatsu asked Tokugawa Ieyasu for auxiliary forces. The next day, when Ieyasu sent his forces out to battle, it became a battle between Hideyoshi and Ieyasu.\nTokugawa troops took the traditional Oda stronghold of Owari. Hideyoshi responded by sending an army into Owari. Ieyasu decided to confront Hideyoshi's forces in Komaki because his general, Sakakibara Yasumasa, suggested the area was favorable for the Tokugawa force to fight incoming enemies from the west. Additionally, Ieyasu and Nobukatsu formed an anti-Hideyoshi alliance with Chōsokabe Motochika, through contact with Kōsokabe Chikayasu.\nBattle events\nDuring this conflict, Honda Tadakatsu entered negotiation with the Akai clan, a samurai clan from Tanba Province, which led by Ashida Tokinao, younger brother of Akai Naomasa, as Tokinao aspired for the revival of the Akai clan by contributing with Tokugawa clan.}} Tokinao then raised an army in Tanba to aid Ieyasu.\nOn March 10 1584, Toyotomi Hideyoshi invited Mizuno Tadashige, Niwa Ujitsugu, and Takagi Sadatomo, who were on Oda Nobukatsu's faction, to join him as vassals, but they did not accept. That same month, Tadashige served on Nobukatsu side in the Battle of Komaki. On the 13th, his son Katsunari was ordered to rescue Kobe Castle in Ise. Tadashige attacked the refuge of Okada Yoshitada, the younger brother of Okada Shigetaka (who was executed by Nobukatsu) , forcing him to surrender and capturing it.\nBattle of Haguro\nInuyama Castle on a cliff\nOn April 8, Tadashige led the vanguard of the Oda-Tokugawa allied forces, along with Okanaga Nagamori, Osuka Yasutaka, Sakakibara Yasumasa, Honda Hirotaka, and Niwa Ujitsugu. At a military council held at Obata Castle, Tadashige proposed a strategy to avoid the enemy's main force and rather attacking the Toyotomi army's rear. Sakakibara and other generals agreed and commence Tadashige's plan. The next morning, they attacked Miyoshi Hidetsugu's main camp and routed him. In this engagement, Tadashige's family member, Mizuno Buncho, reportedly manage to Kill enemy general Kinoshita Toshimasa.\nOn Tensho 12, 13th day of the third month (23 April 1584), Ieyasu arrived at Kiyosu Castle. On that same day, warriors of the Oda clan's vassals who were led by Ikeda Tsuneoki switched to the side of Hideyoshi and took over Inuyama Castle, which had originally been built by Oda Nobunaga. Ieyasu was upset upon hearing this news and rushed to Inuyama Castle, arriving two days later. Following this, Tadatsugu returned to Komaki where he, Honda Tadakatsu, and Ishikawa Kazumasa stationed their troops.\nThree days later, on the 16th day of the third month (26 April), forces called to support Inuyama Castle arrived in Haguro. Ieyasu, however, had already known of these plans and had Sakai Tadatsugu and Sakakibara Yasumasa move 5,000 troops to Haguro that same evening. Early the following morning, Tadatsugu's troops launched a surprise attack on Nagayoshi, whose troops barely escaped after the onslaught.\nOn the 18th day (28 April), without fear of raids from enemies, Ieyasu took over Inuyama Castle and finished the defenses that had first been built up by Hideyoshi.\nMission to Mikawa\nHideyoshi and his troops left his fortifications at Osaka Castle on the 21st day (1 May), arriving at Inuyama Castle on the 27th day (7 May), and in Gakuden (present-day Inuyama) on the 5th day of the fourth month (14 May 1584).\nIeyasu, between entering Komaki Castle and arriving in Gakuden, stayed away from battle, except for a few smaller skirmishes here and there. Hideyoshi was lulled into complacency by this situation, aided by Tsuneoki, who said to him, \"Ieyasu is now in Komakiyama. He is away from his main base in Okazaki and if we were to move our arms against him, we will certainly win.\"\nThe ambitious Hideyoshi decided to set out for Mikawa, along with the support of Mori Nagayoshi (who had regained his reputation at the Battle of Haguro), Ikeda Tsuneoki (who was embarrassed by his daughter's marriage), Hori Hidemasa and the young Hidetsugu (17 years old at the time).\nHidetsugu was able to amass 8,000 men, which were supported by Hori Hidemasa's 3,000 men, Mori Nagayoshi's 3,000 men and Tsuneoki's 6,000 men. On the following day, they all set out for Mikawa.\nBattle of Iwasaki Castle\nThe Battle of Iwasaki was fought between the forces of Ikeda Tsuneoki and the Iwasaki castle garrison led by Niwa Ujitsugu. Though it was just part of overall Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, it played an important role in the outcome.\nIkeda Tsuneoki led the attack on Iwasaki Castle (modern-day Nisshin) and was promptly shot off from his horse. Embarrassed by his fall, Tsuneoki forgot about the hit-and-run tactics and started a full assault on the castle. Though the defenders fought well, the castle fell. Niwa Ujitsugu, suffered numerous casualties including 300 killed, Ujitsugu's brother Niwa Ujishige being among the dead.\nHidetsugu's defeat\nOn the 7th day of the fourth month (16 May), Ieyasu learned of Hidetsugu's encampment at Shinogi (modern-day Kasugai) through the information provided by farmers in Iga Province. Ieyasu entered into Obata Castle (Moriyama-ku, Nagoya) the following day and chose to pitch camp for the evening. Early the next morning, he sent his commanders Ōsuga Yasutaka and Sakakibara Yasumasa forces to chase after Toyotomi Hidetsugu's forces, and followed shortly thereafter with his own. Hidetsugu resumed his march on the eight day after hearing of Ieyasu's entrance to Obata Castle.\nYasumasa and Yasutaka launch a surprise attack against unprepared Hidetsugu, where they inflicted heavy losses to Hidetsugu army. However, Yasumasa and Yasutaka advance were held back by reinforcement forces led by Hori Hidemasa, thus they retreat from the battle.\nBattle of Hakusanmori\nAt the time that Ikeda Tsuneoki was attacking Iwasaki Castle, Hidetsugu, Hidemasa and Nagayoshi moved their forces to Hakusanmori (the modern-day cities of Owariasahi, Nagakute) to rest their forces, but Tokugawa forces were closing in on them. Later, Hidetsugu forces were ambushed by Ōsuga Yasutaka and Sakakibara Yasumasa. Hidetsugu's forces were pretty much destroyed by Tokugawa's surprise attack. Hidetsugu himself was knocked from his horse, but was able to get another horse and escape. It was at this battle that many members of the Kinoshita family (including Sukehisa, the father of Hideyoshi's wife, Nene) died.\nBattle of Hinokigane\nFollowing the battle of Hakusanmori, the Tokugawa fortified Mount Komaki, creating a stalemate there. Thus, Ikeda Tsuneoki, one of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's chief commanders, decided to begin raids through neighboring Mikawa Province with an army numbering 20,000. Ieyasu expected this and led Tokugawa troops to challenge  Hideyoshi's forces.  Mizuno Tadashige led Tokugawa's rear-guard against Ikeda's force and the noise of the battle alerted Hori Hidemasa, the head of one of Hideyoshi's divisions.  Hori Hidemasa led his men to the defense of his comrades, taking up position in the village of Nagakute. He held off the initial Tokugawa attacks, but was forced to withdraw as the main body of the Tokugawa army arrived, numbering some 9,000 warriors.\nBattle of Nagakute\nMori Nagayoshi, another of Hideyoshi's commanders, waited until Ieyasu moved in to support Ii Naomasa, so that he could flank them. At first, Naomasa's troops broke and retreating under the enemy assault, until Ieyasu furiously sent Naomasa's lieutenant, Kimata Morikatsu, to assist Naomasa restore order. In the end, Tokugawa forces charged forward, rather than swinging around, and avoided the flanking maneuver. Mori Nagayoshi was shot off his horse, which demoralized Ikeda's force. Ii Naomasa commanded around three thousand musketeers during this battle. The battle lasted over two hours, as Naomasa units repeatedly foiled attempted charges towards his position by  Tsuneoki and Mori Nagayoshi troops with musket rifle barrages, }} The army of Nagayoshi and Tsuneoki were annihilated and it ended in victory for the Tokugawa force. A letter from Oda Nobukatsu (the \"Yoshimura Documents\") and supporying account is also found in a letter from Luis Frois, who states that the majority of the approximately 10,000 soldiers killed in this battle were from Hidetsugu's army. This news makes Hideyoshi angry.\nLater, Ieyasu decided to withdraw, unwilling to risk further casualties as Hideyoshi's main army approached, and returned to Komaki.\nWhen news of the loss at the Battle of Hakusanmori arrived in the afternoon, the 20,000 troops of Hideyoshi rushed to Ryūsen-ji, near the battle site. Later that evening, when he heard that Ieyasu was staying at Obata Castle, he decided to assault it the next morning; however, during that time, Ieyasu had left Obata Castle, went to Komakiyama Castle and finally returned to Kiyosu Castle. Hideyoshi heard the news of Tsuneoki dead and Ieyasu's departure shortly thereafter, and on the 10th day of the fourth month (19 May), he left Gakuden; he arrived back to Osaka castle on the 1st day of the fifth month (9 June).\nYasumasa circulates a derogatory manifesto proclamations which condemn Hideyoshi conduct which Yasumasa view as betrayal towards the will of Oda Nobunaga and also insulting Hideyoshi origin from humble peasant class. Hideyoshi become furious after hearing this proclamation and issuing order that he will reward of 100,000 Kan (Japanese gold ingot) to anyone who could bring him the head of Yasumasa.}}\nSiege of Kanie Castle\nAfter the battle of Nagakute in April, the front line in northern Owari reached a stalemate. At this time, Kanie Castle was located about three miles between Ieyasu's Kiyosu Castle and Nobuo's Nagashima Castle, and was connected to the Mie moat and three castles: Ono Castle, Shimojima Castle, and Maeda Castle. Kanie castle faced the sea and was one of the leading ports in Owari, along with Atsuta and Tsushima. On June 18, Ieyasu and Nobuo led 20,000 soldiers and besieged Kanie, Maeda, and Shimojima. Kanie castle was defended by Maeda Nagatane and Takigawa Kazumasu. Tadatsugu, Okanabe Mori, and Yamaguchi Shigemasa spearheaded the attack of Shimojima castle, while Sakakibara Yasumasa, Osuga Yasutaka were deployed to capture any fleeing defenders.\nOn June 23, Ieyasu entered the Kanie castle with Sakakibara Yasumasa after it was subdued.\nfurther clashes before truce\nOn the 9th day of the ninth month (12 October), Sassa Narimasa, at the behest of Ieyasu, attacked Suemori Castle in Noto Province, forcing out its resident; later Maeda Toshiie arrived in the middle of the night, and defeated the Sassa forces.group. Later, Hideyoshi besieged Kuwana Castle, where Oda Nobukatsu was holed up, but Mizuno Tadashige and his men held out and repelled the attack. During the battle at Kuwana, Tadashige's eldest son, Katsunari, killed Tadashige's vassal, Tominaga Hanbei, claiming that his father had punished him for slander. Tadashige, hearing his father's explanation in Komaki, did not forgive him and banished him.\nIn October, Hideyoshi besieged Kuwana Castle, where Oda Nobukatsu was holed up, but Tadashige and his men held out and repelled the attack. During the battle at Kuwana, Tadashige's eldest son, Katsunari, killed Tadashige's vassal, Tominaga Hanbei, claiming that his father had punished him for slander. Tadashige, hearing his son's explanation in Komaki, did not forgive him and banished him.\nOn November 12th, Nobukatsu made peace with Hideyoshi without Ieyasu's permission.group. On November 15, Nobukatsu made a separate peace with Hideyoshi and became his vassal, so Tadashige became a subordinate vassal. In February 1585, when Hideyoshi raised an army to attack Saiga , Nobukatsu ordered him to march on the 12th of the same month. Although the exact date is unclear, it appears that Tadashige became Hideyoshi's direct vassal around this time.  In September, Hideyoshi granted him an additional 728 koku of land in Kanda, Toshima County, Settsu Province.\nThough Ieyasu had gained the advantage in both engagements, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu did make peace with each other in the early part of 1585. Oda Nagamasu become the peacemakers between Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, also between Sassa Narimasa and Maeda Toshiie.\nIn the words of George Sansom, \"...both men were too sensible to waste strength on a foolish quarrel.\"\n1586 Earthquake and flood in Japan\nSubsquent with the ongoing hostility, from May to July, heavy rains fell constantly from the Kantō region to the Tōkai region, in what was dubbed the \"heaviest flood in 50 years\" in the historical record of Ietada-nikki.\nIn the middle of this conflict, the 1586 Tenshō earthquake occurred. For long time, it was widely believed the devastation of the Tokugawa clan's territory made it difficult to continue fighting against the Toyotomi government and they were forced to rebuild their country. This was a dangerous situation for the Tokugawa clan which could have resulted in their annihilation due to the Oda clan collapsing after Nobunaga's death.\nHowever, in 21st century, Japanese researchers of earthquake history have contested such view. After Hideyoshi reached peace agreement with Nobukatsu, which followed by Ieyasu's repeated refusal to also submit to Hideyoshi, the earthquake extensively damaged Osaka. This precendently caused Hideyoshi to abort the campaign against Ieyasu. Historian Masaru Hirayama also Supported this view. By reviewing the pattern of the said earthquake through historical record, the disaster has devastated the majority of Toyotomi's controlled territories, while Mikawa province which controlled by Tokugawa was only hit by minor fraction of the earthquake. By this knowledge, Hirayama viewed that the disaster was actually somewhat helped Ieyasu in this conflict.\nIn any case, in the end Ieyasu finally agree for truce he sent his son, Ogimaru (later Yuki Hideyasu), as a hostage to Hideyoshi, thus ending the conflict. followed by Hideyoshi sending his younger sister Asahi no kata and mother Ōmandokoro to Tokugawa Ieyasu as hostages as a sign of goodwill.\nNational Historic Site\nThe  in the city of Nagakute was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1939. The designation includes Mount Mihata (御旗山), Mount Irogane (色金山), and the head mound (首塚)  It is about a 3-minute walk from Nagakute Kosenjō Station on the Linimo maglev line.\nNames for the battle\nDuring the Edo period, the public records of the Tokugawa clan and the shogunate refer to these battles as Battle of Komaki (小牧陣 Komaki no Jin). However, there are also documents that refer to it as the Battle of Iwasakiguchi (岩崎口の戦い Iwasakiguchi no Tatakai). There are places where the fighting in Nagakute is called the Battle of Nagakute (長久手合戦 Nagakute Gassen), but the two battles have generally been merged into one. Many other names have also been used to describe these battles, some of which separate the two, while the others keep them together. During the Meiji Restoration, the various Japanese words for battles, campaigns, etc., were mostly unified, leading to it sometimes being called the Komaki and Nagakute Campaign (小牧・長久手の役 Komaki-Nagakute no Eki). Through all of this, though, \"Battle of Komaki and Nagakute\" has come to be the accepted name.\nSee also\n* Tenshō-Jingo war\n* Ikeda Sen\n* List of Historic Sites of Japan (Aichi)\nAppendix\nFootnotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
