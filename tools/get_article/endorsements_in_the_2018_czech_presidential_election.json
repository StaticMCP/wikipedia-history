After initial speculation that the party may endorse Zeman, ČSSD leader Bohuslav Sobotka announced that they were unlikely to do so due to Zeman's actions during the Czech government crisis in May 2017. It was reported that ČSSD planned to nominate Lubomír Zaorálek, who decided to not run, and eventually ČSSD decided to not support any candidate. This decision caused conflict within the party; the Děčín branch of ČSSD endorsed Zeman on 28 November 2017, while Young Social Democrats, the party's youth wing, endorsed Drahoš. On 4 January 2018, some members of the party founded a political platform called \"Let's Save ČSSD\", which endorsed Miloš Zeman.\n*The Party of Free Citizens (Svobodní) have not endorsed any candidate, but published a post on Twitter when Mirek Topolánek announced his candidacy, saying that they would be watching his candidacy. Party leader Pajonk stated that he believed the party should choose a candidate to endorse. On 9 December 2017, Svobodní started talks with Topolánek, Hynek and Hannig to negotiate their support. The party eventually failed to reach a consensus on one candidate and did not endorse any. Party leader Pajonk endorsed Mirek Topolánek.\n*TOP 09 decided not to endorse any candidate. Prominent members of TOP 09 expressed approval of Drahoš' decision to run. Former leader Karel Schwarzenberg endorsed Fischer, while Miroslav Kalousek spoke positively about Mirek Topolánek's candidacy.\n*The Green Party published its strategy for the presidential election on 1 June 2016. The party is opposed to incumbent president Miloš Zeman, and planned a common candidate of centre-left parties in cooperation with ČSSD, the Pirate Party and KDU-ČSL. The party does not have the resources to nominate its own candidate.\n* The Moravians party submitted questions to all nine candidates about particular problems relating to Moravian citizens.\n*The Communist Party announced on 9 September 2017 that they would support a candidate who would respect the party and agree to their conditions.\n*The Czech Pirate Party announced on 25 October 2017 that they would not stand their own candidate or support any other candidate. However, the party did launch a survey to determine which candidate had the most support among its members. Marek Hilšer is leading the poll.\n* ANO 2011 originally planned to hold a presidential primary, but decided against it following the 2017 legislative election. Various commentators had speculated that the party would endorse ANO minister Martin Stropnický, or incumbent president Zeman, but on 6 December 2017, Andrej Babiš announced that ANO 2011 would not endorse any presidential candidate. Babiš later announced that ANO would in fact endorse a candidate, and would reveal their endorsement on 11 January 2018. On 11 January 2018, Babiš announced his support for Zeman.\nSecond round\nJiří Drahoš\nPolitical\n* Pavel Fischer, 2018 presidential candidate.\n* Marek Hilšer, 2018 presidential candidate.\n* Michal Horáček, 2018 presidential candidate.\n* Vratislav Kulhánek, 2018 presidential candidate.\n* Mirek Topolánek, 2018 presidential candidate.\n* Ivan Bartoš, leader of the Czech Pirate Party\n* Josef Káles, member of the city council of Chrudim and the Party of Free Citizens.\n* Pavel Mises, member of the republican committee of the Party of Free Citizens.\n* Josefa Knota, vice president of the TOP 09 in the South Bohemian Region.\n* Karel Vodička, representative of the ČSSD in exile\n* Martina Dlabajová, Member of the European Parliament for ANO 2011\n* Dita Charanzová, Member of the European Parliament for ANO 2011 (but independent)\n* Petr Ježek, Member of the European Parliament for ANO 2011\n* Tomáš Macura, Major of Ostrava\n* Jiří Štěpán, Governor of the Hradec Králové Region\n* Bohuslav Sobotka, former Prime Minister\n* Martin Netolický, Governor of the Pardubice Region\n* Josef Bernard, Governor of the Plzeň Region\n* Karel Schwarzenberg, former leader of TOP 09.\nParties\n*TOP 09\n*Civic Democratic Party (ODS)\n*Green Party (Z)\n*Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU–ČSL)\n*Young Social Democrats (MSD), Youth wing of ČSSD\n*Mayors and Independents (STAN)\n*Liberal-Environmental Party (LES)\n*Freeholder Party of the Czech Republic (SsČR)\n*Club of Committed Non-Party Members (KLAN)\n*Mayors for Liberec Region (SLK)\n*Senator 21 (SEN 21)\n*Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA)\n*Czech Pirate Party (Piráti)\nMiloš Zeman\nPolitical\n* Petr Hannig, 2018 presidential candidate.\n* Jiří Hynek, 2018 presidential candidate.\n* Miroslav Kavij, leader of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia of Plzeň.\n* Jan Klán, leader of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia of Kutná Hora.\n* Andrej Babiš, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic\n* Milan Chovanec, Leader of the ČSSD\n* Jiří Zimola, former Governor of South Bohemian Region and former Member of the Chamber of Deputies for ČSSD\n* Michal Hašek, former Governor of South Moravian Region and former Member of the Chamber of Deputies for ČSSD\n* Miroslav Sládek, Leader of the SPR–RSČ and former Member of the Chamber of Deputies for SPR–RSČ\n* Jiří Paroubek, former Prime Minister\n* Václav Klaus, former President and Prime Minister.\nParties\n* Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD)\n* Party of Civic Rights (SPOZ)\n* Workers' Party of Social Justice (DSSS)\n* No To Brussels - National Democracy (ND)\n* Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSČM)\n* Coalition for Republic – Republican Party of Czechoslovakia (SPR–RSČ)\n* Realists (REAL)\n* Democratic Green Party (DSZ)\n* Czech Sovereignty (ČS)\n* Independence Party of the Czech Republic (SNČR)\nReferences"
