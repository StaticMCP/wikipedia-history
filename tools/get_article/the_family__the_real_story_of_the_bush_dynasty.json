It was published on September 14, 2004, less than two months before the 2004 US Presidential election. Reviews of the book were mixed, with some of the \"accusations,\" according to The New York Times, \"[standing] up better than others.\"\nGlynn Wilson, who failed to graduate yet falsely claimed to be professor of journalism at the University of Tennessee and who, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, falsely claimed to have been the New Orleans Bureau Chief of the Dallas Morning News (no such bureau existed), was a free-lance journalist from Alabama, who sued Kelley for plagiarism claiming passages from the book contained the exact wording as an online article he had written. Wilson subsequently withdrew the infringement suit, first filed in Federal District Court in Birmingham. In an interview with the New York Times, Wilson indicated he withdrew because he was likely to lose the suit. Wilson also agreed not to refile his claim. According to the New York Times, Wilson received no monetary settlement from Kelley or the publisher.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/thefamily/ Official website]\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/books/review/10WIDMERL.html New York Times Book Review, \"The Family: 'Here Comes the Son'\"]\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45728-2004Sep23.html \"All the Way to the White House\"] review in The Washington Post\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/26/politics2 \"Brought low by a bottom feeder\"] review in The Guardian\n* [http://ontheissues.org/Kitty_Kelley.htm OnTheIssues.org's book review and excerpts]\n* [https://www.c-span.org/video/?285736-1/family-secrets Presentation by Kelley on The Family, September 16, 2004], C-SPAN\n* [https://www.c-span.org/video/?183650-1/the-family-real-story-bush-dynasty-book-party Book party for The Family, September 21, 2004], C-SPAN\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/19/arts/writer-gives-up-legal-challenge-to-bush-book.html Writer gives up legal challenge to Bush Book, September 21, 2004], March 19, 2005 The New York Times"
