She describes catalysis as a process at length in her 1794 book An Essay On Combustion with a View to a New Art of Dying and Painting, wherein the Phlogistic and Antiphlogistic Hypotheses are Proved Erroneous.\n19th century\n* c. 1800 – Thomas Wedgwood conceives of making permanent pictures of camera images by using a durable surface coated with a light-sensitive chemical. He succeeds only in producing silhouettes and other shadow images, and is unable to make them permanent.\n* 1810 – Thomas Johann Seebeck records near-true colours of the solar spectrum on paper sensitised with silver chloride, though is unable to preserve the results, and his report is included in Goethe's Theory of Colours (Zur Farbenlehre).\n* 1816 – Nicéphore Niépce succeeds in making negative photographs of camera images on paper coated with silver chloride, but cannot adequately \"fix\" them to stop them from darkening all over when exposed to light for viewing.\n* 1822 – Niépce abandons silver halide photography as hopelessly impermanent and tries using thin coatings of Bitumen of Judea on metal and glass. He creates the first fixed, permanent photograph, a copy of an engraving of Pope Pius VII, by contact printing in direct sunlight without a camera or lens. It is later destroyed; the earliest surviving example of his \"heliographic process\" is from 1825.\n* 1824 – Niépce makes the first durable, light-fast camera photograph, similar to his surviving 1826–1827 photograph on pewter but created on the surface of a lithographic stone. It is destroyed in the course of subsequent experiments.\n* 1826 – Mary Somerville, a Scottish science writer and polymath conducted a series of experiments to explore the relationship between light and magnetism and she published her first paper, \"The magnetic properties of the violet rays of the solar spectrum\", in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.\n* 1826 or 1827 – Niépce makes what is now the earliest surviving photograph from nature, a landscape. It requires an exposure in the camera that lasts at least eight hours and probably several days.\n* 1834 – Hércules Florence, a French-Brazilian painter and the isolate inventor of photography in Brazil, coined the word photographia for his technique, at least four years before John Herschel coined the English word photography, producing light-fast, permanent images of nature and \"real world scenes\".\n* 1835 – Henry Fox Talbot produces durable silver chloride camera negatives on paper and conceives the two-step negative-positive procedure used in most non-electronic photography up to the present.\n* 1839\n** Louis Daguerre publicly introduces his daguerreotype process, which produces highly detailed permanent photographs on silver-plated sheets of copper. At first, it requires several minutes of exposure in the camera, but later improvements reduce the exposure time to a few seconds. Photography suddenly enters the public consciousness and Daguerre's process is soon being used worldwide.\n** Talbot publicly introduces the paper-based process he worked out in 1835, calling it \"photogenic drawing\", but it requires much longer exposures than the daguerreotype and the results are not as clear and detailed.\n** Hippolyte Bayard presents the first public exhibition of photographs. He claims to have invented a photographic process prior to Daguerre and Talbot.\n** Sarah Anne Bright creates a series of photograms, six of which are known to still exist. These are the earliest surviving photographic images created by a woman.\n** John Herschel introduces hyposulfite of soda (now known as sodium thiosulfate but still nicknamed \"hypo\") as a highly effective fixer for all silver-based processes. He also makes the first glass negative.\n** Mungo Ponton a Scottish inventor, discovered that dichromates are light sensitive leading to Gum bichromate printing another permanent form of photography and additions for improvements in others including contrast increase with cyanotype, and salt printing.\n* 1841 – Talbot introduces his patented calotype (or \"talbotype\") paper negative process, an improved version of his earlier process that greatly reduces the required exposure time.\n* 1843 – Anna Atkins Publishes first photobook. British Algae.\n* 1845 – Francis Ronalds invents the first successful camera for continuous recording of the variations in meteorological and geomagnetic parameters over time\n* 1848 – Edmond Becquerel makes the first full-color photographs, but they are only laboratory curiosities: an exposure lasting hours or days is required and the colors are so light-sensitive that they sometimes fade right before the viewer's eyes while being examined.\n* 1851 – Introduction of the collodion process by Frederick Scott Archer, used for making glass negatives, ambrotypes and tintypes.\n* 1850s – Combination printing was introduced, probably first suggested by Hippolyte Bayard when he thought of using a separate negative of a properly exposed sky in combination with a proper negative of the landscape or monument documented for the Missions Héliographiques that started in 1851.\n* 1854\n** British Journal of Photography (initially established as the Liverpool Photographic Journal) first issue was published on 14 January 1854\n** André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri credited with introduction of the carte de visite (English: visiting card or calling card) format for portraiture. Disdéri uses a camera with multiple lenses that can photograph eight different poses on one large negative. After printing on albumen paper, the images are cut apart and glued to calling-card-size mounts.\n* 1857 – In America David Acheson Woodward patents the solar camera, derived from the earlier solar microscope, using sunlight to make enlargements from glass negatives\n* 1861 – James Clerk Maxwell presents a projected additive color image of a multicolored ribbon, the first demonstration of color photography by the three-color method he suggested in 1855. It uses three separate black-and-white photographs taken and projected through red, green and blue color filters. The projected image is temporary but the set of three \"color separations\" is the first durable color photograph.\n* 1868 – Louis Ducos du Hauron patents his numerous ideas for color photography based on the three-color principle, including procedures for making subtractive color prints on paper. They are published the following year. Their implementation is not technologically practical at that time, but they anticipate most of the color processes that are later introduced.\n* 1871 – The gelatin emulsion is invented by Richard Maddox.\n* 1873 – Hermann Wilhelm Vogel discovers dye sensitization, allowing the blue-sensitive but otherwise color-blind photographic emulsions then in use to be made sensitive to green, yellow and red light. Technical problems delay the first use of dye sensitization in a commercial product until the mid-1880s; fully panchromatic emulsions are not in common use until the mid-20th century.\n* 1876 – Hurter & Driffield begin systematic evaluation of sensitivity characteristics of photographic emulsions — the science of sensitometry.\n* 1878\n** Heat ripening of gelatin emulsions is discovered. This greatly increases sensitivity and makes possible very short \"snapshot\" exposures.\n** Eadweard Muybridge uses a row of cameras with trip-wires to make a high-speed photographic analysis of a galloping horse. Each picture is taken in less than the two-thousandth part of a second, and they are taken in sufficiently rapid sequence (about 25 per second) that they constitute a brief real-time \"movie\" that can be viewed by using a device such as a zoetrope, a photographic \"first\".\n* 1887 – Celluloid film base introduced.\n* 1888\n** The Kodak n°1 box camera, the first easy-to-use camera, is introduced with the slogan, \"You press the button, we do the rest.\"\n** Louis Le Prince makes Roundhay Garden Scene. It is believed to be the first-ever motion picture on film.\n* 1889 – The first commercially available transparent celluloid roll film is introduced by the Eastman Company, later renamed the Eastman Kodak Company and commonly known as Kodak.\n* 1891\n** Gabriel Lippmann announces a \"method of reproducing colors photographically based on the phenomenon of interference\".\n** William Kennedy Laurie Dickson develops the \"kinetoscopic\" motion picture camera while working for Thomas Edison.\n* 1895 – Auguste and Louis Lumière invent the cinématographe.\n* 1898 – Kodak introduces the Folding Pocket Kodak.\n20th century\n* 1900 – Kodak introduces their first Brownie, a very inexpensive user-reloadable point-and-shoot box camera.\n* 1901 – Kodak introduces the 120 film format.\n* 1902 – Arthur Korn devises practical telephotography technology (reduction of photographic images to signals that can be transmitted by wire to other locations).Wire-Photos are in wide use in Europe by 1910, and transmitted to other continents by 1922.\n* 1903 – The Lumière brothers invent color cameras.\n* 1907 – The Autochrome plate is introduced. It becomes the first commercially successful color photography product.\n* 1908 – Kinemacolor, a two-color process known as the first commercial \"natural color\" system for movies, is introduced.\n* 1909 – Kodak announces a 35&nbsp;mm \"safety\" motion picture film on an acetate base as an alternative to the highly flammable nitrate base. The motion picture industry discontinues its use after 1911 due to technical imperfections.\n* 1912\n** Vest Pocket Kodak using 127 film.\n** Thomas Edison introduces a short-lived 22&nbsp;mm home motion picture format using acetate \"safety\" film manufactured by Kodak.\n* 1913 – Kodak makes 35&nbsp;mm panchromatic motion picture film available on a bulk special order basis.\n* 1914\n** Kodak introduces the Autographic film system.\n** The World, the Flesh and the Devil, made in Kinemacolor, is the first dramatic feature film in color released.\n* 1922 – Kodak makes 35&nbsp;mm panchromatic motion picture film available as a regular stock.\n* 1923\n** The 16&nbsp;mm amateur motion picture format is introduced by Kodak.
