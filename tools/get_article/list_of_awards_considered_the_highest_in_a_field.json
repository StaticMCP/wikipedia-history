The original Nobel prizes to be administered by the Nobel Foundation thus include:\n* Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n* Nobel Prize in Physics\n* Nobel Prize in Literature\n* Nobel Peace Prize\n* Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\nThe foundation also sponsors the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\"; so, this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.\nPrizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. Some have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.
