The band split up later the same year and the album remained unreleased until 1976, although two tracks received some earlier exposure via their inclusion on the influential 1975 compilation The Electric Muse.\nRecording and production\nThe album was produced and engineered by John Wood, and was recorded at Sound Techniques Studio, Chelsea, London and Island Studio, St Peter's Square, London. The album cover was designed by Ian Logan Associates with photographs by Keith Morris, and the original LP sleeve notes were by Rod McShane. One track, \"Reaphook and Sickle\" was recorded three years later, prior to the release of the record, by Kirkpatrick and Harris alone assisted by Dave Mattacks on percussion, to fill a gap left by the dropping of one originally recorded track \"All of a Row\", which the band felt unhappy with and had since been re-worked by Carthy for inclusion on a solo album in the mean time.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks traditional, arranged by Carthy, Harris, Hutchings, Kirkpartrick, Nicol and Swallow except \"Albion Sunrise\" and \"New St. George\" composed by Richard Thompson.\nSide 1\n#\"Albion Sunrise\" – 2:54\n#Morris Medley: \"Mouresque\" / \"London Pride\" / \"So Selfish Runs The Hare\" (song) / \"Maid of the Mill\" / \"Sheriff's Ride\" – 7:14\n#\"I Was a Young Man\" (Roud 1572) – 4:03\n#\"New St. George\" – 2:37\n#\"La Rotta\" – 1:37\nSide 2\n#\"Gallant Poacher\" – 4:26 (Roud 793)\n#\"Cheshire Rounds\" / \"The Old Lancashire Hornpipe\" – 2:42\n#\"Hangèd I Shall Be\" – 6:20\n#\"Reaphook and Sickle\" – 2:44 (Roud 1375)\n#\"Battle of the Somme\" (instrumental, W.
