Harald, along with other Norwegian factions, formally rebelled against the new emperor. This rebellion resulted in an invasion of the Duchy of Saxony, the heartland of the Ottonian dynasty, by a Viking army.\nIn response, Emperor Otto II mobilized an army and led an expedition to Denmark. There, he encountered significant resistance. Otto II’s forces suffered a surprising defeat at the gates of Wiglesdor near the Danevirke, a Danish fortification, in 974. Following the defeat, the Norwegian forces withdrew, leaving the Danes to defend their territory. Seizing the opportunity to retaliate, Otto II launched another campaign against Harald's forces the following year. This time, the imperial military succeeded in overcoming the Danish defenses.\nThe Empire's victory culminated in the breaching of the Dannevirke, marking the first time imperial soldiers had crossed the wall. In the aftermath of the battle, Otto II captured significant portions of Jutland, weakening Harald's position and consolidating imperial control over the region.\nAftermath\nDefeated, Harald Bluetooth once again submitted to the Ottonians.\nEarl Haakon had helped against the Germans with a Norwegian army, but shortly after the Danish defeat and Harald forcing him to convert to Christianity, he rebelled against Harald Bluetooth in 975 and made Norway an independent kingdom.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://politikenhistorie.dk/art8319975/Den-Tysk-Romerske-kejser-var-danske-vikingekongers-overhoved Den Tysk-Romerske kejser var danske vikingekongers overhoved], via politikenhistorie.dk\n* [https://vikinghistorytales.blogspot.com/2013/12/974-emperor-otto-2-led-army-to-denmark.html Viking history : 974 - Emperor Otto 2 led an army to Denmark], via vikinghistorytales.blogspot.com\n* [https://medievalreporter.com/the-danevirke/ Keep Out!
