Geddes analysed the images and text of the Psalter to argue that the book was made for the medieval anchoress and prioress Christina of Markyate.\nDiane Watt said of the St Albans Psalter project that ‘This electronic publication marked a significant moment in scholarship on women’s literary culture in post-Conquest England’. In a review of the printed version of Geddes's project for the Studies in Iconography journal, Patricia Stirnemann wrote that 'the book is something of a new genre. It is what one might call a \"hardcopy-internet\" interface [...] that complements the website\".\nPublications\n*Geddes, J 2017, Hunting Picts: Medieval Sculpture at St Vigeans, Angus. vol. 1&2, Historic Environment Scotland, Edinburgh.\n*Geddes, J (ed.) 2016, Medieval Art, Architecture and Archaeology in the Dioceses of Aberdeen and Moray.
