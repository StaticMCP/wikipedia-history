Despite its religious affiliation, the school accepted pupils of all faiths. The school was closed on 31 January 2019 after attempts to sell it to an overseas education provider were unsuccessful.\nHistory\nThe Brigidine Sisters established a convent and school at Windsor in 1948, the second such founded by the order in England and Wales. Queensmead, the Victorian bricked mansion the Sisters moved into, remained  one of the school's main buildings. The school became run by lay staff but retained its Catholic ethos and religious character.\nDuring the early 2000s, the school experienced financial difficulties; pupil and staff numbers declined and the school was threatened with closure. In 2011 parents and governors discussed a possibility of the school entering the state sector but an agreement could not be reached.\nIn 2012, further funding was secured and the school remained open and independent.\nIn 2018 it was renamed from Brigidine to Queensmead.\nClosure\nAfter years of financial difficulties, the school closed permanently on 31 January 2019.\nAt the time of closure, the Head of Education was Simon Larter, and the Head of Business Affairs Dawn Fleming.\nAlumni\n*Tamara Mellon, fashion designer\n*Susan Sheridan, actress\nSee also\n* Catholic Church in England\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://queensmeadwindsor.org.uk Official website]\n*[https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/CARE/EY381885 Ofsted Report 2009 (as Brigidine School)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130926165702/http://www.isc.co.uk/schools/england/berkshire/windsor/the-brigidine-school-windsor Profile] on the ISC website"
