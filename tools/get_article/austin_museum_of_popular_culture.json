The center has evolved to become a collecting and exhibiting center for photography, prints, and non-traditional art and has widened the visibility of the Austin cultural scene.\nThe Austin Museum of Popular Culture is an independent resource available to those who want to learn more about the city's cultural history and is not supported by any governmental organizations.\nArmadillo Art Squad\nAn extensive 1997 review of the Armadillo Art Squad named many of its artists and cartoonists (often one and the same), including Gilbert Shelton, Jim Franklin, Guy Juke, Kerry Awn, , Ken Featherston, Henry Gonzales, Danny Garrett, Sam Yeates, Micael Priest,  Gary McIlhenny, and Jack Jaxon.\nThis group of local Austin artists designed posters and handbills for Eddie Wilson's Armadillo World Headquarters at a time when the Austin music scene was fueled by the Cosmic Cowboy movement.\nMemorial Wall\nAusPop's outdoor memorial, \"Wall of Fame\", as Austin humorist John Kelso calls it, has photos of over 150 people. It honors their contribution to Austin's creative scene. The outdoor wall includes both the famous and the obscure, from Bill Hicks, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Janis Joplin to Bill Livingood, Bud Shrake, and Poodie Locke, Willie Nelson's stage manager.\nName changes\nThe museum was originally named the South Austin Museum of Popular Culture.\nIn 2010 it was renamed the South Austin Popular Culture Center and became locally known as SouthPop. Subsequently the name changed back to South Austin Museum of Popular Culture.\nIn September 2019 executive director Leea Mechling announced that the museum would be renamed the Austin Museum of Popular Culture and would relocate to a new space on North Lamar behind Threadgill’s restaurant.\nRecognition\nThe museum is the subject of many articles in the Austin Chronicle, who in 2004 distinguished the museum as the \"Best Place to Art Trip.\"\nThe New York Times included SAMOPC in a Frugal Traveler video.\nSee also\n* List of music museums\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/south-austin-popular-culture-center Austin Museum of Popular Culture at Google Cultural Institute]\nReferences"
