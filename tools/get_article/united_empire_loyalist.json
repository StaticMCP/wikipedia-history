At that time, the demonym Canadian or Canadien was used by the descendants of New France settlers inhabiting the Province of Quebec.\nThey settled primarily in Nova Scotia and the Province of Quebec. The influx of loyalist settlers resulted in the creation of several new colonies. In 1784, New Brunswick was partitioned from the Colony of Nova Scotia after significant loyalist resettlement around the Bay of Fundy. The influx of loyalist refugees also resulted in the Province of Quebec's division into Lower Canada (present-day Quebec), and Upper Canada (present-day Ontario) in 1791. The Crown gave them land grants of one lot. One lot consisted of  per person to encourage their resettlement, as the Government wanted to develop the frontier of Upper Canada. This resettlement added many English speakers to the Canadian population. It was the beginning of new waves of immigration that established a predominantly Anglo-Canadian population in the future Canada both west and east of the modern Quebec border.\nHistory\nAmerican Revolution\nrefugees on their way to the Canadas during the American Revolution.]]\nFollowing the end of the American Revolutionary War and the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, both Loyalist soldiers and civilians were evacuated from New York City, most heading for Canada. Many Loyalists had already migrated to Canada, especially from New York and northern New England, where violence against them had increased during the war.\nThe Crown-allotted land in Canada was sometimes allotted according to which Loyalist regiment a man had fought in. This Loyalist resettlement was critical to the development of present-day Ontario, and some 10,000 refugees went to Quebec (including the Eastern Townships and modern-day Ontario). But Nova Scotia (including modern-day New Brunswick) received three times that number: about 35,000–40,000 Loyalist refugees.\nMany of these loyalist immigrants did not stay in Canada; they eventually returned to the United States. Some families were split in their loyalties during the war years. Many Loyalists in Canada maintained ties with relatives in the United States. They conducted commerce across the border with little regard to British trade laws. In the 1790s, Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe's offer of land and low taxes, which were one-quarter the level of those in the U.S., in exchange for allegiance resulted in the arrival of 30,000 Americans, often referred to as Late Loyalists. By the outbreak of the War of 1812, of the 110,000 inhabitants of Upper Canada, 20,000 were the initial Loyalists, 60,000 were later U.S. immigrants and their descendants, and 30,000 were UK immigrants and their descendants, or immigrants from the Old Province of Quebec. The later movement of many to Upper Canada suggests that land was the main reason for immigration.\nResettlement\n, showing a romanticised view of the Loyalists' arrival in New Brunswick.]]\nThe arrival of the Loyalists after the Revolutionary War led to the division of Canada into the provinces of Upper Canada (what is now southern Ontario) and Lower Canada (today's southern Quebec). They arrived and were largely settled in groups by ethnicity and religion. Many soldiers settled with others of the regiments they had served with. The settlers came from every social class and all thirteen colonies, unlike the depiction of them in the Sandham painting which suggests the arrivals were well-dressed upper-class immigrants.\nLoyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the British legal system, which they were accustomed to in the American colonies, rather than the French system. Great Britain had maintained the French legal system and allowed freedom of religion after taking over the former French colony with the defeat of France in the Seven Years' War. With the creation of Upper and Lower Canada, most Loyalists in the west could live under British laws and institutions. The predominantly ethnic French population of Lower Canada, who were still French-speaking, could maintain their familiar French civil law and Catholic religion.\nRealizing the importance of some type of recognition, on 9 November 1789, Lord Dorchester, the governor of Quebec and Governor General of British North America, declared \"that it was his Wish to put the mark of Honour upon the Families who had adhered to the Unity of the Empire\". As a result of Dorchester's statement, the printed militia rolls carried the notation:\nThose Loyalists who have adhered to the Unity of the Empire, and joined the Royal Standard before the Treaty of Separation in the year 1783, and all their Children and their Descendants by either sex, are to be distinguished by the following Capitals, affixed to their names: UE or U.E. Alluding to their great principle The Unity of the Empire.\nBecause most of the nations of the Iroquois had allied with the British, which had ceded their lands to the United States, thousands of Iroquois and other pro-British Native Americans were expelled from New York and other states. They were also resettled in Canada. Many of the Iroquois, led by Joseph Brant Thayendenegea, settled at Six Nations of the Grand River, the largest First Nations reserve in Canada. A smaller group of Iroquois led by Captain John Deserontyon Odeserundiye, settled on the shores of the Bay of Quinte in modern-day southeastern Ontario.\nwood cutter at Shelburne, Nova Scotia, in 1788.]]\nThe government settled some 3,500 Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but they faced discrimination and the same inadequate support that all Loyalists experienced. Delays in making land grants, but mostly the willingness of the blacks to under-cut their fellow Loyalists and hire themselves out to the few available jobs at a lower wage aggravated racist tensions in Shelburne. Mobs of white Loyalists attacked Black Loyalists in the Shelburne Riots in July 1784, Canada's first so-called \"race\" riot. The government was slow to survey the land of Black Loyalists (which meant they could not settle); it was also discriminatory in granting them smaller, poorer, and more remote lands than those of white settlers; not counting those Loyalists who were resettled in what would become Upper Canada, in general, or around the Bay of Quinte, in specific. This increased their difficulties in becoming established. The majority of Black Loyalists in Canada were refugees from the American South; they suffered from this discrimination and the harsh winters.\nWhen Great Britain set up the colony of Sierra Leone in Africa, nearly 1,300 Black Loyalists emigrated there in 1792 for the promise of self-government. And so 2,200 remained. The Black Loyalists that left established Freetown in Sierra Leone. Well into the 20th century, together with other early settlers from Jamaica and slaves liberated from illegal slave ships, and despite vicious attacks from the indigenous peoples that nearly ended the Maroon colony, they and their descendants dominated the culture, economy and government of Sierra Leone.\nNumerous Loyalists had been forced to abandon substantial amounts of property in the United States. Britain sought restoration or compensation for this lost property from the United States, which was a major issue during the negotiation of the Jay Treaty in 1795. Negotiations settled on the concept of the United States negotiators \"advising\" the U.S. Congress to provide restitution. For the British, this concept carried significant legal weight, far more than it did to the Americans; the U.S. Congress declined to accept the advice.\nSlavery\n, 1793, an anti-slavery act passed in Upper Canada. The act was created partially in response to Loyalist refugees who brought slaves with them.]]\nSlave-owning Loyalists from across the former Thirteen Colonies brought their slaves with them to Canada, as the practice was still legal there. They took a total of about 2,000 slaves to British North America: 500 in Upper Canada (Ontario), 300 in Lower Canada (Quebec), and 1,200 in the Maritime colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. The presence and condition of slaves in the Maritimes would become a particular issue. They constituted a larger portion of the population, but it was not an area of plantation agriculture.\nThe settlers eventually freed many of these slaves. Together with the free Black Loyalists, many chose to go to Sierra Leone in 1792 and following years, seeking a chance for self-government. Meanwhile, the British Parliament passed the Settlers in American Colonies Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3. c. 27) that assured prospective immigrants to Canada that they could retain their slaves as property. In 1793, an anti-slavery law was passed, in the 1st Parliament of Upper Canada. The Act Against Slavery banned the importation of slaves into the colony, and mandated the emancipation of all children born henceforth to female slaves upon reaching the age of 25. The Act was partially introduced due to the influx of the number of slaves brought by Loyalist refugees to Upper Canada. The slave trade was abolished across the British Empire in 1807. The institution of slavery was abolished Empire-wide by 1834 (except in India, where it was considered an indigenous institution).\nWar of 1812\n's charge across a frozen river during the Battle of Ogdensburg. The unit's membership was restricted to Loyalist and British settlers.]]\nFrom 1812 to 1815, the United States and the United Kingdom were engaged in a conflict known as the War of 1812. On 18 June 1812, US President James Madison signed the declaration of war into law, after receiving heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.\nBy 1812, Upper Canada had been settled mostly by Revolution-era Loyalists from the United States (United Empire Loyalists) and postwar American and British immigrants. The Canadas were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army and the sedentary units of the Canadian Militia. American leaders assumed that Canada could be easily overrun, with former president Thomas Jefferson optimistically describing the potential conquest of Canada as \"a matter of marching\". Many Loyalist Americans had migrated to Upper Canada after the Revolutionary War. However, there was also a significant number of non-Loyalist American settlers in the area due to the offer of land grants to immigrants. The Americans assumed the latter population would favour the American cause, but they did not. Although the population of Upper Canada included recent settlers from the United States who had no obvious loyalties to the Crown, the American forces found strong opposition from settlers during the War of 1812.\nA number of loyalists served as fencibles, provincial regulars, in the Provincial Marine, or with the sedentary militia. With the successful defence of the Canadian colonies from American invasion, the War of 1812 is seen by Loyalists as a victory. After the war, the British government transported to New Brunswick and settled about 400 of 3,000 former slaves from the United States whom they freed during and after the war. It had fulfilled its promise to them of freedom if they left Patriot slaveholders and fought with the British. Enslaved African Americans risked considerable danger by crossing to British lines to achieve freedom.\nPresent\nWhile the honorific \"United Empire Loyalist\" is not part of the official Canadian honours system, modern-day descendants of Loyalist refugees may employ it, sometimes using \"U.E.\" as postnominal letters. The practice, however, is uncommon today, even in original Loyalist strongholds like southeastern Ontario. Historians and genealogists use it extensively as a shorthand for identifying the ancestry of particular families.\n, in 1883.]]\nThe influence of the Loyalists on the evolution of Canada remains evident. Their ties with Britain and antipathy to the United States provided the strength needed to keep Canada independent and distinct in North America. The Loyalists' basic distrust of republicanism and \"mob rule\" influenced Canada's gradual, \"paper-strewn\" path to independence. The new British North American provinces of Upper Canada (the forerunner of Ontario) and New Brunswick were created as places of refuge for the United Empire Loyalists. The mottoes of the two provinces reflect this history:  Ontario's, also found on its coat of arms, is Ut incepit fidelis sic permanet (\"Loyal she began, loyal she remains\"); New Brunswick's, Spem Reduxit (\"Hope restored\").\nThe word \"Loyalist\" appears frequently in school, street, and business names in such Loyalist-settled communities as Belleville, Ontario. The nearby city of Kingston, established as a Loyalist stronghold, was named in honour of King George III. And on the outskirts of that city is a township simply named \"Loyalist\".\nCanada's 2021 Census estimates a population of 10,015 who identify as having United Empire Loyalist origins, based on a 25% sample.\nOn 1 July 1934, Royal Mail Canada issued \"United Empire Loyalists, 1776–1784\" designed by Robert Bruce McCracken based on Sydney March's sculpture United Empire Loyalists.\nIn 1996, Canadian politicians Peter Milliken (a descendant of American Loyalists) and John Godfrey sponsored the Godfrey–Milliken Bill, which would have entitled Loyalist descendants to reclaim ancestral property in the United States which had been confiscated during the American Revolution. The bill, which did not pass the House of Commons, was intended primarily as a satirical response to the contemporaneous American Helms–Burton Act.\non UEL Day]]\nIn 1997, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed a bill declaring 19 June, \"United Empire Loyalist Day\" in Ontario. United Empire Loyalist Day is also celebrated on the same day in Saskatchewan, on 18 May in New Brunswick and on 22 July in British Columbia.\nMemory and historiography\nThe Loyalists paid attention to their history developing an idealized image of themselves in which they took great pride. In 1898, Henry Coyne provided a glowing depiction:\n}}\nAccording to Canadian historians Margaret Conrad and Alvin Finkel, Coyne's memorial incorporates essential themes that have often been incorporated into patriotic celebrations. The Loyalist tradition, as explicated by Murray Barkley and Norman Knowles, includes:\nto the United Empire Loyalists in Hamilton, Ontario.]]\nConrad and Finkel point out some exaggerations: only a small percentage of the Loyalists were colonial elite. In fact Loyalists were drawn from every stratum of colonial society, and few suffered violence and hardship. About 20 percent would later return to the United States. Most were loyal to all things British, but other Loyalists supported the United States in the War of 1812.  Conrad and Finkel conclude:\nFrom the 1870s, many of their descendants returned to the United States in pursuit of cheaper land. In the New England states alone, more than 10% of the population can trace their roots to the Maritime Provinces. Two million more of 14 million inhabitants, or roughly 15%, are part or wholly of French Canadian descent.\nUnited Empire Loyalists' Association\n| status                   = Charity\n| purpose                  = Cultural, historical, hereditary association\n| headquarters             = George Brown House50 Baldwin Street, Suite 202Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n| coordinates              =\n| leader_title             = President\n| leader_name              = Patricia Groom\n}}\nThe United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada (UELAC) is an organization of Loyalist descendants and others interested in Canadian history, in particular the role of the United Empire Loyalists. The organization was incorporated on 27 May 1914 by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. In 1972, the organization was granted a coat of arms from the College of Arms through a letter patent, dated 28 March 1972.\nSymbols\nOn 17 April 1707, Queen Anne issued a proclamation referencing the use of the Union Flag \"at Sea and Land\". The Union Flag began to appear on forts and as regimental colours from this point, and at the time of the American Revolution, this was the flag in use. When those loyal to the Crown left the United States for British North America, they took this flag with them, and because of this historical connection, it continues to be the official flag of the UELAC.\nIn Canadian heraldry, Loyalist descendants are entitled to use a Loyalist coronet in their coat of arms.\nFile:Military Coronet of a Loyalist.svg|Loyalist military coronet\nFile:Civil Coronet of a Loyalist.svg|Loyalist civil coronet\nList of Loyalist settlements in Canada\n18th-century names are listed first, alongside their present-day equivalents.\n*Adolphustown, Ontario\n*Antigonish, Nova Scotia\n*Beamsville, Ontario\n*Bocabec, New Brunswick\n*Meyer's Creek → Belleville, Ontario\n*Buell's Bay → Brockville, Ontario\n*Butlersbury → Newark → Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario\n*Cataraqui → Kingston, Ontario\n*Clifton → Niagara Falls, Ontario\n*Country Harbour, Nova Scotia\n*Cobourg, Ontario\n*Colchester → village now within Essex, Ontario\n*Cornwall, Ontario\n*Digby, Nova Scotia\n*Doaktown, New Brunswick\n*Eastern Townships, Quebec\n*Effingham, Ontario\n*Fredericton, New Brunswick\n*Grimsby, Ontario\n*Douglas Township → Kennetcook, Nova Scotia\n*Lincoln, Ontario\n*Ernestown Township  → Loyalist, Ontario\n*Machiche → Yamachiche, Quebec\n*Merrittsville → Welland, Ontario\n*Milliken Corners Milliken, Ontario\n*Gravelly Bay → Port Colborne, Ontario\n*Port Roseway → Shelburne, Nova Scotia\n*Prescott, Ontario\n*Prince Edward County, Ontario\n*Rawdon, Nova Scotia\n*Saint John, New Brunswick\n*Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia\n*Shelburne, Nova Scotia\n*Six Nations and Brantford, Ontario\n*Smithville, Ontario\n*St. Andrews by-the-Sea → St. Andrews, New Brunswick\n*St. Anne's Point → Fredericton, New Brunswick\n*Summerville, Nova Scotia\n*The Twelve → Shipman's Corners → St. Catharines, Ontario\n*Turkey Point → Norfolk, Ontario\n*Sandwich → Windsor, Ontario\n*Odell Town, Quebec\n*Wainfleet, Ontario\n*Remsheg → Wallace, Nova Scotia\n*Westchester, Nova Scotia\n*York → Toronto, Ontario\nSee also\n* Expulsion of the Loyalists\n* Loyalist (American Revolution)\n* Canadian honorifics\n* Daughters of the American Revolution\n* Society of the Cincinnati\n* Sons of the American Revolution\n* Sons of the Revolution\n* History of monarchy in Canada\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Acheson, T.W. \"A Study in the Historical Demography of a Loyalist County\", Social History, 1 (April 1968), pp.&nbsp;53–65.\n* Compeau, Timothy J. \"Dishonoured Americans: Loyalist Manhood and Political Death in Revolutionary America.\" (PhD Diss.
