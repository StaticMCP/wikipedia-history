A port of Stellarium called Stellarium Mobile is available for Android and iOS. These have a limited functionality, lacking some features of the desktop version. All versions use OpenGL to render a realistic projection of the night sky in real time.\nStellarium was featured on SourceForge in May 2006 as Project of the Month.\nHistory\nIn 2006, Stellarium 0.7.1 won a gold award in the Education category of the Les Trophées du Libre free software competition.\nA modified version of Stellarium has been used by the MeerKAT project as a virtual sky display showing where the antennae of the radio telescope are pointed.\nIn December 2011, Stellarium was added as one of the \"featured applications\" in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nPlanetarium dome projection\nThe fisheye and spherical mirror distortion features allow Stellarium to be projected onto domes.  Spherical mirror distortion is used in projection systems that use a digital video projector and a first surface convex spherical mirror to project images onto a dome. Such systems are generally cheaper than traditional planetarium projectors and fish-eye lens projectors and for that reason are used in budget and home planetarium setups where projection quality is less important.\nVarious companies which build and sell digital planetarium systems use Stellarium, such as e-Planetarium.\nDigitalis Education Solutions, which helped develop Stellarium, created a fork called Nightshade which was specifically tailored to planetarium use.\nVirGO\nVirGO is a Stellarium plugin, a visual browser for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Science Archive Facility which allows astronomers to browse professional astronomical data. It is no longer supported or maintained; the last version was 1.4.5, dated January 15, 2010.\nStellarium Mobile\nStellarium Mobile is a fork of Stellarium, developed by some of the Stellarium team members. It currently targets mobile devices running Symbian, Maemo, Android, and iOS. Some of the mobile optimisations have been integrated into the mainline Stellarium product.\nScreenshots\nFile:Stellarium 001.jpg|Constellation art in version 0.6.2\nFile:Stellarium 0.10.1 - Constellation art - English.png|Constellation art in version 0.10.1\nFile:Stellarium Mars.png|Mars and its moons in Stellarium 0.14\nFile:Stellarium Grid.png|Equatorial and Azimuthal Grids in Stellarium 0.14\nFile:Stellarium Night Mode.png|Screenshot of Night Mode in Stellarium 0.14\nLegacy\nEleanor Catton, the New Zealand author who wrote the 2013 Booker Prize recipient novel The Luminaries, stated she used star charts from Stellarium and Sky & Telescope while writing the novel to help reconstruct the sky within the timeframe the novel is set in.\nSee also\n* Space flight simulation game\n** List of space flight simulation games\n* Planetarium software\n* List of observatory software\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://stellarium-web.org/ Stellarium Web Online Planetarium]"
