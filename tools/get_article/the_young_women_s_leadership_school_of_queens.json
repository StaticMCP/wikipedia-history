The school is administered by the New York City Department of Education. Since 2013 Mala Panday has been the principal and the assistant principals are Jennifer Pineda and George Díaz. The school has Advisory, a class for individual talking and sharing feelings. In this class, students are free to speak their minds confidentially.  In addition to the state required course load, TYWLS of Queens also offers multiple advanced placement (AP) courses as well as an array of after school clubs.\nThe school is located on 87th Road near Parsons Boulevard and Hillside Avenue, in the former Jamaica Jewish Center building. The building was built in 1928, and renovated in 1998 in order to convert it into a school building.\nThere are four other schools in New York City with the title Young Women's Leadership School, in Harlem, Brooklyn, Astoria, and the Bronx.  The school in Harlem is the charter school.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/28/Q896/AboutUs/Overview/default.htm NYC Department of Education: Young Women's Leadership School of Queens]\n*"
