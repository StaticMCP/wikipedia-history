The District of Columbia primary was a closed primary, with the district awarding 33 delegates towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of which 17 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary\nVice president and presumptive nominee Al Gore won the primary with 95% of the vote, earning all 17 delegates. Senator Bill Bradley was not on the ballot while conspiracy theorist and perennial candidate Lyndon LaRouche Jr. came in second with 4%.\nProcedure\nThe District of Columbia's Democratic primary took place on May 2, 2000, the same date as the North Carolina primary and the Indiana Primary.\nVoting took place across the district from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. local time. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15% at municipal districts or the whole federal district in order to be considered viable. The 17 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the primary results. Of these, 5 and 6 were allocated to the two municipal districts (each consisting of 4 of Washington, D.C.'s wards) and another 2 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 4 at-large delegates.\nThe state party committee then met after the primary to vote on the 2 pledged PLEO delegates, to finally vote on the 13 municipal  district delegates, and to vote on the 5 at-large delegates. The delegation also included 15 unpledged PLEO delegates: 10 members of the Democratic National Committee, 3 \"members of Congress\" (consisting of the congressional nonvoting delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and two non-congressional shadow senators), the mayor Anthony A. Williams, 1 distinguished party leader, and 1 add-on.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Lyndon LaRouche Jr.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 District of Columbia Democratic presidential primary\n!
