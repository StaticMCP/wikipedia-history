The media is both intrigued and repulsed by his brash manner and what appears to be self-worship. Despite being a heavy underdog, the 22-year-old Clay shocks the sports world by defeating Liston by technical knockout in their February 1964 bout, becoming heavyweight champion and (metaphorically) \"king of the world\".\nHome video\nKing of the World was released on Region 2 DVD in Europe.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
