Her parents sent her and her sister Margretta to a private school in Philadelphia.\nStewart started making art in 1925. She studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, her focus being on pantomime, stage design, and fresco painting. In 1921, she traveled to Italy, Greece and France, where she became a student of the American School of Fine Arts.\nCareer\nStewart became well known for her drawings, paintings, block prints and linoleum prints. Dorothy signed her prints with the initials, D.N.S.\nDorothy Stewart and her sister Margretta Dietrich settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1925.\nIn 1936, she was considered one of the members of the WPA Artist Collective in New Mexico. She painted a mural for the entrance of Albuquerque's Little Theatre depicting a clash between Christians and Moors portrayed in New Mexican folk plays.\nShe acquired a type and printing press from a defunct Spanish language newspaper in Espanola in 1948, and this is when Dorothy started producing vibrant multicolored illustrated books. Stewart was one of the first women to run a private printing press in the Southwest. (Smith, 94)\nOf the two sisters, Dorothy was more social. She built a studio east of El Zaguán where the artist hosted concerts, lectures, shadow puppet plays, and exhibitions representing her wide range of interest. (Smith, 96) El Zaguán still retains an artist residency program with exhibits under the Historic Santa Fe Foundation.\nDeath\nIn  the winter of 1955, with a grave medical condition, Stewart was accompanied by her dear friend Maria Chabot to Oaxaca, Mexico where Dorothy was quoted as saying, “If I have to be sick, I would rather be sick here where I hear the street sounds of Mexico.”  As Dorothy's condition worsened, Chabot moved her to the American British Cowdry Hospital in Mexico City, where Stewart died of a brain hemorrhage on December 24, 1955.\nPublications\n*Hornacinas, Niches and Corners of Mexico City; publisher: Editorial Cultura Mexico City, Mexico 1933.
