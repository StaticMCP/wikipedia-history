It was \"a pseudo-political party in preparation for the coming elections for various positions in public office.\"\nFounded by a group of labour organisations, trade unions, and church figures, the membership of the organisation was largely based on the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee, including Ding Lik-kiu, the chairman of the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee and Lau Chin-shek, as well as social activist Rev. Lo Lung Kwong.\nThe association aimed at raising Hong Kong people's political awareness by participating in the territory-wide elections, and to achieve a free, democratic, just society with equal opportunities.\nReferences"
