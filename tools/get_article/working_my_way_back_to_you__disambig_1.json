On the UK top 50 chart it spent three weeks – all at No. 50. It is the only hit to feature the group's arranger Charles Calello in the temporary role of bassist/bass vocalist, having replaced original member Nick Massi.\nThe lyrics tell about a man who cheated on his girlfriend. When she leaves, he realizes that he did love her and is very remorseful about his past actions. He vows to win her love back. It is in some ways a re-casting of the melody from their previous hit, \"Let's Hang On!\".\nCash Box described it as a \"raunchy, blues-drenched ode about a love-sick fella who hopes to be re-united with his ex-gal,\" and said that it has \"money-in-the-bank-sound.\"\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1966)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Canada RPM Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n|U.S. Cash Box Top 100\n|align=\"center\"|10\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|50\n|}\nThe Spinners version\nIn 1979, American soul and R&B group the Spinners recorded \"Working My Way Back to You\" and added a new bridge composed by Michael Zager. Billed as a medley as \"Working My Way Back to You/Forgive Me, Girl\", this version was No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in April 1980. On the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, the medley (released in December 1979 in the U.S.) peaked at the No. 2 position in March and April 1980 for two weeks, behind \"Another Brick in the Wall\" by Pink Floyd. The Spinners' version also made it to No. 6 on the Soul Singles chart and No. 8 on the disco/dance chart. The version of the Spinners was taken up in French by the Canadian singer Jean Nichol under the title \"Je voudrais te retrouver\" (I want to find you).\nChart performance\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1979–1980)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australia (Kent Music Report\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|-\n|Canada RPM Adult Contemporary\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|German Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Netherlands\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|New Zealand Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Swiss Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1980)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|50\n|-\n|Canada\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|44\n|-\n|New Zealand\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|37\n|-\n|UK\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|-\n|}\nBoyzone version\n}}\n}}\nIrish boy band Boyzone released a cover version of \"Working My Way Back to You\" as their debut single in May 1994. The song reached No. 3 on the Irish Singles Chart. It is the only single of the group to feature Mikey Graham on lead vocals.\nThe band later recorded a French version in collaboration with Alliage. This French version of the track is credited as being a major turning point in the career of producer-songwriter Steve Mac. A lack of interest from the \"usual producers\" led to Polydor phoning up Mac and asking him to take on the role, and by doing so he effectively made a decisive progression from his early dance-pop singles to the mature balladry with which he has since made a very successful career.\nTrack listing\n* \"Working My Way Back to You\"\n#\"Working My Way Back to You\" – 4:12\n#\"Working My Way Back to You\" (POD 12\" Mix) – 8:13\n#\"Father and Son\" – 2:49\n* \"Te Garder Pres De Moi\"\n#\"Te Garder Près De Moi\" (featuring Alliage) – 4:41\n#\"Te Garder Près De Moi\" (Instrumental) – 4:41\nCharts\n* \"Working My Way Back to You\"\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1994)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\n*\"Te Garder Près De Moi\" (with Alliage)\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1997-1998)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|-\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|90\n|-\n|}\nPersonnel\nThe Four Seasons' version\n*Lead vocals by Frankie Valli\n*Background vocals by Tommy DeVito, Charles Calello and Bob Gaudio\n*Instrumentation by Charles Calello (bass), Bob Gaudio (keyboards), Tommy DeVito (guitar)\nThe (Detroit) Spinners' version\n*Lead vocals by John Edwards and Pervis Jackson\n*Background vocals by Bobby Smith, Pervis Jackson, Henry Fambrough and Billy Henderson\n*Instrumentation by various Philadelphia area musicians\nBoyzone version\n*Lead vocals by Stephen Gately and Mikey Graham\n*Background vocals by Keith Duffy, Mikey Graham, Shane Lynch and Ronan Keating\nReferences"
