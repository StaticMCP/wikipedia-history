Opened on 29 September 1987 and located on the High Street, the Treaty Centre offers 270,194 square feet of retail space and is anchored by Wilkinsons. It has an average weekly footfall of 195,000 people.\nHistory\nThe centre took two years to build, and more than 10 years in planning. The  site was built on the site of a former library and civic hall buildings dating back to 1905 which were demolished.\nIn 2006, a rival shopping centre called the Blenheim Centre was built to the north.\nIn 2011, the Treaty Centre was acquired by Quidnet Capital for £37 million and in the following years the centre was refurbished. In 2012, Quidnet raised concerns regarding a development agreement entered into by Hounslow Council and Legal & General (L&G) to develop shopping, leisure and residential facilities alongside the Blenheim Centre, as being in breach of Article 56 (\"freedom to provide services\") of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Their legal challenge was unsuccessful because the European single market was not a factor in the case and the development agreement did not commit L&G to provide any services to the Council or restrict the ability of any other business to provide services.England and Wales High Court (Technology and Construction Court), [https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/TCC/2012/2639.html AG Quidnet Hounslow LLP v London Borough of Hounslow 2012 EWHC 2639], delivered 28 September 2012, accessed 26 July 2023\nGallery\nInside the Treaty Centre, Hounslow.jpg|Inside the Treaty Centre\nChristmas at Treaty Centre.jpg|Inside the Treaty Centre during Christmas time\nCarousel in High Street Hounslow - geograph.org.uk - 1598857.jpg|A carousel on High Street, in front of the Treaty Centre's entrance\nReferences"
