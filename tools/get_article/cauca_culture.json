Middle Cauca culture dates from the 9 to 10th centuries CE.\nTheir territory was near the present day city of Popayán, in the Calima River Valley.\nSociety\nArchaeologists surmise that Cauca culture was organized into several related chiefdoms that traded and fought with each other. They farmed and made ceramics and goldwork.\nArtwork\nTheir art often featured avian imagery. Cauca culture art shared some similarities to Yotoco culture art. They are known for ceramic slab figurines, representing humans–both female and male–with dramatically angular features.\nGoldwork\nCauca goldsmiths hammered and cast gold to create a range of figures and ornaments, including diadems and bracelets. They created caricuri noserings from gold.\nSee also\n* Calima culture\n* Indigenous peoples in Colombia\n* List of pre-Columbian cultures\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Bruhns, Karen Olsen.
