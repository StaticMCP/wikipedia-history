It resulted in a victory for the Paramaras\nPrelude\nBefore the ascension of Jayavarman II of Malwa, his predecessor Jaitugideva suffered constant, consistent setbacks against his neighbors. Notably, his capital was sacked by the Vaghelas and he was defeated by Seuna ruler Kannara. However, as Jayavarman ascended the throne, the Paramaras slowly began to rebound.\nConflict\nDue to the presence of an inscription of Jayavarman II in Rahatgarh, we can say that he captured it from the Chandelas.\nReferences"
