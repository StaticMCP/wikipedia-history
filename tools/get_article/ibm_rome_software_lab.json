The main mission of the Rome Lab is focused on IBM Tivoli development, including Tivoli Configuration Manager, Tivoli Remote Control, Tivoli Workload Scheduler, and Tivoli Monitoring.\nIn 2004, the laboratory focused on the adoption of the IBM Rational Unified Process (RUP) in Tivoli and in the wider Software Group inside IBM. In 2007, IBM opened the \"Rome SOA Leadership Center\" hosted by and formed with a team of experts on service-oriented architecture (SOA) coming from the IBM Rome Software Laboratory. The Rome laboratory constantly collaborates with Italian Universities and Research Centers.\nAnother portion of this reality is the \"Rome Solutions Lab\", which includes two main areas: the \"Publishing\" area involved in the development, support and delivery of the IBM NICA (Networked Interactive Content Access); and the \"Industry Solutions\" area, an internal development organization, working on the development, support and delivery of software based on and providing extensions to IBM Software Group products.\nReferences"
