The state legislature chose 29 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. During this election, New York cast its 29 electoral votes to Independent Democratic Republican and Federalist supported candidate DeWitt Clinton, who was then currently serving as the Mayor of New York City and the Lieutenant Governor of New York.\nThe election ultimately hinged on both New York and neighboring Pennsylvania, and while Clinton was able to take his home state, he failed to take Pennsylvania and thus lost the election to traditional Democratic Republican candidate and incumbent President James Madison won by a narrow margin. This would be the first time New York would vote for a losing presidential candidate. It would also be the only time that happened until 1856.\n1812 was the first US presidential election where New York State was the most populous state in the nation, after overtaking Virginia in population total. New York would remain the most populous state in the nation until 1962, when overtaken by California, with California having more people cast votes than in New York State for the first time in 1968.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New York\nNotes\nReferences"
