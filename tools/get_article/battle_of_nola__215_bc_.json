It was Hannibal's second attempt to seize Nola after a failure the year before. He was again repelled and would make one more, also unsuccessful attempt the next year. For the Romans, it was a crucial success against Hannibal's army and gave them hope that they could win the war.\nAftermath\nHans Delbrück in 1920 described the three battles of Nola as Marcellus' alleged victories and very insignificant engagements.\nSee also\n* Battle of Nola (216 BC)\n* Battle of Nola (214 BC)\nCitations\nSources\n*"
