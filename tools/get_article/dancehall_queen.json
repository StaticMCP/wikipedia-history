Directed by Don Letts and Rick Elgood.\nPlot\nMarcia Green (Audrey Reid) is a single mom and street vendor barely scraping by even with a financial assist from the seemingly avuncular Larry (Carl Davis), a gun-toting strongman with a twisted desire for Marcia's teenage daughter Tanya (Cherine Anderson) who he then decides to pursue. Complicating things is Priest (Paul Campbell), a murderous hoodlum who killed Marcia's friend and now is terrorizing the defenseless woman. Facing three big problems (Larry, Priest, and without money), Marcia arrives at an inspired solution: develop an alter ego, a dancing celebrity called the Mystery Lady who can compete in a cash-prize contest and put both of the men against one another.\nShe does so and Marcia very amusingly carries out her complicated plan, with a little help from sympathetic friends.\nCast\n*Audrey Reid as Marcia, a struggling street vendor, who decides to use dancing to better her situation.
