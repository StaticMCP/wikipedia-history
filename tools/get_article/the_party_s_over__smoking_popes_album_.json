It is a collection of ten cover tunes that was recorded in 1998 as a perfunctory effort to fulfill the Popes' part of their recording contract with Capitol Records. The album was rejected by the label, and the band was released from their contract as they had hoped; the album was released five years later, in 2003, by Double Zero Records.\nCritical reception\nThe album received a lukewarm review from Tim DiGravina of AllMusic. Gravina posed the question of whether the album was worth waiting the five years it took to release it, and wrote that \"while the answer is mostly no, there's still enough vigor and crackle on display to pump up the diehards.\" PopMatters wrote that as \"uneven as it is, the record is a worthy epitaph to yet another band that went away far too soon.\" The Daily Herald wrote that \"on this vaulted swan song of covers, the band exposes Judy Garland and Patsy Cline as the true predecessors to emo heartbreakers like Dashboard Confessional.\"\nTrack listing\n#Seven Lonely Days – 2:57 (Marshall Brown/Alden Shuman/Earl Shuman)\n#Valentine – 2:32 (Willie Nelson)\n#Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered – 3:29 (Lorenz Hart/Richard Rodgers)\n#The Party's Over – 3:26 (Betty Comden/Adolph Green/Julie Styne)\n#Farther Along – 3:36 (W.B.
