The leadership of ISIL eventually decided to replace Shekau as local commander with Abu Mus'ab al-Barnawi, whereupon the movement split completely. Shekau no longer recognized the authority of ISIL's central command, and his loyalists started to openly fight the followers of al-Barnawi. Regardless, Shekau did never officially renounce his pledge of allegiance to ISIL as a whole; his forces are thus occasionally regarded as \"second branch of ISWAP\". Overall, the relation of Shekau with ISIL remains confused and ambiguous.|name=factions}}\n* Shekau faction\n* Several minor factions\nISWAP\nAnsaru before officially announcing its foundation as separate group on 1 January 2012.
