Famous examples include Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as well as George W. Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford, Texas; Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan have also used the term for their private residences (Nixon and Reagan in California, Johnson in Texas).\nOther secondary \"White Houses\"\nThe first governmental spending on property improvements of private presidential residences was at Dwight Eisenhower's Gettysburg farm, where the Secret Service added three guard posts to a fence. Federal law now allows the president to designate a residence outside of the White House as his temporary offices, so that federal money can be used to provide required facilities.\nOther official residences occupied by presidents\nOfficial residences occupied while in other offices\nThis is a list of official residences occupied by individuals who later served as presidents with their families while they served in the office related to the residence.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
