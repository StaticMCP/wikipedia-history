The site was closed in 2021 due to the opening of the Badenoch and Strathspey Community Hospital in Aviemore.\nHistory\nThe facility, which was founded by Dr de Watteville, opened as the Grampian Sanatorium in 1901. It was acquired by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and only joined the National Health Service in 1986. In February 2015, it was announced that the hospital would close once a new health centre in Aviemore had been completed.\nReferences"
