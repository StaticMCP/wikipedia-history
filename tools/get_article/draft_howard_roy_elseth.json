      "text": "# Draft:Howard Roy Elseth\n\nHoward Roy Elseth (often credited as H. Roy Elseth or Howard R. Elseth) is an American Christian author and Bible collector. He wrote Did God Know? A Study of the Nature of God (1977), a work discussing divine foreknowledge that is cited in lay-level discussions of Open theism, and later 1611 Encrypted in the Holy Bible (2009). He is a co-founder of the 1611 King James Bible Museum, which showcases historic Bibles and related materials.\nEarly life and education\nPublicly available biographical notes report that Elseth was raised in northern Minnesota and professed Christian faith at a Billy Graham crusade in 1961. He graduated from Warren High School (Minnesota) in 1962, attended Covenant Bible College (Prince Albert, Saskatchewan), earned a B.A. in Speech and Biblical Literature from Seattle Pacific College (now Seattle Pacific University), and received an M.Div. from Asbury Theological Seminary. He undertook further study in Greek at the University of Minnesota and participated in archaeological work in Tel-Aviv through the American Institute of Holy Land Studies and Hebrew University. A publisher bio echoes his Minnesota background.\nMinistry and writing\nElseth’s 1977 book Did God Know? explores God’s omniscience, human freedom, and moral responsibility; it includes a frequently quoted analogy about parental foreknowledge and culpability in discussions of open theism. The work has been reissued in later printings and digital editions.\nIn 2009 he published 1611 Encrypted in the Holy Bible with Infinity Publishing, reflecting his interest in the history and reception of the King James Bible. Bibliographic records for both titles appear in library catalogs and bookseller databases.\n1611 King James Bible Museum\nElseth is identified as a co-founder of the 1611 King James Bible Museum, which presents historic Bibles and related materials and maintains public tour and media information online. The museum’s site and affiliated media include interviews and presentations featuring Elseth discussing the collection and the 1611 KJV.\nReception and use\nElseth’s analogy on foreknowledge and culpability from Did God Know? appears in lay-level discussions of open theism and has circulated in blogs and discussion fora that survey open theist literature; the book itself is used as a reference point in these contexts. (Note: scholarly secondary coverage directly about Elseth appears limited in publicly accessible sources.)\nSelected works\n* Did God Know? A Study of the Nature of God.
