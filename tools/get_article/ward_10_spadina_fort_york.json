It was last contested in 2022, with Ausma Malik elected councillor for the 2022–2026 term.\nHistory\nToronto municipal ward boundaries were significantly modified in 2018, passing through three models (44-ward, 47-ward, and 25-ward). Ultimately, for the purposes of administering the 2018 election, the 25-ward structure was used and later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2021.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the City of Toronto engaged in a ward boundary review evaluating the city's previous 44-ward model.\nBased on this, and in preparation for the 2018 municipal election, the City of Toronto added 3 new wards to  create a 47-ward model.  This model was in effect at the opening of the 2018 municipal election.\nThe 2018 Toronto municipal election ran from May 1, 2018, to October 22, 2018, and while underway the provincial government introduced the Better Local Government Act, 2018, S.O. 2018, c. 11 - Bill 5. The act was assented to on August 14, 2018.\nThe immediate effect of this act was to eliminate all previous ward models, and replace them with a 25-ward model designed to align with the provincial and federal ridings boundaries in effect at that time.\nThe timing of the boundary change was controversial, and the City of Toronto sued the province contesting the provisions' constitutionality. In the absence of an injunction, and with the pending threat of the province invoking the notwithstanding clause which would defeat any constitutional challenge, the election continued under the 25-ward model.\nThe nomination period originally scheduled to close on July 27, 2018, was extended to September 14, 2018. This allowed new candidates to run, and existing candidates to either withdraw or to reassign their candidacy to a different constituency.\nIn a judgment rendered October 1, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of the provisions, and the 25-ward model remained in effect for the 2022 Toronto municipal election.\nThe current ward is made up of the southern parts of the old Ward 19 Trinity—Spadina, Ward 20 Trinity—Spadina, Ward 27 Toronto Centre—Rosedale and Ward 28 Toronto Centre—Rosedale.\n2018 municipal election\nWard 10 Spadina—Fort York was first contested during the 2018 municipal election with 14 candidates. Joe Cressy was ultimately elected with 55.06 per cent of the vote.\nGeography\nWard 10 is part of the Toronto and East York community council.\nSpadina—Fort York's west boundary is Winona Drive, Ossington Avenue, Dundas Street and Davenport Road, and the east boundary is the Don River and the Port Lands neighbourhood. The north boundary is Dundas Street, Bay Street and The Esplanade, and the south boundary is Lake Ontario. The ward also comprises the Toronto Islands.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Council term\n!Member\n|-\n!\n!Ward 10 Spadina—Fort York\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2018–2022\n|Joe Cressy\n|-\n|Joe Mihevc (2022)\n|-\n|2022–2026\n|Ausma Malik\n|}\nElection results\n2022 Toronto municipal election\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Candidate\n!Vote\n!%\n|-\n|Ausma Malik\n|8,033\n|36.55\n|-\n|April Engelberg\n|4,690\n|21.34\n|-\n|Rocco Achampong\n|1,906\n|8.67\n|-\n|Peter George\n|1,757\n|7.99\n|-\n|Igor Samardzic\n|1,686\n|7.67\n|-\n|Karlene Nation\n|1,001\n|4.55\n|-\n|Stephanie Soltermann\n|661\n|3.01\n|-\n|Arber Puci\n|603\n|2.74\n|-\n|Laura-Maria Nikolareizi\n|471\n|2.14\n|-\n|Kyle Enslen\n|439\n|2.00\n|-\n|Robb Cooke\n|434\n|1.97\n|-\n|Andrei Zodian\n|297\n|1.35\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |2018 Toronto municipal election, Ward 10 Spadina—Fort York\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#ddf;\" |Candidate\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#ddf;\" |Votes\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#ddf;\" |Vote share\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Joe Cressy\n| align=\"right\" |15,903\n| align=\"right\" |55.06%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |April Engelberg\n| align=\"right\" |3,346\n| align=\"right\" |11.58%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Kevin Vuong\n| align=\"right\" |3,018\n| align=\"right\" |10.45%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Sabrina Zuniga\n| align=\"right\" |1,564\n| align=\"right\" |5.41%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |John Nguyen\n| align=\"right\" |1,032\n| align=\"right\" |3.57%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Karlene Nation\n| align=\"right\" |860\n| align=\"right\" |2.98%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Rick Myers\n| align=\"right\" |747\n| align=\"right\" |2.59%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Dean Maher\n| align=\"right\" |611\n| align=\"right\" |2.12%\n|-\n|Al Carbone\n| align=\"right\" |519\n| align=\"right\" |1.80%\n|-\n|Andrew Massey\n| align=\"right\" |473\n| align=\"right\" |1.64%\n|-\n|Michael Barcelos\n| align=\"right\" |451\n| align=\"right\" |1.56%\n|-\n|Edris Zalmai\n| align=\"right\" |147\n| align=\"right\" |0.51%\n|-\n|Andrei Zodian\n| align=\"right\" |133\n| align=\"right\" |0.46%\n|-\n|Ahdam Dour\n| align=\"right\" |80\n| align=\"right\" |0.28%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Total\n! align=\"right\" |28,884\n! align=\"right\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |Source: City of Toronto\n|}\nSee also\n* Municipal elections in Canada\n* Municipal government of Toronto\n* List of Toronto municipal elections\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/council/members-of-council/councillor-ward-10/ Councillor's webpage]"
