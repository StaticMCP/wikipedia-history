He became a liberal Rabbi with Jüdische Gemeinde zu Berlin, the Jewish unity congregation comprising the bulk of Jewish faithful in Berlin and combining Jews of mainstream (also called liberal, in today's English terminology 'conservative'), Orthodox and Reform affiliation. In 1938 the Nazis burned his preferred synagogue on Prinzregentenstraße and imprisoned him in Sachsenhausen concentration camp.\nIn February 1940 Swarsensky emigrated to the United States. For the next thirty-six years he worked as Rabbi for Temple Beth El, a Reform synagogue in Madison, Wisconsin. He married Ida Weiner (January 22, 1918 – June 15, 2010) in 1952 and had two children. Swarsensky died of cancer at the University of Wisconsin Hospital on November 10, 1981.\nThe Manfred E. Swarsensky Humanitarian Service Award, awarded for outstanding voluntary contributions on behalf of race relations, women's health, conservation or public service, is named after him and is awarded annually by the Rotary Club of Madison, of which Rabbi Swarsensky was a member.\nRabbi Swarsensky also served as Chair of Jewish Learning while teaching at Edgewood College.\nBiography\n* Mensch: Biography and Writings of Manfred Eric Swarsensky, Marvin Zolot, Edgewood College Press, 2009\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=475712 Guide to the Manfred Swarsensky Collection] at the Leo Baeck Institute, New York\n* [http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/HolocaustSurvivors/Swarsensky.asp#transcript Manfred Swarsenksy], Oral Histories: Wisconsin Survivors of the Holocaust, Wisconsin Historical Society"
