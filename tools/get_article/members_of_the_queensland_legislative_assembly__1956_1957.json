He and 25 members of Parliament formed the Queensland Labor Party on 26 April, whilst the remaining Labor members became the main Opposition party and elected Jack Duggan as leader. Gair continued as Premier but could not obtain supply from the Parliament, so an election was called.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Party\n! Electorate\n!
