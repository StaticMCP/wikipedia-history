A rock album of his own original material, it marked a return to songwriting after what Stewart termed \"a dark period of twenty years\"; he said that writing his autobiography gave him the impetus to write music again. The album entered the top 10 in the US and entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1, setting a new British record for the longest gap between chart-topping albums by an artist, as his last studio album to reach the top spot was A Night on the Town in 1976. The album was certified platinum in the UK on 16 August 2013 and double-platinum on 29 December 2017. Overall, the album was the No. 7 best-selling album of 2013 in the UK.  In the United States, the album has sold 141,000 copies as of September 2015.\nSingles and other releases\n\"It's Over\" is the album's lead European single and it joined BBC Radio 2's playlist in  April 2013 and Kingstown Radio's new music file; the single peaked at No. 91 on the UK Singles Chart. In North America, the album's lead single, \"She Makes Me Happy\", peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart; it also peaked at No. 32 on Billboard's Japan Hot 100. Both singles were accompanied by music videos directed by Cameron Duddy. The third single, \"Brighton Beach\", followed shortly after, with the music video directed by Zach Merck. \"Beautiful Morning\" was originally available by download in 2012 via a code found inside the CD booklet for his Christmas album Merry Christmas, Baby, albeit differing from the final mix included on the Time album.\nIn the UK, a deluxe 2-disc version of the album was released on 2 December 2013. It contains live tracks from his 2013 performance at The Troubadour, West Hollywood as well as all the bonus tracks previously available on the UK and US/Canada deluxe editions of the album; the live songs include 6 songs from the Time album as well as previous hits.
