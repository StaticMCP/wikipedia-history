This article is limited to the Western Pacific basin which is located north of the equator and between 100°E and the International Date Line. Systems that reach tropical storm intensity are assigned a name by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Tropical depressions that form within the basin are assigned a number with a \"W\" suffix by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Additionally, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones (including tropical depressions) that either form in or move into its self-defined area of responsibility, which runs from 135°E to 115°E and 5°N to 25°N.\nThe following timeline documents the major events in the season with regards to tropical cyclone formation, strengthening, weakening, landfall, extratropicality and dissipation. Please note that the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) is considered to be official for this tropical cyclone basin; Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) is only responsible for Philippines warnings while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) releases unofficial advisories for the United States Military in the Marianas, Japan and South Korea.\nAll landfalls are bolded and referred to in JMA terms. The JTWC storms are referred to numerically, to avoid confusion, as the JTWC sometimes recognises a storm at a different intensity compared to the JMA. For the purposes of the timeline, all events stemming from JTWC advisories will be documented by time of issuance, rather than by the operational time of observed information (3 hours before). The timeline does not deal with the end of PAGASA-monitored storms; if the JTWC or the JMA did not monitor such a storm it should be assumed that the storm did not cause major damage or make landfall, and simply dissipated or left the area of jurisdiction of PAGASA.\nFor the PAGASA, only 13 systems formed or entered in their area during 2007, which only 3 of them directly made landfall over the Philippines.\nTimeline\nImageSize = width:1030 height:315\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat =
