It was released in 2000 as the first single from their third studio album, Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia, and was re-released in 2002.\nRelease\n\"Get Off\" peaked at No. 38 on the UK Singles Chart in 2000 and No. 34 when it was re-released in 2002.\nReception\nNME wrote that the song sounds like \"a thousand Sioux Indians invading the whorehouse at the High Chaparal for a bongs'n'blow jobs toga keg party\", commenting \"does it really take a major bastard ad campaign for the radio big knobs to spot a decent tune when it chews their fucking faces off?\", in reference to The Dandy Warhols' relative obscurity prior to having their song \"Bohemian Like You\" featured in a Vodafone advert.\nMusic video\nThe video was filmed in Portland in April 2000. Scenes of the band members riding horses were filmed on St. Johns Bridge in northwest Portland on April 9, and scenes of them tethering horses, hanging out in a club, and performing in a room with an American flag background were filmed on April 11. The bridge scenes had to be filmed very early on a Sunday morning so the bridge closure wouldn't affect traffic or fishermen.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written and composed by Courtney Taylor-Taylor, except where indicated.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Get Off\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2000)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
