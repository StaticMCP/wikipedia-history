The route passes near the Charlottetown Airport, then proceeds north through the community of Brackley Beach. It is co-signed with Route 6 for  south of Brackley Beach. Route 15 terminates at the north shore, turning east and becoming the un-numbered Gulf Shore Parkway.\nUntil the 1990s, Route 15 began at an intersection with Route 2 (St. Peters Road) in Charlottetown,  south of the current terminus. When the Charlottetown Perimeter Highway was constructed, Route 2 was reassigned to the new road, and the Route 15 designation was dropped from Brackley Point Road south of the new ring road.\nMajor intersections\n|notes    = Southern terminus\n}}\nSherwood Road&nbsp;– Charlottetown Airport\n|notes    = Roundabout\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    =\n}}\n|notes    = Intersections offset;  concurrency\n}}\n|notes    = South end of Route&nbsp;6 concurrency\n}}\n|notes    = North end of Route&nbsp;6 concurrency\n}}\nReferences"
