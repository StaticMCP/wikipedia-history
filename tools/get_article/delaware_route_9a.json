The official designation of the route runs  along Terminal Avenue between DE&nbsp;9 and the Port of Wilmington, interchanging with I-495. Signage has the route continuing north along Christina Avenue to an intersection with U.S. Route&nbsp;13 (US&nbsp;13) and DE 9 for a total length of . Christina Avenue originally became a state highway in the 1920s, serving as part of US&nbsp;40 that connected to a ferry across the Delaware River to Penns Grove, New Jersey. US&nbsp;40 was removed from this road in the 1930s and later became part of DE&nbsp;48. It was subsequently removed in the 1950s following the discontinuance of the ferry. DE&nbsp;9A was designated by 1971.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;9A begins at an intersection with DE&nbsp;9 in the city of Wilmington, heading east-southeast as two-lane undivided Terminal Avenue through residential areas. The road widens into a four-lane divided highway and comes to an interchange with I-495. Past I-495, the road heads through industrial areas, becoming an undivided road as it crosses over Norfolk Southern's New Castle Secondary railroad line at a grade crossing. The road crosses Norfolk Southern's Christiana Avenue Industrial Track before reaching the entrance to the Port of Wilmington at the Christina Avenue intersection. At this point, DelDOT officially marks the end of DE&nbsp;9A, but signage shows it turning north onto Christina Avenue.\nDE&nbsp;9A proceeds north-northwest as a two-lane road, passing through more industrial areas and crossing under I-495 again, this time underneath the I-495 bridge over the Christina River. After this, the route has a grade crossing with a Norfolk Southern railroad spur before it crosses over Norfolk Southern's New Castle Secondary and Shellpot Secondary at grade crossings in marshland. The road continues between residential and commercial areas to the west and industrial areas to the east before terminating at both US&nbsp;13 and DE&nbsp;9 near the Christina River drawbridge leading into Wilmington's central business district.\nDE&nbsp;9A has an annual average daily traffic count of 8,151&nbsp;vehicles along Terminal Avenue. The portion of DE&nbsp;9A along Terminal Avenue between I-495 and the entrance to the Port of Wilmington at Christina Avenue is part of the National Highway System.\nHistory\nWhat is now DE&nbsp;9A was a county road by 1920. By 1924, the Christina Avenue portion of the route was constructed as a state highway. Christina Avenue became a portion of US&nbsp;40 in 1926, running from US&nbsp;13 to a ferry that went across the Delaware River to Penns Grove, New Jersey. By 1931, US&nbsp;40 was removed from this road. The road became the easternmost portion of DE&nbsp;48 by 1936, which connected to a ferry that linked the route to New Jersey Route&nbsp;48 in Penns Grove. DE&nbsp;48 was removed from this road by 1952 after the ferry between Wilmington and Penns Grove was discontinued in 1949. DE&nbsp;9A was designated around 1971 onto its current alignment.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Southern terminus\n}}\n|notes=I-495 exit&nbsp;2\n}}\n|notes=Signed northern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-009a/ DE&nbsp;9A at AARoads.com]\n* [https://www.alpsroads.net/roads/de/de_9/ Delaware Roads - DE&nbsp;9A]"
