A dirt road (closed to vehicles in the winter) goes past its base. A series of steps lead to observation platforms further up the waterfall, which is nearly  high. A trail continues eastward from the topmost platform, reaching the Appalachian Trail, about  higher in elevation than the base of the falls, in about . The waterfall is near the north end of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in New Jersey.\nDingmans Falls\nDingmans Falls is the second highest waterfall in the state of Pennsylvania with a plunge of . It is located at the northern end of the DWG park. There is a beautiful (composite) boardwalk that leads you to the base of the\nwaterfall where you can see the  cascading drop. This boardwalk is roughly  long and takes you to the base of the falls, but also passes by Silverthread Falls. You can continue on up a series of stairs to the waterfall and see the entire  plunge from the birds eye view. The best time to see this waterfall is about 24 hours after a hard rain,  when it will be flowing fast and steady. This is probably the best known waterfall of Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Park.\nSilverthread Falls\nSilverthread Falls is also located in upper Pennsylvania, less than  from Dingmans Falls. This waterfall exhibits a steep drop of about  via a narrow channel constructed of prominent rock-joints faces, however the volume of flow is much less than Dingmans Falls.\nVisitors can view both Silverthread and Ding Dong Falls via the same (composite) boardwalk & trail emanating from the Dingmans Falls Visitor Center.\nFactory Falls\nFactory Falls is located on the George W. Childs Park Trail in Pennsylvania, it follows Dingmans Creek so you are very close to Dingmans falls. The Brooks Family ran a woolen mill from 1823 to 1832 next to this fall, the remains of the mill can be seen next to the fall. You will take a single path through the woods that runs on both sides of the creek that is roughly  in length. This waterfall is the first one in a set of three that is on this traill. Factory Falls drops twice and makes a 90 degree turn with the creek.\nFulmer Falls\nFulmer Falls is the second waterfall along the George W. Childs Park Trail in Pennsylvania right after Factory Falls. This fall is  tall and is the largest in George W. Childs Park. This waterfall has a unique feature of falling in a semi-circular basin of rock and then flowing downstream. The base of this waterfall is not accessible.\nDeer Leap Falls\nThe third and last fall of the trail of George W. Childs Park is Deer Leap Falls. There is a bridge over top of the falls. There is a very large wide shallow pool at the bottom of the fall. Swimming and wading are not permitted.\nRaymondskill Falls\nRaymondskill Falls are a series of three cascading waterfalls located on Raymondskill Creek in Pike County, Pennsylvania. It is the tallest waterfall in Pennsylvania. The three tiers of Raymondskill Falls have a combined height of approximately .\nVan Campens Glen Falls\nVan Campens Glen Falls is the terminus of the Lower Van Campens Glen trail hike near Walpack, NJ. The top of the falls features a deep, large pool that cascades down a slanted rock face. The areas surrounding the upper pool require extreme caution as this area has been responsible for numerous accidents and deaths in years past.\nThe trail itself features a densely covered hemlock ravine that hosts various delicate plants and species of wildlife. The root systems at the base of many of the hemlocks have been damaged due to high foot traffic in the area. This, in addition to storm damage and a lack of funding, has led the National Park Service and Department of the Interior to close the Lower Van Campens Glen trail indefinitely, due to public hazard, as of Spring 2019.\nSee also\n* Bushkill Falls\nReferences"
