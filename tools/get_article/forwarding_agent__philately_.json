At each stage the agent would add their own mark. For instance, a letter might pass first through the sender's domestic post office's hands, then to a forwarder for a sea journey and then to the post office of the destination country.\nThe study of the marks of forwarding agents on mail is a popular branch of postal history.\nSee also\n*Thomas Fletcher Waghorn\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Rowe, Kenneth.
