It is the second edition of the Kings World Cup Nations, and will take place from 3 to 17 January 2026 in Brazil, with São Paulo's Allianz Parque designated as the venue for the final.\nFormat\nThe tournament has been expanded from 16 teams to 20, and will now start with a group stage: the teams are divided into five groups of four, with the top team from each group advancing directly to the quarterfinals and the second-placed teams and the best third-place team playing a last-chance round.\nTeams\nAs usual in the Kings League, each national team was chaired by a streamer or a football related personality, but this time the chairpersons were given the title of 'captains', akin to the Davis Cup. The 20 teams were announced during the Kings League Kickoff Day livestream on 11 October 2025. This edition saw the debuts of Belgium, Chile, France, India, Indonesia, Netherlands, Poland, and Qatar; while Turkey, Ukraine, Korea Republic, and Uzbekistan did not return.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=110px | Nation !!
