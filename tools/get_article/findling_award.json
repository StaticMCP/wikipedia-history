It was founded in 1982 in GDR and was awarded on several film festivals. Far more than hundred filmmakers received this award.\nThe prize itself is a stone on a pedestal with a metal plate designed by sculptor Peter Lewandowsky.\nPart of the prize's endowment was a tour of the winning film with its director and a critic, often with Sven Eggers, to cultural cinemas, art houses and film clubs.\nThe award was named after a glacial erratic, but plays with the word as it also means \"foundling\".\nSometimes, though wrong, you read Findling Prize.\nFestivals\nIt was awarded on all GDR National film festivals:\n* Nationales Spielfilmfestival der DDR (National Feature Film Festival of GDR) in Karl-Marx-Stadt (1982-1990)\n* Nationales Festival des Dokumentarfilms der DDR (National Festival of Documentary Film of GDR) in Neubrandenburg (1982-1989)\n* Nationales Kinderfilmfestival Goldener Spatz (National Children's Film Festival) in Gera (1983-1989)\n* Internationale Dokumentar- und Kurzfilmwoche (International Week of Documentary and Animation Film) (now: dok Leipzig) in Leipzig (1983-1989)\nAfter 1990 it is awarded on the following festivals:\n* Filmfestival Cottbus Festival for Eastern European Feature Film (1991-2002)\n* FilmArtFestival Mecklenburg-Pomerania German Feature Film Festival Schwerin (1991-2013)\n* dokumentART International Documentary Film Festival Neubrandenburg (1992-2015)\n* Film-Festival im Stadthafen Rostock / Young German Film (2004-2014)\n* dok Leipzig (Internationales Leipziger Festival für Dokumentar- und Animationsfilm)\n* 2015 and 2016 the Findling also was awarded abroad at the SEFF [http://www.europeanfilmfestival.szczecin.pl/en Szczecin European Film Festival] in Poland.\nSelected honorees\nSources\n*\nReferences"
