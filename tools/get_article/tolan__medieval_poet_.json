      "text": "# Tolan (medieval poet)\n\nTolan (fl. 9th century AD), also romanized as Tholan, was an early medieval south Indian poet remembered for composing Malayalam passages of the art-form Koodiyattam. He was a courtier and friend of king Kulasekhara Varma (identified with Sthanu Ravi Kulasekhara, c. 844/45 – c. 870/71 AD). Tolan wrote the elaborate Malayalam passages for the vidushaka's speeches in Koodiyattam. These passages were probably intended for a native (Malayalam) audience at the temple.\nTolan is also credited with the authorship of the lost historical kavya \"Mahodayapuresa-charitha\". It has also been suggested that he might be identical to the Mushika or Ezhimala court poet Atula.\nSee also\n*Koothu\n*Koodiyattam\n*Malayalam literature\nReferences"
