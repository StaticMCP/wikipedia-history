It divided Saint Martin between the Kingdom of France and the Dutch Republic; the peoples of St. Martin were to co-exist co-operatively.\nThe treaty was signed because of economical, strategical and geographical backgrounds, first and foremost a joint aversion against the Spanish that occupied the island from 1633 to 1648. [https://www.visitstmaarten.com/why-is-st-maarten-divided/] The French kept the area that they occupied and the coast facing Anguilla, and the Dutch kept the area of the fort and the land around it on the south coast. The inhabitants would share the natural resources of the island.\nDespite the treaty, France and the Netherlands continued to dispute the ownership of the island until 1817, when the borders on the island were finally set. Various zones that the treaty left unclear pertaining the exact location of the border, were finalized only in 2023. The lagoon in Oyster Pond was the most disputed area until that year.\nValidity\nQuestions as to its validity have arisen several times in the past and continue to cause issues. Research was supposed to be undertaken by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs about it.\nAt the time of the treaty, agreements signed between representatives of the monarch had to be registered at the King's Council. That essential formality was never performed, but it seems that, on many occasions, French civil law recognised the validity of the agreement.\nThe treaty has always been fairly applied in practice and is referred to in the following texts:\n* Franco-Dutch Convention of 28 November 1839. (See French text)\n* French side gubernatorial Order of 11 February 1850 about the rules on the salt trade and use, whose Article #32 states:\n* Decree of 30 July 1935, which in its Article #40 provides for the freedom of establishment in the French part of Saint-Martin for the Dutch citizens from the Dutch part of Saint-Martin:\nAbolition\nThere currently is a movement in both Sint Maarten and Saint Martin for the unification of the island, which would invalidate the Treaty of Concordia. It has been proposed that the freedom of movement allowed by this treaty may have made possible the development of a common identity by the inhabitants of both halves of the island.\nSee also\n*France–Netherlands border\n*Franco-Dutch treaty on Saint Martin border controls\n*History of Saint Martin\n*List of treaties\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://issuu.com/xtofsxm/docs/heritage_6/15/ Treaty of Concordia (source)]"
