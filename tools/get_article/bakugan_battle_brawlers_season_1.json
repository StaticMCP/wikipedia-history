Dan and the others agree to this plan and cut off communication. While Shun and Skyress wait, Skyress looks at the two maps Shun has on the computer and comments how the two valley's look nothing alike, asking herself what Shun is up to. When the brawlers return to the plane they are greeted by Julie, who has perked up and decided to move on from being depressed. With Julie joining them the brawlers take off for the other valley. While on their way there the brawlers comment on how Masquerade and his team keep showing up wherever they go and Shun states that someone must be spying for him. When Dan accuses Shun of saying that one of the brawlers is the spy, Shun denies that by saying there is one other person who knows the brawlers every move, that person being Webmaster Joe. The brawlers consider this a possibility and Skyress states that this must be the reason why Shun lied about the valley that they were heading to. The brawlers realize that if Masquerade's team is at the valley then Webmaster Joe is most likely involved with him. Once they arrive they are greeted by Chan and a battle between her and Dan begins. Dan and Drago test their luck as they take out two of Chan's Bakugan only for the tides to turn when Chan revives them and Dan is left with only Drago.

It then switches to the brawlers as they return to Marucho's plane as another day of searching for the infinity core and a door to Vestroia ends in failure. Marucho and Preyas cheer everyone up by making takoyaki to eat. Dan later suggests that they ask for information about the infinity core on their website while everyone disagrees, Shun agrees with Dan saying that even if they keep their search a secret info on it can still be leaked so they should go on the offensive and stick their necks out to see what happens. With all the brawlers and bakugan in agreement Marucho uploads Dan's video on the website which Klaus receives. In the morning the brawlers receive a message stating that if they want info on the infinity core then go to Germany.

The battle ends with Dan and Runo winning and Runo and Marucho return with Dan to the other brawlers. The brawlers comment on how Masquerade is still on his quest to find the ultimate Bakugan. Drago states that if the silent core has fused with the ultimate bakugan Naga then it is possible for the infinity core to do the same, with Julie worrying that that Bakugan could be Hydranoid.

That is of course, if she can eliminate the Brawlers once and for all. To accomplish this task, Naga gives Tricloid a Subterra power boost of negative energy from the mighty Silent Core, which makes her more corrupted with evil energy. Tricloid tracks down Julie and Billy and to their surprise challenges them to a brawl. They accept, but Tricloid is much stronger than they expected. When the battle becomes more and more difficult, a \"friend\" of the Brawlers shows up to help defeat Tricloid.\n| LineColor       = #add8e6\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 1, 2008 (Canada)January 31, 2009 (USA)\n| ShortSummary        = Naga's troops have finally infiltrated Wardington after being defeated twice already. Alice discovers that Tricloid's sister Rabeeder is invading the town. Little does she know the one she trained before, Christopher, will also get involved in the battle. Dan is informed that Hairadee, Centorrior and Druman are also approaching the city following Tayghen's death and Tricloid's defeat. When it appears these two are being overpowered, Klaus arrives. The three soon realize all Rabeeder is doing is being controlled by her worry for her sister, Tricloid. Alice starts doubting herself but, Christopher and Klaus help her. Hydranoid defeats Rabeeder (with help from Sirenoid and Juggernoid), and is reunited with Tricloid as both of them return to Vestroia, deciding to resign from Naga's army. However, afterwards, Alice runs off after seeing her grandfather, Dr. Michael, unaware it was a trap by his dark self, Hal-G, to lead him to Wavern.\n| LineColor       = #add8e6\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 8, 2008 (Canada)February 7, 2009 (USA)\n| ShortSummary        = With the Brawlers dispersed all over Wardington to locate and destroy Naga's servants, Shun finds himself in a amusement park where he is attacked by Hairadee, a Bakugan hybrid. Shun and Skyress meet up with Komba and begin to battle. At first Storm Skyress and Harpus do well against the evil Bakugan with the help of Komba O'Charlie. Later on, Hairadee creates a crystal ice cage to trap Skyress. Hairadee then pounds Skyress down with icicles. Skyress and Harpus are both tortured by Hairadee, who is far much stronger than before and overpowers Shun and Storm Skyress, leaving her trapped and Shun fighting Hairadee himself. Later, Storm Skyress is released and with the help of Komba and the unexpected arrival of Julio with his Haos Tentaclear, everyone defeats Hairadee.\n| LineColor       = #add8e6\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 15, 2008 (Canada)February 14, 2009 (USA)\n| ShortSummary        = Dan and Runo team up together, and decide to face off against Centorrior and Druman, who have arrived in the city.

Dan leads the Brawlers to defeat the two hybrid Bakugan and runs off to battle Naga himself, but when Dan arrives, he finds Wavern trapped with no other choice but to give the core to her brother. Wavern tells Drago that the only way for him to win the battle is for him to kill her and take the Infinity Core from her. Drago does so, knowing that it is the only way to defeat Naga and to save Vestroia. When the battle continues with Drago losing more positive power from the Infinity Core, Drago becomes full of rage and anger of losing his beloved Wavern and evolves into the infinite Bakugan, Infinity Dragonoid.\n| LineColor       = #add8e6\n}}\n| AltDate             = June 29, 2008 (Canada)February 28, 2009 (USA)\n| ShortSummary        = Drago and Naga's battle continues, until the Brawlers step forward, launching their Bakugan into battle to reinforce Drago. With the power of all six attributes, Drago overwhelms Naga and destroys him, releasing the Silent Core and absorbing it. Upon Naga's demise, Hal-G is also destroyed, reuniting Alice with her grandfather, Dr. Michael. With the battle over and the world saved, it is time for the Brawlers and their beloved Bakugan to say goodbye. After the group shares a tearful farewell, Drago opens a portal to Vestroia, allowing all Bakugan to begin their journey home. Sacrificing himself, Drago becomes the core of New Vestroia itself, restoring the Bakugan homeworld to its original state. With the Bakugan gone, everything eventually returns to normal. A few months pass, and Dan goes to the park for a date with Runo, when he hears Drago's voice one last time, wishing him well.\n| LineColor       = #add8e6\n}}\n}}\nSee also\n* List of Bakugan Battle Brawlers: New Vestroia episodes\n* List of Bakugan: Gundalian Invaders episodes\n* List of Bakugan: Mechtanium Surge episodes\nReferences\n; General\n*\n*\n*\n*\n; Specific\nExternal links\n* [http://www.tms-e.com/tv_movie/bakugan/ TMS Entertainment's Bakugan Battle Brawlers advertisement]\n* [http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/bakugan/ TV Tokyo's Bakugan Battle Brawlers website]\n* [http://www.nelvana.com/show/69/bakugan-battle-brawlers Nelvana's Bakugan Battle Brawlers website]\nes:Anexo:Episodios de Bakugan Battle Brawlers"
