The institute works under the Ministry of Agriculture, India.\nService profile\nThe Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture assists small aqua farmers in optimising their finfish and shrimp farming by providing suitable modern technologies. They also offer study courses and research facilities for students, farmers and entrepreneurs. CIBA regularly conducts farmers’ meet, trainings, exhibitions, workshops, and brainstorming sessions.[http://ekikrat.in/Central-Institute-Brackishwater-Aquaculture-CIBA Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA)]\nMandate of CIBA\nCIBA was formed, under Indian Council of Agricultural Research, with a mandate to:[http://www.ciba.res.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=281&Itemid=64&lang=en Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture | Indian Council of Agricultural Research]\n* conduct research for development of techno-economically viable and sustainable culture systems for finfish and shellfish in brackish water.\n* act as a repository of information on brackish water fishery resources with a systematic database\n* undertake transfer of technology through training, education and extension programmes\n* provide consultancy services\nDivisions\nThe organization has the following research divisions for the development of marine science[http://www.ciba.res.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=160&lang=en Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture | Indian Council of Agricultural Research][https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Central_Institute_of_Brackishwater_Aquaculture Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture]\nCrustacean Culture Division (CCD)\nThe Division deals with research on crustaceans such as:\n* Maturation and seed production\n* Nursery rearing and culture\n* Area development and impact assessment\n* Molecular approach in disease diagnostics and species identification\nFinfish Culture Division (FCD)\nFCD deals with brackish water fish such as Asian Seabass, Mullets, King fish and Milk fish with special emphasis on domestication, production under controlled conditions, spawning, breeding, maturation and broodstock management.\nNutrition, Genetics and Biotechnology Division (NGBD)\nThe principal focus of NGBD is fish feed development such as Crab feed, Seabass feed, Shrimp feed, Fish meal & fish oil replacement. The Division also conducts research on Genetics and Biotechnology.\nAquatic Animal Health and Environment Division (AAHED)\nOne of the 2005-07 studies estimated the national loss of shrimp production at 48717 metric tonnes of product and the economic loss due to diseases at Rs. 1022.13 crore per year. AAHED focusses on research to eliminate/minimise the aquatic health concerns due to Viral and bacterial diseases.\nSocial Sciences Division (SSD)\nSSD conducts statistical research on:\n* Sector analysis\n* Extension, stakeholder interaction and requirement analysis\n* Fish availability and livelihood analysis, motivating and facilitating factors and time management.\nKakdwip Research Centre (KRC)\nKRC deals with research on shrimp farming in the coastal West Bengal. The Division emphasises the development of various shrimp varieties such as Mugil cephalus, L. tade, L. parsia and P. monodon in one trial and finfish such as Chanos chanos. They have a mechanism to collect extensive data from 400 brackish water aquaculture farms in the coastal districts of West Bengal and maintain a user-friendly relational database management system (RDMS) for the traditional brackish water aquaculture system in West Bengal.\nFacilities\nAgricultural Knowledge Management Unit (AKMU)\nThe Agricultural Knowledge Management Unit (AKMU) is the online connectivity platform for different research institutes, national centers and State Agricultural Universities. The also maintain databases on coastal aquaculture, provides advanced methods of communication and internet technologies and maintain and update the institute's web site.\nLibrary\nThe institute has an extensive library on various disciplines of aquaculture and fisheries such as shrimp and fish grow-out culture technology, hatchery technology, physiology, nutrition, biotechnology, genetics, pathology, aquaculture engineering, pollution, toxicology, socio-economics and extension.\nLaboratories\nThe institute has three laboratories:\n* Health laboratory\n* Nutrition laboratory\n* KRC laboratory\nOther facilities\nCIBA also maintain other facilities such as Hatchery, Trainees' Hostel, Auditorium and Conference hall with video conferencing.\nPatents\nDr.K.K.Krishnani, Renowned Scientist in Aquatic Animal Health and Environment Division has invented many technologies and applied for 9 patents, being the most number of applications filed by any individual scientist at CIBA.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Central_Institute_of_Brackishwater_Aquaculture\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSBNC6Vd5vA CIBA profile and programs on YouTube]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23nimUHmVRk Documentary about CIBA on YouTube]\n* [http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/208597912 Location map on Open street Map]\n* [http://www.asti.cgiar.org/node/2106 Reference on ASTI]\n* [http://wikimapia.org/4747436/Central-Institute-of-Brackishwater-Aquaculture-Chennai on Wikimapia]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714165730/http://aquaculturedirect.blogspot.ae/2012/11/central-institute-of-brackishwater.html Profile]\nFurther reading\n* [http://library.enaca.org/NACA-Publications/LC-Meeting/RLC/CIBA.pdf ICAR booklet on CIBA]\n* [http://www.docstoc.com/docs/132836946/RTI-Central-Institute-of-Brackishwater-Aquaculture CIBA prodile on Docstock]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714193130/http://www.agritech.tnau.ac.in/about_us/pdf/hrd_national_trainings_icar_ciba.pdf Booklet on CIBA]"
