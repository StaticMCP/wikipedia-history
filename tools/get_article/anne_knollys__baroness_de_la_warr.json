Mary was a sister of Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII of England. Anne Knollys' mother was thus a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth, daughter of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII. Mary Boleyn had preceded her more famous sister in the King's affections, and had affairs with both Francis I of France and Henry VIII. Both Catherine Carey and Henry Carey may have been Henry's children, though exact dates of birth are uncertain. If true, this would make Anne the granddaughter of Henry VIII.\nAnne's eldest sister was Lettice Knollys, chief Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth and the mother of the queen's favourite, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.\nMarriage and issue\nAnne Knollys married, on 19 November 1571, Thomas West, 2nd Baron De La Warr, by whom she had six sons and eight daughters:\n*Sir Robert West, who married Elizabeth Coks and predeceased his father.\n*Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (7 July 1577 – c.
