The Archer Avenue lines were supposed to be extended to Hollis as part of Program for Action, a never-completed New York City Subway expansion in 1988.\nParks\nLiberty Triangle Park\nLiberty Rock is a boulder in Liberty Triangle park at the intersection of Farmers Blvd. and Liberty Ave.\nIt was placed there in 1928 as a commemorative to the Pennsylvania Railroad casualties of World War One. Later, the plaque for that commemoration was removed and placed in an unknown location in the late 1960s. The character of the neighborhood changed to predominantly African-American, coincident with White flight.\nThe Liberty Rock became a symbol of the history and culture of the African American community in St. Albans. The painting of the rock in red, black, and green, the colors of the Pan-African flag, represents the community's commitment to civil rights, group identity, and fostering ties between all people of African descent. The location of the rock, at the intersection of St. Albans, Hollis, and Jamaica, highlights its significance as a shared symbol for the entire community. The Liberty Rock serves as a symbol of resistance and resilience, reminding the community of its rich cultural heritage and ongoing struggle for equality and justice.\nThe Liberty Rock was originally erected as a World War I memorial in the late 1920s or early 1930s. It  honored the soldiers who fought and died in the war. During his 1960 campaign JFK visited the 'Rock' on a whistlestop tour of Queens. On June 26, 1968, seventeen year olds Tony Tims and Daniel Gibson were the only people there initially when it was first painted; Tims claimed \"I used my father's paint, met with Daniel. I would paint, he filmed it. I got the idea from a small rock that was painted red, black and green in the square located at 122nd & Farmers Blvd, That's the real story.\" Tims painted the rock red, black, and green to symbolize the Black Power and Pan-African movements. This act of community activism was a way for the residents to express their cultural pride and reclaim their community, which was beginning to face challenges such as crime, and neglect.\nAt the time, the Liberty Rock was located in a predominantly black neighborhood. Tony Tims and Daniel Gibson decided one afternoon to paint the rock after seeing a small rock painted in the red, black and green colors of liberation in a nearby square with the support of local businesses who donated a pint of the red paint the young men had run out of. The City of New York was initially opposed to the painted rock, but with the backing of the local store owners, the residents successfully challenged the city and kept the rock painted in the red, black, and green colors. However, the plaque honoring the war veterans was removed and placed elsewhere.\nNotable people\nSince the beginning of hip-hop, the neighborhood has been a hotbed of talent, sparked primarily by the fact that hip-hop producer and icon Russell Simmons is from this community, as is his brother Joseph, who along with his friends Darryl McDaniels and Jason Mizell formed the rap group Run-D.M.C.
