As of 2023, it is a World Athletics Race Walking Tour Gold level meetingthe highest-level circuit of international race walking competitions.\nThe meeting is organized by the Chinese Athletic Association, and it is typically held in March, April, or May. There was a domestic race walking competition held in Taicang as far back as 2010, but the meeting became sponsored by World Athletics (then IAAF) and attracted international talent starting in 2011. In 2014, it served as the 2014 IAAF World Race Walking Cup, and in 2018 it hosted the championship again under its new name 2018 IAAF World Race Walking Team Championships. In 2024, it also served as the 2024 Olympic trials for China in the race walk. The citizens of Taicang were reported to have a \"deep passion\" for walking, and the city fielded a race walking team at the 2014 edition.\nThe competition was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in China, and it did not return until 2023, rebranded as the Chinese Race Walking Grand Prix (or National Race Walking Grand Prix). There was a separate National Race Walking Grand Prix in Taicang in the past, but it did not receive Tour / IAAF Challenge status before 2023.\nEditions\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Chinese Race Walking Grand Prix editions\n!  !!
