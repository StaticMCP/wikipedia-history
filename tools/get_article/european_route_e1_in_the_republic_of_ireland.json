It runs through five counties starting on the British border with the province of Northern Ireland at Dundalk, coming from Belfast and Larne. It passes the capital Dublin until it stops at Rosslare Harbour in the South-East of the island of Ireland. From there the E1 crosses the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay on a non-existent ferry towards Spain and Portugal.\nRoute\nThe E1 comes from Northern Ireland when it crosses the border at Dundalk where the British A1 road changes to the Irish N1 road until northern Dundalk. It then follows the M1 motorway to Drogheda and eventually the capital Dublin. After using the M50 ring road around Dublin, the E1 uses the N11 road and M11 motorway passing Bray, Wicklow, Gorey and Enniscorthy to Wexford. The last part is the N25 road towards Rosslare Harbour. The E1 covers a total distance of 266&nbsp;km (165&nbsp;mi) in the Republic of Ireland.\nDetailed route\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+E1 Dundalk - Rosslare\n!County\n!National\nroad\nnumber\n!Section\n!Junction\n|-\n|\n| A1 road\n| colspan=\"2\" | from Larne to border with Republic of Ireland via Belfast, Lisburn and Newry\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Louth\n| N1 road\n|Northern Ireland-Dundalk\n| 20 R132 Carrickcarnan,  (Jonesborough)\n19 R174 Ravensdale\n18 N52 Dundalk (North), Carlingford\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | M1 motorway\n|Dundalk-Drogheda\n| 17 N53 Dundalk (Center), Castleblayney, Monaghan\n16 N52 Dundalk (South), Ardee, Mullingar\nCastlebellingham service station\n15 R166 Castlebellingham, Tallanstown\n14 N33, N2 Ardee, Monaghan,  (Derry)\n13 R170 Dunleer\n12 R169 Dunleer, Collon\n11 R132 Monasterboice\n10 N51 Drogheda (North), Navan, Slane, Hospital\n|-\n|Meath\n|Drogheda-Balbriggan\n| 9 Drogheda, Donore, Duleek\n8 Drogheda, Duleek\nnear Julianstown\n7 Julianstown, Laytown, Stamullen\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Dublin\n|Balbriggan-Dublin\n| 6 R122 Balbriggan, Skerries, Naul\n5 R132 Balbriggan, Lusk, Rush\nLusk service station\n4 R132 Swords, Malahide, Donabate\n3 R125 Swords, Ashbourne\n2 Dublin Airport\n1 Malahide\nM50 towards Southbound\n|-\n| M50 motorway\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Dublin city\n| 4 R108 Ballymun, Naul\n5 N2, M2 Dublin center, Finglas, Ashbourne,  (Derry)\n6 N3, M3 Dublin center, Cavan, Navan, Castleknock, Connolly Hospital\n7 N4, M4, M6 Dublin center, Galway, Sligo, Westport, Mullingar, Lucan\n9 N7, M7, M8, M9 Dublin center, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Inchicore, Clondalkin, Naas\n10 R838 Ballymount, Cookstown, Belgard Road\n11 N81 Blessington, Templeogue, Tallaght\n12 R113, Knocklyon, Firehouse\n13 R826 Sandyford, Dundrum\n14 N31 Dún Laoghaire, Stillorgan\n15 Cornelscourt, Kilternan\n16 R118, Cherrywood, Loughlinstown\n17 M11 towards Dublin center, Dún Laoghaire\n|-\n| M11 motorway\n| 5 R761 Bray (North)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Wicklow\n| N11 road\n|Bray-Ashford\n| 6 R918 Bray, Fassaroe\nR117 towards Enniskerry, Glencullen\n7 R767 Bray (South), Greystones, Enniskerry\n8 R755 Roundwood, Kilmacanogue\n9 Greystones, Roundwood, Glenview\n10 R762 Delgany, Greystones, Drummin\n11 R774 Greystones (South), Kilpedder, Kilcoole\n12 R772 Newtownmountkennedy, Roundwood, Kilcoole\n13 R772 Newtownmountkennedy (South), Newcastle, Roundwood\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | M11 motorway\n|Ashford-Arklow\n| 14 R772 Coynes Cross\n15 R772 Ashford (North)\n16 R772 Wicklow (North), Ashford (South), Rathnew\n17 R772 Wicklow (Center), Rathnew, Rathdrum, Glenealy\n18 R751 Wicklow (South), Rathdrum\n19 Brittas Bay, Redcross\n20 R772 Arklow (North), Redcross, Avoca\n21 R772 Arklow (South), Inch, Aughrim\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Wexford\n|Arklow-Enniscorthy\n|  Gorey service station\n22 R772 Gorey (North), Inch, Killinierin\n23 R732 (R742, R741) Gorey (South), Courtown, Ballycanew\n24 R772 Clough, Camolin, Ferns\n25 N30, R744 Enniscorthy, Ferns, Blackwater, New Ross, Carlow\n|-\n| N11 road\n|Enniscorthy-Wexford\n| R772 towards Enniscorthy\nOylegate\nWexford\nR730 towards Wexford center\nR730 towards Killurin, Kiltealy\nN25, R769 towards Wexford center, New Ross, Waterford, Limerick, Cork\n|-\n| N25 road\n|Wexford-Rosslare Harbour\n| R733 towards Wexford center, Arthurstown, Wellingtonbridge, Duncannon\nR730 towards Wexford center\nR739 towards Kilmore Quay\nKillinick\nR740 towards Rosslare\nTagoat\nR736 towards Rosslare, Bridgetown, Kilmore Quay\nKilrane\nRosslare Harbour\nRosslare Europort\n|-\n|\n|Sea route Rosslare Harbour-Ferrol\n| colspan=\"2\" | towards Ferrol, A Coruña and Vigo\n|}\nReferences"
