He made some of the company's better films, including Baby Face Morgan with Richard Cromwell (1942), The Payoff with Lee Tracy (1942), Dixie Jamboree with Frances Langford (1944), Tiger Fangs with Frank Buck (1944), and the Cinecolor fantasy The Enchanted Forest with Harry Davenport (1945).\nHe later entered into releasing arrangements with fellow exhibitor-turned-producer Robert L. Lippert, publicity man-turned-producer Edward Finney, and PRC's successor Eagle-Lion Films. In 1949 he produced four Red Ryder westerns with Jim Bannon, noteworthy at the time for being filmed in Cinecolor. Jack Schwarz's most widely distributed film is probably Gold Raiders, released by United Artists in 1951 and again in 1958. This is a budget western co-starring veteran screen actor George O'Brien and  The Three Stooges.\nPlagiarism suit\nIn 1945, Schwarz filed a plagiarism action against Universal Pictures and its executives. He alleged that the studio had pirated a romantic movie manuscript that contained musical themes, and used the material in one of the studio's own movie productions, His Butler’s Sister (1943), which allegedly involved a similar theme. The court read the scenario, viewed the movie, and held in favor of the studio and its executives.\nPersonal life\nIn May 1944, 13-year-old Patsy Ruth Brown disappeared after leaving Schwarz's Fox Wilshire Building penthouse. Schwarz told juvenile officers that Patsy had spent the afternoon in his apartment. That evening he gave her three dollars for a taxi. According to Schwarz, Patsy left in the company of an older girl named O'Hara, whom Patsy had brought with her. Schwarz said that Patsy had begged him numerous times for a role in one of his films. Her only film appearance (uncredited) was in Nearly Eighteen (1943), not one of Jack Schwarz's productions. A taxi driver who took Patsy to Union Station told the police that Patsy said she was going to San Bernardino to visit her father, an employee of a Barstow, California rock company. However, the taxi driver's tip failed to help police trace the missing girl.\nSchwarz was married to redheaded actress Marie Louise Talbott, who divorced him in 1952, stating in court that he stayed out all night and came home with lipstick on his clothes.\nLater life\nSchwarz produced his last film in 1953. He owned the Copra Room nightclub and restaurant, 740 East Broadway, in Long Beach, California. He died in Los Angeles in 1987, shortly after his 90th birthday.\nSelected filmography\n* ''Girls' Town (1942)\n* The Payoff (1942)\n* The Enchanted Forest (1945)\n* Ride, Ryder, Ride!
