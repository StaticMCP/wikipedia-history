It lies in the middle of the Taitao Peninsula.\nWhile the lake's existence only became known in Chile in 1945, it appears to have been known by Chono natives, who led 19 survivors of  (including Captain David Cheap and Midshipman John Byron) from Wager Island through it in 1742. The Chonos, who often had a hostile relationship with the Spanish, kept the lake secret from them despite serving the Spanish as maritime pilots. Despite official discovery in 1945, the lake was already known to seafarers from Chiloé.\nReferences"
