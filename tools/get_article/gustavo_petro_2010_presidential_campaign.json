The first promoter of this initiative was the then conservative senator Ciro Ramírez, who presented this project at the beginning of 2007.\nIn September of that same year, the Partido de la U led by its congressman Luis Guillermo Giraldo promoted a project to call a referendum to decide the possibility of electing President Álvaro Uribe Vélez for the period 2010-2014. To this end, a campaign was launched in 2008 in which 5 million citizen signatures were collected, of which the National Registry endorsed 3,900,000.\nOnce the signatures were collected and endorsed by the Registry, between August 2008 and August 2009 the two chambers of Congress processed the project to call the referendum. During this period, a series of irregularities in the process of collecting signatures were revealed, such as the confusing wording of the question that only allowed Álvaro Uribe to run for re-election in 2014, the violation of the funding limits authorized by the law or the participation of the Transval company (owned by the extradited David Murcia Guzmán) in the transfer of the signatures. Despite the doubts, the Congress of the Republic approved a referendum project to become effective in the 2010 presidential elections.\nIn accordance with the constitutional procedure, Alejandro Ordóñez, Attorney General of the Nation, gave a favorable opinion to the initiative and asked the Constitutional Court to declare it enforceable in January 2010.\nAdditionally, these irregularities led to an investigation by the National Electoral Council,15 which on March 4 declared the signature collection process invalid. Due to the same facts, the Office of the Attorney General of the Nation is currently an investigation for procedural fraud against the promoters of the referendum.\nParty representation\n*Alternative Democratic Pole\nSee also\n* Presidency of Gustavo Petro\n* 2010 Colombian presidential election\n* Gustavo Petro 2022 presidential campaign\n* Gustavo Petro 2018 presidential campaign\nReferences"
