These schools were still faced with problems common to underfunded urban schools, such as academic performance and discipline.  The same problems led to Doris M. Johnson High School being recommend for closure in 2010 and Heritage was identified by the Maryland State Department of Education for school improvement in many years.\nHistory\nFounded in 2004 by Karen Lawrence, established as an expansion school originally known as Harford Institute during the time and as a result of the breakup of Lake Clifton Eastern High School.

This building already had science labs, a state-of the art library & media center, gymnasiums, full-service health clinic, and established athletic and extracurricular activities. It was also wired for internet.  Beginning with the 2005–2006 school year, Heritage High School shared the Lake Clifton Campus with Doris M. Johnson High School.
