The Council and the president are linked by an alleged relationship of confidence: if the president resigns or he is dismissed by the Council, a snap election is called for both the legislative and the executive offices, because in no case the two bodies can be chosen separately.\nPowers\nThe president of Veneto promulgates regional laws and regulations. He can receive special administrative functions by the national government. The president is one of the eighty members of the Regional Council and, in this capacity, he can propose new laws.\nThe president appoints and dismiss the Regional Government (called Giunta Regionale in Italian). The Cabinet is composed by no more than eight regional assessors (assessori, regional ministers) who can be contextually members of the Council. One assessor can be appointed Vice President.\nThe Regional Government prepares the budget, appoints the boards of public regional agencies and companies, manages assets, develops projects of governance, and resorts to the Constitutional Court of Italy if it thinks that a national law may violate regional powers. The president and the Government are two different authorities of the Region: in matters within its competence, the Government has the power to vote to give its approval.\nCurrent government\nSee also\n*List of presidents of Veneto\nReferences\n*Regional Council of Veneto"
