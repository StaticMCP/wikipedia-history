Commissioned by Nelvana and produced by SynergySP, the series follows BeyWheelz and BeyWarriors: BeyRaiderz in being created primarily for the Western market. The standalone show has 26 episodes.\nDespite being produced for a Western audience, BeyWarriors: Cyborg has seen limited distribution outside of Asia. The series initially debuted on K2 on October 18, 2014 in Italy where the show's first 14 episodes ran before being abruptly pulled from the schedule. Following the disappointing results of Beyblade: Shogun Steel and BeyWarriors: BeyRaiderz, Nelvana dropped the series, giving distribution rights to the Japanese company, d-rights and Hasbro’s toyline was cancelled. An English dubbed version started airing on Toonami Asia and Toonami India on October 3, 2015. The Japanese version of the series began streaming on February 27, 2015 on the Anime Hodai streaming service. It was later streamed on U-Next.\nIn conjunction with the channel's then upcoming broadcast of Beyblade Burst, Disney XD in the United States acquired the catalog rights to the entire Beyblade franchise in late 2016. This included BeyWarriors: Cyborg, though as of 2023 the series remains unreleased in North America.\nPlot\nThe newest series of the Beyblade saga is BeyWarriors: Cyborg, warriors who resemble half-creatures and half-machines. Mysterious objects called \"Beyraiderz\" are found in the sanctuaries of Teslandia. The Cyborg Warriors transform the energy released from the sanctuaries into small objects called Tokens. Who will win more battles to collect the most Tokens? The series is set in the future sometime around the 22nd century, where humanity has colonized space.\n\"Teslandia\" is an abandoned planet, ignored by the rest of the nearby planets due to its harsh environment. The story begins with Nico, Al and Sola. They must get the most Tokens possible. When power spots containing high levels of energy called \"Sanctuaries\" are identified, and mysterious vehicle shaped items called \"Beyraiderz\" are found along with the Sanctuaries, the Beyraiderz can synchronize with the youths under the age of 17 living in Teslandia, and summon the Cyborg creatures known as \"Warriors.\" The Warrior can transform high level \"Sanctuary\" energy into small Tokens. This means that human beings are able to obtain energy by making the \"Warriors\" battle against each other to turn the arid wasteland into a lush and bountiful world.\nSo, who will win the most battles and collect the most Tokens? What mystery lies behind each Warrior?\nA group of invincible warriors with features of half-humans and half-machines can transform energy into small artifacts called 'Tokens'. Who will win the battles now?\nWhen the Warrior Battles start, two mysterious Warriors appear in the desert next to the stone region. These two mysterious battlers have the ability to give power to a Warrior to summon another Warrior in a battle and also the power to take away Tokens from the sanctuary directly from the symbols carved on the chest of the BeyWarriors. Who are these mysterious Warriors?\nCharacters\n;Nico\n:\n;Al\n:\n;Sola\n:\n;Dr. Prost\n:\n;Ramon\n:\n;Augusto Claudius Lucius\n:}}\n;Marius\n:\n;Gai\n:\n;Sid\n:\n;Jean\n:\n;Gere\n:\n;Bran\n:\n;Zed\n:\n;Le Luca & Ray\n:\n;Homura\n:\n:The Commander of Flame.\n;Duke Paul\n:\n:One of August’s servants.\n;Roco\n:\n;Haltman & Oto\n:\n;Z\n:\n;Dewey & Cherim\n:\n;Dieter\n:\n;Reule\n:\n;Olin\n:\n;Tejite\n:\n;Lagran\n:\n;Pielle\n:\n:The Prime Minister of Lightning.\n;Earl Ditli\n:\nDevelopment\nDuring May 2013 at the \"Floor Plan\" of the then-upcoming annual Las Vegas Licensing Expo 2013, Nelvana announced through it two, new television series placed under the working titles \"BeyWarriors Cyborg\" and \"BeyRaiderz Shogun\". BeyWarriors Cyborg was given a tentative \"Fall 2014\" release slate. On June 11, 2013, Nelvana revealed the series would consist of 28 episodes: 26 half-hour episodes and 2 one-hour specials. It was also revealed to launch in over 80 countries with music composed by Catalin Marin, a newcomer to the Beyblade scoring scene taking over from Neil Parfitt and Scott Bucsis who have traditionally done the music for the last, four main Beyblade anime entries. It was also during this time that the series had entered post-production.\nOn September 9, 2013, a press release sent out by Nelvana confirmed \"BeyWarriors: BeyRaiderz\" (originally known by BeyRaiderz Shogun) and \"BeyWarriors Cyborg\" as the near-finalized names of the aforementioned series with the latter confirmed again for its fall 2014 release window as well as to \"include revolutionary new play patterns from Hasbro\" and \"lots of exciting new promotions\".\nFrom October 15–17, 2013, Nelvana presented BeyWarriors BeyRaiderz and BeyWarriors Cyborg at the annual Brand Licensing Expo 2013 in Olympia, London.\nOn April 4, 2014, Nelvana released their \"MIPTV Newsletter\" for the month promoting their most recent properties and revealing their programming plans for the years of 2015 and 2016. BeyWarriors Cyborg was nowhere to be found, suggesting that its planned release in the fall of 2014 has been postponed with a currently unknown date.\nAs of May 13, 2014, Nelvana has confirmed \"Beywarriors Cyborg is still a production in development conversations\" though its anime and toy line were acknowledged.\nOn May 21, 2014, Yoshihiro Nagamori, the character designer for the anime stated it was still in production and expressed his desire for it to air in Japan.\nOn June 1, 2014, Yoshihiro Nagamori reiterated his hope for a Japanese broadcast but explained that he does not know whether it is possible and while currently he cannot reveal any details about it, he may begin dropping hints should the series air in Japan.\nOn June 14, 2014, when asked why the series was delayed, Yoshihiro Nagamori stated that personally, he does not know.\nFrom June 17–19, 2014, instead of Nelvana, d-rights brought BeyWarriors Cyborg and other Beyblade brands to the Las Vegas Licensing Expo 2014\nOn July 8, 2014, it was confirmed that the series will begin airing in Italy on the Italian channel K2 every Saturday and Sunday at 11:15 A.M. starting on September 20, 2014.\nA synopsis of the series was also released:\n“Italian: La nuova serie della saga di Beyblade con i BeyWarriors Cyborg, guerrieri dall’aspetto di metà creature e metà macchine. Dei misteriosi oggetti chiamati \"Beyraiderz\" vengono ritrovati nei santuari di Teslandia. I Cyborg Warriors trasformano l’energia sprigionata dai santuari in piccoli oggetti chiamati Gettoni. Chi vincerà più battaglie conquistando il maggior numero di Gettoni?\nEnglish translation: The newest series of the Beyblade saga is BeyWarriors Cyborg, warriors who resemble half-creatures and half-machines. Mysterious objects called \"Beyraiderz\" are found in the sanctuaries of Teslandia. The Cyborg Warriors transform the energy released from the sanctuaries into small objects called Tokens. Who will win more battles to collect the most amount of Tokens?”\nDespite this announcement, plans changed and without warning, K2 pulled the series from their schedules and as a result, the series did not air in September. It is unknown if the anime is intended to air on K2 at a later time.\nSometime in early-October 2014, the d-rights website completed a massive site renovation and released new information regarding the show. The final name for the show was confirmed to be BeyWarriors: Cyborg. They debuted two images, one of a series logo and another a promotional poster. An extended synopsis of the Italian one released in July was presented, revealing new plot details. The series was also discovered to be produced under \"BWProject\" which is the same project name they used for BeyWheelz. Interestingly, d-rights classifies the series as a program for both kids and teens, suggesting this anime will be aimed at an older demographic than previous Beyblade anime.\nOn October 12, 2014, it was discovered that the series is now set to premiere in Italy on October 18, 2014 on channel K2 at 7:30. The second episode will air the following day with new episodes airing every weekends.\nEpisode list\n(Italy K2 Channel)\n| AltDate         = October 3, 2015 (Toonami Asia)\n| Aux4            = February 27, 2015 (Anime Hodai)\n| ShortSummary    = Nico, who lives in the Wind Country, summons a ‘Warrior’ by chance.
