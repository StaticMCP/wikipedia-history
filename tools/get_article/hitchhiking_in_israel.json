Following the event, there was increased hostilities between Jewish and Arab communities. Critics blame the event on the \"cavalier\" attitude of young Israelis hitchhikers. Further, some journalists have observed that some Israelis insist on hitchhiking as a demonstration of their freedom and right to travel. Despite tensions and events of violence, many insist on hitchhiking and affirm its institutional role in Israeli society.\nNehemia Akiva Stern of the University of Pittsburgh claimed that hitchhiking was mainly practiced by religious Zionist youth within the West Bank and described it as \"a ritual of sacred travel.\"\nSee also\n*Liftershalte\n*Slugging\n*Flexible carpooling\nReferences\nhe:טרמפיאדה"
