The committee was first made up of a wide variety of members, who initially sought to find support and prestige for the new historical program. From 1969 to 1970, the committee began to be increasingly composed of professional historians from universities, who made known their dissatisfaction with the NASA historical program. As a result, the Historical Advisory Committee was reduced in size and reorganized to be composed of only university-based professional historians to oversee the work of the NASA Historical Office.\nChairmen\n* Wood Gray, 1964-1966\n* Melvin Kranzeberg, 1966-1970\n* Louis Morton, 1970-\n* Walter Rundell\nMembers\n* Daniel J.
