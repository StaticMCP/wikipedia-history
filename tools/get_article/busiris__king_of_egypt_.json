Louvre Museum collection. ]]\nIn Greek mythology, Busiris (Ancient Greek: Βούσιρις) was a fictional Egyptian king of the central Delta who was killed by Heracles.\nBiography\nIsocrates, in his witty declamation Busiris, recounts \"the false tale of Heracles and Busiris\" (11.30–11.40), which was a comic subject represented almost entirely in the repertory of early 5th century BC Athenian vase-painters: the theme has a narrow narrative range, according to Niall Livingstone: Heracles being led to sacrifice; his escape; the killing of Busiris; the rout of his entourage.\nIn Isocrates's rhetorical use of a theme that he considers unworthy of serious treatment, the villainous king of Egypt named Busiris, a son of Poseidon and Libya or Lysianassa, was the ancient founder of Egyptian civilization, with an imagined \"model constitution\" that Isocrates sets up as a parodic contrast to the Republic by Plato. Otherwise, Busiris's mother was Anippe, daughter of the river-god Nilus. The monstrous Busiris sacrificed all visitors to his gods. Heracles defied Busiris, broke out of his shackles at the last minute, and killed him.\nIn Diodorus Siculus, Busiris appears as the founder of the line of kings at Thebes, which historically would have been the 11th Dynasty.\nAccording to Hyginus, Busiris was the father of Melite, who became the mother of Metus by her grandfather Poseidon.\nred-figure, ca. 525-500 BC, from the National Etruscan Museum.]]\nThis part of the mythology concerning Herakles appears to have origins in a corruption of an Egyptian myth concerning Osiris's sacrifice by Set, and subsequent resurrection (see Legend of Osiris and Isis).\nIn literature\nThe mythical king Busiris appears as the leader of a revolt in Lucian's True History (2.23), written in the 2nd century CE.\nIn Paradise Lost, John Milton uses \"Busiris\" as the name of the Pharaoh of the Exodus, which suggests a comparison between Heracles's escape and the Israelites' escape from slavery.\nIn Don Quixote (Part II, Chapter LX) the bandit Roque Guinart refers to himself as \"not some cruel Osiris,\" meaning \"Busiris.\"\nGallery\nFile:Near the Group of London E 311 - ARV 216 - Herakles and Busiris - Oxford AM V 521 - 02.jpg|Herakles and Busiris on the altar\nFile:Pan Painter ARV 554 82 Herakles and Busiris (02).jpg|Herakles striking the mythical King Busiris\nFile:Caeretan hydria - CH 34 - Herakles and Busiris - boar hunt - Wien KHM AS IV 3576 - 12.jpg|Herakles fighting Busiris and Egyptians\nFile:Swing painter, anfora con eracle e busiris, attica, 540 ac ca. 01.jpg|Busiris slayed by his Egyptian priests\nFile:Dinos con Eracle e Busiride - MArTA 04.jpg|Hercules, Busiris and Dinos at the altar\nNotes\nReferences\n* Apollodorus, The Library with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1921.
