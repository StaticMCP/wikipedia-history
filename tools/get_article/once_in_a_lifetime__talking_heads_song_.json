It was released in January 1981 through Sire Records as the first single from Talking Heads' fourth studio album, Remain in Light (1980).\nEno and Talking Heads developed \"Once in a Lifetime\" through extensive jams, inspired by Afrobeat musicians such as Fela Kuti. David Byrne's vocals were inspired by preachers delivering sermons, with lyrics about existential crisis and the unconscious. In the music video, directed by Byrne and Toni Basil,  Byrne dances erratically over footage of religious rituals.\n\"Once in a Lifetime\" was certified platinum in the UK in 2023. A live version, taken from the 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, charted in 1986 on the Billboard Hot 100. NPR named \"Once in a Lifetime\" one of the 100 most important American musical works of the 20th century, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame named it one of the \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\". Rolling Stone placed it at number 28 on its 2021 list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", and named its music video the 81st-best.\nProduction\nLike other songs on Remain in Light, Talking Heads and the producer Brian Eno developed \"Once in a Lifetime\" by recording jams, isolating the best parts, and learning to play them repetitively. The English musician Robert Palmer joined the jam on guitar and percussion. The technique was influenced by early hip hop and the Afrobeat music of artists such as Fela Kuti, which Eno had introduced to the band. The singer, David Byrne, likened the process to modern looping and sampling, describing the band as \"human samplers\". He said \"Once in a Lifetime\" was a result of the band trying and failing to play funk, inadvertently creating something new instead.\nThe song was initially not one of Eno's favorites, and the band almost abandoned it. The keyboardist, Jerry Harrison, said the lack of chord changes and the \"trance\"-like feeling made it hard to delineate the song into verses and choruses. However, Byrne had faith in the song and felt he could write lyrics to it. Eno developed the chorus melody by singing wordlessly, and the song \"fell into place\". Harrison developed the \"bubbly\" synthesizer arpeggio, and added the Hammond organ climax, inspired by the Velvet Underground song \"What Goes On\".\nEno interpreted the rhythm differently from the band, with the third beat of the bar as the first. He encouraged the band members to interpret the beat in different ways, thereby exaggerating different rhythmic elements. According to Eno, \"This means the song has a funny balance, with two centers of gravity – their funk groove, and my dubby, reggae-ish understanding of it; a bit like the way Fela Kuti songs will have multiple rhythms going on at the same time, warping in and out of each other.\"\nAccording to the bassist, Tina Weymouth, the drummer, Chris Frantz, created the bassline by yelling during a jam, which she mimicked on bass guitar. She wanted to leave space for the \"cacophony\" around her, and said: \"I felt like I was pounding away like a carpenter, just nailing away to get it in the groove.\" Eno removed the first bass note from the first beat of the bar, as he felt it was too \"obvious\", and rerecorded the part. When Talking Heads returned to New York City without Eno, the engineer had Weymouth record the bassline again. She said: \"It wasn't a big fight between me and Brian, as it has sometimes been portrayed, it was just a musical dispute.\"\nLyrics\nByrne improvised lines as if he were giving a sermon, with a call-and-response chorus like a preacher and congregation. His vocals are \"half-spoken, half-sung\", with lyrics about living in a \"beautiful house\" with a \"beautiful wife\" and a \"large automobile\".\nThe Guardian writer Jack Malcolm suggested that \"Once in a Lifetime\" can be read \"as an art-pop rumination on the existential ticking time bomb of unchecked consumerism and advancing age\". According to the AllMusic critic Steve Huey, the lyrics address \"the drudgery of living life according to social expectations, and pursuing commonly accepted trophies (a large automobile, beautiful house, beautiful wife)\". Although the narrator has these trophies, he questions whether they are real and how he acquired them, a kind of existential crisis. The Australian songwriter David Bridie connected the mentions of water in the gospel-like chorus to Harrison's \"watery\" synthesizer arpeggio.\nByrne denied that the lyrics address yuppie greed and said they were about the unconscious: \"We operate half-awake or on autopilot and end up, whatever, with a house and family and job and everything else, and we haven't really stopped to ask ourselves, 'How did I get here? Eno said that Byrne combined the \"blood-and-thunder intonation of the preacher\" with optimistic lyrics: \"It's saying what a fantastic place we live in, let's celebrate it. That was a radical thing to do when everyone was so miserable and grey!\"\nMusic video\ndances erratically over footage of religious rituals, dressed in a suit, bowtie and glasses.]]\nIn the \"Once in a Lifetime\" music video, Byrne appears in a large, empty white room, dressed in a suit, bowtie and glasses. In the background, inserted via bluescreen, footage of religious rituals or multiple Byrnes appears. Byrne dances erratically, imitating the movements of the rituals and moving in \"spasmic\" full-body contortions. At the end of the video, a \"normal\" version of Byrne appears in a black room, dressed in a white open-collared shirt without glasses.\nThe video was directed by Byrne and Toni Basil and choreographed by Basil. They studied archive footage of rituals by groups including African tribes, Japanese sects, people in trances, and evangelists such as Ernest Angley. Byrne said he studied \"the general phenomenon of religious ectsasy\" and derived movements from them, making them into \"a sort of spastic dance\". According to Basil, \"David kind of choreographed himself. I set up the camera, put him in front of it, and asked him to absorb those ideas. Then I left the room so he could be alone with himself ... I just helped to stylize his moves a little.\"\nTo emphasize Byrne's jerky movements, Basil used an \"old-fashioned\" zoom lens. The video was made on a low budget; Basil described it as \"about as low-tech as you could get and still be broadcastable\". Byrne wanted it to be a standalone artwork and to serve as more than a promotional product.\nRelease\nIn 1981, \"Once in a Lifetime\" reached  on the Dutch Top 40 in February and  on the UK singles chart in March. In the UK, it was certified silver in January 2018, gold in April 2021, and platinum in December 2023. At the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdowns in the US, \"Once in a Lifetime\" reached number 10 on Rock Digital Song Sales.\nA 12-inch promotional dance club mix was released in October 1984. A live version, taken from the 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, reached number 91 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1986. An early version, \"Right Start\", was released on the 2006 Remain in Light reissue.\nLegacy\nIn 2000, NPR named \"Once in a Lifetime\" one of the 100 most important American musical works of the 20th century. In 2016, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed it as one of the \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\", and Malcolm Jack wrote in The Guardian that the song \"is a thing of dizzying power, beauty and mystery [...] it sounds like nothing else in the history of pop.\" In 2018, the musician Travis Morrison appeared on NPR's All Songs Considered, where he selected \"Once in a Lifetime\" as a \"perfect song\" and said: \"The lyrics are astounding; they are meaningless and totally meaningful at the same time. That's as good as rock lyrics get.\"\nRolling Stone ranked \"Once in a Lifetime\" number 28 on its 2021 list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". In 2023, the Australian songwriter David Bridie wrote that it was the \"most perfect song of all time\", writing that it was \"cool and edgy\" and yet could be played in supermarkets. In the same year, American Songwriter named it the third-best Talking Heads song, and Record World called it \"a polyrhythmic journey through his heart of darkness ... the vocal intensity and melodic beauty are enthralling\".\nIn 1989, Spin readers voted the \"Once in a Lifetime\" video the sixth-best of the 1980s. In 2003, the BBC critic Chris Jones described the video as \"hilarious\" and \"as compelling as it was in 1981\". In 2021, Rolling Stone named it the 81st-best music video. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic recreated it in the music video for his 1989 song \"UHF\", with a similar suit and dance. In 1996, Kermit the Frog performed \"Once in a Lifetime\" on Muppets Tonight while wearing Byrne's \"big suit\" and mimicking his dances from Stop Making Sense.\nPersonnel\nTalking Heads\n*David Byrne – lead vocals, guitar\n*Jerry Harrison – synthesizer, organ, backing vocals\n*Tina Weymouth – bass\n*Chris Frantz – drums\nAdditional personnel\n*Brian Eno – synthesizer, percussion, backing vocals\n*Nona Hendryx – backing vocals\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Original version\n|-\n!Chart (1981)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australian Singles Chart\n|23\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canadian Singles Chart\n|28\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Dutch Singles Chart\n|24\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Irish Singles Chart\n|16\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles Chart\n|14\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Bubbling Under the Hot 100\n|103\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Live version\n|-\n!Chart (1985)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Dutch Singles Chart\n|22\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|New Zealand Singles Chart\n|15\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n|91\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1505240 NPR interviews David Byrne on the occasion of the Once in Lifetime box set release] on November 18, 2003"
