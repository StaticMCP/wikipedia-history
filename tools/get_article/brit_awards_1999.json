The award was sponsored by Radio One and voted for online by their listeners. At the time, Steps were arguably Britain's biggest boy/girl pop band and were also nominated. Despite this, the award was won by Belle & Sebastian. On the Saturday after the awards, a story appeared in the press alleging that the group had rigged the vote in their favour, encouraging students from two universities to vote online. However, fans argued that the band had a predominantly large student following, that band member Isobel Campbell had attended one of the universities in question, and in particular, the award ought to be given on artistic merit as opposed to popularity or CD sales.\nWhitney Houston performance\n\"Despite never taking home a solo trophy, she stunned audiences at the 1999 BRIT Awards with a spectacular performance of her anthemic hit, 'It's Not Right But It's OK.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1999 Brit Awards 1999 at Brits.co.uk]"
