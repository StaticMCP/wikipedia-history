      "text": "# Battleground (2016)\n\nThe 2016 Battleground (also known as Battlefield in Germany) was the fourth annual Battleground professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on July 24, 2016, at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. It was the last event to feature WWE's full main roster before the newly reinstated brand extension went into full effect, excluding WWE's \"Big Four\" PPVs (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series), as after the following month's SummerSlam, monthly PPVs became brand-exclusive until WrestleMania 34 in April 2018, after which, brand-exclusive PPVs were again discontinued.\nNine matches were contested at the event, including one match on the Kickoff pre-show. In addition to the regular matches, the event determined the home brand of the WWE Championship, the Intercontinental Championship, and the United States Championship. The WWE Women's Championship and WWE Tag Team Championship were not defended at the event and automatically became exclusive to Raw by default due to their respective champions being drafted to the brand in the 2016 WWE Draft that was held just prior to this event. These two championships were subsequently renamed  after other championships were later established so that each brand had a men's world championship, a women's world championship, a secondary male championship, and a male tag team championship.\nIn the main event, SmackDown's Dean Ambrose retained the WWE Championship in a triple threat match against his former Shield teammates, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns, both of whom had been drafted to Raw, thus keeping the championship on SmackDown. Also, SmackDown's The Miz defeated Raw's Darren Young to keep the Intercontinental Championship on SmackDown, and Raw's Rusev defeated SmackDown's Zack Ryder to keep the United States Championship on Raw. The show was also notable for Randy Orton's first appearance after a nine-month injury, as well as Bayley's main roster debut.\nProduction\nBackground\nin Washington, D.C.]]\nBattleground was an annual July professional wrestling event established by WWE in 2013, although the original event was held in October. Announced on March 27, 2016, the 2016 event was the fourth Battleground and took place on July 24 at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. The event aired on pay-per-view (PPV) worldwide and was livestreamed on the WWE Network. Tickets went on sale on April 9 through Ticketmaster. This was the first WWE PPV to be held after WWE reintroduced the brand extension earlier in July, where the promotion again split its main roster into two separate brands, Raw and SmackDown, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. However, excluding the \"Big Four\" PPVs (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series), the 2016 Battleground was the final monthly PPV to feature the full main roster, as after SummerSlam the following month, monthly PPVs became brand-exclusive.\nStorylines\nThe event comprised nine matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Raw and SmackDown.\nAt Money in the Bank, Dean Ambrose won the Money in the Bank ladder match and subsequently the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by cashing in his contract on Seth Rollins, who had just won the title from Roman Reigns. After a #1 contender's match between Reigns and Rollins ended in a double countout the next night on Raw, Ambrose requested to defend the title against both Reigns and Rollins. Accordingly, Shane McMahon scheduled a triple threat match between all three men for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Battleground. On June 21, two days after Money in the Bank, Reigns was suspended for 30 days for violating WWE's Wellness Program, which uses drug testing to detect substance abuse. Pro Wrestling Torch reported that WWE knew of the violation before Money in the Bank, leading to Reigns losing his world title at the event. With Reigns's suspension ending before Battleground, WWE continued to advertise Reigns as part of the Battleground main event. On the June 27 episode of Raw, both Rollins and Ambrose acknowledged Reigns's suspension on television. However, Stephanie McMahon opted not to remove Reigns from the Battleground match, and instead gave AJ Styles and John Cena the opportunity to qualify for the match by matches against Ambrose and Rollins. Styles and Cena lost when they each interfered in each other's matches. On June 27, the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was renamed as the WWE Championship. The WWE brand extension was then reinstated with Stephanie McMahon named Commissioner of Raw and Shane McMahon named Commissioner of SmackDown. On July 18, a match for the WWE Championship between Ambrose and Rollins ended in both men pinning each other simultaneously. While Raw commissioner Stephanie McMahon declared Rollins the new champion, the referee ruled the match a draw, with Ambrose retaining the title. The next day on SmackDown, Ambrose defeated Rollins in a rematch to retain the title. The same night, the 2016 WWE draft took place and Ambrose was drafted to SmackDown, while Reigns and Rollins were drafted to Raw.\nIn December 2014, at NXT TakeOver: R Evolution, Sami Zayn won the NXT Championship from Neville. After the match, Zayn's friend Kevin Owens, first congratulated and then attacked him. In February 2015, at NXT TakeOver: Rival, Owens defeated Zayn to win the NXT Championship. Zayn moved to WWE's main roster at the Royal Rumble and eliminated Owens from the Royal Rumble match. At Payback, Owens defeated Zayn. At Money in the Bank, both men failed to win the Money in the Bank ladder match. Zayn defeated Owens on the June 20 episode of Raw, and challenged Owens to another match a week later during Chris Jericho's Highlight Reel, which Owens accepted.\nAt Money in the Bank, Natalya and Becky Lynch lost a tag team match. After the match, Natalya turned heel and attacked Lynch. Natalya attacked Lynch again the following night on Raw, and proclaimed to be solely looking out for herself. On the June 27 episode of Raw, Lynch attacked Natalya, who was on commentary, before her match against Summer Rae. On the July 4 episode of Raw, a match between the two was scheduled for Battleground.\nAt Money in the Bank, AJ Styles defeated John Cena after The Club (Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) interfered, executing a Magic Killer on Cena. The following night on Raw, Styles and Gallows attacked Cena during his match against Anderson. On the June 27 episode of Raw, Cena and Styles cost each other a chance to be involved in the WWE Championship match at Battleground and then Gallows and Anderson delivered a Magic Killer to Cena on the ramp. On the July 4 episode of Raw, The Club again attacked Cena after Styles told Cena that no WWE Superstar will come out to help him. However Styles was wrong when Enzo Amore and Big Cass saved Cena. Later that night, a six-man tag team match was made between the two teams at Battleground.\nOn the July 11 episode of Raw, Darren Young won a battle royal to earn a title match against Intercontinental Champion The Miz at Battleground.\nOn the July 7 episode of SmackDown, Zack Ryder won a match against Sheamus and then challenged Rusev to a WWE United States Championship match.

On July 12, a six-man tag team between both teams was scheduled for Battleground.\nAfter her return in early June, Sasha Banks reignited her feud with Charlotte, who had formed a tag team with Dana Brooke while Sasha was on hiatus.
