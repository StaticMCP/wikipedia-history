The festival and ceremony were founded in 1962 by the Government Information Office of the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan and is now run as an independent organisation. The awards ceremony is usually held in November or December in Taipei, although the event has also been held in other locations in Taiwan in recent times.\nOverview\nSince 1990 (the 27th awards ceremony), the festival and awards has been organized and funded by the Motion Picture Development Foundation R.O.C., which set up the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival Executive Committee. The Committee consists of nine to fifteen film scholars and film scholars on the executive board, which includes the Chairman and CEO. Under the Committee, there are five different departments: the administration department for internal administrative affairs, guest hospitality and cross-industry collaboration; the marketing department which is responsible for event planning and promotion, advertising and publications; the project promotion department attending to the execution of the project meetings; the competition department which is in charge of the competition and awards ceremony; and the festival department which is devoted to festival planning, curation of films and invitation of filmmakers, subtitle transition and production and all on-site arrangements during the festival.\nThe awards ceremony is Taiwan's equivalent to the Academy Awards, and was considered among the most prestigious film awards in the Chinese-speaking world for decades until the mainland Chinese boycott in 2019. The awards are contested by Chinese-language submissions from Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China and elsewhere. It is one of the four major Chinese-language film awards, along with Hong Kong Film Award, Golden Rooster Awards and Hundred Flowers Awards, also among the most prestigious and respected film awards in the Chinese-speaking film industry. It is also one of the major annual awards presented in Taiwan along with Golden Bell Awards for television production and Golden Melody Awards for music.\nThe Golden Horse awards ceremony is held after a month-long festival showcasing some of the nominated feature films for the awards. A substantial number of the film winners in the history of the awards have been Hong Kong productions. The submission period is usually around July to August each year and nominations are announced around October with the ceremony held in November or December. Although it has been held once a year; however, it was stopped in 1964 and 1974 and boycotted in the after-ceremony in 2018. Winners are selected by a jury of judges and awarded a Golden Horse statuette during the broadcast ceremony.\nHistory\nIn May 1962, the Government Information Office of the Republic of China (ROC) enacted the \"Mandarin Film Award Regulation of Year 1962\" to officially found the Golden Horse Awards. The name Golden Horse () is a common political term that originates from the islands of Kinmen, Quemoy, or \"the Golden Gate\" ( ) and Matsu or \"the Ancestral Horse\"( ), which are under ROC control. The reasons were purely political, as these islands were ROC offshore islands that protected them from the mainland, and were heavily fortified during the Cold War. This was to imply the ROC's sovereignty over territories controlled by the People's Republic of China.\nThe awards ceremony was established to boost the Chinese-language film industry and to award outstanding Chinese-language films and filmmakers. It is one of the most prestigious awards in the film industry in Asia. It has been helping the development of movies in Chinese as it provides great support and encouragement to the filmmakers. Moreover, it intends to introduce excellent films to Taiwanese audience from around the world to stimulate exchange of ideas and inspire creativity.\nIn 2019, the China Film Administration prohibited mainland Chinese films and filmmakers from participating in the Golden Horse awards, due to political tensions stemming from a Taiwanese filmmaker's award acceptance speech advocating for Taiwan's independence in the previous year. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV cited this incident from the previous year's ceremony as the reason for the ban. Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee, who was the Golden Horse Awards Committee's chairman, commented on the situation, highlighting how politics can negatively impact the arts. Subsequently, Hong Kong director Johnnie To resigned as the jury president for the 2019 Golden Horse Awards citing prior film production commitments as the reason for his resignation.\nEntries and eligibility\nThe awards ceremony pays attention not only to commercial movies but also to artistic films and documentaries. There has been some criticism of this from those who believe that this will not help the Taiwanese commercial movie industry much. However, the awards ceremony plays a significant role in helping the movie industry and drawing more people's attention to Chinese-language movies.\nUnder current regulations, any film made primarily in the Chinese language is eligible for competition. Since 1996, a liberalization act allows for films from mainland China to enter the Awards. Several awards have been given to mainland Chinese artists and films, including Jiang Wen's In the Heat of the Sun in 1996, Best Actor for Xia Yu in 1996, Joan Chen's Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl in 1999, Best Actress for Qin Hailu in 2001 and Lu Chuan's Kekexili: Mountain Patrol in 2004.\nAwards ceremonies\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable
