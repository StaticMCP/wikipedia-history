The elections were the first to take place since the 2015 repartitioning which saw the 6 largest provinces of 11 split into 21 new ones to form in total the 26 provinces  mandated by the DRC constitution. In most of the provinces, the elected governors are members or affiliates of the Alliance of the Presidential Majority.\nInitially, the Constitutional Court ruled that President Joseph Kabila could appointed interim governors. They went on to organize elections in their regions. The Congolese opposition largely boycotted the elections or were excluded from them.\nGovernors are elected by provincial assemblies.\nResults by province\nList of the governors-elect by province.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
