After every Twenty20 International (T20I) match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team's points total is divided by the total number of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked on a table in order of rating. Teams need to have played at least eight T20I matches in the previous three to four years to remain in the rankings table.\nWorld Champions India currently lead the ICC Men's T20I team rankings, a position they have held since 21 February 2022.\nCurrent rankings\nPoints calculations\nTime period\nFind the points earned from a match\nEach time two teams play another match, the rankings table is updated as follows, based on the ratings of the teams immediately before they played. To determine the teams' new ratings after a particular match, first calculate the points earned from the match:\nIf the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the match was less than 40 points, then points will be as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\" | Match result\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\" | Points earned\n|-\n| Win || Opponent's rating + 50\n|-\n| Tie || Opponent's rating\n|-\n| Lose || Opponent's rating &minus; 50\n|}\nIf the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the match was at least 40 points, then points will be as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\" | Match result\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\" | Points earned\n|-\n| Stronger team wins || Own rating + 10\n|-\n| Weaker team loses || Own rating &minus; 10\n|-\n| style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Stronger team ties || style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Own rating &minus; 40\n|-\n| Weaker team ties || Own rating + 40\n|-\n| style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Stronger team loses || style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Own rating &minus; 90\n|-\n| Weaker team wins || Own rating + 90\n|}\nExample\nSuppose Team A, with an initial rating of 100, plays Team B. The table shows the points awarded to the two teams for 9 different initial ratings for B (ranging from 20 to 160), and the three possible match results.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: center; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Initial ratings\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"100pt\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Scenario\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"border-width:0 0 0 4px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey;background: #ffdead;\" | Team A wins & Team B loses.Points earned:\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"border-width:0 0 0 4px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey;background: #ffdead;\" | Match tied.Points earned:\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"border-width:0 1px 0 4px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey;background: #ffdead;\" | Team A loses & Team B wins.

(Unless the ratings are more than 180 apart and the weaker team wins &minus; highly unlikely.)\n* Winning always earns a team 100 points more than losing, and 50 more than tying.\n* The total points earned by the two teams is always the same as the total initial ratings of the two teams.\n* The points earned by a winning team increases as the initial rating (quality) of the opposition increases, within the constraints of earning at least its own initial rating + 10, and no more than its own initial rating + 90. A winning team therefore always earns more points than its initial rating, increasing its overall average rating.\n* The points earned by a losing team increases as the initial rating (quality) of the opposition increases, within the constraints of earning at least its own initial rating &minus; 90, and no more than its own initial rating &minus; 10. A losing team therefore always earns fewer points than its initial rating, decreasing its overall average rating.\n* In a tie, the weaker team usually earns more points than the stronger team (unless the initial ratings are at least 80 apart), reflecting the fact that a tie is a better result for the weaker team than the stronger team. Also, the stronger team will earn fewer points than its initial rating, decreasing its average, and the weaker team more points that its initial rating, increasing its average.\n* For a given result, the rule of how the two teams' points are calculated changes as the initial ratings change, from being based on teams' own ratings when one team is far stronger, to being based on the opponent's ratings when the teams are closely matched, back to being based on own ratings when the other team is far stronger. However, despite these sudden changes in the rule, the number of points awarded for each result changes smoothly as the initial ratings change.\nFind the new ratings\n* Each team's rating is equal to its total points scored divided by the total matches played. (Series are not significant in these calculations).\n* Add the match points scored to the points already scored (in previous matches as reflected by the table), add one to the number of matches played, and determine the new rating.\n* Points earned by teams depend on the opponent's ratings, therefore this system needed to assign base ratings to teams when it started.\nHistorical rankings\n'''ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings Leaders'\nThis table lists the teams that have historically held the highest rating since the T20I rankings was introduced. In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full T20I status to all its members. As a result, ratings of leading teams since 2018 have been considerably higher, and cannot be directly compared to those before that date.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
