It is believed to be the oldest building remaining in the town of Upper Marlboro and may have been built, at least in part, before 1730. Many alterations and additions were made to it in the Victorian era, including \"gingerbread\" details typical of this era. The Craufurd family cemetery is located in the woods northwest of the house.\nKingston was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  It is located in the Upper Marlboro Residential Historic District.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*, including photo in 1973, at Maryland Historical Trust website\n*\n*"
