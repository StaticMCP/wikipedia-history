The 2020 census found 24,806 people in the township.\nHistory\nA variety of indigenous peoples inhabited Ohio for centuries, among them the Adena and Hopewell cultures. After their decline, others moved in. The French colonials found in central Ohio a variety of nations, including Delaware, Miami, Mingo, Ottawa, Shawnee, and Wyandot. The latter were among the last to remain until forced out in 1843.\nThe Marcus Curtis Inn, constructed in 1822, was placed on the National Register in 1976.\nThe first European settlement of Genoa Township occurred adjacent to the eastern banks of Big Walnut Creek, which had been named by early settlers for the dense growth of black walnut trees, which grew along it. Due to the fact that much of the land was covered with dense forests, waterways such as Big Walnut Creek were a primary source of identification and transportation. In 1806, Jeremiah Curtiss of Connecticut became the first non-indigenous settler. He built a sawmill, a gristmill and a still along the bank of Big Walnut Creek. Though he moved to Marietta in 1811, his son, John Curtiss, returned to the township following the death of his father on June 21, 1813. Jeremiah's brother, Marcus, arrived in 1808 and around 1812 established the Marcus Curtiss Inn. The original inn was a log structure, but by 1822 a brick inn had been constructed. This structure still stands on Sunbury Road and is now a private residence. Both Jeremiah and Marcus are buried in Copeland Cemetery located on Yankee Street, adjacent to the eastern banks of Hoover Reservoir.\nThe Township was officially established in 1816, having been sectioned off from neighboring Harlem Township. The Township was named after Genoa, Italy, the birthplace of explorer Christopher Columbus, having been suggested by an early settler of the Township named Elisha Bennett. Unlike its namesake, the Township's name is pronounced with the stress on the second syllable, as ge-NO-a, although both pronunciations are used. Genoa Township is the only township named as such statewide. However, there is a village of Genoa located in Ottawa County, Ohio.\nA relatively large portion of the Township is consumed by the Hoover Reservoir which provides drinking water to the City of Columbus. The reservoir was constructed by damming Big Walnut Creek between Smothers Road and Central College Road and flooding the surrounding low lands. Construction began in 1953. While a dedication was held in 1955, the official opening did not occur until 1958. Numerous roads were re-routed or severed in order to construct the reservoir, including; Maxtown Road, Sunbury Road, Big Walnut Road, Oxbow Road, and Yankee Street. While swimming within the reservoir is prohibited, recreational activities such as fishing, boating, and sailing are permitted with public landings and fishing areas provided at several locations around the perimeter of the reservoir.\nGeography\nLocated in the southeastern part of Delaware County, Genoa Township is part of the central Ohio region which is anchored by Columbus. The commute from Genoa Township to the job and entertainment center of downtown Columbus is less than twenty miles.
