Communist revolution broke out in the later part of the warlord period, beginning the Chinese Civil War. The era nominally ended in 1928 at the conclusion of the Northern Expedition with the Northeast Flag Replacement, beginning the \"Nanjing decade\".  However, \"residual warlords\" continued to exist into the 1930s under de jure Kuomintang rule, and remained until the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\nThe warlords and military cliques of the Warlord Era are generally divided into the Northern factions and the Southern factions. The following is a list of cliques within each faction, and the dominant warlords within that clique.\nNorthern factions\nThe cliques in the North emerged from the fragmentation of the Beiyang Government/Army. Most of them were generals under Yuan Shikai. After the death of Yuan, they separated and formed cliques in their own sphere of influence.\nAnhui Clique\nThe Anhui clique was named so because many of its most influential members were from Anhui, including founder Duan Qirui. It had an affiliated political party, the Anfu club, and a financial wing, the New Communications clique, under Deputy Foreign Minister Cao Rulin.\nThe clique had close ties to Japan, granting concessions in exchange for funding and military training, and advocated war against the German Empire as part of the First World War, as well as military suppression of the Kuomintang.\nThe clique was removed from power after the Zhili–Anhui War and slowly faded from prominence.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  width=120px | Name !! width=51px | !! width=150px | Years of dominance !!
