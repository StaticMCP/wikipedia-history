Version, DASH 1.1, was published in December 2007 and became a DMTF standard in June 2009. Version, DASH 1.2, was published in December 2014 and became standard in June 2015.\nIn-service and out-of-service systems can be managed, with manageability aligned between the modes, independent of operating system state.  Both HTTP and HTTPS management ports are supported: TCP ports 623 and 664, respectively, for connections from remote management consoles to DASH out-of-band management access points (MAP).\nThe DMTF Common Information Model (CIM) schema defines the supported DASH management data and operations. There are 28 CIM profiles supported in the DASH 1.1 specification. 9 new profiles were added and 4 profiles were updated in DASH 1.2 specifications.\nDASH uses the DMTF's Web Services for Management (WS-Management) protocol for communication of CIM objects and services.\nThe web services expose a common set of operations for system management:\n* DISCOVER\n* GET, PUT, CREATE and DELETE management resources, such as property values & settings\n* ENUMERATE for tables and collections\n* SUBSCRIBE to and DELETE events (indication delivery)\n* EXECUTE for services (method invocation)\nManagement access point discovery\nDiscovery of access points is a two phase process:\n* Phase 1: an RMCP Presence Ping request is sent (broadcast, multicast or unicast) and an RMCP Presence Pong response is received indicating support for WS-Management.\n* Phase 2: a WS-Management \"Identify\" request is sent and response is received indicating support for DASH, which version, and which security profiles.\nProtocols\nDASH management protocols layers include:\n{|\n|+\n|-\n! Layer\n! Type\n|-\n| DASH Management Service\n| App\n|-\n| DASH CIM Profiles\n| App\n|-\n| WS-Management CIM Binding\n| App\n|-\n| Data Transfer (WS-Eventing, WS-Enum, WS-Transfer, WS-Addressing)\n| WS Layer\n|-\n| Security Profiles\n| WS Layer\n|-\n| Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) / XML\n| SOAP\n|-\n| HTTP/TLS\n| SOAP\n|-\n| TCP\n| SOAP\n|-\n| IP\n| Network\n|-\n| MAC/PHY\n|\n|}\nProfiles\nThe DMTF CIM Profiles supported by the DASH 1.1 specification:\nThe DMTF CIM Profiles supported by the DASH 1.2 specification:\nDASH is designed for desktop and mobile computer systems; a related DMTF standard for management of server computer systems is the Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware (SMASH), with a similar set of CIM Profiles.\nIntel Active Management Technology is a compliant implementation of DASH.\nSee also\n* Common Information Model (CIM)\n* WS-Management\n* Systems Management Architecture for Server Hardware (SMASH)\n* Alert Standard Format (ASF)\n* Alert on LAN\n* Wake-on-LAN (WOL)\n* IPMI -A server management interface standard covering similar functionality as DASH, but using a UDP-based protocol compared with the TCP/SOAP protocol of DASH. DASH can be implemented on top of IPMI.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dmtf.org/initiatives/dash_initiative/ DMTF DASH Initiative]\n* [http://www.dmtf.org/standards/mgmt/dash/ DMTF DASH Specifications and Technical Information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081112182821/http://www.dmtf.org/education/DASHTechNote.pdf DMTF DASH Technical Note (2007)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091026215653/http://www.dmtf.org/newsroom/pr/view?item_key=ea93ed4b0bf0ccc6731e564fa60442aa1777d903 DMTF DASH Press Release (2007)]\n* [http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP0232_1.1.0.pdf DASH 1.1 Implementation Requirements]\n* [http://www.dmtf.org/standards/published_documents/DSP2014_1.1.0.pdf DASH 1.1 White Paper]"
