The Greenbank Park ward was created as a single-member ward from most of the former Greenbank ward and a small portion of the former Mossley Hill ward. The ward boundaries follow Ullet Road (excluding Holt House), Smithdown Road, the West Coast Mainline, Rose Lane, Elmswood Road, and Mossley Hill Drive.}}\nReferences"
