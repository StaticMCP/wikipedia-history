The bridge is listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments.\nHistory\nThe bridge complex was built between 1890 and 1895 over the Danube, the Borcea branch of the Danube, and Balta Ialomiței island. When it was completed with a total length (including viaducts) of  it became the longest bridge in Europe and the second longest in the world. The bridge was designed by the Romanian engineer Anghel Saligny. The two cities on the riverbanks where it was built are Fetești on the left bank of the Borcea branch, and Cernavodă on the right bank of the main branch.\nThe crossing at Cernavodă has a central span of  and four other spans of , connected to a viaduct with 15 spans of  each. Another bridge, with three spans of  and 11 spans of , was designed and built over the Borcea branch. The two bridges have a total length of , of which  is over the Danube and  is over the Borcea. The bridges are  above the water, allowing tall ships to pass under them. Between the two bridges there was a  viaduct over Balta Ialomiței island, with 34 spans of  each.\nThe entire complex was inaugurated on 26 September 1895, and as a test on the opening, a convoy of 15 whistling locomotives sped across at 60&nbsp;km/h, followed by a train reserved for 'guests' at 80&nbsp;km/h.\nIn the 1960s, after large parts of Balta Ialomiței island were reclaimed for agriculture, the original viaduct over it was replaced with an embankment.\nThe bridge complex was used exclusively for almost a century, until 1987 when the adjacent Cernavodă Bridge complex was inaugurated.\nGallery\nFile:Podul Cernavoda.JPG|The bridge during the early 20th century\nFile:Spoorbrug Anghel Saligny over de Donau 08.jpg|Bridge archway\nFile:Cernavoda bridges 2.jpg|Anghel Saligny Bridge (right) and Cernavodă Bridge (left)\nFile:Spoorbrug Anghel Saligny over de Donau 10.jpg|Anghel Saligny Bridge over the main branch of the Danube\nFile:Rumania Puente en Fetesti sobre rio Borcea.jpg|The bridge over the Borcea branch of the Danube\nSee also\n*CFR Line 800 (BucharestMangalia)\n*Cernavodă Bridge\n*List of bridges in Romania\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?id=s0003716 King Carol I Bridge] at Structurae\n*[https://structurae.net/structures/bridge-over-the-borcea-branch Bridge over the Borcea Branch] at Structurae\n*[https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-history-of-the-Romanian-Danube-bridges-B%C4%83ncil%C4%83-Petzek/2a3ca214553c7aab09e599bde080762776aa1bfe The history of the Romanian Danube bridges (14 figures available)] at Semantic Scholar"
