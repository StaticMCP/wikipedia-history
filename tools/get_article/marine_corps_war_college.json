The college prepares officers for future senior command and staff responsibilities requiring exceptional operational competence, sound military judgment, and strategic thinking. The college is located within the Marine Corps University aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.\nHistory\nOn 1 August 1990, the 29th Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Alfred M. Gray, Jr., instituted the Art of War Studies program under the Marine Corps Command and Staff College. General Gray's vision was to establish a \"world-class educational institution for the study of war and the profession of arms.\" The original seminar was attended by six lieutenant colonels and was ten months long. The course of study matured into the current College and was patterned after other United States military senior-level service colleges. By 1999, the college became an accredited JPME Phase-I institution, enrolling 16 students from all five branches of the Armed Forces and various government agencies. In 2002, the college received full accreditation from both the United States Department of Education and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to confer a Master of Strategic Studies degree. In 2006, the college received JPME Phase-II accreditation. In 2009, the college expanded its student population and opened enrollment to include international military officers. The maximum enrollment each academic year is 30 students. In 2011, the college published the inaugural edition of the \"MCWAR Papers\" in cooperation with the Marine Corps University Press. The MCWAR papers is compilation of  analytical papers by the college's students on strategic-level issue .\nMCWAR is located in Dunlap Hall aboard Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. Dunlap Hall is named in honor of Brigadier General Robert H. Dunlap, USMC.\nCurriculum\nThe curriculum is designed to ensure officers \"develop intellectual and technical approaches to warfighting and strategic thinking, hone military judgment, evaluate methodologies, expand academic expertise, and sharpen teaching skills through reading, research, writing, and participation in seminars.\"  In order to achieve this, the curriculum partners military competence with political, economic, social, and informational studies which converge to form a complete national strategy.  Collaborative efforts  provide a diverse educational experience:  students routinely interact with policy makers such as the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the FBI, the National Security Adviser, and members of congress.  Non-government agencies such as JP Morgan, the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Stock Exchange, and J Walter Thompson  also  supplement the college's coursework.  Domestic and international travel opportunities are integrated with the curriculum. These travel opportunities have included trips to Unified Combatant Commands such as United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) as well as international trips to allies in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.\nThe curriculum is a ten-month resident program consisting of 33-38 credit hours in the following core courses:\n*Leadership and Ethics\n*Campaigning & Warfare\n*National Security\n*Joint Warfighting\n*Diplomacy and Statecraft\n*Advanced Studies Program\nExtracurricular educational activities are offered through the auspices of The Marine Corps University, Library of the Marine Corps (Alfred M. Gray Research Center), National Museum of the Marine Corps, Marine Corps University Foundation, and Marine Corps Heritage Foundation.\nGraduates are awarded a Master of Strategic Studies degree and JPME Phase II certification by the President of the Marine Corps University. The degree is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.\nStudents and admissions\nAdmission to the college is based on allocations granted by the Commandant of the Marine Corps and are solicited each academic year through a Marine Administrative Message.
