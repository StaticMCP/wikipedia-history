Educated at Eggar's Grammar School in Alton, Hampshire, he joined the BBC as a tape editor before becoming a studio manager for BBC Radio 1. In 1970 he joined the Radiophonic Workshop, where he remained until 1981. His initial work was mostly signature tunes for BBC radio and TV programmes. He later recorded incidental music for programmes including The Changes, two versions of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the second radio series and the TV adaptation), and several serials of Doctor Who. His work on the latter series included incidental music for several serials in the early 1980s.\nOther well-known series with music by Kingsland are Around the World in 80 Days and Pole to Pole'', both travel series by Michael Palin. Kingsland also wrote music for many schools' television series, including Words and Pictures, Rat-a-tat-tat, Watch, Numbercrew, Storytime, English Express, Music Makers, Hotch Potch House and the Look and Read stories \"Joe and the Sheep Rustlers\" and \"The Boy from Space\". He also wrote music for the CITV series “Blips”, produced by Ragdoll Productions.\nSince leaving the BBC, Kingsland has composed music for the KPM music library, television, commercials and corporate videos. He owns his own studio, PK Studios.\nIn 1973, Fourth Dimension, a compilation of his early signature tune work for the Radiophonic Workshop, was released. In 2002, his incidental scores for the Doctor Who serials \"Meglos\" and \"Full Circle\" featured as part of the Doctor Who at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop compilation series. KPM has issued eight albums of his library music work.\nDiscography\nCommercial albums\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !!
