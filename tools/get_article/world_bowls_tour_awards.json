The annual event is usually held in January, which take place just before the World Indoor Bowls Championships begins. The annual World Bowls Tour Hall of Fame induction happens at the annual awards ceremony too, which was launched along with the inaugural World Bowls Tour Awards ceremony in 2008.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:30px;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:240px;\"| Awards\n! style=\"width:300px;\"| Winner\n! style=\"width:10px;\"| Ref\n|-\n| 2008\n| WBT Player of the YearPlayers' Player of the YearYoung Player of the YearPerformance of the YearLifetime Achievement AwardWBT Hall of Fame inductees\n|  Alex Marshall Paul Foster Jamie Chestney Paul Foster The Potters Resort Richard Corsie Tony Allcock Paul Foster David Bryant Alex Marshall\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n|WBT Player of the YearPlayers' Player of the YearFans' Player of the YearYoung Player of the YearPerformance of the YearBest Qualifying PerformanceShot of the YearLifetime Achievement AwardServices to Bowls AwardWBT Hall of Fame inductee\n|  Alex Marshall Mark Royal Greg Harlow Andrew Walters Mark Royal Darren Burnett Simon Skelton Wynne Richards Nigel Oldfield Andy Thomson\n|\n|-\n| 2010\n| WBT Player of the YearPlayers' Player of the YearFans' Player of the YearYoung Player of the YearPerformance of the YearBest Qualifying PerformanceShot of the YearLifetime Achievement AwardServices to Bowls AwardWBT Hall of Fame inductee\n|  Paul Foster Paul Foster Mervyn King Robert Chisholm Billy Jackson Stewart Anderson Ian Bond Ken Fawcett /  John Price David Rhys Jones David Gourlay\n|\n|-\n| 2011\n| WBT Player of the YearPlayers' Player of the YearFans' Player of the YearYoung Player of the YearPerformance of the YearBest Qualifying PerformanceShot of the YearFour TouchersLifetime Achievement awardServices to Bowls AwardUnsung Heroes Award\n|  Mervyn King Mervyn King Greg Harlow Stuart Anderson Stuart Anderson Robert Paxton Robert Paxton Robert Paxton Andy Thomson Dales Sports Surfaces Anglia Bowls Stewards\n|\n|-\n| 2012\n| WBT Player of the YearPlayers' Player of the YearFans' Player of the YearBest Qualifying PerformanceShot of the Year\n|  Paul Foster Paul Foster Greg Harlow Robert Paxton Paul Foster\n|\n|-\n| 2013\n| WBT Player of the YearPlayers' Player of the YearFans' Player of the YearPerformance of the YearShot of the YearLifetime Achievement AwardService to Bowls AwardWBT Hall of Fame inductee\n|  Andy Thomson Andy Thomson Paul Foster Paul Foster Paul Foster Anne Dunwoodie Sandra McLeish Alison Merrien\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n| Fans' Player of the YearPerformance of the YearLifetime Achievement Award\n|  Alex Marshall Alex Marshall Willie Wood\n|\n|-\n| 2015\n| WBT Player of the YearPlayers’ Player of the YearYoung Bowler of the YearMatch of the YearPerformance of the YearBest Qualifying PerformanceFour TouchersLifetime Achievement AwardServices to Bowls Award\n|  Nick Brett Nick Brett Katherine Rednall Nick Brett vs  Mervyn King Darren Burnett Billy Jackson Jonathan Ross David Gourlay Mark Hedges\n|\n|-\n| 2016\n| Player of the YearPlayers Player of the YearYoung Player of the YearPerformance of the YearMatch of the YearBest European Qualifying PerformanceBest Overseas Qualifying PerformanceLifetime AchievementServices to Bowls\n|  Nick Brett Nick Brett Connor Cinato  Alex Marshall David Gourlay vs  Andy Thomson Jamie Chestney Neil Furman Sandra McLeish John Taylor\n|\n|-\n| 2017\n| Player of the YearPlayers Player of the YearYoung Player of the YearPerformance of the YearMatch of the YearBest European Qualifying PerformanceBest Overseas Qualifying PerformanceWBT Hall of Fame inducteeServices to Bowls\n|  Nick Brett Nick Brett Joseph Mower  David Gourlay Nick Brett vs  Stewart Anderson Trevor Taylor Murray Glassey Darren Burnett Dewars Centre & Perth Indoor Bowls Club\n|\n|-\n| 2018\n| Player of the YearPlayers Player of the YearYoung Player of the YearPerformance of the YearMatch of the YearBest European Qualifying PerformanceBest Overseas Qualifying PerformanceWBT Hall of Fame inducteeLifetime Achievement Award\n|  Paul Foster Jamie Chestney Ellen Ryan  Jamie Chestney Mark Dawes vs  Stewart Anderson Graham McKee Gary Pickering John Price David Rhys Jones\n|\n|-\n| 2019\n| Player of the YearPlayers Player of the YearPerformance of the YearMatch of the YearBest European Qualifying PerformanceBest Overseas Qualifying PerformanceWBT Hall of Fame inducteeLifetime Achievement AwardServices to Bowls\n|  David Gourlay Mark Dawes Michael Stepney Michael Stepney vs  Paul Foster Colin Walker Dan LeMessurier Greg Harlow Alex Marshall Janice Gower\n|\n|}\nReferences"
