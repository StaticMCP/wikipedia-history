Founded in 1983, the Vikings are known as one of Europe's most dominant clubs, having won the Eurobowl title five times (2004&ndash;2007 and 2013), as well as being the runner-up five times (2001, 2003, 2008, 2010 and 2012). In the national championship, the Vikings hold the record of 16 Austrian Bowl victories. Since the 2022 season, they’ve been members of the European League of Football. The second team is still part of the Austrian Football League (AFL).\nHistory\nThe Vikings were founded in 1983. Three years later, the Vikings made it to the Austrian Bowl, the Austrian championship game, where they fell short against the Graz Giants. In 1994, the Vikings won their first national championship and repeated the victory two years later. In 1999, the Vikings played their eighth Austrian Bowl, all of them against the Giants, and gained their third title. It was also their first of five consecutive Austrian Bowl wins. Until 2007 the Vikings made it always to the Austrian Bowl and collected two more national titles becoming the team with the record number of 10 Austrian Bowl wins. From 2012 to 2017 the Vikings won four more national titles.\nAfter also competing in the European Football League for many years, the club took part in a new European competition from 2014 to 2018 the BIG6 European Football League.\nNaming rights\n*1983–1998: Vienna Vikings\n*1999–2005: Chrysler Vikings\n*2006–2007: Dodge Vikings Vienna\n*2008–2014: Raiffeisen Vikings Vienna\n*2015–2016: Vienna Vikings\n*2017– Dacia Vienna Vikings\nNotable persons\n* George Paton (American football executive) - Defensive back 1993\n* Mark Helfrich - Quarterback 1997\n* Bernhard Seikovits - Vikings youth and senior\n* Bernhard Raimann - Vikings youth\n* Stacy Collins - DC 1999–2001\n* Tony Hunt - RB 2011\n* Thomas Smythe - Head coach 1994-2006\nEuropean League of Football\nOn September 25, 2021 the Vienna Vikings announced their that their first team will compete in the 2022 European League of Football season together with their league rival Tyrolean Raiders The coaching staff of the former AFL team will continue coaching the ELF team.
