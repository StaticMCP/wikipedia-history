He or she is first in the line of presidential succession, and serves as acting president when the president is outside the country's borders or otherwise unable to fulfil the duties of the office. The vice president is also a member of the National Assembly and the cabinet. The vice president is constitutionally required to 'assist the president in the execution of the functions of government,' and may be assigned any government portfolio by presidential proclamation.\nThe position of the vice president was established in 2014 along with several other constitutional amendments. The position is controversial due to its unclear portfolio. Nickey Iyambo served as the first vice president of Namibia from 2015 to 2018. Currently, the vice president is Lucia Witbooi since 22 March 2025.\nList of officeholders\n;Political parties\n|South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:80px;\" | Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! colspan=\"3\" | Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Political party\n|-\n!
