He lived in Wilmington, Kent on the high road from London to Dover.\nCareer\nAbout 1619 he was a member of a group of merchants who loaned the Pilgrims on the Mayflower eighteen hundred pounds. He emigrated to colonial America about 1628 or 1629. While at Piscataqua (now Portsmouth, New Hampshire), in care of the fishery and fishing fleet, he was appointed on November 27, 1629, Attorney of the President and Council to take possession and deliver to Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Mason the patented grant of Laconia.\nFirst settled as early as 1623, the southern part of Kittery was once called Champernowne's after Sir Francis Champernowne, a prominent pioneer and landowner. Nicholas Shapleigh built the first house in the area, and Edward Godfrey established a trading post in 1632.\nIn 1634, he was chosen as one of the referees to divide the patents of Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Mason. William Gorges, designated Governor, had Godfrey as one of his councilors.\nGodfrey visited England during 1637 and 1638, during which he made a successful plea during a quo warranto trial against surrendering the Massachusetts charter. He returned with the charters for the general territory and those for the  creation of Agamenticus into a municipal corporation and metropolitan of the province. In general government he was named one of the councilors and first on the list of eight aldermen for the borough, and judge of the municipal court. Under the city charter, he became mayor of Georgeana.\nIn July 1649, he became the first governor of the Province of Maine, and was reelected for three successive terms.\nIn December 1651, the charter of Massachusetts, which had been defended by Godfrey when her own representatives could not during the trial of the quo warranto writ, was interpreted to claim the heritage of Sir Ferdinando Gorges and force was used. As Governor, Godfrey drew up a letter to the English Parliament asking for protection. The town was taken by force and the citizens accepted Massachusetts, and Godfrey did so, with mental reservations, after the vote was taken.\nThe authorities of Massachusetts appointed him councilor of the province, but his enemies shared and divided his estate. He sailed to England to place his grievances before the courts. Living on borrowed money for years, he ended in the debtors' prison, Ludgate, London, England.\nPersonal life\nGodfrey married Ann Merjant and they had Oliver, Mary Smith, Sarah, Oliver, and Charles.\nIt is unknown when Godfrey died; he was buried in a pauper's unmarked grave. The last known letter from him was dated April 1663.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=v4NSLnBIB8cC&dq=Edward+Godfrey+Massachusetts+Bay+Colony&pg=PA24 Edward Godfrey: His Life, Letters, and Public Services, 1584-1664]"
