In April 2022, Harrison Ford, Jessica Williams, Christa Miller, Michael Urie, Luke Tennie, and Lukita Maxwell joined the cast, with James Ponsoldt joining the production as a director and executive producer. Production began in April 2022. The first season has a total of ten episodes. The series theme song \"Frightening Fishes\" was written by Ben Gibbard and Tom Howe.\nDuring a 2023 interview with Harrison Ford for The Hollywood Reporter, author James Hibberd reminded Ford that he had said in 2002 that he was content to work only once per year and asked him why he had accepted the offer to play Dr. Paul Rhoades. Ford replied that he wanted to try new things after a period of not doing as much work as he wished due to the COVID-19 pandemic and his commitments to the titular role of the long-delayed Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. As with his role in 1923, Ford accepted the Shrinking role despite there not being a script at the time, trusting that Segel, Goldstein, Lawrence and Brian Gallivan would deliver him a good script.\nIn March 2023, Apple TV+ renewed the series for a second season. In June 2024, Ashley Nicole Black joined the second season as a writer and a cast member in an undisclosed capacity. The season filmed from January to June 2024. Ted McGinley, who had a recurring role in the first season, was promoted to series regular for the second season. The show was pitched to Apple as a three-season-show, but the creators are open to continue if a fitting story emerges. On October 17, 2024, Apple TV+ renewed the series for a third season. Filming for the third season began in mid-February 2025 and concluded on July 16, 2025.\nRelease\nShrinking was released on January 27, 2023, with the first two episodes premiering together and the rest releasing on a weekly basis on Apple TV+. The second season premiered on October 16, 2024. The third season is scheduled to premiere on January 28, 2026, with a one-hour episode and the rest debuting on a weekly basis until the season finale on April 8.\nReception\nCritical response\nSeason 1\nFor the first season, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 91% approval rating based on 95 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Shrinking has darker ideas on its mind than its earnest approach can often translate, but Jason Segel and Harrison Ford's sparkling turns make these characters worth close analysis.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 68 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nKristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a B+ and described the series as \"a funny, brainy grief-com about the power—and dangers—of radical honesty.\" Chicago Sun-Timess Richard Roeper gave a rating of 3.5 out of 4 stars and said, \"You never know what goes on behind the scenes, but one gets the feeling Ford is having a great time on this show. We're sure having a great time watching it.\"  Writing for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson stated, \"The overall sense is a little like laughing at a funeral; the human impulses are familiar, a little perverse and somehow comforting.\"\nSeason 2\nThe second season received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has a 97% approval rating based on 82 critic reviews.
