Among its other features are the ability to convert from NTSC to PAL and vice versa, and the ability to upscale from standard-definition video to high-definition video with feature detail detection to prevent serious quality losses. Filters and effects, such as de-noising or timestamp generation, can be applied to video during the conversion process, and the video can be cropped.\nCompressor could be used with the discontinued Qmaster for clustering, or configured as a server to work on the jobs submitted by other computers on the network.\nWith its update to 4.2 in April 2015, Apple added performance upgrades, as well as the ability to use Compressor to produce a compliant package to submit video content for distribution to the iTunes Store.\nCompressor supports creating files for Blu-ray discs.\nReferences\nExternal links and references\n* [https://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/compressor/ Apple Compressor 4]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060325001942/http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/Compressor_2_User_Manual.pdf Apple Compressor 2 User Manual] (PDF)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060907060816/http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/Compressor_New_Features.pdf New Features in Compressor 2] (PDF)"
