Bad Manners. It peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart.\nReception\nReviewing the song for Record Mirror, Sunie Fletcher wrote \"Buster and the boys pull themselves out of their role as a second-rate Madness, only to emerge as… would you believe a third-rate UB40? The exuberance of their previous works has vanished, leaving behind a listless, limber reggae item which seems to drift on for far more than its three minutes 26 seconds\". However, Ian Birch for Smash Hits'' wrote \"It's amazing how Bad Manners can look so slobby and make such a sophisticated single. This is a dapper pop song with an ambling reggae gait and some fine instrumental breaks\".\nTrack listing\n7\": Magnet / MAG 197\n# \"Walking in the Sunshine\" – 3:26\n# \"End of the World\" – 2:57\n12\": Magnet / 12 MAG 197\n# \"Walking in the Sunshine\" (Extended Version) – 5:33\n# \"End of the World\" – 2:57\n# \"Night Bus to Dalston\" (Vocals Version) – 2:14\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1981)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
