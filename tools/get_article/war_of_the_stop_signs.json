In 1866, the third Bayonne Treaty established that the path (now road) that connected Llívia with Puigcerdà was of \"free movement\" to ease the crossing to some grazing lands the town owns inside French territory.\nlocation (green) surrounded by French territory (red). In light color the rest of the Province of Girona and also in green the rest of the Spanish territory]]\nIn the early 1970s, the French government built stop signs on the road forcing traffic to stop and yield to the French roads. The Spanish residents repeatedly tore down the stop signs, stating that they violated the \"free movement\" of the road that the treaty established. Finally, in the early 1980s, the Spanish government financed the construction of a bridge over one of the French roads. The French government changed the priority rules of the second crossing so the oncoming road had to yield to the N-154 / D-68. This second crossing now has a roundabout.\nOnly cars with a Spanish registration plate could use the Llívia to Puigcerdà road until 1995, when the Schengen Treaty provided for unrestricted movement between the two countries.\nReferences"
