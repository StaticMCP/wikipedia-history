In May 2019, Deadline Hollywood reported that co-executive producer Josh Reims would succeed co-creator Sallie Patrick as executive producer and showrunner for season three. On January 7, 2020, Dynasty was renewed for a fourth season.\nCasting\nIn July 2019, it was announced that Ana Brenda Contreras would not be returning for season three for personal reasons, and that Daniella Alonso would take over the role of Cristal. In August 2019, it was reported that Michael Michele had been promoted to a series regular for the third season, and it was announced in October 2019 that Adam Huber had been promoted to a series regular as well. On September 5, 2019, Ken Kirby was announced to be joining the show in a recurring role as Evan Tate, Trixie's older brother. Kelli Barrett and Jade Payton also joined the show in recurring roles, Barrett acting as Adam's nurse, Nadia, and Payton portraying Dominique's stepdaughter, Vanessa.\nOn October 28, 2019, it was announced that the role of Alexis Carrington had been recast with Elaine Hendrix, who would appear as a series regular. The CW noted that \"Alexis is back in Atlanta, with a new look, a new man, and plenty of scores to settle\". Hendrix debuted as Alexis in \"The Sensational Blake Carrington Trial\". In February 2020, it was announced that Wil Traval had been cast to recur as Father Caleb Collins, a \"young, charming and irreverent priest with a soft spot for the disabled vets who rehab in the hospital's clinic.\" He was teased as a potential love interest for Cristal. Danny Trejo appeared as himself in the May 2020 episode \"Robin Hood Rescues\".\nFilming\nProduction of Dynasty was suspended in March 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming of only 20 of the 22 ordered episodes of the third season had been completed at that time. Gillies said, \"So there is no finale at this juncture, and there is no episode before the finale. So it ends in a very weird place ... I don't know if we'll pick up the finale later, I’m not sure what the plan is. It certainly shouldn't end on the episode we finished, because it's just really random and nothing’s resolved. I apologize if it does.\" It was later confirmed that the 20th episode of the season, \"My Hangover's Arrived\", would serve as the season finale, though it has not been announced whether the remaining two episodes of the season will be produced later.\nReims said in May 2020 that the writers had been building to Fallon and Liam's wedding all season, and it was \"frustrating\" to not be able to film the last two episodes. Hoping to use reworked versions of the two scripts to start the fourth season, Reims teased Blake going to war with Alexis, Jeff and Adam; Sam's new relationship with Ryan; and the return of the Moldavians.\nBroadcast\nSeason three of Dynasty premiered on October 11, 2019, and the season finale aired on May 8, 2020.
