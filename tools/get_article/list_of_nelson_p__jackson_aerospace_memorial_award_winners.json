Jackson, a founder and first president of the National Space Club. This award is the club's second most prestigious honor and it recognizes outstanding contributions to advancements in the missile, aircraft, and space fields.\nDescribed by NASA as “the space world's equivalent of an Academy Award\" it is presented annually by the National Space Club during the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Dinner in Washington, D.C.\nNelson P. Jackson was a highly decorated Air Force colonel, involved in the military atomic energy program, and had served with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was also a prominent D.C. attorney and the D.C. manager for GE's Atomic Energy Division.\nThe National Space Club is the premier non-profit organization dedicated to advancing space leadership, technology, and education in the United States. Bringing together industry leaders, government officials, educators, and private individuals, the club fosters collaboration in astronautics and ensures that critical space-related information is shared with the public.\nList of Nelson P.
