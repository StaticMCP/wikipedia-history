It provides insight into the lives of the Ancestral Puebloans and the Navajo, Ute, and Apache peoples. Geological features include canyons, volcanic rock features, and sandstone buttes. Several of the sites are scenic and wilderness areas with recreational opportunities.\nRoute description\n]]\nThe Trail of the Ancients captures the archaeological evidence of hunter and gatherers who lived in the area from 10,000&nbsp;B.C. or earlier, in the northwestern portion of the state. The Ancient Puebloans that lived in the area between about 850 and 1250&nbsp;A.D. are the ancestors of the modern Hopi, Zuni and Rio Grande Pueblo tribes. Navajos, from the Athabascan tribal areas in northwestern Canada, migrated into the area about 500 years ago. Other Native Americans include the Utes and Apaches.\nNative peoples left evidence of their lives in ruins of agricultural communities, broken pieces of pottery, tools, pictographs, and petroglyphs. The landscape includes large sandstone formations, desolate deserts, interesting views, and geologic formations.\nA key site on the byway are the ruins at Chaco Canyon, which was the \"ceremonial center\" for puebloan people at that and outlying pueblos between 850 and 1250&nbsp;A.D. Other key sites are the El Morro National Monument and El Malpais National Monument.\nA great portion of the land in northwestern New Mexico belongs to the Navajo Nation. The route traverses multiple roads, including U.S. Route&nbsp;64, U.S. Route&nbsp;550, NM&nbsp;57, NM&nbsp;122 and other state, county and Navajo Nation roads.\nChaco Culture National Historic Park\nChaco Culture National Historical Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that was inhabited in the canyon between 850 and 1250&nbsp;A.D., is the center and starting point for the byway. It is located in a remote location on a rugged road. To reach the Chaco Culture site, follow National Park Service signs from U.S. Route&nbsp;550, turning first onto County Road 7900. There are a visitor center, six monumental sites, and a trail to other sites.\nCrownpoint\nat Crownpoint]]\nOn NM&nbsp;57 drive south of the park to NM&nbsp;371 and drive south to Crownpoint, known for its monthly auction of Navajo rugs.\nCasamero Pueblo\nContinue south on NM&nbsp;371 to Navajo Road&nbsp;48.

There are about 1,500 Navajo people living near the trading posts, some of whom who sell their woven rugs at the trading posts.\nFarmington\nFarmington, where two thirds of the surface water in New Mexico flows through area rivers, is north on U.S. Route&nbsp;64.  Recreational trails and the Farmington Museum are key sites.\nAztec Ruins National Monument\nTwo pueblo ruins at the Aztec Ruins National Monument, an outlier of the Chacoan Canyon site, are near Bloomfield, which is east of Farmington off of U.S.&nbsp;64.\nBadlands recreation areas\nSouth of Bloomfield off of NM&nbsp;371, in the badlands of New Mexico, are the Bisti Wilderness Area, De-Na-Zin Wilderness Area, and Angel Peak Scenic Areas.\nBeklabito\nBeklabito (also spelled Beclabito), a Navajo community, is located west on U.S.&nbsp;64.
