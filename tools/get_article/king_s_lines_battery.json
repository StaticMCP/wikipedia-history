It is part of the North Front defences of the Rock of Gibraltar together with Couvreport Battery, Hanover Battery, Bomb Proof Battery and the tunnel system. This is a Class A listed building as designated by the Government of Gibraltar's Gibraltar Heritage Trust Act of 1989.\nThe King's Lines occupy part of much older Moorish or Spanish Lines already in use during the siege of 1704. They are clearly shown on maps of Gibraltar from 1627. The Lines were named soon after the 1704 Capture of Gibraltar after the Archduke Charles of Austria otherwise known as Charles III, King of Spain. It was on his behalf that Gibraltar was captured by the allied forces in 1704.\nReferences"
