The object is to sink the opponent's entire fleet (six ships) without him sinking the player's fleet first.\nThis version of the game had the particularity of allowing fire by salvos of up to 24 shots, depending on the number of unsunk ships the player had. After all shots were placed by the player, a scene showing a ship firing its guns at the enemy fleet was played, showing hits and damage. The game could be played in Hotseat, since each player's fleet placement was never shown after the game had started proper.\nThere also have been other versions of the battleship game for various consoles and handheld devices, including Battleship.\nReviews\n* Computer and Video Games (CVG) (September 1987)\n* The Games Machine (UK) (December 1987)\n* ASM (Aktueller Software Markt) (October 1990)\n* Commodore User (September 1987)\n* ASM (Aktueller Software Markt) (September 1987)\n* ST Action (June 1988)\n* Computer and Video Games (CVG) (June 1990)\n* Commodore User (April 1988)\n* Info (January 1989)\n* Your Sinclair (September 1988)\n* Zero (May 1990)\n* ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment) (May 1988)\n* Happy Computer (September 1987)\n* ASM (Aktueller Software Markt) (October 1987)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
