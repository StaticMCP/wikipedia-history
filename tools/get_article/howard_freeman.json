He did not enter the film industry until he was over 40, in 1942, when he played a small uncredited role in Inflation. Despite his late start in film acting, Freeman would build himself a fairly substantial career in that field that would last over twenty three years. From 1943 onward he worked on a regular basis, sometimes in uncredited roles, but more often than not in small but credited bit or supporting parts. He appeared in ten films in 1943, and another eighteen from 1944 through 1945. In 1946 Freeman would appear in twelve films, the most notable of which was his first film of that year, Abilene Town, starring Randolph Scott and Lloyd Bridges, and California, starring Barbara Stanwyck and Ray Milland.\nFrom 1947 through 1950 Freeman appeared in twenty films, and in 1951 he began appearing on numerous television series, which would be his main acting roles for the remainder of his career, lasting into 1965. He appeared in three episodes of Studio One, along with many other TV series, including Car 54, Where Are You? and Route 66. He retired from film and television acting in 1965, and settled into retirement in New York City, where he was living at the time of his death on December 11, 1967.\nBroadway roles\n* The Star-Wagon (1937) as Apfel\n* Knickerbocker Holiday (1938) as Schermerhorn\n* The Unconquered (1940) as Karp Morozov\n* Liliom (1940) (revival) as policeman and as the richly dressed man\nSelected filmography\n* Margin for Error (1943) as Otto Horst\n* The Human Comedy (1943) as Reverend Holly (uncredited)\n* Slightly Dangerous (1943) as Mr. Quill\n* Air Raid Wardens (1943) as J.
