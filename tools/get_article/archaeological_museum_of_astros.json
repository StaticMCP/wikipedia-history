It is located in a building which has been used as Karytsiotis school, since the second half of the twentieth century. In 1985, the building was converted into a museum by the Ephor of Antiquities, Dr. Theodoros Spyropoulos. The courtyard of the building was similarly adapted into an archaeological park.\nSee also\n* Anthene (Cynuria)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100929131945/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh151.jsp?obj_id=3293 Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism]"
