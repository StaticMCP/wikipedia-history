It took place on 15 September 1894 in Pyongyang, Korea between the forces of Meiji Japan and Qing China. It is sometimes referred to archaically in Western sources as the \"Battle of Ping-yang\".\nAbout 20,000 Chinese troops of the Huai Army under the overall command of General Ye Zhichao had arrived in Pyongyang on 4 August 1894. They had made extensive repairs to its ancient city walls, feeling themselves secure in their superior numbers and in the strength of the defenses. The Huai Army had China's best troops, and they were equipped with modern weaponry, including Mauser breechloader rifles, Krupp artillery pieces, and a large quantity of ammunition. The Chinese military command intended that Pyongyang would be their headquarters in Korea.\nPrince Yamagata Aritomo's First Army, of the Imperial Japanese Army, converged on Pyongyang from several directions on 15 September 1894. In the morning he made a direct attack on the north and southeast corners of the walled city under very little cover. The Chinese defense was strong, but was outmaneuvered by an unexpected flanking attack by the Japanese from the rear. This caused the Chinese very heavy losses compared to the Japanese. After the battle the Japanese captured a large amount of Chinese rifles, artillery pieces, and ammunition that was left behind.\nAfter their defeat at Pyongyang, the Chinese abandoned northern Korea and withdrew to the Yalu River, which formed the Chinese–Korean border. With the loss in Korea of the Qing dynasty's best trained forces, their army in Manchuria was reinforced by less capable and partially reformed Green Standard units.\nBackground\nChinese preparations at Pyongyang\nAlthough the Chinese were defeated by the Japanese at Seonghwan, the bulk of the Chinese forces in Korea was not stationed near Seonghwan but in the northern city of Pyongyang.\nThe city lies on the right bank of the Taedong River, which was large enough to provide a shipping route to the sea. Of the Chinese troops deployed at Pyongyang, eight thousand arrived at the city by sea and another five thousand made the overland journey from Manchuria. The forces in Pyongyang were joined by retreating Chinese troops from Asan under Ye Zhichao. By Chinese standards, the troops in Pyongyang had received modern training and equipment. Some of the infantry carried American Winchester rifles, and they also had four field artillery pieces, six machine-guns and twenty-eight mountain guns. These weapons, however, were not standardized and a major concern was the proper supply of ammunition.\nBetween early August and mid-September, the Chinese troops in Pyongyang reinforced the walled stronghold with massive earthworks, and the location of the city itself contributed to a substantial defensive position. Directly to the north were hills, and the highest of these – Moktan-tei –  overlooked the entire area. To the east and south was the broad Taedong river, where forts had been built to deter any enemy from crossing. The terrain was open only to the southwest; this was where the Chinese had constructed solid redoubts.\nJapanese advance to Pyongyang\nAfter the victory  at Seonghwan, the Japanese reinforced a brigade of 8,000 soldiers – under the command of General Oshima. More than 7,000 of these troops were concentrated at Seoul and Chemulpo. The Japanese now controlled the southern and central part of the country. However, as the Chinese still had most of their troops in the northern Korea, the Japanese military situation required an immediate deployment of reinforcements to Korea.\nSince the main objective of the Japanese was the Chinese force concentrated at Pyongyang, they had four routes on which to deploy their troops to Pyongyang – one through via Chemulpo, another through Pusan, one from Wonsan on the eastern coast of Korea or by landing directly at the mouth of the Taedong River in the immediate vicinity of Pyongyang. Since the Japanese were hard pressed for time, as part of their strategy they needed to drive the Chinese troops from Korea before winter to avoid prolonged military operations. Thus the route through Pusan was rejected. Although transporting the troops there would not have been a problem for the Japanese as the transports would remain safely beyond the reach of the Chinese Fleet. The Japanese troops would have to travel over 650&nbsp;km by land to reach Pyongyang; however, the condition of Korean roads required much time to reach Pyongyang. The Japanese decided to transport  their forces to Chemulpo on the west coast and with some to Wonsan, on the east. It was still not easy to reach Pyongyang from Wonsan, again due to the condition of Korean roads, but the distance was only about 160&nbsp;km  and the harbour was completely safe as Japanese transports could sail there without escort. The Japanese did exclude the idea of landing troops at the mouth of the Taidong River; however, due to the risk of such operation, it was considered a last resort.\nIn  Japan, a fleet of 30 transports had been commandeered for the conflict, assembled near the port of Hiroshima – the primary harbour for embarkation to Korea. They were to depart in groups, heading to Korea without escort, transports to Chemulpo would be escorted by warships. The number of transports allowed the Japanese to redeploy no more than 10–15,000 troops to Korea at a time, this was also taking into consideration the fact that apart from soldiers there were substantial numbers of coolies, equipment and supplies to be transported meaning that the Japanese were able to redeploy one brigade at a time.\nJapanese strategy\nThe 10,000 troops (not confirmed) of the Imperial Japanese  1st Army, under the overall command of Marshal Yamagata Aritomo consisted of the 5th Provincial Division (Hiroshima) under Lieutenant General, and the 3rd Provincial Division (Nagoya) under Lieutenant General Katsura Tarō. Japanese forces had landed at Chemulpo (modern Inchon, Korea) on 12 June 1894 without opposition. After a brief sortie south for the Battle of Seonghwan on 29 July 1894, the First Army moved towards Pyongyang, rendezvousing with reinforcements, which had landed via the ports of Busan and Wonsan.\nAlthough the Japanese forces were under the overall command of General Yamagata and he was responsible for orchestrating the strategy at Pyongyang, Yamagata did not land with his forces at Chempulo until 12 September. Lieutenant-General Nozu Michitsura commanded the Japanese troops involved in the attack on Pyongyang; which included the Wonson column under Colonel Sato Tadashi, the Sangnyong column under Major-General Tatsumi Naobumi, the Combined Brigade under Major-General Oshima Yoshimasa and finally the Main Division under Nozu himself. The plan of attack was for the Combined Brigade to make the frontal assault from the south, while the Main Division attacked from the southwest. Flanking actions would then be carried out by the two columns. If the Chinese tried to retreat, the Wonson column was given the duty of intercepting and harrying the enemy as it fled to the northeast.\nThe battle\nArrival of Japanese troops\nThe Main Division attacked from the southwest early during the morning of 15 September 1894. Following a twelve-hour battle, the Chinese repulsed this force. Heavy rain turned the battlefield into a field of mud covered with the wounded, supply carts, and horses. Meanwhile, the Combined Brigade attacked the forts protecting the southern bank of the Taedong River. However, Japanese artillery was too far back to be effective and by nightfall the Japanese evacuated the few earthworks they had captured. The apparent inability of these two divisions to take Pyongyang led to initial newspaper reports that China had won the battle, which later turned out to be false.\nIn reality, the Wonsan and Sangnyong columns took the Chinese fortress at Moktan-tei, which was north of Pyongyang. From that position, Japanese artillery could fire across the city walls – this position forced the Chinese to surrender at 16:30 on 15 September. The Chinese commander promised that his troops would remain within the city gates, but since it was already getting dark, the Japanese declined to enter the city until the following day. During the evening of 15 September, many Chinese troops tried to flee for the coast and the border town of Wiju (modern village of Uiju, North Korea) on the lower reaches of the Yalu River). Japanese snipers killed large numbers of Chinese on the northern roads. As a result of the Chinese surrender, early the following morning the two Japanese columns entered the northern gate of the city unopposed. There was no way to communicate their success to the rest of the Japanese Army, however, so when the Main Division began its attack on the city's West Gate the next day, they were surprised to find the gate undefended. Later that morning, the Combined Brigade entered the city through the South Gate. Throughout the battle of Pyongyang, the Chinese troops were unable to counter the Japanese troops.\nAftermath\nAfter the Battle of Pyongyang, command of Japanese First Army was turned over from Marshal Yamagata to General Nozu for reasons of health. Nozu's former command of the 5th division was assumed by Lieutenant General Oku Yasukata. The Japanese advanced north to the Yalu River without opposition. The Chinese had decided (as would the Russians ten years later in the Russo-Japanese War) to abandon northern Korea and defend from the northern bank of the Yalu River.\nThe Huai Army of Viceroy Li Hongzhang, representing China's best troops, took heavy losses and were nearly destroyed, which also damaged the viceroy's personal power base.\nQing Muslim General Zuo Baogui (1837–1894), from Shandong province, died in action in Pyongyang, from Japanese artillery. A memorial to him was constructed. Before the battle Zuo Baogui performed ablution (Wudu or Ghusl) according to Islamic custom.\nSee also\n* Harada Jūkichi\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n* Chamberlin, William Henry.
