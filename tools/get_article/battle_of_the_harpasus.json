The battle on the Harpasus was the last battle of the war between King Attalus I of Pergamon and the Seleucid prince Antiochus Hierax over dominion of western Anatolia. Attalus won a decisive victory and Hierax started a failed campaign in Mesopotamia that would lead to his defeat and later death at Egypt.\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
