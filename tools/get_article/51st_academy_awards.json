During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Jack Haley Jr. and directed by Marty Pasetta. Comedian and talk show host Johnny Carson hosted the show for the first time. Three days earlier, in a ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by hosts Gregory Peck and Christopher Reeve.\nThe Deer Hunter won five awards at the main awards ceremony, including Best Picture. Other winners included Coming Home with three awards, Midnight Express with two, and The Buddy Holly Story, California Suite, Days of Heaven, Death on the Nile, The Flight of the Gossamer Condor, Get Out Your Handkerchiefs, Heaven Can Wait, Scared Straight!, Special Delivery, Superman, Teenage Father, and ''Thank God It's Friday'' with one. The telecast was watched by 46.3&nbsp;million viewers and earned a 34.6 Nielsen rating in the United States.\nCeremony\nThe ceremony, held at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Downtown Los Angeles, was hosted by late-night talk host Johnny Carson for the first time. Jack Elliott and Allyn Ferguson served as musical directors for the telecast. Singers Sammy Davis Jr. and Steve Lawrence performed a medley called \"Oscar's Only Human,\" which was composed of movie songs that were not nominated for Best Original Song. Initially, the academy's music branch protested the segment and urged that it be dropped from the ceremony, but it was kept after Haley threatened to leave his position as producer and pull Carson from emcee duties.\nIt is also remembered for being the final public appearance of Oscar-winning actor John Wayne, where he was given a standing ovation before presenting the award for Best Picture. On June 11, two months after the ceremony, he died from complications from stomach cancer at age 72.  This was also the final public appearance for Jack Haley, the father of producer Jack Haley Jr., who presented the Best Costume Design with his Wizard of Oz co-star Ray Bolger.\nJane Fonda, who won the award for Best Actress for her role in the film Coming Home, gave part of her speech in American Sign Language, saying that making the film had made her more aware of the needs of the disabled, including the deaf. The Academy Awards broadcast would begin providing closed captions for deaf viewers in 1982.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominees for the 51st Academy Awards were announced on February 20, 1979, by Academy president Howard W. Koch and actress Susan Blakely. The Deer Hunter and Heaven Can Wait tied for the most nominations with nine each. The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on April 9. Best Director nominees Warren Beatty and Buck Henry became the second pair of directors nominated in that category for the same film; Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise had won for co-directing 1961's West Side Story. Furthermore, Beatty was the first person to earn acting, directing, producing, and screenwriting nominations for the same film. While Orson Welles had previously achieved the same feat for Citizen Kane, rules at the time determined that the studio releasing the film, as opposed to the individual producers, were the official nominees for Best Picture. With Jon Voight and Jane Fonda's respective wins in the Best Actor and Best Actress categories, Coming Home was the fourth film to win both lead acting awards. Best Supporting Actress winner Maggie Smith became the only person to win an Oscar for playing an Oscar loser in California Suite.\nAwards\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{| class=wikitable\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'The Deer Hunter&nbsp;– Barry Spikings, Michael Deeley, Michael Cimino and John Peverall, producers'\n**Coming Home&nbsp;- Jerome Hellman, producer\n**Heaven Can Wait&nbsp;– Warren Beatty, producer\n**Midnight Express&nbsp;– Alan Marshall and David Puttnam, producers\n**An Unmarried Woman&nbsp;- Paul Mazursky and Anthony Ray, producers\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Michael Cimino&nbsp;– The Deer Hunter'\n**Hal Ashby&nbsp;– Coming Home\n**Warren Beatty and Buck Henry&nbsp;– Heaven Can Wait\n**Woody Allen&nbsp;– Interiors\n**Alan Parker&nbsp;– Midnight Express\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Jon Voight&nbsp;– Coming Home as Luke Martin'\n**Warren Beatty&nbsp;– Heaven Can Wait as Joe Pendleton/Leo Farnsworth/Tom Jarrett\n**Gary Busey&nbsp;– The Buddy Holly Story as Buddy Holly\n**Robert De Niro&nbsp;– The Deer Hunter as Sergeant Michael \"Mike\" Vronsky\n**Laurence Olivier&nbsp;– The Boys from Brazil as Ezra Lieberman\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Jane Fonda&nbsp;– Coming Home as Sally Hyde'\n**Ingrid Bergman&nbsp;– Autumn Sonata as Charlotte Andergast\n**Ellen Burstyn&nbsp;– Same Time, Next Year as Doris\n**Jill Clayburgh&nbsp;– An Unmarried Woman as Erica Benton\n**Geraldine Page&nbsp;– Interiors as Eve\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Christopher Walken&nbsp;– The Deer Hunter as Corporal Nikanor \"Nick\" Chevotarevich'\n**Bruce Dern&nbsp;– Coming Home as Captain Bob Hyde\n**Richard Farnsworth&nbsp;– Comes a Horseman as Dodger\n**John Hurt&nbsp;– Midnight Express as Max\n**Jack Warden&nbsp;– Heaven Can Wait as Max Corkle\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Maggie Smith&nbsp;– California Suite as Diana Barrie'\n**Dyan Cannon&nbsp;– Heaven Can Wait as Julia Farnsworth\n**Penelope Milford&nbsp;– Coming Home as Vi Munson\n**Maureen Stapleton&nbsp;– Interiors as Pearl\n**Meryl Streep&nbsp;– The Deer Hunter as Linda\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Coming Home&nbsp;– Story by Nancy Dowd; Screenplay by Waldo Salt and Robert C.
