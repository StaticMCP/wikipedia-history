It is listed by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee as a Geological Conservation Review site.\nThis site has undated sands of Lower Cretaceous Wealden deposits. The sand is of northern origin, probably recycled through the Portland Beds, and includes Carboniferous chert. The site is important for its bearing on the palaeogeography of the Wealden and the preceding Purbeck deposits.\nThe pit has been filled in, and it is on private land with no public access.\nReferences"
