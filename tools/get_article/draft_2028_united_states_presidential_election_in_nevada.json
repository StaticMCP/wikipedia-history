Nevada voters will choose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The state of Nevada has six electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the state neither gained nor lost a seat. Nevada was considered to be a crucial swing state in 2024, and it voted Republican for the first time since George W. Bush's narrow victory twenty years earlier (although, except in 2008, the wins were always narrow for Democrats).\nReferences"
