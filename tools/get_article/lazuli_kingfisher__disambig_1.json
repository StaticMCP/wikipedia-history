It can be found on the islands of Seram, Ambon and Haruku.  Found singly and in pairs in lowland wooded areas, including cultivated areas and mangroves. Pale blue underside is unique among kingfishers in its limited south Moluccan range. Rowdy vocalizations include repetitive \"ker-chick\" series and \"ki-ki-ki-ki…\" calls.
