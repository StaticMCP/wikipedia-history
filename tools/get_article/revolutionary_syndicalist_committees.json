The group was founded in opposition to reformist French CGT leadership in the circle around Pierre Monatte and the Vie ouvrére newspaper. They created a coordinating entity after the September 1919 CGT congress and worked to develop inroads with specific member unions, with railroad workers in particular.\nMonatte established a CSR Central Committee at a September 1921 opposition congress in Lyon. Revolutionary syndicalists formally separated from the CGT in December. They created a \"Unitarian CGT\" (CGTU) at the July 1922 Saint-Etienne congress.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.syndicaliste.com/ Syndicaliste review]"
