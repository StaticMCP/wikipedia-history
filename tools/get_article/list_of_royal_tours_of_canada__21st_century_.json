Originally, royal tours of Canada were events predominantly for Canadians to see and possibly meet members of their royal family, with the associated patriotic pomp and spectacle. However, nearing the end of the 20th century, such occasions took on the added dimension of a theme; for instance, the 2005 tour of Saskatchewan and Alberta by Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was deemed to be a vehicle for the Queen and all other Canadians to honour \"The Spirit of Nation Builders\". Also, junior members of the Royal Family began to undertake unofficial \"working\" tours of Canada as well; in this method, royal figures are invited by provinces, municipalities, and other organizations to events which the latter fund without assistance from the federal government. King Charles&nbsp;III; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, have all made several small tours in this fashion.\nCanadian royal family\nFile:Princesa Ana do Reino Unido.jpg|The Princess Royal visited King George School, Saskatoon, in 2004\nFile:Prince of Wales Toronto Carlu.JPG|The Prince of Wales (now Charles&nbsp;III), in Toronto, 4 November 2009\nFile:Royal Visit Toronto 2010 6.JPG|Elizabeth II during a walkabout in Queen's Park, Toronto, July 2010\nFile:Kate and William, Canada Day, 2011, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.jpg|The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Parliament Hill on Canada Day, July 2011\nFile:The King of Canada delivers the Speech from the Throne.jpg|King Charles III delivering the 2025 Speech from the Throne\n2000–2009\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background:white; border: 1px #CC0000 solid; border-collapse: collapse; width:100%\"\n|-  bgcolor=\"white\"\n!
