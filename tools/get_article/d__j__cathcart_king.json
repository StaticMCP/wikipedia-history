He was the first student to complete a Master of Laws at the University of Bristol.\nCareer\nDuring the Second World War, King served in the Royal Artillery in the Middle East. His time there encouraged his interest in military architecture, and he went on to write papers about Krak des Chevaliers and the Citadel of Damascus in Syria.\nAfter the war, King worked at Walton Lodge Preparatory School in Bristol as a history teacher. He was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1962.\nHe was a founding member of the Castle Studies Group, which was established in 1987.\nSelected publications\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://collections.sal.org.uk/kin Archival record from the Society of Antiquaries of London]\n* [https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c088c46c-3e45-3bfa-85e3-294f6bc5e36c University of Bristol Special Collections Archival record from the University of Bristol Special Collections]"
