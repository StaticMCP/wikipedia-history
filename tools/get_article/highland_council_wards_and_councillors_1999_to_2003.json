Each ward elects one councillor by the first past the post system of election. Elections are held on a four-year cycle: therefore the next general election was in 2003.\nIn 1999 the council had been functioning since 1996, but prior to the 1999 election it had consisted of councillors elected to the earlier regional council which covered the same Highland area.\nWards are grouped into areas. Councillors elected from a particular area become members of the relevant area committee. The committee areas are similar to the districts which were abolished in 1996, when the Highland region became a unitary council area.\nBadenoch and Strathspey wards\nThere are five wards in the Badenoch and Strathspey area:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
