Its primary use is for baseball and civic events, but it also sees usage as a training ground for a variety of other New Westminster sports clubs.\nThe stadium grounds are used for two of the main events of the annual Hyack Festival in New Westminster, the May Day dances, and the Anvil Battery Salute.\nIn 2014, the Vancouver Whitecaps FC soccer club attempted to reach an agreement with the City of New Westminster to rebuild/renovate Queen's Park stadium to be a suitable venue for their second team in the USL Pro league. The proposal was eventually rejected due to the city's unwillingness to make an eleven million dollar investment for the new facilities, alongside public opposition from residents of the Queen's Park neighbourhood, and the larger baseball community as a whole.\nReferences"
