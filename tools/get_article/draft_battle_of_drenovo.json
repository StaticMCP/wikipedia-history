In writing, he informed the competent Serbian voivodes Jovan Babunski and Vasilije Trbić of the decision made at the meeting of the Skopje Committee, which was also attended by the Consul General Živojin Balugdžić. In the decision, he demanded that the Serbian Trans-Vardar troops break out onto the Vardar as soon as possible, establish a connection with Rudnik, and thus the eastern Povardarje region.\nThe most favorable route for carrying out this task led towards a mixed Serbian-Bulgarian village of Drenovo, which was surrounded by the Arnauti villages of Dejkovec, Gorlje Jabolčište, and Donje Jabolčište, and the Turkish village of Gornje Vranovce. In such a sheltered Drenovo, the Bulgarian vojvodes Dačo from Bistrica and Stevan Dimitrov (1876-1905) from Gradsko took refuge, both with eight komitas in Drenovo. They intended to welcome the village celebration of Spasovdan in Drenovo and avoid revenge from the Serbian troops for previously committed crimes. Stevan Dimitrov-Vardarac became particularly notorious, as he robbed and beat Serbs from Azot like a highwayman. In addition, his troop killed two Serbs, one on the road to Bogomila, and the other in the Kapinovo mill. They also tried to kill the Serbian priest Ignjat Popović on the road to Teovo.\nFor the attack on Drenovo, in addition to his Trbić company, Babunski also engaged village Chetniks from Bogomil and Teovo, totaling 40 men. To pass through the Albanian villages without hindrance, the Chetniks changed into Albanian clothing, which they received from Kičevo. They also decided to attack Drenovo during the day, since the Bulgarians did not post guards at that time. In the afternoon of June 9, they entered the village. The people of Drenovo, thinking that they were facing Albanians, did not take out their weapons. When the Serbian companies found out in which house the Komitadji were hiding, they surrounded the house and attacked it from the surrounding houses. A shootout ensued. Some Chetniks managed to climb onto the roof and set the house on fire. The Bulgarians moved to another house under the protection of pall and smoke, and the fight continued. As the second house was also on fire and the flaming ceiling beams began to fall on them, the Komitas decided to break through forcefully after a four-hour battle. In that attempt, everyone was killed, except for two who were captured, tried, and later killed as accomplices in the murders at the Kapinovo mill and on the Bogomil road.\nThe Serbs had only one wounded in this battle - Trbić's Chetnik Donče from Oraov-Dol. The Chetnik anthem originated from this battle \"[https://sr.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%88%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD_%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8_(%D0%A1%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%27%D1%82%D0%B5_%D1%81%D0%B5,_%D1%81%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%27%D1%82%D0%B5,_%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8) Get Ready, Get Ready]\", which was also sung with slightly altered lyrics in World War II.\nFile:Živojin Balugdžić.jpg|Serbian Consul General in Skopje Živojin Balugdžić\nFile:Vojvoda Babunski.jpg|Serbian Chetnik Jovan Babunski\nFile:Vasilije Trbić.jpg|Serbian Chetnik Vasilije Trbić\nReferences\n* Translated from Serbian Wikipedia: https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%94%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0"
