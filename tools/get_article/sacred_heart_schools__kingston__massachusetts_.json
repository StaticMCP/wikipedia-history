The school is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston.  The school is operated by the Sisters of Divine Providence and educated students in grades 7-12 since its establishment in 1947. It more recently developed into grades PreK-12, and is now made up of three schools, an elementary school, a pre-primary (kindergarten) school, and an intermediate school. Masses are held monthly and on special occasions in either the auditorium or in the chapel.\nThe three schools, a summer camp, and the Provincial Residence are also located on the extensive campus.\nIn the 2018-2019 school year the Catholic order spent $2.2 million to keep the high school open, but after that time no longer had the money to do so. In 2020 the school system announced that its high school division would close.\nNotes and references\nExternal links\n*[http://www.sacredheartkingston.com Official High School Site]\n*[http://www.sacredheart.mec.edu/ Official Elementary School Site]\n*[http://community.livejournal.com/sacredhearthigh Livejournal Community]"
