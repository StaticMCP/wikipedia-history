References to the ruler appear in archaeological survey reports and district gazetteers describing Sorar as the place of a Kalal chieftain who held authority under the Kalachuri rulers of Ratanpur. Archaeological and textual evidence places the site within the later medieval Kalachuri period.\n---\nHistorical background\nSorar lay along a route connecting Balod and Dhamtari. Gazetteers record that parts of the Balod region were governed by small chiefdoms subordinate to the Ratanpur Kalachuris. The Durg Gazetteer states:\n> \"At Sorar a Kalal Raja is said to have ruled. They all owed allegiance to the Ratanpur House.\"\nThis indicates that Sorar functioned as a minor principality governed by a local Kalal chief.\n---\nArchaeological remains\nThe earliest detailed description of Sorar's ruins was published by J.D. Beglar (1873–74) and Alexander Cunningham in ASI Reports, Vol. VII.\nCunningham records that:\n> \"Between Sorar and Dholbapuri, are the remains of a temple known as the house of the Kalāl Rājā. All now left are two whole and four dwarf pillars with the portions of roof supported by them... From Navapara to Majhgaon runs a long stretch of broken blocks of stone... presenting the exact appearance of the ruins of a great fort two miles long; at intervals stand upright stones looking like sati pillars; the whole presents an appearance of great desolation.\"\nInscription\nCunningham also notes the presence of an inscription near the ruined structure:\n> \"Near the ruined temple, cut on a well-smoothed thick slab, is a worn and mutilated sati inscription.\"\nThis inscription is one of the few epigraphic pieces associated with the site, though its text is largely unreadable.\n---\nAdditional archaeological evidence\nFurther information appears in the proceedings of the XI Annual Congress of the Indian Archaeological Society (1980), which restate and expand the earlier ASI descriptions:\n> \"There are ruins of foundations which are said to be the temple of the kalāl king... a long stretch of broken blocks of stones... the ruins of a great fort two miles long... upright stones looking like sati pillars.\"\nTogether, these reports indicate that Sorar was a fortified medieval settlement with extensive stone architecture.\n---\nAcademic interpretation\nModern studies classify Sorar as a Kalachuri-era archaeological site with evidence of temple-building activity in granite and other regional traditions. The repeated references to a Kalal ruler in ASI reports, gazetteers, and archaeological congress records suggest the existence of a recognized local chieftaincy in the area during the medieval period.\n---\nReferences"
