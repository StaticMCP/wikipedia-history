Most of the information about its existence comes from the Chach Nama, a historical account of the Chach-Brahmin dynasty.\nThe members of the dynasty continued to administer parts of Sindh under the Umayyad Caliphate's Caliphal province of Sind after it fell in 712. These rulers include Hullishāh and Shishah.\nHistory\nThe dynasty was founded by a Brahmin named Chach of Aror after he married the widow of Rai Sahasi II and usurped the Buddhist Rai dynasty. His claim was further secured by the killing of Rai Sahasi II's brother.\nThe casus belli for the Ummayad invasion was Sindhi pirates seizing tribute sent from the king of Serendib to the Ummayad Caliph. For the campaign Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan granted a large army to the governor Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, but no attempt was made to annex Sindh due to the caliph's death. Under his son and successor Al-Walid I, the general Muhammad bin Qasim led Islamic invasion of Sindh in 712.\nDuring the conflict local Buddhist clans who maintained loyalty to the previous Rai dynasty such as the Jats, allied themselves with the Ummayads against Dahir.  The last Hindu king of Sindh Raja Dahir was killed during the battle of Aror and Sindh was annexed into the Ummayad Caliphate. However, significant medieval Muslim chronicles such as the Chach Nama, Zainul-Akhbar and Tarikh-I-Baihaqi refute this as those have recorded battles between Jats and forces of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim. At battle of Aror (Rohri) Muhammad ibn al-Qasim was met by Dahir's forces and the eastern Jats in battle.\nRulers\nThe known rulers of the Brahmin dynasty are:\n* Chach (}})\n* Chandar (}})\n* Dāhir (}} from Alor)\n** Jaisimba (Jaisiah) - the son of Dahir: After the death of Umayyad governor Hajjaj (r. 692-714) in 714 CE, Jaisimba reconquered the Brahmanabad during the reign of Umayyad caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 715-717).
