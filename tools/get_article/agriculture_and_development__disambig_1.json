Like other Israeli Arab parties at the time, it was associated with David Ben-Gurion's Mapai party, as Ben-Gurion was keen to include Israeli Arabs in the functioning of the state in order to prove Jews and Arabs could co-exist peacefully and productively. It drew its support from Arabs living in the central area of Israel.\nIn the elections, the party won only one seat, taken by its leader, Faras Hamdan. Because of its association with Mapai, the party joined the governing coalition in all four governments of the second Knesset.\nIn the 1955 elections the party won one seat, retained by Hamdan, and was again part of the coalition.\nIn the 1959 elections the party again won one seat, and joined the coalition, with Mahmud Al-Nashaf replacing Hamdan as leader. However, the party did not run in the 1961 elections.\nList of Knesset members\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:left\n|-\n!Name\n!Years in office\n!Government roles\n!Other roles\n|-\n|Mahmud Al-Nashaf||1959–1961|| ||Party leader 1959–1961\n|-\n|Faras Hamdan||1951–1959|| ||Party leader 1951–1959\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionPage_eng.asp?PG=83 Party history] Knesset website"
