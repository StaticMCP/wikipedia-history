Founded in 2003 and currently based in Baltimore, the group features a rotating cast of musicians. Viking Moses has worked with the Alan McGee's Poptones record label as well as Portland-based Marriage Records.\nHistory\nBrendon Massei began touring regularly around 1993, first under his own name, then under the moniker Supperbell Roundup, before finally settling on Viking Moses in 2003. In the style of rock/soul, Viking Moses became known in 2004, thanks to Devendra Banhart's Golden Apples of the Sun compilation and good words, followed by a signing by Alan McGee (Creation Records founder, manager of Oasis and Mogwai).\nViking Moses has toured with Scout Niblett, Phosphorescent, Little Wings, and The Shivers. Massei is also known for bringing musicians including Deer Tick's John McCauley, Mike Sherk of Mandarin Dynasty, Nat Baldwin of the Dirty Projectors and Jana Hunter on their first tours.\nMassei was close with Jason Molina of Songs: Ohia and Magnolia Electric Co. fame; following Molina's death, Massei wrote about their friendship in an article for Common Folk Music, and contributed to a covers album benefitting the late singer's family, titled The Static and the Distance.\nIn film\nMassei's tour warrior antics have drawn him attention, including a 2011 feature-length documentary by Pulse Films titled Werewolves Across America about his life and lifestyle as a touring musician.\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
