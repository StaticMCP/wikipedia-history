Terrain hex maps are 3D or 2D with various scales and sizes.\nThe basic platform for the Battleground series involves individual infantry and cavalry regiments, artillery batteries, and commanders. All are rated for strength, firepower, weaponry, morale, and movement. As a unit takes fire, it may become fatigued, disordered, or routed to the rear. Players compete against the computer's artificial intelligence or against another player via modem. Players may try a variety of 25 individual scenarios, or refight the entire Battle of Shiloh. A Fog of War option enhances playing against the computer, as it hides units that are not in direct view of the enemy.  The game also includes scenarios related to the Battle of Wilson's Creek and the Battle of Prairie Grove.\nThe game features video clips of battle reenactments, as well as Civil War music by folk singer Bobby Horton.\nReception\n| rev2 =CNET Gamecenter\n| rev2Score =\n| rev5 = PC Games\n| rev5Score= B−\n}}\nShiloh won Computer Gaming Worlds 1996 \"Wargame of the Year\" award. The editors wrote, \"Sure, there's micromanaging. And yes, there's complexity, too. But the learning curve is justified, because this is simply the best 19th-century system ever designed for a wargame—realistic, challenging, and eminently replayable.\" The three Battleground games of 1996—Shiloh, Antietam and Waterloo—collectively won Computer Games Strategy Pluss wargame of the year award.\nThe Computer Game Developers Conference nominated Shiloh for its 1996 \"Best Music or Soundtrack\" Spotlight Award, which ultimately went to Quake.\nThe game received a score of 85% from boot.\nReviews\n*Australian Realms #30\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gamesfirst.com/reviews/rick/Getty/Getty.htm Games First review]"
