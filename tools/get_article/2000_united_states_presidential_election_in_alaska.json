Al Gore received 28% of the vote.\nThis is the most recent election in which Sitka, Skagway, and Juneau voted for the Republican candidate.

Alaska is allocated 3 electors because it has 1 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 3 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 3 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.\nThe electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 18, 2000, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.\nThe following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All were pledged to and voted for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney:\n#Bill Allen\n#Susan Fischetti\n#Lucy Groh\nSee also\n*United States presidential elections in Alaska\nReferences"
