It begins along the western slope of Plattekill Mountain, northeast of the Hamlet of Bovina and flows generally westward before converging with the West Branch Delaware River by the Village of Delhi.\nFishing\nIn the Little Delaware River the wild brown trout and brook trout populations are supplemented with the stocking of about 700 brown trout yearlings each year. The fish are stocked in a  zone at the mouth and a  zone downstream of the hamlet of Bovina Center. Brown trout are the dominant wild trout in the stream, but there are also large amounts of brook trout upstream of Bovina Center.\nWatershed\nThe Little Delaware River's watershed makes up for 7.84% of the West Branch Delaware River's drainage area.\nHydrology\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains one stream gauge along the Little Delaware River.\nThe station by the Village of Delhi has been in operation since October 1937, but only making maximum measurements since December 1996. It is located on the left bank  downstream from the bridge on Thomson Cross Road and  upstream from the mouth. This station had a maximum discharge of about  and a gauge height of  from floodmark on January 19, 1996, and a minimum discharge of  on August 10–12, 1964 and September 24–25,1964.\nReferences"
