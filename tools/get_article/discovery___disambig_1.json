Moses. The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars and states \"Lloyd's Coltrane-inspired sound was already in place, and his flute playing was becoming distinctive. The music is essentially melodic but advanced hard bop, a strong start to an important career\". The piece \"Ol' Five Spot\" is a homage to the legendary New York jazz club of the same name.\nThe album was also released with the title Bizarre in the UK, at the time.\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Charles Lloyd except as indicated.\n# \"Forest Flower\" - 7:54\n# \"How Can I Tell You\" - 5:16\n# \"Little Peace\" - 6:32\n# \"Bizarre\" - 4:20\n# \"Days of Wine and Roses\" (Henry Mancini, Johnny Mercer) - 5:53\n# \"Sweet Georgia Bright\" - 5:45\n# \"Love Song to a Baby\" - 5:56\n# \"Ol' Five Spot\" - 6:34\nPersonnel\nTracks 1, 4–5, 8\n*Charles Lloyd - tenor saxophone, flute\n*Don Friedman - piano\n*Eddie Khan - bass\n*Roy Haynes - drums\nTracks 2–3, 6–7\n*Charles Lloyd - tenor saxophone, flute\n*Don Friedman - piano\n*Richard Davis - bass\n*J.
