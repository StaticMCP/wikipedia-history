The North Coast railway line forms the western boundary, with the Stuart railway station serving the suburb. The Bruce Highway passes from the south-east to the north-west through the suburb. The Flinders Highway passes from the south-west to its junction with the Bruce Highway.

It is thought that Stewart was just a temporary misspelling of Stuart and that the intention was to name the area after the first district surveyor appointed in 1865, Clarendon Stuart (1833-1912).\nStewart's Creek Provisional School opened on 18 May 1891, becoming Stewart's Creek State School in 1901. In 1939, it was renamed Stuart State School. It was closed on 31 December 2013, having been assessed as unviable with an enrolment of 80+ students. It was at 10 Dwyer Street (). Its website was partially archived. In May 2025, the school site was offered for sale.\nIn December 1942, two classrooms of the Stuart State School on the outskirts of Townsville were used by the Army as the main Army Signals Communication Centre in North Queensland. The unit later moved to a concrete bunker at Roseneath.\nDemographics\nIn the , Stuart had a population of 1,051 people.\nIn the , Stuart had a population of 1,386 people.\nIn the , Stuart had a population of 1,576 people.\nHeritage listings\nStuart has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Stewart's Creek Gaol (the historic buildings within the present Townsville Correction Centre), Centenary Drive, off Dwyer Street\n* former Operations and Signals Bunker, Off Stuart Drive (now in Wulguru)\n* St Brigid's Church, 523 Stuart Drive\nFacilities\nInfrastructure in Stuart includes:\n* Townsville Correctional Centre\n* Stuart landfill and waste transfer station\nIndustries in Stuart include:\n* Mount Stuart Power Station\n* Sun Metals Zinc Refinery\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Stuart.
