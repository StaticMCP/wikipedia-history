      "text": "# List of Warhammer Fantasy novels\n\nAfter the creation of the Warhammer Fantasy universe by Games Workshop, novels were published by GW Books and Boxtree Limited, but subsequently novels have been published by the Black Library, including translations to French and German. More than 150 novels have been set in the shared universe of Warhammer Fantasy since 1989.\nAccording to Marc Gascoigne the idea of Chaos in Warhammer was inspired by The Eternal Champion and its sequels, written by Michael Moorcock, who made use of ideas from Three Hearts and Three Lions by Poul Anderson. The Warhammer elves were inspired by The Broken Sword by Poul Anderson as well the Middle-earth canon of J. R. R. Tolkien.\nGotrek and Felix\nThe Gotrek & Felix series consists of 19 novels. The first seven (including an anthology) were written by William King and the next five by Nathan Long. A novel-length anthology was also released with contributions from various authors including Long (The Anthology). Following these thirteen books, six more were released in a divergent continuity in line with the End Times event: two by Joshua Reynolds, three by David Guymer, and one more novel-length anthology (Lost Tales) including stories by both Guymer and Reynolds as well as others. There are also various short stories and novellas which were never collected in any of the anthologies, but were mostly collected in the various omnibus releases.\nGotrek & Felix: The First Omnibus\nThese novels were collected in omnibus in 2003 and 2006 and with additional short stories in 2013 and 2018 ().\n*Trollslayer by William King (1999, anthology, incorporates Geheimnisnacht originally published 1989 in Warhammer: Ignorant Armies, Wolf Riders originally published 1989 in Warhammer: Wolf Riders, The Dark Beneath the World originally published 1990 in Warhammer: Red Thirst, The Mutant Master originally published 1997 in Inferno! issue 1, and ''Ulric's Children originally published 1999 in Inferno! issue 11, reissue 2019, )\n*Skavenslayer by William King (1999, incorporates Skaven's Claw originally published 1992 in White Dwarf issues 152 and 153)\n*Daemonslayer by William King (1999)\n*A Place of Quiet Assembly by John Brunner (short story, originally published 2010 in Hammer and Bolter issue 1)\n*Blood Sport by Josh Reynolds (short story, originally published 2012 in the 15th Birthday Collection)\n*Kineater by Jordan Ellinger (short story, originally published 2012 in Gotrek and Felix: The Anthology)\n*Mind-Stealer by C.
