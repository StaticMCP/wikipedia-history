Pro-Crimean princes capitulated, while Kashkatau party leaders fortified Cherek Fortress.\nBy January 1721, Aslanbech Qeytuqo’s forces defeated the Crimean Tatars and their Baksan allies at the Nalchik River. Russia sent Artemy Volynsky to mediate, temporarily restoring peace.\nFrom 1722 to 1724, conflicts continued. Aslanbech Qeytuqo allied with Mengli II Giray, new Khan, against the Baksan faction, but local Kabardian resistance remained strong.\nBy 1725–1726, Baksan party leaders  and the Hatokhshoqo princes capitulated to Bakhte-Giray and Aslanbech Qeytuqo. Kabardia achieved a Kabardian victory over the Crimean Khanate and pro-Crimean Kabardians, Baksan party.\nReferences"
