He is an Arrernte man.\nHe started playing guitar at the age of six with his father, and later went to school at a Lutheran college in Adelaide: Immanuel College in Novar Gardens.\nMusic career\nWilliams was included on a compilation CD released in 1999 to promote reconciliation in Australia. The album was titled Reconciliation: Stories of the Heart, Sounds of the Rock and included music, personal statements from celebrities, and excerpts from historical speeches and events.\nIn 2007, he wrote the musical Magic Coolamon, which debuted as the first ever Central Australian Indigenous musical.\nWilliams toured with John Williamson many times, including \"Hillbilly Road\" in 2008.\nIn 2015, Williams invited long-time friend and award-winning Australian singer Shane Nicholson to visit his hometown of Hermannsburg (Ntaria) to help break his writer's block. Williams took him to sacred sites and shared Aboriginal Dreaming stories which inspired Nicholson's ARIA-nominated album Hell Breaks Loose, which features the track 'Hermannsburg'.\nIn 2016, Williams teamed up with emerging artist Dani Young, writing and recording an album of traditional country duets in Nashville. The album, Desert Water was produced by Billy Yates, and features Jim Lauderdale. The album was released on 22 July 2016. The album debuted at #2 on the ARIA Country albums charts, and the first single \"Two Ships\" spent six weeks at #1 on Tamworth Country Radio.\nRadio and television career\nIn 1996, Williams was the first remote Indigenous broadcaster (RIBS) on the 8KIN FM network, presenting music shows live from Hermannsburg. He is the longest-serving broadcaster on CAAMA Radio,  presenting the mid-morning show from 9am - 11am on weekdays, as well as the 80s Mix on Monday evenings, Rockn on Wednesday evenings, and CAAMA's highest rating program Strictly Country on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. His programs are also played through the National Indigenous Radio Service.\nIn 2015, Williams made his directorial debut, writing and co-directing for the Aboriginal television series Our Place for ICTV.\nPolitics\nWilliams stood as lead Australian Greens candidate for the two Northern Territory seats in the Australian Senate in the 2010 federal election, and again in the 2013 federal election.\nAt the 2012 Northern Territory election, he stood for the Australia's First Nations Political Party in the seat of Namatjira. On the day before the election, he commented that the Country Liberals had gone too far in using vicious personal attacks at the polling places, which they shouted in Aboriginal language to avoid being removed by poll officials. Williams claimed that the attacks were part of a systematic campaign.\nDiscography\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Western Wind\n|\n* Released: 1995\n* Label: CAAMA Music\n* Format: CD\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Country Friends & Me\n|\n* Released: 1998\n* Label: CAAMA Music\n* Format: CD\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Where My Heart Is\n|\n* Released: 2001\n* Label: CAAMA Music\n* Format: CD\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Places in Between\n|\n* Released: 2002\n* Label: CAAMA Music\n* Format: CD\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Be Like Home\n|\n* Released: 2005\n* Label: CAAMA Music\n* Format: CD\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Looking Out\n|\n* Released: 2009\n* Label: Heartland\n* Format: CD\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Urna Mara\n|\n* Released: 2011\n* Label: ABC\n* Format: CD\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Winanjjara\n|\n* Released: 2011\n* Label: Heartland\n* Format: CD\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Desert Water\n|\n* Released: June 2016\n* Label: UMA\n* Format: CD\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| These are the Changes\n|\n* Released: January 2020\n* Label: ABC\n* Format: CD, DD\n|-\n|}\nRecognition and awards\nIn 2004, Williams was the subject of an episode of the television series Nganampa Anwernekenhe.\nIn 2009 he was inducted into the Australian Country Music Hall of Fame.
