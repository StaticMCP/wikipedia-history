Modern historians date the event to October 625, though several alternative dates are found in primary sources.\nA year after the Battle of Uhud, it was time for Muslims to meet the polytheists and start war again in order to determine which of the two parties was worthy of survival, according to Muslim scholar Safiur Rahman al Mubarakpuri.\nThe invasion helped the Muslims regain their military reputation, their dignity and managed to impose their presence over the whole of Arabia after the stalemate at the Battle of Uhud. Quran 3:173-176 was reportedly divinely revealed to Muhammad during this event. The event and information about the verses is mentioned in the Sahih Bukhari hadith collection.\nBackground\nAccording to William Muir, the two opposing forces were to meet again at Badr, and that year there was a great drought, Abu Sufyan the leader of the Meccan forces did not want to fight that season, and wished to defer the fighting to another, more-plentiful season. So Abu Sufyan told a man named Nuam from a neutral tribe to give an exaggerated account of the Meccan forces to deter Muhammad. The exaggerated report of Nuam scared some of the Muslims, and there was a disinclination to fight. Muhammad rejected this cowardly spirit and declared an oath that he would go to Badr, even if he went alone. Those bold words inspired such confidence that he was able to collect a force double what he had ever had before.\nInvasion\nAccording to the Sealed Nectar, Muhammad set out to Badr accompanied by 1500 fighters and 10 mounted horsemen, and with ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib as standard bearer. ‘Abdullah bin Rawahah was given authority over Madinah during Muhammad's absence. Reaching Badr, the Muslims stayed there waiting for the idolaters to come.\nAbu Sufyan’s forces comprised 2000 footmen and 50 horsemen. They reached Mar Az-Zahran, some distance from Makkah, and camped at a water place called Mijannah. Being reluctant, discouraged and extremely terrified of the consequences of the approaching fight, Abu Sufyan turned to his people and began to introduce cowardice-based, flimsy pretexts in order to dissuade his men from going to war, saying:\nHis army were also possessed of the same fears and apprehensions, for they readily obeyed him without the least hesitation.\nThe Muslims, who were then at Badr, stayed for eight days waiting for their enemy. They took advantage of their stay by selling goods and earning double as much the price out of it. When the idolaters declined to fight, the balance of powers shifted to rest in favour of the Muslims, who thus regained their military reputation, their dignity and managed to impose their presence over the whole of Arabia.\nNames of invasion\nThis invasion had many names. It has been called ‘Badr the Appointment’, ‘Badr, the Second’, ‘Badr, the Latter’ or ‘Badr Minor’.\nIslamic primary sources\nQuran 3:173-176\nQuran 3:173-176 was reportedly divinely revealed to Muhammad during this event. It states:\nAnd they returned with Grace and bounty from Allah: no harm ever touched them: For they followed the good pleasure of Allah: And Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded\nIt is only the Evil One that suggests to you the fear of his votaries: Be ye not afraid of them, but fear Me, if ye have Faith\nLet not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief: Not the least harm will they do to Allah: Allah's plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter, but a severe punishment.\n}}\nThe commentary of Ibn Abbas on verse 3:173 is as follows:\nBiographical literature\nThis event is mentioned in Ibn Hisham's biography of Muhammad. The Muslim jurist Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya also mentions the event in his biography of Muhammad, Zad al-Ma'ad. Among the modern secondary sources which mention this, include the award winning book, The Sealed Nectar.\nHadith literature\nMuhammad al-Bukhari mentioned in his hadith collection Sahih Bukhari:\n}}\nSee also\n*List of battles of Muhammad\n*Military career of Muhammad\n*Muslim–Quraysh War\n*Battle of Badr\nNotes"
