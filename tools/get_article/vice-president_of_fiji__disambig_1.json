The vice-president's role in government was mostly ceremonial as its sole purpose was to replace the president in his absence, death, or inability to hold office. The vice-presidency was abolished in 2013, with the powers of the office transferred to the Chief Justice of Fiji, who has a dormant commission which is triggered when the position of president of Fiji is either vacant or when the president is either absent or ill.\nHistory of the office\nUnder the terms the 1990 Constitution of Fiji, the vice-presidency was divided between two persons, styled first vice-president and second vice-president, respectively, but a single person held the office of vice-president from 1999, when the 1997 Constitution of Fiji came into effect.\nUnder the terms of the 1997 Constitution, the vice-president was appointed by the Great Council of Chiefs, after consultation with the prime minister. In April 2009, however, the Constitution was suspended, following the earlier suspension of the Great Council of Chiefs in April 2007. Six days after the suspension of the Constitution, the government issued a decree stating that the vice-president would henceforth be appointed by the president. Ratu Epeli Nailatikau was appointed vice-president the following day.\nUnder the terms of the 2013 Constitution, the vice-presidency was abolished, with its duties and powers transferred to the chief justice.\nBeing appointees of the all-indigenous Great Council of Chiefs, Fiji's vice-presidents, like its presidents, have all been indigenous Fijians (of chiefly rank). In 2007, Reverend Akuila Yabaki, Director of the Citizens Constitutional Forum, suggested that \"the time may be right now to allow a person from any race to take up this position\".\nVice-presidents\n{| width=100% |\n| width=50% valign=top |\nFirst vice-presidents\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Penaia Ganilau\n}}\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau\n}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=8| Vacant (15 December 1993 – 12 January 1994)\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara\n}}\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara\n}}\nSecond vice-presidents\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau\n}}\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau\n| alt_officeholder2       = Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara\n}}\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara\n}}\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara\n}}\n|}\nVice-presidents (single office)\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara\n}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=8| Vacant (29 May 2000 – 25 March 2001)\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Josefa Iloilo\n}}\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Josefa Iloilo\n}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=8| Vacant (5 December 2006 – 17 April 2009)\n| alt_party               = Independent politician\n| alt_officeholder        = Josefa Iloilo\n}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=8| Vacant (30 July 2009 – 6 September 2013)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=8| Abolished (6 September 2013 – present)\nReferences"
