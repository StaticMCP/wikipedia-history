She worked on African American history, social movements, labor and business history, and political economy. Her major works are World of Marcus Garvey: Race and Class in Modern Society, Running Steel, Running America: Race, Economy and the Decline of Liberalism, and Pivotal Decade: How the United States Traded Factories for Finance.\nLife\nJudith Susan Stein was born in Brooklyn, New York, where her parents were a stockbroker and a schoolteacher, attended James Madison High School, and graduated with honors from Vassar College in 1960. She received a Ph.D. in American Studies from Yale University in 1968.\nStein died from lung cancer in Manhattan, New York, on May 8, 2017, at the age of 77.\nWorks\nStein's first book The World of Marcus Garvey addressed a major African American leader and movement, as well as his era, the early twentieth century up until the Great Depression. Harvard historian Nathan Huggins, writing in the American Historical Review, said Stein, writing on a subject that is often \"overly heated... has written the most balanced and the most historically textured study of Garvey and his times.\"\nHer second book, Running Steel, Running America placed race in the context of economy. Business History called it \"[A] marvelous and important book, an immaculately researched,\npowerfully written analysis.\" It \"used the steel industry to chart the decline of liberalism\" wrote the Law and History Review\nHer third book, Pivotal Decade addresses the decade of the 1970s. Stein asked \"Why did the nation replace the assumptions that capital and labor should prosper together with an ethic claiming that the promotion of capital will eventually benefit labor.\" \"This book should be required reading for any- one seeking to understand how the economic re-structuring of the 1970s led to our current age of inequality,\" wrote reviewer Shane Hamilton, from the Department of History at the University of Georgia. In the final year of her life, she began working on a book about the 1990s and the triumph of neoliberalism. Entitled A Fabulous Failure: The Clinton Presidency and the Transformation of American Capitalism, the book was completed by Nelson Lichtenstein and published in 2023.\nAcademic activities\nStein was on the editorial board of the journal International Labor and Working Class History.
