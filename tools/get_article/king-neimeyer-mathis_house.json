It is a -story Craftsman style house, with a broad shallow-pitch gable roof.  Originally built outside the city, the city's growth has brought it within the city limits, but it still stands on more than , along with a number of agricultural outbuildings.  The house was built in 1917-18 by D. D. King as a summer house, apparently due in part to its proximity to the golf club.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Garland County, Arkansas\nReferences"
