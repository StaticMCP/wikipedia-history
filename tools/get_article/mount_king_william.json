It is located 10&nbsp;km southwest of Derwent Bridge. It is the northernmost of the King William Range.\nIt has two namesakes in the King William Range - Mount King William II (1363) and Mount King William III.\nIt is often a reference point for the 'end' of the inhabited part of the western section of Lyell Highway as there are no permanent structures until Linda; it is inside the eastern boundary of the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park.\nThere is also Lake King William, south of Derwent Bridge. It is dammed at Butlers Gorge, its south end.\nMount King William was named during Sir John Franklin's journey to the west in 1842, although the reigning monarch was in fact Queen Victoria.\nWC Piguenit painted it while on his journey through the area in the 1880s.\nHistorical photograph\n* http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an23768341\nReferences"
