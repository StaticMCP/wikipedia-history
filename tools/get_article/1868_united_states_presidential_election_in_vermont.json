Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nVermont voted for the Republican nominee, Ulysses S. Grant, over the Democratic nominee, Horatio Seymour. Grant won the state by a margin of 57.14%.\nWith 78.57% of the popular vote, Vermont would be Grant's strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote. In addition, Grant's performance in Vermont in popular vote percentage was the second-best for a Republican presidential candidate only after William McKinley's 80.08% in 1896. Grant's performance in Addison County is also the last time that a Republican, or any candidate, has received over 90% in a Vermont county, and one of only two occasions (along with Abraham Lincoln's performance in Addison four years earlier) that a candidate has done so despite the state's overwhelming Republican dominance for nearly a century.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Vermont\nReferences"
