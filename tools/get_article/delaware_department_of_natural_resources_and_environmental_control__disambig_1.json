DNREC is composed of various subagencies: the Office of the Secretary; the Division of Air Quality; the Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances; the Division of Water; the Division of Climate, Coastal and Energy; the Division of Fish and Wildlife; the Division of Parks and Recreation; and the Division of Watershed Stewardship. Its offices are primarily based in Dover, the state capital.\nMission and organization\nThe agency's mission is to:\n*“Engage all stakeholders to ensure the wise management, conservation and enhancement of the State’s natural resources\n*“Protect public health and the environment\n*“Provide quality outdoor recreation\n*“Improve the quality of life\n*“Lead energy policy and climate preparedness\n*“And educate the public on historic, cultural and natural resource use, requirements and issues.”\nOrganization\nOver the years, DNREC was reorganized, and the four original divisions were split into seven, with each led by a director and the divisions specified in state law. The agency also contains a central administrative office and its own statewide law enforcement agency, the Delaware Natural Resource Police which is organized into three units: Environmental Crimes, Fish and Wildlife, and Parks and Recreation.\nThe current divisions are:\nThe Division of Parks and Recreation oversee 17 state parks and the Brandywine Zoo, together comprising more than 20,000 acres. It also manages nature preserves and conservation easements and is responsible for some historic sites, such as Fort Delaware and Fort DuPont. More than 8 million people visited Delaware parks in 2022.\nThe Division of Climate, Coastal and Energy focuses on climate change, energy, and coastal programs in the state.\nThe Division of Air Quality issues permits and regulations around air pollution, including emissions, asbestos removal, and open burning.\nThe Division of Fish and Wildlife is responsible for conservation and offers licenses and education for hunting, fishing, and boating.\nThe Division of Waste and Hazardous Substances’ purview revolves around recycling, investigating and cleaning up contaminated sites, responding to incidents that involve hazardous materials, and ensuring citizens and companies follow existing laws around waste and hazardous substances.\nThe Division of Water manages and protects the First State's water, performing research, offering regulatory guidance, handling licensing and more.\nThe related Division of Watershed Stewardship is responsible for protecting the state's natural resources, overseeing wetlands and dredging and working with farmers.\nAdditionally, the Office of the Secretary handles administration for the Department and contains the Office of Budget and Finance, the Office of Administrative Services, the Office of Communications, the Office of Environmental Justice, the Office of Business Services, and the Office of Human Resources. These units are responsible for areas like budgeting, marketing, public hearings, environmental justice, human resources and legislative affairs. The Office of Communications, or DNREC OComms, offers guidance relating to and works on branding, marketing, community engagement, media relations, internal messages, event planning, web publishing, social media and multimedia production. It publishes DNREC news releases and oversees the agency's online magazine, Outdoor Delaware, and its digital newsletter.\nThe DNREC also hosts a number of public committees, boards, and other panels that handle specific issues like energy, fishing, and open spaces.\nHistory\nDNREC was established in 1970 through legislation passed by the Delaware General Assembly the year before. Previously, six commissions had been charged with overseeing the First State's natural resources: the Board of Game and Fish, Shell Fisheries, State Park, Water and Air Resources, State Forestry and State Soil and Water.\nIn April 2005, the first law enforcement shooting in the history of the Department took place. The incident involved two park rangers and resulted in the death of a robbery suspect.\nIn 2007 DNREC completed the first version of the Delaware Wildlife Action Plan, a strategy to conserve native wildlife and their habitats.\nIn 2014 Secretary Collin O’Mara left the post after five years to become the head of the National Wildlife Federation. He was succeeded by longtime DNREC employee David Small, who served for about three years until Governor Jack Markell departed office and his successor, John Carney, named Garvin secretary.\nIn 2015 there was an updated version of the Delaware Wildlife Action Plan. This edition was a 10-year plan to conserve all fish and wildlife and their habitats. The plan lays out specific species which are in the greatest need of protection, their habitats, possible issues, research areas, and conservation techniques. The plan also focuses on increasing knowledge through education and outreach. These projects would be funded through federal State Wildlife Grants. The plan is due to be updated in 2025.\nIn 2021 the Department unveiled the Delaware Climate Action Plan, a playbook designed to direct decisionmakers as to what steps to take when it comes to combating climate change. As the lowest-lying state in the country, Delaware is at particular risk of sea level rise. The Climate Action Plan focuses on mitigating the worst effects of climate change while proactively working to take bold steps to get ahead of the issue. The plan calls for lessening greenhouse gas emissions through a move to clean and renewable energy, using energy efficiency measures, transitioning to zero-emissions vehicles, managing greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide and fighting carbon emissions by preserving forests and greenspaces that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.\nIn 2023, Secretary Shawn Garvin announced the state would adopt regulations requiring car manufacturers to deliver an increasing percentage of zero-emission vehicles to the state. Similar to policies adopted in some other states as an anti-climate change measure, the initiative would require 43% of new cars and trucks sent to Delaware for sale be zero-emission vehicles starting with model year 2027. This percentage would grow every year until hitting 82% in 2032. Officials expressed hope the regulations would make it easier for Delawareans to drive electric and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases released to the atmosphere.\nFor the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, DNREC was allocated about $160 million from the state budget, including 785 positions.\nAfter Matt Meyer took office as governor in 2025, he nominated Greg Patterson, a career civil servant, as secretary. Patterson was confirmed by the Delaware Senate in January.\nList of department secretaries\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Secretary\n!Term began\n!Term ended\n|-\n|Austin N.
