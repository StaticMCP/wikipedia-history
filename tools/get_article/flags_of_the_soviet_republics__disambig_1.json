So they expressed the idea of a union state, asked to use the symbols of the State flag of the Soviet Union, such as the gold hammer and sickle and the red star, as well as maintain the predominance of red color on the flag of the Union republics. National, historical and cultural features of each republic was instructed to express the other colors and the order of their location, as well as the location based on the national emblem or coat of arms. After competitions for the best projects from 1949 to 1954 the new flags of the 16 republics were developed and adopted. The authorities in Ukraine and Byelorussia were the first to adopt the flags on 5 July 1950, and 25 December 1951, respectively. All others followed suit between 1952 and 1953 with the last republic, the Russian SFSR, adopted the flag on 9 January 1954. With the exception of Russia, all republics adopted at least one horizontal stripe in a non-red color, whereas the RSFSR chose a simple light-blue vertical stripe instead.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, only Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan (without hammer and sickle), Turkmenistan, and Ukraine (with the blue and yellow flag already de facto restored as co-flag) retained their Soviet republic flags as independent states until the new official flags were adopted in 1992. Since 1995 (current version adopted in 2012) Belarus retains its old Soviet-era flag with only minor changes.\nTheir final versions prior to re-adoption of the non-Soviet national flags were as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable noresize\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|Flag !!

Today, the only former Soviet Union territories that use modified versions of their original Soviet flag are the republic of Transnistria (a state of limited recognition, formerly part of the Moldavian SSR) and Belarus (since 1995).\nThe official flags of the ASSRs were seldom used, and were generally the flag of the republic to which the ASSR belonged, defaced with the ASSR name in its own language(s) and the official language of the SSR; flags matching this pattern are not displayed in the gallery below:\nFile:Flag of Abkhazian SSR.svg | Flag of the SSR of Abkhazia\nFile:Flag of the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic.svg | Flag of the Bukharan PSR\nFile:Flag of Khiva 1920-1923.svg | Flag of the Khorezm PSR\nFile:Flag of Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (1925-1932).svg | Flag of the Moldavian ASSR\nFile:Flag of the Tajik ASSR (1929.02-1929.04).svg | Flag of the Tajik ASSR\nFile:Flag of the Transcaucasian SFSR (variant).svg | Flag of the Transcaucasian SFSR\nFile:Flag of Transnistria (state).svg|Flag of the Pridnestrovian PMSSR/Transnistria\nFile:Turkestan Autonomous SSR Flag.svg|Flag of the Turkestan ASSR .}}\nGallery\nUSSRRepublicsPoster1954.jpg|1954 poster featuring flags of the 16 republics at the time.\nRIAN archive 140800 Signing of Protocol on Establishing Commonwealth of Independent States.jpg|Remaining uses of Soviet republic flags visible during the signing of the Alma-Ata Protocol.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/su_tab.html FotW chart of all the flags of the SSRs through history]"
