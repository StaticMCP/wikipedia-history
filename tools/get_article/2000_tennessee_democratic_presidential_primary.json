The Tennessee primary was an open primary, with the state awarding 81 delegates towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of which 68 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nVice president Al Gore easily decided the primary in his home state, winning 92.1% of the vote and all 68 delegates. Senator Bill Bradley took only 5.3% of the vote and earned 0 delegates, while Lyndon LaRouche Jr. only got 0.5% of the vote.\nProcedure\nTennessee was one of six states which held primaries on March 14, 2000, alongside Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas after Super Tuesday the week before.\nVoting was expected to take place throughout the state from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. in the parts of the state in the Eastern Time Zone, and from 8:00&nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. in parts of the state in the Central Time Zone.\nIn the open primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 68 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 3 and 7 were allocated to each of the state's 9 congressional districts and another 9 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 15 at-large delegates.\nAfterwards, the state executive committee convened to vote on the 15 at-large and 9 pledged PLEO delegates for the Democratic National Convention. The delegation also included 12 unpledged PLEO delegates: 7 members of the Democratic National Committee, 4 representatives from Congress (Bob Clement, Bart Gordon, John Tanner, and Harold Ford Jr.), 1 distinguished party leader, that being Vice president Al Gore himself, and 1 add-on.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Lyndon LaRouche Jr.\nWithdrawn\n*Bill Bradley\nThere was also an Uncommitted option.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 Tennessee Democratic presidential primary\n!
