Although they were hit hard by dysentery Oudinot started a new offensive.\nRussian troops moved towards the village of Kokhanovichi, since d'Auvray decided that the lateral advance guard of the French was heading there, and his main forces were heading towards the city of Sebezh. In fact, the French are into this for a while they was moving towards Osveya, across from the Russian 1st Separate Infantry Corps. On August 10, Oudinot’s troops advanced to the Svolnyapekh River, the forward detachments occupied the village of Kokhanovichi, the Swolna manor and the village of Ostry Konets (several kilometers upstream the Swolna River), where there were bridges across the Swolna River.\nBattle\nNeither side was able to enforce the crossing of the Svolna.\nAftermath\nOudinot retreated behind the Drissa.\nSee also\n*List of battles of the French invasion of Russia\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
