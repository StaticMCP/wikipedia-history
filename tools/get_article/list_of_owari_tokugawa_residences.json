Their main residence was the Ninomaru Palace (Ninomaru Goten) at Nagoya Castle, while the Honmaru Palace (Honmaru Goten) was reserved for official guests.\nThe complex of Nagoya Castle included the Sannomaru Oyakata to the east, and the Shin Goten (New Palace) and the tea houses and pavillons of the Shitaofuke-niwa to the north. Other significant residences were the Aoi Oshitayashiki and the Ōzone Oshitayashiki.\nFurthermore, in Edo the Owari branch kept a number of large palaces and mansions.\nWhile many structures were large palaces or mansions with big land tracts around them, other residences were smaller for a reduced retinue.\nList of residences and mansions\nin Owari\n* Ninomaru Goten (二の丸御殿), Nagoya Castle\n* Sannomaru Oyakata, Nagoya Castle\n* Shin Goten (新御殿), Nagoya Castle\n* Shitaofuke-niwa, Nagoya Castle\n* Aoi Oshitayashiki (葵 御下屋敷), Nagoya\n* Ōzone Oshitayashiki (大曽根 御下屋敷), Nagoya\n* Yanagihara\n* Hioki Goten, Nakamura Ward, Nagoya\n* Higashihama Goten, Atsuta Ward, Nagoya\n* Nishihama Goten, Atsuta Ward, Nagoya\n* Yokosuka Goten, Tōkai\n* Ōno Goten, Ōno\n* Asamiya Goten, Kasugai\n* Sakashita Goten, Kasugai\n* Mizuno Goten (水野御殿), Seto\n* Arai Goten, Owariasahi\n* Komaki Goten (小牧御殿), Komaki\n* Tsushima Goten, Tsushima\n* Saya Goten, Aisai\n* Uzurayama Goten, Aisai\n* Hagiwara Goten, Ichinomiya\n* Kariyasuga Goten, Ichinomiya\nin Mino\n* Gifu Goten (岐阜御殿), Gifu\nin Edo\n* Nezumiana Yashiki (鼠穴屋敷)\n* Ichigaya Kamiyashiki (市ヶ谷上屋敷)\n* Kōjimachi Nakayashiki\n* Toyama Shimoyashiki\n* Tsukiji Kurayashiki\nReferences"
