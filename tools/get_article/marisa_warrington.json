She went on to appear in theatre productions with the Australian Shakespeare Company. She appeared in a number of television commercials and had a recurring role in the police drama Blue Heelers.

Sindi became a regular character in 2004, living with Susan Kennedy and dating Toadfish Rebecchi and then Stuart Parker. She was involved in a range of storylines, including stripping and later on, prostitution, when she needed to pay for an operation to restore her boyfriend Stuart Parker's sight. In 2005 she left the show when her character was committed to a psychiatric hospital because of violent tendencies. Her final scenes were screened in Australia in August of that year. In February 2017, Warrington reprised her role for one episode. She made another appearance in February 2018 and returned for a longer stint from 26 June 2018.\nWarrington formed the band Lucy De Ville with fellow Neighbours actress Marcella Russo and colleague Shaun Gardener.
