Dionne continued to lead the offense, the defense was unspectacular but solid, but it was a season of roster turnover as some aging veterans departed (e.g. Bob Nevin, Mike Corrigan) and others lost significant time to injuries (Larry Brown, Juha Widing, Sheldon Kannegiesser). Youngsters like Glen Goldup, Lorne Stamler, and Steve Clippingdale struggled although second year defenseman Gary Sargent was solid. The Kings added Dave Schultz (the \"Hammer\") to replace Dan Maloney who left in the Dionne trade for toughness, but it took nearly all season for the roster to gell. In addition, backup goalie Gary Edwards struggled and was eventually traded for Gary Simmons; he was not the answer either, so #1 goalie Rogie Vachon was overworked. The Kings were also stuck behind the Montreal Canadiens who finished an amazing 60–8–12; many say this was the greatest team in NHL history.\nAfter struggling near or below the .500 mark, the Kings won 5 of their last 6 games to finish 6th overall – the same as the year before although with 2 fewer points.\nFinal standings\nRecord vs. opponents\nSchedule and results\n}}\n|-\n|1||T||October 6,

the mini series. And for the second year in a row, the Kings scored in the first minute of game 1 and won 5–2. But unlike the prior year, they lost game 2 in Atlanta 3–2, forcing a deciding game 3 back in L.A. Vachon was brilliant as the Kings took a 3–1 lead into the 3rd period. But Atlanta scored late to make it 3–2, and the issue wasn't decided until the Kings got an empty net goal for a 4–2 win.\nFor the second straight year, the Kings faced the Boston Bruins in the quarter finals and again were heavy underdogs. Boston dominated the first two games in Boston, winning 8–3 and 6–2. The Kings offense woke up when they returned to L.A., but the defense continued to struggle and the Kings lost 7–6 to fall behind 3 games to none. Vachon looked exhausted (he had now played 74 games) and the Kings could not cope with Boston's size advantage. But they managed to outskate Boston in a 7–4 game 4 win, but it seemed a formality to go back to Boston for game 5. It was in that game that Vachon played one of the great games in playoff history. The Kings were badly outshot but in the words of Boston goalie Gerry Cheevers, \"Vachon did everything but stand on his head to make great save after great save.\" The Kings led 2–1 and clinched the game with an empty netter, forcing a game 6 in Los Angeles. In that game, the Kings fell behind 3–0 but battled back to tie the game in the 3rd period at 3. Then, as Kings defenseman Dave Hutchison went to clear the puck on a Boston power play, he broke his stick on the ice, turned the puck over, and Boston scored to win the game 4–3 and the series 4 games to 2.\nAwards and records\nLady Byng Memorial Trophy – Marcel Dionne\nAll NHL 2nd team – Rogie Vachon, Goalie\nTransactions\nThe Kings were involved in the following transactions during the 1976–77 season.\nTrades\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| May 28, 1976\n|  valign=\"top\"|To Los Angeles KingsJohn Campbell\n|  valign=\"top\"|To New York RangersMark Heaslip\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| June 12, 1976\n|  valign=\"top\"|To Los Angeles KingsGlenn Goldup  3rd round pick in 1978 – Doug Derkson\n|  valign=\"top\"|To Montreal Canadiens3rd round pick in 1977 – Moe Robinson  1st round pick in 1978 – Dan Geoffrion\n|-\n| September 29, 1976\n|  valign=\"top\"|To Los Angeles KingsDave Schultz\n|  valign=\"top\"|To Philadelphia Flyers4th round pick in 1977 – Yves Guillemette  2nd round pick in 1978 – Merlin Malinowski\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| October 18, 1976\n|  valign=\"top\"|To Los Angeles Kings5th round pick in 1977 – Julian Baretta\n|  valign=\"top\"|To Pittsburgh PenguinsMike Corrigan\n|-\n| January 22, 1977\n|  valign=\"top\"|To Los Angeles KingsJim Moxey  Gary Simmons\n|  valign=\"top\"|To Cleveland BaronsGary Edwards  Juha Widing\n|}\nFree agents lost\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| October 25, 1976\n|  valign=\"top\"|To Edmonton Oilers (WHA)Bob Nevin\n|}\nDraft picks\nLos Angeles's draft picks at the 1976 NHL amateur draft held in Montreal.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"4.0%\" | Round\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"4.0%\" | #\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"21.0%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"14.5%\" | Nationality\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50.0%\" | College/Junior/Club team (League)\n|-\n|2||21||Steve Clippingdale||  ||New Westminster Bruins (WCHL)\n|-\n|3||49||Don Moores||  ||Kamloops Chiefs (WCHL)\n|-\n|4||67||Bob Mears||  ||Kingston Canadians (OMJHL)\n|-\n|5||85||Rob Palmer||  ||University of Michigan (WCHA)\n|-\n|6||103||Larry McRae||  ||Windsor Spitfires (OMJHL)\n|}\nSee also\n*1976–77 NHL season\nReferences"
