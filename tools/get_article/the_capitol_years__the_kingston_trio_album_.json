The compilation also includes songs recorded by Kingston Trio-related groups, such as Dave Guard's pre and post-Trio groups, Dave Guard and the Calypsonians and The Whiskeyhill Singers, along with John Stewart's pre-Kingston group, The Cumberland Three.\nThe set also included a comprehensive 48-page booklet, complete with detailed track-by-track annotation.\nReception\n}}\nAllmusic music critic Richie Unterberger praised the compilation with reservations, writing \"Collectors will appreciate the inclusion of rarities by related groups like Dave Guard and the Calypsonians... Dave Guard and the Whiskeyhill Singers... the Cumberland Three... But this is way too much for anyone but the fanatic... for all its historical significance, the execution is usually far too sterile and whitebread to appeal to contemporary listeners, unless it's on purely nostalgic grounds.\"\nTrack listing\nAll songs performed by The Kingston Trio, unless otherwise noted.\nDisc one\n# \"Run Joe\" (Dave Guard and the Calypsonians) – 2:32\n# \"Fast Freight\" (Dave Guard And The Calypsonians) (Terry Gilkyson) – 5:13\n# \"Tom Dooley\" (Alan Lomax, Frank Warner) – 3:01\n# \"Sloop John B\" (Traditional) – 3:29\n# \"Dodi Lii\" (Traditional, Guard, Reynolds, Shane) – 2:10\n# \"New York Girls\" (Burl Ives) – 2:32\n# \"They Call The Wind Maria\" (Alan Jay Lerner, Frederick Loewe) – 4:32\n# \"Shady Grove/Lonesome Traveller\" (Traditional) – 3:14\n# \"Little Maggie\" (Dave Guard) – 2:26\n# \"Bay of Mexico\" (Traditional) – 3:34\n# \"Across The Wide Missouri\" – 3:54\n# \"Scotch And Soda\" (Guard) – 2:15\n# \"Pay Me My Money Down\" – 2:18\n# \"The Tijuana Jail\" (Denny Thompson) – 2:48\n#\"M.T.A.\" (Bess Lomax Hawes, Jacqueline Steiner) – 3:13\n#\"All My Sorrows\" (Arranged by Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, Bob Shane) – 2:45\n#\"Good News\" (Lou Gottlieb) – 1:58\n#\"Remember the Alamo\" (Jane Bowers) – 2:58\n#\"Molly Dee\" (John Stewart) – 1:43\n#\"The Unfortunate Miss Bailey\" (Traditional, Lou Gottlieb) – 2:08\n# \"Sail Away Ladies\" (Traditional) – 2:28\n#\"A Worried Man\" (Traditional, Tom Glazer, Guard) – 2:51\n# \"The Kingston Trio Sings For 7-UP (Spot #1)\" – 2:22\n# \"The Kingston Trio Sings For 7-UP (Spot #2)\" – 2:02\nDisc two\n# \"El Matador\"  (Jane Bowers, Irving Burgess) – 2:27\n# \"The Mountains O'Mourne\" (Houston Collisson, Percy French) - 2:49\n# \"Home From The Hill\" - 2:20\n# \"The World's Last Authentic Playboy\" (Bill Loughborough, David \"Buck\" Wheat) - 2:39\n# \"Raspberries, Strawberries\" (Will Holt) - 2:11\n# \"Bimini\" (Mark McIntyre, B.
