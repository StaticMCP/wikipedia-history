A military parade was held in Tiananmen Square in Beijing and various celebrations were conducted all over the country. China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping inspected the troops along Chang'an Avenue in Beijing. This parade was immediately followed by a civilian parade.\nParade\nIn December 1983, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened to approve a motion to hold a military parade on National Day the following October. It was the first one to be held in 25 years since the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in 1959. A parade for the 30th anniversary in 1979 was planned but was soon scrapped in light of the end of the Cultural Revolution and the death of Mao Zedong. On 12 December, the working group for the military parade was set up, with Yang Dezhi, PLA Chief of General Staff as the head. The parade was the first to be aired live on China Central Television and broadcast around the world via satellite. The parade was commanded by General Qin Jiwei in his position as Commander of the Beijing Military Region. It marked the first time that someone other than the Minister of National Defense had inspected a National Day parade and the only time that a paramount leader who wasn't in a state or party position had inspected the parade. During the inspection, in which 'The People's Navy Marches Forward' was the background music, the traditional greetings of Long live the Chinese Communist Party and response of ''Long Live the People's Republic of China were replaced with Comrades you have worked hard! to which the troops respond with Serve the people!'', in an effort to differentiate with Maoist parades.\n| title = An excerpt of Deng's holiday address\n| author = Deng Xiaoping\n| width = 40%\n| align = right\n}}\nIt also marked the debut appearance of the regular honor guard companies and the color guard of the Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion, which are the first to be inspected and march past dignitaries. The parade saw just over 10,300 troops march through the square, which was followed by 42 mobile formations and 4 flypasts. A group of Peking University students raised a banner made out of bedsheets that read \"Hello Xiaoping\", to which a surprised Deng responded with a smile and wave. In an interview with the ''People's Daily'' two days later, Defence Minister Zhang Aiping was quoted as saying \"The people of the whole country and all the men and officers of the Army saw with their own eyes that the troop were much better equipped\", referring to the military technology and armaments that were showcased. as it was the first to showcase Chinese made equipment.\nLeaders in attendance\n#Hu Yaobang (General Secretary of the CCP)\n#Deng Xiaoping (CMC chairman and Advisory chairman)\n#Zhao Ziyang (Premier, official master of ceremonies)\n#Li Xiannian (President of the PRC)\n#Chen Yun, First Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection\n* Other CCP Politburo members\n*Deng Yingchao (widow of Zhou Enlai)\n*Li Ximing (Party Committee Secretary of Beijing)\n*Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress\n*Deng Yingchao, Chairwoman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference\n*Ulanhu, Vice President of the PRC\n*Xu Xiangqian, the 4th Minister of National Defense\n*Nie Rongzhen, the first and only Commander-in-Chief of the PLA\n*Prince Norodom Sihanouk\n*Son Sann, 22nd Prime Minister of Cambodia\n*Khieu Samphan, Chairman of the State Presidium of Democratic Kampuchea\n*Hoàng Văn Hoan, former Vietnamese Ambassador\nMilitary Parade\nAt 10:29 a.m. Military Parade began\nList of participating divisions in the parade\nIn order of appearance (A bolded unit indicates that this is its first appearance)\n*Guard of Honor of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (Chinese: 中国人民解放军三军仪仗队)\n*PLA Ground Force Academy Cadet Officers Square Formation (Chinese: 陆军学院方队)\n*PLA Navy Academy Cadet Officers Square Formation (Chinese: 海军学院方队)\n*PLA Air Force Academy Cadet Officers Square Formation (Chinese: 空军学院方队)\n*PLA Artillery Academy Cadet Officers Square Formation (Chinese: 炮兵学院方队)\n*PLA Ground Force Army School Square Formation (Chinese: 陆军学校方队)\n*PLA Navy Seamen Square Formation (Chinese: 水兵方队)\n*PLA Air Force Paratroopers Square Formation (Chinese: 空降兵方队)\n*PLA Female Military Nurses Square Formation (Chinese: 女卫生兵方队)\n*PAP Armed Police Force Square Formation (Chinese: 人民武装警察方队)\n*Male Militia Square Formation (Chinese: 男民兵方队)\n*Female Militia Square Formation (Chinese: 女民兵方队)\nList of military vehicles paraded\n*HJ-8 anti-tank missile system\n*Type 82 self-propelled 130mm multiple rocket launcher\n*PHL-81 self-propelled 122mm multiple rocket launcher\n*Type 84 mine-laying rocket system\n*Type 83 122mm moatar-howitzer\n*Type 59-1 130mm moatar-howitzer\n*ZSL-93 infantry fighting vehicle\n*Type 63 armoured personnel carrier\n*Type 79 main battle tank\n*Type 70-2 122mm self-propelled howitzer\n*Type 70 130mm self-propelled rocket launcher\n*Type 83 152mm self-propelled howitzer\n*YJ-8 anti-ship missile\n*HQ-2A medium and short-range anti-aircraft missile\n*DF-3 medium-range ballistic missile\n*DF-4 intercontinental ballistic missile\n*DF-5 intercontinental ballistic missile\nList of military aircraft paraded\n*Xian H-6 bomber and tanker\n** along with Shenyang JJ-5 fighter\n*Xian H-6 bomber and tanker\n*Nanchang Q-5 ground-attack aircraft\n*Chengdu J-7 fighter\nMilitary bands and parade music\nA 1,200 piece band was present for the musical accompaniment to the parade.\nMusic\n;Welcome leaders\n#Ode to the Motherland (歌唱祖国）\n#''March of the Volunteers (National Anthem of the People's Republic of China) (义勇军进行曲）\n;Troops review\n#Troops Review March of the PLA (Inspection March of the PLA) (检阅进行曲)\n#Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention (三大纪律八项注意)\n#People's Navy, Marches Forward (人民海军向前进)\n#Ready to Fly to the Battlefield (随时准备飞向战场)\n#March of the Artillery Force (炮兵进行曲)\n#March of the Motorized Troops (摩托化部队进行曲)\n#March of the Armored Vehicles (战车进行曲)\n#March of the Rocket Forces (火箭部队进行曲)\n;Military Parade, drive-by, and flyby\n#Parade March of the People's Liberation Army (分列式进行曲)\n#March of the Artillery Force (炮兵进行曲)\n#March of the Motorized Troops (摩托化部队进行曲)\n#March of the Armored Vehicles (战车进行曲)\n#March of the Rocket Forces (火箭部队进行曲)\n#Ready to Fly to the Battlefield (随时准备飞向战场)\n;Civilian parade\n#Ode to the Motherland (歌唱祖国)\n#On the Field of Hope (在希望的田野上); audio\n#We Workers Have Strength (咱们工人有力量); audio\n#China, China, the Bright Red Sun Never Sets (中国, 中国, 鲜红的太阳永不落); audio\n#March of the Athletes (运动员进行曲)\n#Toast Song (祝酒歌); audio\n#Anthem of the Young Pioneers of China (中国少年先锋队队歌); audio\nCard sequence slogans\nList of card sequence slogans\n*'National Emblem of the People's Republic of China with 1949 and 1984\n*中国共产党万岁 (Long live the Chinese Communist Party)\n*保卫和平 (Defend the Peace)\n*振兴中华''' (Revitalizing China)\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MrbX10K7p4s 1984 China Military Parade Full Version | 1984年中国人民解放军大阅兵]\n*[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P30eoyLHR8A 1984 北京35週年國慶閱兵、羣衆遊行 （粵語旁述完整版]"
