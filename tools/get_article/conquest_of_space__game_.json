      "text": "# Conquest of Space (game)\n\nConquest of Space is a board game published by Duncan Games.\nGameplay\nConquest of Space is a game in which a board game for 2 to 4 players is centered on interstellar conflict and resource gathering. It offers both a basic and an advanced mode. The basic version functions largely as a race game, with random events driven by a \"Hazard and Challenge\" chart. The advanced version introduces player-versus-player attacks during the search for mineral ores used to power beam weapons, but these encounters are also dictated by the chart. Marketed to players aged 8 and up, the game aims for a younger audience.\nPublication history\nConquest of Space was the first game published by new small company Duncan Games.\nReception\nMike Willis reviewed Conquest of Space for Adventurer magazine and stated that \"Unfortunately, it lacks the excitement to attract a younger person and the complexity to interest someone of my advanced years(?!)\"\nReferences"
