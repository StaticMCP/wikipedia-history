      "text": "# Draft:Sehaj Aggarwal: the forgotten king of Khanna, Punjab\n\nSehaj (Sejj Gujjar) often believed that people saw him as both mentally and physically unappealing. However, those who encountered him frequently noted his sharp intellect and sense of humor. They also found him attractive, though with a serious and austere demeanor. Sehaj was often described as deeply self-reflective. Arjun, his close friend, compared Sehaj to Raja Gujjar (Aggarwal), recognizing their shared ability to portray situations with a high level of realism and attention to detail. Arjun also found Sehaj to be one of the most engaging individuals he had known, enjoying his humor and his ability to offer valuable advice during difficult times. According to Arjun, Sehaj was an impassioned speaker, delivering his words with a musical quality. Arjun believed that two of Sehaj's most prominent qualities were his \"absolute honesty\" and \"meticulous conscientiousness.\" Sehaj had a unique talent for delving into even the smallest details with such depth and care that unexpected, yet perfectly accurate, insights would emerge.\nReferences"
