This method has been recommended since antiquity and is now recommended by a number of personal development gurus.\nCommentary\nIn antiquity and the middle ages\nIn the ancient Greek treatise Economics, customarily attributed to Aristotle but commonly considered a work of one of his students, rising early is promoted.\nThe Chinese proverb, \"A year's plan begins in spring, and the day's plan begins in morning\", emphasizes that morning is the most important time of day. It has been recorded in proverb anthologies as early as the Liang dynasty.\nAnthony Fitzherbert, English judge and scholar of the Middle Ages, also promoted early rising:\nMarcus Aurelius, in the beginning of the fifth book of his Meditations, advises against 'sleeping in':\nIn modernity\nSimilar ideas were later expressed by Benjamin Franklin who wrote in Poor Richard's Almanack: \"Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise\". It is a saying that is viewed as a commonsensical proverb, which was included in \"A Method of Prayer\" by Mathew Henry who also listed it as a phrase \"long said\", and previously appears in John Clarke's Parœmiologia Anglo-Latina (1639). Franklin is also quoted as saying: \"The early morning has gold in its mouth\", a translation of the German proverb \"Morgenstund hat Gold im Mund\".\nIn 1855, Anna Laetitia Waring published a book entitled \"'Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise', or, Early Rising: A Natural, Social, and Religious Duty\" sometimes misattributed to Franklin.\nWithin the context of religious observances, spiritual writers, most notably Saint Josemaría Escrivá, have called this practice \"the heroic minute\", referring to the sacrifice which this entails.\n\"The early bird gets the worm\" is a proverb that suggests that getting up early will lead to success during the day.\nWhich brings to mind the immediate counterpoint: \"what about the early worm, shouldn't he have stayed in bed?\"\nJames Thurber, in his book Fables for our Time, ended the Fable of the Shrike: \"Early to rise and early to bed, makes a Shrike healthy, and wealthy, and dead\".\nCriticisms\nSuch recommendations may cast individuals with different natural sleep patterns as lazy or unmotivated when it is a much different matter for a person with a longer or delayed sleep cycle to get up earlier in the morning than for a person with an advanced sleep cycle.  In effect, the person accustomed to a later wake time is being asked not to wake up an hour early but 3&ndash;4 hours early, while waking up \"normally\" may already be an unrecognized challenge imposed by the environment.\nThe bias toward early morning can also adversely affect adolescents in particular.  Teenagers tend to require at least 9 full hours of sleep each night, and changes to the endocrine system during puberty shift the natural wake time later in the morning.  Enforcing early start times despite this can have negative effects on mood, academic performance, and social skills.\nSee also\n* Lark (person)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://archive.org/details/earlytobedandea00frangoog Early to Rise by Benjamin Franklin]\n* [https://leanlifesecrets.com/why-cant-you-wake-up-in-the-morning/ Why can't I wake up on time ]"
