There have been a total of eleven reigns shared between eight different champions and two vacancies. The current title holder is Thunder Masami who is in his second reign.\nTitle history\nAt the time of Professional Wrestling Just Tap Out establishment in 2020, a championship belt was not immediately produced, but instead, a ranking system was launched, later activating under the name of the male division \"JTO Ranking\" based on JTO rules that differed from other organizations. On August 14, 2020, Taka Michinoku won the inaugural \"JTO Tournament\" held at the Professional Wrestling Just Tap Out Shinkiba 1st Ring event by defeating Arata in the finals, thus becoming the first champion.\nIn 2022, a championship belt was produced with the cooperation of voters. On October 2, 2022, JTO launched a second-string ranking system, the J2 Ranking, due to the increase in the number of affiliated players, supplying opportunities for the promotion's championships.\nReigns\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO House\n|defenses = 5\n|notes    = Defeated Arata to become the inaugural champion.\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO Yume\n|defenses = 2\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO Itadaki\n|defenses = 2\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|defenses = yes\n|notes =\n|ref =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO Tournament 2022\n|defenses = 1\n|notes    = Defeated Ren Ayabe in the finals of the 2022 King of JTO Tournament.\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO Ran\n|defenses = 1\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO\n|defenses = 1\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO 4th Anniversary\n|defenses = 2\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO\n|defenses = 4\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO\n|defenses = 0\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|defenses = yes\n|notes =\n|ref =\n}}\n|location = Takamatsu, Japan\n|event    = JTO West Japan Series 2024\n|defenses = 2\n|notes    = Defeated Genta Yubari to win the vacant title.\n|ref      =\n}}+\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = JTO 6th Anniversary\n|defenses = 1\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\nCombined reigns\n.]]\nAs of  , .\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|†\n|Indicates the current champion\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!Rank\n!Wrestler\n!No. ofreigns\n!Combineddefenses\n!Combined days\n|-\n!1\n| Ryuya Takekura || 3 || 5 || 543\n|-\n!2\n| Fire Katsumi || 2 || 6 || 453\n|-\n!3\n| Taka Michinoku || 1 || 5 || 328\n|-\n!4\n| Yasu Urano || 1 || 1 || 156\n|-\n!5\n|style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"| Thunder Masami † || 1 || 1 || +\n|-\n!6\n| Kanon || 1 || 2 || 106\n|-\n!7\n| Ren Ayabe || 1 || 1 || 99\n|-\n!8\n| Keita || 1 || 0 || 41\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cagematch.net/?id=5&nr=5074 Queen Of JTO Championship at Cagematch.net]"
