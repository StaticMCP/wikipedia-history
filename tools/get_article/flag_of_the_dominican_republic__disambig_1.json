The blue on the flag stands for liberty, the white for salvation, and the red for the blood of heroes. The civil flag follows the same design, but without the charge in the center, which is the coat of arms of the Dominican Republic. The flag was designed by Juan Pablo Duarte.\nDescription\nAs described by Article 21 of the Dominican Constitution, the flag features a centered white Saint George's Cross that extends to the edges and divides the flag into four rectangles; the top ones are blue (hoist side) and red, and the bottom ones are red (hoist side) and blue. The national coat of arms, featuring a shield with the flag, design and supported by a bay laurel branch (left) and a palm frond (right), is at the center of the cross. Above the shield, a blue ribbon displays the national motto Dios, Patria, Libertad (English: God, Homeland, Liberty). Below the shield, the words República Dominicana appear on a red ribbon (this red ribbon is depicted in more recent versions as having its tips pointing upward). In the center of the shield, flanked by three spears (two of them holding Dominican banners) on each side, is a Bible with a small Latin cross above it and said to be opened to the Gospel of John, chapter 8, verse 32, which reads Y la verdad os hará libres (And the truth shall make you free). It is one of 28 national flags to contain overtly Christian symbols.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"; style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Haiti subsequently colonised Santo Domingo, the Spanish-speaking part of Hispaniola, and the Haitian colours became the basis of the colours of revolutionary flags in these Hispanophone areas, including the flag of the revolutionary organisation La Trinitaria.\nThe flag was made to reflect the Christian ideals of Juan Pablo Duarte, the father of the nation, with two white stripes of horizontal and vertical that join together to form a symmetrical cross, and in the centre a gospel of John, a Latin cross, and the motto “Dios, patria, libertad” (“God, fatherland, liberty”). The first flags were made by María Trinidad Sánchez, María de Jesús Pina, Isabel Sosa and Concepción Bona. Juan Pablo Duarte designed it and it was first hoisted on February 28, 1844, the day after the beginning of the Dominican Revolution against the Haitians. The ultramarine blue was to represent God's protection over the nation. The vermillion red color represents the blood shed by the patriots in our nation's struggle for freedom. And the white cross in the center symbolizes the peace and unity of the Dominicans.\nUse\nThe use of the Dominican flag is essentially regulated by [https://www.scribd.com/document/416788623/Ley-210-19 Law 210-19], which regulates the use of the national symbols of the Dominican Republic. This law stipulates the following:\n* The front side of the flag is the one in which the blue quarter is on the observer's left.\n* The flag will never touch the ground.\n* The flag will be flown every weekday on all official state buildings and offices, from sunrise to sunset.\n* The flag must not be displayed in poor condition (not torn, damaged, or dirty).\n* It is the duty of every Dominican to display the flag on national holidays (February 27 or August 16, for example).\n* When the flag is flown next to another, it must always be on the right (left of the observer looking at it from the front).\n* When the flag is flown vertically, the blue quarter in the upper corner, which is attached to the thick edge of the halyard, should be on the observer's left.\n* When the flag is placed horizontally on a wall, the flag shall be hung so that the upper blue quarter, which is attached to the right edge of the halyard, is to the observer's left.\n{|align=\"center\"\n|\n|\n| should be placed over the deceased's left arm.]]\n|-\n||\n||\n|}\n{|align=\"center\"\n|\n|}\nSpecific occasions\nOn days officially declared as national mourning, the flag is first raised to the top of the flagpole and then lowered to half-mast. The coffins of members of the Armed Forces and high-ranking public officials are covered with the National Flag. The celebration of Flag Day was first established in Official Gazette No. 5231 of May 1938, during the rule of Rafael Trujillo. It declared October 24th as Flag Day, Generalissimo Trujillo's birthday. Once the Trujillo Era ended, Law 6085 of October 22, 1962 (Official Gazette 8707 of November 3, 1962) established February 27, the Dominican Independence Day, as the national flag day.\nIn music and poetry\nThe poet Gastón Fernando Deligne composed a poem in honor of the Dominican flag called \"Arriba el Pabellón\" (Up with the Flag). Note that stanzas 7, 8, and 9 discuss the meaning of the flag's colors:\nSpanish\nEl rojo de su gloriosa\ndecisión dice al oído,\nSoy - dice - el laurel teñido\ncon su sangre generosa.\nEs el azul de su anhelo\nprogresitas clara enseña\ncolor con que el alma sueña\ncuando sueña con el cielo.\nEl blanco póstumo amor\na sus entrañas se aferra\ndar por corona a la guerra\nel olivo al redentor.\nEnglish\nThe red of his glorious\ndecision whispers in your ear,\nI am, it says, the laurel dyed\nwith his generous blood.\nIt is the blue of your longing\nprogressive, a clear banner of\ncolour with which the soul dreams\nwhen it dreams of the sky.\nThe white posthumous love\nclings to its depths,\ngiving as a crown to war\nthe olive branch to the redeemer.\nThere is also a national anthem to the flag for schools.\nChronology\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" border=\"2\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n! width=\"110\" |Bandera\n! width=\"100\" |Periodo\n! width=\"250\" |Uso\n! width=\"250\" |Descripción\n|-\n|\n|1492–1795\n|Flag of the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo\n|The Cross of Burgundy was used by Spanish military units in the 15th to 18th centuries and is often used to represent the Spanish Empire.\n|-\n|-\n|\n|1809-1821\n|Flag of the Captaincy General of Santo  Domingo\n|The French occupation of Santo Domingo threatened to distort the Dominicans' Spanish identity and customs.

The Americans, fearing that the debt would not be paid, militarily invaded the Dominican Republic in 1916 and, once occupied, implemented several economic reforms.\n|-\n|\n|1924-present\n|Flag of the Dominican Republic\n|\n|}\nPresidential Standard\nOther flags\nArmy flag\n|File:Naval Ensign of the Dominican Republic.svg| Naval ensign\n|File:Naval Jack of the Dominican Republic.svg|Naval jack\n|File:Air Force Ensign of the Dominican Republic.svg|Air force ensign\n|File:Bandera de la Policia Nacional de La Republica Dominicana.svg|Police flag\n|File:Bandera del Poder Judicial-Suprema Corte de Justicia República Dominicana.svg|Flag of Judicial Power and Supreme Court\n}}\nHistorical national flags\nGallery\nFile:Dominican Day Parade 2019 (50335870922).jpg|Dominicans in New York Dominican parade holding flags\nFile:DOMREP-s-dom-panteon-innen.jpg|Dominican flags at the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic\nFile:Protestas dominicanas en Santo Domingo 2020.jpg|Dominican protesting during the 2020 Dominican Republic protests at the Flag Square of Santo Domingo\nFile:Desfile Militar Dominicano de 2019.jpg|Dominican Army marching on Dominican Independence Day with flags\nFile:Dominican Republic students.jpg|Students with the 1844 Dominican Flag\nFile:Dominican people at Dominican parade, New York City.jpg|alt=|New York City Police Department holding the Dominican flag at the Dominican Day Parade\nFile:Dominican Republic People.JPG|Dominicans with flag in Hermanas Mirabal province\nFile:FDBteatro.jpg|Dominicans with Dominican Republic flag\nSee also\n* List of Dominican Republic flags\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
