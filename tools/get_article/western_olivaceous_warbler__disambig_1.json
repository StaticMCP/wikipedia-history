It is now considered a member of the acrocephaline warblers, Acrocephalidae, in the tree warbler genus Iduna. It was formerly regarded as part of a wider \"olivaceous warbler\" species, but as a result of modern taxonomic developments, this species is now usually considered distinct from the eastern olivaceous warbler, Iduna pallida.\nCharacteristics\n]]\nIt is a small passerine bird, found in dry open country, including cultivation, with bushes or some trees. Two or three eggs are laid in a nest in low undergrowth or a bush. Like most warblers, the western olivaceous warbler is insectivorous.\nIt is a medium-sized warbler, more like a very pale reed warbler than its relative the melodious warbler. The adults have a plain pale brown back and whitish underparts. Its body length is about , wingspan  and weight . The bill is strong and pointed and the legs grey. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are more buff on the belly.\nThis species doesn't wiggle its tail or does it uncommonly. Western olivaceous warbler searches for food at different heights.\nIt breeds in Iberia and north Africa. It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a rare vagrant to northern Europe.\nThe western olivaceous warbler is larger and has a browner tinge to the upperparts than the eastern olivaceous warbler. It also has a larger bill. The song is a fast nasal babbling.\nDistribution\nNorth Africa\nThe western olivaceous warbler occurs mainly as a passage migrant in southeast Morocco, although it also may breed in some densely vegetated areas there.\nReferences\n*Fregin, S., M.
