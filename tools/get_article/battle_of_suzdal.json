The Russians were defeated by troops of beg Mäxmüd, who became Mäxmüd of Kazan after the battle. Vasily was taken prisoner and was set free only after the enormous (200,000 roubles) ransom was paid. He also promised restitution of the lands of Mishar Yurt, that were bought from Tokhtamysh in 1343. Qasim Khanate was founded there to become a buffer state and the vassal of Muscovy later.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n\n---\n\n## Battle of suzdal\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Suzdal"
