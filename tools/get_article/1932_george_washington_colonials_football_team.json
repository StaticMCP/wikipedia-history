In its fourth season under head coach Jim Pixlee, the team compiled a 6–2–1 record and outscored opponents by a total of 149 to 76. In intersectional play, the team defeated Iowa, tied with Oklahoma, and lost to Alabama and Tulsa.\nWhen Iowa traveled to Washington, D.C., for its game with George Washington, coach Pixlee requested that Iowa withhold its two African-American players from the game and also not allow them to enter the dressing room or sit on the bench.  Iowa coach Ossie Solem agreed that the two would not play but refused the other requests, stating \"there isn't anyone big enough in Washington to keep me from taking all my players into the dressing room and onto the playing field.\"\nSchedule\n|October 1|||Griffith Stadium|Washington, DC|W 24-0||\n|October 8||Alabama|Griffith Stadium|Washington, DC|L 6-28|26,000|\n|October 15|||Griffith Stadium|Washington, DC|W 27-0|6,000|\n|October 22|at|Tulsa|Skelly Field|Tulsa, OK|L 14-29|7,000|\n|October 28||Iowa|Griffith Stadium|Washington, DC|W 21-6|11,000|\n|November 4||North Dakota Agricultural|Griffith Stadium|Washington, DC|W 20-0|12,000|\n|November 11||William & Mary|Griffith Stadium|Washington, DC|W 12-6|10,000|\n|November 24||Oklahoma|Griffith Stadium|Washington, DC|T 7-7|19,000|\n}}\nReferences"
