Agriculture in Canada is a shared jurisdiction and the department works with the provinces and territories in the development and delivery of policies and programs.\nThe minister of agriculture and agri-food is responsible for the department to Parliament. While the minister is head of the department, and provides policy/political direction, the day-to-day operations of the department are managed by the deputy minister, who is a public servant.\nHistory\nThe Department of Agriculture for Canada was formed in 1867. It was organized under the Department of Agriculture Act, which was passed by Parliament and given royal assent on 22 May 1868.\nThe first minister of agriculture, Jean-Charles Chapais, and his deputy, Dr. Joseph Charles Taché, were soon presenting important Bills to the House of Commons for the protection and improvement of Canadian agriculture. One of the first Bills was an Act Respecting Contagious Diseases of Animals, passed in 1869. This law gave the chief veterinary inspector, Dr. Duncan McEachran, who was also the dean of medicine at McGill University, authority to prevent the introduction of animal diseases into Canada.\nOther responsibilities\nIn addition to agriculture, the minister and the department had many other wide-ranging national responsibilities including immigration, public health, censuses and statistics, patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Over time, these other responsibilities were transferred to other departments. For example, the collection of statistics was transferred to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics (now Statistics Canada) in 1918, and healthcare in Canada was transferred to the Department of Health when it was created in 1919.\nPortfolio organizations\nToday, organizations for which the minister of agriculture and agri-food is responsible for include:\n* Canada Agricultural Review Tribunal\n* Canadian Dairy Commission\n* Canadian Grain Commission\n* Farm Credit Canada\n* Farm Products Council of Canada\n* Canadian Pari-Mutuel Agency\nIn 2013, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was moved from the Agriculture Portfolio to the Health Portfolio.\nLegislation\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada is responsible for a number of laws related to agriculture and food in Canada.\n*Agricultural Marketing Programs Act\n*Agricultural Products Marketing Act\n*Animal Pedigree Act\n*Canada Grain Act\n*Canadian Agricultural Loans Act\n*Canadian Dairy Commission Act\n*Canada Grain Act\n*Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Act\n*Experimental Farm Stations Act\n*Farm Debt Mediation Act\n*Farm Credit Canada Act\n*Farm Income Protection Act\n*Farm Products Agencies Act\n*Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act\nResearch\n]]\nAs part of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the Science and Technology Branch () has the mandate to propose solutions and opportunities based on science to support competitiveness and the sustainability of the agriculture and agri-food sector. It is also in the Branch's mandate to provide scientific information to inform departmental and governmental decision processes.\nUnder the Experimental Farm Stations Act dating back to 1886, farm stations across Canada were established, including the Central Experimental Farm. The officers of these stations had the duty of conducting research in a number of specific areas pertinent to agricultural productivity and conservation, and of making the results of such research known by publication.\nToday, the Science and Technology Branch includes a national network of 20 Research and Development Centres and 30 satellite research locations. The Science and Technology Branch has approximately 2,200 employees, including some 400 research scientists.\nThe goal of all activities is to address the major scientific challenges facing 21st century agricultural production systems:\n* Increasing agricultural productivity,\n* Enhancing environmental performance,\n* Improving attributes for food and non-food uses,\n* Addressing threats to the agriculture and agri-food value chain.\nIndustry support\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada is also responsible for supporting corporate and local agricultural producers and suppliers. They do this through a variety of programs and services including Agri-Geomatics which develops products and services for internal and external users, and program facilitation.\nThe department supports market growth through its market access and trade negotiation activities, and it works with Canada's provinces and territories to promote Canadian products. The department also supports industry by focusing on science and technology advances and helping producers mitigate risks.\nAgrivoltaics\nAgrivoltaics, also known as agro-photovoltaics, is the practice of using the same land for both solar energy production and agriculture. This system places solar panels above crops or pastures, allowing sunlight to generate electricity while still supporting plant growth underneath.\nThis approach helps farmers make more efficient use of their land, especially in areas where space is limited. Agrivoltaic systems can also protect crops from extreme weather, reduce water evaporation, and sometimes even increase crop yields by creating a cooler, shaded microclimate. In places like Canada, studies have shown that using just 1% of farmland for agrivoltaics could provide up to one-third of the country’s electricity needs, all while continuing food production.\nNotable people\nBotany\n* Faith Fyles  (1875-1961), botanical artist\n* Felicitas Svejda (1920-2016), creator of the explorer roses\n* Isobella Preston (1881-1965), plant hybridization/breeding\nCereals and Pulses\n* Nancy Ames, researcher of barley\n* Vern Burrows (1930-2020), international authority on oat breeding and utilisation\n* Jennifer Mitchell Fetch, expert in oat breeding\n* Soon Jai Park (1937-2018), author of dry bean breeding program\n* Charles E.
