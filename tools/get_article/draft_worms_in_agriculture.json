      "text": "# Draft:Worms In Agriculture\n\nIn an articl released by the united states government, they talk about how 6.5% of grain (or 140 million metric tons) produced is contributed by worms. This includes rice, wheat, rye, oats, barley, maize and millet.\nFor worms to make soil richer, they need to eat, digest, and poo the soil back out. They do this process by eating dead plants and animals and fallen leaves then they poo (worm castings) them out.  By doing this they increase plant root structure, provide better drainage, and enhance the nutrients for the plants. Because of this plants really rely on worms.\nBecause of pesticides, worms are dying off.  This really isn't good for because of how much plants and agriculture rely on worms. If worms were to go endangered or extinct, it would be extremely difficult or even impossible to grow plants.  If this truly happened plants int he agriculture department would significantly inflate to in-affordable prices.\nReferences"
