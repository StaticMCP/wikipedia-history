It lies about  south west of Berwick-upon-Tweed.\nIt is on the south bank of the River Tweed, which marks the border between England and Scotland.\nLandmarks\nThe ruins of Wark on Tweed Castle, originally an early 12th-century motte-and-bailey, lie at the west end of the village.\nThe Ba Green\nThe border between Scotland and England runs down the middle of the River Tweed, but between the villages of Wark and Cornhill, the Scottish border comes south of the river to enclose a small riverside meadow around  to . This piece of land is known as the Ba Green. It is said locally that every year the men of Coldstream (to the north of the river) would play mob football with the men of Wark at ba, and the winning side would claim the Ba Green for their country. As Coldstream grew to have a larger population than Wark, the Coldstream men always defeated the Wark men at the game, so the land became a permanent part of Scotland.\nNotable people\n*Robert Story (poet), 1795-1860\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://communities.northumberland.gov.uk/Wark-on-Tweed.htm Northumberland Communities]"
