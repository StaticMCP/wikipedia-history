This incident, along with various raids made into Danish-Norwegian territory against Ada in 1783, were used as justification by Danish-Norwegian Governor Kiøge to launch an expedition against Anlo in order to secure trade rights.\nAnlo had previously acquired a significant amount of territory from its neighbours in various wars, and knowing this the Danish-Norwegians sought to form an overwhelming alliance in order to effectively crush Anlo.\nThe resulting force numbered 4,000 in total, with Little Popo contributing the most troops at 1,100, and Denmark-Norway contributing only a handful, and Oto Brafo, Chief of Osu, acting as commander. These included Governor Kiøge himself, and Paul Erdmann Isert, who would later go on to write about his experience in the conflict.\nThe Ada-Danish Alliance opened the campaign by sailing along the Volta River on war canoes mounted with Dane guns. While Isert admitted the Anlo showed advanced tactics, they were no match for the sheer force of the Alliance. Keta, who had initially started off the war on the side of Anlo, abandoned their ally when it became apparent the allies were winning.\nDuring the course of the conflict the towns of Woe, Tegbi and Pottebra were razed, culminating in the razing of the Anlo capitol Anloga as the Danes lost control of their native troops. Although many Anlo defenders had fled Anloga in advance of the alliance, the defenders managed to inflict casualties upon the allies with Isert reporting 40 natives wounded and several killed, including some who committed suicide believing the battle to be lost. Isert asserts that Anlo Ewe casualties were heavier, with at least 13 being decapitated. Anlogan Civilians fled to Veta and Klikor.\nIn Ofoly Bussum, Prince of Glidji, negotiated a treaty with the Anlo Ewe on June 18. The treaty returned territory Anlo had previously acquired from all allied tribes and secured a Danish-Norwegian trade monopoly as well as the construction of Fort Prinzenstein. The warriors of Little Popo guarded the fort's construction, and Prince Ofoly Bussum received a monthly sum from it thereafter.\nAnlo commander Adagla drowned himself in a river rather than return home from defeat.\nSee also\n* List of conflicts in Ghana\n* List of wars involving Denmark\n* List of wars involving Norway\nReferences\n7.
