An example of case (1) was the character Zhang Liao, who was portrayed by Xu Shaohua in episode 12, Zhang Yakun in episode 39, and Wang Weiguo in episode 54. Chen Zhihui was an extreme example of case (2) because he took on four roles – three as generals from Wei, Shu and Wu (Xu Chu, Liao Hua and Taishi Ci) and one as minor warlord Bao Xin. Two other prominent examples of case (2) were Wu Xiaodong and Hong Yuzhou – the former portrayed Sun Jian in episode 5 and Sun Quan from episode 30 onwards; the latter portrayed a young Yuan Shao in episode 5 and Zhou Yu from episode 9 onwards.\nMain cast\n* Sun Yanjun as Liu Bei\n* Tang Guoqiang as Zhuge Liang\n* Bao Guo'an as Cao Cao\n* Lu Shuming as Guan Yu\n* Li Jingfei as Zhang Fei\n* Wu
