It is located at Spanbroekmolen, on one of the highest points of the Messines Ridge.\nFoundation\nLike the Spanbroekmolen cemetery nearby, Lone Tree Cemetery was established in 1917 at the start of the Battle of Messines. Most of the burials are of men from the Royal Irish Rifles 36th (Ulster) Division who died on the first day of the battle. Most graves are of soldiers who went \"over the top\" early in the morning of 7 June 1917.\nSome of the men buried here were actually killed by the explosion of the mine placed by the British Royal Engineers under Lone Tree hill at Spanbroekmolen, which was blown around 15 seconds later than planned. The Spanbroekmolen mine formed part of a series of mines under the German lines. It was charged with  of ammonal and set  below ground, at the end of a gallery  long. When detonated on 7 June 1917, its blast formed the \"Lone Tree Crater\" with a diameter of  and a depth of . The crater at Lone Tree was acquired in 1929 by the Toc H foundation in Poperinge, today recognised as the Pool of Peace memorial.\nThe cemetery was designed by J. R. Truelove. The cemetery grounds were assigned to the United Kingdom in perpetuity by King Albert I of Belgium in recognition of the sacrifices made by the British Empire in the defence and liberation of Belgium during the war.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&CRid=2158103 Lone Tree Military Cemetery] at Find a Grave"
