Among the features published in this series were writer-editor Robert Kanigher and artist Jerry Grandenetti's \"Mademoiselle Marie\", about a World War II French Resistance fighter, debuting in #84 (Aug. 1959); The War that Time Forgot featuring the Suicide Squad, the \"Enemy Ace\" and the \"Unknown Soldier\".\nPublication history\nOriginal series\nInitially, Star Spangled War Stories was a retitling of Star-Spangled Comics and continued the numbering of its predecessor with #131. That lasted until #133, when DC rebooted the numbering with issue #3 — even though there had already been three issues before that. The end result was that there are two separate comics numbered as Star Spangled War Stories #131, #132 and #133 — the ones issued in 1952 and the ones issued in 1967. \"The War that Time Forgot\" was an ongoing feature introduced by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Ross Andru in issue #90 (May 1960). The Unknown Soldier became the lead feature in #151 (June–July 1970).\nStar-Spangled War Stories ran for over 200 issues from 1952 to 1977. The series ended with issue #204. With #205, the numbering resumed under the title of The Unknown Soldier.\nThe New 52\nAn ongoing series, Star Spangled War Stories Featuring G.I. Zombie, set in the present-day New 52 DC Universe debuted in September 2014. This series was canceled as of issue #8 (May 2015) which went on sale in March.\nCreators associated with Star Spangled War Stories\nWriters who worked on Star-Spangled War Stories include Kanigher (its editor) and David Michelinie, Ed Herron, Bill Finger, and Bob Haney.
