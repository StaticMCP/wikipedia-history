There were various types for different taxes.\nAdhesive Duty (1918-c.1979)\nThese stamps replaced stamp duty ones. The first adhesive duty stamps were issued in 1918 with the portrait of King George V. In 1939 this design was replaced by a numeral type which was reused in 1966 with decimal values ranging from 1c to $200. Reprints and additional values continued until c.1979.\nBeer Duty (1885-c.1914)\nThere were several types of beer stamps for beer in kegs or bottles. Many different types were issued from 1885 until they were replaced by Australian beer duty stamps in 1918.\nBuffalo Fly Control (1941-1966)\nBuffalo Fly Control stamps were first issued in 1941, with eleven values ranging from 1d up to £5. The same design was reused in 1966 for the decimal set which had ten values from 1c to $10.\nCommissioner's Adjudication (1895)\nOnly one Commissioner's Adjudication stamp was issued, and it was used when there was dispute over the duty paid on a legal document.\nDevelopment Tax (1938-1941)\nThe first set of development tax stamps was issued in 1938, and additional values continued to be issued until 1941. Later that year these stamps were replaced by Tax Instalment ones.\nImpressed Duty (1895-1966)\nThe first set was a huge set with over sixty values ranging from 3d to £500. In 1901 a new set was issued portraying King Edward VII and in 1920 with the portrait of King George V. In 1930 these were replaced by numeral types which were reissued in 1966 in decimal currency, with values from 1c to $1000.\nLevy issues (1936-1961)\nVarious levy stamps were issued in Queensland until the levy system was discontinued in 1961.

Only one set was issued, with ten values ranging from halfpenny to £20. The pound values are very rare.\nStamp Duty (1866-1918)\nThe first set for this tax was issued in 1866 with the portrait of Queen Victoria. Until 1901, all stamp duty revenues portrayed the Queen, although a multitude of designs and sizes were used.
