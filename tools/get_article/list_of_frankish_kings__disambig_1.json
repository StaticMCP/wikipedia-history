The earliest group of Franks that rose to prominence was the Salian Merovingians, who conquered most of Roman Gaul, as well as the Gaulish territory of the Visigothic Kingdom, following the Battle of Vouillé in 507 AD.\nThe sons of Clovis I, the first King of the Franks, conquered the Burgundian and the Alamanni Kingdoms. They acquired Provence, and went on to make the peoples of the Bavarii and Thuringii their clients. The Merovingians were later replaced by the new Carolingian dynasty in the 8th century. By the late 10th century, the Carolingians themselves had been replaced throughout much of their realm by other dynasties.\nA timeline of Frankish rulers has been difficult to trace since the realm, according to old Germanic practice, was frequently divided among the sons of a king upon the king's death. However, territories were eventually reunited through marriage, treaty or conquest. There were often multiple Frankish kings who ruled different territories, and divisions of the territories were not very consistent over time.\nAs inheritance traditions changed over time, the divisions of Francia (the lands of the Franks) started to become kingdoms that were more permanent. West Francia formed the heart of what was to become the Kingdom of France; East Francia evolved into the Kingdom of Germany; and Middle Francia became the Kingdom of Lotharingia in the north, the Kingdom of Italy in the south, and the Kingdom of Provence in the west. West and East Francia soon divided up the area of Middle Francia.\nThe idea of a \"King of the Franks\" (Rex Francorum) gradually disappeared. The title \"King of the Franks\" is attested in the Kingdom of France until 1190, that of \"Queen of the Franks\" (for queen consorts) until 1227. That represented a shift in thinking about the monarchy from that of a popular monarchy, the leader of a people, sometimes without a defined territory to rule, to that of a monarchy tied to a specific territory.\nEarly Frankish rulers\n* Genobaud (3rd century?)\n* Merogais and Ascaric (4th century)\n* Marcomer (4th century), dux\n* Sunno (4th century), dux\n* Genobaud (4th century), dux\n* Mallobaudes (4th century)\n* Theodemer (5th century)\n* Ragnachar (died  509), killed by Clovis\n* Chararic (died  509), killed by Clovis\nSalian Franks\n* Pharamond (388-420), legendary first ruler of the Franks, reputedly father of Chlodio\n* Chlodio ( 420-450)\n* Merovech ( 450–457), perhaps a son of Chlodio\n* Childeric I ( 457–481), son of Merovech\n* Clovis I ( 481–511), the first Merovingian king, who united all Franks by 509\nRipuarian Franks\n* Childebert (5th century)\n* Sigobert the Lame (died  509), killed at the instigation of Clovis\n* Chlodoric the Parricide (died  509), son of Sigobert, killed by Clovis\nMerovingian dynasty\nEarly Kings of the Franks (509–613)\nClovis I united all the Frankish petty kingdoms as well as most of Roman Gaul under his rule, conquering the Domain of Soissons of the Roman general Syagrius as well as the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse (Aquitaine). He took his seat at Paris, which along with Soissons, Reims, Metz, and Orléans became the chief residences. Upon his death, his four sons – and later his grandsons – split the kingdom among them. Every son received a part of the original Frankish territory and also a part of the newly acquired Aquitaine.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%\" | NameReign\n! style=\"width:105px\" | Portrait\n! style=\"width:20%\" | Birth\n! style=\"width:20%\" | Marriage(s)Issue\n! style=\"width:19%\" | Death\n!

In 687 Pepin of Heristal took the title Duke and Prince of the Franks (dux et princeps Francorum) after his conquest of Neustria in at the Battle of Tertry, which was cited by contemporary chroniclers as the beginning of Pepin's reign. Between 715 and 716, the descendants of Pepin disputed the succession.\nFinally, in 747 Pepin the Short became Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia in addition to that of Neustria, making him ruler of the entire Frankish kingdom. He arranged for the deposition of the Merovingian king Childeric III and in March 752, Pepin was himself anointed King of the Franks. The office of Mayor was absorbed into the Crown, and this marked the start of the Carolingians as the ruling dynasty. Charlemagne was crowned emperor in the year 800, beginning the line of Holy Roman Emperors that lasted (with some interruptions) until 1806, although the title was held by German monarchs after 962.\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| NameReign\n! style=\"width:105px;\"| Portrait\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Birth\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Marriage(s)Issue\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Death\n!

The final division, pronounced at Worms in 838, made Charles the Bald heir to the west, including Aquitaine, and Lothair heir to the east, including Italy and excluding Bavaria, which was left for Louis the German. However, following the emperor's death in 840, the empire was plunged into a civil war that lasted three years. The Frankish kingdom was then divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843. Lothair was allowed to keep his imperial title and his kingdom of Italy, and granted the newly created Kingdom of Middle Francia, a corridor of land stretching from Italy to the North Sea, and including the Low Countries, the Rhineland (including Aachen), Burgundy, and Provence. Charles was confirmed in Aquitaine, where Pepin I's son Pepin II was opposing him, and granted West Francia (modern France), the lands west of Lothair's Kingdom. Louis the German was confirmed in Bavaria and granted East Francia (modern Germany), the lands east of Lothair's kingdom.\nThe following table does not provide a complete listing for some of the various regna of the empire, especially those who were subregna of the Western, Middle, or Eastern kingdom such as Italy, Provence, Neustria, and Aquitaine.\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n!Western Kingdom (eventually France)\n|-\n|\nNames marked with an asterisk (*) were not Carolingians, but Robertians.\n*Charles II, called the Bald, 843–877, King of Italy and Emperor 875\n**Aquitaine: Charles the Child, 855–866; Louis the Stammerer, 866–877\n**Neustria: Louis the Stammerer, 856–877\n*Louis II, called the Stammerer, 877–879\n*Louis III, 879–882, jointly with\n*Carloman II, 879–884\n*Charles the Fat, 884–888, Emperor 881\n*Odo,* 888–898\n**Aquitaine: Ranulf II, 888–889 (Ramnulfid, not Carolingian)\n*Charles III, called the Simple, 898–922\n*Robert I,* 922–923\n*Rudolph,* 923–936\n*Louis IV, called Transmarinus, 936–954\n*Lothair, 954–986\n**Aquitaine: Louis the Do-Nothing, 980–986\n*Louis V, called the Do-Nothing, 986–987\nAfter this, the House of Capet ruled France.
