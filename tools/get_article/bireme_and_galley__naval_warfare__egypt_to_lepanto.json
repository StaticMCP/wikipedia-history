Simbalist, and Terry Cheesman, and was published by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1978 as a 104-page book with 10 cardstock sheets and a clear plastic overlay.\nShannon Appelcline noted that \"From 1977-1979 C&S was supplemented by more than half-a-dozen books. The game innately appealed only to a very sophisticated group of the most serious roleplayers but amongst these players several of the supplements were quite well-received, including Bireme & Galley (1978) - which contained naval combat rules - and Swords & Sorcerers (1978) - which contained rules for the Norse, Picts, Gaels, Britons and Mongols.\"\nReception\nKen Rolston reviewed Sea-Steeds and Wave Riders and Bireme and Galley: Naval Warfare, Egypt to Lepanto in White Wolf #39 (1994) and stated that \"In general, I appreciate the historical detail and wider range of vessels described in Bireme and Galley, but I prefer the deck plans and roleplaying bias of Sea Steeds and Wave Riders. Either serves as a handy reference to ship design for FRP gamers, but if you can only have one, Sea Steeds and Wave Riders is the most useful.\"\nReviews\n*Trollcrusher (Issue 22 - 1980)\n*Recreational Computing\nReferences"
