A right-arm fast bowler and right-handed batsman, Hewetson took 163 wickets in his career, and scored 1,213 runs at a batting average of 14.44. He played twenty-nine matches for Warwickshire between 1919 and 1927, joining Oxford in 1922 and playing there until 1925. He played for Harlequins Cricket Club until 1927, and then for the Free Foresters Cricket Club until 1934. An alumnus of Shrewsbury School, he also played for them during his school years, and in 1920 he played at Lord's for a Lord's School XI against 'The Rest', taking a nine-wicket haul with the ball.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
