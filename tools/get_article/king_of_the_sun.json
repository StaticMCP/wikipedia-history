Recorded in Sydney, Australia, the album is a concept album based on a journey home after a hundred-year war. It was the final studio album released by the band in Chris Bailey's lifetime, who would die a decade later in 2022.\nCritical reception\n| rev2      = Faster Louder\n| rev2Score = positive\n| rev3 = 100% Rock Magazine\n| rev3Score =\n| rev4 = Beat Magazine\n| rev4Score = positive\n}}\nThe album was met with mostly positive reviews from the Australian music press.  Patrick Emery from Beat Magazine noted: \"With only minor exception, it’s Bailey in his finest whimsical folk-blues guise. The title track has a whiff of literary pretension, its lyrics a set of seemingly non-sequitur statements built around a simple melody and Bailey’s disaffected vocals. Sweet Chariot is arguably the classic contemporary Saints style – a lumbering blues-based pop lick and an aesthetic that sits perfectly with Bailey’s modern day Lord Byron persona. Million Miles Away (La De Bloody Da) would, if attended to in a brutal punk manner, be one of the great garage rock tracks; here, it’s an intriguing acoustic track of surprising depth. \"\nTrack listing\n#\"King of the Sun\"\n#\"A Million Miles Away\"\n#\"Sweet Chariot\"\n#\"Turn\"\n#\"Mystified\"\n#\"Duty\"\n#\"Road to Oblivion Part 2\"\n#\"Craters on the Moon\"\n#\"Mini Mantra Part 1\"\n#\"Adventures in the Dark Arts of Watermelonery\"\nBonus Disc \"Songs from the Stash\"\nAlso included in the 2012 CD release was a bonus disc called Songs from the Stash.
