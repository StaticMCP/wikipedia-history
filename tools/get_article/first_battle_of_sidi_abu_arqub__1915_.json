On Abu Urqub Mountain, towering a thousand feet high, a remarkable battle unfolded on May 13, 1915, between the Italian forces and the mujahideen led by Masoud Al-Shweik. The mujahideen achieved a clear victory, with most of the Italian forces being annihilated and around 200 Italian prisoners were captured.\nFollowing the battle, the Italian prisoners were taken into captivity, marking a significant victory for the mujahideen and highlighting the resilience of their defense in the face of Italian attempts to rescue their besieged forces.\nReferences\nSee also\n*Battle of Gasr Bu Hadi\n*Battle of Safsaf\n*Battle of Al-Rahiba\n*Battle of Bir Tabraz\n*Battle of Bir Bilal\n*Battle of Wadi Marsit"
