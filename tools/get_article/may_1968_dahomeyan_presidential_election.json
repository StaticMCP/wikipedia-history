Former presidents, vice-presidents, ministers, and presidents of the National Assembly were banned. The main former leaders and leaders of the 1950s, Hubert Maga, Sourou Migan Apithy, and Justin Ahomadégbé, were therefore banned. Basile Adjou won with 84% of the vote, but the results were invalidated due to insufficient voter turnout (turnout was just 26%).\nThe military government appointed doctor Émile Derlin Zinsou on July 17, 1968, on the condition that he be accepted by a referendum. A referendum on 28 July resulted in Émile Derlin Zinsou being confirmed as president.\nResults\nReferences"
