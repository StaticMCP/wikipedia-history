The ceremony was held on 11 June 2022 at the Hackney Empire theatre in Hackney, London, and was broadcast live on ITV, ITV Hub and STV.\nThe publicly voted categories were announced on 21 April 2022, with the vote opening that same day. This included a longlist for the Best Leading Performer accolade which replaced the Best Actress and Actor awards. The Best Female and Male Dramatic Performance panel awards were also replaced in favour of the Best Dramatic Performance category. These changes were made so that the categories were gender neutral. 2022 also saw the introduction of the Best Family accolade. The shortlist, including panel nominations, was released on 10 May 2022, alongside tickets for the ceremony being made available for sale.\nITV soap Emmerdale won all three viewer-voted categories, including Best British Soap, and tied with BBC soap EastEnders in both winning four awards. EastEnders actress Letitia Dean won the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement for her role as Sharon Watts, while Coronation Street writer Jan McVerry won the Tony Warren Award. Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks won two accolades for a storyline that sees Misbah Maalik (Harvey Virdi) realise she has been raped, with BBC soap Doctors claiming the Best Single Episode award for \"Three Consultations and a Funeral\".\nWinners and nominees\nPublicly voted\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
