The ward was first used in the 2002 elections. It returns three councillors to Havering London Borough Council. There was a revision of ward boundaries in 2022.\nAt the first five general borough elections the ward returned councillors standing as \"Independent Residents Association\" candidates who were not aligned with the Havering Residents Association council grouping that most residents association councillors in Havering have joined. By-elections in 2003 and 2004 were won by the Labour Party candidates but they did not retain their seats at the next election in 2006. The election in 2022 was won for the first time by three Conservative Party candidates. However, in the aftermath of the 2022 Wennington wildfire all three switched parties and joined the Havering Residents Association group on the council.\nList of councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
