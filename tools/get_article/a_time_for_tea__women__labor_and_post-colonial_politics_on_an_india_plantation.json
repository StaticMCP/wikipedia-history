      "text": "# A Time for Tea: Women, Labor and Post-colonial Politics on an India Plantation\n\nA Time for Tea: Women, Labor and Post-colonial Politics on an Indian Plantation (2011) is a post-colonial feminist ethnographic critique of labour practices in Indian tea plantations. Through personal interviews, anecdotes and a play, Piya Chatterjee examines the role gender, class, and race play in the production, consumption and circulation of tea. Transcending the realm of local politics and culture, the ethnography reveals the multilayered, multispatial, colonial dimension of gendered labour. She begins by deconstructing the image of the tea box itself to showcase how the image of the exotic tea-plucking women distracts the consumer from the harsh working conditions of plantations. By providing a historical account of the tea industry in India, Chatterjee reveals the intricate link between colonialism and the gendered division of labour in North Bengalese plantations. While gender is her main unit of analysis, Chatterjee explores the way in which colonialism has shaped and continues to shape, the patriarchal and class-based nature of plantations. Coming from a Global South perspective, she demonstrates the intersectionality of gender, class and race, as mutually constitutive mechanisms of oppression. Throughout the novel, she acknowledges her own privilege as a Global South academic and highlights the difficulties of speaking for the subaltern.\nAwards\n* Recipient of the John Franklin Hope Book Award from Duke University press.\nReview\n* \"A kaleidoscopic account of the phenomenon of tea, incorporating dramatic interludes via Antonin Artaud’s theatre of the absurd, the poetics of Edward Said and the opiatic imagination of Lewis Carroll, depicting the role tea plays in the high and low drama of empire building as it was and remain in transformation.\"–The Australian Journal of Anthropology\n* \"Those searching for an argument about the postcolonial tea economy, or to learn the history of trade unionism on the North Bengal Tea plantation, or even to gain a better understanding of the complexity of gender, caste, and ethnic relations in the region will be disappointed. [...] Her book is more properly read as a meditative and reflective work and deserves to be judged on these terms.\"-The American Historical Review\nAbout the author\nPiya Chatterjee is a historical anthropologist with a current position at the University of California as a women's studies assistant professor.
