He brought on Chris Bertolini to write the script and sold it to Spike. In an interview, White stated that he understood the audience to be \"18- to 34-year-old males who are the ones watching Spike TV\". He further stated, \"We're going to push the limits on this show, like Nip/Tuck and The Shield — violence, sex, bad language. We're going to see how big Spike's balls are on this one.\"\nFilming took place in Boston in late 2008. The working title was ''The War of '04''.\nDirector Walter Hill had his name taken off the film and was credited as \"Rob Marcus\". Hill's biographer calls the film \"unfocused and chaotic.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://letterboxd.com/film/madsos-war/ ''Madso's War] at Letterbox DVD\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RakITcVLBHs Trailer] at YouTube\n*[https://www.parkcircus.com/film/101138-Madso%27s-War Madso's War''] at Park Circus\n*[https://theactionelite.com/madsos-war-2010-review/ Review of film] at Action Elite"
