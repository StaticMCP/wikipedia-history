The trophies originally consisted of an abstract sculpture blending stone and methacrylate designed by local artist . The ceremony was broadcast on the regional broadcaster À Punt. New categories were introduced in the 2nd edition, broadening the scope of the awards to television series, web series and videogames, up to a total of 23 categories overall.\nIn 2021, on the occasion of the one hundred anniversary of the birth of Luis García Berlanga, the regional ministry of Education, Culture and Sport agreed on the renaming of the awards to Berlanga Awards () from the 4th edition onward to pay homage to the Valencia-born filmmaker. The  (EAVF), which had already registered the name of  in 2008, ceded the naming rights.\nIn 2024, partnership with the  (IVC) was severed as the IVC refused to back up the gala. EAVF decided to annul the informal agreement with the academy to lease the brand name of Berlanga, the academy determined that the awards would be known as Lola Gaos Awards, after actress Lola Gaos. Despite the Valencian government's withdrawal of support to the awards, academy president Teresa Cebrián stated that the awards would continue to be held, and that the upcoming edition would be re-scheduled from late 2024 to early 2025. As the design of the trophies was previously licensed by the IVC, it had to be revamped for the 2025 edition, with a new design by Kike Correcher. Likewise, the Valencian regional pubcaster À Punt Media reportedly refused to broadcast the 2025 gala.\nList of ceremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Edition\n!Ceremony Date\n!Venue\n!Host\n!Best Film\n!Broadcast\n!\n|-\n| align = \"center\" |  ||  || , Alicante || rowspan = \"2\" |  || The Uncovering || rowspan = \"6\" align = \"center\" | À Punt || align = \"center\" |\n|-\n| align = \"center\" |  ||  || Auditori, Castellón || Live Twice, Love Once || align = \"center\" |\n|-\n| align = \"center\" |  ||  || Palau de les Arts, Valencia || Núria Roca ||  || align = \"center\" |\n|-\n| align = \"center\" |  ||  || Teatro Principal, Alicante || Pere Aznar || The Sacred Spirit || align = \"center\" |\n|-\n| align = \"center\" |  ||  || Auditori, Castelló || Maria Juan || Vasil || align = \"center\" |\n|-\n|  ||  || Palau de les Arts, Valencia ||  || Kepler 6B || }}\n|-\n| }} ||  || Palau de la Música, Valencia || rowspan = \"2\" |  || La casa ||  || }}\n|-\n|  ||  || , Alicante || The Portuguese House ||  || }}\n|}\nSee also\n* Carmen Awards\n* Gaudí Awards\n* Mestre Mateo Awards\nReferences"
