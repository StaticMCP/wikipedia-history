It lies approximately  north-east of Nidzica and  south of the regional capital Olsztyn.\nThe reason for the settlement being small is the decision to expand the Muszaki proving ground in this area. As a result, only a small bit of the village is inhabited while older houses no longer exist. A similar thing happened with the nearby Puchałowo.\nReferences"
