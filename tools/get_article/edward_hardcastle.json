His uncle J A Hardcastle was Member of Parliament for Bury St Edmunds. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and Downing College, Cambridge before going into trade as a merchant, making his home at Prestwich, Lancashire. In 1863 he helped form the Manchester Southern Independence Association to provide support to the Confederate States of America. He was also a J.P. and Deputy Lieutenant for Lancashire, a governor of Owen's College, and of Cheetham Hospital, and a trustee of Manchester Grammar School.\nHardcastle was elected as one of two Conservative MPs for South East Lancashire at the 1874 general election. At the next election in 1880 both Hardcastle and his colleague Algernon Egerton lost to Liberal Party candidates.\nHardcastle returned to Commons at the 1885 general election, when he became the first MP for the newly created constituency of Salford North. He held the seat until 1892, when he stood down, and was replaced as MP by William Holland of the Liberals.\nHardcastle married Priscilla Buxton Hoare, daughter of Samuel Hoare, Junior, banker of Lombard Street, in 1851. Among their sons was Edward Hardcastle, Archdeacon of Canterbury.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
