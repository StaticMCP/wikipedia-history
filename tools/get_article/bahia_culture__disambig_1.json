Their ceramic tradition is one of the first found north of the Andes.\nChirije, a seaport, was a major Bahía archaeological site discovered by Emilio Estrada in the 1950s. Merchants traded finished goods and Spondylus princeps or red spiny oyster shells south to Chile and north as far as Mexico in exchange for precious materials such as copper and gold.\nFile:Bahia big-nose figurines.JPG|Big-nose figurines\nFile:Bahia neck-rest 2.JPG|Neck rest\nFile:Bahia orejera.JPG|Ear plug\nFile:Bahia sorceror's cauldron.JPG|Sorcerer's cauldron\nFile:Bahia witch or shaman sculpture.JPG|Witch or shaman sculpture\nSee also\n*Pre-Columbian Ecuador\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nmai.si.edu/searchcollections/results.aspx?culid=2730 Bahía (archaeological culture) artworks], National Museum of the American Indian"
