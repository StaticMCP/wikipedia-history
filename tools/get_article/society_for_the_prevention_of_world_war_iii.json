However, by 1948 it had failed in its overall mission, with JCS 1067 rescinded and the Marshall Plan helping West Germany's economic recovery, along with the rest of Europe.\nActivities\nIn addition to the monthly magazine Prevent World War III, the society engaged in a number of lobbying efforts.\nFor example in 1944, they distributed a booklet by T.H. Tetens entitled Know Your Enemy where the German people were depicted as inherently aggressive, militaristic, and a permanent threat to peace. 10,000 free copies were given to Congress, media, and other influential individuals such as clerics.\nIn March 1947, the society helped Eleanor Roosevelt and Edgar Ansel Mowrer organize a National Conference on the German Problem. The conference was held in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York and was attended by 185 prominent individuals, such as Albert Einstein, Henry Morgenthau Jr., Eugene V. Rostow, Helen Gahagan Douglas. The conference formulated a program to cripple the German economy and reduce the German territory. The resulting declaration, signed by amongst others the society, stated, \"Any plans to resurrect the economic and political power of Germany ... [were] dangerous to the security of the world\".\nProminent members\n*Rex Stout (In charge, also leading the Writers' War Board, government funded and with very close ties to the Roosevelt administration)\n*William L.
