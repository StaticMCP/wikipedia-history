It was originally inaugurated at the plaza of 1100 Louisiana. It is installed on Avenida de las Americas at Discovery Green in Houston, Texas, United States, since 2008. The painted fiberglass and steel frame sculpture features seven individual forms that represent features of Houston, including a chimney, church, dog, hedge, mast, phantom, and tree. Donated by the Dan Duncan family, it is part of Dubuffet's Hourloupe series, which has companion sculptures in Chicago, New York, and in Europe.\nSee also\n* List of public art in Houston\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.chron.com/neighborhood/heights-news/article/Downtown-sculpture-to-see-greener-pastures-1840477.php Downtown sculpture to see greener pastures] by Nancy Sarnoff (July 3, 2007), Houston Chronicle\n* [http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM3VW8_Monument_au_Fantome_Jean_Dubuffet_Houston Monument au Fantome, Jean Dubuffet, Houston] at Waymarking"
