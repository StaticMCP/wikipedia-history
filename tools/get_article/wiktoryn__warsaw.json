It was a small folwark-type settlement, located to the south-east from Włochy, to the north from the Fort V, and to the south from Szczęśliwice, and Zosin. In the late 19th century, it had an area of 151 hectares (1.51&nbsp;km2 or 0.58 sq mi), and a population of 33 people.\nIn 1931, Wiktoryn had 12 households placed along the current Czereśniowa Street. In 1932, the railway tracks of the Electric Commuter Railway line were built upon its borders connecting Włochy with Warsaw.\nWiktoryn had been incorporated into the city of Warsaw on 15 May 1951.\nReferences"
