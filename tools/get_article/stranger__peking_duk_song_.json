The song was redone by the trio several times over the year. Elliphant is grateful the duo ignored her request \"to give it to another artist\", saying \"I told them that maybe there would be a better person to do 'Stranger' because they weren't satisfied, I wasn't coming up with the vocal they wanted. If I heard it out there with some other girl now I would be so annoyed.\"\nAt the ARIA Music Awards of 2017, the song was nominated for three awards, winning Song of the Year. At the APRA Music Awards of 2018, the song won Dance Work of the Year.\nTrack listing\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
