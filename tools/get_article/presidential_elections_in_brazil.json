The current electoral law provides for a two-round system in which a candidate must receive more than 50% of the vote to win in the first round; if no candidate passes the 50% threshold, a run-off is held between the top two candidates. Every candidate has a running mate who disputes the post of vice-president; prior to 1966, the vice-president was elected separately.\nThe country has held presidential elections since 1891, spanning over a period of several different republican governments and national constitutions.\nOld Republic\nPresidentialism was introduced in Brazil after the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, and the first election was held in 1891. According to the 1891 Constitution, the right to vote was restricted to men over 21 years old who were not illiterate, homeless or enlisted-rank soldiers. The elections for president and vice-president were held separately and the same person could be a candidate for both.\nOverall, only a small portion of the population voted.  Since coronelism was common, the colonel elites often persuaded people to vote for certain candidates.\n1891\nThe very first president was elected indirectly by the Congress.\n1894\nFrom 1894 on, elections were held every four years.\n1898\n1902\n1906\n1910\n1914\n1918\n1919\nSince Rodrigues Alves, the President-elect, caught the Spanish flu and died before taking office, a new election was held in 1919.\n1922\n1926\n1930\nVargas Era\nWith the Revolution of 1930, the country was governed until 1930 by a military triumvirate, while Getúlio Vargas was the de facto president (officially President of the Provisional Government). The new Constitution predicted that the first president would be chosen by the Congress in an indirect election.\n1934\nA second election was scheduled for 1938, but it did not happen due to the 1937 coup d'état, under which another Constitution was written.\nFourth Republic\nAfter Vargas was forced to resign in 1945, a new state was born under a democratic constitution written in 1946. The new Constitution provided for direct elections every five years for both president and vice-president.\n1945\n1950\n1955\n1960\nMilitary rule\nWith the 1964 military coup d'état, the direct democracy ended and presidents (who were all members of military, except for the last one) were now elected by the Congress. The interval between elections was irregular.\n1964\n1966\nWith the two-party system, only ARENA and MDB could dispute elections. President and vice-president were now part of the same ticket. The 1966 and 1969 elections had only one candidate.\n1969\nFirst election under the 1967 Constitution.\n1974\n1978\n1985\nThe two-party system ended in 1979 and many other parties were created. This was the last election under the military regime.\nNew Republic\nUnder the  current Constitution enacted in October 1988, elections are held every four years (except for the first one, which was held five years before the second to match the centenary of the Proclamation of the Republic) and citizens elect a ticket for both president and vice-president. Voting is mandatory for men and women between 18 and 70 years old who are not illiterate, and optional for people aged 16–17, over 70, and illiterates.\n1989\n1994\n1998\n2002\n2006\n2010\n2014\n2018\n2022\nReferences"
