The oldest portion of this two story timber-frame house was built c. 1758, and is believed to be the oldest building in Warrenton.  The central block of the house is three bays, with a side passage plan.  It is flanked on either side by two-story wood frame wings.  The house exterior was extensively redecorated in 1870, adding a full-width porch and substantial Italianate and Folk Victorian woodwork.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014; it is a contributing element of the Warrenton Historic District, listed in 1983.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Fauquier County, Virginia\nReferences"
