A Polish insurgent unit under Edmund Taczanowski clashed with a detachment of the Imperial Russian Army and the battle resulted in Russian victory. The insurgents lost 5 men, and after the battle, Taczanowski ordered his party to withdraw towards Niechmirów.\nReferences\nSources\n* Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe.
