They are a widely-scattered hoard which have been found by metal-detectorists over the course of a decade.\nDiscovery\nThe first portion of the hoard was discovered in November 1999 and consisted of eleven coins. Subsequent batches were found in: September–October 2000 (35 coins), 2001 (21 coins), 2002 (13 coins), August–September 2003 (18 coins), 2005 (two batches of six coins and three coins), October 2007 (3 coins), 2008 (six coins). At least 116 coins have thus so-far been discovered.\nAcquisition and display\nThe first two groups of coins, the batches of 11 coins from 1999 and 35 coins from 2000, were acquired by the East Riding of Yorkshire Council and went on display in Sewerby Hall. The group of 35 coins were acquired for a cost of £13,500. The group of 18 coins from 2003 was acquired by the Yorkshire Museum.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*Andrew Woods from the Yorkshire Museum introducing coins [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJXlEximwO0 from the hoard in 2014]."
