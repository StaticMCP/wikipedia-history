Billy Slater would have won the award had it not been for a one-week suspension for an on-field fight that occurred late in the season which deducted three votes from his tally. Some experts called for a change in the rules claiming he deserved the award for being the best player that season despite the suspension but this never eventuated.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=150 |Award\n!width=125 abbr=\"Player\" |Player\n!width=175 abbr=\"Club\" |Club\n|-\n|Provan-Summons Medal||Nathan Hindmarsh||Parramatta Eels\n|-\n|Rookie of the Year||Chris Sandow||South Sydney Rabbitohs\n|-\n|Captain of the Year||Alan Tongue||Canberra Raiders\n|-\n|Rep Player of the Year||Greg Inglis||Melbourne Storm\n|-\n|Coach of the Year||Neil Henry||Canberra Raiders\n|-\n|Top Tryscorer of the Year||Brett Stewart||Manly Sea Eagles (22)\n|-\n|Top Pointscorer of the Year||Luke Covell||Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks (206)\n|-\n|Toyota Cup Player of the Year||Ben Hunt||Brisbane Broncos\n|}\nTeam of the Year\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=150 |Award\n!width=125 abbr=\"Player\" |Player\n!width=175 abbr=\"Club\" |Club\n|-\n|Best Fullback||Billy Slater||Melbourne Storm\n|-\n|Best Winger||Colin Best||Canberra Raiders\n|-\n|Best Centre||Israel Folau||Melbourne Storm\n|-\n|Best Five-Eighth||Greg Inglis||Melbourne Storm\n|-\n|Best Halfback||Matt Orford||Manly Sea Eagles\n|-\n|Best Lock||Alan Tongue||Canberra Raiders\n|-\n|Best Second-Rower||Glenn Stewart||Manly Sea Eagles\n|-\n|Best Prop||Petero Civoniceva||Penrith Panthers\n|-\n|Best Hooker||Cameron Smith||Melbourne Storm\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*Dally M Awards\n*Dally M Medal\n*National Rugby League season 2008\nFootnotes"
