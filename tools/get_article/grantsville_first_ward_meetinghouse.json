It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982; the listing did not include a 1952 addition to the building.\nDescription\nThe church building is located at 297 Clark Street and was a work of Scottish immigrant Hugh Alexander Ross Gillespie.\nIt is notable as one of few Church meetinghouses built with adobe and having Greek Revival styling that still survive. This one is especially notable for having its vestry attached to the rear rather than to the front of the meetinghouse.\nSee also\n}}\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Tooele County, Utah\nReferences\nExternal links"
