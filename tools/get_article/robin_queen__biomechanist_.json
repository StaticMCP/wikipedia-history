Her work involves research on foot and ankle biomechanics, sports biomechanics, and footwear biomechanics.\nEducation\nQueen earned a Bachelor of Science in Applied Science – Biomaterials with a minor in Physics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2000. She completed her Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering in 2001 and Doctor of Philosophy in Biomedical Engineering in 2004 at the same institution.\nAcademic career\nQueen worked as a graduate teaching assistant and project coordinator at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before joining Duke University Medical Center, where she was Director of the Michael W. Krzyzewski Human Performance Lab and Medical Instructor in Surgery and Orthopedic Surgery.\nShe joined Virginia Tech in 2015 as an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics, later becoming a full professor. Queen also directs the Kevin P. Granata Biomechanics Laboratory and holds affiliate appointments with the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine and the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute.\nResearch\nQueen's research focuses on applying biomechanical methods to assess human motion, performance, and rehabilitation. Her work includes studies on plantar loading, movement symmetry, and the effects of footwear on athletic and clinical outcomes. Her studies are often applied to orthopedic rehabilitation and sports medicine.\nProfessional activities\nQueen has served on committees and editorial boards in the field of biomechanics and orthopaedic research. She is a fellow of several professional organizations, including the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and the American Society of Biomechanics.\nShe has received recognition from professional societies, including the Jean Landa Pytel Award for Diversity Mentorship in Biomechanics (2023), the Adele Boskey Award (2020), and the Kappa Delta Young Investigator Award (2017).\nSelected publications\nJM Brisbane, MBA McCullough, C Baker, JS London, RM Queen.
