Awards have been presented since 1991.  The awards are given by the Colorado Center for the Book, itself a program of Colorado Humanities.  Awards are selected by a group of judges who are themselves selected on the basis of interest and competence.  The common criteria for each category are content, originality, and widespread appeal; each category also has additional criteria appropriate to that category.\nCategories\n* Fiction\n* Non-fiction\n* Poetry\n* Mystery\n* Science fiction\n* Colorado & the West\n* Biography/Memoir\n* Advice\n* Collections/Anthology\n* Children\n* Young Adult\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.coloradohumanities.org/content/colorado-book-awards Official website]"
