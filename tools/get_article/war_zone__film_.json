In response, some men feel compelled to apologize, hit her, yell at her, or engage her in conversation. \"Through these conversations, Hadleigh-West reveals the anger, fear and frustration as well as the affection, admiration and humor that characterizes relationships between men and women.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.yomaggie.com/war-zone.html War Zone official site]\n*"
