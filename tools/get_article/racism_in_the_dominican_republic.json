Since colonization, the Dominican Republic has negotiated the construction of racial hierarchies. The nation’s historically fraught relationship with Haiti informed its Anti-Haitismo. Prejudice during the US occupation embedded racism in the structure of the state. Rafael Trujillo’s authoritarian regime leveraged white Dominican identities in anti-black and Anti-Haitian rhetoric. These historical contexts laid the foundation for contemporary struggles with racism.\nand used racial persecution and nationalistic fervor against Haitian migrants.]]The contemporary Dominican Republic still contains policy with undertones of structural racism such as the 2013 court ruling which restricted citizenship for those of Haitian descent. The police and far right paramilitary groups such as the AOD also inflict violence on Black communities. A 2013 study concluded that the Dominican Republic was the second most racist country in the Americas. When individuals in the country were asked who they wouldn't want as neighbors, 15-20% responded those of \"another race\". Still, anti-racist and human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, fight for racial equality through tactics such as memory activism.\nHistorical foundations of racism\nThe historical foundations of racism in the Dominican Republic were built through successive periods of occupation that privileged whiteness and institutionalized anti-blackness. These dynamics culminated under the Trujillo regime, which violently weaponized racism as a core tenet of Dominican Identity.\nPeriods of occupation\nThe Dominican Republic’s stages of occupation, under Spain, Haiti, and the United States, implemented radicalized hierarchies and set precedents for anti-blackness and Anti-Haitianism.\nSpain colonized the island of Hispaniola from 1492 until the 17th century. Under Spanish rule, portions of the ingenious population were wiped out through disease and intentional genocide. The Spanish crown also enslaved indigenous peoples and ruptured existing social orders through the Encomienda system. In 1503, Spain brought enslaved Africans to the island. Once Spain began to extract sugar cane, the amount of enslaved Africans proliferated. The practice of slavery resulted in conflict, including the continent’s earliest recorded major slave revolt in Santo Domingo in 1521. Despite the contributions of enslaved Africans to the construction of the Dominican Republic, Dominican elites have since reviled and ignored African ancestries while glorifying European and indigenous contributions.\nThe western side of Hispaniola, now the country Haiti, became a French colony in 1697. The Haitian Revolution freed Haiti of French rule and by 1822, Haiti’s military occupied the entire island, including what is now the Dominican Republic. During this occupation, the Haitian government restricted the use of Spanish, restricted religious festivities, and used violent military repression. During occupation, most of the inhabitants of the East side of the island were of white, Spanish, ancestry. In addition to the repression of Spanish language and culture, the Haitian Constitution banned whites from having property: \"12. No whiteman of whatever nation he may be, shall put his foot on this territory with the title of master or proprietor, neither shall he in future acquire any property therein.\" This disenfranchisement caused the emigration of white Dominicans. Simultaneously, it cultivated a rejection of blackness in those who stayed. By 1856, The Dominican War of Independence gave the Dominican Republic independence from Haiti but their racially fraught history laid the precedent for Anti-Haitian and Anti-Black rhetoric. By the 20th century, Dominican intellectuals and elites imagined the nationhood as a white and hispanic.\nThe United States occupation of the Dominican Republic began in 1916 and lasted until 1924. U.S. racial ideologies shaped the Dominican Republic by promoting an “epidemic of negrophobia\", institutionalizing racism, and encouraging the Dominican Republic to code itself as white. During the U.S. occupation racist ideologies became state practice. U.S. officials associated blackness with criminality and disease, and public health laws were applied unevenly. A 1919 sanitary law criminalized prostitution, which disproportionately targeted Black women who, already denied work due to their skin color, had resorted to prostitution. Similarly, Black women found living with U.S. servicemen were deported.\nThe state institutions created under U.S. occupation, namely the military and police, relied heavily on racist recruitment. In 1921, U.S. officials instructed the constabulary to “lighten” the police force. White, Dominican elites, protested an integrated police force, citing fears of armed Blacks. The anti-blackness of the U.S. occupation was actively documented. In 1921, John Sydney de Bourg, of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), wrote that there was “an epidemic of negrophobia raging amongst the U.S. military authorities.”\nThe racial hierarchies built by the U.S. persisted beyond occupation. The military government served as a blueprint for Rafael Trujillo’s authoritarian regime. Under Trujillo, Dominican elites seized onto the whitening ideology of the U.S. and leveraged anti-blackness to consolidate the state.\nSocioeconomic status and racial hierarchy\nThe Dominican Republic, like most countries in Latin America that were colonized by Europeans, shows a strong correlation between race and wealth. The upper and upper-middle classes of the Dominican Republic are overwhelmingly of European origin. The middle class is the class with the broadest colour spectrum and is composed mostly of mixed race individuals of varying skintones, while the lower working-class is darker. The underclass is predominantly black, with many being of Haitian background.\nPeople of predominant European ancestry in Dominican Republic have an economic and social privilege, and have strong representation in politics, business and the media, while those of African ancestry are in the lowest strata of society. Thus in the country whiteness is often associated with wealth, intelligence, beauty, and cleanliness, while blackness is associated with poverty, lower education, and unattractive features.\nRacial classification in the Dominican Republic\nDue to the influence of European colonization and the propagation of Africans or \"darker people\" as inferior, being of African ancestry is often not desired or acknowledged in the Dominican Republic. The mixed-race population identify as \"Mestizo\" or \"Indio\" rather than Mulatto, preferring to acknowledge only their European and Native heritage, while those with darker skin and other traits associated with 'Blackness' face rejection and social exclusion. In Latin America, there is more flexibility in how people racially categorize themselves: they identify themselves mostly based on skin color and facial features and not so much their ancestry, allowing for more \"racial fluidity.\" For example, a person who has some degree of Black ancestry can identify as non-Black if they can 'pass' as such.\nSocioeconomic status also heavily influence race classification in Latin America and tends to be correlated with whiteness. In the Dominican Republic, those of higher social status tend to be predominately of a lighter color tone as are often labeled as 'blanco/a', 'trigueño/a', or 'indio/a', while poorer people tend to be 'moreno/a', 'negro/a, or 'prieto/a', the latter category being heavily associated with Haitian migrants.\nContemporary race relations\nEven in the present day, it is still found that racial identity is bridged to national boundaries. Dominicans define \"Dominican\" in opposition to “Haitian,” thus demonstrating the rhetoric, which prevails throughout the Dominican Republic, that physical appearance links to national belonging. Trujillo’s regime still has a long lasting influence on Dominican nationalism today.\nPeople of predominant European ancestry in the Dominican Republic have an economic and social privilege, and have strong representation in politics, business and the media, while those of African ancestry are in the lowest strata of society. The mixed-race population identify as \"Mestizo\" or \"Indio\" rather than Mulatto, preferring to acknowledge only their European and Native heritage, while those with darker skin and other traits associated with 'Blackness' face rejection and social exclusion. Thus, in the country whiteness is often associated with wealth, intelligence, beauty, and cleanliness, while blackness is associated with poverty, lower education, and unattractive features.\nThe Dominican Republic often socially denied people of African descent, due to the long lasting legacy of European colonialism, and the anti-black sentiment that the nation adopted and institutionalized after its independence.Smith, A. (2014). Racism in the Dominican Republic: A critical analysis of the processes of racialization in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. CERS Working Paper.\nIn Latin America, there is more flexibility in how people racially categorize themselves: they identify themselves mostly based on skin color and facial features and not so much their ancestry, allowing for more \"racial fluidity.\"Rodrigues Pinto, Simone (2018). \"Racismo de Estado e Anti-Haitianismo na Construção do Nacionalismo Dominicano\" (PDF). Meridional: Revista Chilena de Estudios Latinoamericanos (10): 45–70. doi:10.5354/0719-4862.2018.50855 (inactive 12 July 2025). For example, a person who has some degree of Black ancestry can identify as non-Black if they can 'pass' as such. The Dominican Republic had established the rhetoric that the Dominican Republic was a white nation.\nContemporary incidents of discrimination include the 2013 Court ruling, and the earthquake that impacted Haiti in 2010, which then led to the Dominican government revoking the citizenship birth from the Constitution, affecting hundreds of thousands of Haitians in the Dominican Republic at the time. The Court's decisions reflect long-standing racialized exclusion and argue that these racial boundaries are derived from nationalism and fears of \"Haitinization.\"\nAnti-Haitian policies are continuous in the nation, as mass deportations and police raids are very prevalent among dark skinned communities. The government deports thousands of people weekly, as they then gain criticism from the United Nations for violating humanitarian rights.Reuters. (2024, October 7). Haiti foreign minister blasts Dominican Republic’s mass deportation plan. Reuters.\nThe present environment of the Dominican Republic is surrounded by fear. Many Dominicans of Haitian descent avoid hospitals, work, and schools out of fear of being deported to Haiti. Racial discrimination in the Dominican Republic is prevalent and continuous, as activists continue to fight for equal rights.\nRace and state policy\nScholars note that Dominican state policy since Trujillo regime has continued continue to affect Haitian migrants, despite Haitian labour playing a substantial role in sects of the Dominican economy, such as the sugar industry. Scholars describe Dominican work conditions for Haitians on sugar plantations as “a modern form of slavery”. Scholars additionally suggest that public perception of the state’s treatment of Haitian migrants is perceived not as a social issue but rather an attempt to uphold internal differences between the two groups.\nIn 2006, a meeting between Dominican and Haitian representatives (mostly policy makers and academics) took place in order to discuss potential economic cooperation. However, the meeting became contentious regarding Haitian migration into the Dominican Republic. The meeting received national attention, contributing to the renewed debate that Haitian labour negatively impacted, instead of upheld, the Dominican economy. As a result, Haitian deportations by the state become more publicly supported. This meeting, along with the decline of the sugar industry and the increase in large-scale deportations starting the 1990s, was associated with a shift in government policy that reduced and stigmatized Haitian labour in the Dominican Republic.\nIn September 2013, the Constitutional Tribunal of the Dominican Republic stripped Dominicans of Haitian descent of their citizenship. Estimates suggests that about 210,000 individuals were stripped of their Dominican citizenship, greatly increasing their risk of deportation.\nIn 2022, the Dominican government ratified Decree 668-22, a provision that expanded enforcement operations and allowed for the expulsion of undocumented Dominicans of Haitian origin. Several experts see the provision as the continuation of an exclusionary legal regime enacted by the Dominican government going back decades. A 2024 study found anti-Haitain policies to be an essential component of many political candidate’s campaigns. The same study found that anti-Haitain and anti-migration groups were able to mobilize more effectively than opposition movements.\nIn April 2024, Amnesty International sent an open letter to Luis Abinader, the President of the Dominican Republic, calling for “an end to human rights violations against Haitians, Dominicans of Haitian descent and Black people.” The organization further demanded that the Dominican “restore legal channels of entry and stay for workers, students, family members, asylum seekers and migrants seeking legal residence in the country.” Abinader rejected the open letter, stating that the Dominican would continue to enforce its immigration laws and that the organization “had no moral authority” to question the country’s policies.\nToday, many Dominican citizens are frequently reported being denied national identity cards. Migrants or descendants of Haitian origin living in the Dominican Republic cite the lack of legal documentation as a major challenge in daily life. Even for Haitian migrants or Dominicans of Haitian origin with proper documentation, officials have been reported to confiscate and resell documents.\nRace and violence\nScholars link racial violence in the Dominican Republic to historical prejudice from the Trujillo regime, along with labour and economic exploitation by the state. Dominicans often label Haitian people as “black” in comparison to Dominicans, which scholars argue is used to create a social and political divide between the two countries. Racial violence in the Dominican Republic has been reported by both state actors and civilians.\nEvery government since Trujillo has regularly rounded up and deported thousands of Haitian migrants from the Dominican Republic, according to the Human Rights Watch. According to Richard Lee Turits, author of the Haitian Massacre review, migrants have been subjected to extraordinary exploitation and continual human rights abuses. Studies show that Domincans often rationalize violence against Haitian migrants as an effort to defend pre-determined racial boundaries, not as an ongoing act of discrimination.\nAt the turn of the century, there was a steady growth of violent attacks against those “perceived to be Haitian\". During this time, around 12,000 people “suspected of being Haitian\" were deported each year. Only thirteen instances of Dominican violence towards Haitians were reported to the media.\nIn 2006, 21 homes in the Haitian majority hamlet of Fao were burnt to the ground in retaliation for the death of a Dominican Soldier. In 2015, a young Haitian man was lynched in Santiago. The lynching sparked protests in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the United States over Anti-Haitian sentiment in the Dominican Republic.\nParamilitary groups, such as the AOD, have additionally called for the violent removal of all Haitians living in the Dominican Republic. Modern paramilitary groups gain public traction largely on social media, inciting violence that develops in the real world. Since the 2013 Constitutional Court decision, organized modes of intimidation and violence from paramilitary groups has continued. Human rights groups dedicated to protecting Haitian migrants, such as MONDHA, MUDHA, and MOSCTHA, have experienced online attacks such as slurs and death threats.\nAnti-racism\nAnti-racism initiatives have made headway in the Dominican-Republic. Historical memorials, grassroots campaigns, and human rights advocates have addressed the racist rhetoric towards Haitians and Afro-Dominicans.\nHuman rights organizations, such as Amnesty International, have drawn together resources to bring attention to discrimination that activists face who advocate for equal rights of Haitians and Afro-Dominicans. Amnesty International had urged Dominican authorities to protect protestors on the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and that without protection the result could be “physical violence and permanent silencing of a part of Dominican civil society.\" Groups similar to Amnesty International that advocate against racism, criticize the government and seek change in the policies that portray activists as a threat to the nation.\nScholarly research highlights that the Dominican government portrays protests against racism as undermining the national identity rhetoric that is defined by blanqueamiento (whiteness) and Hispanic backgrounds. Racial boundaries deny “Black heritage and differentiate Dominican identity from Haitian identity.\" Additionally, scholars defend that the assembly of anti-discrimination activists will “challenge the rhetoric of descent” that it used to define nationalism within the Dominican-Republic, while also highlighting African heritage.\nEdward Paulino notes the strategy of memory activism, in which he started the Border of Lights, a group that holds vigils as well as educational events, at the border of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, to honor those who lost their lives in the Parsley Massacre. The Dominican-Republic fails to recognize the massacre or hold any remembrance for those who lost their lives. Therefore, activist groups such as the Border of Lights, hope to “reshape collective memory” to accentuate the lost lives of Haitians and Afro-Dominicans from the massacre.\nActivists continue to fight against the displacement of Dominican born individuals of Haitian descent, as established by the 2013 Constitutional Court case. Many groups have conducted campaigns and filed legal challenges with global human-rights institutions to defend the rights and families of Dominican-born individuals who are of Haitian descent.\nDespite the activist mobilization, there is still backlash from political figures and nationalist agendas that perceive these racial movements as being led by foreign influence and a threat to the nation. Advocates in the Dominican-Republic hope to gain protection in fighting against racism to progress forwards in their social movement of gaining equality and addressing the racism that is built within the structure of the Dominican government.Estrella, Amarilys. “Dominican Republic’s Neofascist Paramilitaries Double Down on Right-Wing Repression.” NACLA Report on the Americas, vol. 56, no. 1, 2024,\nReferences"
