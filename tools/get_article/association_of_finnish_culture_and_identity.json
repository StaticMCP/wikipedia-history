The official name of the association is in German  and in French .\nHistory\nThe Finnish Alliance was founded by writer Johannes Linnankoski in 1906.  The founding date was the 100th anniversary of Johan Vilhelm Snellman, a prominent national Finnish philosopher and statesman. The purpose was and is still today to awaken and to strengthen the sense of national identity, to promote Finnish, especially Finnish speaking, culture. A significant goal is to cultivate the Finnish language.\nOne of the most far-reaching manifestations of the Finnish Alliance’s activities was the mass fennification of family names in 1906–1907. This was repeated in 1935–1936 with the result of more than 200,000 people changing their family names into Finnish. The Association of Finnish Culture and Identity has played a remarkable role in Finnish cultural life. It provided the initiatives which led to the creation of the Finnish Cultural Foundation (), Finland Society (, an organization to unite the Finns abroad), and the Family Federation of Finland (). The association started a magazine, Suomalainen Suomi (), which was renamed as Kanava () in 1973.\nThe President of the Finnish Alliance in 1930–1932 was Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland in 1956–1981.\nThe Finnish Alliance is an important element in the Finnish establishment. It provides expert advice on matters such as the displaying of the Finnish flag and Finnish family names. It creates and maintains contacts between Finland and Finns living abroad. The Association of Finnish Culture and Identity is well known for emphasizing the Finnish pupils’ and students’ right to determine for themselves the foreign languages they wish to study.\nIn addition, the Association of Finnish Culture and Identity pursues research, publishes books, sells Finnish flags made in Finland, gives lectures and is involved in many other activities in its goal to strengthen the Finnish identity.\nCurrent board\nThe current chairman of the association is professor emeritus Ilmari Rostila, 1st vice chairman is Susanna Koski, and 2nd vice chairman is Sebastian Vilja.\nChairmen\n.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
