It was a single-game tournament in 1922 and the first official match of the national association football team of Romania.\nPre-match\nThe trophy was named after Alexander I, the King of Yugoslavia. The match was organized to celebrate the wedding of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia with the Princess Maria of Romania, the event being announced by the Romanian newspaper, Ecoul Sportiv'' on 28 May 1922: \"On the occasion of the marriage of His Majesty King Alexander I with Her Royal Highness Princess Maria of Romania, His Majesty was pleased to donate a cup that will bear his name, to encourage the progress of the football-association sport in his country and in the country of his wife. This cup will be a challenge and will go definitely to the country which will win it three times in a row or five times in total.\" The game took place at Stadion SK Jugoslavija in Belgrade, Kingdom of SCS (today part of Serbia), and ended with a 2–1 win for Romania. Three kings were at the game: Alexander I of Yugoslavia, Ferdinand I of Romania and George II of Greece. Romania's equipment for that match was bought by one of its players, Elemer Hirsch and it was black and white, it is believed that the reason those colors were chosen is that Hirsch was a fan of Universitatea Cluj who had the same colors.\nMatch\n|score = 1–2\n|report=\n|team2 =\n|goals1 = Šifer\n|goals2 = Rónay Guga\n|stadium = Stadion SK JugoslavijaBelgrade, Yugoslavia\n|attendance = 5,000\n|referee = Heinrich Retschury (Austria)}}\n{| style=\"width:92%;\"\n|-\n||\n|\n|}\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n|width=\"10%\" |\n|width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|\nSquad :\nGK  Dragutin Friedrich\nBK  Andrija Kujundžić\nBK  Jaroslav Šifer\nHW  Stjepan Šterk\nHC  Artur Dubravčić (c)\nHW  Rudolf Rupec\nFW  Dragutin Babić\nFW  Branko Zinaja\nFW  Emil Perška\nFW  Vladimir Vinek\nFW  Ivan Šojat\nManager :\nVeljko Ugrinić\nPositions\n* GK = Goalkeeper\n* BK = Back\n* HW = Half-winger\n* HC = Half-center\n* FW = Forward\n|width=\"15%\"|\n|width=\"23%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|\nSquad :\nGK  Adalbert Ritter\nBK  Alois Szilagyi\nBK  Elemer Hirsch\nHW  Dezideriu Jacobi\nHC  Nicolae Hönigsberg\nHW  Francisc Zimmermann\nFW  Aurel Guga (c)\nFW  Carol Frech\nFW  Paul Schiller\nFW  Ferenc Rónay\nFW  Ioan Auer\nManager :\nTeofil Morariu\n|}\nPost-match\nThe Romanian newspaper, Ecoul Sportiv wrote after the game: \"The Romanian representative team wins the Golden Cup of His Majesty King Alexander, beating Jugo-Slavia 2–1.
