The School Library Journal called the story \"rich in the spirit of Christmas\" and called the illustrations \"rich in palette and detail.\" The Horn Book Magazine also applauded Bittinger's oil illustrations saying that they \"effectively portray both boys' imaginary travels.\" Rocking Horse Christmas was chosen by The American Booksellers as their \"Pick of the Lists.\" An article in Albemarle Magazine stated that Bittinger spent six months working on preliminary drawings and the illustrations for the book.\nOne of Bittinger's illustrations from the book was featured on the cover of the Lands' End kids' holiday catalog in 1997.\nReferences"
