The FvD first participated in elections in the 2017 general election, winning two seats in the House of Representatives.\nAt the time of its conception, the FvD was a conservative liberal and Eurosceptic movement positioned on the right-wing of the political spectrum. During its initial years, the FvD was defined as a national conservative political party focused on opposing Dutch membership of the European Union, political reform and protection of Dutch culture. Following the 2017 general election, the FvD saw a period of popularity in opinion polls and grew to become the largest party during the 2019 Dutch provincial elections. However, it underwent an ideological change and adopted increasingly radical policies and messages following the departure of several of its founding members and saw a subsequent decline in support. Presently, the FvD is regarded by media and political analysts to be a right-wing populist, nativist, far-right,  radical right or extreme-right political party.\nHistory\nFounding and early years (2016–2018)\nThe FvD was established by Baudet and Henk Otten as a citizens initiative and then a think tank whose main feat was campaigning in the 2016 Dutch Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement referendum and against the EU in general. The think-tank argued for the introduction of a referendum act and campaigned with GeenPeil to have an inquiry into Dutch membership of the eurozone. In 2015, Baudet along with journalists Jort Kelder and Arno Wellens took the initiative to parliament to call for a debate on the eurozone.\nIn September 2016, it converted itself into a political party founded by Baudet, Henk Otten and Rob Rooken and announced its intention to take part in the 2017 general election. The FvD ended up with 1.8% of the vote, entering parliament for the first time with two seats taken by Baudet and well-known lawyer and commentator Theo Hiddema.\nIn February 2018, in part due to its rapidly growing pace, the party suffered from internal issues with a number of prominent members leaving the party because they felt the party had a lack of internal democracy.\nElectoral breakthrough (2018–2019)\nIn the 2018 municipal elections, the FvD won three seats on the Amsterdam city council. The party only stood in Amsterdam. In Rotterdam however it endorsed the Livable Rotterdam party.\nThe FvD gained three MEPs during the 2019 European Parliament election in the Netherlands. The party's lead candidate was journalist and former Lijst Dedecker politician Derk Jan Eppink. During the campaign, Baudet pledged that the FvD would join the European Conservatives and Reformists and the party was subsequently accepted into the group.\nDuring the 2019 provincial elections, Forum for Democracy made a major breakthrough and won 86 seats, spread across the twelve provinces of the Netherlands. In South Holland, North Holland, and Flevoland, FvD became the largest party, winning 11, nine, and eight seats respectively. In all other provinces, the party came either second or third in terms of numbers of votes. As populists, the bulk of the Forum's nominated parliamentary candidates did not have prior active experience in other political parties.\nIn August 2019, former FvD senator and founding member Henk Otten announced he had registered Group Otten (GO) as a new political party. GO had two seats in the Senate and one seat in the European Parliament which were taken up by former FvD members.\nOn 30 April 2020, Forum for Democracy formed a coalition with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) in the North Brabant province, the first time the party had formally entered into the administration of a regional authority. In late 2020, former VVD MP Wybren van Haga defected to the party.\nInternal divides (2020–2021)\nIn 2020, a series of rows and divides broke out within the party. The events began in April 2020 after HP/De Tijd revealed instances of antisemitism, racism, homophobia and extreme comments including glorification of Anders Breivik and Brenton Tarrant in online WhatsApp groups associated with FvD's youth wing, the Jongerenorganisatie Forum voor Democratie (JFvD). The FvD executive board later investigated these instances and claimed not all the people involved were FvD members but discharged three individuals from the party. Three additional members were also suspended. In a statement, the FvD described the messages as \"completely unacceptable.\" More similar messages were revealed in November by newspaper Het Parool which published an article about extremist comments made by members the party's youth organization in social media chats, including support for Nazi Germany, which led to several JFvD coordinators being removed from their positions. At the same time, other former members of the JFvD came forward and claimed that they had raised concerns about extremist messages to the youth-wing board and the FvD's leadership but had been expelled from the party for sending \"defamatory material\" to the media.\nIn response, an internal committee of inquiry by the FvD executive board into these incidents was set up within the party with some FvD politicians such as Theo Hiddema arguing that the youth wing should be disbanded and replaced while others stated the FvD should follow the example of the Sweden Democrats by threatening the youth-wing with disassociation from the mother party unless it cleaned up. Baudet also announced he would resign as the lead candidate for the 2021 Dutch general election and Lennart van der Linden stood in as the party's temporary leader. The day after Baudet stood aside as leader, party vice-leader Theo Hiddema vacated his seat in the House of Representatives for \"personal reasons,\" although some media outlets speculated that this was due to controversies within the party. The following day, Senator Paul Cliteur also resigned from his position as Senate leader while remaining a member of the party.\nA day after his resignation, Baudet reversed his decision and said the party would hold a leadership contest. In response, several prominent FvD members accused Baudet of making antisemitic and racist statements. On 26 November 2020, Algemeen Dagblad obtained a letter by FvD Senator Nicki Pouw-Verweij alleging multiple incidents that had taken place during a campaign meeting for the election and at a dinner party held on 20 November for the FvD's candidates. These included Baudet repeatedly making antisemitic jokes and statements and expressing conspiracy theories such as claiming that the COVID-19 lockdowns were concocted by George Soros and lashing out at party colleague Joost Eerdmans who had challenged Baudet's remarks. Pouw-Verweij also claimed that while Baudet had criticized the party's youth-wing in public, he had privately supported some of the statements made by its members, and furthermore argued that the FvD had become more focused on conspiracy theories and trying to draw publicity by provoking controversy instead of holding serious policy discussions. Her accusations were supported by FvD candidates Eerdmans and Eva Vlaardingerbroek. Baudet denied the accusations during a subsequent talk show interview. The FvD's executive board announced an internal referendum among the membership on whether to keep Baudet as leader or expel him from the party and replace him with a new lead candidate. This took place on 3 December 2020, with 76% of FvD members voting in favour of Baudet remaining in the party and resuming the role of its leader. In protest at the outcome, the FvD's three MEPs, seven of its senators and some of its parliamentary candidates for the upcoming general election announced their departure from the party. Many of them joined JA21 founded by Eerdmans and former FvD Senator Annabel Nanninga who said the new party would stay closer to the FvD's original ideas.\nSplits and radicalization (2021-2024)\nAt the 2021 general election, the party campaigned against COVID-19 lockdown measures in the Netherlands imposed by the Dutch government and managed to win eight MPs. However, the issue of racist comments from youth members was brought up again during the campaign. One of the accused youth members, Gideon van Meijeren, was elected into parliament, as was youth wing chairman Freek Jansen.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the party caused controversy and saw another three of its MPs leave after it released a poster on Holocaust Memorial Day comparing lockdown measures with the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The three former FvD MPs later founded the Belang van Nederland party. The analogy and timing of the poster was criticized by the Central Jewish Board of the Netherlands. During the pandemic, members of FvD were accused of circulating conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and using further Holocaust comparisons with vaccinations and social distancing. In December 2021, a Dutch court found Baudet guilty of \"creating a breeding ground for antisemitism\" with his statements and ordered him to delete social media posts comparing COVID policies to the Holocaust or face a fine. Baudet denied that his statements were intended to be offensive or antisemitic.\nIn 2022, the FvD regained representation in the European Parliament when Marcel de Graaff defected to the party. As a result, the FvD became a member of the Identity and Democracy group instead of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR). In 2022 FvD left the European Conservatives and Reformists Party. In March 2022, Senators Theo Hiddema and Paul Frentrop left the party over FvD's absence at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's speech to the House of Representatives, leaving only Senator Johan Dessing. In October 2022, the FvD was suspended from the Identity and Democracy group after de Graaff expressed support for Putin on Twitter. He later quit the group and the FvD subsequently became a Non-Inscrit member of European Parliament.\nIn April 2023, a number of former party representatives and employees within the parliamentary group and at the party's head office described an unsafe environment within the FvD that had remained private for a number of years and included racism and antisemitism. A former press officer for the party claimed the FvD's direction and working environment was partly due to Baudet's excessive drinking.\nFor the 2023 Dutch general election, the FvD again nominated Baudet as the party's lead candidate. The FvD saw a reduced result and won three MPs, with Baudet, Jansen, and Van Meijeren retaining their seats. Some commentators attributed the smaller result to the FvD losing voters back to Geert Wilders and the Party for Freedom. In January 2024, Baudet announced the party had founded a branch in the Dutch-speaking Flemish region of Belgium to contest the 2024 European elections and future Flemish elections. However, the party did not collect enough signatures to appear on the Flanders ballot and did not secure enough votes in the Netherlands to return an MEP. The FvD subsequently left the European Parliament. In August 2024, it joined the Europe of Sovereign Nations with Alternative for Germany.\nLeadership change (2025-)\nIn the run-up to the 2025 Dutch general election, the FvD announced Lidewij de Vos would replace Baudet as lead candidate. She had previously stood in for Baudet in the House of Representatives when he was on paternity leave. This was seen as a move to reattract support for the party. In an interview with Algemeen Dagblad Baudet said he had become \"an obstacle\" for the party due to his image and wanted a younger leadership with a new style to take over. According to Dutch political scientist Chris Aalberts, the change was more of a cosmetic measure since the party's political course is determined by the FvD executive board which Aalberts claimed only consists of Baudet and a few of his confidants. The party saw an improvement on its previous result in the election with 4.5% of the vote and 7 seats.\nIdeology and political positions\nThe FvD's ideology and beliefs have shifted over time. During the period of its foundation in 2016, the FvD was initially described as a national conservative, eurosceptic and a conservative liberal political party. The party self-identified as liberal conservative and sat on the right-wing of the political spectrum. The party initially focused on drawing support from former People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) voters who felt the VVD had grown too soft on the policy areas of European Union and immigration, but saw Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) as too hardline, and tried recruiting candidates who came from professional rather than political backgrounds. During its early years, the FvD was also described as one of several contemporary conservative-populist parties in the Netherlands that have been inspired by or inherited the mantle of the defunct Pim Fortuyn List.\nOn its official platform, the FvD declares itself to be a movement rather than a party with a focus on protecting Dutch sovereignty, identity, and cultural and intellectual property. The party wants stricter immigration and integration policies, calling for the protection of high culture and \"Judeo-Christian values\". The FvD is also opposed to the integration of the European Union which it claims will lead to eventual Eurofederalism and supports a referendum on Dutch membership of EU.\nAfter establishing itself, the FvD and its platform was perceived by political commentators as a standard Eurosceptic and national populist political party. It was variously described as ideologically national conservative, Hard Eurosceptic, and right-wing populist. In a 2019 column for the Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad, historian and philosopher Jozef Waanders described the FvD at the time as containing various ideological factions with strands of libertarianism and moderate conservatism, including members sympathetic to the ideas of Ayn Rand and Michel Houellebecq. Both party spokespeople and outside observers dismissed labelling the FvD as a far-right party at the time of its foundation, but various political commentators in the Netherlands and abroad have since described the party as moving towards the far-right of the spectrum. The FvD has also been accused of drawing links with the alt-right movement with NRC Handelsblad alleging the FvD was attempting to cultivate popularity among the alt-right in 2017, although the party did not identify itself as such at the time.\nIn 2019, political commentators and authors began to describe the FvD as moving further to the right of the PVV following the departure of several of its founding members and adoption of more radical political stances. By 2020, observers argued that Baudet and the FvD had undergone an ideological shift and adopted rhetoric deemed far-right. Since 2022, commentators have described the party's current program as neo-fascist. Ahead of the 2024 European Parliament election, the FvD was claimed to be an extreme-right party by journalist Jon Henley and Cas Mudde, who differentiated the FvD from national-populist parties such as the PVV, French National Rally and Vox in Spain since these parties do not reject democracy, while the FvD has promoted conspiracy theories and called for the creation of a “countersociety.” The FvD has also been compared to the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party whereby both the AfD and FvD started out as conservative and standard Eurosceptic movements but subsequently followed an opposite trend to other European populist parties that have moderated themselves by moving in a more hardline direction since the early 2020s and containing representatives who openly express statements considered extreme.\nDomestic policy\nOne of the major issues FvD campaigns against is the perceived existence of a \"party cartel\" in which the main ruling parties of the country divide power among themselves and work towards the same goals despite claiming to be competitors. The party promises direct democracy through binding referendums as well as directly elected mayors and a directly elected Prime Minister. The party is also in favor of the government consisting of apolitical experts in their respective fields (\"technocracy\"), and top civil servants having to reapply for their positions whenever a new cabinet is formed.\nSociety and culture\nFvD supports high culture. It argues for the protection of Dutch culture and \"European classical music, art and knowledge.\" It is critical of modern architecture, calling for both new government buildings to be constructed in a neoclassical style and for city planning that \"fits within a historical view.\" FvD also supports the establishment of a commission to protect historic monuments from destruction, wants Frysk to be retained as a second state language, calls for schools to teach about \"beautiful things that the West has produced\" and supports free museum admission for all Dutch citizens. However, the party has also promoted plans to defund and privatize the Nederlandse Publieke Omroep, a Dutch public broadcasting organization.\nSocial issues\nHistorically the party has argued for equal treatment of people of different sexual orientations and was more supportive of gay rights, although it now calls for the protection of children against what it describes as \"woke and LGBT propaganda\" and supports prohibiting minors from being in Pride parades and taking hormone therapy. The FvD's current platform also calls for an end to the promotion of LGBT campaigns by government institutions, for a ban on \"transgender propaganda\" targeting minors and opposes flying Pride flags from government buildings. FvD has spoken out against feminism and has promoted traditional gender roles such as that of the \"masculine man that supports his family\". The FvD also supports a retraction for all apologies made by Dutch governments for Dutch colonial history.\nOn abortion, the FvD supported the current Dutch laws regarding abortion until 2019 and held a generally moderate voting record on the matter until a 2022 debate when it took a more socially conservative stance by referring to abortion as \"inhumane\" and argued the abortion limit should be reduced from 24 to 18 weeks and that it should only be possible in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother's life.\nCriminal justice\nThe party calls for a reform of the Dutch justice system, increased funding for the Dutch police force, tougher penalties against those convicted of violent crimes and where possible for non-naturalized immigrants found guilty of serious crimes to be deported and tried in their country of origin. FvD also supports deleting Articles 93 and 94 from the Dutch constitution which enables international law to take precedence above national law in some cases.\nFvD calls for a gradual legalization of soft drugs but also supports reducing the number of cannabis coffee shops within the vicinity of schools.\nImmigration\nThe FvD has adopted a nationalist viewpoint in which the Dutch culture should be protected and presently argues for mass and incentivized remigration of foreign nationals from the Netherlands. The party calls for a ten year freeze on issuing Dutch citizenship and residency and for Dutch withdrawal from international migration treaties.\nIn its initial 2017 platform, the party favoured reinstating border controls and ending what it perceives as mass immigration, instead calling for a points based system for skilled immigration. It also supported an end to the Schengen agreement and for Dutch borders to be monitored with digital and biometric technology. It also campaigned against unchecked immigration and said it would introduce a Dutch Values Protection Act. In 2018, the party said that it supported freedom of religion and called for equal treatment of all citizens regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation, but expressed opposition to any further influence of Islamic culture on Dutch society, supports a crackdown on forced or child marriages and wants to ban Islamic face veils and other face coverings. The FvD also opposes foreign funding of Islamic schools and institutions, and argues that all schools in the Netherlands should subscribe to \"Judeo-Christian values.\" FvD also states that immigrants who do not wish to integrate should be offered incentives to return to their native country and that whenever possible asylum seekers should be processed off Dutch soil. The party also supports withdrawing the Netherlands from the UN 1951 Refugee Convention and expanding the Royal Marechaussee to patrol Dutch borders.\nThe FvD has gradually hardened some of its rhetoric on immigration, with party leader Baudet arguing that he does not want Europe to \"Africanize.\" In 2024, Baudet and the FvD advocated for mass remigration in order to maintain a \"white Europe\". Baudet and the party have also criticised the immigration policies of Geert Wilders and the PVV as being too liberal. During a speech in Belgium, Baudet said \"You have to organize mass remigration, because there are already far too many people here.\"\nIn 2024, the party tabled a motion in the House of Representatives to reverse the \"demographic process in which the original population of our country is being displaced by immigrants\" by offering financial incentives for remigration. The party is also opposed to resettling Gazan refugees in the Netherlands according to a motion tabled by FvD MP Gideon van Meijeren.\nEconomy\nFvD in the economic field supports economic liberalism. The party is a proponent of the introduction of a high tax-free bracket for everyone, the abolition of taxes on gifts and inheritance and a radical simplification of tax brackets. The party is a proponent of drastic changes in elementary and secondary education, focusing on performance evaluations for teachers. It wants to expand the armed forces, expanding the National Reserve Corps and reverting defense budget cuts.\nEnvironment\nThe party calls for a reduction in the use of plastic, more support for the agricultural economy, sustainable farming and tougher laws against animal cruelty. In the spring of 2019, the party, endorsing a climate change denialist platform, intensively campaigned against large state investments in renewable energy, leading to a victory in the provincial elections. Later that year, it also supported protests by Dutch farmers against enforcing legislation on nitrogen emissions.\nForeign policy\nInternational relations\nThe FvD's initial foreign policy stances aligned to Atlanticism and pro-Western positions before moving to a more neutral attitude with the party claiming \"there are no friends or enemies\" in foreign policy and arguing Dutch interests must come first. In 2022, party leader Baudet claimed that NATO expansion, EU \"colour revolutions\" in post-Soviet states and the Arab Spring were all part of an ambition by the United States to achieve global regime change. The FvD supports strengthening ties with BRICS countries and for an end to Dutch sanctions on Russia.\nDefence\nEarly on, FvD held a more pro-NATO stance but has since shifting to blaming NATO countries for the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War and since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has openly supported the Russian view of the conflict, with the party's current platform calling the invasion a \"stupid NATO war against Russia.\" The party's original co-founder Henk Otten has criticised the FvD's stance on Russia and called Baudet a \"Manchurian candidate\" of Putin. Baudet has supported Dutch withdrawal from NATO. The FvD program currently calls for the Netherlands to \"reconsider Dutch NATO membership\" by holding a referendum on the matter and supports raising the defense budget once the Netherlands withdraws support for Ukraine. The FvD is alleged to have been among European parties who received funding from Russia to influence political debates according to a leaked report by the Czech intelligence service in 2024, although this was denied by Baudet who claimed the allegations were a \"witch hunt\" against the party.\nMiddle East\nInitially, the FvD held a strongly pro-Israel attitude towards the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Baudet stated in 2017 that the FvD supported Israel \"unconditionally\" by considering the country a democratic ally. However, the party began criticizing both sides following the start of the Gaza war and has become more critical of Israel's role with Baudet praising the pro-Palestinian DENK's stance on the conflict. In March 2024, Baudet and DENK's Stephan van Baarle were the only two parliamentary leaders in the House of Representatives to abstain on supporting a statement against antisemitism. Baudet has described Israeli actions as \"ethnic cleansing\" and suggested that Israel was planning to make money by selling new housing developments in the Gaza Strip.\nIn 2024, Baudet expressed criticism of other European nationalist parties such as the PVV, Vlaams Belang, Lega and the Sweden Democrats for holding pro-Israel stances and supporting Ukraine and claimed that they consider \"Israel more important than Europe.\"\nEuropean Union\nThe party states that it supports protecting European civilization and wants free trade between European nations and the world but is opposed to the European Union (EU) and the Eurozone. The party calls for an immediate end to EU enlargement and for the Netherlands to use every veto possible to prevent the EU from becoming a federal superstate. It also supports referendums and Dutch withdrawal from the Eurozone and the Schengen Agreement. FvD also wants a renegotiation of Dutch membership of the EU followed by a binding referendum on EU membership and an \"intelligent exit\" (Nexit) from the EU if it cannot be reformed and terms cannot be met.\nNetherlands\nThe party leader Thierry Baudet supported the idea of the Greater Netherlands, claiming that Flanders \"actually just belongs to us\".\nElectoral performance\nHouse of Representatives\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!

It intended to participate in the June 2024 European Parliament election in Belgium's Dutch-speaking electoral college, but the party did not manage to collect the required amount of signatures.\nInternational affiliations\nIn the European Parliament, the FvD initially sat with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) after being admitted into the group following the 2019 European Parliament election in the Netherlands. During this time, the FvD maintained relations and dialogue with fellow ECR member parties the Sweden Democrats, Flemish N-VA, Poland's Law and Justice and the British Conservative Party.\nFollowing a split in the FvD in 2020, its former MEP's defected to JA21 party and joined European Conservatives and Reformists Party. FvD subsequently left the European Conservatives and Reformists Party and was affiliated with the Identity and Democracy (ID) political group with the French National Rally, Vlaams Belang, Danish People's Party, Italian Lega and the Austrian FPO for a short period in 2022. The FvD was later suspended from the ID in October 2022 and later quit the group after accusing ID of being anti-Russian. In 2024, the FvD lost its European Parliament representation, after its MEP had sat as a Non-Inscrit. It joined the newly established Europe of Sovereign Nations party in 2024 led by Alternative for Germany. The FvD also has contacts with the Hungarian Our Homeland Movement, Moldovan Renastere, Republic Movement of Slovakia, the Serbian Party Oathkeepers and Alternative for Sweden, as well as Sanseitō of Japan.\nAlleged ties to Russia\nThe FvD has also been criticized for alleged financial and political ties to Vladimir Putin with Dutch television show Zembla claiming to have unearthed WhatsApp communications between the party and someone Baudet describes as a Kremlin official. Baudet claimed the messages were a \"playful exaggeration.\" Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the FvD's leadership have been condemned by both former party members and other Dutch political parties for supporting the invasion, taking an overtly pro-Putin stance and blaming the West for the war.
