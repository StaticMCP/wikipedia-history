During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as the Oscars) in 23 categories honoring the films released in 1994. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gilbert Cates and directed by Jeff Margolis. Comedian David Letterman hosted the show for the first time. Three weeks earlier in a ceremony held at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California on March 4, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Jamie Lee Curtis.\nForrest Gump won six awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included Ed Wood, The Lion King, and Speed with two awards and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert; Blue Sky, ''Bob's Birthday, Bullets Over Broadway, Burnt by the Sun, Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life, Legends of the Fall, The Madness of King George, Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision, Pulp Fiction, A Time for Justice, and Trevor with one. The telecast garnered more than 48 million viewers in the United States, making it the most watched Oscars telecast since the 55th Academy Awards in 1983.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominees for the 67th Academy Awards were announced on February 14, 1995, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Arthur Hiller, the then-president of the Academy, and actress Angela Bassett. Forrest Gump'' earned the most nominations with thirteen. It was the most nominated film since 1966's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and the fifth film to earn that many nominations. Bullets Over Broadway, Pulp Fiction, and The Shawshank Redemption tied for second with seven each.\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 27, 1995. For only the second time in Oscar history, three of the four acting winners were previous winners. The 11th ceremony held in 1939 previously accomplished this feat. Best Actor winner Tom Hanks became the fifth performer to win consecutive acting Oscars and the second person to do so in the aforementioned category since Spencer Tracy won for his performances in Captains Courageous (1937) and Boys Town'' (1938). He also was the sixth person to win Best Actor twice. Best Supporting Actress winner Dianne Wiest became the first person to win two acting Oscars for performances in films directed by the same person. She first won in that same category for her role in Woody Allen's 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters. ''Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life and Trevors joint win in the Best Live Action Short category marked the fifth occurrence of a tie in Oscar history; the next tie would occur at the 85th Academy Awards in 2013.\nAwards\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{| class=wikitable\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Forrest Gump&nbsp;– Wendy Finerman, Steve Tisch and Steve Starkey, producers'\n** Four Weddings and a Funeral&nbsp;– Duncan Kenworthy, producer\n** Pulp Fiction&nbsp;– Lawrence Bender, producer\n** Quiz Show&nbsp;– Robert Redford, Michael Jacobs, Julian Krainin, and Michael Nozik, producers\n** The Shawshank Redemption&nbsp;– Niki Marvin, producer\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Robert Zemeckis&nbsp;– Forrest Gump'\n** Woody Allen&nbsp;– Bullets Over Broadway\n** Quentin Tarantino&nbsp;– Pulp Fiction\n** Robert Redford&nbsp;– Quiz Show\n** Krzysztof Kieślowski&nbsp;– Three Colours: Red\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Tom Hanks&nbsp;– Forrest Gump as Forrest Gump'\n** Morgan Freeman&nbsp;– The Shawshank Redemption as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding\n** Nigel Hawthorne&nbsp;– The Madness of King George as King George III\n** Paul Newman&nbsp;– Nobody's Fool as Donald \"Sully\" Sullivan\n** John Travolta&nbsp;– Pulp Fiction as Vincent Vega\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Jessica Lange&nbsp;– Blue Sky as Carly Marshall'\n** Jodie Foster&nbsp;– Nell as Nell Kellty\n** Miranda Richardson&nbsp;– Tom & Viv as Vivienne Haigh-Wood\n** Winona Ryder&nbsp;– Little Women as Josephine \"Jo\" March\n** Susan Sarandon&nbsp;– The Client as Regina \"Reggie\" Love\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Martin Landau&nbsp;– Ed Wood as Bela Lugosi'\n** Samuel L.

In addition, her Comic Relief co-host and veteran Oscar emcee Billy Crystal declined to host the show citing his commitment to his film Forget Paris which he directed, wrote, starred in, and produced. Producer Gil Cates hired actor, comedian, and Late Show host David Letterman as host of the 1995 ceremony. Cates explained his decision to hire the late-night talk show host saying, \"He's punctual, he's well groomed, and he knows how to keep an audience awake.\" ABC entertainment president Ted Harbert also approved of the choice stating, \"If Dave likes the experience, this could be a great answer for the show, just the way Johnny Carson did the show for many years.\"\nAs with previous ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show on a theme. This year, he christened the show with the theme \"Comedy and the Movies\" commenting \"This year, because of the earthquakes and floods and Bosnia and Rwanda, it was a (terrible) year, and therefore seemed a great year to celebrate what movies can really give us, which is an opportunity to go for two hours in the dark and laugh together. Even with television, it's not a community experience unless you have a very big family. So it's unique to movies and theater, and it's this very human thing.\" In tandem with the theme, the ceremony's opening number featured a montage produced by Chuck Workman featuring scenes of humorous moments from a variety of both comedic and non-comedic films projected on a large screen on the stage. During that segment, actors Tim Curry, Kathy Najimy, and Mara Wilson performed a modified version of the song \"Make 'Em Laugh\" from the film ''Singin' in the Rain, using blue screen technology to make it appear that they were jumping in and out of the montage on the screen. Several collections of film clips were shown throughout the broadcast highlighting various aspects of comedy such as troupes and dialogue.\nSeveral other people were also involved with the production of the ceremony. Bill Conti served as musical director and conductor for the event. Production designer Roy Christopher designed a new stage for the ceremony which prominently featured a proscenium which was designed to resemble the iris of a camera. Moreover, Christopher commented that the iris motif was inspired by the iris shot prominently featured in several comedic films and shorts. Dancer Debbie Allen choreographed The Lion King'' musical number. Actors Alec Baldwin, Jack Lemmon, Steve Martin, and Rosie O'Donnell participated in a pre-taped comedic sketch lampooning auditions for a role in Cabin Boy, the film in which Letterman made his film acting debut.\nBox office performance of nominees\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 14, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $468 million, with an average of $93.6 million per film. Forrest Gump was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $300 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by Pulp Fiction ($76 million), Four Weddings and a Funeral ($52 million), Quiz Show ($21 million) and The Shawshank Redemption ($16 million).\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 44 nominations went to 14 films on the list. Only Forrest Gump (2nd), The Client (12th), Pulp Fiction (14th), Four Weddings and a Funeral (20th), and Nell (41st) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were The Lion King (1st), True Lies (3rd), Clear and Present Danger (6th), Speed (7th), The Mask (8th), Interview with the Vampire (10th), Maverick (11th), Legends of the Fall (27th) and Little Women (31st).\nCritical reception\nThe show received a negative reception from most media publications. John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote, \"Instead of keeping things moving smartly, Mr. Letterman stuck with his late-night shtick, too often leaving the show's pacing in shambles.\" He also added, \"Within the show's first half-hour, with no strong hand at the helm, the audience simply sagged. Applause died long before most winners even reached the podium.\" Television critic John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented, \"Last night on ABC, no one got it. Hollywood's big event was wonderfully littered by technical errors, bad taste, low comedy and lower necklines.\" Moreover, he remarked, \"Letterman, the rookie host, was off his game in his opening monologue. Maybe it was the big auditorium. Or a billion people in the television audience.\" Film critic Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer quipped, \"Not only was he not witty or funny, he never knew when to let bad enough alone.\" He concluded, \"As the evening dragged on, it became obvious that Mr. Letterman had no gift for ad-libbing through the few unpredictable opportunities in a 'live' event like the Oscars.\" People named the ceremony as one of the worst television broadcasts of 1995, summarizing it as follows: \"a cranky skeptic visits the high temple of show business, mocks the gold-plated statuary and displays insufficient reverence for the gods. (Tom Hanks assisting with a stupid pet trick?!) We know who the winner wasn't.\"\nSome media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Television critic Joyce Millman of The San Francisco Examiner noted, \"In his first stint as host of the Oscar telecast, David Letterman did the impossible—he made something entertaining from what is traditionally the most boring three hours of TV this side of a test pattern.\" The Buffalo News columnist Alan Pergament praised Letterman's performance as host writing \"David Letterman was a box full of chocolates on an Oscar night that was empty of much emotion until the expected Forrest Gump sweep in the final 15 minutes.\" He also added that despite a lack of surprises amongst the awards, the emotional and unexpected humorous moments provided depth and entertainment throughout the evening. Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel gave an average review of the ceremony but singled out Letterman noting that he \"proved Monday night that he's among Oscar's Top 10 Hosts. He's definitely at the top of the list with Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal and Bob Hope.\"\nRatings and reception\nThe American telecast on ABC drew an average of 48.28 million people over its length, which was a 7% increase from the previous year's ceremony. An estimated 81 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 32.5% of households watching over a 53 share. It also drew a higher 18–49 demographic rating with a 21.7 rating among viewers in that demographic. It was the most watched Oscars telecast since the 55th ceremony held in 1983.\nIn July 1995, the ceremony presentation received six nominations at the 47th Primetime Emmys. Two months later, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Jeff Margolis's direction of the telecast.\n\"In Memoriam\"\nThe annual \"In Memoriam\" tribute, presented by actress Sigourney Weaver, honored the following people:\n* Fernando Rey\n* Cameron Mitchell\n* Barry Sullivan\n* Giulietta Masina\n* Peter Cushing\n* Frank Wells – Executive\n* Noah Beery Jr.\n* Woody Strode\n* Jessica Tandy\n* Tom Ewell\n* Lionel Stander\n* Jule Styne – Composer\n* Walter Lantz – Animator\n* Arthur Krim – Executive\n* Ferdinando Scarfiotti – Art Director\n* Robert Bolt – Screenwriter\n* Donald Pleasence\n* Harry Saltzman – Producer\n* Terence Young – Director\n* Burt Lancaster\n* Henry Mancini – Composer\n* Martha Raye\n* George Peppard\n* Gilbert Roland\n* Rossano Brazzi\n* Cabell 'Cab' Calloway\n* Mildred Natwick\n* Macdonald Carey\n* David Wayne\n* Raul Julia\nSee also\n* 1st Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 15th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 37th Grammy Awards\n* 47th Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 48th British Academy Film Awards\n* 49th Tony Awards\n* 52nd Golden Globe Awards\n* American Express Gold card dress of Lizzy Gardiner\n* List of submissions to the 67th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nNotes\nExternal links\nOfficial websites\n* [http://www.oscar.com/ Academy Awards Official website]\n* [http://www.oscars.org/ The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Official website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/oscars Oscar's Channel]  at YouTube (run by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences)\nAnalysis\n* [http://www.filmsite.org/aa94.html 1994 Academy Awards Winners and History]  Filmsite\n* [https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000003/1995 Academy Awards, USA: 1995]  Internet Movie Database\nOther resources\n*"
