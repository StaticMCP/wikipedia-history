It enables all parking apps that support the system: RingGo, JustPark and PayByPhone, to work at all participating car parks. It has been rolled out in 10 local authorities so far. It was first developed by the Department for Transport starting in 2019, and since May 2025 is controlled by the British Parking Association on a not-for-profit basis.\nParticipating Local Authorities\n* Manchester City\n* Liverpool City\n* Cheshire West and Chester\n* Walsall\n* Coventry City\n* Peterborough City\n* East Suffolk\n* Oxfordshire County\n* Buckinghamshire\n* Sutton\nSee also\n* Parking (Code of Practice) Act 2019\n* [https://www.britishparking.co.uk/national-parking-platform British Parking Association - National Parking Platform]\nReferences"
