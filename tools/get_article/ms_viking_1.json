She operated this route in Viking Line colours between 1970 and 1982.\nThe Viking 1 was later known by the names Wasa Express, Khalid 1, Mecca 1, Al Hussein II, Al-Quamar Al-Saudi Al-Misri 1, Mecca 1, Al-Quamar Al-Saudi II and Fagr. As the Fagr, the ship capsized in a storm in the Red Sea on 19 April 2000. The wreck was salvaged and scrapped in October 2002.\nReferences"
