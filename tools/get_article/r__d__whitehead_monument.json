D. Whitehead Monument is a public artwork by Norwegian born American artist Sigvald Asbjornsen located on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. The artwork consists of a bronze-relief plaque depicting a dog and horse, set on a granite pillar, which is in turn part of a fountain.\nDescription\nThe R. D. Whitehead Monument, also known as the Horse and Dog Fountain and the Whitehead Memorial Fountain, was originally a watering trough, located in Milwaukee's South Side, that was converted into a fountain in 1966. There is a granite pillar rising from the fountain on which there is a bronze bas-relief. The bronze depicts a horse and a dog, both in profile. There are several inscriptions on the sculpture:\nThe bottom of the relief reads: DANDY GEORGE\nThe front of the pillar's base reads:\n:ERECTED BY\n:R. D. WHITEHEAD\nThe rear of the pillar's base reads:\n:ERECTED BY R. D. WHITEHEAD SUPT.\n:THE BADGER STATE HUMANE SOCIETY\n:IN REMEMBRANCE OF MY FAITHFUL FRIENDS\n:HORSE, GEORGE\n:DOGS, JIM, FLORA, DANDY, PET\n:PUNCH, JUDY & SHORTY\n:CATS, FRANK & HENRY\n:BIRDS, BROWNEY & DICK\nA plaque affixed to the rear of the base reads:\n:R. D. WHITEHEAD MONUMENT\n:ORIGINALLY A HORSE WATERING TROUGH\n:ERECTED IN 1910\n:RESTORED AS A FOUNTAIN IN 1966\n:BY THE MAYOR'S BEAUTIFICATION COMMITTEE\n:DESIGNATED A MILWAUKEE LANDMARK IN 1974\n:IN RECOGNITION OF ITS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE TO THE COMMUNITY\nHistorical information\nRichard D. Whitehead was appointed by the Humane Society as superintendent of the Wisconsin Humane Society in 1879, a position he filled for more than 25 years. The position called for Whitehead to investigate the cases of animal and child abuse referred to the organization. He grew up on a farm in Ohio and worked in a livery stable in Chicago, both experiences which made him aware of the mistreatment suffered by animals. Whitehead investigated more than 700 cases over the course of his career. These sometimes required that he exercise \"his police powers in an effort to prevent further abuse\". Whitehead left the Wisconsin Humane Society in 1906 and formed the short-lived Badger State Humane Society. Upon his retirement, he erected the R. D. Whitehead Memorial watering trough at as a memorial to all his faithful animals.\nAt the time that the R. D. Whitehead Memorial was completed, watering troughs were found at many intersections around Milwaukee. \"This trough was particularly welcomed by horses that pulled wagonloads of produce to the Farmer's Market nearby on South 16th Street.\" It is the last watering trough left in the city of Milwaukee and became a City of Milwaukee Landmark in 1964. The trough was eventually turned into a water fountain in 1966. The animals depicted in the bas-relief, George the horse and Dandy the dog, were both animal friends of R. D. Whitehead. The animals listed on the plaque on the back of the monument are all animals the donor loved.\nArtist\nCondition\nIn a survey conducted in April 1993, the sculpture was found to need treatment.\nSee also\n*Animalier\n*Henry Bergh (sculpture)\nReferences"
