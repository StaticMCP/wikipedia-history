The album was created as a celebration of the band's 35th anniversary and compiles 35 songs personally chosen by Dave Mustaine from throughout the band's career.\nBackground\nMustaine selected and compiled 35 tracks, choosing at least one track from each of the band's fifteen studio albums. He stated, \"I see these songs as the most efficient weapons in the band's arsenal...These tracks were created for maximum destruction.\"\nThe album was released as 3-CD and 4-LP vinyl editions, as well as a 4-LP vinyl edition on silver-colored vinyl. Both versions feature the same track listing.\nCritical reception\nWarheads on Foreheads was generally well received by critics. In a review for AllMusic, Fred Thomas writes that Warheads on Foreheads feels \"more like an anthology than a greatest-hits collection\", showing resilience and consistency throughout critically successful and fan-favorite albums alike.\nTrack listing\nAdapted from CD metadata.\nPersonnel\nMegadeth\n*Dave Mustaine - guitars, lead vocals (all tracks)\n*Kiko Loureiro - guitars (tracks 33-35)\n*David Ellefson - bass, backing vocals (tracks 1-26, 30-35)\nMegadeth alumni\n*Chris Poland - guitars (tracks 1-7, 27)\n*Jeff Young - guitars (tracks 8 and 9)\n*Marty Friedman - guitars (tracks 10-25)\n*Gar Samuelson - drums (tracks 1-7)\n*Chuck Behler - drums (tracks 8 and 9)\n*Nick Menza - drums (tracks 10-22)\n*Jimmy DeGrasso - drums (tracks 25 and 26)\n*Al Pitrelli - guitars (track 26)\n*James LoMenzo - bass (tracks 28 and 29)\n*Shawn Drover - drums (tracks 28-31)\n*Glen Drover - guitars (track 28)\n*Chris Broderick - guitars (track 29-31)\nSession musicians\n*Jimmie Lee Sloas - bass (track 27)\n*Vinnie Colaiuta - drums (track 27)\n*Chris Adler - drums (tracks 33-35)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums Chart (Oricon)\n|align=\"center\"|84\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
