It was produced and directed by George Mendeluk and co-produced by John Ryan from a screenplay by Richard Murphy, based on Charles Templeton's 1974 novel of the same name. The original music is by Nash the Slash and Paul Zaza and the cinematography by Mike Molloy. The film was made by Presidential Films and Sefel Films and distributed by Crown International Pictures.\nPlot\nDuring a state visit to Canada, President Adam Scott is warned by Secret Service agent Jerry O'Connor about a potential threat to his life. Scott ignores O'Connor's warning and is consequently abducted (while walking through Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto) by South American terrorist Roberto Assanti and his female accomplice. They demand $100 million in diamonds along with two airplanes as ransom for the president's safe return.\nWhile Scott is being held captive in an armored truck booby-trap with high explosives timed to detonate at midnight, O'Connor must find a way into the truck to rescue him before that happens, while also contending with a turf war between various U.S. federal law enforcement agencies and the political ambitions of the U.S. vice president, Ethan Richards.\nAgent O'Connor eventually gets one of Assanti's terrorist group members to turn on Assanti, which caused Assanti's sister to die. O'Connor learns Assanti's plan for the president and develops a plan to save the President by going through the engine and firewall with a cutting torch.\nCast\n* William Shatner as Secret Service Agent Jerry O'Connor\n* Hal Holbrook as President Adam Scott\n* Van Johnson as Vice President Ethan Richards\n* Ava Gardner as Second Lady Beth Richards\n* Miguel Fernandes as Roberto Assanti\n* Cindy Girling as Linda Steiner\n* Elizabeth Shepherd as First Lady Joan Scott\n* Michael J.

The primary difference between the two is the story's location. The book sets the kidnapping in New York City's Herald Square and the subsequent siege in nearby Times Square. In the movie, the kidnapping occurs in Templeton's home city, Toronto, with the mob, chase, and explosion scenes commencing in Nathan Phillips Square.\nAlthough the novel and the film have their differences, senior feature writer at The Globe and Mail Stephen Godfrey found \"the film is as easy to 'read' as the book apparently was. The inevitable cross-cutting, from fanatical terrorists to the presidential cavalcade, and later, from a nearly unflappable security man (William Shatner) in Toronto, is well handed.\"\nCritical reception\nThe film received lukewarm ratings overall. It received a lot of talk from the New York Post and the Newark Star Ledger as well as outstanding reviews from Bergen Records and other newspaper organizations.\nJanet Maslin, from The New York Times, thought the plot was not fresh enough to be frightening and the characters were not brave enough to do anything new.\nChris Lowry, a writer for Film Reviews, found George Mendeluk's directing uninspiring and Richard Murphy's screenplay mediocre for an action movie. Lowry stated, \"the film disorients and disturbs the audience at the outset\" since the subject of kidnapping a president isn't a funny concept in general. He expected the editing to be better as well since the readers of the novel were aware that the setting is different in the film compared to the novel.\nAward nominations\nThe film received two nominations in the 1981 Genie Awards.\nBest Achievement in Film Editing - Michael MacLaverty\nBest Achievement in Overall Sound - Mike Hoogenboom, Douglas Ganton, and Nolan Roberts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
