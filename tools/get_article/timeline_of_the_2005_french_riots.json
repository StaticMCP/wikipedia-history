The extent table in the main article does the opposite.\nFirst week\n* Thursday, October 27 – 1st night of rioting\n** Gangs, mostly consisting of hundreds of youths, clashed with police, throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at police forces and firefighters, setting cars on fire, and vandalizing buildings.

Police denied responsibility but acknowledged that it was the same type used by French riot police. Speaking to 170 police officers at Seine-Saint-Denis prefecture in Bobigny (the local authority overseeing Clichy-sous-Bois), Nicolas Sarkozy said, \"I am, of course, available to the Imam of the Clichy mosque to let him have all the details in order to understand how and why a tear gas bomb was sent into this mosque.\" Eyewitnesses also reported that police called women emerging from the mosque \"whores\" and other names.\n* Monday, 31 October – 5th night of rioting\n** It was reported that the rioting had spread to other parts of Seine-Saint-Denis.

French insurers estimate that damage claims alone will reach 200m euros.\n**Night – 18th night of rioting\n***Some 284 vehicles were burned on Sunday night, down from a peak of over 1,000 a week earlier. 115 people were detained overnight.\n* Monday 14 November\n** Day\n***The French government issues a proposal to extend the State of Emergency for three months.\n***French President Jacques Chirac has pledged to create opportunities for young people in an effort to prevent any resurgence of urban violence. In his first major speech since rioting began, M. Chirac spoke of a \"crisis of meaning, a crisis of identity\". He condemned the \"poison\" of racism, and announced measures for the training of 50,000 youths in 2007. Speaking at the Elysee Palace in front of the flags of France and the EU, M. Chirac said the wave of violence had highlighted a \"deep malaise\" within French society. \"We are all aware of discrimination\", the president said, calling for equal opportunities for the young and rejecting suggestions of a US-style quota system.\n***Many residents in poor neighborhoods hit by crime, high unemployment and a lack of prospects do not expect the government's plans to bear much fruit. \"Nothing will change\", Henri-Anne Dzerahovic, 61, said in the bleak Clichy-Sous-Bois suburb in the northeast of Paris. \"I'm moving out of here. I've had enough. Anywhere you go, you're afraid of being attacked. Any time. Not just in the past two weeks. It's an awful climate\", said Dzerahovic.\n**Night – 19th night of rioting\n***215 vehicles (60 of which in the Île-de-France) were set on fire and 71 people were detained overnight.\n* Tuesday 15 November\n**Day\n***The lower house of France's parliament has approved plans to extend special powers until 21 February 2006 to try to bring a wave of urban rioting under control. The emergency laws also need the approval of the Senate, which votes on the issue on Wednesday. Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy had told deputies France was facing one of its \"sharpest and most complex urban crises\", which required \"firmness\". He said most of those arrested in the riots were already known delinquents.\n**Night – 20th night of rioting\n***Violence subsided further, with 163 torched vehicles (27 of which in the Île-de-France) and 50 arrests. Only five communes had more than five cases of arson, among them Arras, Brest and Vitry-le-François with 11 each. In Romans-sur-Isère, a church was burnt in an arson attack. One policeman was injured in Pont-Evêque (Isère) as he was hit by a bottle filled with acid. Since 27 October, a total of 126 policemen were injured.\n* Wednesday 16 November\n**Day\n***The French parliament has approved a three-month extension of emergency laws aimed at curbing riots by urban youths. The Senate on Wednesday passed the extension – a day after a similar vote in the lower house. The laws allow local authorities to impose curfews, conduct house-to-house searches and ban public gatherings. The lower house passed them by a 346–148 majority, and the Senate by 202–125.\n***Senior officials from President Jacques Chirac's centre-right party have suggested that polygamy is one factor in the riots, arguing children of polygamous families have less of a father figure and are more likely to live in overcrowded conditions. \"Polygamy... prevents people being educated as they should be in an organised society. Tens of people cannot live in a single flat\", Bernard Accoyer, leader of the Union for a Popular Majority (UMP) in the National Assembly lower house of parliament, told French radio. Polygamy is illegal in France but until 1993, it was possible for immigrants to bring more than one wife from their home country to join them. (Note: Islam allows a man to have up to four wives at a time.)\nFourth week\n* Thursday 17 November\n**Day\n***French police say levels of violence in France have returned to \"normal\", following three weeks of unrest by urban youths across the country. Police said 98 vehicles were torched on Wednesday night, marking a \"return to a normal situation everywhere in France\". The police service said the figure of 98 cars burnt was in line with the nightly average before the trouble began on 27 October. Authorities in the Rhone region, which covers Lyon and nearby south-eastern towns, lifted a curfew on minors after just eight cars were destroyed overnight.\n***French Muslim leaders denounced on Thursday efforts to blame Muslims and Islam for recent riots in the country's rundown suburbs and said they saw worrying signs of growing prejudice against their faith here. Many young rioters may have been from Muslim backgrounds, but their violent outburst was a protest against unemployment, poor housing and other bias they faced because of their foreign origins, they told journalists. \"They didn't act like that because they're Muslims, but because of the misery they're living in\", said Kamel Kabtane, rector of the Grand Mosque of Lyon in eastern France. \"There weren't just Mohammads and Alis in those groups (of rioters) – there were Tonys and Daniels too\", said Dalil Boubakeur, the Paris Grand Mosque rector who is also head of France's official Muslim Council (CFCM).\n* Friday 18 November\n**Day\n***French Equal Opportunities Minister Azouz Begag has urged the government to overturn a ban on collecting data based on ethnicity or religion. Government bodies and private companies are barred from gathering such data – which is deemed potentially divisive. But M. Begag told Le Figaro newspaper it was important to assess the presence of minorities in various professions. Job discrimination was a key complaint voiced by many youths who rioted in immigrant suburbs in recent weeks. \"We need to see France's true colours\", M. Begag said. \"To do that, we need to measure the proportion of immigrant children among the police, magistrates, in the civil service as well as in the private sector.\"\nReferences"
