It elects councillors to Conwy Town Council and, until 2022, also elected representatives to Conwy County Borough Council.\nDescription\nThe Marl ward covers part of the town of Llandudno Junction to the east of the River Conwy. The wards of Deganwy and Pensarn border Marl, also to the east of the river. Conwy ward lies on the opposite side of the river, including the walled town of Conwy. To the north of Marl is the Llandudno ward of Penrhyn.\nThe county borough ward elected two councillors to Conwy County Borough Council.\nAccording to the 2011 UK Census the population of the Marl ward was 3,879.\nFollowing a ward boundary review, the county borough ward of Marl was merged with the neighbouring Pensarn (the most under-represented ward in the county borough) to create a new ward of Glyn y Marl. The new ward would elect three councillors to Conwy County Borough Council, from May 2022.\nCounty council elections\nThe ward elected two county councillors to Conwy County Borough Council and, at the May 2017 election, one seat was won by the Welsh Liberal Democrats and the other by the Welsh Labour Party. The Labour councillor, Mike Priestly, had previously represented the ward since 2004 as a Liberal Democrat. He had defected to the Labour Party in 2014 and, being a former trade union official, described it as \"coming back to my roots\". Local chiropodist Sue Shotter had won her seat from the Conservatives at a by-election in January 2011 and held it ever since.\n2017\n}}\n2012\n}}\n= sitting councillor prior to the election\n2011 by-election\nA by-election took place on Thursday 20 January 2011, after Conservative councillor Linda Hurr had stood down on health grounds.\nTown Council elections\nFor the purposes of elections to Conwy Town Council, Marl ward elects or co-opts a total of four town councillors.\nSee also\n* List of places in Conwy County Borough (categorised)\nReferences"
