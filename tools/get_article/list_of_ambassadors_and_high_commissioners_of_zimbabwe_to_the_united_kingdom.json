The position has the rank and status of an ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary and also serves as Zimbabwe's non-resident accredited Ambassador to Ireland.\nThe ambassador is currently Colonel Christian Katsande. Having been a High Commission since Zimbabwe's formal independence in 1980, on Zimbabwe's departure from the Commonwealth of Nations in 2003, the High Commission became an Embassy. Based in Zimbabwe House on the Strand, London, the embassy dates back to the establishment of the High Commission of Southern Rhodesia in 1924 after that colony was granted a limited form of self-government in 1923. The office later became the High Commission of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland from 1954 to 1963, the Southern Rhodesia High Commission from 1963 to 1965, and the Rhodesian Representative Office from 1965 to 1969. Between 2016 and 2018 the office was vacant, as the UK Government had rejected President Robert Mugabe's nominee, Ray Ndhlukula, for his role in the Mugabe government's land seizure program.\nOffice-holders\nHigh commissioners from Southern Rhodesia, 1924–53\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Incumbent!!Start of term!!End of term!!Notes\n|-\n| Sir Francis James Newton || 1924 || 1930 ||\n|-\n| John Wallace Downie || 1930 || 1935 ||\n|-\n| Stephen Martin Lanigan O'Keeffe || 1935 || 1946 ||\n|-\n| Kenneth MacKenzie Goodenough || 1946 || 1953 ||\n|}\nHigh commissioners from the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, 1954–63\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Incumbent!!Start of term!!End of term!!Notes\n|-\n|Sir Gilbert Rennie||May 1954||1961||\n|-\n|Sir Albert Robinson||1961||1963||\n|}\nHigh commissioners from Southern Rhodesia, 1963–1965\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Incumbent!!Start of term!!End of term!!Notes\n|-\n|Evan Campbell||1963||1965||\n|-\n|Andrew Skeen||22 July 1965||12 November 1965||\n|}\nRepresentative from Rhodesia, 1965–1969\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Incumbent!!Start of term!!End of term!!Notes\n|-\n|Sydney Frederick Brice||12 November 1965||15 July 1969||\n|}\nHigh commissioners from Zimbabwe, 1980–2003\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Incumbent!!Start of term!!End of term!!Notes\n|-\n|Robert Tatira Zwinoira||1980||1984||\n|-\n|Herbert Murerwa||1 March 1984||1990||\n|-\n|Stephen Chiketa||1991||1993||\n|-\n|Dr Ngoni Togarepi Chideya||1993||1999||\n|-\n|Simbarashe Mumbengegwi||1999||7 December 2003||\n|}\nAmbassadors from Zimbabwe, 2003–date\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Incumbent!!Start of term!!End of term!!Notes\n|-\n|Simbarashe Mumbengegwi||7 December 2003||2005||\n|-\n|Gabriel Machinga||2005||2016||\n|-\n|Vacant||2016||2018||\n|-\n|Christian Katsande||18 June 2018||date||\n|}\nSee also\n*United Kingdom–Zimbabwe relations\n*List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Zimbabwe\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.zimlondon.gov.zw/ Embassy of Zimbabwe to the United Kingdom and Ireland]"
