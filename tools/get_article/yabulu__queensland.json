The locality has the following railway stations on the North Coast line:\n* Purono railway station ()\n* Yabulu railway station()\nand one at the nickel refinery from which processed ore was carried to the Port of Townsville via the North Coast line\n*Cobarra railway station ()\nHistory\nYabulu is situated in the traditional Wulgurukaba Aboriginal country, nearby Nyawigi Aboriginal country.\nThe town takes its name from Yabulu railway station. Yabulu is an Aboriginal word meaning grass. Nickel laterite mining at Greenvale led to the building of the Greenvale railway line to transport ore to a nickel refinery at Yabulu in the 1970s.\nDemographics\nIn the , the suburb of Yabulu had a population of 697 people. 78.1% of people were born in Australia and 86.4% of people spoke only English at home.

The Yabulu refinery became operational in 1974 after completion of the Greenvale to Yabulu railway line. Mining at Greenvale took place between 1974 and 1992 during which nickel laterite ore was transported to the Yabulu refinery by rail and processed up until 1993. Importation of ore from mines in New Caledonia, Indonesia, and the Philippines began in 1986 and continues to this day.\nIn 2009, Palmer bought Queensland Nickel and the Palmer Nickel and Cobalt Refinery. The following year, the company increased production by 30%, prompting him to give $10&nbsp;million worth of Christmas bonuses to staff, including 55 Mercedes-Benz B-Class cars and overseas holidays. Up to 750 people worked at the refinery, which produced  of nickel and  of cobalt per year. According to the general manager Trefor Flood, this figure had risen to  of nickel per month by early 2010.\nWorld Wide Fund for Nature Australia (WWF) raised concerns that a tailings dam at the site could collapse during the wet season, posing an environmental threat to the Great Barrier Reef. WWF later retracted their comments, apologised and were forced to pay legal costs incurred by Palmer who sued WWF because of the comments. On 15 January 2016 the company terminated 237 workers. Palmer blamed poor nickel prices, at a 12-year low, and the refusal of the Queensland government to guarantee a loan of , but the ABC reported that Queensland Nickel had donated over $6 million to the Palmer United Party. The leader of the opposition in Queensland supported the government's refusal to guarantee the loan on the grounds that it was not the proper role of government and that Palmer had used Queensland Nickel funds for his political party. On 18 January 2016 Queensland Nickel entered voluntary administration. It is expected the refinery will re-open sometime in late 2018/2019 if all current hurdles to restarting are overcome.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Yabulu.
