It premiered on Mnet on June 13, 2023, airing every Tuesday at 22:00 KST. The show concluded on August 15, 2023.\nThe show serves as a spin-off series of Queendom, however it does not share a similar format with the previous seasons, only taking the name of the series.\nConcept and format\nOn January 26, 2023, it was announced that the Queendom series would have a third season, but would be different from the previous two seasons.\nThe show will focus on forming a global project girl group by taking members from currently active girl groups as well as solo female artists and piecing them together like a puzzle. It will take on a completely new format from the pre-existing Queendom series, with individual competitions taking place rather than team competition.\nOut of the initial 28 contestants, they will compete through performances to finally become a 7-member supergroup, El7z Up.\nPromotion and broadcast\nOn April 10, 2023, Mnet released the first teaser video on their YouTube channel. In the teaser, iconic girl group songs play in the background as well as the silhouettes of seven female celebrities are shown. Along with the confirmation that the first lineup will be revealed in May, the teaser includes the mysterious code on the bottom, \"IURP WZHQWB HLJKW WR VHYHQ\", which deciphers \"from twenty-eight to seven\".\nOn April 24, Mnet confirmed that Girls' Generation's Taeyeon will host the show. The first six contestants were also revealed, as well as Weeekly, and H1-KEY where its agency, GLG, confirmed two of their members' participation in the show.\nOn April 25, it was revealed that WJSN's Yeoreum would be a contestant in the show. On April 26, it was revealed that members Jiwon, Chaerin and Bora from Cherry Bullet would participate in the show.

In the teaser, silhouettes of the cast members are revealed as well as Taeyeon standing in the center.\nOn May 18, Mnet released teaser photos of the first 13 contestants in silhouettes, as well as two teams created, Pick on the top and Pick-Cat. The two teams also released two theme songs titled \"Charismatic\" and \"Snap\" respectively on the same day, accompanied by two performance videos shown on M Countdown. It was also shared that the rest of the contestants would be revealed the week after, and that they would be releasing and performing the same two songs on M Countdown in their own versions. On the same day, Lee Chae-yeon and Haein were reported to have withdrawn from the show. They would not be replaced and the show would continue with 26 contestants. On May 19, Mnet released individual teaser videos and posters previewing the first 13 contestants revealed.\nOn May 25, Mnet released a second set of teaser photos of the remaining 13 contestants in silhouettes, as well as the two teams, Drop The Beat & Athena.

In the event when there are already 14 contestants in one of the songs, the remaining contestants that have not chosen would be automatically allocated to the other song. Each song would consist of 2 teams: \"PICK\" and \"DROP\". After the contestants choose, in the Puzzle Room, Jiwon would form the 2 teams for \"Charismatic\", while Bora would form the 2 teams for \"Snap\".

The contestants under the winning team of each song would get a benefit of 10,000 points.\n* There would be 1 MVP for the winning team of each song, based on the selection of the expert panel.

After that, the contestants of the winning teams would be distributed, then followed by the contestants of the losing teams.
