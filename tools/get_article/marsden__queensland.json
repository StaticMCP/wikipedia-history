In the , Marsden had a population of 14,795 people.\nGeography\nLocated 4 km south of Logan Central and 24 km south of central Brisbane, most of the area has been developed into housing estates. Prior 1980, Marsden was divided between the Albert and Beaudesert Shires along Browns Plains Road, however, after the abolishment of Albert Shire in 1979; Marsden became entirely within Logan City. The suburb of Crestmead is the adjoining suburb to the south. The northern boundary of the suburb roughly runs parallel to the Logan Motorway. The industrial estate of Marsden is in the south-west of the suburb.\nHistory\nMarsden was originally part of Kingston, known as the Kingston Park Estate, until 1 May 1976, when the Council started to use the name Marsden.\nThe suburb was named after Violet Marsden, a member of a pioneer family, associated with the Kingston Park and Districts Progress Association.\nBetween the 1870s and the 1930s, the land was transferred, sold, and subdivided. The first house on the property was built in the 1930s by blacksmith and former Shire Chairman Martin Schneider, where the Marsden Park shopping centre is now located.\nIn 1944, part of Marsden was again subdivided, but into small farms; known as Kingston Park. These small farms were offered to ex-servicemen and post-war immigrants. By this time amenities in the suburb were extremely limited, with no cleared roads, no reticulated water system, and electricity was not supplied. Telephone and electricity services were installed in the late 1940s and retuclated water in the 1970s.\nIn January 1956, solicitors sought advice to the exact locations of planned roads for the suburb; a survey of the land was not issued until April 1956.\nIn 1967, the Kingston Park Progress Association transported an old shed from Sunnybank to Marsden Park and renovated it for a progress hall.\nMarsden State School opened on 23 January 1978.\nIn 1981, the Marsden Industrial Estate opened.\nThe Marsden Park Shopping Centre opened in 1985.
