Like the Medal \"For Courage\", its status was revised to prevent the medal from being given for years of service (a practice that was rampant in the USSR) rather than actual bravery during a battle. More than 5,210,000 medals were awarded between 1938 and 1991.\nNotable recipients\nAwarded by the Soviet Union\nSee also\n* Awards and decorations of the Soviet Union\nReferences\n* Great Soviet Encyclopedia\n* Kolesnikov G.A. & Rozhkov A.M., Orders and medals of USSR, Moscow, Mil. lib., 1983."
