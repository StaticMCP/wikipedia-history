Games are typically played on a relatively flat surface such as a dining table, bespoke gaming table, or an area of floor. The playing area is often decorated with models and materials representing buildings and terrain. Players take turns taking a range of actions with their models: moving, charging, shooting ranged weapons, fighting, and casting magical spells; the outcomes of which are generally determined by dice rolls. Besides the game itself, a large part of Age of Sigmar is dedicated to the hobby of collecting, assembling and painting the miniature figurines from the game.\nWhereas some wargames recreate historical warfare, Age of Sigmar has a fantasy theme heavily inspired by the fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien and Michael Moorcock. Players' armies fight with medieval-era weaponry and cast magical spells, and the warriors are a mixture of humans and fantasy creatures such as elves, dwarves, and orks.\nAge of Sigmar is the sequel to the game Warhammer (specifically Warhammer Fantasy Battle). Due to this, the game contains many of the same characters, themes, and models as its predecessor.\nEditions\nThe first edition of Age of Sigmar in 2015 replaced Warhammer Fantasy Battle. Another set released for the first edition was Spire of Dawn, which reused the High Elf and Skaven models from the Isle of Blood (Warhammer 8th edition starter set). The initial release of AoS did not include point values for individual units—these were added later—and instead imbalance was to be mitigated by number of models. If one side started the game with one-third more models than the other, the smaller side could choose a \"sudden death\" win condition for itself. Summoning new units used the same mechanics as spellcasting and required the dedication of reinforcement points for each summonable unit.\nThe initial release is notable for having included many absurd rules such as:Pride of the Reiksguard: Helborg’s skill is as legendary as his moustache is magnificent. You can re-roll any failed hit rolls when attacking with the Runefang so long as you have a bigger and more impressive moustache than your opponent.Escapist Magazine noted that such ridiculous rules could easily be exploited since nothing in the rules said the moustache had to be real and suggested players buy novelty moustaches to satisfy the condition. Other such rules included re-rolls for players pretending to ride and talk to an imaginary horse, screaming a guttural warcry, and keeping a straight face when their opponent tries to make them laugh. Some contemporary reviews were highly critical of such rules saying that while they may have been intended as jokes to encourage roleplaying, they opened up players to ridicule.\nThe second edition of AoS was released in 2018 following the Malign Portents event. It brought multiple significant changes to the rules, notably an overhaul of the summoning system, the elimination of reinforcement points, and the introduction of endless spells.\nThe third edition of AoS was released in June 2021, following the Broken Realms campaign series - in which the status quo of the setting was drastically altered. The new edition featured an overhaul of the Battalion system, objectives, and the introduction of a new Path to Glory narrative campaign.\nThe fourth edition of AoS was released in July 2024, following the Dawnbringer Crusade campaign. Taking place in Aqshy (the Realm of Fire), this edition sees the retirement of the Beastmen and Bonesplitterz factions.\nSetting\nAge of Sigmar is set in a universe known as the Mortal Realms, a collection of diverse realms each characterized by the eights winds of magic. The Mortal Realms were formed from the remnants of the \"World That Was,\" which was destroyed during the End Times of the Warhammer Fantasy universe. The realms are interconnected by magical portals known as Realmgates, allowing for travel and conflict between them.\nRealms:\n*Azyr: The Realm of Heaven, ruled by Sigmar, is characterized by its bright skies and celestial bodies. It is home to the Stormcast Eternals, elite warriors forged from the souls of the worthy to combat chaos.\n*Ghur: Known as the Realm of Beasts, Ghur is a wild and untamed land filled with primal beasts and savage tribes. Its landscapes range from dense jungles to vast plains, inhabited by feral tribes and monstrous creatures.\n*Aqshy: The Realm of Fire, dominated by volcanic landscapes and raging flames, is inhabited by factions that harness the destructive power of fire, including the Fire Slayers, a dwarf faction known for their fiery tempers and relentless pursuit of Ur-gold.\n*Ghyran: The Realm of Life is characterized by lush landscapes, vibrant flora, and the forces of nature. It is a place of regeneration and vitality, where the Sylvaneth protect the natural world from corruption.\n*Shyish: The Realm of Death is ruled by Nagash, the god of death. It is a land of eternal twilight, filled with tombs, spectral entities, and the undead, where Nagash's followers seek to expand his influence over the living.\n*Ulgu: Known as the Realm of Shadow, Ulgu is a place of darkness and illusion. The landscape is filled with twisted forests and shadowy terrains, where light struggles to penetrate. Its inhabitants often utilize deception and cunning tactics.\n*Hysh: The Realm of Light is characterized by enlightenment, wisdom, and knowledge. Its radiant landscapes are filled with brilliant colors and vibrant flora, where the Lumineth Realm-lords strive to preserve balance and promote order.\n*Chamon: The Realm of Metal is defined by its mineral wealth and magical properties. It is home to various factions that manipulate metal and earth magic, characterized by stunning landscapes filled with gleaming ores and intricate machinery.\nGameplay\nAge of Sigmar emphasises the narrative aspect of the wargaming experience, encouraging the play of story-driven scenarios, recreation of battles from lore, and player-created stories. The ruleset is designed to make the game easy to learn but hard to master. Basic rules of play are simple and quick to understand, but more advanced mechanics can be found in unit-specific \"Warscrolls\" that detail more rules and stats of the individual unit. The art of the game lies in understanding how your units work together and exploiting synergies to use them as a cohesive army. The rules and Warscrolls are free, and can be downloaded from the Games Workshop website or viewed in the Age of Sigmar app.\nFactions\nEach faction in Age of Sigmar is a part of one of four super-factions, called Grand Alliances. In the lore, factions within a Grand Alliance are generally united by common goals and aims. Conflict still occurs within Grand Alliances, however, as each faction will often have its own agenda that clashes with the agenda of other factions.\nIn early periods of Age of Sigmar - specifically First Edition - armies could be built from multiple factions within the same Alliance (e.g. Stormcast Eternals, Seraphon, and Sylvaneth), with an allegiance corresponding to that particular Grand Alliance but not to any of the individual factions. In more recent editions, armies are built mostly from individual factions (e.g. a Stormcast Eternals army) with an option to include a limited number of allies from related factions within the alliance (e.g. a Stormcast Eternals army with 200 points of Seraphon allies). An army consisting of Factions usually synergise best with their own units, and faction-specific armies receive bonuses and additional rules that are not available to mixed Grand Alliance armies.\nGrand alliance\nChaos\nThe Grand Alliance of Chaos is made up of factions that embrace the corrupting influence of the Chaos Gods. These factions revel in destruction, bloodshed, and the pursuit of power, often vying for dominance over one another.\n*Blades of Khorne: The followers of Khorne, the Blood God, revel in battle and bloodshed, seeking to spill blood in his name.

They are characterized by resilient, grotesque warriors who spread rot and despair.\n*Slaves to Darkness: Mortals who have pledged themselves to the Chaos Gods, forming the backbone of many Chaos armies. They include a variety of warriors, champions, and monstrous allies.\n*Skaven: A race of malevolent, rat-like humanoids that worship the Horned Rat. Known for their treachery, they employ cunning tactics and overwhelming numbers.\nDeath\nThis Grand Alliance encompasses the forces of the undead and other beings that thrive in death.
