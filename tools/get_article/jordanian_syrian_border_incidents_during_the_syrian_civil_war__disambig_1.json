The security system has enabled the Jordanian border patrol units to discover and deal with several border infiltrations. The system detects the movement of militias before reaching Jordanian territory and the army issues warnings to the infiltrators and when the warnings go ignored, they are exterminated, according to established rules of engagement.\nJordan says that drug smuggling attempts have increased three-fold since the start of the Syrian civil war. All infiltration attempts have been foiled.\nOverview\nOverview as of 17 March 2017.\n{| class=\"wikitable centre sortable\"\n|+\n!\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n!Total\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Number of infiltrations\n! 85\n! 79\n! 24\n! 188\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Number of people involved\n! 132\n! 151\n! 65\n!348\n|}\nTimeline\n2012\nIn October 2012, Islamic militants attempted to infiltrate Jordan from Syria during the Syrian civil war. One militant was severely injured and 4 were killed, the clash resulted in the death of one Jordanian soldier, the first Jordanian military personnel to be killed during the Syrian civil war. 13 IS members involved were arrested while the rest retreated back to Syrian territory.\n2014\n| executed_by   = Royal Jordanian Air Force\n| outcome       = Destruction of the convoy\n| casualties    = 2 killed\n10 injured\n}}\nOn 16 April 2014, the Jordanian Air Force bombed a convoy of vehicles on the Syrian-Jordanian border. Reportedly, the airstrike took place when the convoy attempted to penetrate the Jordanian border from Syria.\nThough Syrian involvement was proposed, a Syrian military official said the vehicles did not belong to the Syrian army. A Jordanian security source said the targets appeared to have been Syrian rebels with machine guns mounted on civilian vehicles who were seeking refuge from fighting with government forces in southern Syria.\n2016\nOn 23 January, a total of 36 armed men tried to infiltrate the border and an engagement with Jordanian border patrol left 12 dead infiltrators while the rest retreated back into Syria. They were found to have 2 million drug pills. The spokesperson also stated that \"Jordan will not tolerate any infiltration attempt and will strike with an iron fist to whoever tries to disrupt Jordanian national security\".\nOn 25 January, two armed men tried to infiltrate the borders and were exterminated. They were found to have 2600 palm-sized bags of marijuana and 2.4 million Captagon pills.\nOn 7 February, two men exploited the foggy weather conditions and tried to infiltrate. They were exterminated, according to rules of engagement, according to the Jordan Armed Forces spokesperson.

The attack left 6 dead and 14 injured Jordanian soldiers. As a result of the incident, the Jordan-Syria border has been declared as a \"closed military zone\". Jordanian minister of foreign affairs Nasser Judeh said in a press conference \"we don't need a hideous terrorist attack like this one to prove to the world the legitimacy of our security concerns\".\nThe country has also stated that it will halt the expansion or construction of refugee camps. Following the incident, delivery of humanitarian aid to the area was stopped due to increased security concerns. Only one food delivery was allowed since the attack, however water delivery resumed two weeks following the incident. As of September 2016, around 75,000 Syrian refugees are stranded in the Rukban area under extremely poor living conditions. Due to the lack of access to medical care and clean water, the spread of diseases has increased and as a result disease-related deaths.\nOn 8 September 2016, a vehicle that was trying to infiltrate into Jordan was destroyed by the Jordanian border guards while it was still in Syrian territory.\n3 infiltrators were killed as they approached the Jordanian borders from Syria on 27 October 2016.\n2017\nA car explosion on 22 January 2017 at the Rukban refugee camp caused 11 deaths among Syrian refugees.\nSeven individuals attempted to cross the border on 17 March 2017, an engagement with the border guards killed three while the rest retreated back to Syria.
