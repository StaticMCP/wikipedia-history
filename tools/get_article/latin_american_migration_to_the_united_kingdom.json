Before the 1970s, when political and civil unrest became widespread in many Latin American countries, the United Kingdom's Latin American community was relatively small. Since then, economic migration to the United Kingdom has increased, with Brazilian- and Colombian-born residents now forming the two largest Latin American groups, standing at an estimated 79,000 and 16,000, respectively, as of 2020/21. A significant number of refugees and asylum seekers also moved to the UK during the late 20th century. However, since the turn of the century, Latin Americans have been migrating to the UK for a diverse range of reasons. Today, the community comprises individuals from various socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, the UK is home to British-born people of Latin American ancestry. During the 2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis, Britain became one of the preferred European destinations for some of the approximately 1.4 million Latin Americans who had acquired Spanish citizenship.\nHistory and settlement\nEarly presence of political figures\nestablished his successful campaign for Latin American independence in London]]\nLatin Americans have lived in what is now the United Kingdom for centuries, albeit in much smaller numbers than there are today.\nEarly in 1595 Sir Walter Raleigh established a pact with chief indigenous Morequito of Spanish Guyana (actual Venezuela) who trusted his son Caywerace to be educated in London, with the agreement that the boy will be installed as emperor of Guyana upon its conquest by England. Caywerace will accompany Raleigh as a servant for years to come.\nThe earliest migrants date back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries, primarily politicians and writers who settled largely in London. Their aim was to raise funds for weapons to aid in the liberation of Latin America from Spanish and Portuguese rule. London became a prime destination for these individuals because Britain,  seeking to weaken the Spanish Empire while expanding their own, was willing to support their cause.\nOne notable figure, General Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan-born political exile, spent 14 years in the British capitol. Originally a member of the Spanish Navy, de Miranda decided to help free Latin America after witnessing the American War of Independence and French Revolution. On 1798 Miranda founded the London lodge \"The Great American Reunion\" with Scottish rite. As close ally of British Prime Minister William Pitt, de Miranda secured financial support from the British government for Latin America's wars of Independence following several meetings with Pitt.\nAnother key figure, Simón Bolívar, known as \"The Liberator\" for his key role in the Spanish–American War of independence, visited London for six months in 1810. Leading a Venezuelan diplomatic mission alongside scholar Andrés Bello and Luis López Méndez, Bolívar sought British naval and diplomatic protection after the Junta of Caracas severed ties with the Spanish Monarchy. They presented their case to Richard Wellesley, the British Foreign Office undersecretary. However, under pressure from the Spanish ambassador, who argued that Bolívar lacked the authority to demand self-rule, the British turned him away. Bolívar returned to Venezuela, while others from his delegation remained in London's Somers Town. Jose Maria Vargas was imprisoned in 1813 for revolutionary activities in Venezuela. Upon his release in 1814, he travelled to United Kingdom for medical training at University of Edinburgh. On December, 1814 Supreme Director Gervasio Posadas, faced with the refusal of United Kingdom to sell arms to the rebellious American colonies, given a new alliance between Spain and Great Britain, decided to send Bernardino Rivadavia, Manuel Belgrano and Manuel de Sarratea –the most distinguished and cultured members of Buenos Aires society– to promote the crowning of Francisco de Paula, son of Charles IV of Spain, as regent of the United Provinces and negotiate in London with the new Spanish sovereign, “a solid and equitable pacification”. Manuel Palacio Fajardo in 1817 published a book in London city  entitled \"Outline of the Revolution in Spanish America\"  which positively influenced European public opinion toward the independence of the American colonies from Spain. Along with Luis Lopez Mendez he managed to obtain weapons and recruit many men of the British Legion who go to Venezuela to fight for independence in the Simon Bolivar Army.\nIn the years that followed, many Latin American nations gained independence. Political figures such as José Antonio Zea and José Rafael Revenga stayed in London, seeking loans to support the development of their newly independent nations.\nIt was not only politicians who benefited from London's safe and welcoming environment. Many Latin American writers, at risk of execution or imprisonment for their work in their home countries, found refuge in the UK and published their works there. Notable examples include the Venezuelans Andres Bello and Simon Rodriguez, the Brazilian Hippolyto da Costa and the Colombian Juan Garcia del Rio.\nExiles and refugees after 1970\nThe first significant wave of migration from Latin America to the United Kingdom occurred in the 1970s, catalysed in part by the Immigration Act of 1971. Prior to this legislation, strict rules limited work permits or residency in mainland UK to individuals from current or former British overseas colonies and territories. The changes introduced by the act made it easier for Latin Americans and other groups to gain the right to live and work in the UK, marking the beginning of the growth of the Latin American community.\nThis period saw the arrival of both migrant workers and refugees fleeing oppressive political regimes. The first large group of Latin American migrants consisted of approximately 2,500 Chilean exiles who settled in London in the early 1970s. These migrants included businesspeople, academics, and students who had fled the political instability in Chile. Among the exiles were right-wing individuals escaping the rule of Salvador Allende and later leftists fleeing Augusto Pinochet's regime.\nChile was not the only source of Latin American refugees during the 1970s and late 20th century. Individuals from Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador also sought asylum in the UK. Argentina's military government (the National Reorganization Process), which ruled from 1976 and 1983, was a major factor driving Latin American migration.\nColombians, who form the largest Latin American group in the UK, have been arriving in significant numbers since the 1970s. Most migrated between 1986 and 1997, driven from their homes by guerrilla and paramilitary violence in Colombia. During the 20th century, the UK was the most favoured European destination for Colombian migrants and refugees, even surpassing Spain.\nBolivians represent a smaller Latin American refugee group in the UK. During Bolivia's late 20th-century political instability, many Bolivians chose to migrate to the United States or neighbouring South American countries. Despite this, the UK remains the second most popular European destination for Bolivian migrants, regardless of their migration status.\nCuban migration to the UK, though relatively small in scale, began in the early 1960s following the Communist takeover of Cuba. Many Cubans left during the Freedom Flights, which started in 1965, and some chose the UK as an alternative to the United States.\nDemographics and population\nUnlike the censuses in the United States and Canada, the United Kingdom Census does not include a category for individuals to identify as \"Latin American.\" As a result, it is challenging to determine the exact number of British citizens or residents of Latin American ethnic or national origin.\nOfficial statistics on Latin American-born residents\nAccording to the 2001 UK Census, 62,735 Latin Americans living in the United Kingdom were born in their respective countries of origin. An additional 1,338 individuals reported their birthplace as \"South or Central America,\" though not all South American countries are considered \"Latin.\"\nBy 2009, the Office for National Statistics estimated that the Brazilian-born population in the UK had risen to approximately 60,000, while the Colombian-born population had grown to around 22,000. However, estimates for other Latin American countries were not provided due to insufficient sample sizes, which limited the accuracy of data for smaller groups.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

A detailed analysis conducted in May 2011 estimated the population at 186,500, with 113,500 in London. This figure includes irregular migrants and second-generation Latin Americans.\nPopulation distribution\nAccording to a 2005 report by the Institute for Public Policy Research, based on data from the 2001 Census, the ten census tracts with the largest South American-born populations were all located in London. Hyde Park had the highest number of South Americans, followed by Vauxhall North, Kensington, Chelsea, Vauxhall South, Regent's Park, Streatham North, Hammersmith, Streatham South, Hackney South, and Newham.\nOutside London, the largest South American populations were recorded in Oxford, Cambridge, central Manchester, central Bristol, central Edinburgh and Milton Keynes. More recently, it has been suggested that Liverpool now hosts the largest Latin American population in the UK outside London.\nThere are also areas, such as the Latin Village in South Tottenham and Elephant and Castle, that feature a concentration of Latin American shops and clubs. However, due to gentrification, the community in Elephant and Castle has faced the challenge of being priced out of the area.\nLatin Americans acquiring British citizenship\nThe table below shows the number of Latin Americans who acquired citizenship of the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2008; sorted alphabetically.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It ceased publication, and the company was officially dissolved in 2010.\nCrónica Latina was likely one of the first Latin American newspapers in London, founded in 1984 by Juan Salgado. It was initially published as Notas de Colombia before adopting the name Crónica Latinas in 1986. The newspaper is no longer in circulation.\nSocial and political issues\nAssimilation into British culture\nLatin Americans residing in the UK often refer to themselves as the \"Invisibles\" to highlight the lack of representation in the community and the absence of formal ethnic minority status for Latin Americans.\nEconomics and employment\nEighty-five percent of the Latin American community in the UK are employed, though many work in jobs for which they are overqualified, and very few rely on state benefits. Around 70% of Latin Americans in the UK have some form of education beyond the secondary level. However, they are 10 times more likely to work for less than minimum wage. Many emigrants who arrive as lawyers or in other skilled professions end up working in low-level positions due to a lack of opportunities. 40% of Latin American workers report experiencing workplace abuse and exploitation, and 11% say they are paid less than the national minimum wage – a rate 10 times higher than the national average for the British population.\nAsylum seekers and refugees\nMany Latin Americans have fled their home countries in search of safety and political asylum in the United Kingdom due to conflicts and civil wars, such as the ongoing Colombian armed conflict which began in 1964.\nNotable individuals\nSee also\n*Latin Americans\n*Latin America–United Kingdom relations\n*Latin American diaspora\n*Foreign-born population of the United Kingdom\n*Migration from Latin America to Europe\n*Spaniards in the United Kingdom\n*Portuguese in the United Kingdom\n*British Latin American\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.latinamericanfilmfestival.com/ London Latin American Film Festival]\n*[http://www.visitlondon.com/maps/multicultural_london/latin_american/index Visit London - Latin American section]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070621035225/http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/news/ART40466.html History of Latin Americans in the UK]\n*[http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/RWWC/Themes/1272/ Reassessing what we collect website – Central and South American London (History of Central and South American London with objects and images)]"
