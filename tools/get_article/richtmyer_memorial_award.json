Richtmyer and given annually by the American Association of Physics Teachers. Its recipients include over 15 Nobel Prize winners.\nEstablishment and award criteria\nFloyd T. Richtmyer (1881–1939) was one of the first presidents of the American Association of Physics Teachers and his work helped shape the development of physics in the United States. The Richtmyer Award was established in 1941, and is typically given to educators who have made outstanding contributions as teachers in their fields.  It is awarded to those who have not only produced important current research in physics, but to those who have, by means of communication to both students and other educators, imparted information and motivation to participants in the field.  The effective use of a teaching method in order to pass on information, and to stimulate interest in physics, is seen as being worthy of recognition in its own right, in addition to the importance of the production of new research.\nRecipients of the award deliver a Keynote Address, the annual Richtmyer Lecture, which is designed for communication with non-specialist audiences, during the AAPT Winter Meeting.\nRecipients\nPast recipients of the award include \"a long list of giants in the field of physics\"  such as UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau (1989); Steven Chu of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (1990), who also is a UC Berkeley professor of physics and a physics Nobelist, and who has been the 12th United States Secretary of Energy since 2009; and physicists Charles Townes (1959), Emilio Segrè (1957), J. Robert Oppenheimer (1947), and Nobel prize winner Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1996.\nSince its foundation in 1941, the following scientists from a wide number of institutions have received this award:\nSource: [http://www.aapt.org/Programs/awards/richtmyer.cfm American Association of Physics Teachers]\n* 1941 - Arthur H.

The Richtmyer Award is the forerunner of modern awards such as the Young Faculty Award (YFA) program established by DARPA, the aim of which is to identify and engage rising research stars in junior faculty positions at U.S. academic institutions.\nSee also\n* List of physics awards\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aapt.org/programs/awards/richtmyer.cfm Official website]\nReferences"
