The design incorporated a radical arrangement for the twelve 340&nbsp;mm (13.4&nbsp;in) main battery guns: three quadruple-gun turrets, the first of their kind, as opposed to the twin-gun turrets used by most other navies. The first four ships were to be fitted with an unusual hybrid propulsion system that used both steam turbines and triple-expansion steam engines to increase fuel efficiency.\nThe ships were never completed due to shifting production requirements and a shortage of labor after the beginning of World War I in 1914. The first four ships were sufficiently advanced in construction to permit their launching to clear the slipways for other, more important work. Many of the guns built for the ships were converted for use by the Army. After the war, the French Navy considered several proposals to complete the ships, either as originally designed or modernized to account for lessons from the war. The weak French post-war economy forestalled these plans, and the first four ships were broken up.\nThe last ship, Béarn, which was not significantly advanced at the time work halted, was converted into an aircraft carrier in the 1920s. She remained in service in various capacities until the 1960s, and was ultimately scrapped in 1967.\nDevelopment\nIn December 1911, the French Navy's Technical Committee () issued a report that examined the design of the  that had been ordered for 1912. They concluded that the amidships gun turret was an unsatisfactory choice, based on experiences from the 1880s with blast damage on battleships from their own guns. This position influenced the construction of the next class of dreadnought battleships, for which design work began shortly thereafter.\nThe French Navy's design staff () submitted the first draft of the new dreadnought design in February 1912. The size of French shipyard facilities significantly affected the design. Length was limited to , beam to , and draft to approximately . These dimensions limited the design to a displacement of around  and a speed of , depending on the armament arrangement.\nThe design staff presented three armament alternatives, all armed with a secondary armament of twenty  guns in a new twin-gun casemate mounting. The first was a design with the same ten 340&nbsp;mm guns as the Bretagnes, but with a top speed greater than 21&nbsp;knots. The second was for a ship with a dozen 340&nbsp;mm guns arranged in two quadruple-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure with superfiring twin-gun turrets and a speed of 20&nbsp;knots. The last proposal was a ship that was armed with sixteen  guns in four quadruple turrets and a speed of 20&nbsp;knots.\nThe staff also prepared two design options for the propulsion system. One used two sets of direct-drive steam turbines, as in the Bretagne class; the one ultimately selected was a hybrid system that used one set of direct-drive turbines on the two inner propeller shafts, and two vertical triple-expansion steam engines (VTE) on the outer shafts for low-speed cruising. This was intended to reduce coal consumption at cruising speeds, as direct-drive turbines are very inefficient at moderate to low speeds. The fifth ship, Béarn, was instead equipped with two sets of turbines to allow her to match the fuel consumption rate of the turbine-equipped Bretagne class.\nThe General Staff decided in March 1912 to retain the 340&nbsp;mm gun of the Bretagne class and favored the all-turbine design. They chose the new quadruple turret and preferred an armament of twelve guns in two quadruple and two double turrets. The following month, the Naval Supreme Council () could not reach a decision on the quadruple turret as it was still being developed, but wished to revisit the issue once it was further along. The council rejected the twin-gun casemate mounting proposed for the secondary armament and proposed a mixture of eighteen 138.6&nbsp;mm and a dozen  guns. It accepted the hybrid propulsion system, and the armor layout of the Bretagne class was to be retained, with an increase in the thickness of the main belt  if possible. Théophile Delcassé, the Naval Minister (), accepted the council's recommendations with the proviso that the Bretagne-class arrangement of five twin turrets, including one amidships, would be substituted if the quadruple turrets were not ready in time.\nThe Technical Department prepared two new designs, A7, which incorporated the five twin turrets, and A7bis, with three quadruple turrets. The A7bis design was some  lighter than the A7 design, and on 6 April the Navy accepted a quadruple-gun-turret design submitted by Saint-Chamond. On 22 May it realized that the 100&nbsp;mm gun would not ne ready by the time construction was scheduled to begin, so the design reverted to the 138.6&nbsp;mm gun. Further work revealed that two additional guns could be accommodated, and the Naval Supreme Council accepted the design with twenty-four 138.6&nbsp;mm guns on 8 July.\nDescription\nThe Normandie-class ships were  long at the waterline, and  long overall. They had a beam of  and a mean draft of  at full load. They were intended to displace  at normal load and  at deep load. The ships were subdivided by transverse bulkheads into 21 watertight compartments.\nThe first four ships were equipped with one set of steam turbines driving the inner pair of four-bladed,  propellers. Normandie and Flandre had license-built Parsons turbines, Gascogne had turbines by Rateau-Bretagne, and Languedocs turbines were built by Schneider-Zoelly. The four ships had a pair of four-cylinder vertical triple-expansion engines that drove the two outer three-bladed,  propellers for steaming astern or cruising at low speed. The last ship, Béarn, was equipped with two sets of Parsons turbines, each driving a pair of three-bladed, 3.34&nbsp;m propellers. Normandie and Gascogne were fitted with 21 Guyot-du Temple-Normand small-tube boilers, Flandre and Languedoc were equipped with 28 Belleville large-tube boilers, while Béarn had 28 Niclausse boilers. All of the boilers operated at a pressure of .\nThe ships' engines were rated at  and were designed to give them a speed of , although use of forced draft was intended to increase their output to  and the maximum speed to . The ships were designed to carry  of coal and  of fuel oil, but up to  of coal could be stored in the hull. At a cruising speed of , the ships could steam for ; at , the range fell to , and at top speed, it dropped to . The ships would have had a crew of 44 officers and 1,160 enlisted men when serving as a flagship.\nArmament\nThe main battery of the Normandie class consisted of a dozen 45-caliber Canon de 340&nbsp;mm Modèle 1912M guns mounted in three quadruple turrets. One turret was placed forward, one amidships, and one aft, all on the centerline. The turrets weighed , and were electrically trained and hydraulically elevated. The guns were divided into pairs and moved together in twin cradles; a -thick bulkhead divided the turrets in half. Each pair of guns had its own ammunition hoist and magazine. They could be fired simultaneously or independently. Had the ships been completed, these would have been the first quadruple turrets in the world.\nThe guns had a range of  and a rate of fire of two rounds per minute. The shells were  armor-piercing rounds and were fired with a muzzle velocity of . Each gun was to have been supplied with 100 rounds of ammunition. Five  rangefinders provided fire-control for the main battery. Two of the rangefinders were mounted on the conning tower and the other three were placed atop each of the turrets. The turrets also had auxiliary gunnery-control stations.\nThe ships would also have been armed with a secondary battery of twenty-four 55-caliber 138.6&nbsp;mm Modèle 1910 guns, each singly mounted in casemates near the main-gun turrets. These guns fired a  shell at a muzzle velocity of . These guns would have been supplied with 275 rounds of ammunition each. Six Canon de  Modèle 1902 anti-aircraft guns, which were converted from low-angle guns, would also have been carried by the ships. The ships also would have been equipped with six underwater  torpedo tubes, three on each broadside, and carried 36 torpedoes.\nProtection\n, 1916]]\nThe armor belt of the Normandie-class ships was made from Krupp cemented armor and extended almost the entire length of the hull (), save  at the stern. The belt consisted of two rows of plates that were a total of  high, of which  was below the waterline. The thickest portion of the armor protected the hull between the barbettes of the end turrets and was  thick. Each of the upper plates was tapered to a thickness of  at its top edge and the lower plates were tapered to  at their bottom edge. From No. 1 barbette to the bow, the plates progressively reduced in thickness from  at the bow; the upper edges also progressively reduced from  while the bottom edge of these plates was  thick. Aft of the rear turret, the armor plates were progressively reduced in thickness from 260 millimeters to 140 millimeters. Their upper edges also progressively thinned from , and their lower edges were the same 80 millimeters in thickness as their forward equivalents. The aft belt terminated in a  transverse bulkhead.\nAbove the waterline belt was an upper strake of 160-millimeter armor that extended between the fore and aft groups of casemates for the secondary armament. The portions of the barbettes that extended outside the upper armor were protected by  plates, while the interior surfaces were only  thick to save weight. The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of 300&nbsp;millimeters on their faces,  on the sides, and 100 millimeters on the roof. The sides of the conning tower were  thick and its roof was also 100&nbsp;millimeters thick. The lower armored deck consisted of a single  plate of mild steel for a width of  along the centerline, and another layer of the same thickness was added outboard of that. The deck sloped downwards to meet the bottom of the waterline belt, and a  plate of armor steel reinforced the sloped portion of the deck to give a total thickness of . Two layers of  plating made up the center of the upper armored deck, which was reinforced to a total of  along the edges and  above the magazine.\nThe hull of the Normandies had a double bottom  deep. Their propulsion machinery spaces and magazines were protected by a torpedo bulkhead that consisted of two  layers of nickel-chrome steel plates. The outer side of the bulkhead was lined with a 10-millimeter plate of corrugated flexible steel intended to absorb the force of a torpedo detonation. Another measure intended to dissipate the force were  tubes that extended from the double bottom to the upper armored deck, intended to divert the gases of a detonation away from the torpedo bulkhead. Concerned about the possibility of capsizing after asymmetric flooding, the design incorporated empty compartments below the waterline and outboard of the fore and aft 34-centimeter magazines, the engine rooms and the midships 138.6-millimeter magazines that were intended to be flooded if necessary to correct any list.\nShips\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Construction data\n! scope=\"col\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" | Builder\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Launched\n! scope=\"col\" | In Service\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Normandie\n|Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire, St Nazaire\n| 18 April 1913\n| 19 October 1914\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | —\n| Incomplete, scrapped 1924–1925\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Flandre\n| Arsenal de Brest, Brest\n| rowspan=2|1 October 1913\n| 20 October 1914\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | —\n| Incomplete, scrapped October 1924\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gascogne\n| Arsenal de Lorient, Lorient\n| 20 September 1914\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | —\n| Incomplete, scrapped 1923–1924\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Languedoc\n|Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde, Lormont\n| 1 May 1913\n| 1 May 1915\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | —\n| Incomplete, scrapped June 1929\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée, La Seyne-sur-Mer\n| 5 January 1914\n| 15 April 1920\n| May 1927\n| Converted to an aircraft carrier, scrapped 1967\n|}\nConstruction and cancellation\nNamed after provinces of France, Normandie and Languedoc were ordered on 18 April 1913, although neither was formally authorized until the enabling finance bill () was passed on 30 July, and Flandre and Gascogne on that same day. Béarn had been planned to be ordered on 1 October 1914, but it was brought forward to 1 January; the five ships would permit the creation of two four-ship divisions with the three Bretagne-class dreadnoughts then under construction.\nWork on the class was suspended at the outbreak of World War I, as all resources were needed for the Army. The mobilization in July greatly impeded construction as workmen who were in the reserves were called up for military service, and work was effectively halted later that month. The labor force available to work on the Normandies was further reduced by conscription and orders for munitions for the Army. In light of such constraints, the navy decided that only those ships that could be completed quickly, such as the Brétagnes, would be worked upon, although sufficient construction of the first four Normandies was authorized to clear the slipways for other purposes. Construction of Béarn had been already halted on 23 July, and all further work on her was abandoned.\nIn July 1915 work on the ships' armament was suspended, save the guns themselves, which could be converted for use by the Army. Four of the completed 340&nbsp;mm guns were converted into railway guns for the French Army. Nine of the guns built for Languedoc were also mounted on railway carriages in 1919, after the end of the war. Several of the 138.6&nbsp;mm guns were also modified for service with the Army.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n|+ Progress when abandoned\n! scope=\"col\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" | Hull\n! scope=\"col\" | Engines\n! scope=\"col\" | Boilers\n! scope=\"col\" | Moving parts of turrets\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Normandie\n| 65%\n| 70%\n| Delivered\n| 40%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Languedoc\n| 49%\n| 73%\n| 96%\n| 26%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Flandre\n| 65%\n| 60%\n| Delivered\n| 51%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Gascogne\n| 60%\n| Turbines 44%; VTE 75%\n| Delivered\n| Captured\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Béarn\n| 25%\n| 17%\n| 20%\n| 8–10%\n|}\nThe boilers intended for Normandie and Gascogne were used to replace the worn-out boilers of various destroyers, namely the s purchased from Argentina in 1914 and the three Aetos-class ships seized from the Royal Hellenic Navy in late 1916. The boilers built for Flandre were installed in new anti-submarine ships. The armor-plate and turntables for Gascognes turrets had been ordered from Fives-Lille, whose factory was captured by the Germans in 1914. They were discovered in one of Krupp's factories in Germany in 1921, and returned to the Navy.\nIn January 1918, a final wartime order specified that the ships remained suspended, but that all material that had been stockpiled for work would remain in place. By that time, some  of steel plating that had been earmarked for Gascogne had been taken for other uses.\nOn 22 November, days after the Armistice with Germany, the design staff sent the General Staff a proposal to complete the first four Normandies to a modified design. The General Staff replied that the ships would need a top speed of  and a more powerful main battery. Since the dockyard facilities had not been enlarged during the war, the size of the ships could not be significantly increased. This allowed only modest improvements, particularly for the installation of anti-torpedo bulges. In February 1919, the General Staff decided that the ships would be completed anyway, because new vessels incorporating the lessons of the war could not be completed for at least six to seven years due to the lengthy design studies  required.\nThe Technical Department created a revised design that incorporated some improvements. The machinery for the four ships that had been launched during the war would be retained; increasing their speed to  required a corresponding increase to , which could be obtained by building more powerful turbines. The elevation of the main guns was to be increased to 23–24&nbsp;degrees, which would increase the range of the guns to  to avoid being outranged by foreign battleships. The need to engage targets at longer ranges was confirmed by the examination of one of the ex-Austrian  ships that had been surrendered to France at the end of the war. The main armored deck was to be increased to  to increase resistance to plunging fire. The submerged 450&nbsp;mm torpedo tubes were to be replaced with deck-mounted  tubes, and fire-control equipment was to be improved. Equipment for handling a two-seat reconnaissance aircraft and a single-seat fighter was also to be installed.\nAfter the war, Vice Admiral Pierre Ronarc'h became Chief of the General Staff, and in July 1919 he argued that the Italian Navy was the country's primary naval rival, and that they might resume work on the s that had been suspended during the war. He suggested there were three options for the first four Normandies: complete them as designed, increase the range of their guns and improve their armor, or lengthen their hull and install new engines to increase speed. The Technical Department determined that lengthening the hulls by  could increase speed by as much as . Nevertheless, by 12 September 1919, Ronarc'h had decided that completing the ships would be too expensive for the fragile French economy. Plans for the first four ships included converting them into cargo ships, oil tankers, or passenger liners, or using them as floating oil depots, but these ideas were ultimately rejected. The ships were formally cancelled in the 1922 construction program, and were laid up in Landevennec and cannibalized for parts before being broken up in 1923–1926. Much of the salvaged material was incorporated into completing Béarn and in modernizing the battleship .\nPlans to complete Béarn included replacement of the coal-fired boilers with eight oil-fired Niclausse boilers and new, more powerful turbines. A new quadruple turret that allowed greater range was considered, along with twin turrets mounting  guns. The battleship was launched on 15 April 1920 to clear the slipway. A temporary  wooden platform was built atop the lower armored deck later that year to serve as a flight deck for aircraft landing trials. Transverse arresting wires that were weighted by sandbags were improvised, and the evaluation successfully took place off Toulon in late 1920. In 1922, the Navy instead decided to complete the ship as an aircraft carrier. Conversion work began in August 1923, and was completed by May 1927 using the hybrid propulsion system from Normandie with a dozen Normand boilers. The ship was the first carrier of the French Navy. She served in the fleet through World War II, generally being used as a ferry for aircraft; she did not see any combat as she spent most of the war in the Caribbean in the island of Martinique. In 1944, she was refitted in the United States and equipped with a battery of modern American anti-aircraft guns. She remained in service through the First Indochina War, still as an aircraft ferry. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1967.\nNotes\nReferences\n* }}\n*\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n* }}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n* }}\n*\n}}\nFurther reading\n*"
