The naval battle involved three armed U.S. privateer vessels against three Nova Scotian vessels off Cape Split, Nova Scotia.  American Privateers caught two Nova Scotia Vessels. The first Nova Scotia vessel was re-captured by Lieut Benjamin Belcher.  The second Nova Scotia vessel was overtaken by the captured crew under the command of Captain Bishop. The privateers were taken to Cornwallis and put on trial.\nBackground\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the U.S. regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. U.S. privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities, such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal. After the British defeated the Penobscot Expedition, the U.S. privateers began their most fierce revenge by attacking Nova Scotia.\nThe engagement between the U.S. privateers and local militia was one of several in the region.  On 2 May 1777, in the Minas Basin the Captain Collet ordered the capture the U.S. privateer schooner Sea Duck, under the command of John Bohannan. He had the vessel taken to Windsor.  There was another raid on the Cornwallis Township in 1778. In June 1779, the British forces at Windsor captured 12 U.S. privateers in the Bay of Fundy.\nOn 10 July 1780, the British privateer brig Resolution (16 guns) under the command of Thomas Ross engaged the U.S. privateer Viper (22 guns and 130 men) off Halifax at Sambro Light. In what one observer described as \"one of the bloodiest battles in the history of privateering\", the two privateers began a \"severe engagement\" during which both pounded each other with cannon fire for about 90 minutes. The engagement resulted in the surrender of Resolution'' and the death of up to 18 British and 33 U.S. sailors.\nBattle\nis the namesake of Belcher St., Port Williams, Nova Scotia]]\nThere were 30 U.S. privateers in one armed shallop (one carriage gun and six swivels) and two whaleboats.  They captured Captain Sheffield’s schooner.\nCaptain William Bishop, in a small schooner (35 men), pursued the three privateer vessels and their prize. Bishop was in a 25 minute naval battle with the privateers but was captured by them.\nLieutenant Belcher in the armed sloop Success (with 28 crewmen) pursued the three U.S. privateer vessels and their two prizes (Sheffield’s schooner and Bishop’s schooner). Belcher caught Sheffield’s vessel, killing one privateer in the process.  Many of the privateers then escaped in their whaleboat to the shores of Cape Split.\nBelcher then began to pursue Captain Bishop’s vessel.  During the pursuit Captain Bishop overthrew his captors and regained command of his schooner. He sent the remaining U.S. privateer prisoners to Cornwallis.\nAfterward\nU.S. privateers continued to attack vessels in the Bay of Fundy.  On August 7, 1781 the British schooner Adventure captured the schooner Mary off Annapolis. In the fall of 1781, under orders of Captain James Nevins (Nevens, Nivens, Nuyens, Nevers), Mr. Low of the U.S. naval vessel Defence (18 men) went up the Bay of Fundy and was attacked by the Nova Scotia militia.  The militia captured two of the Americans, while the rest of the crew fled into the woods and were rescued by Acadians.\nLegacy\n* The sword used by Captain William Bishop in the battle is in the King's County Museum, Nova Scotia\n* Lieut.

The following year, after a failed attempt to raid Chester, Nova Scotia, U.S. privateers struck again in the Raid on Lunenburg in 1782.\nSee also\n*\n* Military history of Nova Scotia\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nSecondary sources\n* Joan Dawson.
