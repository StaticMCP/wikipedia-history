Howard bibliographyProse bibliography}}\nA list of poems by Robert E. Howard (1906–1936), an American writer and poet in early 20th-century Texas. His love of poetry came from being read to by his mother at a young age. However, his attempts to make a living by poetry were unsuccessful and he is today most remembered for his short stories and fiction. Nevertheless, Howard wrote hundreds of poems; many were published within his lifetime and the others published after his 1936 suicide.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"15%\" | Title\n! width=\"3%\"  | Lines\n! width=\"15%\" | Opening line\n! width=\"13%\" | Place of publication\n! width=\"7%\"  | Publication date\n! width=\"8%\"  | Alternative title(s)\n! width=\"8%\"  | Source text\n! width=\"21%\" | Notes\n! width=\"10%\" | References\n|-\n| The title of the poem\n| #\n| The text of the first known line in the poem\n| The book or magazine in which the poem was first published\n| The date on which the poem was first published\n| Any alternative titles by which the poem is also known\n| Links to online texts where available\n| Further information about the poem\n| Bibliographic sources\n|-style=\"background:#E0E0E0;\"\n| An alternative title for the poem\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| The main title of the poem\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nThe lack of information in a column does not necessarily mean that the information does not exist, only that verifiable information is not currently available. For example, the lack of publication information does not necessarily mean that a poem has not been published to date, nor does the lack of a definite note about the public domain indicate that a poem is still under copyright.\nThis table may be sorted by different columns by clicking on the icon in the appropriate column.  Clicking the icon again will alternate between ascending and descending order.\n;Additional notes:\nTitle/Alternative title: Some poems are known by multiple titles.  Alternative titles are shown in the column of the same name. Every effort has been made to list full information at all entries for each title, to save the user time in scrolling. Occasionally, alternative titles appear consecutively, in which case the second entry will follow without additional information, shown in a darker gray on the table.  In other cases, some poems were not titled by Howard or the original title has not survived. Some poems have been given tentative titles after Howard's death; this is indicated in the Notes column. Where multiple titles exist, they have been listed alphabetically by their various designations following the word \"Untitled.\"  Some pieces of poetry were used by Howard as epigraphs within his stories.  listed these poems under the title of the short story rather than the title of the poem itself, so the poems are listed under those titles as well.  With epigraphs, the first publication information given in this table is that of the poem's first printing separated from the story.\nLines: The number of lines in the poem.\nSource text: Links given in the Source Text column are to copies of the poem in online libraries (where available). For ease of browsing the table, these links are preceded by a small icon. For example, 15px for poems on Wikisource.\nReferences: Bibliographic references are given in the final column of each row.  The exception to this is the Notes column; as notes may come from diverse sources, or from a separate part of one of the main sources, each individual note is followed by its own reference.\nPoetry\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"15%\" | Title\n! width=\"3%\"  | Lines\n! width=\"15%\" | Opening line\n! width=\"13%\" | Place of publication\n! width=\"7%\"  | Publication date\n! width=\"8%\"  | Alternative title(s)\n! width=\"8%\"  | Source text\n! width=\"21%\" | Notes\n! width=\"10%\" | References\n|-\n| Palace of Bast, The || 23 || She sits all day on an ebon couch || Chacal #2 || Spring 1977 || Palace of Bast ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Palm-trees are waving in the Gulf breeze || putatively 36 lines, when divided into couplets, but some lines and stanzas are written across the page like prose || Palm-trees are waving in the Gulf breeze || Austin, vol. 3, no. 1 || May 1992 || Untitled: Palm-trees are waving in the Gulf breeze ||  || Letter: Tevis Clyde Smith, September 7, 1924 ; Distributed as part of REHUPA #115  ||\n|-\n| Parody || 20 || What is so vile as a February day? || Always Comes Evening(Underwood-Miller edition) || 1977 || February ||  || The oldest known Howard poem, written January 28, 1921 at Cross Plains Highschool; Tentative title ; A parody of the famous passage that begins \"And what is so rare as a day in June?\" from James Russell Lowell's THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL ; An early work  ||\n|-\n| The Parrot || 20 || When the king and his folk lay dead || A Means to Freedom: The Letters of H.

Howard and Tevis Clyde Smith as teenagers.\n*  The Progress was published by Cross Plains High School.\n;Notes on short hand\n*  All or part of these poems are from or were included in a letter from Robert E. Howard to some recipient (the date is either the explicit date on the letter, an approximate dating of the letter where possible or else simply marked undated).  e.g. \"Letter: Tevis Clyde Smith, June 23, 1926\" indicates that the poem is from a letter to Tevis Clyde Smith dated June 23, 1926.\n*  These poems are in the public domain in the United States and any country where the Rule of the Shorter Term applies.\n*  With these poems, two or more sources give different publications and dates of the first appearance. e.g. \"Conflict: , The Howard Collector, 1962/, The Junto, 1929\" indicates that  states first publication as The Howard Collector (published in 1962), while  states first publication as The Junto (published in 1929).  Always listed with the earliest date first.\n*  Howard sometimes used the same title more than once, or the same title has been attached to untitled works by others.
