      "text": "# List of republics__disambig_1\n\nThis is a list of republics. For antiquity (or later in the case of societies that did not refer to modern terminology to qualify their form of government) the assessment of whether a state organisation is a republic is based on retrospective analysis by historians and political theorists. For more recent systems of government, worldwide organisations with a broad political acceptance (such as the United Nations), can provide information on whether or not a sovereign state is referred to as a republic.\nList by period\nAntiquity\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=120px|State\n! Dates of existence (BCE)\n! Notes\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | Ancient Carthage\n| c. 7th/6th century –146\n| Greek sources may have misunderstood Carthage’s political system, mistaking its leaders for kings when it was actually governed by a council of nobles (Shophets). The legend of Queen Dido likely served to legitimize this non-monarchical system. During the 6th century BC, Carthage experienced political upheaval marked by the revolt of a shophet/general named Malchus, signaling the city’s transition from monarchy to an oligarchic republic. Inscriptions from this period suggest that aristocratic rule had become firmly established by the late 7th or mid 6th century BC.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | Mahajanapadas\n| c. 7th/6th century – c. 345\n|Sixteen kingdoms or oligarchic republics that existed in ancient India from the sixth to fourth centuries BCE, during the second urbanisation period.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | Licchavikas\n| c. 7th/6th century – c. 468\n| The leading confederate tribe of the Vajjika League Mahajanapada;
