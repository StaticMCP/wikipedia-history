He was the only child of Henry Greville, 3rd Earl of Warwick, and the former Lady Sarah Elizabeth Savile. Before his parent's marriage, his mother had been widowed from John George Monson, 4th Baron Monson of Burton. From that marriage, he had an elder half-brother, Frederick John Monson, 5th Baron Monson.\nHis paternal grandparents were George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick, and, his second wife, the former Henrietta Vernon (the eldest daughter of Richard Vernon and the Countess of Upper Ossory). His maternal grandparents were John Savile, 2nd Earl of Mexborough and the former Elizabeth Stephenson (a daughter of Henry Stephenson). His maternal uncle was John Savile, 3rd Earl of Mexborough, an MP for Pontefract.\nHe was educated at St John's College, Oxford, from where he obtained a BA in 1839.\nCareer\nHe was Member of Parliament (MP) for South Warwickshire from 1845 to 1853, when he succeeded to the peerage. He served as honorary colonel to the Warwickshire Yeomanry cavalry, and as A.D.C. to Queen Victoria.\nHe joined the Canterbury Association on 11 February 1850 and was, from the day of joining, a member of the management committee.\nCollector\nLord Warwick was also a prolific contributor to the improvements of Warwick Castle during the nineteenth century. Alongside his artistic wife, Anne Charteris 4th Countess of Warwick, he oversaw the redecoration of the castle's Great Hall and domestic apartments after the fire of 1871. The celebrated architect Anthony Salvin was employed to rebuild the hall in the typical Victorian 'Gothic' taste, embellished with stained glass to achieve the effect of a medieval baronial hall. The domestic apartments were also redesigned, with each room assigned a different 'historical' style, typical of the nineteenth century interest in the 'Romantic Interior'.\nKnown as a prolific collector of books, Lord Warwick established a Shakespeare Library at Warwick Castle with the help of James Halliwell-Phillipps during the years 1852–1870. The entire contents of the library was sold after his death in 1897 to the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, D.C.\nLord Warwick was also a great collector of arms and armour, most of which was purchased through the New Bond Street dealer and forger Samuel Luke Pratt (1805–1878). Many of the greatest pieces were acquired by Pratt from the dispersed collection of Samuel Rush Meyrick and later sold to Greville. Alongside original pieces Pratt sold the Earl several Victorian forgeries, a practice that was commonplace for dealers at the time.\nPersonal life\n's Diamond Jubilee, 24 June 1897]]\nOn 18 February 1852, he married Lady Anne Charteris (1829–1903), daughter of Francis Wemyss-Charteris, 9th Earl of Wemyss of Gosford House, and the former Lady Louisa Bingham (a daughter of the 2nd Earl of Lucan). Together, they were the parents of five children:\n* Francis Greville, 5th Earl of Warwick (1853–1924), who married Frances Evelyn Maynard, daughter of Charles Henry Maynard, in 1881..\n* Hon. Alwyn Henry Fulke Greville (1854–1929), who was Equerry-in-Waiting to Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale; he married Mabel Elizabeth Georgina Smith OBE (d. 1940), only daughter of Ernald Mosley Smith of Selsdon Park (son of banker George Robert Smith), in 1888.\n* Hon.

Frank Dugdale CVO, second son of James Dugdale of Wroxall Abbey, in 1895.\n* Hon. Sidney Greville (1866–1927), who served as Private Secretary to Queen Alexandra.\nHe died at Warwick Castle on 2 December 1893.\nSee also\n*Earl of Warwick\n*List of owners of Warwick Castle\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
