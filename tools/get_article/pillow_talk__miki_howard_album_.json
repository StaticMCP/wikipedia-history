On this album, Howard sings her interpretations of favorite R&B classic songs. It peaked at number 60 on Billboards Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.\nCritical reception\n}}\nAllMusic editor Andy Kellman found that even Howard's \"most devout fans might feel a little shortchanged by the shortage of original material here. Howard's voice is in fine form, but she doesn't always sound inspired by the songs, and the arrangements tend to be lukewarm, whether they involve drum loops or smooth jazz stylings. The highlights include versions of Ann Peebles' \"I Can't Stand the Rain\" and Boz Scaggs' \"Lowdown,\" as well as the title track.\"\nTrack listing\n|length1         = 3:53\n|title2          = Do That to Me One More Time\n|writer2         = Toni Tennille\n|length2         = 4:03\n|title3          = Go Away Little Boy\n|writer3         =\n|length3         = 3:07\n|title4          = Pillow Talk\n|writer4         =\n|length4         = 4:41\n|title5          = This Masquerade\n|writer5         = Leon Russell\n|length5         = 2:55\n|title6          = Inseparable\n|writer6         =\n|length6         = 2:14\n|title7          = Lowdown\n|writer7         =\n|length7         = 3:46\n|title8          = Misty Blue\n|writer8         = Bob Montgomery\n|length8         = 5:24\n|title9          = Just Don't Want to Be Lonely\n|writer9         =\n|length9         = 4:07\n|title10         = Which Way Is Up\n|writer10        = Norman Whitfield\n|length10        = 3:22\n}}\nNotes\n* \"Go Away Little Boy\" is a cover of Marlena Shaw's \"Yu-Ma/Go Away Little Boy\" from her 1977 album Sweet Beginnings.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Pillow Talk\n! scope=\"col\"|Chart (2006)\n! scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
