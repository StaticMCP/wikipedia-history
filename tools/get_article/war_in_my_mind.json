The album was produced by Rob Cavallo. Hart was slated tour the UK and Europe in support of the album in 2020, but had to cancel a large fraction due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBackground\nIn the album announcement, Hart commented: \"More than any record I've ever made, I'm more open to being myself on these songs [...] On this record, something told me, 'Just let it be what it is.' I think I'm starting to make a little headway, getting closer to the truth. And I might not know what the truth is... but I'm OK with that.\"\nCritical reception\n}}\nWriting for American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz called it \"arguably [Hart's] most intimate and intense set yet\", further commenting that \"Her dynamic, classically influenced piano propels most songs including the ballads, such as the title track, that dominate this set. [...] There's no denying the truth, integrity and gritty realism that infuses everything Beth Hart touches.\"\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA)\n| 64\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
