In it, Fish examines various English writers from the seventeenth century, including Sir Francis Bacon, George Herbert, John Bunyan, and John Milton.  Since it explores the reader's experience of reading the text, it can be considered an example of reader-response criticism.\nThe book has been described variously as \"influential\", \"a classic of scholarship\". and as one of the author's \"two revolutionary books\"\nReferences"
