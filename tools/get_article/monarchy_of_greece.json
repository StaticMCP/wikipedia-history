Greece was led by a monarchy from 1832 to 1924 and from 1935 to 1973.\nHistory\nThe monarchy of Greece was created by the London Conference of 1832 at which the Hellenic State became a Kingdom. The Greek crown was originally offered to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha but he declined, later being elected the king of the Belgians.\nIn 1832, Prince Otto of Bavaria of the House of Wittelsbach was styled \"His Majesty Otto I, King of Greece\", over which he reigned for 30 years until he was deposed in 1862. After Otto's deposition as king, the crown was offered to many others.\nA head of state referendum was held in 1862 to name a new king. The vast majority of Greek people wanted Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, to be their new king. He won the referendum by 230,016 against the Duke of Leuchtenberg. Alfred declined to be king, and so did every candidate until Prince Vilhelm of Denmark of the House of Glücksburg, who had received only six votes. Vilhelm was elected unanimously by the Greek Assembly, and became \"His Majesty George I, King of the Hellenes\".\nThere was a referendum in 1920 to restore Constantine I as monarch, but four years later the Second Hellenic Republic was established and the monarchy was abolished following a referendum in 1924. Then in 1935 the monarchy was restored after a referendum and maintained after a referendum in 1946.\nIn July 1973 the Greek military junta called a referendum, which abolished the monarchy for the second time in Greek history. Then in 1974, the democratically elected prime minister, Konstantinos Karamanlis, called a referendum which legitimately confirmed the abolition.\nResidences\nTatoi was the private residence and 10,000-acre estate outside of Athens originally bought by King George I in the 1870s. The property was seized by the Republic following the 1974 referendum and has long been a contentious issue between the former royal family and the Greek state.\nThe Old Royal Palace () is the first royal palace of modern Greece, completed in 1843. It has housed the Hellenic Parliament since 1934. The Old Palace is situated at the heart of modern Athens, facing onto Syntagma Square.\nKings of Greece\nRoyal consorts\nRegents of Greece\nInsignia\nFile:Royal Monogram of King Otto of Greece.svg|Monogram of Otto I\nFile:Royal Monogram of King George I of Greece.svg|Monogram of George I\nFile:Royal Monogram of King Constantine I of Greece.svg|Monogram of Constantine I\nFile:Royal Monogram of King Alexander of Greece.svg|Monogram of Alexander I\nFile:Royal Monogram of King George II of Greece.svg|Monogram of George II\nFile:Royal Monogram of King Paul of Greece.svg|Monogram of Paul I\nFile:Royal Monogram of King Constantine II of Greece.svg|Monogram of Constantine II\nSee also\n* Basileus\n* Greek crown jewels\n* Greek royal family\n* List of heads of state of Greece\n* List of heirs to the Greek throne\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
