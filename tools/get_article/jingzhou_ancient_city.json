Among the 120 chapters of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, there are 72 chapters involving Jingzhou. The well-known stories such as \"Liu Bei borrowed Jingzhou\" and \"Guan Yu carelessly lost Jingzhou\" happened in this city.\nSince the Qin and Han dynasties, the ancient city of Jingzhou has always been an important city where the kings set up their residences. During the Qin dynasty, Jiangling County was set up here. During the Han dynasty, following the Qin system, Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty divided the whole country into thirteen states, and Jingzhou was one of them. At that time, Jingzhou was already one of the top ten commercial cities in the country. After that, Emperor An in the late Eastern Jin dynasty, Emperor Qi He, Emperor Liang Yuan, Emperor Xuan of Later Liang in the Southern dynasty, King Hou Liang in the Sui dynasty, and King Nanping in the late Tang dynasty, etc. Eleven disputed princes successively declared the capital here for more than 100 years.\nStatue of Guan Yu\nStatue of Guan Yu is the first phase of the expansion and upgrading project of Jingzhou Ancient City Historical and Cultural Tourism Zone.
