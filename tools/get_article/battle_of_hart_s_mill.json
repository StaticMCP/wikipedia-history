Captain Joseph Graham under Brigadier General Andrew Pickens was sent to scout the area for British/Loyalist activity. The Patriots discovered a small camp of British and Loyalists at Thomas Hart’s Mill near the Eno River. When dawn broke out the next day, Captain Graham and his men charged, took the camp by surprise and made them disperse. The Patriots took no fatal casualties and the British/Loyalists lost nine killed and wounded and five captured.\nThe Battle was a boost of morale for the Patriot cause and managed to gain the attention of both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Today, there is a State Historical Marker with the name of the mill in Orange County.\nReferences"
