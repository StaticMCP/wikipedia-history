Since its introduction in late 2004, the series has presented Christian-based storylines through 3D animation provided by the, LA based Backyard Digital Studios.\nThe CGI film series, officially titled \"Angel Wars Guardian Force,\" centers on the fundamental theme of the battle between good versus evil. Its target audience is individuals aged six years and older. The characters featured in the series are a mixture of Biblical and fictional angels.\nThe series is a departure from the traditional version of angels such as envisioned by Gustave Doré; the almost mech-armoured angels in this series are more futuristic with fantastical chariot vehicles and glowing weaponry.\nThe Guardian Force, headed by the biblical archangel Michael, are briefed by the unseen Maker, aboard an airship called The Seven. They depart by spreading their wings and flying down to Earth where they battle demonic fallen angels that seek to corrupt humanity. The student angels (Anawim) use wingboards until they earn their wings. The angels and demons (Morg) are invisible to the human eye as they exist on a spiritual plane, unless they take human form. However, the angels can affect the physical world in order to miraculously save humans from danger.\nDVDs\nAngel Wars Episode 1\n*\"About Face\" – Eli and Kira, two junior members of the Guardian Force must grow up in a hurry when their first mission to earth takes a detour, pitting them against Morg, a deadly but long forgotten foe.
