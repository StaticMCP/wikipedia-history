Burbidge (2007, astronomy)\n: For contributions as editor of the Annual Review of Astronomy from 1974 to 2004, using his vast knowledge to make it the premier astronomy review journal worldwide.\n*Peter Vitousek (2006, environmental science)\n: For his scholarly and inspirational book and reviews on nitrogen cycling and its role in the evolving patterns of ecosystem productivity and diversity.\n*Daniel L. Schacter (2005, psychology)\n: For his numerous books and reviews, which illuminate and explain the psychology and neuroscience of human memory for specialists, scientific colleagues, and the public.\n*Donald G. Truhlar (2004, chemical physics)\n: For his incisive reviews on transition-state theory, potential energy surfaces, quantum scattering theory, and solvation models, which have informed and enlightened the chemical physics community for a generation.\n*Stuart H. Hurlbert (2003, ecology)\n: For his lively reviews of species diversity, experimental design, keystone species, and other issues in ecology, which have shaped the work of generations of ecologists.\n*Roy D'Andrade (2002, anthropology)\n: For his creative synthesis of intersections of anthropology with psychology and his insightful interpretations of historical trends shaping the future goals of anthropology.\n*Milton W. Cole (2001, materials science)\n: For his valued reviews and monographs which have critically assessed and inspired novel research concerning electrons and films at surfaces.\n*Charles F. Stevens (2000, neuroscience)\n: For his numerous \"News and Views\" articles in Nature that, for more than a decade, reviewed nearly all the major advances in molecular neuroscience.\n*James M.
