The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally.\nBefore Eurovision\nA Song for Europe 1970\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held the national final on 7 March 1970, presented by Cliff Richard, as part of the BBC1 series ''It's Cliff Richard!.'' Hopkin performed one of the six shortlisted songs each week, before performing all six in succession in the final. These performances were then immediately repeated. The votes were open to the public by post, with the results announced on 14 March, just a week before the Eurovision final itself. The BBC had chosen Welsh singer Mary Hopkin as its representative back in August 1969, having made her name with songs such as \"Those Were the Days\" and \"Goodbye\". At the final, Hopkin was backed by singers John Evans and Brian Bennett, with the orchestra conducted alternately by John Cameron and Johnny Arthey, who directed the orchestra in Amsterdam. Hopkin was allowed to select one song for the contest, this being \"You've Everything You Need\", while the other five were selected from over 200 songs put forward by songwriters. \"You've Everything You Need\" caused a minor scandal on the day of the British final when the Daily Mirror reported that the publishers of that song had told all their staff to send in multiple votes. Whether votes had to be then adjusted by the BBC to avoid a scandal is unknown, but the song ended up being placed second-last. \"Knock, Knock Who's There?\" ultimately became the easy victor with 120,290 votes. The song was written by Geoff Stephens and John Carter. The votes presented below were only announced rounded up.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:left;\"\n|+ A Song for Europe 19707 March 1970\n! scope=\"col\" |Draw\n! scope=\"col\" |Song\n! class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\" |Songwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Votes\n! scope=\"col\" |Place\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |1\n|\"Three Ships\"\n|Doug Flett, Guy Fletcher\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |60,330\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |2\n|\"Early in the Morning of Your Life\"\n|Alan Hawkshaw, Ray Cameron\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |15,090\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |3\n|\"I'm Gonna Fall in Love Again\"\n|Cyril Ornadel, Hal Shaper\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |74,670\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |4\n|\"You've Everything You Need\"\n|Roger Reynolds, Anthony Dyball\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |39,360\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |5\n|\"Can I Believe\"\n|Valerie Avon, Harold Spiro\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |42,160\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |4\n|- style=\"background:gold; font-weight:bold;\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold; background:gold;\" |6\n|\"Knock, Knock Who's There?\"\n|Geoff Stephens, John Carter\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |120,290\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" |1\n|}\nChart success\nHopkin recorded all six entries, with the top two placed being released as a single.
