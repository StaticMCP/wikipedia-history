The railroad began as a project to link Stroudsburg with Port Jervis, New York to the north, with plans to transport coal to New England via the new link. Initial grading on the route began in the 1890s, but it wasn't until 1901 that the newly-organized railroad purchased a locomotive and began construction proper, branching off from the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad at East Stroudsburg. Facing a severe financial downturn, the railroad filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon the line in 1937 after clearing forty dollars in profit in its first two months of the year. Assets were sold off at a price of $30,600.\nPart of the former right of way in Bushkill is now a trail within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area administered by the National Park Service called the Railway Avenue Trail.\nBibliography\n*\nReferences"
