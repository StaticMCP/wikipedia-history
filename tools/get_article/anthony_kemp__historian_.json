Educated at Brighton College, after service in the Royal Air Force, he spent several years in Germany before returning to study modern history at Pembroke College, Oxford. After a short period as a university lecturer, Kemp worked for twelve years as researcher, producer, and director of documentary programmes for British television, notably Television South.\nHe was associated with a number of award-winning documentary productions on the Second World War, including Nan Red, the story of D-Day at Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, Calvados. He was author of numerous books on various aspects of military and contemporary history and was a contributor to several academic journals. He lived in France in the early 1990s, where he was a writer and freelance television director. He published seven books at Éditions Gallimard, including four works in the collection \"Découvertes Gallimard\".\nHe had a keen interest in the commanders of World War II, he authored Men-at-Arms 120: Allied Commanders of World War II and Men-at-Arms 124: German Commanders of World War II, published at Osprey Publishing. In addition to works on military history, Kemp also wrote Witchcraft and Paganism Today back in 1995, and was co-author of Practical Paganism in 1996.\nBibliography\n* Weapons & Equipment of the Marlborough Wars, Blandford Press, 1980\n* The Unknown Battle: Metz, 1944, Stein and Day, 1981\n* Men-at-Arms 120: Allied Commanders of World War II, Osprey Publishing, 1982\n* Men-at-Arms 124: German Commanders of World War II, Osprey Publishing, 1982\n* Springboard for Overlord: Hampshire and the D-Day Landings , Milestone Publications, 1984\n* The Secret Hunters, Michael O’Mara Books, 1986\n* Escape from Berlin, BOXTREE, 1987\n* The Maginot Line: Myth & Reality, Military Heritage Press, 1988\n* Southampton at War, 1939–45, Ensign Publications, 1989\n* The SAS at War, 1941–1945, John Murray Pubs Ltd, 1992\n* The SAS: Savage Wars of Peace, 1947 to the Present, John Murray Pubs Ltd, 1994\n* D-Day: The Normandy Landings and the Liberation of Europe, ‘New Horizons’ series.
