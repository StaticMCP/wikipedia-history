He was the eldest son of the Tangut ruler Li Deming.\nEarly background\nYuanhao was born to Tuoba Weiming's consort, lady Weimu as \"Weimai\" (嵬埋). After his father died in 1032, he became the leader of the Tangut.\nHe was described as a talented army general and had always wanted to establish a country for the Tanguts.\nMilitary campaigns\nEarly in his leadership, Jingzong abolished the surname Zhao which had been given by the Song dynasty, replacing it with the surname Weiming (Chinese: 嵬名, Tangut: ).\nHe had also started a revolution, changing the lifestyles of the Tangut people. He ordered Tangut men to shave their heads or they would face public execution. He also ordered a change of clothing and writing.\nWith the help of Chinese traitors  (張元) and  (吳昊), Jingzong took an aggressive stance with the Song dynasty. At its height, he claimed an army of 500,000 men.\nIn 1034 Jingzong attacked the Huanqing territories (環慶路). He captured Song general Qi Zongju (齊宗矩).\nAt this point, he changed his target to the Kingdom of Qocho in the west, and his efforts against them began in 1036.\nFrom the Uyghurs, he took large portions of Gansu, and the Tangut people would control the Hexi Corridor for 191 years before being conquered by the Yuan dynasty.\nIn 1038 he declared himself the emperor of the Western Xia dynasty whose capital was situated in Xingqing.  Afterwards, he launched a campaign against the Song. Although the Tangut empire won a series of three large battles, the victories proved to be very costly and they found their forces depleted, due in part to a scorched earth policy by the Song. In 1044 the Western Xia dynasty signed a treaty with the Song dynasty resulting in the nominal acknowledgment of Song sovereignty by the Tangut and the payment of tribute by the Song.\nCulture and politics\nThe Emperor led to a reorganization of much of the Empire with the help of ethnic Han advisors. The empire created new departments and administrative services. The Emperor also knew Chinese and had Chinese works translated into his people's language. He accomplished this by supporting the development of a written language for the Tangut people.\nHowever the Tangut script eventually went extinct after the Yuan conquest.\nNevertheless, Emperor Jingzong had strong opposition to the people imitating the Song dynasty too closely. He emphasized the value of their traditional nomadic way of life and discouraged any dependence on Song luxury items. Trade with the Song was minimized or cut off before the peace treaty that came four years before his death. Although Jingzong used talented Song workers, to retain his own power and dynasty, he did not want to be conquered by the Song dynasty.\nLater on the Western Xia emperors would switch between multiple sides, Liao, Song, Jin, and the Mongols, in order to retain their power. Jingzong's attacks weakened the Jin and Song dynasties to the extent that the Mongols would later be able to conquer China. For vacillating between multiple sides, colluding with Mongols and Jurchen, and launching attacks against the Song.\nHowever, the Mongols ultimately crushed the Western Xia dynasty, destroyed nearly any vestige of the empire, and ended Jingzong's reign in Ningxia. The Mongols would then reunify China under the Yuan dynasty.\nSuccession and death\nof Emperor Jingzong (Tailing 泰陵)]]\nIn 1048, both the Prime Minister, Mozang Epang (沒藏訛龐), and Prince Ningling Ge (寧令哥) conspired to assassinate Jingzong. Prince Ningling Ge attempted to kill Jingzong with a sword, but he only managed to slice off Jingzong's nose. Frightened by what he had done, Prince Ningling Ge fled to Mozang for backup, but Mozang betrayed Ningling Ge by turning him in as the assassin.\nAlthough Jingzong initially survived the assassination, he succumbed to his wounds a few days later.\nFamily\nConsorts and Issue:\n* Empress, of the Weimu clan (皇后卫慕氏)\n** First Son\n* Empress Xiancheng, of the Yeli clan (憲成皇后野利氏; d. 1048)\n** Li Ningming, Crown Prince (太子 李寧明, d.1042), 3rd son\n** Li Ningling, Crown Prince (太子 李寧令, 1032 – 1048), 4th son\n** Li Xili (李錫狸), 5th son\n* Empress, of the Muoyi clan (新皇后 沒移氏; d.1049)\n* Empress Xuanmu Huiwen, of the Mozang clan (宣穆惠文皇后 沒藏氏, d.1056)\n**Li Liangzuo, Emperor Yizong (李諒祚 兩岔; 1047 – 1068), 6th son\n* Princess Xingping, of the Khitan Yelü clan (興平公主耶律氏, d. 1038)\n* Lady, of the Suo clan (索氏)\n* Lady, of the Duola clan (多拉氏)\n* Lady, of the Mikemote clan (密克默特氏)\n* Lady, of the Miemi clan (咩迷氏)\n**Li Ali (李阿哩, d.1045),  2nd son\n*Unknown:\n# Princess Li (李氏), 1st daughter\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041217222523/http://www.china10k.com/English/history/5/53/53.htm The Western Xia]"
