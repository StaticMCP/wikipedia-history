The symbol of the ducal power was a sword, while the royal power was represented by the crown.\nOrigins\nModern historians do not share a consensual view on the origins of the Duchy or territorial units administered by members of the royal family within the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. György Györffy writes that the Ducatus or \"Duchy\" developed from the command over the Kabars and other ethnic groups which joined the federation of the Hungarian tribes. According to his opinion, this command was initially, even before the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin around 895, bestowed upon the heir to the supreme head of the Hungarian tribal federation, in accordance with the customs of the Turkic peoples of the Eurasian steppes. Therefore, Györffy continues, the crown prince's command over these ethnic groups transformed, in the course of the 10th century, into his authority over the territories where they settled. Tringli says that it is possible that Koppány's domains in Transdanubia and Saint Emeric's territories (he bore the title of Duke of Russians) were duchies too in accordance with steppe tradition. On the other hand, Gyula Kristó, who rejected Györffy's theory, writes that the Duchy only came into being when King Andrew I of Hungary granted one third of his kingdom to his younger brother, Béla around 1048. He cites the Illuminated Chronicle which clearly states that this was the \"first division of the kingdom\".\nClifford Rogers argues that possession of the Duchy owes its roots to the tradition of senioratus. The dukes regarded the control of the duchy as a pathway to the throne.\nTerritories\nThe exact borders of the Duchy have not been determined yet. The counties entrusted to the members of the ruling dynasty did not form a separate province within the kingdom, but they were organized around two or three centers. The duchy made up one-third of the kingdom's territory.\nThe eastern block of the counties were located around Bihar (), a city that was also the see of a Roman Catholic diocese in that time. The north-western parts of the territories were centered around Nyitra (, ). A third possible center of the territories was Krassó, a fortress destroyed later in the first half of the 13th century, located near to the present-day Dupljaja in Serbia.\nThe dukes' principal hunting-grounds lay in the \"Holy Forest\" (Igyfon) on the territory of the Apuseni Mountains (today in Romania) in the 11th century.\nDukes\nThe list of the members of the Árpád dynasty who were dukes of the Ducatus (\"Tercia pars regni\") follows:\n* Béla the Champion / the Bison (1048–1060)\n* Géza (1064–1074)\n* Saint Ladislaus (1064–1077)\n* Lampert (1064- cca. 1095)\n* Álmos (1095/1096-1107)\n* Stephen (1162–1163)\nSee also\n*Principality of Nitra\nSources\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle: Chronica de Gestis Hungarorum (Edited by Dezső Dercsényi) (1970).
