Produced by Michael and Phil Ramone, it was his only album of cover versions. It consists mainly of old jazz standards plus new interpretations of more recent popular songs, such as \"Roxanne\" by the Police and \"Miss Sarajevo\" by U2 and Brian Eno with Luciano Pavarotti. Both songs were released as promotional singles.\nHistory\nThis album is the only album in Michael's entire solo catalogue to not reach number one on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number two instead. It was kept off the top spot by Shania Twain's Come On Over.\nA music video for \"Roxanne\" was shot in Amsterdam, in the so-called Red District, using ordinary people, not actors, who really live their lives on the street.\nAnother version exists of the album's opening track, \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\", sung by Michael with Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti at one of his famous \"Pavarotti and Friends\" live shows. This version is included on the limited edition of Michael's 2006 greatest hits album, Twenty Five.\nTrack listing\n#\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" (E.Y.
