It is the 5th entry in the Super Robot Wars series and the last entry in the Classic Timeline. It was first released on March 17, 1995, and received mostly positive reception, with reviewers highly praising the improvements from the last game while criticizing the game's increased difficulty. The game was ported to the Sony PlayStation and released on January 26, 1996, under the name .\nThe game was partially remade and divided into two parts under the name  on September 25, 1997, for the Sega Saturn and on December 10, 1998, for the PlayStation. The sequel,  was released later on April 23, 1998, for the Sega Saturn and on April 15, 1999, for the PlayStation. The game also became available for the PlayStation Network on July 6, 2011 (4 Scramble) and November 19, 2011 (Both F and F Final).\nGameplay\nGameplay of 4th Super Robot Wars is literally similar to its predecessor, Super Robot Wars EX which uses battle sprites for animations. When a stage begins, the character receives introductory dialogue between playable characters, leading to the scenario on the battle field. To complete a scenario, the player must accomplish scenario objectives. Some scenarios are longer, with multi-part missions or have new objectives added as the story unfolds. On battle field, the player and enemy take turns to order their units with commands available, such as movement, attacking, forming squads and casting \"Spirit Commands\", a set of magic-like spells unique to each pilot. Once the scenario is cleared, more dialogue is exchanged between characters before the player is taken to an intermission menu. Here, units can be upgraded or optional parts installed, characters' stats and skills can be changed or upgraded, and other maintenance actions can be performed before the player continues on with the game.\nStory\nNote: The story is from the Remake Version.\n4 Months has passed since the Inspector Conflict, the Earth Sphere is once again at peace.

Banpresto had been unable to acquire the license before, but Sega was a main sponsor for the show.  Persistence in asking and the game being on Saturn helped ensure F was able to get the Eva rights.\nAccording to Terada, the split of the Saturn version into F and F Final was not planned.  Rather, Banpresto had a hard ship date to hit that could not be moved, but the game was the team's first experience programming for the Saturn.  It became clear late in development that the game wasn't finished yet.  The result was splitting the game into two, and adding a \"preview\" flash-forward mission of Final to F so that robots featured on the cover who did not appear in the first half of the game could appear at least somewhere in F.  Despite some bugs that crept into the published versions due to the time crunch, Terada said it ultimately worked out; he said that the president of Winkysoft told him that the company would have closed and run out of money had Terada not suggested splitting the game.\nInfluence\nThe game became a huge influence to future Super Robot Wars Games and also to some series that debuted in the game. The game itself marks the first appearance of Shin Getter Robo from the Getter Robo Go manga in any medium. The remake version also debuted the Mazinkaiser, an variant of the Mazinger Z created by Go Nagai before becoming its own series in 2001.\nThe storyline of 4/F/F Final has also been used in the Original Generation games, with the most notable being in 2nd Super Robot Wars Original Generation.\nReception\nReception of the game is mostly positive, Famicom Tsūshin scored the Super Famicom version of the game a 31 out of 40.\nAccording to Famitsu, Super Robot Taisen F Final for the Sega Saturn sold 498,009 units in Japan during the first half of 1998. This made it the country's ninth-best-selling game for the period.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* (archived)"
