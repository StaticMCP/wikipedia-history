It took place on 4 August 2022 in Adelaide.\nThe nominations were revealed on 18 May 2022 with all material being released in 2021.\nOwusu won three awards from three nominations. In a video acceptance speech after winning Independent Album of the Year, Owusu said, \"I poured everything that I had into the making of this album, simply for my own sanity and mental well-being, so the fact that it's being recognised by so many young people globally and industry-wise is insane to me. And I'm humble and grateful for it.\"\nThe late Warren Costello was honoured with the 2022 Outstanding Achievement Award, being recognised for his more than 30 years spent supporting independent artists and labels, including time spent as the managing director for Liberation Music.\nPerformances\n*Jesswar\n*Telenova\n*Teenage Joans\n*Jaguar Jonze\n*Andrew Swift\nreference:\nNominees and winners\nAIR Awards\nWinners indicated in boldface, with other nominees in plain.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=\"150%\"\n|-\n!
