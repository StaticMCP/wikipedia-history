The Battle of Žuč was one of the keys to the defense of Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina in aggression. On that day, the aggressor's intention to divide Sarajevo into two parts was destroyed. The goal of the ARBiH operation was to break through the encirclement and join forces with the ARBiH on the other side of the city. The plan for carrying out the operation was brought by the Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command of the ARBiH, Sefer Halilović, and the units were commanded by Mustafa Hajrulahović Talijan. The attack directions were the Žuč plateau with the elevation of Orlić, Kobilja Glava and Poljine, Kromolj and Orlovac, Gazin Han and Obhodža, Vidikovac (Trebević) and Vraca. Combat operations began at 5:00&nbsp;a.m. The attack directions are the Žuč plateau with the dominant elevation of Orlić, Kobilja Glava and Poljine, Kromolj and Orlovac, Gazin Han and Obhodža, Vidikovac (Trebević), and Vraca. ARBiH breaks through the Serbian lines around Sarajevo in all directions of attack; Kromolj, Trebević, Vraca, Žuč.\nFinal phase and aftermath\nSignificant amounts of weapons and ammunition, military equipment, and medical supplies were confiscated. It confirmed the ARBiH victory in the ongoing Battle of Pofalići and secured and strengthened communication with the defenders from the Vogošća area, i.e., the settlements of Ugorsko, Bušće, and Kobilja Glava. After the conquest of Orlić, Kota 850, Vis, and Golo Brdo were also captured.\nLegacy\nThe Battle of Žuč's significance led to the establishment of the \"Wings of Freedom\" () memorial complex, commemorating both the battle itself and its broader historical importance during the Siege of Sarajevo. This monument stands as a testament to the crucial role the battle played in preserving Sarajevo's unity and defending Bosnia and Herzegovina's sovereignty.\nReferences"
