Stewart Secondary School is a public secondary school located in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1967 and is located on  bordering on the Otonabee River. It is a member of the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board.\nHistory\nThe school is named after Thomas Alexander Stewart (1786-1847). Thomas and his wife, Frances Browne Stewart (1794-1872), emigrated to Canada with their children and Thomas's brother-in-law and former business partner, Robert Reid, and his family. The party of 27 set sail from Belfast Lough on June 1, 1822. Seven weeks were spent on the ship before reaching Quebec. From Quebec they traveled to Kingston, and then on to York, where Stewart and Reid were each granted , provided they settled in a township. Douro Township in Peterborough County was suggested as a promising region. On September 9, 1822, Stewart and Reid traveled to the area with surveyor Richard Birdsall, and each chose land on the Otonabee River. Thomas and Frances developed their home, \"Auburn,\" on Lot 2, Concession XII, raising a family of 10 children to adulthood and assisting other settlers. Thomas Stewart became a prominent and influential citizen in the area until his death in 1847 from typhoid fever.\nThe school opened in 1967 as Thomas A. Stewart Secondary School and Auburn Vocational School. The vocational school later closed. The office for Auburn became the guidance office, the cafeteria became a dance studio, and the library became the head office for the Peterborough Regional Integrated Arts Program. The integrated arts program moved to Stewart in 2012 after the closing of Peterborough Collegiate Vocational School.\nCampus and facilities\nThe school is located on  bordering on the Otonabee River. The building has a 219,238 sq. ft. of floor space containing 59 classrooms. The auditorium can hold 800 students.
