He made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham in 1933, taking two catches and scoring 0 and 5. He appeared thrice more that summer, taking a single catch and scoring two runs in his final two innings.\nIn 1934 Baker was Worcestershire's regular wicket-keeper, a deliberate decision made by the county to allow Bernard Quaife to play as a specialist batsman. Baker played 28 times that summer, and ended the year with 38 dismissals (33 caught; five stumped), claiming a maximum of four dismissals in a single game, against Somerset in June.\nBaker played no first-class cricket after the 1934 season.\nMilitary life\nHe was a captain in 17/21 Royal Lancers, was in the home forces from 1940/42 spending some time at Thetford. He was sent to North Africa Sudan/Tunis where he was wounded in his tank. He stayed in the army until the end of the war at home and spent some time at Debden where he was billeted at Shortgrove, Newport.\nPersonal life\nHe married Winifred Marion Smith on 8 April 1940.\nHe worked in his father's business, Stanley of Colmore Row. As well as cricket he played rugby for the West Midlands.\nNotes\nReferences\n*[http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/27/27627/27627.html Edward Baker] from CricketArchive\n*"
