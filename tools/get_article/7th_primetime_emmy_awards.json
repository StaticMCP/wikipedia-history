The ceremony was held at the \"Moulin Rouge Nightclub\" in Hollywood, California.  The ceremony, hosted by Steve Allen and broadcast on NBC, was the first Emmy Awards ceremony to be televised nationally. All nominations are listed, with winners in bold and series' networks are in parentheses.\nNew categories for this ceremony included awards for writing and directing, as well as one-time performances in anthology series, (this category would eventually morph into the current guest-acting category). Studio One was the most successful show of the night, winning three awards.\nFredric March made Emmy history when he became the first actor to be nominated for two different works in the same category. However, he lost for both of his performances in the category of Best Actor in a Single Performance.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (‡).\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Make Room for Daddy (ABC)'\n** The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show (CBS)\n** I Love Lucy (CBS)\n** Mister Peepers (NBC)\n** Our Miss Brooks (CBS)\n** Private Secretary (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The United States Steel Hour (ABC)'\n** Four Star Playhouse (CBS)\n** Medic (NBC)\n** The Philco Television Playhouse (NBC)\n** Studio One (CBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Disneyland (ABC)'\n** The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS)\n** The George Gobel Show (NBC)\n** The Jack Benny Program (CBS)\n** The Jackie Gleason Show (CBS)\n** Your Hit Parade (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'This Is Your Life (NBC)'\n** Masquerade Party (ABC)\n** People Are Funny (NBC)\n** ''What's My Line?
