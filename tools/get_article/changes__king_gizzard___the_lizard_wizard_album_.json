It is the third album the band released during October 2022 and fifth and final album to be released overall during the year.\nBackground and recording\nOn 18 June 2022, the band posted a tweet promising three more albums by the end of 2022. More details came on 12 July, when it was reported that the last album was \"something Gizzard has been working on since 2017 – the longest amount of time the band has ever spent on a single record.\" Mackenzie stated that \"There isn't a jamming vibe on it. It's super considered, for a Gizz record. Every overdub and every part is important\", and described the record as \"more of a song cycle\".\nThe album was first conceived in 2017. That same year, the band released five studio albums. Changes was supposed to be the final one, however the band didn't think the album was finished, and instead released Gumboot Soup. The eventual release of the album contains \"Exploding Suns\" as it was recorded back in 2017.\nAs stated by band member Stu Mackenzie: \"Every song is built around this one chord progression – every track is like a variation on a theme.\" The band had been \"tinkering with\" Changes since then, calling the album \"not necessarily our most complex record, but every little piece and each sound you hear has been thought about a lot.\"\nThe overall sound of the album was described as \"soaked in the warm sonics of 70s R'n'B and guided by simple chord-changes that contain multitudes\". It was also noted that the first letter of each song title on Changes spells out the album's title.\nChanges was originally going to be one long song. That became the album's 13-minute opening track \"Change\", which was described as an \"odyssey touching on kaleidoscopic '60s pop, color-splattered prog-rock fireworks, and floaty, keyboard-driven retro R&B\". Mackenzie described the following songs as building out of the first track: \"'Hate Dancin is built out of one of the chord progressions from 'Change'. And then 'Astroturf' is built out of one of the chord progressions in \"Change\" as well. And so is 'Short Change', the last song. Every song on the album is built out of a section of 'Change.'\nThe band photo of the album cover was shot at Jardins de les Tres Xemeneies park in Barcelona, Spain.\nRelease\nOn 7 September, it was revealed that copies of the album will be available at the band's show at the Orpheum in New Orleans, on 27 October, a day ahead of the album's release date.\nA music video for the first single \"Hate Dancin'\", directed by John Angus Stuart, was released on 17 October.\nThe album was released on 28 October.\nCritical reception\n| rev3 = Louder Than War\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Pitchfork\n| rev4score = 7.2/10\n| rev5 = Uncut\n| rev5score = 8/10\n}}\nIn the review for AllMusic, Tim Sendra described that albums as being, \"weird and familiar at once, like exploring the moon from the safety of your own couch.\" and claimed that, \"King Gizzard are never less than compelling, and even when their concepts are modest, they deliver a final product that's psychedelic pop/rock/funk/soul/prog/what have you at its very best.\"  ''Louder Than War's'' Wayne Carey also drew comparisons to other releases in the band's oeuvre, claiming that, \"King Gizz continue to surprise with each release. Three albums in a month including Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava, Laminated Denim and now Changes. I could only review one and I think this album speaks for them all. An absolute treasure on the music scene and not a bad release yet as far as I'm concerned. A stunning collection of work that continues to surprise.\"\nReviewing the album for Uncut, Maclay Heriot stated that, \"Changes underscores its makers' commitment to evolution\".\nTrack listing\nVinyl releases have tracks 1–2 on side A, and 3–7 on side B.\n| length1 = 13:03\n| title2 = Hate Dancin'\n| writer2 =\n| length2 = 3:16\n| title3 = Astroturf\n| writer3 =\n| length3 = 7:33\n| title4 = No Body\n| writer4 = Mackenzie\n| length4 = 3:42\n| title5 = Gondii\n| writer5 = Mackenzie\n| length5 = 4:57\n| title6 = Exploding Suns\n| writer6 =\n| length6 = 4:40\n| title7 = Short Change\n| writer7 = Mackenzie\n| length7 = 2:50\n| total_length = 40:01\n}}\nPersonnel\n1.Change\n*Stu Mackenzie – Co-Lead vocals, Wurlitzer, synthesiser, drums, vibraphone, guitar, bass guitar, Mellotron, keyboards, organ\n* Michael Cavanagh – drums\n* Ambrose Kenny-Smith – Co-Lead Vocals, percussion, keyboards\n* Cook Craig – Co-Lead Vocals, synthesiser, keyboard, Electric guitar\n* Joey Walker – Co-Lead vocals, synthesiser, Electric guitar\n2.Hate Dancin’\n*Stu Mackenzie – vocals, Wurlitzer, synthesiser, Electric Guitar, Bass, organ\n* Michael Cavanagh – drums\n* Ambrose Kenny-Smith – Vocals, percussion\n* Joey Walker – Synthesizers\n3.Astroturf\n*Stu Mackenzie – vocals, Wurlitzer, synthesiser, Bass, Mellotron, keyboards, organ, flute\n* Michael Cavanagh – drums\n* Ambrose Kenny-Smith – Vocals, percussion, Keyboards, Saxophone\n* Joey Walker –Electric guitar, Synthesizers\n4.No Body\n*Stu Mackenzie – vocals, Electric Guitar, Bass, Wurlitzer, synthesiser\n* Michael Cavanagh – drums\n* Ambrose Kenny-Smith – Vocals, percussion, keyboards\n5.Gondii\n*Stu Mackenzie – vocals, Wurlitzer, synthesiser\n* Michael Cavanagh – drums\n* Ambrose Kenny-Smith – Vocals, percussion\n* Cook Craig – Synthesizers\n* Joey Walker – Synthesizers\n6.Exploding Suns\n*Stu Mackenzie – vocals, Wurlitzer, synthesiser\n* Michael Cavanagh – drums\n* Ambrose Kenny-Smith – Vocals, percussion\n* Cook Craig – Synthesizers, Bass\n7.Short Change\n*Stu Mackenzie – vocals, Wurlitzer, synthesiser\n* Michael Cavanagh – drums\n* Ambrose Kenny-Smith – Percussion\nProduction\n* Stu Mackenzie – recording (tracks 1–5, 7), mixing, production\n* Nico Wilson – recording (track 1)\n* Sam Joseph − recording (track 6)\n* Joe Carra – mastering\n* Jason Galea – photography, design\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Changes\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2022)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Progressive Albums (OCC)\n|13\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Album Sales (Billboard)\n| 44\n|}\nReferences"
