Woodward's art was not restricted to children's books; her portfolio includes numerous works of fiction and humor for adults. Although most noted for her watercolor illustrations, she painted in oil and  was a children's portrait artist.\nShe was born in Worcester, Massachusetts February 10, 1898. Her parents were Rufus and Stella Woodward. She was educated at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and in Paris.\nIn 1948 she was given a Caldecott Medal for her illustrations of Roger and the Fox written by Lavinia R. Davis and again in 1950 for The Wild Birthday Cake.\nIn 1953 Woodward painted a mural on the wall of the Center School cafeteria in Brookfield, Connecticut near her residence in Hawleyville.\nShe began to lose her sight in the 1960, but didn't stop painting. When she went blind she developed a method of \"painting by touch\".\nWoodward never married or had children. She died in December 1977 in Connecticut.\nHer papers are held at the University of Southern Mississippi and the Children's Literature Research Collection at the University of Minnesota house copies of her original artwork.\nBibliography\n* Little World-Children (Ginn, 1928) — written by Elizabeth Ellis Scantlebury\n* The Blue Teapot: Sandy Cove Stories (The Macmillan Company, 1931) — written by Alice Dalgliesh\n* P-Penny and His Little Red Cart (Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co., 1934) — written by Amy Wentworth Stone\n* Everyday Children (Oxford University Press, 1935)\n* In Storyland (Lothrop, Lee and Shepard Co., 1936) — written by Ruth Irma Low\n* ''Here's Juggins (Lothrop, Lee and Shepard, 1936) — written by Amy Wentworth Stone\n* Little Miss Capo (Macmillan, 1937) — written by Frances Gaither\n* Exploring New Fields (Houghton Mifflin Company, 1938) — written by Beryl Parker; Julia M Harris; Hildegard Woodward; P O Palmstrom\n* It Happened in England (Albert Whitman, 1939) — written by Marian King\n* The Chosen Baby (Carrick and Evans, 1939) — written by Valentina Pavlovna Wasson\n* Yammy Buys a Bicycle (Albert Whitman & Co, 1940) — written by Bernice Morgan Bryant\n* Jared's Blessing'' (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1942)\n* Roundabout, Another Sandy Cove Story (Macmillan, 1942) — written by Alice Dalgliesh\n* Round Robin (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1943) — written by Lavinia R.
