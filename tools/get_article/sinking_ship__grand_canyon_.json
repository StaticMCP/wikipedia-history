This butte is situated  southeast of the Grandview Point overlook on the canyon's South Rim, and  southwest of Coronado Butte. Topographic relief is significant as it rises  above the Colorado River in . According to the Köppen climate classification system, Sinking Ship is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone.\nEtymology\nThis geographical feature was named \"Three Castles\" before its present name was officially adopted in 1932 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The descriptive name is because the dip or tilt of the strata, caused by bending movement of the rock, creates the appearance of a ship sinking into the canyon. The name is attributable to M. R. (Miner Raymond) Tillotson (1886–1955), superintendent of Grand Canyon National Park from 1922 to 1938.\nGeology\nThe summit of Sinking Ship is composed of Kaibab Limestone caprock overlaying cream-colored, cliff-forming, Permian Coconino Sandstone. The sandstone, which is the third-youngest of the strata in the Grand Canyon, was deposited 265&nbsp;million years ago as sand dunes. Below the Coconino Sandstone is slope-forming, Permian Hermit Formation, which in turn overlays the Pennsylvanian-Permian Supai Group. Further down are strata of Mississippian Redwall Limestone, and Cambrian Tonto Group. Whereas most strata of the Grand Canyon are normally horizontal, at Sinking Ship the strata have been shifted by the Cremation Fault and a monocline. This Precambrian fault was dormant until reawakened during the Laramide orogeny. The eastward tilt of Sinking Ship is due to its position astride the axis of the Grandview-Phantom monocline. Precipitation runoff from Sinking Ship drains north into the nearby Colorado River via Hance Creek.\nGallery\nFile:Sunset lighting the Sinking Ship.jpg|Sunset illuminating Sinking Ship\nFile:Sinking Ship - Grandview Point - Grand Canyon.jpg|West aspect from Grandview Point\nFile:Sinking Ship, southeast aspect.jpg|From the southeast.\nFile:Sinking Ship crop.jpg|Sinking Ship, looking like \"Three Castles\"\nFile:Grand Canyon Desert View Drive 0540P (5983050916).jpg|Coronado Butte centered, with Sinking Ship to left and shaded.\nSee also\n* Geology of the Grand Canyon area\n* The Battleship (Grand Canyon)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Weather forecast: [https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lon=-111.958838&lat=35.990577#.YCofHjKSmUm National Weather Service]\n* Sinking Ship photo: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/nateschuknecht/4943986197/in/photolist-8wTdRk-9s2d8D-ffR25K-9ZWS1e-4QFbQT-4QFc2n-7Lacc9-4QFbag-fmHyXr-fmXHZL-fmXGUo-ffBAAf-fbDuqB-KDoLs5-fjcPLR-fiCzXY-fjcQxg-fnc6Hc-fhnW5C-fetxfC-2k1JCYX-2kmeg53-fhMefT-fnc7KX-fmXJWs-fiomr8-fcXAYf-fQgYu3-dGvPef-fcf3r7-fi2uKW-fkHTeN-9Jfooi-fbTMP3-ffR39n-fmXHjG-fjs2HC-ovvXcX-fbDtVn-fcHghT-fcf2zo-fcf4pQ-vhZ7q-feefPM-fetxTU-fktJeM-feefbF-9s5bkJ-fhMd4F-fcXBAN Flickr]\n* Buffalo Bill and John Hance at Sinking Ship: [https://archive.library.nau.edu/digital/collection/p16748coll2/id/99 1892 photo]\n* [https://archive.library.nau.edu/digital/collection/cpa/id/72139/rec/4002 Sinking Ship photo] by Harvey Butchart"
