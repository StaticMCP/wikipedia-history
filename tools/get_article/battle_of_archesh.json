The battle was the final event of Heraclius Caucasus campaign, after which the Byzantine army went on the offensive deep into the territory of the Sasanian Empire.\nBackground\nDuring the Heraclius Caucasus campaign, after the defeat of the united Persian army of Shahin, Shahrvaraz and Shahraplakan, Heraclius moved to Persia, but Shahin and Shahrvaraz gathered the remnants of the surviving army, united and decided to give battle to Heraclius again. Having received information that the Lazi and Abasgi broke the alliance with the Romans and went home, the Persians decided to attack the army of Heraclius. After a while, the armies met and stood opposite each other until the evening, without taking any action.When evening came, the Byzantine emperor continued on his way, and the Sassanids followed him,they wanted to shorten the path, but ended up in a swampy area, thanks to which Heraclius entered Persarmenia, local residents learned about this and joined Shahrvaraz's army. With the onset of winter, the people scattered throughout their lands, which Heraclius took advantage of in the future.\nBattle\nHeraclius started the battle at night. He divided his army and headed towards the settlement of Salbanon.There he killed almost the entire Persian army, and Shahrvaraz, leaving all his equipment, mounted a horse and fled.They took the\narms of Shahrvaraz, namely his golden shield, his dagger, spear, gold belt set with\nprecious stones, and boots. When Heraclius had taken these things, he moved against\nthe men scattered in the villages. These men, on learning of the flight of Shahrvaraz,\nalso fled without restraint. He pursued them, killed or captured many of them,\nwhilst the remainder returned to Persia in disgrace. As for the emperor, he joyfully\ncollected his army and wintered in those parts.\nAftermath\nAfter this battle, Heraclius and his army moved deep into the Sasanian empire, beginning the final stage of this war.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
