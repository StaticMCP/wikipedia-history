Contner and written by Matthew Chernov and David Rosiak, the film stars Daryl Hannah, John Schneider and Armand Assante. It was released to generally unfavorable reviews. It is the eleventh film in the Maneater film series.\nPlot\nCorporate real estate tycoon Hamilton Lux (Armand Assante) sets his sights on developing the quaint seaside town of Full Moon Bay, California into a prime getaway for the wealthy, but runs into some unexpected problems. Lifelong fisherman Daniel Wilder (John Schneider) and wife Brooke (Daryl Hannah) own property exactly where Lux wants to build high-priced condos, and are not planning to sell. Lux secretly laces the local waters with a toxin deadly to marine life, devastating the local fishing industry in an attempt to starve Daniel out. Alas, the toxin has a different effect on the area's sharks, drastically increasing their aggression and causing them to move in coordinated swarms. Without fish for them to feed on, shark attacks on humans rapidly increase. Lux uses media contacts to paint the attacks as random incidents. Daniel, his marine biologist brother, and a concerned E.P.A. agent must expose Lux's plan and rid the area of the chemically altered sharks before the town's entire population is devoured by hungry sharks.\nCast\nCritical reception\nShark Swarm has been widely panned.\nSee also\n* List of killer shark films\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.today/20070808164933/http://www.rhifilms.com/property.php?propertyId=SSwarm Official RHI Entertainment Shark Swarm website]\n* [http://www.geniusproducts.com/maneaterseries/shark_swarm_tp.html Official Genius Entertainment Shark Swarm site]\n*\n*"
