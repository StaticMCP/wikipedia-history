Communities served include Ida Grove, Arthur, Battle Creek and Odebolt.\nHistory\nThe former Odebolt–Arthur Community School District and the Battle Creek–Ida Grove Community School District, in 2009, started a \"grade sharing\" in which the districts sent their children to the same high school and shared personnel. There was a previous attempt to merge the districts in fall 2016, but voters from Odebolt–Arthur voted it down out of fear that their school would close. There were tensions between the Odebolt–Arthur and Battle Creek–Ida Grove communities. By 2018 the merger was approved.\nSchools\n* OABCIG High School (Ida Grove)\n* OABCIG Middle School (Odebolt)\n* OABCIG Elementary Odebolt (Odebolt)\n* OABCIG Elementary Ida Grove (Ida Grove)\nOABCIG High School\nAthletics\nThe Falcons compete in the Western Valley Activities Conference in the following sports:\n*Cross Country\n*Volleyball\n*Football\n** 2019 Class 2A State Champions\n** 2020 Class 1A State Champions\n*Basketball\n** Girls' 2011 Class 2A State Champions\n*Wrestling\n*Track and Field\n*Golf\n*Baseball\n*Softball\nNotable alumni\n*Cooper DeJean - Defensive back for the Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl LIX champion\n*A.
