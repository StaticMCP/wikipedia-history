It was signed by Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, on behalf of the British and diplomat Hendrik Fagel, on behalf of the Dutch.\nThe British only left Java and Sumatra in 1821, at which point the Dutch soon became entangled in colonial wars in Java.\nTerms\nPossessions\nThe treaty returned the colonial possessions of the Dutch as they were at 1 January 1803, before the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, with the exception of the Cape of Good Hope and the South American settlements of Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, where the Dutch retained trading rights.\nIn addition, the British ceded the island of Banca off the island of Sumatra in exchange for the settlement of Cochin in India and its dependencies on the coast of Malabar. The Dutch also ceded the district of Bernagore, situated close to Calcutta, in exchange for an annual fee.\nCooperation\nThe treaty also noted a declaration of 15 June 1814 by the Dutch, slave ships were no longer permitted in British ports. That restriction would be extended to a ban on the involvement of Dutch subjects in the Atlantic slave trade. Britain also agreed to pay £1,000,000 to Sweden to resolve a claim to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.\nThe British and the Dutch agreed to spend £2,000,000 each on improving the defences of the Low Countries. More funds, of up to £3,000,000, are mentioned for the \"final and satisfactory settlement of the Low Countries in union with Holland.\"\nDisputes arising from the treaty were the subject of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824.\nSee also\n* Anglo-Dutch Slave Trade Treaty\n* Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824\n* Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870–1871\nReferences\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
