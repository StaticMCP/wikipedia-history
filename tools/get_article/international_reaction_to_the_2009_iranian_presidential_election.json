Most Western countries expressed concern, while most countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa that expressed any opinion congratulated Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for his victory. The UN and EU also expressed concern about the aftermath.\nNotably, the Austrian diplomats admitted his mission to Iran was in like with EU policy on Iran and in support of efforts to gather intelligence in the country after the election.\nDomestic political reactions\nMir-Hossein Mousavi has not asked for any kind of foreign assistance or called on other leaders to comment. His spokesperson, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, has criticised U.S. President Barack Obama for maintaining that the difference between Ahmadinejad and Mousavi \"may not be as great as has been advertised.\" Makhmalbaf retorted, \"Does he like it himself [when someone is] saying that there is no difference between Obama and [George W.] Bush?\" He also said that other nations must \"not recognize the government of Ahmadinejad as a legitimate government\" and that \"it's not only an internal matter- it's an international problem\".\nThe Iranian government has made protests to representatives from the United Kingdom, France, and the Czech Republic for what it sees as their meddling in internal Iranian affairs. The British ambassador to Tehran was summoned to the Iranian Foreign Affairs Ministry on 17 June where Iranian officials deplored international media coverage of the protests. The United Kingdom expelled two Iranian diplomats after Iran expelled two British diplomats, whom Iran accused of spying.\nIn January 2010, Mohammed Reza Heydari, an Iranian diplomat in Oslo, resigned his post and was granted asylum by Norway.\nOver a year after the election and subsequent protests the number two diplomat at Iran's Finland embassy resigned saying \"The situation got worse because...my people are being killed still. I won't go back to Iran because I could face capital punishment. I will stay abroad as a political activist.\" A few days later, Farzad Farhangian resigned as the press attache to the Iranian embassy in Belgium and sought asylum in Norway. He said he wanted to \"take a stand in support of the Iranian people and the [opposition] movement.\" He also said the turning point for him was after the election, since when he could not \"come to any agreement\" with the ambassador at the embassy. He added that \"We have had a lot of arguments since last year.\"\nCountries\nExpressions of concern\n* On 16 June, Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith called for a fast, thorough and transparent investigation of the vote-rigging allegations. \"It is now crystal clear that there are very grave doubts about the result so far as the Iranian election is concerned,\" Mr Smith told Parliament. \"We are very gravely concerned about the very serious breaches of human rights we have seen.\"\n* Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon said that his country was \"deeply concerned\" by reports of election irregularities. On 15 June, Cannon told Parliament: \"We have called for a full and transparent investigation into electoral fraud and discrepancies. The security force's brutal treatment of peaceful demonstrators is unacceptable.\" Canada also summoned Iran's top diplomat to explain the reported beating and detention of a freelance Canadian journalist in Tehran.\n* The charge d'affaires for the Czech Republic has called for an inquiry on the election results.\n* The Danish government has summoned Iran's ambassador to protest against post-election violence.\n* Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb summoned the Iranian Ambassador Reza Nazarahari and stated Finland's unreserved condemnation concerning the use of violence by the authorities. Subb made an appeal for a peaceful settlement of the situation and the implementation of freedom of speech and opinion. In addition, he urged Iran to free the imprisoned opposition leaders and recount the votes cast in the Presidential elections in order to clear the suspicions concerning the election results presented in the country.\n* French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner expressed worries with the election results. He also told that it \"was the opportunity for Ahmadinejad to open discussions\" but, instead, they used brutality. On 15 June, his office summoned the Iranian Ambassador to France to talk about the vote-tampering allegations. On 16 June, President Nicolas Sarkozy branded Iran's election result a \"fraud,\" saying the subsequent unrest was a direct result of Ahmadinejad's failings in his first term.\n* German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that \"the German government is very concerned about the current situation.\" The chancellor demanded more information from Iranian authorities on the elections and the following unrest, saying the allegations of election fraud called for a \"transparent investigation.\" She also criticised the use of \"completely unacceptable force against protesters,\" the \"wave of arrests\" during the demonstrations and the fact that foreign media were being hampered from reporting on the developments.  Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier summoned the Iranian ambassador Monday to explain the disputed presidential election. \"I have already prompted Iran, together with European colleagues today, to quickly shed light on what has happened there—if one can take the announced election results there seriously or not,\" he told German public television station ARD.  As of June 2009 it was reported that German companies have fled Iran following riots.\n* Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has said, \"I'm not sure if the results reflect the real will of the Iranian people\". He also has labeled Ahmadinejad's re-election \"bad news\". Israel's deputy foreign ministry spokesman, Danny Ayalon, said: \"With the results of the election in Iran, the international community must stop a nuclear Iran and Iranian terror immediately. If there was a shadow of a hope for change in Iran, the renewed choice of Ahmadinejad expresses more than anything the growing Iranian threat.\"\n* Italy's foreign minister has said G8 countries will adopt a \"tough\" stance towards Iran over post-election unrest. Franco Frattini said Iran was \"at a turning point\" following the post-election street clashes, in which at least 17 people have been killed. \"It must choose whether or not to keep the door open to dialogue with the international community,\" he said. \"The hand extended by the United States, which we have supported, cannot come back with blood on it. \"We will adopt a particularly tough and clear position.\"\n* Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone said on 16 June: \"We are extremely concerned about the confusion in Iran. We are carefully monitoring the situation... We hear about shootings. We hope that the situation will come to an end as soon as possible.\"\n* On 16 June, Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen summoned an Iranian diplomat to protest Tehran's crackdown on protesters and to call for the immediate release of detainees. According to a statement issued by Verhagen's office after the meeting, the minister asked Iran to probe complaints of election fraud as the Netherlands had \"serious question marks\" over the reliability of the results. He also protested against interference with foreign journalists and the arrest of a Dutch television crew, and demanded an explanation from the Iranian authorities for the intimidation and seizure of footage of Dutch journalists.\n* On 16 June, Foreign Minister of New Zealand Murray McCully said: \"The New Zealand government is concerned at the reports coming out of Iran of mounting violence, and calls on all involved to help restore calm... New Zealand shares the view of United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and several European Union leaders, that the election process needs to be carefully explained.\"\n* Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said: \"There is much unrest in Iran around the results, and there are allegations of electoral fraud. This is alarming\". He also said that they would have to take the results that has been released under advisement, and stressed that there had not been fully democratic election in Iran, saying that: \"This is about candidates that have had to go through a pre-approval to be allowed to be candidates, and this can not be said to be acceptable from normal democratic standards\". Mazyar Keshvari, an Iranian-Norwegian politician for the Progress Party, called the election \"a huge farce from start to finish\" and a \"show-off\", and said that \"Ahmadinejad exceeds Comical Ali with his statements about the election in Iran was entirely free.\"\n* Polish Foreign Ministry announced that \"[The ministry] calls government in Tehran to avoid actions which could result in bloodspill, and also expects the government to take responsibility of finding peaceful solution of the crisis, according to its obligations within international community.\"\n* On 18 June, the Foreign Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt stated in a public pronouncement concerning the violence: \"It is obvious that this is totally unacceptable ... [I]t is now of utter importance that the authorities respect the complaints which have been directed at the election and the counting of votes; and handle those in a correct and transparent manner\".\n* British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on 16 June: \"The elections are a matter for the Iranian people, but if there are serious questions that are now being asked about the conduct of the elections, they have got to be answered... There must be no violence in response to peaceful protests... the relationship they will have and the respect they will have from the rest of the world will depend on how they respond to what are legitimate grievances that are being expressed and have to be answered.\" Foreign Secretary David Miliband said that they viewed \"the implications of recent events in Iran with serious concern.\" Miliband elaborated on that position on 17 June: \"We deplore the violence and especially the loss of life but we will not end up in a position where anyone can accuse the US or the UK or any Western power of trying to choose the Iranian Government, that’s not our job.\"\n* White House press secretary Robert Gibbs stated, \"[l]ike the rest of the world, we were impressed by the vigorous debate and enthusiasm that this election generated, particularly among young Iranians. We continue to monitor the entire situation closely, including reports of irregularities\". On 12 June—prior to the declaration of the winner—President Obama reacting to a question on the elections stated \"We are excited to see what appears to be a robust debate taking place in Iran\". Later, Vice President Biden has said, \"[i]t sure looks like the way they're suppressing speech, the way they're suppressing crowds, the way in which people are being treated, that there's some real doubt\". On 15 June, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly declared that the US was \"deeply troubled by the reports of violent arrests and possible voting irregularities.\" The President echoed the statement later that day. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said after the vote that \"I think this election has brought out a lot of opposition to [the President's] policies in Iran, and I'm sure he'll listen to those opinions and hopefully moderate his position.\" Former U.S. defense official Richard Perle remarked that the results \"were not a surprise.\" Congressman Ron Paul criticised the reaction of the U.S. Government \"on events thousands of miles away about which we know very little.\"\nExpressions of congratulations\n* Hamid Karzai, President of Afghanistan, congratulated Ahmadinejad with his election victory.\n* Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan sent a congratulatory message to Ahmadinejad stating in part, \"On behalf of the people of the Republic of Armenia and myself I warmly congratulate you on the occasion of your re-election as President of the Islamic Republic of Iran and wish you new successes and achievements.\"\n* Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliev congratulated Ahmadinejad with his victory on Monday, he said: \"We place a particular emphasis on development of overall relations between our countries.
