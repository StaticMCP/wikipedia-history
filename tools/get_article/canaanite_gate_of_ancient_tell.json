They led to a fortified enclosure around the temple and the palace of Canaanite Biruta (Beirut).\nConstruction\nAround 1500 BC, Biruta was a fortified city; entering a fortified enclosure that surrounded the temple and palace conveyed order, power and prosperity. The visitor had to pass through a gate and a narrow passage. The L-shaped form of the passage had defensive and ceremonial origins.\nHistory\nAround 1500 BC, the city wall and its gates conveyed order, power and prosperity in Canaanite Biruta. To enter a fortified enclosure that surrounded the temple and palace, the visitor had to pass through a gate and narrow passage. The L-shaped form of the passage had both defensive and ceremonial origins. In times of war, when the city was under siege, the angle of the passageway prevented invaders from hoisting a battering ram to destroy the gate.  In times of peace, a visitor was not afforded direct access to the temple or the palace, but had to make a turn in the passageway. The latter opened onto a monumental stairway, which led to the place of authority.\nTimeline\n1500 BC: The city wall and its gates conveyed order, power and prosperity in Canaanite Biruta.\nSee also\n* Ancient Tell\nReferences\n*Badre, Leila (1998) “BEY 003 Preliminary Report, Excavations of the American University of Beirut Museum, 1993–96”, Bulletin d’ Archéologie et d’ Architecture Libanaises 2: 6–94.
