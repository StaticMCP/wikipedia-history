He is CNN's chief national correspondent, based in Washington, D.C.. He formerly anchored Inside Politics, State of the Union, and John King, USA.\nPersonal life\nKing was born in Boston. He is of Irish Catholic descent with ancestors from Dún Locháin, Co. Galway. He attended Boston Latin School, and earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Rhode Island. John King and Jean Makie, his first wife, have two children, named Noah and Hannah.\nAfter divorcing Makie, King married his second wife, fellow CNN anchor Dana Bash on May 25, 2008. Before marrying Bash, King (previously a Roman Catholic) converted to Judaism, Bash's religion. Bash and King have a son, Jonah, who was born in June 2011. The couple separated in March 2012.\nOn October 19, 2021, King revealed on his show Inside Politics that he has multiple sclerosis and is thus immunocompromised. The following day, he revealed to CNN New Day anchor John Berman that he had been diagnosed 13 years earlier. According to King, he had problems feeling his legs since covering the Clinton administration in the late 1990s. After those problems worsened during the 2008 presidential campaign, he received his diagnosis.\nCareer\nIn 1985, King joined the Associated Press where he began as a writer. In 1991, King was named chief political correspondent and headed the AP's political coverage of the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections. Also in 1991, King won the top reporting prize from the Associated Press Managing Editors Association for his coverage of the Gulf War in Kuwait.\nIn 1997, King joined CNN where he served as the senior White House correspondent from 1999 to 2005. In 2005, King was named CNN's chief national correspondent, a position he still holds. From 2014 to 2021, he anchored the Sunday morning (and more frequently during presidential-election years) news program Inside Politics, which features a rotating roundtable of members of the media who share their insights of current political topics with King. He frequently appears on the nightly news programs The Situation Room and Anderson Cooper 360° and sometimes fills in as anchor.\nKing uses the Multi-Touch Collaboration Wall, nicknamed the \"Magic Wall\" or \"Magic Map\". First used during the primaries of the 2008 presidential campaign, it allows him to display and manipulate graphics and maps of polling and election results. He and the Multi-Touch Collaboration Wall have both been featured in a Daily Show segment, as well as CNN coverage of the US Presidential Election in 2016 and 2020.\nJust prior to the 2009 US presidential inauguration, King began hosting a new talk show State of the Union, which replaced CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer. With Lou Dobbs' sudden resignation from the network on November 12, 2009, CNN announced that King would take over Dobbs' timeslot in early 2010. On January 31, 2010, King announced that CNN's senior political reporter, Candy Crowley, would replace him as anchor of State of the Union.  King began hosting his new weeknight show John King, USA, on March 22, 2010. On May 2, 2011, John King was the CNN anchor who confirmed the death of Osama bin Laden to their viewers.\nOn January 19, 2012, King moderated a Republican presidential debate before the South Carolina Primary.\nJohn King, USA was canceled in early 2012, with the final episode airing on June 29, 2012.\nOn April 17, 2013, King, citing law enforcement sources, erroneously reported that a suspect in the April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon bombing had been identified by police and that the suspect was a dark-skinned male. King was the first to erroneously report on this identification of a suspect; other news outlets, such as Fox News, soon erroneously reported that a suspect had been arrested.\nKing received widespread praise for his coverage of the 2020 United States presidential election.\nFrom 2016 to 2023, King hosted the weekday edition of the CNN morning show Inside Politics.\nOn January 11, 2021, Abby Phillip was announced as the new anchor on the Sunday edition of Inside Politics, replacing King, starting Sunday, January 24, 2021. The new show is called Inside Politics Sunday with Abby Phillip.\nIn April 2023, it was announced that his colleague and  ex-wife Dana Bash  would succeed him as solo anchor of Inside Politics in mid-June, while he embarked on  a new project dealing with election politics.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_reporters/king.john.html John King] at CNN's website\n*\n*\n*"
