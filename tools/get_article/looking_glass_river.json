It is a tributary of the Grand River. The Looking Glass River is about  long, has no dams, and borders many wetlands and woodlots.\nName\nNineteenth-century sources have transcribed the alternate name of Wabenasebee for the river.  That name may refer to the large Chippewa settlement of Wabwahnahseepee that had existed, just north of modern De Witt, when European settlers first arrived.\nCourse\nIt rises in Conway Township in northeast Livingston County and flows north into Shiawassee County, passing between Morrice and Bancroft as it turns westward and passes just south of Laingsburg on the western edge of Shiawassee. It then runs through the southern portion of Clinton County, including DeWitt. It flows into the Grand River in Portland in southeast Ionia County.\nThe stream starts as a slow soft-bottom waterway. On the  between the Livingston County line and Laingsburg the river averages  wide.  There is more activity in the lower stretch below DeWitt, where there is good fishing and canoeing.\nSettlement history\nThe earliest known settlers of the Looking Glass Watershed were the Sauk people who were eventually replaced by people of the Chippewa and Ottawa tribes.  The area was highly regarded for its abundance of game and fish.  White settlers came to the area following trails up the Flint and Shiawassee rivers inland from Detroit and Port Huron.\nConservation\nIn Clinton County, the river flows through the A Looking Glass Sanctuary, a  nature preserve owned by the Michigan Nature Association.\nReferences"
