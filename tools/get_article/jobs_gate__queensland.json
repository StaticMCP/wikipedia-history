It is on the border of Queensland and New South Wales. In the , Jobs Gate had \"no people or a very low population\".\nThe abandoned town of Tego is in the south-east of the locality ().\nGeography\nThe southern boundary of Jobs Gate is the border of Queensland and New South Wales.\nJobs Gate Road enters the locality from the west (Noorama) and exits to the south (Weilmoringle).\nThe south-east of the locality is within the Culgoa Floodplain National Park (), which extends into neighbouring Hebel. The town of Tego is within the national park (but excised from the protected area). The Tego springs are approximately  ESE of the town () and are natural springs from the Great Artesian Basin. The springs were close to a stock route that commences in the area and extends to Cunnamulla.\nApart from the national park, the predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nIn March 1901  were reserved for the town of Tego. The gazettal of the town was published in the Queensland Government Gazette on 30 March 1901. It was originally called Tego Springs.\nThe motivation for establishing Tego was its location, approximately midway between Cunnamulla and Brewarrina (in New South Wales). Town lots were surveyed and sold, and in its early days the town had a hotel and other buildings. The hotel appears to have pre-dated the town being shown on a 1896 map. By 1924 only one cottage remained with two inhabitants. As at May 2020, there is no evidence of any structures remaining at the town.\nDemographics\nIn the , Jobs Gate had a population of 6 people.\nIn the , Jobs Gate had \"no people or a very low population\".\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Jobs Gate. The nearest primary and secondary schools are in Cunnamulla,  away. Distance education and boarding schools are the alternatives.\nReferences"
