Here Brigadier Ronald Senior (centre) with the staff of the 151st Infantry Brigade, who have been visited by Lieutenant-General William Duthie Morgan (left) and the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden (right) in 1944.]]\nDuring the Second World War, a British infantry brigade consisted of multiple battalions and was commanded by a brigadier. Generally, three infantry brigades would form an infantry division, although brigades could be used as independent formations in which case, they were usually assigned to a corps-level command to be utilised. Brigades were flexible formations and rarely maintained the same battalions. Likewise, brigades could be moved from division to division or higher-level commands, as the tactical or strategic need arose. Their role could also vary dramatically, from being a combat formation to becoming a training organisation. Over the course of the war, the British Army had 216 uniquely numbered or named brigade formations. However, not all existed at the same time, and several were formed by renaming or renumbering existing formations. This article focuses on all brigades numbered above 100 and those that were named. Those numbered 100 and below are located within their own list.\nDuring the Second World War, the British Army was split between two branches: the regular army, made up of full time professionals; and the Territorial Army (TA), which consisted of part-time reservists. The TA was seen as the primary way to expand the size of the British military during a war. To do so, the existing TA formations, which were referred to as the first-line, would create a new formation based around a cadre of soldiers. The new formation, referred to as the second-line, would then be expanded until it reached full strength. The regular army also created new brigades when existing infantry battalions were grouped together. The retraining of members of the Royal Artillery also saw the creation of many additional infantry brigades.\nBackground\ncheer Prime Minister Winston Churchill.]]\nDuring the Second World War, the infantry was the backbone of the British Army. Within the British Army, the infantry was organised into regiments, however, these were administrative structures and not operational units. The fighting unit of an infantry regiment was the battalion, and a regiment could field numerous battalions. A brigade generally consisted of three infantry battalions commanded by a brigadier, and were around 2,500-men strong. In combat, brigades were provided support from artillery, engineers, and other supporting arms as needed. Generally, these assets belonged to the higher formations that the brigade belonged to.\nBrigades were not set formations, and their composition and role could change because of tactical or strategic demands. For example, the 114th&nbsp;Infantry Brigade contained the same three battalions throughout the course of the war. In contrast, the 144th&nbsp;Infantry Brigade had 15 different battalions under its command during the war. It was unusual for a brigade to consist solely of battalions from one regiment. From the list below, excluding the Royal Marines and those formed by the conversion of anti-aircraft formations, only nine brigades had more than one battalion from the same regiment at the same time. Of those, the 128th (Hampshire Regiment), the 131st (Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)), and the 177th&nbsp;Infantry Brigades (South Staffordshire Regiment) maintained battalions from the same regiment for the duration of their existence during the war. A brigade could be an independent formation, answerable only to a high-level command, or one assigned to a division. Those assigned to divisions could be switched between formations depending on the strategic need. For example, the 114th and the 129th&nbsp;Infantry Brigades never left their respective divisions throughout the entire course of the war, whereas the 157th&nbsp;Infantry Brigade was assigned to four different divisions, six corps-level commands, and one army group command.\nThe British Army was split into two branches: the regular army, which numbered 224,000 men with a reserve of 173,700 at the start of the war, and the part-time Territorial Army (TA), which numbered 438,100 with a reserve of around 20,750 men. The main goal of the regular army, built largely around battalion-size units, was to maintain the peace and defend the British Empire. David Fraser, a historian and a former general, argued that during the inter-war period, the British Army did not field a force of infantry brigades and divisions; those that officially existed, did so only on paper. While battalions were organised into brigades, they were dispersed and were deficient in artillery, communication, engineer, logistical, and transportation assets. In the event of war, brigades ready and equipped to fight as part of a division would need to be assembled from the available battalions, while other forces required for brigades and divisions would have to be raised. At the outset of war, the regular army had 24 infantry brigades. The majority were stationed within the UK, although there were six based in the Middle East, one garrisoned Malta, and one each was based in West Africa, British Malaya, and Hong Kong.\nIn 1940, the size of the British Army increased dramatically as 140 new infantry battalions were raised. The majority of these were assigned to the 201st through 227th Independent Infantry Brigades (Home), which were intended for a static defence role along vulnerable coastal sectors and were assigned to county divisions. These brigades were also unique in that they could have up to five battalions assigned to them at any one time. By mid-1944, the British Army faced a manpower crisis as it did not have enough men to replace the losses suffered by front line infantry units. Efforts were made to address this, such as transferring men from the Royal Artillery and retraining them as infantry. These men were formed into 301st, and the 303rd to 308th Infantry Brigades. Likewise, two brigades were formed by the Royal Marines in an effort to alleviate the crisis. The 116th and the 117th Infantry Brigades Royal Marines were largely drawn from landing craft crew who had previously been trained as infantry as part of the Royal Marines Division. Over the course of the war, 140 regular army brigades would be raised, although they would not all exist at the same time, and many were re-designated from one number or name to another.\nThe TA was intended to be the primary method of expanding the number of formations available to the British Army. However, during the inter-war period, the British government reduced the funding and size of the TA. By 1936, they had concluded the TA could not be modernised or equipped for a European war over the following three-year period, and therefore delayed further funding. Following the German occupation of the remnants of the Czechoslovak state in March 1939, the TA was ordered to be doubled size. At the beginning of 1939, the TA had 35 infantry brigades. The existing formations, termed the first-line, were ordered to create a second formation using a cadres of trained personnel. The new formations were termed the second-line, and the process was termed \"duplicating\". The plan was for the first-line formations to recruit over their establishments (aided by improvements in conditions of service) and then form a new brigade from cadres around which the new formation could be expanded.}} By the outbreak of the war, some of these second-line brigades had been formed while others were still being created. By the end of 1939, the TA had increased to 32 first-line and 32 second-line infantry brigades.\nDuring the 1939–1940 period, each brigade of the British Expeditionary Force was assigned a company of nine French 25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank guns. After the Battle of France and the evacuation from Dunkirk, additional brigade anti-tank companies were formed and equipped with the Ordnance QF 2-pounder (40&nbsp;mm) anti-tank gun. Over the course of the following year, these companies were disbanded. The British Army implemented lessons learnt from the battle of France. This included brigades, in the UK, being reorganised into brigade groups, which involved attaching artillery, anti-aircraft guns, anti-tank guns, machine guns, and engineers to them. This change was then implemented in brigades overseas. Brigades organised in this fashion within a division, compromised the division's ability to centralise and concentrate artillery fire to support the infantry brigades. After training exercises in the UK showed the weakness of these formations, those based within the UK were reorganised as regular brigades and the additional units reassigned back to being divisional assets. Those organised as brigade groups and that fought in the Western Desert Campaign, were maintained as such through most of 1942. These groups, due to a lack of firepower and not being concentrated with other formations, were engaged in several one-sided affairs against Axis divisional size forces and defeated.\nThe British infantry were highly motorized, with each battalion having enough transport capable of moving each platoon's weapons, equipment, and supplies. At the beginning of the war and within a divisional organisation, there was enough available motor transport to move an entire infantry brigade at once. When additional motor transport was not available, the infantry marched. As the war progressed, additional transportation was made available to the infantry. An infantry battalion, which had been provided with sufficient lorries to allow the movement of all personnel and equipment at once, was referred to as a lorried infantry battalion. A variant was the motor battalion, drawn from the army's rifle regiments. They were fully motorised but varied in organisation compared to the other infantry battalions. As the war progressed, these units were also outfitted with lend-lease half-tracks. When lorried or motor battalions were grouped together, their brigade sometimes took on an identifier such as the 133rd Lorried Infantry Brigade.\nInfantry brigades\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: left; border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n|-\n|+List of infantry brigades numbered 101 to 308\n|-\n!width=\"5%\" scope=\"col\"|Formation name\n!width=5% scope=\"col\"|Existing or date created\n!width=5% scope=\"col\"|Date ceased to exist\n!width=5% scope=\"col\"|Location(s) served\n!width=10% scope=\"col\"|Notable campaign(s)\n!width=5% scope=\"col\"|Branch\n!class=unsortable width=4% scope=\"col\"|Division(s) mostly associated with\n!class=unsortable width=60% scope=\"col\"|Notes\n!class=unsortable width=1% scope=\"col\"|Source(s)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\"|103rd Infantry Brigade\n|align=\"center\"|\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"center\"|Belgium, Netherlands, Germany\n|align=\"center\"|did not see combat\n|align=\"center\"|Regular Army\n|align=\"center\"|N/A\n|align=\"left\"|H.F.
