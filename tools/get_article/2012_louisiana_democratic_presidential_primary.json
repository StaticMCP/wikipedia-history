However, Tennessee attorney and perennial political candidate John Wolfe Jr. challenged President Obama in the primaries, and received nearly 12% of the vote. Entrepreneur Bob Ely and historian Darcy Richardson also participated, and received a little over 6% and 5% of the vote, respectively. On the date of the primary, President Obama swept nearly every parish in the state, with Wolfe winning LaSalle, Grant, and Cameron parishes.\nAlthough Wolfe qualified for four delegates, the Louisiana Democratic Party announced that they would not award the delegates to Wolfe on technical grounds.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" |2012 Louisiana Democraticpresidential primary\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" |Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Pledgeddelegates\n|-\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Barack Obama\n|115,150\n|76.46\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |60\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |John Wolfe, Jr.\n|17,804\n|11.82\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Bob Ely\n|9,897\n|6.57\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Darcy Richardson\n|7,750\n|5.15\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!Total\n!150,601\n!100%\n!64\n|}\nSee also\n* 2012 Louisiana Republican presidential primary\n* 2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2012 United States presidential election in Louisiana\nReferences"
