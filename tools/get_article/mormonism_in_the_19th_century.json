In the late 1820s, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, announced that an angel had given him a set of golden plates engraved with a chronicle of ancient American peoples, which he had a unique gift to translate. In 1830, he published the resulting narratives as the Book of Mormon and founded the Church of Christ in western New York, claiming it to be a restoration of early Christianity.\nMoving the church to Kirtland, Ohio in 1831, Joseph Smith attracted hundreds of converts, who were called Latter Day Saints. He sent some to Jackson County, Missouri to establish a city of Zion. In 1833, Missouri settlers expelled the Saints from Zion, and Smith's paramilitary expedition to recover the land was unsuccessful. Fleeing an arrest warrant in the aftermath of a Kirtland financial crisis, Smith joined his remaining followers in Far West, Missouri, but tensions escalated into violent conflicts with the old Missouri settlers. Believing the Saints to be in insurrection, the Missouri governor ordered their expulsion from Missouri, and Smith was imprisoned on capital charges.\nAfter escaping state custody in 1839, Smith directed the conversion of a swampland into Nauvoo, Illinois, where he became both mayor and commander of a nearly autonomous militia. In 1843, he announced his candidacy for President of the United States. The following year, after the Nauvoo Expositor criticized his power and such new doctrines as plural marriage, Smith and the Nauvoo city council ordered the newspaper's destruction as a nuisance. In a futile attempt to check public outrage, Smith first declared martial law, then surrendered to the governor of Illinois. He was killed by a mob while awaiting trial in Carthage, Illinois.\nAfter the death of the Smiths, a succession crisis occurred in the Latter Day Saint movement. Hyrum Smith, the Assistant President of the Church, was intended to succeed Joseph as President of the Church, but because he was killed with his brother, the proper succession procedure became unclear. Initially, the primary contenders to succeed Joseph Smith were Brigham Young, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Young, president of the Quorum of the Twelve, claimed authority was handed by Smith to the Quorum of the Twelve. Rigdon was the senior surviving member of the First Presidency, a body that led the church since 1832. At the time of the Smiths' deaths, Rigdon was estranged from Smith due to differences in doctrinal beliefs. Strang claimed that Smith designated him as the successor in a letter that was received by Strang a week before Smith's death. Later, others came to believe that Smith's son, Joseph Smith III, was the rightful successor under the doctrine of Lineal succession.\nSeveral schisms resulted, with each claimant attracting followers. The majority of Latter Day Saints followed Young; these adherents later emigrated to Utah Territory and continued as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Rigdon's followers were known as Rigdonites, some of which later established The Church of Jesus Christ. Strang's followers established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite). In the 1860s, those who felt that Smith should have been succeeded by Joseph Smith III established the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which later changed its name to Community of Christ.\nUnder Brigham Young, the LDS Church orchestrated a massive overland migration of Latter-day Saint pioneers to Utah, by wagon train and, briefly, by handcart. The Apostles directed missionary preaching in Europe and the United States, gaining more converts who then gathered to frontier Utah. In its remote settlement, the church governed civil affairs and made public its practice of plural marriage (polygamy). As the federal government asserted greater control over Utah, relations with the Mormons enflamed, leading to the Utah War and the Mountain Meadows Massacre. Mormon polygamy became a major political issue, with federal legislation and judicial rulings curtailing Mormon legal protections and delegitimizing the church. Eventually, the church issued a manifesto discontinuing polygamy, which paved the way to Utah statehood and realignment with mainstream American society.\n17th Century\n* Joseph Smith's earliest confirmed paternal ancestor Robert Smith is born. He was possibly born in 1626. He is first recorded in 1638 in Boston, Mass. as an indentured servant. [https://web.archive.org/web/20131021133849/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700249298/DNA-shows-Joseph-Smith-was-Irish.html DNA shows Joseph Smith was Irish]. The ancestry of the Smith family before then is uncertain, but DNA testing suggests Irish or Scottish roots.\n18th Century\n* Jason Mack, Joseph Smith's great uncle, and brother of Solomon Mack sets up a religious community in Canada.\n1730s\n* Solomon Mack, grandfather of Joseph Smith, is born.\n1750s\n* Solomon Mack takes part in the French and Indian War.\n1770s\n* Solomon Mack takes part in the American Revolutionary War, the separatist rebellion against British rule.\n1790s\n1791\n* Smith's aunt Lovisa Mack Tuttle, after a two-year illness, is miraculously healed. Returning from a near death experience, she tells of a vision in which Jesus spoke through a veil and told her to \"warn the people to prepare for death\" and to \"declare faithfully unto them their accountability before God\".\n1796\n* January 24: Smith's parents Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith are married in Tunbridge, Vermont, by Seth Austin.\n* Smith's grandfather Asael Smith states in a letter that \"I believe that the stone is now cut out of the mountain without hands, spoken by Daniel, and has smitten the image upon his feet.\"\n1797\n* Joseph Sr. and Lucy Smith have an unnamed baby child, who dies. There is disagreement on whether this was a boy or a girl.\n* December 6: Joseph Sr., his father Asael, his brother Jesse, and fourteen others form a Universalist Society.\n1798\n* February 11: Smith's brother Alvin Smith is born in Tunbridge, Vermont.\n1799\n* April 10: Smith's grandfather Asael Smith writes a letter to his family, intended to be read after his death, articulating his belief in universal salvation, warning them not to look to outward formalities of religion. Asael Smith, however, was a pew holder of the local Congregational church, a church known at the time for having preachers who taught Christian Universalism and Unitarian theology.\n1800s\n1800\n* February 9: Smith's brother Hyrum Smith is born in Tunbridge, Vermont.\n* August 4 – May 4, 1801: The Smith family may not have been counted during the 1800 U.S. census. Although there are \"Joseph Smith\" families in both Tunbridge and Poultney, Vermont, neither of them match in ages and children with the family of Joseph and Lucy Smith.\n* 1800–02: Smith Sr. may have moved temporarily to or visited Poultney, Vermont, 50 miles from Tunbridge, according to residents who said he lived there \"at the time of the Wood movement here\".\n* spring or early summer: A counterfeiter named (Justus?) Winchell organizes a dowsing company to dig for money in Middletown and Rutland, Vermont. Winchell associates with Nathaniel Wood, who had founded the New Israelites some years earlier, whose religious elements included temple building, divination, polygamy, and the idea that they were literal descendants of the Israelites. Among the company is Warren Cowdery Jr., the father of Oliver Cowdery, the dowser who became Smith's scribe in 1829. According to interviews conducted by a local historian, Joseph Smith Sr. was also part of the New Israelites, and was one of its \"leading rods-men.\" There is no historical consensus linking Smith Sr. to the New Israelites; however, James C. Brewster reported that Smith claimed that his money digging career began during this decade or earlier.\n1802\n* January 14: The New Israelites, having prophesied this day as the end of the world, are confronted by local militia. This is known as the \"Wood Scrape\". The militia fires their weapons to disperse the \"Fraternity of Rodsmen\".\n* about spring: Joseph Sr. and Lucy Smith rent out their farm in Tunbridge, Vermont, and move to the more urban Randolph, Vermont, to set up a merchant shop. They operate with $1,800 in goods on credit from merchants in Boston.\n* Soon after moving to Randolph, Smith Sr. speculates on a shipment of ginseng, which he sends from the port in New York City to China.\n* about fall or winter: Six months after moving to Randolph, Lucy contracts tuberculosis.\n* 1802–03: While deathly ill, Lucy has a religious conversion after she believes she hears the voice of God. She said that she perceived her \"mind at one time raising gradually, borne away to Heaven above all  then reverting back again to my babes and my Companion at my side\", after which she promised God that if she would live, she would try to find religion, and then heard a voice saying \"Seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you let your heart be comforted ye believe in God believe [sic] also in me\". Lucy tries to find a religious home, but is unhappy with several ministers; therefore, she concludes that \"there is not on Earth the religion which I seek I must again turn to my bible taking Jesus and his deciples [sic] for an ensample\".\n1803\n* A large Christian revival sweeps across Vermont and Connecticut.\n* about 1803: After the ship returns from China with the proceeds from the sale of Smith Sr.'s ginseng (a round trip that might have taken about a year), the earnings are stolen by a Royalton merchant who flees to Canada.\n* Joseph Sr. and Lucy Smith move from Royalton back to Tunbridge, Vermont.\n* The Smiths must sell their farm in Tunbridge to cover their debts to Boston merchants, and they thereafter become poor tenants.\n* May 17: Smith's sister Sophronia is born in Tunbridge.\n* 1803–04: Lucy attends meetings at a Methodist church, and Smith Sr. \"went a few times to gratify [Lucy] for he had so little faith in the doctrines taught by them that my feelings were the only inducement for him to go\".\n* 1803–04: Hearing that Joseph Sr. is attending Methodist meetings, Smith's Universalist grandfather Asael Smith appears at his door, throws Thomas Paine's Age of Reason, into the house, and angrily demands that Smith Sr. read it until he believes it. He also suggests that Smith Sr. ought not let Lucy attend the meetings. As a result, the Smiths stop attending Methodist church meetings.\n* 1803–04: Lucy Mack Smith visits a grove near Tunbridge to pray about her husband's rejection of organized religion. When she returns home and goes to sleep that night, she has a vision that Smith Sr. would eventually accept the \"pure and undefiled Gospel of the Son of God.\"\n1804\n* about 1804: The Smiths move from Tunbridge to Royalton, Vermont, where they \"resided a few months\".\n* August 27: Smith's maternal grandfather Solomon Mack purchases property in Sharon, Vermont.\n* 1804–05: Joseph Sr. and Lucy move to Sharon, Vermont, where they rent the farm of Lucy's father while Joseph Sr. cultivates crops in the summer and teaches school in the winter. Solomon Mack likely lives with them.\n1805\n* December 23: Smith is born in Sharon, Vermont, to Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. Vermont residents recall that Smith Sr. told them the young Joseph was born with a caul (a sign of good luck), and that Smith Sr. \"intended to procure a stone for [him] to see all over the world with\".\n1806\n* May 3: Smith Sr. witnesses a land transaction between his in-laws Solomon Mack and Daniel G. Mack in Sharon, Vermont.\n1807\n* April 1: In the court of Windsor County, Vermont, a person is convicted of passing counterfeit money to \"Joseph Smith\".\n* April 16: A second person is convicted of passing counterfeit money to \"Joseph Smith\".\n* Sharon resident George Downer is convicted of passing two counterfeit bills the previous spring. There is some tenuous evidence, based in part on a descendant of the counterfeiter against whom Smith Sr. testified on April 1, that Smith Sr. was an accomplice in that case who avoided conviction by turning state's evidence.\n* Smith family moves from Sharon back to Tunbridge, Vermont.\n* October 15: Smith Sr., his brother Jesse, and other Tunbridge residents petition the Vermont legislature for an exemption from providing their own military equipment as members of the Vermont militia.\n1808\n* March 13: Smith's brother Samuel is born in Tunbridge, Vermont.\n* 1808–10: Smith family moves from Tunbridge to Royalton, Vermont.\n* 1808–10: Smith possibly attends school on Dewey Hill, taught by Deacon John Rinney, although he may have been too young.\n1810s\n1810\n* March 13: Smith's brother Ephraim is born in Royalton, Vermont.\n* March 24: Ephraim Smith dies.\n* winter of 1810–11: A Christian revival occurs in the towns around Royalton, Vermont. Smith Sr. becomes \"much excited upon the subject of religion\" and \"contended\" for a restoration of primitive Christianity.\n1811\n* spring 1811: Smith's maternal grandfather Solomon Mack, after being ill all winter in Sharon, Vermont, and after searching the scriptures and praying, sees a vision and later hears a voice. He is converted to evangelical Calvinism and denounces Universalism.\n* March 13: Smith's brother William is born in Royalton, Vermont.\n* April: Joseph Smith Sr. tells his family about his first vision. He sees a field representing the barrenness of true religion upon the earth, and he sees a log containing a box. His spirit guide tells him that if he eats the contents of the box, he will be filled with \"wisdom and understanding\". He raises the lid of the box, but is unable to eat its contents because \"all manner of beasts, horned cattle, and roaring animals, rose up on every side in the most threatening manner possible\". Based on the vision, Smith Sr. concludes, more than ever, that there is no true religion on the earth. He would have six other visions between 1811 and 1819.\n* after May 11: After selling his property in Sharon, Vermont, and moving to live with Smith's uncle Daniel in Royalton, Smith's maternal grandfather Solomon Mack self-publishes a booklet describing his heavenly visions and voices of the previous winter: .\n1812\n* after May: Smith family moves from Royalton, Vermont, to Lebanon, New Hampshire.\n* after May: Joseph Smith Sr. has his second vision, in which he saw a barren field representing the desolate world, a \"narrow path\", a stream with a rope running along its bank leading to a beautiful tree bearing a fruit whiter than snow that was \"delicious beyond description. While eating, he thought \"I cannot eat this alone, I must bring my wife and children, that they may partake with me.\" Thus, he brought his family to eat the fruit. However, there was a \"spacious building\" across the valley where the tree was, filed with finely-dressed people looking down and mocking Smith's family. Smith's spirit guide said that the fruit represented \"the pure love of Christ\". The guide said that the spacious building represented \"Babylon, and it must fall\".\n* winter of 1812–13: Smith and his siblings contract typhoid fever, and Smith acquires osteomyelitis in his leg. He has surgery to remove infected bone, causing him to hobble on crutches at least until 1816.\n1813\n* about 1813: Smith stays with his uncle Jesse Smith in Salem, Massachusetts while recovering from his leg operation.\n* July 8: Smith's sister Katherine is born in Lebanon, New Hampshire.\n1815\n* by May: Smith family moves to Norwich, Vermont, and their first year of crops fails. They survive by selling fruit.\n1816\n* March 15: The Smith family is \"warned out of town\" in Norwich, Vermont.\n* Joseph Smith Sr. relates to his family his third vision, in which he was lame, but his spirit guide sent him through a garden amidst 12 wooden images of giants. After each of the wooden giants sequentially bowed toward him in obeisance, he was healed.\n* March 25: Smith's brother Don Carlos is born.\n* Summer: New England and other areas experience a climate abnormality known as the Year Without a Summer.\n* 1816–17: Palmyra experiences a large Christian revival.\n* Fall: Smith Sr. moves to the village of Palmyra, New York.\n1817\n* January: Lucy Mack Smith and the remainder of the family move to Palmyra, where they live in a small house on Main Street.\n* abt. 1817: Smith Sr. opens a \"cake and beer shop\" in Palmyra, selling \"gingerbread, pies, boiled eggs, root-beer, and other like notions of traffic\", and peddles these on the street from a handcart during Independence Day celebrations and military training days\". . A journalist who visited the area in 1831 wrote in his notes that Smith Sr. \"was a vender—made gingerbread and buttermints &c&c\". He said, \"In this article [gingerbread? ginger?] he was a considerable speculator, having on hand during a fall of price no less than two baskets full.... What their dividends were I could not learn, but they used considerable molasses, and were against the duty on that article\".\n* abt. 1817: Influenced by the Christian revivals of 1816–17 , Smith later recalls, \"At about the age of twelve years my mind become [sic] seriously imprest with regard to the all importent [sic] concerns for the wellfare [sic] of my immortal Soul which led me to searching the scriptures believeing [sic] as I was taught, that they contained the word of God thus applying myself to them and my intimate acquaintance with those of different denominations led me to marvel excedingly [sic] for I discovered that they did not adorn instead of adorning their profession by a holy walk and Godly conversation agreeable to what I found contained in that sacred depository.\"\n* 1817–19: In Palmyra, Smith Sr. and his oldest sons take occasional day jobs, such as gardening, harvesting, and well-digging, to supplement their income. Lucy Mack Smith sets up a business selling painted oil-cloth coverings.\n* April: Joseph Smith Sr. is listed on the local road list as living in Palmyra village, on Road District 26.\n* 1817–21: During some period between these years, Smith visits the office of the Palmyra Register weekly and buys a news paper for his father.\n* December: A \"Joseph Smith\" (Sr.?) joins the Masonic lodge in nearby Canandaigua, New York.\n1818\n* April: Joseph Smith Sr. family is living in Palmyra village.\n* May: Joseph Smith Sr. relates to his family his sixth vision. Smith Sr. rushes toward a meetinghouse where multitudes of other people are entering, but just as he arrives there, the door shuts before him. The porter tells him that he must be barred entry to satisfy justice. After praying for forgiveness of sins, the mercy of Jesus satisfied the needs of justice and he was allowed entrance.\n1819\n* April: Joseph Smith Sr. family is listed on tax records as still living in Palmyra village.\n* The Smith family builds a log home in the town of Palmyra, away from the village and adjacent to the border of Manchester.  said they moved into the log home two years after arriving in Palmyra.  remembers the Smiths occupying this log home in the winter of 1819-20.  dates the move to the log home to 1818, said that the Smiths occupied the land as squatters, and described the log home as \"divided into two rooms, on the ground-floor, and had a low garret, in two apartments. A bedroom wing, built of sawed slabs, was afterward added\". They may have begun clearing trees and farming nearby land they did not yet own, or they may have been renting the land.\n* 1819–1820s: While on their new property, the Smiths engage in \"chopping and retailing of cord-wood, the raising and bartering of small crops of agricultural products and garden vegetables, the manufacture and sale of black-ash baskets and birch brooms, the making of maple sugar and molasses in the season for that work, and in the continued business of peddling cake and beer in the village on days of public doings\". They also engage in hunting and fishing, trapping muskrats, and digging out groundhogs from their holes, and spending time at Palmyra shops.\n* 1819–1820s: Smith Jr. works as a clerk for the peddling of cake and beer on public occasions, and sometimes is duped into accepting counterfeit coins from other youth.\n* Alvin Smith leaves home to raise money for the family.\n* An unknown shooter hides under a wagon, and when Smith approaches his home, the shooter fires across the path, missing Smith but lodging a bullet in a cow.\n* Joseph Smith Sr. tells his family about his seventh and last vision, telling him that he lacked one thing in order to secure his salvation. His spirit guide wrote what that one thing was on a piece of paper, but Smith Sr. awoke before he could read it.\n* September: According to , Smith discovers a seer stone, which is white and opaque, and resembles a child's foot. Tucker's account apparently conflates the story of finding this stone with the better-documented story of Smith finding his brown seer stone in 1822.  argues that this 1819 date cannot be relied upon, and that it is not established that Smith began using a seer stone for treasure digging until 1822.\n1820s\n* between 1820 and 1827: According to , Smith sees the location of a buried chest of money, but says that a black sheep must be sacrificed in order to break the spell on it. He obtains the sheep from Manchester resident William Stafford and makes the sacrifice within a circle at the site of the dig. After three hours of digging, one of the party accidentally breaks the enchantment by breaking silence and causes the excavation to fail.\n1820\n* about 1820: According to one account, Smith finds his first stone by borrowing the stone of another treasure seer.\n* about 1820: According to , Smith is paid 75 cents to locate a stolen roll of cloth with his seer stone. He sends the owner on a three mile trip to look for the cloth, but it is never found.\n* about 1820: During this period are the earliest reports of the Smiths conducting treasure quests in the Palmyra/Manchester area.  date this earliest digging to 1820. See also  (dating the first digs to 1820 and suggesting the first digs occurred on their Manchester land). In , James Gordon Bennett says, without giving a definite year, that \"the Smith's  and their associates commenced digging, in the numerous hills which diversify the face of the country in the town of Manchester. The sensible country people paid slight attention to them at first.... They Would occasionally conceal their purposes, and at other times reveal them by such snatches as might excite curiosity. They dug these holes by day, and at night talked and dreamed over the counties' riches they should enjoy, if they could only hit upon an iron chest full of dollars. In excavating the grounds, they began taking up the green sod in the form of a circle of six feed diameter—then would continue to dig to the depth of ten, twenty, and sometimes thirty feet.\"\n* April: Smith family is listed on local records as living at the end of Stafford Road in Palmyra Township (i.e., their log home at the border adjacent to Manchester). Alvin Smith is listed as living in Palmyra village.\n* Spring: According to , Smith uses his seer stone to locate buried treasure near the Smiths' property, and gathers contributions from Palmyra residents for an excavation, which is conducted \"at the dead hour of night\". After \"preparatory mystic ceremonies\", digging begins in absolute silence in order not to break the \"enchantment\". When the chest of money is nearly within reach, one of the party accidentally speaks, thus causing the treasure to vanish.  dates this treasure quest to after 1822, arguing that Smith did not obtain his first stone until that year.\n* spring: According to Smith's later accounts, he has his First Vision. He sees God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. In the vision, God testifies of Jesus, and then Jesus proceeds to tell Joseph that his sins are forgiven, and that he should join none of the churches, because none of them have the fullness of His Gospel.\n* August Solomon Mack dies.\n1821\n* July: The Smith family obtains a mortgage on a  farm adjacent to their log home, just outside Palmyra in what was then Farmington. (In 1821, this would become the town of Manchester.) They had already been working this land, either squatting or renting from the owner.  said that Smith made a small payment \"to bind the bargain\".\n* July 18: Smith's youngest sister Lucy is born.\n1822\n* about January 25: Smith begins participating in a Palmyra \"juvenile debating club\" at \"the old red school house on Durfee street\".\n* Alvin begins construction on a frame house for the Smiths.\n* February–August: Smith takes an interest in Methodism.  says that Smith \"catch[es] a spark of Methodism in the camp meeting, away down in the woods, on the Vienna road\", and is known there as \"a very passable exhorter\" at evening Methodist meetings.  says that Smith \"joined the probationary class of the Methodist church in Palmyra, and made some active demonstrations of engagedness\". According to Turner, this date must be after Smith's participation in the debating club (i.e., after Jan. 25, 1822). Date must also be after 7 July 1821, when the Methodists acquired their property in the woods off Vienna Road  The Methodists did not begin building their meetinghouse on Vienna Road until 19 June 1822 , but may have held camp meetings there while waiting for the building. It also must be on or before the summer of 1822, when Turner left the Palmyra area .  dates this to the revivals of 1824-25, but does not acknowledge that Turner said he left the Palmyra area in the summer of 1822.\n* February–August: Smith withdraws from his Methodist probationary class.  says that Smith \"arose and announced that his mission was to restore the true priesthood. He appointed a number of meetings, but no one seemed inclined to follow him as the leader of a new religion.\"  says that Smith's \"assumed convictions were insufficiently grounded or abiding to carry him along to the saving point of conversion, and he soon withdrew from the class. The final conclusion announced by him was, that all sectarianism was fallicious, all the churches on a false foundation, and the Bible a fable.\"\n* Smith finds the black seer stone from a neighbor and locates his own seer stone in a well, at a depth of 22 feet. The digging occurred on the property of Clark Chase, whose son Willard disputed Smith's ownership of the stone. This would be the stone he used for later money digging and translation of the Book of Mormon.\n* 1822-23?: The Smiths seek the expertise of a reputed treasure seer living many miles away. Several sources identify this seer as Luman Walter. In , reprinting an 1831 article by James Gordon Bennett, Bennett describes this great seer as having \"a particular felicity in finding out the spots of ground where money is hid and riches obtained. [Some anonymous member of the treasure quest party] related long stories how this person had been along shore in the east—how he had much experience in money digging—how he dreamt of the very spots where it could be found\". He said that the Smiths worked for a time \"to scrape together a little 'change' sufficient to fetch on the money dreamer.\" Bennett believed this distant magician was Sidney Rigdon, based on discussion with Palmyra residents who thought Rigdon was the author of the Book of Mormon. However, the story parallels a story told by Abner Cole in the Palmyra Reflector on 12 June 1830 (see below), which says the distant magician was Luman Walter, an occultist from Sodus, New York who had been educated in Europe.\n* 1822-23: Smith Sr. participates in treasure digging under the direction of scryer Luman Walter, with at least one dig on the property of Palmyra journalist Abner Cole, according to .  states that Cole's property was \"Manchester lot 2\". Cole lost this property some time after 19 August 1824, after which Benjamin Tabor owned it. Enoch Saunders rented from at least Tabor, and was renting at the time this excavation occurred.\n* about 1822-24?: Luman Walter assists or conducts digs on the hill Cumorah. According to one Palmyra resident, Walter conducts three digs on the hill Cumorah, after having no success, he suggests that Smith Jr. might be the only one that could find treasure there. .  relates a story reported by James Gordon Bennett that \"About the time that this person [the scryer from far away, which Bennett identifies as Sidney Rigdon but could be Walter] appeared among them, a splendid excavation was begun in a long narrow hill, between Manchester and Palmyra. This hill has been called by some, the Golden Bible Hill.... In the face of this hill, the money diggers renewed their work with fresh ardour, [the scryer/Rigdon] partly uniting with them in their operations.\" Bennett dates this story to about the time of the Palmyra's large religious revival of 1824-25. .  says that on the summit of Cumorah is a \"yet partially visible pit where the money speculators had previously dug for another kind of treasure\".\n1823\n* July–December: Ethan Smith, an anti-Masonic congregationalist minister in Poultney, Vermont, (and pastor of Oliver Cowdery's family) publishes View of the Hebrews from the press of the Poultney Gazette. The book concludes, based on reports of a parchment book, metal artifacts, and plates found in Indian burial mounds, that the American Indian peoples were the Ten Lost Tribes.\n* September 21–22: According to his later accounts, Smith says he had three visions, and one again in the morning, of an angel, who showed him the location of a buried golden book engraved with a history of the Indians.\n* September 22: Smith tells his father about his visions of the angel, and visits the hill Cumorah where the angel said the plates were buried. He returns empty-handed, claiming that he had failed to strictly follow the angel's commandments. He says the angel required him to return in exactly one year with his brother Alvin.\n* September 23: Smith tells the rest of his family about the visions and his visit to Cumorah.\n* September–November: Every night, the Smith family gathers to hear Smith tell stories of the \"ancient inhabitants of this continent, [including] their dress, mode of traveling, and the animals upon which they rode; their cities, their buildings, with every particular; their mode of warfare; and also their religious worship\" .\n* October 23: The Wayne Sentinel, to which the Smith family subscribed, recounts a vision of Asa Wild, who said that \"every denomination of professing christians had become exceedingly corrupt\", including the Presbyterians and Methodists, of which he had been a member. Therefore, prior to the Millennium, which would arrive in seven years (i.e., 1830), there would be a restoration of primitive Christianity. God was in the process of \"raising up\" a class of people \"signified by the Angel mentioned by the Revelator, XIV. 6, 7, which flew in the midst of heaven\" who would preach the true gospel. These people \"are of an inferior class, and small learning\", and \"they will be rejected by every denomination as a body; but soon, God will open their way, by miracles, judgments, &c.\"\n* November 15: Alvin contracts \"bilious cholic\", and a physician administers a toxic amount of calomel. Five physicians are unable to get him to expel the poison.\n* November 19: Alvin dies. On his death bed, he encourages Smith to \"do everything that lies in your power\" to obtain the golden plates.\n* November 20: Smith pays a $3.00 fee at the Palmyra drug store.\n1824\n* May 12: Local interest in fortune telling is sufficiently high that a Palmyra newspaper advertises two occult handbooks: The Complete Fortune Teller, and The Book of Fate.\n* May 17: A new land agent, John Greenwood, receives power of attorney over the Smith property.\n* September 22: According to his later accounts, Smith visits Cumorah and returns empty handed because he was unable to bring Alvin (or possibly one of Alvin's body parts). The angel requires him to return in exactly one year with the \"right person\"; Smith was to know that person by looking in his seer stone.  Vogel dispues the idea of annual visits as a later tale\n* September 25: The Smith family hears rumors that Alvin's grave had been exhumed and dissected (possibly by the young Joseph Smith). To prove this was untrue, Joseph Smith Sr. has Alvin's body exhumed in the presence of witnesses.\n* September 29: Joseph Smith Sr. runs an advertisement in the Wayne Sentinel for six weeks, announcing that he had exhumed Alvin's body, and that it was undisturbed.

Willard Chase claims that Smith admits that if it had not been for the brown stone found on the Chase property years earlier, he would not have found the plates. . Chase believes that because the stone is his, Chase has at least part ownership of the plates.\n; September–October: After the original chest said to hold the plates is smashed by members of Smith's former money digging company, Smith obtains a \"glass box\" (a wooden box used to hold pieces of glass) and says that the plates are kept inside.\n; October: The family of Martin Harris, a wealthy Palmyra resident, hears about the golden plates from Lucy Mack Smith. Martin's wife and daughter visit the Smith home to investigate, and Harris conducts his own investigation, asking Smith how the book was found. Smith says that he had located the plates via his brown seer stone, and that an angel appeared to him and told him that it was God's work, and that Smith must quit the money-digging company, translate the plates, and publish the translation. Harris offers, \"If the Lord will show me that it is his work, you can have all the money you want.\" .\n; fall: According to , Smith tells Palmyra residents that when he first saw the golden plates, he saw a \"display of celestial pyrotechnics\", as the angel appeared as his \"guide and protector\", while \"ten thousand devils gathered there, with their menacing sulphureous [sic] flame and smoke, to deter him from his purpose!\"\n; fall: Harris is said to have mused around the village of Palmyra about \"what wonderful discoveries Jo Smith had made, and of his finding plates in a hill in the town of Manchester (three miles south of Palmyra), —also found with the plates a large pair of \"spectacles,\" by putting which on his nose and looking at the plates, the spectacles turned the hieroglyphics into good English.\" .\n; fall: According to , Palmyra residents were not generally aware at this time of the spectacles Smith said were found with the plates.\n; fall: According to , \"notorious wags\" William T. Hussey and Azel Vandruver visit the Smith home and say they are willing to view the golden plates, taking upon themselves the risk that they would be being struck dead if they saw them.

Smith is apparently absent. .\n1828\n; December 1827-February 1828: Working behind a curtain, Smith transcribes some of the characters he says are engraved on the golden plates, and hands them across the curtain to Emma and her brother Reuben Hale. Smith also attempts to translate some of the characters.\n; February: Hyrum Smith and Martin Harris travel to Harmony to see Smith.\n; February - March: Martin Harris takes a transcript of characters and some of their translations to several scholars in New York City. According to , these scholars include \"Hon. Luther Bradish, Dr. Mitchell, Professor Anthon, and others\". James Gordon Bennett later reported that Harris told a potential financer in 1830 that he first approached \"one of the Professors of Columbia College\" (Anthon), who told Harris that he \"could not decipher them\", but referred him to Samuel L. Mitchill, who \"looked at his engravings—made a learned dissertation on them—compared them with the hieroglyphics discovered by Champollion in Egypt—and set them down as the language of a people formerly in existence in the East, but now no more\". . Harris said that after speaking with Mitchill, he returned to Anthon, \"who put some questions to him and got angry with Harris\". According to , Harris returns to Palmyra after his meetings in New York City and tells residents that Smith is a \"little smarter than Professor Anthon.\" According to , Harris declared \"in a boastful spirit that God had enabled him, an unlearned man as he was, to 'confound worldly wisdom'\".\n; 12 April: Harris begins acting as Smith's scribe while Smith begins dictating a translation of the golden plates, which Smith calls the Book of Lehi.\n; 14 June: Harris persuades Smith to allow him to take the original, uncopied 116 manuscript pages to Palmyra to show his skeptical wife and family.\n; 15 June: Smith and his wife have their first child, named Alvin, who dies soon after birth. Emma nearly dies, and hovers near death for days.\n; June–July: According to , Lucy Harris took the 116 manuscript pages from Martin Harris while he was sleeping, and burned them. Tucker said that she kept this \"a profound secret to herself, even until after the book was published\".\n; abt. 7 July: Smith visits Manchester to find out what happened to Harris, and learns that Harris has lost the 116 manuscript pages. Smith says the plates and the Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints) are taken away.\n; July: Smith returns to Harmony.\n; July: In Harmony, Smith dictates his first known written revelation, chastising him for losing the manuscript translation, and noting that \"this is the reason that thou has lost thy privileges for a season, for thou hast suffered the counsel of thy director to be trampled upon from the beginning.\"  and  describe this as Smith's first known written revelation. The identity of the speaker is unknown, because this revelation, unlike most later ones, refers to God and Jesus in the third person, although a hint to his identity may perhaps be found in his reference to \"my people, the Nephites\".  refers to the speaker as a \"messenger\". The revelation indicates that the \"very purpose\" of the golden plates is to ensure the Lamanites know about the Nephites, and \"come to the knowledge of their fathers, and...that they may believe the gospel and rely upon the merits of Jesus Christ\".\n; September: Lucy, Hyrum, and Samuel Smith stop attending the Presbyterian church in Palmyra.\n; 22 September: On this, the anniversary of Smith's Cumorah visits, Smith begins translating again, using his seer stone. Smith begins translating where he left off, now known as the Book of Mosiah.\n; September 1828 to March 1829: Samuel, Emma, and her brother Reuben Hale serve as Smith's scribes. Translation is sporadic because Smith has to work to support his family, and very little gets translated until April 1829.\n; October: Cowdery takes a job teaching school in Manchester. He boards with the Smiths in Manchester.\n; aft. 22 September 1828: Smith Sr. and Lucy visit Smith Jr. and Emma at Harmony and meet the Hales.\n1829\n; February: Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith travel to Harmony. Smith dictates a revelation calling the elder Smith to take part in a \"marvelous work\". The revelation refers to God in the third person.\n; March: Martin Harris becomes skeptical about the golden plates, and asks Smith to let him see them. Smith dictates a revelation for Harris. Unlike prior revelations, this one refers to God in the first person. It also says that Smith had \"entered into a covenant\" with God not to show the plates to anyone unless God commands otherwise. It says that Smith \"has a gift to translate the book, and I have commanded him that he shall pretend to no other gift, for I will grant him no other gift\". While future generations would have access to the plates, in the present generation, the words of the book would go out with the testimony of the Three Witnesses who would have \"power, that they may behold and view [the plates] as they are, and to none else will I grant this power, to receive this same testimony among this generation.\" For the first time, a Smith revelation specifically refers to the restoration of a church: \"[I]f the people of this generation harden not their hearts, I will work a reformation among them, and I will put down all lyings, and deceivings, and priestcrafts, and envyings, and strifes, and idolatries, and sorceries, and all manner of iniquities, and I will establish my church, like unto the church which was taught by my disciples in the days of old.\" The revelation says that Harris could be one of the three witnesses if he humbles himself. However, if he sees the plates, Harris is commanded to say nothing more than \"I have seen them, and they have been shown unto me by the power of God\". Because of a conspiracy to destroy Smith, he is commanded to translate a few more pages, and then \"stop for a season, even until I command thee again\".\n; March: Harris returns to Palmyra.\n; 5 April: Oliver Cowdery, a school teacher and dowser, arrives in Harmony with Samuel.\n; 7 April: Cowdery begins acting as Smith's scribe while translating the golden plates.\n; April: Smith dictates a revelation calling Cowdery to assist with a \"marvelous work\", and referring to the \"cause of Zion\". The revelation refers to Cowdery's \"gift\" (dowsing) and instructs Cowdery to \"exercise thy gift, that thou mayest find out mysteries.\" He is only to reveal his gift to \"those which are of thy faith\". The revelation refers to \"records which contain much of my gospel, which have been kept back because of the wickedness of the people.\" Cowdery is to use his \"gift\" to assist in bringing these records to light. Both Cowdery and Smith are given the \"keys\" to this gift, so that \"in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established\".\n; April: Smith dictates what is characterized as a translation of a parchment written by John the Apostle and \"hid up by himself\". The revelation says that John will \"tarry\" on the earth until the Second Coming.\n; April: Smith dictates a revelation referring to Cowdery's two \"gifts\". The first gift is Cowdery's ability to \"receive a knowledge concerning the engravings of old records, which are ancient\". The second gift is \"working with the rod\" (dowsing). The revelation says \"there is no other power save God, that can cause this rod of nature, to work in your hands, for it is the work of God\". Cowdery is commanded to \"[a]sk that you may know the mysteries of God, and that you may translate all those ancient records, which have been hid up....\"\n; April: Cowdery begins to translate (perhaps by dowsing), then returns to acting as Smith's scribe. Smith dictates a revelation indicating that God took away his gift to translate for the time being because he was not persistent, and misunderstood the nature of translation, which requires the translator to \"study it out in your mind\". After the golden plates were translated, the revelation says, Cowdery could assist with translating \"other records\".\n; abt. April: Smith dictates a portion of the golden plates telling a story of Alma the Elder, who baptized his followers by immersion, \"having authority from the Almighty God\", and called his community of believers the \"church of God, or the church of Christ\". (Mosiah 18:13–17). The book described the clergy in Alma's church as consisting of priests, who were unpaid and were to \"preach nothing save it were repentance and faith in the Lord\". (Mosiah 18:20). Alma later established many churches, which were considered \"one church\" because \"there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.\" (Mosiah 25:22). In addition to priests, the clergy of these churches included teachers (Mosiah 25:21) and elders. (Alma 4:7).\n; about May: Smith dictates part of his translation (Third Nephi chapter 11) describing the exact mode of baptism by immersion, including the exact words to use. According to Oliver Cowdery's later reminiscence, \"after writing the account given of the Savior's ministry to the remnant of the seed of Jacob, upon this continent, it was easily to be seen . . . that . . . none had authority from God to administer the ordinances of the Gospel.\"\n; 15 May: Smith and Cowdery baptize each other. Years later, details gradually emerged concerning a vision prior to this baptism: In 1832, Smith's unpublished history indicated that the priesthood had been received by the \"ministering of angels\". In an 1834 publication, Cowdery first told the story of receiving the Aaronic priesthood on this date via a vision of John the Baptist, and then of Smith and Cowdery baptizing each other. Smith essentially agreed with Cowdery's account of the vision.\n; May: As the translation proceeds, Smith dictates a revelation claiming that the lost 116 manuscript pages still exist, and that the people who possess them have altered them and are waiting for Smith to re-translate the same material. Then, these people plan to argue that Smith cannot translate the same material twice, and thus Smith has only \"pretended to translate\". Thus, the revelation directs Smith not to re-translate the Book of Lehi. The revelation indicates that the originally-translated Book of Lehi had indicated that it was just an \"abridgment\" of the \"plates of Nephi\". Thus, Smith is directed to translate the \"plates of Nephi\", containing a \"more particular account\" of the material Smith had already translated. Smith is only to translate the \"first part\" of these \"plates of Nephi\", however, continuing down to the reign of King Benjamin, which Smith had already translated from the abridgment. The revelation also speaks of \"establishing my gospel that there may not be so much contention\". It defined the church of Christ as follows: \"whoso repenteth, and cometh unto me, the same is my church: whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me: therefore, he is not of my church\".\n; May: Smith dictates a revelation  calling his brother Hyrum to assist in a \"marvelous work\", but he is not yet called to preach, but he is to be patient, meanwhile praying that he can assist in \"the translation of my work\". The revelation says that Hyrum \"hast a gift, or thou shalt have a gift\", and refers to \"that which you [Hyrum] are translating\".\n; May: Smith dictates a revelation calling Joseph Knight to assist in a \"marvelous work\".\n; 1 June: Smith moves to Fayette, New York and continues translation at the home of Peter Whitmer Sr.\n; early June: Smith dictates a revelation calling David Whitmer to assist with the \"marvelous work\". Whitmer is told that if he asks with faith he \"may stand as a witness of the things of which [he] shall both hear and see\".\n; early June: Smith dictates a revelation calling John Whitmer to assist with the \"marvelous work\". Whitmer becomes one of Smith's scribes.\n; early June: Smith dictates a revelation calling Peter Whitmer Sr. to assist with the \"marvelous work\".\n; early June: Smith and Cowdery begin baptizing new converts in Seneca Lake, including Hyrum Smith, David Whitmer, and Peter Whitmer Jr.\n; early June: Years later, after 1839, Smith recalls that he and others gathered in the \"chamber of Mr. Whitmer's house\", where they heard a voice commanding them to ordain elders, but they refrained from doing so until the organization of the church.\n; between June 1 and 14: Smith dictates a revelation directed to Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, referring to Smith's previous baptism of Cowdery (presumably on May 15) and instructing Cowdery to \"build up my church\". Both Cowdery and Whitmer are called to \"cry repentance unto this people\" and to \"search out\" the identities of the twelve disciples whom God had called and given power to baptize and to ordain priests and teachers. Cowdery and Whitmer will know the identities of these twelve \"by their desires and their works\".\n; 11 June: Using a title page that Smith says was written by Moroni, Smith obtains a copyright for the Book of Mormon (the name of his translation of the golden plates).\n; first half of June: Smith sends Martin Harris with a copy of the Book of Mormon title page and a few pages of translation to Palmyra to see if E. B. Grandin, owner of The Wayne Sentinel, will agree to publish it. Harris meets with Grandin twice, and the second time threatens that if Grandin does not publish it, they will publish it in Rochester, New York. Grandin provides an approximate estimate of costs, but declines to publish the book.\n; about June?: Smith directly or indirectly approaches Thurlow Weed, a well-known anti-Masonic publisher and activist in Rochester, New York about printing the Book of Mormon. Weed refuses.\n; about June?: Smith attempts unsuccessfully to secure the financial assistance for publishing the Book of Mormon from several family acquaintances including George Crane (a Quaker).\n; June: Smith begins dictating a replacement section for the Book of Lehi, beginning with the First Book of Nephi.\n; 14 June: Oliver Cowdery sends a letter to Hyrum Smith referencing language from the \"twelve disciples\" revelation.\n; abt. June or later: Oliver Cowdery receives a revelation called the Articles of the Church of Christ, about \"how he should build up his church & the manner thereof\". it discusses the ordination of priest and teachers, and calls members to meet regularly to partake of bread and wine. Cowdery is described as \"an Apostle of Christ\". The revelation contains language found in the \"twelve disciples\" and \"three witnesses\" revelations.\n; June: Smith dictated the following text from the Second Book of Nephi (found at ): \"Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it, save it be that three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book, and the things therein. And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few, according to the will of God...\" According to information added in 1852 to the History of the Church (but absent in the 1842 Times and Seasons publication of the same material), this passage initiated the idea of showing the plates to three witnesses. There is a similar passage in the Book of Ether, and that passage might have been the spark (as proposed by several later editions of History of the Church). It is not known whether the Book of Ether was translated before or after the Second Book of Nephi.\n; second half of June: Smith dictates a revelation to Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris that if they have faith, they may be the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon, as well as the sword of Laban, the Urim and Thummim, and the Liahona.\n; second half of June: Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris become the first Three Witnesses, other than Smith, of the golden plates by seeing them in a vision in Fayette.\n; 19 June?: Eight Witnesses, Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer Jr., John Whitmer, Hiram Page, Joseph Smith Sr., Hyrum Smith, and Samuel H. Smith, visit a grove near the Smith family home in Manchester  and have an experience described in a later \"Testimony of Eight Witnesses\" published as part of the 1830 Book of Mormon. The statement says, with regard to the golden plates, that they \"did handle with our hands and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work and of curious workmanship.\" There are differing opinions on whether the witnesses believe they had seen the plates in vision, or with their natural eyes. Lucy Mack Smith says that the plates had been carried by this grove by \"one of the ancient Nephites.\" The June 19 date is suggested because Lucy Mack Smith said the event occurred on a Thursday, and that the following Monday, the company went to visit E.B. Grandin to see if he will publish the Book of Mormon.\n; 22 June?: According to Lucy Mack Smith, the company from Fayette who had been among the Eight Witnesses \"went to Palmyra to make arrangements for getting the book printed; and they succeeded in making a contract with one E. B. Grandin, but did not draw the writings at that time.\" The June 19 date is suggested because Lucy Mack Smith said the event occurred on a Monday of the week prior to the Thursday on which the demonstration to the Eight Witnesses occurred.\n; 23 June?: According to Lucy Mack Smith, the company from Fayette \"returned home, excepting Joseph, and Peter Whitmer, Joseph remaining to draw writings in regard to the printing of the manuscript, which was to be done on the day following.\" Lucy Smith said this happened \"the next day\" after the visit to Grandin's office.\n; 24 June?: According to Lucy Mack Smith, as Joseph Smith was setting off to Palmyra to sign the contract with Grandin for the printing of the Book of Mormon, he was informed by a Dr. M'Intyre that a group of 40 men was forming to interfere with his journey. As the men sat along a fence along the way, Smith greeted them cheerfully, one-by-one and by name, and was allowed to pass by. He signed the documents and returned to Manchester.\n; 26 June: The title page of the Book of Mormon is published in The Wayne Sentinel, the weekly Palmyra newspaper published by E. B. Grandin. Grandin announces that he intends to publish the book \"as soon as the translation is complete\". Grandin had received a copy of the title page from Smith earlier in June.\n; end of June: Smith completes translation of the Book of Mormon.\n; 11 August: The anti-Masonic Palmyra Freeman calls the Book of Mormon \"the greatest piece of superstition that has come to our knowledge.\" The article gives an account of how the plates were found by Joseph Smith, referring to three visits by \"the spirit of the Almighty\", \"a huge pair of spectacles\", golden plates of dimensions eight by eight by six inches, Harris' visit to Samuel Mitchill. The article reproduces the title page of the Book of Mormon. No known copies survive, but the article was reprinted in other newspapers such as the Niagara Courier (27 August 1829).\n; 25 August: A contract is drawn up with E.B. Grandin to print 5,000 copies of the Book of Mormon for $3,000.

Cole announces, \"The Golden Bible, by Joseph Smith, author and proprietor, is now in press and will shortly appear. Priestcraft is short lived!\"\n; 16 September: In Abner Cole's Palmyra Reflector, he writes, \"'The Book of Mormon' is expected to be ready for delivery in the course of one year — Great and marvellous things will \"come to pass\" about those days.\"\n; 23 September: In Abner Cole's Palmyra Reflector, he writes, \"We understand that the Anti-Masons have declared war against the Gold Bible—O! how impious! / The number of Gold Bible Apostles is said to be complete. Jo Smith Jr. is about to assign to each, a mission to the heathen. We understand that Abraham Chaddock intends to build the first house in Harris' New-Jerusalem.... / Some few evenings since, a man in the town of Mendon, had a loud call to go and preach the doctrines contained in the Gold Bible, under heavy denunciations.\"\n; 30 September: In Abner Cole's Palmyra Reflector, he accuses the editor of the anti-Masonic Palmyra Freeman of plagiarizing the Book of Mormon by using the phrase \"Beware of SECRET ASSOCIATIONS\". Cole notes that \"The 'Gold Bible' is fast gaining credit; the rapid spread of Islamism was no touch to it!\"\n; 4–22 October: Smith arrives in Harmony and writes a letter to Oliver Cowdery (still in Manchester) that he has bought a horse from Josiah Stowell, and wants someone to come pick it up.\n; 7 October: In Abner Cole's Palmyra Reflector, he refers mockingly to an article in the Palmyra Freeman (now lost) about Mormonism, and how \"the building of the TEMPLE OF NEPHI is to be commenced about the beginning of the first year of the Millennium\", and how Mormons were claiming that the Book of Mormon would \"astonish the natives\".\n; 8 October: Smith and Oliver Cowdery purchase a copy of the Authorized Version of the Bible, Old Testament Apocrypha included, at the E.
