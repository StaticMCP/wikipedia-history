      "text": "# List of former presidents of the United States who ran for office\n\nThis is a list of former presidents of the United States who ran for office (the presidency, a seat in Congress, or governor) after leaving office as president. It does not include presidents who sought reelection to a consecutive term while still in office. Prior to the passage of the 22nd Amendment, presidents could run for reelection without restriction; since then, presidents can be reelected only once. Grover Cleveland was the first president to win reelection after leaving office.\nSome presidents have been recruited, requested, or drafted to run again. This list, however, only includes those presidents who actively campaigned.\n__TOC__\nPresidency\nThis list only includes former presidents who ran again for president.\n{| class=wikitable\n|- valign=bottom\n!
