The 2.5-story wood-frame house was built c. 1830, and was probably moved to its present location around 1850.  At that time it also received stylistic modifications, giving it a more Italianate appearance.  It was further modified in the 1870s, probably by financier Edward T. Hornblower, of the Boston brokerage firm Hornblower & Page (later Hornblower & Weeks) to add Renaissance Revival elements.  A barn, estimated to date to about 1805, stands behind the house.\nThe house and barn were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Arlington, Massachusetts\nReferences"
