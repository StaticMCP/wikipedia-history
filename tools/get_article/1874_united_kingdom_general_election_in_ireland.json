The party's electoral success, in which it won 60 MPs, taking control of Irish electoral politics from the previously dominant Conservative and the Liberal parties was, the beginning of a dominance that was to see the party as the Irish Parliamentary Party control the political landscape in Ireland until its wipeout in the 1918 general election.\nHowever its success in 1874 was marred by the lack of unity within the party in the House of Commons, where many of its members in effect sat as Liberal MPs and voted against their own Irish colleagues. It was not until then chairman Charles Stewart Parnell in the early 1880s introduced a strict whip that the party began to exercise serious influence, and act as a unit, at Westminster.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\" colspan=2 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| % Change\n|-\n|\n| align=center| 60\n| align=center| New\n| align=center| 90,234\n| align=center| 39.6\n| align=center| 39.6\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 33\n| align=\"center\" | 6\n| align=\"center\" | 91,702\n| align=\"center\" | 40.8\n| align=\"center\" | 1.1\n|-\n|\n| align=center| 10\n| align=center| 56\n| align=center| 39,778\n| align=center| 18.4\n| align=center| 39.5\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#D3D3D3\" | &nbsp;\n| Other (Incl. the Catholic Union)\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 2,934\n| align=\"center\" | 1.2\n| align=\"center\" | 1.0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"font-weight:bold; background:rgb(232,232,232);\"\n| colspan=2 style=text-align:right| Total\n| align=center|103\n| align=center| 2\n| align=center|224,648\n| align=center|100.0\n| align=center|\n|}\n|40.82}}\n|40.17}}\n|17.71}}\n}}\n|58.35}}\n|31.42}}\n|9.71}}\n}}\nSee also\n* History of Ireland (1801–1923)\nNotes\nSources\n*\nReferences"
