Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches.\nIn the final AP poll, the 1963 Northern Illinois Huskies football team (10–0) was rated as the small-college champion. The Huskies were led by the record-setting passing of quarterback George Bork.\nIn the final UPI poll, the 1963 Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football team (8–0) was rated as the small-college champion. Delaware was ranked No. 2 in the AP poll.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in
