Following the National Schism, soldiers of the Provisional Government of National Defence, that was set up in opposition to King Constantine, wore the latter side as the obverse.\nThe ribbon of the medal is 3.2 centimeters wide, blue edged with white stripes, and a thin green stripe in the middle. A version for non-military personnel, who rendered services to the Greek military, was also instituted, with blue and white reversed.\nAward terms\nThe period for which the medal was awarded was defined as 20 February – 26 July 1913. In addition, four battle clasps were authorized for the medal for specific battles and operations:\n* Kilkis-Lachanas, for the opening period of the war, from 16–21 June 1913, as well as clashes in the Mount Pangaion area before the formal outbreak of hostilities, as far back as 20 February\n* Beles, for the Greek advance northwards, from 22–27 June 1913\n* Kresna-Djumaya, for the final battles of the war in the Kresna Gorge area, from 6–17 July 1913\n* Nevrokopion, for all operations east of the River Strymon\nAn additional clasp for Macedonia-Thrace was later added to cover landing operations on the Aegean coast during the war. In addition, there were special clasps, for those wounded in action, featuring two crossed swords, and for those killed in action, featuring a Greek cross. Only military personnel directly involved in combat was liable for the award of a clasp. Awardees of the non-military version, as well as military personnel that served only in the rear services, military staffs, hospitals, etc. did not have the right to a clasp. The bars were worn by chronological order, with the first on top.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n* }}"
