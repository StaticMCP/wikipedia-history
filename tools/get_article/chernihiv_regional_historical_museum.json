Tarnovsky (Ukrainian: Чернігівський обласний історичний музей) is one of the oldest and most famous museums in Ukraine. The museum is located in the former governor's house in Chernihiv (XIX century).\nHistory\nOrigin\nThe museum was founded on 14 November 14 1896 as the Chernihiv Regional Scientific Archival Commission and its Historical Museum. In 1902, the Museum of Ukrainian Antiquities named after Vasyl Vasilyevich Tarnovsky was founded based on the collection of Vasyl Tarnovsky Jr.\nDuring the USSR\nIn 1923, five museums of Chernihiv were united in the Chernihiv State Museum. In 1925, the building of the former Peasant City Bank was assigned to the Chernihiv State Unified Museum.\nIn 1933, Vasyl Tarnovsky's Shevchenko collection was removed from the museum (some items are currently stored at the Institute of Literature of the National Academy of Ukraine and the Taras Shevchenko National Museum). With the outbreak of World War II, part of the museum's collection was evacuated to Ufa and Orenburg. The museum building, hit by a bomb, was severely damaged by fire. In December 1943, after the liberation of Chernihiv, the museum resumed its activities in the premises of the Museum of Ukrainian Antiquities. In 1989, the Chernihiv Regional Archaeological Center was established.\nIn 1986, the Chernihiv Military History Museum concerning the Battle of Chernihiv was transferred to the Chernihiv Historical Museum as a department.\nIndependent Ukraine\nIn 1992, the Chernihiv Military History Museum became the Military History Department of the Chernihiv Regional Historical Museum named after Vasyl Vasilyevich Tarnovsky. In 1997, the museum was renamed \"Chernihiv Regional Historical Museum named after Vasyl Vasilyevich Tarnovsky\". In 2002, events were held in the building to celebrate the centenary of the opening of the Vasyl Vasilyevich Tarnovsky Museum of Ukrainian Antiquities. On 6 March 2022, during the Siege of Chernihiv, the main building of the museum was damaged, where it sheltered residents during the siege.\nDescription\nThe museum preserves many items related to the name of Ivan Mazepa. The museum's collection includes also over 150,000 historical and cultural monuments. These include Cossack jewelry, weapons, military equipment, clothing, church and household utensils, jewelry, and more. Documentary monuments of the Cossack era are represented by 156 universal hetman archives, ancient prints, municipalities, magistrates, and monasteries, archives of judicial institutions, manuscripts, and family archives.\nTransport connections\n* There are buses from the main Chernihiv–Ovruch railway train station or taxi just outside the museum.\n* From Krasna Square and Myru Avenue the museum  is about five minues walking.\nGallery\nFile:2015 Будинок губернатора Чернігів.jpg|\nFile:Чернігівський обласний історичний музей імені В.
