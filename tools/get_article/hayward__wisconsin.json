Its population was 2,533 at the 2020 census. The city was formally organized in 1883. It is near the Namekagon River and is surrounded by the Town of Hayward.\nHistory\nEarly history\nBefore logging, the area that would become Hayward was a forest of pine and hardwoods cut by rivers and lakes. In later years Ojibwe people dominated the area along with much of northern Wisconsin. They were part of what is known as the Anishinaabe group, which consists of Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Ottawa tribes. They traveled on an over 500 year journey to this region from what is now known as Newfoundland. The Anishinaabe people held intense spiritual connections with the land they lived on known as \"place making\". The land was significant as it guided their identities and traditions. Their journey here was guided by a series of prophecies that explained the \"chosen ground\" would be one in which food grows on water. When they arrived they lived off the resources provided by the lakes in these areas through fishing, hunting, and gathering wild rice known as Manoomin or the \"Food the Grows on Water\". In 1745, a group of Ojibwe people, known as Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, settled near Hayward, WI, until the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters, when they ceded it to the U.S. Along with the Homestead Act of 1862.\nLogging along the Namekagon River had begun by 1864, when government surveyors noted that T. Mackey had a logging camp on the river at what would become Hayward. In the winter of 1878 Anthony Judson Hayward walked up on the ice, assessed mill sites and timber possibilities upstream, and decided to build a lumber mill. Until 1880 the spot was connected to the outside world only by river or logging tote roads, but in that year the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway built its tracks through, connecting it to the Twin Cities and Chicago, and making Anthony Hayward's sawmill plan much more lucrative. He found financial backing and a partner in Robert Laird McCormick and managed to buy the last parcels of land for his sawmill in 1881. Their North Wisconsin Lumber Company dammed the river at the site of the current Hayward dam and built a sawmill, shingle mill, and planing mill to the north, called by 1883 \"the Big Mill.\" The damming had significant effects on the Ojibwe families living here. 5,600 acres of reservation land were flooded. Much of this land consisted of rice beds, cemeteries, and villages, disrupting the homes, traditional food gathering practices, and resting places of many. \"“There were bodies floating out of the Flowage for years afterward,” said Patty Loew, a retired journalism professor who has written several books on the history of tribes and is a citizen of the Mashkiiziibii, also known as the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.\"\nThat same year the village of Hayward was platted and Sawyer County was established, formed from parts of early versions of Chippewa and Ashland Counties. The village of Hayward was designated its county seat.\nThe mill town and county seat grew. By 1897 \"2,000 souls\" lived in the village, with 120 men working in the mill. Around that time the mill produced each year about 40 million feet of lumber, 10 million lath, and 4 million shingles, and the whole mill with drying yards covered forty acres. The village had a school, four churches, a bank, a free library, a fire company, and \"nearly every Secret Society known to man.\" The village had electricity and a water works. Four blocks of the village streets were paved with brick.\nIn the surrounding country, settlers were beginning to wrest little farms out of the stump-lands cut off by the loggers. In 1896 it was reported that 432 bushels of corn were produced in Sawyer County, 610 bushels of barley, 14,516 bushels of oats, 380 bushels of rye, 1,125 tons of hay, 12,417 tons of potatoes, 3,065 bushels of non-potato root crops, and 6,500 pounds of butter. The same summary noted that dairy farming was rapidly increasing in the area.\nSteady logging eventually depleted most of the pine, and then many of the hardwoods. The Big Mill at Hayward burned in 1922 and was not rebuilt. Logging on a smaller scale has continued ever since, along with agriculture. Meanwhile, tourism has become more and more important, and traditional food gathering practices were also hindered during the \"spearfishing wars\", where the federal court allowed Ojibwe people to maintain the right to fish off the reservation at night during spawning season. This resulted in a negative response from the surrounding community who feared a decrease in fish population and therefore a decrease in tourism. A radio station called WOJB used its platform to highlight perspectives from both sides of the conflict and promoting unity through music.\nHayward Indian Residential School\nIn 1901, the Hayward Indian Residential School was established in Hayward. It was founded to assimilate indigenous children into white Christian American culture. Most of the students were Ojibwe and came from the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation ten miles away from the school. The school operated until 1934, when it closed due to being understaffed, underfunded, and overcrowded. During its operation, thousands of students passed through the school. Some were taken forcibly from their families. At the school, children were forced to take on Christian names, cut their hair, wear military style uniforms, and march in military formations. Boys and girls were strictly segregated in separate buildings.\nThe curriculum focused on English language, Christian religion, and industrial labor. Provision of teachers was so poor that few students graduated, and graduation certificates were withheld from students who were thought likely to return to their reservations instead of assimilating into white society. The school was funded in part by the government and in part by the labor of the children in agriculture and sewing. Male children cleared over 260 acres for cultivation. Girls were trained as housewives and lived in the \"Homestead Cottage\", where a female teacher taught them how to run a household. The girls sold their sewing products to support the school and prepared meals for the other students. In the first decade of the school's operation, girls were encouraged to practice Native beadwork styles, but by 1910, this had been discontinued.\nOvercrowding and poor sanitation endangered the students' health. Dishes were rarely cleaned, students slept two to a bed, and during the winter, they crowded into small rooms for indoor activities because the school had no gymnasium. Children were served moldy bread, and most of the milk the children produced from the dairy herd was sold rather than fed to the children. These poor health conditions led to high rates of disease. The death rate during the 1918 flu pandemic was 10 times higher than the Wisconsin average. Students also died from epidemics of measles and pneumonia. Some students were sexually abused by the teachers.\nFor speaking their Native languages, students were punished with beatings, public humiliation, extra chores, and confinement in the school jail. The school jail was a cell with bars in the basement of the boy's dormitory, where children were fed only bread and water. Other students were punished by being forced to kneel on marbles for hours. Hayward students sometimes went out into the woods on the weekends and spoke Ojibwe together since it was forbidden in school. On one occasion, a secret drum dance was held, where students prepared by secretly sewing jingles onto their dresses and practicing their singing at night. The superintendents caught the students and punished them by burning their drums, hitting their knuckles, and forcing the girls to wear signs around their necks reading, \"I will not squaw dance\". Due to the poor conditions and harsh discipline, runaways were common; in 1920 alone, 69 children ran away from the school. In 2024, the Department of the Interior released a report that stated three students who died during their time at the school had been identified.\nThe school closed in 1934 and was converted to the Hayward Area Memorial Hospital.\nGeography\nHayward is located at  (46.01, -91.480556).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which  is covered by water.\nHayward is 71 miles southeast of Superior, 27 miles northeast of Spooner, about 107 miles north of Eau Claire, and 57 miles southwest of Ashland.\nClimate\n}}\nDemographics\n}}\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010,  2,318 people, 1,048 households, and 550 families resided in the city.
