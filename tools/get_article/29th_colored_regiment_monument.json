Recruiting began in August 1863 and the Connecticut General Assembly passed legislation for the creation of the black regiment that would have white officers. In January 1864, the 29th Regiment was filled and mustered in Fair Haven, Connecticut in March 1864. The 29th Regiment fought in the Siege of Petersburg in Petersburg, Virginia from August 12 through September 24 and took several other actions in Virginia before arriving in Richmond, Virginia and witnessed President Abraham Lincoln's address on April 5, 1865.\nReferences\nExternal links"
