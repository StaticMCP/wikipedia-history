The nominations were selected by members of the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinema.\nThe award was first made in 1986, but was discontinued after only five years due to the difficulty the organisers found in crediting a single individual or team with the design of the poster, which was often a collaborative work by several teams. Moreover, many film posters were not French, being imported, particularly from America.\nThe five winners of the Best Poster award were:\n:1986: Harem, poster design by Michel Landi\n:1987: 37°2 le matin (released in English as Betty Blue), by Christian Blondel\n:1988: Tandem, by Stéphane Bielikoff\n:1989: La Petite Voleuse (released in English as The Little Thief), by Annie Miller, Luc Roux and Stéphane Bielikoff\n:1990: Cinema Paradiso, by Jouineau Bourduge\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.lescesarducinema.com Académie des César]"
