Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Niger accepted the convention on 23 December 1974, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. There are three World Heritage Sites in Niger, one of them W-Arly-Pendjari Complex it's shared with Benin and Burkina Faso.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\nIn danger|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"|Air and Ténéré Natural Reserves\n|\n| Agadez\n| 1991\n| 573; vii, ix, x (cultural)\n| This is the largest protected area in Africa, covering some 7.7 million ha, though the area considered a protected sanctuary constitutes only one-sixth of the total area. It includes the volcanic rock mass of the Aïr, a small Sahelian pocket, isolated as regards its climate and flora and fauna, and situated in the Saharan desert of Ténéré. The reserves boast an outstanding variety of landscapes, plant species and wild animals.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF\"|W-Arly-Pendjari Complex\n|\n| Tillabéri\n|1996\n| 749ter; ix, x (cultural)\n|This transnational extension (Benin, Burkina Faso) to the W National Park of Niger, inscribed in 1996 on the World Heritage List, cover a major expanse of intact Sudano-Sahelian savannah, with vegetation types including grasslands, shrub lands, wooded savannah and extensive gallery forests. It includes the largest and most important continuum of terrestrial, semi-aquatic and aquatic ecosystems in the West African savannah belt. The property is a refuge for wildlife species that have disappeared elsewhere in West Africa or are highly threatened. It is home to the largest population of elephants in West Africa and most of the large mammals typical of the region, such as the African Manatee, cheetah, lion and leopard. It also harbours the only viable population of lions in the region.\n|-\n| Historic Centre of Agadez\n|\n| Agadez\n| 2013\n| 1268; ii, iii (cultural)\n|Known as the gateway to the desert, Agadez, on the southern edge of the Sahara desert, developed in the 15th and 16th centuries when the Sultanate of Aïr was established  and Touareg tribes were sedentarized in the city, respecting the boundaries of old encampments, which gave rise to a street pattern still in place today. The historic centre of the city, an important crossroads of the caravan trade, is divided into 11 quarters with irregular shapes. They contain numerous earthen dwellings and a well-preserved group of palatial and religious buildings including a 27m high  minaret made entirely of mud brick, the highest such structure in the world.  The site is marked by ancestral cultural, commercial and handicraft traditions still practiced today and presents exceptional and sophisticated examples of earthen architecture.\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Niger maintains 19 properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Old City of Zinder, Birni district and the Sultanate\n|\n|Zinder Region\n|align=\"center\" |2006\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Palace of the Zarmakoye of Dosso\n|\n|Dosso Region\n|align=\"center\" |2006\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Earthen Mosques of the Tahoua Region\n|\n|Tahoua Region\n|align=\"center\" |2006\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Salt Route of the Sahara Desert\n|\n|Agadez Region\n|align=\"center\" |2006\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Plateau and Fortifications of Djado\n|\n|Agadez Region\n|align=\"center\" |2006\n|i, iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Bura Archaeological Site\n|\n|Tillaberi Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Lougou Site\n|\n|Dosso Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| vii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Giraffe Zone\n|\n|Dosso Region, Tillaberi Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| ix (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Termit Massif\n|\n|Diffa Region, Zinder Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| vii (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Gadabedji Faunal Reserve\n|\n|Maradi Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| ix (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Protected Forests of the Agadez Region\n|\n|Agadez Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| vii, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Mare d’Ossolo\n|\n|Tillaberi Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| ix (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Nigerien part of Lake Chad\n|\n|Diffa Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| vii (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Niger River, islands and valley\n|\n|Dosso Region, Niamey Region, Tillaberi Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| vii, ix (mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |W National Park, archaeological sites\n|\n|Tillaberi Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| i, iii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Air and Ténéré Natural Reserves, cultural extension\n|\n|Agadez Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Dinosaur deposits of Niger\n|\n|Agadez Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| ix (mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Classified Forest, the Madarounfa Lake and the Tombs of the 99 saints\n|\n|Maradi Region\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| vii (mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Lake Chad cultural landscape\n|\n|Diffa Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n| ii, iii, vii, ix (mixed)\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
