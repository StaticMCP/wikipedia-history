The purpose was in part to raise the profile of post-war architecture, and to \"demonstrate that architecture, as an art, flourished during those years\". The list was the basis for an exhibition at the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, aimed at introducing some of these buildings as \"heritage\". The predominant view of post-war architecture, and of many modernist buildings in particular, was not favourable in the UK at the time, and the list was intended to inform the statutory listing of significant works. Some of the buildings, for example Notre Dame High School, had already been listed by Historic Scotland before the DoCoMoMo list was compiled, and several more have been designated since, including several at Category A, as \"buildings of national or international importance\".\nThe list includes a wide range of structures, from large industrial plants, to small private houses, and covers the diversity of building types that were constructed during the period. Not all the buildings have survived: two of the most prominent casualties have been Basil Spence's Hutchesontown C complex in Glasgow, demolished in 1993, and Gillespie, Kidd & Coia's St. Peter's Seminary in Cardross, which has been derelict since the late 1980s.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n!
