The AP poll was released after the playoffs and ranked Central Michigan first.\nThe 1974 NCAA Division II football season was the 17th year UPI published a small-college poll and it was the 15th year the Associated Press published their small-college poll. These \"small college\" polls were discontinued after this season.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nAP poll\n|Week2Date  = Sept 25\n|Week3Date  = Oct 2\n|Week4Date  = Oct 9\n|Week5Date  = Oct 16\n|Week6Date  = Oct 23\n|Week7Date  = Oct 30\n|Week8Date  = Nov 6\n|Week9Date  = Nov 13\n|Week10Date  = Nov 20\n|Week11Date  = Nov 27\n|Week12Date  = Postseason\n|Week1-1    = Western Kentucky (1–0) (9)\n|Week1-2    = Louisiana Tech (1–0) (7)\n|Week1-3    = Boise State (1–0) (5)\n|Week1-4    = Delaware (1–0) (3)\n|Week1-5    = Grambling State (1–0)\n|Week1-6    =  (1–0) (2)\n|Week1-7    = Tennessee State (1–1) (4)\n|Week1-8    = McNeese State (1–0) (1)\n|Week1-9    = Troy State (2–0)\n|Week1-10    = UNLV (1–0)\n|Week1-11    =  (1–0)\n|Week1-12    =  (1–0) (1)\n|Week1-13    =  (1–0)\n|Week1-14    = Jacksonville State (0–1)\n|Week1-15    =  (1–0)\n|Week1-16    = &nbsp;\n|Week2-1        = Louisiana Tech (2–0) (23)\n|Week2-1-Color  = u\n|Week2-2        = Western Kentucky (1–0) (11)\n|Week2-2-Color  = d\n|Week2-3        = Boise State (2–0) (6)\n|Week2-3-Color  =\n|Week2-4        = Delaware (2–0) (3)\n|Week2-4-Color  =\n|Week2-5        = McNeese State (2–0) (1)\n|Week2-5-Color  = u\n|Week2-6        = Abilene Christian (2–0) (1)\n|Week2-6-Color  =\n|Week2-7        = UNLV (2–0)\n|Week2-7-Color  = u\n|Week2-8        = Tennessee State (2–1)\n|Week2-8-Color  = d\n|Week2-9        = Troy State (3–0) (1)\n|Week2-9-Color  =\n|Week2-10        = Indiana State (2–0) т\n|Week2-10-Color  = tu\n|Week2-11        = North Dakota (1–1) т\n|Week2-11-Color  = t\n|Week2-12        = Stephen F.
