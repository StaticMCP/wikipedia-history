He was a 6'3\" swingman.\nBorn in Sparta, Georgia, Warren attended Far Rockaway High School in Queens, New York, and played college basketball for the St. John's Red Storm from 1966 to 1969. He scored 1,306 points in 84 games and was considered his team's strongest defender. The St. John's basketball media guide says that Warren \"was perhaps St. John’s most complete player\".\nAfter his collegiate career, Warren played five seasons (1969–1974) in the National Basketball Association as a member of the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers.  He averaged 6.0 points per game and won a league championship with New York in 1970. He currently holds the record for most field goals made without a miss in Cleveland Cavaliers history (12 for 12).\nWhile playing for the Cavaliers on December 9, 1970, Warren mistakenly scored for the Portland Trail Blazers on a fast break lay-up at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Leroy Ellis of Portland received credit for the points, although he had tried to block the shot.\nWarren was elected to the St. John's Hall of Fame in 1986. He currently resides in New York with his wife, Rhia.  He has two children, John III and Joy.\nCareer statistics\nNBA/ABA\nSource\nRegular season\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Team\n! GP\n!
