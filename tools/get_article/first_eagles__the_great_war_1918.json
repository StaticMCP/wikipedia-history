This pack also includes new campaigns set over the Cambrai sector of France.\nIn 2008, First Eagles: Gold, a combo pack that contains both the original First Eagles and Expansion Pack 1, was released.\nIn February 2010, First Eagles 2 was released, following the trend of upgrading to be compatible with Vista and Windows 7.\nGameplay\nEvery encounter in World War I aerial combat is a close range turning dogfight that can have many outcomes including the planes colliding, spinning out of control, crashing into the ground, being hit by anti aircraft artillery, or being shot down or killed, depending on the game skill level set and the players skill level.\nThe game has a useful 'Single Mission' option that allows the user to choose their mission, aircraft type, weapons, year, nationality, weather, and time of day, and look at a map of the mission area. A set of names are generated to be included on the squadron roster and they are allocated varying skill levels (ranks). Flight above enemy territory results in anti-aircraft fire.\nSee also\n*Third Wire\n*Strike Fighters: Project 1\n*Falcon 4.0\n*List of World War I video games\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thirdwire.com/ Developers site]"
