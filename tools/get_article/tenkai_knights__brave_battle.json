It was released for the Nintendo 3DS on September 25, 2014 in Japan and on October 7, 2014 in North America.\nStory\nThe game involves the group: Guren, Ceylan, Toxsa and Chooki. The group accidentally falls through an inter-dimensional portal. When they find themselves on the other side of the portal, the group appears in another world and have assumed the mantles of Bravenwolf, Tributon, Valorn and Lydendor — otherwise known as the legendary Tenkai Knights. They fight evil to protect both dimensions.\nGameplay\nIn Tenkai Knights: Brave Battle, the player builds and customizes robots and then engages in combat with other robots. The game draws inspiration from the Tenkai Knights animated series.\nReception\n}}\nHardcore Gamer gave the game a 1/5, saying \"The level of pure apathy on display must be seen to be believed, with practically everything boiling down to slight variations on the first level. Combat is frustrating, stages are painfully confining and difficulty ramps up too quickly. \"\nReferences"
