Established in 1922, the cross may be awarded only in time of war.\nAppearance\nThe medal is a Greek cross made of copper. Inscribed on the horizontal arms is Al Valore Militare (For Military Valor). On the top arm of the cross is the monogram of the Italian Republic. The bottom arm depicts a Roman sword sheathed in bay leaves. The back of the cross depicts a five-pointed star, with rays radiating from behind that star out to the arms of the cross. The cross is suspended from a solid blue ribbon.\nNotable recipients\n* Prince Aimone, Duke of Aosta\n* Vernon Baker; Second Lieutenant, U.S. Army, MoH\n* Heinrich Bleichrodt; German Kriegsmarine\n* Gaetano Costa; Regia Aeronautica\n* Douglas Fairbanks Jr, U.S. Navy\n* Carlo Fecia di Cossato; Commander, Regia Marina\n* Hamilton H.
