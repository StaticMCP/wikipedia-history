This product is known as the SG2 Shareable (Fire Control) Software Suite (S4) and is sometimes abbreviated as S4 when referenced.\nFire-control system developers and most of the international (primarily NATO) ballistics communities are familiar with the mature NATO Armaments Ballistic Kernel (NABK) and other software component items that have emerged from the NABK development effort. The collection of these software items has been enhanced into the “suite” of NATO shareable fire control software.\nS4 is one of the biggest pluses for [https://vanguardcanada.com/integration-and-interoperability-at-the-core-of-canadas-c4isr-solution/ NATO interoperability in the fire support domain] and [https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2023/11/10/turning-standard-ammunition-into-sharable-ammunition/ ammunition shareability].\nSignificant development effort occurs in Aberdeen, Maryland, USA in the Firing Tables and Ballistics (FTaB) Division, Armaments Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) with contributions from a variety of agencies within participating NATO nations.\nNATO Standardization Agreements (STANAGS) and Supporting Research\nThe S4 implements a variety of NATO Standardization Agreements (STANAGs) including STANAG 4355 and STANAG 6022.\nwhich are the basis for S4 technology]]\nA number of papers and presentations have been published, such as a formal description of the early history of the suite and a later presentation in the International Symposium of Ballistics (ISB) forum sponsored by the [http://www.ballistics.org/ International Ballistics Society (IBS)].\n[http://www.hsu-hh.de/mit/index_tQ8Jt6q7o77XYTKW.html Professur für Mess- und Informationstechnik] (S4 testing research and related contributions by Germany)\n[http://www.hsu-hh.de/mit/index_6ErpEIxUgVmppHGV.html Professur für Mess- und Informationstechnik] (Crest Clearance algorithm contributions by Germany)\nIntegrating Weapon Systems\nSpecific examples include:\nCanada\n*\nDenmark\n*\n*\nFrance\n*  Knds |url=https://knds.com/en/products/equipment/command-and-weapon-engagement-systems |access-date=2025-08-21 |website=www.nexter-group.fr}}\nGermany\n* Panzerhaubitze 2000\n* Artillery Gun Module\nNorway\n*\nSweden\nTurkey\nUnited Kingdom\n*\nUnited States\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228820877_NABK_Based_Next_Generation_Ballistic_Table_Toolkit NABK BASED NEXT GENERATION BALLISTIC TABLE TOOLKIT, Sevsay Aytar Ortac, Umut Durak, Umit Kutluay, Koray Kucuk, Maj.
