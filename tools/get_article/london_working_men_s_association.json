It was one of the foundations of Chartism, advocating for universal male suffrage, equally-populated electoral districts, the abolition of property qualifications for MPs, annual Parliaments, the payment of MPs, and the establishment of secret ballot voting. The founders were William Lovett, Francis Place and Henry Hetherington. They appealed to skilled workers rather than the mass of unskilled factory labourers. They were associated with Owenite socialism and the movement for general education.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bl.uk/learning/images/Campaign_MAI/chartism/large92850.html Image of the Minute Book of the LWMA for 18 October 1836 at the British Library.]\n* [http://english.republiquelibre.org/The_Address_of_the_London_Working_Men%27s_Association_to_the_People_of_Canada The Address of the London Working Men's Association to the People of Canada], 1837\n* [http://www.chartistancestors.co.uk/six-points/ The Six Points and the London Working Men's Association]'', on [http://www.chartistancestors.co.uk Chartist Ancestors]\n*[https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/newport-rising/1839-newp-ris/ferg-oc-1840/ Feargus O'Connor & The Chartists – UK Parliament Living Heritage]"
