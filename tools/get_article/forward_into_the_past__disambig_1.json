The New Rolling Stone Record Guide claims that this album was \"brilliantly selected and programmed\" (175) while The Goldmine Comedy Record Price Guide offers no comment beyond its 2 star marking.\nRelease history\nForward Into The Past was released only as a double album.\nColumbia PG-34391\nThis album was never released on CD. Instead, in 1993 a new collection was put together under the title Shoes for Industry: The Best of the Firesign Theatre and was released by Sony/Legacy. Shoes contains most of the same tracks as Forward Into The Past but also takes advantage of the greater running time available on a Compact Disc in order to add more tracks. Shoes also includes tracks which members of the group had released on their various \"solo\" projects.\nExternal sources\n*Firesign Theatre. Forward Into The Past.
