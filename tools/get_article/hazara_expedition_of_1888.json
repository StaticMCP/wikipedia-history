As a response, the Hazara Field Force was assembled and began its march on 4 October 1888, after an ultimatum had not been satisfied by the tribes by October 2, 1888.\nThe first phase of the campaign targeted Yousafzai tribe of Black mountain such as Hassanzais and Akazais and ended with the Hassanzai and Akazai tribes requesting an armistice on October 19, 1888.\nThe second phase of the campaign targeted the Swati tribe that lived north of Black Mountain such as the Allaiwals, Thakotis, Parari Sayyids and the Tikariwals. The campaign ended when the Allaiwal village of Pokal was occupied and destroyed by the British on November 2 and 3, 1888 and Swatis tribal chief Arsala Khan Swathi temporary left his capital village Pokal without surrendering to British.\nThe then Commander in Chief in India General Sir Frederick Roberts viewed the Black Mountain Expedition as:\na success from a military point of view, but … the determination of the Punjab Government to limit the sphere of action of the troops, and to hurry out of the country, prevented our reaping any political advantage. We lost a grand opportunity for gaining control over this lawless and troublesome district; no survey was made, no roads opened out, the tribesmen were not made to feel our power, and, consequently, very soon another costly expedition had to be undertaken.\nThe failure of the tribes to honour the agreements that ended the 1888 campaign would lead to a further two-month expedition by a Hazara Field Force in 1891,  as part of the Hazara Expedition of 1891.\nBritish and Indian Army forces who took part in these expeditions received the India General Service Medal with the clasps Hazara 1888 and Hazara 1891 respectively.\nSubedar Kishanbir Nagarkoti of the 5th Gurkha Rifles received his fourth and final Indian Order of Merit for gallantry in the 1888 expedition.\nReferences"
