Viswanath. The film stars Venkatesh and Bhanupriya  in the lead, while Sharon Lowen appears in a special role. The film is about a danseuse daughter of a noted Kuchipudi exponent, wooed by a painter of banners and hoardings, who uses her as a model. The choreography is helmed by Kelucharan Mohapatra, and Sharon Lowen with soundtrack by Ilaiyaraaja. The song sequences were extensively shot at the Valley of Flowers National Park, the Nanda Devi National Park, the Shanti Stupa and Bhringesvara Siva Temple at Dhauli; and other locations in Visakhapatnam.\nFeatured in the Indian panorama section of the 12th IFFI, the Asia Pacific Film Festival and the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it fetched three Indian Express Awards, three state Nandi Awards, and two South Filmfare Awards, including Nandi Award for Best Feature Film and Filmfare Best Film Award (Telugu).\nPlot\n, where the song \"Shiva Poojaku\" was filmed]]\n, where the song \"Ghallu Ghallu\" was shot]]\nMeenakshi (Bhanupriya) and Savitri (Devilalita) are daughters of a Kuchipudi doyen,  Vedantam Seshendra Sarma. While a highly accomplished artist in his field, Seshendra Sarma is not well-off and has not been able to afford for his daughters, a conventional education. Both of them have achieved a respectable degree of proficiency — Savitri in Carnatic classical music and Meenakshi in classical dance.\nSavitri, the elder daughter, is grateful for her knowledge and interest and looks forward to a life that will require her to hone her skills in the art. Meenakshi, on the other hand, is bitter about the lack of opportunity that she feels in the field of classical dance in India and resolves to make a simpler and more pleasurable life for herself as soon as possible, while confiding her ambitions only to her sister.\nChandrasekhar (Venkatesh) is a tenant who has just moved in next door. He is a painter and is shown to be handling movie promotions as a large part of his work. He develops an interest in the neighbors and tries to help them in whatever way he can, partly because of his (unconfessed) interest in Meenakshi and partly because of his interest in the art which seems to be slowly fading from public life.\nThe rest of the film is largely built around Meenakshi's journey from skepticism to devotion in her pursuit of dance. Chandrasekhar is shown to be an important catalyst in this transformation. Meenakshi becomes an accomplished dancer through the direction of renowned Odissi dancer Sharon Lowen, and gets the opportunity to go to the United States and perform. She learns of Chandrasekhar's love for her, and finally unites with Chandrasekhar, confessing her love for him as well.\nCast\n* Venkatesh as Chandu / Chandra Shekar\n* Bhanupriya as Meenakshi\n* Shanmukha Srinivas as Srinivas\n* Sakshi Ranga Rao as Omkaram\n* Sri Lakshmi as Akhilam\n* S.
