He also contributed to the understanding of the convergence of geodesic rays in Teichmüller theory.\nMasur was a Ph.D. student of Albert Marden at the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis.\nAwards and recognitions\nThe Hubbard–Masur theorem is named after Masur and John H. Hubbard. In 2009, a conference of mathematicians honored Masur's 60th birthday in France.\nSelected papers\n*\n*\nReferences"
