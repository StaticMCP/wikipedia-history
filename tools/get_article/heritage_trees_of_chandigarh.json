One can contact the Department of Forest & Wildlife administration or Chandigarh Tree Lovers to get a copy of the booklet which they made and published with all the details.\nThose trees which are 100 years old were identified and put in a list of \"heritage status\". Out of 31, the Chandigarh government identified that 15 of them are peepal, 11 are banyan, 4 are mango trees, and only one is an earpod tree. The oldest tree which was found standing from the last 350 years is one of the peepal trees in Khudda Ali Sher village.\n]]\nFile:Chandigarh Heritage Tree 9A.jpg|alt=Chandigarh Heritage Tree 9A|Board sign Chandigarh Heritage Tree 9A\nFile:Chandigarh Heritage Tree at southern side of pgi.jpg|alt=Chandigarh Heritage Tree at southern side of pgi|Chandigarh Heritage Tree Board sign at southern side of pgi\nFile:Chandigarh Heritage Tree At PEC.jpg|alt=Chandigarh Heritage Tree At PEC|Chandigarh Heritage Tree Board sign At PEC board sign\nFile:Chandigarh Heritage Tree 9 B.jpg|alt=Chandigarh Heritage Tree 9 B|Board sign Chandigarh Heritage Tree 9 B board\nFile:Chandigarh Heritage Tree 9 C.jpg|Board sign Chandigarh Heritage Tree 9 C\nFile:Chandigarh Heritage Tree At sector 10-A.jpg|Board at Chandigarh Heritage Tree At sector 10-A\nFile:Chandigarh Heritage Tree at Punjab engineering college.jpg|Board on Chandigarh Heritage Tree at Punjab engineering college\nFile:Chandigarh Heritage Tree at southern side of PGI 02.jpg|Chandigarh Heritage Tree at southern side of PGI\nFile:Chandigarh Heritage Tree at southern side of PGI 01.jpg|Close up view Chandigarh Heritage Tree at southern side of PGI\nReferences"
