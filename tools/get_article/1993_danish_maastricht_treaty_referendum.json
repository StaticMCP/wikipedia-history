      "text": "# 1993 Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum\n\nNo:   }}\nA second referendum on the Maastricht Treaty was held in Denmark on 18 May 1993. After rejecting the treaty in a referendum the previous year, this time it was approved by 56.7% of voters with an 86.5% turnout.\nBackground\nIt was the second attempt to ratify the Maastricht Treaty, which could not come into effect unless ratified by all members of the European Union. Thus, the Edinburgh Agreement granted Denmark four exceptions from the Maastricht Treaty, leading to its eventual ratification.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||1,930,391||56.7\n|-\n|align=left|Against||1,471,914||43.3\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||34,635||–\n|-\n|align=left|Total||3,436,940||100\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||3,974,672||86.5\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Source: Nohlen & Stöver\n|}\nBy county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=text-align:right\n!rowspan=2|Region\n!colspan=2|For\n!colspan=2|Against\n!rowspan=2|Invalid/blank\n!rowspan=2|Total\n!rowspan=2|Registeredvoters\n!rowspan=2|Turnout\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|Copenhagen & Frederiksberg Municipality||165,469||44.69||204,789||55.31||4,239||374,497||443,444||84.45\n|-\n|align=left|Copenhagen County||223,328||55.43||179,589||44.57||3,601||406,518||457,930||88.77\n|-\n|align=left|Frederiksborg County||135,740||59.46||92,565||40.54||1,997||230,302||260,378||88.45\n|-\n|align=left|Roskilde County||87,768||58.95||61,117||41.05||1,311||150,196||168,528||89.12\n|-\n|align=left|West Zealand County||103,915||55.41||83,624||44.59||1,735||189,274||220,084||86.00\n|-\n|align=left|Storstrøm County||94,826||55.03||77,490||44.97||1,782||174,098||201,278||86.50\n|-\n|align=left|Bornholm County||15,086||53.02||13,366||46.98||415||28,867||34,814||82.92\n|-\n|align=left|Fyn County||172,454||56.22||134,317||43.78||3,027||309,798||359,711||86.12\n|-\n|align=left|South Jutland County||99,832||61.46||62,609||38.54||1,715||164,156||189,625||86.57\n|-\n|align=left|Ribe County||86,284||61.25||54,577||38.75||1,520||142,381||165,827||85.86\n|-\n|align=left|Vejle County||133,247||60.77||86,022||39.23||2,327||221,596||256,213||86.49\n|-\n|align=left|Ringkjøbing County||114,210||66.42||57,733||33.58||1,989||173,932||201,622||86.27\n|-\n|align=left|Århus County||230,835||57.40||171,303||42.60||4,336||406,474||466,296||87.17\n|-\n|align=left|Viborg County||92,493||62.79||54,810||37.21||1,719||149,022||174,791||85.26\n|-\n|align=left|North Jutland County||174,904||55.90||138,003||44.10||2,922||315,829||374,131||84.42\n|- class=sortbottom\n|align=left colspan=9|Source: [http://eed.nsd.uib.no/webview/velocity?v=2&mode=cube&cube=http%3A%2F%2F129.177.90.166%3A80%2Fobj%2FfCube%2FDKREF1993%21Display_C1&study=http%3A%2F%2F129.177.90.166%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FDKREF1993%21Display European Election Database]\n|}\nAftermath\nWhen the result of the referendum was announced, the outcome and frustrations about the referendum being held only a year after the Danes had rejected the previous treaty led to riots in the Nørrebro area of Copenhagen, during which police shot and wounded at least 11 people \"to prevent an injured colleague being stoned to death\". These 11 people, not in critical conditions, were subsequently treated for gunshot wounds as a result of the shooting. 90 police officers were injured during the riots.\nReferences"
