Less well-remembered are the early sermons of that young, 25-year-old pastor who first began preaching at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1954.  As a political leader in the Civil Rights Movement and as a modest preacher in a Baptist church, King evolved and matured across the span of a life cut short.  The range of his rhetoric was anticipated and encompassed within \"The Three Dimensions of a Complete Life,\" which he preached as his trial sermon at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in 1954 and every year thereafter for the rest of his life.\nSermons\n* 1953 – \"The Three Dimensions of a Complete Life\"\n* 1954 – \"Rediscovering Lost Values\", Sunday February 28, Detroit, Michigan.\n* 1955 - \"The Impassable Gulf (The Parable of Dives and Lazarus)\", Sunday October 2, Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama.\n* 1956 - \"The Death of Evil Upon the Seashore\", Wednesday May 17, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York City\n* 1956 - \"Living Under the Tensions of Modern Life\", Sunday September (exact date unknown), Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama.\n* 1956 – \"Paul's Letter to American Christians\", Sunday November 4, Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama.\n* 1957 – \"The Birth of a New Nation\", Sunday April 7, Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama.\n* 1957 – \"Garden of Gethsemane\", Sunday April 14, Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama.\n* 1957 – \"Loving Your Enemies\", Sunday November 17, Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama.\n* 1960 – \"Why Jesus Called A Man A Fool\", Sunday May 15, Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta\n** Possibly the first time King delivered a variation of this sermon, see 27 August 1967 below\n* 1963 – \"Eulogy for the Martyred Children\" (victims of 16th Street Baptist Church bombing), Wednesday September 18, Birmingham, Alabama\n* 1964 - \"Religious Witness for Human Dignity,\" May 31, Los Angeles Coliseum, California\n* 1964 - \"Religious Witness for Human Dignity,\" June 3, Goodwin Stadium, Arizona State University, and Tanner Chapel AME Church, Phoenix, Arizona\n* 1966 – \"Guidelines for a Constructive Church\", Sunday June 5, Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta\n* 1967 – \"The Three Dimensions Of A Complete Life\", Sunday April 9, New Covenant Baptist Church, Chicago.\n* 1967 - \"Three Evils of Society\" Address Delivered to the First Annual National Conference for New Politics\n* 1967 - \"The Casualties of the War in Vietnam\" Address delivered at the Nation Institute\n* 1967 – \"Why Jesus Called A Man A Fool\", Sunday August 27, Mt.
