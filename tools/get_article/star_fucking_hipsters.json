They have been called a \"punk supergroup\" and feature members from numerous notable bands including Leftöver Crack, Ensign, and The Ergs!\nHistory\nInitial formation (2005)\nThe band  was started in 2005 by Leftöver Crack vocalist/guitarist Stza, and drummer Brandon Chevalier-Kolling. However, they were derailed shortly afterward due to the death of Brandon. Stza decided to continue the band with a line-up consisting of vocalist Kisston (from Help Me Help Me I Can't Breathe), guitarist Jamie Toulon (from Old Skull), and drummer GiGi (from Another Dying Democracy).[http://www.punkbands.com/news/5576/ Choking Victim Reunion/Stza Forms The Star Fucking Hipster]  This line-up played two shows in the summer of 2005 before disbanding.\n''Until We're Dead'' (2006–2009)\nThe following year, Stza wrote and rehearsed seven new songs with Leftöver Crack drummer Ara Babajian and Ensign guitarist Frank Piegaro. Three of these songs were chosen for inclusion on \"Deadline\", Leftöver Crack's split album with Citizen Fish, while the remaining four became the basis for the first Star Fucking Hipsters record. The band continued with an entirely new group of musicians, consisting of Stza, Babajian, Piegaro, vocalist Nico de Gaillo (from Casa De Chihuahua) and bassist Yula Beeri (from The World Inferno Friendship Society and Nanuchka). Their debut album ''Until We're Dead was released by Fat Wreck Chords on September 30, 2008.\nOn December 23, 2008, the band released a music video for \"Two Cups of Tea\". Babajian and Beeri left the band shortly afterwards and were replaced by drummer Brian ”Pnut” Kozuch and bassist Chris Pothier, of the band BIG Attack!.\nNever Rest in Peace'' (2009–2011)\nThe band's second album, Never Rest In Peace, was released on October 20, 2009, by Alternative Tentacles. A music video for the song \"3000 Miles Away\" featuring actor Ethan Suplee was filmed in November 2009 and premiered by Punknews.org in January 2010. During this time, the band was featured in Tao Lin's 2009 novella, Shoplifting from American Apparel, in which they performed a midnight set at \"The Kickstand\" at The Fest 7 in Gainesville, Florida.\nFrom the Dumpster to the Grave (2011–present)\nTheir band's third album was originally to be titled \"Ska Fucking Hipsters\", but was later retitled \"From the Dumpster to the Grave\". For the recording of the album Mikey Erg, formerly of The Ergs!, joined the band, replacing P.Nut as drummer. It was revealed that folk punk/anarcho-punk band Blackbird Raum and Boots Riley of political hip hop group The Coup would be contributing to the new album, amongst others.\nOn March 27, 2011, the band announced via Facebook that Nico was leaving the band, saying: \"We're sad to announce the departure of Nico de Gallo from our line-up after over three years of happy fun tymes! She will be missed by all. Starting on Tuesday, Kelsy from the Oakland super-group Chump-Change will be assuming co-lead vocals with myself, your humble newscaster, Sturgil Crizil.\" Though she had departed and was quickly replaced, Nico had already recorded all of her vocals for the band's third album.\nIt was also announced on April 5, 2011, via Facebook that the band had plans to release a split 7-inch with hardcore punk/thrash band Jesus Fucking Christ through Inimical Records. SFH contributed three songs to the split, including a cover of Rudimentary Peni's \"Media Person\".\nFrom the Dumpster to the Grave was released on October 11, 2011, on Fat Wreck Chords. The subsequent record release party was the band's last show of the year. The long-awaited split 7-inch with Jesus Fucking Christ, known as \"The Fucking Split\" was released on June 26, 2012. They were also confirmed to play the Rebellion festival in 2012 alongside The Choking Victim Show – a band featuring Stza and members of Irish ska-punk band Chewing on Tinfoil playing Choking Victim songs.\nBand members\n*Stza – vocals, guitar (2005–2013)\n*Frank Piegaro – guitar (2006–2013)\n*Chris Pothier – bass (2009–2013)\n*Mikey Erg – drums (2011–2013)\n*Kelsey \"Kill-C\" – vocals (2011–2013)\n*Brandon Chevalier-Kolling – drums (2005)\n*Kisston – vocals (2005)\n*Jamie Toulon – guitar (2005)\n*GiGi – drums (2005)\n*Ara Babajian – drums (2006–2008)\n*Nico de Gaillo – vocals (2006–2011)\n*Yula Beeri – bass (2006–2009)\n*Alex Charpentier – drums (2008–2009)\n*Brian \"Pnut\" Kozuch – drums (2009–2011)\nDiscography\n* ''Until We're Dead – (2008)\n* Never Rest in Peace – (2009)\n* From the Dumpster to the Grave – (2011)\n* The Fucking Split'' (split with Jesus Fucking Christ) – (2012)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120619204505/http://www.punk76.com/Interview_Star_Fucking_Hipsters.php Interview with STZA on Punk76.com]\n* [http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/an-interview-with-stza-crack-of-leftover-crack-and-sfh/ Interview with STZA at Thought Catalog]"
