      "text": "# Free Knowledge Award\n\nFree Knowledge Award was an award presented by Wikimedia RU, a Russian nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting encyclopedic knowledge. The prize was awarded to individuals or organizations who are not active participants in Wikimedia Foundation projects, but who have made a notable contribution to the goals of the Wikimedia movement: the dissemination of free knowledge. It has been awarded annually since 2014.\nThe Free Knowledge Award winners were determined in two stages. First, the wiki community nominated candidates and voted, which resulted in a short list. From this list, Wikimedia RU members selected 3-4 winners, taking into account the arguments presented. The winners were announced directly at the ceremony.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE\" |№\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE\" |Years\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE\" |Winners\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |1\n|2014\n|Ivan Zassoursky   Internet Users Association  Ushinsky State Pedagogical Library  Association of Honorary Citizens, Mentors and Talented Youth\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |2\n|2015\n|CyberLeninka   Homeland heroes  Business Journal\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |3\n|2016\n|Oral History (foundation)  National Electronic Library   Yuri Metelkin\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |4\n|2017\n|Old Books Project  Клопс.Ru   Andrei Galinichev and Dmitry Poslavsky\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |5\n|2018\n|Digital Herbarium of Moscow University     Russian OpenStreetMap community   Kirill Vasiliev\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |6\n|2019\n|Free webinars \"Direct-Academy\" platform  Aleksey Ryabinin  Nekrasov Central Library\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |7\n|2020\n|News agency Bashinform  Youth movement Selet  Leonid Shafirov\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |8\n|2021\n|Vadim Riabitsev and Nina Sadykova  Alexei Sidelnikov and Mikhail Trenikhin  Dmitry Lyovochkin  Atlas of New Professions project team\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |9\n|2022\n|Olesya Nosova   Anatoly Gulyaev and Evgeny Raevsky  Andrei Kuznetsov\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |\n|2023\n|It was not conducted\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
