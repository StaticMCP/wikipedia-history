The style became popular in the 1740s (the first known example being a 1742 letter by Horace Walpole) and spread to British North America, ending in popularity in the first half of the 19th century.\nList\n*The Chronicles of the Kings of England (1744) is a book on English history written by Robert Dodsley under the pen name \"Nathan Ben Saddi\".\n*A Parable Against Persecution (1755) is a hoax text composed by Benjamin Franklin.\n* The American Revolution: written in scriptural, or, ancient historical style (1796) is an account of the American Revolution written by Richard Snowden (1753–1825).\n* The First Book of Napoleon (1809) is a history of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Napoleonic Wars written under the pen name \"Eliakim the Scribe\".\n* The Late War between the United States and Great Britain (1816)  is an educational text covering the War of 1812 written by Gilbert J.
