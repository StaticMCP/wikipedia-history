So, overall 18 clubs were interested to play in 1958–59 Montenegrin Republic League.

Below are the final tables of each qualifying group.\nChampionship\nAt the finals, every team played four games and the winner went to qualifiers for Yugoslav Second League.\nTitle holder was Mladost Titograd, who finished season with three wins and one draw. Rudar was excluded from the championship, due to fact that in their team participated unregistered players. Because of that, three games of Rudar were registered with result 0-3.\nQualifiers for Yugoslav Second League\nIn the qualifiers for 1959–60 Second League – East, Mladost finished as a last-placed team in the group with Pobeda Prilep, Sloboda Titovo Užice and Priština.
