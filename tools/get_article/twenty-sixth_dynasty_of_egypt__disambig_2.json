The dynasty's reign (664–525 BC) is also called the Saite Period after the city of Sais, where its pharaohs had their capital, and marks the beginning of the Late Period of ancient Egypt.\nHistory\nThis dynasty traced its origins to the Twenty-fourth Dynasty. Psamtik I was probably a descendant of Bakenranef. However, other sources describe him as of Libyan descent.\nFollowing the Neo-Assyrian conquest of Egypt during the reigns of Taharqa and Tantamani, and the subsequent collapse of the Napata-based Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, Psamtik I was recognized as sole king over all of Egypt. Psamtik formed alliances with King Gyges of Lydia, who sent him mercenaries from Caria and ancient Greece that Psamtik used to unify all of Egypt under his rule.\nof Dynasty XXVI fought the Neo-Babylonian Empire at the Battle of Carchemish, helped by the remnants of the military of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, but this was met with defeat. Illustration published in 1915.]]\nWith the sack of Nineveh in 612 BC and the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, both Psamtik and his successors attempted to reassert Egyptian power in the Near East but were driven back by the Neo-Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar II. With the help of Greek mercenaries, Pharaoh Apries was able to hold back Babylonian attempts to conquer Egypt.\nThe Persians would eventually invade Egypt in 525 BCE when Emperor Cambyses II captured and later executed Psamtik III in the First Achaemenid conquest of Egypt. Cambyses founded the First Egyptian Satrapy, a territory of the Achaemenid Empire, and was crowned the first pharaoh of the Dynasty XXVII.\nArchaeology\nIn May 2020, an Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission headed by Esther Ponce revealed a unique cemetery, which consists of one room built with glazed limestone dating back to the 26th Dynasty (also known as the El-Sawi era) at the site of ancient Oxyrhynchus. Archaeologists also uncovered bronze coins, clay seals, Roman tombstones and small crosses. On October 3, 2020, Egypt unveiled 59 coffins of priests and clerks from the 26th dynasty, dating to nearly 2,500 years ago.\nArt\nFile:Pottery vessel. Applique face of god Bes on surface.

Manetho begins the dynasty with:\n* Ammeris the Nubian (= ? Ammeris), 12 (or 18) years\n* Stephinates (= ? Tefnakht II), 7 years\n* Nechepsos (= ? Nekauba), 6 years\n* Necho (= ? Necho I), 8 years.\nWhen the Nubian King Shabaka defeated Bakenranef, son of Tefnakht, he likely installed a Nubian commander as governor at Sais. This may be the man named Ammeris. Stephinates may be a descendant of Bakenrenef. He is sometimes referred to as Tefnakht II in the literature. Nechepsos has been identified with a local king named Nekauba (678–672 BC). Manetho's Necho is King Necho I (672–664 BC); Manetho gives his reign as 8 years. Necho was killed during a conflict with the Nubian king Tantamani. Psamtik&nbsp;I fled to Nineveh – capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire – and returned to Egypt when Ashurbanipal defeated Tantamani and drove him back south. Scholars now start the 26th Dynasty with the reign of Psamtik I.\nSextus Julius Africanus states in his often accurate version of Manetho's Epitome that the dynasty numbered nine pharaohs, beginning with a \"Stephinates\" (Tefnakht II) and ending with Psamtik III. Africanus also notes that Psamtik I and Necho I ruled for 54 and 8 years respectively.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dynasty XXVI Kings of Egypt\n! style=\"width:130px\" |Pharaoh\n!Image!! style=\"width:150px\" |Prenomen (Throne name) !! style=\"width:120px\" |Horus-name !! style=\"width:120px\" |Reign !! style=\"width:60px\" |Burial !! style=\"width:200px\" |Consort(s)\n!Comments\n|-\n|Psamtik IPsammetichus I\n||| Wahibre || Aaib || 664–610 BC ||Sais || Mehytenweskhet || Reunified Egypt and ended the Nubian control of Upper Egypt.
