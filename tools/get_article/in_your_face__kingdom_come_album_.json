This is the band's final album to be recorded with the original lineup of vocalist Lenny Wolf, lead guitarist Danny Stag, rhythm guitarist Rick Steier, bassist Johnny B. Frank and drummer James Kottak.\nOverview\nTwo singles were released in support of the album, both becoming minor hits in the UK: \"Do You Like It\" (no. 73) and \"Overrated\" (no. 85). The band was due to tour the UK, supporting W.A.S.P., shortly after release of the second single, but split up before the tour commenced (ironically W.A.S.P. also lost guitarist and co-founder Chris Holmes at the same time, meaning they also had to cancel the tour). A third single \"Stargazer\" was pressed, but never officially released. The 12\" and CD single versions of \"Do You Like It\", includes the previously unreleased \"Slow Down\"; a song that did not make it onto the album.\nAlbum title meaning\nIn an interview, the band's members talk about the title of the album, saying that when you first look at the LP, you read \"Kingdom Come\", then, as you move your eyes downwards, you read \"In your face\". They laugh and say: \"Kingdom come ... in your face, get it?\", making an obscene joke or double entendre of it.\nTrack listing\n| writer6 = Frank, Steier, Wolf\n| length6 = 3:46\n| title7 = Just Like a Wild Rose\n| writer7 = Wolf, Wolff\n| length7 = 4:32\n| title8 = Overrated\n| writer8 = Frank, Steier, Wolf\n| length8 = 4:03\n| title9 = Mean Dirty Joe\n| writer9 = Wolf, Wolff\n| length9 = 4:09\n| title10 = Stargazer\n| writer10 = Wolf, Steier, Stag, Frank\n| length10 = 5:14\n}}\nPersonnel\n;Kingdom Come\n*Lenny Wolf – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, producer\n*Danny Stag – lead guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals\n*Rick Steier – rhythm guitar, lead guitar on \"Overrated\", keyboards, backing vocals\n*Johnny B.
