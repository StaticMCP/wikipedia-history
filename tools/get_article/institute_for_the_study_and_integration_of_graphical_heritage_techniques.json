INSIGHT's principal work consists of archaeological documentation projects for academics, universities and non-governmental organizations.  INSIGHT's work has been included in documentary films, including Sunken Treasures of the Nile, Queens of the Nile and Ramses II, the Great Journey.\nINSIGHT began in 1998 as the Egyptian Cultural Heritage Operation (ECHO), with the support of the Center for Design Visualization at the University of California at Berkeley.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
