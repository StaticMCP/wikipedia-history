The blade colours are maroon, yellow and black; kit: black and black.\nHistory\nA Shiplake Vikings club existed in during the 1960s, with crews gaining significant success at the 1963 Henley Town Regatta.\nThe current club is believed to have been re-formed during the 1980s, following discussions at the Baskerville Arms which resulted in permission from Shiplake College to use their boathouse facilities. New boathouse plans for the College have been passed and construction started in 2019.\nIn recent years the club has produced some national champions.\nHonours\nNational champions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=70|Year\n!width=400|Winning crew/s\n|-\n| 2014 || Open J15 2x\n|-\n| 2015 || Women J18 4-\n|-\n| 2016 || Women J18 4-\n|}\nReferences"
