Some regions also have Sesquicentennial Farm (150 years) and Bicentennial Farm (200 years) programs.\nIn most states and provinces, the essential requirement for the award is that the property must have remained in the same family continuously for 100 years or more and currently be a working farm or ranch. Some states stipulate a minimum number of acres or annual agricultural sales.\nBackground\nCanada\nIn Canada, Century Farm recognition in the province of Ontario was initiated as a Canadian Centennial project of the Junior Farmers' Association of Ontario  (JFAO) in 1967.  In Alberta the Alberta Century Farm & Ranch Award is administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and similar programs are run by individual counties and municipalities.\nUnited States\nIn the United States, one of the first organizations to begin officially recognizing the farms was the New York State Agricultural Society in 1937. Several states began their programs during the United States Bicentennial in 1976.  Recognition from state to state varies.  It is usually handled by the state's agriculture or natural resources department in conjunction with the American Farm Bureau Federation and the Cooperative extension service of the United States Department of Agriculture, or the state's historical society. In other states, civic groups such as the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben perform the function.  The awards are frequently done at the state fair.\nThe award typically defines a farm as  or more and consists of a plaque and a sign as well as formal listing.\nIn Oregon, in addition to century farms and ranches, the Department of Agriculture began to recognize sesquicentennial farms and ranches in 2008.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!State!!Program!!Founded!!Min. acres!!Oversight!!Notes\n|-\n| Alabama\n| Century and Heritage Farm Program\n| 1976\n| 40\n| Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries\n|\n|-\n| Arkansas\n| Arkansas Century Farm Program\n| 2012\n| 10\n| Arkansas Agriculture Department\n|\n|-\n|California\n|CACenturyFarms\n|2018\n|N/A\n|Private entity\n|\n|-\n|Colorado\n|Centennial Farms\n| 1986\n| 160\n| History Colorado\n|\n|-\n| Connecticut\n| Century Farm Award\n| 2011\n|\n|Connecticut Agricultural Information Council\n|\n|-\n|Delaware\n|Century Farm Program\n|1987\n|10\n|Delaware Department of Agriculture\n|\n|-\n| Florida\n| Century Pioneer Family Farm Program\n| 1985\n|\n| Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services\n| To qualify, a farm must be owned by a family for at least 100 continuous years.\n|-\n| Georgia\n| Centennial Farms\n| 1993\n| 10\n| Historic Preservation Division, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, in cooperation with the Georgia Farm Bureau Federation; the Georgia Department of Agriculture; the University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences; the Georgia Forestry Commission; and the Georgia National Fairgrounds and Agricenter\n|\n|-\n| Idaho\n| Century Farm and Ranch Program\n| 1972\n| 40\n| Idaho State Historical Society\n|\n|-\n| Illinois\n| Centennial and Sesquicentennial Farms\n| 1972\n|\n| Illinois Department of Agriculture\n|\n|-\n| Indiana\n| Hoosier Homestead Award Program\n| 1976\n| 20\n| Indiana State Department of Agriculture\n|\n|-\n| Iowa\n| Century Farms\n| 1976\n|\n| Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship\n|\n|-\n| Kansas\n| Century Farms\n| 2000\n| 80\n| Kansas Farm Bureau\n|\n|-\n| Kentucky\n| Historic Farms Program\n| 1992\n|\n| Kentucky Heritage Council and the Kentucky Department of Agriculture\n|\n|-\n| Louisiana\n| Louisiana Century Farm Program\n|\n| 20\n| Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation, and Louisiana Land Bank\n|\n|-\n| Maryland\n| Century Farm Award\n|\n| 10\n| Maryland Department of Agriculture\n|\n|-\n| Massachusetts\n| Massachusetts Century Farms\n|\n|\n| Massachusetts Farm Bureau Federation\n| To qualify, a farm must have been in the same family for 100 years or more and is currently being farmed.\n|-\n| Michigan\n| Centennial Farms\n| 1948\n| 10\n| Historical Society of Michigan\n|\n|-\n| Minnesota\n| Century and Sesquicentennial Farms\n| 1976\n|\n| Minnesota Farm Bureau\n|\n|-\n| Mississippi\n| Centennial Farm Program\n|\n|\n| Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce\n|\n|-\n| Missouri\n| Century Farm Program\n| 1976\n| 40\n| University of Missouri Extension\n|\n|-\n| Montana\n| Centennial Farm and Ranch Program\n| 2009\n|\n| Montana Historical Society\n|\n|-\n| Nebraska\n| Pioneer Farm Family Awards\n| 1961 (approx.)\n|\n| Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben Foundation, Nebraska Farm Bureau\n|\n|-\n| Nevada\n| Centennial Ranch and Farm Awards Program\n| 2004\n| 160\n| Agricultural Council of Nevada, Nevada Agricultural Foundation, Cattlemen's Association, Nevada Farm Bureau, Heritage Foundation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service\n|\n|-\n| New Hampshire\n| Century Farm Book\n| 2016\n|\n| New Hampshire Farm Bureau Federation\n|\n|-\n| New Jersey\n| Century Farm Award\n|\n|\n| New Jersey Agricultural Society\n| To qualify, a farm must have been in the same family and been operational for at least 100 years.\n|-\n| New York\n| Century Farm Award\n| 1937\n|\n| New York State Agricultural Society\n|\n|-\n| North Carolina\n| Century Farm Family Program\n| 1970\n|\n| North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services\n|\n|-\n| North Dakota\n| Centennial Farms\n| 1988\n|\n| Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation\n|\n|-\n| Ohio\n| [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHistoric_family_farms_of_Licking_County%2C_Ohio#Content_added Century Farms]\n| 1993\n|\n| Ohio Department of Agriculture\n| Also has a Bicentennial Farm program.
