However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\n;First Air Force\n* Godman AAF, Fort Knox\n: Support for Fort Knox\n: 99th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Godman Air Force Base (1947-1954)\n: Now: active United States Army Airfield\n* Campbell AAF, Fort Campbell/Hopkinsville\n: Sub-base of Smyrna AAF, Tennessee\n: 99th Army Air Force Base Unit (DET)\n: Was: Campbell Air Force Base (1947-1959)\n: Now: active United States Army Airfield\n;Air Technical Service Command\n* Louisville MAP, Louisville\n: Aircraft Modification Center\n: Now: Louisville International Airport and Louisville Air National Guard Base\n;Troop Carrier Command\n* Bowman Field AAF, Louisville\n: AAF Convalescent Hospital\n: 27th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Bowman Field Airport\n:* Lexington/Bluegrass AAF, Lexington\n:: Auxiliary to Bowman AAF\n:: Now: Blue Grass Airport\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
