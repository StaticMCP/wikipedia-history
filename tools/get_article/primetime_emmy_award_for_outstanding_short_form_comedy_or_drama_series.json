The category was initiated in 2016 alongside Outstanding Short Form Variety Series and Outstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series. The awards replaced the now-retired category for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program. In 2021, this award will be merged Short Form Variety Series to form the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Comedy, Drama or Variety Series. These awards were not presented at the Primetime Emmy Awards show, but at the Creative Arts Emmy Award show.\nWinners and nominations\n2010s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n!
