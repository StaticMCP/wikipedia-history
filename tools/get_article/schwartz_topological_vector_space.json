These spaces were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck.\nDefinition\nA Hausdorff locally convex space  with continuous dual X^{\\prime},  is called a Schwartz space if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:\n#For every closed convex balanced neighborhood  of the origin in , there exists a neighborhood  of  in  such that for all real ,  can be covered by finitely many translates of .\n#Every bounded subset of  is totally bounded and for every closed convex balanced neighborhood  of the origin in , there exists a neighborhood  of  in  such that for all real , there exists a bounded subset  of  such that .\nProperties\nEvery quasi-complete Schwartz space is a semi-Montel space.\nEvery Fréchet Schwartz space is a Montel space.\nThe strong dual space of a complete Schwartz space is an ultrabornological space.\nExamples and sufficient conditions\n* Vector subspace of Schwartz spaces are Schwartz spaces.\n* The quotient of a Schwartz space by a closed vector subspace is again a Schwartz space.\n* The Cartesian product of any family of Schwartz spaces is again a Schwartz space.\n* The weak topology induced on a vector space by a family of linear maps valued in Schwartz spaces is a Schwartz space if the weak topology is Hausdorff.\n* The locally convex strict inductive limit of any countable sequence of Schwartz spaces (with each space TVS-embedded in the next space) is again a Schwartz space.\nCounter-examples\nEvery infinite-dimensional normed space is not a Schwartz space.\nThere exist Fréchet spaces that are not Schwartz spaces and there exist Schwartz spaces that are not Montel spaces.\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
