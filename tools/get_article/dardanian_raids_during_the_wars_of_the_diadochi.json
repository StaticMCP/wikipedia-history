The northern frontier garrisons were weakened or withdrawn, creating a power vacuum that the Dardani exploited.\nThe raids\nDardanian war bands, composed primarily of light infantry and cavalry, crossed the border and ravaged the poorly defended regions of Upper Macedonia and parts of northern Thessaly. According to ancient sources, they avoided pitched battles and focused on plunder and rapid withdrawal, a tactic typical of Illyrian frontier warfare.\nThe raids are mentioned only briefly in surviving sources, but modern scholarship regards them as evidence of Dardania's temporary resurgence during the collapse of centralized Macedonian authority.\nAftermath\nThe restoration of order under Antigonus II Gonatas after 279 BC ended the large-scale Dardanian incursions. The subsequent Gallic invasion of 279 BC shifted regional attention southward, and the Dardani themselves played a role in ambushing retreating Celtic forces later that year.\nReferences"
