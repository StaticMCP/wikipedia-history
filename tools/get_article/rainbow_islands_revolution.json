It is an update of the original game, Rainbow Islands. Unlike in the original, the main character, Bub, rides in a bubble, and the player has to guide him with the stylus, and draw rainbows with it as well. The game uses mainly the DS's touch screen.\nGameplay\nThe player has to drag Bub around using the stylus. Contact with enemies or dangerous objects such as spikes causes the player to lose a heart. When all hearts have been lost, the player loses a life and must begin the level anew.\nWhen the player drags the stylus anywhere on the screen that isn't Bub, the player can create a rainbow. The rainbow serves as a barrier through which enemies can't cross. If the rainbow is drawn over an enemy, the enemy is killed. Additionally, when the player taps a rainbow, it falls down removing any enemies that lie below.\nThe player can also draw some special shapes which create rainbows with special effects.\nReception\n| 4P = 63%\n| EuroG = 6/10\n| Fam = 26/40\n| GSpot = 6.2/10\n| GameZone = 5/10\n| IGN = 5/10\n| NGC = 68%\n| NP = 4.5/10\n| PG =\n| Retro = 51%\n}}\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
