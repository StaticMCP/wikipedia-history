Each minigame lasts between just three seconds to around two minutes in length.\nThe game features online leaderboards for high scores for two of the minigames.\nDevelopment\nA prototype for 3-2-1, Rattle Battle!, then titled Playshake, was demonstrated at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show. The prototype featured minimal graphics and only a single minigame in which the player had to shake the Wii Remote as many times as they can in three seconds.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
