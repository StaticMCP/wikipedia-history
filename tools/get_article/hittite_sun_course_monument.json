In 1973, the symbol of the city was made by Mayor Vedat Dalokay. Examples of the Hittite Sun Disc from the tombs of the Hatti kings can be seen in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations. The Hittite Sun Disc Monument was presented to the people of Ankara by the Anatolian Insurance Co. in 1977. The symbol of Ankara University is the Sun Disc.
