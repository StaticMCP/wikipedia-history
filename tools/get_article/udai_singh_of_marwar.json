He was also the maternal grandfather of Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal Emperor, and an ancestor of all subsequent emperors.\nEarly life\nUdai Singh was the son of Maldeo Rathore, Raja of Marwar and Rani Swarup Deviji. He was also elder and only full-brother of Chandrasen, successor of Maldeo.\nWhen Rao Maldeo nominated his younger brother, Chandrasen to the throne, Udai Singh raised some turmoil. In order to pacify him, his mother had Maldeo to give him Phalodi.\nWar of succession\nOn the death of Rao Maldeo, his younger brother Chandrasen ascended the throne of Marwar.\nAlthough Marwar did not follow the law of Primogeniture, rarely had the right of the elder son been set aside. Thus the fratricidal war of succession when ensured.\nOn the instigation of the Chiefs and Nobles of Chandrasen, Udai Singh revolted at Gagani. At the same time Ramchandra and Raimal also revolted at Sajot and Dunda respectively. However both fled away rather than facing Chandrasen's army. But Udai Singh fought Chandrasen's army and was defeated in Lohawat in December 1562. In this battle, both sides suffered great loses in men and material. Udai Singh had given a blow with an axe to Chandrasen and he also received a blow from Rawal Megh Raj. His life was saved by Hade Khichi who had him remove from the battlefield on his horse.\nThese war unfortunately weakened the Rathore principality when Akbar was forming friendly alliance with other Rajput Chieftains. Thus Marwar soon fell under Mughal Forces. Chandrasen had no allies and all of his brothers and fellow rajput chieftains (apart from Mewar) stood against him. Chandrasen was left completely isolated in the war with the Mughal empire. Akbar's army occupied Merta in the same year and the capital in 1564.\nUnder Imperial Service\nIn November 1570, Udai Singh had come from Phalodi to attend the Mughal Court in Nagore. This court was also attended by Chandrasen. It seems as though both Udai Singh and Chandrasen came with the intention of getting Jodhpur back. But Chandrasen left the court soon after his arrival. In this court, Udai Singh was granted a mansab of 800 along with Samavalli and joined the services of the Mughal. Thereafter, he got an opportunity to prove his worth as a warrior and commander in expeditions against Gujars of Samavalli and Raja Madhukar Bundela.\nIn 1574, Udai Singh lost Phalodi when Akbar granted it to Bhakharsi, son of Rawal Harraj.\nAfter Chandrasens's death in 1581, the Marwar kingdom was broken and given to several Rajput chieftains who had helped Mughals against Chandrasen. The Raja of Bikaner was made the governor of Marwar, while the sons of Maldeo were cast aside.\nReign\n]]\nIn August 1583, Akbar granted the sinhasan of Jodhpur to Udai Singh.\nSoon he was sent in expedition against Muzaffer Khan of Gujarat and Gujarat was annexed to Mughal Empire. Thereafter forces led by Udai Singh and others proceeded to subdue the rebellious vassal Daulat Khan Lodi. He was sent in various expedition against rulers of Rajasthan and rebel Mughal chieftains. Udai Singh, with the help of Mughal Emperor, had finally succeeded to achieve his two decade old ambition of recovering the land of his ancestors.\nUdai Singh decided to give his daughter Mani bai, popularly known as Jodh bai, born to his principal queen Manrang devi, to the heir-apparent of Mughal Empire, Prince Salim. The marriage got solemnised at the bride's residence. After this marriage, Akbar granted the mansab of 1000 and conferred the title 'Raja' upon him. This marriage served very well cause for the house of Marwar. Marwar alliance with Mughal would have broken down due to religious strain estrangement had Jahangir and Shah Jahan not been bound by blood ties. After this marriage Udai Singh and brothers and nephews of Jodh bai succeeded in gaining confidence of their contemporary rules and were recipient of Royal favours.\nKalyandas Rathore\nHistorian Norman P. Ziegler relates two accounts of the death of Kalyandas Rathore, his nephew. The version from the Rathore genealogy says Kalyandas took offence at Udai Singh giving his daughter, Jagat Gosain, to Jahangir in marriage, and threatened to kill both men. According to Ziegler, if this is true, the most likely explanation for Kalyandas' opposition is that the marriage implied a subservience that violated the Rajput code of honor. In this version of events, when news of Kalyandas's threats reached Akbar, the emperor ordered Udai Singh to kill Kalyandas. Whatever the cause of the break between Kalyandas and the Mughals, he fled to fort Siwana. Udai Singh pursued him and captured the fort in 1589. Kalyandas died in the fighting.\nAccording to Murārdān, Kalyan Das Rathore took offence at this marriage and was angry at Mota Raja and had remarked –\nWhen the Mota Raja heard to this remark, he informed Akbar who ordered him to kill Kalyan Das. Kalyan Das fled the Imperial Camp to Siwana. Udai Singh sent two of his sons, Bhopat and Jaisingh to Siwana. But the fort and opponent proved too strong for them and they were forced to flee back. On the face of this defeat, Mota Raja received permission from Akbar to leave the imperial camp. After his return to Marwar, he led a force against Siwana himself. Kalyan Das, realizing defeat is imminent, had his wives perform jauhar and himself led his men to die fighting. After this victory, Siwana was handed over to Mota Raja.\nCulture\nDuring Udai Singh's reign, respite art and architecture developed in Marwar. The country which had been desolated before the Raja was beginning to grow rapidly.\nA part of the fort in Jodhpur was also constructed by the Raja. He also introduced administrative reforms in Marwar on Mughal pattern. He also started the Mughal practice of Peshkash. The system of Dah-Chauki also came in vouge in Marwar during the reign of the Raja.\nHe also built the Dewal of Rao Maldeo, his father. This was the first of the Royal cenotaphs built at Mandore.\nLater life and death\nBy the end of 1592, he was appointed by Akbar to manage the affairs at Lahore. In 1593, he was again sent to subdue Rao Surtan. After his conquest in Siwana, Udai Singh returned to Lahore on 15 December 1594.\nHe died of heart attack in Lahore, Punjab, on 10 July 1595.\nHis son Sur Singh, by his principal wife Manrang Devi, succeeded him to the throne. His youngest son by Manrang Devi, named Kishan Singh, later founded Kishangarh.\nDescendants\nThrough his several children, Udai Singh is the common ancestor of several families in northern India.
