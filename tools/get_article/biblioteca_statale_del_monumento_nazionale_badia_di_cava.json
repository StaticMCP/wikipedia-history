The library lost much of its original collection during the 15th century. However, later abbots protected the integrity of the library, going as far as obtaining in 1595 a papal bull from Pope Clement VIII banning the extraction of books from the library. A further loss however occurred during a rock fall occurring on Christmas' eve in 1796. After the 19th-century suppression of the monasteries, the abbey had some degree of protection since monks were employed as custodians of the abbey.\nThe library contains 15,000 parchment pages including 65 codeses; 430 manuscript volumes; 25,000 loose manuscript documents; 120 incunabolae; 1,663 16th century books; 77,500 printed books; and 197 journals, of which 86 are current.\nAmong the treasures of the collection are a 9th-century Visigothic Bible (La Cava Bible), the 9th-century Codex legum Langobardorum (a compendium of the Ancient Germanic law of the Lombards; the 8th-century Etymologiae by Isidore of Seville, an 11th-century De Temporibus by Bede, and a 12th-century De septem sigillis by Benedetto da Bari.\nReferences"
