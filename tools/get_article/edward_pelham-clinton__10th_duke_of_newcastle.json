He was thus briefly a member of the House of Lords.\nEducation and career\nPelham-Clinton was the son of Guy Edward Pelham-Clinton, an army officer and a grandson of Lord Charles Clinton, who was a younger son of Henry Pelham-Clinton, 4th Duke of Newcastle. He was educated at Eton, and Trinity College, Oxford, and during the Second World War served as an officer in the Royal Artillery, rising to the rank of captain and being mentioned in dispatches. His younger brother, Alastair Pelham-Clinton, was a Royal Air Force Flying Officer and died in 1943 aged twenty.\nPelham-Clinton was interested in lepidopterology from a young age and  specialized in entomology at Cambridge. An expert in the subject, from 1960 to 1980 he was Deputy Keeper of the Royal Scottish Museum, in Edinburgh. He acted as an associate editor of six volumes of the series The Moths and Butterflies of Great Britain and Ireland, in which he wrote articles about Tineidae, Choreutidae, and Glyphipterigidae, and was working on Elachistidae at the time of his death. A building in Dinton Pastures Country Park was named after him by the British Entomological and Natural History Society, of which he had been a member.\nSuccession to peerages\nPelham-Clinton succeeded a third cousin in the earldom and dukedom in November 1988. He died one month and 21 days later, aged 68, unmarried. As all other heirs male from the second duke's line had died, the dukedom became extinct, but the peerage of Earl of Lincoln was inherited by Edward Fiennes-Clinton, a distant kinsman in Australia. He left an estate valued for probate at £2,222,203, , and his stated usual abode was Furzeleigh House, Axminster.\nCoat of arms\n|image size =\n|notes =\n|coronet = A coronet of an Duke\n|crest =  1st, out of a ducal coronet gules, a plume of five ostrich feathers argent, banded azure ; 2nd, a peacock in pride proper.\n|escutcheon =  Quarterly: 1st and 4th argent, six cross crosslets, three, two and one, sable, on a chief azure two mullets pierced gules (Clinton); 2nd and 3rd, quarterly, 1st and 4th azure, three pelicans vulning themselves argent; and 2nd and 3rd gules, two pieces of belts with buckles erect in pale, the buckles upwards argent (Pelham).\n|supporters =Two greyhounds argent collared and lined gules.\n|motto = Loyaulté n'a honte Loyalty knows not shame}}\nReferences"
