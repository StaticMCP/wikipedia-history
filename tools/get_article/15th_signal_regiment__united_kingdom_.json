The unit provided communications for the island of Cyprus but was disbanded shortly after 1963. In 1992, following the Options for Change reforms, it was reformed to support HQ Northern Ireland and other units deployed during Operation Banner.\nWorld War Period\nInter-war\nBefore World War II, the Egypt Signals unit was formed. It was tasked with providing communications and signals support for British Army units based in Egypt. Their area of responsibility was not limited to Egypt itself, but included the following areas: Mandatory Palestine, Sudan, and Cyprus. During this time, the unit was collectively known as Egypt Command Signals.Lord and Watson page 54\nWorld War II\nIn 1940, the regiment was based in Cairo. Following Italy's entry in the war, the regiment's support ranged from providing signals and communications for units in Cyprus, Greece, Macedonia, the Balkans, and Eastern Africa.\nCyprus\nFollowing the end of World War Two, the regiment was re-titled in 1946 as the 3rd General Headquarters Signal Regiment. In 1959, Middle East Command was dissolved and split into two new formations, namely, British Forces Suez Canal and British Forces Arabian Peninsula. As a result, the regiment was renamed as 15th (Cyprus) Signal Regiment to better represent their new role.\nCold War\nOn 15 January 1965, the regiment was reformed in Aden. After this reform, the regiment was re-titled as 15th Signal Regiment.\nPost-Cold War\nThe regiment was reformed for the third time at Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn, Northern Ireland in 1990 and was re-titled as 15th Signal Regiment.\nAfter the Options for Change reforms, the Regiment gained command of more signal squadrons. After the end of Operation Banner in Northern Ireland, the Regiment was disbanded.\nOn 30 September 2011, the Unified Systems Support Organisation (USSO), based in Blandford Forum in Dorset, was renamed as the 15th Signal Regiment (Information Support), or abbreviated as 15 Sig Regt (IS), and so resurrecting for the fifth time the name of the Regiment.  Responsible for providing level 3 and 4 specialist support to all MoD units in Information Communication Services (ICS) and Communication Information Systems (CIS).\nAccording to a FOI Response, the Regiment will fall under the command of 11th Signal Brigade and Headquarters West Midlands.  By 2019 the Regimental HQ will move from its current location at Blandford Camp to Swinton Barracks in Perham Down, thereby co-locating with the remainder of the regular units of 7th Signal Group. The remainder of the old Squadrons will reform as 13 Sig Regt, and remain based under a new Regimental HQ at Blandford Camp.\nThe Regiment under this reform is to re-organise and become a close support signals unit. The Regiment will support the 12th Armoured Infantry Brigade by 2020.\nIn 2019, the 15 Sig Regt HQ moved from Blandford Camp to Swinton Barracks in Perham Down.\nStructure\nThe regiment's current structure in April 2025 is as follows:\n* 15th Signal Regiment, at Swinton Barracks, Perham Down\n** Regimental Headquarters\n** 207 (Armoured) Signal Squadron\n** 243 (Gurkha) Signal Squadron\n** Support Squadron\nReferences\nSources\n* Lord, Cliff, and Graham Watson.
