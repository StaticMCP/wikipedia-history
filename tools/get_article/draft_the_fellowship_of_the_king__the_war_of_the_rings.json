It is an unauthorized entry in the Lord of the Rings franchise, created as \"pitch-perfect\" follow up to The Return of the King (1955).\nIn April 2023, the novel gained notoriety after Polychron attempted to sue both the Tolkien Estate and Amazon, claiming that the live-action series Rings of Power had plagiarized from his work. At the same time, the Tolkien Estate sued Polychron for the unauthorized publication of the work for profit. In December 2023, both the Tolkien Estate and Amazon won the suits, with all physical and digital copies of the book ordered to be destroyed, as well as an injunction being put in place to prevent further entries from being published. Despite this, Polychron would publish The Two Trees: The War of the Rings in 2024. Reception for The War of the Rings was overwhelmingly negative, with criticism towards the bland writing style and many textual errors."
