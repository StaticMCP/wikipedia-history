      "text": "# Swedish Dance Music Awards\n\nSwedish Dance Music Awards (also known as Gilbey's Swedish Dance Music Awards and ZTV Dance Music Awards) was a Swedish dance music award that started in 1990 by John Wallin (Pitch Control) and Jonas Siljemark (Siljemark Production). At that time Swedish dance artists had no national media exposure compared to the massive coverage they were receiving internationally. Wallin and Siljemark felt that the home market of such successful artists didn't give the respect the artists deserved. That is how they came up with the idea of the Swedish Dance Music Awards. It was broadcast live on television and radio and got much media coverage.\nSwedish Dance Music Awards 1991 (as Swedish Discjockey Music Awards)\n; Best Female Artist\n* Titiyo (winner)\n; Best Male Artist\n* Papa Dee (winner)\n; Best Breakthrough Artist\n* Dr. Alban (winner)\n; Best Swedish Group\n* Stonefunkers (winner)\n; Best Producer\n* Magnus Frykberg (winner)\n; Best Live Act\n* Stonefunkers (winner)\n; Best Album\n* Titiyo - Titiyo (winner)\n; Best Dance Album\n* Dr. Alban - Hello Africa The Album (winner)\n; Best Hip Hop Album\n* Papa Dee - ''Lettin' Off Steam'' (winner)\n; Best Twelve Inch\n* Just D - Vi har vår egen påse (winner)\n;Best House Twelve Inc\n* Clubland - Let's Get Busy (winner)\n; Best Remix\n* Chrille Falk/Stonebridge (winner)\n; Best Record Company\n* Swemix (winner)\n; Best DJ\n* Björn Stavfeldt (winner)\n; Best Radio DJ\n* Clabbe af Gejerstam (winner)\n; Best Nightclub\n* Ritz (winner)\n; Performances:\n* Dr. Alban\n* Papa Dee\n* Snap!\n* Stonefunkers\nSwedish Dance Music Awards 1992\n;Best Male Artist/Crossover\n* Tomas Ledin (winner)\n; Best Female Artist/Crossover\n* Eva Dahlgren (winner)\n; Best Dance Album\n* Army Of Lovers - Massive Luxury Overdose (winner)\n; Best Remix\n* Johan Ekelund (winner)\n; Best Producer\n* Stonebridge (winner)\n; Best Album/Crossover\n* Eric Gadd - Do You Believe In Gadd?
