He left the club after only six months, due to lack of playing time, and was subsequently loaned to Prima Divisione side Portogruaro. The following season, he was sent on loan to Varese, but finished the season with no league appearances. At the start of the 2010–11 season he was loaned out again, this time to Seconda Divisione club Renate.\nAt the beginning of the 2011–12 season, Umunegbu signed for Chiasso on a free transfer, but during the January transfer window he came back to Milan as they needed a player to fill in their second non-EU spot, which otherwise would have been lost.\nOn 26 July 2012, Umunegbu signed for Bologna on a free transfer. However the deal also cost Bologna €175,000. Umunegbu immediately transferred to Belgian club Boussu for free.\nAfter a spell in Turkey, Umunegbu returned to Italy and re-joined US Arcella in the Italian Promozione, the club he played for as a child. He then moved to Thermal Abano Teolo in the Prima Categoria for the 2018-19 season. In the summer 2019 he joined Sarcedo Calcio. However, he left the club again a few months later due to the long distance between his home in Padua and Sarcedo. In December 2019, he then joined Promozione club ACD Villafranchese.\nFor the 2021-22 season, Umunegbu joined Italian Prima Categoria club Ospedaletto Euganeo Calcio.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://aic.football.it/scheda/20220/umunegbu-kingsley.htm Profile] at Assocalciatori.it\n* [https://www.tff.org/Default.aspx?pageId=526&kisiId=1945513 Kingsley Umunegbu] at TFF"
