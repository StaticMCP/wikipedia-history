Culture sites were also discovered in the north-west Balkans, which yielded painted pottery noted for its \"barbotine\" vessel surfaces. Specifically, the Starčevo settlements were located in Serbia, Körös in Hungary, and Criș in Romania.\nCharacteristics\nThe Starčevo culture is an archaeological culture of Southeastern Europe, in what is now Serbia, dating to the Neolithic period between c. 5500 and 4500 BCE (according to other source, between 6200 and 5200 BCE). The Starčevo culture is sometimes grouped together and sometimes not.\nThe Körös culture is another Neolithic archaeological culture, but in Central Europe. It was named after the river Körös in eastern Hungary and western Romania, where it is named Criș. It survived from about 5800 to 5300 BC.\nGallery\nFile:Golemata Majka.jpg|Starčevo culture sculpture\nFile:Starčevo1.jpg|Starčevo culture artefacts\nFile:Neolithic female figure b.jpg|Körös/Criş culture figurine\nFile:Crvenokosa boginja, neolit, Donja Branjevina.tif|\"Red-haired goddess\" figurine\nFile:Skopje city museum Božicata Majka.jpg|Figurine\nFile:Altar table.jpg|Starčevo ceramic altar\nFile:TumbaMadzari.jpg|Reconstruction of a settlement at Tumba Madzari, Macedonia\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*Biagi, P. and Spataro, M., 2005.
