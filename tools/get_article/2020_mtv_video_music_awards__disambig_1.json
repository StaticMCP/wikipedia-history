Keke Palmer hosted the 37th annual ceremony, which was presented primarily from New York City, but with a virtual ceremony due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLady Gaga was the most awarded act of the night with five awards, as well as the most nominated alongside Ariana Grande, with both artists receiving nine nominations each. Gaga was presented with the inaugural MTV Tricon Award for achievements in three or more fields of entertainment. The longlist of nominees for Push Best New Artist were revealed on July 23, 2020; nominees for other categories were announced on July 30. Fan voting began on July and ended on August 23. Nominees for Song of Summer, Best Group and Everyday Heroes: Frontline Medical Workers were released on August 24. The show was dedicated to Chadwick Boseman, who died of colon cancer two days before the ceremony.\nThe ceremony was aired by MTV and simulcast across other ViacomCBS cable networks. For the first time, the ceremony was also carried on broadcast television in the U.S. via co-owned The CW. The show received 6.4 million viewers in its first-run viewing (excluding livestreams through network apps), a 5% decrease from the 6.8 million viewers at the previous ceremony.\nCeremony information\nThe awards were originally scheduled to return to the Barclays Center for the first time since 2013. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was expected to be held with \"limited or no audience\", as one of the first major indoor events to be held in the city since the onset of the pandemic in the state, with MTV also announcing plans for the show to \"[span] all five boroughs\" to \"pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents\".\nMTV eventually scrapped the indoor component of the ceremony at Barclays after \"close consultation with state and local health officials\" and announced that it would be conducted in an outdoor format across the city; the arena in Brooklyn would subsequently host the 2021 event instead. The majority of performances were pre-recorded either in New York City (with locations such as Hudson Yards and a drive-in theatre in Brooklyn), or on a chroma key set in Los Angeles for acts unable to travel to New York City. BTS likewise filmed their performance on a chroma key set in Seoul, South Korea.\nNew one-off award categories for \"Quarantine Performance\" and \"Best Music Video from Home\" were added on July 30 in light of the ongoing pandemic. Three additional categories were announced on August 24: Song of Summer, Best Group and \"Everyday Heroes: Frontline Medical Workers\", with the latter created \"to celebrate performances by COVID-19 first responders\".\nIn addition to the ViacomCBS family of networks, the VMAs were also simulcast on terrestrial television by The CW (a joint venture of ViacomCBS and WarnerMedia). The CW also aired a post-show recap special, composed mostly of pre-show performance footage.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of musical performances\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Song(s)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Pre-show\n|-\n| Jack Harlow\n| \"Whats Poppin\"\n|-\n| Tate McRae\n| \"You Broke Me First\"\n|-\n| Chloe x Halle\n| \"Ungodly Hour\"\n|-\n| Lewis Capaldi\n| \"Before You Go\"\n|-\n| Machine Gun KellyBlackbearTravis Barker\n| Medley\"My Ex's Best Friend\"\"Bloody Valentine\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Main show\n|-\n| The Weeknd\n| \"Blinding Lights\"\n|-\n| DaBaby\n| Medley\"Peep Hole\"\"Blind\"\"Rockstar\"\n|-\n| Miley Cyrus\n| \"Midnight Sky\"\n|-\n| Maluma\n| \"Hawái\"\n|-\n| BTS\n| \"Dynamite\"\n|-\n| Lady GagaAriana Grande\n| Tricon Award Chromatica Medley \"Chromatica II\"\"911\"\"Rain on Me\"\"Stupid Love\"\n|-\n| JP SaxeJulia Michaels\n|\"If the World Was Ending\"\n|-\n| Doja Cat\n| Medley\"Say So\"\"Like That\"\n|-\n| Keke Palmer\n| \"Snack\"\n|-\n| CNCO\n| \"Beso\"\n|-\n| Black Eyed PeasNicky JamTyga\n| Medley\"Vida Loca\"\"I Gotta Feeling\"\n|-\n|}\nJ Balvin and Roddy Ricch were initially announced as performers on August 4 and 11 respectively, but later pulled out of the event.\nPresenters\nPresenters were announced on August 27.\nPre-show\n* Travis Mills – presented Best Alternative\n* Nessa and Jamila Mustafa – presented Best Group and Best K-Pop\nMain show\n* Jaden Smith – presented Best Collaboration\n* Drew Barrymore – presented Best Direction\n* Anthony Ramos – presented Best Latin\n* Joey King – presented Song of the Year\n* Madison Beer – presented Best Music Video from Home\n* Nicole Richie – presented Best Pop and Best R&B\n* Kelly Clarkson – presented Artist of the Year\n* Sofia Carson – presented Video for Good\n* Bella Hadid – presented the Tricon Award\n* Travis Barker – presented Best Hip Hop and introduced the \"In Memoriam\" segment\n* Machine Gun Kelly – presented Push Best New Artist\n* Bebe Rexha – presented Video of the Year\nWinners and nominees\nOn July 23, 2020, seventeen Push Best New Artist pre-nominees were announced.
