      "text": "# Best Team ESPY Award\n\nThe Best Team ESPY Award has been presented annually since 1993 to the professional, collegiate, or national team, irrespective of nationality or sport contested, adjudged to be the best in a specified  twelve-month period preceding the awards ceremony. In 2001, the award was bifurcated and the resulting honors were styled as the College Team of the Year and Pro Team of the Year ESPY Awards; the awards were joined once more in 2002.\nBetween 1993 and 2004, the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities, but balloting thereafter has been exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.\nThrough the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in July and reflect performance from the June previous. The award wasn't awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Team\n!League or competition\n!Sport\n|-\n|1993\n|Dallas Cowboys\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|1994\n|Toronto Blue Jays\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|1995\n|New York Rangers\n|National Hockey League\n|Ice hockey\n|-\n|1996\n| UConn Women's Basketball Team\n|National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I\n|Basketball\n|-\n|1997\n|New York Yankees\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|1998\n|Denver Broncos\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|1999\n|New York Yankees (2)\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|2000\n|United States Women's National Soccer Team\n|1999 FIFA Women's World Cup\n|Association football (soccer)\n|-\n|2001\n|New York Yankees (3)\n----\nOklahoma Sooners\n|Major League Baseball\n----\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association Division I-A\n|Baseball\n----\nAmerican football\n|-\n|2002\n|Los Angeles Lakers\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2003\n|Anaheim Angels\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|2004\n|Detroit Pistons\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2005\n|Boston Red Sox\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|2006\n|Pittsburgh Steelers\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2007\n|Indianapolis Colts\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2008\n|Boston Celtics\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2009\n|Los Angeles Lakers (2)\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2010\n|New Orleans Saints\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2011\n|Dallas Mavericks\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2012\n|Miami Heat\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2013\n|Miami Heat (2)\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2014\n|Seattle Seahawks\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2015\n|United States Women's National Soccer Team (2)\n|2015 FIFA Women's World Cup\n|Association football (soccer)\n|-\n|2016\n|Cleveland Cavaliers\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2017\n|Golden State Warriors\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2018\n|Houston Astros\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|2019\n|United States Women's National Soccer Team (3)\n|2019 FIFA Women's World Cup\n|Association football (soccer)\n|-\n|2020\n| colspan=3 align=center|Not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|-\n|2021\n|Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2022\n|Golden State Warriors (2)\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2023\n|Kansas City Chiefs\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2024\n|South Carolina Gamecocks\n|National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2025\n|Philadelphia Eagles\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|}\nSee also\n* Sports trophies and awards\nReferences\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090711161438/http://promo.espn.go.com/espn/specialsection/espys2009/#/bestof/ List of winners from ESPN's ESPY's site]"
