The province's capital from 1920 to 1967 was Cotabato City (of the same name) while Pagalungan became its capital from 1967 to 1973.\nOriginally a district of the former Moro Province, on September 1, 1914, the defunct Department of Mindanao and Sulu provided with autonomous government through Act No. 2408 enacted on July 23, 1914, converted the district into a province along with other former Moro Province districts: Davao, Lanao, Sulu, Zamboanga, and its former sub-province Bukidnon. Davao, Lanao and Zamboanga were then later split and partitioned into different current provinces, Sulu was then later split and partitioned into the current provinces of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, and Bukidnon mostly remain what it is today.\nThe province was one of the largest provinces of the Philippines, with an area of . It was dissolved on 1973, comprising what are now the provinces of Cotabato (North), South Cotabato, Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur,  Sultan Kudarat, and Sarangani.\nHistory\nEstablishment and composition\n, fourth from the left, with American officers circa 1899.]]\nUpon its separation from the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, Cotabato comprised the municipalities of Cotabato (the provincial capital), Dulawan, and Midsayap, and the following municipal districts:\n* Awang\n* Balatikan\n* Balut\n* Banisilan\n* Barira\n* Buayan\n* Bugasan\n* Buldun\n* Buluan\n* Carmen\n* Daguma\n* Dinaig\n* Dulawan\n* Gambar\n* Glan\n* Isulan\n* Kabakan\n* Kalanganan\n* Kiamba\n* Kidapawan\n* Kitubud\n* Kling\n* Koronadal\n* Lebak\n* Libungan\n* Liguasan\n* Maganui\n* Nuling\n* Parang\n* Pikit-Pagalungan\n* Reina Regente\n* Salaman\n* Sebu\n* Silik\n* Subpangan\n* Talayan\n* Tumbau\nOn June 18, 1966, South Cotabato was separated from the province through Republic Act No. 4849. That very same day, the provincial capital was moved from Cotabato City to Pagalungan.\nDissolution\nOn November 22, 1973, the remaining territories of the Province of Cotabato was divided into North Cotabato, Maguindanao and Sultan Kudarat through Presidential Decree No. 341.\nOn March 7, 1984, North Cotabato was renamed to simply \"Cotabato\" through Batas Pambansa Blg. 660.\nOn March 16, 1992, the province of Sarangani was formed out of South Cotabato.\nSee also\n* Islam in the Philippines\nReferences"
