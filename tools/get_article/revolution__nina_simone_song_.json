      "text": "# Revolution (Nina Simone song)\n\n\"Revolution\" is a 1969 answer song by the American jazz musician Nina Simone and Weldon Irvine. It was released as a single in 1969 and on the album To Love Somebody in 1969. The single release was split over two sides of a 45 rpm disc and these two edits were used as separate tracks on the album. The song was released the year after the Beatles' \"Revolution\", and is a variation of that song. \"Revolution\" didn't do as well as expected and Simone has expressed surprise and disappointment at its lack of success.\nReferences"
