The school was founded as the School of Pedagogy in 1890. It was known as the NYU School of Education before 2001.\nLocated on NYU's founding campus in Greenwich Village, the Steinhardt School offers bachelor's, master's, advanced certificate, and doctoral programs in the fields of applied psychology, art, education, health, media, and music. NYU Steinhardt also offers several degree programs at NYU's Brooklyn campus.\nHistory\nFounded in 1890 as the School of Pedagogy, the school soon added courses in psychology, counseling, art, and music. In 1910, it established the first United States university chair in experimental education. During the 1920s, enrollment increased from 990 to more than 9,500 students. The Education Building on Washington Square opened in 1930 and still serves as the School's home today.\nThe School was named the Steinhardt School of Education in 2001, in recognition of a $10 million donation, the largest it has ever received, from Michael and Judy Steinhardt. In 2007, the school was renamed the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development to reflect the diversity of its academic programs.\nAcademics\nNYU Steinhardt enrolls roughly 5950 students from 67 countries, consisting of approximately 2540 undergraduates, 2820 master's and advanced certificate students, 390 PhD students, and 140 professional doctorate students.  Nearly one-third are people of color and 16% are international students. Its graduate school is NYU's largest.\nIn 2013–14, Steinhardt granted 705 undergraduate degrees, 1551 master's degrees, and 154 doctoral degrees. There are more than 75,000 active Steinhardt alumni.\nThe school employs 290 full-time faculty in 11 academic departments:\n*Department of Administration, Leadership, and Technology\nMaster's, doctoral, and advanced certificate programs are offered in Educational Leadership, Educational Communication and Technology, Higher and Postsecondary Education, and Business and Workplace Education.\n*Department of Applied Psychology\nPrograms include an undergraduate degree in Applied Psychology; master's degrees in Counseling and Guidance, Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness, online Master's in Counseling (Counseling@NYU), online Master's in Mental Health Counseling, Online Master's in School Counseling, and Human Development and Social Intervention; and doctoral degrees in Counseling Psychology, Psychological Development, Online Doctorate in Occupational Therapy and Psychology and Social Intervention.\n*Department of Communicative Sciences and Disorders\nWith programs for undergraduate, master's and doctoral studies.

Continuing to provide the unique educational experience of a university school of pedagogy and performance as well as inheriting the rich performance tradition from New York College of Music, the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions was developed and is now home to nearly all of NYU's music performance and music education degree programs.
