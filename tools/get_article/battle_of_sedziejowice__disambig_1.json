A party of 1,500 Polish insurgents, commanded by Edmund Taczanowski, clashed with soldiers of the Imperial Russian Army, commanded by rittmeister von Grabbe. The battle resulted in Polish victory.\nIn early September 1863, an insurgent party of Taczanowski camped near Sędziejowice. When the Russians found out about this, they decided to send there Grodno Hussars under Rittmeister von Grabbe, supported by Don Cossacks. It is unknown how many Russian soldiers were engaged in the clash, as almost all of them were killed. A few survivors, including von Grabbe himself, were captured by the insurgents.\nFollowing the battle, strong Russian forces concentrated between Częstochowa and Łódź, ready to prevent any insurgent movements.\nSources\n* Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe.
