Thereafter, Andrews served as the Leader of the Opposition.\n|\n|-\n| Harry Perkins\n| N/A\n| Being the target of a conspiracy orchestrated by the Civil Service, the General Staff, newspaper magnate Sir George Fison, and the United States to undermine his radical policy agenda, Perkins is ultimately forced to resign after a meltdown at a nuclear power station whose creation he supported as secretary of state for the public sector. He represented the Sheffield Central constituency. The sequel novel The Friends of Harry Perkins, published in 2019 and set forty years after the events of A Very British Coup, opens with Harry Perkins' funeral.\n|\n|-\n| Lawrence Wainwright\n| N/A\n| Initially serving as chancellor of the exchequer, Wainwright was a co-conspirator in a plot to remove Harry Perkins as prime minister and stymie his legislative agenda, hoping to become prime minister himself as a result after losing out on becoming Labour leader due to an electoral college system. After Perkins' resignation, Wainwright was elected leader by a majority of Labour MPs whilst Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House Jock Steeples was declared acting leader by the Labour Party National Executive. Wainwright was appointed prime minister at the intervention of DI5. After replacing the entire Cabinet (with Steeples turning down a minor position), Wainwright abandoned Perkins' policies not already implemented, including British withdrawal from NATO, nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the Common Market, and the dissolution of newspaper monopolies. In The Friends of Harry Perkins, it was revealed that he served for only two years before Labour fell from power.\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | A Very British Coup\n| Thomas Andrews\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Television\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1988\n| Roger Brierley\n| Andrews led a Conservative majority government to a landslide defeat in the 1991 general election following a banking sector crisis brought about by revelations of misconduct uncovered by Labour leader Harry Perkins. Andrews thereafter served as Leader of the Opposition. He was mentioned as representing the Surrey East constituency, and likely succeeded Margaret Thatcher (who was mentioned by Perkins as a former prime minister).\n|\n|-\n| Harry Perkins\n| Ray McAnally\n| Following much of the plot of the novel, albeit opposed to nuclear power, Perkins is presented with forged evidence of financial irregularity suggesting that he accepted £300,000 from the Soviet government as part of loan negotiations with the International State Bank of Moscow, implicating his former lover Helen Jarvis. With Fison's newspapers falsely speculating on Perkins' health and suggesting overwhelming public support for Perkins's former chancellor Lawrence Wainwright (a co-conspirator) as prime minister, he uses a live national broadcast intended for the announcement of his resignation on grounds of ill health to reveal the blackmail conspiracy and to call an early general election. On Election Day morning, it is implied that a military coup has begun. He represented the Sheffield Central constituency.\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | ''Anno Domini 2000, or, Woman's Destiny\n| Mrs Hardinge\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Novel\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1889\n| N/A\n| Imperial prime minister of a federated British Empire.\n|\n|-\n| Lady Cairo\n| N/A\n| Imperial prime minister of a federated British Empire, succeeding Mrs Hardinge.\n|\n|-\n|Back in the USSA''\n|Enoch Powell\n|Novel\n|1997\n|N/A\n|Said to have succeeded Anthony Eden.

Considering re-election to be his first priority, he agreed to help only after learning that saving the universe would be a \"huge vote winner\", albeit deploying an ineffective one-man British Isles Defence Force. He dies after an enraged Pip throws him into Benevolent's Universe Destroying Device (one of many bizarre and violent deaths suffered by members of the Clampvulture family). Clampvulture's unfulfilled campaign promises included votes for horses and free jam.\n|\n|-\n| Bodyguard\n| John Vosler\n| Television\n| 2018\n| David Westhead\n| Forced to resign after a kompromat originally given to Home Secretary Julia Montague was leaked following her assassination.\n|-\n| Cobra\n| Robert Sutherland\n| Television\n| 2020\n| Robert Carlyle\n| Sutherland oversees response efforts following power outages caused by a solar flare, and has to deal with a resultant blockade of Northumberland and the drug overdose death of his daughter Ellie's best friend, which she caused.

A group of disgruntled soldiers, upset by the military cuts and by Dalton's previous decision to withdraw British troops during a Guatemalan invasion of Belize that resulted in the deaths of local people, plan to oust Dalton by kidnapping her husband during his work with Doctors Without Borders and forcing her to resign in exchange for his release; when she does not, the group change tactics and begin acts of terrorism by inciting riots and orchestrating a mass assault of the Home Secretary. During this, and as a result of the lack of medicines, a 5-year-old boy dies in the street outside a pharmacy. Dalton arranges her husband's rescue with French president Vivienne Toussant (Julie Delpy); after French military save him, the soldiers retaliate by murdering Dalton's father and arranging for a bomb to be placed in 10 Downing Street.
