Party president Katie Morello indicated the change was part of a renewal process and coincides with expectations of an early provincial election.\nThe vote takes place against the backdrop of leadership elections across all major provincial parties in Prince Edward Island. The Greens elected Matt MacFarlane as their new leader in June 2025. The NDP in Prince Edward Island is scheduled to select a new leader in 2026, while the Progressive Conservatives have not yet announced a date for their leadership election.\nIt is the first leadership election of the party with more than one candidate since 2003.\nRules and procedures\nAll current Liberal Party members who registered before 27 September 2025 are eligible to vote. Membership is valid for two years and costs $10.\nDue to the September 2025 Canada Post labour dispute, the Prince Edward Island Liberal Party adjusted the voting process for its 2025 leadership convention. Registered party members voted using an electronic system operated by Intelivote Inc., a Nova Scotia-based company. It is the first time the party uses an online voting system in its history.\nVoter information was originally scheduled to be mailed on September 29, 2025, but most members received it on September 26. Members without an email address were contacted directly by phone by Intelivote to provide voting instructions.\nVoting is open from 9 a.m. on September 29 until 5 p.m. on October 4, 2025. Assisted voting is available beginning at noon on October 4 at the Delta Hotels Prince Edward for members who did not receive their voter information or required assistance.\nThe Prince Edward Island Liberal Party requires prospective candidates to meet specific fundraising thresholds to enter and compete in leadership or electoral races. Individuals seeking nomination must initially raise $7,500 to qualify as a candidate. During the course of the campaign, candidates are expected to raise an additional $15,000, 50% of which is reimbursable as eligible campaign expenses. These measures are designed to ensure candidates demonstrate both financial commitment and organizational support before participating in party contests.\nThe spending limit was set at $50,000 per leadership candidate campaign.\nTimeline\n*April 6, 2023 – Sharon Cameron resigns as leader of the Liberal Party.
