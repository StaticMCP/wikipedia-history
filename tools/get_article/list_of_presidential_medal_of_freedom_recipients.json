      "text": "# List of Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients\n\n]]\nThis is a partial list of recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, listed chronologically within the aspect of life in which each recipient is or was renowned.\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom is awarded by the president of the United States to \"any person recommended to the President for award of the Medal or any person selected by the President upon his own initiative\". Before 1970, honorees were either selected by the president or recommended to them by the Distinguished Civilian Service Awards Board.\nHistory\nTypically the medal is bestowed upon the recipient by the sitting president who has chosen them. However, the first recipients selected by president John F. Kennedy before his assassination were formally awarded by his successor in office, Lyndon B. Johnson.\nPresident Barack Obama awarded 118 medals, the most of any president, followed by President Bill Clinton with 89 medal recipients. Three people—Ellsworth Bunker, Colin Powell, and Ben Carson—are two-time recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Colin Powell received his second award with distinction, while Ellsworth Bunker was given both of his awards with distinction.\nEight presidents have themselves received the medal either posthumously, post-presidency, or prior to being elected:\n* John F. Kennedy (1963, posthumously)\n* Lyndon B. Johnson (1980, posthumously)\n* Ronald Reagan (1993, with distinction)\n* Gerald Ford (1999)\n* Jimmy Carter (1999)\n* George H. W. Bush (2011)\n* Bill Clinton (2013)\n* Joe Biden (2017, as Vice President; with distinction)\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama stated that there was no precedent to revoke a Presidential Medal of Freedom, regarding the award given to stand-up comedian and actor Bill Cosby. After being awarded the medal, Cosby was convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault, though the convictions were later overturned.\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom is related to, but distinct from, the Medal of Freedom, an earlier award issued between 1945 and 1963 to honor US civilian contributions to World War II.\nIn 2022 at the age of 25, athlete and activist Simone Biles became the youngest person to receive the award.\nDeclinations of the award\nBill Belichick, coach of the New England Patriots, was offered the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump, and initially accepted it, but changed his mind and turned down the medal after the January 6 United States Capitol attack.\nCountry musician Dolly Parton turned down the medal twice from Donald Trump. Parton said she turned it down the first time because her husband was ill, and the second time because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAwarded with Distinction\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|, 28 individuals (Ellsworth Bunker twice, which is a total of 29 WDs) have been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (with Distinction):\n;John F.
