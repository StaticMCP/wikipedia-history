A small number of nations, like South Africa and Botswana, have both an executive presidency and a system of governance that is parliamentary, with the President elected by and dependent on the confidence of the legislature.  In these states, the offices of president and prime minister (as both head of state and head of government respectively) might be said to be combined.\nThe above examples notwithstanding, executive presidencies are found in presidential systems and semi-presidential systems.\nTo prevent the abuse of power, checks and balances are implemented through the legislative and judiciary bodies. For example, in the United States one method is impeachment whereby the president can be held accountable if others deem their actions unconstitutional, with the most recent example being the impeachment trials of President Donald Trump.\nElections\nIn parliamentary republics, presidents are most commonly chosen by the legislature. However, in those countries with both a prime minister and a president, methods differ. For example, in Czechia a majority vote from the public elects the president.\nIn full presidential systems and parliamentary systems with a constitutional presidency, the president is elected independently of the legislature. There are several methods in which to do this, including the plurality system and the two-round system. Whilst these methods use the popular vote, not all presidents are chosen in this way. For example, to be elected in the United States, a candidate must win a majority of the votes from the Electoral College, not the popular vote.\nContemporary examples\nPresidential systems\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*'\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*'\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSemi-presidential systems\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  *\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* '\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* '\n* †\nParliamentary and related systems\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nCorporate example\nIn the corporate environment, the head of a company is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), with the president being second in command. Leading the company's executive group rather than the overall company, the executive president in this instance is responsible for day-to-day operations. In small businesses, the CEO and executive president are the same, whereas in larger companies the roles are carried out by two separate people.\nSee also\n* Corporate governance\n* Parliamentary republic\n* Parliamentary systems with constitutional presidency\n* Presidential system\nNotes\nReferences"
