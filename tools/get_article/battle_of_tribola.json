Among the survivors was Viriathus.\nBy 147 BC, the Lusitanians, numbering around 10,000, rose up once more under his leadership, driven by a desire for revenge and freedom from Roman oppression.\nBattle\nMarcus Vetilius, commanding a force of 10,000 Romans, set a trap for the Lusitanians leaving them with no choice but to surrender. However, Viriathus, recalling the treacheries of Galba and Lucullus, inspired his people to fight on. Taking 1,000 men, he launched an attack on the Roman forces. This maneuver allowed the remaining Lusitanians to escape to safety with orders to regroup at Tribola. Following this, Viriathus ambushed Vetilius.\nVetilius, unaware of the ambush, marched his army into the thicket. Viriathus and his forces launched a surprise attack from both sides, driving them over the cliffs and taking them prisoners.\nVetilius himself was taken prisoner, however, the man who captured him, not knowing who he was, but seeing that he was old and fat, and considering him worthless, killed him.\nAftermath\nOut of the 10,000 Roman soldiers, only 6,000 managed to escape to the nearby city of Carpessus (believed to be the ancient city of Tartessos). The surviving Roman soldiers were stationed on the walls of the town by the quaestor who accompanied Vetilius, badly demoralized. Having asked and obtained 5,000 allies from the Belli and Titthi, he sent them against Viriathus, who slew them all, so that there was not one left to tell the tale. After that the quaestor remained quietly in the town waiting for help from Rome.\nSee also\n*Viriathus\n*Lusitanian War\nReferences\n*\n*"
