It is topped with a cross brought back from the battlefield cemeteries by one of the families.  It is set on a square plinth which is set on four layers of octagonal steps.  The names of the deceased are inscribed on three of the faces of the plinth.  The fourth, west face of the plinth contains the commemoration details.\nTHE GREAT WAR\n1914-1918\nTHEIR NAME SHALL LIVE\nFOR EVERMORE\n1939-1945\nHistory\nOn 9 May 1915 four Stanwick men of the Northamptonshire Regiment were killed during the Battle of Aubers Ridge; James Brawn, Thomas Craven and brothers, Herbert and William Felce.\nOn 8 May 1921 Stanwick's War Memorial was unveiled by Colonel Pratt, Lord of the Manor.  The memorial was erected to commemorate those who had died during The First World War and the names of those who had died during The Second World War were added to the base of the memorial after that conflict had ended. The memorial is unique in that it is topped with a genuine cross brought back from the battlefield cemeteries.\nOn 8 May 1945, the Allies formally accepted Germany’s unconditional surrender of its armed forces, marking the end of World War II in Europe.  This date is celebrated in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth as Victory in Europe Day.\nIn 2015, Historic England added the memorial to the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II structure, as \"an eloquent witness to the tragic impact of world events on the local community, and the sacrifice it made in the conflicts of the twentieth century\".\nNames on the memorial\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:10px solid black\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | War Memorial\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" | South Face\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" | East Face\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" | North Face\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | World War One (1914-1918)\n|-\n| William Andrews\n| Herbert Felce\n| Reginald Morris\n|-\n| Edward W.
