His father, David Hayward, was a printer and church organist. He was educated at Tooting Bec Grammar School (now Ernest Bevin Academy) and developed a talent for painting and drawing. After school, he enrolled at St Martin's School of Art.\nAfter leaving St. Martin's, Hayward received an offer from Royal College of Art, but he instead joined Faith Craft, a company that designed ecclesiastical furniture. He remained there for 18 years before setting up his own practice as a stained glass artist. His first major commission was a set of ruined windows of the Christopher Wren church, St Mary-le-Bow, which had been damaged in the Second World War.\nList of works\n* Sherborne Abbey, Sherborne, Dorset\n* St. Matthew's Church, Camberwell, Greater London\n* St Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside, Greater London\n* Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Edgefield, Norfolk\n* Shrine of Our Lady, Walsingham, Norfolk\n* St. Richard's Church, Haywards Heath, West Sussex\n* Ashdown Park Hotel, East Sussex\n* St Mary the Virgin, Higham Ferrers, Northants\n* St Mary's Old Basing and Lychpit\nGallery\nFile:The West Window At Sherborne Abbey - geograph.org.uk - 1275514.jpg|The West Window At Sherborne Abbey, installed in 1997.
