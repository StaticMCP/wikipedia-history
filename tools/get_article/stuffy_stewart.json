He was the greatest base stealer in Southern Association history.   He also could field well, but was not very good with the stick.    In 1926 he was used 34 times as a pinch runner, scoring 13 runs and stealing six bases.    These were probably the top marks for a substitute runner up to that point.   Stewart was not exclusively a pinch runner.   In 1926 and 1927 he was also used as a late-inning substitute at second base for Manager Bucky Harris.   In 1928, Stewart went back to Birmingham where he led the SA for the fifth time in thefts, with 61.  He returned to Washington for 22 games in 1929, mostly as a pinch runner, and that was his last stint in the majors.\nReferences\nRetrosheet\nExternal links\n* http://research.sabr.org/journals/lewis-making-mark\n*http://research.sabr.org/journals/home\n*"
