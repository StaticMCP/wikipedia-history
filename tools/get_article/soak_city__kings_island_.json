Opening in 1989 as WaterWorks, the water park is included with the price of admission to Kings Island. It is owned and operated by Six Flags.\nHistory\nSoak City originally opened in 1989 as a  water park under the name WaterWorks featuring 15 water slides, a wave pool, and a lazy river ride called Action River.  WaterWorks was the first themed area to be added to Kings Island since 1976, bringing the total to seven.  The cost was roughly $4 million USD.\nThe water park was expanded in 1997 to . It was renamed in 2004 to Crocodile Dundee's Boomerang Bay, and again in 2007 to Boomerang Bay dropping Crocodile Dundee from the name. On September 2, 2011, Kings Island announced that the water park would undergo a $10-million expansion, which would include the renovation of the water park's main entrance, a revamp of the existing Lazy River ride, and the construction of additional amenities. A second, larger wave pool was also added, and the water park's name was changed to Soak City for the 2012 season.\nList of attractions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!

Riders board side-by-side rafts at the starting line where a conveyor belt launch sends them plunging down a 33-foot, 47-degree first drop. Giant windows help racers see if their raft is in the lead while the water coaster reaches its 30 mph, fastest speed. As each raft nears the bottom of the drop and starts to climb upward, water jets drench the riders and propel them up into an enclosed tunnel illuminated with special lighting effects. The race is on as racers zip through more twists and turns, rushing into an open-air, high-banking slingshot, whipping them around 180 degrees into a gravity-defying final mega drop to see who crosses the finish line first!\n| style=\"background: #F38F04; font-style: bold; font-size: 125%; text-align: center;\" | 4\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n|Salamander Sliders\n|\n|2025\n|Located in Splash River Junction.
