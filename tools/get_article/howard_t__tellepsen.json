Bracewell, replaced the Port authority's second fireboat, the Captain Crotty, which had been in service since 1950.  They joined the Captain J.L. Farnsworth, which had been in service since 1973.\nThe Port authority replaced the older vessels with three Metalcraft 70 fireboats, each of which was more powerful than the three retiring craft put together.\nThe vessel was named after a real estate developer who was appointed to the Port authority.\n}}"
