At the 2021 census the population was 12,644 residents, including the settlements of Market Warsop, Church Warsop, Warsop Vale, Meden Vale, Sookholme and Spion Kop.\nHistory\nChurch Warsop appeared in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a settlement named Wareshope and was recorded as having a church which was St Peter and St Paul. This formed part of the hundred of Bassetlaw. The area was divided amongst the Saxon Lords Godric, Leviet, and Ulchel. Gleadthorpe Grange was also recorded in Domesday. From the Norman conquest period onwards, Warsop was held by the Norman Baron Roger de Busli, and partially held by the King's Soke of Mansfield. Sookholme and its medieval church St Augustine's along with Nettleworth Manor were first recorded later in public records during the 12th century.\nLandmarks\nKing John and Edward I are reputed to have had impromptu parliaments at the Parliament Oak Tree in the far east of the parish during the 13th century.\nHenry III granted the advowson of the manor to Robert de Lexington in 1232, and after his death it passed to his brother John and further to his wife’s nephew Robert de Sutton, becoming lord of the manor in 1268. John Nunnes of London, obtained the manor in 1329 and he established a market in 1330. Two annual fairs were eventually granted along with a Saturday market located south of the River Meden. By this time, this area was known as Warsop Fair Town, and later Market Warsop, the original settlement north of the Meden becoming Church Warsop. The wider manor passed through to the de Roos family and their heirs the Earls of Rutland. The Knight family bought the manor In 1675, and in 1846 it was inherited by Sir Henry FitzHerbert of Tissington, the family continue hold much of the area into the present day.\nWarsop watermill was built in 1767.\nWarsop windmill, first called Forest Mill but also later known as Bradmer Mill, was a stone-built tower erected in 1825. It was 28 feet high with three storeys, a fourth storey being added later in brick. The mill had four sails, two of which were blown down by a gale in 1910, after which the mill was worked for a short time on the two remaining sails. By the 1920s the mill had lost all its sails and its cap. The tower is a Grade II listed building, standing to the southeast of Warsop close to the A6075.\nIn 1930, Samuel Fell Wilson, a Warsop grocer, wine merchant, and publisher of the Warsop and District Almanack, was shot in the head and chest as he sat in his car outside the mill. A street bears his name.\nWarsop Town Hall was completed in 1933.\nIn 2010, a new Market Cross was commissioned and erected at Downy Hill, on the southern edge of the town centre at the side of the A60 road. Historically, a cross was known to have existed in the 1500s, and a replacement occurred in 1787. The foundations were excavated in 1911.\nCoal mining\nTwo collieries were built within the parish to take advantage of lucrative coal seams within Nottinghamshire, Warsop Main to the north west in 1893 and Welbeck (the grounds of which overlapped mostly into the adjacent and present-day Norton, Cuckney, Holbeck and Welbeck civil parish) in the north east from 1912. Communities were established alongside them to house miners and their families, Warsop Vale and Meden Vale (originally Welbeck Colliery Village) respectively, while Spion Kop was built south west of Market Warsop as an overspill settlement. Warsop Main closed in 1989 and Welbeck in 2010.\nGovernance\nThe parish was an urban district in Nottinghamshire until 1974, when it joined with Mansfield Borough and Woodhouse Urban District Council to form Mansfield District Council. Warsop retains a council, as a successor parish, including the localities of Market Warsop, Church Warsop, Meden Vale, Warsop Vale and Spion Kop. The council is based at Warsop Town Hall.\nAfter re-alignment of local wards within Mansfield District Council before the 2011 local elections to achieve a standard format of one councillor-per-ward, Warsop has four designated wards named as Warsop Carrs, Netherfield, Market Warsop and Meden.\nWarsop is a part of the Mansfield Parliamentary Constituency since 2010, whose MP from 2017 to May 2024 was Ben Bradley, followed by Steve Yemm.\nGeography and demography\nWarsop is surrounded by Mansfield Woodhouse and Mansfield to the south, Shirebrook and Langwith in Derbyshire to the west, Nether Langwith, Cuckney and Norton to the north, Perlethorpe cum Budby, Edwinshowe and Kings Clipstone parishes to the east.\nThe parish contains five historic settlements and three former mining villages:\n* Market Warsop, the largest area at the centre, south of the River Meden\n* Church Warsop, north of the Meden\n* Sookholme, to the west of the parish\n* Nettleworth Manor, in the south west\n* Gleadthorpe Grange to the far north east.\nNearby settlements built to support local mining activities in the 20th century were:\n* Meden Vale, in the north east\n* Warsop Vale to the north west\n* Spion Kop in the south of the parish sited along a short stretch of the A60 road\nAt the 2001 census the overall parish had a population of 12,365, reducing to 11,999 at the 2011 census, and increasing to 12,644 in 2021.\nEducation\nMarket Warsop is home to Meden School on Burns Lane, part of a local group named Torch Academy Gateway Trust.
