As it was a profitable crop, by 1901 many farmers were growing tobacco, achieving record prices.\nThe Hynes Bridge over the Dumaresq River linking Riverton in Queensland to Mingoola in New South Wales opened in June 1941. It was named after J. D. Hynes, the President of the Tenterfield Shire Council in recognition of his work.\nUntil the 1960s, timber was an important industry for the area with a timber mill at Riverton owned by Rex Weight.\nThe Riverton Limestone Quarry opened in the 1960s.
