After Peel's retirement in 1895, Ponsonby was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). He also took the courtesy title of Viscount Duncannon following his father's accession to the earldom of Bessborough, also in that year. In 1898, he was High Sheriff of Carlow. He was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) on 11 August 1902, and a Knight of the Order of St Patrick (KP) in 1914. He was also involved in business and became a director of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in March 1895, and served as its chairman from February 1908 until his death.\nFamily\nOn 22 April 1875, Ponsonby married Blanche Guest (1847–1919), the sister of Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, and they had six children:\n*Lady Olwen Verene (1876–1927), married Geoffrey Browne, 3rd Baron Oranmore and Browne.\n*Lady Helen Blanche Irene (1878–1962), married John Congreve (1872–1957) and settled at Mount Congreve estate in County Waterford, Ireland.\n*Vere Brabazon, later styled Viscount Duncannon, later 9th Earl of Bessborough (1880–1956), Governor-General of Canada.\n*Hon. (Cyril) Myles Brabazon (1881–1915), soldier and father of the 11th Earl of Bessborough.\n*Hon. Bertie Brabazon (1885–1967), barrister and soldier.\n*Lady Gweneth Frida (1888–1984), married (1) Hon. Windham Baring, (2) Ralph Cavendish.\nPonsonby inherited the earldom from his father in 1906, and on his death in 1920, his titles passed to his eldest son, Vere. His death procured an erroneous obituary of Lord Desborough being published after The Times confused the two peers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Burke's Peerage, 107th edition.\n*\n*"
