This outline is an overview of Slavic topics; for outlines related to specific Slavic groups and topics, see the links in the Other Slavic outlines section below.\nThe Slavs are a collection of peoples who speak the various Slavic languages, belonging to the larger Balto-Slavic branch of the Indo-European languages. Slavs are geographically distributed throughout northern Eurasia, mainly inhabiting Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and Siberia. A large Slavic minority is also scattered across the Baltic states and Central Asia, and from the late 19th century, a substantial Slavic diaspora developed throughout the Americas.\nHuman geography\n* Slavs\n** East Slavs, West Slavs, South Slavs\n** Antes people, Braničevci, Buzhans, Carantanians, Guduscani, Melingoi, Merehani, Slavs in Lower Pannonia, Praedenecenti, Sclaveni, Sebbirozi, Seven Slavic tribes, Severians, Zeriuani, Znetalici\n** Belarusians, Bosniaks, Bulgarians, Croats, Czechs, Kashubians, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Poles, Russians, Rusyns, Slovaks, Serbs, Slovenes, Sorbs, Ukrainians\n* Slavic names, Slavic name suffixes\nHistory\nArticles about Slavic history before the Mongol invasions of Slavic lands.
