These institutions play a pivotal role in nurturing and honing the talents of aspiring artists, facilitating their artistic development.\nFurthermore, cultural institutions that receive financial support from Central Government Corporations or Municipalities are also eligible to apply for the award. This provision ensures that institutions with diverse funding sources can be considered for recognition, facilitating a fair and inclusive selection process.\nOnce an institution has been bestowed with the award, it becomes ineligible for subsequent awards. This policy ensures a balanced and equitable distribution of recognition among different institutions over time, fostering a dynamic and evolving artistic landscape.\nMoreover, it is imperative for an institution to possess a well-constituted managing body, with clearly defined powers and duties stipulated in its constitution. Additionally, the institution should enjoy a commendable reputation within the local community, serving as a testament to its unwavering dedication to promoting and supporting the arts.\nProcedure\nAnnually, the Department of Art and Culture issues a press release or advertisement with the purpose of inviting commendations for the award.
