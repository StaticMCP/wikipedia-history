The ceremony is televised on ITV. The trophies given to the winners are made from metal and glass and have been manufactured by British firm Creative Awards since their inception. The majority of the awards are voted for by a panel of industry professionals, while certain awards including Best British Soap and Best Leading Performer are voted for by the general public.\nHistory\n, who plays Stacey Slater in the BBC soap opera EastEnders, holds the record for most individual soap awards, with eight wins.]]\nThe first British Soap Awards took place in 1999 and was presented by Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, who presented the awards until 2001. Matthew Kelly presented the 2002 awards, before being replaced by Des O'Connor and Melanie Sykes in 2003. Paul O'Grady presented the awards between 2004 and 2005. Phillip Schofield and Fern Britton took over as presenters in 2006. Britton left in 2008, however Schofield continued to present the awards as a solo presenter until the 2022, as in May 2023, after presenting the ceremonies for 16 years, Schofield announced that he had quit. On 1 June 2023, it was announced that Jane McDonald would take over from Schofield as the new host of the awards.\nAlthough it is an ITV Studios production, the events were held at the BBC Television Centre in London until 2009. The ceremonies have since been held at various locations in London and Manchester, including the Granada Studios, the London Studios, dock10, the Hackney Empire, the Palace Theatre and the Lowry. The four soap operas currently nominated for awards are Coronation Street, EastEnders, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks. Now-defunct soaps that were formerly nominated for awards are Brookside, Crossroads, Family Affairs, Night and Day and Doctors.\nIn 2016, it was announced that the award for outstanding achievement off-screen would be known as the Tony Warren Award following the death of Tony Warren, the creator of Coronation Street. On 1 May 2018, ITV announced that for the 20th anniversary of the show, it would be broadcast live for the first time on 2 June 2018. In March 2020, it was announced that the 2020 ceremony had been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ITV instead aired a 60-minute special in its place titled The British Soap Awards Celebrates 21 Years, narrated by presenter Phillip Schofield. In April 2021, it was announced that the 2021 ceremony had also been cancelled once again due to the pandemic.\nIn April 2022, it was confirmed that the British Soap Awards would be held in June 2022. They also announced the introduction of two new viewer-voted categories, Best Family and Best Leading Performer. With the introduction of the gender-neutral Best Leading Performer category, it was confirmed that the awards for Best Actress and Best Actor had been axed. Then in 2023, they reintroduced Villain of the Year as a viewer-voted category, as well as making the Best Young Performer award viewer-voted for the first time.\nOn 1 November 2023, the 2024 British Soap Awards were cancelled for an undisclosed reason by ITV. However, it was confirmed that they would return in 2025.\nCategories\nCurrent\n* Best British Soap\n* Best Comedy Performance\n* Best Dramatic Performance\n* Best Family\n* Best Leading Performer\n* Best Newcomer\n* Best On-Screen Partnership\n* Best Single Episode\n* Best Storyline\n* Best Young Performer\n* Scene of the Year\n* Villain of the Year\n* Outstanding Achievement Award\n* Tony Warren Award\nDefunct\n* Best Actor (1999–2019)\n* Best Actress (1999–2019)\n* Best Bitch (2004–2006)\n* Best Exit (1999–2013)\n* Best Foreign Soap (1999–2000)\n* Best Female Dramatic Performance (2016–2019)\n* Best Male Dramatic Performance (2016–2019)\n* Greatest Moment (2018)\n* Hero of the Year (2001–2003)\n* Sexiest Male (1999–2014)\n* Sexiest Female (1999–2014)\n* Special Achievement (1999, 2001–2002, 2004–2012)\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
