They were first presented in May 1987, billed as the \"first awards show to honor all forms of comedy.\" In 1989, after the death of Lucille Ball, the statue was named \"the Lucy\" to honor the comic legend.\nThe awards ceased after 2001. NBC revived the awards for a single year in May 2014.\nHistory\nGeorge Schlatter created and produced the American Comedy Awards that first aired on ABC on May 20, 1987, later moving to FOX and finally Comedy Central.\nPreviously, ABC had broadcast a similar awards program for two years in the 1970s; it was called the \"American Academy of Humor\" and was \"founded\" by Alan King.\nThe last ACA ceremony in 2001 was aired and produced by the cable network Comedy Central; in 2003 that network tried to replicate the awards with its own Commie Awards in what turned out to be a one-time replacement.  In 2011 Comedy Central created a new annual awards show, The Comedy Awards, which first aired on April 10, 2011.\n1987 awards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Category\n! Winner\n!
