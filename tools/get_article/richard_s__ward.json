He is a Professor of Mathematical & Theoretical Particle Physics at the University of Durham.\nWork\nWard earned his Ph.D. from the University of Oxford in 1977, under the supervision of Roger Penrose. He is most famous for his extension of Penrose's twistor theory to nonlinear cases, which he with Michael Atiyah used to describe instantons by vector bundles on the three-dimensional complex projective space. He has related interests in the theory of monopoles, topological solitons and skyrmions.\nHonors and awards\nWard was awarded the Whitehead Prize in 1989 for his work in mathematical physics. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 2005. His certificate of election reads: }}\nBibliography\nBooks\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=_VDrKu4tvVsC Twistor geometry and field theory] (with Raymond O.
