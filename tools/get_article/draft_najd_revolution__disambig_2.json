This caused widespread resentment among the local population, leading to the outbreak of the Najd Revolt in 1819.\nRevolt\nThe Najd rebels, composed of local tribes and supporters of the previous Saudi regime, rose up against Ottoman authority. The revolt was met with a military response from Ibrahim Pasha's forces. Despite resistance from the Najdis, the Ottomans successfully suppressed the uprising.\nAftermath\nThe suppression of the revolt reinforced Ottoman control over Najd for a short period. It also delayed the re-establishment of Saudi rule until the emergence of the Second Saudi State in the 1820s under Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud.\nReferences\n* \"Ibrahim Pasha\". Marefa.
