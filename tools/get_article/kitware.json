The company is involved in the research and development of open-source software in the fields of computer vision, medical imaging, visualization, 3D data publishing, and technical software development.\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 1998 by Will Schroeder, Ken Martin, Lisa Avila, Charles Law and Bill Hoffman to support the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). VTK was initially created in 1993 by Schroeder, Martin and Bill Lorensen as companion software to “The Visualization Toolkit: An Object-Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics,\" originally published by Prentice-Hall.  As VTK was released open source, a user community developed around the software and the founders of Kitware took this opportunity to start the business. Later, the company expanded its focus and offerings to include development in other areas such as biomedical imaging, large data visualization, quality software process, informatics, and data management.\nThe company has four additional offices: Carrboro, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Santa Fe, New Mexico; Arlington, Virginia; and Kitware SAS, the European office, in Lyon, France.\nKitware contributes to many popular open-source projects, such as VTK and CMake.\nReferences"
