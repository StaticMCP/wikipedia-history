Like other European warmblood breeds, it is a performance breed: any suitable horse of any origin may be admitted if it passes a strict performance test. Hanoverian, Holsteiner, Swedish Warmblood and Trakehner are among those that have contributed to the breed.\nHistory\nThe Danish Warmblood came into existence in 1962 with the formation of a breed society, the ; in 1979 this merged with another association, the , to form the present association, Dansk Varmblod. The first volume of the stud-book was published in 1964, and listed 150 mares. Most were imported from outside Denmark – more than 100 were of German breeding – and of the 22 born in Denmark the majority were of Oldenburger origin.\nCharacteristics\nThe horses usually stand some  at the withers. The coat may be of any solid colour; bay is the most common, but chestnut, grey and dark bay also occur. Limited white markings may be present.\nFile:WPT2013-CDI4-Sayn-Wittgenstein,Nathalie zu-Fabienne-2.JPG|Nathalie zu Sayn-Wittgenstein on Fabienne at the Internationales Pfingstturnier Wiesbaden in 2013\nFile:2018FEI-WORLD-CUP-DRESSAGE-Edward-Gal.jpg|Edward Gal on Glock's Zonik N.O.P. at the FEI Dressage World Cup in 2018\nReferences\n.
