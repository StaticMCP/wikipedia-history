There are various established orders for giving these, e.g. from the Ministry of Justice, Debrett's, and A & C Black's Titles and Forms of Address, which are generally in close agreement.\nBaronet or Esquire\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are two schools of thought as to how these should be ordered within each category: A & C Black's Titles and Forms of Address states that \"As a general rule, letters should be shown in the order of the foundation of the societies, etc.\" Contrary to this, Debrett's consider that within learned societies: \"There is no recognised order for placing these letters. In practice, where one society is indisputably of greater importance than another the letters are usually placed in that order.\" This has been deleted from the current advice.}} Similarly, for professional institutions: \"[T]here is no recognised order for placing qualifications awarded by different bodies, a recipient usually places these letters on headed paper, business cards, etc, in order of importance to his particular profession.\"\nThere is no clear distinction between a learned society and a professional institute. With regard to Royal Academicians, Debrett's says: \"Although Royal Academicians come second in this list, it is not suggested that they yield in precedence to fellows of learned societies. In practice, the two lists do not coincide.\"\nBlack's notes that where a professional body or society has multiple grades of membership, only the highest is used except in professional correspondence, and that fellowships \"election to which is a distinction\" (e.g. FRS, RSA, RA, FBA) should be used on all correspondence, whereas initials only indicating support for a society are limited to correspondence on matters of interest to that society. Initials can also be used in professional contexts to indicate expertise. Debrett's also distinguishes between initials issued as an honour, and those available as a subscription, with only the former normally being used in social correspondence. The former include fellowships of \"principal learned societies\", including, in order of foundation, FRS, FSA, FRSE, FRSL and FBA.\nIn this table, all societies, institutions, etc. are listed alphabetically by substantive name, rather than attempting to establish an order of precedence.\nSome post-nominals (and associated professional titles) are protected as \"Professions Regulated by Professional Bodies Incorporated by Royal Charter\" under the European professional qualification directives. These are indicated with an asterisk (e.g. CEng*).\nMemberships and fellowships of the various medical Royal Colleges are listed post-nominally as medical qualifications (see the previous section) rather than with professional bodies and learned societies.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |British Academy\n|-\n| Fellow of the British Academy|| FBA\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Learned

rank in the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Marines. To differentiate between the branches, post-nominals such as \"RN\" are used. However, such post-nominals are not used for the higher positions, since the higher officers are differently-titled in each branch.\nThis is the last set of post-nominals given by the Ministry of
