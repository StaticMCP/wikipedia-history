One troop of chimpanzees may exhibit a learned behavior unique from another troop of chimpanzees, such as various tool usage.  Some chimpanzee troops have been observed consuming aspilia, for medicinal purposes, because it has been seen to remove intestinal parasites, and is otherwise unpalatable.\nReferences"
