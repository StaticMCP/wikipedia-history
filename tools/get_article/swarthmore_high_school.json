In 1971 the Swarthmore-Rutledge District merged with adjacent Nether Providence School District to create the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District.\nAfter Pennsylvania state officials determined that Swarthmore was too small for its own secondary schools, Swarthmore High School merged with Nether Providence High School in Wallingford to form Strath Haven High School in the fall of 1983. The merged school was and still is based at the former Nether Providence campus.\nThe building that was Swarthmore High School is now the Swarthmore-Rutledge School, an elementary school in the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District.\nNotable alumni\n*Edmund N.
