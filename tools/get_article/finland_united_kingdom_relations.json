Bilaterally the two countries have a mutual defence agreement, and a strategic partnership agreement. The United Kingdom recognised the independence of Finland on 6 May 1919. Diplomatic relations had been established earlier, on 28 March 1918.\nHistory\nThe Kingdom of Sweden 1100-1809\nThe rule of the Kingdom of Sweden became established in Finland from the 12th century onward. The territory of Finland was organised into Swedish provinces, and the region was referred to as the \"Eastern Land.\"\nThomas, the third or fourth bishop of Finland, was possibly English. The Treaty of Nöteborg established fixed borders between Sweden and Russia.\nIn 1654, Sweden and the Kingdom of England concluded a commercial treaty that guaranteed free trade and shipping between the two countries. The agreement permitted the subjects and inhabitants of both nations to travel safely and freely in each other's territories, engage in trade and commerce without restrictions, and freely import and export goods while paying the customary duties. This treaty was aimed at removing obstacles to navigation and commerce, assuring mutual liberty of trade, and promoting friendly relations based on equal treatment and observance of each nation's laws concerning trade. It was signed on April 11, 1654, in Uppsala and marked a significant step in establishing a free trade and shipping alliance between Sweden and Great Britain during that period.'s Finland in a storm on the North Sea. ]]In the 17th century, coastal towns on the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland - such as Turku, Vyborg, Kokkola, and Oulu - exported timber, sawn wood, and tar to England.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Sweden used the Pool of London and various Thames River wharves for trade, as the formal large-scale dock systems like Surrey Commercial Docks were either nascent or focused on other specific trades.\nIn the 17th century, Scottish soldiers migrated to Sweden and served in the ranks of the Swedish army. Well-known Finnish families of Scottish descent include the Ramsay and von Wright families. Scotland also sent merchants to Finland such as Wolff and Affleck families, who engaged in trade and industry in Turku and Vyborg.\nSweden rose to become a European great power in the 17th century, and this also meant that members of the Finnish nobility undertook study trips abroad. The Finnish Baron Gabriel Kurck graduated with a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Oxford in 1654.\nWith the outbreak of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, relations between Sweden and the United Kingdom grew closer. King Gustav III of Sweden sent the Finnish Baron August Philip Armfelt on an extended visit to Britain in 1790 and 1791. Armfelt's travels came to an end after the assassination of Gustav III.\nNavy officer Sidney Smith, who later became an Admiral in the Royal Navy, participated in the second Battle of Svensksund in 1790, serving in the ranks of the Swedish Navy against the Russian fleet. The naval engagement took place off the coast of what is now the city of Kotka.\nSweden refused to take part in the Continental Blockade against the United Kingdom. Napoleon of France and Emperor Alexander I of Russia launched a two-front war against Sweden. Napoleon attacked via Denmark and Norway, while Alexander I invaded Finland. Russia occupied Finland during the Finnish War of 1808–1809.\nGustaf Mauritz Armfelt, President of the Swedish War Collegium, foresaw in 1810 that a war would erupt between France and Russia. Armfelt sent a letter to the British Foreign Secretary, Richard Colley Wellesley, in which he outlined a plan to create an independent Finland with the support of Sweden and the United Kingdom during the upcoming conflict. Armfelt received no reply from Wellesley.\nThe Grand Duchy of Finland 1809-1917\nRussia's Emperor Alexander I made Finland an autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809. Finland was allowed to retain the legislation and social system from the Swedish period.\nAs part of the Russian Empire, Finland did not have an independent foreign policy and was obliged to follow Russia's official foreign policy. In 1812, war broke out between Napoleonic France and Russia. Finnish soldiers and officers volunteered for the Russian army. Russia occupied Paris in 1814, and among the occupying forces were Finns.\n's factory. Tampere is \"the Manchester of Finland\". ]]\nJames Finlayson, a Scottish-born resident of Saint Petersburg, observed during his visit to Finland that the Tammerkoski rapids in Tampere offered abundant untapped water power. Granted burgher rights by the Emperor Alexander I, Finlayson relocated to Tampere, where in 1820 he established a machine workshop and foundry to manufacture carding and spinning machines. In 1823, he shifted his focus to the textile industry, and from 1828 onwards, the enterprise began to flourish when the mills gained access to imported cotton. Tampere subsequently became home to the largest textile industry in the Nordic countries, Finlayson became the largest company in the Nordics, and Tampere became the leading industrial city in Finland, earning it the nickname “the Manchester of Finland.\"\nRussia initiated a war against the Ottoman Empire in 1853. The objective of Russia was to gain wider control over the Black Sea coastline and to establish a stronger foothold at the Bosporus Strait. The United Kingdom and France came to the support of the Ottoman Empire. The Crimean War expanded to the Baltic Sea in 1854, as the United Kingdom and French fleets advanced toward Saint Petersburg, the capital of the empire. Their aim was to restrict the movement of the Russian navy along the coasts of Finland and Estonia, destroy Russian ships, disrupt supply routes, and exert pressure on Russia by blockading the city of Saint Petersburg. The Russian fleet was consequently moved behind the fortifications of Kronstadt and Suomenlinna for protection. British and French forces attacked Finnish towns and fortresses, destroying cities, ports, shipyards, vessels, and warehouses. The Åland War concluded when Emperor Alexander II decided to make peace in 1856.\nThe Åland War had significant adverse effects on Finland's economy, as merchant ships, ports, shipyards, and grain warehouses were destroyed during the war. The attacks on civilian targets were, in their own way, one of the reasons why Finland later experienced famine.\n, Finland. The oldest photo of railways in Finland.]]\nThe first locomotives in Finland were ordered from the English engineering works Canada Works, owned by Morton Peto, Thomas Brassey, and Edward Betts. The first four engines of the series arrived in parts in Finland already in the autumn of 1860, after which they were assembled and made operational at the Helsinki Railway Workshop. Since the railway was a new phenomenon in Finland, the locomotives were accompanied by English locomotive drivers T. Lawson and W. Frost, who trained the country's first engine crews. Finland's first railway line was opened between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna in 1862.\nCount Alexander Armfelt, Finland's long-serving Minister-Secretary of State for Finland, studied at the University of Edinburgh during his youth.\nThe Finnish Seamen's Mission was established in 1875, following approval from the Imperial Senate of Finland. It was founded to support Finnish sailors abroad, but soon its services were also used by emigrants and other travelers. The first Finnish seamen's pastor was Elis Bergroth, a 25-year-old assistant priest at Porvoo Cathedral, who began his work in April 1880 in Grimsby. Bergroth undertook pastoral journeys to Kingston upon Hull, Liverpool, Goole, and London. The first Finnish Seamen's Church was built in London in 1894, followed by a second one in Hull in 1887.\nIn the 19th century, the British Empire became Finland's largest export market. Finland later had a commercial representative at the Russian Embassy in London, whose purpose was to monitor economic developments and relay information back to Finland. In Finland, prominent Finnish merchants, industrialists, and shipowners served as the United Kingdom's vice-consuls. Before the First World War, Britain had a dispatched consul in Finland.\nIn 1894, Russia and France concluded an alliance. In 1907, Russia joined the Triple Entente, which included the United Kingdom. The First World War broke out in 1914. Finnish officers and soldiers took part in the war against the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire - including Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim.\nThe Republic of Finland 1917-\nDuring the First World War large demonstrations began in Saint Petersburg in 1917. Emperor Nicholas II was forced to abdicate. After the February Revolution, the Russian Republic was established, governed by a bourgeois government. The October Communist Revolution overthrew the Russian Republic and created Soviet Russia in its place. Finland declared independence amid this turmoil in December 1917. A monarchy project was launched in Finland in 1918, but it failed. In 1919, Finland declared itself a republic.\nin London.]]\nRudolf Holsti served as the first official representative of independent Finland in London. During Holsti's tenure, the foundations were laid for Finland's future embassy in London. Ossian Donner served from autumn 1919 as the first ambassador of independent Finland in London.\nMannerheim served as Finland's second Regent and was a supporter of the Entente Cordiale. Finland's first President, Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg, focused on domestic political issues and relied on the views of Foreign Minister Rudolf Holsti. Holsti favored an alliance with the United Kingdom, but his idea did not gain broad support within the Finnish Parliament.\nThe United Kingdom recognised the independence of Finland on 6 May 1919. Diplomatic relations had been established earlier, on 28 March 1918. The British Embassy in Helsinki initially operated in the building of the Svenska Klubben (Swedish Club) in the Kruununhaka district of Helsinki between 1918 and 1926. The British Embassy in Helsinki moved to Kaivopuisto in 1926, where it remains to this day. The embassy is located in a villa designed by Jarl Eklund in 1918.\nBetween the First and Second World Wars, relations between Finland and the United Kingdom were close. The Royal Navy used Finnish ports when it destroyed Soviet ships at Kronstadt with torpedo boats. The operation was led by Admiral Walter Cowan.\nThe United Kingdom remained Finland's largest export market, and Finland purchased weapons from the United Kingdom. Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim served as Finland's official representative at the funeral of King George V. Mannerheim also maintained close relations with Winston Churchill.\nFinland adopted a policy of neutrality in 1935. Rudolf Holsti returned to the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1936. During Holsti's tenure, Finland moved closer to the United Kingdom and France, a course that displeased Nazi Germany. Holsti's public ridicule of Adolf Hitler led to his resignation from the ministerial post in 1938. He was succeeded by Eljas Erkko, who had previously served as a diplomat at Finland's embassy in London.\nIn 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland. During the Winter War, Churchill and the French Prime Minister planned to send troops to assist Finland. The troops were to pass through Norway and Sweden. Norway and Sweden refused the request, fearing reactions from Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The plan was then modified so that the troops would be volunteers. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin heard of the British and French plan, which accelerated peace negotiations. The Winter War ended in 1940, as a result of which Finland lost territory to the Soviet Union.\nAfter the Winter War, the situation in the Baltic Sea changed significantly. The Soviet Union occupied Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as part of Poland. Later, Nazi Germany occupied Denmark and Norway. Finland and Sweden were the only democratic countries on the shores of the Baltic Sea, while the other areas were under the control of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Finland sought to form a political union with Sweden, but Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union prevented the establishment of the union. Despite the peace, the Soviet Union continued to pressure Finland.\nFinland entered into cooperation with Nazi Germany, as it was the only means to obtain weapons and supplies to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union. The Germans were interested in the nickel deposits of Petsamo, which were of crucial importance for armament production.\nThe Continuation War broke out in 1941. Finland's objective was to regain the territories lost earlier, which it succeeded in doing during the course of the war. Winston Churchill understood Finland's decision, which is why he delayed declaring war against the country. He ultimately issued the declaration of war largely under Stalin's persistent pressure. Prior to the official announcement, Churchill had also warned Marshal Mannerheim in advance about the impending declaration. During the Continuation War, Finland's foreign policy leadership consisted of Anglophiles such as President Risto Ryti and Foreign Minister Henrik Ramsay. However, the conflict ended in Finland's defeat in 1944. The country was obliged to cede land and pay war reparations to the Soviet Union. At the insistence of the Soviet Union, Finland launched hostilities against German forces stationed in northern Finland, with Soviet troops participating in the campaign. The Lapland War was fought between 1944 and 1945 and concluded with a Finnish victory.\nFollowing the war, Finland came under the supervision of the Allied Control Commission, composed primarily of Soviet representatives and some British members. The British presence contributed to preventing the communists from gaining dominant political influence in Finland.\nPresident Juho Kusti Paasikivi expressed an interest in joining the Marshall Plan, but Soviet pressure prevented Finland's participation. Instead, Finland signed a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union in 1948. Despite this, the country preserved its democratic political system and market economy.\nThe Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, met President Paasikivi at the Presidential Palace during the Helsinki Summer Olympics in 1952.\nPresident Urho Kekkonen made an official state visit to the United Kingdom in 1961. Kekkonen met Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. Kekkonen made a second official state visit in 1969.\nIn 1961, Finland became an associate member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The United Kingdom once again became Finland's leading export destination; however, Britain's accession to the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973 resulted in new trade barriers between the two countries, causing the United Kingdom to lose its top position in Finnish exports by 1975.\nQueen Elizabeth II made two official state visits to Finland. The first was in May 1976, hosted by Finnish President Kekkonen. The second visit took place in 1994, hosted by President Martti Ahtisaari. These visits included notable events such as a stroll in a Finnish forest in 1976 and official dinners at the Presidential Palace and the President's summer residence.\nFinland became a member of the European Union in 1995. Finland and the United Kingdom frequently found common ground on economic affairs, internal markets, free trade, and security matters.\nThe United Kingdom also became a popular destination for Finnish university students pursuing their studies abroad.\nThe Duke of Gloucester, Prince Richard, and the Duchess of Gloucester, Birgitte, visited the University of Helsinki and the Helsinki City Hall in 2012.\nAmong the members of the British royal family, Prince Philip, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, Prince Richard, Duchess Birgitte, Prince William, Prince Edward, Duchess, Sophie, and Prince Michael have visited Finland.\nOn 31 March 2025, the President of the Republic of Finland, Alexander Stubb, undertook a working visit to London, aimed at strengthening bilateral relations between Finland and the United Kingdom. During the visit, President Stubb held talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, focusing on cooperation between the two countries. The discussions emphasized deepening political and economic ties, coordination within European security frameworks. President Stubb further noted Finland's welcome of Britain's increasing engagement with Europe following its departure from the European Union, highlighting shared interests in defense, trade, and research collaboration. Prior to his meeting with the Prime Minister, President Stubb gave an address at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) on global political transformations.\nSuzanne Innes-Stubb, the First Lady of the Republic of Finland, is of Scottish and English origin. She is the spouse of President Alexander Stubb, who assumed office in March 2024. Innes-Stubb's background reflects the close cultural and personal ties between Finland and the United Kingdom, particularly between Finland, Scotland, and England.\nDefence and security\nFinland joined the European Union in 1995 with the primary goal of fortifying its international position after the Cold War, transitioning from its historical neutrality and non-alignment to active participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).\nUntil Brexit, Finland and the United Kingdom actively cooperated in foreign, security, and defence policy within the European Union framework, focusing on adapting to the evolving common policies of the EU and leveraging their membership for national and regional security interests.\nThe Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) is a United Kingdom-led multinational military partnership formed for rapid response and expeditionary operations, primarily focused on Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea region. The JEF was officially launched as a NATO initiative at the 2014 NATO Wales Summit when seven countries - Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom - signed a foundational Letter of Intent to establish the force. Finland joined the JEF in the summer of 2017 alongside Sweden, expanding the membership to nine nations. In 2021, Iceland became the tenth member.\nSince 2022, Finland, along with Sweden, is in a mutual defence treaty with the United Kingdom. In 2022, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrived in Finland and granted Finland security assurances for the duration of its NATO membership process. In July 2022, the United Kingdom fully approved Finland's application for NATO membership.\nStrategic partnership\nThe Joint Declaration on the Strategic Partnership between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Finland, signed on 20 May 2024, establishes a framework to strengthen bilateral cooperation based on shared democratic values and historic ties. The declaration emphasizes collaboration within multilateral organisations such as NATO, the United Nations, and the European Political Community, reinforcing a commitment to a rules-based international order.\nThe partnership prioritizes joint support for Ukraine in response to Russia’s aggression, including military aid, economic assistance, and efforts to counter hybrid threats such as disinformation and cyberattacks. Security and defence cooperation is enhanced through NATO membership, the Joint Expeditionary Force, and collaboration on cyber defence, defence innovation, and intelligence sharing, focusing on the security of Northern Europe, the Arctic, and the Baltic Sea region.\nEconomic cooperation seeks to promote open trade and investment, focusing on emerging technologies including artificial intelligence, 6G communications, quantum computing, and critical minerals. The two countries coordinate on migration management, targeting irregular migration and organised crime through joint EU–UK efforts.\nIn environmental matters, the declaration commits to climate action aligned with the Paris Agreement, promoting renewable energy, biodiversity, and sustainable forest management, alongside collaboration on nuclear technologies such as Small Modular Reactors. Education, science, research, and innovation cooperation are also prioritized, with attention to academic exchange, research security, and intellectual property rights.\nThe declaration underscores fostering people-to-people links through enhanced mobility, cultural exchange, and cooperation in civil and family law. Governance of the partnership includes annual ministerial meetings and expert consultations, with the declaration expressing a political commitment that does not create legal obligations under international law.\nCulture\nAt the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, Finnish nobles established English-style landscaped gardens on their manor estates. Riilahti Manor possesses an original landscaped garden.\nFinnish merchant John von Julin founded Finland's first school in 1822 that used the Bell–Lancaster method. Professor Johan Henrik Avellan wrote Finland's first doctoral dissertation on the same teaching method in 1828.\nThe House of Nobility in Helsinki, completed in 1862, represents Gothic Revival architecture.\nThe English gentlemen's club culture arrived during the period of the Grand Duchy of Finland. During the 19th and 20th centuries, several clubs were founded. At that time, Handelsgillet i Helsingfors, the Finnish Club of Helsinki, Svenska Klubben, the Pamaus Society, and the Helsinki Bourse Club were established. Clubs were founded in major Finnish cities such as Helsinki and Vyborg.\nWilliam Shakespeare’s plays were an important part of theatrical programming in Finland during the 19th century, especially under the direction of Kaarlo Bergbom at the Finnish Theatre. During Bergbom's tenure, a total of 14 of Shakespeare's plays were staged, amounting to nearly half of his total output of 36 plays. Historical dramas in particular, such as Julius Caesar, attracted great attention and were revived well into the early 20th century. These productions featured crowd scenes that were impressive and visually striking, inspired by the Meiningen Court Theatre in Germany.\nThe Tempest premiered in Finnish only in the early 20th century, though it had been performed in a somewhat adapted form in the late 19th century. Other well-known Shakespeare works included Hamlet and Mary Stuart (the latter being a play by Friedrich Schiller, yet a classic of the same era). Shakespeare's plays were significant elements in the development of Finnish theatre and strengthened the theatre's role in building national culture.\nIn the late 19th century, a brothel named London operated in Helsinki and was well known.\nBritish popular culture arrived in Finland in the early 1900s. Finland's first film screening was held in June 1896, less than half a year after the Lumière brothers had introduced their invention in Paris. Films became a common pastime for the public in the 1910s. Most of the films were imported from Britain, the United States, and the Nordic countries.\nComposer Jean Sibelius had a significant connection with England, primarily through his visits and the reception of his music there. He first visited Britain in 1905, mainly to conduct his works. His longest stay was in London in 1909, where he lived for several weeks at 15 Gloucester Walk in Holland Park. During this time, he composed his only published string quartet, Voces Intimae. Sibelius was admired in Britain by notable figures such as the composer Granville Bantock and conductor Henry Wood.\nA blue plaque commemorating Jean Sibelius was erected in 1995 by English Heritage at 15 Gloucester Walk, Holland Park, London W8 4HZ, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.\nBusiness magnate Carl Wilhelm Rosenlew was a well-known Anglophile. He left behind a significant cultural heritage, namely Vanajanlinna Manor in Hämeenlinna, which served as his hunting lodge. In the architecture and lifestyle of Vanajanlinna, the style of an English manor house was pursued.\nJ.R.R. Tolkien was profoundly influenced by the Finnish language, Finland, and the Finnish national epic Kalevala in shaping his legendarium and invented languages. Tolkien admired the Finnish language for its phonetic beauty and structure, describing it as a \"complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine\" that intoxicated him.\nThe Beatles’ music was received in Finland with enthusiasm and speed; Finland was among the earliest countries where Beatlemania and the band's records gained popularity already in the autumn of 1963, before the United States. The Beatles craze was visible among youth in fashion, fan culture, and chart success, and the band's songs inspired wide attention and imitation in Finnish popular culture.\nFinland's cultural life has been influenced by British-origin figures such as Kim Brown, Raymond Ebanks, Richard Hall, Neil Hardwick, Herbert Lomas, William Markus, Paul Oxley, Frank Robson, Phyllis Sjöström, Ronya Stanley, and Kristiina Wheeler.\nAmong Finnish designers, the Honorary Royal Designer for Industry title has been awarded to Alvar Aalto, Yrjö Kukkapuro, Antti Nurmesniemi, Vuokko Nurmesniemi, Timo Sarpaneva, and Ilmari Tapiovaara.\nIn 2011, a memorial plaque for Professor Edward Westermarck was unveiled in London on Thursday, 15 December. The plaque was affixed to the outer wall of the University of London’s main building, Senate House.\nIn March 2017, the Finnish-British art history professor Tancred Borenius received a blue plaque in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.\nEsa-Pekka Salonen served as an artistic advisor, and the chief conductor of the London Philharmonia Orchestra from 2008 to 2021.\nBritish movies in Finland have a notable popularity. In 2024, British films accounted for 21 of the premieres in Finland, showing a solid presence in the market. British movies are regularly part of cinema offerings and streaming platforms like Netflix in Finland, with audiences appreciating British film styles, drama, and storytelling. English-language pop and rock - often including British artists - are popular among Finnish listeners. British pop and rock have strong cultural influence, especially among younger Finns interested in international music scenes.\nThe majority of Finns possess a strong command of the English language, with approximately 70% of the population able to speak English at a conversational level or higher, according to the most recent data from 2025. This figure equates to nearly 3.9 million people in Finland, making English the most widely spoken foreign language in the country. Less than 0.5% of Finns are native English speakers, but the language is highly integrated into public life and the education system.\nTrade\nTrade and investment relations between the United Kingdom and Finland have traditionally been robust, supported by a shared commitment to economic openness and the rules-based multilateral trading system. In the twelve months ending March 2025, total trade in goods and services between the UK and Finland reached £6.1 billion. During this period, UK exports to Finland amounted to £3.1 billion, consisting of £1.3 billion in goods and £1.8 billion in services. Imports from Finland to the UK were valued at £3.0 billion, with goods comprising £2.2 billion and services £769 million. The UK maintained a trade surplus of £108 million overall, most notably a surplus in services, while maintaining a small deficit in goods trade with Finland.\nRecent years have seen collaboration focus on technology, sustainability, and digitalisation. Notably, both countries cooperate in fields such as 5G and 6G communications, healthcare technologies, environmental goods, energy solutions, and critical national infrastructure. This bilateral engagement is reinforced through government partnerships and business networks aimed at increasing investment volumes and fostering innovation in key sectors such as medtech, clean energy, artificial intelligence, and communication networks.\nForeign direct investment (FDI) constitutes a significant component of the economic relationship. At the end of 2023, Finland's FDI stock in the UK was £615 million. Both countries actively pursue strategic investment opportunities, particularly related to advanced technologies, renewable energy, and critical minerals, recognizing their importance for future economic security and competitiveness.\nPrince Michael of Kent visited Finland in 2017 and 2022. During his visits, he promoted trade and investment between the United Kingdom and Finland.\nDiplomatic missions\n* Embassy of Finland in London.\n* United Kingdom has an embassy in Helsinki.\nSee also\n* Foreign relations of Finland\n* Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\nReferences"
