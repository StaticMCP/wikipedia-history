It marked the end of the \"Phoney War\" and the beginning of World War II in Western Europe.\nA German fleet led by the cruiser Blücher'' was dispatched up the Oslofjord to begin the German invasion of Norway, to seize the Norwegian capital of Oslo and capture King Haakon VII and his government. The fleet was engaged in the fjord by Oscarsborg Fortress, an aging coastal installation near Drøbak, that had been relegated to training coastal artillery servicemen, leading the Germans to disregard its defensive value. However, unbeknownst to German military intelligence, the fortress' most powerful weapon was a torpedo battery, which would be used to great effect against the German invaders.\nThe fortress' armaments worked flawlessly despite their age, sinking the Blücher in the sound and forcing the German fleet to fall back. The loss of the German flagship, which carried most of the troops and Gestapo agents intended to occupy Oslo, delayed the German occupation long enough for King Haakon VII and his government to escape from the capital.\nBefore the battle\nNorway\nOscarsborg Fortress was commanded by 64-year-old Oberst (Colonel) Birger Eriksen. He had not received clear orders and no information on whether the approaching warships were German or Allied. He knew that Norway was officially neutral but that the government was inclined to side with the British if Norway became a belligerent.\nThe fortress' main command station and battery were on Håøya island north-west of South Kaholmen (.) Due to the unique circumstances in 1940, Eriksen commanded from the backup station at South Kaholmen, east of the main battery.\nApart from the officers and NCOs, most of the remaining garrison consisted of 450 fresh troops conscripted on 2 April. The naval mines were not deployed; deployment was scheduled for a few days after 9 April as a recruit training exercise.\nThe main battery consisted of three  Krupp guns called Moses, Aron and Josva. There were enough trained gunners for one gun. They were split between two guns and assisted by non-combatant privates, including cooks. All the guns were loaded with live high-explosive shells.\nThe fortress' torpedo battery was armed with 40-year-old Austro-Hungarian Whitehead torpedoes. The weapons had been practice-launched over 200 times; despite doubts they functioned properly during the battle. The battery had three launch tunnels opening  below the surface. There were six torpedoes ready to launch, and another three as reloads.\nThe torpedo battery was commanded by Kommandørkaptein (Commander Senior Grade) , who lived in Drøbak. He was a temporary substitute for the commanding officer who went on sick leave in March 1940. Late on 8 April, during the action in the Oslofjord, Eriksen ordered Anderssen to the battery; Anderssen donned his old uniform and was transported across the fjord to the battery by boat. Anderssen was familiar with the post; he first served at the battery in 1909 and was its commander by the time he retired in 1927. Anderssen was recalled to active duty in March.\nGermany\nThe objective of the German naval force was to capture the Norwegian capital, Oslo, King Haakon VII, and the Norwegian government. It was led by the cruiser Blücher, a new warship with an inexperienced crew. Those onboard included Generalmajor Erwin Engelbrecht, Admiral Oskar Kummetz and a special unit for capturing the king.\nThe Germans underestimated the operational value of the Norwegian coastal fortifications; the fortifications were old and used for training. The Germans did not know of the Oscarsborg torpedo battery.\nBattle\n, the commander of Oscarsborg, 9 April 1940]]\nand the fortress of Oscarsborg]]\nThe main battery fires\nmain battery guns at Oscarsborg]]\nAt 4:21 a.m. on 9 April, Eriksen ordered the main battery to fire on Blücher, the lead ship of the German flotilla heading to Oslo. When his order was questioned, Eriksen replied: \"Either I will be decorated or I will be court-martialled. Fire!\" Firing without warning shots violated the pre-war Norwegian rules of engagement. The German ships had already received warning and live shots from outlying fortifications; Erikson later used this to justify his decision to consider the ships to be hostile.\nTwo guns, Moses and Aron, each fired one  high-explosive shell. The first shell struck the front of the mainmast and set the midship area up to the fore mast on fire; this detonated a magazine containing stores for the Arado Ar 196 reconnaissance floatplanes – oil cans, smoke dispensers, incendiary bombs, aircraft bombs and depth charges. Shortly after the first hit, the second shell hit the base of one of the forward  gun turrets, throwing debris from it overboard and igniting further fires; this put the ship's main guns out of action by disabling their electrical power. The unmanned third gun, Josva, was not fired. No further shells were fired; the guns could not be reloaded in time with the untrained gunners.\nThe secondary batteries fire\nNext, the secondary Norwegian coastal batteries opened fire on Blücher. The weapons ranged from two small  guns at Husvik, intended to protect the fortress' missing mine barrier, to the three  guns of the Kopås Battery on the eastern side of the fjord. The 57&nbsp;mm guns targeted the cruiser's superstructure and anti-aircraft (AA) weapons, and partially suppressed German return fire. Blücher continued to sail slowly northward. It passed close enough to fire on the Husvik battery with light AA guns. The Norwegians abandoned Husvik; its main building caught fire but there were no casualties. In all, the cruiser was hit by thirteen 15&nbsp;cm and around thirty 57&nbsp;mm shells. One 15&nbsp;cm hit from Kopås disabled the steering gear; the ship avoided grounding by steering with its engines. Shell fragments disabled the firefighting system.\nThe fortress' gun batteries had been in action for only five to seven minutes. Return fire from Blüchers light battery was ineffective due to excessive elevation.\nAt this point, Germans voices on the cruiser became audible to the Norwegians, alerting the latter of their opponent's identity; according to the Norwegians, the Germans began to sing Deutschlandlied, the German national anthem. The Norwegian minesweeper HNoMS Otra had identified the intruders as Germans earlier and communicated this to the Horten naval base at 04:10. Norwegian communications problems delayed its delivery to Oscarsborg; Eriksen received it at 04:35.  There was then \"a dead silence on board the whole ship, no movement whatsoever was identified\".\nThe torpedo battery fires\nBlücher was crippled but remained afloat. It continued to move north, which brought it within  of Oscarsborg's torpedo battery. Anderssen fired the first torpedo at about 04:30. The target's speed was slightly overestimated, and the torpedo struck near the ship's forward turret and caused inconsequential damage. The aim was corrected for the second torpedo; it struck amidship in the same area as the first 28&nbsp;cm shell hit. The hit disabled the engines, blew open bulkheads and caused flooding. The ship continued to burn.\nThe fortress' third torpedo tube was not fired in case of further targets. The other tubes were reloaded.\nBlücher sinks\n]]\nBlücher anchored near the Askholmene islets just north and out of the field of fire of the fort's guns. The crew attempted to fight the uncontrolled fires. Torpedoes were fired to prevent their detonation by the fires. At 05:30, the fires detonated a midship magazine for the  Flak guns, blowing a hole in the ship's side ruptured the bulkheads between the boiler rooms, and caused further fires by opening fuel tanks.\nBlücher sank bow-first at 06:22, capsizing to port. Two thousand German sailors and soldiers were in the freezing water. Hundreds died when floating fuel oil caught fire.\nApproximately 1,400 Germans survived and 650–800 died. 1,200 came ashore at Frogn near Drøbak.  550 were captured by His Majesty the King's Guard, 4th Company, commanded by Kaptein (Captain) A. J. T. Petersson. The guardsmen were supposed to take all the Germans prisoner, but mainly focused on treating casualties. Around 1,000 Germans, including Engelbrecht and Kummetz, were eventually moved to a nearby farm and placed under light guard. The prisoners were not interrogated, and were effectively freed when the Norwegians withdrew by 18:30. Engelbrecht and Kummetz reached Oslo at 22:00, establishing themselves in the Hotel Continental, and occupying the capital with their remaining troops. Norwegian wounded and many German wounded were treated by the Royal Norwegian Navy Hospital at the Asgården summer hotel in Åsgårdstrand; the hospital had been evacuated from Horten at midnight on 8 April.\nRemaining ships retreat\nWhen Blücher was hit by the torpedoes, the commander of the heavy cruiser Lützow – unaware of the torpedo battery – assumed the presence of mines. At 4 h 40, the Germans decided to withdraw and land their troops out of range of the Oscarsborg guns. The attack on Oslo would continue by a landward advance up the Oslofjord.\nThe retreating Lützow was hit by three 15&nbsp;cm shells from the Kopås battery, which disabled the cruiser's forward 28&nbsp;cm turret. Kopås continued to fire until the German ships disappeared into the mist at a range of around . Lützows aft turret bombarded the Norwegians from a range of  down the fjord.\nThe first Norwegian civilian ship lost during the invasion, the  Norwegian cargo cutter , was sunk during the battle. Sørland was carrying paper from Moss to Oslo when it stumbled into the battle, which it thought was an exercise. It was attacked and set on fire by the German minesweepers R-18 and R-19 and sank near Skiphelle in Drøbak with the loss of two of its six crew. The burning ship was misidentified by the Norwegians as the German training ship . The real Brummer was lost in connection with the invasion. It was torpedoed on 14 April by the Royal Navy submarine  while returning to Germany and sank the next day.\nLuftwaffe bombing\nThe fortress was heavily bombed for nearly nine hours by the Luftwaffe later that day. The fortress' AA weapons were two Bofors 40 mm L/60 cannon, three Colt M/29  machine guns at the Seiersten Battery, four Colt M/29 7.92&nbsp;mm machine guns at the main battery, and four machine guns at the main battery. There were no Norwegian casualties, but the main battery machine guns were abandoned early on. One Bofors became unserviceable after only 22 rounds; the other kept firing - to little effect - until 12:00 when the air attacks paused. Lützow bombarded Hovedøya until 13:30 when the air attacks resumed with bombers strafing the Norwegian AA guns. Around 14:00, the guns went out of action when their crews took cover in the nearby forest.\nThe air attacks included 22 long-range Junkers Ju 87R \"Stuka\" dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 1, commanded by Hauptmann Paul-Werner Hozzel, operating from Kiel-Holtenau airport in northern Germany. Around 500 bombs — ranging from  in size — were dropped.\nSurrender\nThe Norwegian situation continued to deteriorate. The Germans took Oslo later in the day with troops airlifted into Fornebu Airport, and additional landings occurred at the village of Son south of Drøbak. Eriksen decided that there was inadequate infantry to continue fighting. He agreed to a ceasefire on the evening of 9 April and surrendered the fortress intact on the morning of 10 April.\nThe garrison went into captivity. The enlisted and NCOs of the secondary batteries were released three days later; those of the main battery a week later. The officers were initially taken to Fredriksten Fortress, with the reservists being released on 15 May. Regular officers were moved again to the Grini detention camp and released in late May 1940.\nAftermath\nThe destruction of Blücher by the Oscarsborg Fortress and the withdrawal of the German naval force caused a significant delay in the German capture of Oslo. The delay allowed King Haakon VII, Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold's government, the parliament, and the gold reserve to be evacuated. As the Norwegians retreated, the government was granted wartime emergency powers by the king and parliament; the affirmations included the Elverum Authorization of 9 April. The government maintained this legitimacy when it became a government-in-exile in the United Kingdom on 7 June shortly before the Norwegian Army surrendered on 10 June.\nMedia adaptation\nThe battle is depicted in the 2016 feature film ''The King's Choice and the 2025 Norwegian historical war film The Battle of Oslo, by Daniel Fahre.\nSee also\n* List of Norwegian military equipment of World War II\n* List of German military equipment of World War II\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*Binder, Frank & Schlünz Hans Hermann: Schwerer Kreuzer Blücher, Koehlers Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Hamburg 2001\n*\n*\n*|italic=unset}} (to be quoted as Fjeld2 1999)\n*\n*|italic=unset}}\n*\n*\n*|italic=unset}}\n*|italic=unset}}\n*\n*\n*Williamson, Gordon: German Heavy Cruisers 1939–45'', Osprey Publishing Ltd., Oxford 2003\nExternal links\n*[http://www.forsvaretsmuseer.no/Oscarsborg Oscarsborg Fortress Museum official website]\n*[http://www.akershus.com/en/Follo/product/?TLp=180567&Oscarsborg-Fortress= Oscarsborg Fortress website]\n*[http://www.oscarsborg.no Website on the fortress]\n*[https://www.forsvarsbygg.no/contentassets/f5fe5db8478843a9bb89cdfabe6d6156/oscarsborg-festningsloype-engelsk_2013.pdf Oscarsborg Fortress, map] Norwegian Defence Estates Agency\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120119055430/http://www.festningsverk.no/oscarsborg3.htm Oscarsborg Museum – history of the fortress]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130323063435/http://mil.no/culture-attractions/museums/oscarsborgfortress/Pages/default.aspx Norwegian Armed Forces website page about the fortress]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070321163034/http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/verdenskrig/article449062.ece 50 year anniversary Aftenposten newspaper article on the invasion of Norway]"
