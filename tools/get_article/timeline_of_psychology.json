In his model he used four elements (water, fire, earth, air) and four seasons to derive diversity of natural systems.\n* 490–421 Protagoras\n* 470–399 Socrates – Socrates has been called the father of western philosophy, if only via his influence on Plato and Aristotle. Socrates made a major contribution to pedagogy via his dialectical method and to epistemology via his definition of true knowledge as true belief buttressed by some rational justification.\n* 470–370 Democritus – Democritus distinguished between insufficient knowledge gained through the senses and legitimate knowledge gained through the intellect—an early stance on epistemology.\n* 460&nbsp;BC – 370&nbsp;BCE – Hippocrates introduced principles of scientific medicine based upon naturalistic observation and logic, and denied the influence of spirits and demons in diseases. Introduced the concept of \"temperamentum\"(\"mixture\", i.e. 4 temperament types based on a ratio between chemical bodily systems. Hippocrates was among the first physicians to argue that brain, and not the heart is the organ of psychic processes.\n* 387&nbsp;BCE – Plato suggested that the brain is the seat of mental processes. Plato's view of the \"soul\" (self) is that the body exists to serve the soul: \"God created the soul before the body and gave it precedence both in time and value, and made it the dominating and controlling partner.\" from Timaeus\n* c. 350&nbsp;BCE – Aristotle wrote on the psuchê (soul) in De Anima, first mentioning the tabula rasa concept of the mind.\n* c. 340&nbsp;BCE – Praxagoras\n* 371–288 Theophrastus\n* 341–270 Epicurus\n* c. 320 Herophilus\n* c. 300–30 Zeno of Citium taught the philosophy of Stoicism, involving logic and ethics. In logic, he distinguished between imperfect knowledge offered by the senses and superior knowledge offered by reason. In ethics, he taught that virtue lay in reason and vice in rejection of reason. Stoicism inspired Aaron Beck to introduce cognitive behavioral therapy in the 1970s.\n* 304–250 Erasistratus\n* 123–43&nbsp;BCE – Themison of Laodicea was a pupil of Asclepiades of Bithynia and founded a school of medical thought known as \"methodism.\" He was criticized by Soranus for his cruel handling of mental patients. Among his prescriptions were darkness, restraint by chains, and deprivation of food and drink.

The term insania, insanity, was first used by him. The methods of treatment included bleeding, frightening the patient, emetics, enemas, total darkness, and decoctions of poppy or henbane, and pleasant ones such as music therapy, travel, sport, reading aloud, and massage. He was aware of the importance of the doctor-patient relationship.\n* c. 100 – Rufus of Ephesus believed that the nervous system was instrumental in voluntary movement and sensation. He discovered the optic chiasma by anatomical studies of the brain. He stressed taking a history of both physical and mental disorders. He gave a detailed account of melancholia, and was quoted by Galen.\n* 93–138 – Soranus of Ephesus advised kind treatment in healthy and comfortable conditions, including light, warm rooms.\n* c. 130–200 – Galen \"was schooled in all the psychological systems of the day: Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, and Epicurean\" He advanced medicine by offering anatomic investigations and was a skilled physician. Galen developed further the theory of temperaments suggested by Hippocrates, that people's characters were determined by the balance among four bodily substances. He also distinguished sensory from motor nerves and showed that the brain controls the muscles.\n* c. 150–200 – Aretaeus of Cappadocia\n* 155–220 Tertullian\n* 205–270 Plotinus wrote Enneads a systematic account of Neoplatonist philosophy, also nature of visual perception and how memory might work.\n* c. 323–403 – Oribasius compiled medical writings based on the works of Aristotle, Asclepiades, and Soranus of Ephesus, and wrote on melancholia in Galenic terms.\n* 345–399 – Evagrius Ponticus described a rigorous way of introspection within the early Christian monastic tradition. Through introspection, monks could acquire self-knowledge and control their stream of thought which signified potentially demonic influences.

Anger may be \"powerful in motivating people to get involved\" and to overcome degrees of apathy.\n** 2020s – Research investigates how well-being could objectively or effectively be measured for health and ecological economics.\n* 2020s – Accumulating and substantially more sophisticated research, often using large biological datasets, investigate the links of probiotics and mental health (psychobiotics) and potential interventions, the links of nutrition and mental health (nutrition psychology) and potential recommendations or interventions, and neurobiological effects of physical exercise that affect mental health. Moreover, research increasingly begins to investigate potential interventions or modifyable factors in brain aging.\n* 2020s – Research investigates challenges of manipulative choice architectures, false and misleading information and distracting environments and respective potential interventions.\n* 2020s – In the new field of neuromarketing, consumers are manipulated with insights from neuroscience and psychology to lead consumer decision making and behavior.\n;2020\n* June – Scientists reporting the discovery of Aguada Fénix put forward a theory of cognitive archaeology whereby communal work of such large projects was important in the initial development of the Maya civilization.\n* November – The first whole-genome comparison between chimpanzees and bonobos is published and shows genomic aspects that may underlie or have resulted from their divergence and behavioral differences, including selection for genes related to diet and hormones.\n;2021\n* July – A study reports that adolescent loneliness in contemporary schools and depression increased substantially and consistently worldwide after 2012.\n* September – Psychologist and behavior geneticist Kathryn Paige Harden publishes The Genetic Lottery: Why DNA Matters for Social Equality, an argument for using genetics to create a just society – including in terms of psychology-related predispositions, similar to a bioethical argument made by Papaioannou in 2013.\n* October – The American Psychological Association releases guidelines for the optimal use of social media in professional psychological practice.\n* December – In applied behavioural science, \"megastudies\" as meta-analyses are proposed and demonstrated for investigating the efficacy of many different interventions designed in an interdisciplinary manner by separate teams, e.g. to inform policy.\n;2022\n* July – A deep learning system that learns intuitive fundamental physics from visual data (of virtual 3D environments) that is based on the violation-of-expectation theory of visual cognition in infants is reported.\n*November – A study reports estimated contemporary prevalence and psychological associations with belief in witchcraft around the world, which (in their data) varied between 9% and 90% between nations and is still a widespread element in worldviews globally. It for example shows associations with low \"innovative activity\", \"weak institutions\", lower life expectancy, lower life satisfaction and high religiosity.\n*November – A study delivers a potential explanation-component for why learning is often more efficient in children beyond the higher level of neuroplasticity.\n;2023\n* February – A study hypothesizes mental health awareness efforts (in current forms) or increasingly glamorised and romanticised mental disorders on social media (e.g. quotes about depression on aesthetically appealing backgrounds shared more widely on certain social media – especially TikTok) may  to the recent substantial rise in reported mental health problems by intensifying and over-diagnosing of such. Around 2023, the rapid rise of TikTok prompts extensive research into potential harmful effects of such apps such as higher levels of mental problems correlating with higher levels of usage or addictive elements of this and similar apps.\n* March – Bioengineers  can induce anxiety, in specific altered heart rate by itself in risky contexts, after earlier studies also implicated immune system elements.\n* April – The first review of interventions against false conspiracy beliefs is published, indicating interventions \"that fostered an analytical mindset or taught critical thinking skills\" are most effective and that preventive action is important.\n*June – A time-use study provides the first comprehensive bird's-eye view, with a \"global human day\" , of what humans currently spend their time on.\nSee also\n* Timeline of psychiatry\n* Timeline of sociology\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://allpsych.com/timeline.html AllPsyc Online]\n* [http://www.feministvoices.com/past-timeline/ Timeline of women and psychology: 1848–1950]\n* [http://www.feministvoices.com/presence-timeline/ Timeline of women and psychology: 1950–present]"
