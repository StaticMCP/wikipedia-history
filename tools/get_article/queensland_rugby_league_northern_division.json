All finals matches are played at Barlow Park.\nCairns is represented in the Queensland Cup and Mal Meninga Cup (Under 18's) state leagues by the Northern Pride. The competition was renamed the Far North Queensland Rugby League in 2020.\nThe region's representative teams are known as the Marlins.\nMackay & District Rugby League\nThe Mackay & District Rugby League runs an eight club senior competition of three grades, A-Grade, reserve grade and colts (under 18's) and selects representative sides also represented in the Queensland Cup and Mal Meninga Cup (Under 18's) state leagues by the Mackay Cutters.\nThe region's representative teams are known as the Sea Eagles.\nMid West Rugby League\nThe Mid West Rugby League is a competition played North Western Queensland, Australia under the auspices of the Queensland Rugby League Northern Division.\nThe league features six clubs and runs an A-Grade competition for both Men and Women, as well as Junior competitions in the Under 9s, 12s and 16s grades. Uniquely, rounds are played as \"musters\", where all teams travel to one location for the entire round of games due to the vast travel distances and low population density of the area. This model has since been adopted by other competitions including the Western Riverina Community Cup and Mid West Cup in neighbouring New South Wales.\nClubs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:left\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Mid West Rugby League\n|-\n! style=\"background:white\" |Colours\n! style=\"background:white\" |Club\n! style=\"background:white\" |Established\n! style=\"background:white\" |Home ground(s)\n! style=\"background:white\" |No. of A-Grade\nPremierships\n! style=\"background:white\" |A-Grade\nPremiership Years\n|-\n|\n|Cloncurry Eagles\n|\n|Cloncurry Sports Ground\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Doomadgee Dragons\n|\n|Doomadgee Sports Ground\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Hughenden Eagles\n|\n|Hughenden Sports Ground\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Julia Creek Saints\n|\n|Julia Creek Sports Ground\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Normanton Stingers\n|\n|Normanton Sports Ground\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Richmond Tigers\n|\n|Richmond Sports Ground\n|\n|\n|}\nRecent Premiers\n* 2023: Normanton\n* 2024: Normanton\n|expanded=Yes|headercss=background: maroon; font-size: 100%; width: 100%;|contentcss=text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 100%;}}\nJuniors\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n!Mid West JRL clubs\n|-\n|\n* Cloncurry\n* Hughenden\n* Julia Creek\n* Richmond\n* Normanton (juniors in recess)\n|}\nMount Isa Rugby League\nThe Mount Isa Rugby League is a competition played the vicinity of Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia under the auspices of the Queensland Rugby League Northern Division.\nFounded in 1929, the league features six clubs and runs competitions in grades from Under 6s-Under 12s and an A-Grade for both Men and Women, with three teams participating in the premier competition in both the Men's and Women's grades.\nTwo foundation clubs remain from the 1929 season, the Black Star Diehards and the Mount Isa Brothers.\nClubs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:left\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Mount Isa Rugby League\n|-\n! style=\"background:white\" |Colours\n! style=\"background:white\" |Club\n! style=\"background:white\" |Established\n! style=\"background:white\" |Home ground(s)\n! style=\"background:white\" |No. of A-Grade\nPremierships\n! style=\"background:white\" |A-Grade\nPremiership Years\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |A Grade\n|-\n|\n|Mount Isa Brothers\n|1929\n|Alec Inch Oval, Mount Isa\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Mount Isa Townies\n|\n|Alec Inch Oval, Mount Isa\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Mount Isa Wanderers\n|1953\n|Alec Inch Oval, Mount Isa\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" |Women's\n|-\n|\n|Black Star Diehards Mt Isa\n|1929\n|Alec Inch Oval, Mount Isa\n|20\n|1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1947, 1948, 1952, 1954, 1957, 1962, 1964, 1973, 1976, 1979, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, 2010 & 2013\n|-\n|\n|Cloncurry Eagles\n|\n|Cloncurry Showground\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Wranglers RLFC Mount Isa\n|\n|Alec Inch Oval, Mount Isa\n|\n|\n|}\nRecent Premiers\n* 2013: Black Star\n* 2014: Wanderers\n* 2015: Wanderers\n* 2016: Cloncurry\n* 2017: Townies\n* 2018: Townies\n* 2019: Townies\n* 2020: Wanderers\n* 2021: Cancelled due to COVID-19\n* 2022: Wanderers\n* 2023: Wanderers\n* 2024: Townies\n|expanded=Yes|headercss=background: maroon; font-size: 100%; width: 100%;|contentcss=text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 100%;}}\nRemote Areas Rugby League\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:left\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Remote Areas Rugby League\n|-\n! style=\"background:white\" |Colours\n! style=\"background:white\" |Club\n! style=\"background:white\" |Established\n! style=\"background:white\" |Home ground(s)\n! style=\"background:white\" |No. of A-Grade\nPremierships\n! style=\"background:white\" |A-Grade\nPremiership Years\n|-\n|\n|Aurukun Kang Kang\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Central Cape Suns\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Cooktown Crocs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Hope Vale Cockatoos\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Lockhart River Scorpions\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Mulga Tigers\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Napranum Bulldogs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Old Mapoon\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Pormpuraaw Crocs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Weipa Raiders\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Wujal Wujal Yindili\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Zenadth Kes RLFC\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nZenadth Kes Rugby League\n* Mulga Tigers\n* Suburbs\n* Roosters (est 2004)\n* Pioneer Knights (est 2004)\nTownsville District Rugby League\nThe Townsville District Rugby League runs an eight club senior competition of three grades: A-Grade, reserve grade, under 19's and colts (under 18's).\nThe league selects representative teams to compete in the yearly Foley Shield and Mal Meninga Cup (Under 18's) state league as the Townsville Stingers.\nMajor Venues\n* Barlow Park - Cairns (18,000 / 3,750 Grandstand seating)\n* BB Print Stadium - Mackay (12,000 / 1,050 Grandstand seating)\n* Jack Manski Oval - Townsville (4,000 / 250 Grandstand seating)\n* Queensland Country Bank Stadium - Townsville (25,000 / 25,000 Grandstand seating)\nSee also\n*Rugby league in Queensland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
