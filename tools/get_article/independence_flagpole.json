It is the highest flagpole in the country.\nHistory\nThe Independence Flagpole was the location where the Philippine flag was hoisted on July 4, 1946, when full independence was achieved from the United States. The flagpole was designed to be at  high but was damaged by Typhoon Angela (Rosing) in 1995 reducing the flagpole's height to just .\nRestoration\nPlans to restore the flagpole's original height was proposed in 2011 by the National Parks Development Committee (NPDC) of the Department of Tourism. The renovation project is one of the government body's commemorative projects for the 150th anniversary of Jose Rizal's birth. The NPDC requested funds and assistance from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for the project which later underwent a public bidding that amounted to .\nThe flagpole's structural integrity was reinforced and a mechanized pulley in lieu of the manual pulley was installed along with a marble base. The renovation project was implemented by the DPWH's Manila South Engineering District while the project contractor was AKH Construction. The material used for the new flagpole is Q345 steel. The steel and two cranes of the flag pole were both imported from Hong Kong. The flagpole's construction took less than a month and was finished in September 2013. The newer flagpole was divided into three segments. The old flagpole was moved to the Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite.\nThe project details of the flagpole restoration went viral and was a subject of controversy due to its price which critics found overpriced. There were also concerns regarding the structural integrity of the newer flagpole. The DPWH defended the project emphasizing the flag's historical value and assured the public that a structural analysis has been conducted. They also emphasized that the renovation project planned as early as since 2011 went through a bidding process and justified the cost citing the improvements then to be made for the flagpole.\nIn February 2016, another renovation work was commenced. The marble based was demolished and new lighting were installed at the flagpole's base. The contractor was G.F. Fabian Construction and the cost of the project was .\nSince October 2019 a monthly national flag raising ceremony has been held there every first Monday of the month, open to the public, echoing similar ceremonies in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and Santiago's Plaza de la Ciudadania.\nMarkers\nThe base of the Independence Flagpole contains the following markers:\nReferences"
