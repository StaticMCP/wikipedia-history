Fought at an altitude of , against overwhelming Chinese forces, the battle saw one of the greatest last stands, with Indian sources documenting more than 1400 Chinese casualties. Major Shaitan Singh, who led the defense, was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honor, for his extraordinary bravery. Several other decorations were awarded posthumously to many officers and soldiers of the company.October 1962, China launched a large-scale offensive against Republic of India in the disputed border areas of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh (then NEFA). The Indian Army, under-prepared and outnumbered, was tasked with defending these high-altitude regions. Rezang La, a pass located in the Chushul sector of Ladakh, became a key defense point as it guarded the vital airstrip at Chushul.\nThe defense of Rezang La was entrusted to the 13th Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, under the command of Major Shaitan Singh. The battalion was positioned on the barren, exposed ridges of the pass, without adequate artillery support or reinforcements.\nBattle\nDuring the Sino-Indian War in 1962, Rezang La was the site of the last stand of the Charlie \"C\" company of 13 Kumaon, consisting of 120 Indian soldiers. According to the official Indian history of the war, the Rezang La picket of Charlie company made up entire of Ahir from Ahirwal region was stationed at an elevation of , 11&nbsp;km south of the Spanggur Gap, on the same ridge line as Rezang La. Rezang La had the drawback that an intervening feature blocked artillery operation, so that the Indian infantry had to do without artillery cover.\nThe Indian side was led by Major Shaitan Singh, who perished in battle and posthumously won India's highest military decoration, the Param Vir Chakra, for his actions.\nThe Chinese employed human wave tactics, sending up to eight waves against the Indian troop positions. Eventually, the Indian position was overrun, and Indian troops were forced to withdraw to high mountain positions. After the conclusion of battle, their valor was recognized by the Chinese, who had covered the bodies of the Indian soldiers with blankets and even placed bayonets over them so that the makeshift covers did not fly off. This mark of respect is exceptional and atypical of practices of that time.\nBoth sides took overwhelming casualties, though both countries disagree over how many were killed. It is generally accepted 114 Indian soldiers out of a total of 120 lost their lives. However, Indian sources claim upwards of 1,300 Chinese troops were killed in Rezang La alone.\nAftermath\nThe defense by the Kumaon Regiment at Rezang La has been cited as an important moment in Indian military history. Major Shaitan Singh was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra for his leadership and actions during the battle. The engagement is sometimes described as a notable example of a last stand in modern warfare. As the fight at Rezang La went on concurrently, Battle of Gurung Hill took place, where both sides claimed victory. Battles of Rezang La and Gurung Hill were collectively known as Battle of Banggongluo in Chinese narrative.\nLegacy\n.]]\nThe Battle of Rezang La remains a symbol of Indian courage and determination. Memorials have been erected at Rezang La and at various places in India to commemorate the bravery of the soldiers who fought and died in the battle. Rezang La Memorial in  Chushul was constructed in 1963 to commemorate the Indian military.\nIn 2012, on the 50th anniversary of the battle, veterans and military historians gathered to pay tribute to the fallen soldiers, and the battle continues to be studied as a lesson in mountain warfare.\nHow can a man die better,\nthan facing fearful odds,\nfor the ashes of his fathers,\nand temples of his gods.\nThis inscription also appears on the Rezang La Memorial at Rewari.\nSee also\n* Battle of Bum La Pass\n* Battle of Walong\n* Battle of Gurung Hill\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*  }}\n* .\n* .\n*"
