This statistic is a somewhat deceiving indicator of political stability, however, because of the Dominican practice of promulgating a new constitution whenever an amendment is ratified. Although technically different from each other in some particular provisions, most new constitutions contained only minor modifications of those previously in effect. Sweeping constitutional innovations were relatively rare.\nA large number of constitutions do, however, reflect a fundamental lack of consensus on the rules that should govern the national political life. Most Dominican governments felt compelled upon taking office to write new constitutions that changed the rules to fit their own wishes. Not only did successive governments often strenuously disagree with their predecessors' policies and programs, but they often wholly rejected the institutional framework within which their predecessors had operated. Constitutionalism—loyalty to a stable set of governing principles and laws rather than to the person who promulgates them—became a matter of overriding importance in the Dominican Republic only after the death of Rafael Trujillo.\nDominicans historically had agreed that government should be representative and vaguely democratic, that there should be civil and political rights, separation of powers, and checks and balances. Beyond that, however, consensus broke down. The country had been alternately dominated throughout its history by two constitutional traditions, one relatively democratic and the other authoritarian. Rarely were there attempts to bridge the gap between these diametric opposites.\nThe current Constitution was promulgated on June 13, 2015.\nConstitutions through Trujillo\nThe first Dominican constitution was promulgated on November 6, 1844, immediately after the nation achieved independence from Haiti. It was a liberal document with many familiar elements—separation of powers, checks and balances, and a long list of basic rights. However, an authoritarian government replaced the country's liberal, democratic government during its first year. The new regime proceeded to write its own constitution. This second constitution considerably strengthened the executive, weakened the legislative and judicial branches, and gave the president widespread emergency powers, including the power to suspend basic rights and to rule by decree. After that, the country's governance often alternated between liberal and authoritarian constitutional systems.\nEven the dictator Rafael Trujillo always operated under the banner of constitutionalism. Under Trujillo, the legislature was simply a rubber stamp; the courts were not independent, and basic rights ceased to exist. He governed as a tyrant, unfettered by constitutional restrictions.\nConstitutions after Trujillo\nAfter Trujillo died in 1961, the constitution was amended to provide for new elections and to allow the transfer of power to an interim Council of State. Although promulgated as a new document, the 1962 constitution was a continuation of the Trujillo constitution, and it was thus unpopular.\nIn 1964, Juan Bosch's freely elected, social-democratic government drafted a new and far more liberal constitution. It separated church and state, put severe limits on the political activities of the armed forces, established a wide range of civil liberties, and restricted the rights of property relative to individual rights. These provisions frightened the more conservative elements in Dominican society, which banded together to oust Bosch and his constitution in September 1963. Subsequently, the more conservative 1962 constitution was restored. In the name of constitutionalism, Bosch and his followers launched a revolution in 1965, the objective of which was the restoration of the liberal 1963 constitution.\nLargely due to the United States military intervention of April 1965, the civil war had died down by 1966. With Joaquín Balaguer and his party in control, the Dominicans wrote still another constitution. This one was intended to avert the conflicts and polarization of the past by combining features from both the liberal and the conservative traditions. The 1966 Constitution incorporated a long list of basic rights and provided a strengthened legislature; however, it also gave extensive powers to the executive, including emergency powers. In this way, the country sought to bridge the gap between its democratic and authoritarian constitutions by compromising their differences.\nLater constitutions were enacted in 1994 and 2002.\nConstitution of 2010\nPresident Leonel Fernández ordered for a new constitution to be drafted. The constitution has faced notable criticism, both abroad and at home, with opponents referring to it as an \"injustice\" and as a \"step backward\" for ensuring human rights in the country, especially towards women and homosexuals. A ban on same-sex marriage and abortion (Article 55) was included at the behest of the Roman Catholic Church and Evangelical Christians. As a result, the Dominican Republic has become the fifth jurisdiction in the world with a complete (no exceptions) ban on abortion (Malta, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Vatican City).\nConstitution Day\nUntil 2011, a public holiday was held to commemorate Constitution Day () on November 6. Since then, it has been held on the closest Monday to that date to ensure a three-day weekend. In 2020, it fell on November 9. In 2021, it fell on November 8. In 2022, it fell on November 7. It will occur on these days in coming years:\n* 2023: November 6\n* 2024: November 4\n* 2025: November 10\n* 2026: November 9\nSee also\n* Constitutional law\n* Constitutional economics\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*[https://www.amazon.com/The-Constitution-Dominican-Republic-ebook/dp/B004SBWI3O 2015 Constitution in English]\n*[https://www.amazon.com/Constituci%C3%B3n-Rep%C3%BAblica-Dominicana-tem%C3%A1tico-Spanish-ebook/dp/B003UHW0XA 2015 Constitution in Spanish]\nExternal links\n*  Colección de constituiciones |url=https://www.consultoria.gov.do/Services/Constitutions |website=www.consultoria.gov.do}}\n*[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Dominican_Republic_2015.pdf 2015 Constitution]\n*[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/DomRep/domrep94.html 1994 Constitution]\n*[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/DomRep/domrep02.html 2002 Constitution]\n*[https://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/dominican-republic/government Dominican Republic: Government]"
