Adele stated that the gesture was aimed at \"the suits\", not her fans. ITV issued an apology to the show as a spokesman for the network stated:\nCorden was also upset by the occurrence, stating afterwards:\nDue to the over-running, Blur's set was also cut off, prior to their performance of \"Tender\".\nEmeli Sandé\nThere was more controversy later on in the show when Emeli Sandé wasn't allowed to give a speech after winning the Critic's Choice Award. Sandé was said to be distressed by the bosses of the show and also angry after Adele got an apology for being cut off, whereas she did not.
