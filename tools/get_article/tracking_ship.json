Since many missile ranges launch over ocean areas for safety reasons, range ships are used to extend the range of shore-based tracking facilities.\nIn the United States, the initial tracking ships were constructed by the U.S. Army and then the U.S. Air Force to support their missile programs. They were generally built on a surplus Liberty ship or Victory ship hull. By 1964, the U.S. Navy took over all the range ships and introduced more.\nIn some Navies, such a ship is also given the Type Designation \"Vigilship\" or \"Veladora\", with the Designation Letter \"V\" or Letters \"VC\".\nMissile range instrumentation ships\nPeople's Liberation Army Aerospace Force\nThe Chinese ships were purpose built vessels for their role in the navy and the space program.\n* Yuanwang class\n** Yuanwang 1, 1977 – present\n** Yuanwang 2, 1978 – present\n** Yuanwang 3, 1995 – present\n** Yuanwang 4, 1999 – 2010\n** Yuanwang 5, 2007 – present\n** Yuanwang 6, 2007 – present\nFrench Navy\nThe Monge (A601) of the French Navy, 1999\nInactive\n* Henri Poincaré, 1964–1992 &mdash; ex-Italian oil tanker\nActive\n* Monge, 1992–present\nIndian Navy\n*INS Dhruv, 2021–present\n*INS Anvesh, 2022–present\nPakistan Navy\n*PNS Rizwan, 2023–present\nRussian Navy / Soviet Navy\nunderway, 1987]]\nThe Soviet and later Russian ships were purpose built vessels for their role.\n* Kosmonaut Vladimir Komarov, 1966–1989 (scrapped)\n* Akademik Sergei Korolev, 1970–1996 (scrapped)\n* Kosmonavt Yuri Gagarin'', 1971–1996 (scrapped)\n* ', 1978–2001 (museum attraction)\n* ', 1978–2006  (scrapped)\n* ', 1977–2000  (scrapped)\n* ', 1977–2000  (scrapped)\n* ', 1967–1989  (scrapped)\n* ', 1967–1989  (scrapped)\n* ', 1967–1989  (scrapped)\n* ', 1967–1989  (scrapped)\n* SSV-33 Ural, 1989–2001 (scrapped)\n* ', 1984–2000 (scrapped)\n* ', 1990\nUnited States Navy/United States Air Force\nunderway]]\nU.S. Army tracking ship (1958–1964) USAS American Mariner docked at Chaguaramus, Trinidad\nThere are currently only two active Instrumentation Ships in the U.S. Navy inventory:  and .
