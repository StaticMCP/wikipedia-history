From 1847 to 1853, he was engineer to the York and North Midland Railway, before assuming this position on the Midland Great Western Railway, Ireland in 1853. From 1858 he was Locomotive and Permanent Way Engineer for the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (later the West Midland Railway).\nIn 1864 Wilson set up his own practice, Edward Wilson & Co, and worked on the Metropolitan Railway and on several new lines on the Great Western Railway and on many Great Eastern Railway projects, including the first phase of Liverpool Street Station in 1874. He was joined in the practice by his nephew, John Wilson (1846–1922), who was his apprentice, and by the architect W. N. Ashbee; collectively the three contributed to the Great Eastern works.\nAfter Wilson's death in 1877 the practice of Edward Wilson & Co was carried on by John Wilson, in partnership with J. S. Macintyre, until it was dissolved in 1883 when John Wilson and Ashbee joined the permanent staff of the GER.\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* UK Census returns"
