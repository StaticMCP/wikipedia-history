In particular, whether HBC is effective in promoting settlement of the region. The committee later delivers a report expressing displeasure with the current administrative policies of HBC. The committee recommends transferring land to the Province of Canada, but this is not viewed as appropriate because Canada is still only a province. Little progress is made.\n|\n|-\n|1864\n|January\n|The International Financial Society, an emerging investment company, purchases a controlling interest in the HBC. The society is more interested in leveraging the vast lands for expansion, stating in their prospectus \"It has become evident that... the immense resources of the Company's territory... should be developed in accordance with the industrial spirit of the age, and the rapid advancement which colonization has [been] made in the countries adjacent.\"\n|\n|-\n|1867\n|July 1\n|With the Confederation of Canada, Canada becomes a country. The new federal government quickly becomes interested in expanding westward, urged on by American interest in the lands and British desire to maintain a sphere of influence over the region.\n|\n|-\n|1867\n|December 21\n|Charles Stanley Monck, 4th Viscount Monck, Governor General of Canada, sends a despatch to Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, then Secretary of State for the Colonies with a joint address from both the Senate and House of Commons requesting the annexation of \"Rupert's Land and the Red River settlement\" to the Dominion of Canada be submitted to The Crown for consideration.\n|\n|-\n|1868\n|October 2\n|George-Étienne Cartier, Minister of Militia and Defence and William McDougall, Minister of Public Works are selected by the Privy Council to negotiate on behalf of Canada.\n|\n|-\n|1868\n|October 13\n|Cartier and McDougall expected to arrive in the UK for negotiations.\n|\n|-\n|1868\n|March 9\n|Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, the new Secretary of State for the Colonies, issues an ultimatum to both HBC and the Canadian negotiators. Neither side accepts.\n|\n|-\n|1868\n|July 31\n|Rupert's Land Act is passed by the parliament of the United Kingdom. The act does not complete the transfer but merely confirms the support of the United Kingdom's parliament for negotiations to occur.\n|\n|-\n|1869\n|May 8\n|Cartier and McDougall submit their report to the Canadian Parliament regarding negotiations with HBC and British officials, after their return to Canada.\n|\n|-\n|1869\n|June 21\n|Government of Canada resolves to accept loan from the United Kingdom and pay the HBC company upon transferred to the dominion.\n|\n|-\n|1869\n|November 19\n|Canadian, HBC, and British negotiators sign the Deed of Surrender.\n|\n|-\n|1869\n|December 1\n|The Canadian government ratifies the agreement.\n|\n|-\n|1870\n|May 7\n|HBC forwards the finalized deal to the Colonial Office.\n|\n|-\n|1870\n|May 11\n|Canada finalizes deposits to HBC.\n|\n|-\n|1870\n|June 23\n|Queen Victoria issues an order-in-council, Rupert's Land and North-Western Territory - Enactment No. 3, to take effect on 15 July 1870.\n|\n|-\n|1870\n|July 15\n|Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory are combined under the new name of the North-West Territories. Simultaneously, the province of Manitoba is created by the Manitoba Act.\n|\n|}\nReferences"
