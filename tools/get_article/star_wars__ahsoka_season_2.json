Rosario Dawson was set to reprise her role as Ahsoka Tano from The Mandalorian, having taken over from Ashley Eckstein who voiced the character in Dave Filoni's animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2020) and Star Wars Rebels (2014–2018). The new spin-off series were set in the same trimeframe as The Mandalorian—during the 30 years between the films Return of the Jedi (1983) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)—and were planned to culminate in a \"climactic story event\". They were being developed by The Mandalorian creator Jon Favreau and Filoni, with Filoni creating and showrunning Ahsoka. Lucasfilm's Kathleen Kennedy, Carrie Beck, and Colin Wilson were also executive producers.\nThe first season of Ahsoka continued a story that Filoni established in the epilogue of Rebels, and was referred to by some fans and commentators as effectively being a fifth season of Rebels. That series ended with protagonist Ezra Bridger and antagonist Grand Admiral Thrawn being taken to an unknown location, and the epilogue showed Ahsoka joining Ezra's friend Sabine Wren to search for them. In the first season of Ahsoka, Ezra and Thrawn are found in another galaxy and return to the main Star Wars galaxy, while Ahsoka and Sabine are stranded in the other galaxy with antagonists Baylan Skoll and Shin Hati. Baylan discovers large statues of the Mortis gods–powerful Force-wielders introduced in The Clone Wars–as part of his own journey. It was initially unclear how Baylan's story would continue following the death of actor Ray Stevenson in May 2023.\nDevelopment\nAhsoka was initially reported to be a miniseries, but Disney was not listing it as such by February 2023. That April, Filoni was announced to be making a film that would serve as a culmination of the interconnected stories of The Mandalorian and its spin-offs. The film's timing would depend on future television seasons, including a possible second season of Ahsoka which was dependent on the first season's performance. When the first season was fully released in October, a second season was considered more likely to be Filoni's next project than the film. The next month, Filoni revealed that he was now chief creative officer at Lucasfilm and would be directly involved in the planning of future films and series. He was considering a second season of Ahsoka at that time, and Lucasfilm officially announced that Filoni was developing the season in January 2024. Filoni said the second season would have eight episodes, like the first, which he had written by April 2025. In September, Bryce Dallas Howard revealed that she directed two episodes of the season after previously directing for The Mandalorian and other Star Wars series. Filoni, Jennifer Getzinger, and Anders Engström also directed episodes of the season.\nWriting\nThe season features two storylines: Ahsoka and Sabine are hunted by Shin on Peridea as part of their journey, which is connected to the Mortis gods and culminates in a confrontation with Baylan; and Thrawn leads the remnants of the Galactic Empire and his Nightsister allies against the New Republic, whose forces are led by Admiral Ackbar. Filoni said it was challenging for him to write the season after Stevenson's death. He discussed with the actor's family before deciding to recast the role of Baylan and continue his story. He explained that Baylan is \"the parallel to Ahsoka in every way, a different journey for a Jedi who has been lost\".\nCasting\nRosario Dawson returned from the first season to star as Ahsoka Tano, alongside Natasha Liu Bordizzo as Sabine Wren, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Hera Syndulla, Ivanna Sakhno as Shin Hati, Eman Esfandi as Ezra Bridger, and Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker. Rory McCann was cast to replace Stevenson as Baylan Skoll in January 2025, and his casting was confirmed that April at Star Wars Celebration Japan. Filoni said they wanted an actor who understood both the character and Stevenson, and could follow the \"blueprint\" that Stevenson established. He said McCann had \"such respect for Ray, and his whole focus is not letting Ray down and not letting [the audience] down\". McCann was previously cast as Brasso in the Star Wars television series Andor (2022–2025), but was forced to leave the role due to a knee injury and was replaced by Joplin Sibtain.\nDesign\nDoug Chiang returned as production designer from the first season and was joined by Martin Foley. Filoni asked special effects supervisor Neal Scanlan to replicate \"all the wiggles\" of the original Admiral Ackbar prosthetics from Return of the Jedi. Sabine's loth-cat Murley, created with puppets and animatronics, returned from the first season alongside new loth-kittens who Filoni explained have \"legs [that] aren't strong enough to walk, so they have to roll around\".\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on April 28, 2025, in the United Kingdom. Stephan Pehrsson was the cinematographer for episodes two, three, and six. A wrap party for the season was held at the end of September.\nMusic\nKevin Kiner returned as composer from the first season and started discussing the second season with Filoni by mid-June 2024. Filoni created a playlist of music while he was writing the season for Kiner to use as reference.\nMarketing\nThe season's announcement in January 2024 was accompanied by a sketch from Filoni featuring Ahsoka and Sabine with the Mortis gods statues, leading to speculation about the season's possible story. Filoni, Favreau, Dawson, and Christensen discussed the series during a panel at Star Wars Celebration Japan in April 2025. Though primarily focused on the making of the first season, the panel also teased what was to come in the second season ahead of the start of filming. A teaser was shown featuring concept art, still images, and a voiceover inspired by the style of the first teaser trailer for the film The Empire Strikes Back (1980).\nRelease\nThe season is expected to be released on the streaming service Disney+ and consist of eight episodes.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*"
