The film was produced and directed by Bill Lichtenstein with the Peabody Award-winning Lichtenstein Creative Media.\nThe film's use of crowdsourcing to collect archival material for its production and to raise the funds necessary to produce it has been called \"A revolution in documentary filmmaking\" by the American University Center for Social Media. In order to produce the film, tens of thousands of individual archival items, including photographs, audio recordings, film, video and memorabilia, were shared with the producers by members of the public.  A collection of these items has been established at University of Massachusetts Amherst.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://WBCN104.com Audio stream from The American Revolution archives]\n*[http://WBCNFM.com The American Revolution Archives Collection at UMass Amherst]"
