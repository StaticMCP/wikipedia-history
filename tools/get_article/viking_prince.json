      "text": "# Viking Prince\n\nThe Viking Prince is a fictional Viking hero appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. The character first appeared in The Brave and the Bold #1 (August 1955), and was created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Joe Kubert. He is one of three historical fiction characters to premiere in the issue, alongside the Silent Knight and Golden Gladiator.\nFictional character biography\nIn The Brave and the Bold #1, the main character is found amnesiac, on a beach by 10th century Scandinavian fishermen, who name him \"Jon\" after a legendary prince. His enemy Thorvald knows his true identity and wants to kill him before he regains his memory or meets someone else who recognizes him. This set-up is ignored by later writers, some of whom make no mention of his background, while others portray him as an actual prince, the son of King Rikk.\nIn Our Army at War #162-163 (January - February 1966), Sergeant Rock finds the Viking Prince in a glacier and frees him. Jon reveals that he previously fell in love with a valkyrie, resulting in Odin banishing him from Valhalla and telling him that he could only return if he died a heroic death. However, Odin was crafty and cursed Jon with invulnerability to all known weapons. He is killed by a plastique explosive, an unknown weapon at the time the curse was made.\nSubsequently, the Viking Prince appears in Justice League of America #159-160, a backup comic in \"Arak, Son of Thunder\", Birds of Prey #29, The War that Time Forgot (2008), The Judas Coin (2012), and The Odyssey of the Amazons. In the Endless Winter event, Hippolyta summons his spirit to help battle the Frost King. She offers to resurrect him, but he refuses.\nIn Legends of the Dark Knight #35 (August 1992), Batman encounters Jon Rikkson, an environmental activist and descendant of the Prince.\nThe Viking Prince appeared in the 2020 crossover event \"Endless Winter\" as one of the heroes from the 10th century who fought against the Frost King, alongside Hippolyta, Black Adam and a 10th Century version of Swamp Thing. In the flashbacks of this story it is revealed that he finally found his heroic death while fighting the Frost King and was welcomed into Valhalla. His spirit was later summoned to the present day by Hippolyta, where he was temporarily made an avatar of the Green (the force that connects all plant life on Earth and which gives Swamp Thing his powers). After fighting in the climactic battle of the story, in which he inhabited a gigantic version of Swamp Thing to fight an equally gigantic avatar of the Frost King, Hippolyta offered to find him another vessel so that his spirit could remain in the world of the living. The Prince declined, returning to Valhalla to continue enjoying his long-awaited reward.\nPowers and abilities\nThe Viking Prince was an expert at hand-to-hand combat. Due to Odin's curse, he is invulnerable to all weapons.\nOther versions\nThe Viking Prince makes a cameo appearance in DC: The New Frontier.\nCollected editions\n* The Viking Prince (collects The Brave and the Bold #1-5, 7-24 & Our Army at War #162-163);\nIn other media\n* Jon Haraldson appears in the Justice League Unlimited episode \"To Another Shore\".
