Howington (born August 3, 1950 in Alabama, United States) is an American best-selling romance/suspense author under her pseudonym Linda Howard.\nBiography\nHowington began to write at nine years old, and wrote for twenty years for her own enjoyment.  She worked at a trucking company where she met her husband, Gary F. Howington, and then decided to try to get her work published in 1980. After 21 years of penning stories for her own enjoyment, she submitted a novel for publication which was very successful. Her first work, All That Glitters, was published by Silhouette in 1982.\nHowington joined the Romance Writers of America (RWA) in 1981, shortly after it was formed. She served as Region 3 Director (until 31 October 2008). In 2017, Howard criticized the RWA's attempts to be more inclusive of non-white authors, writing on an internal forum that \"Diversity for the sake of diversity is discrimination\". The controversy caused by her statement led Howington to resign from the organization.\nHer husband is a professional bass tournament fisherman, and she travels with him and works on her laptop. The couple live on a farm in Alabama, where they raise cattle and have two dogs.\nAwards\n2005 - [https://web.archive.org/web/20070429115854/http://www.rwanational.org/ Romance Writers of America].
