Within four years of its establishment, the prize \"had become the major book award in Africa\".  It was one of the series of Noma Prizes.\nThe prize was established in 1979 by Shoichi Noma (died 1984), president of Kodansha Ltd, the largest publishing house in Japan, to encourage the publication of works by African authors. The award was annual and given to any new book published in three categories: literature, juvenile and scholarly. The award was sponsored by Kodansha Ltd, administered by the quarterly African Book Publishing Record, and presented under the auspices of UNESCO. Books were admissible in any of the languages of Africa, whether local or European. The award was ended in 2009 after the Noma family ceased its sponsorship.\nWinners\n*1980: Une Si Longue Lettre by Mariama Bâ\n*1981: Health Education for the Community by Felix C.
