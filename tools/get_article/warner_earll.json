H. Belknap, who had been temporarily appointed to the seat. Earll served but two years and was not a candidate to succeed himself.\nAt the election of 1876, O. R. Leonard was elected to succeed Earll and was re-elected in 1882, defeating M. Kirkpatrick and M. N. Stone, respectively.\nEarll died at his home in San Luis Obispo, California, at the age of 73. A tribute to his memory, worth and ability was pronounced by Justice Thomas Porter Hawley and appears in the 19 Nevada Reports. Earll had a son, Arthur, who was also a lawyer, and who had practiced law in his father's firm for a time. Arthur died in 1889, shortly after being elected district attorney.\nReferences"
