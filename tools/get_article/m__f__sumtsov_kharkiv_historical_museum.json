Its ethnographic collection was one of the largest and best among all city museums in Russian Empire.\nIn 1902 the nationwide Archaeological Congress was held in Kharkiv. A huge previous search work was conducted. There were collected a large number of valuable objects of history, ethnography, art that revealed history and culture of  inhabitants of the region.
