In the , Biddaddaba had a population of 171 people.\nGeography\nBiddaddaba is nestled in a small valley formed by the Biddaddaba Creek, a tributary of Canungra Creek, itself a tributary of the Albert River.  The heavily vegetated slopes of a ridge extending in a north/south direction and climbing to elevations of more than 500&nbsp;m above sea level, form a summit at Mount Misery in the east.  In the west, Mount Tabragalba is the highest point along another ridge with roughly half the prominence.   Several large dams are scattered throughout the locality.\nThe predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from Biddaddaba Creek, which in turn was named with an Bundjalung language word  burubi-da meaning place of koalas.\nBiddaddaba Creek State School opened on 18 April 1933 and closed in 1959. It was at 363 Biddaddaba Creek Road ().\nOn Sunday 6 October 1935, Archbishop James Duhig officially opened Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church. From March 1932, Catholic mass had been held in private homes in the district.

Duhig commented that it was the smallest church he had opened. The church was at 67 Biddaddaba Creek Road ().
