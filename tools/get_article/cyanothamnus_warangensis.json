It has bipinnate leaves and groups of between five and twenty-five or more white flowers in leaf axils.\nDescription\nCyanothamnus warangensis is an erect, woody shrub that typically grows to a height of about . It has bipinnate leaves  long and  wide with between five and seven leaflets on a petiole  long. The end leaflet is  long and  wide and the side leaflets are similar but longer. The flowers are white and are arranged in groups of up between five and twenty-five or more in leaf axils on a peduncle  long. The four sepals are egg-shaped, about  long and wide and the four petals are about  long. The stamens are hairy on their edges and the stigma is minute, scarcely wider than the style. Flowering mainly occurs from March to September and the fruit is a glabrous capsule about  long and  wide.\nTaxonomy and naming\nThis species was first formally described in 2003 by Marco F. Duretto who gave it the name Boronia warangensis in the journal Muelleria from a specimen collected in the Warang section of the White Mountains National Park. In a 2013 paper in the journal Taxon, Marco Duretto and others changed the name to Cyanothamnus warangensis on the basis of cladistic analysis. The specific epithet (warangensis) refers to type location.\nDistribution and habitat\nCyanothamnus warangensis is confined to the White Mountains National Park where it grows in scrub or woodland in sandstone country.\nConservation\nCyanothamnus warangensis (as Boronia warangensis) is listed as of \"least concern\" by the Queensland Government Department of Environment and Science.\nReferences"
