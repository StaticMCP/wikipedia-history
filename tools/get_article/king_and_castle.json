The series stars Derek Martin as Ronald King, a Detective Sergeant with the Metropolitan Police, who is obliged to leave the force when he is investigated by the anti-corruption squad. His first venture outside of the police involves setting up his own Debt Collection Agency, known as 'The Manor', where he partners with mild-mannered martial arts expert David Castle (Nigel Planer).\nCreated by Ian Kennedy Martin, who had previously devised The Sweeney for Thames, along with Juliet Bravo and The Chinese Detective for the BBC, King and Castle started out as an episode of Thames' Storyboard, a series of stand-alone dramas intended as potential pilots for series. Described as a combination of the rough-and-tumble of The Sweeney with the knowing wit of Minder, two series of six episodes each followed in 1986 and 1988. In 1986, a paperback tie-in novel was also released to accompany the first series.\nThe complete series of King and Castle, including the Storyboard pilot, was released on DVD via Network in April 2011 and July 2012 respectively.\nCast\n* Derek Martin as Ronald King\n* Nigel Planer as David Castle\n* Mary Healey as Miss Willmott\n* Andrew Cruickshank Mr. Hodinett\n* Laura Davenport as Deidre Aitken (1986)\n* Rowena Roberts as Hilary McLean (1988)\n* Paul Brooke as Edward Hallday-Mostyn (1986)\n* Shirley Stelfox as Betty (1988)\n* Lucy Speed as Susie (1988)\nEpisodes\nPilot (1985)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FF5C72; | No.\n! style=\"background:#FF5C72; | Title\n! style=\"background:#FF5C72; | Directed by\n! style=\"background:#FF5C72; | Written by\n! style=\"background:#FF5C72; | Airdate\n|-\n| ShortSummary    = A dissatisfied young martial artist teams up with maverick ex-cop in a new debt collecting venture.\n| LineColor       = FF5C72\n}}\n|}\nSeries 1 (1986)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ffac4f; | No.\n! style=\"background:#ffac4f; | Title\n! style=\"background:#ffac4f; | Directed by\n! style=\"background:#ffac4f; | Written by\n! style=\"background:#ffac4f; | Airdate\n|-\n| ShortSummary    = King and Castle are asked to trace a man who has sawn his house in half following the break-up of his marriage.
