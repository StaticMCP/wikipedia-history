It was established to collect and preserve documents from the era of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (GDL) within the territories of the Vilna, Grodno, Minsk, and Kovno governorates.\nHistory\nThe archive was formed based on archival funds from central and local administrative-judicial institutions following the Partitions of Poland (late 18th century). Before the centralization of archives, the main documentary materials were kept in the archive of the Tribunal of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which effectively served as the main Vilna archive at the time. In 1795, it contained 2,071 books, many of which were in a catastrophic condition.\nAt the last Sejm in the late 18th century, the nobility of the GDL adopted a resolution to create the position of a special archivist — a regent, who was to be elected from the local nobility of \"good standing, owners of real estate, knowledgeable in law, and enjoying general respect.\" The first regent was the Orsha cup-bearer (Cześnik) A. Malczewski, who organized and transcribed the tribunal books into 89 volumes. The archive received books from the Grodno and Novogrudok sessions, acts of the Military Commission, the Targowica Confederation, and others. In 1837–1840, it was replenished with collections of acts from the Treasury Tribunal, the Lithuanian Treasury Commission, and Troki archival materials. In the first half of the 19th century, ancient documents and acts were also kept in the archives of the Vilna Castle Court (about 255 books) and the Grodno Court (145 notebooks or \"fascicles\").\nIn accordance with the Tsar's decree of 2 April 1852, the Central Archive of Ancient Act Books of the Western Governorates was created based on these archival collections.\nIn the mid-19th century, its funds numbered 17,439 units, including:\n* The Tribunal Archive — 74 original privileges, 6,662 books.\n* Archives of district courts and magistrates (Ashmyany, Vileyka, Vilna, Dzisna, Druya, Lida, Radashkovichy, Sventiany, Troki) — 2,190 books.\n* Archives of the Grodno Governorate (4,922 books, 2 boxes), Minsk Governorate (1,906 books), and Kovno Governorate (1,550 books).\nLater acquisitions included books of the Mstislavl Castle Court from 1733 (a gift from archaeographer M. Krupowicz), Pinsk privileges from 1554 (property of collegiate assessor V. Turski), a register of Grodno privileges for 1696–1717, an inventory of the Babruysk Starostwo from 1639 compiled by royal auditor A. Kirdziej, and 199 inventories and acts from the collections of the Grodno Treasury Chamber, among others.\nIn 1880, the Grodno governor sent 288 files of the Bialystok District (acts from the \"Prussian\" times of 1794–1808) to the Vilna Central Archive. In 1887, the Lublin Archive of Ancient Acts (about 5,000 books) was incorporated into the Vilna Central Archive, followed by the Vitebsk Central Archives of Ancient Acts in 1903–1906.\nIn 1903, according to various revisions and archival reports, the archive held between 22,000 and 30,000 act books and fascicles.\nFollowing World War I and the evacuation of funds to Russia, about 15,000 books and fascicles remained in the former funds of the Vilna Central Archive in 1923. Part of the archival collections was returned to Vilna (then part of Poland as Wilno) under the terms of the Treaty of Riga. During the interwar period under Polish rule, the archive was known as the Wilno State Archive (), combining materials from the Vilna Central Archive, the General Archive of Vilna Institutions, and the M. Muravyov Museum.\nFrom 1944, the Central State Archive of the Lithuanian SSR began operating on this basis. In 1957, it was renamed the Central State Historical Archive of the Lithuanian SSR (uniting the funds of the former Vilna Central Archive and the Vilnius City State Archive). With the restoration of the independence of the Republic of Lithuania, it received its current name, the Lithuanian State Historical Archives.\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nReferences"
