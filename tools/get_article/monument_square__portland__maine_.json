One Monument Square and One City Center are among the buildings on the square itself, while the Time and Temperature Building, Fidelity Trust Building and the main branch of the Portland Public Library are on Congress Street, across from the square.\nUntil the 20th century, Middle Street originated from Market Square. It ran east through where The Maine Lobsterman statue is today, before continuing its current route from its intersection with Temple, Spring and Union Streets. The original stretch, which formerly met Federal Street in the square, is now paved with bricks and is no longer Middle Street.\nConstituent buildings\n(left) and the M&T Bank Building]]\nOne Monument Square, a ten-story office building on the eastern edge of the square, was built on the site of the United States Hotel. Tenants at its November 1970 opening included the law firms Bernstein, Shur, Sawyer & Nelson and Pierce, Atwood, Scribner, Allen, Smith & Lancaster, and Amica Mutual Insurance. The building was renovated in 2015.\n28 Monument Square was built in 1871. In 2006, the first floor and basement of the building became the home of Public Market House, whose several vendors flank a narrow central corridor. Some vendors moved to Public Market House from the nearby Portland Public Market building, at the corner of Preble Street and Cumberland Avenue, which closed earlier in the year.\nOld City Hall\nIn 1825, the Town of Portland built Market House in Market Square to facilitate the sale produce and livestock. In 1833, the structure was modified to serve as Portland's first city hall. In 1862, it was replaced by a new city hall, located on Congress Street at the head of Exchange Street. The old city hall was demolished in 1888 and replaced by the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, at which time Market Square was renamed Monument Square.\nPortland Soldiers and Sailors Monument\nThe Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (also known as \"Our Lady of Victories\") stands in the center of Monument Square, on the former site of Portland's 1833 city hall. Dedicated on October 28, 1891, it honors \"those brave men of Portland, soldiers of the United States Army and sailors of the Navy of the United States who died in defense of the country in the late civil war\". It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 1, 1998.\nGallery\nFile:Portland City Hall (1830).png|A 1902 sketch by Charles Quincy Goodhue of Market House (), which was modified in 1833 to become the first city hall\nFile:Old Portland City Hall.jpg|alt=Black and white photo of a grand Greek revival civic building with a gable roof, an oversized portico supported by four large ionic columns flanked to the left and right by tall, barrel arch windows, below a simple pediment.
