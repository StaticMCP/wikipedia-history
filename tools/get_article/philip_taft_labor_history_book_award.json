Labor history is considered \"in a broad sense to include the history of workers (free and unfree, organized and unorganized), their institutions, and their workplaces, as well as the broader historical trends that have shaped working-class life, including but not limited to: immigration, slavery, community, the state, race, gender, and ethnicity.\" The award is named after the noted labor historian Philip Taft (1902–1976).\nRecipients\nSource: [https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/taft-award/award-recipients/past-award-recipients ILR School, Cornell University]\n*1978 – David M.
