It is also one of a few surviving sections of the original alignment of U.S. Route&nbsp;79 (U.S.&nbsp;79) in Arkansas. The road that became US&nbsp;79 had been laid out by 1916, and was paved with asphalt in 1930. In the mid-1930s, the state embarked on a program of removing dangerous grade crossings where major routes crossed railroad tracks. In 1938, it awarded a contract to S. M. Dixon to build an overpass at the crossing of US&nbsp;79 and the St. Louis Southwestern Railway line. Dixon built a  section of concrete roadway,  wide, with a concrete deck girder bridge to cross the tracks. This section of US&nbsp;79 remained in service until 1954, when the current alignment to its northeast was built. It has since been designated County Road&nbsp;22. The concrete is in good condition; it has been covered in chip seal for about half its length.\nThe highway segment was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Cleveland County, Arkansas\nReferences"
