She was built, like her sister ship, the protected cruiser , in France supervised by Juan José Latorre. The ships were ordered in 1887 by President José Manuel Balmaceda before the beginning of the 1891 Chilean Civil War.\nDuring the war, the two cruisers lay incomplete in French dockyards alongside the pre-dreadnought battleship . If these had been secured by the Balmacedists the naval supremacy of the congress would have been seriously challenged. The congressional forces formally requested that the ships be detained. None of the three ships were involved in the Civil War.\nPresidente Pinto was launched and sailed to Chile on 5 August 1891, before having been completed. Her artillery was supplied from an English merchant in the North Sea while transiting to Chile.\nHer voyage to Chile saw some trouble, forced to return to Le Havre in order to pick up crew and insubordination of the crew. She arrived to Valparaíso in September 1892, too late to participate in the Civil War.\nThe engines had to be repaired because of the improper conditioning during the voyage to Chile.\nIn 1902, during the Thousand Days' War, the Colombian Government tried unsuccessfully to purchase Presidente Pinto.\nSee also\n* South American dreadnought race\n* List of decommissioned ships of the Chilean Navy\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Chilean Navy website, [https://archive.today/20130116085544/http://www.armada.cl/prontus_armada/site/artic/20090710/pags/20090710195032.html Crucero Presidente Pinto]\n* [http://navalhistory.flixco.info/H/310381x53053/8330/a0.htm Presidente Pinto] covered by \"Conway's All The World's Fighting Ships 1860-1905\""
