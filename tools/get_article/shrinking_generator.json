It was published in Crypto 1993 by Don Coppersmith, Hugo Krawczyk and Yishay Mansour.\nThe shrinking generator uses two linear-feedback shift registers. One, called the  sequence, generates output bits, while the other, called the  sequence, controls their output. Both  and  are clocked; if the  bit is 1, then the  bit is output; if the  bit is 0, the  bit is discarded, nothing is output, and the registers are clocked again. This has the disadvantage that the generator's output rate varies irregularly, and in a way that hints at the state of S; this problem can be overcome by buffering the output. The random sequence generated by LFSR can not guarantee the unpredictability in secure system and various methods have been proposed to improve its randomness\nDespite this simplicity, there are currently no known attacks better than exhaustive search when the feedback polynomials are secret. If the feedback polynomials are known, however, the best known attack requires less than  •  bits of output.\nA variant is the self-shrinking generator.\nAn implementation in Python\nThis example uses two Galois LFRSs to produce the output pseudorandom bitstream. The Python code can be used to encrypt and decrypt a file or any bytestream.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport sys\n# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Crypto4o functions start here\n# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nclass GLFSR:\n\"\"\"Galois linear-feedback shift register.\"\"\"\ndef __init__(self, polynom, initial_value):\nprint \"Using polynom 0x%X, initial value: 0x%X.\" % (polynom, initial_value)\nself.polynom = polynom | 1\nself.data = initial_value\ntmp = polynom\nself.mask = 1\nwhile tmp != 0:\nif tmp & self.mask != 0:\ntmp ^= self.mask\nif tmp  0:\nbreak\nself.mask\nSee also\n* FISH, an (insecure) stream cipher based on the shrinking generator principle\n* Alternating step generator, a similar stream cipher\nReferences=="
