      "text": "# Cincinnati Kings\n\nCincinnati Kings were a professional American soccer club based in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Founded in 2005, the team played in the USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, in the Great Lakes Division of the Central Conference.\nThe Cincinnati Kings indoor team was founded in 2008. The club was formed to provide year-round professional soccer in Cincinnati.\nThe team played its home games at the Town and Country Sports Complex in nearby Wilder, Kentucky, where they played starting in 2007. The team's colors were red and black.\nHistory\nUSL Second Division\nThe Cincinnati Kings first entered the USL Second Division in 2005, under the leadership of Yacoub Abdallahi, an entrepreneur from Mauritania in Africa who graduated from Northern Kentucky University, and player-manager Jon Pickup, a former English U-16 international, who played professionally in England with Wigan Athletic, Blackburn Rovers and Chester City. From their home at Corcoran Field on the campus of Xavier University, the Kings made an immediate splash in the league, remaining unbeaten in their first five games, and enjoying a comprehensive 5–0 win over Northern Virginia Royals in just their second ever competitive match. However, Cincinnati's mid-season form stuttered slightly; the Kings lost four in a row, conceding a late goal against Long Island Rough Riders, and giving Wilmington Hammerheads and own-goal winner in the first game of June. Even their first foray into the US Open Cup was a disappointing one, as they shockingly lost 4–2 in the first round to Indianapolis-based USASA amateur side Reggae Boyz. This, really, remained the story for much of the rest of the season. Xavier University was not the fortress they needed it to be, and despite an away win over Charlotte Eagles in early July, and a 4–1 thrashing of Northern Virginia Royals on the last day of the season, the Kings finished their first year in 5th place behind regular season champions Western Mass Pioneers. George Kithas was the top scorer with 5 goals; Jack Cummings and Tiest Sondaal were the top assist providers with three each.\n2006 was a slight improvement for the Kings. Despite losing their opening two fixtures, the Kings nevertheless became a tough team to beat, and enjoyed improved home form throughout the season. The Kings' main problem was a lack of consistency, and their inability to build any kind of unbeaten momentum – their strongest run of form coming towards the end of July when they rattled off four wins in a row, including two 4-goal hauls against Long Island Rough Riders. Most of the rest of the time, however, win followed loss followed win followed loss, and all the while the Kings lost ground on the teams ahead of them. For the second consecutive year the Kings' US Open Cup run was a short one, going out at the first hurdle with a 2–1 loss to PDL side Michigan Bucks. However, despite losing their final two regular season games of the year to Pittsburgh Riverhounds and Western Mass Pioneers, their results were enough to leave them in fourth place in the table, and in the playoffs. They were drawn against Richmond Kickers in the semi-final; Richmond took the first leg at home in Virginia 2–1, and despite a home crowd of 1,465, and despite outshooting the Kickers, the Kings simply couldn't find the net in the second leg, and Richmond went through to the final 2–1 on aggregate. Jeff Hughes and John Krause were Cincinnati's top scorers, with 4 goals each, Nowaf Jaman contributed 4 assists, and head coach Pickup was named USL2 Manager of the Year.\n2007, however, was tough all round for the Ohioans. The year started positively with a move away from University accommodation to the Town and Country Sports Club, just across the border in Wilder, Kentucky, which owner Yacoub purchased as the Kings' permanent home for $11.3 million. On the field, however, the Kings' fortunes were much less favorable. The Kings only managed two wins – 1–0 over Crystal Palace Baltimore and 4–0 over New Hampshire Phantoms – in their first ten games, and by the end of June were already struggling to remain in contention for the playoffs. For the third year in a row the Kings' US Open Cup run lasted just one game, as they lost to a USASA side for the second time – this time a 1–0 defeat to National Premier Soccer League team Milwaukee Bavarians – and this seemed to signal Cincinnati's doom for the rest of the season. The Kings just managed to win just two more regular season games – 1–0 over Richmond Kickers in July and 3–1 over New Hampshire Phantoms on the last day of the season – eventually finishing a distant 8th in the table. Chad Eckerlin and Byron Neal did score 13 goals between them, but on the whole it was a hugely disappointing season for the Kings.\nPrior to the beginning of the 2008 season, it was announced that the Kings would be taking voluntary relegation, and would henceforth be competing in the USL Premier Development League.\nUSL Premier Development League\nThe Kings' first season in the PDL did not go entirely to plan, despite winning their opening game 1–0 over the Indiana Invaders. The Kings lost five of their next six games, dropping 3–0 to Ohio rivals Cleveland Internationals, and only just scraping past West Virginia Chaos 2–1 off a late, late winner from Braden Bishop. Things didn't get much better during the middle of the season; Cleveland compounded their state superiority with a thumping 5–1 win at the end of July, and although the Kings managed to hold perennial powerhouses Chicago Fire Premier to a goalless draw, and pick up another win over West Virginia, things were generally fairly grim. The Kings were out of the playoff race by mid-August, and dropped three of their last five games, including a 0–4 loss to Toronto Lynx on the final day of the season. Thy eventually finished fourth in their division, almost 30 points behind league-leaders Michigan Bucks; Branden Stelmak was the top scorer, the 5 goals on the season.\n2009 was not much better for the Kings. In their second season in the amateur ranks they managed just four wins in a difficult season – a 2–0 win over the Indiana Invaders in May, a pair of 3–1 wins over Fort Wayne Fever in June, and a 3–2 win over Toronto Lynx in July in which substitute Judson McKinney scored a last minute winner. The rest of the year was a disappointment, especially on the defensive end; they conceded three goals on five separate occasions, including four of their first five games of the season. Their worst defeat of the season was the 5–1 thrashing they suffered at the hands of Chicago Fire Premier in July. The Kings finished the season in 8th place in the Great Lakes division, decisively out of the playoffs; Judson McKinney was the team's top scorer, with four goals, while Aaron Miller and Jonathan Sutton contributed two assists each.\nPlayers\nFinal roster\nAs of June 7, 2011.\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nNotable former players\nThis list of notable former players comprises players who went on to play professional soccer after playing for the team in the Premier Development League, or those who previously played professionally before joining the team.\n*  Trey Alexander\n*  Derek Smith\n*  Ivan Becerra\n*  Moussa Dagnogo\n*  François Dubourdeau\n*  Kwame Sarkodie\n*  Jeff Hughes\n*  Jordan James\n*  John Krause\n*  John McGinlay\n*  Michael McGinlay\n*  Nathan Micklos\n*  Charley Pettys\n*  Florent Raimy\nYear-by-year\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Division\n!League\n!Regular season\n!Playoffs\n!Open Cup\n|-\n|2005\n|3\n|USL Second Division\n|5th\n|Did not qualify\n|1st round\n|-\n|2006\n|3\n|USL Second Division\n|4th\n|Semifinals\n|2nd round\n|-\n|2007\n|3\n|USL Second Division\n|8th\n|Did not qualify\n|1st round\n|-\n|2008\n|4\n|USL PDL\n|4th, Great Lakes\n|Did not qualify\n|Did not qualify\n|-\n|2009\n|4\n|USL PDL\n|8th, Great Lakes\n|Did not qualify\n|Did not qualify\n|-\n|2010\n|4\n|USL PDL\n|6th, Great Lakes\n|Did not qualify\n|Did not qualify\n|-\n|2011\n|4\n|USL PDL\n|8th, Great Lakes\n|Did not qualify\n|Did not qualify\n|-\n|2012\n|4\n|USL PDL\n|4th, Great Lakes\n|Did not qualify\n|Did not qualify\n|}\nHead coaches\n*  Jon Pickup (2005–2007)\n*  Roby Stahl (2008–present)\nStadia\nKings' current stadium, Town and Country Sports Club\n* Corcoran Field; Cincinnati, Ohio (2005–2006)\n* Town and Country Sports Complex; Wilder, Kentucky (2007–present)\nAverage attendance\nAttendance stats are calculated by averaging each team's self-reported home attendances from the historical match archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20100105175057/http://www.uslsoccer.com/history/index_E.html\n* 2005: 1,301\n* 2006: 1,153\n* 2007: not yet available\n* 2008: 1,249 214\n* 2009: 859 (13th in PDL)\n* 2010: 751\n* 2011: 151\n* 2012: 188\nSupporters\nIn 2006 the Cincinnati Kings supporters founded a group dubbed 'The Pride', inspired by the lion in the club's crest.
