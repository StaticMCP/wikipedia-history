Holy Cross finished third in the Colonial League, its first non-championship year since league play began in 1986.\nIn their third year under head coach Mark Duffner, the Crusaders compiled a 9–2 record. Dennis Golden, Rob McGovern, Tom Smith and Jeff Wiley were the team captains.\nThe Crusaders outscored opponents 334 to 182. Their 3–1 conference record placed second in the six-team Colonial League standings.\nThe Crusaders were ranked No. 1 in the preseason national Division I-AA rankings, but a 1–2 start dropped them out of the top 20 in the first round of in-season rankings. They remained unranked as they compiled an eight-game win streak to finish the season, but were recognized as No. 19 in the final poll, released after their last game.\nHoly Cross played its home games at Fitton Field on the college campus in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n| September 10 | @ | Army\n| 1 | Michie Stadium | West Point, NY | L 3 23\n| 33,136 |\n| September 17 | @ | Lafayette\n| 1 | Fisher Field | Easton, PA | L 20 28\n| 6,200 |\n| September 24 | @ | Princeton\n| | Palmer Stadium | Princeton, NJ | W 30 26\n| 10,200 |\n| October 1 |   | Harvard\n| | Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 35 20\n| 12,441 |\n| October 8 |   | Dartmouth\n| | Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 17 3\n| 850 |\n| October 15 |   | Lehigh^\n| | Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 48 24\n| 16,441 |\n| October 22 | @ | Brown\n| | Brown Stadium | Providence, RI | W 35 14\n| 5,500 |\n| October 29 | @ | Colgate\n| | Andy Kerr Stadium | Hamilton, NY | W 7 0\n| 4,500 |\n| November 12 |   | Bucknell\n| | Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 38 7\n| 9,111 |\n| November 19 |   | Northeastern\n| | Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 52 30\n| 7,881 |\n}}\nReferences"
