It was released in the United Kingdom on 27 August 2001 and later in Australia on 2 December 2001. On the UK Albums Chart, the album peaked at number three and was certified gold. Kingsize was the last album released by Five before their initial breakup.\nThree singles were released from Kingsize. The lead single, \"Let's Dance\", became a major hit, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart. Other singles from the album included \"Closer to Me\" and \"Rock the Party.\"\nBackground\nDespite only being released three months earlier, Kingsize was re-issued in the United Kingdom on 24 December 2001, containing an additional track, \"The Heat\", as well an enhanced section, featuring music videos and interview clips. The Japanese release of Kingsize features an additional slipcase, as well as the bonus track \"1,2,3,4,5\", which was issued as the B-side to \"Closer to Me\" in the United Kingdom.\nCopies of the album bought at Woolworths stores in the United Kingdom came with an exclusive poster booklet, containing information and facts on the band, as well as a complete chart history and discography. The poster booklet also indicated that a VHS release was planned to be released alongside the album, entitled Kingsize: Behind the Scenes, detailing the recording of the album, featuring interviews with the band, and including the music videos for the lead single, \"Let's Dance\", and at the time, was planned as the album's second single, \"Hear Me Now\".\nHowever, due to the band's imminent split, \"Hear Me Now\" was never released as a single, the VHS release was cancelled, and a Greatest Hits compilation was released just three months after the release of Kingsize. The track \"Set Me Free\", which was recorded during the album sessions, was later issued as an original track on the band's Greatest Hits compilation.\nCritical reception\n}}\nThe critic from Penarth Times wrote that the album starts off with energy with songs like \"Let's Dance\" for its \"funky disco beat\" and \"Rock The Party\" for its use of a Grease sample, but  as the album progresses, tracks like \"Take Your Chances On Me\" and \"On Top of the World\" become repetitive and tiresome, and the album loses its momentum toward the end.\nThe critic from PopMatters stated that, despite Five disbanding, their Kingsize showcases their ability to blend R&B, hip-hop, and pop influences better than their contemporaries like Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. The review highlights tracks like \"Let’s Dance,\" which features an upbeat, layered sound with voice modulation, and \"Lay All Your Lovin’ on Me,\" praised for its use of ACDC’s guitar riff. The critic also notes that while their slower songs target a younger audience, Five’s energetic and catchy songs, such as \"Rock the Party,\" demonstrate that they stood out for their funky, unapologetic approach to pop music.\nSineád Gleeson from RTÉ stated that it's hard to understand what Five is trying to achieve with their album Kingsize. She noted that the group attempts to incorporate snippets of various genres into pop-sized songs, but ultimately fails, producing a \"hollow collection of derivatives.\" She described the album as formulaic, advising those with musical taste to steer clear.\nTrack listing\n| extra1   =\n| length1  = 3:37\n| title2   = Lay All Your Lovin' on Me\n| note2    = lead vocals: Brown, Breen\n| writer2  =\n| extra2   =\n| length2  = 3:21\n| title3   = Rock the Party\n| note3    = lead vocals: Breen, Brown\n| writer3  =\n| extra3   =\n| length3  = 2:57\n| title4   = Closer to Me\n| note4    = lead vocals: Breen, Neville, Brown\n| writer4  =\n| extra4   =\n| length4  = 4:28\n| title5   = Hear Me Now\n| note5    = lead vocals: Neville, Robinson\n| writer5  =\n| extra5   = Stargate\n| length5  = 3:40\n| title6   = Let's Get It On\n| note6    = lead vocals: Breen, Robinson, Brown\n| writer6  =\n| extra6   =\n| length6  = 3:46\n| title7   = Feel the Love\n| note7    = lead vocals: Robinson, Neville\n| writer7  =\n| extra7   = Mac\n| length7  = 4:41\n| title8   = We're Going All Night (You Make Me High)\n| note8    = lead vocals: Brown, Breen, Neville\n| writer8  =\n| extra8   =\n| length8  = 3:03\n| title9   = Take Your Chances on Me\n| note9    = lead vocals: Conlon, Breen\n| writer9  =\n| extra9   =\n| length9  = 3:01\n| title10  = Something in the Air\n| note10   = lead vocals: Breen, Conlon, Brown\n| writer10 =\n| extra10  =\n| length10 = 4:10\n| title11  = Breakdown\n| note11   = lead vocals: Neville, Robinson\n| writer11 =\n| extra11  = Stargate\n| length11 = 3:26\n| title12  = On Top of the World\n| note12   = lead vocals: Robinson, Neville\n| writer12 =\n| extra12  = Stargate\n| length12 = 3:40\n| title13  = C'mon C'mon\n| note13   = lead vocals: Breen, Brown\n| writer13 =\n| extra13  =\n| length13 = 4:50\n| title14  = World of Mine\n| note14   = hidden track) (lead vocals: Neville, Robinson\n| writer14 =\n| extra14  = Stargate\n| length14 = 4:02\n| title15  = All Around\n| note15   = hidden track) (lead vocals: Neville, Robinson\n| writer15 =\n| extra15  = Steelworks\n| length15 = 3:47\n}}\n| length13 = 3:15\n| title14  = All Around\n| writer14 =\n| extra14  = Steelworks\n| length14 = 3:47\n| title15  = C'mon C'mon\n| writer15 =\n| extra15  =\n| length15 = 4:50\n| title16  = World of Mine\n| note16   = hidden track\n| writer16 =\n| extra16  = Stargate\n| length16 = 4:02\n}}\n| extra16  =\n| length16 = 3:51\n}}\nNotes\n*\"Lay All Your Lovin' on Me\" contains a sample from \"Back in Black\", performed by AC/DC.\n*\"Rock the Party\" contains a sample from the main theme from \"Grease\".\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from Kingsizes liner notes.\n* Abs Breen – composer, vocals\n* Andy Caine – backing vocals\n* Ash Howes – mixing, programming\n* Ben Chapman – production, mixing, engineering\n* Ben Coombs – engineering\n* Daniel Pursey – engineering\n* Dave Arch – arrangement\n* Eliot Kennedy – backing vocals\n* Jason \"J\" Brown – composer, vocals\n* Julian Gallagher – arrangement, production\n* Martin Harrington – programming\n* Matt Howe – engineering\n* Richard Stannard – arrangement, production, backing vocals\n* Ritchie Neville – composer, vocals\n* Robin Sellers – engineering\n* Scott Robinson – composer, vocals\n* Sean Conlon – composer, vocals\n* Sharon Murphy – backing vocals\n* Stargate – production, mixing\n* Steve Mac – production\n* Tim Woodcock – backing vocals\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2001)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| European Albums Chart\n| 15\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Japanese Albums (Oricon)\n| 83\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2001)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Albums (OCC)\n| 132\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Country\n!Date\n!Format\n!Label\n|-\n|-\n| United Kingdom\n| rowspan=\"1\"|27 August 2001\n| rowspan=\"1\"|CD, cassette\n| rowspan=\"1\"|BMG\n|}\nReferences"
