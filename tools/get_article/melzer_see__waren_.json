It has an area of 12.9&nbsp;hectares and lies at an elevation of . Its maximum dimensions are 670&nbsp;by 260&nbsp;metres. It is fed from the ditches of the nearby Lehmkuhlenbruch and its waters exit through a short ditch into the Tiefwarensee, from which it is only separated by a narrow isthmus and small road. The location between two lakes was the occasion for the origin of the name of the Waren quarter of Werdersiedlung.\nWhilst small gardens are ranged along its southern shore, the Melzer See is bordered to the northwest by meadowland. It lies entirely within the protected area of the Torgelower See. Visitors can walk around the lake on a two-kilometre-long footpath. The Ice Age Trail along theTiefwarensee also runs past the Melzer See."
