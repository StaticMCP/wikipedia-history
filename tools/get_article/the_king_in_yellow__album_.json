It was released digitally on the band's website in 2011; a CD release followed shortly thereafter.\nProduction\nThe band started working on new material after their reunion in 2008. The album was recorded in two weekend sessions in November and December 2010 at South Street Sounds and Miner Street Studios. In February 2011, the album was mixed at Miner Street Studios by Brian McTear.\nCritical reception\nThe Chicago Reader wrote: \"Their jangled guitars, their bitingly witty lyrics, their snotty Philly accents, their playful and iconoclastic version of hardcore—a reminder of a time when it actually had a sense of humor—make it clear what you've been missing in the years since.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"The King in Yellow / William Bloat\" - 3:48\n# \"Fauxhemia\" - 2:41\n# \"She's Affected\" - 2:02\n# \"Caitlin Childs\" - 3:33\n# \"Meaningless Upbeat Happy Song\" - 1:18\n# \"Hangman\" - 2:20\n# \"Cold Hard Ground\" - 3:22\n# \"Some Young Guy\" - 1:44\n# \"Or Maybe It Is\" - 1:30\n# \"Passport to Depravity\" - 2:13\n# \"Quality of Death\" - 2:18\n# \"Buried In The Sky\" - 2:36\n# \"13th Century Boy\" - 1:57\n# \"Commodify Your Dissent\" - 2:51\n# \"Can't Relax\" - 2:54\n# \"Melora Says\" - 2:28\n# \"Solvents (For Home and Industry)\" - 3:53\nPersonnel\n;The Dead Milkmen\n*Joe Genaro – guitar, vocals\n*Rodney Linderman – vocals, keyboards\n*Dean Sabatino – drums\n*Dan Stevens – bass\nReferences"
