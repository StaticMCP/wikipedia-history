The event took place on 10 October 2018.\nNominations for the awards were open until 12 July 2018 and finalists were announced on 3 September 2018.\nQueensland Minister for Women, Di Farmer said \"Women make up almost half of Australians with a music qualification and half of those studying music – yet only one-fifth of songwriters are women. Women hold only 28 per cent of senior and strategic roles in key industry associations and female artists earn less in general than their male counterparts. I congratulate the Australian Women in Music Awards committee for their work towards encouraging more girls and women in to the music industry.\"\nAWMA Honour Roll\n* Helen Reddy\nLifetime Achievement Awards\n* Patricia Amphlett (Little Pattie), Renée Geyer & Margret RoadKnight.\nNominees and winners\nAWMA Awards\nWinners indicated in boldface, with other nominees in plain.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=\"100%\"\n|+Full list of nominees\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Educator Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Diversity in Music Award\n|-\n|\n*Dr Anita Collins\n**Louise Denson\n**Elizabeth Sellars\n|\n*Mission Songs Project\n**Rachel Maria Cox\n**Signal Creative\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Auriel Andrew Memorial Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Studio Production Award\n|-\n|\n*Deborah Cheetham\n**Jessie Lloyd\n**Shellie Morris\n**Tiddas\n**Gina Williams\n|\n*Anna Laverty\n**Kath Naunton\n**Becki Whitton\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Live Production Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Music Leadership Award\n|-\n|\n*Robyn Jelleff\n**Lynette Britten\n**Kait Hall\n|\n*Jen Cloher\n**Linda Bosidis\n**Susan Heymann\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Songwriter Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Breakthrough Artist Award\n|-\n|\n*Sophie Payten (Gordi)\n**Sarah Blasko\n**Ngaiire\n|\n*Camp Cope\n*Amy Shark\n**Stella Donnelly\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Music Photographer Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Film-maker Award\n|-\n|\n*Wendy McDougall\n**Tashi Hall\n**Lisa Businovski\n|\n*Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore\n**Gemma Lee\n**Ruth Morris\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Artistic Excellence Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Creative Leadership Award\n|-\n|\n*Ngaiire\n**Dallas Frasca\n**Sophie Payten (Gordi)\n|\n*Zoe Hauptmann\n**Katie Noonan\n**Roz Pappalardo\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Musical Excellence Award\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"|\n|-\n|\n*Lydia Davies, Nerida Tyson-Chew\n**Fem Belling\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
