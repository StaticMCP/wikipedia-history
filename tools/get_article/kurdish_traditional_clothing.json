The traditions typically vary across different regions and tribes of Kurdistan, but it has some common elements. Historically, Kurdish clothing was more complex and varied, but it has evolved to a simpler form over time. It is also prominently worn during festivals and special occasions such as Newroz.\nHistory\nOne of the earliest description of Kurds having a particular way of dressing is attested by 13th century historian Ibn Khallikan. The Kurds were described to have dressed a clothing made of cotton, and wearing the mandil hat. The mandil hat is a long piece of cloth that is rolled several times around the head to form the turban, or handkerchief that replaces it.\nMen's clothing\nThe traditional clothing of Kurdistan can be categorized into three main types for men.\nNorthern Kurdish\n1899]]\nTraditional northern Kurdish clothing is tight-fitting and resembles rural Turkish attire as well as Balkan costumes. The trousers feature tight lower legs and a loose, baggy crotch that can extend to knee length. Neck scarves are commonly worn, and waistcoats over shirts are typical. The headgear (Jamana) varies, with options like loose turbans, skullcaps, or a mix of both, and is generally modest in size. In some tribal groups, the shirts have distinctive funnel-shaped sleeves.\nCentral Kurdish\n1894]]\nThe traditional Central Kurdish clothing, known as Şal û Şepik, is widely recognized in Iraqi Kurdistan and southern Turkish Kurdistan, including Hakkari Province. It is also named after the region where it is worn, such as Badinani, Hakkari, or Rewanduzi. This style consists of a fitted collarless jacket, open to the waist, tucked into gathered trousers that flare to the ankle. The suit is often embroidered, with colors ranging from striped browns and creams to self-colored stripes. The white shirt with funnel sleeves is often worn, with the sleeves usually wound around the outside of the jacket arms. A sash, often large but now less substantial, is worn around the waist and can be tied in elaborate ways, traditionally storing small personal items. Headdresses vary by tribe but usually consist of a turban made from a coiled chequered scarf around a skullcap, available in many shapes and colors. The turban has no hanging tail and can be removed and replaced without untying. Favored scarf colors are black, gray, and white, except for the Barzani tribe and Yezidis, who wear red and white check.\nSouthern Kurdish\nThe most common outfit, southern Kurdish clothing, is now widely used as a standard Kurdish costume across different regions. It was commonly worn by the Peshmerga. The attire includes baggy trousers, gathered at the waist and tapered at the ankle. The jacket is similar to the Central Kurdish style but lacks embroidery. The suits are usually in solid colors, sometimes with pinstripes. A sash of varying lengths and widths is worn around the waist. Headdresses vary by region but typically include a skullcap and a large, fringed square scarf worn as a turban. The scarf is often draped loosely, with a tail hanging down and fringes covering part of one eye.\nWomen's clothing\nThe traditional clothing of Kurdistan can be categorized into four main types for women. The East Anatolian type, now rare in Turkey, is still worn by Kurds in Khorasan, Iran, descendants of tribes deported in the 17th century. The Badinani or Hakkari costume is found in Southern Turkish Kurdistan, the Badinan region of Iraqi Kurdistan, and parts of northwestern Iran. The Sorani dress, the most widespread, is worn by Kurds living in the central and southern areas of Kurdistan. The Mahabad–Saqqez style is specific to the area between these two towns in Iranian Kurdistan and is notable for its distinct regional identity.\nSee also\n* Jamana, Kurdish headgear\n* Kurdish culture\n* Kurdish dance\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links"
