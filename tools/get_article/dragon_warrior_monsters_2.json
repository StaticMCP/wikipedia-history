It is the second Dragon Warrior Monsters game for the Game Boy Color and features two different versions of the same game, ''Cobi's Journey (released as Dragon Quest Monsters 2 - Maruta No Fushigi Na Kagi - Ruka no Tabidachi in Japan) and Tara's Adventure (released as Dragon Quest Monsters 2: Maruta No Fushigi Na Kagi - Iru no Bouken in Japan). Both games were remade in 2002 for the PlayStation in a compilation game called Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2 and released only in Japan. The Nintendo 3DS version combined both games into one and was released only in Japan in 2014 with the title '''Dragon Quest Monsters 2: Iru and Luca's Marvelous Mysterious Key'. The 3DS version was later brought to iOS, Android on August 6, 2020, in Japan.\nGameplay\nDragon Warrior Monsters 2 allows the player to form a team of monsters to train and use in combat. Depending on which version of the game players buy, ''Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Cobi's Journey or Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Tara's Adventure, they control either Cobi or Tara, but the titles are nearly identical in gameplay and story. Both games, however, possess unique collections of monsters and magic keys. Instead of the original games focus on randomized dungeons, this title focuses on static ones with tasks to complete, though randomized dungeons are still available for exploration.\nThe player can have three monsters out at a time, and the rest remain at the siblings fathers ranch. To catch monsters, players must encounter them and entice them by offering them food and treats, and at the end of battle if it has been won over will join the player. If players give the monsters they have caught food and affection, it makes them more likely to follow specific commands during battle. Monsters also learn skills over time through battle. Monsters can also be bred by taking any level 10 male and female monster pair to Professor Monster at the Starry Shrine, after which their offspring appears and the parents disappear.\nAfter the game story ends, players are free to find more magic keys and unlock more worlds for monster finding and breeding, as well as searching out new items. There are over three hundred monsters from eleven families to collect, including some from the then recently released Dragon Quest VII.\nThe game has Game Boy link cable support to facilitate two player battles against each other or together against the games AI, as well as allowing monster trading with players who had either version of the game. During player versus player combat, there is a possibility of stealing some of the other players monsters. To get all the keys available in the game, players must link up with another player playing the other version of the game. With the keys from the other title, all of the available worlds can be unlocked in the players own game. The PlayStation compilation featured improved graphics, new scenarios, and the ability to upload monsters players have caught to the i-Mode cellular version of the original Dragon Quest Monsters''.\n3DS Version\nThe Nintendo 3DS remake had new gameplay features such as a total of 800 monsters, allowed four monsters in a party, and featured several “G size” giant monsters. Players can also do a scout attack to see their probability of catching the monsters they encounter.\nThe remake also has a new way to breed monsters to be powerful; “S.S.” level faster than before called “New Life Fusion”. A system of creating your own monsters was also included, with players able to mix and match four different parts of a monsters body to create a custom one.\nPlayers can also make use of Nintendos StreetPass system of fighting over WiFi, either sending their party out to fight another player, or downloading another players party to fight against without them. There is also a special monster called Dracky StreetPass users can find, and players can also customize their character avatars with different clothing options.\nPlot\nCobi and Tara are both in a family of monster breeders who have come to the island of Greatlog to make a living by opening a monster ranch. However, there is soon conflict with the island's prince Kameha and a character from the original Dragon Quest Monsters named Warubou who is his assistant. Because of this duo's bad behavior, the island begins to sink, and Cobi or Tara must explore five different worlds to find magic keys, and the plug, to save the island. In the Nintendo 3DS remake, the citizens are disturbed by a new threat after the original story ends, with the siblings having to find the “Ultimate Key” to open the door to two new worlds called “New World” and the “Legendary Demonlords” with gigantic and powerful enemies.\nDevelopment\nThe games used the largest cartridge available for the Game Boy Color game system, which was four megabytes. Enix developer John Lawrence stated that Enix wanted to give players options in Dragon Quest Monsters 2 where they could play the game as a solo RPG, but created two parts of the game to encourage players to have a social experience of playing together like an enhanced version of the original Dragon Quest Monsters or like Pokemon.\nThe 3DS remake was demonstrated at Jump Fiesta 2014 with a playable demo and trailer.\nReception\n(''Tara's Adventure) 81%\n|rev1=Famitsu\n|rev1Score=9/10, 8/10, 8/10, 9/10\n| IGN = 9 of 10\n| NP = 3.5/5\n|rev2=RPGFan\n|rev2Score=79%\n}}\nDragon Warriors Monsters 2 was released in Japan on March 9, 2001.\nThe week it was released, the game was the number one selling game in Japan and sold 501,081 copies.
