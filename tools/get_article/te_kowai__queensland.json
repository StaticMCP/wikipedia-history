The name was shortened and the Māori definite article \"Te\" added.\nThe Te Kowai sugar mill was established in 1874 at  and operated until 1894 when it amalgamated with the Palms Mill.\nTe Kowai State School opened on 13 November 1883 and closed in December 1968. It was at 5 Te Kowai Foulden Road ().\nConstructed on the Mackay railway line, initially from Mackay to Eton, commenced on 14 November 1883 and was completed on 10 August 1885. In Te Kowai it followed the route of the present-day Peak Downs Highway with the Te Kowai railway station at . The line closed in 2009.\nTe Kowai Presbyterian Church opened on 8 December 1918.\nDemographics\nIn the , Te Kowai had a population of 218 people.\nIn the , Te Kowai had a population of 227 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Te Kowai. The nearest government primary schools are Dundula State School in neighbouring Bakers Creek to the south-west, Walkerston State School in Walkerston to the west, and Mackay West State School in West Mackay to the north-east. The nearest government secondary school is Mackay State High School in South Mackay to the east.\nFacilities\nMackay South Water Recycling Facility (also known as Bakers Creek Water Treatment Plant) is a sewage treatment plant  at the western end of Temples Lane (). Operated by the Mackay Regional Council, the plant processes waste water from 63,000 people. It provides high quality recycled water for irrigation as required by farmers (reducing drawdown of groundwater) with any remaining water being discharged into Bakers Creek. As the water is high in nutrients, it is better for the environment to use it on crops than to add it to the nutrient load of the creek. The sludge that remains after processing is centrifuged to remove remaining water and the solid waste is sold as nutrient-rich compost for farms.\nWeather Station\nTe Kowai weather station is a weather station at Te Kowai, operated by the Bureau of Meteorology. This weather station does not run on weekends and public holidays.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF; height:17;\" | Month\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Jan\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Feb\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Mar\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Apr\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | May\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Jun\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Jul\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Aug\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Sep\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Oct\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Nov\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Dec\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Year\n|- Align=\"center\"\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF; height:16;\" | Average max. temperature°C\n| style=\"background: #FF8C00;\" | 30.9\n| style=\"background: #FF8C00;\" | 30.4\n| style=\"background: #FF9900;\" | 29.5\n| style=\"background: #FFA500;\" | 27.9\n| style=\"background: #FFCC66;\" | 25.7\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99;\" | 23.7\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99;\" | 23.4\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99;\" | 24.6\n| style=\"background: #FFCC66;\" | 26.8\n| style=\"background: #FFCC66;\" | 29.0\n| style=\"background: #FFA500;\" | 30.3\n| style=\"background: #FF9900;\" | 31.3\n| style=\"background: #FFA500;\" | 27.8\n|- Align=\"center\"\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Average min. temperature°C\n| style=\"background: #FFA500;\" | 21.9\n| style=\"background: #FFA500;\" | 21.9\n| style=\"background: #FFCC66;\" | 20.7\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99;\" | 18.1\n| style=\"background: #FFFFCC;\" | 14.7\n| style=\"background: #FFFFCC;\" | 11.6\n| style=\"background: #FFFFCC;\" | 10.1\n| style=\"background: #FFFFCC;\" | 10.8\n| style=\"background: #FFFFCC;\" | 13.4\n| style=\"background: #FFFFCC;\" | 16.6\n| style=\"background: #FFFF99;\" | 19.2\n| style=\"background: #FFCC66;\" | 20.8\n| style=\"background: #FFFFCC;\" | 16.6\n|- Align=\"center\"\n!style=\"background:#FFFFFF\" | Rainfallmm\n| style=\"background:  #FFFFFF;\"| 341.3\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 346.5\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 277.5\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 144.3\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 92.3\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 61.3\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 36.0\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 30.0\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 28.2\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 45.6\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 83.2\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 180.0\n| style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\" | 1666.8\n|-\n| colspan=\"14\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;\"|Source: Bureau of Meteorology\n|}\nReferences"
