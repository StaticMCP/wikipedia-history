The show used non-canon humor as one of the two main characters dies at the end of each episode, only to reappear alive the following episode as if nothing had happened. The show ran for only 8 out of 13 episodes and was broadcast on USA Network from July 23 until September 24, 2000.\nSummary\nKennedy Smith, a super secret agent, just wants to retire. Unfortunately, his seemingly indestructible nemesis, Kriegman, wants to make his life hell and so moves into the suburbs and becomes Smith's next-door neighbor and evil opponent.\nCast\n* Linden Ashby as Kennedy Smith\n* Damian Young as Allan Kriegman\n* Susan Walters as Lili Smith\n* Tara Rosling as Barbara Bush\n* Nicole Dicker as Ellis Smith\n* Mark Rendall as Lucas Smith\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No.\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|}\nExternal links\n*"
