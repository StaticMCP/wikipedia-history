Two tram engines were obtained from Kitson and Company.\nThe tramway went into liquidation in 1897 and was purchased for £2,100 () by the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway. They invested in the tramway providing some additional passenger vehicles and a new steam tramway engine. A new depot was constructed in Portstewart by the railway engineer Berkeley Deane Wise in 1899, at the southern end of the promenade, opposite the Town Hall.\nIt became part of the Midland Railway in 1903, and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923.\nClosure\nThe service ceased on 30 January 1926. A replacement bus service was provided by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway\nPreserved locomotives\n*Tram engine 1 is preserved at the Streetlife Museum of Transport Hull\n*Tram engine 2 is in the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum\nReferences"
