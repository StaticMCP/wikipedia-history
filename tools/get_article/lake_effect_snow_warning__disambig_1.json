The criteria for amounts may vary significantly over different county warning areas. On October 2, 2017, some National Weather Service Forecast Offices discontinued issuing the Lake Effect Snow Warning, and consolidated it with the Winter Storm Warning. On October 15, 2018, the National Weather Service discontinued issuing Lake Effect Snow Warnings nationwide all together, and all offices consolidated it with the Winter Storm Warning. Lake effect snow warnings were reinstated for the 2019&ndash;20 winter season.\nEnvironment Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada issues similar warnings but they are called snowsquall warnings.\nExamples\n879\nWWUS41 KBUF 171935\nWSWBUF\nURGENT - WINTER WEATHER MESSAGE\nNational Weather Service Buffalo NY\n235 PM EST Tue Dec 17 2019\nNYZ006-180345-\n/O.NEW.KBUF.LE.W.0001.191218T1400Z-191219T0000Z/\nOswego-\nIncluding the city of Oswego\n235 PM EST Tue Dec 17 2019\n...LAKE EFFECT SNOW WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM TO 7 PM EST\nWEDNESDAY...\n* WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow expected.
