A Democrat, he was a representative from Massachusetts's 2nd congressional district.\nEarly life and education\nBoland's father was an Irish immigrant railroad worker.  Boland was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and graduated from Springfield Central High School in 1928. He attended Bay Path Institute and Boston College Law School.\nMilitary service\nHe served in the United States Army during World War II.\nPolitical career\nRonald Reagan attending a St. Patrick's Day luncheon hosted by Speaker Tip O'Neill, House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, and Boland]]\nHe was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1939 to 1940 and was the Hampden County register of deeds from 1941 to 1952.\nBoland was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1952. Congressman Boland was in office during the closing of the Springfield Armory in 1968, and was harshly criticized for his inability to prevent its closure. This failure resulted in a challenge to Boland in 1968 by Springfield Mayor Charles V. Ryan. Boland was re-elected handily with significant help from the family of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy in what was to be the last challenge to Boland by a major contender. Boland's most famous work as a congressman was the 1982 Boland Amendment, which blocked certain funding of the Contras in Nicaragua after the Central Intelligence Agency had supervised acts of sabotage without notifying Congress. Boland lived in a Washington apartment with fellow Massachusetts Congressman Tip O'Neill (whose wife remained in Massachusetts) until 1977.\nBoland announced in April 1988 that he would not run for a 19th term later that year; he never lost an election in 50 years as an elected official. Earlier, he'd tipped off Springfield mayor Richard Neal about his pending retirement, allowing Neal to get a significant head start in fundraising. Neal would be unopposed for the Democratic nomination–the real contest in this heavily Democratic district–and has held this seat, now numbered as the 1st district, ever since.\nPersonal life and death\nBoland married at the age of 62, fathering four children. Boland died in 2001 at the age of 90 from natural causes.\nSee also\n* 1935–1936 Massachusetts legislature\n* 1937–1938 Massachusetts legislature\n* 1939 Massachusetts legislature\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
