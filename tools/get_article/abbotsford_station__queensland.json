The block was balloted on the 7 November 1912 off the Stamfordham block of the home station of Katandra. It was the western portion of the block called Sloane Creek, so named after the creek that runs through the block and into the Flinders River. This block also had a sub-artesian bore (completed in 1904) which was situated centrally on the land making it the prime block in the 1912 ballot process.\nAbbotsford Station is situated  south-west of Hughenden, and  west of Stamford which is situated on the Hughenden-Winton Road (Kennedy Developmental Road).\nThe successful applicant for the block was Charles John Burdekin (Chas) Abbott (born 8 February 1878) whose family had land interests in Charters Towers at Fanning River and Ingham at Elma Grove.\nSee also\n*List of ranches and stations\nReferences\n*Fox, M.J.
