It contains one DH (DBL-homology) domain, one PDZ domain, two PH domains and one Ras-binding RBD domain.\nFunction\nTIAM1 modulates the activity of Rho GTP-binding proteins and connects extracellular signals to cytoskeletal activities. In addition, TIAM1 activates Rac1, CDC42, and to a lesser extent RhoA.\nClinical significance\nTIAM1 is found in virtually all tumor cell lines examined including B- and T-lymphomas, neuroblastomas, melanomas and carcinomas.\nInteractions\nT-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis-inducing protein 1 has been shown to interact with ANK1, Myc, RAC1 and PPP1R9B.\nTiam1 interacts also with para-cingulin, that plays a role in recruiting Tiam1 to junctions and thus activate Rac1 at epithelial junctions.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
