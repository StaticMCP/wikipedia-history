      "text": "# Star Wars Pez__disambig_1\n\nA 'Star Wars Pez' is a Pez candy dispenser themed after the Star Wars movies, and is one of the company's most prominent merchandising deals. Approximately 100 dispensers have been released on the market from 1997 to 2023, among the many collectibles spawned by the franchise.\nThe extreme interest of marketing executives in all things Star Wars has spawned a scholarly interest in the \"materializing fantasy media\" such as these Pez dispensers. It has also led to several museums to feature such Stars Wars memorabilia in their exhibits and/or gift shops, as well as media attention on this fairly odd phenomenon.\nIn museum exhibits and gift shops\nIn recent years, several museums around the United States have featured Star Wars Pez in their exhibits and/or gift shops. These products are displayed and exhibited because they are classic Americana. Despite the dispensers' \"popularity and cult status,\" the manufacturer's original factory in Austria does not give tours or sell fancifully-shaped memorabilia. Only in January 2012, Star Wars dispensers are prominently displayed at the company's new North American headquarters in Orange, Connecticut. One travelogue wrote, \"The company has been making the cartoonish plastic heads for 60 years now, representing everything from Star Wars to U.S. presidents to the Geico chameleon.\"\nThe Clayton Historical Museum, in Clayton, California opened a new exhibit on the history of candy manufacture in January 2012 that featured these confectionery dispensers.\nPez with Star Wars characters have been featured prominently in the Star Wars Museum in Maryland. The Star Wars Pez dispensers are pictured on a fan website, which describes them as \"some Candy Heads from 1980.\"\nThe Pacific Science Center sold Pez at a popular exhibit about Star Wars.\nThese branded dispensers were among the \"top sellers\" at the gift shop at the Burlingame Museum of Pez Memorabilia, in Burlingame, California. The museum also displayed \"a whole lot of Star Wars Pez,\" in Plexiglas displays. The Burlingame \"unofficial shrine\" to the collectibles was unaffiliated with Pez Candy, Inc., and the manufacturer sued the Burlingame museum in 2009 for copyright infringement. There was a notorious, giant Pez sculpture of C-3PO and Chewbacca locked in a slash fiction kiss. The museum closed in 2019.\nAnother Pez museum in Easton, Pennsylvania also has featured prominently their obligatory Star Wars memorabilia, (\"Of course, we had to include the Star Wars Pez Dispensers\"), including an oversize Darth Vader figurine. This museum closed to the public in 2012.\nOther influences\nCarrie Fisher's \"Princess Leia Pez dispenser\" is one of the \"merchandising horrors\" she discusses in her one-woman show Wishful Drinking.\nThese candy dispensers are featured prominently in the 2010 Emmy Award-winning fan film, Star Wars Uncut.\nStar Wars Pez has a gateway drug-like effect for some young collectors. One fan of Pez dispensers started her huge horde with Star Wars figurines at the age of three. Another fan calls Pez dispensers generally \"a gateway drug to hardcore collecting\". Pezheads shopping for new dispensers frequently place Star Wars first on their shopping lists.\nChronology of releases\nFive Star Wars Pez were released in 1997:\n* Darth Vader\n* Yoda\n* Chewbacca (first version)\n* C-3PO\n* Stormtrooper (first version)\nFour Star Wars Pez were released in 1998 in advance of the May 19, 1999 premier of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace:\n* Luke Skywalker\n* Princess Leia\n* Wicket the Ewok\n* Boba Fett (first version)\nA Jar Jar Binks Pez Hander battery operated toy was released in 1999.\nThree Star Wars Pez were released in 2002 for Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones:\n* Jango Fett\n* Clone Trooper\n* R2-D2\nIn 2003 Pez released three Limited Edition Collectable Crystal Star Wars dispensers:\n* Darth Vader\n* Yoda\n* C-3PO\n14 Giant Pez were released in 2005 to commemorate Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith:\n* Darth Vader\n* Clone Trooper\n* R2-D2\n* C-3PO\n* Death Star\n* Chewbacca\n* Yoda\n* General Grievous\n* Emperor Palpatine\n* Darth Vader (Metal Vader)\n* Yoda (Crystal Yoda)\n* C-3PO (Metal C-3PO)\n* Chewbacca (Bronze Chewbacca)\n* General Grievous (Pearl Grievous)\nPez also released five standard-size dispensers in 2005 for the Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith movie release:\n* Emperor Palpatine\n* General Grievous\n* Death Star (first version)\n* Chewbacca (second version)\n* Emperor Palpatine (glow-in-the-dark version, Walmart exclusive)\nWalmart released an exclusive limited edition gift set in 2005 containing nine Star Wars Pez dispensers previously available individually.
