Both teams carried their names forward from their North American Soccer League (NASL) predecessors. However, the rivalry is also geographical as the two cities are based on the West Coast.\nClub namesakes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!width=\"200\"|Major League Soccer\n!width=\"200\"|North American Soccer League\n|-\n|San Jose Earthquakes\n|San Jose Earthquakes\n|-\n|Seattle Sounders FC\n|Seattle Sounders\n|}\nHistory\nCup history\nThe Heritage Cup trophy was conceived and designed by San Jose Earthquakes fan Rob Stevenson and was commissioned by San Jose's Soccer Silicon Valley Community Foundation in collaboration with Seattle Sounders FC supporters. The competition began in 2009 when the expansion Seattle began play, becoming the second MLS team named after their North American Soccer League counterpart – San Jose having been the first when they inherited the Earthquakes name in time for the 2000 season.\nMLS times\nThe original Earthquakes and Sounders sides did have a rivalry while playing in the NASL. However, it did not completely resurface during the 2009 season with fans of both teams viewing other clubs as bigger rivals. That season, the first MLS meeting of the teams was not considered for the competition due to the schedule consisting of two games in Seattle and only one in San Jose. Seattle won the initial meeting at home 2&ndash;0 and the second 2&ndash;1. The San Jose Earthquakes won the inaugural cup on goals scored after a 4&ndash;0 home victory on August 2, 2009.\nPresent and future MLS teams that carry on the name of their market's NASL predecessors are eligible to join the competition. However, when the Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps FC became eligible to compete for the cup upon joining the league in 2011, both teams' supporters elected not to participate.  They left open the possibility of joining if a couple of additional eligible teams join MLS, thereby better differentiating the Heritage Cup from the Cascadia Cup.\nThe 2012 MLS Season brought an unbalanced schedule for the first time since 2009. The rules to the cup therefore reverted to counting only the last two matches between the teams, the way it will be counted in any season that has an unbalanced schedule.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 the organizers sent out the following proposal:\nGentlemen,\nHere is the latest information for you about the 2020 Heritage Cup, the annual competition between San Jose and Seattle. The Quakes have not won the Cup since 2015, while Seattle displayed the Cup and used it in-stadium to promote their anniversary last year.\nAs you know, the Heritage Cup is a joint operation between San Jose fans and some Sounders fans. This year presents a special challenge and we could only come up with one viable option, which is to use the July 10 San Jose vs Seattle game in Orlando as the Heritage Cup game for 2020. We delayed until now to arrange this, hoping to hear about the league schedule, but that didn't happen. So this will be a one-game competition, on neutral ground.\nWe hope that this might also help the MLS Is Back tournament as well. If you can help us get information about this game and the Heritage Cup to MLS and especially to the ESPN producers and broadcast team as quickly as possible, this might be an additional storyline they can use in their telecast to add a little more drama to the game.\nThe match ended in a 0–0 draw and the San Jose Earthquakes, group B winners in the MLS is Back Tournament, were awarded the Heritage Cup for 2020.\nFor 2021 there was an unbalanced three-game regular season schedule between the two competing MLS teams. The Heritage Cup was awarded based on the results of the final two of three matches of each participating team, with each team hosting one match, namely the July 31 match hosted by Seattle Sounders FC and the September 29 match hosted by San Jose Earthquakes. Seattle regained the Cup with their 3–1 victory in San Jose.\nStatistics\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2 width=40%|Competition\n!rowspan=2 width=15%|Matches\n!colspan=2 width=30%|Wins\n!rowspan=2 width=15%|Draws\n|-\n!
