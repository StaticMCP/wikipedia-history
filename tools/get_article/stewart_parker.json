At Queen’s University Belfast in the early 1960s, he was a founding member of the Belfast Writers’ Group  convened by Philip Hobsbaum, along with Seamus Heaney. But his long-term passion was theatre. Having been influenced as a schoolboy by the visionary teacher John Malone, he immersed himself in student drama as an undergraduate. His studies were interrupted for a time when he was diagnosed with a bone cancer that resulted in the amputation of his left leg. Parker later captured this experience in his novel Hopdance, edited by his biographer Marilynn Richtarik and published posthumously in 2017.\nAfter embarking on an MA at Queen’s, he married Kate Ireland in 1964  and immediately left Belfast for the United States, where for several years he taught English literature at Hamilton College and Cornell University in upstate New York. His five years in the US coincided with seismic cultural events, including the Civil Rights Movement and protests against the Vietnam War.\nParker’s return to Ireland in 1969 coincided with another historical watershed: the outbreak of the conflict known as the Troubles, which reawakened the barely dormant tensions between the Protestant and Catholic traditions in the partition state of Northern Ireland. This conflict shaped the core of Parker’s work as a dramatist, which began as a features writer for BBC radio.\nCareer\nParker’s playwriting career began in earnest when his play Spokesong was the runaway success of the 1975 Dublin Theatre Festival. A production the following year in London at the Kings Head Theatre subsequently transferred to the West End. The play was then produced at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1978  and by New York City’s Circle in the Square Theatre in 1979, as well as in numerous other venues around the world.\nParker’s second play, Catchpenny Twist, was produced by the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in 1977, which also produced Nightshade, his exploration of death and dying conveyed through the prism of stage magic, in 1980. By this time, Parker had also established himself as a television dramatist, with the BBC Play for Today series airing Catchpenny Twist in 1977, the same year it premiered on stage. In 1979, Parker’s television play I'm a Dreamer Montreal, produced by Thames Television, won the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize.\nThe history of Ireland was one of Parker’s chief sources of dramatic material. Heavenly Bodies, commissioned by the Birmingham Rep, centred on the 19th-century theatrical entrepreneur Dion Boucicault and focused on the complexities of Irish national identity and literary recognition. Northern Star, produced by the Lyric Theatre, Belfast in 1984, is the story of the United Irishmen and the doomed Rebellion of 1798, told through the life of Belfast revolutionary Henry Joy McCracken. Uniting political and theatre history, the narrative is developed through at least seven different ages or styles of Irish theatre, from George Farquhar to Samuel Beckett.\nParker moved from Belfast to Edinburgh in 1978. His marriage ended shortly after a subsequent move to London, in 1982. His partnership with television writer Lesley Bruce helped to make the last seven years of his life the most satisfying, both personally and creatively.\nField Day, the Derry-based theatre company co-founded by Stephen Rea and Brian Friel, asked Parker in  1983 to write for them; he eventually gave the company what many consider to be his most profound play. Pentecost is set during the Ulster Workers' Council strike of 1974, when the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was stopped in its tracks by an insurrection fostered by Loyalists aiming to derail the power-sharing government established by the Sunningdale Agreement.\nPentecost was received with a mixture of admiration  and scepticism  —in the wake of the Hunger Strikes and ongoing atrocities in Northern Ireland, it was hard to imagine the positive future suggested in the play.\nDeath\nStewart Parker developed cancer for the second time in 1988, and this time it proved fatal. He died that November, less than two weeks after his 47th birthday.\nLegacy\nIn the years since Parker’s death, his plays have been performed by the Tricycle Theatre in London and in Ireland by Tinderbox, Field Day, Belfast’s Lyric Theatre, the Abbey, and, most frequently, by Rough Magic Theatre Company, which took a revival of Pentecost to London’s Donmar Warehouse in 1995 and to the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, in 2000. Spokesong and Pentecost were revived in a co-production as a double bill by Rough Magic and the Lyric in 2008. Northern  Star was revived 2016 and performed in Dublin, Belfast, and Glasgow.\nAn annual award (The Stewart Parker Trust Award) for best Irish debut play was set up in his name after his death. Jointly funded by the Arts Council of Ireland and BBC Northern Ireland, there is a cash bursary as part of the award. Previous recipients of the award include: Conor McPherson, Mark O'Rowe, Enda Walsh, Eugene O'Brien, Gerald Murphy, Lisa McGee, Christian O'Reilly, Morna Regan, Gina Moxley and Meghan Tyler.\nIn 2008, a \"Commemorative Conference & Festival\" entitled Stewart Parker: the Northern Star hosted by Queen’s Drama Department, compiled and organised by lecturer in drama studies, Dr Mark Phelan, was held at Queen's University, Belfast.\nWork\nStage:\nSpokesong (1975)\nThe Actress and the Bishop (1976)\nCatchpenny Twist (1977)\nKingdom Come (an Irish/Caribbean musical, 1978)\nNightshade (1980)\nPratt’s Fall (1983)\nNorthern Star (1984)\nHeavenly Bodies (1986)\nPentecost (1987)\nTelevision:\nCatchpenny Twist (1977)\nI’m A Dreamer Montreal (1979)\nThe Kamikaze Ground Staff Reunion Dinner (1981)\nIris in the Traffic, Ruby in the Rain (1981)\nJoyce in June (1982)\nRadio Pictures (1985)\nLost Belongings (1986)\nFilm:\nBlue Money (1984)\nRadio:\nSpeaking of Red Indians (1967)\nMinnie and Maisie and Lily Freed (1971)\nSelf Portrait (1971)\nRequiem (1973)\nThe Iceberg (1975)\nI’m a Dreamer, Montreal (1977)\nThe Kamikaze Ground Staff Reunion Dinner (1979)\nThe Traveller (1985)\nPoetry:\nThe Casualty’s Meditation (1966)\nMaw (1967)\nPaddy Dies (2004)\nNovel:\nHopdance (2017)\nAwards\n1976 Evening Standard Award for Most Promising Playwright\n1979 Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize for I’m a Dreamer, Montreal (television version)\n1981 Giles Cooper Award for The Kamikaze Ground Staff Reunion Dinner (radio version)\n1987 Harvey’s Award for Best New Play for Pentecost\nPublications\nThe stage plays are published by Methuen Drama.
