South Carolina voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine.\nOut of 3.12 million registered voters, 2.10 million voted, a turnout of 67.86%. Trump continued the Republican tradition in South Carolina, carrying the state with 54.9% of the vote. Clinton received 40.7% of the vote, underperforming Barack Obama's 2012 performance by about 4%. Trump became the first Republican to win the White House without carrying Charleston County since Dwight Eisenhower in 1956.\nAs of 2024, this is the last time the Democratic candidate won Clarendon and Dillon counties.\nPrimary elections\nOn February 20 and 27, 2016, in the presidential primaries, South Carolina voters expressed their preferences for the Republican and Democratic parties' respective nominees for president. Registered members of each party could only vote in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated could choose any one primary in which to vote.\nDemocratic primary\n| next_election = 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary\n| next_year = 2020\n| image_size = 120px\n| image1 = Hillary Clinton by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| candidate1 = Hillary Clinton\n| home_state1 = New York\n| delegate_count1 = 39\n| popular_vote1 = 272,379\n| percentage1 = 73.44%\n| map_image = South Carolina Democratic Presidential Primary Election Results by County, 2016.svg\n| map_size = 250px\n| map_caption = South Carolina results by county\n| color1 = d4aa00\n| image2 = Bernie Sanders September 2015 cropped.jpg\n| candidate2 = Bernie Sanders\n| color2 = 228b22\n| home_state2 = Vermont\n| delegate_count2 = 14\n| popular_vote2 = 96,498\n| percentage2 = 26.02%\n}}\nThe 59 delegates for the Democratic National Convention from South Carolina are allocated in this way.

The remaining 21 delegates are allocated by giving the winner of each of the seven congressional districts 3 delegates.\nGreen state convention\nOn April 30, the Green Party of South Carolina held its state convention. The public was welcome, but only members and delegates were eligible to vote.\nOn April 30, it was announced that William Kreml had won the primary.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ South Carolina Green Party presidential convention, April 17, 2016\n|-\n!

From 1964 on, the Republican ticket has carried South Carolina in every election apart from 1976, when the state voted for Jimmy Carter, from neighboring Georgia. The state even spurned Southern Democrat Bill Clinton in both his elections, in each of which he carried several other Southern states. The state has not had a Democratic Senator since Ernest Hollings retired in 2005, and it has had a Republican majority in its Congressional delegation since the so-called \"Republican Revolution\" of 1994. Four years prior to the 2016 election, in 2012, Republican Mitt Romney defeated Barack Obama by 10.5%.\nHowever, in 2016 some commentators suggested that South Carolina might become a battleground state due to polling suggesting Republican dissatisfaction with Trump, as well as the growing effects of in-migration from other states (as in formerly solidly red Virginia and North Carolina). A poll released on August 10 by Public Policy Polling had Trump leading Clinton by a margin of only 2 points, and an internal poll commissioned for the South Carolina Democratic Party had the race tied. This led Larry Sabato's political prediction website Sabato's Crystal Ball to move the rating of the South Carolina contest from \"Safe Republican\" to \"Likely Republican\" on August 18. In the end, however, Trump carried the state by a comfortable 14.3% margin.\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Ranking\n!As of\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |Los Angeles Times\n|\n| November 6, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |CNN\n|\n|November 4, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Cook Political Report\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Electoral-vote.com\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n| align=left | Rothenberg Political Report\n|\n| November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |RealClearPolitics\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |NBC\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|}\n^Highest rating given\nPolling\nRepublican Donald Trump won every pre-election poll, but by varying margins.

South Carolina is allocated 9 electors because it has 7 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 9 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 9 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.\nThe electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 19, 2016, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.\nThe following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 9 were pledged for Trump/Pence.\n* Glenn McCall\n* Matt Moore\n* Terry Hardesty\n* Jim Ulmer\n* Brenda Bedenbaugh\n* Bill Conley\n* Shery Smith\n* Moye Graham\n* Jerry Rovner\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gop.com/the-official-guide-to-the-2016-republican-nominating-process/ RNC 2016 Republican Nominating Process]\n* [http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/ Green papers for 2016 primaries, caucuses, and conventions]"
