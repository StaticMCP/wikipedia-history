In her two terms as United States Senator from New York, the state with the largest population of Puerto Rican-Americans, she gained a strong degree of familiarity with the island. Those connections helped her build institutional support from top Puerto Rico Democrats, including then-Governor Alejandro García Padilla.\nNo other Democratic or Republican primaries took place on the same day. The Republican Party's  Puerto Rico primary took place on March 6, 2016.\nResults\nResults By Districts\n{|width=\"60%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"11%\" | County\n! width=\"10%\" | Clinton\n! width=\"10%\" | Votes\n! width=\"10%\" | Sanders\n! width=\"10%\" | Votes\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tSan Juan I\t        ||49.4%||        6,472|| 46.4%|| 6,080\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tBayamon II             ||56.9%||        6,525|| 42.7%|| 4,897\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tArecibo III            ||66.3%||\t 8,011|| 33.1%|| 4,004\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tMayagüez IV\t        ||57.6%||\t 5,756|| 41.8%|| 4,176\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tPonce V\t                ||65.7%||\t 6,472|| 32.5%|| 3,199\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tGuayama VI\t        ||61.8%||\t 6,574|| 28.6%|| 3,043\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tHumacao VII            ||61.6%||        4,960|| 37.8%|| 3,046\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D4AA00;\" |\tCarolina VIII         ||61.1%||\t 7,888|| 38.0%|| 4,923\n|-\n|                             |Total                                      ||59.7%||         52,658||   37.9%         ||33,368\n|}\nReferences"
