Released on August 17 and distributed by Def Jam Recordings, Hip Hop Music Awards 1999 is the first annual album produced by the magazine to focus on its nominees of the now-defunct award show, owing to the success of its Hip Hop Hits series. It features eighteen hip hop hits. It went to number 53 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart and peaked at number 45 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Three songs reached the number one position on the Hot Rap Tracks chart:  \"Deja Vu (Uptown Baby),\" \"It Ain't My Fault, Part 2\" and \"Superthug\". The original, unedited version of Eminem's \"My Name Is\" was accidentally included.\nTrack listing\n# \"Can I Get A...\" - Ja Rule, Jay-Z and Amil\n# \"Ha\" - Juvenile\n# \"My Name Is\" - Eminem\n# \"It Ain't My Fault, Pt. 2\" - Mystikal and Silkk the Shocker\n# \"Party Is Goin' on Over Here\" - Busta Rhymes\n# \"It's On\" - DJ Clue and DMX\n# \"I'll Bee Dat!\" - Redman\n# \"Superthug\" - Noreaga\n# \"Deja Vu (Uptown Baby)\" - Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz\n# \"Thug Girl\" - Master P\n# \"Is It You?
