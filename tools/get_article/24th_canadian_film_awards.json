Due to the number of categories, the ceremony was split into two events: non-feature, sponsored, and educational film awards were presented at a luncheon, while all other awards were presented at a gala banquet.  The ceremonies were fully bilingual and awards were divided equally between francophone and anglophone producers. The ceremony was hosted by broadcaster Jacques Fauteux.\nWinners\nFilms\n*Film of the Year: Not awarded\n*Feature Film: Wedding in White — Dermet Productions, John Vidette producer, William Fruet director\n*Documentary: Selling Out — Unit Productions, Tadeusz Jaworski director and producer\n*Theatrical Short: This Is a Photograph — National Film Board of Canada, Tom Daly producer, Albert Kish director\n*Animated: Dans la vie... — National Film Board of Canada, René Jodoin producer, Pierre Veilleux director\n*TV Drama: Françoise Durocher, Waitress — National Film Board of Canada, Pierre Duceppe and Jean-Marc Garand producers, André Brassard director\n*TV Information: Je chante à cheval avec Willie Lamothe — National Film Board of Canada - Paul Larose producer, Jacques Leduc and Lucien Ménard directors\n*Nature and Wildlife: Solitudes - 'Dan Gibson's Nature Family — Dan Gibson Productions, Dan Gibson producer and director\n*Travel and Recreation: Images de la Gaspésie' — Office du film du Québec, Jacques Parent producer, Jean-Claude Labrecque director, and\n:: 'Les Jeux D'été du Quebec MCMLXXI — Office du film du Québec, Jean Robitaille and Pierre Desmarchais directors\n*Public Relations: In Flight — Foster Advertising, Peter Gerretsen director\n*Sales Promotion: A Powerful Ally — Hydro Quebec, Nicholas Bornemisza director\n*Training and Instruction: Child Behaviour Equals You — Crawley Films, F.R.
