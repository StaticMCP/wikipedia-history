He made his debut for Bolton in an EFL Cup match against West Ham United. King signed for Scottish Premiership club St Mirren in June 2018, but was released in the following January. On November 13, 2024, he mutually agreed to terminate his contract with Swindon, there becoming a free agent.\nEarly life\nKing played for various Junior League sides in the Merseyside area; including The Mags, Warner Portcullis, The Celts and Connect.\nPlaying career\nNon-League\nKing played mostly for the youth team at Altrincham appearing regularly on the first team bench, but making his only first team appearance against Tranmere Rovers in the Cheshire Senior Cup. He had a brief loan spell at Prescot Cables from March 2014 until the end of the season, before returning to train with the Altrincham first team.\nKing moved to Nantwich Town in September 2014, whilst the club was in the midst of an injury crisis. He made his debut against Halesowen Town. In October 2014 he moved to Kendal Town. In January 2015, King moved to Trafford from Kendal Town, citing transportation difficulties.\nIn September 2015, King moved to Ashton United. In March 2016 he moved to Witton Albion. He played in the Mid-Cheshire Senior Cup final against 1874 Northwich which Witton lost 3–0. On 19 April 2016, King was charged by the FA with misconduct under Rule E3, allegedly using abusive, race-related language in a match played on 5 December 2015 whilst still at previous club Ashton United. He was subsequently suspended for five matches, fined £100 and ordered to complete an FA equality course.\nIn August 2016, King signed for Droylsden.\nBolton Wanderers\nBy November 2016, King was playing for Bolton's under-23 side. Bolton initially tried to register King's promotion to the first team in the 2016–17 season but due to a transfer embargo, the EFL prohibited the move. King extended his first professional contract with the club in July 2017. He joined the first team on a preseason trip to Scotland. Going into the season it seemed unlikely that King would receive any game time at Bolton, as the club were again restricted to a squad of only 23 professionals.\nOn 14 September 2017 the embargo was lifted and King was registered with the first team. He made his Bolton debut on 19 September 2017 in a loss against West Ham United in the third round of the EFL Cup, playing 80 minutes. He was released by Bolton at the end of the 2017–18 season.\nSt Mirren\nOn 22 June 2018, King signed a two-year contract with Scottish Premiership club St Mirren. He was released by St Mirren in January 2019.\nHalifax Town\nIn August 2019, King signed for National League club Halifax Town. On 16 August 2020, King signed a new one-year deal for Halifax. King left the club at the end of the 2020–21 season following a season where he won his side's player of the season award as well as being named in the league's official Team of the Season.\nChesterfield\nOn 24 June 2021, King agreed a deal to join fellow National League side Chesterfield. King earned a place in the 2022–23 National League Team of the Year.\nFollowing a title-winning campaign, King departed Chesterfield on a free transfer at the end of the 2023–24 season.\nSwindon Town\nOn 5 August 2024, King joined League Two side Swindon Town following a spell with the club as a trialist.\nYork City\nOn 13 November 2024, King joined National League leaders York City on a free transfer.\nOn 3 July 2025, King joined newly promoted National League side Boreham Wood on loan until January 2026.\nStyle of play\nKing was previously considered an attacking midfielder that can also cover the centre forward position, but since moving to Halifax he has been converted into a right wing back. He is known as a dead-ball specialist, with a large proportion of his goals occurring from set pieces.\nPersonal life\nHe is the nephew of former Altrincham player and manager John King.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! colspan=\"3\" |League\n! colspan=\"2\" |Cup\n! colspan=\"2\" |League Cup\n! colspan=\"2\" |Other\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Altrincham\n|2013–14\n|Conference North\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n| colspan=\"2\" |–\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|Nantwich Town\n|2014–15\n|NPL Premier Division\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n| colspan=\"2\" |–\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|Witton Albion\n|2015–16\n|NPL Division One North\n|8\n|2\n|0\n|0\n| colspan=\"2\" |–\n|1\n|0\n|9\n|2\n|-\n| valign=\"center\" |Bolton Wanderers\n|2017–18\n|Championship\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|-\n| valign=\"center\" |St Mirren\n|2018–19\n|Scottish Premiership\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|FC Halifax Town\n|2019–20\n|National League\n|32||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||36||0\n|-\n|2020–21\n|National League\n|35||7||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||2||0||38||7\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!67!!7!!2!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!5!!0!!74!!7\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Chesterfield\n|2021–22\n|National League\n|33||4||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||2||1||38||6\n|-\n|2022–23\n|National League\n|39||7||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||2||0||46||8\n|-\n|2023–24\n|National League\n|19||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0||20||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!91!!11!!8!!2!!0!!0!!5!!1!!104!!14\n|-\n|Swindon Town\n|2024–25\n|League Two\n|8||0||0||0||1||0||2||0||11||0\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Career total\n!176!!20!!10!!2!!5!!0!!14!!1!!205!!23\n|}\nHonours\nChesterfield\n*National League: 2023–24\nIndividual\n*National League Team of the Year: 2020–21, 2022–23\nReferences\n}}"
