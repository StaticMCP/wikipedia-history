The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado.\nSeason seven stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Jack Coleman as Blake and Alexis' earnest son Steven; Gordon Thomson as Blake and Alexis' eldest son Adam; Heather Locklear as Krystle's niece and Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo; Michael Nader as Alexis' husband Dex Dexter; Karen Cellini as Blake and Alexis' youngest daughter, Amanda; Diahann Carroll as Blake's half-sister Dominique Deveraux; Wayne Northrop as Blake's former chauffeur Michael Culhane; Ted McGinley as Clay Fallmont; and Joan Collins as Alexis Colby, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Adam, Fallon, Steven and Amanda. The season also features Christopher Cazenove as Blake's brother, Ben Carrington; Kate O'Mara as Alexis' sister Caress Morell; Terri Garber as Ben's daughter Leslie; Leann Hunley as Blake's secretary Dana Waring; and Cassie Yates as Sarah Curtis and old friend of Dex's. Though starring as Jeff Colby and Fallon Carrington on The Colbys, John James and Emma Samms each appeared in two episodes of season seven as these characters.\nDevelopment\nAlthough the first episode of season seven, \"The Victory\", premiered with a high Nielsen rating of a 20.1, it was overtaken by Magnum, P.I., now in the same time slot on CBS. Dynasty ultimately fell to #24 in the United States for the season.\nDuring the period between the production of seasons six and seven, Catherine Oxenberg vacated the role of Amanda Carrington, purportedly due to a salary dispute. Oxenberg's publicist insisted that the actress left Dynasty voluntarily, while several media outlets reported that she was fired. The role was immediately recast with Karen Cellini, who appeared for 13 episodes of the series' seventh season before the character was written out in the 1987 episode \"The Rig\".\nPlot\nAs the seventh season begins, Blake stops short of killing Alexis, who has taken all of his assets, including the mansion. Claudia has died in the fire she set at La Mirage, and Amanda (now played by Karen Cellini) is rescued by a returning Michael Culhane, Blake's chauffeur from the first season. Blake turns the tables on Ben and Alexis and recovers his wealth, but loses his memory after an oil rig explosion. Alexis finds Blake and, with everyone believing he is dead, perpetuates the belief that they are still married. Living with a clean slate, Alexis finds herself softening to Blake but ultimately tells him the truth as he reunites with Krystle. Krystina receives a heart transplant but is later temporarily kidnapped by Sarah Curtis, the mother of the girl from whom Krystina received her new heart; Sammy Jo's marriage to Clay crumbles and she falls into bed with Steven; Amanda leaves town; and Ben's daughter Leslie arrives. Adam's season-long romance with Blake's secretary Dana Waring culminates in a wedding, which is punctuated in the May 6, 1987 season finale by a car Alexis drove plunged off a bridge into a river and the violent return of a vengeful Matthew Blaisdel (Bo Hopkins).\nCast\nMain\n*John Forsythe as Blake Carrington\n*Linda Evans as Krystle Carrington\n*John James as Jeff Colby 7.6) and \"The Test\" ( 7.18).}}\n*Gordon Thomson as Adam Carrington\n*Emma Samms as Fallon Carrington Colby 7.1) and \"Romance\" ( 7.6).}}\n*Jack Coleman as Steven Carrington\n*Michael Nader as Dex Dexter\n*Heather Locklear as Sammy Jo Carrington\n*Ted McGinley as Clay Fallmont 7.25).}}\n*Terri Garber as Leslie Carrington 7.13), although she does not appear in \"A Love Remembered\" ( 7.14 & 7.15).}}\n* Cassie Yates as Sarah Curtis 7.19) to \"The Affair\" ( 7.27).}}\n* Leann Hunley as Dana Waring 7.4) before being added to the opening credits from \"The Surgery\" ( 7.20).}}\n*Christopher Cazenove as Ben Carrington\n*Karen Cellini as Amanda Carrington 7.13).}}\n*Wayne Northrop as Michael Culhane\n*Kate O'Mara as Caress Morell 7.7) to \"The Letter\" ( 7.10).}}\n*Diahann Carroll as Dominique Deveraux\n*Ricardo Montalbán as Zach Powers 7.8) only, credited as \"special guest star\".}}\n*Joan Collins as Alexis Carrington\nRecurring\n*William Beckley as Gerard\n*Virginia Hawkins as Jeanette Robbins\n*Richard Lawson as Nick Kimball\n*Paul Burke as Neal McVane\n*James Sutorious as Gordon Wales\n*Betty Harford as Hilda Gunnerson\n*Richard Anderson as Buck Fallmont\n*Troy Beyer as Jackie Deveraux\n*Patricia Crowley as Emily Fallmont\n*Kimberly Beck as Claire Prentice\n*Jon Cypher as Dirk Maurier\n*Alan Fudge as Phil Thorpe\n*Neil Dickson as Gavin Maurier\nNotable guest stars\n*Clyde Kusatsu as Dr. Chen\n*Linda Thorson as Dr. Mansfield\n*Bo Hopkins as Matthew Blaisdel\n;Cast notes\nEpisodes\nSeason two of The Colbys aired concurrently with Dynasty season seven.\n|OriginalAirDate=\n|ProdCode=DY-146\n|Aux4=20.1/31\n|ShortSummary= Blake's former chauffeur, Michael Culhane, returns and rescues Amanda, now played by Karen Cellini, from the fire at La Mirage, but the hotel is destroyed and Claudia dies in the blaze.
