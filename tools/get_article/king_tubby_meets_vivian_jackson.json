The second half is dub versions of those tracks, made by King Tubby.\nBackground and release\nIn 1975 Jackson and his vocal group The Prophets released their debut album Conquering Lion, which was popular in Jamaica and the UK.\nWalls of Jerusalem was first released in Jamaica in 1976, and was initially sold as an LP in a blank sleeve, in a print run of only 300 copies. Jackson later reissued the album on his label Prophet under the title King Tubby Meets Vivian Jackson. In 1977 record label Nationwide released the album in the UK as Chant Down Babylon, with alternate cover art and track names, and erroneously credited it to \"Yabby Youth\".\nIn 2019 Pressure Sounds reissued the album as Walls of Jerusalem on LP and CD. The reissue included a second disc of studio outtakes and dub versions.\nCritical reception\n}}\nJo-Ann Greene of AllMusic wrote that title track \"Walls Of Jerusalem\" is a \"stellar single, a major hit, and a song that helps make You's own religious beliefs clear.\" The Rough Guide to Reggae said that \"tracks like \"Walls Of Jerusalem\" and \"Chant Down Babylon\" are flawless, while the dubs are fully the equal of those on the classic Prophecy Of Dub set from Tubby.\"\nDavid Katz described the track \"Chant Down Babylon Kingdom\" as \"one of Yabby’s most forceful releases\".\nHe also described the album, and its follow-up Deliver Me From My Enemies,  as being of the same standard as Yabby You's debut, and as \"containing works of fearsome religious and political retribution, interspersed with the occasional love song.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Vivian Jackson – vocals, writing, production\n*Osbourne \"King Tubby\" Ruddock – arrangements\nOther credits\n*Clinton Fearon, Lloyd Parks, Robbie Shakespeare – bass\n*Anthony \"Benbow\" Creary, Carlton \"Santa\" Davis, Lowell \"Sly\" Dunbar – drums\n*Tommy McCook – flute\n*Albert Griffiths, Earl \"Chinna\" Smith, Earl \"Wire\" Lindo – guitar\n*Bobby Ellis, Herman Marquis, Tommy McCook – horns\n*Ansel Collins, Bernard \"Touter\" Harvey, Earl \"Wire\" Lindo – keyboards\n*Noel \"Scully\" Simms – percussion\nTechnical\n*Carlton Lee, Anthony \"Crucial Bunny\" Graham, Ernest Hoo Kim, Errol \"ET\" Thompson, King Tubby, Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Pat Kelly, Sylvan Morris – engineering\n*Dave Blackman – mastering\nArtistic\n*Happening, Theo Bafaloukos – photography\nReferences\n6|isbn=0-333-74134-X|chapter=Yabby You|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofpo08lark/page/5945/}}\n}}"
