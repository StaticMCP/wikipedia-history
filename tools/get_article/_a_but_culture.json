The Đa Bút site was excavated in the 1930s by :fr:Étienne Patte, and is a Neolithic cemetery distinguished by shell middens. The site has recently been carbon-dated to 5000 BC. The people at the site were hunter-gatherers, and fishermen, with evidence of farming both of livestock and paddy rice. Other studies have given the site a slightly later date and found no evidence of food production.\nThe site is relevant to the two-layer hypothesis, as it is earliest culture in the region to the post-date the Hoabinhian culture, and therefore mark the beginning of the second layer.\nSee also\n*Two layer hypothesis\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Đa Bút Culture\n\n#REDIRECT Đa Bút culture"
