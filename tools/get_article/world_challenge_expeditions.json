      "text": "# World Challenge Expeditions\n\nWorld Challenge is a for-profit company based in the United Kingdom that provides international educational travel programs for school groups. Established in 1988, the organization offers a range of student-led expeditions, cultural immersion experiences, and sports and curriculum-based tours in various regions, including North America, Australia, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Europe. The company operates as part of Travelopia Holdings Limited and is owned by KKR.\nHistory\nThe origins of World Challenge trace back to 1985 when a young British Army captain led a team of soldiers on a training mission in the Hindu Kush mountain range in Pakistan. Observing the impact of teamwork, resilience, and personal development on the participants, he later founded World Challenge in 1988 to provide similar experiences for students.\nProgrammes/Trips\nWorld Challenge offers several types of educational travel programmes, typically designed for school-aged students. These programs vary in duration and focus, incorporating aspects of leadership, cultural exchange, and environmental sustainability.\nStudent-led Expeditions (1 to 4 weeks)\nWorld Challenge's expeditions are designed to be student-led, with participants selecting destinations and planning activities from pre-approved lists. Students also rotate leadership roles during the trip, managing responsibilities such as budgeting and logistics. These expeditions aim to develop teamwork, problem-solving, and independence.\nJourneys (1 to 2 weeks)\nThe Journey programme is a shorter travel option that emphasizes global citizenship and cultural literacy. These trips focus on community engagement projects, cultural exploration, and relaxation activities. Participants typically live and work within a local community while also visiting key sites in the region. Local guides, along with teachers and trip leaders, provide supervision and support.\nCurriculum Trips\nWorld Challenge also offers curriculum-based educational trips. Subjects covered include French, German, History, and Geography. These programmes combine academic learning with outdoor and adventure-based activities.\nEnvironmental Initiatives\nWorld Challenge promotes sustainable travel practices and has positioned itself as a carbon-negative student travel company. The organization measures and offsets its environmental impact through annual impact reports, which assess its effect on the environment, student development, local communities, and partnered projects.\nFunding Model\nParticipants are encouraged to contribute toward their expedition fees through fundraising efforts. World Challenge provides guidance on financial planning and fundraising strategies to assist students in covering the costs of their trips.\nIncidents\nEcuador 2017:\nIn July 2017 a student at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, died while white-water rafting on a World Challenge trip to Ecuador. The company then suspended all white water rafting activity while an investigation took place.\nVietnam 2019:\nIn September 2019 a student with Type 1 diabetes died after becoming ill on a World Challenge trip to Vietnam. A coroner's inquest in the students home country of Australia heard that World Challenge staff and teachers from the student's school failed to recognise the seriousness of his condition.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://weareworldchallenge.com/uk/ World Challenge UK Official Website]"
