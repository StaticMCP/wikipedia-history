Each object is listed in chronological order of its discovery (multiple dates occur when the moments of imaging, observation, and publication differ), identified through its various designations (including temporary and permanent schemes), and the discoverer(s) listed.\nHistorically the naming of moons did not always match the times of their discovery. Traditionally, the discoverer enjoys the privilege of naming the new object; however, some neglected to do so (E. E. Barnard stated he would \"defer any suggestions as to a name\" [for Amalthea] \"until a later paper\" but never got around to picking one from the numerous suggestions he received) or actively declined (S. B. Nicholson stated \"Many have asked what the new satellites [Lysithea and Carme] are to be named. They will be known only by the numbers X and XI, written in Roman numerals, and usually prefixed by the letter J to identify them with Jupiter.\"). The issue arose nearly as soon as planetary satellites were discovered: Galileo referred to the four main satellites of Jupiter using numbers while the names suggested by his rival Simon Marius gradually gained universal acceptance. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) eventually started officially approving names in the late 1970s. With the explosion of discoveries in the 21st century, new moons have once again started to be left unnamed even after their numbering, beginning with Jupiter LI and Jupiter LII in 2010.\nKey info\nIn the following tables, planetary satellites are indicated in bold type (e.g. Moon) while planets and dwarf planets, which directly circle the Sun, are in italic type (e.g. Earth). The Sun itself is indicated in roman type. The tables are sorted by publication/announcement date. Dates are annotated with the following symbols:\n* i: for date of first imaging (photography, etc.);\n* o: for date of first human visual observation, either through telescope or on photographic plate;\n* p: for date of announcement or publication.\nIn a few cases, the date is uncertain and is then marked \"(?)\".\n* Note: Moons marked by an asterisk (*) had complicated discoveries, such as being lost and rediscovered. Some of them thus appear multiple times in the list to clarify the situation.\n;Color legend\nThe Sun, the planets, dwarf planets, and their natural satellites are marked in the following colors:\n;Sun\n;Planets\n;Consensus dwarf planets\nand satellite|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\nand satellite|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\nand satellite|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Other dwarf planet candidates\nand satellite|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n||border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n||border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\nand satellite|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\nand satellite|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\nand satellite|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n||border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\nand satellite|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n||border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\nIt is not known precisely how many objects in the Solar System are dwarf planets. The nine objects listed in the third column are the ones agreed on by most astronomers, corresponding to a threshold of about 900–1000&nbsp;km diameter. There may be more; some of the largest objects beyond that threshold are included in the fourth column as candidates. In particular, Salacia and Varda each have a rather large moon, and current estimates for their densities still leave open the possibility that they are dwarf planets.\n;Designations\n* Other designations are synonyms or periphrases sometimes encountered for the object.\n* Permanent designations (of planetary satellites) are explained here.\n* Temporary designations are explained here.\nIf a satellite is named, its name is bolded; if it is unnamed, but has a permanent designation, then its permanent designation is bolded; and if it has neither, then its temporary designation is bolded.\nPrehistorically discovered\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"800\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background-color: Silver; text-align: center;\" id=\"cPrehistory\" | Prehistory\n|-\n!

Notes\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFD700\"\n| Sun || bgcolor=\"Black\" | || Star\n| In the geocentric model, developed in Ancient Greece, then standardized by Ptolemy in the 2nd century, the Earth was believed to be at the center of the cosmos. Seven planets were placed in orbit around it in an order of increasing distance from the Earth, as established by the Greek Stoics: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. This list included two objects, the Sun and the Moon, which are now not generally considered planets.\nIn the 5th century BCE, the Greek philosophers Philolaus and Hicetas speculated separately that the Earth was a sphere revolving daily around some mystical \"central fire\" that regulated the universe. Anaxagoras proposed that the Sun is a star around 450 BCE. In the 3rd century BCE, Aristarchus of Samos extended this idea by proposing that the Earth and other planets moved around a definite central object, which he believed to be the Sun though this was not widely accepted until the 17th century and not proven until the 19th.\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCC99\"\n| Earth|| bgcolor=\"Black\" ||| 3rd Planet\n|Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the subject of historical misconception for centuries. Earth was never formally 'discovered' because it was never an unrecognized entity by humans. However, its shared identity with other bodies as a \"planet\" is a historically recent discovery.\nThe Earth's position in the Solar System was correctly described in the heliocentric model proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, but not widely recognized until the Copernican Revolution.\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCC99\"\n| Moon\n| bgcolor=\"Black\" |\n| Earth I\n| Prior to the Copernican Revolution, the moon was considered one of the seven classical planets, and its geologic features were one of the discoveries that convinced astronomers that the earth was in fact a planet like the moon. In the Copernican system, the Moon was considered a secondary planet (ie, natural satellite of the Earth), and was originally thought to be the only body in that system whose revolution was not centered on the Sun.\n|- bgcolor=\"#D2B48C\"\n| Mercury\n| bgcolor=\"Black\" |\n| 1st Planet\n| bgcolor=\"white\" rowspan=\"5\" | Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were identified by ancient Babylonian astronomers in the 2nd millennium BCE.

Before any more Uranian moons were discovered, William Lassell sometimes adopted Herschel's numbers where Titania and Oberon are respectively Uranus II and IV, and sometimes called them respectively Uranus I and II. After he discovered Ariel and Umbriel in 1851, Lassell numbered the four real Uranian satellites then known outward from their parent planet as I (Ariel), II (Umbriel), III (Titania), and IV (Oberon), and this finally stuck.\n19th century\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"800\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background-color: Silver; text-align: center;\" id=\"c19th\" | 19th century\n|-\n!
