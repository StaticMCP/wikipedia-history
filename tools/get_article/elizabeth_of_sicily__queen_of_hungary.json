She married Ladislaus IV of Hungary in 1270.. They had no children. Ladislaus had neglected Elisabeth for the sake of his semi-pagan tribe, the Cumans; his mother Elizabeth was a member of the Cuman tribe. Ladislaus always wore Cuman dress and many of his friends were Cumans.\nQueen\nElisabeth spent most of her time as Queen along while Ladislaus persued the Cumans, encouraging them to live in Hungary. Elisabeth was confined to a convent in 1286 so that Ladislaus could live with a Cuman mistress.  Ladislaus finally reconciled with Elisabeth in 1289. When he found he did not have enough power to rule over his barons, he rejoined the Cumans.\nLadislaus died in 1290, childless, and he was succeeded by Andrew III of Hungary.\nLater life\nAfter her husband's death, Elisabeth returned to Naples, but she came back to Hungary. In the year 1294 Queen Fenenna confirmed on her the privilege to collect the donations of the church in the Veszprém County. In 1301 she returned to Naples, where she became a Dominican nun at St Peter's monastery (San Pietro a Castello), which had been founded by her sister-in-law Queen Mary. Queen Elisabeth (''Isabella d'Anjou'') died in 1303 and was buried at the monastery of St Peter's.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*59"
