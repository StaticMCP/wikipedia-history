His father, a doctor, frequently traveled for work, and so Patel's family moved to states including North Dakota, West Virginia, Maryland, and Texas.

He later renamed it \"Dwarkesh Podcast\". The show features extended conversations with researchers and technology leaders and is associated with San Francisco's Cerebral Valley scene. On the podcast, Patel has interviewed prominent and diverse figures including technology leaders such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, political figures including former British prime minister Tony Blair, former British political advisor Dominic Cummings and Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts.\nThe podcast has received praise from journalists and technologists.The Economist said in 2025 that Patel \"rose from nowhere to become Silicon Valley’s favourite podcaster\".The New Yorker referred to the podcast as \"to the doomer crowd what \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" is to jujitsu bros, or what \"The Ezra Klein Show\" is to Park Slope liberals\".\nPatel is particularly interested in artificial intelligence, which he considers to be \"the most multidisciplinary and intellectually stimulating topic.\" He was listed as one of the 100 most influential people in AI by Time in 2024.\nIn 2025, Patel authored the book The Scaling Era: An Oral History of A.I., 2019-2025.
