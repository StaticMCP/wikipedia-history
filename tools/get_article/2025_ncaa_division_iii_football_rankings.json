Unlike in Division I's Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the NCAA, Division III's college football's governing body, bestows a national championship on the winner of the Stagg Bowl – the championship round of a 40-team postseason tournament. The two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason are the D3football.com Poll and AFCA Poll which rank the top 25 colleges in Division III football. The 2025 season was the second time that a preseason Coaches Poll was released for Division III.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px
