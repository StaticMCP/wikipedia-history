The name derives from Old English relating to a hawthorn tree on a farm (or settlement) and Steward. The village was formerly owned by Wymar, who was the steward of the Earls of Richmond. The village is very similar to the others that dot Wensleydale, but Thornton Steward has a reservoir owned by Yorkshire Water.\nFrom 1974 to 2023 it was part of the district of Richmondshire, it is now administered by the unitary North Yorkshire Council.\nThe village includes the ancient St Oswald's Church, which is reputedly the oldest church in Wensleydale with some parts being dated back to the year 680. The church was subject to Channel 4's show Time Team, where they found remains of a communion of monks. The village was also featured in the British television series All Creatures Great and Small, in the episode \"If Wishes Were Horses\".\nThe hill, East Witton fell, is visible from Thornton Steward and on the western side Jervaulx Abbey is visible.\nThe school house was founded in 1815 by George Horn, with a budget of '£10 per annum', but was closed during the 20th century. It is situated in between the towns of Leyburn and Bedale, and is near to several tourist attractions such as Thorp Perrow Arboretum and the Green Howards regimental exhibition.\nReferences\nExternal links"
