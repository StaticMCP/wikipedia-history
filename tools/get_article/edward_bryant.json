At the time of his death, he resided in North Denver.\nLife and work\nBryant was born in White Plains, New York, but raised on a cattle ranch in Wyoming. He attended school in Wheatland, Wyoming, and received his MA in English from the University of Wyoming in 1968.\nDuring the 1950s his uncle, a rodeo star, encouraged his love of film. This perhaps ultimately led to his occasional work in screenplays and as an actor. He was in the films The Laughing Dead (1988) and Ill Met by Moonlight (1994).\nHis writing career began in 1968 with his attendance at the Clarion Workshop. At the beginning of his career he developed an association with Harlan Ellison, which led to collaborative efforts such as the novel Phoenix Without Ashes, based on Ellison's pilot script for The Starlost.\nHe won two Nebula Awards for his short stories, \"Stone\" (1978) and \"giANTS\" (1979). He was mostly known as a writer of short fiction; however, he also wrote poetry, nonfiction, reviews, criticism, and edited an e-zine. His short horror story \"Dark Angel\", which appeared in Kirby McCauley's anthology Dark Forces, featured modern-day witch Angela Black. She reappears as the narrator of Bryant's short novel Fetish.\nWhen Bryant moved to Denver in 1972, he founded the Northern Colorado Writers Workshop, which continues today, and has produced a number of notable writers, including Steve Rasnic Tem, Melanie Tem, John Dunning, Wil McCarthy, Bruce Holland Rogers, Dan Simmons, and Connie Willis. Bryant was a senior editor of Wormhole Books. In addition, he facilitated a number of other writing workshops over the years for writers ranging in skill and experience from amateur to professional.\nEdward Bryant served as Toastmaster for Denvention II, the 1981 Worldcon, as well as World Fantasy Convention, ArmadilloCon, TusCon, and Death Equinox. He was Master of Ceremonies at the 1994 World Horror Convention, Special Guest in 1996, and Chair in 2000.\nIllness and death\n(left) in November 2016 at TusCon in Tucson, Arizona.]]\nIn 2010, various writers & editors including Melanie Tem and Ellen Datlow set up a Crowd-funding page to help Bryant deal with financial emergencies brought on by his ongoing fight against the effects of Type 1 diabetes.\nBryant died at his home in Colorado on February 10, 2017, after a long illness. He was 71.\nWorks\nNovels\n* Phoenix Without Ashes (1975, with Harlan Ellison). An adaptation of Harlan Ellison's pilot script for The Starlost\nMosaic novels\n;Wild Cards series:\n* Bantam Books #1.
