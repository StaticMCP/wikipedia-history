The boys' regatta is held in mid to late March while the girls' regatta is held in late August to early September. Due to the lack of water at Wivenhoe Dam the boys' Head of the River was moved to Hinze Dam for 2006, and was then moved to Lake Kawana on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland the following year. Since the girls require 10 lanes for their regattas, the BSRA Head of the River was held at Hinze Dam from 2005 to 2007. However, due to construction work currently underway to increase the size of the dam, the BSRA Head of the River was also moved to Lake Kawana for the 2008 season. Both the GPS and BSRA competitions moved to Wyaralong Dam in 2017 following the opening of the Queensland State Regatta Centre the previous year.\nG.P.S. Head of the River\nParticipating Schools\nSeven of the nine GPS schools compete at the annual Head of the River. Only GPS Schools can compete.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!School\n!Location\n!Enrolment\n!Founded\n!Denomination\n!Day/Boarding\n!School Colours\n!Abbreviation\n!Nickname\n!In competition since\n|-\n|Anglican Church Grammar School\n|East Brisbane\n|1,700\n|1912\n|Anglican\n|Day & Boarding\n|Blue & Grey\n|ACGS\n|Churchie\n|1920\n|-\n|Brisbane Boys' College\n|Toowong\n|1,600\n|1902\n|Uniting Church\n|Day & Boarding\n|Green, White & Black\n|BBC\n|College\n|1918\n|-\n|Brisbane Grammar School\n|Spring Hill\n|1,400\n|1868\n|Non-Denominational\n|Day & Boarding\n|Dark Blue & Light Blue\n|BGS\n|Grammar\n|1918\n|-\n|Brisbane State High School\n|South Brisbane\n|3,361\n|1921\n|Non-Denominational\n|Day\n|Cerise & Navy Blue\n|BSHS\n|State High\n|1924\n|-\n|St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace\n|Spring Hill\n|1,337\n|1875\n|Catholic\n|Day\n|Red & Black\n|GT\n|Terrace\n|1928\n|-\n|St Joseph's  Nudgee College\n|Boondall\n|1,470\n|1891\n|Catholic\n|Day & Boarding\n|Blue & White\n|NC\n|Nudgee\n|2001\n|-\n|The Southport School\n|Southport\n|1,200\n|1901\n|Anglican\n|Day & Boarding\n|Maroon, Navy & White\n|TSS\n|Southport\n|1918\n|}Gregory Terrace first competed in 1928, but did not compete again until 1954.\nBetween 1916 and 1985 the Anglican Church Grammar School (ACGS), was known as Church of England Grammar School (CEGS).\nEarly years\nThe first inter-school rowing contests took place in 1890 and 1891 between Brisbane Grammar School and Ipswich Grammar School. Following these initial competitions, a devastating flood in 1893 led to Ipswich Grammar School abandoning the sport.\nFrom 1899 to 1909, Brisbane Grammar School and Maryborough Grammar School competed nine times, with races held alternately in Brisbane and Maryborough. Brisbane Grammar School were victorious in seven of these contests.\nIn 1908, Southport entered the competition and won on its first attempt. Southport continued its success, securing five more titles over the next six years. 1908 also marked the last appearance of Maryborough Grammar School in the competition.\nRockhampton Grammar School made its first and only appearance on the Brisbane River in 1913. However, Maryborough and Rockhampton Grammar Schools continued to compete against each other on the Mary and Fitzroy Rivers until Maryborough Grammar School closed in 1935.\nBrisbane Grammar School claimed the championship titles in 1910 and 1917. Technical College High School entered the competition in 1915, winning both that year and the following year, 1916. Brisbane Boys' College, initially known as Clayfield College, joined the competition in 1917. Church of England Grammar School made its first appearance in 1920.\nSouthport, after winning the race in 1908, 1909, and 1911, secured the Smith Cup. Southport also won outright the Henderson Cup in 1914 and the Lawless Cup in 1921.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n|-\n|1890\n|Ipswich Grammar\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1891\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|Ipswich Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1899\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|Maryborough Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1902\n|Maryborough Grammar\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1903\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|Maryborough Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1904\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|Maryborough Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1905\n|Maryborough Grammar\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1906\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|Maryborough Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1907\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|Maryborough Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1908\n|Southport\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|Maryborough Grammar\n|\n|-\n|1909\n|Southport\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1910\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|Southport\n|\n|\n|-\n|1911\n|Southport\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1912\n|Southport\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1913\n|Southport\n|Rockhampton Grammar\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|\n|-\n|1914\n|Southport\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|\n|\n|-\n|1915\n|Technical College High School\n|Southport\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|\n|-\n|1916\n|Technical College High School\n|Southport\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|\n|-\n|1917\n|Brisbane Grammar\n|Southport\n|Brisbane Boys' College\n|Technical College High School\n|}\nOpen 1st VIII – O'Connor Cup\nThe G.P.S.
