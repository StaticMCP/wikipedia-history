It was at this point, according to Sebeos, that Heraclius had agreed to stand down and was about ready to become a client of the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II, allowing the Byzantine Empire to become a client state of the Sasanid Empire, as well as even allow Khosrow II to choose the emperor. The Sassanids had already captured Byzantine Syria and Palestine in the previous year. After negotiations with Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, an ambassador was sent to Sasanian Shahanshah Khosrow II, and Shahin withdrew again to Syria.\nThis was not the first time the Sasanians drew up their armies at the walls of Constantinople, but this time the invasion was more widespread. Beginning in 614 the Sasanians encroached on Asia Minor. In 614 they captured Melitene and Shahin divided his armies in two, one army marching to sack Sardis and Miletus and his army move towards Chalcedon. Despite the successful retreat back to Syria, the Sasanians did keep Caesarea (modern Kayseri) and the key Armenian fortresses of Theodosiopolis (modern Erzurum) and Martyropolis. According to Sebeos, when they reached Chalcedon in 615, Heraclius had agreed to stand down and allow the Byzantine Empire to become a client state, as well as even allow Khosrow II to choose the emperor.\na Heraclius sent a separate letter to Shahin, stating his willingness to accept whoever was appointed by the Sasanians as the ruler of Byzantium. These efforts were failed but the Byzantine capital was not attacked, because the Sasanians preferred to focus on Egypt, which was of higher economic value than the war-torn Anatolia.\nSee also\n* Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
