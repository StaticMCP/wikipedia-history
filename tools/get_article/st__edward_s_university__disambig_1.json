It was founded and is operated in the Holy Cross tradition.\nHistory\nFounding and early history\nSt. Edward's University was founded by the Reverend Edward Sorin, Superior General of the Congregation of Holy Cross, who also founded the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana. Father Sorin established the institution on farmland south of Austin in 1877 and named it St. Edward's Academy in honor of his patron saint, King Edward the Confessor. The high school section later separated to become St. Edward's High School but closed during the 1970s. It is affiliated with the Congregation of Holy Cross.\nIn 1885, President P.J. Franciscus secured a charter and changed the name to St. Edward's College. Under the presidency of Peter Joseph Hurth (1886-1894), enrollment increased. The first school newspaper (1888), the organization of baseball and football teams, and approval to start building an administration building (1889) all followed. Architect Nicholas J. Clayton of Galveston, Texas was commissioned to design the college's Main Building. The structure was built four stories tall in the Gothic Revival style and was constructed with local white limestone.\nTwentieth century\nIn 1903, a fire destroyed the majority of Main Building, but it was rebuilt by the fall. In 1922, Main Building sustained damage from a tornado that caused significant damage all over the campus. Main Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. In 1925, St. Edward's received its university charter. Most of the personnel at the time were Holy Cross priests and brothers. Women arrived at St. Edward's in 1966 as students for Maryhill College, a coordinate institution. By 1970, Maryhill was absorbed and St. Edward's became co-educational.\nBy 1971, the university granted bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration. Also added were the College Assistance Migrant Program, or CAMP (1972); a professionally oriented Theater Arts curriculum (1972); a degree program for adults called New College (1974); and Freshman Studies (1975). In 1984, Patricia Hayes became the second layperson to lead St. Edward's University. In 1990, enrollment reached 3,000 for the first time. This decade also ushered in civic initiatives and capital improvements.\nSt. Edward's endowment, as of 2015, stood at more than $92.4 million.\n2026 U.S. News Regional Universities (West) ranking\nSt. Edward's University ranked 5th for the second consecutive year in the 2026 U.S. News & World Report ranking of the Best Regional Universities in the West. In the same report, the university was ranked 2nd in Undergraduate Teaching, 3rd in Best Value Schools, and 4th in Best Colleges for Veterans.\nExpansion (1999present)\nGeorge E. Martin served as the institution's 23rd president. From Fall 1999–Summer 2021, Martin oversaw a period of expansion for St. Edward's that included transforming the campus through the construction of many new buildings, doubling enrollment, growing the endowment, building global partnerships and founding the Holy Cross Institute to sustain the mission of the Brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross. In February 2022, Montserrat Fuentes was inaugurated as the 24th president and first Hispanic president of St. Edward's University. As part of her presidential inaugural address, Fuentes unveiled the university's Strategic Plan 2027.\nNew buildings and renovations\nTrustee Hall, a  academic facility, opened in fall 2002.

It houses the computer science, mathematics and physics programs, and features 13 classrooms, advanced computer and math labs, and a 126-seat auditorium.\nA 756-car parking garage opened in 2007. Major renovations of existing campus buildings include Premont Hall (2006), Fleck Hall (2007) and Doyle Hall (2009). A new residential village opened in 2009. A renovated campus library, formerly the Scarborough-Phillips Library, opened in fall 2013 as The Munday Library. The library features global digital classrooms for video conferencing, revamped reading, study and meeting spaces, an expanded digital collection, and writing and media centers. The library renovation was funded in 2011 by a $13 million donation from Bill and Pat Munday. The Mundays also donated $20 million for university scholarships in 2013. Both donations were school records.\nAcademics\nSt. Edward's offers 8 master's degree programs and bachelor's degrees in more than 50 areas of study through the schools of Behavioral and Social Sciences, Education, Humanities, Natural Sciences and The Bill Munday School of Business. For 2025, U.S. News & World Report ranked St. Edward's #5 in Regional Universities West, #4 in Best Colleges for Veterans, and #2 in Best Undergraduate Teaching.\nTheater\nSt. Edward's has a Theater Arts program, featuring a U/RTA contract with the Actors' Equity Association, allowing students who successfully complete the requirements of a Membership Candidate Program to become eligible to join Actors' Equity Association. In 2005, actor and environmentalist Ed Begley, Jr. brought his play, César & Ruben, to St. Edward's University for its Texas premiere.\nCampus in France\nIn September 2008, St. Edward's started a portal campus in Angers, France to provide educational opportunities for European and American students. Faculty members at St. Edward's travel to Angers each semester to teach courses.\nThe St. Edward's in Angers, France program is in partnership with the Catholic University of the West.\nStudent life\nAs of fall 2023, undergraduate enrollment was 2,731 with a student body that was approximately 60% female and 40% male.

Editions are released every other week during the academic year, with content available daily online and in the alternating print edition. The newspaper covers four main sections—News, Sports, Life & Arts, and Viewpoints—and is independently run: budgets and editorial decisions are made by students without prior review by university administration.
