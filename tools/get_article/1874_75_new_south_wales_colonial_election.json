This election was for all of the 72 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in 52 single-member constituencies, six 2-member constituencies and two 4-member constituencies, all with a first past the post system. Suffrage was limited to adult white males. The previous parliament of New South Wales was dissolved on 28 November 1874 by the Governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, on the advice of the Premier, Henry Parkes.\nThere was no recognisable party structure at this election; instead the government was determined by a loose, shifting factional system.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
