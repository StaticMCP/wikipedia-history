Student Politicism also dissolved.\nSecretary for Security Chris Tang accused the Hong Kong Journalists Association of failing to uphold professional standards among its members, and said it shared a responsibility for the eroding reputation of authorities among young people in Hong Kong since 2019. The association strongly denied the accusations.\nIn November, two activists were jailed under the national security law, one of them purely for speech-based crimes.\nSeptember\n1 September\nProtest humanitarian fund probed\nKey leaders in charge of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which had been founded in 2019 in order to give financial aid to protesters facing prosecution or financial hardship, received letters from police demanding operational information pursuant to the national security law.
