The local Berber dialect, known locally as Zuwari, is commonly spoken as a first language by the inhabitants of Zuwara.\nZuwara is famous for its beaches and seafood. It is situated  west of Tripoli and  from the Tunisian border. It is the capital of the Nuqat al Khams district. Zuwarah consists of 49 districts.\nHistory\nThe settlement was first mentioned by the traveller Abdallah al-Tijani in the years 1306-1309 as composed of two parts: Zwara al-soughra (\"Little Zwarah\") and Zwara al-koubra (\"Greater Zwarah\").  In the Catalan Atlas (1375) it was called as Punta dar Zoyara.  The town is mentioned by Leo Africanus in the 16th century.  It later served as the western outpost of Italian Libya (1912–43), being the terminus of the now-defunct Italian Libya Railway from Tripoli  to the east. Its artificial harbour shelters a motorized fishing fleet. Cereals, dates, and esparto grass (used to make cordage, shoes, and paper) are local products.\nIt was in 1973 in Zuwara that Muammar Gaddafi first proclaimed the Libyan \"Cultural Revolution\".\n2011 Libyan civil war\nDuring the 2011 Libyan Civil War, the city was reported by Al Jazeera to be under control of the local anti-Gaddafi forces on 23 February 2011, and lost by the government of Muammar Gaddafi. Thousands of anti-government protesters, gathered in the Zuwara town square on 24 February, repulsed another Libyan Army attempt to retake the city. Loyalist forces used the pro-government towns of Jumayl and Riqdalin to the south as bases for their attacks on the city. However, from March onwards, the city was under the control of loyalist forces. Amidst the August rebel coastal offensive, rebels took Zuwara on 18 August.\nIn September 2011, and following the fall of the Gaddafi government, Zuwara was the first City in Libya to democratically elect its local council.\nEconomy\nThe city's Port of Zwara is used as a transfer point for smuggled fuel by the militias who fight the government. Often these vessels fly the flag of Palau and are operated from a mailbox in the Marshall Islands.\nClimate\nZuwara has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh).\n}}\nSee also\n* List of cities in Libya\n* Zuwara Berber\n*Dania Ben Sassi\nReferences\nSources\n* Terence Frederick Mitchell, Ferhat.
