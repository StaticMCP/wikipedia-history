Released on July 20, 2001, by Warner Music Hong Kong.  In Hong Kong, The album was a commercial success, Upon its release, It quickly climbed to the top of the HMV Asia Sales Chart, selling over 70,000 copies within the first four days ,reaching nearly 120,000 copies within two weeks,\nA few weeks later, It achieved triple platinum status, with total sales exceeding 160,000 copies,And then, It became one of the top ten best-selling albums on IFPI Hong Kong Top Sales Music Award presented 2001, making it the best-selling album by a Hong Kong female artist that year.\nComposition\nThe album primarily falls under the Cantopop genre, with influences from Mandopop and contemporary pop music. It features a mix of upbeat tracks, ballads, Sentimental ballads, Pop-Rock, Synth-Pop, Dance pop and Techno tracks, reflecting Cheng's ability to handle different musical styles. Cheng worked with several prominent producers and songwriters, including Adky Wun, Vicky Fung, Sandee Chan, Jason Choi, Peter Kam and Mark Lui.\nOverall, 'Shocking Pink' is an album that typifies the early 2000s Cantopop.\nPromotion\nDue to the immense popularity of the films Love on a Diet and Fighting for Love, in which Sammi Cheng starred as the leading actress, the box office results were outstanding. Riding on this wave of success,  the album's sales soared without the need for extensive promotion.\nThe films significantly boosted her singing career, but she still promoted the album through a few events, TV appearances, interviews, and features in magazines and newspapers.\nAdditionally, She held a total of twelve \"Shocking Colors\" concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum starting on September 7th, 2001 which were hailed by Hong Kong media as the Highest-grossing concerts. This also drove the sales of the albums of Shocking Pink, Complete and Love Is… . However, the albums sold outside the concert venues were not counted in the sales figures verified by the Hong Kong IFPI, resulting in a portion of the sales being unaccounted for.\nSingles\nIn Hong Kong, Six singles were released from the album. The first three, \"《Doctor and I》 [From \"Fighting for Love\"],\" \"《Beautiful Life 》[From \"Love on a Diet\"]\", and \"《Shocking Pink》\"are commercial singles intended for radios, TVs, and karaoke bars. The last three, \"《Feel Happy That Day?》\" [From \"Fighting for Love\"], \"《Pose of Living World》\"and\"《Just For It》\" are promotional singles intended solely for film and TV Drama.\n\"《Doctor and I》 [From \"Fighting for Love\"] \"was chosen as the album's lead single, 《Beautiful Life 》[From \"Love on a Diet\"] was released as the second single, peaking at number one on three major charts, It maintained that position for one week on the RTHK Chinese pop chart, Additionally, It was also so popular in karaoke bars that it shot straight to the top of the karaoke charts for a few weeks .\"《Shocking Pink》\" was released as the third  and final commercial single, reaching number one on one major chart.\nSingles charts\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | the highest rank achieved by the released single\n|-\n| width=\"140\"| Single || width=\"50\"| 903 || width=\"50\"| RTHK || width=\"50\"| 997 || width=\"50\"| TVB\n|-\n| Doctor and I [From \"Fighting for Love\"]|| 4 || — || 3 || —\n|-\n| Beautiful Life  [From \"Love on a Diet\"]|| 1 || 1 || 5 || 1\n|-\n|  Shocking Pink || 5 || 7 || 1 || 2\n|-\n|}\nAccolades\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
