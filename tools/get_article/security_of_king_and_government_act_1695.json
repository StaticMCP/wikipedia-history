Its long title was ''An act for the better security of his Majesty's royal person and government''. It was passed in 1696 but backdated to the beginning of the parliamentary session.\nSection 1 of the act required all officers to take the oath required by the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy Act 1688 (1 Will. & Mar. c. 8) or be disenfranchised. Section 1 of the act also provided that anyone who said that William III was not the lawful king, or that James Francis Edward Stuart (the \"Old Pretender\") or his late father James II and VII had any title to the Crown, or that anyone else had such title other than according to relevant acts of Parliament was guilty of praemunire. It was high treason to return to England from France without a licence after 1 May 1696.\nSubsequent developments\nThe whole act was repealed by section 1 of, and the schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1867 (30 & 31 Vict. c. 59).\nSee also\n*Jacobitism\n*Correspondence with Enemies Act 1691\n*Treason Act 1695\n*Treason Act\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol7/pp114-118 Text of the Act]"
