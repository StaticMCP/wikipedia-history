The forest's mountain habitat is in the Central Basin and Range ecoregion (EPA) and Great Basin montane forests (One Earth). The Patriarch Grove is the source of Cottonwood Creek, a designated Wild and Scenic River.\nEcology\nPinus longaeva – bristlecone pines in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, White Mountains, California]]\nThe Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) grows between 9,800 and 11,000 feet (3,000–3,400 m) above sea level, in xeric alpine conditions, protected within the Inyo National Forest. The limber pine (Pinus flexilis) also grows in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest.\nMethuselah\nThe Methuselah Grove in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest is the location of the \"Methuselah\", a Great Basin bristlecone pine that is  years old. It is considered to be the world's oldest known and confirmed living non-clonal organism.  It was temporarily superseded by a 5,062 year old bristlecone pine discovered in 2010. In May 2017 however, Dr. Peter Brown removed this tree from his database of old trees because the tree and core sample could not be found. \"Methuselah\" is not marked in the forest, to ensure added protection from vandals.\nVisiting\n.]]\nThe Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest is generally open from mid-May through the end of November, weather permitting.\n*Schulman Grove and Schulman Grove Visitor Centerdaily interpretive talks and natural history lectures mid-June through Labor Day, and hiking trails.\n*Patriarch Grovehome of the world's largest bristlecone pine, the Patriarch Tree, and a self-guided nature trail.\nMethuselah Grove trail\nThe Methuselah Grove trail starts from the visitor center at  and makes a  loop that includes the side valley of the Methuselah Grove where the oldest tree lives, a high section looking out eastward over Nevada's basin-and-range region, and side trails to old mining sites. Numbered natural-history markers are explained by a booklet.\nFire\nOn September 4, 2008, an arsonist set fire to the Schulman Grove Visitor Center and several bristlecone pines. The building and all the exhibits within were destroyed. Activities to rebuild the center began the next day and are now complete.\nReferences\n* -\nExternal links\n*[https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/inyo/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=70821&actid=50 Inyo National Forest official Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest site]\n*[http://www.fs.usda.gov/r05/inyo Inyo National Forest: The Natural History of the Bristlecone Pines]"
