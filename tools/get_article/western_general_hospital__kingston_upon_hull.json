During the First World War, the hospital was expanded to receive casualties from the Western Front who had arrived, often badly wounded, at Paragon Station. It became a naval hospital for injured sailors in April 1917.\nIt joined the National Health Service as the Western General Hospital in 1948 and, after services transferred to the Hull Royal Infirmary, it closed in 1966. The building, which became known as the Haughton Building, continued to be used by the Hull Royal Infirmary for storage purposes until it was demolished to make way for a helipad in 2017.\nReferences"
