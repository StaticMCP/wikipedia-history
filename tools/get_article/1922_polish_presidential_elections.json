In the first election on 9 December Gabriel Narutowicz was elected president, but he was assassinated five days later. A second election on 22 December was won by Stanisław Wojciechowski.\nFirst election\nAfter the independence of Poland, the head of state was Naczelnik Państwa Józef Piłsudski. In a new constitution adopted by the Polish Sejm, the new head of state was to be the President of Republic of Poland - to be choose by the National Assembly (combined Sejm and Senate). After the parliamentary election, planning began for the first Polish presidential election in history.\nThe main probable candidate Józef Piłsudski, despite calls for him to contend, did not run for election. He proposed a former Prime Minister, Wincenty Witos, for presidency. Witos also refused. Finally Piłsudski supported the candidature of Minister of Foreign Affairs Gabriel Narutowicz.\nAt the time of the election the main candidates were count Maurycy Zamoyski, the candidate of National Democracy and Stanisław Wojciechowski, candidate of Polish People's Party \"Piast\". Narutowicz's good result was a surprise. Once the long voting was over, Zamoyski and Narutowicz advanced to the fifth ballot. Narutowicz finally won the election with the support of \"Piast\" (Wojciechowski was eliminated on the fourth round).\nNarutowicz was sworn in as president on 11 December 1922, but was assassinated five days later.\nCandidates\nFile:Gabriel narutowicz.jpg|Minister of Foreign Affairs Gabriel Narutowicz\nFile:Maurycy Zamoyski.jpg|Diplomat Maurycy Zamoyski\nFile:Stanisław Wojciechowski.jpg|Former Minister of the Interior Stanisław Wojciechowski\nFile:Jan Niecisław Ignacy Baudouin de Courtenay.jpg|Linguist Jan Baudouin de Courtenay\nFile:Ignacy Daszynski01.jpg|Former Prime Minister Ignacy Daszyński\nResults\n|cand4=Gabriel Narutowicz|party4=Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"|votes4=62|votes4_2=151|votes4_3=158|votes4_4=171|votes4_5=289\n|cand5=Ignacy Daszyński|party5=Polish Socialist Party|votes5=49|votes5_2=1\n|source=Urbankowski\n}}\nSecond election\nThe first election, when President of the Republic of Poland Gabriel Narutowicz was elected after several rounds by joint chambers of Sejm and Senate (at time of Second Polish Republic joint parliament elected president.
