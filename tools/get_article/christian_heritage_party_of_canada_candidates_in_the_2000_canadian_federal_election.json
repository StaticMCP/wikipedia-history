Information about these candidates may be found here.\nFederal electoral laws in effect at the time required a party to run 50 candidates in order to retain official status; as the CHP only was able to nominate 46 candidates by the nomination deadline, the party lost its registered status two days after the deadline. As a result, all of its candidates appeared on the ballot of the 2000 election as \"non-affiliated\". The party successfully ran at least 50 candidates in 2004 and regained status, and the law has since been changed to allow registration to parties running a single candidate.\nThis page also includes information about CHP candidates who contested by-elections between 2000 and 2004.\nNotable candidates\nTilly Bylsma (St. Catharines, Ontario)\nBylsma listed herself as a homemaker.  She received 166 votes (0.36%), finishing sixth against Liberal incumbent Walt Lastewka.  Her husband Bill and son David have also campaigned for the CHP.\nJean-Paul Kabashiki (St. Boniface, May 13, 2002)\nKabashiki received 210 votes (1.01%), finishing last in a field of six candidates.  His expenses for the by-election came to almost $10,000, an unusually high total for a minor party candidate.  The winner was Raymond Simard of the Liberal Party of Canada.\n, Kabashiki is listed as president of the CHP riding association in St. Boniface.[https://web.archive.org/web/20051029080418/http://www.chp.ca/manitobaRidings/ST_Boniface.htm]\nOther candidates\n* Colin G.
