The song represented Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 after winning  2023, the Danish national selection for that year's Eurovision Song Contest.\nBackground\nThe song was written and composed by Reiley with the Norwegians Bård Mathias Bonsaksen and Sivert Hjeltnes Hagtvet, and the Swede Hilda Stenmalm.\nReiley, discussing the song in an interview with a Eurovision YouTube fan channel, Eurovision Fantasia, said it was written during a \"toxic\" relationship. He also claimed that he had put the song in a folder, and decided to record it when he heard of  2023.\nEurovision Song Contest\n2023\n2023 was the 53rd edition of , the music competition that selects Denmark's entries for the Eurovision Song Contest. The event was held on 11 February 2023.\nThe final took place over two rounds of voting. In the first round of voting, the top three will advance to the superfinal based on the votes of a public vote. In the second round, the top three entries will perform again and the winner will be determined by a 50/50 combination of jury and public vote. Heading into the final, \"Breaking My Heart\" was considered one of the favorites to win the competition, coming in second on a poll from Eurovision fan-site Wiwibloggs. At the end of the superfinal voting, it was revealed that \"Breaking My Heart\" had won the superfinal, earning 28% of the vote from juries and 15% of the vote from the Danish public for a combined percentage of 43%, winning by a margin of 11%, thus earning the Danish spot for the Eurovision Song Contest 2023.\nAt Eurovision\nAccording to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 31 January 2023, an allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Denmark has been placed into the second semi-final, to be held on 11 May 2023, and has been scheduled to perform in the first half of the show. Denmark received just 6 points, all from Iceland, from the public so did not proceed to the Grand Final, their worst result to date in the contest, in a semi final.\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Breaking My Heart\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten)\n| 31\n|}\nReferences"
