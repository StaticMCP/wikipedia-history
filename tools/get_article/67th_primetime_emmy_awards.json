The ceremony was held on Sunday, September 20, 2015, at the Microsoft Theater in Downtown Los Angeles, California, where 26 awards were presented, and was broadcast in the U.S. by Fox. Andy Samberg hosted the show for the first time. The nominations were announced on July 16, 2015.\nThe Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony was held on September 12 and was broadcast by FXX on September 19.\nThe Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards ceremony was held on October 28, 2015, at the Loews Hollywood Hotel.\nThe ceremony became notable for breaking two major milestones: Game of Thrones set a new record by winning 12 awards, the most for any show in a single year, up to this date (it was also the second HBO show, after The Sopranos, to win the Outstanding Drama Series award), while Viola Davis became the first African-American woman in Emmy history to win Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her performance as Annalise Keating in How to Get Away with Murder.\nThis year also saw for the first time, two Streaming service networks win four Acting awards: Netflix, with Uzo Aduba in Orange Is the New Black and Reg E. Cathey in House of Cards; and Amazon Studios, with Jeffrey Tambor for Transparent and Bradley Whitford for the same show.\nThe Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series went to the HBO political satire Veep, which not only broke Modern Familys five-year hold on the award but became the second time a premium channel won Outstanding Comedy Series (the first was for HBO's romantic comedy Sex and the City in 2001).\nRule changes\nThe Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced new rule changes for the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards. These new rules are:\n* All voters eligible for a category's nominations are now eligible to vote in that category, providing that they have seen the submitted material and attest to no specific conflicts of interest.\n* The number of nominees in the Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Comedy Series categories will expand from six nominees to seven, due to the increase in series production.\n* To clarify the difference between a Comedy series and a Drama series, any show where episodes average a length of 30 minutes is eligible to enter as a comedy and series with episodes that average a length of 1 hour is eligible as a drama. There may be exceptions to the rules, however: producers may formally petition to a new Academy panel to have the show be considered for the alternative category. This panel, consisting of five industry leaders appointed by the Academy chairman and four appointees from the Board of Governors, will vote on a decision. A two-thirds vote was required for the show to be considered for the alternative category. So far, three petitions have been successful: Glee, Jane the Virgin, and Shameless were voted as eligible for \"Outstanding Comedy Series\".\n* The Outstanding Miniseries was renamed as \"Outstanding Limited Series\". A \"Limited Series\" is defined as a program consisting of two or more episodes totaling 150 minutes as a whole, tell a complete, non-recurring story, and do not have an ongoing storyline and/or main characters in subsequent seasons.\n* A \"Guest Actor\" is now defined as a performer appearing in less than 50% of the program's episodes. Only performers that fit this criterion are allowed to submit.\n* The Outstanding Variety Series category has been split into two separate categories: \"Outstanding Variety Talk\" and \"Outstanding Variety Sketch\".\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (‡). For simplicity, producers who received nominations for program awards, as well as nominated writers for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series, have been omitted.\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Veep (HBO)'\n** Louie (FX)\n** Modern Family (ABC)\n** Parks and Recreation (NBC)\n** Silicon Valley (HBO)\n** Transparent (Amazon)\n** Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (Netflix)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Game of Thrones (HBO)'\n** Better Call Saul (AMC)\n** Downton Abbey (PBS)\n** Homeland (Showtime)\n** House of Cards (Netflix)\n** Mad Men (AMC)\n** Orange Is the New Black (Netflix)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Comedy Central)'\n** The Colbert Report (Comedy Central)\n** Jimmy Kimmel Live!
