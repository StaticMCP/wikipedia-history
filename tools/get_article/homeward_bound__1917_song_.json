      "text": "# Homeward Bound (1917 song)\n\nHomeward Bound is a World War I era song that says the war will soon be over, and the soldiers will be able to return home. It has a hopeful message and was meant to comfort both soldiers and the family and friends of soldiers. It was composed by George W. Meyer, written by Howard Johnson and Coleman Goetz, and produced by Leo. Feist, Inc. in 1917.\nLyrics\nSomewhere far away,\nSomewhere in the fray,\nMany boys are over the sea,\nFighting for you, fighting for me.\nThey're all proud to carry a gun.\nTheir work will soon be done.\nCHORUS\n\"Homeward Bound\"\nSomeday they'll hear that welcome sound,\nFor while the shot and the shell are flying,\nFor the ones at home they're sighing:\nAnd tho' the skies seem grey,\nThere's bound to be a brighter day,\nFor when the dove of peace flies over the land,\nThey all will hear the general give the command,\n\"We are \"Homeward Bound'.\"\nThat's a wonderful, wonderful sound.\nWhen the moon looks down\nOn the battleground,\nBy the campfires' flickering gleams,\nThey think of home in all their dreams.\nOf the future naught can they learn.\nLet's pray for their return.\nREPEAT CHORUS\nAD LIB: RECITATION:\n\"Homeward Bound\"\nThere's so much meaning in the sound.\nTo all those faithful one, those noble sons,\nupon the battleground,\nFor tho' their minds are on their duty\nAnd the fight that must be won,\nThere are times they can't help but wishing,\nThat their mighty tasks were done.\nEven tho' you're not a soldier, tho' you're not\nacross the sea,\nThere is something in these words that takes\nyou back to mother's knee\nSo let's keep the home fires burning, with the\nhope in every heart,\nThat they'll soon will be returning to us,\nnevermore to part.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16614coll23/id/493  Listen to an MP3 of this song and see the sheet music]"
