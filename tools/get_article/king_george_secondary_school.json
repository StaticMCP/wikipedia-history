Some students are from other areas of Vancouver who wish to be in a smaller school environment.\nSince July 2006, King George Secondary was approved by International Baccalaureate (IB) to offer the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme for students in grades 8, 9, and 10, as one of the only 3 schools in the city to offer the MYP Programme. Starting the 2025-2026 school year, King George will no longer offer the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme.\nThe school is adjacent to the West End Community Centre, enabling youth to get more involved in their programs.\nSpecial programs\nKing George was an IB MYP approved school, offering the program to students in grade 8, 9, and 10.\nKing George also hosted City School, a program for grades 10, 11 and 12 that involves students leaving the traditional secondary school setting to work in a more challenging, independent setting, with a different schedule, smaller groups of people, and only a few different teachers. This program is described as a \"school within a school\". City School, established in 1971, is Vancouver's oldest alternative program.\nFormerly, a third program called Gateway was offered by the school. Unlike Tech Immersion or City School, this program was provided off school ground and maintained limited ties to the school. Gateway Alternate Education Program was aimed at at-risk youth who had been absent from schools for some time, as well as to those who were homeless. Only those who were referred by the Ministry of Children and Family Development or VSB could register and attend this program.\nNotable alumni\n*Bill Mathews, geologist, volcanologist, and professor at the University of British Columbia; graduated 1935\n*Harris Allan, actor (attended grades 8 through 12 from 1998 to 2003)\n*Aidan Caves, Professional Cyclist, part of the first Canadian team to ride 4&nbsp;km in under 4 minutes in Team Pursuit (2016) graduated 2012\n*Percy Saltzman, the first weatherman in Canadian television history\n*Vera Kobalia, Georgian, Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development since July 2, 2010\n*Elsie MacGill, aeronautical engineer\n*Avan Jogia, an actor on ABC Family's Twisted and Nickelodeon's Victorious.\n*Mary Livingstone (born Sadie Marks), actress and wife of Jack Benny.\n*Artour \"Arteezy\" Babaev, professional Dota 2 player and streamer.\n* Diego Kapelan, professional basketball player, played NCAA Division I basketball at McNeese State University\n* Alice M G White (1908-2007), award-winning author and playwright\nSee also\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.vsb.bc.ca/schools/king-george/pages/default.aspx/ King George Secondary School]\n*[http://www.vsb.bc.ca/schools/Secondaryschools/03939001/default.htm Vancouver School Board - King George]\n*[http://www.cityschoolvancouver.ca City School]"
