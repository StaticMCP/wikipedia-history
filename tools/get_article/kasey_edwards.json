She was made redundant on the same day her first book was published.\nHer brother is composer and pianist Michael Edwards.\nWriting career\nEdward's books include ''30-Something and Over It: What Happens when you Wake Up and Don't Want to go to Work.

Her books have been republished by Random House in Australia, and translated by publishers in Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Portugal. She also wrote a book about positive body image which was critical of the diet industry, titled Kill The Fat Girl, but she was unable to find a commercial publisher to buy it.\n30-Something and Over It'' is a memoir documenting Edwards' dissatisfaction with work and career. In it, she explores the idea of a 'thrisis' — a thirty-something crisis. Edwards told Body & Soul that a thrisis is 'looking forward and being terrified of spending the next 30 years in a state of unfulfilled monotony'.\nEdwards writes a column for the Australian feminist website Daily Life, published by Fairfax. A collection of Edwards' articles for Daily Life was published in 2017 under the title Guilt Trip published by Nero books, an imprint of Schwartz Publishing.

That's Not My Husband...'' both published by Prion Books, an imprint of Carlton Publishing Group. The books spoof the picture book series 'That's Not My...' published by Usborne. ''OMG! That's Not My Husband...'', written in 2011, went viral in 2016 after a critical review written by an American man on Father's Day.\nPersonal life\nAged 32, Edwards was diagnosed as having polycystic ovary syndrome in one ovary and endometriosis in the other and advised to conceive within the next year if she planned to have children.
