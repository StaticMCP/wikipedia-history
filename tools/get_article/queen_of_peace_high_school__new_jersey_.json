The school closed in June 2017, after 86 years of operation, in the wake of declining enrollment and financial challenges.\nThe school had been honored two times by the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program, the highest award an American school can receive. It was overseen by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1969.\nAs of the 2013–14 school year, the school had an enrollment of 356 students and 26.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.7:1. The school's enrollment was 49.2% White, 18.3% Asian, 17.7% Hispanic, 6.2% Black, 3.9% Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander and 4.8% two or more races.\nHistory\nIn 1999, William \"Sonny\" Connors, grandfather to Derek Jeter and longtime head of school maintenance, died. In honor of Sonny's service to Queen of Peace, the Jeter family, through Jeter's Turn2 Foundation, started the Connors/Jeter Scholarship Fund. This fund was started to help exceptional, well-rounded students from Queen of Peace and to memorialize Derek's grandfather, William \"Sonny\" Connors, with two students meeting the criteria of academic and community accomplishments being chosen each year as recipients.\nOn January 4, 2007, several Queen of Peace students traveled to Rome in order to sing in a private audience to Pope Benedict XVI.\nIn February 2013, the school attracted national attention when it asked the girls of the school to take a pledge not to curse for 30 days as the school wanted \"ladies to act like ladies\", though male students at the school were asked not to swear \"in the presence of ladies\" and were not required to take an oath.\nCirca 2016 the school administration announced that it needed $1 million raised for it to remain open. Ultimately about $1,035,000 was raised and the school stayed open for another school year. The necessary money was generated in approximately one month.\nDespite the 2016 fundraising campaign, in May 2017, the Archdiocese of Newark announced the closing of the school as of June 30, 2017, in the wake of sharply dropping enrollment and financial challenges, though the affiliated K-8 grammar school will remain open.\nAwards, recognition and rankings\nDuring both the 1992–93 and 1997-98 school years, Queen of Peace High School was recognized with the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education.\nAthletics\nThe Queen of Peace High School Golden Griffins had competed in the North Jersey Interscholastic Conference, which comprises public and private high schools located in Bergen, Hudson, Passaic counties and was established following a reorganization of sportseagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association. Prior to the league realignment that took effect in the fall of 2010, Queen of Peace had been a member of the American Division of the Bergen County Scholastic League (BCSL).\nSt. Mary High School filed a complaint against Queen of Peace High School with the NJSIAA in 2007, claiming that a new wrestling program run by former Gaels coach Scot Weaver at Queen of Peace would induce St. Mary's wrestlers to transfer schools.\nThe boys cross country running team won the Non-Public Group B state championship in 1970 and 1971.\nThe boys track team won the Non-Public Group B spring / outdoor track state championship in 1971, 1972, 1974 and 1977.\nThe 1980 boys' soccer team finished the season with a 14-4-3 record after winning the NJSIAA Boys Non-Public A state championship, defeating runner-up Notre Dame High School by a score of 1-0 in the tournament finals.\nThe softball team won the Non-Public Group A state championship in 1988 against Donovan Catholic High School.\nThe girls track team won the indoor track Group I state championship in 2003 and 2005.\nThe football team won the Non-Public Group II state sectional championship in 2004 with a 35-20 win against DePaul Catholic High School in the finals of the playoff. The 1989 Golden Griffins were the last football team to win the Bergen County Scholastic League championship.
