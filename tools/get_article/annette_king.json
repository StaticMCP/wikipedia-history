In 1983 King unsuccessfully sought the Labour Party nomination for the seat of Tasman following the retirement of Labour leader Bill Rowling, but lost to Ken Shirley.\nMember of Parliament\n(left) in 1986]]\nIn the 1984 election, she stood as the party's candidate for Horowhenua, and was successful. She was re-elected in the 1987 election. King was considered one of the most effective backbenchers in the Fourth Labour Government.\nFollowing the 1987 election, she was appointed parliamentary under-secretary to the Minister of Employment and of Social Welfare. In August 1989 she put herself forward to fill one of two vacant seats in cabinet, winning a caucus ballot against ex-minister Richard Prebble. King was appointed Minister of Employment, Minister of Immigration, and Minister of Youth Affairs. She was also given special responsibility for liaising between Cabinet and the party caucus.\nIn the 1990 election, King lost the Horowhenua electorate against Hamish Hancock, a lawyer who stood for the National Party. She served as chief executive officer of the Palmerston North Enterprise Board from 1991 until the 1993 election, when she was returned to Parliament as the MP for Miramar. In the 1996 election, when the shift to mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation prompted a reorganisation of electorates, King successfully contested the new seat of Rongotai. In that 1996 election, she was ranked in sixth place on the Labour Party's list.\nAfter re-entering parliament new leader Helen Clark appointed her as spokesperson for Immigration and Business & Industry in December 1993. Less than a year later, in October 1994, after Peter Dunne split from Labour, Clark gave King Dunne's commerce and customs portfolios as well.

In August 1997 King was promoted again, replacing Lianne Dalziel as Shadow Minister of Health while relinquishing the Social Welfare portfolio.\nCabinet Minister\nWhen Labour won the 1999 election, and Helen Clark became Prime Minister, King was appointed Minister of Health. She was ranked sixth within Cabinet. After Labour winning a third term in government at the 2005 election, King took on the roles of Minister of Transport and Minister of Police. Following another reshuffle in late 2007, King became the new Minister of Justice. Before the 2008 general election she was elevated to number four on the party list.\nDeputy Leader of the Opposition\nLabour was defeated in the 2008 election by the National Party led by relative newcomer John Key. King retained her seat with a majority of about 7,800 votes. King was elected as the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in a special caucus meeting on 11 November 2008, replacing Michael Cullen. Phil Goff, another senior Labour Party member, became the Leader of the Labour Party, replacing former Prime Minister Helen Clark. King stood again for Rongotai in the 2011 general election. She was ranked second on the Labour Party list.

She was succeeded as Deputy Leader by Grant Robertson in the 2011 Labour Party leadership election.\nIn the , King increased her majority in the Rongotai electorate, but National won the party vote for the first time since the initial MMP election in 1996. Labour's heavy defeat at the 2014 election caused the resignation of David Cunliffe as the party's leader and the next leadership election, with King in an interim capacity as deputy leader.\nFollowing the election of Andrew Little as the new leader, King remained as deputy in a permanent capacity. Although Little guaranteed that she would be deputy for at least a year, he did not indicate whether he wanted her to be a future Deputy Prime Minister.\nOn 1 March 2017 King announced her intention to retire from politics at the , despite initially indicating she would only contest the election on the party list.
