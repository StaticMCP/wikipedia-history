Although it is mainly located in Middle Village, the southern edge of the cemetery runs along Cooper Avenue in Glendale. It is one of nine official Catholic burial grounds in the New York Metropolitan Area. St. John, along with St. Charles/Resurrection Cemeteries in East Farmingdale, Long Island, is among the largest cemeteries in New York State.\nSince its opening, St. John has been the resting place of various famous and infamous people in New York City society, such as Mario Cuomo (1932–2015), Governor of the state of New York from 1983 to 1995, John F. Hylan (1868–1936), mayor of the city of New York from 1918 to 1925, Geraldine Ferraro (1935–2011), the first female vice presidential candidate representing a major American political party, Lucky Luciano (1897–1962), considered the father of modern organized crime in the United States, and John J.
