His father Amir Bakhsh was a cultivator by profession.\nIn his youth Sa'adullah Khan went to study at Lahore under Shaykh Kamāl al-Dīn, a well-known scholar who had as his pupil Abdul Hakim Sialkoti and Ahmad Sirhindi, among others. For a while he taught at Lahore and later went to Delhi, where he became teacher of sons of Abu'l-Hasan Asaf Khan. He first entered in the Mughal bureaucracy in December 1641 on the recommendation of the Sadar as-Sudur Musavi Khan; an allowance was fixed for him and he was given a robe and a horse. Soon he was appointed as the arz-i-mukarrar of the Empire and was given the mansab of 1000 zat and 200 sowar (1000/200). After serving for a short period in this post he was given the post of darogha-i-daulat khana-i-khas (superintendent of royal apartments) and rewarded with the title of Khan. In 1643 his rank was increased to 1500/300. In the same year he was made the Mir-i-Saman of the Empire, a minister of great importance, second only to the Wazir. In 1645 Sa'adullah was granted the post of Diwan-i-Khalisa; he was also given the charge of drafting royal orders, with a mansab of 4000/1000. He worked for 46 days in this position before being appointed as the Grand Vizier, with his mansab ultimately reaching 7000/7000. Sa'adullah Khan would remain the Grand Vizier until his death in 1656.\nPrime Minister of the Mughal Empire\nIn the year 1645, the incumbent Prime Minister Islam Khan was made to vacate his position and take up governorship in the Deccan region by Shah Jahan. By this time, Sa'adullah Khan had become widely respected for his intelligence and talent, which had enabled his ascent in the Mughal administration despite a lack of political or family connections. He was appointed as the new Prime Minister.\nA year after his appointment, Sa'adullah Khan handled administrative issues regarding Shah Jahan's Balkh and Badakhshan campaigns. Sa'adullah Khan was sent to Balkh to manage the country and make the revenue settlements. Prince Murad Baksh was relieved of his command while Vizier Sa'adullah only took 22 days to settle the administrative affairs and returned to Kabul. He was subsequently rewarded with a Khilat and an increase of 1000 in his mansab for managing the situation efficiently and saving the Mughals from a disaster in Balkh region.\nIn 1654, he was ordered by Shah Jahan to lay siege to the Chittor Fort in Mewar, in response to provocations from Raj Singh I. He was considered among the four most powerful mughal nobles during Shah Jahan's rule. He possessed 7,000 Zat and 7,000 sowar under his command, the highest of any non-royal.\nEuropean accounts\nFirst-hand accounts of European Travelers visiting the Mughal Court are full of praise for the renowned Vizier. Sa'adullah Khan is described as a \"man esteemed by the king and the whole court\" by the Italian Traveler Nicolas Manucci, he also relates the events of the rebellion of the Bundela Rajputs which was successfully put down thanks to the cunningness of the Vizier. Francois Berner, a French physician and traveller noted that the Mughals considered Sa'adullah Khan to be the most accomplished statesman in all of Asia, his closeness to the Emperor Shah Jahan is mentioned in the work \"Travels in the Mogul Empire\". A Dutch envoy Joan Tack accused the Grand Vizier of harboring an inherent hostility toward Europeans, notably citing his role in expelling the Portuguese from Bengal. He labeled Sa‘dullah Khan a \"hereditary enemy of Christians\" and portrayed him as a symbol of Mughal despotism. In this portrayal, Sa‘dullah Khan is cast as the de facto ruler of the empire, wielding near-autocratic control over its political machinery, symbolizing the centralized authority of the Mughal state.\nFamily\nSa'adullah Khan had married the daughter of Karimdad Ansari, who was a son of Pir Jalaluddin and a grandson of Bayazid Ansari. His two sons Lutfullah Khan and Hifzullah Khan were appointed to high positions during Aurangzeb's reign, while his daughter Safiya Khanum was married to Ghazi ud-Din Khan, another prominent noble.\nDeath\nSa'adullah Khan served as Prime Minister until his death in April 1656. He was mourned by many in the Mughal court and administration as well as emperor Shah Jahan himself, who issued a public eulogy announcing his demise.\nWorks and legacy\nA collection of his letters was edited and published by the University of the Punjab in 1968. Sa'adullah Khan commissioned the Shahi Mosque in his hometown of Chiniot.\nSa'adullah Khan's reputation as a administrator endured for generations. His accomplishments were stated to be a source of honour for Punjabis by his near contemporary poet Mita Chenabi in his Tuḥfat al-Panjāb. He has been called as the best of the Mughal Grand Viziers by Ibn Hasan. According to an anecdote from the reign of Emperor Bahadur Shah I (1707–1712), Aurangzeb's successor, when a later vizier, Hidayatullah Khan Kashmiri, sought the prestigious title of 'Sa'adullah Khan,' the Emperor replied that it was \"not easy to be a Sa'adullah Khan, let him be known as Sa'idullah Khan\".\nReferences"
