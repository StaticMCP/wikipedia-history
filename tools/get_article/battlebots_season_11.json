This is the fourth season of Battlebots to premiere on Discovery Channel and the sixth season since the show was rebooted in 2015. The show continued to use their modified logo, with a pair of \"B\"'s, making a \"BB\" logo atop the term \"BATTLEBOTS\", as well as the subtitle, \"Fight Night\" for qualifying rounds.\nMLB/NFL Sportscaster Chris Rose and former UFC fighter Kenny Florian return to host for the eleventh season, as well as arena announcer Faruq Tauheed and \"Bot Whisperer\" Pete Abrahamson.\nBrand new this season, in the ever evolving sport of combat robotics, the BattleBox changes with the inclusion of an \"upper deck\", complete with its own set of spinning saw blades, totally adds new geometry angles to the playing surface.\nAlso new for this season, BattleBots has changed locations from Los Angeles, California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, now known as \"The Fight Capital of the World\".\nFilming\nThe matches took place between Monday, August 23, 2021, culminating on September 4, 2021.

Tournament rounds took place on August 29 and 31, and September 2, 3, and 4.  As with the qualifying rounds, there were two rounds of fights each day at the same times as the qualifiers.\nCaesars Entertainment Studios, at 4165 Koval Lane, was the new venue for the battlebox and the pits.  Previously, competitions had taken place in the former Boeing Post 52 building at the Long Beach Airport.\nJudges\nThis season, the judges score on an 11-point scale: 5 points for damage; 3 points for aggression; and 3 points for control.\nThe current judges are: former BattleBots contenders, Derek Young, Lisa Winter, and Jason Bardis.\nContestants\nThis season marked the 22nd year of the BattleBots competition. The lineup features 62 of the best heavyweight robots to fight head-to-head in the Battle Arena.\nEvery team will fight up to three times in the qualifying rounds.
