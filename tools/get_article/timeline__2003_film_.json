Based on Michael Crichton's 1999 novel of the same name, the film concerns a team of present-day archaeology and history students who are sent back in time to medieval France to rescue their professor from the middle of a battle.\nJerry Goldsmith composed the original score, which would have been his last released before his death in 2004, but was replaced with a new score by Brian Tyler, after the first cut of the film was re-edited and Goldsmith's increasing health problems prevented him from continuing. The film was poorly received by critics and bombed at the box office, losing an estimated $49 million.\nPlot\nCastlegard, a village near La Roque Castle in Dordogne, France, is the site of the 1357 hanging of Lady Claire, sister to Arnaut de Cervole. Her martyrdom led France to win the Hundred Years War against the English. While excavating a nearby monastery, an archaeological team finds a sarcophagus containing the remains of a French knight with a lopped ear, holding the hand of his lady, an unheard-of practice for the time.\nProfessor Edward Johnston, the team's leader, travels to the American headquarters of the ITC Corporation, his project's sponsor, to learn if they have tampered with the site. Johnston's students Kate Erickson, Josh Stern, and François Dontelle, along with Scottish archaeologist André Marek; and Professor Johnston's son Chris, discover a lens from Johnston's bifocals and a note begging for help, although both date over 600 years old. ITC later invites them to its headquarters.\nIn the process of developing teleportation technology, ITC locked onto a stable wormhole to 1357 Castlegard. Johnston was invited to see the past for himself, but his group has not returned, and ITC wants Marek and company to go back in time to locate him. All but Josh volunteer to go.\nThe volunteers are stripped of all modern technology save for markers they can use to initiate their return. They are joined by a security team including ITC's head of security, Frank Gordon, and two former military men.\nOn arrival in 1357, the team appears in the path of a young woman chased by English knights; the security men are killed while protecting the group, although one activates his marker after priming a grenade. When his body arrives in the present, the grenade detonates and shatters much of the teleportation device. Josh aids ITC vice-president Steven Kramer in making repairs in order for the team to return.\nThe team evades the knights, and the woman leads them to the English-controlled Castlegard. They are captured and brought before Lord Oliver de Vannes and his second-in-command, DeKere. When interrogated and discover to speak the English tongue, the team members claim to be Scottish. After hearing Dontelle's dialect, De Vannes kills François, believing him to be a French spy. The others are imprisoned along with Johnston, who previously promised de Vannes that he could make Greek fire for the English in exchange for his life. They escape but are pursued by the English. Gordon and Johnston are recaptured, while the others make for the monastery, led by the woman.\nDeKere reveals himself to Gordon and Johnston as former ITC employee William Decker; he had frequently used the teleportation device but was not told by ITC that each use damaged his DNA until it was too late, at which point he would die on a return trip. He plans revenge on ITC and kills Gordon. De Vannes orders his knights to march on LaRoque castle, and DeKere brings Johnston along.\nAt the monastery, Marek, Kate, and Chris meet de Cervole and realize that the woman is Lady Claire; they have changed history by saving her. Kate and Chris help to swing the upcoming battle in the French's favor by leading de Cervole's men through the monastery tunnels they had previously mapped to the castle.\nAs the battle starts, Marek frees Johnston, while Chris helps de Cervole defeat de Vannes. Enraged, DeKere slashes off Marek's earlobe, and Marek realizes that he is destined to be the knight in the sarcophagus. Marek defeats DeKere, recovers the markers, gives them to the others, and says his goodbyes while running off to help the French assure victory and restore history.\nIn the present, Josh and Kramer finish the repairs. ITC president Robert Doniger, who tried to sabotage their attempts, fears that when the students' stories become public, ITC will suffer financially. As the machine activates, Doniger races into it, attempting to block the teleportation, but instead is sent back to 1357, where he arrives outside the castle and is presumably killed by a charging knight.\nChris, Kate, and Johnston safely return while Marek chooses to stay behind. Later, the team returns to the Castlegard ruins, re-examines the sarcophagus, and finds that Marek and Lady Claire lived together after the war and had three children: Christophe, Katherine, and François.\nCast\nProduction\nThe battle sequences used medieval reenactors. Richard Donner limited the use of CGI in the film as much as possible.\nComposer Jerry Goldsmith, who had previously collaborated with Donner on The Omen, completed a score for the filmthe last score he worked on before his death in 2004 (his last score used in a film was for the 2003 film Looney Tunes: Back in Action)but it was replaced by a different score composed by Brian Tyler after Donner was forced to re-cut the film at the insistence of Sherry Lansing, the then-head of Paramount Pictures. However, both Goldsmith and Tyler's scores were released on CD.\nReception\nBox office\nIn the United States and Canada, Timeline grossed $19.5million, with $24.4million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $43.9million, against a budget of $80million. It opened at No.12, then rose to No.8 in its second weekits only week in the Top10 at the domestic box office. In 2018, Newsweek included it in an article about box office bombs.\nCritical response\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nKirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"[g]lorious so-bad-it's-good entertainment.\"\nRoger Ebert gave it 2 stars out of 4, and wrote that it was \"not so much about travel between the past and the present as about travel between two movie genres\" namely \"a corporate thriller crossed with a medieval swashbuckler\". He was disappointed that the elaborate premise was not put to greater use, that it was essentially nothing more than a frame for action scenes.\nRobert Koehler of Variety wrote: \"Lacks the consistent tone, pace and point of view for either a science fiction thriller or medieval war adventure.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
