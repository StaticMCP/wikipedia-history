He graduated from Brown University in 1863. In 1868, he was appointed professor of Latin and modern languages at Madison (now Colgate) University. In 1874–75, he  traveled abroad, and after being ordained into the Baptist ministry in the latter year, served as pastor of a church in Orange, New Jersey, until 1881. Thereafter to the time of his death, he occupied the pulpit of a New York City church first known as the Berean Church, later as the Memorial Baptist, and finally as the Judson Memorial Church, which was erected on Washington Square to house the congregation. He lectured on theology at the University of Chicago (1904–06),  on Baptist principles and polity at Union Theological Seminary (1906–08), and was named professor of pastoral polity at Colgate. He wrote a biography of his father, and later, The Institutional Church.\nHe died at Roosevelt Hospital in New York on October 23, 1914.\nWorks\n* [https://archive.org/details/lifeofadoniramj00juds The Life of Adoniram Judson] (1883)\n* [https://archive.org/details/newlaudesdominis00robi The New Laudes Domini: A Selection of Spiritual Songs, Ancient and Modern for Use in Baptist Churches] (1892)\n* [https://archive.org/details/institutionalchu00juds The Institutional Church: A Primer in Pastoral Theology]'' (1899)\nReferences\n*"
