Situated in Dambana, the temple is located about  away from the ancient temple Mahiyangana Raja Maha Vihara. The temple has been declared as one of archaeological sites in Sri Lanka.\nHistory\nIt is believed that the history of Mawaragala Forest Hermitage dates back to the reign of King Valagamba (103 BC and c. 89–77 BC) and arhat Maliyadeva. Sixty Buddhist monks lived there during that time. Cave inscriptions written in early Brahmi script and Old Sinhala Prakrit have been found at this site.\nReferences"
