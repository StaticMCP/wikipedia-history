It was issued in November 1984 as a non-album single with Ross Cockle (Glenn Shorrock, Real Life) co-producing for Regular Records – their first recording for that label. It was co-written by band mates Ceberano, Charlesworth, Cox, Goodge, Hogarth and Newman. They also co-wrote its B-side \"Take It to the Bridge\".\nRecording\nGoodge later recalled how they had scrapped earlier efforts to record \"Trust Me\" when working with label co-owner Cameron Allan, \"we just didn't see eye to eye. We didn't even reach the mix stage.\" They found Cockle was \"more egalitarian\". Goodge acknowledges influences from \"Street Dance\" by Break Machine and \"Let the Music Play\" by Shannon, while their own track was \"a mix of Freestyle and the lighter Beat Street production sound\". For the 12\" mix the group \"set it out for the engineer in extended form and got them to add some delays etc. to the material.\"\nCockle later said, \"It was a great combination with Kate and Zan. There was a freshness about them. Robert could play, Barbara was great- they looked and sounded fun. Robert knew exactly what he was after sound-wise and was quite single-minded about how it was to be executed. We recorded in a day and a half.\" Ceberano added, \"I'm Talking's goal was to get funk and groove on the Australian charts.\"\nReception\nPaul Gardiner of The Canberra Times described \"Trust Me\" as, \"a piece of pulsating smokey funk with soul vocals that, if a deal short of perfection, is nevertheless extremely good and certainly better than anything else in that bag produced in Australia.\"\nTrack listing\n; 7\" single (RRSP 744)\n* Side A \"Trust Me\" - 3:41\n* Side B \"Take It to the Bridge\" - 3:40\n; 12\" single (RRT 615)\n* Side A \"Trust Me\" (Extended) - 5:40\n* Side B \"Take It to the Bridge\" - 3:40\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!Chart (1984/85)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1985)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 73\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
