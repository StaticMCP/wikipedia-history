It has appeared on international best seller lists including the New York Times Best Seller list and the South China Morning Post Best Seller List. Additionally the book was adapted for radio by BBC Radio 4.\nSummary\nThe victim was Pamela Werner, 19-year-old daughter of retired British consul E. T. C. Werner and academic resident in Peking. Her killing and mutilation while cycling home from an evening of ice skating remain unsolved. The expatriate community in Peking were shocked at the crime which, without specific evidence, was variously attributed to a Japanese secret society or an American organized sex ring. An Englishman resident in China claimed to have been informed by Japanese military officers that Werner's death was in retaliation for the killing of a Japanese soldier by British soldiers in a drunken brawl. Although the source was a known eccentric, British diplomats provisionally accepted this account while not taking the matter further.\nAdaptation\nKudos Film and Television have plans for an onscreen adaptation of Midnight in Peking as a miniseries. The Executive Producer of the TV adaptation is Ollie Madden.\nAwards\n* 2013 Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime\n* 2013 Crime Writers' Association Dagger Award for Non-Fiction\n* 2013 Mystery Readers International Macavity Awards for Best Mystery Non-Fiction (nominated)\n* 2012 Australian Book Industry Awards – International Success of the Year, 2012\nReferences and further reading\n* .\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://us.midnightinpeking.com/ Official website for Midnight in Peking]"
