In general, Reserve Corps and Reserve Divisions were weaker than their active counterparts\n:Reserve Infantry Regiments did not always have three battalions nor necessarily contain a machine gun company\n:Reserve Jäger Battalions did not have a machine gun company on formation\n:Reserve Cavalry Regiments consisted of just three squadrons\n:Reserve Field Artillery Regiments usually consisted of two abteilungen of three batteries each\n:Corps Troops generally consisted of a Telephone Detachment and four sections of munition columns and trains\nThe IX Reserve Corps was exceptional as it formed the major part of the North Army so was provided with more Corps Troops than other Reserve Corps: a Foot Artillery Battalion, a Pioneer Regiment and a Field Airship Detachment.\nIn summary, IX Reserve Corps mobilised with 25 infantry battalions, 5 machine gun companies (30 machine guns), 6 cavalry squadrons, 12 field artillery batteries (72 guns), 4 heavy batteries (16 guns), a Field Airship Detachment and 7 pioneer companies. 17th Reserve Division was slightly stronger than the norm as it included an active infantry brigade.\n{| style=\"float: right;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-size: 100%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:grey; color:black;\"\n!
