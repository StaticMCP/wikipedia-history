The group consists of over a hundred members drawn from across the UK political parties. The awards were the brainchild Bob Blizzard (Waveney MP), a long-time enthusiast of the jazz genre who was concerned that there was a lack of national recognition for the work of jazz performers and venues across the UK. Blizzard was involved with organising and running the awards for 11 years. Also supporting the awards are Jazz Services, Jazz UK, Jazzwise, the UK Musicians' Union jazz section, and PPL.\nThere are nine categories:\n# Jazz Musician of the Year\n# Jazz Ensemble of the Year\n# Jazz Venue of the Year\n# Jazz Journalist of the Year\n# Jazz CD of the Year (released during the previous year by a band or musician)\n# Jazz Broadcaster of the Year\n# Jazz Publication of the Year\n# Jazz Education Award (for a person who has contributed to jazz in education)\n# Services to Jazz Award\nIn 2009, a special award was presented to Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, as a tribute to the 50th anniversary of the well-known London club that year.\nWinners\nSource:\n2008\n* Jazz Musician of the Year: Liane Carroll\n* Jazz CD: The Amadeus Project&nbsp;– Guy Barker\n* Jazz Ensemble&nbsp;–
