Kirby Smith\n*Incomplete appointments\n*State militia generals\nThe Confederate and United States processes for appointment, nomination and confirmation of general officers were essentially the same. The military laws of the United States required that a person be nominated as a general officer by the president and be confirmed by the Senate and that his commission be signed and sealed by the president.\nDespite legal interpretations that would preclude posthumous confirmation of appointments or delivery of commissions, the U.S. Senate and the Confederate Senate confirmed a few appointments of officers known to be dead and did not recall or revoke a few other confirmed appointments for officers who had recently died or died before receiving their commissions. No brevet appointments were made in the Confederate States Army but twenty acting or temporary general officers were authorized by and appointed under Confederate States law. At least one State militia (Virginia) had at least one brevet general (Francis Henney Smith).\nAlthough not as prevalent as in the Union Army, some dates of rank in the Confederate States Army were before the date of appointment or commission. Under an Act of September 1, 1861, the Confederate Congress permitted Confederate President Jefferson Davis to make recess appointments and nominations subject to Confederate Senate confirmation during the next term. Confederate Senate confirmation of general officer appointments was usually prompt early in the war but often was delayed in the last two years of the war.\nDetails concerning Confederate officers who were appointed to duty as generals late in the war by General E. Kirby Smith in the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department, who have been thought of as generals and exercised command as generals but who were not duly appointed and confirmed or commissioned, and state militia generals who had field commands in certain actions in their home states but were never given appointments or commissions in the Confederate States Army are in the List of American Civil War generals (Acting Confederate). Not all colonels or lower ranking officers who exercised brigade or division command at any time are in this list but those most often erroneously referred to as generals are. A few acting or temporary Confederate generals were duly appointed and confirmed as such. The full entries for these officers are in this list.\nThe notes mainly show pre-war military education or experience, pre-war political office, ranks and appointments prior to general officer appointments, some major assignments or events, information on wounds, killed in action or otherwise during the war, a few close relationships, deaths soon after the war, several of the longest lived generals and Spanish–American War service.\nAs noted above official CS rank was shown as a collar insignia of three stars within a wreath for all grades of general officers; there were exceptions to this rule: Robert E. Lee always wore rank insignia of a colonel (three stars without a wreath); Benjamin McCulloch always disliked army uniforms and was wearing a black velvet civilian suit and Wellington boots at the time of his death; Joseph L. Hogg died of disease before he could put on a uniform.\nAbbreviations and notes:\n*Rank column: conf. = date appointment confirmed by Confederate Senate; nom. = date nominated by Confederate President Jefferson Davis; rank = date of rank\n*USMA = United States Military Academy at West Point, New York;\n*South Carolina Military Academy = Predecessor to The Citadel at Charleston, South Carolina;\n*VMI = Virginia Military Institute at Lexington, Virginia\n*Additional notes: ranks: lt. = lieutenant\nA\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Image!!Name!!Rank!!class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n|-\n|\n|Adams, Daniel Weisiger\n|style=white-space:nowrap|Brigadier generalrank, nom: May 23, 1862conf: September 30, 1862\n|\n* Mississippi state senator, 1852&ndash;1856.\n* Brother of William Wirt Adams.\n* 1st Louisiana Infantry: lieutenant colonel, March 13, 1861, colonel, October 30, 1861.\n* Lost right eye at Shiloh.\n* Wounded: Perryville, Stones River.\n* Wounded, captured at Chickamauga.\n* Exchanged 1864.\n|-\n|\n|Adams, John\n|style=white-space:nowrap|Brigadier generalrank: December 29, 1862nom: January 9, 1863re-nom: May 23, 1863conf: February 17, 1864\n|\n* USMA, 1846.\n* Mexican–American War.\n* Resigned as captain, U.S. Army, May 31, 1861.\n* Appointed captain of cavalry in command at Memphis, August 27, 1861.
