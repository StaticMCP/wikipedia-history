Nebraska's 24 pledged delegates were allocated based on the results of the primary.\nHaving already been the presumptive nominee for over two months, John Kerry won the primary by a considerable margin and earned all of the state's 24 delegates.\nProcedure\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:right;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!

Total pledged delegates\n! 24\n|}\nNebraska was allocated 31 delegates to the Democratic National Convention: 24 were allocated based on the results of the primary, with the other seven being unpledged superdelegates.\nIn order to qualify for delegates, a candidate had to receive at least 15% of the vote statewide or in at least one congressional district. 16 of Nebraska's delegates were allotted among the state's three congressional districts. The remaining eight delegates were allocated based on the statewide popular vote, consisting of three at-large delegates and five pledged PLEOs (party leaders and elected officials).\nResults\nHaving won enough delegates to secure the nomination on Super Tuesday, John Kerry faced only minor opposition from Dennis Kucinich, the only other candidate on the ballot who was still campaigning. Kerry won over 72% of the vote and netted all 24 of the state's pledged delegates.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" |2004 Nebraska Democratic presidential primary\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" |Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Delegates\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" data-sort-value=\"Kerry\" | John Kerry\n|52,479\n|72.22\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |24\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" data-sort-value=\"Edwards\" | John Edwards(withdrawn)\n|10,031\n|13.81\n| rowspan=\"6\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" data-sort-value=\"Dean\" | Howard Dean(withdrawn)\n|5,400\n|7.43\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" data-sort-value=\"Kucinich\" | Dennis Kucinich\n|1,490\n|2.05\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" data-sort-value=\"Sharpton\" | Al Sharpton(withdrawn)\n|1,367\n|1.88\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" data-sort-value=\"Write-ins\" | Write-ins\n|1,090\n|1.50\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" data-sort-value=\"LaRouche\" | Lyndon LaRouche\n|805\n|1.11\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!Total\n!72,662\n!100%\n!24\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
