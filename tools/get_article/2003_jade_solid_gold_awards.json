It is part of the Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation series held in Hong Kong.\nCorruption incident\nIn 2003 Hong Kong's anti-corruption unit ICAC launched an investigation on TVB as a number of people have been bribing the music industry to win awards.    Some of the individuals arrested include Juno Mak, and his father, Clement Mak, who was the chairman of CCT Telecom.  Probes were launched after murmurings that TV execs, music company bosses & a singer & his father were involved in backroom dealings that gave music awards not according to merit but on personal connections.  Juno was booed by the public when accepting the award. Juno, his father and other industry figures including EEG chairman Albert Yeung were arrested at some stage.\nTop 10 song awards\nThe top 10 songs (十大勁歌金曲) of 2003 are as follows.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=40% | Song name in Chinese\n! width=40% | Artist\n|-\n| 如果有一天 || Andy Lau\n|-\n| 兩個人的幸運 || Gigi Leung\n|-\n| 我不會唱歌 || Hacken Lee\n|-\n| 我的驕傲 || Joey Yung\n|-\n| 可惜我是水瓶座 || Miriam Yeung\n|-\n| 她比我醜 || Kelly Chen\n|-\n| 一步一生 || Andy Hui\n|-\n| 十面埋伏 || Eason Chan\n|-\n| 七友 || Edmond Leung\n|-\n| 下一站天后 || Twins\n|-\n|}\nAdditional awards\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=40% | Award\n! width=20% | Song(if available for award)\n! width=40% | Recipient\n|-\n| The most popular new artist (最受歡迎新人獎) || - || (gold) 2R\n|-\n| - || - || (silver) Deep Ng\n|-\n| - || - || (bronze) Don Li\n|-\n| Most popular online song (最受歡迎網絡金曲獎) || 必殺技 || (gold) Leo Ku\n|-\n| - || 身外情 || (silver) Anthony Wong\n|-\n| - || 半成年 || (bronze) Shine\n|-\n| The most popular commercial song (最受歡迎廣告歌曲大獎) || 落地開花 || (gold) Candy Lo\n|-\n| - || 貪你可愛 || (silver) Cookies\n|-\n| - || 口袋情人 || (bronze) Sky\n|-\n| Most popular mandarin song (最受歡迎國語歌曲獎) || 看透 || (gold) Karen Mok\n|-\n| - || 什麼都不怕 || (silver) Miriam Yeung\n|-\n| - || 期待 || (bronze) Hins Cheung\n|-\n| The best group song (最受歡迎合唱歌曲獎) || 特別鳴謝 || (gold) Jade Kwan, Edwin Siu\n|-\n| - || 好心好報(合唱版) || (silver) Alex Fong, Stephy Tang\n|-\n| - || Kiss Kiss || (gold) EO2, Tiffany Lee (李蘢怡)\n|-\n| Most popular self-composed singer (最受歡迎唱作歌星) || - || (gold) Nicholas Tse\n|-\n| - || - || (silver) Ronald Cheng\n|-\n| - || - || (bronze) Patrick Tang\n|-\n| Outstanding performance award (傑出表現獎) || - || (dual gold) Yumiko Cheng, Jordan Chan\n|-\n| - || - || (bronze) Bobo Chan\n|-\n| Rising star song (新星試打金曲獎) || La La 世界 || Boy'z\n|-\n| Most popular adapted song award(最受歡迎改編歌曲演繹大獎) || 戒男 || Juno Mak, Emme Wong\n|-\n| The best compositions (最佳作曲) || 我的驕傲 || Joey Yung\n|-\n| The best lyrics (最佳填詞) || 失戀王 || Wyman Wong, performed by Jordan Chan\n|-\n| The best music arrangement (最佳編曲) || 傷逝 || Eric Kwok, performed by Sally Yeh\n|-\n| The best song producer (最佳歌曲監製) || 安靜 || Jay Chou\n|-\n| Community chest charity award(公益金慈善金曲大獎) || 有誰共鳴 || Andy Lau, Kelly Chen\n|-\n| Four channel award (四台聯頒傳媒大獎) || - || Twins, Joey Yung\n|-\n| Jade solid gold honours award(十大勁歌金曲榮譽大獎) || - || Richard Lam\n|-\n| Asian Pacific most popular Hong Kong male artist(亞太區最受歡迎香港男歌星獎) || - || Andy Lau\n|-\n| Asian Pacific most popular Hong Kong female artist(亞太區最受歡迎香港女歌星獎) || - || Kelly Chen\n|-\n| The most popular male artist (最受歡迎男歌星) || - || Hacken Lee\n|-\n| The most popular female artist (最受歡迎女歌星) || - || Joey Yung\n|-\n| Gold song gold award (金曲金獎) || 我的驕傲 || Joey Yung\n|-\n|}\nNotes\nhttp://www.inovasisolution.com - solid gold\nReferences\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080127005742/http://tvcity.tvb.com/jsg/awards/awards_5048485116481164106171108186113170247166177188250.html Top ten songs award 2003, Tvcity.tvb.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080130082602/http://tvcity.tvb.com/jsg/awards/awards_5048485116822816576188250182181.html Additional awards 2003, Tvcity.tvb.com]"
