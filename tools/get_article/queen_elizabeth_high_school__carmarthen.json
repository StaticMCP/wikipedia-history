Lodging with foster parents, on investigation in 2010 by the UK Border Agency, he claimed that he had no family. He was subject to a deportation order, and the school became the centre of a campaign to allow him to stay in the UK, which resulted in a 4,000 signature petition being collected and presented to Gordon Brown. After further investigation by S4C's current affairs programme 'Y Byd ar Bedwar'  his true identity was revealed. Shahzad was deported to Pakistan on 1 June 2011.\nNotable former pupils\n* Emrys G.
