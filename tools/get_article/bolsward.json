Bolsward has a population of just under 10,200. It is located 10&nbsp;km W.N.W. of Sneek.\nHistory\nThe town is founded on three artificial dwelling mounds, the first of which was built some time before Christ.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Bolsward was a trade center and port city connected to the North Sea via the Middle Sea. This connection was lost when the Middle Sea was reclaimed to form arable land. After this, a canal was dug to the Zuiderzee. The town is first mentioned in AD 725.\nAs a trading city, Bolsward was granted city rights by Philip the Good in 1455. Bolsward was made a member of the Hanseatic league in 1422. Before being merged into the municipality of Súdwest-Fryslân, the town of Bolsward was an independent municipality.\nNotable historical figures\nNotable historical figures born here include:\n* Juw Juwinga or Jonghema (14th century), 11th potestaat of Friesland\n* Petrus Thaborita (1450–1527), historian\n* Boetius Adamsz Bolswert (c.1580-1633), engraver\n* Schelderic Adamsz Bolswert (c.1586-1659), engraver\n* Gysbert Japiks (1603–1666), poet\n* Frederick Philipse (1626–1702), American progenitor and founder\n* Willem Muurling (1805–1882), theologian\n* Titus Brandsma (1881–1942), Carmelite philosopher\nEvents\nHeamiel.
