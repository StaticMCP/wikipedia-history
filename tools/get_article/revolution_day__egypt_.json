It is the biggest secular public holiday in Egypt and is considered the National Day of Egypt.\nAnnual celebrations marking the Revolution begin on the preceding evening, as the evening of 23 July 1952 was when the Free Officers Movement led by Mohamed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser commenced the military coup d'état that launched the Revolution, and ultimately led to the abdication of King Farouk, the penultimate King of Egypt and the Sudan. The public holiday itself is characterized by large and elaborate celebrations, including military parades and televised concerts with heavily nationalistic themes.\nHistorical Background\nThe revolution was launched by the Free Officers Movement, a clandestine group within the Egyptian military composed of nationalist officers.
