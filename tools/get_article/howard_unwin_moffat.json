Howard Moffat attended St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown in 1885.\nAfter service in the Bechuanaland Border Police, Moffat moved to Bulawayo and served in the 1893 Matabele War and the Anglo-Boer War.\nPolitical career\nHe was elected to the Legislative Council in 1923 as member for Victoria and served as Minister of Mines and Works for the First Cabinet of Southern Rhodesia under Charles Coghlan. In the 1927 Birthday Honours Moffat was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). He succeeded as premier after Coghlan's death in September 1927.\nMoffat was viewed as a conservative who believed that Rhodesia would eventually join the Union of South Africa. He oversaw the purchase, for £2 million, of the British South Africa Company's remaining mineral rights in Southern Rhodesia. His government passed the 1930 Land Apportionment Act, which defined the pattern of land allocation and ownership and is viewed as being one of the ultimate causes of the land disputes during land reform in Zimbabwe from 2000. He resigned in 1933 and was succeeded by George Mitchell. In the 1933 general election he lost his seat. On 6 July 1933 he was granted retention of The Honourable for life.\nLater life\nIn the 1939 general election Moffat attempted to restart the Rhodesia Party but this met with failure.\nAwards\n*\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*Bridger, P., House, M., and others, 1973.
