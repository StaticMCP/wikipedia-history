In 1815 the German Confederation was created and Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt\nalong with other German monarchies joining. The last years of his reign saw the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 where Prince Friedrich Günther kept Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt neutral and following the conclusion of the war the creation of the North German Confederation.\nFollowing his death at Heidecksburg castle he was succeeded as prince by his brother Prince Albert as all of his sons by his first wife had predeceased him and his son by his second wife, Prince Sizzo of Leutenberg was born from a morganatic marriage.\nMarriages and children\nPrince Friedrich Günther was married three times:\nHis first wife was Princess Auguste of Anhalt-Dessau (1793–1854) whom he married on 15 April 1816 at Dessau.

She was a daughter of Prince George Bernhard of Anhalt-Dessau in his second morganatic marriage, but she was adopted by her paternal uncle William on 1 April 1855 and assumed the title of \"Princess of Anhalt\"; however, this marriage was considered morganatic under the House Laws of the Schwarzburg family, and their children were created Prince and Princess of Leutenberg.\n*Princess Helene (1860–1937), married Prince Johann Heinrich Friedrich August of Schoenaich-Carolath (1849-1910)\n*Prince Sizzo (1860–1926)\nHis third wife was Marie Schultze (1840–1909) whom he married at Schwarzburg on 24 September 1861.
