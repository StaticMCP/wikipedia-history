There are a total of seven individual awards given to players or coaches based on their performance in the regular season. For the majority of the awards, nominees are selected by the league and voted on by members of the media. The winner of each award receives an Inuit soapstone sculpture designed by artists from Cape Dorset, Nunavut.\nThe CPL Awards were first held in 2019 and included five honours (Golden Boot, Golden Glove, Coach of the Year, U21 Canadian Player of the Year, and Player of the Year). The awards initially took into account performance across the whole CPL season, including playoffs and finals.\nIn 2022, two new awards were added (Defender of the Year and Players' Player of the Year) and all awards became based solely on performance in the regular season. In 2024, a Finals MVP trophy was added.\nAwards\nGolden Boot\nThe Golden Boot is awarded to the player who scores the most goals in the regular season. In the event of a tie, the award is shared between all players level on goals.\n{|class='wikitable'\n|-\n!Season\n!Winner\n!Goals\n!Games\n!Rate\n|-\n|align=center|2019\n| Tristan Borges (Forge FC)\n|align=center|13\n|align=center|27\n|\n|-\n|align=center|2020\n| Akeem Garcia (HFX Wanderers FC)\n|align=center|6\n|align=center|11\n|\n|-\n|align=center|2021\n| João Morelli (HFX Wanderers FC)\n|align=center rowspan=\"1\"|14\n|align=center|21\n|\n|-\n|align=center|2022\n| Alejandro Díaz (Pacific FC)\n|align=center rowspan=\"1\"|13\n|align=center|18\n|\n|-\n|align=center rowspan=\"2\"|2023\n| Ollie Bassett (Atlético Ottawa)\n|align=center | 11\n|align=center|27\n|\n|-\n| Myer Bevan (Cavalry FC)\n|align=center | 11\n|align=center|26\n|\n|-\n|align=center|2024\n| Tobias Warschewski (Cavalry FC)\n|align=center|12\n|align=center|24\n|0.50\n|-\n|align=center|2025\n| Samuel Salter (Atlético Ottawa)\n|align=center|19\n|align=center|28\n|0.68\n|}\nGolden Glove\nThe Golden Glove is the award for the goalkeeper of the year.\n{|class='wikitable'\n|-\n!Season\n!Winner\n!Finalists\n|-\n|align=center|2019\n| Marco Carducci (Cavalry FC)\n| Nathan Ingham (York9 FC) Connor James (FC Edmonton)\n|-\n|align=center|2020\n| Triston Henry (Forge FC)\n| Christian Oxner (HFX Wanderers FC)   Callum Irving (Pacific FC)\n|-\n|align=center|2021\n| Jonathan Sirois (Valour FC)\n| Marco Carducci (Cavalry FC) Triston Henry (Forge FC)\n|-\n|align=center|2022\n| Marco Carducci (Cavalry FC)\n| Nathan Ingham (Atlético Ottawa) Callum Irving (Pacific FC)\n|-\n|align=center|2023\n| Triston Henry (Forge FC)\n| Marco Carducci (Cavalry FC) Rayane Yesli (Valour FC)\n|-\n|align=center|2024\n| Emil Gazdov (Pacific FC)\n| Callum Irving (Vancouver FC) Thomas Vincensini (York United)\n|-\n|align=center|2025\n| Jassem Koleilat (Forge FC)\n| Marco Carducci (Cavalry FC) Nathan Ingham (Atlético Ottawa)\n|-\n|}\nCoach of the Year\nIn 2022, this award was voted on by head coaches and one assistant coach from each club.\n{|class='wikitable'\n|-\n!Season\n!Winner\n!Finalists\n|-\n|align=center|2019\n| Tommy Wheeldon Jr. (Cavalry FC)\n| Jim Brennan (York9 FC) Bobby Smyrniotis (Forge FC)\n|-\n|align=center|2020\n| Stephen Hart (HFX Wanderers FC)\n| Bobby Smyrniotis (Forge FC) Mista (Atlético Ottawa)\n|-\n|align=center|2021\n| Pa-Modou Kah (Pacific FC)\n| Bobby Smyrniotis (Forge FC) Tommy Wheeldon Jr. (Cavalry FC)\n|-\n|align=center|2022\n| Carlos González (Atlético Ottawa)\n| Bobby Smyrniotis (Forge FC) James Merriman (Pacific FC)\n|-\n|align=center|2023\n| Tommy Wheeldon Jr. (Cavalry FC)\n| Bobby Smyrniotis (Forge FC) Patrice Gheisar (HFX Wanderers FC)\n|-\n|align=center|2024\n| Bobby Smyrniotis (Forge FC)\n| Benjamín Mora (York United) Tommy Wheeldon Jr. (Cavalry FC)\n|-\n|align=center|2025\n| Bobby Smyrniotis (Forge FC)\n|\n|}\nPlayer of the Year\nThis is awarded to the league's most valuable player, as voted by the media.
