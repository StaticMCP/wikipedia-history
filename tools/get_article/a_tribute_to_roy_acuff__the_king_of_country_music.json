The album received positive reviews and reception from critics following its release.\nBackground and content\nIn the early 1960s, Hank Locklin became a more established country music artist. He had a series of major country hits, which included \"Send Me the Pillow (That You Dream On),\" \"Geisha Girl\" and \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling.\" The latter tune was a number one hit and crossed over into the pop charts. His new success allowed him to record more studio albums. Among the albums Locklin chose to record during this era was a tribute collection to country performer, Roy Acuff. Locklin was largely influenced by Acuff's music and was his first tribute project to be released with the RCA label. A Tribute to Roy Acuff was recorded at the RCA Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. The sessions for the album were produced by Chet Atkins, who also produced Locklin's previous three studio projects. Anita Kerr also co-produced the project.\nA total of 12 songs were included on the album that were notable recordings by Acuff. Two of the tracks were composed by Acuff himself: \"Precious Jewel\" and \"As Long as I Live.\" Other songs were composed by others and were recorded by others before Acuff chose to perform them. This includes \"Wabash Cannonball\" and \"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.\" Acuff's original recordings featured a simpler, traditional country musical style. Meanwhile, Locklin's renditions included more instrumentation, such as background vocals from the Anita Kerr Singers and more guitar presence.\nRelease and reception\n| rev2      = Billboard\n| rev2Score = Favorable\n}}\nA Tribute to Roy Acuff was released in February 1962 on RCA Victor Records.
