The FFI is intended to enhance employee growth and performance by focusing on successful past behaviors and their underlying conditions, rather than concentrating on problems or deficits. It is designed to create a positive dialogue, reducing defensiveness, and providing both interviewer and interviewee opportunities to gain new insights.\nOverview\nThe FFI consists of five distinct stages, each aimed at eliciting positive narratives from the interviewee about their best work experiences: Recognition of negative experiences, elication of a work story in which the interviewee felt full of life, inquiry about the climax of the story, analyses of the conditions that made the story possible, and a feedforward question, about how to replicate the conditions present in the story. This approach encourages self-reflection and  promotes a deeper understanding between the interviewer and the interviewee. The FFI is based on Appreciative Inquiry and grounded in psychological principles that emphasize the importance of positive emotions, bonding, and psychological safety in the workplace.\nThe Feedforward Interview (FFI) was developed by organizational psychologists Avraham N. Kluger and Dina Nir and first described in an academic conference in [https://www.academia.edu/68859161/Feedforward_1_Feed_forward_first_feedback_later 2006] and academic literature in 2010. The technique was created as an alternative to traditional feedback-based performance appriaisal, drawing on the principles of Appreciative Inquiry—an approach that emphasizes the exploration of strengths, successes, and positive experiences rather than focusing on weaknesses or problems. The FFI’s roots in Appreciative Inquiry, Positive psychology and Positive organizational behavior reflect a shift in organizational behavior research toward methods that foster positive emotions and harness strengths to drive performance and development.\nStructure\nThe Feedforward Interview follows a structured yet conversational protocol, typically involving the following steps:\n* The interviewer invites the participant to recall and describe a specific work experience when they felt at their best.\n* Through a sequence of open-ended questions, the interviewer explores the “high point” or climax of the event and the emotions experienced.\n* The discussion focuses on identifying the internal and external conditions that enabled this positive outcome.\n* The interviewer asks a feedforward question, prompting the participant to consider how these success factors can be replicated or incorporated into future goals and plans.\nUnlike traditional feedback that can reduce performance, FFI avoids critiquing past shortcomings, instead encouraging reflection on peak experiences to inform future actions and development\nApplication\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|}\nThe Feedforward Interview is employed across several organizational contexts, including:\n* Performance management: The FFI is used either as a standalone practice or it can precede the traditional performance appraisal to reduce defensiveness.\n* Hiring and promotion: The FFI is used to help both interviewer and interviewee identify the key motivating needs of the interviewee and the conditions needed for the interviewee to best express their strengths. Both parties may realize whether there is a fit between the needs of the interviewee, the conditions requires, and the job to which the interviewee is considered.\n* Team development: The FFI facilitates a culture of appreciation by encouraging team members to share stories of peak performance and recognize each other’s strengths. The common conditions in multiple stories reveals the team's code of success.\n* Coaching and appraisal: Used in executive coaching and developmental conversations to stimulate goal setting based on past successes.\nTheoretical Mechanism\nThe specific mechanisms that contribute to FFI effectiveness include:\n* Positive Emotions: The FFI encourages participants to recall and share their peak experiences, leading to increased positive emotions.\n* Reflection: Participants engage in self-reflection, which enhances their understanding of their strengths and contributions.\n* Bonding and Psychological Safety: The process fosters a sense of connection and safety between the interviewer and interviewee, promoting open dialogue and mutual respect.\nThese mechanisms collectively contribute to intrinsic needs satisfaction, which is linked to improved well-being, performance, and collaboration within organizations.\nEmpirical Evidence\nIn a field experiment with random assignment in a Canadian company, it was found that employees interviewed by their manager using the Feedforward Interview showed higher performance than employees evaluated through traditional performance appraisals. A qualitative study among employees at a multinational company in Israel revealed that half of the employees reported that the Feedforward Interview empowered them, increased their motivation, and improved their performance. Additionally, it was noted that among their prominent responses to the interview were opportunities for quality time with the manager, a focus on strengths, and learning from past experiences. In a study among teachers, it was found that the Feedforward Interview raised awareness of how to create enjoyable teaching, and coaches reported an increase in teachers' sense of responsibility. In a field experiment without random assignment among employees in the UK, it was found that while the Feedforward Interview increased self-efficacy, confidence in abilities, and goal achievement, feedback had the opposite effect.\nLimitations and Criticism\nThe effectiveness of the Feedforward Interview is limited by situational, personal, and organizational factors. In situations where there are many negative emotions (such as during a crisis in the organization), individuals may find it difficult or unwilling to recall positive experiences. In such cases, a problem-focused Feedforward Interview can be considered, where the interviewee is asked what is most troubling them, what the root of that concern is, and what the ideal opposite of that root concern would be. The interviewer then seeks to hear a story through a Feedforward Interview tailored to elicit a narrative in which the ideal opposite was realized.\nSeveral personality traits can diminish or negate the benefits of the Feedforward Interview. Individuals suffering from depression struggle to recall episodic memories, thus reducing the effectiveness of the interview for them. The Feedforward Interview does not improve the feelings of individuals characterized by an avoidant attachment style, and generally, listening to those with an avoidant attachment style does not enhance their psychological safety. Finally, research on listening suggests that interviewers with narcissistic tendencies may find it challenging to conduct the interview effectively\nIn organizations where there is no support for the process from a senior management member committed to using the Feedforward Interview for employee well-being, the benefits of the interview will be limited, and its use within the organization will not expand or even be maintained.\nExternal Links\nBintliff, Esther (2022-07-21). \"[https://www.ft.com/content/a681ac3c-73b8-459b-843c-0d796f15020e Positive feedback: the science of criticism that actually works]\".
