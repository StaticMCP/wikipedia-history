Charney Award is the American Meteorological Society's award granted to \"individuals in recognition of highly significant research or development achievement in the atmospheric or hydrologic sciences\". The prize was originally known as the Second Half Century Award, and first awarded to mark to fiftieth anniversary of the society.\nIt is named after the meteorologist Jule G. Charney, who played a key role in developing weather prediction.\nRecipients\nSource: [https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/about-ams/ams-awards-honors/awards/search-past-award-winners/ American Meteorological Society]\n* 2024 Richard Seager.
