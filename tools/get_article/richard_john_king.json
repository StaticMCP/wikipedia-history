The lands, however, were heavily mortgaged, and in that year they were sold under pecuniary pressure, when he was also forced to part with his father's collection of pictures and the magnificent library which he himself had amassed. King then withdrew to The Limes, Crediton, and supported himself by writing. He was elected a member of the Devonshire Association in 1874, and its president in 1875, when his address dealt with the early history of Devon.\nKing died at The Limes, Crediton on 10 February 1879, and was buried in its churchyard.
