Like both its predecessors, it affiliated to the Dutch Confederation of Trade Unions (NVV).  In 1976, it formed a federation with the Catholic Union of Agriculture, Food and Tobacco (AVG).\nBy 1980, the union had 31,591 members.  Later in the year, it merged fully with the AVG, to form the Food Workers' Union.\nPresidents\n:1970: Ab Kuiper\n:1976: Cees Schelling\nReferences"
