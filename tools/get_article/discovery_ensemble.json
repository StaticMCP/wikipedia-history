The orchestra, made up of young professionals from the Boston area, gave its inaugural concert in October 2008. It disappeared from the Boston music scene after an announcement cancelling the already advertised 2014 season.\nDiscovery Ensemble had two missions. It was a chamber orchestra that performed to local acclaim in the Boston Globe and the Boston Phoenix. Concerts took place at Sanders Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nDiscovery Ensemble's second mission was education. The orchestra presented four Discovery Programs per year, each consisting of two in-school workshops and a matinee concert for children from local schools. The schools' concerts took place at Strand Theatre in Dorchester, Massachusetts.\nDiscovery Ensemble played live regularly on WGBH Radio and was featured as Critics' Choice on NPR. In December 2009, Pulitzer Prize–winning critic Lloyd Schwartz of the Boston Phoenix named Discovery Ensemble Boston's \"Best Kept Secret\".\nHistory\nThe orchestra played its first concert in October 2008 in the Strand Theatre, Dorchester with Ginastera's Variaciones concertantes, Stravinsky's Danses concertantes, and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.\nThe orchestra was founded because directors Courtney Lewis and David St. George saw the possibility, given the abundance of young professional musicians in Boston, of forming and training a large (40 players) chamber orchestra that could perform at the highest international level.\nDiscovery Ensemble was particularly associated with schools and community centers in Dorchester.\nReviews\n* [http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2009/01/27/ensemble_shows_exuberance_from_the_start/ Boston Globe 1] Ensemble Shows Exuberance from the Start\n* [http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2010/01/16/courtney_lewis_and_discovery_ensemble_help_make_classical_accessible/ Boston Globe 2] Courtney Lewis and Discovery Ensemble Help Make Classical Accessible\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121014064235/http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Music/75692-Anniversaries-and-other-occasions/?rel=inf Boston Phoenix 1] Anniversaries and Other Occasions\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121014064256/http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Music/84745-Springer-vs-Nero/?rel=inf Boston Phoenix 2] Springer vs. Nero\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121014064323/http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Music/90551-roar-of-the-crowd/?page=1#TOPCONTENT Boston Phoenix 3] The Roar of the Crowd\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121014103252/http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Music/94758-2009-The-year-in-Classical/ Boston Phoenix 4] 2009: The Year in Classical\n* [http://classical-scene.com/2009/01/24/568/ Boston Intelligencer] Harbison \"Bout of Un-relatedness\" Between Two Chestnuts\n* [http://www.dotnews.com/2009/orchestra-helps-young-people-discover-classical-music Dorchester Reporter] Orchestra Helps Young People Discover Classical Music\n* [http://www.wbur.org/2010/01/16/young-maestro WBUR] A Young Maestro’s Noble Experiment: Classical Music For All\n* [http://www.wbur.org/2010/04/09/young-conductor WBUR] A Young Conductor Leads A Noble Experiment\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.discoveryensemble.org Discovery Ensemble Website]\n* [http://www.courtneylewis.com/ Courtney Lewis Website]\n* [http://www.artsboston.org/org/detail/8545 ArtsBoston Entry]\n* [http://www.minnesotaorchestra.org/ Minnesota Orchestra]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/discoveryensemble Discovery Ensemble YouTube Page]\n* [http://www.instantencore.com/video/details.aspx?ItemId=172070 InstantEncore]\n* [http://vimeo.com/10720763 Vimeo]"
