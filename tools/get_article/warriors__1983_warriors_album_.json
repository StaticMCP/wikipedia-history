      "text": "# Warriors (1983 Warriors album)\n\nWarriors is the first studio album by Yugoslav/Canadian heavy metal band Warriors, released in 1983. It is the band's first self-titled album, the second being their second (and last) album, released in 1984.\nBackground and recording\nWarriors were formed in 1982 by vocalist Dušan Nikolić and drummer Miroslav \"Vicko\" Milatović. Milatović was at the time a member of highly successful band Riblja Čorba, Warriors being his side project. The first lineup of the band also featured guitarist Dragan Deletić, guitarist Zoran Konjević and bass guitarist Slobodan Svrdlan (a former member of the band Gordi). In 1983 this lineup of the band released the EP entitled Warriors – Ratnici, after which Milatović had to leave the band due to his  mandatory stint in the Yugoslav People's Army, and soon after Canadian guitarist Douglass Platt replaced Deletić. The band recorded their debut album with drummer Tom Martin (a former member of the band Izazov), who was, however, not credited as an official band member. The album was recorded during July and August 1983 in Radio Television Belgrade Studio V and produced by band members themselves.\nTrack listing\nAll songs credited to Warriors.\nPersonnel\n*Dušan Nikolić - vocals\n*Douglas Platt - guitar\n*Zoran Konjević - guitar\n*Slobodan Svrdlan - bass guitar\nAdditional personnel\n*Tom Martin - drums\n*Sloba Marković - keyboards\n*Predrag Jakovljević - percussion\n*Dragan Vukiċević - engineer, backing vocals (on track 9)\n*Zoran Blažina - artwork, graphic design\n*Marko Bralić - photography\nLegacy\nIn 2015 Warriors album cover, designed by Zoran Blažina, was ranked 33rd on the list of 100 Greatest Album Covers of Yugoslav Rock by web magazine Balkanrock.\nReferences\n*[https://www.discogs.com/release/1775440-Warriors-Warriors-I Warriors at Discogs]\nExternal links\n*[https://www.discogs.com/release/1775440-Warriors-Warriors-I Warriors at Discogs]"
