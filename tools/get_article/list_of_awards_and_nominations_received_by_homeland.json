The series stars Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison, a Central Intelligence Agency officer and Damian Lewis as Nicholas Brody, a U.S. Marine. Mathison has come to believe that Brody, who was held captive by al-Qaeda as a prisoner of war, was turned by the enemy and now threatens the United States.\nThe series is broadcast in the United States on the cable channel Showtime, and is produced by Fox 21. It premiered on October 2, 2011. The first episode was made available online, more than two weeks before broadcast, with viewers having to complete some tasks to unlock access. The series has received critical acclaim, as well as several industry awards, including winning the 2012 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama, and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Damian Lewis and Claire Danes, respectively. Showtime renewed the series for a second season of twelve episodes, which premiered on September 30, 2012.\nTotal nominations and awards for the cast\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Actor\n!Awards\n!Nominations\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Claire Danes\n|10\n|23\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Damian Lewis\n|3\n|8\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Mandy Patinkin\n| rowspan=\"2\" |0\n|5\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Morena Baccarin\n|1\n|}\nPrimetime Emmy Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
