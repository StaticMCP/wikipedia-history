Trump carried 39% of non-college Republican voters in Arkansas. Trump also won with 39% of veterans, a key demographic for Republican candidates in the South. Cruz and Trump split Evangelical voters with 33% each, which gave way to a close statewide result in the primary.\nMany pundits were perplexed by Trump's dominance among culturally conservative Southern whites who were expected to view him as immoral, but he benefitted from voters' racial, cultural, and economic angst that mattered more than shared values.\nThe week before the primary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, daughter of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, joined Donald J. Trump's campaign.\nSee also\n* 2016 Arkansas Democratic presidential primary\nReferences"
