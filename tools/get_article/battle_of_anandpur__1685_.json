Another reason is the Guru refusing to lend an elephant, named Prasadi, to Bhim Chand, as the Guru thought the ruler was trying to take the animal away from him permanently for himself.\nBattle\nThe Hill State allies attacked Anandpur in early 1685 but were repelled.\nAftermath\nThe Guru left Anandpur for Paonta Sahib in the same year in April or May on the summon of Raja Medni Prakash of Nahan State. One of the reasons the Guru left Anandpur is due to the hostilities he faced with the Hill kings.\nSee also\n* Nihang\n* Martyrdom and Sikhism\nReferences"
