The battle involved 250 warships, and, in terms of combined tonnage of vessels engaged, was the largest naval battle in history.\nThe Royal Navy had established a blockade of the North Sea at the start of the war and the German Hochseeflotte could not match the larger Grand Fleet. The German plan was to use the threat of an attack by their battlecruisers on British ports to lure the British battlecruisers into a trap where they could be defeated by a superior force of battleships without encountering the rest of the Grand Fleet. Aware of all German  naval movements, the British fleet sortied to support their battlecruisers and bring the German fleet to battle.\nIn the event, although more British ships were sunk or damaged, the overall strategic situation was unchanged.\nSummary\nShips present\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Warships by number and size of main armament\n!align=\"centre\"|\n!align=\"centre\"|Royal Navy\n!align=\"centre\"|Imperial German Navy\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|Dreadnoughts\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|28 in total\n8 × 15-inch\n* 2 ×  (28,000 tons displacement, 21 knots top speed)\n* 4 ×  (27,500 tons, 24 kn.)\n10 × 14-inch\n* HMS Canada (28,622 tons, 23 kn.)\n10 × 13.5-inch\n* 3 ×  (25,420 tons, 21 kn.)\n* 3 ×  (25,000 tons, 21.5 kn.)\n*  (22,780 tons, 21 kn.)\n* 4 ×  (21,922 tons, 21 kn.)\n14 × 12-inch\n:  (28,750 tons, 22 kn.)\n10 × 12-inch\n* 2 ×  (20,030 tons, 21 kn.)\n*  (19,680 tons, 21 kn.)\n* 3 ×  (19,700 tons, 21 kn.)\n* 3 ×  (18,596 tons, 21 kn.)\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| 16 in total\n10 × 12-in.\n: 4 ×  (25,420 tons, 21 kn.)\n: 4 ×  (25,389 tons, 21 kn.)\n12 × 12-in.\n: 4 ×  (22,448 tons, 20.5 kn.)\n12 × 11-in.\n: 4 ×  (18,575 tons, 19 kn.)\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|Pre-dreadnought battleships\n|\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|6 total'\n4 × 11-in.\n*  (12,999 tons, 18 kn.)\n* 5 ×  (12,983 tons, 19 kn.)\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|Battlecruisers\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|9 total\n8 × 13.5-in.\n*  (28,500 tons, 28 kn.)\n*  (26,770 tons, 28 kn.)\n* 2 ×  (26,270 tons, 27.5 kn.)\n8 × 12-in.\n* 2 ×  (18,500 tons, 25.8 kn.)\n* 3 ×  (17,250 tons, 25 kn.)\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|5 total\n8 × 12-in (30.5&nbsp;cm)\n* 2 ×  (26,200 tons, 26.5 kn.)\n10 × 11-in.\n*  (24,593 tons, 26.5 kn.)\n*  (22,216 tons, 25.5 kn.)\n8 × 11-in.\n*  (19,060 tons, 24.8 kn.)\n|-\n|Armoured cruisers\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|8 total\n4 × 9.2-in., 5 × 7.5-in.\n* 3 ×  (14,600 tons, 23 kn.)\n4 × 9.2-in., 2 × 7.5-in.\n* 2 ×  (12,590 tons, 23 kn.)\n4 × 9.2-in., 5 × 6-in.\n* 2 ×  (12,590 tons, 23 kn.)\n3 × 7.5-in., 3 × 6-in.\n*  (10,850 tons, 22 kn.)\n|-\n|Smaller ships\n|26 × light cruisers79 × destroyers (including one destroyer-minelayer)\n|11 × light cruisers61 × torpedo boats\n|}\nBritish capital ships carried a larger weight of broadside— compared to —than the German ones.\nThe German Navy's torpedo boats were of similar size and function to the destroyers in the Royal Navy, and are often referred to as such.\nLosses\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Losses of the fleets with date of loss\n|-\n!
