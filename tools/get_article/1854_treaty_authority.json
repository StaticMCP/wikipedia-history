The other Bands that signed the treaty and resided in the territory (Fond du Lac Band, Bois Forte Band) subsequently joined the lawsuit. By 1988, an out of court settlement was negotiated, resulting in a memorandum of agreement between the bands and the State of Minnesota in which their treaty rights were confirmed.\nTo enforce the regulations outlined in the agreement, in 1988, the Tri-Band Authority was established to implement the agreement and was governed by a Board of Directors, which consisted of the duly elected officials of each of the Grand Portage, Bois Forte, and the Fond du Lac Bands.  However, in 1989, Fond du Lac (who is now a party to the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission) withdrew from the agreement. The Tri-Band Authority then became the 1854 Authority and was subsequently renamed in 2006 to the 1854 Treaty Authority. Today, they continue to implement the agreement for the Grand Portage and Bois Forte Bands.\nCoverage areas\n* Grand Portage Fishing Zone of Minnesota's portion of the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe-ceded Territory ()\n* 1854 Treaty of La Pointe-ceded Territory ()—Co-managed with the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission\n* 1866 Treaty of Washington (Bois Forte band of Chippewa Indians)-ceded territory ()—No hunting, fishing or gathering, but cultural resources are reviewed and enforced.\nIssues\nThe 1854 Treaty Authority has advocated the restoration of Big Rice Lake and monitors the growth of wild rice plants there.\nMember tribes\n* Bois Forte Band of Chippewa\n* Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa (former member)\n* Grand Portage Band of Chippewa\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.1854treatyauthority.org/ The 1854 Treaty Authority's website]"
