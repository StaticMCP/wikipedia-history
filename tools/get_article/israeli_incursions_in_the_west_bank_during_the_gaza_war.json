Cooperation between the PA security forces and the IDF is reflected by the fact that the former have simply remained in their barracks during IDF raids and have actively interfered with militants' defenses against those raids.\nThe July 2024 West Bank unrest directed against the Palestinian Authority was a major escalation in its conflict with the militants, sparked by the alleged arrest attempt of \"Abu Shujaa\", the leader of the Tulkarm Brigade, on 26 July. Protestors and militants clashed with security forces in Tulkarm, Jenin, Bethlehem, Tubas, and Nablus. By August, the unrest had been \"contained\", according to Tulkarm officials.\nThe PA also launched notable operations into Tubas in October 2024 and into Jenin in December 2024. PA forces began fighting alongside Israeli forces for the first time ever during Israel's 2025 \"Iron Wall\" operation.\nOther incidents\nThere has been one case during the war where there was an incident between the IDF and the Palestinian Authority, that being the shooting death of a Palestinian Authority customs officer during an IDF raid into Tubas on 24 July 2024.\nIn the aftermath of the 3 October 2024 Tulkarm Camp airstrike by Israel, Laith Jaar, an Al Jazeera journalist who was covering the bombing was assaulted by a security officer, who threatened to shoot him.

Hamas praised the attack, while the Palestinian Security Services were said to plan an internal investigation.\nImprisonment and checkpoints\nFreedom of movement\nA report by B'Tselem found that the Israeli military had severely cracked down on Palestinians' freedom of movement, stating it was using \"its network of checkpoints to tighten supervision, setting up dozens of new checkpoints, blocking access from dozens of villages to main roads, and revoking all permits for Palestinians to enter Israel for work or other reasons\".\nMass detentions\nSettler violence and depopulation of villages\nDisplacement by military\nThe UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs reported Israeli forces demolished residential structures in Furush Beit Dajan and Deir Ballut on 25 December. The UN reported 1,094 structures had been demolished and 2,127 Palestinians have been displaced in 2023. On 27 December, UNOCHA stated that since 7 October, 1,208 people had been displaced due settler violence, 393 due to lacking Israeli building permits, 95 on punitive grounds, and 483 due to army demolitions. On 15 January 2024, Israeli forces demolished two homes in Qalqilya, rendering 14 people homeless. By 15 January, the number displaced due to army demolitions had grown to more than 600.\nIn February 2024, a Palestinian activist whose family home in East Jerusalem was destroyed by Israel stated, \"Israeli authorities want to rid [Jerusalem] of Palestinians and to change the makeup of the population.\" A U.S. State Department spokesman said that the demolitions \"damage Israel's standing in the world\".

The location has previously been attacked in 2022.\n* Al-Qanoub - In the Palestinian village of Al-Qanoub Israeli settlers descended from the nearby settlement of Asfar and the adjacent outpost of Pnei Kedem, burned houses, set their dogs on the farm animals, and, at gunpoint, ordered the residents to leave or else they would be killed.\n* Al-Farsiya Khallet Khader – According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, 40 people were displaced, after which Israeli \"settlers looted the community and stole nine tents\".\nOther settler violence\nsettlements (2020)]]\nInstances of Jewish settler violence against Palestinians grew following 7 October attack. These attacks forced Palestinians to leave their homes, as part of what experts called a \"systematic campaign\" to remove Palestinians. On 11 October 2023, settlers killed a teenage boy in the back as he ran from their gunfire. The United Nations stated on 13 December eight Palestinians had been killed by settlers since 7 October. Israeli settlers, even before the war, had been allowed to act with impunity with most crimes going unpunished. They have been reportedly enabled and even protected by Israeli soldiers during their attacks. B'tselem called settler violence an \"informal tool\" of the IDF, since settlers and soldiers conduct joint operations against Palestinians. David Ignatius, an American journalist, described the situation in the West Bank as \"a pattern of Israeli domination\" and abuse. On 25 December, at least eight Palestinians were wounded in settler attacks. On 27 December, UNOCHA reported 367 Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians since 7 October.

On 17 February, two children were beaten in a settler attack in Hebron. Peace Now stated, \"Settler violence is not an isolated incident but rather a part of an organised strategy to dispossess Palestinians of their lands\". The co-founder of Youth Against Settlements stated, \"The big problem for Hebron now is that the extremist settlers have been recruited to the Israeli army units operating in the city. They now control the lives of Palestinian residents.\" The governor of Nablus reported a 200 percent increase in settler violence.\nOn 21 February, a settler attack was reported in Asira al-Qibliya, with the town council stating settlers threw rocks, broke a car windshield, and attempted to light a car on fire. Settlers assaulted two young men and stole their car. On 25 February, settlers in Jericho stormed a Bedouin community and stole their sheep. On 29 February, the mayor of Al-Lubban ash-Sharqiya stated, \"The settlers are in the streets trying to attack [Palestinian] homes\".

In Al-Mughayyir, the violence was described as \"the worst anyone here could remember.\" Human Rights Watch stated, \"Settlers and soldiers have displaced entire Palestinian communities, destroying every home, with the apparent backing of higher Israeli authorities\". In July 2024, Israeli settlers in Bazariya reportedly set a Palestinian building supply store and bulldozer on fire.\nIn September 2024, after an Israeli goat herder was beaten by several Palestinians near Jericho, settlers stormed a local elementary school where the assailants had reportedly fled, attacking teachers and students.

Biden had earlier ordered the secretaries of state and treasury to prepare for the potential sanctions against Israeli individuals or entities that were involved in the violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich responded to Biden's order, saying it was based on \"an antisemitic lie\". Smotrich later stated, \"We will not stand aside in the face of this injustice\" and called for settlements to be \"entrenched.\" Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir praised the sanctioned settlers, calling them \"heroic\". Netanyahu criticized the sanctions and called them unnecessary. Following the U.S. sanctions, online fundraisers collected hundreds of thousands for the settlers.

Soon after, the EU announced sanctions on five Israeli individuals and three for \"serious and systematic human rights abuses\".\nInvestigations\nFollowing the killing of a Palestinian child in East Jerusalem by an Israeli police, the killer was interrogated, leading National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to call the questioning \"outrageous\" and \"disgraceful\". In response, Israel's attorney general Gali Baharav-Miara stated, \"Criminal investigations, including those of police officers, are conducted with complete independence. Any intervention by you, directly or indirectly, violates the law... this should be stopped immediately\".\nWar crimes\nOn 13 March, the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the killing of six civilians, including children, in one day, stating, \"These are war crimes and crimes against humanity according to international law\". Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib, stated, \"Colonization and the increasing violence perpetrated by settlers in the West Bank are illegal. They must stop\". In May 2024, Human Rights Watch stated, \"Israeli security forces... have been killing Palestinians without a legal basis in the West Bank, including deliberately executing Palestinians who posed no apparent threat\".\nTriple assassination in a hospital\nIsraeli forces disguised as medical staff and civilians have shot dead three Palestinians inside a hospital in the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank. Hospital says the men were 'assassinated'. Israel says they belonged to a 'Hamas terrorist cell'. The BBC called them \"members of Palestinian armed groups\". But, even if they are militants, it is a war crime to gadget them when wounded, and a war crime to impersonate doctors in the process. According to UN experts, the killing of three Palestinian men in a hospital in the occupied West Bank by Israeli commandos disguised as medical workers and Muslim women may amount to war crimes.\nAbuse of ambulance\nThe Israeli military has admitted that on 19 December 2024, its troops used an ambulance or a vehicle disguised as an ambulance and displaying Palestinian license plates to carry out a surprise operation against alleged militants in the city of Nablus. The operation failed and no militants were captured or shot; however, Israeli soldiers who jumped from the ambulance and a nearby white van were filmed executing two civilians, a 25-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman, who was standing on the street talking to her neighbor. The elderly woman was shot and, after falling to the ground and raising her hand to ask for help, was shot again and died at the scene. \"Israel is no longer trying to hide its war crimes and is acting as though the norms and rules of international law do not apply,\" declared B'Tselem.\nReactions\nPalestinian\nOn 28 December, Mustafa Barghouti, the general-secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, stated Israel's raids across the West Bank were part of a plan to reoccupy the territory completely. Residents of the West Bank were reportedly frustrated by the lack of international coverage of the incursions in the territory, stating it allowed the IDF \"to operate with almost impunity\". Mohammad Shtayyeh, the Palestinian prime minister, stated Israel's financial pressure on the West Bank was an attempt to drive it from Gaza, and that \"things might explode in the West Bank\" if the worsening conditions were not addressed. On 9 January, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry warned Israel military actions and settler violence were threatening to \"push the West Bank into an uncontrollable cycle of violence\". Journalist Mohammed Jamjoom stated violent raids were \"part of the fabric of daily life\", with an average of 40 raids per day.\nOn 16 January, Israel released the body of a toddler killed by Israeli soldiers nine days prior, leading the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to state, \"What did they do with the body? Why did they keep it? Do they have the right to do so? And will they apologise to the child's family?\" Palestinians in the West Bank stated the Israeli army regularly used bulldozers to destroy roads and infrastructure, describing the process as a form of collective punishment. Residents stated they believed Israel was attempting to turn them against the local resistance fighters.\nFollowing the International Court of Justice's issuance of provisional measures in the South Africa v. Israel case, residents of the West Bank expressed disappointment it did not call for an immediate ceasefire, and expressed fear \"the ruling in The Hague means Israeli army and settler violence in the occupied West Bank could get even worse\". On 4 February, an advocate at Al-Haq stated, \"The international community has given Israel [the green light] to do as it wishes without any form of accountability.\" Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh stated, \"We are not very far from an explosion\".\nWest Bank residents reported feeling they were being \"forced into islands\". Nidal Naghnaghiyeh, a local official in the Jenin camp, stated that Israeli forces had a \"systemic policy of killing young men\" in Jenin. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry stated Israeli checkpoints had turned the West Bank into a prison where Israeli forces and settlers could do whatever they want. In a joint statement in April 2024, Al-Haq, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights stated, \"Violent Israeli military and settler attacks have been escalating in intensity and scale\".\nIsraeli\nA report by Yesh Din noted a rise in settler violence in the West Bank since 7 October but that Israeli law enforcement had not filed a single indictment. The Israeli military described the situation in the West Bank as \"spiraling out of control\". B'Tselem stated that Israel was operating in the West Bank with an \"open-fire\" policy. Israeli activists sought to prevent what they termed an unfolding ethnic cleansing in the West Bank. Mistaclim, a group of Israeli activists, described settler violence as \"Jewish terrorism\". In May 2024, Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich addressed residents of the West Bank, stating, \"We will turn you into ruins like in the Gaza Strip\". Outgoing General Yehuda Fox criticized Israeli settler violence in July 2024, stating, \"This is not Judaism in my eyes. At least not the one I grew up with in my father and mother's house. This is not the way of the Torah.\"\nInternational organizations\nVolker Türk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated he was troubled by the use of military tactics, disproportionate force, and restrictions of movement in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

UNICEF reported on 28 January that children were living in \"constant fear and grief\".\nIn June 2024, Volker Türk stated, \"It is unfathomable that so many lives have been taken in such a wanton fashion.\" Later the same month, Türk stated, \"The situation in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is dramatically deteriorating\".\nOn 2 September 2024, Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, warned that \"Israel's genocidal violence risks leaking out of Gaza and into the occupied Palestinian territory as a whole.\" She urged the international community, \"made of both states and non-state actors, including companies and financial institutions\", to \"do everything it can to immediately end the risk of genocide against the Palestinian people under Israel's occupation, ensure accountability and ultimately end Israel's colonisation of Palestinian territory.\"\nInternational\nGerman foreign minister Annalena Baerbock stated Israel had a responsibility to protect Palestinians in the West Bank. Melani Cammett, an American political scientist, stated on 18 January that the intensification of fighting in the West Bank indicated the war \"is nowhere near over\".
