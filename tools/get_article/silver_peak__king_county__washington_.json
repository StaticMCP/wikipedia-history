It is set on the crest of the Cascade Range, on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Silver Peak is situated 4.5 miles southwest of Snoqualmie Pass, and three miles west of Keechelus Lake. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses its east flank and provides easiest access. The nearest higher neighbor is Granite Mountain,  to the north-northwest. Precipitation runoff from the east side of the mountain drains into Cold Creek, a tributary of the Yakima River, whereas the west side of the mountain drains into the South Fork Snoqualmie River via Humpback Creek.\nClimate\nSilver Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Weather fronts originating in the Pacific Ocean travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snow onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months of July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.\nSee also\n*\n*Geography of Washington (state)\nGallery\nFile:Silver Peak (from Tinkham Peak).jpg|Southeast aspect, from Tinkham Peak\nFile:Silver Peak from Granite.jpg|North aspect, from Granite Mountain\nFile:Silver Peak.jpg|The north aspect of Silver Peak seen from Interstate 90\nFile:Tinkham, Rainier, Silver.jpg|Tinkham Peak, Mt.
