J. Ryan, who had been premier since 1 June 1915. The National opposition (previously known as the Ministerialists) were led by Edward Macartney who replaced Digby Denham after the 1915 election when they were reduced to 21 seats. In turn, he was replaced by James Tolmie within three months but returned to the post shortly before the election when the latter fell ill.\nResults\nThe election saw the Labor government returned to office with an increased vote and seat count for both Labor and the National Party from the 1915 election.\n| house = Legislative Assembly\n| series = Queensland state election\n| back = 1915\n| forward = 1920\n| enrolled = 424,416\n| total_votes = 336,647\n| turnout % = 80.27\n| turnout chg = -7.87\n| informal = N/A\n| informal % = 1.18\n| informal chg = -0.39\n}}\n|}\nSeats changing party representation\nThis table lists changes in party representation at the 1918 election.\nParty changes before election\nThe following seats changed party representation before the election due to the merger of Farmers Union and Liberal Party members.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|colspan=7 |\n|-\n!

Ryan resigned as premier a year after the state election to run successfully for the federal seat of West Sydney in 1919.  Ryan was replaced as premier by Ted Theodore. Theodore called the 1920 election one year into his premiership and two years after the 1918 election. Macartney was later replaced for a second time, this time by William Vowles. Within a few months though, Vowles created the Queensland Country Party. However, because Vowles had created the Country Party using most of the rural-based National MLAs, Vowles was able to remain as Opposition Leader.\nSee also\n* Candidates of the Queensland state election, 1918\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1915–1918\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1918–1920\n* Ryan Ministry\nReferences"
