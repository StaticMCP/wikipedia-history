It succeeded their fanzine Emerald City, which shut down in November 2006. The blog's objective was to report awards, give details about how the winners were selected, and foster reader interaction.\nNotable contributors include John Clute, Joe Gordon, Chris Roberson, Anna Tambour, Jeff VanderMeer, and Gary K. Wolfe.\nThe blog had been noted as a source of \"unbiased reporting and astute commentary\" by science fiction author James Patrick Kelly in ''Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine.''\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://twitter.com/sfawardswatch Twitter account] - not updated since October 2012."
