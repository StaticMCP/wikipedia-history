Forty-three delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention were allocated on a winner-take-most basis. The contest was held on Super Tuesday alongside primaries in 14 other states.\nIn September 2023, a lawsuit was filed seeking to bar Donald Trump from appearing on the ballot. The Oklahoma Republican Party is defending against the suit and seeking to allow Trump to appear on the ballot, with party chairman Nathan Dahm saying \"someone from out of state should not be able to prohibit us, the Republicans, from determining who he wants to vote for president. That should be left up to the Republican voters in this state.\"\nCandidates\nThe following candidates filed to appear on the Oklahoma Republican presidential primary ballot:\n* Ryan Binkley (withdrew on February 27, 2024)\n* Chris Christie (withdrew on January 10, 2024)\n* Ron DeSantis (withdrew on January 21, 2024)\n* Nikki Haley\n* Asa Hutchinson (withdrew on January 16, 2024)\n* Vivek Ramaswamy (withdrew on January 15, 2024)\n* David Stuckenberg\n* Donald Trump\nEndorsements\n* Trent Shores, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma (2017–2021)\nGovernor\n* Kevin Stitt (2019–present)\nState senators\n* Lonnie Paxton, District 23 (2016–present); Assistant Majority Floor Leader (2021–present)\n* Roland Pederson, District 19 (2016–present)\n* Chris Kidd, District 31 (2016–present)\n* John Michael Montgomery, District 32 (2019–2023)\n* Brent Howard, District 38 (2019–present)\nState representatives\n* Josh West, District 5 (2017–present); Majority Leader (2019–present)\n* Jon Echols, District 90 (2012–present); Majority Floor Leader (2017–present)\n* Trey Caldwell, District 63 (2019–present); Deputy Majority Leader (2021–present)\n* John Pfeiffer, District 38 (2014–present); Deputy Majority Floor Leader (2019–present)\n* Mark Lepak, District 9 (2014–present)\n* Neil Hays, District 13 (2022–present)\n* Chris Sneed, District 14 (2018–present)\n* Terry O'Donnell, District 23 (2013–present); Speaker Pro Tempore (2021–2022); Majority Whip (2017–2020)\n* Dell Kerbs, District 26 (2016–present)\n* Ryan Martinez, District 39 (2016–2023)\n* Chad Caldwell, District 40 (2014–present)\n* Nick Archer, District 55 (2022–present)\n* Anthony Moore, District 57 (2020–present)\n* Mike Osburn, District 81 (2016–present)\n* Chris Kannady, District 91 (2014–present)\nU.S. Representatives\n* Josh Brecheen, OK-02 (2023–present)\n* Kevin Hern, OK-01 (2018–present)\nState executive officials\n* Cindy Byrd, Auditor and Inspector of Oklahoma (2019-present)\n*Ryan Walters, Superintendent of Public Instruction of Oklahoma (2023–present)\nState Senators\n* Jerry Alvord, 14th district (2022–present)\n* Warren Hamilton, 7th district (2021–present)\n* Casey Murdock, 27th district (2018–present)\n* Rob Standridge, 15th district (2012–present)\n* Blake Stephens, 3rd district (2021–present)\n* Jack Stewart, 18th district (2022–present)\n* Tom Woods, 4th district (2022–present)\nState Representatives\n* Chris Banning, 24th district (2022–present)\n* Sherrie Conley, 20th district (2018–present)\n* Tom Gann, 8th district (2016–present)\n* Jim Grego, 17th district (2018–present)\n* David Hardin, 86th district (2018–present)\n* Brian Hill, 47th district (2019–present)\n* Justin Humphrey,  19th district (2017–present)\n* Cody Maynard, 21st district (2022–present)\n* Kevin McDugle, 12th district (2016–present)\n* David Smith, 18th district (2018–present)\n* Clay Staires, 66th district (2022–present)\n* Jay Steagall, 43rd district (2018–present)\n* Danny Williams, 28th district (2020–present)\n}}\nMaps\n.]]\nResults\nResults by congressional district\nTrump won all five congressional districts.
