      "text": "# Howard Morrison Quartet\n\nThe Howard Morrison Quartet (originally named the Ohinemutu Quartet) was a New Zealand band during the 1950s and early 1960s. The band was formed by Sir Howard Morrison and included Gerry Merito, Wi Wharekura and Noel Kingi.\nIn 1955, while working as a surveyor's chainman, Morrison started putting together vocal groups to entertain at rugby club socials in Rotorua. The next year, the original Quartet members and their extended whānau won the 1956 Rotorua Soundshell Talent Quest, following which Morrison toured Australia as a member of the Aotearoa Concert Party. This lead him to decide to pursue music as a career.\nOn his return, Morrison heard guitarist Gerry Merito and put together a group with Gerry and two others, Wi Wharekura and Noel Kingi, and named the group Howard Morrison Quartet. In 1958, they became part of Benny Levin's touring 'Pop Jamboree.' A recording they made of \"Hoki Mai/ Po Karekare Ana\" sold well, and in 1959 their parody of \"The Battle of New Orleans,\" recorded as \"The Battle of the Waikato\", became one of their biggest hits.\nIn 1960, they were so popular their managers released 13 singles, three EPs and two albums. Another parody of Lonnie Donegan's, \"My Old Man's A Dustman\" was rewritten by Gerry Merito as \"My Old Man's An All Black.\" This was topical because of the controversy over Maoris not being allowed to tour South Africa with that year's All Blacks.\nIn 1962, two of their singles were more parodies, with Ray Stevens' \"Ahab The Arab\" becoming \"Mori The Hori\" and Pat Boone's \"Speedy Gonzales\" becoming \"George The Wilder Colonial Boy\", celebrating the exploits of escaped convict George Wilder.\nDue to the constant touring and absence from families, the quartet disbanded in 1965, but occasionally re-united in various incarnations over subsequent years.\nIncarnations\n1956-1957 (The Ohinemutu \"Quartet\")\n*Sir Howard Morrison\n*John Morrison\n*Terry Morrison\n*Wi Wharekura\n*Chubby Hamiora\n*Gary Rangiihu\n1957-1958\n*Sir Howard Morrison\n*Gerry Merito\n*Laurie Morrison\n*John Morrison\n1958-1959\n*Sir Howard Morrison\n*Gerry Merito\n*Laurie Morrison\n*Tai Eru\n1959-1960\n*Sir Howard Morrison\n*Gerry Merito\n*Wi Wharekura\n*Eddie Howell\n1960-1965, 1975 '(Return of a Legend), 1989 (This Is Your Life: Sir Howard Morrison) (classic line-up)\n*Sir Howard Morrison\n*Gerry Merito\n*Wi Wharekura\n*Noel Kingi\n1979 (Tu Tangata '79)\n*Sir Howard Morrison\n*Gerry Merito\n*Toni Williams\n*Noel Kingi\n1992-199?\n*Sir Howard Morrison\n*Gerry Merito\n*Toni Williams\n*Hori Bennett\n1995 (Sir Howard Morrison: Time of My Life)\n*Sir Howard Morrison\n*Gerry Merito\n*Terry Morrison\n*Tai Eru\nNote: this incarnation played part of the Quartet segment of the show before Terry Morrison and Tai Eru gave way to Toni Williams and Hori Bennett, thus reverting to the previous incarnation.
