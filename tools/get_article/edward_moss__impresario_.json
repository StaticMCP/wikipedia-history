From its start and during the 20th century, Moss Empires remained the largest group of variety theatres in Britain, with over 50 venues at its height, and was regarded as the largest in the world. It was he who, in 1904, introduced a \"four shows a day\" system at some of his theatres; he was also the first to allow advance booking of seats in a music hall.\nCareer and management\nH. E. Moss, known as Ted to family and friends, was born in Droylsden, Lancashire, the son of James and Martha Moss. His father James Moss was a fiddler and character singer in singing saloons. He was educated in Edinburgh and Glasgow, where he received his own musical training. In 1872, he became the pianist and manager of his father's Lorne Music Hall in Greenock, Scotland, moving on in 1877 to Edinburgh where he tried a number of ventures including its Gaiety Music Hall and renaming it Moss's Theatre of Varieties. For 27 years, he presented the Annual Carnival at Waverley Market. He bought a new site and opened his first Empire Palace Theatre in 1892, designed by Frank Matcham who designed many of the group's theatres, as did Bertie Crewe. He was knighted in 1905 for his services to charity and entertainment, the first variety impresario to be honoured this way.\nKing George V commanded a public Royal Variety Performance to be directed by Sir Edward and held in the Edinburgh Empire in July 1911 as part of the Coronation celebrations that year. This would be the first such production in Britain, confirming the new respectability of Music Hall. However the theatre burned down a few months before the Performance, and Sir Edward's health deteriorated. Instead, a Royal Variety Performance was arranged for the following year, being held in the Palace Theatre, London, under Alfred Butt.\nEarly theatres\nIn 1905 the Moss combine had 37 variety theatres of which the flagship was London Hippodrome.\nThe company advertised its list as follows:-\nLondon Hippodrome,\nEmpire Glasgow,\nEmpire Edinburgh,\nEmpire Newcastle,\nEmpire Leeds,\nEmpire Bradford,\nEmpire Sheffield,\nEmpire Birmingham,\nEmpire Liverpool,\nEmpire Cardiff,\nEmpire Swansea,\nEmpire Newport,\nEmpire Nottingham,\nEmpire Ardwick, Manchester,\nEmpire South Shields,\nEmpire Hackney, London,\nEmpire Holloway, London,\nEmpire New Cross, London,\nEmpire Stratford, London,\nEmpire Shepherd's Bush, London,\nEmpire Dublin,\nEmpire Belfast,\nEmpire Coventry,\nEmpire Sunderland,\nPalace Hull,\nPalace Leicester,\nPalace Bordesley,\nPalace Camberwell,\nGranville Walham Green,\nManchester Hippodrome,\nGlasgow Coliseum,\nOlympia Liverpool,\nHM Theatre of Varieties Walsall,\nReading Theatre,\nRichmond Theatre,\nPhilharmonic Hall Cardiff,\nZoo and Hippodrome Glasgow.\nPersonal life\n.]]\nHe married twice: firstly, to Ellen Alice Bramwell (1856–1892), with whom he had two sons: James Edward Moss (1880–1904), and Charles Sommerville Moss (1883–1931). On Ellen's death he married Florence Craig née Crawford, daughter of Robert Crawford one of the founders of Howard & Wyndham Ltd. He and Florence had one daughter.\nHe died on 25 November 1912 at his mansion and estate of Middleton Hall, Gorebridge, near Edinburgh, and is buried in Portobello Cemetery in eastern Edinburgh, close to the cemetery entrance. Sir Edward was succeeded by Frank Allen as chairman and managing director of Moss Empires Ltd.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/MossEmpiresJubilee1949.htm Arthur Lloyd website and its full display of the Moss Empires Jubilee 1899–1949 publication]\n*  Twentieth-Century British Theatre: Industry, Art and Empire, by Claire Cochrane published by Cambridge University Press, 2011\n*"
