As they retreated, the glaciers left behind debris, called moraines, and valleys.  The retreating glaciers also formed numerous lakes.\nHistory\nIn 1854, Stephen Moon (1823-1909) came to Independence Township, Michigan from Palmyra, New York and was the first to settled in a valley on the northern side of Waterford Hill along the Saginaw Trail (now Dixie Highway).  His tract of land was in section 32 of the township.  There he established a 120-acre stock farm where he raised sheep, hogs, cows and fowl.\nMoon's son, Melvin C. Moon (1854-1933), eventually took over ownership of the farm and ran it until 1910. The valley became known as \"Moon Valley\" and the farm was subdivided and today consists of a residences on Maple Lane and a commercial district along Dixie Highway.\nGeography\nThe Clinton River winds its way around Moon Valley and through Greens Lake, a 117 acres, 55 foot depth lake which borders the western side of the valley.\nReferences"
