      "text": "# List of geology awards\n\n, Geological Society of London, 1876]]\nThis list of geology awards is an index to articles on notable awards for geology, an earth science concerned with the solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time. Geology can also include the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet or natural satellite such as Mars or the Moon.\nThe list is organized by region and country of the organization that sponsors the award, but awards are not always restricted to people from that country.\nSee list of earth sciences awards for awards for earth sciences in general, and for other branches of earth science.\nAmericas\nCanada\n{|Class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:6em;\"| Country !!
