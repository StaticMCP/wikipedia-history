It had its caput at the manor of Berry Pomeroy, 20 miles south of the City of Exeter and 2 miles east of the town of Totnes, where was situated Totnes Castle, the caput of the feudal barony of Totnes. The exact location of the 11th-century baron's residence is unclear; perhaps it was next to the parish church on the site of the former rectory known as Berry House, as it is now believed that the nearby ruined Berry Pomeroy Castle was not built until the 15th century.\nThe manor and barony was owned by the Pomeroy family from before 1086 until 1547, when it was purchased by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, in whose family it has since remained. Today the manor and much of the former estate belongs to his descendant the Duke of Somerset, seated at Maiden Bradley House in Wiltshire.\nDescent\nPomeroy\n;Ralph de la Pomeroy (died before 1100) (alias Pomeraie, Pomerei, etc.)\n:1st feudal baron of Berry, one of the Devon Domesday Book tenants-in-chief in 1086.

He donated 1/4 of a knight's fee in St Omer in Normandy to the \"Abbey of Val in St Omer\". He died without children at some time before 1114.\n;Joscelin (alias Gozeline) de la Pomeroy (died after 1123) (younger brother)\n:He refounded the \"Abbey of Val in St Omer\" in the diocese of Bayeux, Normandy, to which in 1125 he gave the churches of Berry (Pomeroy), \"Braordin\" and \"Clisson\" in Devon with others elsewhere, and also a small estate and tithe of a mill in La Pommeraye. He married a certain Emma, who consented to her husband's grants of 1125.\n;Henry de la Pomeroy (fl. 1156, died before 1165), Constable of Normandy.

He was a leader of the king's household troops on several occasions, notably in 1124 at the Battle of Bourgtheroulde, about ten miles southwest of Rouen. He married Rohese de Dunstanville.\nThe descent of the barony in the de la Pomeroy family is as follows:\n;Henry de la Pomeroy (died 1201/7) (eldest son)\n:He married Rohesia Bardolf, sister of Doun Bardolf (1177–1205) Rohesia survived her husband, and as the widow of a tenant-in-chief, Rohesia's second marriage became the property of the crown to dispose of, and in 1201/2 Sir John Russell (died c. 1224) of Kingston Russell in Dorset agreed to pay 50 marks to the royal treasury for the hand of his bride. After Russell's death in 1224 his widow Rohesia obtained royal licence of the king, at the suit of Ralph de Blundeville, Earl of Chester and Lincoln (1172–1232), to marry whomsoever she pleased, so long as he should be a faithful subject of the crown. This was perhaps merely a formality to give her freedom from \"troublesome solicitations of the king's courtiers\" and no records survive of any subsequent marriage having occurred.

Thomas and Joan had one daughter Isabel who died after her mother's 1423 death, and before that of her father, who had remarried to Joan Raleigh widow of Whalesborough, in 1426.
