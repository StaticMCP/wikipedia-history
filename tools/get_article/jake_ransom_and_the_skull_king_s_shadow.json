Dollops of real science are nicely integrated, but the characterizations harbor no surprises.\"\nPublishers Weekly also highlighted the inclusion of non-fiction material, noting that novel \"presents a wide range of interesting historical information while telling a rollicking good story\". They also referred to the novel an \"exciting time-travel adventure\" and Jake \"an Indiana Jones in the making\".\nBooklist's Ilene Cooper compared the plot, as well as the main character Jake, to Harry Potter, but noted that \"stylistically, [...] Rollins is no Rowling, though his short paragraphs and staccato sentences make this a fine read for the reluctant or those who put a premium on action.\" Cooper added, \"Oddly, things get a bit more ho-hum as they become more fantastical.\"\nReferences"
