Originally dating from circa 1865, it was acquired by the French family in 1892 and renovated by them in the Italianate style in circa 1900. Edward French, along with his uncle Daniel and other members of the French family, were prominent bankers and businessmen from early The Dalles until the 1920s.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Wasco County, Oregon\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
