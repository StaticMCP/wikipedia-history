It was filmed in 2002 and released on 14 September 2006.\nBackground\nKærn sees airspace as an expression of individual freedom, void of political borders.\nIn 1999, Kærn made a film about Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) called Sisters in the sky.\nInspired by the WASPs, Kærn obtained a flying license.\nFlying to Kabul\nAfter the September 11 attacks, airspace became restricted, and allied forces deposed the Taliban regime.\nIn January 2002, Kærn sat in a café in Copenhagen and read a newspaper article about Farial, (16-year-old girl in Kabul) wanting to fly airplanes. Kærn decided to fly with partner Magnus Bejmar 6,000&nbsp;km to Kabul and give the girl the experience of flight, and also reclaim the freedom of the skies.\nWith money from WASP paintings in Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, she bought a Piper Colt from 1961, a small airplane.\nDuring a 3-month trip through flight-restricted Balkan, they met with female fighter pilots in Turkey and talked about the world's first female fighter pilot Sabiha Gökçen, and made an aerial heart of smoke with the Turkish Air Force.\nOn day 77, they flew from Mashhad, Iran crossing the border, to Herat without authorization from NATO.\nIn Kabul, they met with Farial who got to fly the plane. They also met with two colonel sister pilots flying Mil Mi-17 helicopters.\nIn the end, cultural differences prevented Farial going further.\nThe film won the \"Full Frame Women in Leadership Award\" in 2006.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008063426/http://www.skysisters.com/FREEDOMFIGHTERS.html Sky Sisters]"
