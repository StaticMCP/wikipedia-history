      "text": "# Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire__disambig_1\n\n'Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire' is a book by American author David Remnick. Often cited as an example of New Journalism, it won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1994.\nThe book is equal parts history and eyewitness account, covering the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Opening with the excavation of the corpses of Poles killed in the Katyn massacre, ''Lenin's Tomb'' begins by describing the structural flaws present from the country's early days, and then uses individual accounts from a wide variety of contemporary individuals to display the modern consequences of these historical errors and cruelties.\nWithin the book, Remnick draws heavily on his past work as Moscow correspondent with The Washington Post.  In addition to officials and public figures, current and former—one chapter in part recounts Remnick's attempts to interview Lazar Kaganovich, of Joseph Stalin's inner circle—he takes advantage of a wide variety of \"everyman\"-type sources.  These individuals, while not themselves notable, help add richness and texture to Remnick's depiction of the world around them.\nIn 1997, Remnick published a follow-up work, Resurrection, dealing with the creation of a new Russian state.\nThe book was the required reading for the University Interscholastic League's Social Studies Competition in 2018. Jay Nordlinger gave a favorable assessment of the book.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.org/details/leninstomblastda0000remn Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire] at Archive.org\n*[https://www.c-span.org/video/?46467-1/lenins-tomb-last-days-soviet-empire Booknotes interview with Remnick on ''Lenin's Tomb'', July 25, 1993]"
