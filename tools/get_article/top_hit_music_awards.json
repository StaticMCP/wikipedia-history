Artists, authors and producers from Russia, Ukraine, other countries of Eastern Europe and countries around the world are awarded for outstanding achievements in popular music and the recording business based on data from the rotation of songs on radio stations and views of video clips on the Internet. Performers are also awarded for the best concert shows. Ceremonies are held annually in Moscow.\nTop Hit Music Awards rewards not only popular performers from Russia and Ukraine, but also from other countries of Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, Central Asia and other countries of the world; over the years, the leaders of the hit parade were Alla Pugacheva, Valery Leontyev, Jason Derulo, Billie Eilish, David Guetta, Pink, Coldplay, Imagine Dragons, Imany, BTS, Svetlana Loboda, Bi-2, Zemfira, A'Studio, Dan Balan, Serebro, Little Big, Max Barskikh, Zivert, Niletto and others.\nThere is a Top Hit Hall of Fame as a part of the award. Every year 10 nominees are announced by partnering radio stations, determined by voting. Then past Hall of Fame members elect 2 of them.\nEvaluations\nYolka singer, one of the most popular Russian singers, honors Top Hit Music Awards as a tool for determining artists by their real statistical popularity, not by decisions of some jury. This also emphasizes professional nature of the award. Yolka was awarded multiple times, including \"Artist of the decade award\", as Top Hit measurements show that she is extremely popular among Russian-speaking listeners with over 19 million of airplays in 10 years.\nTimeOut showbiz magazine coined the ceremony a metaphor of \"Unbiased Prize of Numbers which is based exceptionally on statistics and is not subject to objections\" .\nNomination
