She served as Minister of Foreign Trade and Information Technology in the second cabinet of Jüri Ratas from 16 May 2019 to 25 October 2019. She resigned after lying over the appointment of an advisor. Kaimar Karu was appointed as her successor. She is affiliated with the Conservative People's Party of Estonia.\nFraud\nEstonian Supreme Court ruled on 31. March 2025 not to hear the appeal of Kert Kingo (EKRE), which means Kingo must step down from the Riigikogu and also the previous ruling by the circuit court remains in force, sentencing Kingo to a suspended prison term of one year and nine months. An earlier ruling by Harju County Court found that Kert Kingo and attorney Martin Traat guilty of fraud.\nThe Office of the Prosecutor General launched a criminal investigation into Kert Kingo after outlet Õhtuleht discovered in 2021 that Kingo had submitted invoices from a law firm for reimbursement as parliamentary expenses, which were suspected to be falsified. Prosecutors alleged that Kingo used falsified invoices to have the Riigikogu reimburse legal expenses incurred by individuals unconnected to her parliamentary work. Attorney-at-law Martin Traat was charged with falsifying the invoices, having had his law office staff draft documents containing false information based on Kingo's instructions.\nReferences\n|list2 =\n}}"
