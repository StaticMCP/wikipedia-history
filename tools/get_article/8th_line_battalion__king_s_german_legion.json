It served from 1805 until 1816 in Ireland, Walcheren, Copenhagen, Sicily, Peninsula and Belgium. It took part in the Northern Italian campaign, resulting in the capture of Genoa in April 1814.\nOn 18 June 1815, during the Battle of Waterloo, the battalion was nearly wiped out during the fighting in the centre of Wellington's battle line and lost a flag.\nUniforms and equipment\nUniform and Equipment of the Legion's Line battalions was of standard British pattern of the time.
