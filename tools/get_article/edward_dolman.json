As a secondary-school pupil he played rugby, and soon led his school's team as captain. He continued his rugby career in university and well into his early adult years, when he captained the Old Alleynian Football Club from 1982 to 1985.\nEducation\nDolman was educated at Dulwich College and the University of Southampton.\nCareer\nFrom 2014 to 2025, Dolman served as Executive Chairman and chief executive officer of Phillips.\nFrom 2011 to 2014, he was Director of the office of Her Excellency Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Chairperson of the Qatar Museums Authority.

He also led the cultural exchange partnership, the \"Year of Culture,\" where he oversaw the Qatar and United Kingdom exchange with Charles, Prince of Wales as the ambassador.\nPreceding his time in the Middle East, Dolman had a 27-year career at Christie's, where he rose to chairman of the Board of Christie's International. In 1999, at the age of 39, he was appointed chief executive officer, a position he held for 11 years. Dolman joined Christie's in 1984 as a porter, quickly rising to specialist in English Furniture. Later roles included managing director of Christie's Amsterdam, Commercial Director of Christie's Europe and managing director, Christie's Americas. Following Dolman's late-1999 appointment as CEO, he led the company through the settlement and aftermath of a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation.
