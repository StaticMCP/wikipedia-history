In addition to the statements made by the Marjas\nGrand Ayatullah Husayn Hossein Ali Montazeri\n(Translated, from his [http://www.amontazeri.com/farsi/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=198&FORUM_ID=2&CAT_ID=2&Forum_Title=%26%231582%3B%26%231576%3B%26%231585%3B%26%231606%3B%26%231575%3B%26%231605%3B%26%231607%3B&Topic_Title=%26%231662%3B%26%231740%3B%26%231575%3B%26%231605%3B+%26%231662%3B%26%231740%3B%26%231585%3B%26%231575%3B%26%231605%3B%26%231608%3B%26%231606%3B+%26%231581%3B%26%231608%3B%26%231575%3B%26%231583%3B%26%231579%3B+%26%231575%3B%26%231582%3B%26%231740%3B%26%231585%3B+%26%231575%3B%26%231606%3B%26%231578%3B%26%231582%3B%26%231575%3B%26%231576%3B%26%231575%3B%26%231578%3B official website])\nIn the name of God\nPeople of Iran\nThese last days, we have witnessed the lively efforts of you brothers and sisters, old and young alike, from any social category, for the 10th presidential elections.\n''Our youth, hoping to see their rightful will fulfilled, came on the scene and waited patiently. This was the greatest occasion for the government's officials to bond with their people.\nBut unfortunately, they used it in the worst way possible. Declaring results that no one in their right mind can believe, and despite all the evidence of crafted results, and to counter people protestations, in front of the eyes of the same nation who carried the weight of a revolution and 8 years of war, in front of the eyes of local and foreign reporters, attacked the children of the people with astonishing violence. And now they are attempting a purge, arresting intellectuals, political opponents and Scientifics.\nNow, based on my religious duties, I will remind you:\n1- A legitimate state must respect all points of view. It may not oppress all critical views. I fear that this leads to the loss of people's faith in Islam.\n2- Given the current circumstances, I expect the government to take all measures to restore people's confidence. Otherwise, as I have already said, a government not respecting people's vote has no religious or political legitimacy.\n3- I invite everyone, specially the youth, to continue reclaiming their dues in calm, and not let those who want to associate this movement with chaos succeed.\n4- I ask the police and army personals not to \"sell their religion\", and beware that receiving orders will not excuse them before god. Recognize the protesting youth as your children. Today censor and cutting telecommunication lines can not hide the truth.\nI pray for the greatness of the Iranian people.''\nStatements from other Ayatollahs\nWhile not Marjas themselves, several influential Ayatollahs have made statements regarding the 2009 Iranian elections.\nGrand Ayatollah Yousef Sanei and Grand Ayatollah Asadollah Bayat Zanjani wrote letters to the Iranian news web site [http://www.iran-emrooz.net Emrooz] in support of the protestors, with Ayatollah Zanjani referring to the election as a \"gross injustice,\"\nReferences"
