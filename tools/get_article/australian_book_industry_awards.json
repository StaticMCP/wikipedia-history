Award recipients are first selected by an academy of more than 200 industry professionals, and then a shortlist and winners are chosen by judging panels.\nIn 2025, ABIA is presenting 14 book awards, eight business awards, and the Lloyd O’Neil and Pixie O’Harris awards.\nHistory\nThe Australian Book Publishers Association (ABPA) first presented the Lloyd O'Neil Award for \"exceptional long service to the industry\", at the annual awards night in 1992, in honour of publisher Lloyd O'Neil, after his death in February 1992. The first Pixie O'Harris Award was presented in 1994, in hour of book illustrator Pixie O'Harris, which recognises \"publishers, editors, creators, booksellers, publicists and other industry representatives who have worked consistently in the field of children’s literature, demonstrated commitment beyond the call of duty, and who have developed a reputation for their contribution\".\nThe ABPA was renamed to the Australian Publishers Association (APA) in 1996. In 1999 and 2000, the APA and Australian Booksellers Association (ABA) held a joint industry awards night at the ABA conference and APA trade fair in Sydney.\nIn 2001, the APA Book Industry Awards became known as the APA Australian Book Industry Awards (ABIA). In the following year, eight awards were presented at the awards night, which were Publisher of the Year Award, Booksellers Career Development Award, Good Reading Award, Publishing Project of the Year, Marketing Campaign of the Year, and Distributor of the Year, and the Lloyd O’Neil and Pixie O’Harris Award.\nIn 2006, the awards were rebranded with the ABIA acronym, the number of awards was increased to 18 and the operation of the awards was placed in the hands of an academy of publishers and booksellers called the Australian Book Industry Academy.\nIn 2025, book industry news outlet Books+Publishing took over production of ABIA from the APA under a licensing agreement.\n2018 winners\nThe 2018 ABIA winners were announced on 3 May, with Jessica Townsend's Nevermoor receiving three awards:\n* ABIA Book of the Year: Nevermoor, Jessica Townsend\n* Biography of the Year Award: Working Class Man, Jimmy Barnes\n* General Fiction Book of the Year: The Secrets She Keeps, Michael Robotham\n* General Non-fiction Book of the Year: The Trauma Cleaner, Sarah Krasnostein\n* Literary Fiction Book of the Year: See What I Have Done, Sarah Schmidt\n* Illustrated Book of the Year: ''Maggie's Recipe for Life, Maggie Beer and Ralph Martins\n* International Book of the Year: Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo\n* Small Publisher adults Book of the Year: The Australian Bird Guide, Peter Menkhorst, Danny Rogers, Rohan Clarke et al\n* Small Publisher children’s Book of the Year: It's OK to Feel the Way You Do, Josh Langley\n* The Matt Richell Award for new writer of the Year: Nevermoor, Jessica Townsend\n* Book of the Year for older children (ages 13+): Begin, End, Begin: A #LoveOzYA Anthology, edited by Danielle Binks\n* Book of the Year for younger children (ages seven to 12): Nevermoor,'' Jessica Townsend\n* Children's picture Book of the Year (ages up to six): No One Likes a Fart, Zoë Foster Blake\n* Audiobook of the Year: The 91-Storey Treehouse, Andy Griffiths and Terry Denton, narrated by Stig Wemyss\n* The Lloyd O'Neill hall of fame Award for services to the Australian book industry: Suzy Wilson\n* The Pixie O'Harris Award for outstanding commitment to children's literature: Jane Covernton\n* Publisher of the Year: HarperCollins\n* Small Publisher of the Year: Thames & Hudson Australia\n* National book retailer of the Year: Dymocks\n* Independent book retailer of the Year: Readings\n* Rising star Award: Shalini Kunahlan, marketing manager at Text Publishing\n2019 winners\nTrent Dalton's Boy Swallows Universe picked up four awards in the 2019 ABIA awards.
