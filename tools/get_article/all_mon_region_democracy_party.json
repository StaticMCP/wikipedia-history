In the 2010 Myanmar general election, which was boycotted by both the main opposition National League for Democracy and the other main Mon party, the Mon National Party, the AMRDP won 16 total seats, 3 in the Pyithu Hluttaw (the lower house), 4 in the Amyotha Hluttaw and 9 in regional hluttaws.\nIn 2013, there were reports that the party agreed to merge with the MNP. However, a party called the AMRDP contested the 2015 general election, where it won no seats in the national parliament and just one seat in the Mon State Hluttaw.\nThe party's former chairperson Nai Ngwe Thein died on 2 October 2018.\nReferences"
