It was founded in 1999, three years after the long-standing Ontario Open was last played, and ran for four years, through 2002. It was hosted at a different venue every year.\nIn the inaugural tournament, Arron Oberholser set a new Canadian Tour record for the largest winning margin when he finished 11 strokes ahead of Ian Leggatt and Tony Carolan.\nWinners\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Year!!Venue!!Winner!!Score!!Ref\n|-\n| 2002 || Grandview ||  Mike Grob || 274 (−14) ||\n|-\n| 2001 || Fort William ||  Craig Matthew || 272 (−16) ||\n|-\n| 2000 || Osprey Links ||  Zhang Lianwei || 204 (−9) ||\n|-\n| 1999 || Sault Ste.
