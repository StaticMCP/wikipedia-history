It is a forward chaining semantic reasoner that can be used for querying, checking, transforming and filtering information.  Its core language is RDF, extended to include rules, it can use RDF/XML or RDF/N3 (see [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer Notation3 Primer]) serializations.\ncwm can perform the following tasks:\n* Parse and pretty-print the following RDF formats: XML RDF, Notation3, and N-Triples.\n* Store triples in a queryable triplestore (a triples' database).\n* Perform inferences as a forward chaining FOPL inference engine.\n* Perform builtin functions such as comparing strings, retrieving resources, all using an extensible builtins suite.\ncwm was written in Python from 2000–10 onwards by Tim Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly of the W3C.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm cwm homepage]\n* [http://infomesh.net/2001/cwm/ Information about CWM - TimBL's Closed World Machine]"
