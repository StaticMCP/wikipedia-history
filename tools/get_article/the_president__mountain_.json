In 1907, the mountain was renamed by the Alpine Club of Canada, after it was discovered that the name had already been used on a mountain in the Selkirks.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, The President is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 C with wind chill factors below −30 C.\nSee also\n* List of mountains in the Canadian Rockies\nGallery\nPresident and Vice.jpg|Left to right, The Vice President, President Glacier and The President\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bivouac.com/MtnPg.asp?MtnId=1658 The President at bivouac.com]"
