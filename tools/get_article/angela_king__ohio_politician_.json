King and her husband, Mark, have two children and four grandchildren and are involved in their local church.\nIn July 2023, King was one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ban drag performances from any venue where minors could be present.\nIn April 2024, Ohio Representatives Angie King and Rodney Creech introduced legislation that would allow individuals from any political party to file a protest against a candidate in a primary election. This move came in response to a failed attempt by the Mercer County Republican Party Chair to disqualify Representative King's transgender opponent.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.kingforohio.com/ Campaign website]"
