But other sources state that the highest peak is Vestec, at a height of 668 metres.\nEtymology\nThe mountain's name originates from the past metal abundance of the region, as it was the site of many mines of iron.\nGeography\nThe mountain range can be characterised geographically, as an upland with a triangular shape, with a plateau from the southeast through to the northwest of the mountains.\nDivisions\n*Chvaletická Plateau\n*Sečská Upland\nHighest mountain peaks\n*Pešava 697 metres\n*Vestec 668 metres\n*Spálava 663 metres\n*U Chloumku 661 metres\n*Srní 653 metres\n*Zuberský vrch 650 metres\n*Polom 649 metres\nWaters\nThe Iron Mountains are located in the basin of the river Elbe.
