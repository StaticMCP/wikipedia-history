It must administer Queensland's electoral laws, conduct democratic parliamentary and industrial elections which are free and review local government boundaries. It is also responsible for referendums, electoral redistributions, education and research into matters related to Queensland elections, providing information to all levels of government, ensuring the electoral roll is maintained and the registering of political parties.\nElectronic voting\nIn 2010, the Commission announced it was conducting research into assisting the deaf and blind to cast a secret vote electronically. However, due to legislative restrictions, electronic voting was not available for the 2012 state election.\nSee also\n*Australian Electoral Commission\n*Court of Disputed Returns\n*Electoral districts of Queensland\n*Politics of Queensland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
