The song was covered by American singer Emmylou Harris in 1995.\nComposition\nThe song was written by Neil Young. Rather than referring to a real demolition wrecking ball, the lyrics are wordplay and the song refers to a dance or ball. Aside from the 1989 album version \"Wrecking Ball\" exists also in a different version with a separate set of lyrics.\nYoung sang harmony on the Emmylou Harris version, which became the title track of the Grammy Award-winning album Wrecking Ball. Although the song was released by Harris as a 2-track CD single with Lucinda Williams' \"Sweet Old World\", one reviewer did not consider the title track the high point on the album.\nPersonnel\n*Neil Young – piano, vocals\n*Chad Cromwell – drums\n*Rick Rosas – bass\nReferences"
