It was first published in October 2018.\nSet in the early 10th-century, this novel continues to follow the story of the fictional Uhtred of Bebbanburg and his hand in the creation of England as a unified country. Lured from his ancestral home by an unseen enemy, Uhtred must now fight to preserve the last kingdom of Northumbria from its foes.\nPlot\nÆthelflæd, Uhtred's former lover and Lady of Mercia, dies in the year 918 AD. Edward, King of Wessex, occupies Gleawecestre, an action signalling that Mercia is no longer an independent country. In 919 AD, Uhtred is summoned by Edward to swear fealty, but he ignores the summons, and as such his lands in Mercia are forfeited the following year to Bishop Wulfheard of Hereford. Uhtred exclaims he is content with Bebbanburg, and has no need of Mercian land.\nFollowing King Edward's annexation of Mercia, wide-spread unrest leads to rebellion in 921 AD under Cynlæf Haraldson, the would-be husband to Lady Æthelflæd's daughter Ælfwynn whom Edward locked in a West Saxon convent. Cynlæf, with the hope that Mercian Ealdormen would follow, besieges Prince Æthelstan in Ceaster. A monk called Osric comes to Bebbanburg to warn Uhtred of Æthelstan's danger, and despite King Sigtryggr's warnings, he leads ninety men to Mameceaster, and then on to relieve the siege of Ceaster.\nUpon arriving at Ceaster, Uhtred leads his men in a cavalry charge through the Mercian rebels' camp and quickly routes most of the army. A small group, led by Cynlæf himself, takes shelter in the Roman arena outside the city. Uhtred reconnects with Sister Sunngifu (a former whore called Mus), and Æthelstan who asks for Uhtred's oath, which Uhtred refuses. Æthelstan also informs Uhtred that he never sent for help, and they were at no risk of starving, leaving Uhtred to suspect that Brother Osric's goal was to lead him away from Bebbanburg.\nIn the siege camp, a priest named Father Bledod approaches Uhtred and Æthelstan representing Gruffudd, an uncle to King Arthfael of the Kingdom of Gwent who was hired as a mercenary. Gruffudd barters for his son, Cadwallon ap Gruffudd who is a hostage of Cynlæf's, and Æthelstan agrees to let the Welsh leave under the condition they share who paid them. Following a short skirmish in the arena during which the remaining Mercian rebels are captured and their leaders killed, Cadwallon is returned to his father, who informs Æthelstan he was hired by a West Saxon priest named Stigand. Uhtred reckons that Æthelhelm the Younger, an enemy to both Æthelstan and Uhtred, was truly responsible. Æthelhelm wanted his nephew, Edward's second son Ælfweard, to inherit his father's throne, and he had further cause to hate Uhtred because his father, Æthelhelm the Elder, died a hostage in Bebbanburg, and his sister Ælswyth married Uhtred the Younger.\nThe day after the battle, Æthelstan asks Uhtred to come with him to Brunanburh to meet Ingilmundr, a Norse Chieften who has settled in Wirhealum after his father was killed in Ireland. Ingilmundr tells Uhtred about Anluf, a Hiberno-Norse Chieftainn in Dyflin, and that he suspects his father was betrayed by his uncle, Sköll Grimmarson, who fled Ireland and is now in Northumbria with ambition to become King of Jorvik, and lastly that he believes it was Sköll who tasked Beadwulf (Brother Osric's real name) with luring Uhtred away from Bebbanburg. Uhred reflects that he likes Ingilmundr, but he also fears him. He leaves a few days later, escorting nuns (including Sunngifu) halfway to Mameceaster.\nNear Ribelcastre, Uhtred searches for brother Beadwulf, and finds him and his young wife Wynflæd at the estate of Jarl Arnborg. There, Uhtred learns that it was Arnborg who lured him away, and that Sköll and his sorcerer Snorri have already marched on Jorvik. He also finds a jar of Henbane, and learns that many of Sköll's followers are the feared Ulfheðinn . They ride towards Jorvik, accompanied by Beadwulf and his wife, but quickly discover a defeated Sköll returning West with plunder and captives. Uhtred, claiming to be Arnborg's uncle Folkmar, leads nine men into the valley where a small skirmish takes place. Some men are killed, and Sköll's son Unker is permanently disabled from a head wound by Uhtred who captures two Norsemen: Enar Erikson and Njall. From the two captives, Uhtred learns that Sköll failed to capture Jorvik, but he and his son Unker managed to kill Stiorra, Uhtred's daughter. In a fit of rage, Uhtred kills both captives, and thinks he is cursed by the Gods.\nSköll leads at least one hundred men in pursuit of Uhtred, though eventually they fall behind. Uhtred and his men stay at the hall of a man named Hergild who is off raiding in Northern Mercia, and are fed by Hergild's wife Wiburgh until his scouts return and report that Sköll has found them once more. Uhtred leads his men south, and finds Osferth, his former oath-man who now commands the garrison at Mameceaster. Osferth was in the area hunting Hergild's warband, and was informed of Uhtred's plight by Beadwulf who had seemingly fled the night before. Osferth and Uhtred parlay with Sköll, but Osferth refuses to fight in Northumbria, and so Uhtred accompanies him back to Mameceaster.\nAt Mameceaster, Uhtred exclaims his wish to return to Eoferwic at once to find Sigtryggr, but Osferth tells him that Sigtryggr and Bishop Hrotheweard have accepted summons to the Witan at Tamweorthin. Uhtred decides to attend the Witan, but before he leaves, he speaks to Wynflæd and punishes her rapists on behalf of Mus. Among Hergild's men was his son, Immar, who Wynflæd says is innocent, and he joins Uhtred's men under the allowance of Father Oda. Upon arriving in Tamweorthin, Uhtred reunites with Sigtryggr, and is later fetched to the feast of Ēostre by Father Lucas at the behest of King Edward. However, when Uhtred reaches the feast, he finds King Edward drunk and unconscious, and instead it is Queen Eadgifu who called him. Eadgifu puts on an amorous display intending to convince men in the hall that Uhtred will support her son Edmund as King of Wessex, prompting Æthelhelm the Younger to leave.\nWhen Uhtred leaves the palace, he is attacked by seven of Æthelhelm's men outside of Saint Ælfthryth's Church, but Sigtryggr's men quickly defeat them, and Uhtred learns they were given orders by a man named Grimbald. On the following morning, Sigtryggr is called before the Witan and made to accept a heavily unfavorable treaty, only after demanding the execution of Grimbald for the violation of the promised safe conduct offered by the Saxons. The treaty is finalized with Sygtryggr's baptism and marriage to Eadgyth, Prince Æthelstan's twin sister (possibly Edith of Polesworth, but not Edward the Elder's daughter Eadgyth, Queen of the East Franks). Before leaving Tamweorthin, Uhtred swears an oath to Æthelstan promising to kill Æthelhelm the Younger when Edward dies. Æthelstan swears not to invade Northumbria while Uhtred lives.\nUhtred returns to Bebbanburg, and sends bands of men West to find Sköll's fortress in Cumbraland, including Uhtred the Younger who leads forty-three men along Hadrian's Wall. When young Uhtred returns a few weeks later, he recounts how he was ambushed and lost sixteen men. Sköll comes to parlay with Uhtred, returning four of those lost men, and his sorcerer Snorri prophecies that \"two Kings will die at the Fortress of the Eagles, one crowned and one uncrowned.\" Sköll calls Uhtred the uncrowned King, and warns him to stay in Bebbanburg before returning West.\nAfter a visit from Father Swithred, Prince Æthelstan's trusted advisor, and the assistance of the mad Bishop Ieremias, to whom Uhtred gifted the land of Lindesfarena, Uhtred discovers the location of Heahburh, Sköll's fortress. Uhtred discards David's Pebble, a gift from Ieremias, and decides that the Gods were tempting him with Christianity and that he must win at Heahburh to release his curse. Together with Jarl Sihtric Kjartansson's sixty-two men and Sigtryggr's two-hundred and forty-seven, Uhtred leads one-hundred and eighty-four men to Heagostealdes, and from there, they march into Cumbraland to find Heahburh.\nUpon finding the Roman fort, Uhtred and Sigtryggr decide to attack from the Western side to lure men away from the Northern corner of the fort, which Ieremias considered the weakest part. They lead several unsuccessful attacks on the walls, but fail to capture the walls. Both Uhted and Sigtryggr are wounded, and lose many men including Berg Skallagrímmrson, Uhtred's sworn man who is presumed dead. After another failed assault, the sorcerer Snorri comes out from the Northern gate of Heahburh, and calls curses down upon the assailants. In response, Bishop Ieremias, having used the concoction of Henbane, shouts his own curses at Snorri, and hits him with a ram skull he proudly called the Ram of Abraham. Snorri falls to the ground, and his guide dog runs to Ieremias. Sköll's Ulfheðnar consider this a grave insult, and around a hundred men abandon the walls to fight against Uhtred's shield wall. When the tide seems to turn against the wolf-warriors, they turn to retreat, but find the gate closed to them. Uhtred the Younger, desperate to redeem himself from his prior loss against Sköll, leads his own band to cut down the fleeing men.\nAt that moment, the Western gate is opened, and the banner of Egil Skallagrímrsson is planted atop the gate. Unbeknownst to Uhtred, Berg was captured by his brothers Egil and Thorolf whereupon Berg convinced them they were fighting for the wrong side. Uhtred and Sigtryggr's men charge through the gate of Heahburh, and kill many of Sköll's men before the majority surrender. Sköll kills Snorri for failing him, and offers to surrender his sword, Grayfang, to Sigtryggr. This proves to be a trick, and he attempts to kill Sigtryggr, but Uhtred intervenes, and defeats Sköll. He takes Grayfang from Sköll before offering Sigtryggr the kill. As Sköll begs for his sword back, Sigtryggr kills him and avenges Stiorra. Following Sköll's death, most of his warriors swear fealty to Sigtryggr including Egil and Thorolf, to whom Uhtred gives land North of Bebbanburg.\nReferences"
