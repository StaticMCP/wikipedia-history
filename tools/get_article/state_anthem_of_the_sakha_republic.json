It is one of the official symbols of the Sakha Republic, along with the flag and the coat of arms of the Sakha Republic. It was originally written in the Yakut language by Savva Tarasov and Mikhail Timofeyev. The anthem was translated into Russian by Vladimir Fedorov. The music was composed by Kirill Gerasimov. It was officially adopted on 15 July 2004. The anthem's music is played in F major.\nBackground\nCreation\nAfter the Sakha Republic became a separate constituent state of Russia, its constitution was adopted. At that time, no regional anthem of the Sakha Republic existed. The constitution only stipulates that:\n}}\nAfter the approval of the new constitution, a commission for the creation of the national anthem was formed, with the poet Savva Tarasov as the chairman. A competition for the national anthem was announced. Hundreds of submission for the national anthem was received from throughout the country, but the commission did not approve any of the submission. This caused Savva Tarasov to be replaced from her position in September 1992 by the Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Republic of Sakha, K. Koryakin.\nAfter this failure, the president of the Sakha Republic, Mikhail Nikolayev, entrusted the Ministry of Culture of the Sakha Republic, to continue the search for the anthem. In September 1995, at a meeting of the State Assembly of the Sakha Republic, a proposed anthem was presented. The lyrics of the proposed anthem was written by Dmitry Sivtsev. The music of the anthem was based on the final chorus from the opera Nyurgun Bootur, which was composed by Mark Zhirkov and Heinrich Litinsky, and was re-arranged by Y. Sheykina.\nIn 2000, a new commission was formed under the leadership of the People's Deputy G. G. Mestnikov. The commission presented a new version of the anthem, titled \"\" (; \"Song of the Footman\"). The lyrics was written by Savva Tarasov and Mikhail Tarasov, and the music was composed by Kirill Gerasimov.\nApproval\nOn 26 March 2003, the President of the Sakha Republic, Vyacheslav Shtyrov, issued a decree to form a new commission to prepare the issue of the anthem, under the leadership of E.S. Nikitina. The commission chooses the work \"\" and recommended the work to be submitted to the State Assembly of the Sakha Republic. On 15 July 2004, the national anthem was approved by the State Assembly.\nOn 27 April 2004 the first official performance of the anthem took place on the Day of the Republic.\nPrevious anthems\n\"Sargılardâx saxalarbıt\"\nThe song \"\" (; ; \"Sakha, Covered in Happiness\") was adopted as the anthem of the Tungus Republic. The anthem itself was composed by Adam Skryabin, and the lyrics of the song was based on the poem \"\" () by Alampa. The poem itself was written in 1917.\nThe Internationale\nThe \"Internationale\" (, Novgorodov alphabet: Internessijene:l), was the national anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the state anthem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1922 to 1944.\nThe Yakut translation of the anthem was planned to be written by Semyon Novgorodov. Unfortunately, due to his nescience of the lyrics of the anthem, he handed over the task to Platon Oyunsky. It was finished on 7 December 1921. The translation was first published in the \"Lena Commune\" newspaper on 15 December 1921.\nState Anthem of the Soviet Union\nThe \"State Anthem of the Soviet Union\" (; ), was the official national anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the state anthem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1944 to 1991, replacing \"The Internationale\".\nUsage of the anthem in Yakut ASSR\nAfter the creation of this anthem, the anthem itself was popularized all over the Soviet Union. In the Yakut ASSR, the Yakut Regional Committee of the CPSU ordered all district and city committees to organize the popularization of the anthem with the help of newspapers, radio, and the creation of study groups for the lyrics of the song, including in the Yakut language.\nThe Council of People's Commissars of the Yakut ASSR also ordered the Radio Committee to record the Yakut version of the anthem and systematically broadcast it. A total of 15,000 copies of the lyrics were published and sent out on colorful flyers.\nYakut translation of the anthem\nThe official translation of the anthem in Yakut was approved through a special commission. The commission consisted of the head of the APO of the Yakut regional committee Zakharov, People's Commissar of Education Chemezov, historian G.P. Basharin and composer Mark Zhirkov.\nThe commission received nine submission of translations from all over the Yakut ASSR. Of all the lyrics submitted, only the lyrics by Nikolai Egorovich Mordinov and poet Sergey Stepanovich Vasilyev was selected. Both were instructed to combine both translation and polish them on January 12, 1944. The final translation was approved by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 26 June 1944.\n\"Saxa ırıata\"\nThe song \"\" (; \"Sakha Song\") was originally a poem written by Alampa in 1919. The poem was musicalized by Adam Skryabin.\nThe song became a symbol of resistance against Soviet rule in the Yakut region from 1921 until 1923, so much that the writer of the poem, Alampa, was labelled as a \"nationalist-bourgeoisie\". Alampa was sent to the Solovki prison camp after his arrest. The composer of the song, Adam Skryabin, went abroad to evade the persecution and was given trial in absentia.\nAfter a long time, the song was allowed by the Soviet government to be performed publicly. The first public performance of this song was in the Victory Day celebration in the Yakut ASSR in 1945, from a gramophone record. The song was proposed to become the anthem of the Sakha Republic in 1990.\nLyrics\nLyrics are official in both Yakut and Russian languages, along with a singable English translation.\nYakut version\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap;\"\n|-\n!Cyrillic script!!Latin script!!IPA transcription\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|\nII\nҮллэр үөстээх Өлүөнэ Эбэ\nӨлбөт-мэҥэ угуттуур уулаах.\nЭлбэх омукка эрчим эбэр,\nИли-эйэни олохтуур уохтаах.\n}}\nIII\nАаспыт кэммит айхаллаах суола\nАрчылыыр аар алгыһын биэрдэ,\nСахабыт сирэ дьоһун дуолан\nСайдыы аартыгар түөрэҕэ түстэ.\n}}}}\n|\nII\nÜller üösteex Ölüöne Ebe\nÖlböt-meñe uguttuur uulaax.\nElbex omukka erçim eber,\nİli-eyeni oloxtuur uoxtaax.\n}}\nIII\nAaspıt kemmit ayxallaax suola\nArçılıır aar algıhın bierde,\nSaxabıt sire cohun duolan\nSaydıı aartıgar tüöreğe tüste.\n}}}}\n|\n2\n[ʏl.lɛr y̑øs.tɛːx œ.ly̑ø.nɛ ɛ.bɛ]\n[œl.bœt mɛ.ŋɛ ʊ.gʊt.tuːr uː.ɫɑːχ]\n[ɛl.bɛx ɔ.mʊq.qɑ ɛr.t͡ʃɪm ɛ.bɛr]\n[ɪ.lɪ ɛ.jɛ.nɪ ɔ.ɫɔχ.tuːr u̯oχ.tɑːχ ‖]\n}}\n3\n[ɑːs.pɯt kɛm.mɪt ɑj.χɑɫ.ɫɑːχ su̯o.ɫɑ]\n[ɑr.t͡ʃɯ.ɫɯːr ɑːr ɑɫ.gɯ.hɯn bie̯r.d̪ɛ]\n[sɑ.χɑ.bɯt sɪ.ɾɛ d͡ʑɔ.hʊn du̯o.ɫɑn]\n[sɑj.dɯː ɑːɾ.tɯ.gɑr ty̑ø.ɾɛ.ɣɛ tʏs.tɛ ‖]\n}}}}\n|}\nRussian version\n{|cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;vertical-align:top;white-space:nowrap;\"\n|-\n!Cyrillic script!!Latin script\n|-\n|\nII\nПривольно Лена наша течёт,\nВодой живой до края полна.\nОна согласье и силу несёт,\nДарует мир всем народам она.\n}}\nIII\nЗемля Саха, святыни твои\nС вершин веков напутствуют нас.\nМы путь продолжили предков своих,\nИ с честью мы их исполним наказ.\n}}}}\n|\nII\nPrivoljno Lena naša tečjot,\nVodoj živoj do kraja polna.\nOna soglasje i silu nesjot\nDarujet mir vsem narodam ona.\n}}\nIII\nZemlja Saha, svjatyni tvoi\nS veršin vekov naputstvujut nas.\nMy putj prodolžili predkov svoih,\nI s čestjju my ih ispolnim nakaz.\n}}}}\n|}\nEnglish version\nII\nAbundantly our Lena floweth,\nAround thy wide borders with great strength.\nShe beareth harmony and good health,\nPeace to our people she bestoweth.\n}}\nIII\nO Sakha land, thy sacred places\nGuide and save us from peaks of aeons.\nWe shall uphold our forebears' path,\nTheir mandate we shall fulfill with faith.\n}}}}\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://sakha.gov.ru/node/199  Lyrics of the Anthem in Sakha]\n*[http://sakha.gov.ru/node/198  Lyrics of the Anthem is Russian]\n*[http://sakha.gov.ru/node/200  Sheet music for the anthem with Sakha lyrics]\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
