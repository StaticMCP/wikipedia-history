In addition to original Android functionalities, GoDroid pre-integrates some useful middleware components and libraries, as well as some self-developed function blocks, which makes it also a software development kit for Android applications.\nFeatures\nBooting option\nGoDroid supports booting from NAND Flash or from MicroSD card that contains the boot code and image files.\nMultimedia\nBy replacing Android native media engine StageFright with GStreamer and utilizing hardware acceleration facilities, GoDroid supports various audio/video/container hardware decoding and multiple network protocols including Microsoft Smooth Streaming, HTTP Live Streaming and KODI 14.2 has variety of supported video/audio plug-ins.\nWireless display standards\nBesides the screen mirroring function of Android Miracast, GoDroid also implements DLNA system service for sharing digital media among multimedia devices. DMR, DMS and DMP are supported.\nProgramming language\nIn addition to C/C++/Java, GoDroid also integrates QPython2engine for Python 2 programming on Android.\nInter-connection with other OSH platform\nTIGER Board provides 2 sets of 40-pin expansion headers, one of which is compatible to Raspberry Pi connector. Raspberry Pi Python applications can be ported and run on GoDroid.\nIntegrated development environment\nGoDroid supports Android Studio as application IDE. With API level 19 configuration to match GoDroid provides the availability of not only original Android API, but also proprietary extended API, such as GPIO/IC2/SPI/PWM.\nDebugging\nGoDroid supports standard ADB debugging via Ethernet, Wi-Fi and USB.\nGoBian\nGoBian is a Linux-embedded operating system running on TIGER Board for the GoWarrior platform.\nGoBian is developed based on Raspbian which is from Debian 7 wheezy armhf, and differs from Raspbian for the extra features, for example, GoBian encapsulates the RPi.gpio and other I/O libraries to facilitate transplanting projects which use the related libraries from Raspberry Pi to TIGER Board. Furthermore, GoBian provides support for multimedia by integrating GOF, KODI and other middle-ware modules and applications out-of-the-box.\nFeatures\nNetworking & remote access\nGoBian enables the Internet connection through Ethernet or Wi-Fi through the Ethernet port and Wi-Fi module on TIGER Board, and thus supports various methods to access the projects and transfer data, such as FTP, SSH.\nTimekeeping\nGoBian automatically synchronizes the system time with Internet time servers using the NTP protocol.\nFile system\nGoBian integrates a built-in file system for data management.\nBuilt-in programming environments\nC, C++, Python, Perl, and shell script.\nI/O interfaces\nGoBian lets you call the GPIO/I2C/UART/SPI interfaces directly in your projects with the built-in RPi.gpio and other libraries.\nMultimedia\nGoBian makes it easy for the secondary development of multimedia applications with the customized GOF middle-ware for TIGER Board.\nMultitasking\nThe on-board M3733-AFAAA processor makes GoBian a multitasking system with good performance.\nLinux software\nThe software programs that are available for Debian are basically compatible with GoBian.\nLow-power sleep mode\nGoBian supports the ultra-power-saving sleep mode (PMU Standby), with the entire board power consumption as low as 0.35W.\nMulti-screen sharing\nGoBian integrates with DLNA to fully support the multimedia sharing and multi-screen interaction.\nCloudQ\nCloudQ provides back-end community support to users.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20151212194355/http://www.gowarriorosh.com/wp/en_US/ GoWarrior]\n* [http://www.arm.com/cortex-a9.php/ ARM]"
