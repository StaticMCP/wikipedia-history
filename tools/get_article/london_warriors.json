They compete in the BAFA National League Premier Division South, the highest level of British American football.\nHistory\nThe London Warriors were formed in 2007 as a senior team of the successful London Warriors youth team, which had won the British Youth American Football Association for the previous two years running. After being accepted by the British American Football League as affiliate members, they arranged to play the two friendly matches required under BAFL regulations. In October 2007, the Warriors played home and away games against two teams from the British Universities American Football League&mdash;the first game was played at home to the Royal Holloway Vikings and ended in a 54&ndash;0 victory. One week later, they travelled to play the Loughborough Aces and won again, this time 42&ndash;7.\nAfter completing their obligations, the BAFL formally accepted the Warriors (the Cobras) application to join the league in December 2007, allowing them to compete as full members for the 2008 season.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.londonwarriorsafc.co.uk/ London Warriors homepage]"
