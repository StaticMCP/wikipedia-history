It provides Jewish education, but also admits and caters to students of other faiths.\nFacilities\nIn September 2011, the primary and secondary moved into a new school building, as part of the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. There are three floors in King David. On the ground floor, there are the \"creative\" subjects, including ICT, business, art, design technology, and PE. There is also the reception area, sixth form common room, and atrium. On the first floor, there are the humanities subjects (English, modern foreign languages, history, and geography). The second floor is the home to the mathematics rooms and science labs. All floors have \"breakout\" spaces, where classes can go to do project/group work. There are also ICT facilities, toilets, and water fountains on each floor.\nNotable alumni\n* Ian Broudie, singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer\n* Malandra Burrows, actress and singer\n* Guy Chambers musician and composer\n* Simon Fishel, IVF professor\n* Ron Hesketh, Anglican priest and former RAF Chaplain-in-Chief\n* Jason Isaacs, actor\n* Missy Bo Kearns, footballer for Liverpool FC Women\n* Stuart Polak, Baron Polak, Conservative politician and member of the House of Lords\n* Mark Simpson, composer and clarinet player\n* Neal Skupski, tennis player\n* David Wolfson, Baron Wolfson of Tredegar, politician, barrister, and life peer\n* Michael Woodford, business executive\nSee also\n*Jewish day school\n*King David School (disambiguation), for other King David Schools\nReferences"
