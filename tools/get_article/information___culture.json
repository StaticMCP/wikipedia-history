It was established in 1966 as The Journal of Library History and was published at Florida State University School of Library Science until it moved to the University of Texas Press in 1976. It was briefly known as Journal of Library History, Philosophy, and Comparative Librarianship before returning to Journal of Library History. In 1988, the title was changed to Libraries & Culture, and changed again to Libraries and the Cultural Record in 2006. In 2012, the journal obtained its current title. The editor-in-chief is Andrew Dillon  (University of Texas at Austin School of Information). It is abstracted and indexed in America: History and Life, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, Book Review Index, Bulletin des Bibliothèques de France, Historical Abstracts,  Journal of American History, Library and Information Science Abstracts, Library Literature and Information Science, MLA International Bibliography, and Social Sciences Citation Index.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
