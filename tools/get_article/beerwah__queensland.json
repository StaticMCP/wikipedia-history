Kilcoy–Beerwah Road enters from the west.\nBeerwah railway station () on the Nambour and Gympie North railway line serves the town.\nHistory\nThe name Beerwah comes from the Kabi language (Turrbal dialect) word birrawaman, with birra meaning sky and wandum meaning climbing up.\nBeerwah Post Office opened by August 1907 (a receiving office had been open from 1891).\nThe Coochin Creek Provisional School opened on 27 November 1888 with an initial enrolment of 19 students under teacher William Verrants.

In about November 1928, it was renamed Beerwah State School. The school celebrated its golden jubilee in 1938. On 10 July 1952, another Coochin Creek State School opened, but it closed on 11 March 1962.\nOn Saturday 26 September 1914, the local Anglican residents held a meeting to consider erecting a church in Beerwah. Mr Mawhinney donated a piece of land by the railway station. On Saturday 7 November 1914 Archdeacon Henry Le Fanu officially capped the first stump of the new church building. All the materials for the church and the labour were all donated so the church would be free of debt. On Saturday 6 March 1916, Archdeacon Le Fanu returned to officially open and dedicate St James' Anglican Church. In the 1990s, diminishing numbers in the congregations led to a decision to close a number of churches in the area.

As part of that project, the original level crossing was closed and demolished, causing concern among local residents who claimed the railway sliced the town in two.\nIn 2010, many residents began to complain about the lack of signage to the town centre, resulting in two distinctive large directional signs, one at the Steve Irwin Way entrance, and one at the roundabout after travelling over the railway bridge.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Beerwah had a population of 6,769 people, 52% female and 48% male.
