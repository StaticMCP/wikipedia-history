In 1906, another Horsham brewer, G.H. Barnes and Co., merged with King & Sons thus forming King and Barnes.\nThe company was taken over in 2000 by Hall and Woodhouse. The brewery building was sold off and demolished for housing.\nThe pubs are now managed by Hall and Woodhouse, while the Hall and Woodhouse Badger Brewery acquired the rights to the King & Barnes brand names. The brewery's cask ales were very popular in the local area; while King & Barnes had also gained a wider reputation for their bottle-conditioned beers.\nIn 2001, Bill King of King & Barnes formed a small brewery in Horsham, WJ King & Co. The ex-head brewer Andy Hepworth also formed a brewery in the town which as well as their own beers contract-brews and bottles for other companies.\nNotable beers\n*Sussex Bitter\n*Festive\n*Broadwood\n*Old Ale\n*Mild\nExternal links\n*[http://www.quaffale.org.uk/php/brewery/41 Quaffale's brewery information]\n*[http://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/king-and-barnes/54/ RateBeer's brewery information]\n*[http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer-News/Article-421.htm Article by SilkTork on King & Barnes]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110807094308/http://kingbeer.co.uk/ W.J.
