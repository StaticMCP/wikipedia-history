Today, it is a neighborhood in the South Philadelphia section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Because of its location south of the early Philadelphia, the name was adopted in allusion to the borough of Southwark in the county of London, England, just south of the city of London.\nHistory\nSouthwark is one of the oldest English settlements in the County of Philadelphia.  It is actually the oldest district founded by settlers in Philadelphia, as a result of its inclusion in the former Swedish colony of New Sweden. Southwark was originally a tract of ground on the fast land of the Neck, lying between Passyunk and Wicaco. Due to the populations of the Swedish settlements of Wicaco and Moyamensing, Southwark grew earlier than other parts of the county apart from the city of Philadelphia.\nThe General Assembly created the district of Southwark on May 14, 1762, to facilitate cooperation with regard to street-building.  As early as 1838, the district had its own police force. Southwark was the location of the shipbuilding complex of Joshua Humphreys, the shipbuilder and naval architect who built the first six ships of the United States Navy and is known as the \"Father of the U.S. Navy\".\nIn 1854, when it was incorporated into the city of Philadelphia by the Act of Consolidation, the borough comprised the area bounded on the north by South Street, on the west by Passyunk Avenue from 5th and South to 10th and Reed; the boundary then ran along Reed Street, down 7th, and along Mifflin Street to the river.\nOnly a few traces of the name \"Southwark\" remain in this part of Philadelphia. The Southwark Post Office is located at 925 Dickinson Street. Other namesakes include Southwark Restaurant at 4th and Bainbridge Sts. and Southwark Development Corp., a public-housing project along Washington Avenue from 3rd to 5th Sts. Although not part of the Southwark District, the word \"Southwark\" is painted on a wall at 23rd Street and Washington Avenue.\nIn 1969, this area of Philadelphia was renamed, and the Northern portion is now commonly known as Queen Village. The neighborhood of Pennsport is the primary southern half of what was Southwark.  The area is a diverse community, a multi-racial neighborhood of middle class, working class, and professionals.\nThe historic district, as defined by the National Register of Historic Places, is bounded by 5th Street on the west, Lombard Street on the north, Washington Avenue on the south, and Front, Catharine, and Queen Streets and Columbus Boulevard (formerly Delaware Avenue) on the east.\nEducation\nResidents are within the School District of Philadelphia.\nResidents are zoned to Southwark School (K-8) and South Philadelphia High School.\nThe Vare-Washington School, which occupies the former George Washington School, is in proximity to Southwark. Persons zoned to Vare-Washington are also zoned to Furness High School. and residents of the former Abigail Vare School zone, are also zoned to Furness High School.\nFile:Preparation for War to defend Commerce Birch's Views Plate 29.jpg|\"The Swedish Church Southwark with the building of the Frigate Philadelphia,\" Plate 29 of Birch's Views of Philadelphia (1800)\nFile:Southwark School Philly.JPG|Southwark School\nSee also\n* Queen Village, Philadelphia\n* Fabric Row (Philadelphia)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.phila.gov/phils/Docs/Inventor/graphics/wards/wards1.htm Chronology of the Political Subdivisions of the County of Philadelphia, 1683-1854] ()\n*[http://www.ushistory.org/philadelphia/incorporated.html Information] courtesy of [http://www.ushistory.org ushistory.org]\n*[http://www.ushistory.org/philadelphia/incorporated.html Incorporated District, Boroughs, and Townships in the County of Philadelphia, 1854 By Rudolph J.
