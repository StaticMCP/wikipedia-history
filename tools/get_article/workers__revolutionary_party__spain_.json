Both parties initially contested the 1994 European Parliament election as the GPOR–PST (LVS) coalition. The PRT eventually joined United Left (IU) in 1998, and in 2002 it merged with Revolutionary Left (IR) to form the Workers' Revolutionary Party–Revolutionary Left (PRT–IR).\nMember parties\n*Workers' Socialist Party (Socialist Truth) (PST (LVS))\n*Group for Building a Revolutionary Workers' Party (GPOR)\nReferences"
