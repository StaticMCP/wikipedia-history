While it had two episodes broadcast consecutively on August 13, 2002, this was the only time that the series made it to the air.\nSynopsis\nThe program focuses on a bearded collie named Jack (played by Chip, voiced by Park Bench), whose ''Look Who's Talking-style narration provided his perspective of his newly adopted family. Carolyn Dunn and Richard Waugh portrayed Mary and Bill Poole, parents of Mark (Gage Knox) and Jessica (Alex Appel).\nThe pilot showed how Jack feigned an injury in a grocery store parking lot to entice Jessica into taking him to the family house. The family collectively decided to take care of him until the injury is healed, but Jack became a permanent resident after disrupting a family argument and saving Mark from a neighborhood gang.\nThe second – and last – episode to be aired had Jack being kicked out of the Poole home after ruining Bill's vacation plans; the rest of the episode was spent on the family's search for the dog after Bill had a change of heart.\nCast\n*Carolyn Dunn as Mary Poole\n*Richard Waugh as Bill Poole\n*Gage Knox as Mark Poole\n*Alex Appel as Jessica Poole\n*Park Bench as Jack (voice)\nEpisodes\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       =\n}}\n|ShortSummary    =\n|LineColor       =\n}}\n}}\nReception\nThe program received generally negative reviews from the national press.
