It features eight quartet performances by Murray with Stanley Franks, Don Pullen, and Andrew Cyrille.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = ''Christgau's Consumer Guide\n| rev2score = A+\n|rev3 = The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\n|rev3score  =\n}}\nReviewing for Playboy in April 1992, Robert Christgau hailed Murray as \"the most generous saxophone virtuoso since Sonny Rollins\" and Shakill's Warrior'' \"the funkiest record he's ever made\", as well as \"one of the most evocative\".}}\nChristgau later ranked ''Shakill's Warrior'' as the second best album of 1992 in his year-end \"Dean's List\" for The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics poll. In ''Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s'' (2000), he assigned the album an A-plus grade, although he later said in 2020, after relistening: \"in what may have been the first time in 25 years, one thing became clear quick: not an A plus.\"\nIn another retrospective appraisal, AllMusic's Scott Yanow stated: \"The music, with the exception of some typical Murray outbursts into the extreme upper register, is generally respectful and soulful, one of Murray's mellower efforts.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"Blues for Savannah\" (Murray) – 7:26\n# \"Song from the Old Country\" (Pullen) – 7:01\n# \"High Priest\" (Cyrille) – 11:59\n# \"In the Spirit\" (Pullen) – 9:49\n# \"Shakill's Warrior\" (Murray) – 8:37\n# \"At the Cafe Central\" (Pullen) – 10:52\n# \"Black February (Butch Morris) – 8:53\n# \"Milano Strut\" (Pullen) – 8:17\nPersonnel\n*David Murray – tenor saxophone\n*Don Pullen – organ\n*Stanley Franks – guitar\n*Andrew Cyrille – drums\nReferences"
