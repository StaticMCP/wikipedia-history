It is owned by Vici Properties and operated by Century Casinos. Missouri's first non-floating casino that makes its home next to the Mississippi River.\nIn 2005, the casino generated $28 million in revenue and $7 million in profits.\nHistory\nThe casino opened on April 28, 1995 as Casino Aztar. It was built by Aztar Corp. at a cost of $55 million.\nAztar was acquired by Columbia Sussex in January 2007. Columbia Sussex, unable to obtain a casino license in the state, immediately put the property up for sale and threatened to close it down in order to preserve the takeover deal with Aztar.\nIn 2007, Isle of Capri Casinos purchased the casino from Columbia Sussex for about $45 million. Casino Aztar Caruthersville was re-branded Lady Luck Casino Caruthersville on June 10, 2008. Isle of Capri was acquired by Eldorado Resorts in 2017.\nIn 2019, Eldorado sold the casino, along with two other properties, to Century Casinos and Vici Properties. Century bought the casino's operating business for $12 million, while Vici bought the land and buildings for $67 million and leased them to Century. Century stated that the casino would be renamed as Century Casino Caruthersville.\nCentury purchased a neighboring two-story hotel building in 2021. The hotel was renovated and reopened in 2022 as The Farmstead, with 36 rooms.\nSee also\n*List of casinos in Missouri\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
