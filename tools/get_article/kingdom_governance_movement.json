He spoke of a \"demonic invasion\" by the \"New Age Movement\" and claimed that his party would save the country from the \"anti-Christ system\".\nThe party won no seats in the 2014 elections.\nElection results\nNational elections\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!Election\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n|-\n| 2014\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 6,408\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0.03\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n|}\nProvincial elections\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|----- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Election\n!colspan=\"2\" |Eastern Cape\n!colspan=\"2\" |Gauteng\n!colspan=\"2\" |Kwazulu-Natal\n!colspan=\"2\" |Western Cape\n|-\n|----- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n|align=\"center\"|%\n|Seats\n|align=\"center\"|%\n|Seats\n|align=\"center\"|%\n|Seats\n|align=\"center\"|%\n|Seats\n|-\n|2014\n| align=\"right\"|0.18\n| align=\"right\"|0/63\n| align=\"right\"|0.02\n| align=\"right\"|0/73\n| align=\"right\"|0.05\n| align=\"right\"|0/80\n| align=\"right\"|0.02\n| align=\"right\"|0/42\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
