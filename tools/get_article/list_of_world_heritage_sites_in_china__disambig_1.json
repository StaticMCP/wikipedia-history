Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. China accepted the convention on 12 December 1985, making its sites eligible for inclusion on the list.\nChina has 60 World Heritage Sites on the list, ranking second in the world, just below Italy with 61 sites. Of these 60 sites, 41 are listed for their cultural, 15 for their natural, and 4 sites for both cultural and natural significance. In addition, China also has 60 sites on its tentative list.\nThe first sites in China were added to the list in 1987 when six sites were inscribed. The most recent additions took place in 2025 when the Xixia Imperial Tombs were listed. One site is transnational, as the Silk Roads: the Routes Network of Chang'an-Tianshan Corridor is shared with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\n}}\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (prov. level)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n!scope=row| Mount Taishan\n|\n| Shandong\n| 1987\n| 437; i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii (mixed)\n| Mount Tai is the most important of the five Sacred Mountains of China.

The area is home to the Asian black bear, dhole, and water deer.\n|-\n!scope=row| Mountain Resort and its Outlying Temples, Chengde\n|\n| Hebei\n| 1994\n| 703; ii, iv (cultural)\n| The resort was built in the 18th century as the summer palace for the Qing dynasty emperors. At the same time it functioned as a base to strengthen administration in the border regions. The palaces, temples, and gardens are designed to be integrated harmoniously with the natural environment, following the principles of feng shui. Several temples are in the styles of ethnic minorities of the empire. The Putuo Zongcheng Temple in the Tibetan style is pictured.\n|-\n!scope=row| Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu\n|\n| Shandong\n| 1994\n| 704; i, iv, vi (cultural)\n| Qufu was the birthplace of Confucius, a great Chinese philosopher, educator, and politician, who died in the 5th century BCE. His teachings, known as Confucianism, were greatly influential in China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, as well as in the 18th century Europe during the Age of Enlightenment. The temple was originally built in 478 BCE and was rebuilt and expanded over centuries. The continuous support of the emperors meant that the finest artisans worked on the complex which includes the Temple of Confucius (pictured), the Kong Family Mansion, and the Cemetery of Confucius where he and more than 100,000 of his descendants are buried.\n|-\n!scope=row| Ancient Building Complex in the Wudang Mountains\n|\n| Hubei\n| 1994\n| 705; i, ii, vi (cultural)\n| The religious complex in the Wudang Mountains was established as a centre for Taoism under the Tang dynasty in the 7th century.

The only fish in the lake is the Przewalskii's naked carp which migrates to inflow streams to spawn.\n|-\n!scope=row| Scenic and historic area of Sacred Mountains and Lakes\n|\n| Tibet\n| 2017\n| iii, v, vi, vii, viii, x (mixed)\n| The mountain landscape, with prominent features including Mount Kailash (pictured), Naimona'nyi, Lake Manasarovar, and Lhanag-tso, is sacred in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Bon religions. The area was the cradle of the Zhangzhung civilization. Religious ceremonies date back at least to 1000 BCE. Circumambulation of Mount Kailash on foot is still an important religious ceremony. From the natural point of view, the area is important in view of documenting effects of plate tectonics that created the Himalayas, numerous glaciers, Cenozoic fossil sites, and biodiversity.\n|-\n!scope=row| Taihang Mountain\n|\n| Hebei, Shanxi, Henan\n| 2017\n| iii, vii, viii, x (mixed)\n| Taihang Mountains, part of the Loess Plateau, have different land formations, including gorges, caves, and waterfalls. There are geological layers spanning from the Archean eon to Cenozoic, with important fossil finds. Furthermore, there are archaeological sites related to early humans that were present in the area up to 2 million years ago. Animals that live in the area include the black stork and golden eagle.\n|-\n!scope=row| Vertical Vegetation Landscape and Volcanic Landscape in Changbai Mountain\n|\n| Jillin\n| 2017\n| vii, viii, ix, x (natural)\n| The mountain is a dormant volcano with a crater lake, Heaven Lake (pictured). Vegetation zones along the mountain slopes support diverse plant communities characteristic of temperate forests at lower elevations to those similar to the Arctic on the top. The mountains feature volcanic, glacial, and karst landforms.\n|-\n!scope=row| Guizhou Triassic Fossil Sites\n|\n| Guizhou\n| 2019\n| viii (natural)\n| Four fossil sites comprised in this nomination provide an insight into the evolution of marine life during the Triassic period, following the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Terrestrial reptiles transitioned to life in the oceans, giving rise to groups such as ichthyosaurs and earliest turtles. A museum display of a Xinpusaurus fossil is pictured.\n|-\n!scope=row| Huangguoshu Scenic Area\n|\n| Guizhou\n| 2019\n| v, vii, viii (mixed)\n| The karst landscape was shaped through centuries by the Bouyei and Miao people, in interaction with the Han Chinese. There are ancient villages, remains of military camps, and bridges. Natural features include karst formations and the large Huangguoshu Waterfall (pictured).\n|-\n!scope=row| Hainan Tropical Rainforest and the Traditional Settlement of Li Ethnic Group\n|\n| Hainan\n| 2022\n| iii, v, x (mixed)\n| The Hainan Island is rich in plant species and home to the endangered and endemic Hainan black-crested gibbon, as well as several endemic bird species. The Hlai people, or Li, that live on the island have developed a culture that is constantly adapting to life in a tropical setting. However, traditional villages are today endangered because of rapid development and globalization.\n|-\n!scope=row| Fujian Minjiang River Estuary: The ecotone between marine and terrestrial biogeographical regions\n|\n| Fujian\n| 2022\n| x (nautral)\n| The area comprises different habitats such as mangroves, salt marshes, sea, and a river estuary. There are over 100 species of fish and the area is important for migratory birds.\n|-\n!scope=row| Hezheng Mammalian Fossil Sites of Gansu\n|\n| Gansu\n| 2024\n| viii (natural)\n| This nomination comprises five fossil sites in Hezheng County. They are rich with mammal, bird, and reptile fossils from the period from 30 to 2 million years ago. Genera identified in these sites include Hipparion, Coelodonta, and Platybelodon (a molar pictured), related to modern-day horses, rhinocerouses, and elephants, respectively.\n|-\n!scope=row| Guizhou Shuanghe Cave\n|\n| Guizhou\n| 2025\n| vii, viii (natural)\n| This cave is the longest in Asia and the third longest in the world. A plethora of natural processes has formed the complex and at times unpredictable shape of Shaunghe Cave, reflecting the different stages of Earth's history. Almost all types of carbonate and sulfate deposits can be found here. Furthermore, the cave is the site of numerous well-preserved fossils.\n|-\n!scope=row| Zhangye Colorful Hills\n|\n| Gansu\n| 2025\n| vii, viii (natural)\n| These hills exhibit a striped pattern as the result of folding of different rock layers that formed due to complex tectonic processes. As the consequence of their low resistance to weathering, the hills are rounded and relatively low. In addition to their aesthetic beauty, Zhangye Hills also demonstrate the geologic conditions and dynamics of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras.\n|}\nSee also\n* National priority protected site\n* Principles for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China\nReferences"
