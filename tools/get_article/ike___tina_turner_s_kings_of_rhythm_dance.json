Ike & Tina Turner appear on the cover, but Tina Turner does not sing on this album.\nMost of the songs were penned by Ike Turner with the exception of the duo's Grammy-nominated single \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine.\"\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Billboard\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nThe album received positive reviews.\nBillboard (March 10, 1962): Here’s a rousing, exuberant package of danceable instrumentals (the Turner's don't sing here) with strong teen-appeal. The line-up, featuring standout guitar work, includes 'The Gulley', 'Potato Mash', 'Steel Guitar Rag' and 'Twistaroo'.AllMusic editor Richie Unterberger wrote:Although the 14 tracks on this album are very typical early-'60s rock/R&B instrumentals in their tunes and arrangements, Ike Turner's guitar work is sparkling, lifting the LP out of the generic realm... Ike Turner really squeezes the last drop of invention out of these run-of-the-mill backdrops, though, relentlessly bending notes, wangling the whammy bar, and letting loose with some unpredictable runs and aggressive chording.\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Ike Turner except where noted.\nPersonnel\n*Ike Turner – guitar\n*Kings of Rhythm\nReferences"
