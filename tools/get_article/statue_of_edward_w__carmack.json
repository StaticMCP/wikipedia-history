Carmack was installed in Nashville, Tennessee, United States in 1924. The statue was the work of American sculptor Nancy Cox-McCormack. Carmack was an opponent of Ida B. Wells and encouraged retaliation for her support of the civil rights movement.\nHistory\nCarmack — formerly a US Senator — was shot and killed on November 9, 1908, by Duncan Brown Cooper and their son, Robin Cooper. Both were tried & convicted of murder, then pardoned by Governor Ham Patterson; in 1909, the Tennessee legislature provided for the creation of a memorial sculpture of him by Nancy Cox-McCormack, to be placed on the grounds of the Capitol. It was erected in 1927.\nThe monument was toppled by demonstrators during the George Floyd protests in 2020.\nSee also\n* List of monuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests\nReferences"
