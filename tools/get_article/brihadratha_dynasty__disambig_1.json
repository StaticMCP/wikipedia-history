According to the Mahabharata and the Purana, he was the eldest of the five sons of Uparichara Vasu, the Kuru king of Chedi, and his queen was Girika. The name 'Brihadratha' is found twice in the Rigveda (I.36.18, X.49.6); however, it is not indicated whether this refers to the father of Jarasandha.\nJarasandha\nThe Puranas mention that Jarasandha was the son of Sambhava. The Mahabharatha states that Jarasandha was the son of Brihadratha and the greatest ruler of the dynasty. According to ancient texts, 24 Brihadratha kings ruled for many years. However, the Vayu Purana, Matsya Purana, and Vishnu Purana disagree regarding the Brihadratha period of rule. The astronomical works based on the Vishnu Purana state that the Brihadratha dynasty lasted for 1,000 years.\nThe name of Jarasandha appears in the Puranas many times. Jarasandha was inimical to the Yadava and is mentioned as a villain in the Mahabharata.\nslays Jarasandha in a wrestling fight.]]\nBhima, with the help of Krishna, killed Jarasandha.\nSahadeva\nAccording to scripture, Sahadeva was the son of Jarasandha placed on the throne of Magadha by the Pandava after the assassination of Jarasandha. Sahadeva has fought the Kurukshetra War on the side of the Pandavas. According to the Puranas, he was killed in the Kurukshetra War by Shakuni, along with his cousin Jayadeva. He was succeeded by Somadhi.\nLater rulers\nSomadhi (or Somphi) was the son of Sahadeva and was placed on the throne of Magadha by the Pandavas after he agreed to be their subordinate.\nEnd of dynasty\nThe last of the Brihadratha dynasty was Ripunjaya, who was killed by a minister named Punika (Pulika). After the death of Ripunjaya, Punika placed his son Pradyota on the throne and founded the Pradyota dynasty in 682&nbsp;BCE.\nList of rulers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Brihadratha dynasty rulers according to the Vayu Purana\n!Ruler\n!Reign (BCE)\n!Length of Reign (estd.)\n|-\n| Brihadratha ||1700–1680 BCE\n|20\n|-\n| Jarasandha || 1680–1665 BCE\n|15\n|-\n| Sahadeva || 1665–1661 BCE\n|4\n|-\n| Somadhi || 1661–1603 BCE\n|58\n|-\n| Srutasravas || 1603–1539 BCE\n|64\n|-\n| Ayutayus || 1539–1503 BCE\n|36\n|-\n| Niramitra || 1503–1463 BCE\n|40\n|-\n| Sukshatra || 1463–1405 BCE\n|58\n|-\n| Brihatkarman || 1405–1382 BCE\n|23\n|-\n| Senajit || 1382–1332 BCE\n|50\n|-\n| Srutanjaya || 1332–1292 BCE\n|40\n|-\n| Vipra || 1292–1257 BCE\n|35\n|-\n| Suchi || 1257–1199 BCE\n|60\n|-\n| Kshemya || 1199–1171 BCE\n|26\n|-\n| Subrata || 1171–1107 BCE\n|64\n|-\n| Dharma || 1107–1043 BCE\n|64\n|-\n| Susuma || 1043–970 BCE\n|73\n|-\n| Dridhasena || 970–912 BCE\n|58\n|-\n| Sumati || 912–879 BCE\n|33\n|-\n| Subala || 879–857 BCE\n|22\n|-\n| Sunita || 857–817 BCE\n|40\n|-\n| Satyajit || 817–767 BCE\n|50\n|-\n| Viswajit || 767–732 BCE\n|35\n|-\n| Ripunjaya || 732–682 BCE\n|50\n|}\nSee also\n* Pradyota dynasty\nReferences\n– 682 BCE\n| before = Copper Hoard Culture\n| after = Pradyota dynasty\n}}"
