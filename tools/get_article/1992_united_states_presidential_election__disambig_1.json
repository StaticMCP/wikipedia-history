The Democratic ticket of Arkansas governor Bill Clinton and Senator from Tennessee Al Gore defeated the Republican ticket of incumbent president George H. W. Bush and vice president Dan Quayle and the independent ticket of businessman Ross Perot and vice admiral James Stockdale. The election marked the end of 12 consecutive years of Republican rule of the White House, as well as the end of a longer period of Republican dominance in American presidential politics that began in 1968, with the exception of Jimmy Carter's narrow victory in 1976.\nBush had alienated many conservatives in his party by breaking his 1988 campaign pledge not to raise taxes, but he fended off a primary challenge from paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan without losing a single contest. Bush's popularity following his success in the Gulf War dissuaded high-profile Democratic candidates such as Mario Cuomo from entering the 1992 Democratic primaries. Clinton, a leader of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, established himself as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by sweeping the Super Tuesday primaries. He defeated former governor of California Jerry Brown, former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas, and other candidates to win the nomination, and chose Tennessee senator Al Gore as his running mate. The billionaire Perot launched an independent campaign, emphasizing his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (which at time was being actively negotiated) and his plan to reduce the national debt.\nThe economy had recovered from a recession in the spring of 1991, followed by 19 consecutive months of growth, but perceptions of the economy's slow growth harmed Bush, for he had inherited a substantial economic boom from his predecessor Ronald Reagan. Bush's greatest strength, foreign policy, was regarded as much less important following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, as well as the relatively peaceful climate in the Middle East after the Gulf War. Perot led in several polls taken in June 1992, but severely damaged his candidacy by temporarily dropping out of the race in July. The Bush campaign criticized Clinton's character and emphasized Bush's foreign policy successes, while Clinton focused on the economy.\nClinton won a plurality in the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote, breaking a streak of three consecutive Republican victories. Clinton flipped a total of 22 states that had voted Republican in the election of 1988. Perot won 18.9% of the popular vote, the highest share of the vote won by a candidate outside of the two major parties since 1912.\nDemocratic Party nomination\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|1992 Democratic Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#3333FF; width:200px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#3333FF; width:200px;\"|\n|-  style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#c8ebff;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|for President\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|for Vice President\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| 40th and 42ndGovernor of Arkansas(1979–1981, 1983–1992)\n| U.S. Senatorfrom Tennessee(1985–1993)\n|-\n| colspan=2 |Campaign\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|- †\n| colspan=\"9\" style=\"text-align:center; width:700px; font-size:120%; color:white; background:;\"|Candidates in this section are sorted by date of withdrawal from the primaries\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; font-size:120%;\"|Jerry Brown\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; font-size:120%;\"|Paul Tsongas\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; font-size:120%;\"|Tom Harkin\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; font-size:120%;\"|Bob Kerrey\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; font-size:120%;\"|Douglas Wilder\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|Governorof California(1975–1983)\n|U.S. Senatorfrom Massachusetts(1979–1985)\n|U.S. Senatorfrom Iowa(1985–2015)\n|U.S. Senatorfrom Nebraska(1989–2001)\n|Governorof Virginia(1990–1994)\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|Campaign\n|Campaign\n|Campaign\n|Campaign\n|Campaign\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|Eliminated at Convention:July 15, 19924,071,232 votes\n|Suspended Campaign:March 19, 1992Endorsed Bill Clinton:June 3, 19923,656,010 votes\n|Withdrew:March 9, 1992Endorsed Bill Clinton:March 26, 1992318,457 votes\n|Withdrew:March 5, 1992Endorsed Bill Clinton:May 14, 1992280,304 votes\n|Withdrew:January 8, 1992Endorsed Bill Clinton:July 14, 1992240 votes\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nOverview\nFollowing the successful performance by U.S. and coalition forces in the Persian Gulf War, President George H. W. Bush's approval ratings were 89%. His re-election was considered very likely; several high-profile candidates, such as Mario Cuomo and Jesse Jackson, refused to seek the Democratic nomination. U.S. Senator Al Gore from Tennessee refused to seek the nomination due to the fact his son had been struck by a car and was undergoing surgery and physical therapy; however, Tom Harkin, Paul Tsongas, Jerry Brown, Larry Agran, Bob Kerrey, Douglas Wilder, and Bill Clinton chose to run as candidates.\nHarkin, a U.S. Senator from Iowa, ran as a populist liberal with labor union support. Tsongas, a former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, highlighted his political independence and fiscal conservatism. Jerry Brown, the former California governor who had run for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and 1980, declared a significant reform agenda, including Congressional term limits, campaign finance reform, and the adoption of a flat income tax. Nebraska senator Bob Kerrey was an attractive candidate based on his business and military background, but made several gaffes on the campaign trail. Arkansas governor Bill Clinton positioned himself as a centrist, or New Democrat. He was relatively unknown nationally before the primary season. That quickly changed when Gennifer Flowers alleged an extramarital affair. Clinton denied the story, appearing on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary Clinton; later in 1998, he admitted the affair.\nThe primary began with Harkin winning his native Iowa as expected. Tsongas won the New Hampshire primary on February 18, but Clinton's second-place finish, helped by his speech labeling himself \"The Comeback Kid\", energized his campaign. Brown won the Maine caucus and Kerrey won South Dakota. Clinton won his first primary in Georgia. Tsongas won the Utah and Maryland primaries and a caucus in Washington. Harkin won caucuses in Idaho and Minnesota while Brown won Colorado. Kerrey dropped out two days later. Clinton won the South Carolina and Wyoming primaries and Tsongas won Arizona. Harkin dropped out. Brown won the Nevada caucus. Clinton swept nearly all of the Super Tuesday primaries on March 10 making him the solid front runner. Clinton won the Michigan and Illinois primaries. Tsongas dropped out after finishing third in Michigan; however, Brown began to pick up steam, aided by using a phone number to receive funding from small donors. Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut, Vermont and Alaska. As the race moved to the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, Brown had taken the lead in polls in both states. Then he made a serious gaffe by announcing to an audience of New York City's Jewish community that he would consider Reverend Jackson as a vice presidential candidate; Jackson had offended many Jewish people with remarks he had made during his own presidential campaigns. Clinton won dramatically in New York (41%–26%) and closely in Wisconsin (37%–34%). Clinton then proceeded to win a long streak of primaries leading up to Brown's home state of California. Clinton won this state 48% to 41% and secured the delegates needed to lock the nomination.\nThe convention met in New York City, and the official tally was:\n* Bill J. Clinton 3,372\n* Jerry Brown 596\n* Paul Tsongas 289\n* Robert P. Casey 10\n* Pat Schroeder 5\n* Larry Agran 3\n* Al Gore 1\nClinton chose Gore to be his running mate on July 9, 1992. Choosing fellow Southerner Gore went against the popular strategy of balancing a Southern candidate with a Northern partner. Gore served to balance the ticket in other ways, as he was perceived as strong on family values and environmental issues, while Clinton was not. Gore's similarities to Clinton also allowed him to push some of his key campaign themes, such as centrism and generational change.\nRepublican Party nomination\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|1992 Republican Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#E81B23; width:200px;\"|\n|-  style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#ffd0d7;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|for President\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|for Vice President\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| 41stPresident of the United States(1989–1993)\n| 44thVice President of the United States(1989–1993)\n|-\n| colspan=2 |Campaign\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|- †\n| colspan=\"9\" style=\"text-align:center; width:700px; font-size:120%; color:white; background:;\"|Candidates in this section are sorted by date of withdrawal from the primaries\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; font-size:120%;\"|Pat Buchanan\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; font-size:120%;\"|David Duke\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|White House Communications Directorfrom Virginia(1985–1987)\n|State Representativefrom Louisiana(1989–1992)\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|Campaign\n|Campaign\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n|Withdrew:August 17, 1992Endorsed George Bush:August 17, 19922,899,488 votes\n|Withdrew:April 22, 1992119,115 votes\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\nPaleoconservative journalist Pat Buchanan was the primary opponent of President Bush; Ron Paul, the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee in 1988, had planned to run against the President, but dropped out shortly after Buchanan's entry in December. Buchanan's best showing was in the New Hampshire primary on February 18, 1992—where Bush won by a 53–38% margin. President Bush won 73% of all primary votes, with 9,199,463 votes. Buchanan won 2,899,488 votes; unpledged delegates won 287,383 votes, and David Duke, Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, won 119,115 votes. Just over 100,000 votes were cast for all other candidates, half of which were write-in votes for H. Ross Perot. Former Minnesota governor Harold Stassen, who had run for president nine times since 1944, also mounted his final campaign.\nPresident George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle easily won renomination by the Republican Party. However, the success of the opposition forced the moderate Bush to move further to the right than in the previous election, and to incorporate many socially conservative planks in the party platform. Bush allowed Buchanan to give a prime time address at the Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas, and his \"Culture War\" speech alienated liberal Republicans.\nWith intense pressure on the Buchanan delegates to relent, the tally for president went as follows:\n* George H. W. Bush 2166\n* Pat Buchanan 18\n* former ambassador Alan Keyes 1\nVice President Dan Quayle was renominated by voice vote.\nRoss Perot candidacy\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"2\"|1992 Independent ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"|\n|-  style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#90EE90;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|for President\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|for Vice President\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| President and CEO of Perot Systems(1988–2009)\n| President of the Naval War College(1977–1979)\n|-\n| colspan=2 |Campaign\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n|-\n|}\nThe public's concern about the federal budget deficit and fears of professional politicians led to the independent candidacy of billionaire Texan Ross Perot increasing in popularity in the polls—at one point Perot was leading the major party candidates. Perot crusaded against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and internal and external national debt, tapping into voters' potential fear of the deficit. His volunteers succeeded in collecting enough signatures to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. In June, Perot led the national public opinion polls with support from 39% of the voters (versus 31% for Bush and 25% for Clinton). Perot severely damaged his credibility by dropping out of the presidential contest in July and remaining out of the race for several weeks before re-entering. He compounded this damage by eventually claiming, without evidence, that his withdrawal was due to Republican operatives attempting to disrupt his daughter's wedding.\nPerot and retired Vice Admiral James Stockdale drew 19,743,821 votes (19% of the popular vote).\nMinor parties and independents\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;font-size:big\" colspan=\"30\"|Minor party candidates, 1992\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#8B0000; width:100px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#8B0000; width:100px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#8B0000; width:100px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#8B0000; width:100px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#8B0000; width:100px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#8B0000; width:100px;\"|\n|-  style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#F08080;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|Andre Marrou\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|Lenora Fulani\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|John Hagelin\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|Bo Gritz\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|Howard Phillips\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|Lyndon LaRouche\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Alaska State Representative(1985–1987)\n| Psychologist and political activist\n| Scientistand researcher\n| Conservativepolitical activist\n| Conservativepolitical activist\n| Political activist\n|-\n|}\nLibertarian Party nomination\nLibertarian candidates:\n* Andre Marrou, former Alaska State Representative and 1988 vice presidential nominee\n* Richard B. Boddie, political science professor from California\nThe 6th Libertarian Party National Convention was held in Chicago, Illinois. There, the Libertarian Party nominated Andre Marrou, former Alaska State Representative and the Party's 1988 vice presidential candidate, for president. Nancy Lord was his running mate.\nMarrou and Lord drew 291,627 votes (0.28% of the popular vote).\nNew Alliance Party nomination\nNew Alliance candidate:\n* Lenora Fulani, Psychotherapist and political activist from New Jersey, and the 1988 Presidential nominee\nLenora Fulani, who was the 1988 presidential nominee of the New Alliance Party, received a second consecutive nomination from the Party in 1992. Unlike in 1988, Fulani failed to gain ballot access in every state, deciding to concentrate some of that campaign funding towards exposure of her candidacy and the Party to the national public.\nFulani also sought the endorsement of the Peace and Freedom Party of California, but despite winning a majority in that party's primary, she would lose the nomination to Ronald Daniels, the former Director the National Rainbow Coalition. Rather than pursuing a ballot space of her own, Fulani would endorse Daniels's candidacy in California.\nFulani and her running mate Maria Elizabeth Muñoz received 73,622 votes (0.1% of the popular vote).\nNatural Law Party nomination\nThe newly formed Natural Law Party nominated scientist and researcher John Hagelin for president and Mike Tompkins for vice president. The Natural Law Party had been founded in 1992 by Hagelin and 12 others who felt that governmental problems could be solved more effectively by following \"Natural Laws\". The party platform included preventive health care, sustainable agriculture and renewable energy technologies.

Two-way trial heats between Bush and Clinton in early 1992 showed Bush in the lead. As the economy continued to sour and the President's approval rating continued to slide, the Democrats began to rally around their nominee. On July 9, 1992, Clinton chose Tennessee senator and former 1988 presidential candidate Al Gore to be his running mate. As Governor Clinton's nomination acceptance speech approached, Ross Perot dropped out of the race, convinced that staying in the race with a \"revitalized Democratic Party\" would cause the race to be decided by the United States House of Representatives. Clinton gave his acceptance speech on July 16, 1992, promising to bring a \"new covenant\" to America, and to work to heal the gap that had developed between the rich and the poor during the Reagan/Bush years. The Clinton campaign received the biggest convention \"bounce\" in history which brought him from 25% in the spring, behind Bush and Perot, to 55% versus Bush's 31%.\nAfter the convention, Clinton and Gore began a bus tour around the United States, while the Bush/Quayle campaign began to criticize Clinton's character, highlighting accusations of infidelity and draft dodging. The Bush campaign emphasized its foreign policy successes such as Desert Storm, and the end of the Cold War. Bush also contrasted his military service to Clinton's lack thereof, and criticized Clinton's lack of foreign policy expertise. However, as the economy was the main issue, Bush's campaign floundered across the nation, even in strongly Republican areas, and Clinton maintained leads with over 50% of the vote nationwide consistently, while Bush typically saw numbers in the upper 30s. As Bush's economic edge had evaporated, his campaign looked to energize its socially conservative base at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas. At the convention, Bush's primary campaign opponent Pat Buchanan gave his famous \"culture war\" speech, criticizing Clinton's and Gore's social progressiveness, and voicing skepticism on his \"New Democrat\" brand. After President Bush accepted his renomination, his campaign saw a small bounce in the polls, but this was short-lived, as Clinton maintained his lead. The campaign continued with a lopsided lead for Clinton through September, until Ross Perot decided to re-enter the race. Ross Perot's re-entry in the race was welcomed by the Bush campaign, as Fred Steeper, a poll taker for Bush, said, \"He'll be important if we accomplish our goal, which is to draw even with Clinton.\" Initially, Perot's return saw the Texas billionaire's numbers stay low, until he was given the opportunity to participate in a trio of unprecedented three-man debates. The race narrowed, as Perot's numbers significantly improved as Clinton's numbers declined, while Bush's numbers remained more or less the same from earlier in the race as Perot and Bush began to hammer at Clinton on character issues once again.\nPresidential debates\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates organised four presidential debates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Debates among candidates for the 1992 U.S. presidential election\n!No.\n!Date\n!Host\n!Location\n!Panelists\n!Moderator\n!Participants\n!Viewership\n(Millions)\n|-\n|P1\n|Sunday, October 11, 1992\n|Washington University in St. Louis\n|St. Louis, Missouri\n|Sander VanocurAnn ComptonJohn Mashek\n|Jim Lehrer\n|President George H.

Clinton was often accused of being a philanderer by political opponents.\nAllegations were also made that Bill Clinton had engaged in a long-term extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers.  Clinton denied ever having an affair with Flowers, but later admitted, under threat of perjury, that he had a brief sexual encounter with her in 1977.\nResults\nClinton was declared the winner by CBS, NBC, and CNN at 10:48 P.M. EST and by ABC at 10:50 P.M. EST. He received 370 electoral votes from 32 states and D.C. and 43% of the popular vote while Bush received 168 electoral votes from 18 states and 37.4% of the popular vote and Perot received 18.9% of the popular vote and no electoral votes. The remaining candidates took 0.6% of the popular vote. It was the first time since 1968 that a candidate won the White House with under 50% of the popular vote. Only Washington, D.C., and Clinton's home state of Arkansas gave the majority of their votes to a single candidate in the entire country; the rest were won by pluralities of the vote. Clinton was the first Democrat since 1964 to win a majority of states.\nEven though Clinton received roughly 3,100,815 more votes than Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis had four years earlier, the Democrats recorded a 2.7 percentage point decrease in their share of the popular vote compared to 1988 due to the higher turnout. His 43% share of the popular vote was the second-lowest for any winning candidate in the 20th century after Woodrow Wilson in 1912 (41.8%). President Bush's 37.4% was the lowest percentage total for a sitting president seeking re-election since William Howard Taft, also in 1912 (23.2%). 1992 was, as the 1912 election was, a three-way race (that time between Taft, Wilson, and Theodore Roosevelt). It was also the lowest percentage for a major-party candidate since Alf Landon received 36.5% of the vote in 1936. Bush had a lower percentage of the popular vote than even Herbert Hoover, who was defeated in 1932 (39.7%). However, none of these races included a major third-party candidate.\nIndependent candidate Ross Perot received 19,743,821 with 18.9% of the popular vote. The billionaire used his own money to advertise extensively, and is the only non-major party candidate and the only non-party affiliated candidate ever allowed into the nationally televised presidential debates with both major party candidates (independent John Anderson debated Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980, but without Democrat Jimmy Carter, who had refused to appear in a three-man debate). Speaking about the North American Free Trade Agreement, Perot described its effect on American jobs as causing a \"giant sucking sound\". For a period of time, Perot was leading in the polls, but he lost much of his support when he temporarily withdrew from the election, only to declare himself a candidate again soon after. This was also the most recent time that a non-major party candidate and a non-party affiliated candidate won at least one county.\nPerot's 18.9% of the popular vote made him the most successful non-major party presidential candidate in terms of popular vote since Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election. His share of the popular vote was also the highest ever for a candidate who did not win any electoral votes. Although he did not win any states, Perot managed to finish ahead of one of the major party candidates in two states: In Maine, he received 30.44% of the vote to Bush's 30.39% (Clinton won Maine with 38.77%); in Utah, which Bush won with 43.36% of the popular vote, Perot collected 27.34% of the vote to Clinton's 24.65%. Perot also came in 2nd in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, where he had his best overall showing, winning 33.2% of the vote there and missing the district's 1 elector by only 4.6% of the vote.\nThe election was the most recent in which Montana voted for the Democratic candidate, both the last time Florida backed the losing candidate and last time Georgia voted for the Democratic candidate until 2020, and the last time that Colorado voted Democratic until 2008. This was also the first time since Texas' admission to the Union in 1845 that a Democrat won the White House without winning the state, and the second time a Democrat won the White House without North Carolina (the first was 1844), and the second time since Florida's admission (also in 1845) that a Democrat won without winning the state (John F. Kennedy in 1960 was the first).\nClinton was also the only Democrat at that point to win every electoral vote in the Northeast except for Lyndon Johnson in 1964. John Kerry and Barack Obama have been the only Democrats to repeat this since. Also, this was the first time since 1964 that the following nine states had voted Democratic: California, Colorado, Illinois, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Vermont.\nThe 168 electoral votes received by Bush, added to the 426 electoral votes he received in 1988, gave him the most total electoral votes received by any candidate who was elected to the office of president only once (594), and the tenth largest number of electoral votes received by any candidate who was elected to the office of president behind Grover Cleveland's 664, Barack Obama's 697, Woodrow Wilson's 712, Bill Clinton's 749, Donald Trump's 848, Dwight Eisenhower's 899, Ronald Reagan's 1,015, Richard Nixon's 1,040 and Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1,876 total electoral votes.\nBush and Clinton achieved an exact tie in Ware County, Georgia, the most recent time in American history a county was tied between the two major-party presidential candidates. Perot also achieved an exact tie with Bush in Morris County, Kansas.\nAnalysis\nSeveral factors made the results possible. First, the campaign came on the heels of an economic slowdown. Exit polling showed that 75% thought the economy was in fairly or very bad shape while 63% thought their personal finances were better or the same as four years ago. The decision by Bush to accept a tax increase adversely affected his re-election bid. Pressured by rising budget deficits, Bush agreed to a budget compromise with Congress which raised taxes and reduced the federal budget deficit. Clinton was able to condemn the tax increase effectively on both its own merits and as a reflection of Bush's dishonesty. Effective Democratic TV ads were aired showing a clip of Bush's 1988 acceptance speech in which he promised \"Read my lips ... No new taxes.\" Most importantly, Bush's coalition was in disarray, for both the aforementioned reasons and for unrelated reasons. The end of the Cold War allowed old rivalries among conservatives to re-emerge and meant that other voters focused more on domestic policy, to the detriment of Bush, a social and fiscal moderate. The consequence of such a perception depressed conservative turnout.\nThe election was compared to the 1945 United Kingdom general election, in which Winston Churchill, while a respected conservative wartime leader (like Bush) was not regarded as a good peacetime leader, and thus was voted out once the conflict was over.\nUnlike Bush, Clinton was able to unite his fractious and ideologically diverse party behind his candidacy, even when its different wings conflicted. To garner the support of moderates and conservative Democrats, he attacked Sister Souljah, an obscure rap musician whose lyrics Clinton condemned. Furthermore, Clinton made clear his support of the death penalty and would later champion making school uniforms in public schools a requirement. Clinton could also point to his centrist record as governor of Arkansas. More liberal Democrats were impressed by Clinton's record on abortion and affirmative action. His strong connections to African Americans also played a key role. In addition, he organized significant numbers of young voters and became a symbol of the rise of the baby boomer generation to political power. Supporters remained energized and confident, even in times of scandal or missteps.\nThe effect of Ross Perot's candidacy has been a contentious point of debate for many years. In the ensuing months after the election, various Republicans asserted that Perot had acted as a spoiler, enough to the detriment of Bush to lose him the election. While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but roughly two-thirds of those voters who cited Bush's broken \"No New Taxes\" pledge as \"very important\" (25%)  voted for Bill Clinton. The voting numbers reveal that to win the electoral vote Bush would have had to win 10 of the 11 states Clinton won by less than five percentage points. For Bush to earn a majority of the popular vote, he would have needed 12.2% of Perot's 18.9% of the vote, 65% of Perot's support base. State exit polls suggested that Perot did not alter the electoral college count, except potentially in one state (Ohio), which nonetheless showed a result in the margin of error. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate.\nPerot gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. NAFTA played a role in Perot's support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot-button social issues. A 1999 study in the American Journal of Political Science estimated that Perot's candidacy hurt the Clinton campaign, reducing \"Clinton's margin of victory over Bush by seven percentage point.\" In 2016, FiveThirtyEight noted that it was \"unlikely\" that Perot was a spoiler.\nClinton, Bush, and Perot did not focus on abortion during the campaign. Exit polls, however, showed that attitudes toward abortion \"significantly influenced\" the vote, as pro-choice Republicans defected from Bush.\nThe South was the only region where Bush received a majority of the electoral votes and two-thirds of his total electoral votes came from the South.\nImplications\nAccording to Seymour Martin Lipset, this election had several unique characteristics. Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed Bush. A rare event was a strong third-party candidate. Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The chief factor was Clinton's uniting his party, and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups.\nClinton's election ended an era in which the Republican Party had controlled the White House for 12 consecutive years, and for 20 of the previous 24 years. The election also brought the Democrats full control of the legislative and executive branches of the federal government, including both houses of U.S. Congress and the presidency, for the first time since the administration of the last Democratic president, Jimmy Carter. This would not last for very long, however, as the Republicans won control of both the House and Senate in 1994. Reelected in 1996, Clinton would become the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to serve two full terms in the White House and the first to leave office at the end of his second full term since Woodrow Wilson.\n1992 was arguably a political realignment election. It made the Democratic Party dominant in presidential elections in the Northeast, the Great Lakes region, and the West Coast, where many states had previously either been swing states or Republican-leaning. Clinton picked up several states that went Republican in 1988, and which have remained in the Democratic column ever since: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, most of Maine (besides the state's second congressional district, which broke the state's total straight Democratic voting record since, when it voted for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016, along with the two following presidential elections in 2020, and 2024), Maryland, New Jersey, and Vermont. Vermont, carried by Clinton, had been heavily Republican for generations prior to the election, voting for a Democrat only once (in 1964). The state has been won by the Democratic nominee in every presidential election since. Bill Clinton narrowly defeated Bush in New Jersey (by two points), which had voted for the Republican nominee all but twice since 1948. Clinton would later win the state in 1996 by eighteen points; like Vermont, Republicans have not won the state since. California, which had been a Republican stronghold since 1952, was now trending Democratic. Clinton, a native Southerner, was able to carry several states in the South that the GOP had won for much of the past two decades, but ultimately won only four of eleven former Confederate states. This reflected the final shift of the South to the Republican Party. In subsequent presidential elections from 1996 to 2020, 28 out of the 50 states were carried by the same party as in 1992 (15 for the Democrats and 13 for the Republicans).\nDetailed results\nSource (Popular Vote):\nSource (Electoral Vote):\n|43.01}}\n|37.45}}\n|18.91}}\n|0.28}}\n}}\n|68.77}}\n|31.23}}\n}}\nFile:1992 United States presidential election results map by county.svg|Results by county, shaded according to winning candidate's percentage of the vote\nFile:1992 United States presidential election by congressional district.svg|Results by congressional district, shaded according to winning candidate's percentage of the vote\nFile:1992 Presidential shift.svg|County swing from 1988 to 1992\nResults by state\nSource:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Legend\n|-\n|colspan=2| States/districts won by Clinton/Gore\n|-\n|colspan=2| States/districts won by Bush/Quayle\n|-\n| † || At-large results (For states that split electoral votes)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 |\n! colspan=6 | Candidates with electoral votes ()\n! colspan=6 | Candidates with no electoral votes\n! colspan=5 | Overall popular vote\n|-\n! colspan=2 |\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| Bill ClintonDemocratic\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| George H.W.

In both states, two electoral votes were awarded to the winner of the statewide race and one electoral vote was awarded to the winner of each congressional district. District results for Maine and Nebraska do not include results for Marrou or other candidates and so totals differ from those for the states' at-large. Because Perot finished in 2nd place in some districts, the margins of the districts do not match the margin at-large. Nebraska split its electoral votes this way for the first time.\nStates that flipped from Republican to Democratic\n*Arkansas\n*California\n*Colorado\n*Connecticut\n*Delaware\n*Georgia\n*Illinois\n*Kentucky\n*Louisiana\n*Maine\n*Maryland\n*Michigan\n*Missouri\n*Montana\n*Nevada\n*New Jersey\n*New Hampshire\n*New Mexico\n*Ohio\n*Pennsylvania\n*Tennessee\n*Vermont\nClose states\nStates with margin of victory less than 1% (27 electoral votes):\n# Georgia – 0.59% (13,714 votes)\n# North Carolina – 0.79% (20,619 votes)\nStates/Districts with margin of victory less than 5% (175 electoral votes):\n# New Hampshire – 1.22% (6,556 votes)\n# Ohio – 1.83% (90,632 votes)\n# Florida – 1.89% (100,612 votes)\n# Arizona – 1.95% (29,036 votes)\n# New Jersey – 2.37% (79,341 votes)\n# Montana – 2.51% (10,300 votes)\n# Nevada – 2.63% (13,320 votes)\n# Kentucky – 3.21% (47,926 votes)\n# Texas – 3.48% (214,256 votes)\n# South Dakota – 3.52% (11,830 votes)\n# Colorado – 4.26% (66,831 votes)\n# Wisconsin – 4.35% (110,211 votes)\n# Virginia – 4.37% (111,867 votes)\n# '''Maine's 2nd Congressional District – 4.54% (14,237 votes) (margin over Ross Perot)\n# Louisiana – 4.61% (82,585 votes)\n# Tennessee – 4.65% (92,221 votes) (tipping point state)\nStates with margin of victory between 5% and 10% (131 electoral votes):\n# Kansas – 5.14% (59,517 votes)\n# Wyoming – 5.60% (11,187 votes)\n# Iowa – 6.02% (81,462 votes)\n# Indiana – 6.12% (140,955 votes)\n# Connecticut – 6.43% (104,005 votes)\n# Alabama – 6.77% (114,203 votes)\n# Michigan – 7.39% (316,242 votes)\n# South Carolina – 8.14% (97,993 votes)\n# Maine's 1st Congressional District – 8.11% (29,494 votes)\n# Delaware – 8.19% (23,741 votes)\n# Maine – 8.33% (56,600 votes) (margin over Ross Perot)\n# New Mexico – 8.56% (48,793 votes)\n# Oklahoma – 8.63% (119,863 votes)\n# Mississippi – 8.91% (87,535 votes)\n# Pennsylvania – 9.02% (447,323 votes)\n# Alaska – 9.17% (23,706 votes)\n# Oregon – 9.95% (145,557 votes)\nSource: New York Times President Map\nStatistics\nCounties with Highest Percent of Vote (Democratic)\n# Washington, D.C. 84.64%\n# Starr County, Texas 82.80%\n# Macon County, Alabama 82.78%\n# Duval County, Texas 79.56%\n# Jefferson County, Mississippi 79.39%\nCounties with Highest Percent of Vote (Republican)\n# Jackson County, Kentucky 74.96%\n# Sioux County, Iowa 72.21%\n# Hansford County, Texas 69.08%\n# Ochiltree County, Texas 68.06%\n# Shelby County, Alabama 67.97%\nCounties with Highest Percent of Vote (Other)\n# Loving County, Texas 46.88%\n# San Juan County, Colorado 40.40%\n# Billings County, North Dakota 39.82%\n# Somerset County, Maine 38.95%\n# Esmeralda County, Nevada 37.67%\nVoter demographics\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 |Presidential vote in social groups (in percentage)\n|-\n|-\n!
