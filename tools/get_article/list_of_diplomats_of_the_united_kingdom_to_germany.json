The official title is 'His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany'.\nHistory\nOn German unification in 1871 the British ambassador to the Kingdom of Prussia/North German Confederation in Berlin became the ambassador to the new German Empire.  During the partition of Germany following World War II the Ambassador to the new Federal Republic (or West Germany) resided in Bonn, the capital, from 1952.  Berlin once more became the capital at reunification in 1990 and the ambassador returned to Berlin in a new Embassy building, on the exact site of its predecessor in the Wilhelmstrasse, in 2000.\nThis article also includes the following predecessors:\n*German Confederation, whose Diet was at Frankfurt.\n*North German Confederation.\nFor envoys to the:\n* Holy Roman Emperor see Austria.\n* Imperial Diet at Ratisbon see Bavaria.\n* Imperial Court at Brussels see Belgium.\n* Elector of Cologne at Cologne and then Bonn see Cologne\n* Electorate of Hanover and then Kingdom of Hanover at Hanover see Hanover\n* Hanseatic cities of Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck see Hanseatic Cities\n* Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel and then Electorate of Hesse at Darmstadt see Hesse-Cassel\n* Elector of Brandenburg and to the Kingdom of Prussia at Berlin see Prussia\n* Electorate of Saxony at Dresden see Saxony\n* Kingdom of Württemberg at Stuttgart see Württemberg\n* Other German States see other German states\nList of heads of mission\nGerman Confederation\nEnvoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary\n*1817–1824: Hon.
