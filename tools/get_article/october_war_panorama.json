The painters of the murals featured in the galleries are said to have used real soldiers and veterans as models for their work and had spent extended periods of time in the locations depicted in the paintings.\nVarious paintings depict the history of Syria, which are a mix of Arab and Syrian nationalism. These include a commemoration of the third millennium BC Syrian kingdom of Ebla, Queen Zenobia of Palmyra consulting her senate, Al-Walid I flanked by Musa bin Nusayr and Tariq Ibn Ziyad, and the last painting showcasing Saladin in Jerusalem flanked by vanquished crusaders.\n3D panorama\nThe main part of the museum is the 3D panorama. The viewer is seated on a rotating platform, submerged in a depiction of the battle for Quneitra in the Golan Heights, while pre-recorded narrations of the war and the battle play through speakers.\nSee also\n* 6th of October Panorama\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mod.gov.sy/index.php?node=554&cat=733 Syrian Ministry of Defense - October Liberation War Panorama (in Arabic)]"
