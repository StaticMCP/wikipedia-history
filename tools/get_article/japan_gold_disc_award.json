The grand prize is \"Artist of the Year,\" awarded to the artist with the highest total net sales during the period.\nFrom the 20th edition, video sales were included in the \"Artist of the Year\" award from the 22nd edition, and digital music sales were included.\nEligible period\nThe eligible period was one year from January 21 of the previous year, from the 1st edition (1987) to the 13th edition (1999), but was extended by 11 days for the 14th edition (2000). Also, from the 15th edition (2001) to the 17th edition (2003), it was one year from February 1 of the previous year. Still, the 18th edition was changed to January 1 to December 31 of the previous year. Therefore, the winning works from the 17th award were not eligible for the 18th award, even if they were released during the eligible period (works released between January 1 and January 31, 2003, which overlapped the period of the 17th and 18th awards). The one-year eligible period was shortened to 10 months for the 25th edition (2011). For the 26th edition (2012) and 27th edition (2013), it was changed to one year (12 months) from November 1 of the year before. However, the 28th edition (2014) changed the period to 14 months. From the 29th edition (2015), the period was changed again to one year from January 1 of the previous year.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Eligible Period\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1–13\n| 1987–1999\n| January 21 of the previous year – January 20 of the ceremony year\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 14\n| 2000\n| January 21, 1999 – January 31, 2000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 15–17\n| 2001–2003\n| February 1 of the previous year – January 31 of the ceremony year\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 18–24\n| 2004–2010\n| January 1 – December 31 of the previous year\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 25\n| 2011\n| January 1 – October 31, 2010\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 26\n| 2012\n| November 1, 2010 – October 31, 2011\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 27\n| 2013\n| November 1, 2011 – October 31, 2012\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 28\n| 2014\n| November 1, 2012 – December 31, 2013\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 29\n| 2015–present\n| January 1 – December 31 of the previous year\n|}\nCategories\n*Artist of the Year\n*New Artist of the Year\n*Best Enka/Kayokyoku Artist\n*Best Enka/Kayokyoku New Artist\n*Single of the Year\n*Song of the Year by Download\n*Song of the Year by Streaming\n*Album of the Year\n*Enka/Kayokyoku Album of the Year\n*Classic Album of the Year\n*Jazz Album of the Year\n*Instrumental Album of the Year\n*Soundtrack Album of the Year\n*Animation Album of the Year\n*Traditional Japanese Music Album of the Year\n*Concept Album of the Year\n*Music Video of the Year\n*Special Award\n*Best Asian Artist\nArtists of the Year\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Japan\n! scope=\"col\" | International\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n|1||1987||Akina Nakamori||Madonna\n|\n|-\n|2||1988||Rebecca||The Beatles\n|\n|-\n|3||1989||Boøwy||Bon Jovi\n|\n|-\n|4||1990||Southern All Stars|| rowspan=\"2\" |Madonna\n|\n|-\n|5||1991||Yumi Matsutoya\n|\n|-\n|6||1992|| rowspan=\"2\" |Chage and Aska||Guns N' Roses\n|\n|-\n|7||1993||Madonna\n|\n|-\n|8||1994||Wands||The Beatles\n|\n|-\n|9||1995|| rowspan=\"2\" |TRF|| rowspan=\"2\" |Mariah Carey\n|\n|-\n|10||1996\n|\n|-\n|11||1997||Namie Amuro||Me & My\n|\n|-\n|12||1998||Glay|| rowspan=\"3\" |Celine Dion\n|\n|-\n|13||1999||B'z\n|\n|-\n|14||2000||Hikaru Utada\n|\n|-\n|15||2001|| rowspan=\"2\" |Ayumi Hamasaki||The Beatles\n|\n|-\n|16||2002||Backstreet Boys\n|\n|-\n|17||2003||Hikaru Utada||Avril Lavigne\n|\n|-\n|18||2004||Ayumi Hamasaki||Twelve Girls Band\n|\n|-\n|19||2005||Orange Range||Queen\n|\n|-\n|20||2006|| rowspan=\"2\" |Kumi Koda||O-Zone\n|\n|-\n|21||2007||Daniel Powter\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|22||2008|| rowspan=\"2\" |Exile||Avril Lavigne\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|23||2009||Madonna\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|24||2010|| rowspan=\"2\" |Arashi||The Beatles\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|25||2011|| rowspan=\"2\" |Lady Gaga\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|26||2012|| rowspan=\"3\" |AKB48\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|27||2013||Che'Nelle\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|28||2014|| rowspan=\"2\" |One Direction\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|29||2015|| rowspan=\"3\" |Arashi\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|30||2016||The Beatles\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|31||2017||Ariana Grande\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|32||2018|| rowspan=\"2\" |Namie Amuro||The Beatles\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|33||2019||rowspan=\"3\" |Queen\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|34||2020||rowspan=\"2\" |Arashi\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|35||2021\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|36||2022|| rowspan=\"3\" |Snow Man|| rowspan=\"3\" |The Beatles\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|37||2023\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|38||2024\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|39||2025||Mrs. Green Apple||Taylor Swift\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|}\nBroadcast\nThe first event was not broadcast on television. The first broadcast live was in 1990 (4th edition) on Nippon Television's \"Saturday Super Special\".\nThe following year, in 1991, it began to be broadcast live on NHK General TV, and the year after that, in 1992, it was broadcast publicly at the NHK Hall. Later, it was also broadcast on Satellite TV 2 (BS2). BS2 began broadcasting live, and the broadcast on General TV was a re-edited recording. Also, from 2003, the broadcast on BS2 was changed to a live broadcast recording on the same day. Until then, NHK News 7 had replaced Satellite TV 1 (BS1) and was broadcast.\nThe 20th anniversary of the NHK's founding, the NHK Hall, was held in 2006, on Thursday, March 9, from 7:00 PM, and was broadcast live on Satellite Channel 2 (7:30 PM - 9:30 PM). A recording was also broadcast on General TV. Still, the original broadcast on Friday, March 17 was postponed to Thursday, March 23 ( 12:15 AM - 1:25 AM, March 24) due to the decision to broadcast a recording of the National Diet session (164th Diet, House of Representatives General Affairs Committee, FY2006 NHK Business Budget Deliberations) (11:00 PM - 4:00 AM, March 18), which has the highest legal priority.\nIn 2006 (the 21st edition), 2007 (the 22nd edition), 2009 (the 24th edition), and 2010 (the 25th edition), the award press conferences were held at hotels in Tokyo. There were no public audiences, live performances by artists, or television coverage. The press conferences were broadcast as news footage on the variety shows of various stations the following day.\nThe 2008 (23rd edition) event was held at Tokyo International Forum Hall C on March 2, 2009. It was broadcast live by Tokyo FM and on March 10 by Wowow.\nThe 2011 (26th edition) event was held at Nicofarre on January 27, 2012, and a digest of the event was broadcast on BS Sky PerfecTV! from 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM on March 2.\nPress conferences have been abolished since 2012 (the 27th edition). Instead, the organizers have edited the winners' comments and broadcast them as videos. These have also not been held since 2014 (the 29th edition).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
