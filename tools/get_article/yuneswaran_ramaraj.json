Yuneswaran is a Malaysian politician who has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Segamat since November 2022. He is a member of the People's Justice Party (PKR), a component party of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition.\nEarly years\nHe grew up in the Klang Valley and attended Sin Min Chinese School in Sungai Besar, Selangor before completing secondary school at SMK Desa Cemerlang (Ulu Tiram), Johor. He eventually obtained an MBA through the Anglia Ruskin University.\nHe joined PKR in 2008 and was the first person to be prosecuted under the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012 for organising the Blackout 505 rally in Johor in 2013. In 2018 he served as campaign manager for Edmund Santhara who managed to wrest the seat from Barisan Nasional for the first time.\nAfter Santhara defected, Yuneswaran was selected by PKR and he won in the 2022 General election by a comfortable majority of 5,669  votes over MIC’s M Ramasamy, with Perikatan Nasional’s P Poobalan trailing in third.\nOn 3 April 2023, the election court in Muar dismissed Ramasamy’s election petition challenging Yuneswaran’s victory. However on 18 August 2023, the Federal Court today set aside the verdict and allowed Ramasamy's appeal to send back his Segamat election petition to the Election Court for a full hearing.\nEventually, on 8 November 2023, Election Court judge Rohani Ismail allowed Ramasamy’s application to discontinue the petition.\nFollowing his election Yuneswaran called for flood mitigation and transport infrastructure upgrades in northern Johor to be made a priority. He also backed electoral reforms calling for proportional representation in the Dewan Rakyat and the elections for municipal councils and the Dewan Negara.\nElection result\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ Parliament of Malaysia\n!|Year\n!|Constituency\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!colspan=2|Opponent(s)\n!|Votes\n!|Pct\n!|Ballots cast\n!|Majority\n!|Turnout\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2022\n| rowspan=\"3\" | P140 Segamat\n| rowspan=\"3\"  |\n| rowspan=\"3\" | (PKR)\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | 23,437\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 46.27%\n|  |\n| Ramasamy Muthusamy (MIC)\n| align=\"right\" | 17,768\n| 35.08%\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 50,652\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 5,669\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 73.03%\n|-\n| bgcolor= |\n| Poobalan Ponusamy\t(BERSATU)\n| align=\"right\" | 8,385\n| 16.55%\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Syed Hairoul Faizey Syed Ali (PUTRA)\n| align=\"right\" | 1,062\n| 2.10%\n|}\nHonours\nHonours of Malaysia\n*\n**  Recipient of the 17th Yang di-Pertuan Agong Installation Medal (2024)\nReferences"
