The film is scored by the recurring franchise collaborator James Newton Howard. It was released on November 23, 2015 through Republic Records, complimenting Howard's original score and the song \"Deep in the Meadow\" performed by Jennifer Lawrence that originally appeared in the predecessor, and again re-appeared in the film's end credits. In the album, it is accompanied by two suite pieces: \"There Are Worse Games to Play\" and the Hunger Games suite as a medley. A remixed version of the song, produced by Baauer was later unveiled separately. Unlike the predecessors, there is no additional pop companion album inspired by the film.\nTrack listing\nReception\nFilmtracks.com commented that Howard's music for The Hunger Games series started with lament in the first instalment, drama in the second and expanded to full action in the third instalment, with the score for Mockingjay – Part 2 \"meanders between all three in this entry\". The review, although concerned with the highlights emulating Howard's score for The Last Airbender (2010), complimented that it provides a \"noble send-off\" to the musical franchise giving four stars to the album. Marcy Donelson of AllMusic commented the score as \"quietly tense, wistful, and explosive\".\nRichard Lawson of Vanity Fair called the score as \"alternately piercing and rousing\", while John Anderson of Time called the score as \"moody\". Peter Debruge of Variety wrote Howard's score fluctuates from \"soap-opera-style piano accents to full-blown action-movie bombast\" while at moments becomes downright vital at the \"film's claustrophobic sequence\" where Katniss' squad battles head-to-head with the mutants at sewer system.\nPersonnel credits\nCredits adapted from CD liner notes:\n* Music composer and producer – James Newton Howard\n* Co-producer – Jim Weidman, Sven Faulconer\n* Engineer – Johnny Traunwieser\n* Additional arrangements – Sven Faulconer\n* Synth programming – Sven Faulconer, Christopher Wray\n* Recording – Shawn Murphy\n* Mixing – Erik Swanson, Shawn Murphy\n* Mastering – Dave Collins\n* Music editor – David Olson\n* Supervising music editor – Jim Weidman\n* Score editor – David Channing\n* Assistant score editor – Carlos Mosquera\n* Auricle control systems – Chris Cozens, Richard Grant\n* Music co-ordinator – Rona Rapadas\n* Scoring co-ordinator – Pamela Sollie\n* Creative director – Giancarlo Pacheco, Sandra Brummels\n* Scoring crew – George Oulton, Jon Alexander, Lewis Jones, Matt Jones\n* Music preparation – Joann Kane Music Service\n* Music librarian – Mark Graham\n* Packaging and design – Jessica Kelly\n;
