It took place at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California, where 28 awards were presented. The nominations were announced on July 16, 2009.\nOn July 13, 2009, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced that Neil Patrick Harris would host the Primetime ceremony (even going so far as to play Dr. Horrible at one point). The Creative Arts Emmy Awards for prime time were hosted by Kathy Griffin on September 12.\nAfter the previous year's lackluster performance in ratings, the Primetime Emmy Awards were hoping to achieve success by selecting Harris as sole host, as opposed to a group of hosts as in the previous year. The 61st Primetime Emmy Awards earned a 4.2 rating in the 18–49 demo and drew 13.3 million, 1.1 million more than the previous year's all-time low.\n30 Rock became the sixth show to win Outstanding Comedy Series three consecutive years, winning three major awards on that night. 30 Rock made history when it smashed the record for most major nominations by a comedy series with 18. The Cosby Show had held the record of 13 since 1986, while 30 Rock had tied this the previous year. The 18 major nominations became the third biggest record of all time, behind Roots record number of 21 in 1977 and NYPD Blues mark of 19 in 1994. These records still stand.\nThe drama field also crowned the defending champion, AMC's Mad Men. It won two major awards on that night. After airing for fifteen seasons, ER went out a winner as its series finale won for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. This was the first major win for ER since 2001.\nCherry Jones became the first from a Fox network show to win the award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama series but also the second woman ever from Fox to win a Major Acting award since Gillian Anderson in 1997.\nHistory was also made by The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Amazing Race. Both programs won their series categories for the seventh straight year, this broke the record for most consecutive victories in a major category of six that was held by The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Cagney & Lacey. The Amazing Race would lose the following year. However, in 2013, The Daily Shows streak was finally snapped by The Colbert Report, after a record of ten consecutive wins.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold:\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* '30 Rock (NBC)'\n** Entourage (HBO)\n** Family Guy (Fox)\n** Flight of the Conchords (HBO)\n** How I Met Your Mother (CBS)\n** The Office (NBC)\n** Weeds (Showtime)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Mad Men (AMC)'\n** Big Love (HBO)\n** Breaking Bad (AMC)\n** Damages (FX)\n** Dexter (Showtime)\n** House (Fox)\n** Lost (ABC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Grey Gardens (HBO)'\n** Coco Chanel (Lifetime)\n** Into the Storm (HBO)\n** Prayers for Bobby (Lifetime)\n** Taking Chance (HBO)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Little Dorrit (PBS)'\n** Generation Kill (HBO)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Comedy Central)'\n** The Colbert Report (Comedy Central)\n** Late Show with David Letterman (CBS)\n** Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO)\n** Saturday Night Live (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Amazing Race (CBS)'\n** American Idol (Fox)\n** Dancing with the Stars (ABC)\n** Project Runway (Bravo)\n** Top Chef (Bravo)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Alec Baldwin – 30 Rock as Jack Donaghy (NBC)'\n** Steve Carell – The Office as Michael Scott (NBC)\n** Jemaine Clement – Flight of the Conchords as Jemaine (HBO)\n** Jim Parsons – The Big Bang Theory as Dr. Sheldon Cooper (CBS)\n** Tony Shalhoub – Monk as Adrian Monk (USA)\n** Charlie Sheen – Two and a Half Men as Charlie Harper (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Toni Collette – United States of Tara as Tara Gregson (Showtime)'\n** Christina Applegate – Samantha Who? as Samantha Newly (ABC)\n** Tina Fey – 30 Rock as Liz Lemon (NBC)\n** Julia Louis-Dreyfus – The New Adventures of Old Christine as Christine Campbell (CBS)\n** Mary-Louise Parker – Weeds as Nancy Botwin (Showtime)\n** Sarah Silverman – The Sarah Silverman Program as herself (Comedy Central)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Bryan Cranston – Breaking Bad as Walter White (AMC)'\n** Simon Baker – The Mentalist as Patrick Jane (CBS)\n** Gabriel Byrne – In Treatment as Dr. Paul Weston (HBO)\n** Michael C.
