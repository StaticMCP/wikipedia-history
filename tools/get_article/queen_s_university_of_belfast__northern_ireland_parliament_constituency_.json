It returned four MPs, using proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. In 1969 the constituency was abolished under the reforms carried out by the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Terence O'Neill.\nFranchise\nThe constituency was created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and its four MPs were elected by the graduates of Queen's University of Belfast.\nSecond Dáil\nIn May 1921, Dáil Éireann, the parliament of the self-declared Irish Republic run by Sinn Féin, passed a resolution declaring that elections to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland would be used as the election for the Second Dáil. All those elected were on the roll of the Second Dáil, but as no Sinn Féin MP was elected for Queen's University, it was not represented there.\nMembers of Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Election\n!Member\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Member\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Member\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Member\n!colspan=2|Party\n|-\n| MPs (1921)\n|John Campbell\n|\n|rowspan=3|John Hanna Robb\n|rowspan=3 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=3 |\n|rowspan=4|Robert James Johnstone\n|rowspan=4 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=4 |\n|Hugh Morrison\n|\n|-\n| MPs (1929)\n|rowspan=5|Robert Corkey\n|rowspan=5 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=5 |\n|Robert McNeill\n|\n|-\n| MPs (1935)\n|rowspan=3|Arthur Brownlow Mitchell\n|rowspan=3 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=3 |\n|-\n| MPs (1938)\n|rowspan=4|John MacDermott\n|rowspan=4 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=4 |\n|-\n| MPs(1938)\n|rowspan=6|Howard Stevenson\n|rowspan=6 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=6 |\n|-\n| MPs(1942)\n|rowspan=3|William Lyle\n|rowspan=3 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=3 |\n|-\n| MPs(1943)\n|rowspan=2|John W.
