It was originally released as part of the seven-CD box set ''Lightnin' Hopkins: The Complete Prestige/Bluesville Recordings'', in 1991, before being reissued on Bluesville as a single CD in 1993.\nReception\n|rev2 = The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings\n|rev2score  =\n}}\nAllMusic reviewer Cub Koda stated: \"this languished unissued in Fantasy Records' vaults until its release in the early '90s. That's a shame, because this concert captures Lightnin' at his beguiling best, spinning tales and blues magic with every track. ... If you want a disc that clearly showcases Lightnin' Hopkins at his enchanting best, start your collection with this one; it's a charmer\".\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Sam \"Lightnin'\" Hopkins except where noted\n# \"Baby, Please Don't Go\" (Traditional ) – 2:09\n# \"My Black Cadillac\" – 1:44\n# \"It's Crazy\" – 2:32\n# \"Mojo Hand\" – 3:02\n# \"My Babe\" (Willie Dixon) – 2:20\n# \"Short Haired Woman\" – 3:52\n# \"Mean Old Frisco\" (Arthur Crudup) – 1:53\n# \"Trouble in Mind\" (Richard M.
