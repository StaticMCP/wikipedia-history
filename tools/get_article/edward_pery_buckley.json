He married Lady Catherine Pleydell-Bouverie, daughter of William Pleydell-Bouverie, 3rd Earl of Radnor and Lady Catherine Pelham-Clinton, in 1828, and together they had six children: Frances Gertrude (died 1921); Alfred (1829–1900); Edward William (1829–1840); Duncombe Frederick (1831–1855); Felix John (1834–1911); and Victor (1838–1882).\nMilitary career\nBuckley joined the British Army on 24 June 1812, becoming an ensign in the 1st Foot Guards. With the Napoleonic Wars underway, he served with his regiment in the Peninsular War. Buckley first saw action at the Battle of the Bidassoa on 7 October 1813, and afterwards at the Battle of Nivelle on 10 November and Battle of the Nive in December. Buckley was promoted to lieutenant and captain on 23 March 1814. He then served at the Battle of Bayonne on 14 April, and was later awarded the Military General Service Medal for Nivelle and the Nive.\nBuckley subsequently saw service in Belgium during the Hundred Days, fighting at the Battle of Quatre Bras and the Battle of Waterloo. He continued in the army after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, being promoted to brevet major on 19 July 1821. He was then advanced to lieutenant-colonel, unattached from any regiment, on 26 September 1826. Buckley went on half pay on 9 November 1830; while he saw no further active service he continued to be promoted by seniority. He became a brevet colonel on 23 November 1841, and was the promoted to major-general on 11 November 1851, lieutenant-general on 26 October 1858, and general on 17 August 1865. Alongside his last promotion he was appointed colonel of the regiment to the 83rd Regiment of Foot.\nPolitical career\nBuckley was first elected Whig member of parliament for Salisbury at a by-election in 1853, caused by the death of Charles Baring Wall. He became a Liberal in 1859 and held the seat until the 1865 general election, when he did not seek re-election.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
