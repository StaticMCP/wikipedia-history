It is intended for use by Indian Armed Forces, paramilitary units, and special forces, particularly in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations. The rifle is notable for its fully indigenous design, aiming to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers and align with the \"Atmanirbhar Bharat\" initiative.\nReferences"
