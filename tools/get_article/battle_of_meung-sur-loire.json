This campaign was the second sustained French offensive in a generation in the Hundred Years' War.\nBackground\nMeung-sur-Loire (now in Loiret) was a small town on the northern bank of the Loire river in central France, slightly west of Orléans.  It controlled a bridge of strategic significance during the latter part of the war.  Captured by the English a few years earlier as a staging point for a planned invasion of southern France, the French offensive recaptured the bridge and hampered English movement south of the river during the campaign.\nThe French Loire Campaign of 1429 consisted of five actions:\n:1. The Siege of Orléans.\n:2. The Battle of Jargeau.\n:3. The Battle of Meung-sur-Loire.\n:4. The Battle of Beaugency.\n:5. The Battle of Patay.\nVirtually all of France north of the Loire had fallen to foreign occupation by the end of 1428.  The bridge at Orléans had been destroyed shortly before the siege lifted. The French had lost control of all other river crossings.  Three swift and numerically small battles at Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency demonstrated renewed French confidence and laid the groundwork for subsequent French offenses on Rheims and Paris.  The Loire campaign killed, captured, or disgraced a majority of the top tier of English commanders and decimated the numbers of the highly skilled English longbowmen.\nTactics\nEnglish defenses at Meung-sur-Loire consisted of three components: the walled town, the fortification at the bridge, and a large walled castle just outside the town.  The castle served as headquarters to the English command of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Thomas Scales.\nJoan of Arc and Duke John II of Alençon controlled a force that included captains Jean d'Orléans, Gilles de Rais, Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, and La Hire.  Estimates of numerical strength vary with the ''Journal du Siège d'Orléans citing 6,000 – 7,000  for the French.  A number that large probably counts non-combatants.  Bypassing the city and the castle, they staged a frontal assault on the bridge fortifications, conquered it in one day, and installed a garrison.  This hampered English movement south of the Loire.\nSee also\n*Medieval warfare\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Devries, Kelly.
