Later, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the city and region's reputation as a central manufacturing location during the American Industrial Revolution attracted a second wave of German and other European immigrants who sought economic opportunity and jobs afforded by its anthracite coal, iron ore, steel, railroad, and other manufacturing and mining industries.\nHistory\nAmerican Revolution\nat 622 Hamilton Street in Center City Allentown, where the Liberty Bell was hidden from the British for nine months during the occupation of Philadelphia from September 1777 to June 1778]]\nAllentown's influential role in support of the American Revolution and Revolutionary War is celebrated in the city with various museums and memorials. Until 2023, the Liberty Bell Museum inside Zion Reformed Church at 622 West Hamilton Street in Allentown honored the role Allentown played in protecting and concealing the Liberty Bell, which was hidden underneath this Allentown church's floor boards from September 1777 to June 1778 during the British Army's occupation of Philadelphia.
