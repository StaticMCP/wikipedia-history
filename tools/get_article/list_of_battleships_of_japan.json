Previously, the Empire of Japan had acquired a few ironclad warships from foreign builders, although it had adopted the  naval doctrine which emphasized cheap torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive, heavily armored ships. To counter the Beiyang Fleet of Imperial China in the early 1890s, however, Japan ordered two s from Great Britain as Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own vessels. Combat experience in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 convinced the IJN that its doctrine was untenable, leading to a ten-year naval construction program that called for a total of six battleships and six armored cruisers (the Six-Six Fleet). The two ships of the  and the battleships  and  were also purchased from Great Britain. Aware that they could not outbuild the Americans or British, the IJN decided that their ships would always be qualitatively superior to offset their quantitative inferiority.\nTo counter reinforcement of the Russian Empire's Pacific Squadron as tensions rose between the Russians and the Japanese over control of Korea and Manchuria in the early 1900s, Japan ordered the two battleships of the  in 1903, the last battleships ordered from abroad. To preempt further reinforcements before their own ships were completed, they began the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 with a surprise attack on the Russian base at Port Arthur. Shortly after the war began, the IJN ordered the two ships of the , the first battleships to be built in Japan. The Imperial Japanese Army captured Port Arthur, along with the surviving ships of the Pacific Squadron by the end of the year. The Russians had dispatched the bulk of their Baltic Fleet to relieve Port Arthur, which reached the Korea Strait in May 1905 and was virtually annihilated by the IJN in the Battle of Tsushima. During the war, Japan captured a total of five Russian pre-dreadnought battleships. They were repaired and commissioned into the Japanese fleet, and two were later sold back to Russia during World War I, as Japan and Russia were by then allies. The magnitude of the victory at Tsushima caused the leadership of the IJN to believe that a surface engagement between the main fleets was the only decisive battle in modern warfare and would be decided by battleships armed with the largest guns.\nAfter the war, the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean, Britain and the United States, believing that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals. Accordingly, the 1907 Imperial Defense Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships and eight battlecruisers. This was the genesis of the Eight-Eight Fleet Program, the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships. The launch of  in 1906 and the battlecruiser  the following year by the Royal Navy raised the stakes and complicated Japan's plans as they rendered all existing battleships and armored cruisers obsolete, forcing Japan to restart the Eight-Eight plan with dreadnought battleships and battlecruisers. This began with the  in 1907, followed by the  and es in the 1910s. Japan ordered its seventh and eighth dreadnoughts with the  in 1916 and 1917.\nIn 1919, American president Woodrow Wilson announced the resumption of the 1916 naval construction program and the Japanese ordered eight fast battleships of the  and es in response. The prospect of a new massively expensive arms race between the United States, Britain and Japan after the war caused the three powers to agree to the Washington Naval Treaty which limited Japan to a ratio of 3:5:5 in battleship tonnage to the United States and Britain. The treaty forced the IJN to dispose of all of its pre-dreadnoughts and the oldest dreadnoughts; the ships then under construction had to be broken up or sunk as targets. Furthermore, the treaty mandated a building holiday that barred the construction of new battleships for ten years. During this period, opponents of the Washington Naval Treaty and its successors had taken control of the upper echelons of the IJN and rebuilt the s into fast battleships and modernized the existing ships. Coupled with the growth of ultranationalism and dominance of the government by the military, the government decided to withdraw from the treaty regime when it expired in 1936. Planning by the Navy General Staff for the post-treaty era began in 1934 and included five large battleships armed with nine  guns; these ships became the . While the Yamatos were under construction in the late 1930s, the IJN began designing a successor class, the Design A-150 armed with  guns, but never laid any down as they prepared for war and other ships had higher priority.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\"\n|+ Key\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Armament\n| The number and type of the primary armament\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Armor\n| The thickness of the belt armor\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Displacement\n| Ship displacement at normal load\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Propulsion\n| Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and designed speed\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Service\n| The dates work on the ship began and finished and its ultimate fate\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Laid down\n| The date the keel began to be assembled\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Commissioned/Captured\n| The date the ship was commissioned or captured\n|}\n}}\nPre-dreadnoughts\nFuji class\nThe two  ships,  and , were the IJN's first battleships, ordered from Britain in response to two new German-built Chinese ironclad warships. The ships were designed as smaller versions of the British , although they were slightly faster and had a better type of armor.\nAs part of the 1st Fleet the Fujis participated in fighting off Port Arthur on 9–10 March 1904, wherein Fuji sustained light damage and Yashima was undamaged. On 15 May Yashima struck two naval mines and foundered. Fuji participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August and was then slightly damaged during the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. She was credited with the shot that caused the magazine explosion that destroyed the battleship . In October 1908, Fuji hosted the American ambassador to Japan and some senior officers of the Great White Fleet, and was later reclassified as a coast defense ship in 1910. The ship was disarmed and converted into an accommodation ship in 1922. Fuji was sunk by American aircraft in 1945 and scrapped in 1948.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2 × twin\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2 shafts, 2 triple-expansion steam engines,\n|1 August 1894\n|17 August 1897\n|Broken up, 1948\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n|6 December 1894\n|9 September 1897\n|Sank after striking a mine, 15 May 1904\n|}\nShikishima class\nThe  was designed as a more powerful version of the Royal Navy's  battleship.

Shikishima fought in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, only being damaged by a misfiring 12-inch shell, and then participated in the Battle of Tsushima where she was hit nine times, suffered another misfire from one of her main guns, and, together with the battleship , sank the Russian battleship . Shikishima spent the duration of World War I assigned to the Sasebo Naval District, and was demilitarized after the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922. She was used as a training hulk at Sasebo until she was broken up in 1948.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2 × twin 12&nbsp;in guns\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2 shafts, 2 triple-expansion steam engines,\n|29 March 1897\n|26 January 1900\n|Broken up, January 1948\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n|10 January 1898\n|18 January 1901\n|Sank 15 May 1904, after striking two mines\n|}\nAsahi\nAsahi was a slightly improved version of the British s. She became the flagship of the IJN's Standing Fleet and was later assigned to the 1st Fleet when the Combined Fleet reformed in 1903. At the start of the Russo–Japanese War, Asahi took part in the Battle of Port Arthur and was not damaged by Russian fire. At the Battle of the Yellow Sea, the ship was moderately damaged, although she hit and damaged  and  in return. Asahi struck a mine two months later near Port Arthur, but was repaired in time for the Battle of Tsushima. There, she helped disable the battleship  and dueled with the battleships Borodino and , taking no damage.\nShe was a gunnery training ship for most of World War I until being rearmed in 1917 in time to escort troop transports during Japan's intervention in the Russian Civil War. Asahi was converted into a noncombat vessel during the 1920s and was then made a repair ship in 1937. On the night of 25–26 May 1942, Asahi was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine  off modern-day Vietnam.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 2 × twin 12&nbsp;in guns\n| 9&nbsp;in\n|\n| 2 shafts, 2 triple-expansion steam engines,18&nbsp;knots\n| 1 August 1897\n| 31 July 1900\n| Sunk by , 25–26 May 1942\n|}\nMikasa\nMikasa was also an improved version of the Formidable-class battleships and only differed in minor respects from Asahi. The ship served as the 1st Fleet flagship throughout the Russo-Japanese War. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war and the Battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima. During the latter battle, the ship was hit many times, but was only lightly damaged. Days after the end of the war, Mikasas magazine accidentally exploded and sank the ship. She was salvaged and her repairs took over two years to complete. Afterward, the ship served as a coast-defense ship during World War I and supported Japanese forces when they intervened in the Russian Civil War. After the Washington Naval Treaty was ratified in 1922 Mikasa was preserved as a museum ship. She was badly neglected during the post–World War II occupation of Japan and required extensive refurbishing in the late 1950s, but has only partially been restored. Mikasa is the only surviving example of a pre-dreadnought battleship in the world.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 2 × twin 12&nbsp;in guns\n| 9&nbsp;in\n|\n| 2 shafts, 2 triple-expansion steam engines,18&nbsp;knots\n| 24 January 1899\n| 1 March 1902\n| Preserved as a museum ship\n|}\nTango\nTango was laid down as the Russian battleship Poltava (), the second of three  pre-dreadnought battleships. The ship was assigned to the Pacific Squadron shortly after her completion and based at Port Arthur from 1901. During the Russo-Japanese War, she participated in the Battle of Port Arthur and was heavily damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Sunk by Japanese artillery during the subsequent Siege of Port Arthur in December 1904, she was refloated by the IJN after the war and subsequently renamed Tango. During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications during the Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese government sold Tango back to the Russians in 1916. She was renamed Chesma () as her former name had been given to a new ship. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917, but saw no action in the Russian Civil War owing to her poor condition, and she was ultimately scrapped in 1924.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Captured\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 4 × 12&nbsp;in guns\n|  Krupp armor\n|\n| 2 shafts, 2 triple-expansion steam engines,\n| 19 May 1892\n| 2 January 1905\n| Returned to Russia, 1916, scrapped, 1924\n|}\nSagami and Suwo\nSagami and Suwo were originally the Russian  battleships  () and  () respectively. The design of the Peresvet class was inspired by the British second-class battleships of the . The British ships were intended to defeat commerce-raiding armored cruisers like the Russian ships  and , and the Peresvet class was designed to support their armored cruisers.\nThe sisters were sunk during the Siege of Port Arthur and were salvaged by the IJN afterward. Because of their lighter armament than the other captured battleships, they were rated as coastal-defense ships. During World War I, Suwo was the flagship of the Japanese squadron during the Siege of Tsingtao and then of the 2nd Fleet before becoming a gunnery-training ship in 1916. Sagami was sold back to the Russians that same year and resumed her former name. While en route to northern Russia, the ship struck two mines in the Mediterranean and sank. Suwo was disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and was probably scrapped afterward.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Captured\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2 × twin\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 9&nbsp;in\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2 shafts, 2 triple-expansion steam engines,18 knots\n| 21 November 1895\n| 2 January 1905\n| Sunk by a mine off Port Said, Egypt, 4 January 1917\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n|\n| 21 February 1899\n| 2 January 1905\n| Probably scrapped, 1922–1923\n|}\nHizen\nHizen, originally Retvizan (), was a Russian pre-dreadnought battleship built in America before the Russo-Japanese War because Russian shipyards were already at full capacity. The ship was torpedoed during the Battle of Port Arthur, but was repaired in time to participate in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, during which she was lightly damaged. She was sunk during the Siege of Port Arthur and salvaged by the IJN. During World War I, Hizen was sent to reinforce the weak British squadron off British Columbia, but diverted to Hawaii after reports of a German gunboat there were received. The ship was unsuccessfully sent to search for other German ships after the Americans interned the gunboat in November 1914. After the war she supported the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War and was disarmed in 1922 as required by the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Hizen was sunk as a target in 1924.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Captured\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 2 × twin 12&nbsp;in guns\n| 9&nbsp;in\n|\n| 2 shafts, 2 triple-expansion steam engines,18&nbsp;knots\n| 29 July 1899\n| 2 January 1905\n| Sunk as a target ship, 25 July 1924\n|}\nIwami\nIwami was built shortly before the Russo-Japanese War for the Imperial Russian Navy as Oryol (), one of five s. Together with three of her sisters, she voyaged half-way around the world to participate in the Battle of Tsushima. Moderately damaged during the battle, the ship was surrendered to the IJN the following day. The Japanese rebuilt her from 1905 to 1907 and she was assigned to the 1st Fleet, although the ship was reclassified as a coast defense ship in 1912. Iwami participated in the Siege of Tsingtao in 1914 after Japan declared war on Imperial Germany and then became a guardship. She became the flagship of the 5th Division of the 3rd Fleet in 1918 and supported the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War. Iwami briefly became a training ship before she was disarmed in 1922 and was sunk as a target two years later.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Captured\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 2 × twin 12&nbsp;in guns\n|\n|\n| 2 shafts, 2 triple-expansion steam engines,18&nbsp;knots\n| 1 June 1900\n| 28 May 1905\n| Sunk as a target ship, 10 July 1924\n|}\nKatori class\nThe pair of Katori-class pre-dreadnoughts were the last Japanese battleships to be built overseas. The design of the Katori class was a modified and improved version of the Royal Navy's  battleships. Completed after the end of the Russo–Japanese War, the ships never saw combat. Katori had a major fire in one of her secondary-gun turrets in 1907 that killed 34 men and wounded 8 others. While they saw no action during World War I, they both participated in Japan's intervention in Siberia in 1918. In 1921, the sisters carried Crown Prince Hirohito on his tour of Europe where he met King George V. Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, both ships were disarmed and scrapped between 1923 and 1925.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2 × twin 12&nbsp;in guns\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 9&nbsp;in\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2 shafts, 2 triple-expansion steam engines,18&nbsp;knots\n| 27 April 1904\n| 20 May 1906\n| Sold for scrap, April 1924\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n|\n| 29 February 1904\n| 23 May 1906\n| Broken up, 1924–1925\n|}\nSatsuma class\nThe Satsuma-class battleships, Satsuma and Aki, were the first battleships to be built in Japan. They marked a transitional stage in battleship design, as the sisters were intended to mount a dozen  guns. Material shortages in Japan and the expense of construction led to a redesign that armed the sisters with four 12-inch and a dozen  guns. If built as planned, the Satsuma class would have been the world's first \"all big-gun\" battleships. Satsuma was powered traditionally with two vertical triple-expansion engines, but Aki was the first Japanese battleship to use steam turbines.\nThe introduction of  in 1906 ensured that the Satsuma class was obsolete before the ships were even launched. Nevertheless, Aki was launched on 15 November, while Satsuma followed on 15 April 1907. Satsuma would go on to serve as Rear Admiral Tatsuo Matsumura's flagship in the Second South Seas Squadron as it seized the German possessions of the Caroline and the Palau Islands in October 1914 in the opening months of World War I. Satsuma would later be refitted at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in 1916 and served with the 1st Squadron for the rest of the war. Aki was also assigned to the 1st Squadron until she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Squadron in 1918. Both ships were sunk as targets by  and  in 1924.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2 × twin 12&nbsp;in guns6 × twin 10&nbsp;in\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|\n| 2 shafts, 2 triple-expansion steam engines,\n| 15 May 1905\n| 25 March 1910\n| Sunk as a target ship, 7 September 1924\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n|\n| 2 shafts, 2 steam turbine sets,\n| 15 March 1906\n| 11 March 1911\n| Sunk as a target ship, 2 September 1924\n|}\nDreadnought battleships\nKawachi class\nThe , Kawachi and Settsu, were a pair of dreadnought battleships ordered in the Navy's Warship Supplement Program after the Russo-Japanese War. They were the IJN's first dreadnoughts and marked one of the first steps in achieving Japan's recently adopted Eight-Eight Fleet Program. The sisters were armed with four 50-caliber 12-inch and eight 45-caliber 12-inch main guns, arranged in the hexagonal layout used by the German dreadnoughts of the  and es. They had originally been designed with a dozen 45-caliber guns, but after the IJN received word that the Royal Navy had adopted the more powerful and expensive 50-caliber guns, it upgraded the four centerline guns to the longer caliber as it could not afford to upgrade all of them.\nSettsu and Kawachi bombarded German fortifications at Tsingtao during the Battle of Tsingtao in 1914, but saw no other combat in World War I. Kawachi sank in 1918 after an explosion in her ammunition magazine with the loss of over 600 officers and crewmen. Settsu was disarmed in 1922 and converted into a target ship. She was heavily damaged in 1945 by American carrier aircraft and eventually beached to avoid sinking. The ship was subsequently scrapped in 1946–1947.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6 × twin 12&nbsp;in guns\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12&nbsp;in\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2 shafts, 2 steam turbines,\n| 1 April 1909\n| 31 March 1912\n| Sunk by magazine explosion, 12 July 1918\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n|\n| 18 January 1909\n| 30 March 1911\n| Scrapped, 1946–1947\n|}\nFusō class\nThe , Fusō and Yamashiro, were a pair of dreadnoughts built for the IJN during World War I. Both patrolled briefly off the coast of China before being placed in reserve at the war's end. Although they were extensively modernized during the 1930s, the sisters were considered obsolescent by the eve of World War II, and neither saw significant action in its early years. Fusō and Yamashiro briefly served as troop transports in 1943, but mostly served as training ships that year. They were the only two Japanese battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944, the southernmost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and were sunk by torpedoes and naval gunfire during the night battle with the loss of almost all of their crews.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6 × twin  guns\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12&nbsp;in\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4 shafts, 4 steam turbines,\n| 11 March 1912\n| 8 November 1915\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Sunk during the Battle of Surigao Strait, 25 October 1944\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 20 November 1913\n| 31 March 1917\n|}\nIse class\nThe  were another pair of dreadnoughts built during World War I. Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. They were modernized in the interwar period with improvements to their armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style. Afterward they played a minor role in the Second Sino-Japanese War.\nDespite the expensive reconstructions, both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War, and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war. Following the loss of most of the IJN's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid-1942, they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes. A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots, however, meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat. While awaiting their air group, the sister ships were occasionally used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases. They participated in the Battle off Cape Engaño in late 1944, where they decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches. Afterward, both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia; in early 1945 they participated in Operation Kita, where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan. The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July. After the war, they were scrapped in 1946–1947.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6 × twin 14&nbsp;in guns\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4 shafts, 4 steam turbines,\n| 10 May 1915\n| 15 December 1917\n| Sunk, 28 July 1945\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 6 May 1915\n| 30 April 1918\n| Sunk, 24 July 1945\n|}\nNagato class\nThe  were the third pair of dreadnoughts built during World War I, although they were not completed until after the end of the war. Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. Modernized during the 1930s, Nagato and her sister ship Mutsu briefly participated in the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and Nagato was the flagship of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 that began the Pacific War.\nThe sisters participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, although they did not see any combat. Mutsu participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August before returning to Japan in early 1943. One of her magazines exploded in June, destroying the ship. Nagato spent most of the first two years of the war training in home waters. She was transferred to Truk in mid-1943, but did not see any combat until the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft. Nagato did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month for repairs. The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her. Nagato was converted into a floating anti-aircraft platform and assigned to coastal defense duties. After the war, the ship was a target for US nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads in mid-1946. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second test.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4 × twin  guns\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12&nbsp;in Vickers cemented armor\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4 shafts, 4 steam turbines,\n| 28 August 1917\n| 25 November 1920\n| Sunk during Operation Crossroads, 29/30 July 1946\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 1 June 1918\n| 24 October 1921\n| Sunk by internal explosion, 8 June 1943\n|}\nTosa class\nThe  were ordered during the early 1920s. They were larger versions of the preceding Nagato class, and carried an additional twin-gun 41&nbsp;cm turret. Both ships were launched in late 1921, but the first ship, , was cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty before she could be completed, and was used in experiments testing the effectiveness of its armor scheme before being scuttled. The hull of the second ship, , was converted into an aircraft carrier to replace an  that had been wrecked by the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923. The carrier supported Japanese troops in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War and took part in the attack on Pearl Harbor and the invasion of Rabaul in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on Darwin, Australia, during the Dutch East Indies campaign. She was sunk during the Battle of Midway in 1942.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 5 × twin 41&nbsp;cm guns\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4 shafts, 4 steam turbines,\n| 16 February 1920\n|\n| Scuttled, 9 February 1925\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 19 July 1920\n| 31 March 1928\n| Converted into an aircraft carrier, sunk during the Battle of Midway, 4 June 1942\n|}\nKii class\nThe Kii-class battleship was a planned class of four fast battleships to be built during the 1920s. Only two of the ships received names. They were intended to reinforce Japan's \"Eight-Eight fleet\" of eight battleships and eight battlecruisers after the United States announced the reinitiation of a major naval construction program in 1919. However, after the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, work on the ships was suspended; one pair was cancelled in November 1923 and the other in April 1924.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | Kii(}})\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 5 × twin 41&nbsp;cm guns\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 4 shafts, 4 steam turbines,\n|\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | Owari(}})\n|\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | No. 11\n|\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | No. 12\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nNumber 13 class\nThe Number 13–class battleship was a planned class of four fast battleships to be built after the Kii class during the 1920s. The ships never received any names, being known only as Numbers 13–16. They were intended to reinforce Japan's \"Eight-Eight Fleet\" of eight battleships and eight battlecruisers after the United States announced the reinitiation of a major naval construction program in 1919. The Number 13 class was designed to be superior to all other existing battleships, planned or building. After the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, they were cancelled in November 1923 before construction could begin.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | No. 13\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 4 × twin  guns\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 4 shafts, 4 steam turbines,\n|\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | No. 14\n|\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | No. 15\n|\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | No. 16\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nKongō-class battlecruiser\nThe Kongō-class battlecruisers were rebuilt as fast battleships during the 1920s and '30s. Their turbines and boilers were replaced by lighter, more powerful models, they were bulged to improve their underwater protection, their horizontal armor was increased and the range of their guns was increased.\nThe Kongōs were the most active capital ships of the IJN during the Pacific War, participating in most of the major engagements. Hiei and Kirishima acted as escorts during the attack on Pearl Harbor, while Kongō and Haruna supported the Dutch East Indies Campaign. All four participated in the Battles of Midway and Guadalcanal. Hiei and Kirishima were both sunk during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, while Haruna and Kongō jointly bombarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. The two remaining sisters spent most of 1943 shuttling between Japanese naval bases before participating in the major naval campaigns of 1944. They helped to sink two American destroyers and an escort carrier during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Kongō was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine  in November, while Haruna was sunk at her moorings by an air attack on Kure Naval Base in late July 1945; she was raised and scrapped in 1946.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 4 × twin 14&nbsp;in guns\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 4 shafts, 4 steam turbines,\n| 17 January 1911\n| 16 August 1913\n| Sunk, 21 November 1944\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n|4 November 1911\n|4 August 1914\n|Sunk, 13 November 1942\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n|16 March 1912\n|rowspan=2|19 April 1915\n|Sunk, 28 July 1945\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n|17 March 1912\n|Sunk, 15 November 1942\n|}\nYamato class\ns ever built]]\nThe  were built at the beginning of the Pacific War. The ships were the largest and most heavily armed battleships ever constructed. Two ships ( and ) were completed as battleships, while a third () was converted to an aircraft carrier during construction. A fourth ship was scrapped while still under construction and a planned fifth ship was never begun.\nDue to the threat of American submarines and aircraft carriers and worsening fuel shortages, both Yamato and Musashi spent the majority of their careers in naval bases at Brunei, Truk, and Kure—deploying on several occasions in response to American raids on Japanese bases—before participating in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, as part of Vice Admiral Kurita's Center Force. Musashi was sunk during the battle by American airplanes. Shinano was sunk ten days after her commissioning in November 1944 by the American submarine  while Yamato was sunk by US carrier aircraft in April 1945 during Operation Ten-Go.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 3 × triple  guns\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 410&nbsp;mm\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 4 shafts, 4 steam turbines,\n| 4 November 1937\n| 16 December 1941\n| Sunk in air attack, 7 April 1945\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 29 March 1938\n| 5 August 1942\n| Sunk in air attack, 24 October 1944\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | (}})\n| 4 May 1940\n| 19 November 1944\n| Converted to an aircraft carrier, sunk by submarine, 28 November 1944\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | No. 111\n| 7 July 1940\n|\n|\n|}\nDesign A-150\n\"Design A-150\", popularly known as the Super Yamato class, was a planned class of battleships. In keeping with the IJN's long-held doctrine of qualitative superiority, they were designed to be the most powerful battleships afloat. As part of this, the class would have been armed with six  guns, the largest weapons carried aboard any warship in the world. Design work on the A-150s began after the preceding Yamato class was mostly finished by early 1941, when the Japanese began focusing on aircraft carriers and other smaller warships in preparation for the coming conflict. No A-150 would ever be laid down, and many details of the class's design were destroyed near the end of the war.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | No. 798\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3 × twin  guns\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Probably\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Approximately\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Unknown\n|\n|\n|\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! scope=\"row\" | No. 799\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences\nCitations\nBooks\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nJournals\n*\n*  (contact the editor at lars.ahlberg@halmstad.mail.postnet.se for subscription information)\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\nNews\n* }}\n* }}\n*\nCombined Fleet\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* s Last Year: July 1945 – July 1946 |work=Mysteries/Untold Sagas of the Imperial Japanese Navy |year=2003 |publisher=Combined Fleet |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/picposts/Nagatostory.html |access-date=9 May 2019}}\nExternal links\n*"
