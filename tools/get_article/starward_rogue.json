      "text": "# Starward Rogue\n\nStarward Rogue is a bullet hell roguelike video game from Arcen Games. The game takes place in the same universe as many of Arcen's other games, such as AI War and Stars Beyond Reach. The player controls a mech housing a severed head of an alien hydra (the main character \"Hydral\" from The Last Federation), shooting through the levels of a procedurally generated prison tower lodged in the surface of a star.\nThe game was well-received by critics and fans, being favorably compared to games like Binding of Isaac. However the positive reaction did not translate into sales, and the game's poor financial performance shortly after launch was partially responsible for Arcen laying off the majority of its staff.\nOn January 24, 2018, the AuGMENTED expansion pack was released for the game, which added new items, enemies and rooms.\nOn January 25, 2024, Starward Rogue was released on various consoles under Polish publisher Klabater.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://arcengames.com/starward-rogue/ Official Site]\n* [https://klabater.com/en/games/starward-rogue/ Starward Rogue on Klabater's website]"
