The history of franchises that began as independent teams, or as members of the Ohio League, New York Pro Football League, and other defunct leagues are shown as well.\nTimeline\n1920–1932: Birth of the NFL\n1920\nThe American Professional Football Association was formed on September 17, 1920, at Canton, Ohio, with Jim Thorpe elected president. The fourteen teams were mainly drawn from the Ohio League, Chicago Circuit, New York Pro Football League and other teams from the lower midwest. A $100 membership fee was charged. The Chicago Tigers folded after the season.\nThe Massillon Tigers were represented at the September 17 meeting by Ralph Hay, but they never played in the league. As such, they are considered a charter member on a technicality.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"background-color:#FFC40C;font-size: 88%;\" | Team folded this season ^\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 1920 APFA teams\n|-\n|Akron Pros||Decatur Staleys\n|-\n|Buffalo All-Americans||Detroit Heralds\n|-\n|Canton Bulldogs||Hammond Pros\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFC40C;\"|Chicago Tigers^||Muncie Flyers\n|-\n|Cleveland Tigers||Racine Cardinals\n|-\n|Columbus Panhandles||Rochester Jeffersons\n|-\n|Dayton Triangles||Rock Island Independents\n|}\n1921\nThe American Professional Football Association was reorganized in Akron, Ohio on April 30, 1921, with Joe F. Carr elected as new league president. With the low entry barrier of a $100 membership fee, the number of teams ballooned to 21. Four of these franchises would last only one season, with Tonawanda Kardex only making it through a single game. Three other franchises folded mid-season. The Decatur Staleys moved to Chicago.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 1921 name changes\n! 1920 team name\n! 1921 team name\n|-\n|Cleveland Tigers || Cleveland Indians\n|-\n|Decatur Staleys || Chicago Staleys\n|-\n|Detroit Heralds || Detroit Tigers\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-style=\"height:15px;\"\n|style=\"background-color:#00FF00\"|First season in APFA *\n|style=\"background-color:#FFC40C\"|Team folded this season ^\n|style=\"background-color:#FF91A4\"|Only season in the league *^\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 1921 APFA teams\n|Akron Pros || Dayton Triangles || style=\"background-color:#FFC40C\"|Muncie Flyers ^\n|-\n|Buffalo All-Americans || style=\"background-color:#FFC40C\"|Detroit Tigers ^|| style=\"background-color:#FF91A4\"|New York Brickley Giants *^\n|-\n|Canton Bulldogs || style=\"background-color:#00FF00\"|Evansville Crimson Giants * || Racine Cardinals\n|-\n| Chicago Staleys || style=\"background-color:#00FF00\"|Green Bay Packers * || Rochester Jeffersons\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FF91A4\"|Cincinnati Celts *^ || Hammond Pros || Rock Island Independents\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFC40C\"|Cleveland Indians ^ || style=\"background-color:#00FF00\"|Louisville Brecks * || style=\"background-color:#FF91A4\" |Tonawanda Kardex *^\n|-\n| Columbus Panhandles || style=\"background-color:#00FF00\"|Minneapolis Marines * || style=\"background-color:#FF91A4\"|Washington Senators *^\n|}\n1922\nThe APFA was renamed the National Football League on June 24, 1922.
