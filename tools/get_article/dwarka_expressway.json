The expressway takes off from km 20 milestone of NH-48 at Shiv Murti in Mahipalpur adjacent to the IGI Airport in Delhi and terminate at km 40 of NH-48 near Kherki Daula Toll Plaza in Gurgaon in Haryana. The Dwarka Expressway serves as an alternate road link between Delhi and Gurgaon to ease the traffic congestion on the Delhi–Gurgaon Expressway section of NH-48.\nHistory\nConception\nEntire project, costing ₹7,500 crore was planned in 2006. After the land acquisition started in 2007-08, the construction contract was awarded to JSR Construction Private Ltd and India Bulls Private Ltd in April 2011 with the completion date of 31 March 2012. Contract was awarded in 2011 and 14 km out of the original 18 route were completed by 2016. Several more kilometre project routes was added to the scope of the project as an extension, by altering the originally planned route to the current alignment.\nLand acquisition issues delayed the project for several years. After the Punjab and Haryana High Court disposed of the petitions by the land owners in May 2015, the partially completed project was acquired by National Highways Authority of India and road was renamed National Highway 248-BB in June 2016, and the scope of the project was expanded by including the proposed Central Peripheral Road (CPR) and 6.3&nbsp;km long section of  Urban Extension Road-II (UER II) as part of the expressway. But construction couldn't be started immediately as HUDA was not able to hand over land to NHAI due to the matter of allotment of alternate plots to oustees being heard in Punjab and Haryana High Court. On 28 May 2018, the High Court directed HUDA to allot alternate houses to 72 oustees, holding General Power of Attorney or Special Power of Attorney, within two weeks and thus allowing the authority to demolish remaining houses and hand over the land to NHAI. Still, various parts of the project remained delayed due to land acquisition and tree transplantation hurdles, resulting in the intervention from the Prime Minister's office in November 2018 to resolve the pending issues, and all the land related issues were resolved within 2018.\nHaving resolved the land issues, on 08-March-2019 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari laid the foundation stone having already awarded most of the construction contracts. In March 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the partially-completed 18.9 km stretch in Haryana, and the entire route of the completed expressway became operational in June 2025.\nConstruction\nConstruction packages awarded, from north to south, are as follows:\n* Package 1 - in Delhi: Mahipalpur Shiv Murti cloverleaf interchange to Bijwasan railway station underpass, 5.3km including 3.6 km deep tunnel: This stretch starts from Shiv Murti at NH48 and ends at the Bijwasan Rail Underbridge near Dwarka Sector 21. 3.5&nbsp;km of this is a deep tunnel running under the runway costing INR1000 crore.\n* Package 2 - in Delhi: Bijwasan rail underpass to Delhi–Haryana border, 4.2 km elevated: from km 5.3 at the Bijwasan rail underbridge till km 9.5 at the Delhi–Haryana border on the expressway.\n* Package 3 - in Gurugram: Delhi–Haryana border to approach of Basai railway overbridge, 10.2 km elevated: It passes through [https://www.joyvillehomes.com/joyville-gurugram/ Sectors 102], 103, 104, 105, 106, 109, 110, 111, 112 and 113 in Gurugram and has been constructed as an elevated dual carriageway of 4 lanes each.
