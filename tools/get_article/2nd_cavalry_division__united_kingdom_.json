It was part of the British Expeditionary Force that served in France in from 1914 to 1918.\nIt was involved in most of the major actions where cavalry were used as a mounted mobile force, and also many where the troops were dismounted and effectively served as infantry.\nOn 11 November 1918 units of the division were east and north-east of Mons, in Belgium. Orders were received that the division would lead the advance of Fourth Army into Germany, a move that was to begin on 17 November 1918. On 1 December it crossed the frontier south of St. Vith.  The winter was spent south of Liège, and demobilisation commenced.  The division ceased to exist on 31 March 1919.\nAfter the war the division was reformed in the Territorial Army.\nHistory\nNapoleonic Wars\nDuring the Peninsular War, Wellington organized his cavalry into one, later two, cavalry divisions.  They performed a purely administrative, rather than tactical, role; the normal tactical headquarters were provided by brigades commanding two, later usually three, regiments. On 19 June 1811, the cavalry was reorganized as two divisions and the existing Cavalry Division was redesignated as 1st Cavalry Division with the formation of the 2nd Cavalry Division.\nMajor General Sir William Erskine took command on formation. He was absent from 8 December 1811 to 8 April 1812, though at this time the division only comprised one brigade. He resumed command briefly, but committed suicide in Lisbon on 13 February 1813. The divisions were once again amalgamated as The Cavalry Division on 21 April 1813 with Lieutenant General Stapleton Cotton (of the 1st Cavalry Division) in command.\nAssigned Brigades\nThe division was formed on 19 June 1811 with De Grey's and Long's Brigades; Long's Brigade was to remain with the division throughout its existence.  Between 8 November 1811 and 23 March 1812 it commanded just one brigade and it never exceed three brigades in strength.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Brigade\n! From\n!

Named for the commander of 3rd Cavalry Brigade, Brigadier-General Hubert Gough, it took part in the First Battle of the Aisne (12–15 September).  On 13 September, the command was re-designated as the 2nd Cavalry Division''', with the addition of divisional troops from the Royal Horse Artillery, Royal Engineers etc.\nThe 4th Cavalry Brigade joined the division on 14 October from 1st Cavalry Division to bring it up to the standard three brigade strength.  The division remained on the Western Front until the end of the war.\n1914–1917\nIn 1914, the division took part in First Battle of Ypres, notably the battle of Gheluvelt (29–31 October).  In 1915, the division was in action at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle (10–12 March 1915) and the Second Battle of Ypres notable the Battle of St Julien (26 April–3 May) and the Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge (24–25 May).\n1916 saw no notable actions, but in 1917 the division saw action in the Battle of Arras (First Battle of the Scarpe, 9–11 April). and the Battle of Cambrai (the Tank Attack of 20 and 21 November, the Capture of Bourlon Wood of 24–28 November and the German Counter-Attack of 30 November–3 December). At other times, the brigades formed dismounted units and served in the trenches as regiments under the command of their brigadiers.\nWar of movement\n1918 saw the return of the war of movement and the division took part in the First Battle of the Somme notably the Battle of St Quentin (21–23 March), the Battle of the Lys (Battle of Hazebrouck of 14–15 April), the Battle of Amiens (8–11 August) and the Second Battle of the Somme (Battle of Albert of 21–23 August and the Second Battle of Bapaume of 31 August–3 September).\nThe division was then split up with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade serving with First Army, 4th Cavalry Brigade with Third Army and 5th Cavalry Brigade with Fourth Army. Two Subsections formed a Section and in a six gun battery these would be designated as Left, Centre and Right Sections.}} of D Battery, RHA).\nArmistice\nAt the Armistice, units of the division had reached Clairfayts (5th Cavalry Brigade with Fourth Army), Erquelinnes (4th Cavalry Brigade with Third Army) and Havré and St. Denis (3rd Cavalry Brigade with First Army).  On 15 November, the division was re-assembled near Maubeuge and ordered to advance into Germany as an advance screen for Fourth Army and form part of the Occupation Force. The move began on 17 November, Ciney and Rochefort were reached five days later and the 5th Cavalry Brigade crossed the German border south of St. Vith on 1 December.\nIn late December, the division moved to winter quarters south and south-east of Liège.  It remained here until 30 January 1919 when it exchanged regiments with 1st and 3rd Cavalry Divisions then gradually moved back to England.  The Division ceased to exist at midnight 31 March / 1 April 1919.\nOrder of battle\n3rd Cavalry Brigade\n: 16th Lancers on the march, September 1914.]]\nThe brigade joined Gough's Command on 6 September from The Cavalry Division and remained with the division until the end of the war.}} ||\n|-\n| D Battery, RHA || 17 September 1914 ||\n|-\n| 3rd Signal Troop, Royal Engineers || Mobilization ||\n|-\n| 3rd Cavalry Brigade Field Ambulance || Mobilization || 13 September 1914}}\n|-\n| 3rd Cavalry Brigade Machine Gun Squadron, MGC || 29 February 1916 ||\n|}\n4th Cavalry Brigade\nAugust 1914, attached to the Household Cavalry Composite Regiment, preparing to leave for France.]]\nThe brigade joined the division on 14 October from 1st Cavalry Division and remained with the division until the end of the war.}}\n|-\n| 6th Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers) || Mobilization ||\n|-\n| 3rd (King's Own) Hussars || Mobilization ||\n|-\n| 1/1st Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars || 11 November 1914}} ||\n|-\n| J Battery, RHA || 16 September 1914}} ||\n|-\n| 4th Signal Troop, Royal Engineers || Mobilization ||\n|-\n| 4th Cavalry Brigade Field Ambulance || Mobilization || 16 October 1914\n|-\n| 4th Cavalry Brigade Machine Gun Squadron, MGC || 28 February 1916 ||\n|}\n5th Cavalry Brigade\nThe brigade, formerly independent, joined Gough's Command on 6 September and remained with the division until the end of the war.}} ||\n|}\nDivisional Artillery\n:III Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery\n::D Battery, Royal Horse Artillery attached to 3rd Cavalry Brigade\n::E Battery, Royal Horse Artillery attached to 5th Cavalry Brigade\n::J Battery, Royal Horse Artillery attached to 4th Cavalry Brigade\n::1/1st Warwickshire Battery, RHA (TF)\n::III Brigade Ammunition Column\nDivisional Troops\nThe division was supported by the following units:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! &nbsp; !!
