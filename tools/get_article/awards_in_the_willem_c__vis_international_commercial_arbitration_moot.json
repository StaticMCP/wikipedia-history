Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot in Vienna as well as the Willem C. Vis (East) Moot in Hong Kong. The top prizes in Vienna are the Pieter Sanders Award (Best Claimant Memorandum), the Werner Melis Award (Best Respondent Memorandum), the Martin Domke Award (Best Oralist), and the Eric Bergsten Award (Winner of the Moot; known as Frédéric Eisemann Award until 2017). Honourable Mentions are also awarded for the best oralists, memoranda, and teams that qualified for the knockout stages in the oral phase.\nFor the competition in Hong Kong, the top prizes are the David Hunter Award (Best Claimant Memorandum; known as Eric Bergsten Award until 2017), the Fali Nariman Award (Best Respondent Memorandum), the Neil Kaplan Award (Best Oralist), and the Eric Bergsten Award (Winner of the Moot; known as David Hunter Award until 2017). Like the Vienna competition, Honourable Mentions are awarded for the best oralists, memoranda, and teams that qualified for the knockout stages in the oral phase. Up until 2016, a separate winner for the Asian Division was also declared.\nBetween 2020 and 2022, due to COVID-19, both Vis moots were conducted online. In-person hearings resumed for both moots in 2023.\nVis Moot in Vienna\nAwards for best memoranda in Vienna\nHonourable Mentions are awarded for the best memoranda of the competition, and the Pieter Sanders Award is given for the Best Claimant Memorandum. During the first three Moots, the award was given for the Best Written Memoranda in support of the positions of Claimant and Respondent. Subsequently, the Werner Melis Award was introduced as a separate award for the Best Respondent Memorandum. Pieter Sanders was one of the founders of modern international commercial arbitration. He was one of the principal drafters of the New York Convention and the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Professor Sanders was also founder of the Law Faculty of Erasmus University Rotterdam and co-founder of the  International Council for Commercial Arbitration as well as the Netherlands Arbitration Institute. The Werner Melis Award is named after an Honorary President of the International Arbitral Centre of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber (Vienna) and Honorary Vice-president of the International Council for Commercial Arbitration.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:center\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!Moot\n!Year\n!Winner of Best Claimant Memorandum\n!Winner of Best Respondent Memorandum\n|-\n|1st\n|1994\n|Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg\n|NA\n|-\n|2nd\n|1995\n|University of Basel\n|NA\n|-\n|3rd\n|1996\n|University of Cologne\n|NA\n|-\n|4th\n|1997\n|University of Copenhagen\n|Deakin University\n|-\n|5th\n|1998\n|University of Münster\n|University of Münster\n|-\n|6th\n|1999\n|University of Basel\n|University of Basel\n|-\n|7th\n|2000\n|University of Heidelberg\n|University of Heidelberg\n|-\n|8th\n|2001\n|Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg\n|University of Zagreb\n|-\n|9th\n|2002\n|University of Queensland\n|University of Mainz\n|-\n|10th\n|2003\n|University of Bonn\n|University of Cologne\n|-\n|11th\n|2004\n|University of Heidelberg  University of Zurich\n|National University of Singapore\n|-\n|12th\n|2005\n|University of Copenhagen\n|Humboldt University of Berlin\n|-\n|13th\n|2006\n|Columbia University  University of Munich\n|Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich\n|-\n|14th\n|2007\n|Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg\n|Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg\n|-\n|15th\n|2008\n|University of California, Berkeley\n|University of Heidelberg\n|-\n|16th\n|2009\n|University of Sydney\n|Stockholm University\n|-\n|17th\n|2010\n|University of New South Wales\n|University of New South Wales\n|-\n|18th\n|2011\n|Stockholm University\n|Queen's University  University of St. Gallen\n|-\n|19th\n|2012\n|Harvard University  University of Zurich\n|Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg\n|-\n|20th\n|2013\n|University of Belgrade  Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich\n|National University of Singapore\n|-\n|21st\n|2014\n|Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg\n|University of Fribourg (Switzerland)\n|-\n|22nd\n|2015\n|Humboldt University of Berlin\n|National Law University, Jodhpur\n|-\n|23rd\n|2016\n|University of Lucerne\n|Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg\n|-\n|24th\n|2017\n|Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg  Columbia University  University of Geneva\n|Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich\n|-\n|25th\n|2018\n|University of Geneva\n|Humboldt University of Berlin\n|-\n|26th\n|2019\n|University of Sydney\n|University of Vienna\n|-\n|27th\n|2020\n|London School of Economics\n|University of Vienna\n|-\n|28th\n|2021\n|Aarhus University\n|University of Zurich\n|-\n|29th\n|2022\n|University of Heidelberg\n|Sofia University\n|-\n|30th\n|2023\n|Saarland University\n|Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg\n|-\n|31st\n|2024\n|University of Hamburg\n|University of Zurich\n|-\n|32nd\n|2025\n|\nUniversity of Fribourg (Switzerland)  University of Vienna\n|University of New South Wales\n|-\n|}\nAward for the best individual oralist during the general rounds in Vienna\nHonourable Mentions are awarded for the best oralists of the competition; the Martin Domke Award is awarded to the Best Individual Oralist.

The Martin Domke Award was named after a former adjunct professor of law at New York University and a well-known scholar of international arbitration. Professor Domke was also vice president of the American Arbitration Association for 25 years and served as editor-in-chief of the then Arbitration Journal (now the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101025221509/http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=29265 Dispute Resolution Journal]). He also was the author of Commercial Arbitration, published in 1965, and The Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration, published in 1968.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

Vienna\nPreviously the Frédéric Eisemann Award, the Eric Bergsten Award is awarded to the prevailing team in the championship round. The award is named after the founder of the moot. As the Vis has grown in the number of participating teams, the Vis has expanded from having originally only four teams advance into the elimination or knockout rounds to its current state where the top 64 of over 300 teams advance.  From 1994 to 1996, the top four teams advanced; from 1997 to 1999, the top eight teams advanced; from 2000 to 2002, the top 16 teams advanced; and from 2003 to 2007, the top 32 teams advanced. Each team that advances to the elimination rounds receives an award for Honorable Mention for Best Team Orals.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:center\"\n|-

This prize was removed due to the rising performances of Asian teams.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:center\"\n|- \"\n!Moot\n!Year\n!Number of teams\n!Winner of the moot\n!Runner-up\n!3rd place\n!3rd place\n!QF\n|-\n|1st\n|2004\n|14\n|Tsinghua University || Loyola University Chicago || Monash University || University of Hong Kong ||\n|-\n|2nd\n|2005\n|18\n|West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences || University of Houston || Deakin University || Humboldt University of Berlin ||\n|-\n|3rd\n|2006\n|32\n|Loyola Law School Los Angeles || Deakin University || Loyola University Chicago || Universidad Carlos III de Madrid ||\n|-\n|4th\n|2007\n|46\n|Pepperdine University School of Law || Monash University || National Law School of India University || University of Wisconsin ||\n|-\n|5th\n|2008\n|51\n|Griffith University || || Fordham University || ||\n|-\n|6th\n|2009\n|64\n|Loyola  Law School Los Angeles ||  Stetson University || La Trobe University || Hamline University ||\n|-\n|7th\n|2010\n|75\n|Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg || Deakin University || University of Houston || University of Munich ||\n|-\n|8th\n|2011\n|87\n|Bond University || City University of Hong Kong || Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg || University of Hong Kong || * Bucerius Law School\n|-\n|9th\n|2012\n|90\n|City University of Hong Kong || University of Houston || La Trobe University || University of St Gallen || * Harvard University\n|-\n|10th\n|2013\n|93\n|University of Canberra || University of Münster || Bond University || Chinese University of Hong Kong ||\n|-\n|11th\n|2014\n|99\n|Loyola University Chicago || Universiteit van Amsterdam || China-EU School of Law || University of Bucharest ||\n|-\n|12th\n|2015\n|107\n|Singapore Management University|| Arizona State University || Symbiosis Law School || West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences ||\n|-\n|13th\n|2016\n|133\n|Chinese University of Hong Kong || Singapore Management University || Nalsar University of Law || National University of Singapore ||\n|-\n|14th\n|2017\n|128\n| West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences || Nalsar University of Law || Singapore Management University || University of Bucharest ||\n|-\n|15th\n|2018\n|133\n| ILS Law College || Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg || Singapore Management University || University of Ankara ||\n|-\n|16th\n|2019\n|136\n| Universiteit van Amsterdam || Jindal Global Law School || National Law Institute University || University of Bucharest ||\n|-bgcolor=#BFAFB2\n|17th/1st VVE\n|2020 (online)\n|70\n|Chinese University of Hong Kong || Law School, University of São Paulo || Singapore Management University || Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai || * NALSAR University of Law  * National Law School of India University  * National Law University, Jodhpur  * Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo\n|-bgcolor=#BFAFB2\n|18th/2nd VVE\n|2021 (online)\n|150\n| Fordham University || * || Humboldt University of Berlin || University of Mainz || * National Law School of India University  * Yonsei University  * Charles University  * Universitas Katolik Parahyangan\n|-bgcolor=#BFAFB2\n|19th/3rd VVE\n|2022 (online)\n|140\n|Singapore Management University || Monash University || University of Münster || National University of Singapore || * Bucerius Law School  * Humboldt University of Berlin  * Tsinghua University  * University of Tübingen\n|-\n|20th\n|2023\n|111\n|Royal Institute of Colombo || National Law School of India University || Universitas Katolik Parahyangan || University of Mannheim || * NALSAR University of Law  * National Law University, Delhi  * Singapore Management University  * University of Münster\n|-\n|21th\n|2024\n|144\n| National Law University, Jodhpur || Charles University || Peking University || National Law University, Delhi || * NALSAR University of Law  * National Law School of India University  * Singapore Management University  * Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul\n|-\n|22nd\n|2025\n|159\n| Singapore Management University || National Law University, Delhi || || ||\n|}\n* Note: due to an alleged glitch in the scoring, teams that did not advance to Round of 32 were permitted to advance directly to the semi-final round without going through the Round of 32, Round of 16, and quarterfinal.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://vismoot.pace.edu/ Willem C.
