Shah Beg had earlier captured Siwi, Ganjabah, and Fatehpur by defeating Samma forces under Jam Nizamudin II's Gumashta (Governor/Officer), Bahadur Khan, in 1486 CE/892 AH. This victory was even celebrated by the Herat Court, and Abu Muhammad Mirza (Yaar Muhammad), the brother of Shah Beg Arghun, was appointed in charge of the fort of Siwi. Henceforth Jam Nizamuddin II sent a retaliatory force which contested victory.\nBackground\nThe Arghun chief Zu'n-Nun Beg, who, towards the end of the fifteenth century, was appointed by Sultan Hussayn Mirza of Herat to the Governorship of Qandahar, finding the territory under his control insufficient to satisfy his needs and his ambition, proceeded to enlarge his borders. in an easterly direction, and crossing the Amran range, annexed Punishing, Shal (Quetta), and Mastung. His sons, Shah Beg and Muhammed Beg, next descended the Bolan Pass, and added Siwi (or Sibi) to their father’s possessions. But Siwi was in Jam Nanda's territory, and that prince dispatched a strong force under Darya Khan, who seems now to have received the title of Mubarak Khan, to expel the intruders.\nAt that time, the King Babar moved from Samarkand to Kabul. Out of his fear, the Shah Beg Arghun attacked to Sindh through his brother Mirza Sultan Ahmed who looted the forts of Chandka, Mandeja and Machi's.\nBattle\nMubarak Khan came upon the Arghuns at Jalugir, a place in the Bolan Pass, near Bibi Nani, inflicting a crushing defeat on them, and killing their leader, Muhammad Beg. This was the last display of real vigour by a Samma prince. It sufficed for the time, and the Afghans, hardy and tried soldiers as they were, ventured no more into Sindh during Jam Nanda's reign. The defeat of the Arghuns at Jalwakhir took place about 1486.\nAftermath\nUpon learning of the loss, Sultan Nizamudin II sent an army under his Madar-ul-Muham and Khan-i-Azam Jam Mubarak Khan, accompanied by Mubarak's brother Sarang Khan. The two armies clashed at Jalwakhir, not far from the site of Bibi Nani in Bolan Pass. at the point of village Haleokar, where the brother of Shah Arghun was killed and the rest of his forces fled to Kandahar resulting in Arghun defeat. It was not any ordinary success. The forces from Afghanistan had an edge and thrill mixed with fear upon the people and places all over from Sindh to Hindustan. After facing such a humiliating defeat, Arghuns never turned again to Sindh in Jam Nizamuddin's rule, which was the most glaring success Jam Darya Khan's bravery and statesmanship.\nDarya Khan have defeated the strong Arghun forces at Sibi, and the event must have been a fond subject of folk assembles throughout the country when Darya Khan returned victorious marching all the way from Sibi to Thatta. The men high up knew Darya Khan as a great public figure and that is what was recorded of him in history.\nReferences"
