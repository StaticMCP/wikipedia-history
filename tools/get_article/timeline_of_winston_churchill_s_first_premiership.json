      "text": "# Timeline of Winston Churchill's first premiership\n\nThe following is a timeline of the first premiership of Winston Churchill, who was the prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. Churchill served as the prime minister of the United Kingdom during the bulk of World War II. His speeches and radio broadcasts helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult days of 1940–41 when the British Commonwealth and Empire stood almost alone in its active opposition to Nazi Germany. He led Britain as prime minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured.\nAfter the Conservative Party lost the 1945 election, Churchill became Leader of the Opposition to the Labour Government. He would go on to be re-elected as prime minister in 1951.\n1940\nholding a Tommy Gun during an inspection of invasion defences near Hartlepool, on 21 July 1940]]\nApril\n*  |event= The Ministerial Defence Committee, with the First Lord of the Admiralty (Winston Churchill) as its chair, replaces Lord Chatfield's ministerial position of Minister for Coordination of Defence.}}\nMay\n*  |event= Germany invades Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.Following the Norway Debate, Winston Churchill becomes Prime Minister of the United Kingdom upon the resignation of Neville Chamberlain.

A few days later, a grateful Churchill will signal Wasp \"Who says a Wasp can't sting twice?\" These aircraft, employed more aggressively than those previously delivered, turn the tide in the skies over Malta during the next few days, and the Axis is forced to abandon daylight bombing. This is a major turning point in the Siege, and thus in the North African Campaign, although the approaches to the island remain subject to deadly and accurate Axis air attack, preventing efficient re-supply of the island.}}\n*  |event=10: Churchill, growing ever more frustrated with General Auchinleck's inactivity, finally sends him a telegram with a clear order; attack in time to cover for the Harpoon/Vigorous convoys to Malta during the dark of the moon in early June.

Auchinleck does not immediately reply, leaving Churchill, CIGS, and the War Cabinet in a state of suspense.}}\n*  |event= It has been a week since Churchill sent his ultimatum to General Auchinleck, and he has not yet received a reply.

This somewhat daring operation is concluded successfully. The RAF forces available, although outnumbered, make a valiant effort to cover the retreat. Churchill sends Auchinleck a telegram beginning, 'To what position does Ritchie want to withdraw the Gazala troops? Presume there is no question in any case of giving up Tobruk.'  The convoy 'Vigorous', en route to Malta, sights a large Italian naval squadron headed toward it. 'Harpoon' comes under attack for the first time; 'Vigorous' has been under air attack almost since leaving port. }}\n*  |event = General Auchinleck sends Churchill a reply to the latter's telegram of the 14th, saying in part, \"...I have no intention whatever of giving up Tobruk.\" }}\n*  |event= Churchill, about to leave for America, takes the unusual step of sending a letter to HRM George VI, advising him to make Anthony Eden Prime Minister should Churchill not survive the journey.}}\n*  |event= Winston Churchill arrives in Washington for meetings with Roosevelt.}}\nJuly\n*  |event= Churchill survives a censure motion in the House of Commons.}}\nAugust\n*  |event= At a conference in Moscow, Churchill informs Stalin that there will not be a \"second front\" in 1942.}}\n*  |event= General Bernard Montgomery appointed commander of British Eighth Army in North Africa; Churchill is anxious to see more offensive action on the part of the British.}}\nNovember\n*  |event= Montgomery begins a major British offensive beginning at Sollum on the Libya/Egypt border.
