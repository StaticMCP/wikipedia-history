It is part of Hillsboro Parish. Lot 65 was awarded to Richard Wright and Hugh Owens in the 1767 land lottery. In 1796, then-Lieutenant Governor Edmund Fanning granted Lot 65 to fellow Loyalist Andrew Ladner, with Louisa Augusta Fanning and Peter MacGowan as witnesses. Both Fanning and Ladner were Loyalist immigrants from the newly formed United States. Andrew Ladner died in 1836 and is buried in the township at Nine Mile Creek.\nReferences"
