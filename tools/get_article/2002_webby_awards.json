It was presented by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences and was hosted by Tiffany Shlain, the Webby Awards' founder, and Maya Draisin. Coming on the heels of the dot-com bubble (which led to a reduced 2001 awards ceremony), a 2002 Internet bubble forced cutbacks in the event budget for this ceremony as well.\nNominees and winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
