Along with its counterparts in Transnistria and South Ossetia, it kept the unreformed name after declaring independence.\nIt is the successor to the KGB of the Byelorussian SSR, a branch of the Soviet KGB which operated in the Byelorussian republic. Felix Dzerzhinsky, who founded the first Soviet secret police, the Cheka, was born in present-day Belarus and remains an important figure in the state ideology of Belarus under president Alexander Lukashenko as well as a patron of the Belarusian KGB. It is governed by the law About State Security Bodies of the Republic of Belarus.\nThe KGB has command over the Alpha Group as the main counter-terrorist unit, and they can be tasked to help the Militsiya and other law enforcement organizations in anti-crime operations.\nHistory\nOn 1 March 1922, under the auspices Central Executive Committee of the BSSR, a State Political Directorate is formed. In July 1934, an NKVD republican affiliate was formed in the BSSR. 10 years later, during a reform of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Committee for State Security of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (KGB of the BSSR) was formed, which would become an independent agency in 1978. On 25 August 1991, the Supreme Soviet of Belarus passed the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic into constitutional law, effectively declaring independence from the USSR. In September 1991, the KGB of the BSSR was renamed to the KGB of the Republic of Belarus, becoming the new national security body of the state.\nIn October of that year, the Supreme Soviet mandated by law that the State Security Committee is subordinate to the Supreme Council of Belarus. In order to ensure the security of the new republic, the government provided regulations to the agency in January 1992.\nMajor General Vadim Zaitsev, who was in charge of Lukashenko's personal security, was appointed its leader in July 2008. His tenure lasted until November 2012 and he was replaced by Valery Vakulchik. The KGB is formally controlled by the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko. Human rights organizations, the United States, and the European Union have accused the KGB of secret police activities and human rights abuses.\nIn September 2021, a member of the Alpha Group died while conducting a raid against a participant in the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests.\nThe KGB's database, containing 40,000 messages received from the public over nine years, was hacked and published online in 2024.\nOrganization\nThe headquarters of the State Security Committee (, ) is located on Independence Avenue at the corner from Komsomolskaya Street. The building was built between 1945 and 1947 by architects Mikhail Parusnikov and Gennady Badanov. The building was erected in the style of Stalinist Architecture and Neoclassicism. The left wing stretches across Independence Avenue to adjoin the neighboring House of the Minsk Mutual Agricultural Insurance Association.\nStructure\n* Main Directorate of Counterintelligence Activities\n* Main Directorate of Economic Security and Anti-Corruption\n* Main Directorate for Provision of Operational Search Activities\n* Government Communications Department\n* Office of Military Counterintelligence (UVKR)\nEach region has regional divisions:\n*KGB Directorate for the Brest Region\n*KGB Directorate for the Vitebsk Region\n*KGB Directorate for the Grodno Region\n*KGB Directorate for the Gomel Region\n*KGB Directorate for the Mogilev Region\n*KGB Directorate for Minsk and Minsk Region\nChairmen\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|No.\n!rowspan=2|Name\n!rowspan=2|Rank\n!colspan=\"3\"|Term\n!rowspan=2 width=\"43%\"| Notes\n|-\n!
