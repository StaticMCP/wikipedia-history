Born in Canada, he played for the England national team.\nEarly life\nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, where his father served as a clergyman, Parry attended Charterhouse School from 1868 to 1874, and Exeter College, Oxford, where he graduated as B.A. in 1878 and M.A. in 1885.\nFootball career\nParry played three times for England, against Wales in 1879 and 1882 and Scotland in 1882. He scored once.\nHe was captain (and goal-scorer) of the Old Carthusians team which won the 1881 FA Cup Final defeating Old Etonians 3–0. He was the first overseas-born captain of an FA Cup winning team, and the last until Irishman Johnny Carey with Manchester United in 1948 (and not Eric Cantona 48 years later).\nHe was also a member of the Wanderers club  as well as for Swifts of Slough, Remnants, Windsor, and Stoke Poges FC clubs.\nLater life\nParry became a schoolmaster at Felsted School in 1879 before settling at Stoke House private school, Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire in 1881, becoming its head master in 1892 and retiring in 1918. He was national chairman of the Private Schools Association in 1907 and sat on its council for many years. After his retirement, he helped to run the Officers' Family Fund for sons of officers who died in the recent First World War.\nParry became blind in his later years and died at his last home in West Bridgford, Nottingham on 19 July 1931, aged seventy-six. He was buried at the parish church at Plumtree, Nottinghamshire.\nHonours\nOxford University\n*FA Cup runner-up: 1877\nOld Carthusians\n*FA Cup winner: 1881\nInternational goals\n:''Scores and results list England's goal tally first.''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !!
