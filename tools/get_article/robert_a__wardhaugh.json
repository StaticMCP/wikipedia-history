As of , the game has been going on for  years, since 1982.\nCareer\nWardhaugh is a professor at University of Western Ontario, author of several books on Canadian political history. Before that, he worked at the University of Manitoba.\nDungeons and Dragons campaign\nWardhaugh is known as a host and Dungeon master of the longest uninterrupted Dungeons & Dragons campaign. His game world is vast and incorporates \"an 'alternate version of our Earth' which also includes the continent of Tolkien's Middle Earth, picking up 400 years after the destruction of the One Ring\". He runs the game based on AD&D 1st edition rules, though the rules changed over the years. \"Permadeath\" is a rule, meaning that when a character dies in a game the player can't continue the game. The games' website describes it as:\nBecause the world is an alternative fantasy version of historical Earth, you can choose from any pre-gunpowder society: Roman, Greek, Celtic, Norse, Indigenous, Aztec, Mayan, Incan, Scythian, Persian, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Mongolian, African, Babylonian, Sumerian, Phoenician, Assyrian, Slavic, Frankish, Spanish, etc. It is important to remember, however, that these civilizations are placed on their own unique historical timelines. So, some events from our history have happened, while others have not (and will not). Also, remember that you can choose to come from Middle Earth (400 years after the One Ring has been destroyed) or Hyboria (Conan’s world, 500 years after Conan’s death).\nWardaugh started this campaign in 1982, and he said that: \"Perhaps 3 weeks has been the longest we've ever gone without a session\". The game was covered by Popular Mechanics, Wired, and PC Gamer. Wardaugh created more than 30,000 miniatures for the game. He stated that he wants to run the game as long as he can, \"hopefully for all my life, I won't lose my friends.\"\nThe campaign's duration has made it dynastic, with players—of which there have been more than 50—playing the children of their previous characters over the course of generations. Permadeath is embraced, and Wardhaugh says, \"When your character dies, if you don't have any other characters, you're out of the game.\" All told, he says \"about 500 characters\" have come and gone over the past 40 years.\nSelected bibliography\n* (with Barry Ferguson) The Rowell-Sirois Commission and the Remaking of Canadian Federalism (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2021)\n* Behind the Scenes: The Life and Work of W.C.
