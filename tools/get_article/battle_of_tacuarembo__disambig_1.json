Indeed, out of 2,500 men, 500 were killed and 505 were captured, while the Luso-Brazilian forces only had 6 casualties (1 soldier killed and 5 wounded).\nDue to the complete annihilation of Latorre's forces, the battle was a severe blow to the independentist cause and determined the victory of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in the war.\nSee also\n*\n*Portuguese conquest of the Banda Oriental\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
