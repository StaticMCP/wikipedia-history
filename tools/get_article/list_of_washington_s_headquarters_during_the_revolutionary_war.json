It is now exhibited at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia.]]\nThe following is a list of buildings or locations that served as headquarters for General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.\nBackground\nOn April 19, 1775, the militia of Massachusetts, later joined by the militias of other New England colonies, began a siege at Boston to prevent thousands of newly-arrived British troops from moving inland.\nOn June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, created a Continental Army to be formed out of the individual militias of the Thirteen Colonies. The next day, Congress created the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, and unanimously elected Washington to that position. Congress formally presented him with his commission on June 19, and he departed Philadelphia on June 23, headed for Cambridge, Massachusetts. He arrived in Cambridge on July 2, and took command. The siege lasted almost 11 months, until March 17, 1776, when the British withdrew by ship.\nWashington's headquarters staff consisted of a military secretary, initially Colonel Joseph Reed, and four aides-de-camp, initially William Palfrey, Stephen Moylan, Richard Cary, and Robert Hanson Harrison. They managed Washington's correspondence, made copies of each day's general orders to be distributed to the commanding officer at each military post, and made copies of individual orders from the commander-in-chief.\nTraveling with the headquarters staff and a troop of bodyguards, Washington tended to stay at military camps, taverns, houses belonging to Continental Army officers or sympathetic civilians, and vacant houses seized from Loyalists. Topography and geographical features were exploited to protect a headquarters. For example: before and after the Battle of Germantown, Washington stayed at the Henry Keely House, atop a plateau on the west side of the Perkiomen Creek, while the Continental Army camped on the east side of the creek at Pennypacker Mills; positioned between the British Army and Washington.\nWashington's correspondence and expense accounts are useful sources for determining his location on a specific date. For instance: an expense account entry that lists meals – but not \"use of house\" – likely indicates that Washington and his staff pitched their tents on the owner's property.\nHeadquarters\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"15%\" | Name\n! width=\"5%\"  | Image\n! width=\"20%\"  | Location/GPS Coordinates\n! width=\"15%\"  | Dates\n! width=\"45%\"  | Notes\n|-\n| Benjamin Wadsworth House\n|\n| Harvard Yard, 1341 Massachusetts Avenue,Cambridge, Massachusetts\n| July 2 to 15, 1775\n| First of Washington's Headquarters.July 3 – Washington takes command of the Continental Army.\n|-\n| John Vassall House, also known as Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site\n|\n| 105 Brattle Street,Cambridge, Massachusetts\n| July 15, 1775 to April 4, 1776\n| March 17 – Siege of Boston ends with the British evacuation of nearly 10,000 troops.\n|-\n| Samuel Dexter House\n|\n| 699 High Street,Dedham, Massachusetts\n| April 4 to 5, 1776\n| \"Expenses paid ...
