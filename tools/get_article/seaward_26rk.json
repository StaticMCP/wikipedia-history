The boat was actually built by Island Packet Yachts, owned by Hake Marine.\nDesign\nThe Seaward 26RK is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. The deck is cored with Divinycell foam. It has a fractional sloop rig; a nearly plumb stem; an open, walk-through transom; a vertically retractable, transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller or optional wheel and a retractable, lead-cored, lifting keel. It displaces  and carries  of lead ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of  with the keel extended and  with it retracted, allowing operation in shallow water or ground transportation on a trailer.\nThe boat is normally fitted with a small outboard motor for docking and maneuvering, but a Yanmar inboard diesel engine was a factory option.\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a bow cabin \"V\"-berth and two main cabin settee berths, around a flip-up table. The galley is located on the port side just forward of the companionway ladder. The galley is equipped with a single-burner stove, icebox and a sink. The head is portable type, with an enclosing door optional. Cabin headroom is .\nThe design has a hull speed of .\nOperational history\nIn a 2005 review in Practical Sailor, Darrell Nicholson wrote, \"this boat reflects a thoughtful approach to design that increases user comfort, though its sail plan may disappoint more performance-minded sailors. The additional space in the cockpit and waterline length are a plus, especially since they add only 200 lbs. to the displacement. And we think owners of the 26RK will be pleased at the boat’s ability to gunkhole in bodies of water where deeper draft vessels would be restricted.\"\nSee also\n*List of sailing boat types\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160831013112/http://www.seawardyachts.com/26rk/ Official website archives] on archive.org"
