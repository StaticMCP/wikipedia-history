William Percival Jervis, a contemporary potter in the Arts and Crafts movement, noted Harley Jones's expertise in using underglaze colors.  Jervis also lauded the firm's work in transfer printing of photographs onto pottery. Around 1920, Harley Jones's firm began to manufacture practical earthenware in addition to ornamental pieces. The firm went bankrupt in 1934, having switched its focus to manufacturing fireplace tiles a year earlier.\nReferences"
