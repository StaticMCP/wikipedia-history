In spite of its naming it is classified as a Byzantine museum. It was inaugurated in 1951, but officially was founded in 1952 by the Ephorate of Antiquities of Laconia in the west wing of the metropolitan complex, its exhibits range from the early Christian era to Post-Byzantine times, but also include older and more recent items.\nHistory\nThe first informal museum on the east wing of the metropolitan complex was founded by the French Byzantine scholar Gabriel Millet in the late 19th century, were placed there sculptural architectural members from the temples of Mystras, later at the beginning of the 20th century the collection was enriched, with the contribution of the Metropolitan of Sparta Theoklitos Minopoulos.\nIn the year 2001 the permanent exhibition was reorganized, with a new thematic, museological and museographic approach, which was also dictated by the need to present the latest findings of the research.\nGallery\nImage:Museum of Mystras, relief of ascension of alexander the great, 2nd half of 14th century.JPG|Relief depicting Alexander the Great, c. 1350–1400.\nImage:Museum of Mystras,entroned christ, 2nd half of 14th century.JPG|Christ sitting on the throne, c. 1350–1400.\nImage:Museum of Mystras, plaque relief.JPG|Plaque relief.\nImage:Museum of Mystras, dress of the mummy of mystra 02.JPG|Remains of the Mystras mummy outfit.\nImage:Museum of Mystras, dress of the mummy of mystra, riconstruction.JPG|Reconstruction of the outfit of the Mystras mummy.\nImage:Museum of Mystras, manuscript codex 4 1642.JPG|Scripting Code.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n* }}\n* }}\nExternal links\n*[http://old.mfa.gr/english/greece/through_time/archaeology/museums/byzantinian_mistras.html Hellenic Ministry of Foreign Affairs]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120318073423/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh155.jsp?obj_id=3433 Ministry of Culture and Tourism]"
