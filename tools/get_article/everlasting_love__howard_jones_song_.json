Written by Jones, it was released as the album's first single on 20 February 1989.\nThe song reached No. 12 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the early summer of that year, and also peaked at No. 19 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, the first of only two singles to appear there. It also spent two weeks at No. 1 on the US Adult Contemporary chart, the singer's second chart-topper on this tally (following \"No One Is to Blame\" from 1986). In his native UK, where Jones had enjoyed numerous pop hits, \"Everlasting Love\" failed to have as much of an impact as earlier singles, stalling at No. 62 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was co-produced by ex-Tears for Fears band member Ian Stanley.\nTrack listing\n;7\" & cassette\n#\"Everlasting Love\" – 4:20\n#\"The Brutality of Fact\" – 4:27\n;12\"\n#\"Everlasting Love (808 Mix)\" – 6:28\n#\"Everlasting Love\" – 4:20\n#\"The Brutality of Fact\" – 4:27\n#\"Power of the Media\" – 4:47\n;3\" CD\n#\"Everlasting Love\" – 4:20\n#\"The Brutality of Fact\" – 4:27\n#\"Power of the Media\" – 4:47\n#\"No One Is to Blame\" – 4:13\n;Limited Edition 3\" CD\n#\"Everlasting Love (The Institute Mix)\" – 4:48\n#\"Hide and Seek (Orchestral)\" – 7:09\n#\"Conditioning (Live in Philadelphia)\" – 5:26\nChart positions\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Chart\n!Position\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|1989\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|US Modern Rock Tracks\n|align=\"center\"|19\n|-\n|US Adult Contemporary\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|62\n|-\n|Australian Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|91\n|-\n|Canada - RPM\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1989)\n!align=\"center\"|Position\n|-\n|Canada Top Singles (RPM)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|61\n|}\nPersonnel\n*Howard Jones – vocals; keyboards\n*Ian Stanley – keyboards\n*Chris Hughes – drums\n*Andy Ross – guitar\n*Martin Jones – guitar\n*Sandy McLelland – additional vocals\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.discogs.com/release/1389848 12\" single release info at discogs.com]\n*[http://www.howardjones.com/discography/uk/everlastinglove.html The Official Howard Jones Website Discography]"
