      "text": "# Dingle (Liverpool ward)\n\nDingle ward is an electoral division of Liverpool City Council centred on the Dingle area of the city. It was created in 1895 from part of the previous Toxteth Park ward where three councillors were elected. Its boundaries were changed in 1953, 1973, 1980 before being dissolved in 2004 where it was split into the new Riverside and St Michael's wards.\nThe ward was recreated in 2023 following a review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England which decided that the existing 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The Dingle ward was reinstated as a two-member ward from the southern portions of the former Riverside ward and a small part of the former Princes Park ward. The new ward is represented by two councillors. The ward contains the Florence Institute and High Park Reservoir\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#FFF\"| 2004 - 2022 WARD DISESTABLISHED\n|-\n| 2023\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Sarah Doyle (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Steve Munby (Lab)\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n}}\n§Sarah Doyle and Steve Munby were re-standing councillors for the former Riverside ward.\nReferences"
