It has a blue-grey back covered with large pale spots and a yellow belly. The male throat may be black or pale yellow and has two dark chevrons.\nThey mature at around 9 months and have a lifespan of 18 months.\nHabitat\nThe Okavango dwarf gecko is normally arboreal and can found on tree trunks and sometimes buildings of the tropical savanna and flooded grasslands. It prefers to forage high up in trees and can often be found on acacia, baobab and mopane trees.\nDiet\nTheir diet is mainly ants and termites.\nReproduction\nReproduction occurs throughout the year and two hard-shelled eggs (5 × 6.5&nbsp;mm) are laid every 8 weeks beneath the tree bark or in disused termite mound. The eggs hatch in about 125 days and the young geckos are about 30&nbsp;mm in length.\nReferences"
