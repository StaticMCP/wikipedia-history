She is often imagined as an old and intelligent lady by Tamil people. Many poems and the Avvai Kural, comprising 310 kurals in 31 chapters, belong to this period. She is most widely known for her 'Aathichoodi', 'Kondrai Vendhan', 'Nalvazhi' and 'Moodhurai'. The name Avvaiyar means a 'respectable good woman', hence a generic title; her personal name is not known.\nBiography\nAvvaiyar was the court poet of the Chola monarch and was a contemporary of Kambar and Ottakkuttar. She found great happiness in the life of small children. Her works, Ātticcūṭi and Konraiventhan, written for young children, are even now generally read and enjoyed by them.\nHer two other works, Mooturai and Nalvali were written for older children. All the four works are didactic in character—they explain the basic wisdom that should govern mundane life.\nQuotes\nThe following quotes from Aathichoodi illustrate the simplicity of her style and profoundness of the messages:\n{| border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Uyir Ezhuthu !! ஆத்திசூடி !!

The poems were selected and translated into English by Thomas Pruiksma, a poet and translator who discovered Avviyar's work while on a Fulbright scholarship at The American College in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.\nLiterary Tribute\nLetitia Elizabeth Landon pays tribute to Avvaiyar in her poem   in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836.\nFurther reading\n* Pruiksma, T.
