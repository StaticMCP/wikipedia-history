Northrup states: \"This volume constitutes a rich resource for the study of slavery and slave elites....the research may extend well beyond the interests of historians, for the study of this phenomenon may have implications for understanding the roots of instability in the Islamic world today.\"\nHis edited book Writing African History (2005), was named a Choice Outstanding Academic Title in 2006. Copies are held in over 600 academic libraries worldwide.  Reviewer Saheed Aderinto states:This book is to date the most multidisciplinary volume on African historiography....The editor adds value to the content of the essays with a brilliant introduction and conclusion, which explore the meaning of history and historical research. In the concluding chapter, he provides a step -to -step approach to the following closely related task: choosing a topic, data collection, data evaluation, data organization and writing.\nPublications\nAuthor/editor\n* ''Black Africa's Largest Islamic Kingdom Before Colonialism: Royal Ribats Of Kano and Sokoto (2016) [https://www.amazon.com/africas-largest-islamic-kingdom-colonialism/dp/1945172525/ details]\n* “The Early Issues of the First Newspaper in Hausa Gaskiya Ta Fi Kwabo, 1939–1945.” History in Africa, vol. 41, 2014, pp.&nbsp;425–31.
