He played for the Leeds Rhinos, the Castleford Tigers, Hull Kingston Rovers and Harlequins RL in the Super League, and for Great Britain and England A at international level.\nWard became London Broncos academy head coach in 2014. The following year, he was named first team assistant coach, working under Andrew Henderson. Ward was promoted to head coach for 2018 and oversaw the Broncos' return to the Super League. He departed the club in 2021 and moved into rugby union coaching, before returning to the Super League as the head coach of the Castleford Tigers in 2023.\nBackground\nWard was born in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, England. Ward is the son of former Leeds captain and coach David Ward.\nPlaying career\nLeeds Rhinos\nHe was signed for Leeds Rhinos from Dewsbury Moor, and he made his début as a substitute against the Sheffield Eagles in 1999. He was named the Leeds Alliance Player of the Year in 2000, before becoming a regular first team member the following season.\nWard emulated his father by playing in the Challenge Cup Final in 2003. In 2004 he made 14 first team starts and 12 substitute appearances, and scored a try in the 46–28 win over Wakefield. Ward played for the Leeds Rhinos at  in their 2004 Super League Grand Final victory over the Bradford Bulls.\nAs Super League IX champions, the Rhinos faced 2004 NRL season premiers, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in the 2005 World Club Challenge.

He joined the Castleford Tigers, who had just been promoted from National League One. Ward adapted well to his new surroundings and one of his highlights that year was a try in the 31–30 victory over his former employers at the Jungle. However, his efforts were not enough to save Castleford from relegation.\nHull Kingston Rovers\nFor the 2007 season, he like Luke Dyer, a teammate of his at Castleford, moved east to pastures new at Craven Park with Hull Kingston Rovers. So far, Ward has yet to make the impact that he did at both Leeds and Castleford, but his presence presents a danger to any defence in the whole of Super League.\nHarlequins Rugby League\nWard in action for Harlequins RL\nHe was released from Hull Kingston Rovers on 17 September 2007. He signed a two-year deal with Harlequins starting from the 2008 season.\nInternational level\nWard first played at international level for the Great Britain Academy before being selected for John Kear's England Under-21 squad for the tour of South Africa at the end of the 2001's Super League VI.
