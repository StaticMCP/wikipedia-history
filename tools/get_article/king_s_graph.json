More specifically, an n \\times m king's graph is a king's graph of an n \\times m chessboard. It is the map graph formed from the squares of a chessboard by making a vertex for each square and an edge for each two squares that share an edge or a corner. It can also be constructed as the strong product of two path graphs.\nFor an n \\times m king's graph the total number of vertices is n m and the number of edges is 4nm -3(n + m) + 2. For a square n \\times n king's graph this simplifies so that the total number of vertices is n^2 and the total number of edges is (2n-2)(2n-1).\nThe neighbourhood of a vertex in the king's graph corresponds to the Moore neighborhood for cellular automata.\nA generalization of the king's graph, called a kinggraph, is formed from a squaregraph (a planar graph in which each bounded face is a quadrilateral and each interior vertex has at least four neighbors) by adding the two diagonals of every quadrilateral face of the squaregraph.\nIn the drawing of a king's graph obtained from an n\\times m chessboard, there are (n-1)(m-1) crossings, but it is possible to obtain a drawing with fewer crossings by connecting the two nearest neighbors of each corner square by a curve outside the chessboard instead of by a diagonal line segment. In this way, (n-1)(m-1)-4 crossings are always possible. For the king's graph of small chessboards, other drawings lead to even fewer crossings; in particular every 2\\times n king's graph is a planar graph. However, when both n and m are at least four, and they are not both equal to four, (n-1)(m-1)-4 is the optimal number of crossings.\nSee also\n* Knight's graph\n* Queen's graph\n* Rook's graph\n* Bishop's graph\n* Lattice graph\n*\nReferences"
