The DAC oversees rural development work and conservation and is headed by a cabinet secretary. The current secretary is Ramón González Beiró who was confirmed in May 2021.\nHistory\nPrior to the Constitution, according to law 60 of April 25, 1940, it was known as Department of Agriculture. The most recent reorganization of government responsibilities concerning the department come from Law No. 4 of 2010.\nThe purpose of DAPR is to:\n* Support agricultural production, commercial fishing, and aquaculture to ensure fair prices and stable markets for producers and consumers;\n* Work to improve and maintain farm income; and\n* Help to develop and expand markets abroad for agricultural products.\nActivities\nDAPR administers rural development, credit, and conservation programs that are designed to implement national growth policies, and it conducts scientific and technological research in all areas of agriculture. Through its inspection and grading services, DAPR ensures standards of quality in food offered for sale.\nThroughout the years, the department's name has been modified, as well as its structure, but today remains a separate structure with additional agencies and public corporations as part of the Department of Agriculture \"umbrella\".\nThe department is headed by a cabinet secretary, appointed by the Governor of Puerto Rico and subject to the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico. The current incumbent is Ramón González Beiró.\nSecretaries\n* Miguel Hernandez Agosto\n* Antonio González Chapell\n* Carlos López Nieves\n* Javier Rivera Aquino\n* Justo A.
