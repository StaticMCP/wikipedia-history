The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nEven though Kosovo is not fully internationally recognized as a independent state by many countries, although recognized by the United States, AMPAS granted the territory autonomy to submit films for the category, following the same rules granted to Hong Kong, Greenland and Palestine.\nAs of 2025, Kosovo has submitted nine films, but none of them were nominated.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nAll the films submitted are in Albanian. 2021's Hive was shortlisted between the 15-finalist films, but was not nominated.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Kosovo for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
