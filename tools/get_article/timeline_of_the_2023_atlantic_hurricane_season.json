      "text": "# Timeline of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season saw an above average number of named storms and an average number of hurricanes and major hurricanes (category&nbsp;3 or higher on the 5-level Saffir–Simpson wind speed scale). There were twenty named storms during the season; seven of them strengthened into hurricanes, and three of those reached major hurricane intensity. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 2023, and ended on November&nbsp;30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most subtropical or tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic. However, tropical cyclone formation is possible at any time of the year, as was the case this season, when an unnamed subtropical storm formed on January 16. The last system to dissipate was Hurricane Tammy, on October&nbsp;28.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) are: Greenwich, Cape Verde, Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first, with the respective regional time zone included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\n__TOC__\nTimeline\nJanuary\nJanuary 16\non January&nbsp;16]]\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC
