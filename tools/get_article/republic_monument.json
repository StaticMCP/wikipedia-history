The monument has two sides: the side facing north depicts Atatürk in military uniform during the Turkish War of Independence, while the side facing south (towards İstiklal Avenue) has Atatürk and his comrades dressed in modern Western clothing; the former symbolizing his role as military commander-in-chief, and the latter symbolizing his role as statesman.\nSemyon Ivanovich Aralov, Ambassador of the Russian SFSR in Ankara during the Turkish War of Independence, is among the group of people behind Atatürk (his figure wears a cap and stands behind İsmet İnönü, on the southern facade of the monument). His presence in the monument, ordered by Atatürk, points out to the financial and military aid sent by Vladimir Lenin in 1920, during the Turkish War of Independence (1919–1922).\nCumhuriyet Anıtı is an important site, where official ceremonies on national holidays are being held.\nSee also\n* List of public art in Istanbul\nNotes\nReferences\n* Mevlüt Çelebi, Taksim Cumhuriyet Anıtı, Atatürk Araştırma Merkezi, 2006 Ankara, 1.
