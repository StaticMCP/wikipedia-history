It is one of two high schools part of Community Unit School District 200, the other being Wheaton North High School.\nThe school has had a long history, during which it has had three names, and is considered the successor to a school with a similar name. The school is known for its academic and athletic accomplishments, its alumni include astronomer Edwin Hubble, comedian John Belushi and actor Jim Belushi.\nHistory\nThe history of Wheaton Warrenville High School can be traced back to the original high school in Wheaton, Wheaton High School, which opened in 1876. In 1925, the school was relocated to a new building which would eventually become Hubble Middle School, and changed its name to Wheaton Community High School.\nIn October 1946, the school's cafeteria was largely destroyed by a fire that was blamed on a recently installed Coca-Cola vending machine.\nIn 1964, with the completion of its sister school, Wheaton North, the school was again renamed, Wheaton Central High School.\nBy 1967, overcrowding became an issue at Wheaton Central. In late 1967, the school board proposed a redistricting move that would send all Warrenville students to the newer Wheaton North building. In January 1968, the board approved bussing underclass students in Warrenville to Wheaton North, and allowing upperclassmen the choice of either school.\nThe current building that houses Wheaton Warrenville South was opened in 1973, and operated as Wheaton-Warrenville High School from 1973 to 1983. By 1982, it was clear that the high school population in the district was shrinking, and there would be a need to close either the older, tradition rich Wheaton Central, or the newer, but smaller Wheaton-Warrenville. In June 1982, the school board voted 6–1 to close Wheaton-Warrenville High School, effective at the end of the 1982–83 school year. In response, there was a request for a mass transfer of all students from Wheaton-Warrenville High to either of the two other schools, and forcing more changes at the other schools. When the request for the mass transfer was not granted by the board, a group of Warrenville parents began threatening to secede from the district. In January 1983, the parent group presented a petition signed by over 75% of the registered voters of Warrenville to approve detaching from the district. The movement to split from the district eventually moved to the courts. Without even hearing the school board's argument, the judge ruled against the parents group. The issue finally came to an end when the DuPage Valley Regional Board of School Trustees voted 5–2 to reject the secession bid.\nIn 1983, the original Wheaton-Warrenville High School became Wheaton Warrenville Middle School, reflecting a shrinking high school population and an increasing population of younger students.\nIn 1988, with Wheaton Central aging, the board moved to renovate Wheaton Warrenville Middle School in preparation for opening it again as a high school, when Wheaton Central would need to eventually be closed. In October 1989, the school board formally proposed moving high school students from Wheaton Central back to Wheaton-Warrenville Middle School, and converting the older Wheaton Central building to a middle school. On May 9, 1990, the board officially voted to make the change, ending a situation that had again \"divided residents\". Even after the decision was made, there was debate over the naming of the school. In 1992, with an increase in the district's high school population, there was a need to move the high school population from the older 1925 building to the newer, larger 1973 building. The 1925 building became Hubble Middle School, and upon moving, Wheaton Central High School became Wheaton Warrenville South High School. Thus, the original Wheaton-Warrenville High School is considered the forerunner of the current Wheaton Warrenville South High School (not the same school). This can be seen in the evolution of the school seal which came from WCHS. The school colors, mascot, and nickname are continuations of Wheaton Central.\nIt is proper to write the name of the earlier school as Wheaton-Warrenville High School, with a hyphen. When the school was renamed, the hyphen was dropped to symbolize a lack of division. The hyphen in the original name implied a separation between the two communities, and also suggested that the school was not fully a part of either community, and instead existed as a separate entity between them.\nBy removing the hyphen, the school is effectively signaling that it is no longer separating the two communities, and instead is fully a part of both. The new name, Wheaton Warrenville South High School, does not emphasize the separation between Wheaton and Warrenville, but instead the coming together of the two communities.\nIn this way, the removal of the hyphen can be seen as a symbol of unity and a lack of division between the two communities. It may be used to represent the school's desire to bring the community together, to bridge the gap and make a stronger connection. It may also reflect the school's efforts to create an inclusive and harmonious environment for all students and staff, regardless of their background.\nThe 1925 building housing Hubble Middle School was closed at the end of the 2008–09 school year. A new Hubble Middle School was constructed, and the site has been demolished and turned into a supermarket called Mariano's.\nArchitecture\nThe building comprises five major pods: Grange, completed in 2005, and Tradition, Scholarship, Commitment, and Integrity, which are taken from the school seal.\nIn 1999, the Integrity wing was built in the southeast corner of the school to house the math department. It includes eleven new classrooms, a math lab, and a math office.\nIn 2002, The Tradition and Commitment pods, primarily housing the English and Science departments, respectively, underwent significant renovations with reconstruction of all second floor classrooms. More than $100,000 worth of technology was also upgraded in 2002, with all classrooms receiving at least one new Dell XP computer connecting to a new broadband internet access connection, cable TV, accompanying DVD/VCR combo player. The computer labs were also updated and several carts of wireless internet laptops were added.\nWheaton Warrenville South installed solar panels on the roof of the school as an alternative energy source as part of a 2004 partnership with British Petroleum. BP's North American Chemical headquarters is located approximately two miles south of the school in Naperville. The remaining energy comes from Commonwealth Edison, which primarily produces energy from nuclear and fossil fuel sources.\nOn April 1, 2003, residents of Community Unit School District 200 approved, by a vote of 10,173 to 6,518, a $72 million bond referendum to add about  of space and renovate both Wheaton Warrenville South, and its counterpart, Wheaton North.\nThe first phase of construction began in August 2003 and was completed in March 2005 and included 21 new classrooms with two resource centers to house the English and Foreign Language departments, two art rooms, a band room, an orchestra room, a choral room, and nine sound-proof practice rooms. In addition, the central office area was reconverted for the counseling center and the health office, while all other administrative offices were moved to the front of the building. A new commons area was constructed and the cafeteria underwent significant renovations.\nThe second phase began in spring 2005 and was completed by May 2006 and consisted primarily of renovations to the athletics wing and the construction of the field house. The library has undergone significant renovations during summer of 2006.\nAcademics\nAccording to the 2017–18 Illinois Report Card, Wheaton Warrenville South has a 95% graduation rate; 85% of graduates enroll in a two-year or four-year college within 12 months of graduation. Wheaton Warrenville South has earned an \"A+\" Rating for Academics according to Niche independent ratings.

The school has a weighted GPA system in which there is a 4.0 scale for I-level classes and a 5.0 scale for A and AP-level classes. The school offers 17 Advanced Placement Courses; 31% of students are enrolled in AP classes. In 2018, Community Unit School District 200 was one of 447 school districts in the U.S. and Canada honored by the College Board with placement on the Annual AP District Honor Roll.\nIn 2018, Money Magazine rated the community as #27 on their National \"Best Places To Live 2018\" ranking [#1 in Illinois], citing \"The school district in town consistently ranks among the best in the state—one reason Wheaton has made repeat appearances on Money's Best Places to Live rankings over the years.\"\nStudent life\nAthletics\n]]\nWWSHS competes in the DuKane Conference as of the 2018–2019 school year.
