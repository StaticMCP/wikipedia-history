Prior to recording, he worked in many occupations including as a sharecropper, a moonshine maker, and a traveling salesmans. He later became active with the civil rights movement, which inspired him to write socially conscious blues songs. In 1983, he founded the Rural Members Association, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the traditional rural skills King had grown up with, which he called 'survival skills,' and helping improve his local community.  In 1997, the Rural Members Association started the annual Freedom Creek blues festival, which has since received international recognition. He began recording in 1999 and his 2000 recordings Freedom Creek and I Am The Blues, were the first of several acclaimed albums.\nKing performed at national and international festivals but mostly played near his home, most notably as a regular at Bettie's Juke joint in Mississippi. He described his music as \"struggling blues\" because of its focus on the \"injustices in life in the rural South\".\nKing died from a heart attack shortly before his 66th birthday, near his home in the rural community of Old Memphis, Alabama, just a few miles from his birthplace.\nWillie King on film\nDutch film-makers Saskia Rietmeijer and Bart Drolenga (Visible World Films) wanted to produce a documentary about African American arts and culture in the Deep South. But they met Willie King and instead decided to devote their efforts to creating a documentary about King's life and times, titled Down in the Woods.  King was also featured in Martin Scorsese's 2003 documentary series The Blues and Shout Factory's Blues Story the same year.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n||Date\n||Title\n||Label\n||Comments\n|-\n|1999||''Walkin' the Walk Talkin' the Talk||self-produced||With \"Birmingham\" George Conner\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2000|||I Am the Blues||Rural Members Association||\n|-\n|Freedom Creek||Rooster Blues||Live with the Liberators\n|-\n|2002||Living in a New World||Rooster Blues||With the Liberators\n|-\n|2004||Jukin' at Bettie's||Freedom Creek Music||\n|-\n|2006||One Love||Freedom Creek Music||\n|}\nVideos\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n||Date\n||Title\n||Label\n||Formats\n||Comments\n|-\n|2003||Blues Story||Shout Factory||DVD|| Directed by Jay Levey\n|-\n|2003||The Blues: Feel Like Going Home||Universal/Sony||DVD, VHS|| First episode of a seven-part documentary by Martin Scorsese\n|-\n|2007||Down in the Woods''||Visible World Films||DVD|| 63-minute documentary plus 40 minutes of live music\n|}\nAwards\n*Alabama Folk Heritage Award (awarded posthoumously) 2009\n*Howlin' Wolf Hall of Fame Inducted September 2, 2005\n*Alabama State Council on the Arts 2004 Artist Fellowship\n*Living Blues 2003 Blues Artist of the Year, Best Song, Best Cover Art\n*Living Blues 2001 Best Blues Artist\n*Living Blues 2000 Best Blues Album, Best Contemporary Blues Album\nSee also\n*Rooster Blues\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wual/news.newsmain?action=article&ARTICLE_ID=1482154 Obituary that aired on Alabama Public Radio]\n*[http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20090309/NEWS/903091998/0/SPORTS04 News story at tuscaloosanews.com]\n*[http://www.willie-king.com Willie King homepage]\n*[http://blues.org/about/news.php4?Id=754 The Blues Foundation]"
