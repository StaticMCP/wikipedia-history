      "text": "# Prospect Hill Monument\n\nThe Prospect Hill Monument, also occasionally called the Prospect Hill Tower is a stone structure in Somerville, Massachusetts. It is a block away from the heart of Union Square, a neighborhood in Somerville.  Its name is formally the Prospect Hill Memorial Flag Tower and Observatory.\nThe tower is four stories tall and built out of iron and stone. The lower deck, outside of the first floor is open to the public and offers a panoramic view of Boston, Somerville, and Cambridge. The city of Somerville has offered tours of the tower. It has been refurbished several times since in order to preserve its structural soundness.\nThere is a tradition of annual flag-raising ceremonies involving American Revolutionary War reenactors that are held at Prospect Hill on New Year's Day.\nHistory\nProspect Hill was the location of George Washington's command post and rebel fortifications during the Siege of Boston in the American Revolution. It also served as a training facility during the American Civil War. The tower monument was built in 1903. The plaque states that:\n}}\nFlag exhibit\nThe monument flies the Continental Union Flag, the first American flag. On New Year's Day in 1776, Washington conducted a flag-raising ceremony to raise the morale of the men of the Continental Army. The standard account features the Continental Union Flag, although in 2006, Peter Ansoff advanced a theory that it was actually a British Union flag instead. Others, such as Byron DeLear, have argued in favour of the traditional version of events.\nSee also\n* Flag on Prospect Hill debate\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.bostonmagazine.com/property/2017/02/21/somerville-prospect-hill-tower/ Prospect Hill Tower]\n* [https://www.somervillema.gov/prospecthillpark Rehabilitation]"
