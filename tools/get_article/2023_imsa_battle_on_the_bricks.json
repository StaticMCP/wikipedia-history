We’ve had only — pretty much — bad races. And looking at it, it still hurts. So we finally get a win back, and that put us back on the championship hunt. And I’m just hungry for more, to be honest. I just want to go to Atlanta now and race.\" Derani explained his overtaking of the No. 6 and No. 7 Porsches behind the safety car: \"We were on top of the rules. I tried to overtake the 7, he kind of blocked me. I think he was trying to give the 6 a chance to go, and then obviously the 6 didn’t go – and I just went. We’re just trying to follow the rules to the best of our ability. Sometimes miscommunications happen, which probably was the case. I think IMSA did the right thing on the call. If the car in front of you don’t go, and you’ve given them enough time…then it is what it is.\"\nThomas praised his teammate, Jensen for securing the No. 11 TDS team victory in LMP2. Mantella called his LMP3 win \"a dream come true\": \"When I think back to Daytona, it is one of the greatest moments of my life – especially to be driving with such professionals. And Indy is on that bucket list. To kiss the bricks after a win is every kid’s dream. Everybody that did it – (team owner) Andrew Wojteczko, Wayne and myself – we all did it with tears in our eyes because it means that much.\" Gounon admitted his was surprised by Bacher changing lanes at the start: “I was on the radio about that right away. I knew there was going to be a penalty, so I immediately backed out of it and that opened the door for us. I think it would have been a difficult fight for us, but we were up for it.\" Snow said it was nice to secure the GTD Drivers' Championship 1 race early: \"Petit Le Mans is a very, very long race, and it’s a lot of stress off our shoulders, knowing that at Petit, we can just enjoy racing. But that’s due to all the hard work Paul Miller Racing put in going into this weekend knowing that if we perform the absolute best we did this weekend, we will be able to relax the next weekend. Indy has been awesome.\"\nAs a result of winning the race, Jaminet and Tandy advanced from fourth to third in the GTP Drivers' Championship.
