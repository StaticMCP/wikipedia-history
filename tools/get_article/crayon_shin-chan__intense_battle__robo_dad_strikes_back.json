It is the 22nd film of the popular comedy manga and anime series Crayon Shin-chan, released in Japanese theaters on 19 April 2014. It is directed by Wataru Takahashi and the script is written by Kazuki Nakashima of Kill la Kill. The story of the movie was published as manga in the October issue of Manga Town, with script written by Nakashima and art by Aiba Kenta. This film was nominated for the Japanese Media Arts Festival in the animation award category.\nThe films deals with the themes of humans being replaced by robots in Japan due to its declining population& rise of anti-feminism.\nPlot\nWhile playing with Shinnosuke \"Shin\" Nohara, Shin's father Hiroshi sprains his back. Desperate for treatment, Hiroshi accepts an invitation to a spa, which ends up transforming him into a robot. Despite initially disbelieving his identity, Hiroshi's wife, Misae eventually warms up to him while hiring private investigator Dandanbara Teruyo to track down the spa; Misae finally becomes convinced when Hiroshi rescues Shin and his friends during a field trip.\nOmega Ranran, who had earlier invited Hiroshi to the spa, gives Shin a mustache add-on for Hiroshi; when plugged in, Hiroshi (who was accustomed to suffering domestic violence committed upon him by his wife) suddenly turns furiously misogynistic and starts an antifeminist campaign consisting of fathers having similar grievances. Shinchan and his friends manage to remove the mustache, though Hiroshi is captured by Tekkenji Doukatsu, Ranran's leader. Shin follows him to his factory, where he discovers Hiroshi in his human form; Hiroshi realizes that his robot version is simply a clone that has his memories. Shinchan and both versions of Hiroshi successfully stop the campaign, during which Hiroshi's robot defeats Tekkenji.\nWhile both Hiroshis debate their real identity, the Noharas and Dandanbara are captured by Tekkenji, who is revealed to be a robot controlled by police chief Kuroiwa. Kuroiwa attributes his misogynistic attitude to years of abuse & neglect he endured from his own wife & daughter. Kuroiwa attempts to forcefeed Shinchan green bell-peppers (which he intensely dislikes) with Hiroshi's robot, though Shinchan manages to make Hiroshi's robot undo Kuroiwa's control. A battle ensues, extending from Kuroiwa's later-destroyed base to the construction site from Shinchan's earlier field trip, culminating in Shinchan and both Hiroshis teaming up to defeat Kuroiwa. After the battle, Dandanbara arrests Kuroiwa and Ganma for Offences they committed. After the human Hiroshi wins an arm wrestling match with his robot version, the latter succumbs to his wounds.\nCast\n* Akiko Yajima as Shinnosuke Nohara\n* Keiji Fujiwara as Hiroshi Nohara and Robot Hiroshi\n* Miki Narahashi as Misae Nohara\n* Satomi Korogi as Himawari Nohara\nGuest cast\n* Korokke as Ganma Hakase\n* Emi Takei as Dandanbara Teruyo\nMusic\nOpening theme song\n* \"Kimi ni 100 Percent\" (Warner Music Japan) by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu\nEnding theme song\n* \"Family Party\" (Warner Music Japan) by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu\nInternational release\nThe film premiered in India in 2015 as Shinchan Movie: Robot Dad on Hungama TV.\nReception\nThe film grossed a total of US$17,090,000 (JP¥1,820,000,000) in Japan.\nThis was the fourth-largest grossing Crayon Shin-chan film in Japan as of 2015, and the second-largest grossing since the first two films in 1992 and 1993.\nHome media\nThe DVD and Blu-ray was released on 7 November 2014, by Bandai Visual.\nSee also\n* Crayon Shin-chan\n* Yoshito Usui\nReferences"
