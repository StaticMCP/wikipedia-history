Mary was considered a sympathetic character in southern Europe due to her Catholicism.\nMary's story proved popular among liberals and revolutionaries in 19th-century Italy. These were especially attracted by the various plots made to save her as well as her death as a political martyr, both of which they interpreted as comparable to their own struggle. The Carbonari took their name from a mythical ring of English coal-burners, supposedly dedicated to Mary's cause. For this reason, the subject of Mary Stuart came to be seen as a concern of radicals, and operas about her were banned on several occasions.\nNineteenth-century operas about Mary include:\n* Luigi Carlini – Maria Stuarda, regina di Scozia (1818)\n* Pietro Casella – Maria Stuarda (1812)\n* Carlo Coccia – Maria Stuart, regina di Scozia (1827)\n* Gaetano Donizetti – Maria Stuarda (1835)\n* François-Joseph Fétis – Marie Stuart en Ecosse (1823)\n* Saverio Mercadante – Maria Stuarda, regina di Scozia (1825)\n* Louis Niedermeyer – Marie Stuart (1844), Paris\n*  – Maria Stuarda ossia I carbonari di Scozia (1816)\nTwentieth-century operas about Mary include:\n*Mary Carr Moore -  David Rizzio (completed in 1932, on an Italian libretto)\n*Thea Musgrave - Mary, Queen of Scots (premiered in 1977 in Edinburgh)\n*Bain Murray - ‘’Mary Stuart, A Queen Betrayed’’ (1991)\nRadio\n* Joan Crawford played Mary in the 10 March 1937 Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of the film Mary of Scotland, with Franchot Tone as Bothwell and Judith Anderson as Elizabeth.\n* Episode 14 of the Australian radio series Famous Escapes is \"Mary Queen of Scots Escapes from Prison\" (1945); the actress who played Mary is not currently known.\n* Another version of the Mary of Scotland play was broadcast on the Theatre Guild on the Air on 28 April 1946, starring Helen Hayes as Mary and Helen Menken as Elizabeth (both of whom had originally played their roles on Broadway).\n* On 10 June 1947 the radio series Favorite Story broadcast \"Mary Queen of Scots\", the \"favourite story\" of Bing Crosby, with Edna Best as Mary and Benita Hume as Elizabeth.\n* The CBS Radio series You Are There broadcast \"The Execution of Mary Queen of Scots\" on 27 June 1947, 27 June 1948 and 3 April 1949.\n* Meg Fraser played Mary twice in BBC Radio 3 productions, first in 2010 in Jo Clifford's adaptation of Madame de La Fayette's novel La Princesse de Cleves and then in 2012 in David Harrower's adaptation of Friedrich Schiller's play Mary Stuart.\n* A radio adaptation of Liz Lochhead's play Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 11 February 2001, with Gerda Stevenson as Mary, Siobhan Redmond as Elizabeth I, Bill Paterson as John Knox, and Myra McFadyen as Corbie.\n* Jeany Spark played Mary in Episode One, \"It Came In with a Lass\" (29 June 2013), of the first series of Mike Walker's BBC Radio 4's The Stuarts.\n* On 8 December 2018, BBC Radio 4 broadcast as part of their Unmade Movies series ''Alexander MacKendrick's Mary Queen of Scots, adapted from the original screenplay by Alexander MacKendrick and Jay Presson Allen, with Ellie Bamber as Mary and Glenda Jackson as The Narrator.\nTelevision\n* In the Channel 4 television miniseries, Elizabeth I (2005), the first two-hour segment partly centres around the conflict between Elizabeth and Mary (portrayed by Barbara Flynn), whose execution is graphically shown in a manner that is reportedly true to history.\n* In the Channel 5 television docudrama series Elizabeth I'' (2017), Mary is portrayed by Audrey L'Ebrellec.\n* The BBC-TV mini-series Elizabeth R (1971), episode 4: \"Horrible Conspiracies\", written by Hugh Whitemore, is a generally historically accurate portrayal of Mary (played by Vivian Pickles) during her captivity in England, from her imprisonment at Chartley under the guardianship of Sir Amyas Paulet through to her trial and execution, using many of Mary's own reported words as dialogue. It includes an accurate portrayal of her execution including her use of a red petticoat (red being the colour of martyrdom in the Catholic religion), her positioning of her head with her hands on the block, and the two blows and sawing motion it took to remove her head. It also shows the executioner unwittingly grasping and pulling away her wig to reveal her grey hair.\n* The BBC television miniseries Gunpowder, Treason & Plot (2004) dramatizes the reigns of Scottish monarchs Mary, Queen of Scots (played by French actress Clémence Poésy) and her son King James VI of Scotland, who became King James I of England and foiled the Gunpowder Plot.\n* In the CBBC sketch show Horrible Histories (2009–2015), Mary is portrayed by Martha Howe-Douglas and Jessica Ransom.\n* An episode of the British series Lovejoy (\"The Colour of Mary\", series 4) finds the main character seeking information and the whereabouts of Mary's pool table.\n* ''Monty Python's Flying Circus episode 22 (1970) features a skit involving the first two episodes of \"a new radio drama series: The Death of Mary Queen of Scots''\".\n* Lesley Smith, the curator of Tutbury Castle, portrayed Mary Queen of Scots for Living's Most Haunted in 2002 for a dramatic monologue of her time imprisoned there.

At court, Mary has to contend with the changing politics and power plays. Francis' mother, Queen Catherine de' Medici, is secretly trying to prevent the marriage due to the advice of Nostradamus, who had a vision that the wedding will lead to Francis' death. The series also follows the affairs of Mary's four Scottish handmaidens Lola, Kenna, Greer and Aylee (based on the queen's Scottish ladies-in-waiting, the four Maries - Mary Beaton, Mary Fleming, Mary Livingston, and Mary Seton), who are searching for husbands of their own at court.
