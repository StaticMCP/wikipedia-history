The first festival was held in 1993 by the initiation of James Tohara with the help of George Yoshida, Director of the Department of Parks & Recreation.\nBecause Waimea is located in a highland area with strong seasonal winds from the east, the branches of the cherry and other trees are blown to the west. In February 2023, the 30th festival was held, after three years of cancellation due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nGallery\nFile:Cherry blossoms in Waimea 3.jpg|Kanhi cherry trees in full bloom\nFile:Cherry blossoms in Waimea 1.jpg|Kanhi cherry trees in full bloom\nFile:Waimea Cherry Blossom Heritage Festival 1.jpg|The cherry and other trees are blown to the west because of strong east wind\nFile:Cherry blossoms in Waimea with Mauna Kea.jpg|With Mauna Kea with snow in February\nSee also\n*Mauna Kea\n*W.
