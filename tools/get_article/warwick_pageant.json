Parker, which took place in the grounds of Warwick Castle, England, in July 1906 and was later described as “the biggest thing which ever happened to Warwick”.\nDevelopment\nThe pageant was performed in the grounds of Warwick Castle, England, during the week of 2 to 7 July 1906 and was a major undertaking.  In 1905 the Warwick town authorities had approached Louis N. Parker (see below) and asked him to “add another triumph” to that which he had achieved with the Sherborne Pageant in Dorset, even though that one only used 820 performers.  The excuse for the Warwick Pageant was that it should celebrate “the Commemoration of the Thousandth Anniversary of the Conquest of Mercia by Queen Ethelfleda”.\nThe front cover of the original Pageant souvenir brochure\nIt was a leading principle that, as far as possible, everything used in the pageant should be designed and made in Warwick.  There were two thousand performers, and three hundred ladies made 1,400 of the costumes.  Forty amateur artists painted copies of mediaeval banners for Churches and Guilds, in addition to producing elaborate designs on materials for costumes.  Most of this work was done in a property in Jury Street, Warwick that became known as Pageant House, by which name it is still known today.  From the start it was to be “clearly understood that those participating in the Pageant as performers would do so anonymously”.\nA wooden grandstand was constructed which could hold an audience of 4,800 people.  It was designed to be “in one gentle slope at an angle that collects the sound waves and delivers them distinctly to the very back of the stand, which is 280 feet long”.\nLibrettist statement\nThe pageant secured almost universally ecstatic press reviews.  Louis N. Parker explained what inspired him:\nThe Performers\nAs explained above, the programme did not contain the names of the players, and their identities are only revealed in press reviews:\nThe Players: The following ladies and gentlemen played the leading parts:\nKymbeline:\t\tMr Holte\nCaradoc:\t\tMr Sutton\nEthelfleda:\t\tMiss Dickens\nPiers Gaveston:\tMr Rybot\nLancaster:\t\tMr Robb\nWarwick:\t\tMr H. Brown\nRoger de Newburgh: \tMr C. Brown\nGundrada:\t\tMiss Browne\nShakespeare:\t\tA boy from Stratford\nQueen Elizabeth:\tMrs H. Batchelor\nLeicester:\t\tEarl of Yarmouth\nThomas Fisher:\tMr Sam Browne\nMrs Tomas Fisher:\tMrs Sam Browne\nRecorder:\t\tMr Kemp (Mayor of Warwick)\nThere also took part in various episodes Lord and Lady Willoughby de Broke, Lady Heath, Lady Victoria de Trafford and the Rev Ralph Goodenough.\nThe Music\nWith the exception of the Carmen, sang while the boys of Warwick School were performing (which piece forms the school song to this day), all the music of the Pageant was composed by Allen K. Blackall, the music master at the King's County School in The Butts, organist of St Mary’s, later music master at Warwick School (1906–27) and Principal of the Birmingham School of Music from 1934 to 1945.  Warwick School possesses the autograph orchestral parts for the Pageant March, which is presumably the “Solemn March” which opened the proceedings each night, performed in 1906 by a “hidden orchestra” and also the Band of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment.\nThe Film\nTwo reels of a film of the pageant survive, and were copied into a 16mm format in 1957.  The contents of the film are given in the National Film Archive Catalogue:\nA record of the pageant held in the grounds of Warwick Castle in 1906, depicting incidents in Warwick history from AD40 to 1572.\nReel 1.

George Cattell Greenway became Town Clerk and a partner with his brother Kelynge Greenway, in Greenway, Smith and Greenways Bank; both were implicated in the bank’s spectacular failure in 1887 and served terms in jail. The house was on the market at the time of the Pageant, and No. 2 Jury Street was used in 1905 and 1906 for the purposes of the Pageant by the generosity of Sir E. Montague Nelson. Afterwards it was bought with the proceeds and presented to the town; it became the Pageant House and its enlarged garden, the Pageant Garden, is now a much valued green oasis in the town centre, and is widely used for wedding photographs.\nParker biography\nLouis Napoleon Parker was born in Calvados, France, of American parents in 1852. At the age of 17, he entered the Royal Academy of Music in London and was Director of Music at Sherborne School, Dorset from 1874 to 1892.  His first Pageant was held in the grounds of Sherborne Castle, in 1905, to celebrate “1,200 years of the town, the bishopric and the school”, followed by Warwick in 1906 and Bury St Edmunds in 1907. 1908 saw him in Dover, and in 1909 Colchester and York.  He announced in 1911 that more than 15,000 performers had gone through his hands, and audiences had reached a quarter of a million – and $75,000 had gone to charities…  After developing this hugely successful genre from nothing, he let others take over – indeed “Pageantitis” had swept over Britain, and rivals started their own shows, starting at Oxford in 1907. After about 1910 Louis N. Parker concentrated once more on being a playwright. In 1913 Emma Angeline Armstrong, a playwright from Minneapolis, brought a plagiarism charge in Federal Court against Parker, claiming that his pageant play Joseph and His Brethren was stolen from her play At the Foot of the Throne. He died in 1944, in Devon.\nReferences\nFootnotes\nSources\n* Warwick Advertiser - various issues from 1905-6 in Warwick School Archives\n* National Film Archive Catalogue\n* Pageant Brochure (1906) in Warwick School Archives\n* Pageant Libretto (1906) in Warwick School Archives"
