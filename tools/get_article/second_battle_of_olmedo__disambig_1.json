Fernando de Fonseca, fighting for Alfonso, was killed in this battle by Beltrán de la Cueva.\nThe battle was considered a stand-off and thus was considered a victory for Henry. However, after the battle, Henry lost the support of Pedro Arias de Ávila and of the Count of Alba, the latter won over by favours from the Marquess of Villena and from the Archbishop of Toledo.\nSee also\n*First Battle of Olmedo\nReferences\n*\n*"
