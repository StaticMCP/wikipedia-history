Sony's subsidiary Psygnosis released the game in North America.\nRosco McQueen, a firefighter, is the protagonist of the game and he is visible from a 3rd-person perspective. McQueen must stop the game's villain Sylvester T. Square and his robotic minions. The overall objective of the game is to put out all fires before the building burns down.\nIn the game, Rosco McQueen goes through 15 towering infernos, fighting fires along the way. During normal gameplay, McQueen puts out the fires with a hose attached to a carry-on waterpack and refills are gained by collecting water bottles. An axe is used to destroy robots, Deactivate Power Boxes, Activate switches and break down doors which hinder the path to the goal. The player must also watch out for the temperature: if it gets too hot, then the game ends.\nStephen McFarlane was the lead games designer for the project and also contributing to Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts later in his career.\nReception\n| CNG = 2/10\n| CP = 88%\n| EGM = 3.875/10\n| EPD = 7/10\n| Fam = 27/40\n| GI = 3/10\n| GameRev = D−\n| GSpot = 5/10\n| Hyper = 78%\n| IGN = 4.5/10\n| OPMUK = 7/10\n}}\nThe game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.
