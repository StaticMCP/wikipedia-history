It is described as an \"irreverent\" blend of \"history, nature footage, re-enactments and colorful testimony,\" documenting what is widely considered to be one of Australia's biggest environmental disasters through its effect on people.  It was filmed in 3D.\nPlot\nThe film combines old newsreels, nature footage featuring cane toads in action, re-enactments of toad-related events, and the first-hand accounts of people's interactions with the toads. The story begins with the toads in full form 15 million years ago, and fast-forwards to the 1935 introduction of 102 cane toads to Australia in an ill-conceived attempt to take on the cane beetle devastating sugarcane crops. The toads' proliferation got out of hand, and they became a seriously invasive species, marching across Australia, capturing huge swaths of territory over the decades. Various characters, including scientists, farmers, and everyday people, provide testimony about the creatures.\nProduction\nThe film was produced by Mark Lewis' independent Radio Pictures, based in Mullumbimby, Australia, in partnership with Americans Participant Media and Discovery Studios. It was shot in 3D with Silicon Imaging cameras.\nReception\nAccording to Box Office Mojo, the film has brought in under $100,000. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 16 reviews.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
