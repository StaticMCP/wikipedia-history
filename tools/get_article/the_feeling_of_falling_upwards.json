      "text": "# The Feeling of Falling Upwards\n\nThe Feeling of Falling Upwards (Live from the Royal Albert Hall) is the third live album by Australian pop-rock band 5 Seconds of Summer. The album was released digitally on 14 April 2023 and consists of 17 tracks recorded at Royal Albert Hall, London in September 2022.\nBackground\nThe album was recorded alongside a 12-piece string orchestra and a 12-member gospel choir during a special one-night-only concert 22 September 2022. The performance was live-streamed a day before the release of the band's fifth studio album, 5SOS5.\nDuring the performance, vocalist and drummer Ashton Irwin said \"The Feeling of Falling Upwards is simply supposed to describe to you the feeling that we have experienced together, the feeling of taking a leap of faith on such a fickle thing like music and sharing this experience together year after year, season after season of our lives. \"\nThe album was released digitally on 14 April 2023 and scheduled for physical release on 14 July 2023.\nCritical reception\nAmrit Virdi from Clash wrote: \"Framed as a musical journey across their 12-year discography, the excellent production and instrumentation truly makes you feel as if you were on the ride with them and emphasises how it is completely different to anything they’ve done before\". Adding, \"What makes this so unique compared to the band's other live albums is the impeccable addition of the House Gospel Choir and 12-piece string ensemble.\" Virdi concluded their review saying, \"5 Seconds Of Summer can firmly say that they've come far on their musical journey and are far from the poppy live shows they'd put on in 2014, growing to be a talented four-piece. If more orchestral live shows are to be put on by the band, I'll be there in the front row.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"Overture\" – 1:12\n# \"Complete Mess\" – 3:51\n# \"Carousel\" – 4:02\n# \"Me, Myself and I\" – 4:37\n# \"She Looks So Perfect\" – 3:13\n# \"Amnesia\" – 4:15\n# \"Lie to Me\" – 2:45\n# \"Caramel\" – 3:07\n# \"Outer Space\" / \"Carry On\" – 7:05\n# \"Youngblood\" – 3:55\n# \"Red Desert\" – 2:28\n# \"Jet Black Heart\" – 4:49\n# \"Older\" (featuring Sierra Deaton) – 3:41\n# \"Take My Hand\" – 5:11\n# \"Teeth\" – 3:39\n# \"Ghost of You\" – 6:38\n# \"Bad Omens\" – 4:50\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for The Feeling of Falling Upwards\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA)\n| 34\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| US Top Current Albums Sales (Billboard)\n| 25\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Release history and formats for The Feeling of Falling Upwards\n! scope=\"col\"| Country\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Edition(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n!
