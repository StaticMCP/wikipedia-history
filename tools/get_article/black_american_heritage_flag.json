Each color and symbol on the flag has a significant meaning that was developed to instill pride in Black Americans, and provide them with a symbol of hope for the future in the midst of their struggle for Civil Rights.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  | Color scheme\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100px\" |Color scheme\n!Red style=\"background:#b5191f|\n!Black style=\"background:#000000|\n!Gold style=\"background:#f0ac17|\n|-\n|CMYK\n|0-86-83-29\n|0-0-0-100\n|0-28-90-6\n|-\n|HEX\n|#b5sq1f\n|7\n|#f0ac17\n|-\n|RGB\n|181,25,31\n|0,0,0\n|243,174,24\n|}\n|}\nDesign\nMelvin Charles described the story behind the design of the Black American Heritage Flag and the historic event when it was raised at City Hall.\n\"We came up with this idea to make a flag that had diagonal stripes of red and black,\" he explained, \"and to have a fig wreath circled in the center of it, and a blunted sword. Of course, we had to recognize that each item, we had to have some sort of explanation.\"\nThe gold-colored blunted sword represent \"the feeling of having pride and also knowing, when you have a blunted sword, when you blunt it you learn to curdle the earth,\" he continued, \"the wreath, which we also had in the color gold\" symbolized peace, prosperity, and everlasting life. Red was chosen to represent the \"rich blood we shed for freedom, justice, and human dignity, and the color black was for the pride in our pigmentation.\"\nThere is also an alternative variation of the Black American Heritage Flag that possesses the same ideas and symbolisms as the original design of the Heritage Flag that Melvin Charles and Gleason Jackson set in place. The difference between the original version of the flag and the newer design is that it's more cartoonish and has a brighter set of colors. It is unclear from where the unauthorized Heritage flag design revision originated. However, it has somehow cemented itself as an alternative for the original, and authorized, Heritage Flag design. On September 12, 2023, countering the newer design of the Heritage Flag, Melvin Charles's daughter showed discontent with the new design on an Instagram post captioned:\n\"Please be mindful when you purchase Black American Heritage Flag products. In this 'grab and go' culture, many have not honored the original design.\"\nFollowed by images of the original design of the Heritage Flag titled: \"original design!!!\" and the new design of the flag titled: \"not the original\".\nHistory\nThe flag was created in 1967 by Melvin Charles and Gleason T. Jackson. The idea to create the flag came about during the civil rights era when Charles realized that every other group of people had a flag at parades except Black Americans. He saw how connected they were to their national flags, but did not feel the same connection towards the American flag due to the negative historical and political implication that the American flag held in the minds of Black American people. Creating a national flag was still just an idea in his mind until he pitched the idea to Gleason T. Jackson. He designed the flag alongside Jackson and they would later travel the country to visit various churches, schools, and public events to promote the flag.\nThe inspiration for the flag came from Melvin Charles and Gleason Jackson bouncing ideas off of each other and going to the library for extra inspiration for the flag's design and symbolism. The flag is said to have received some opposition from some people, but was eventually accepted and supported by the mayor, and was officially hoisted onto a flagpole at the city hall in Newark, New Jersey, on March 5, 1967. In December 1967, Charles and Jackson received acknowledgement of the flag from President Lyndon B. Johnson. The letter was signed by the Personal Secretary to the President of the United States. The Black church did not accept the flag as much, but most of Charles and Gleason's success came from contacting municipalities to showcase and spread the knowledge of the flag's existence.\nThe heavy usage and discussion of the Black American Heritage flag amidst the 2020 George Floyd protests eventually led to increased recognition of the flag and its colors all over the country. In August 2021, graphic designer Michael Randall (known as Mike Tré) recreated a more accurate and high-quality representation of the original flag as designed by Charles and Jackson. In September 2021, a popular half Black-American rapper named Saweetie attended the Met Gala and wore a custom Christian Cowan gown that showcased the colors of the Black American Heritage Flag alongside the colors of the Filipino flag to represent both parts of her multi-ethnic background. Keerah Yeowang wore the flag at the United States of America Ms.2022 pageant, in which she won the title.\nVariations\nThe Black American Heritage flag has another variation that is also widely popular as well; it includes a cartoonified version of the fig wreath and sword, with slight color alteration from the original design. There is some controversy when it comes to this cartoonified version of the flag, but many still use this version of the flag.\nCeremonial rites\nAfter a newspaper article was written in the local paper, Melvin and Gleason began to receive a lot of attention and interest from Black Americans in the community. They fell upon the realization that they had very little to offer people in terms of tangible information about the flag. They decided to create a brochure with information about the flag's design, meaning, and purpose. In Charles's book The Rallying Point, he described the process of creating the brochure that resulted in the creation of a pledge for the flag as a final touch.\n}}\nPledge\n\"I pledge my respect to the flag of the Black American and to the people it represents. I shall remain aware of the color red, being ever mindful that it represents the blood shed by our forefathers. The color black gives me pride and identity. I shall always remain true to the American ideal that all men are created equally.\"\nReferences"
