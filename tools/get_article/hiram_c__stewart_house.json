Maher located at 521 Grant Street in Wausau, Wisconsin. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 30, 1974.\nDescription and history\nStewart was a principal of Wausau's Barker and Stewart Lumber Company. In 1906, he had this house built from a design by Maher. It is generally Prairie Style, with horizontal lines and broad eaves. The exterior is stucco, and the interior is carefully designed too. Themes of a tulip and a tripartite arch repeat both inside and out, exemplifying Maher's \"motif rhythm theory\" of design.\nThe house currently serves as a bed and breakfast called the Stewart Inn.\nReferences"
