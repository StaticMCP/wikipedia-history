It stars Fares Fares as George Fahmy, an actor who is pressured to star in a propaganda film.\nThe film had its world premiere at the main competition of the 2025 Cannes Film Festival on 19 May, where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or. It was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 98th Academy Awards.\nPremise\nGeorge Fahmy, one of Egypt's most renowned actors, orders restaurant staff to remove a man observing him and his son Ramy. During a date with Donya, his much younger actress girlfriend, Fahmy is approached by a group including a woman named Suzanne and probed about his loyalty to Egypt and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\nFahmy is replaced in his current film project because of government censorship and his manager Fawzy informs him that the government wants him to star as the president in a new film. Fahmy declines because of the likelihood of whitewashing and because he is too tall. His colleague Rula declines to be pressured into denouncing him on television and Fahmy is stopped by armed men who threaten to kill his son. He goes to his estranged wife's apartment to check on Ramy and decides to take the role.\nAt the public unveiling of his casting, the man observing Fahmy is introduced to him as Mansour, a senior presidential aide overseeing the film. Fahmy is conflicted between wanting to convey the truth, to produce a great film, and to keep Mansour happy. Mansour reveals that Fahmy's home is bugged by repeating some acting advice he had given Donya, with whom he has become sexually impotent. At a dinner for officials involved with the film, Fahmy meets the Defence Minister and learns that he is Suzanne's husband. The military officials force Fahmy to agree to deliver a speech praising the president when he attends the Egyptian Military Academy for Armed Forces Day.\nFahmy is invited to a film industry red carpet and takes Ramy instead of Donya. He sees Suzanne and flirts with her, leading to a hotel tryst. When he returns home and isn't able to show any photos with Ramy, Donya reveals she knows about Suzanne, and leaves him.\nShooting on the film continues and Fahmy pleads Rula's case to be un-blacklisted with the Defense Minister. Mansour reveals that he knows about Suzanne's affair and that the minister is obsessed with Rula. He threatens Fahmy with a forged suicide note and requests that Rula to meet with the minister while wearing a wearing a wire. At the subsequent meeting, Mansour hears a scuffle break out.\nBefore Fahmy gives his speech at the military academy, an aide requests that he salute as he finishes. When Fahmy does so, several parade participants begin shooting to try and assassinate the president. Fahmy escapes onto a military helicopter, where Mansour interrogates some captives before throwing them off. The helicopter lands at a secure bunker, where they learn that Sisi is alive, the Republican Guard has suppressed the coup attempt and censored it from media, and that the Defence Minister is with the troops. Mansour reveals that the dinner Fahmy had attended with the minister had been a coup planning session and arrests all participants except for Fahmy.\nMansour orders a reluctant Fahmy to meet with Suzanne to determine if she was involved. Suzanne is confused when confronted and Fahmy warns her to flee the country and that they cannot meet again. On the way out, the Defence Minister intercepts Fahmy and Suzanne, tells the former that Rula died after a fall off a balcony, and orders Fahmy to lie to investigators about his involvement in the coup attempt under threat of killing his loved ones. Fahmy returns to his wife's apartment and finds that Ramy has been kidnapped before he is taken away by Mansour's men. Mansour tells Fahmy that Fawzy was killed and Fahmy tells Mansour that Suzanne is innocent, reveals the Defence Minister's request, and begs him to save Ramy. Mansour orders the minister's arrest based on this, reunites Fahmy with his son, and has the minister arrested and executed by firing squad. Some time later, the film is released and Fahmy joins some old men betting on horse racing.\nCast\n*Fares Fares as George Fahmy\n*Lyna Khoudri as Donya\n*Amr Waked as Dr. Mansour\n*Zineb Triki as Suzanne\n*Husam Chadat as General\n*Ahmed Khairy as Fawzy\n*Cherien Dabis as Rula\n*Donia Massoud as George's wife\n*Sherwan Haji as Yasser Islam\n*Tamim Heikal as Abu Talaat\n*Suhaib Nashwan as Ramy\n*Tamer Singer as Tarik-Abdalla\n*Ahmad Diab as Studio man\nProduction\nThe production received a €500,000 grant from Eurimages during its Project Evaluation Session of 2024.
