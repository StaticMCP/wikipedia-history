Rather than a rebel group in its own right, it was chiefly a coalition of different independent rebel groups including the Patriotic Resistance Front of Ituri (FRPI), Party for Unity and Safeguarding of the Integrity of Congo (PUSIC), Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC), Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI), Armed Forces of the Congolese People (FAPC), and the Rally for Congolese Democracy-KML (RCD-KML). It was led by Bwambale Kabolele and Bosco Ntaganda and received foreign support, probably from Uganda and Rwanda which were competing for influence in the eastern Congo at the time.\nThe MRC, along with the FNI and FRPI, agreed to a disarmament deal on 22 August 2007.\nSee also\n*Popular Front for Justice in Congo (FPJC) - another Ituri rebel coalition, between 2008 and 2010.\nCitations\n;References\nBibliography\n*"
