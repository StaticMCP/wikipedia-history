Afterwards, his grandson, urged by King Kawila, helped restore southern Lanna with the help of cousin King Taksin the Great of Thonburi.\nThe Chet Ton dynasty is noted for having formed ties with other older Lannanese dynasties such as the Mangrai and Chiengsaen dynasties of which King Mangrai the Great and Phya Ngammuang were respective members thereby incorporating them into the dynasty through marriage.\nMoreover, many female members of the Chet Ton dynasty intermarried with members of the Chakri dynasty; two such worth noting are Princess Sri Anocha, sister of King Kawila of Chiang Mai and wife of Maha Sura Singhanat who was the younger brother and right hand of the first monarch of the Chakri dynasty of Siam, and Princess Dara Rasmi, daughter of King Inthawichayanon of Chiang Mai and one of the princess consorts of Chulalongkorn, King Rama V of Siam. It is held that such a bond between the two dynasties, forged since the dawn of the Bangkok Era, proved to help ease the transition of Lanna into the lands of Siam proper.\nSeven lords of Thipchang\n# King Kawila (กาวิละ), 3rd Ruler of Lampang and 1st Ruler of Chiangmai\n# Prince Khamsom (คำสม), 4th Ruler of Lampang\n# Prince Thammalangka (ธัมลังกา), 2nd Ruler of Chiangmai\n# King Duangthip (ดวงทิพย์), 5th Ruler of Lampang\n# Uparaj Moolah (หมูหล้า), Viceroy of Lampang\n# Prince Khamfan (คำฟั่น), 1st Ruler of Lamphun and 3rd Ruler of Chiangmai\n# King Boonma (บุญมา), 2nd Ruler of Lamphun\nReferences\n*The Chronicles of Chiang Mai Ed.2, trans.
