The museum serves as the National Headquarters for the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW).\nHistory\nFormer Harrisburg mayor Stephen R. Reed supported the museum's development, which cost $32 million. The museum is privately owned and opened to the public in 2001. In 2015, the museum published a book about U.S. General Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. In 2009, the museum affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.\nLocation\nThe museum is located in a two-story brick building in Harrisburg's Reservoir Park in the Allison Hill neighborhood. The exhibits and self-guided tour begin on the museum's second floor (first ten galleries) and continue on the first floor (last seven galleries and theater). A gift shop, temporary exhibit gallery, and museum support are on the first floor. A \"Walk of Valor\" consisting of red bricks bearing the names of Civil War veterans contributes to the museum's memorial-like grounds.\nExhibits\nThe museum's exhibits are designed to \"inspire lifelong learning of the American Civil War through the preservation and balanced presentation of the American peoples' struggles for survival and healing\". The exhibition covers from 1850 to 1876, focusing on the Civil War years of 1861 to 1865. The City of Harrisburg acquired most of the over 24,000 artifacts, photographs, documents, manuscripts, and other printed matter between 1994 and 1999. Three-dimensional objects (artifacts) comprise about 3,500 items, of which one-fourth (850 items) are on display in the permanent galleries of the building. The balance is held in secure storage for future exhibits and scholarly research, reserved for Museum members and by appointment only.\nThe museum's galleries are as follows:\n# A House Divided, 1850&ndash;1860 (examines the events leading up to the Civil War); Highlights a speech Abraham Lincoln gave in Washington D.C. in 1860, in which he claimed that a house divided could not stand.\n# American Slavery: The Peculiar Institution, 1850&ndash;1860 (how nineteenth-century Americans saw slavery);\n# First Shots, April 1861 (Fort Sumter); The first battle and start of the war\n# Making of Armies (recruiting, training, and equipping both armies);\n# Weapons and Equipment (with many artifacts); Disease continued to cause most war deaths, but conscription and massive armies, more powerful and accurate weapons, and civilian targets increased casualties in the mid-1800 conflicts and later wars.\n# Campaigns and Battles of 1861–1862 (early campaigns and the tactics, strategies. and logistics);\n# Battle Map, 1861&ndash;1862 (emphasis on how geography and topography affected troop movements);\n# Camp Curtin (the Civil War's largest Union camp, located in Harrisburg);\n# Why Men Fought, 1861&ndash;1863 (motivations of soldiers on both sides);\n# Civil War Music (displays of musical instruments and recorded music to listen to);\n# Gettysburg, 1863 (a turning point of the American Civil War); Total casualties of nearly 50,000 men made it the largest battle ever on North American soil\n# Women in the War (women's various roles);\n# Navy (focuses on maritime engagements);\n# Campaigns and Battles of 1864&ndash;1865 (the last years of the Civil War);\n# Battle Map, 1863–1865 (from Stones River to Appomattox);\n# Lincoln: War & Remembrance (remembering the Civil War, Lincoln, and veterans' roles after the war)\nA video, We the People, focuses on ten characters from all walks of life and their fates before, during, and after the war. It is presented in segments in galleries 1, 4, 9, and 14 and concludes in the theater.\nArtifacts\nThe museum contains many original artifacts, including weapons, uniforms, camp and personal effects, and similar items.
