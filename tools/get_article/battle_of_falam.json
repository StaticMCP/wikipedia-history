The battle was reported to be the first major battle resulting in the capture of a town without on-the-ground participation from ethnic armed organizations established before the 2021 phase of the civil war.\nBackground\nFalam is the second-largest city in Chin State and a former state capital. It is strategically located on the route between the junta’s Regional Operations Command in Kale (Sagaing Region) and Hakha (Chin State).\nBy late 2024, rebels claimed control of approximately 85% of Chin State, with Falam remaining one of the last junta strongholds in the region.\nBattle\nThe battle began on November 9, 2024 when the Chin Brotherhood Alliance, comprising the Zomi Federal Union, Chin National Organization, Mindat Chin National Council, Maraland and Kampelet Chin Defense Forces, and Matupi CDF Brigade 1, launched Operation Chin Brotherhood.\nThe CNDF which is a component of the CBA is also engaged and is supported by allied resistance groups, including units reportedly assisted by the Arakan Army (AA) from Rakhine State.\nOn November 9, CBA forces launched coordinated attacks on junta strongholds in Falam, targeting the police station, General Administration Department, Department of Construction, and Hospital Hill. The rebels also blockaded supply routes to the town, effectively isolating Infantry Battalion 268. In response, the junta carried out heavy airstrikes, using warplanes, drones, and artillery to defend its positions.\nBy mid-November, the CBA had taken control of the police station and administrative offices, leaving Battalion 268 as the last significant junta holdout. Around 45 junta soldiers surrendered during this phase, and the rebels have captured approximately 130 prisoners of war since the offensive began.\nResidents reported that the junta’s air force dropped over 150 bombs on Falam on a single day (Saturday) in mid-November, targeting rebel positions and civilian areas. Over the course of a week, the total number of bombs dropped exceeded 500. A Christian church in nearby Thalanzar village was damanged and over 10,000 residents were displaced to nearby villages, Kalay Township, Yangon, and India’s Mizoram state.\nBy December 2024, the CBA claimed to have seized 90% of Falam Township, with junta forces confined to Battalion 268.\nOn March 11, 2025, the junta launched a counteroffensive to break the siege, sending 40–50 soldiers to reinforce Battalion 268. The CNDF reported that the junta’s reliance on airstrikes showed its inability to mount effective ground operations due to depleted ranks and low morale.\nOn April 8, 2025, the Chin Brotherhood Alliance and allied forces succeeded to captured Infantry Battalion 268 (IB-268), the last remaining junta stronghold in Falam.\nAftermath\nThe junta responded to the capture by deploying daily airstrikes with various aircraft, such as jet fighters and Mi-35 helicopters, to regain control over Falam but failed.\nSee also\n* Ngape clashes\n* Battle of Maungdaw\n* Battle of Laukkai\nReferences"
