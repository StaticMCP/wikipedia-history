More than 44,000 soldiers are buried here. The village was the scene of the first poison gas attacks by the Imperial German Army in the Western Front ([http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/flanders/images/lang/langemarkmap.gif see trench map]), marking the beginning of the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915.\nDuring the First Battle of Ypres (1914) in World War I, poorly trained and inexperienced German infantrymen suffered severe casualties when they made a futile frontal attack on allied positions near Langemark and were checked by experienced French Poilus and British Tommies. Contrary to popular belief, only fifteen percent of the German soldiers involved in the Battle of Langemark were schoolboys or students. Legend has it that the German infantry sang the first stanza of what later (1919) became the national anthem of the Weimar Republic; \"Deutschland, Deutschland über alles\", as they charged.\nThe cemetery, which evolved from a small group of graves from 1915, has seen numerous changes and extensions. It was dedicated in 1932. Today, visitors find a mass grave near the entrance. This '''comrades' grave' contains 24,917 servicemen, including the World War I flying ace Werner Voss. Between the oak trees, next to this mass grave, are another 10,143 soldiers (including 2 British soldiers killed in 1918).  The 3,000 school students who were killed during the First Battle of Ypres are buried in a third part of the cemetery. At the front of the cemetery is a sculpture of four mourning figures by Professor Emil Krieger. The group was added in 1956, and is said to stand guard over the fallen. The cemetery is maintained by the German War Graves Commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge''.\nIn September 2008, last British Army World War I combat veteran Harry Patch visited the Langemark cemetery and laid a memorial wreath on the grave of an Imperial German Army soldier who was killed in action on 16 August 1917; the day Private Patch's Division had attacked and taken the village of Langemarck during the Battle of Passchendaele. Noticing three acorns nesting beside the German soldier's gravestone, Patch picked them up, brought them back to England, and planted the acorns beside the Fletcher House nursing home, where he lived in Wells, Somerset.\nOn 22 May 2009, an all-Flemish band performed the traditional German soldiers' lament ''Ich hatt' einen Kameraden'' on the Great Highland bagpipes and drums during a joint Belgian, British, and German memorial ceremony at the Langemark German war cemetery. Afterwards, the attendees socialized peacefully together at a nearby village pub.\nGallery\nFile:Langemark mass grave marker.jpg|This wreath marks the largest mass grave.\nFile:Langemark unknown soldier stone.jpg|Individual marker of four unknown soldiers.\nFile:Langemark german cemetery burial key.jpg|This map is a key to World War I German soldier burial sites in Belgium, located in the entrance block.\nFile:Langemark wall of student names.jpg|One wall listing the names of the 3,000 German students killed during the First Battle of Ypres, inside the entrance block.\nFile:Langemark flat grave markers.jpg|Flat grave markers.\nFile:Langemark basalt crosses ceramic poppies.jpg|For the 100th anniversary commemoration of World War I, many cemeteries and other sites have had ceramic poppies installed.\nFile:Langemark German Cemetery memorial.jpg|A section of the memorial wall to the victims of the massacre of the Innocents.\nFile:Langemark German war cemetery 01.jpg|2 plaques in the Langemark German cemetery\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* (de) [http://www.volksbund.de/kriegsgraeberstaetten.html?stadt=501 Langemark cemetery at Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgraeberfuersorge > Weiterlesen]\n* (nl) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110812043339/http://www.wo1.be/ned/database/dbDetail.asp?TypeID=6&SubTypeID=21&ItemID=5772 Langemark at wo1.be]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncS3Vrqz9AU YouTube video made at Langemark]"
