Following his 1992 independent candidacy, which attracted nearly 20% of the popular vote, Perot announced the formation of the Reform Party in 1995. Perot ran for president in 1996, and defeated former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm in the Reform Party primaries. On September 11, 1996, Perot announced his choice of economics professor Pat Choate as his running mate. Perot and Choate had previously co-authored the book Save Your Job, Save Our Country, which argued against the ratification of NAFTA. The Perot–Choate ticket took 8.4% of the popular vote in the 1996 election.\nMedia speculation of vice presidential candidates\nFile:Richard Lamm.jpg|alt=|}}\nFile:No image available 450 x 600.svg|alt=|\nDeclined\nFile:Senator David Boren (cropped).jpg|alt=|}}\nFile:Marcy Kaptur 105th Congress 1997.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Linda Smith.jpg|alt=|}}\nSee also\n*1996 United States presidential election\n*Ross Perot 1996 presidential campaign\n*1996 Reform Party presidential primaries\nReferences"
