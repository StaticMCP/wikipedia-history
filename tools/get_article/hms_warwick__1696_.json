The Warwick was built by Robert and John Castle at their Deptford shipyard and launched on 20 August 1696.\nOn 3 May 1709 she was ordered to be rebuilt according to the 1706 Establishment, and a contract for this was agreed on 9 May with shipbuilder Richard Burchett at Rotherhithe; after the work was completed, she was re-launched on 9 January 1711. She undertook a voyage to Newfoundland (under Captain Henry Partington) as escort to a merchant convoy; on her return she was fitted at Woolwich Dockyard for a voyage to \"the South Seas\" (Buenos Aires), and on return to Woolwich she underwent a Great Repair between November 1716 and July 1717. She was recommissioned in 1720 for service in the Baltic Sea (under Captain Thomas Willyams). The Warwick was docked to be broken up at Plymouth Dockyard on 20 December 1726.\nNotes\nReferences\n*Lavery, Brian (1983) The Ship of the Line – Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650-1850.
