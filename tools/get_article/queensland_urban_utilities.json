The shareholders of the statutory authority are the councils of Brisbane, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Scenic Rim, and Somerset.\nFunction and activities\nThe authority was formed of 1 July 2010 when it assumed the functions of Brisbane Water, a government business enterprise that was owned and managed by the Brisbane City Council, together with the merging of water assets from the four other member local government authorities. At the time, the 4.3&nbsp;billion merger was the largest water transaction and second largest infrastructure transaction in Australian history.\nUU services over a quarter of Queensland's total population.\nRelated organisations are Unitywater (Moreton Bay, Sunshine Coast and Noosa), Logan City Council (Logan Water), Redland City Council (Redland Water), and Gold Coast City Council.  Allconnex Water supplied Logan, Redland and Gold Coast, until 30 June 2012.\nSee also\n* Queensland Water Commission\n* Seqwater\n* Water security in Australia\n* Water supply and sanitation in Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.urbanutilities.com.au/ Official website]"
