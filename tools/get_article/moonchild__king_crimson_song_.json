Robert Fripp plays a snippet of \"The Surrey With the Fringe on Top\" (from Rodgers & Hammerstein's \"Oklahoma!\") in this section. In the 2009 remix of the album, the track was edited by Fripp and colleague Steven Wilson, with around 2.30 minutes of the original improvisation (the reference by Fripp to \"The Surrey With the Fringe on Top\") being removed. This issue of the album does, however, offer the original version as a bonus track.\nThe song contains drummer Michael Giles performing a unique alternation between the ride cymbals, which was praised by music critics and writers. The song was described as a \"space jam.\" Giles describes the radical \"Moonchild\" as \"an opportunity. We had recorded the material that we wanted to be on the album, so we thought, why not record something that is not improvisation in a jazz way, but is free of structure? You are just dealing with time and space. Music, of all the art forms, is just abstract; you can't pick it up or hold it, or put it on the wall. We started off with this little ditty and then we just took off into outer space, into nothingness, to see what happened. If it had been rubbish we wouldn't have left it on there. I keep looking at the other side of things. What about if we ''hadn't done it? What about if it wasn't there?\"\n\"What is rarely ever mentioned about In the Court of the Crimson King is that a quarter of its running time is given over to free improvisation,\" writes Mike Barnes in his book A New Day Yesterday: UK Progressive Rock & the 70s'' (2020), adding: Moonchild' rarely got more than a passing mention in contemporary reviews and is still barely mentioned in more recent commentaries. One gets the feeling that it was a track that some listeners would skip – in the way that Beatles fans might have passed on 'Revolution 9' – but in its own contemplative way, 'Moonchild' was both beautifully played and the most adventurous track by a British rock group to date.\"\nThe song was used in the 1998 movie ''Buffalo '66'', in the scene in which Christina Ricci tap dances at the bowling alley.\nPersonnel\n*Robert Fripp – electric guitar\n*Ian McDonald – Mellotron, vibraphone, woodwind\n*Greg Lake – vocals\n*Michael Giles – drums, percussion\n*Peter Sinfield – lyrics\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nhe:In the Court of the Crimson King#Moonchild"
