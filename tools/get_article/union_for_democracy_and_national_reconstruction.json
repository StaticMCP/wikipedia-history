The three parties received 8% of the vote and won six of the 64 seats in the National Assembly.\nThe alliance split prior to the 1995 elections, with the MNDD running alone and the other two remaining in an alliance. Although the MNDD won a single seat with 2% of the vote, the MSUP–UDRN alliance received only 1% of the vote and failed to win a seat. MSUP leader Djamiou attempted to sought to have the election results in Cotonou overturned in the Constitutional Court, but his case was deemed inadmissible.\nIn the 1999 elections it was part of the Suru Alliance, which won one seat.\nReferences"
