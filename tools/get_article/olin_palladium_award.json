      "text": "# Olin Palladium Award\n\nThe Olin Palladium Award (formerly the Palladium Medal Award) was established by The Electrochemical Society (ECS) in 1950 and is presented every 2 years to recognize outstanding contributions to the fundamental understanding of all types of electrochemical and corrosion phenomena and processes.\nThe award consists of a uniquely designed palladium medal bearing the medalist’s name. The design of the medal depicts Pallas Athene employing a shield, on which the seal of the Society is inscribed, to protect the metals represented by ancient symbols from the elements, earth, air, fire, and water. Recipients are also presented with a wall plaque, cash prize, Electrochemical Society Life membership, and a free meeting registration.\nHistory\nThe Palladium Medal Award was initially funded by the royalties derived from the sales of the Corrosion Handbook and a gift of palladium metal from the International Nickel Company. The original purpose of the medal was to encourage research and achievement in the study of the corrosion of metals and its control, or in theoretical electrochemistry upon which the understanding of corrosion is based.\nIn 1971 the scope was modified, and in 1977 the name was changed to The Olin Palladium Award after a generous endowment from the Olin Company.\nRecipients\nAs listed by ECS:\n* 2023 Jeff Dahn\n* 2021 Gerald Frankel\n* 2019 Shimshon Gottesfeld\n* 2017 Philippe Marcus\n* 2015 Digby MacDonald\n* 2013 Ralph E.
