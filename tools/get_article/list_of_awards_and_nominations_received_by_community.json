Among the main cast, McHale and Pudi were the most nominated individuals with seven nominations each; McHale won two awards and Pudi won one. Several episodes, including \"Introduction to Statistics\", \"Modern Warfare\", \"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\", and \"Remedial Chaos Theory\", received individual nominations for awards. Some commentators have considered the show's relative lack of awards recognition at the Emmys to be a snub.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%\" summary=\"Eleven wins and forty-seven nominations\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3%;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:33%;\"| Category\n!
