The award was presented for the first time on February 5, 2023, at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.\nThe Academy announced the new category (as part of the American Roots Music genre field) in June 2022, stating that the award goes to \"a track or single performance that recognizes artistic excellence in an Americana recording by a solo artist, collaborating artists, established duo, or established group\". The category \"recognizes excellence in performances of Americana music: contemporary music that incorporates elements of various American roots music and vocal styles, including country, roots rock, folk, bluegrass, R&B, and blues, resulting in a distinctive roots-oriented sound that lives in a world apart from the pure forms of the genres upon which it may draw.\". The award sits together with other American Roots-themed awards such as Best American Roots Song, Best Americana Album and Best American Roots Performance.\nThe inaugural recipient of the award is Bonnie Raitt, who won for her song \"Made Up Mind\".\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Recipients\n!Work\n!Nominees\n!Ref.\n|-\n! 2023\n|Bonnie Raitt\n| \"Made Up Mind\"\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2024\n|Brandy Clark featuring Brandi Carlile\n| \"Dear Insecurity\"\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2025\n| Sierra Ferrell\n| \"American Dreaming\"\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2026\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nReferences"
