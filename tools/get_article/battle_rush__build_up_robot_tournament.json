      "text": "# Battle Rush: Build Up Robot Tournament\n\n|released =\n|genre = Action\n|modes = Single-player\n|platforms = Datach Joint ROM System\n}}\nis a Japan-exclusive video game for the Datach Joint ROM System add-on for the Family Computer. The game was one of six that required Bandai's  system in order to operate.\nGameplay\nPlayers build their own combat robots to use in a fighting tournament. These robots are built in factories that assign the robot a name in addition to installing its head, body, shoulder, and feet. The player has a pre-game lobby to get ready for the robot combat action. All matches have rounds of 60 seconds (unlike the 99-second round of most modern fighting video games). Both robots have a separate gauge for energy and damage. Standard punches and kicks can be thrown in addition to special moves (which look like ammunition).\nReception\nOn release, Famicom Tsūshin scored the game a 16 out of 40.\nReferences"
