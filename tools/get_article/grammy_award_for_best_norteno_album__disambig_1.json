The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nPrior to the establishment of the Best Norteño Album category, norteño recordings were eligible to compete in the Best Mexican/Mexican American Album category. The award was discontinued from 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. In 2011, the Recording Academy announced the retirement of the award category. Beginning in 2012, norteño recordings will be eligible for the newly formed Grammy Award for Best Banda or Norteño Album category.\nBackground\nPrior to the establishment of the Best Norteño Album category, norteño recordings were eligible to compete in the Best Mexican/Mexican American Album category.
