      "text": "# Alyosha Monument, Plovdiv\n\nAlyosha Monument}}\nAlyosha (an affectionate diminutive of Aleksey) is an  tall reinforced concrete statue of a Soviet soldier on Bunarjik Hill in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The statue tops a  pedestal lined with granite. The memorial commemorates Soviet casualties incurred during the Germany occupation of Bulgaria (which had been an Axis ally) in World War II. It was installed in 1954-57.\n\"Alyosha\" is also the name of Konstantin Vanshenkin and Eduard Kolmanovski's song that was adopted as Plovdiv's official anthem until 1989. A well-known poem about the Plovdiv Soldier was written by Robert Rozhdestvensky.\nPlovdiv authorities sought to have the statue removed on at least two occasions, in 1989 and 1996. The 1989 decision led to a preservation campaign which included a guard by the statue day and night in order to prevent it from being demolished.\nAlyosha Skurlatov, a soldier of the 3rd Ukrainian Front who served as the model for this statue, died in 2013 at the age of 91.\nReferences\nNotes"
