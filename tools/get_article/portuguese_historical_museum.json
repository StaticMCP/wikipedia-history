It is one of the featured attractions within History Park at Kelley Park.\nExhibits start with Portugal as it was during the period of European colonization of the Americas and Portuguese immigration throughout the world, and it then narrows the focus to Portuguese immigration to the United States, then to California, and finally settling in the Santa Clara Valley.\nReferences\n*[http://www.portuguesemuseum.org/ Portuguese Heritage Society of California Website]\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041216173436/http://www.historysanjose.org/visiting_hsj/buildings/history_park/map.html Map of History Park at Kelley Park, showing location of the museum (labeled \"Portuguese Imperio\") at the History San Jose Website]"
