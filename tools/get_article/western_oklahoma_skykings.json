Hamd is the founder of Brookwood Capital Advisors, a real estate investment company that redevelops properties across the U.S., including Wichita, Kansas. According to Hamd, the team's name is a nod to Wichita's aviation history as birthplace of Cessna Aircraft Company, now owned by Textron. The name \"Sky Kings\" derives from 1950's radio-turned TV show Sky King about a Cessna aircraft pilot of the same name.\nSean Flynn was named as head coach for the Sky Kings' debut season. Flynn was head coach for the Pratt Community College Beavers from 2018 to 2021 where he held a 44 and 40 record.
