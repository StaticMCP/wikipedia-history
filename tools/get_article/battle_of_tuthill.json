Glyndŵr's success at the Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen the previous June had provided the revolt with fresh impetus, and the battle may be seen as indicative of his determination to foster revolt in the north-west after months of relative inaction in that area.\nGlyndŵr flew a flag bearing a golden dragon on a white field, recalling the symbolism of Uther Pendragon. At this time in his campaign, his ideas seemed to have been grounded in the legendary traditions of Geoffrey of Monmouth and Nennius, as represented by this flag. His letters to the Scottish and Irish at this time also show his heavy influence by such mythical traditions. Nevertheless, he would soon adopt instead the colours of the House of Gwynedd more commonly associated with him. These latter arms asserted his more pragmatic claim to be in the line of the last native princes of Wales.\nLittle is known of the battle. Adam of Usk says of it:\nThat is:\nIntending to lay siege to Caernarvon, Owen raised his standard, a golden dragon on a white field, in the midst of a great host there on the morrow of All Saints [2 November]; following an assault by the defenders, however, in which three hundred of his men were killed, he was driven off.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
