In the , Elgin Vale had \"no people or a very low population\".\nGeography\nTinglemara is neighbourhood in the west of the locality ().\nHistory\nIn 1847 John Mortimer selected Manumbar, a  holding between Nanango and present day Goomeri, which included the site of the Elgin Vale sawmill.\nWhen land was resumed from the Gallangowan run of Manumbar in 1878,  were set aside for a Camping and Water Reserve (R.81) at the confluence of the Gallangowan and Moonda-Waamba Creeks. It was on Mortimer's recommendation that this area was gazetted, as it was the only permanent source of water in the locality. In 1879,  Messrs J & A Porter took up much of the surrounding land, constructing a homestead \"Elgin Vale\" in close proximity to the reserve.\nElgin Vale Provisional School opened in May 1899 and closed in 1905.\nThe first sawmill located on Camping and Water Reserve 81, (also known as Scrubby Paddock), was established by Ross and Company in 1908. This operation is thought to have moved to Goomeri in 1914.\nDuring 1926–27, Thomas Herbert (Harry) Spencer established a new sawmill at Elgin Vale, by relocating his sawmill at Sefton (north of Kilkivan) to the reserve. Commercial processing of timber was underway by late 1927.\nThe establishment of the sawmill brought workers and their families to the area. The second Elgin Vale Provisional School opened on 24 January 1927, becoming Elgin Vale State School in 1948. It was at 2876 Manumbar Road () adjacent to the sawmill. The school closed on 10 August 1979. In 1982, the school building was bought by the Elgin Vale branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association.\nThe sawmill was bought and sold over the years, but, by 1986, there was not sufficient timber in the local area to keep the mill viable. The Elgin Vale sawmill ceased operating as a commercial venture on 16 March 1987.\nDemographics\nIn the , Elgin Vale had a population of 24 people.\nIn the , Elgin Vale had \"no people or a very low population\".\nHeritage listings\nElgin Vale has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Elgin Vale Sawmill, Manumbar Road ()\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Elgin Vale.
