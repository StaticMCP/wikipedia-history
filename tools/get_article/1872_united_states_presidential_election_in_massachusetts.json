All contemporary 37 states were part of the 1872 United States presidential election. The state voters chose 13 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nMassachusetts was won by the Republican nominees, incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant of Illinois and his running mate Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts. Grant and Wilson defeated the Liberal Republican and Democratic nominees, former Congressman Horace Greeley of New York and his running mate former Senator and Governor Benjamin Gratz Brown of Missouri by a margin of 38.51%.\nWith 69.20% of the popular vote, Massachusetts would be Grant's fifth strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote after Vermont, South Carolina, Rhode Island and Nebraska.\nThis is the last election in which Brighton, Charlestown, and West Roxbury voted in, as all three were annexed by the city of Boston in 1873.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Massachusetts\nReferences"
