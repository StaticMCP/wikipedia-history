He was the second son of James Grimston, 1st Earl of Verulam and Lady Charlotte Jenkinson (a daughter of Charles Jenkinson, 1st Earl of Liverpool).  Three of his brothers James, Robert and Francis all played first-class cricket, as did his son Walter and his nephew Lord Hyde.\nGrimston played in 30 first-class cricket matches between 1832 and 1849, mainly for Oxford University and MCC. He was a right-handed batsman and an underarm medium pace bowler.\nCareer\nGrimston was elected at the 1835 general election as one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for the borough of St Albans in Hertfordshire. He was re-elected in 1837, but resigned his seat in 1841 by the procedural device of appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds.\nReligious career\nAfter resigning his parliamentary seat, Grimston took holy orders and was rector of Pebmarsh (a parish of which his father was patron) from 1841 until his death in 1881.\nPersonal life\nOn 15 June 1842, Grimston was married to Frances Horatia Morier (1815–1906), a daughter of diplomat John Philip Morier and Horatia Maria Frances Seymour (eldest daughter of Lord Hugh Seymour, the youngest son of the 1st Marquess of Hertford). Among her six sisters was Katherine Georgina Morier, who married his brother (the Rev. Hon. Francis Sylvester Grimston), and Horatia Isabella Harriet Morier, who married Algernon St Maur, 14th Duke of Somerset.
