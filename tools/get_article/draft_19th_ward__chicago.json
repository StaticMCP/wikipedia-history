Haberkorn of the ward was hospitalized after being shot. The following week, John P. Harding (the ward's Democratic committeeman) was hospitalized after being near-fatally shot by John I. Maloney (and 8th ward Democratic politician). Maloney faulted his actions in shooting Harding (a tavern owner) on impaired judgement due to intoxication.\n1900s\nhttps://chicagology.com/goldenage/wardsofchicagopart10/\n1910s\nBy the 1910s, the ethnic makeup of the ward had begun to change. The ward had gone from once being 90% ethnically Irish, it to only 50% percent Irish. The remainder of the ward population population was (for the most part) Italian and Jewish immigrant populations.\nAldermen's wars\n1920s\nWhen Chicago annexed Mount Greenwood in 1927, it was added to the 19th ward. As these annexed additions came without citywide redistricting made the wards, this made the ward malpportioned, having a larger populace than most other Chicago wards.\nThe city's 1929 contest (an open seat after incumbent Donald S. McKinlay (a Democrat) resigned to accept a judgeship) saw the city break from its conventionally Democratic voting pattern. O.E. Northrup (a Republican) won the election, listed as an independent and carrying McKinlay's endorsement. Northrup only represented the council seat for a single term before it was returned to the Democratic Party\n1930s\nAfter the 1930 United States Census, the ward's boundaries were redrawn. The Ridge area north of 87th street was removed from the ward and added to the neighboring 18th ward, and the Brainerd neighborhood was removed from the ward and added to neighboring 17th ward.\nAfter the end of prohibition in December 1933 with the ratification of the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution, all of Illinois became \"wet\" (permitting the sale of alcoholic beverages). Several taverns opened in the ward on 95th Street and on the eastern side of Western Avenue. However, the Illinois Liquor Control Act of 1934 allowed for election precincts  to vote to become \"dry\" territories prohibiting alcohol sales. Soon after, most Beverly and Morgan Park precincts in the area bounded by 89th Street, Western Avenue, 119th Street and the tracks of the Rock Island Railroad voted to become dry. Precincts in other parts of the ward also voted to become dry. This forced the aforementioned bars that had opened to close.\nFor decades precincts in  \"Ridge\" area of the ward had voted Republican. However, the 1930s and 1940s began to evidence a transition towards Democratic Party support in these precincts.\n1940s\nAfter the [[1940 United States Census], the ward was due to be redistricted. However, matching the actions of the malapportioned Illinois State Legislature (which had not been redistricted since 1901, maintaining a map malapportioned in the Republican Party's favor), the Chicago City Council's members decided to ignore the law and postpone redistricting. Chicago alderman declared that they would not redistrict until the state legislature did. While the state did not cave, the Chicago City Council did and adopted a new map in 1947 that made no significant change to the boundaries of the 19th ward.\nIn 1946, a referendum was presented to voters in an attempt to make precincts in the area bounded by Western Avenue, 99th Street, California Avenue, and 119th Street become \"dry\" areas, expanding the areas of the ward in which the sale of alcohol was prohibited. This referendum was defeated.\n1950s\n1960s\n1970s\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010s\nIn 2016, the Chicago Republican Party removed the 19th ward's recently-elected Republican committeeman, Steven Graves, from his position because he had voted on a Democratic primary ballot within the previous eight years. The party had adopted a rule six days before the committeemen elections prohibiting someone from serving as a committeeman if they had voted in another party's primary within the previous eight years.\nIn the preliminary round of the 2019 mayoral election, Jerry Joyce (son of former 19th ward alderman Jeremiah E. Joyce) received his greatest support from the 19th ward, where he placed first among candidates with 43.55% of the ward's votes. The ward was one of only four wards in which he led all other candidates. In the preliminary round, William M. Daley (son of former mayor Richard J. Daley and brother of former mayor Richard M. Daley) placed second in the 19th ward, with 10.21% of the vote; Paul Vallas placed third with 9.48% of the vote; Lori Lightfoot placed fourth with 8.48% of the vote; Toni Preckwinkle placed fifth with 8.08% of the vote; and Willie Wilson placed sixth with 5.05%\tof the vote.\nAhead of the runoff, Jerry Joyce, endorsed Lightfoot, as did 19th ward alderman O'Shea. Lightfoot won a citywide landslide victory in the runoff election, and in the 19th ward _______\nhttps://www.beverlyreview.net/news/community_news/article_65564422-5af2-11e9-ad97-83226adaa7fe.html\n2020s\nThe ward underwent a slight redistricting after the 2020 census, with its boundaries extending further eastward, and its population increasing 1,200. Its boundaries largely resemble those it was given after the 2000 census. The ward contains the entirety of of Mount Greenwood, most of Beverly, and some portions of Morgan Park. The ward's incumbent alderman, O'Shea, supported this map.\nIn the 2023 mayoral election, the ward heavily favored runner-up Paul Vallas. Vallas received 62% of the ward's first round votes. The more than 13,000 votes he received in the ward were more than he received in any other of the city's 50 wards. Incumbent mayor Lightfoot received the second-most support in the ward during the election's preliminary round, with 12% of the ward's votes. Brandon Johnson placed third in the ward during the preliminary round, with 9% of the ward's votes. Ahead of the preliminary election, a town hall featuring eight mayoral candidates was held in the Beverly neighborhood within the ward. In the runoff election between Johnson and Vallas, 73% of the ward's votes went to Vallas. However, Johnson won a narrow victory in the citywide result.\nPast alders\nLike other wards, before 1923 the ward was represented by two aldermen elected to two-year terms and elections were staggered. Since 1923, the ward has been a singe-member district.\n1869–1875\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"|Alderman\n!scope=\"col\"|Term in office\n!scope=\"col\"|Party\n!scope=\"col\"|Notes\n!scope=\"col\"|Cite\n!scope=\"col\"|#Council\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"|Alderman\n!scope=\"col\"|Term in office\n!scope=\"col\"|Party\n!scope=\"col\"|Notes\n!scope=\"col\"|Cite\n|-\n|\n|\n!scope=\"row\"| John Herting\n| 1869–1870\n|\n| Redistricted from 15th ward\n|\n|style= \"background-color:#C0C0C0\"| 33rd\n| rowspan=2|\n| rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2 scope=\"row\"| James McCauley\n| rowspan=2|1869–1871\n| rowspan=2|\n| rowspan=2|\n| rowspan=2|\n|-\n| rowspan=2|\n| rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2 scope=\"row\"| William M.
