Carnegie also sent the same gift to President Benjamin Harrison on his inauguration eight years later.\nIn 1920 the company faced challenges during Prohibition in the US, but it adapted by focusing on other markets and maintaining quality.\nThe company joined Distillers Company in 1925 as part of Buchanan-Dewar.\nDistillers Company was acquired by Guinness in 1986.
