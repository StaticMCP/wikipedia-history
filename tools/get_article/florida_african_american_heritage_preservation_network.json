      "text": "# Florida African American Heritage Preservation Network\n\nThe Florida African American Heritage Preservation Network (FAAHPN) is a professional association organized in 2001 by the John Gilmore Riley Center Museum. FAAHPN serves as an informational and technical assistance resource in response to a growing interest in preserving Florida’s African American culture, that of the African diaspora, and that of other related ethnically diverse historic resources. The network was formed under the leadership of Althemese Barnes, the founder and former executive director of the John G. Riley Center & Museum. As of 2024, FAAHPN encompassed about 30 museums and had received grant support for leadership-succession training. Members include the A. Quinn Jones House (Gainesville), the Spady Cultural Heritage Museum (Delray Beach), and the L. B. Brown House (Bartow).\nThe Florida Black Heritage Trail Guide is part of the Florida Heritage Trails series published by the Florida Department of State; the third edition (2007) was produced by VISIT FLORIDA in partnership with the Department of State and FAAHPN, and the guide describes a “microcosm of African-American landmarks and legacies” across Florida. Working with the Division of Historical Resources and VISIT FLORIDA, FAAHPN contributed to updated editions of the guide in 2005 and 2007.\nState partnership. In 2024, Florida enacted HB 1679 (ch. 2024-75, L.O.F.), directing the Department of State to partner with FAAHPN, subject to appropriation, to support member museums and related preservation activities.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://faahpn.com Official website]\n* [https://dos.fl.gov/historical/preservation/heritage-trails/black-heritage-trail/ Florida Department of State: Florida Black Heritage Trail]"
