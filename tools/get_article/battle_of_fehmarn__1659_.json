It was fought in the Fehmarn Belt between a Swedish fleet under Klas Hansson Bjelkenstjerna and a Dano-Dutch fleet under Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam. The battle ended inconclusively.\nBackground\nFollowing the Battle of the Sound, Swedish forces had been driven out from Zealand, but continued to occupy the Island of Funen. Dano-Dutch forces under Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam, which were defending the Øresund strait, sailed downwind to meet the Swedish fleet in the Fehmarn Belt.\nOn 30 April, 1659, a Swedish fleet under the command of Klas Hansson Bjelkenstjerna encountered its Dutch counterpart under Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam and the Danish one under Henrik Bielke between Fehrmarn and Lolland.\nThe Swedish fleet consisted of 20–24 warships, two fire ships, and some galleons, while the allied fleet consisted of three Danish warships and 19–23 Dutch warships, along with some galleons and transport ships. Bjelkenstjerna decided to attack the allied fleet despite being outnumbered and a weak crew due to starvation.\nBattle\nBoth sides maneuvered to get into their positions, and when they passed each other, they opened fire. The wind became so strong that neither side was able to open their gun ports. However, sufficient fire was able to be maintained from other decks. During the fighting, a six pound cannonball hit Bjelkenstjerna in his hip, forcing him to withdraw to the stern, leading to Carl Gustaf Wrangel taking over command.\nThe two fleets continued passing by each other at close range, exchanging heavy cannon fire. The Swedes were able to hit several allied ships, particularly the Danish Trefoldigheden, with several of its sails being shot down, and making maneuvering it difficult. Opdam arrived with reinforcements, successfully preventing the damaged Trefoldigheden from further attacks.\nThe fleets turned once more, and the Swedes came into the wind, however, the harsh weather made it impossible to keep the fleet together for close combat, leading to Wrangel having to stay as still as possible and wait for the allied ships. The evening continued with continuous artillery fire, but when it became dark, Wrangel decided to withdraw in order to seek a harbour to assess the damage done to his ships. Opdam made the same decision, and the fleets separated. Wrangel's forces withdrew towards the northeast, and a small force remained near Copenhagen, however the majority of the fleet returned to Landskorna.\nAftermath\nThe Swedish losses sustained during the battle were some 12 officers and men killed, with 26 wounded, and the size of the allied fleet remains unknown. According to some sources, the battle ended in a draw while others claim it was tactically inconclusive but with a strategic outcome favoring the allies.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
