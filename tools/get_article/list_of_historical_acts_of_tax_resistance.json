It has been suggested that tax resistance played a significant role in the collapse of several empires, including the Egyptian, Roman, Spanish, and Aztec.\nMany rebellions and revolutions have been prompted by resentment of taxation or had tax refusal as a component. Examples of historic events that originated as tax revolts include the Magna Carta, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution.\nThis page is a partial list of global tax revolts and tax resistance actions that have come to the attention of Wikipedia's editors. This includes actions in which a person or people refused to pay a tax of some sort, either through passive resistance or by actively obstructing the tax collector or collecting authorities, and actions in which people boycotted some taxed good or activity or engaged in a strike to reduce or eliminate the tax due.\nExamples\nBefore 1500 A.D.\nJewish Zealots, 1st century A.D.\nIn the 1st century AD, Jewish Zealots in Judaea resisted the poll tax instituted by the Roman Empire. Jesus was accused of promoting tax resistance prior to his torture and execution (\"We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ a King\" — Luke 23:2). After the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD, Jews, particularly those exiled to Egypt, refused to pay the still-extant \"temple tax\" to Rome (which it was using to maintain pagan temples); Rome responded by destroying Jewish temples.\nLimoges, 578\nIn 578 AD residents of Limoges, encouraged by the local clergy, rioted, destroying tax-collecting paraphernalia and threatening the assessor.  The government responded harshly, with punishments including torture and crucifixion, though Queen Fredegund later was said to have repented and rescinded the tax.\nPeace and Truce of God, 1027\nIn councils organized by the Peace and Truce of God movement, Christian clergy resisted the exaction of taxes against church property by warlords.\nDanegeld, 1041\nIn 1041, residents of Worcester rebelled against the Danegeld being collected by King Harthacnut, and killed two of his tax collectors. Harthacnut responded by burning Worcester to the ground.\nConstantinople, 1197\nWhen Alexios III Angelos tried to tax residents of Constantinople to come up with money to pay protection money to Henry VI, the people of Constantinople refused to pay, and Alexios was reduced to trying to collect the sum by stripping the ornaments from old tombs.\nFlorence, 1289\nA war tax instituted by the Florentine seigniory in 1288 and increased in 1289 led to mass tax resistance that forced the government to abandon the tax.\nClericis laicos, 1296\nIn 1296, Pope Boniface VIII issued the clericis laicos, which prohibited secular governments from taxing churches without the permission of the Pope, and prohibited church officials from paying such taxes.  Archbishop Robert Winchelsey used this as the basis for his refusal to pay taxes to Edward I of England, and urged the clergy under his direction to do likewise.\nNorman anti-tax riots, 1348–51\nIn Normandy in June 1348, tax resisters attacked the tax collectors of King Philip VI, \"pillaging and burning their houses.\" In August 1351, citizens of Rouen rioted, \"destroying 'the counters, boxes, and other objects necessary to make and operate' collection of\" a new tax instituted by John II. In 1355, Geoffroy of Harcourt urged residents of Rouen to refuse to pay the hearth tax and allied with Charles the Bad against John II's taxes.\nWat Tyler's rebellion, 1381\nIn 1381 the Peasant's Revolt occurred in England, when Wat Tyler led an uprising over a new poll tax. Tyler marched an army of tens of thousands of peasants from Kent to Canterbury, then to London, beheaded the archbishop, and exacted radical concessions from King Richard II. During the negotiations, Tyler was killed by officers of the King and was publicly beheaded, and Richard II retracted all of the concessions that he had previously made.\nFrench aides uprisings, 1381\nIn 1381 there was widespread tax rebellion in France.\nIn Rouen workers in the textile trade gathered in the Old Market, chose one of their own to represent the king, and had this mock king sign acts abolishing the aides. In Paris the collectors′ threat to seize a greengrocer's still on the Right Bank roused local residents to assemble, shout \"Down with taxes!\" and chase off the tax collectors.... The rebellion then spread to Caen and other towns in Normandy and to towns in Picardy, where opposition was especially virulent in Amiens.  It moved through Orleans and on to Sens, finally reaching Lyons...\nBundschuh movement\nThe Bundschuh movement was in part a tax resistance movement that encouraged its followers to stop paying tithes to the Catholic Church and taxes.  In France, a tithe-payer strike spread from 1529 to 1560 among both Catholics and Protestants.\nFlemish revolt against Maximilian of Austria, 1488\nThe guilds of Bruges (supported by the other Flemish cities) held later emperor Maximilian captive when he heavily disturbed the economy by raising taxes and seigniorage to wage war. They negotiated better terms and then released him. He then reneged on the agreement and took his armies back to Bruges in revenge. Bruges lost its administrative functions to the city of Ghent.\n16th century\nRevolt of the Comuneros, 1520\nIn Spain, the people of Salamanca in 1520 refused to pay any taxes because of their belief that Charles I was sending the tax money to the Netherlands. They were joined by other towns, which eventually formed the Revolt of the Comuneros.\nAmicable Grant revolt in England, 1525\nUnder the leadership of his chief minister Thomas Wolsey, England's King Henry VIII repeatedly raised taxes and imposed forced loans in the 1520s to pay for his large-scale wars in Europe. Finally the call for an \"Amicable Grant\" of non-repayable loans in 1525 went too far. Parliament had not voted it, and the English landed and financial elites refused to pay. Passive resistance was widespread, there was an attempted revolt in Suffolk and England was on the verge of violent resistance when the program was hurriedly ended.  Lack of money ended Henry's plans for an invasion of France, and he took England out of the war with the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525.\nGerman Peasants′ War, 1524–25\nThe German Peasants' War of 1524–25 was in part a tax resistance campaign.  The rebels vowed to set their own tithes, and said:\nThe small tithes, whether ecclesiastical or lay, we will not pay at all, for the Lord God created cattle for the free use of man. We will not, therefore, pay farther an unseemly tithe which is of man's invention.... Henceforth no one shall have to pay death taxes, whether small or large.\nRevolt of Ghent, 1539\nThe Revolt of Ghent began when the city magistrates refused to pay taxes demanded by Charles V for his war with France.\nHutterites\nIn the 16th century, Hutterites refused to pay taxes for war or capital punishment. One wrote:\nFor war, killing, and bloodshed (where it is demanded especially for that) we give nothing, but not out of wickedness or arbitrariness, but out of the fear of God () that we may not be partakers in strange sins.\nAnother wrote:\n[When] the government requires of us what is contrary to our faith and conscience – as swearing oaths and paying hangman's dues or taxes for war – then we do not obey its command.\nGabelle revolts, 1542, 1548\nResidents of La Rochelle rebelled against the gabelle, or salt tax, in 1542. \"[A]rmed rebels thwarted the tax-collecting efforts of two successive visitations of royal commissioners sent out to enforce the [gabelle] edicts.\" A second revolt centered in Guyenne in 1548 was more organized, widespread, and violent; and was violently suppressed. Also in August 1548, there were violent revolts against the gabelle in Bordeaux in which tax collectors were killed and their homes burnt. The French central government sent in thousands of troops who terrorized the occupants, imposed martial law, and enforced humiliating terms; however \"Amazingly, in the long run, the rebellion did achieve its aim. Unnerved by the riots, Henri II decided not to enforce the salt tax.\"\nTariff resistance in Holland, 1543–49\nMerchants in Holland successfully resisted a variety of export duties imposed by the Holy Roman Empire via Mary of Hungary.\nTax strikes in France, 1579–80\nIn Romans-sur-Isère and other parts of Dauphiné, anti-tax leagues formed, which grew into a powerful rebellion that was crushed in the wake of the ambush and murder of many of the rebel leaders by vigilantes during the Carnival of 1580.\nThe Revolt Against the Tribute, Philippines, 1589\nIn 1589, the provinces of Cagayán, Ilocos Norte, and Ilocos Sur rebelled against unjust Spanish colonial taxes and abusive tax collectors in what became known as the \"Revolt Against the Tribute,\" the \"Dingrás Revolt,\" or the \"Ilocos Norte Revolt.\"\nRappenkrieg, 1591–94\nIn a three-year-long tax refusal campaign called the Rappenkrieg or \"farthing war,\" the residents of Basel, Switzerland refused to pay a tax destined for the bishop.\nCroquants, 1593–95\nPeasant rebels in southwestern France called \"croquants\" included \"refusal to pay tithes, tailles, and rents... and resistance to tax collectors and their agents.\" A second rebellion in Vivarais at the same time also centered on refusal to pay the taille.\nSales tax resistance in France, 1597\nA number of towns in France, notably Poitiers, resisted the imposition of a new sales tax by Henry IV in 1597. The King at first stubbornly enforced the tax by force, but eventually decided the expense and fuss was not worth the income and rescinded the tax.\nJelali revolts\nThe Jelali revolts were typically inspired by taxes or the action of tax collectors, and included tax resistance strategies, including \"The Great Flight\" — a sort of mass emigration by peasants from their land to avoid taxes.\n17th Century\nBolotnikov rebellion, 1606\nDuring the Bolotnikov rebellion, tribes in western Siberia began refusing to pay taxes to the central government.\nBrussels, 1619\nIn the city of Brussels, then part of the Duchy of Brabant in the Habsburg Netherlands, there was a tax strike in 1619. When the States of Brabant (composed of representatives of the clergy, the nobility, and the four cities Leuven, Brussels, Antwerp and 's-Hertogenbosch) met to renew the standard sales tax on the \"four species of consumption\" (beer, wine, bread and meat), the guilds of the city of Brussels instructed their representatives not to vote the taxes through until their grievances had been addressed. As the constitutional principle was that taxes had to be passed by \"full consent\", this meant the taxes could not legally be collected. After two months of constitutional impasse and fruitless negotiations (May–June) the government ordered the taxes to be collected notwithstanding. The guilds made this impossible, and their defiance of the government led to a military occupation of the city in September 1619. The central authorities then revised the civic constitution to limit the power of the guilds to filibuster the States of Brabant. The deans of six of the guilds, and their legal counsel, were served with sentences of lifelong banishment from the Low Countries.\nEnglish Civil War\nIn 1627, John Hampden was imprisoned for his opposition to the loan Charles I authorised without parliamentary sanction, and he also refused to pay ship money to the Royal Navy.  The attempts to imprison resisters like Hampden led to the English Civil War.\nFrom the summer of 1646 through 1648, the city of London refused to pay taxes to the New Model Army which was occupying the city. In a celebrated 1654 case, George Cony refused to pay customs duties that had been instituted by The Protectorate without consent of parliament.\n17th-century tax rebellions in France\nIn 1615, the residents of one commune refused to pay the wine tithe and threatened to throw the collector into the Rhône.\nIn Poitiers, France, in 1624 and again on multiple occasions in 1663, mobs attacked inns where French tax farmers were staying, threatening to torch the building and kill those inside.\nThe success of anti-tax rebellions in Saintonge and Angoumois led to other rebellions in France, including some in which excise officers were lynched. The most notorious incident was the massacre of tax officers responsible for collecting the gabelle at Agen in June 1635.\nA second \"Croquants′ Revolt\" in 1636–37 (with some outbreaks as early as 1628) concerned the taxes being raised to support France's entry into the Thirty Years' War.  The revolt included the lynching of tax officials, a tax strike, and a major battle at which over 2,000 people were killed.  The major rebellion was defeated, but outbreaks of mass tax resistance continued as late as 1658.\nFrom 1638 to 1645, the residents of Pardiac refused to pay their taxes, rose up to free the officials who had been imprisoned for failure to remit the tax money, repulsed government troops sent to enforce the tax laws, and massacred a tax official and his bodyguard.\nIn 1639–43, the revolt of the va-nu-pieds in Normandy included a tax strike and attacks on the homes of tax farmers. In 1643 there were attacks on tax collectors in multiple regions of France. The Fronde of 1646–53 was also marked by anti-tax riots.\nThe revolt of the papier timbré in 1675 was centered on a new stamp tax, and included destruction of tax offices and attacks on tax- and tithe-collectors.\nIn 1682, a village curate led a tax revolt in which the villagers stoned the monks and the tithe agent who had come to collect a grain tithe.\nAlgonquian resistance, 1637\nIn 1637, the Algonquian resisted being taxed by Dutch colonialists to pay for improvements to Fort Amsterdam.\nItalian tax revolts, 1647\nResidents of Palermo and of Naples revolted in 1647 and destroyed the tax offices and the homes of tax farmers.\nSwiss peasant war of 1653\nA devaluation of Bernese money caused a tax revolt and the Swiss peasant war of 1653.  The war spread from the Entlebuch valley in the Canton of Lucerne to the Emmental valley in the Canton of Bern, to the cantons of Solothurn and Basel, and to the Aargau.\nResistance to Cromwell's Taxes-by-Decree, 1654\nIn 1654, an English merchant named George Cony refused to pay customs duties that had been established by Oliver Cromwell's government without its having bothered to go through Parliament, and thereby called into question the legal underpinnings of the whole regime.\nQuaker Tithe and War Tax Resistance, 1659–\nGeorge Fox′s Quaker movement included resistance to tithes and other mandatory fees destined for the establishment church. Soon, the movement also incorporated resistance to militia taxes and fees, and to \"trophy money\" (taxes for equipping soldiers). These were early examples of war tax resistance in the Quaker movement.\nRevolt of the papier timbré, 1675\nScottish presbyterian dissent, 1678–88\nIn the 17th century, as the reformation government in Scotland reintroduced a state Episcopal church and brutally cracked down on dissident Presbyterian groups, members of those groups resisted the taxes that were being raised to pay for this repression, and advocated mass tax resistance. (When the Scottish Presbyterians gained the upper hand and became the establishment church of Scotland, the tables were turned, and members of dissident churches began to resist taxes paid for its support.)\nResistance in New England, 1687\nOn 22 August 1687, John Wise met with some of the other \"principal inhabitants\" of Ipswich in New England, and decided that a new tax that had been imposed by governor Edmund Andros, without consulting the colony's General Assembly, was illegitimate and \"that it was not the town's duty any way to assist that ill method of raising money.\" A town meeting the next day that Andros had called for to select tax commissioners instead issued a declaration against the tax. A number of those at the town meeting were then arrested, hauled to a jail in another town, and then put on trial before a jury hand-picked by the prosecution and a judge who referred to the defendants as \"criminals\" over the course of the trial.\nFines and court costs followed, and, at first, the Andros tyranny was triumphant. But Wise and company had the last laugh. On 18 April 1689, in the wake of the Glorious Revolution in the home country, a \"Declaration of the Gentlemen, Merchants, and Inhabitants of Boston\" was issued, which proclaimed the assault on the rights of dissenting English colonists to be part of the same plot of \"the great Scarlet Whore\" to crush Englishmen under the thumb of the papists (that is, James II of England) again.\nThen followed a revolution. Andros and Judge Dudley, who had tried the case against Wise and the rest, were overthrown and imprisoned.\n18th century\nCamisard revolt, 1700–03\nTax resistance was a feature of the Camisard revolt.\nNew Jersey resistance to a Catholic assessor, 1715\nIn 1715, thirty-six New Jersey residents pledged to refuse to pay taxes \"Because wee have been Illegally Assessed by an Asseser who being a Known & open profest Roman Catholick which is Utterly Repugnant to the Laws of Great Brittain & Contrary to ye Rights & Liberties of his Royall Majties faithfull Subjects.\"\n18th-century uprisings in Japan\nSuccessful peasant uprisings in the Fukuyama fief in 1717 (and again in 1752 and 1770), in the Tsuyama fief in 1726–27, and in Iwaki Daira in 1739, focused on the oppressiveness of taxes and tax collection. Other tax revolts in Aizu in 1749, in Shinano Ueda in 1761–63, in Tenma Sodo in 1764–65, in Koyasan in 1776, in Kozuke & Musashi in 1781, and in Hokkaido in 1790, were only partially successful but also led to severe reprisals.\nMalt tax riots in Scotland, 1725\nA duty on malt had been imposed in England to pay for a war against France. At the union with Scotland in 1707, most taxes were made uniform, but under the Treaty of Union, Scotland was given a temporary exemption from the malt tax until the end of the war. After the war, in 1725, the House of Commons applied a new malt tax which applied throughout Great Britain, but charged at only half the rate in Scotland. Scots were unused to this tax, which increased the price of beer. Enraged citizens in Glasgow drove out the military and destroyed the home of their representative in parliament, who had voted for the tax. In Edinburgh, brewers went on strike, illegally. Andrew Millar, then a book trade apprentice, helped overthrow attempts by Edinburgh magistrates to control dissemination of opinion during the unrest. The pamphlet Millar refers to in the letter to Robert Wodrow dated 10 August 1725, and his actions detailed in the letter dated 15 July, emphasized contemporary doubts and challenges to the strike's \"illegality\". Much later, in 1806, there were malt tax riots in Llannon, Wales, in which a mob attacked 26 excise tax collectors who were searching for malt.\nExcise tax riots in England, 1733\nRobert Walpole's attempts to introduce an excise tax bill led to widespread, heated protest, including mobs that invaded the House of Commons.  Walpole was forced to withdraw his proposal.\n\"Jack-a-Lents\", 1734–49\nIn Gloucester and Hereford counties, England, rioters dressed in women's clothing and blackface destroyed tollbooths, a variety of resistance that would reemerge a century later in the Rebecca riots. A royal proclamation complained that the rebels \"have made publick and open Declaration, that they would proceed to pull down ſeveral other Turnpikes; and that if any of the Commiſſioners ſhould attempt to ſet up the Turnpikes again, they would pull down their Houſes, and would cut down the Turnpikes as often as they ſhould be ſet up.\"\nA similar outbreak took place in Bristol in 1749, in which self-styled Jack o’ Lents, \"many naked with their faces blacked ... destroyed the gates at Bedminster, Ashton, Don John's Cross, Dundry, Backwell, Nailsea, Redcliffe, Totterdown, Teasford and Bath Roads, Hanham, Kingswood, Stoke's Croft, &c., &c.\"\nPorteous riots, 1736\nRioters, sympathetic to condemned smugglers who were resisting excise taxes, managed to free one, but in an attempt to free another several were killed by the Edinburgh city guard, commanded by John Porteous.  Porteous was convicted of these killings, but pardoned by Queen Caroline, whereupon a lynch mob seized Porteous and hanged him.\nTithe resistance in France, 1736\nPeasants in disguise attacked and reclaimed the grain from the granary of a tithe collector in France in 1736. Authorities could find no witnesses willing to testify against any of the attackers.\nNorth Carolina Counties Resist, 1746\nIn 1746, the North Carolina colonial governor tried to rejigger the composition of the colonial Assembly, taking seats away from some counties. Those counties responded by withdrawing from the Assembly and refusing to surrender any taxes to the colonial government. Other counties, not wanting to bear the whole cost of government themselves, then responded by withholding their own taxes. This state of affairs lasted eight years.\nFrench and Indian War, 1755\nIn the mid-18th century, American Quaker John Woolman led many Quakers to question and refuse the payment of taxes to pay for the French and Indian War. In 1755, Woolman addressed the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting with his concern, saying in part:\nSome of our members, who are officers in civil government, are, in one case or other, called upon in their respective stations to assist in things relative to the wars; but being in doubt whether to act or crave to be excused from their office, if they see their brethren united in the payment of a tax to carry on the said wars, may think their case not much different, and so might quench the tender movings of the Holy Spirit in their minds.  Thus, by small degrees, we might approach so near to fighting that the distinction would be little else than the name of a peaceable people.\nA group of several like-minded Quakers, including John Woolman, John Churchman, and Anthony Benezet then sent a letter to other meetings, which read in part:\n[B]eing painfully apprehensive that the large sum granted by the late Act of Assembly for the king's use is principally intended for purposes inconsistent with our peaceable testimony, we therefore think that as we cannot be concerned in wars and fightings, so neither ought we to contribute thereto by paying the tax directed by the said Act, though suffering be the consequence of our refusal, which we hope to be enabled to bear with patience.\nThe \"Regulator\" movement, 1767–71\nThe Regulator movement against the corrupt colonial administration of North Carolina from around 1767 to 1771 presaged the American Revolution. It began with organized groups of rural North Carolinans refusing to pay inflated taxes to corrupt authorities, and eventually built to an armed rebellion (which was crushed).\nA revolt in Palermo, 1773\nMost Sicilians refused to pay new taxes imposed in 1770, and ripped down notices announcing the new levies. By 1773 the resistance led to a full-fledged revolt and ushered in a period when Palermo was under the de facto rule of the maestranze (guilds).\nAmerican Revolution\n, 16 December 1773]]\nAmerican colonists in the Thirteen Colonies used various methods of tax resistance to resist the British Parliament in the years leading up to the American Revolution, including the Boston Tea Party action; the Gaspée Affair; \"spinning bees\" in which revolutionary-minded women would make untaxed domestic cloth (prefiguring Gandhi's homespun cloth campaign); and a boycott of other taxed goods.\nAfter the revolution was underway, taxes instituted by the American patriot side were also widely resisted. One 1781 tax in Connecticut, for example, was designed to raise £288,233 but raised only £40,000 due to colonists’ unwillingness to pay. Some Quaker meetings recommended that their members not pay taxes to the revolutionary governments, and other Quakers refused to use Continental currency, which the revolutionary governments were using for seigniorage.\nAfrican American protests against taxation without representation, 1780\nIn 1780, African American Paul Cuffe and his brother resisted the state tax of Massachusetts.  Cuffe wrote to the state legislature: \"While we are not allowed the privilege of free men of the state having no vote or influence in the election with those that tax us. Yet many of our color, as is well known, have cheerfully entered the field of battle in the defense of the common cause.\" In 1783, free taxpaying African Americans in Massachusetts were given full citizenship rights, including the right to vote.\nRevolt of the Comuneros, 1781\nThe Revolt of the Comuneros in Colombia began with bands of armed protesters confronting tax commissioners and state monopoly shops.\nNew Hampshire secessionists, 1781\nFor a while, during the early days of the United States, Vermont was an independent republic of sorts, though with aspirations for statehood. Some regions of neighboring New Hampshire felt more loyal to the Vermont Republic than to the confederation of United States, and expressed this by refusing to pay taxes to the latter.\nYork tax riot, 1786\nIn York, Pennsylvania, in 1786, Jacob Bixler's cow was distrained after he refused to pay a tax. Sympathizers with Bixler disrupted the subsequent auction and rescued the cow.\nShays' Rebellion 1786–87\nDuring 1786 and 1787, former Continental Army captain and farmer Daniel Shays led an armed rebellion of farmers in Western Massachusetts against the state government's repressive economic policy of tax and debt collections.\nTax resistance during the French Revolution\nDuring the French Revolution and its aftermath, customs houses were burned by mobs; tax rolls were destroyed; excise collectors were made to renounce their jobs, then were run out of town (or in some cases killed). Popular tax resistance was directed both against the toppling monarchy and against the governments that would try to replace it.\nWar taxes were levied before and after French revolutionary troops occupied the German Rhineland and the Southern Netherlands during the War of the First Coalition. Churches and monasteries were taxed heavily before they were dissolved. Huge amounts of gold and silver objects, many from the Middle Ages and irreplaceable, were melted down in this period to pay for these taxes. Protests occurred but did not help. The famous Trier Cathedral treasure suffered immensely; only twelve objects of precious metal survived. The equally rich Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht lost 80% of its treasures, even though many precious objects were hidden in private homes. Aachen Cathedral Treasury remained largely untouched because the most valuable pieces were sent away to Paderborn in time.\nThe Whiskey Rebellion, 1791–94\nThere was also an earlier rebellion, in 1783, against a Pennsylvania state excise tax on whiskey. In Washington County, protesters seized a fleeing tax collector, forced him to destroy his arms and paperwork, shaved his head, and paraded him through the areas he was sent to tax.\nWhite Lotus Rebellion, 1793\nMembers of the White Lotus Society refused to pay taxes, and their movement eventually grew into a full rebellion that lasted until 1803.\nPazvantoğlu rebellion, 1794\nIn the wake of the Pazvantoğlu rebellion, peasants who had been expecting their taxes to be eliminated in the wake of the rebel victory fled their villages rather than pay the enduring taxes.\nFries's Rebellion, 1799–1800\nResistance in Mexico, 1780–1807\nThere was widespread resistance to the pulque tax and other taxes in Zempoala and Otumba, beginning in 1780.\n19th Century\nA mass tax strike in Benares, 1810–11\nWhen the East India Company attempted to impose a house tax in Bengal, 200,000 residents of Benares shut their shops, left their homes, assembled en masse in the countryside, and petitioned the Company administration to lift the tax. The protest occurred in December 1810 – January 1811. The Company administration at first made a show of force, but eventually rescinded the tax.\nRadical Reformers, 1819\nThe \"Radical Reformers\" were advocates of democratic reforms in England — things like universal male suffrage and secret ballots. In the wake of a military massacre of reform demonstrators in Manchester in August, 1819, reformers vowed to refuse to buy and consume products on which the government applied an excise tax, like tea, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages.\nBermuda, 1821\nWhen residents of St. George parish refused to pay their church tithes, William Lumley, governor of Bermuda, put several in military jail. Lumley's acts were later ruled illegal (Basham v. Lumley, 1829), the court ruling that although the governor of the Bermuda colony had also been granted ecclesiastical authority by the crown, he was not authorized to use his civil authority to imprison people who refused his ecclesiastical orders; at most he could excommunicate them.\nTumenggung Mohammad revolt, 1825\nThe followers of Tumenggung Mohammad in Indonesia practiced tax resistance, including rioting against tax collectors.\nTax resistance against Charles X of France, 1829\nWhen Charles X of France attempted to bypass the legislature and enact its own taxes in 1829, French liberals in the Breton Association organized tax resistance and created a fund to defray the costs of any tax resisters who were prosecuted. Six Parisian newspapers who printed the Association's manifesto were prosecuted by the crown. Fifteen regional organizations, including ''Refus de l'impôt, Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera, and Association parisienne, were formed specifically to engage in tax resistance.\nTax resistance in Georgian England\nIn the 1820s and 1830s, activists like William Benbow and Thomas Jonathan Wooler and groups such as the National Union of the Working Classes and National Political Union advocated and practiced tax resistance.\nThe Tithe War, 1830–38\nFrom 1830 to 1838, Irish Catholics conducted a mass tax strike against the mandatory tithes payable to the Anglican official state Church of Ireland. The Tithe War, as it came to be called, had both a nonviolent, passive-resistance wing, led by James Warren Doyle, and a violent one, in which bands of paramilitary secret societies enforced the strike and attacked tax collectors and collaborators. The campaign was eventually successful in eliminating the tithe system, although the government essentially converted what had been tithes on the tenants into rent due through the landlords.\nResistance in Syria, 1831–54\nSyrians resisted being taxed both by Egypt and later by Turkey, and refused to pay these occupation governments.\nTax resistance for the Reform Act 1832\nTax resistance was an important tool in the arsenal of the Birmingham Political Union and its allies who forced the Crown and the House of Lords to capitulate over the Reform Act 1832. In the spring of 1832, residents of Carmarthen, Wales, met and vowed to stop paying taxes if the Reform Act were not passed, and some stopped paying taxes in the wake of the collapse of Lord Grey's government.\nTinos, 1833\nIn 1833, thousands of residents of the island of Tinos stopped paying their taxes in an organized campaign. The government reacted fiercely, imprisoning many leaders of the movement and forcing the local bishop to flee.\nUK resistance to \"Assessed Taxes,\" 1833–51\nThere was sporadic resistance to assessed taxes (particularly the window tax) in the United Kingdom. Resisters felt the tax was overly-regressive. Resisters formed tax resistance associations and disrupted auctions of goods seized from resisters by the tax authorities.\nEdinburgh Annuity/Clerico-Police Tax, 1833–61\nAn annuity tax to raise money for the establishment clergy in Edinburgh, Scotland began to be resisted by nonconformists around 1833, in particular by William Tait, publisher of ''Tait's Magazine'' who went to jail for his stand. Celebrated imprisonments like this, and occasional attempts (often unsuccessful) by the authorities to seize and auction property of the resisters, characterized the campaign.

In his essay on civil disobedience, he wrote:\nI meet this American government, or its representative, the State government, directly, and face to face, once a year, no more, in the person of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man situated as I am necessarily meets it; and it then says distinctly, Recognize me; and the simplest, the most effectual, and, in the present posture of affairs, the indispensablest mode of treating with it on this head, of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it, is to deny it then....\n...If a thousand men were not to pay their tax bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.\nThoreau was following in the footsteps of his fellow New England transcendentalists Amos Bronson Alcott and Charles Lane who had also been arrested for conscientious refusal to pay the poll tax.\nSicilian revolution of independence of 1848\nDuring the Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848 rebels destroyed tax records and assessments and many people stopped paying taxes.\nKarl Marx prosecuted for promoting tax resistance, 1848\nDuring the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the royal and military aristocracy prohibited the first popularly elected parliament from assembling, and that parliament responded by declaring the government out-of-business:\nSo long as the National Assembly is not at liberty to continue its sessions in Berlin, the Brandenburg cabinet has no right to dispose of government revenues and to collect taxes.\nKarl Marx, via his newspaper, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, published this decree, adding: \"From today, therefore, taxes are abolished!

The tax was not so much a revenue raising instrument as a way of allowing citizens to monopolize mining and take over sites being worked by Chinese and Mexican miners. The tax resistance by foreign miners was successful. The tax was repealed by the end of 1850, though a smaller ($4/month) tax was reapplied to Chinese miners in 1852, and some particularly unscrupulous tax collectors continued to extort the tax from foreign miners even when it was no longer legal to do so. One person who was forced off of his mining claim by the Foreign Miners Tax was Joaquin Murieta, whose story became a Robin Hood-like myth in California.\nPrussian democrats, 1850,1864\nIn 1850 Lothar Bucher, leader of the radical democratic party in the Prussian national assembly, and others of similar views, were convicted for encouraging citizens to stop paying taxes to the autocratic government.\nSimilarly, in 1864 the delegate Johann Jacoby served six months behind bars for a speech calling for tax refusal, delivered in the presence of the King, an early manifestation of opposition to the rule of Otto von Bismarck.\nGrape-growers's strike in Bulgaria, 1851\nIn response to a tax increase on grapes and vineyards, Bulgaria's grape pickers went on strike.\nMass resistance in Jiangnan, 1853\nIn Qingpu, China, numerous uprisings and organized tax resistance took place around 1853, some led by Zhou Lichun.

He organized landowners in twenty precincts to boycott taxes, and successfully resisted government reprisals. In other actions that year, thousands of Nanjui County taxpayers attacked government offices and made attempts on the life of the magistrate, three granary clerks were boiled alive by enraged taxpayers, and Huating County residents burned the boats of mercenaries who were helping a magistrate collect taxes.\nEureka Rebellion, 1851–1854\nGhana, 1854\nResidents of the Gold Coast resisted the introduction of a poll tax by rebelling against the colonial government in 1854.

The symbol of this strategy was Ferenc Deák, following his refusal to take public office under the Austrians and apparent semi-retirement in the 1850s. After Emperor Franz-Joseph issued his October Diploma in 1860, granting increased autonomy to various parts of the Austrian empire, the Hungarian county councils and Diet were reconvoked. However, the conflict with Austria continued—including renewed tax resistance—with Deák playing a more active role until the Diet's demands were conceded in 1867.\nMejba Revolt, 1864–65\nThe Mejba Revolt was a rebellion in Tunisia against the doubling of an unpopular poll tax (the mejba) imposed on his subjects by Sadok Bey.

As part of this, he issued declarations saying that those people collecting taxes for the actually seated government were acting illegally and illegitimately and that citizens of Louisiana should resist these taxes.\nMcEnery's shadow government, representing a white-supremacist Democratic party opposed to the Republican black and carpetbagger government, maintained its parallel governance until mid-1873, and then folded under pressure from the United States federal government.\nRubí, Catalonia, 1873\nCitizens of Rubí, Catalonia refused to pay a war tax in 1873, shortly before the military commander of Catalonia was forced to flee in the face of a mutiny.\nLaunceston, Tasmania, 1874\nThe Western Railway was a financial failure, and soon after it went into operation the government had to take it over from its bankrupt owners. Landholders in the railway district felt that the government take-over had changed the relationship between taxpayers and the railway, and that they were \"morally exonerated from the principle of local taxation which they had endorsed when the district was polled in 1865. Since that period an entirely new principle had been adopted in the case of the Main Line Railway, and when they hesitated to pay their special rate, they acted on the conviction that it was the Government, and not they, who had broken faith.\" The landholders launched a tax resistance campaign, forcing the government to capitulate and rescind the tax.\nWhite miners in Griqualand West, 1874\nIn 1874, a group of small-scale European diamond miners at the \"New Rush\" in Kimberly, South Africa (then in a British colony called Griqualand West), launched a tax strike to protest the British colonial government's lack of response to their grievances.\nMexican-American Tax Resistance in Texas, 1877\nDuring the San Elizario Salt War, residents of El Paso County, Texas with loyalties to Mexico stopped paying taxes to the United States-loyal government.\nSouth Carolina, 1877\nSimilarly to what happened in Louisiana, white supremacists in South Carolina who disapproved of the reconstruction government practiced tax resistance and discouraged people from loaning money to the government by vowing to repudiate any such debts should they regain power.\nCalls to resist in Denmark, 1877 and 1885\nIn 1877 and again in 1885, the Left party in Denmark urged people to refuse to pay taxes levied by the Rightist government.\nTram tax resistance in Rio, 1880\nWhen the government of Rio increased the tramway tax and have this increase apply to every passenger, Jose Lopes da Silva Trovao and other protest organizers called on people to refuse to pay the tax.\nInconfidência Mineira,Brazil, 1789\nTax resistance called Inconfidência Mineira was against one-fifth tax over gold.\nTax resistance launches the First Boer War, 1880\nThe First Boer War broke out when the British colonial government seized a wagon from Piet Bezuidenhoudt who had refused to pay a tax.

Some 200 people refused to pay the tax. The authorities took legal action against a few, but then quickly dropped the charges.\nIrish settlers in Canada, 1879–81\nTwo hundred Irish settlers in Gatineau refused to pay a county tax.

The authorities sided with the police, and awarded a £1,000 judgement to a constable who was wounded in the course of the massacre, ordering that the money would be raised by an additional tax on the Irish—one that would come to be called the \"Constable Leahy Tax.\" The tax was widely refused, and parliamentarian Thomas Condon was prosecuted on criminal conspiracy charges for publicly advocating tax resistance.\nDothan riot, 1889\nDothan, Alabama tried to tax all vehicles traveling through the town in 1889, in reaction to the decision by the Farmers' Alliance to avoid municipal taxation by building a warehouse outside of the town limits.

The tax would be imposed on dwellings, at an annual rate that in some cases exceeded the value of the dwelling itself, and came to be known as the \"Hut Tax.\"\nSierra Leonians were unused to regular taxation of any sort, and interpreted the tax as meaning that the British government was assuming ownership of all of the dwellings in the area and charging rent.

They were backed (in the demand for arbitration, if not in the tax resistance) by the British, French, and German governments.

This mostly represents a government policy change in how it was going to be taxing saloonkeepers, but because the change involved rescinding an extralegal tax extorted under-the-table by city employees, it was hard for the government to accomplish in ordinary ways. So it had to nurture a tax resistance movement and encourage solidarity among its members by offering some protection of its own (including judges who reduced fines against people arrested by the police in extortion attempts to near-nothing).\nBritish nonconformists, 1903–24\nIn 1903, tens of thousands of British nonconformists began resisting the part of their taxes that paid for sectarian schools.

Julia and Abby Smith, Annie Shaw, Lucy Stone, Virginia Minor, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were among those who practiced and advocated tax resistance as a protest against \"taxation without representation.\"\nTax resistance also played a role in the women's suffrage movements of Bermuda, France, Germany, and South Africa.\nUnrest in China, 1907–16\nThe salt tax and other taxes, and conflict with organized smuggler associations, led to conflict in China, which included, in 1910, an assault on tax collectors and on the salt tax monopoly office, and the \"Two Kitchen Knives Rebellion\" led by He Long in 1916 in which the Salt Tax Bureau at Ba Maoqui was torched and the bureau's director was killed.\nIn 1910, also, merchants in Beijing began withholding their payments of stamp tax to pressure the monarchy to adopt republican reforms.\nPoll tax resistance in Grafton, Illinois, 1910\nA Socialist Party activist in Grafton, Illinois, was jailed six months for his refusal to pay the city's poll tax in 1910.

Miller stopped paying his dog license fee in 1917, complaining that \"I consider said tax a unjust burden for owners who have dogs for their home and families' defence, not for luxuries, as the cost of living to raise five children is expensive enough without feeding a dog if he was not necessary in the wild section of this town, as we have no benefit from all the taxation with which we are burdened, no open streets, no police, no sewers, and many more necessities that I could mention.\"\nWorld War I in the United States, 1917–18\nIn the United States, although the decision whether or not to purchase war bonds to support World War I was ostensibly voluntary, those who chose not to buy them were subject to strong pressure including mob violence.

I never saw so much yellin' and a cursing and slapped him. And buffeted him and beat him and kicked him. He never offered any resistance whatsoever. One of the fellows went and got a, a hardware store and got a gallon of yellow paint. And pulled the lid off and poured it over his face. He had a long beard, kind of a short heavyset man, had a nice beard, and that run down all over his eyes, his face, and his beard, and his clothes. Of course that was yellow.... He never offered no resistance whatsoever and they, one man went to the hardware store again and he got a rope and put it around, got there, and put around his neck and marched him down to the, close to the city jail, a little calaboose there. Had a tree there and they was going to hang him to this tree.\n...I don't know how many people walked right up to him and spit in his face and he never said a word. And he just looked up all the time we was doing that. Possibly praying, I don't know. But there's some kind of a glow come over his face and he just looked like Christ. ... (inaudible). Enemies smite you on one cheek, turn the other and brother he did it. He just kept doing it. They'd slug him on the one side of the face and he'd turn his cheeks on the other. He exemplified the life of Christ more than any man I ever saw in my life.\nHerman Bausch was imprisoned for 28 months by the state of Montana for seditious statements he allegedly made while being held captive by a violent mob who were enraged at him for his unwillingness to buy liberty bonds.\nDarwin Rebellion\nIn Darwin (Northern Territory, Australia) in early 1919, citizens organized an income tax strike, and a boycott of the local (taxed) alcohol monopolist, John Gilruth, who was also the Administrator (governor).

Some chose to resist these taxes. In Pennsylvania, a school tax became the target of a massive, statewide, grassroots resistance campaign. For example:\n* In 1923, 89 women in Pottstown said that they were not interested in voting or in paying taxes, and refused to pay a school tax they had recently become vulnerable to.\n* The same year, 800 women in Haverford refused to pay the tax, as did 250 in Media.\n* Some 1,700 women in Charleroi refused to pay the tax and, in 1924, were ordered to be arrested.\n* That year in Clifton Heights, exasperated tax collectors exonerated 700 women tax delinquents rather than try to pursue them for the taxes.\n* In 1926, 200 women in Freeland were reported as tax delinquents.\n* In 1927, 300 women in Darby followed suit, and ultimately 2,000 delinquent tax notices were sent there.\nRed Spear Society, 1923–38\nA peasant secret mutual-defense group in China called the Red Spear Society supported tax resistance.\nIndian workers in Fiji, 1924\nWhen Fiji added a £1 a year poll tax on Indian workers (representing about 12 days' pay), they regarded this as a bait-and-switch on their contracts, and vowed to go to jail rather than pay.\nIndians in Kenya, 1924\nIndians in British India had started migrating to the British colony of Kenya during the second half of the 19th century, and by 1924 were beginning to exercise democratic political power. This led to concerns from the colonial government in Kenya, which issued a white paper which stated that the colonial government's priority was to focus on the unenfranchised African population rather than the Indian community. Indians in Kenya responded to this with an organized tax resistance campaign, which led to some of them being imprisoned by the colonial government. Whether from the effect of these imprisonments or from concessions made through back-channel negotiations, the protest ended in a few months.\nArgentina, 1924\nA coalition of 1,500 leading industrialists of Argentina refused to pay into a state-run pension fund following a general strike and labor lockout organized to fight the law that established the fund.\nLondon bookmakers strike, 1926\nTo protest a new betting tax, the bookmakers at Tattersalls Park refused to bet, thus making it impossible for the track to lay odds, and effectively shutting down business there and off-track.\nCristero War, Mexico, 1926\nTax resistance was used as a tactic in the Cristero War, where some people with Catholic sympathies refused to pay taxes to the government and turned to the church for defense.\nFarmers in Queensland, Australia, 1927\nThe government of Queensland, struggling with debt, enacted a stealth tax in the form of a registration fee charged to farmers who had wells and water pumps on their farms.

Further tax revolts in 1938 and 1956 grew out of the same movement.\nIndian independence campaign\nMahatma Gandhi's independence campaign in India used a variety of tax resistance strategies, including attacking the British taxed monopolies on salt and textiles by advocating the illegal production of salt outside of the monopoly system and the home-based spinning of cloth. In 1930 this tax resistance culminated in Gandhi's famous  Salt March to Dandi to harvest sea salt in contravention of British colonial law. Other tax resistance campaigns persisted after this period, including resistance to the Damodar Canal tax in 1937–39.\nThe Great Depression, United States\nIn the United States, the term \"tax revolt\" is sometimes used to refer to a series of anti-tax state initiative campaigns. The first significant wave of these campaigns was during the 1930s. The Great Depression introduced unprecedented tax burdens to Americans. While real-estate values plummeted and unemployment skyrocketed, the cost of government remained high. As a result, taxes as a percentage of the national income nearly doubled from 11.6 percent in 1929 to 21.1 in 1932. Most of the increase took place at the local level and especially squeezed the resources of real estate taxpayers.  Local tax delinquency rose steadily to a still standing record of 26.3% in 1933.\nMany Americans reacted to these conditions by forming taxpayers' leagues to call for lower taxes and cuts in government spending. By some estimates, there were three thousand of them by 1933. Taxpayers' leagues endorsed such measures as laws to limit and rollback taxes, lowered penalties on tax delinquents, and cuts in government spending. Partly as a result of their efforts, sixteen states and numerous localities adopted property tax limitations while three states instituted homestead exemptions.\nWhile taxpayers' leagues usually favored traditional legal and political strategies, a few were more direct. Probably the best known of these was the Association of Real Estate Taxpayers in Chicago. From 1930 to 1933, it led one of the largest tax strikes in American history.  At its height, it had 30,000 paid members, a budget of $600,000, and a weekly radio show.\nBy 1933, the taxpayers' leagues had entered a period of decline. Several factors undermined the conditions that had nurtured revolt. For example, economic conditions gradually improved, the federal government extended aid to homeowners, and local governments reduced reliance on real estate taxes. To some extent, the tax revolt also fell victim to an effective counterattack by municipal reformers, government officials, and the holders of municipal debt such as bondholders and bankers who formed so-called \"Pay Your Taxes\" campaigns throughout the country. These campaigns used a combination of door-to-door solicitation, threats of coercion, and inducements, such as installment payment plans, to collect back taxes.\nAn alternative theory describing the decline of the taxpayers' leagues is that laws limiting existing taxes and new tax revenues from the manufacture and sale of alcohol due to the repeal of prohibition eliminated the need for the taxpayers' leagues.\nCedar County Cow War of 1931\nDuring the Iowa Cow War, the 700-member Farmers Protective Association vowed to refuse tax payments if the governor did not withdraw state troops and release an imprisoned resister.\nWomen's suffragists in Bermuda, 1931–34\nWomen's suffragists in Bermuda, in particular Gladys Misick Morrell, refused to pay taxes unless they gained the vote.\nTithe Resistance in Britain, 1931–35\nAs crop prices fell during the Depression, farmers in Great Britain began refusing to pay government-mandated church tithes. Resisters used a variety of tactics to resist government retaliation.\n[T]hey have made conditions very unhappy for auctioneers selling property for non-payment of tithes. They have stampeded oxen so that the sale of them could not continue. They have browbeaten bidders so that prices adequate to pay the tithes have not been reached; they have stoned auctioneers, thrown them in ponds, plastered them with mud, slashed their tires, and organized mass resistance to tithe collecting in other ways.\nTyrol, Austria 1931\nPeasants' federations in eastern Tyrol resolved to stop paying taxes in October 1931 to protest bloated government, agricultural policy, profiteering, and a large tax burden.\nReal Estate Taxpayers, 1931–33, 1977\nDuring the Great Depression in the early 1930s, Americans throughout the United States formed thousands of taxpayers' leagues to protest high property taxes. In some cases, these groups illegally withheld taxes through tax strikes and other forms of resistance. The largest tax strike was in Chicago and led by the Association of Real Estate Taxpayers. At its height, the Association had more than thirty-thousand dues-paying members.\nA second, similar but smaller property tax payer's revolt hit Chicago in 1977.\nPuerto Rico sales tax, 1932\n300 businesses in Ponce, Puerto Rico declared that they would refuse to continue to pay the sales tax after the United States governor of the island refused to repeal the tax.\nMeo uprising, 1932\nThe Meo, a group of Indian Muslims, revolted against taxes imposed by a Hindu maharaja in 1932, refusing to pay and resisting collection by force.\nElmira Taxpayers' League\nOver a thousand taxpayers in Elmira, New York signed a pledge to refuse to pay local taxes until the municipal budget had been reduced, and tax rates as well.\nNew York City automobile owners, 1933\nThe automobile club of New York organized an auto tax strike in 1933 to protest a doubled license fee for City residents.\nMennonite women in Pennsylvania, 1933\nClaiming that the Bible did not sanction the taxation of women, some women in Warwick township, Pennsylvania, refused to pay a poll tax in 1933.\nIrish \"Blue Shirts,\" 1935\nTo protest Irish intransigence in the Anglo-Irish Trade War, the quasi-fascist \"Blue Shirts\" declared a tax strike.

The offensive tax was eventually thrown out as unconstitutional.\nFrench \"Peasant Front,\" 1935\nThe \"Peasant Front,\" organized by Henri Dorgères, launched a tax strike in 1935. In some regions as many as 90% of the residents refused to pay their taxes, but the campaign had limited national impact.\nSales tax resistance in Montreal, 1935\nMayor Hervé Ferland of Verdun led 164 or more shopkeepers there in refusing to collect or remit Montreal's sales tax.\nSales tax resistance in Arkansas, 1935\n98% of merchants in Stuttgart and 59 of 60 merchants in DeWitt signed a pledge to refuse to collect or pay a new Arkansas sales tax in 1935.\nSales tax resistance in Alabama, 1936\nGadsden, Alabama merchants met and unanimously voted to refuse to collect or remit the state sales tax.

This forced some concessions from the coal companies.\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II, the Christian anarchist and pacifist Ammon Hennacy refused to register for the American draft and announced that he would not pay his income taxes. He also tried to reduce his tax liability by adopting a life of simple living. He wrote:\nI [learned] the principle of voluntary poverty and non-payment of taxes... from Tolstoy and the CW. When I was working a man asked me \"Why does a fellow like you, with an education, and who has been all over the country, end up in this out-of-the-way place working for very little on a farm?\" I explained that all people who had good jobs in factories, etc. had a withholding tax for war taken from their pay, and that people who worked on farms had no tax taken from their pay. I told him that I refused to pay taxes. He was a returned soldier and said that he did not like war either, but what could a fellow do about it? I replied that we each did what we really wanted to.\nPalestine, 1936–48\nIn 1936, in what one author called \"the first truly grass-root rebellion/uprising by Palestinians,\" 150 Palestinians called for a general strike and tax strike to protest against the British mandate.\nBetween 1939 and 1948, there was widespread resistance by Jews in Palestine against the income tax imposed by the British authorities, which included bomb attacks against tax offices, and many Jews instead voluntarily paid taxes to Jewish organizations. A few years after Israel gained its independence, its government became the target of widespread tax evasion and resistance, including a major tax strike in 1954.\nJews in Vichy France, 1944\nJews refused to pay taxes to the Union générale des israélites de France (General Organization of Jews in France),  which had been established by the Vichy France (Nazi-collaborationist) government. This Union was ostensibly meant to act as an umbrella organization that would organize social services for Jews by coordinating existing Jewish groups, but it was really a phase in the Nazi-organized obsession with bureaucratically solving the \"Jewish Problem\" in Europe via elimination. As in other parts of Nazi-controlled Europe, Jews in France had to make hard decisions about how much to resist such organizations outright and how much to try to participate in them as potential tools of resistance or amelioration.\nAll French Jews were required to be members of the Union, which presumed to control all Jewish property. The Nazis might, for example, \"fine\" the whole of the Jews of France, and the Union in its representative capacity would borrow money to pay off the fine by pledging Jewish property as collateral, or, apparently, by taxing the membership base.\nMoslem League in India, 1946\nA punitive tax imposed on Muslims by the United Provinces government to discourage rioting was resisted in a refusal organized by the Moslem League.\nAbeokuta Women's Revolt, late-1940s\nThe Abeokuta Women's Revolt (also called the Egba Women's Tax Riot) was a resistance movement against the imposition of unfair taxation by the Nigerian colonial government. The women of Abeokuta believed that, under colonialism, their economic roles were declining, while their taxes were increasing. Additionally, they argued that until they were granted representation in local government, they should not be required to pay taxes separately from men. As a result of their protests, four women received seats on the local council, and the taxation of women was ended.\nSchool tax protest, France, 1947\nCatholic priests from Vendée, upset that the government was taxing Catholic fundraising events for Catholic schools to use the tax money to exclusively support non-Catholic schools, refused to pay the tax and went on trial in 1947.\nThe birth of the modern war tax resistance movement, 1948\nIn 1948, a Chicago conference on \"More Disciplined and Revolutionary Pacifist Activity\" attracted more than 300 people, and resulted in the formation of the group Peacemakers and its \"Tax Refusal Committee.\" This is considered to be the birth of the modern organized war tax resistance movement in the United States.\nMonteverde, 1951\nSeveral Quaker conscientious objectors from the United States left the country and founded a settlement in Monteverde, Costa Rica, to no longer be forced to pay taxes for the United States military (Costa Rica had abolished its own military a few years earlier).\nOaxaca, 1952\nA general strike in Oaxaca in 1952 was directed against the government's new tax plan.

The government responded by arresting 15 of them, and the resisters switched tactics to vastly underpay the tax as a way of resisting without risking immediate criminal sanctions.\nSouth China, 1952\nFour hundred farmers were arrested for tax refusal in southern China in 1952. The farmers claimed that the taxes would leave them hopelessly impoverished.\nSocial Security tax protests, 1951–53\nIn 1952, Louisiana newspaper editor Mary Cain protested against social security taxes by refusing to pay, concealing her assets, and even sawing the lock off of her business's front door when it was closed by the tax collector and mailing the lock to the Internal Revenue Service.\nFrom 1951 to 1954, a group of \"Texas Housewives\" refused to pay social security taxes on the wages of their domestic help, and took their resistance all the way to the Supreme Court (where they lost their case).\nPoujadism, 1955\nIn 1955, a right-wing, anti-tax, middle-class, populist movement led by Pierre Poujade began resisting taxes in France. The resisters used a variety of tactics, including strikes, harassment of tax collectors, disruption of government auctions, and running for office (several Poujadists were elected to the Chamber of Deputies).\nNo Taxation Without Representation in D.C., 1955–present\nIn 1955 District of Columbia resident Florence Jaffray Harriman announced that she would be refusing to pay federal income tax until the federal government enacted \"home rule\" (a locally elected government) for the District (something the District was not granted until 1973).\nIn 1990, the non-voting Congressional representative from the district, Walter Fauntroy, started a similar tax resistance campaign for D.C. statehood.\nFormer District of Columbia council member Carol Schwartz, upset at the lack of Congressional representation for people in the district, threatened to start resisting her federal income taxes over the issue in 2011 and called on other D.C. residents to join her.\nJ. Bracken Lee, 1956\nUtah Governor J. Bracken Lee stopped paying federal income tax in 1956 to protest what he felt was unconstitutional federal spending.

See  and  (this exemption also covers Medicare taxes).\nTax resistance in Ethiopia, 1943–68\nThere were several outbreaks of armed resistance focused on tax complaints in Ethiopia. In some cases, farmers defaulted on their taxes and abandoned their land rather than pay, some fleeing into neighboring countries. In others, districts refused to elect or admit tax assessors, and used a mix of persuasion and coercion to prevent people from obeying the tax law.\nTurks in Cyprus, 1958\nDuring the struggle over the future of Cyprus in the late 1950s, Turkish communities refused to pay taxes to Greek-run municipalities.\nSt. Regis Reservation resistance, 1959\n200 Indians on the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation in New York, led by Wallace \"Mad Bear\" Anderson, refused to pay state income taxes \"and threatened to use summonses from the Tax Department 'to light the fires in our longhouses.'\"\nTithe resistance in Malaysia, early 1960s\nIn 1960, the Malaysian government converted the traditional Islamic zakāt (tithe) paid voluntarily by rice farmers into a mandatory tax payable through the government. Opposition to the new government-controlled tithe was, at least in some places, \"unanimous and vehement,\" and rice farmers developed a number of tactics to resist the tithes, successfully reducing the government's take to a fraction of what the law allowed.\nTax resistance by the \"Johnson cult,\" 1964\nIn the \"Johnson cult\" protest in Papua New Guinea (in which locals ostensibly intended to raise money to purchase U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and install him as their political leader), the protesters raised money for their unusual plan by withholding the £2 poll tax from the government.\nA court in the United Kingdom rejects war tax resistance, 1968\nIn 1968, in the UK case of Cheney v. Conn, an individual objected to paying a tax that, in part, would be used to procure nuclear arms in unlawful contravention, he contended, of the Geneva Conventions. His claim was dismissed by the court, the judge ruling that \"What the [taxation] statute itself enacts cannot be unlawful, because what the statute says and provides is itself the law, and the highest form of law that is known to this country.\"\nThere remains in the United Kingdom a significant movement of people who wish to withhold the percentage of their taxes used for war and weapons, but instead contribute them into a ring fenced pool for peace-building or peacekeeping purposes. This may be either for religious or economic reasons. See the website Peace Pays or the Peace Tax campaign \"Conscience,\" which produces an alternative tax return form to document the withholding of the military percentage of your taxes (approximately 12% of the total tax bill in the UK).\nVietnam War, 1968–72\nIn early 1968, 458 writers and editors put full-page ads in the New York Post, New York Times Book Review and Ramparts, declaring their intention to refuse to pay a proposed 10% Vietnam War surtax.

Thompson, Lew Welch, John Wieners, Kurt Vonnegut and Howard Zinn.\nAn estimated 70 signed on later.\nIn 1970, five Harvard and nine M.I.T. faculty members, including Nobel laureates Salvador E. Luria and George Wald, announced that they would be resisting taxes in protest of the war.\nIn 1972, Jane Hart, wife of U.S. Senator Philip Hart, said that she would be resisting the federal income tax. By this time, every major I.R.S. center had a staff member assigned to be the \"Viet Nam Protest Coordinator.\"\nAlso in 1972, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania decided the case of United States v. Malinowski. That case involved John Paul Malinowski, an instructor in theology at St. Joseph's College and a member of the Philadelphia War Tax Resistance League protesting the use of tax money in the Vietnam War. The taxpayer had filed a false Form W-4, and admitted he knew that he was not legally entitled to claim the exemptions (that is, the allowances) he claimed on the W-4.

According to one source \"The no-tax directive of the Sheikh was followed so vigorously by both individuals and organizations that no one gave any taxes and no organization dared charge any. Even the two posh hotels of Dacca became accessible to middle-income people when food prices were drastically reduced for non-collection of taxes. The whole Income Tax Department was closed down making it quite impossible for the central government to assess and collect direct taxes from individuals and corporations.\"\nAnti-abortion tax resistance, 1971–\nCanadian anti-abortion activist Joe Borowski began refusing to pay federal income tax in 1971 in protest against government-funded abortions.\nDavid Little also refused to pay his Canadian federal taxes starting in 2000 for the same reason.\nIn 1973, Brendan Finnegan, an American farmer began refusing to pay his taxes, and said he would continue \"until our government passes and enforces law to protect the unborn from abortion.\" Another American, John Kelly, expatriated with his family to Ireland in 1975 to avoid paying taxes for abortions in the United States. American Michael Bowman began refusing to pay federal taxes for reasons of conscientious objection to abortion funding in 1997, and has been fighting in court for the right to legally resist such payments since then.\nThe Pope John XXIII Community in Italy started practicing conscientious objection to taxation for abortion in 1990.\nIn 2009, Randall Terry, a prominent American anti-abortion activist, wrote:\nAs we pour our hearts and souls into the battle to keep the slaughter of the innocent by abortion out of any health care bill, the discussion has emerged as to whether it is an ethically viable option to refuse to pay part or all of our federal taxes.\nSome well meaning souls have already—perhaps without much thought—repeated our Lord’s oft quoted statement: “Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s, and unto God that which is God’s.”\nThe simple question is this: does this statement of our Lord apply in a situation like the present? If we know that Caesar is going to use the money to kill our neighbor—one of God’s children—are we required, by God Himself, to give the money to our political leaders?\nI think the answer is self-evidently, “No!”\nEfforts to legalize conscientious objection to military taxation, 1972–\nIn 1972 United States Congressman Ron Dellums introduced legislation that would legalize a form of conscientious objection to military taxation, allowing some taxpayers to designate their taxes for non-military spending only. Advocated by National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund, this legislation is regularly reintroduced in the United States Congress and has a number of cosponsors.

In 1978, voters in California passed Proposition 13, sponsored by Howard Jarvis and passed overwhelmingly by voters in 1978, which drastically limited property tax levels in the state.\nIn subsequent years, the state initiative process, initially championed by Populists and progressives, has been increasingly used for such purposes by conservative and corporate political forces. In the United States, notable examples include a series of initiatives in Oregon (see Oregon tax revolt) and Washington (see Tim Eyman), the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) in Colorado, and Proposition 2 in Massachusetts.\nSales Tax Boycott in Ottawa, 1981\nIn 1981, a tax resistance campaign in Ontario targeted the provincial sales tax and included both merchants and consumers as participants.\nPalestine, doctors in 1981\nDoctors in Gaza City refused to pay a 12% income tax to the Israeli occupation and were supported by a two-day general strike.\nArchbishop Hunthausen resists, 1982\nIn 1982, Catholic Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle, Washington, announced that he would be refusing to pay half of his income tax in protest against the nuclear arms race.\nCiting a previous pastoral letter he wrote on the subject, Archbishop Hunthausen stated that certain laws may he peacefully disobeyed under serious conditions, and that there may be times \"when disobedience may be an obligation of conscience.\"\n\"I believe,\" he said, \"that the present issue is as serious as any the world has faced.

At the time,  The people of Beit Sahour responded to this call with an unusually organized and citywide tax strike. As a result of the tax strike, Israeli military authorities placed the town under curfew for 45 days and seized goods belonging to citizens in raids.\nIsrael's military forces had the authority, independent from the rest of the Israeli government, to create and enforce taxes in occupied areas. As a result, they would impose taxes on Palestinians as collective punishment measures to discourage the intifada, for instance \"the glass tax (for broken windows), the stones tax (for damage done by stones), the missile tax (for Gulf War damage), and a general intifada tax, among others\".\nAmong those prominent in Beit Sahour's tax resistance were Ghassan Andoni and Elias Rishmawi. Some tax resistance continued in Beit Sahour for some years after the end of the 1989 tax strike there\nUK Poll Tax, 1989–93\nIn 1989–90, the government of Margaret Thatcher reformed local taxation in Britain by replacing Domestic Rates with a new tax known officially as the Community Charge, but more widely and disparagingly known as the \"Poll Tax\". Whereas Rates had been, at least to some extent, a progressive tax, the Poll Tax was a flat tax irrespective of income. Many people considered the new tax to be unfair, and a major non-payment campaign saw up to 30% of the population of some council areas refusing to pay. Draconian enforcement measures caused civil unrest, and ultimately led to the Poll Tax riots. The new tax became a major electoral liability for the Conservative Party, and was a significant factor in the ousting of Mrs Thatcher by her own party.  Due to its unpopularity and the disastrous impact of non-payment on local authority finances, the tax was replaced by the Council Tax in 1993.\nCameroon, 1991\nIn 1991 Cameroon's major opposition political parties called for tax resistance in support of their campaign to end one-party rule.\nNative Americans in Canada, 1994\nFor 29 days in 1994, a group of Native Americans occupied one floor of the building housing the Revenue Canada Taxation Centre in downtown Toronto, in protest of Canada's plans to tax Native Americans who had previously been exempted from taxation as a result of treaty provisions.

The tax resistance campaign is being organized by Catalunya Diu Prou (\"Catalonia Says 'Enough'\"), which says that some freelancers and independent businesses, which are responsible for their own tax withholding, will follow suit.\nIn 2019, another tax resistance initiative, Ni 1 euro x a la repressió (\"Not one euro for repression\") was launched. Modeled on the Spanish war tax resistance movement, it urged people stop paying and then to redirect the portion of their taxes that would otherwise go to pay for the Spanish monarchy, and those elements of the Spanish government that suppress Catalan independence. By this time, some 17,000 Catalan taxpayers were paying their federal taxes to the Catalan tax agency rather than to the Spanish one, in acts of civil disobedience. A reboot of this campaign launched in 2020 under the name Prou Monarquia (\"Enough Monarchy\"), boosted by former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont.\nIn 2020, Catalan president Quim Torra called on municipalities in Catalonia to withhold taxes from the central government's Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces.\nIn early 2021, the city government of Vic, the capital of the Osona comarca, decided to stop remitting its taxes to the Spanish federal government, but instead to send those taxes to the Catalan government. The Catalan government currently forward these taxes to Spain, so for now this is mostly a symbolic campaign. Vic was soon joined by joined by Girona, capital of Girona province, and some other medium-sized towns.\nLater that year, the separatist group \"Council for the Republic\" began asking individual resisters to redirect €300 of their taxes from the central government to the Republican Fund for Solidarity Action.\nIn 2022, the Catalan independence group Assemblea Nacional Catalana asked the Generalitat de Catalunya to give formal legal protection to taxpayers who send their taxes to the Catalan regional government rather than to the Spanish central government.\nRoad toll resistance in Argentina, 2011\nArgentine congresswoman Griselda Baldata noticed that nobody was maintaining the road on Route 36, but that the company in charge of maintenance was still collecting a toll.

Some people and groups who opposed these measures adopted tax resistance as a protest tactic, for instance in Spain, Germany, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, and Ireland.\nBefore the victory of the Greek Syriza party in the 2015 elections, it had sponsored a \"Have Not, Pay Not\" tax resistance movement targeting the Enfia tax. The party's opposition to this tax was one of the factors in its popularity, and many people stopped paying the tax when it became likely that Syriza would win the elections and do away with the tax entirely.\nBut Syriza found itself unable to resist raising taxes when it came into power, and citizens fought back. One anarchist / antiauthoritarian coalition sabotaged more than 200 public transit fare-enforcement machines. The government, finding it difficult to raise money through straightforward taxation, increasingly relies on increases in fares, highway tolls, and utility bills. By 2017, 40% of Greeks were unable (or unwilling) to pay their utility bills. Some Greeks used devices that interfere with electricity meters, while others enlisted Den Plirono (\"Won't Pay\" movement) activists to reconnect the power to their homes when they were cut off for failure to pay the electric bill.\nA similar \"Don't Pay U.K.\" movement emerged in response to steep rises in utility bills in the United Kingdom in 2022. This was followed by a German campaign, modeled on the U.K. one, called Wir zahlen nicht, and another in Lebanon, in 2023.\nResistance against the \"household tax\" in Ireland, 2012–15\nA group (including Teachtaí Dála Joe Higgins, Clare Daly, Joan Collins, Richard Boyd Barrett, Mick Wallace, Thomas Pringle and Séamus Healy, European Parliamentarian Paul Murphy, and councillors Ruth Coppinger and Ted Tynan) promoted a campaign of resistance against the \"stealth tax\" of increased household and water rates. A campaign spokesperson explained: \"This is not a charge to fund your local community, it is a tax to fund private speculators, bondholders and the bailout. Our incomes and services are being decimated to pay this private debt. Now people have a chance to register their opposition by not registering for this tax. By not registering, we can make this a referendum on the bailouts for the rich and the cuts for us.\" By the deadline, only about half of the households in Ireland that were required to register and pay had done so. On 6 May 2013, the Revenue Commissioners reported that 1.2 m households (74%) have paid the property tax. In August 2013, the Revenue said 1.58 m households have paid the tax, and over €175 m has been collected. In 2014, Irish Water workers trying to install the water meters were met with blockades. In February 2015, Murphy and three others were arrested and then released without charges, reportedly part of an investigation into a November 2014 Jobstown protest that trapped Tánaiste Joan Burton in her car for over two hours.\nSpanish autonomists, 2012–14\nAutonomists in Spain, under the banner \"derecho de rebelión\" (right of rebellion), launched a multifaceted tax resistance campaign designed to redirect taxes from the Spanish government (which they felt had overstepped Constitutional bounds and unlawfully usurped power) to locally organized autonomous projects.\nIndonesia, 2012\nA tax resistance movement began in Indonesia in protest of the government's prioritizing of payments to bankers and other large bondholders during the economic downturn.\nHonduras\nCrime syndicates / protogovernments rule the streets in many parts of Honduras, and these often extort more money from their subjects than does the internationally recognized Honduran government. Some people resist these taxes, known locally as \"impuesto de guerra\" or \"war tax,\" but the consequences of refusal can be, and frequently are, deadly. Eight bus company employees in Choloma, for instance, were gunned down in broad daylight, a block away from a police station and by attackers in police uniforms, in retaliation against drivers who did not pay the tax. In May, 2013 bus drivers there took collective action, going on strike to demand better security.\nSalta, Argentina, 2013\nGuillermo Durand Cornejo, president of an argentinian consumer rights organization called CODELCO, and a legislative representative, called on Salteños (citizens of Salta, Argentina) to refuse to pay a municipal tax, in the wake of property tax increases and new taxes in electricity and water bills.\n\"Until such time as the mayor gives a response to the people concerning the tax hike, I suggest that you do not pay this month's municipal tax,\" he said. \"I call for civil disobedience.\"\nCornejo said he views a thirty-day tax strike as a wake up call for the government, and suggested that strikers who restrict their strike to a single month will not be subject to government reprisals.\nEgypt, 2013\nEgyptian activists are withholding bus and subway fares as a protest against their government's continuing repression. \"We are calling for civil disobedience — not to pay for the metro and buses...\" one said. \"They're taking that money and bringing tools to repress us. They bring bird shot, and tear gas, poison gas even.\"\nMadagascar, 2013\nBusinesses in Madagascar refused to submit taxes to the government, depositing the money in an escrow account instead. The businesses, which represent a large percentage of the country's tax base, were reacting to a crisis of stability and perceived legitimacy in the government. According to the chair of the Madagascar's Enterprises Union, \"We no longer know with what kind of authorities we should deal at this stage.\"\nTax protesters in Canada\nThe tax protester phenomenon, which had long been part of the national tax scene in the United States, emerged as a difficulty for the Canadian government as well. By 2013, about 400 cases were pending in the Tax Court of Canada — \"most using florid and arcane language and claiming bizarre laws that supersede or nullify Canada's regulations and laws; it prompted the Tax Court to adopt a triage approach to cope with the deluge, grouping cases and directing them to specific judges.\"\nBonnets rouges in Brittany, 2013–14\nIn late 2013, a nationalist movement in Brittany called the bonnets rouges began destroying highway portals that were designed to tax truck transportation in the region. They eventually destroyed hundreds of these portals – as well as the tax office in Morlaix – leading the French government to abandon the tax.\nPos me salto in Mexico, passe livre in Brazil, and Planka.nu in Sweden, 2013–14\nWhen the Mexico City government hiked transit fares by two-thirds, frustrated commuters started leaping the turnstiles, both alone and in organized groups, in a form of protest they call pos me salto (\"well, then, I'll jump\").\nAt around the same time, a similar movement called passe livre was engaged in similarly motivated actions in Brazil.\nThe similar Planka.nu movement in Sweden went a step further, initiating a mutual insurance plan: For a €12 monthly fee, the plan insures contributors against any tickets they are given for being caught without a ticket — compare this to €100 for a monthly transit pass, or €150 for a fare evasion citation. The plan is running at a profit, taking in about twice as much from subscribers as it has had to pay out in fine reimbursements.\nCrete, 2014–16\nThousands of Cretans each paid only a single euro of their road taxes in a protest there. The action was organized by \"People Stop Paying,\" a group that protested against rising taxes at a time of increasing economic difficulties, and that the taxes were not actually going to crucially needed road improvements. That group also organized protests at government auctions of seized property.\nTunisian taxi drivers, 2014\nTaxi drivers in Tunisia reacted to a new tax on motorists by posting signs in the windows of their cabs reading \"I will not pay tax!\" and daring the police to try to enforce the new taxes against them.\nBusinesses in Apatzingán, 2014\nSome business leaders in Apatzingán, a city in the Tierra Caliente region of Michoacán, finding that the government was giving them no protection from the Knights Templar Cartel, decided to stop paying taxes.\nEuromaidan, 2014\nDuring the Euromaidan in Ukraine in early 2014, a group of business owners in Lviv announced that they would stop paying value-added and income taxes to the Ukraine central government of Viktor Yanukovych (taxes that went to maintain the military and internal security forces).\n\"Protesta fiscale ad oltranza\", 2014\nIn northern Italy, a group of small businesses united under the banner \"protesta fiscale ad oltranza\" (tax protest to the bitter end) refuse paying taxes, claiming that the Constitution requires the government to leave them enough to live on and that they should not be forced to borrow money to pay the government.\nFor example, when bed and breakfast owner Alessandra Marazzi discovered that fully 84% of what she was bringing in was going to pay taxes and state-monopolized utility fees, she decided to stop paying taxes just so her business (and her family) could survive. Caterer Andrea Polese stopped paying and put a sign on her door reading \"I am a tax resister.\" Bar owner Mariano Pavanello posted a selfie with a sign saying \"I decided to stop paying protection money to a state thief.\"\nVenetian independence movement, 2014–19\nAfter the majority of Venetians who responded to a plebiscite voted to secede from Italy and restore the Venetian Republic, one of the first acts of the organizers of the plebiscite was to decree that the people of Venice were now free from obligations to pay taxes to the Italian state. Gianluca Busato, one of the drivers behind the initiative, went so far as to say that \"The payment of taxes to foreign governments [e.g. Italy's], as well as immoral, it's illegal.\" The separatists claimed that 3,407 businesses initially signed on to the tax strike, and as many as 93,000 others may be resisting less openly.\nIn 2016, the government struck back, arresting 20 people in 19 raids in Vicenza, Treviso, and Verona and charging them with inciting tax evasion.\nIn 2019, separatists again refused to pay their federal taxes to Italy, redirecting them instead to Veneto State.\nAnti-corruption resistance in Austria, 2014\nSome business owners in Austria, notably Wolfgang Reichl and Gerhard Höller, began paying their federal taxes into escrow accounts rather than turning them over to the government, largely in protest over the Hypo scandal.

Asked what they would do if the government responded by cutting off utility service to the province, province Information Minister Mushtaq Ghani said that they would retaliate by cutting off the neighboring province of Punjab from the power generated by the Tarbela Dam, which is located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nUmbrella Movement, 2014–15\nAs Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement began to move away from the Occupy Central mode of street protests, it began to promote tax refusal and refusal to pay rent in government-run housing. Benny Tai Yiu-Ting, one of the movement's organizers, wrote: \"Blocking government may be even more powerful than blocking roads. Refusal to pay taxes, delaying rent payments by tenants in public housing estates and filibustering in the Legislative Council, along with other such acts of noncooperation, could make governing more inconvenient. No government can govern effectively if the majority of its people are unwilling to cooperate.\"\nPuerto Rico, 2015\nFoes of a new 16% value-added tax in Puerto Rico launched consumer and business strikes there, including a \"No Consumption Day\" on 3 March 2015.\nVitebsk, Belarus, 2015\nMerchants at the Polatsk marketplace in Vitebsk, Belarus went on strike and refused to pay taxes in March, 2015 to protest government harassment of traders who had not purchased enough official paperwork.\nEthiopian-Jewish Israelis, 2015\nPolice brutality, discrimination, and mistreatment towards Israel's Ethiopian Jewish minority led Shlomo Molla, one of the few Ethiopian-Israelis to have been in the Israeli parliament, to call for tax resistance, refusal to serve in the army, and other forms of civil disobedience.\nBeni, D.R. Congo, 2015–22\nResidents of Beni, Democratic Republic of the Congo, launched a tax strike to protest the government's failure to provide them with adequate security against atrocities committed by the Allied Democratic Forces insurgency.

The law and Constitution of Kenya allows for peaceful protest to get one's rights. I hope we all stand together on this, so that we get the service we need.\"\nIndian taxpayers union, 2016\nAnjali Damania and Alyque Padamsee started a taxpayers union and launched a tax strike to protest government corruption in India. They were emboldened by a ruling from Justice Arun Chaudhari of the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, in which he said\nTo eradicate the cancer of corruption — the \"hydra-headed monster,\" it is now a high time for the citizens to come together to tell their governments that they have had enough. That is the miasma of corruption.
