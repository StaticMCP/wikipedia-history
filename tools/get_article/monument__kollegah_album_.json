The album is Kollegah's first solo album since 2016's Imperator. The double album also included his tenth mixtape Hoodtape Volume 3.\nBackground and release\nKollegah released his third collaborative studio album alongside German rapper Farid Bang, Jung Brutal Gutaussehend 3, in December 2017. The album became an immediate success for them, debuting on the pole positions in German-speaking Europe and being certified platinum by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) and gold by the IFPI Austria. Following a controversy about antisemitic lyrics on the bonus EP §185, both rappers released Platin war gestern in August 2018.\nKollegah announced Monument on 1 October 2018. It was released by Alpha Music Empire, Kollegah's record label. On 1 October 2018, the limited box set was made available to pre-order on Amazon for €43.99.\nTrack listing\nCredits adapted from Spotify.\n| extra3        =\n| length3       = 3:01\n| title4        =
