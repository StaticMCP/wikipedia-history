The presiding deity is Shiva in the form of Veerateswarar and his consort is known as Elavar Kuzhali. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, the 276 temples that find mention in it.\nAs per Hindu legend, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons and the eight Ashta Veeratanam temples are built signifying each of his victories. The temple is counted one of the eight where Shiva is believed to have punished Jalandhara.\nThe temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:30&nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&nbsp;p.m., and few yearly festivals on its calendar. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty during the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple is maintained and administered by the Dharmapuram Aadhenam.\nLegend\nIn the Shiva Purana, when Indra and Brihaspati were going towards Mount Kailash to meet Shiva, they met a mendicant on the way who was Shiva himself. Indra did not recognize and was asking him about the whereabouts of Shiva, for which the medicant did not reply. Getting infuriated, Indra used his weapon, the Vajrayudam on Shiva. Shiva was angry at Indra and immediately opened the third eye to destroy Indra. Brihaspati recognized Shiva and prayed to him, requesting him to pardon Indra. To avoid killing Indra, Shiva directed the fire from his eye towards the ocean. The fire when it met with the ocean created an asura who Brahma named Jalandhara as he was born out of ocean. He also told the celestial deities that since he emanated from the third eye of Shiva, he can be killed only by Shiva.\nJalandhara under the aegis of the Guru Sukracharya became very powerful. He defeated all celestial deities and Indra. Indra along with other deities prayed to Shiva to destroy the demon. Jalandhara in the meanwhile, married Tulasi (also called Vrinda), the daughter of the Asura Kalanemi. Her chastity and devotion to the husband, made him even more powerful. Shiva appeared as Veerateewarar (also called Jalandharavathamurthy) There was severe fight between the Shiva and Jalandhara in Virkudi, with both showing equal prowess. Each time Shiva appeared overpowering Jalandhara, Tulasi's chastity was sving him. Vishnu in the meanwhile tricked Tulasi by appearing as a sage and bringing bad dreams to her. She approached the sage for relief, who created a mirage showing Jalandhara being killed by Shiva with the sage bringing him back to life. Tulasi was happy with the replica of Jalandhar, who was Vishnu himself. She lost her chastity on account of the incident. Shiva in the meanwhile, challenged Jalandhara to break a chariot, which he could not. Shiva killed the demon with the chariot. Tulasi, in the meanwhile cursed Vishnu that he would turn into a stone. Pleased by the devotion of her, Vishnu gave her a boon that she will be part of every Vishnu worship and she would acquire equal place in his heart as Lakshmi. Jalandhar, being born out of Shiva, got merged into Shiva.\nArchitecture\nThe temple is located in Thiruvirkudi, a village  away from Moongilkudi in Mayiladuthurai - Thiruvarur road.
