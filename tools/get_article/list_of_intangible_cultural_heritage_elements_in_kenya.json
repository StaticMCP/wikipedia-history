As part of a country's cultural heritage, they include celebrations, festivals, performances, oral traditions, music, and the making of handicrafts. The \"intangible cultural heritage\" is defined by the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, drafted in 2003 and took effect in 2006. Inscription of new heritage elements on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists is determined by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, an organisation established by the convention.\nKenya signed the convention on 24 October 2007.\nIntangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\nGood Safeguarding Practices\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! style=\"width:25%\" | Name\n!
