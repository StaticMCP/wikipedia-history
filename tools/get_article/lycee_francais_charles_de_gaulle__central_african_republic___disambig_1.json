The school serves levels maternelle (preschool) through lycée (senior high school). As of October 2013 there were 182 students. Most students were CAR citizens and several were binationals. A small number included French and other nationalities.\nThe école française Charles-de-Gaulle and the Lycée Franco-Centrafricain André-Malraux merged on 1 September 1992, forming the Charles de Gaulle. French expatriates operating the school left the capital in 2013 due to the Central African Republic conflict.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [http://lfcdg.websco.fr Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle]\n*  [http://www.ambafrance-cf.org/Le-lycee-Charles-de-Gaulle Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle] - French Embassy in CAF\n\n---\n\n## Lycée français Charles de Gaulle (Central African Republic)\n\n#REDIRECT Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle (Central African Republic)"
