GIFA was founded by the consulting firm Edbiz (and currently managed by Cambridge IFA) as part of its advocacy for Islamic banking and finance.\nGIFA laureates\nEvery year, the Awards Committee of GIFA elects a head of state or government (or a leading personality equivalent in stature and significance) as winner of its top award, called Global Islamic Finance Leadership Award. The winner is also known as GIFA Laureate.\nSince the inception of GIFA in 2011, it has announced 12 GIFA laureates:\n*Abdullah Badawi, Former Prime Minister of Malaysia - 2011\n*Sultan Nazrin Shah of the Malaysian State of Perak - 2012\n* Shaukat Aziz, Former Prime Minister of Pakistan - 2013\n* Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan - 2014\n*Muhammadu Sanusi II, Emir of Kano, Nigeria - 2015\n* Joko Widodo, President of the Republic of Indonesia - 2016\n*Ismail Omar Guilleh, President of the Republic of Djibouti - 2017\n*Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina (President of Bosnia-Herzegovina) - 2018\n*Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa - 2019\n* Arif Alvi, President of Pakistan - 2020\n*Ma'ruf Amin, Vice President of Indonesia - 2021\n*Abiy Ahmed Ali, Prime Minister of Ethiopia - 2022\n*Macky Sall, President of Senegal - 2023\nGIFA categories\nTop Awards include: [1] Global Islamic Finance Leadership Award (Individual Category); [2] Global Islamic Finance Leadership Award (Country Category); and [3] Global Islamic Finance Leadership Award (Institutional Category).
