Kingsland is under the local governance of the Auckland Council. It is the home of Eden Park, New Zealand's largest stadium, which hosted the finals for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Kingsland has a village centre that contains a series of shops, restaurants, pubs and monthly markets.\nKingsland was established in the 1880s with the sale of allotments; the buildings predominantly date from the Edwardian and the interwar periods.New North Road is the main thoroughfare in Kingsland, running northeast–southwest from the Auckland Central Business District (CBD), with the suburb running along the ridge line. Kingsland's main street is located on New North Road next to the Kingsland railway station and directly across from Eden Park.\nHistory\nMuch of the Kingsland area was originally swampland, and known to Tāmaki Māori as Ngā Anawai, referring to the water-filled lava-flow caves that formed in the area. The lava caves were created by Maungawhau / Mount Eden and Mount Albert over 30,000 years ago.\nThe origins of Kingsland are linked to the European settlement of Auckland. In 1835, Thomas Mitchell, a Sydney trader, purchased land from Āpihai Te Kawau, rangatira (chief) of the local Māori tribe, Ngāti Whātua, for £160, in a transaction which the Lands Claim Commission later disallowed. In 1841, Te Kawau gifted  to the colonial government and Auckland began to take shape as a city. Land continued to be bought and sold, and in 1852 John McElwain purchased  for the purpose of farming and received the adjoining  from his brother George in what is present-day Kingsland. Cabbage Tree Swamp Road was one of the original streets in the area, but the settlers of Mt Albert, Morningside and Kingsland appealed for a change of name, and it became Kingsland Road in 1877.\nThe terrain of the area was rough, meaning the area saw slower development compared to other parts of the Auckland isthmus. In the 1860s, New North Road was established as road access for the area and as an alternative to the Great North Road to the north. In October 1866, the Mt Albert District Highway Board, the first local government in the area, was formed to administer New North Road and surrounding areas. A tollbooth in modern-day Kingsland was established on the corner of New North Road and Cabbage Tree Swamp Road (modern-day Sandringham Road), which operated from 1875 until 1888.\nKingsland railway station opened on 29 March 1880, spurring suburban growth in the area. The city of Auckland experienced significant growth in population in the latter 19th century, putting pressure on the areas closest to the city. That population growth combined with the establishment of rail and bus connections into the city by the early 1880s created excellent conditions for John McElwain to subdivide his farm. In 1882, 227 allotments were laid out. Kingsland Avenue — along with First, Second, Third and Fourth Avenues — provided road access to the properties. Prices for sections in the subdivision ranged from £28 to £100. In addition to McElwain's Kingsland Estate, other suburban housing estates developed in the Kingsland area, including the Randersvyl Estate and Roganville.\nA second wave of growth occurred in the early 1900s, then the Auckland tramline reached Kingsland in 1903. The community was centred around Arthur W. Page's general store on New North Road, which was soon joined by multiple new shops. New housing estates including Hirstleigh, Leith Hall and Melvia subdivided more land around Kingsland into suburban homes, and by the 1910s ingsland had developed into a working class commuter suburb of Auckland.\nA. W. Page and his brother, builder Charles H. Page, extended his store in 1913 and 1914, and constructed the Portland Building. A new post office was built in Kingsland in 1912, joined by St George's Anglican Church in 1913 and a cinema, the Theatre Royal, in 1915. Eden Park became a major sporting venue for cricket and rugby in the 1910s and 1920s, but was plagued by regular drainage issues.\nIn 1938, 84 residents of Kingsland launched an unsuccessful petition to change the suburb's name to Beverly Hills, citing the poor reputation of the name Kingsland.\nThe Kingsland commercial village flourished in the 1950s and 1960s, and by the 1970s the suburb had becoming a centre for Urban Māori and Pasifika communities, due to the gentrification of the inner city suburbs close to the Auckland city centre. During this period, Kingsland became one of the densest populated suburbs in Auckland, known for overcrowded houses in disrepair. The Northwestern Motorway was cut through in the 1970s, severing the cross streets that linked Kingsland to Surrey Crescent and Arch Hill, leaving Bond St as the sole direct connection to these suburbs. In 1997, Kog Transmissions, a large recording studio and independent label for New Zealand musicians, was established in the suburb. Musicians including Concord Dawn, P-Money and Pitch Black recorded material here, until the studio moved to a new premises in 2010.\nKingsland underwent major urban revitalisation in the early 2000s and again in the early 2010s, when Eden Park and the Kingsland railway station were upgraded for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\nDemographics\nThe statistical area of Kingsland, which includes part of Eden Terrace, covers  and had an estimated population of  as of  with a population density of |R}}/0.77|0}} people per km2.\n}}\nKingsland had a population of 3,162 in the 2023 New Zealand census, a decrease of 210 people (−6.2%) since the 2018 census, and a decrease of 54 people (−1.7%) since the 2013 census.

The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,872 (67.3%) people were employed full-time, 360 (12.9%) were part-time, and 93 (3.3%) were unemployed.\nPolitics\nIn October 1866, the Mt Albert District Highway Board, the first local government in the area, was formed to administer New North Road and the surrounding areas. In 1911, the board became the Mount Albert Borough, who elected a mayor. In 1978, Mount Albert became a city, and in 1989 it was absorbed into Auckland City. In November 2010, all cities and districts of the Auckland Region were amalgamated into a single body, governed by the Auckland Council.\nKingsland is a part of the Albert-Eden local board area. The residents of Albert-Eden elect a local board, and two councillors from the Albert-Eden-Puketāpapa ward to sit on the Auckland Council.\nLandmarks and features\nEden Park\nEden Park is New Zealand's largest stadium with a capacity of 50,000 seats.  Every year it hosts almost half a million local and international sports fans and patrons who attend matches and functions at the park.\nThe park underwent a $240 million, three-year redevelopment prior to the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Including a temporary expansion to 60,000 seats and the addition of four giant Māori carvings at each of the four main public entrances. The carvings represent Tāne-mahuta, the spirit of the forest; Rongo, the god of peace; Tūmatauenga, the god of war; and Tāwhirimātea, the god of wind. The carvings were designed by Ngāti Whātua carver, Arekatera Maihi.\nEden Park was located at the low point of Cabbage Tree Swamp, with the road running on a causeway across it. Eden Park has been used as a sports ground since 1900, and by 1914 the ground was drained and turned into two ovals for cricket.  Eden Park has been the home of Auckland Cricket since 1910 and Auckland Rugby since 1925. Its 100-year history boasts some of New Zealand's proudest sporting moments, including the 1950 Empire Games, the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup, and the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Since the early 1900s it has hosted major rugby and cricket matches, and is now a regular host of the Bledisloe Cup, ITM Cup, and the Super Rugby games. Most recently, Eden Park hosted the finals for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and it has been named the co-host for 2015 Cricket World Cup.\nNotable buildings\nMany of Kingsland's older buildings have survived by adapting to contemporary uses.\n*Shooters Bar (330 New North Road) — The original building was built in the 1910-1920's area, as two independent buildings which later were joined.
