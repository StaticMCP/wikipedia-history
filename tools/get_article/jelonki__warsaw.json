It is a mixed residential area with low-rise single-family neighbourhoods of Stare Jelonki, Nowy Chrzanów, and Friendship Estate, and mid- and high-rise multifamily housing estates of Górczewska, Jelonki, and Lazurowa.

The area is divided into two City Information System areas, Jelonki Północne (North Jelonki) and Jelonki Południowe (South Jelonki).\nJelonki was founded in the 19th century as a small farming community. In the 1920s, its land was partitioned, and the village was developed as a garden suburb. It was incorporated into Warsaw in 1951. In 1952, the Frienship Estate, a neighbourhood of wooden houses was built within its current boundaries, originally providing accommodation for Soviet migrant labourers, and after 1955, for university students and teachers. In the 1970s and 1980s, three large housing estates with mid- and high-rise apartment buildings were constructed, including Górczewska, Jelonki, and Lazurowa.\nToponomy\nThe name Jelonki is a Polish plural diminutive form of the term meaning cervus, a genus of deer which was present in the area. Historically, before 1951, the neighbourhood was also known as Jelonek, a singular diminutive form.\nHistory\nFounding and development\nA small farming community, later known as Jelonki, was established in the area in the 19th century, next to the village of Odolany, to the north of the Poznań Road (now Połczyńska Street). The village was bought by Bogumił Schneider, a businessman, who moved to the area from Westphalia. In the second half of the century, he built his residence in the form of a brick manor house, near the current Fortuny Street. In 1902, he also built a second residence, a wooden villa at the current 59 Połczyńska Street, which stands to this day. In 1904, the village had 729 inhabitants and included 19 houses and a school. After the purchase, the village began being known as Jelonki and Jelonek.\nIn 1846, the Bogumił Schneider Brickworks and Roof Tiles Factory (), in the area, which produced bricks, roof tiles, and ceramics. The factory had a good reputation, being locally known for the good quality of its products. Many houses and tenements in Warsaw were built from its bricks. It was also commissioned by the Imperial Russian Army, to provide materials for the construction of Forts II, III, and IV of the Warsaw Fortress, a series of fortifications built around the city between 1883 and 1890. It extracted the clay for its products locally, leaving behind pits, some of which were later flooded, forming small ponds, including Jelonek and Schneider Clay Pits, which are present within the neighbourhood boundaries to the present day. The factory operated until 1940, when, while under German occupation, it was ordered to be closed down.\nAround 1877, fifteen German settlers founded a hamlet of Nowy Chrzanów, located along the current Okrętowa Street.\nIn 1927, inspired by the garden city movement, the Schneider family divided and sold a portion of their land, promoting the construction of villas and gardens in the village. They also founded a garden and a fruit tree orchard, located around their summer residence, and also drew plans of wide town streets, including Schneider Avenue, which currently forms Powstańców Śląskich Street. In 1932, the settlement had been renamed to Miasto-Ogród Jelonek (Garden Town of Jelonek). A marketplace, known as the John III Sobieski Square, now known as the Castellan Square, was also built there.\nSecond World War\nJelonki and Nowy Chrzanów were captured by German forces in early September 1939 during the siege of Warsaw in the Second World War. On 18 September 1939, they were recaptured in a counter-offensive by the 360th Infantry Regiment of the Polish Armed Forces, commanded by lieutenant colonel Leopold Okulicki. Their forces included four infantry companies, with heavy machine gun platoons, and one mortar platoon. They were also supported by a artillery batteries, a platoon of 7TP light tanks, as well as a company of the Capital Battalion, with the latter being pushed back during the attacks. The motorized platoon suffered heavy loses in an encounter against German Panzer 35(t) light tanks. The villages were captured with severe losses suffered by the Polish infantry, and remained under Polish control until the capitulation of Warsaw on 28 September 1939.\nIn 1943, Jelonki had 3,826 inhabitants.\nExpansion as a suburb\nSince 1867, the area was part of the municipality of Blizne.

In 1947, the village was connected with Warsaw, via the bus route W, between the Wola tram depot and the Castellan Square.\nIn 1943, the Schneiders family donated 28 hectares of their land to the municipality, for the symbolic price of 1 złoty, for the development of streets, churches, schools, preschools, a town hall, and other objects.
