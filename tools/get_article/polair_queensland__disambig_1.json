Its predecessor was called the Police Air Wing, which became operational in 1975 following the purchase of two single-engine aircraft.\nThe QPS operates a number of fixed wing, rotary and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assets spread across various locations around the State.\nThe majority of aircraft of the fleet are kept from public view on most publicly accessible flight tracking apps and websites. This is to preserve investigations, ensure the safety of the crew and aircraft, allow for covert operations, and to prevent suspects from viewing locations of the aircraft.\nHistory\nThe Police Air Wing was established in 1975 with the purchase of two ex-army Cessna 180E aircraft (one was VH-PFM). Four police officers who were qualified pilots were attached to the Wing, with some more commencing flight training.\nThe fixed wing fleet grew, ferrying officers and prisoners across the State.  Aircraft included the all-weather 1982 Beechcraft B200 Super King Air.  By 1980, operations moved from Archerfield aerodrome to all-hours access Brisbane Airport, and one from Cairns.  The Police Air Wing was closed in November 1983 after the creation of the Queensland Government Air Wing, but reconstituted in April 1985 with a portion of the government air wing.  By mid-1986 the Police Air Unit had five pilots, all staff members, not police officers; with four planes (King Air 200, King Air 90, Cessna 402, and Cessna 210) and operating out of Brisbane, Cairns, and Mount Isa.  By the 2000s, an aircraft also operated at Horn Island.\nIn November 2011, a police helicopter 'Polair' was commenced as a trial, funded by the Gold Coast City Council.  'Polair 2' based in Archerfield, Brisbane, commenced in 2012 on trial, before permanent funding commenced in July 2014, and Townsville's Polair launched on 16 January 2024.  The helicopters included a Eurocopter BO 105 Super Five, before the fleet was updated with Bell 429 helicopters in February 2022.\nThe new Commissioner in April 2024 immediately embarked on a coastal provincial tour with Police Minister Ryan and Premier Miles, which saw the announcements of forthcoming funding for Polair rotary-wing in Cairns, and the Sunshine Coast/Wide Bay.\nFixed wing\nCommencing from 1975, the Service operates a varying fleet of aircraft, both single and twin engine, for numerous tasks such as: organ retrievals, Special Emergency Response Team and tactical operator response, prisoner transport, disaster response, aerial surveillance, search and rescue, transporting police officers and senior leaders, transporting state government ministers and other politicians, and transporting freight.\nIn 2018, the nineteen-year-old Cessna 560 Citation jet VH-PSU travelling the Brisbane–Townsville route was subject to a mid-air emergency near Gladstone with an altitude drop, without further incident.\nIn 2022, replacement fleet included the five Beechcraft King Air 360 turboprops, and two Gulfstream G280 jets (replacing the Citation and Hawker jets). At this time, the aviation group was performing six organ retrievals per month, and the new fleet was to have capability to be able to conduct organ retrieval flights anywhere in Australia and New Zealand.\nThere are two dedicated surveillance aircraft: VH-8TT (King Air 360) and VH-PSQ (Cessna 208 Caravan) which both feature electro-optical sensors among other surveillance equipment. Both aircraft are in a non-distinct livery and usually do not appear on civilian flight tracking applications.\nNot all the aircraft feature the QPS Polair livery and identifications which might suggest they are police aircraft.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! width=\"100pt\" scope=\"col\" |Bases\n! width=\"150pt\" scope=\"col\" |Aircraft Type\n! width=\"125pt\" scope=\"col\" |Number in fleet\n! width=\"5pt\" scope=\"col\" |Notes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Brisbane, Cairns, Townsville\n|King Air 360\n|5\n|\n|-\n|King Air 350\n|1\n|\n|-\n|Cessna 208 Caravan\n|3\n|\n|}\nSurveillance and patrol helicopters\nCommencing from November 2011, the surveillance and patrol fleet have a distinctive police livery, and are operated by contractors on behalf of the Service.\nJanuary 2024 saw the introduction of an Airbus H135 twin-engine for Townsville as a temporary measure until a permanent helicopter was procured.  On 3 July 2024, three new Bell 429s replaced two older aircraft, for south-eastern Queensland and equipped with various technologies including night vision capabilities.\nA Bell 429 flight simulator is located at the SLSQ helicopter base at Archerfield Airport, it is used by crew for training purposes. An additional Bell 429 flight simulator has been purchased for the [https://www.meridianhelicopters.com.au/ Meridian Helicopters] operated Far North Capability at Townsville Airport.\nThe aircraft are fitted with high-end infrared electro optical cameras, a spotlight, blue and red emergency lights, public address speakers, video downlink, secure radios, and basic rescue/first aid equipment.\nAll the aircraft in the fleet are twin engine only, as this is a crucial safety feature for flying over populated areas.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! width=\"100pt\" scope=\"col\" |Region\n! width=\"150pt\" scope=\"col\" |Areas served\n! width=\"70pt\" scope=\"col\" |Operator\n! width=\"125pt\" scope=\"col\" |Aircraft type\n! width=\"100pt\" scope=\"col\" |Base\n! width=\"100pt\" scope=\"col\" |Notes\n|-\n!Far Northern\n|Cairns\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://www.meridianhelicopters.com.au/ Meridian Helicopters]\n|Airbus H135\n|Cairns Airport\n| rowspan=\"3\" |H135s to be replaced by two Bell 429s (2024)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Northern\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Townsville\n|Airbus H135\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Townsville Airport\n|-\n|Bell 429\n|-\n!North Coast\n|Wide Bay/Sunshine Coast\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Surf Life Saving Queensland\n|Airbus H135\n|Caloundra Aerodrome\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Southern and Brisbane\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Brisbane, Ipswich, Darling Downs, Logan, Moreton Bay\n|Bell 429\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Archerfield Airport\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Bell 429\n|-\n|Gold Coast\n|Bell 429\n|Southport Airport\n|Formerly based at Carrara Rescue Base\n|}\nRescue and emergency medical helicopters\nFormerly managed by the now-defunct Emergency Management Queensland (EMQ), the fleet is now managed by the QPS Aviation Capability Group. The EMQ helicopters are most commonly referred to as QGAir Rescue, whose primary responsibility is responding to Queensland Ambulance and Queensland Health jobs, conducting search and rescue, disaster response, and occasionally assisting QPS with incidents such as vehicle pursuits, searches, sieges and other emergency situations.\nThe helicopters have saved thousands of lives through emergency medical responses with the onboard doctors supplied by Lifeflight and paramedics, responding to emergency scenes across Queensland and New South Wales, as well as offshore.  The fleet of five helicopters fly more than 3,000 flight hours per year, and an average 2,000 patient rescues and transfers each year.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! width=\"100pt\" scope=\"col\" |Area\n! width=\"125pt\" scope=\"col\" |Aircraft type\n! width=\"100pt\" scope=\"col\" |Base\n! width=\"100pt\" scope=\"col\" |Notes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |North and Central Queensland\n| rowspan=\"3\" |5 x AW139\n|Cairns Airport\n| rowspan=\"3\" |3 x AW139 to replace older aircraft\n|-\n|Townsville Airport\n|-\n!Southern Queensland and northern NSW\n|Archerfield Airport\n|}\nRemotely piloted aircraft systems\nThe aviation wing also overviews the use of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), under the control of the Service Chief Pilot (RPAS).
