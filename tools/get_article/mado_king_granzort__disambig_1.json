It aired in NTV from April 7, 1989, to March 2, 1990. It spawned three special direct-to-video episodes and two Original Video Animation movies, as well as a video game for the PC Engine SuperGrafx. Unlike Mashin Hero Wataru, the series uses both Jewish and gnostic terminology, particularly the Kabbalah.\nPlot\nIn 2050, the moon was mysteriously terraformed after a great moonquake, giving it Earth-like gravity and breathable air. In 2100, fifty years later, the moon is now populated with humans and has become a popular tourist destination. After a boy named Daichi arrives on the moon for summer vacation, he accidentally meets an old witch, V-Mei, and her granddaughter Guri Guri. Both of them are members of the endangered Long-Ears race, currently at war with the evil Jadou Clan, who are also planning to take over Earth. V-Mei gives a magic gun to Daichi and reveals that he is the chosen Madou Warrior destined to save the Long-Ears race and their land Rabiluna from the Jadou Clan.\nWith the magic gun, Daichi can summon Granzort, a giant robot called a Madou King with the elemental power of Earth, to fight against the monsters of the Jadou Clan. During their travels, Daichi, V-Mei, and Guru Guri are later joined by two other Madou Warriors, Gus and Rabi. Gus's magic bow summons Winzart, the Madou King of Wind, while Rabi's magic top summons Aquabeat, the Madou King of Water.\nTheme Songs\n*Opening\n\"Hikari no Senshi-tachi (Soldiers of Light)\" by Kenji Suzuki\nLyrics: You and Hisa Araki, Composer: Yukihide Takekawa, Arranger: Yamamoto Takeshi\n*Ending\n\"Horore chuchu parero\" by Tomoko Tokugaki\nLyrics: You and Hisa Araki, Composition: Kosugi Yasuo, Arrangement: Yamamoto Takeshi\nStaff\n*Planning: Sunrise\n*Original Concept: Hajime Yatate, Ōji Hiroi\n*Planning Assistance: Red Company\n*Character Design: Studio Live\n*Mechanical Design: Kunio Okawara\n*Art Director: Shigemi Ikeda\n*Director of Photography: Atsushi Okui\n*Sound Director: Sadayoshi Fujino\n*Music: Kōhei Tanaka\n*Series Director: Shūji Iuchi\n*Producers: Hibiki Itō, Yuko Sagawa, Takayuki Yoshii, Tamiyuki Tomita\n*Teleplay: Naruhisa Arakawa, Hiroko Naka, Takashi Yamada, Hideki Mitsui, Ryōsuke Takahashi, Yoshitake Suzuki, Shizumu Higa, Shūji Iuchi\n*Animation Directors: Toyoo Ashida, Hiromi Matsushita, Masayuki Uchiyama, Akiyoshi Nakamura, Yûichi Endō, Hiroshi Kōjina, Eisaku Inoue, Kenji Hattori, Atsushi Aono, Takahiro Yoshimatsu\n*Storyboards: Shūji Iuchi, Motosuke Takahashi, Yutaka Kagawa, Mitsuo Fukuda, Masamitsu Hidaka, Nobuhiro Kondō, Jōhei Matsuura, Shōgo Kōmoto\n*Episode Directors: Mitsuo Fukuda, Masamitsu Hidaka, Yutaka Kagawa, Nobuhiro Kondō, Shōgo Kōmoto, Jōhei Matsuura, Ikurō Satō\n*Guest Character Design: Toyoo Ashida, Takahiro Yoshimatsu, Emiko Uesugi\n*Guest Mechanical Design: Hiroshi Fuji\n*Key Animation: Studio Live, Nakamura Production, Studio Mu, Anime R, Last House, AIC, Studio Gain, Studio Emu, Studio Kaatan\n*Inbetween Animation: Project Team Mu, Studio Takuranke, Studio MAX, Studio Gain, Studio Wombat, Studio Emu, Monsieur Onion, Project Team Mu, Studio Mark, Usagiya, Studio Kuma, Echo, Studio G7, Anime Roman, Magic Bus, Last House, SPEC, ABU, Studio Live, Group ZEN, Nakamura Production, Neomedia, Twenty First, Anime R, Sendai Gallop\n*Inbetween Check: Yoshifumi Miyaji, Etsuhito Mori, Kazuhiko Yoshimori, Ryūji Nagasaki, Toshiyuki Kanno\n*Color Key: Reiko Uemura\n*Color Design: Takeshi Mochida, Kenji Chiba, Kinuyo Nozaki, Yoshiko Takiguchi, Masafumi Nitta, Kumiko Matsushita, Eriko Tanaka, Sanae Fukada\n*Special Effects: Matsuko Isono, Mutsuko Shibata, Yasuhiko Komori, Kō Yamamoto\n*Cel Painting: Studio DEEN, Studio Bogey, Just, Studio Kuma, CCR, Echo, Studio G7, Studio Oz, Studio Step\n*Backgrounds: Atelier Musa, Gendai Seisaku Shūdan, Green\n*Photography: Asahi Production, Trans Arts, Coral Reef, T.
