Civil Society is apolitical. On 2005, he joined the presidential political party (PPRD) through its General Secretary, Camarade Vital Kamerhe. Next, he pulled his son Dicko Kasongo from UDPS and introduced him to Vital Kamerhe who appointed him as an Implanter, then he will be retained on the electoral list for the legislative. Actually, he is the Chairperson of the province of Kasai-Oriental in the parliamentary. Katanda Territory elected Kasongo in the parliamentary under the umbrella of RCD/N led by Roger Lumbala on November 28, 2011. Next year, Kasongo's parliamentary mandate had almost been invalidated when the president of their party RCD/N, Roger Lumbala had joined the armed rebellion of the M23. He then responded to the call of his constituency by resigning from RCD/N. On August 30, 2012, he created a new political party, Congolese Alliance for Agriculture and Development (CAAD). As the Caucus Chair of the province of Kasai-Oriental in the Congolese National Assembly, Kasongo Munganga thanked the President Kabila for keeping choosing the prime minister from his province.\nReferences"
