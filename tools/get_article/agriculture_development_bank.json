Hence, rural finance is the principal operational area of ADBL. It has also been executing Small Farmer Development Program (SFDP), the major poverty alleviation program launched in the country. Furthermore, the bank has also been involved in commercial banking operations since 1984.\nThe enactment of the Bank and Financial Institution Act (BAFIA) in February 2004 abolished all Acts related to financial institutions including the ADBN Act, 1967. In line with the BAFIA, ADBL has been incorporated as a public limited company on July 14, 2005. Thus, ADBL operates as an \"A\" category financial Institution under the legal framework of BAFIA and the Company Act. The bank has a 51% share of the Government of Nepal and 49% of the general public. Most of its shareholders are customers and employees.\nIts headquarters is in Ramshah Path, Kathmandu.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.adbl.gov.np/ Official Website]\nADBL Register in Company Act at 2062/3/31 B.c."
