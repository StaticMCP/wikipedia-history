Her parents were Levi Queen and Mary Queen. Mary Queen taught all her children to weave baskets, and the family sold handmade white oak baskets to supplement their farming income.\nCareer\nLottie Queen Stamper learned to rivercane and natural dyes in her weaving after she married into the Stamper family, which included several skilled weavers. She taught basket weaving to Cherokee school students and adult learners for almost thirty years, from 1937 to 1966. Among her students were her niece Eva Wolfe and Rowena Bradley. She learned and taught a rare double-weave basket technique. Stamper was a member of the Southern Highland Craft Guild, and in 1952 was the first Native American to win the guild's lifetime achievement award. In 1959, she also received a lifetime achievement award from the Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board.\nDeath and legacy\nLottie Queen Stamper died in 1987, at the age of 80. Baskets by Stamper and her students were shown as part of \"Transformations: Cherokee Baskets in the 20th Century\" and exhibition at the Mountain Heritage Center in 2006. Work by Stamper also appeared in \"The Story of North Carolina\" at the North Carolina Museum of History in 2011.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://wcudigitalcollection.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p4008coll2/id/4499 An image of Lottie Stamper demonstrating weaving] at the 1948 Craftsman's Fair in Gatlinburg, Tennessee"
