The ceremony was held on 28 April 2012 at the London Studios, Lambeth, and was later broadcast on ITV1 and STV. The publicly voted categories were announced on 27 February 2012, with the vote opening that same day. This included a longlist for the Best Actress and Actor awards. The shortlist, including panel nominations, was released on 5 April 2012.\nITV soap Coronation Street tied with BBC soap EastEnders for winning the most awards of the night, both winning seven. However, EastEnders won the Best British Soap award, as well as taking both the Lifetime and Special Achievement accolades. Both Doctors and Hollyoaks did not win an award, while ITV soap Emmerdale won the remaining three awards, including the award for Best Actor.\nWinners and nominees\nPublicly voted\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
