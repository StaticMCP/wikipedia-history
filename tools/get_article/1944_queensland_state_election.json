The Labor Party, led by premier Frank Cooper, was elected to a fifth term in office, albeit with a reduced majority.\nPrior to the election, the electoral system was changed from contingency voting to first-past-the-post. The change was brought about by the state government three weeks after Labor lost the 1942 Cairns by-election, where it had led on primary votes but lost to King O'Malley Labor in the two-candidate-preferred count. First-past-the-post was in place for Queensland state elections until full preferential voting was introduced by the Country−Liberal coalition in 1963.\nBackground\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Hermit Park branch in Townsville, which had dominated the Townsville City Council since 1939, was expelled from the ALP for alleged disloyalty in 1942, possibly due to association with Communists. Tom Aikens won the seat of Mundingburra at the election. Similar forces saw sitting left-wing members George Taylor (Enoggera) and George Marriott (Bulimba) expelled from the party; the former lost his seat to a QPP candidate, while the latter retained his at the 1944 and 1947 elections. Frank Barnes, a colourful identity who supported social credit theories popular since the Great Depression and declared himself opposed to the Labor government, retained his seat of Bundaberg.\nVarious changes were taking place in conservative politics as well, with the dissolution of the United Australia Party and the formation of the Queensland People's Party (QPP), led by the mayor of Brisbane and member for Hamilton, John Beals Chandler. The two independent conservatives elected in 1941 were both out of parliament by the election — Bruce Pie had resigned to contest the 1943 federal election, whilst William Deacon had died. One of the former United Australia Party members, Louis Luckins (Maree), did not join the QPP originally and retained his seat in 1944 as an independent.\nApart from the above, numerous independent candidates contested with a range of banners, including Democrat, Christian Socialist, Servicemen's Association, People's Party and Independent Country Party, none of them achieving more than a few hundred votes.\nFred Paterson was elected in Bowen, the only member of the Communist Party of Australia to be elected to an Australian parliament.\nCandidates\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable tpl-blanktable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-bottom:0\"\n|+Legislative Assembly (FPTP) – Turnout: 78.17%\n|-\n|colspan=10 align=center|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:200px\" | Party\n! colspan=\"3\" | Primary vote\n! colspan=\"2\" | Seats\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px;\" | Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | %\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | Swing ()\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | Change\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Labor\n| 237,042\n| 46.23\n| –3.51\n| 38\n|  3\n|-\n| bgcolor=406AE0 | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |People's Party\n| 124,573\n| 24.29\n| +24.29\n| 7\n|  7\n|-\n| bgcolor=006946 | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Country\n| 88,608\n| 17.28\n| –2.93\n| 12\n|  6\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Communist\n| 12,467\n| 2.43\n| +1.43\n| 1\n|  1\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | King O'Malley Labor\n| 5,790\n| 1.13\n| +1.13\n| 1\n|  1\n|-\n| bgcolor=CD5C5C | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Hermit Park Labor\n| 5,521\n| 1.08\n| +1.08\n| 1\n|  1\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Frank Barnes Labor\n| 4,180\n| 0.82\n| –0.2\n| 1\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Democratic\n| 999\n| 0.19\n| -1.75\n| 0\n|  2\n|-\n| bgcolor=ffcd78 | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |All Services Association of Australia\n| 325\n| 0.06\n| +0.06\n| 0\n|\n|-\n| bgcolor=002768 | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Christian Socialist\n| 230\n| 0.04\n| +0.04\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Independent\n| 23,680\n| 4.62\n| +0.55\n| 1\n|  1\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Total || 512,768 ||100.00 || ||62||\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Invalid/blank votes|| 9,352 || 1.82 || –0.29 || colspan=2\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Turnout || 512,768 || 78.17 || –6.44 ||colspan=2\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Registered voters || 655,984 ||colspan=2 ||colspan=2\n|}\n|46.23}}\n|17.28}}\n||1.13}}\n|0.82}}\n|4.62}}\n}}\n|61.29}}\n|19.35}}\n|1.61}}\n|1.61}}\n}}\nSeats changing hands\nThis table lists changes in party representation at the 1944 election.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
