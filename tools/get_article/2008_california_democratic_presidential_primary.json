California offered the most delegates out of any nominating contest. Hillary Clinton won the primary with 51.47% of the vote, winning 204 delegates, while Barack Obama got 43.16% of the vote and won 166 delegates.\nProcess\nIn the primary, 370 of California's 441 delegates to the Democratic National Convention were selected. Of these delegates, 241 were awarded at the congressional district level, and the remaining 129 were allocated to candidates based on the primary vote statewide. The remaining delegates were superdelegates not obligated to vote for any candidate at the convention. Candidates were required to receive at least 15% of either the district or statewide vote to receive any delegates. Registered Democrats and Decline to State voters were eligible to vote.\n{| class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! Number of  delegates\n!
