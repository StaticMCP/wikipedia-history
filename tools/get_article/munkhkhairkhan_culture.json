It immediately follows the Afanasievo culture and the Khemtseg culture. It was contemporary with the Andronovo culture, but its very existence suggests that the Androvo culture did not extend far into Mongolia.\nSome of the best known sites of the Munkhkhairkhan culture are Ulaan Goviin Uzuur (UAA) 1&2 and Khukh Khoshuunii Boom (KHU).\nThe domestication of horses using carts for transportation, was one of the characteristics of the Munkhkhairkhan culture.\nThe Munkhkhairkhan culture had tin-bronze knives, of a type thought to have been developed in Western Siberia before 1900 BCE as part of the Seima-Turbino phenomenon. This knife technology was probably then transferred through Munkhkhairkhan to various Chinese cultures, such as the Qijia culture, Erlitou culture or Lower Xiajiadian culture, where very similar knives have been found.\nFile:Bone spoon, Ulaan Goviin, 1800-1600 BCE.jpg|Bone spoon, Ulaan Goviin, 1800-1600 BCE.
