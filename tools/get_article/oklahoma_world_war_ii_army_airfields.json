However other AAF commands, including Second Air Force, Air Technical Service Command (ATSC) and Air Transport Command (ATC) commanded airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nArmy Air Forces Training Command\n* Altus Army Airfield, Altus\n*: AAF Central Flying Training Command\n*: 2508th Army Air Forces Base Unit\n*: Now: 28px Altus Air Force Base\n* Chickasha Field, Chickasha\n*: AAF Central Flying Training Command\n*: 2549th Army Air Forces Base Unit\n*: Now: Chickasha Municipal Airport\n* Cimarron Army Airfield, Cimmaron\n*: AAF Central Flying Training Command\n*: 2508th Army Air Forces Base Unit\n*: Now: Clarence E.
