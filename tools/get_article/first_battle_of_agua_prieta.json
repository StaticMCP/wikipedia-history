After United States troops in Douglas, Arizona were attacked by the Federal Army, the Americans responded by intervening in the battle, which allowed the rebels to briefly take control of the town. The town was recaptured by federal troops two weeks later once additional reinforcements arrived. This battle was a turning point in the Mexican revolution.\nSee also\n*Attacks on the United States\nReferences"
