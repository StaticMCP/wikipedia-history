It was first published in hardcover and trade paperback by Harcourt in April 2001.\nSummary\nThe book collects pieces that won or were nominated for the Nebula Awards for best novel, novella, novelette and short story for the year 2000, a profile of 2000 grand master winner Brian W. Aldiss and a representative early story by him, and various other nonfiction pieces related to the awards, together with the Rhysling Award-winning poems for 1999 and an introduction by the editor. Not all nominees for the various awards are included, and the best novel is represented by an excerpt.\nContents\n*\"Introduction: Nebulas at Century's End\" (Robert Silverberg)\n*\"Story of Your Life\" [Best Novella winner, 2000] (Ted Chiang)\n*\"Mars Is No Place for Children\" [Best Novelette winner, 2000] (Mary A.

E. van Vogt, Marion Zimmer Bradley, James White, and Stanley Kubrick, no obituaries appear.\" The review also takes to task Author Emeritus Daniel Keyes's description of \"the genesis of his extraordinary and moving story 'Flowers for Algernon'; perusing this piece, readers will also understand why he never wrote anything else of real consequence.\" In summation, \"[t]he quality of the fiction's not in dispute, but it's hard to justify that sky-high price tag for a short volume consisting mostly of reprints.\"\nThe collection was also reviewed by Gary K. Wolfe in Locus #484, May 2001.\nNotes"
