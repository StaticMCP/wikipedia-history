      "text": "# Fujiwara no Yasuhira\n\nwas the fourth ruler of Northern Fujiwara in Mutsu Province, Japan, the second son of Hidehira.\nAt first protecting Yoshitsune, according to his father's will, he was finally forced by Minamoto no Yoritomo to attack Yoshitsune.  Yoshitsune, rather than surrender, killed his wife and children and committed suicide. In 1189 Yasuhira was defeated by Yoritomo's forces and subsequently killed in Nienosaku, Hinai District during the Battle of Ōshū.  This marked the end of the Northern Fujiwara.\nA casket purportedly containing the head of Fujiwara no Yasuhira is housed within the Konjiki-dō at Chūson-ji in Iwate Prefecture.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Fujiwara no yasuhira\n\n#REDIRECT Fujiwara no Yasuhira"
