In the beginning of June, Salah Reis embarked from Algiers and set out with a fleet of 40 vessels, galliots, galleys and brigantines.\nOn July 5, 1553, while at sea with his squadron, Salah Reis came across and defeated a Portuguese fleet at the bay of Velez. The entire flotilla and its caravels were captured and the Portuguese and Moroccans were taken captive and brought to Velez.\nThe booty was offered to the Saadi ruler as a token of friendship and neighbourliness and also to dissuade him from launching raids on Oran. Despite this offer a new border incident occurred, and Salah Reis spent his winter preparing an expedition against Morocco, after which he defeated the Saadi ruler in the Battle of Taza.\nReferences"
