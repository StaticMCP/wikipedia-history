Today, lesbian, gay and bisexual rights are considered to be advanced by international standards, while transgender, gender-nonconforming and non-binary people face some of the highest levels of discrimination of any modernised country.\nToday, lesbian, gay, and bisexual rights in the UK are among the most progressive globally. Same-sex marriage has been legal in England, Wales, and Scotland since 2014, and in Northern Ireland since 2020. Same-sex couples have full adoption rights across the UK, and anti-discrimination protections—covering employment, housing, education, and public services—have been enshrined in law through the Equality Act 2010.\nHowever, transgender, gender-nonconforming, and non-binary individuals continue to experience significant marginalisation. Studies have shown that over 60% of trans people report experiencing transphobia in the workplace, more than 40% face challenges accessing safe housing, and approximately 85% have encountered transphobic harassment in public spaces. Non-binary individuals face additional barriers, as UK law currently does not recognise non-binary gender on legal documents. Access to gender identity clinics remains limited, with long waiting times and reported difficulties for around 14% of those seeking care. Mental health disparities are also prominent, with around 47% of trans and non-binary people reporting long-term mental health conditions, significantly higher than among the general population.\nHistory\nRights\nDemographics\nAccording to the Office of National Statistics, the percentage of the UK population identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) increased from 1.5% in 2012 to 2.0% in 2017. There are 1.1 million people identifying as LGB in UK. The 16 to 24 age group were the most likely to identify as LGB in 2017 (4.2%).\nA 2010 Integrated Household Survey estimated 1.5% of people in the UK identify themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual – far lower than previous estimates of 5–7%. Interpreting the statistics, an Office for National Statistics (ONS) spokesperson said, \"Someone may engage in sexual behaviour with someone of the same sex but still not perceive themselves as gay.\" According to YouGov, however, studies such as that of the Integrated Household Survey underestimate the true proportion of the population that is LGBT as they use a face-to-face methodology, and non-heterosexual people are less willing to disclose their sexual orientation to an interviewer. YouGov itself estimates, based on its panel, which was inquired via an online questionnaire, that the proportion of LGBT people in the UK is 7%. Estimates of the size of the trans population in the UK is between 65,000 and 300,000. The size of the transgender population or people experiencing gender dysphoria was estimated at between 2,400 and 10,500. Stonewall concludes that it is hard to define the LGBT population of the UK because some LGBT people are not out.\nRepresentation\nCensus\nIn 2009, the Equality and Human Rights Commission called for the inclusion of a question on sexual orientation in the 2011 census, but this was rejected by the Office for National Statistics who run the census.\nIn the 2021 census questions on gender, gender identity and sexual orientation were included for the first time. Stonewall supported the move, stating \"gathering data on LGBT communities in the UK is a vital step towards building a society where LGBT people are truly accepted, everywhere and by everyone.\" These provisions were made in the Census (Return Particulars and Removal of Penalties) Act 2019 for England and Wales, and in the Census (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2019 for Scotland. The guidance to the question \"What is your sex?\" was subject to a High Court case, led by Fair Play For Women, which found that sex should only be declared per the sex recorded on either a birth certificate or Gender Recognition Certificate, rather than any other official document.\nMedia\nAs a national broadcaster, the BBC has been associated with LGBT+ people through its history. In 1938, the BBC broadcast \"female impersonator\" Douglas Byng, who was closeted at the time of broadcast. In 1957, following the release of the Wolfenden Report, BBC Radio broadcast a special programme titled \"The Homosexual Condition\" and the subject was discussed on Lifeline and Any Questions? television programmes. In 1965 the BBC postponed the broadcast of The Wednesday Play: Horror of Darkness due to the inclusion of a gay love triangle.\nFollowing the Sexual Offences Act 1967, BBC television representation increased. In 1970, the first ever gay kiss was shown on television, between Ian McKellen and James Laurenson in a performance of Edward II. The first lesbian kiss was shown later in 1974, between Alison Steadman and Myra Frances on the TV show Girl, part of Second City Firsts. In 1987, EastEnders showed the first same-sex kiss on a British soap. In 1995, the show Gaytime TV was broadcast on BBC Two, the first to be primarily targeted at queer audiences.\nMusic continued to be censored by the BBC throughout the 1970s and 80s. In 1978, Tom Robinson's Glad to be Gay was banned by BBC Radio 1. In 1984, Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Relax was similarly banned from daytime and chart shows.\n, First Minister at the Welsh Government with his annual message to mark the beginning of LGBT+ History Month 2021.]]\nIn 2005, the first LGBT History Month took place, with broadcast on the BBC generally sceptical. The BBC has continued to cover LGBT History Month.\nIn 2010, the BBC Trust produced a report calling for increased representation of LGBT minorities, including more \"incidental homosexuality\" in TV programming.\nIn March 2019, the first LGBT+ correspondent for BBC News, Ben Hunte was hired. In November 2020, it was announced that staff working in news and current affairs at the BBC were banned from attending UK pride marches, so as not to be seen as politically biased (even in a \"personal\" individual capacity). The BBC later clarified that whilst it was not a blanket ban, staff should seek permission before attending events.\nIn July 2020, the first same-sex kiss on the children's TV channel CBBC was aired, following a long-running romantic arc between two female characters on the Canadian teen drama series The Next Step.\nPolitics\nLGBT people have been serving openly in UK politics since the 1970s. In 1972, Sam Green, an openly gay man and member of the Gay Liberation Front, was elected as a member of Durham City Council for the Liberal Party. He has since been described as the first openly gay political candidate in the UK.\nThe first openly LGBT MP was Maureen Colquhoun (Labour Party, MP 1974–79), who was outed as a Lesbian in 1976. Colquhoun was a left-wing feminist and sought to combat gender inequality. Colquhoun was deselected due to her sexuality and her feminist views in 1977, but this decision was later overturned.\nChris Smith, an MP since 1983 and out since 1984, became the first openly gay secretary of state for culture, media and sport in 1997. Later that year, Angela Eagle came out: the first openly lesbian MP since Maureen Colquhoun.\n46 openly LGB MPs were elected at the 2019 General Election. This was one less than in 2017, an increase of five from the 2015 General Election. Of those 46 LGB MPs, 20 were Conservative, 15 Labour, 10 SNP and one independent. Of the main parties, the SNP had the highest proportion of LGB MPs (21%). No openly trans or non-binary MP's were elected in the 2019 general elections.\nNikki Sinclaire (UKIP, 2009 - 2014) was the first ever trans British parliamentarian as the MEP for West Midlands from 2009 to 2014.\nLayla Moran (Liberal Democrats, 2017–Present) became the first ever openly pansexual MP in 2017.\nIn 2021 Owen Hurcum, 23, became the world's first openly non-binary mayor after they were chosen by fellow councillors on Bangor City Council in Gwynedd, Wales. Owen identifies as queer and agender.\nOn 30 March 2022, Katie Wallis (Conservative Party, 2019–Present) came out as transgender, becoming the first openly transgender MP in the House of Commons.\nKatie Wallis, Conservative MP for Bridgend since 2019, was the first openly transgender MP. Nikki Sinclaire was the first ever trans British parliamentarian as the MEP for West Midlands from 2009 to 2014.\nCurrency\nIn March 2021, the Bank of England announced that the next £50 note would have Alan Turing displayed on the reverse; it entered circulation on 23 June 2021, reflecting Turing's birth date.\nBritains Royal Mint released a 50 pence coin to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Pride. It was designed by Dominique Holmes, an LGBTQ+ activist. One side features Queen Elizabeth II, and the other side showcases a rainbow design symbolising Pride. The rainbow includes \"pride\" in the centre and represents Pride in London's values: protest, visibility, unity, and equality.\nPublic opinion\nTowards homosexuality\n|pos=top|caption= BSA 30  NatCen |url=https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-30/personal-relationships/homosexuality.aspx |access-date=2022-11-16 |website=www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk |archive-date=30 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210330171128/https://bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-30/personal-relationships/homosexuality.aspx |url-status=dead }}}}}}In 1993, Stonewall conducted a survey of gay men and lesbians at work where they found two-thirds of respondents hid their sexuality at work and only 11% of respondents never hid their sexual orientation in the workplace. A follow-up survey done in 2008 found that 20% of gay and lesbian people had experienced bullying at work.\nAttitudes towards homosexuality amongst the British public have become more tolerant over time; according to the British Social Attitudes Survey, in 1983 approximately 50% to 70% of respondents of the three major political parties (Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat) regarded homosexuality as \"always wrong\" or \"mostly wrong\" and in 1993 opposition to homosexuality was reported to have slightly increased amongst all parties. However, by 2003 attitudes had become more tolerant, with 25% to 50% of respondents regarding homosexuality as always or mostly wrong and by 2013, only around 20% to 35% of respondents in each party felt the same way. Liberal Democrat respondents tended to be less likely to regard homosexuality as wrong than Labour or Conservative respondents across each survey. In 2015, a poll carried out by YouGov found that nearly twice as many residents in London believed homosexuality to be \"morally wrong\" compared to the rest of the UK (29% compared to 15 to 17%). Londoners were also over five times more likely to reject support for a gay child compared to the rest of the UK. A face-to-face survey conducted in 2015 by ICM Research for Channel 4 found that 18% of British Muslims agreed with the statement that homosexuality should be legal in Britain, while 52% disagreed, and 22% neither agreed or disagreed. This was an improvement from a Gallup poll conducted in 2009 which found that British Muslims had zero tolerance towards homosexuality.\nAn illustration of social attitudes towards homosexuality in the UK was provided in May 2007 in a survey by YouGov. The poll indicated that legislation outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation was supported by 90% of British citizens. It also showed positive public perceptions of gay people in particular, but recognised the extent to which prejudice still exists. A poll in June 2009 conducted by Populus for The Times reported that the majority of the public supported same-sex marriage; 61% of respondents agreed that \"Gay couples should have an equal right to get married, not just to have civil partnerships\". There were few differentials by partisanship.\nA more recent opinion poll, conducted in 2017 by Pew Research Center, found that 77% of the British public were in favour of same-sex marriage. Support had increased to 85% according to the 2019 Eurobarometer, which polled all members states of the European Union on the question. The EU average was 69%.\nTowards transgender people\nA June 2020 survey by YouGov found that British people tended to support people identifying as the gender of their choice, but did not support making the legal process easier. YouGov's analysis also remarked that British \"[p]eople tend to be fine with transgender people using facilities for their new gender, but not if they have not undergone gender reassignment surgery\". The survey found women and younger respondents to be more trans-friendly than men and older respondents.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2018–2022 YouGov Survey\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" |Dec 2018 (%)\n! colspan=\"3\" |June 2020 (%)\n! colspan=\"3\" |May 2022 (%)\n|-\n!Agree\n!Disagree\n!Not sure\n!Agree\n!Disagree\n!Not sure\n!Agree\n!Disagree\n!Not sure\n|-\n|\"A transgender man is a man\"\n|\n|32\n|25\n| 41 }}\n| 36\n|23\n| 39|date=September 2022}}\n| 39|date=September 2022}}\n|22\n|-\n|\"A transgender woman is a woman\"\n|\n|32\n|25\n| 40}}\n| 36\n|23\n| 38\n| 40}}\n|22\n|-\n|\"It should be made easier for transgender people to change their legal gender\"\n|28\n|\n|24\n| 28\n| 47}}\n|25\n| 26\n| 50'''}}\n|25\n|-\n|\"Transgender women should be allowed to participate in women's sport\"\n|27\n|\n|25\n| 20\n| 55}}\n|25\n| 16\n| 61}}\n|22\n|-\n|\"Transgender men should be allowed to participate in men's sport\"\n|37\n|\n|25\n| 31\n| 44}}\n|24\n| 29\n| 48}}\n|23\n|-\n|\"Transgender women should be able to use the women's toilet\"\n|\n|30\n|23\n| 46}}\n| 30\n|23\n| 38\n| 41}}\n|21\n|-\n|\"Transgender men should be allowed to use the men's toilet\"\n|\n|27\n|25\n| 49}}\n| 28\n|23\n| 42}}\n| 34\n|23\n|}\nLGBT experience\nIn 2017, 108,000 people participated in the National LGBT Survey, making it one of the biggest surveys of LGBT people in the world. LGBT people were found to be less satisfied with life compared to the wider UK population, with trans satisfaction notably lower. 68% of respondents said they avoided holding hands with their same-sex partner in public. 5% of respondents had been offered conversion therapy, with 2% undergoing such therapies. The findings from the National LGBT Survey have been used to inform a 75-point LGBT Action Plan to address the key issues identified, including bringing forward proposals to ban conversion therapy in the UK.\nReferences"
