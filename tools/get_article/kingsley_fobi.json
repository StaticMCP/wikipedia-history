He made his senior debut with Granada's B-team on 28 January 2017, coming on as a late substitute for Sergio Peña in a 3–0 Segunda División B home win against Mérida AD.\nWatford\nFobi had his federative rights assigned to Watford in 2017, being subsequently loaned to SD Formentera in the third division on 26 July of that year. Loans to UD Ibiza and CD Badajoz followed, but he featured sparingly for both sides before leaving Watford in 2020 without making a competitive appearance for the club.\nGranada return\nOn 19 August 2020, Fobi returned to Granada and their B-side, after agreeing to a two-year contract. He made his first team – and La Liga – debut on 8 November, replacing Kenedy at half-time in a 2–0 away loss against Real Sociedad, as his side was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInternational career\nFobi represented Ghana at under-20 and under-23 levels, playing for the former in the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
