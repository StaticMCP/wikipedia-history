The breeding pair builds a bulky domed nest with a side entrance on a sloping bank or in a gully, and the female lays two white eggs.\nThe black-cheeked warbler is 13–13.5&nbsp;cm long and weighs 13&nbsp;g.  It has a rufous crown, long white supercilia and black cheeks. The upperparts are dull olive, the breast is olive-grey, and the belly is yellow-white. The sexes are similar, but the young bird is browner on the upperparts, has a dull supercilium, a greyer breast, and shows two cinnamon wingbars.\nDespite this species' restricted range, it has three subspecies.\n* B. m. melanogenys, the nominate race described above, breeds in central and southern Costa Rica.\n* B. m. eximius is highly localised in a small area of western Panama, and is slightly whiter on the belly than melanogenys.\n* B. m. bensoni is highly localised in a small area of west-central Panama, and is whiter below than eximius, and a purer grey above.\nThe black-cheeked warbler primarily feeds on insects, spiders and other small invertebrates, taken low in the undergrowth.\nThe call note of the black-cheeked warbler is a hard tsit, and the male's song is a lisping spluttered tsi tsi wee tsi tsi wu tsi wee.\nReferences\n* Curson, Quinn and Beadle,New World Warblers\n* Stiles and Skutch,  A guide to the birds of Costa Rica"
