In 46 BC, Tubero unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute one of Caesar's opponents, Quintus Ligarius, whose defence was undertaken by Cicero. This prompted him to abandon his public career, and he went on to study law under Aulus Ofilius.\nTubero authored several works on law, as well as an annalistic history of Rome in at least 14 books, covering the period from the city's foundation to his own day. He is known to have used the libri lintei (linen books or rolls) as a source, and the historian Livy cites him as a reference.\nFamily\nTubero married a daughter of the jurist Servius Sulpicius Rufus, and was father to Quintus Aelius Tubero and Sextus Aelius Catus, consuls in 11 BC and AD 4 respectively. He also had a daughter whose son was the jurist Gaius Cassius Longinus, consul in AD 30.\nReferences\nSources\n* Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \"Tubero, Aelius\"\n*  }}\n* Oxford Classical Dictionary, \"[https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.013.107 Aelius Tubero, Quintus]\""
