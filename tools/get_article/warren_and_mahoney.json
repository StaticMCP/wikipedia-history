It is a highly awarded architectural practice, with offices in New Zealand and Australia.\nHistory\nThe practice was founded by Miles Warren in 1955, and with the award of the Dental Nurses Training School (now known as Central Nurses' Training School) Miles sought the assistance of his fellow atelier colleague Maurice Mahoney.  In 1958, the partnership of Warren and Mahoney was established.\nThe partnership created a distinctive form of architecture utilising a modern, brutalist style (described by Warren himself as \"constructivist\") involving widespread use of concrete and harsh geometric shapes, that became known as Christchurch School. Several of their buildings in this style are now among the highlights of New Zealand modernism: Christchurch Town Hall, Harewood Crematorium, College House and Canterbury Students' Union being but a few. The style was influential within New Zealand, being a partial inspiration for Ted McCoy's Archway Lecture Theatre complex at the University of Otago, among other works.\nWarren and Mahoney's designs are found in other centres throughout New Zealand, most notably those of Wellington's Michael Fowler Centre and Bowen House in Wellington and Auckland's Television New Zealand building.\nMiles Warren was knighted in 1985 for his services to architecture and in 2003 named one of ten inaugural ‘Icons of the Arts’ by the Arts Foundation of New Zealand. Sir Miles Warren and Maurice Mahoney retired in the early 1990s.\nNow a third generation multi-disciplinary practice with offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, Tauranga, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown, the practice has constructed projects around the Pacific Rim. Several works were destroyed and more still damaged by the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.\nThere was a film made about the practice called Maurice and I made by Christchurch filmmakers Rick Harvie and Jane Mahoney.\nNotable designs\nBuildings\nWarren and Mahoney: Harewood Crematorium (1963)\n* Harewood Crematorium (1963)\n* Ballantynes department store in Christchurch, New Zealand (1964)\n* College House (University of Canterbury) in Christchurch, New Zealand (1966)\n* Christchurch Town Hall in Christchurch, New Zealand (1972)\n* Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament (1974–5)\n* Embassy of New Zealand, Washington, D.C.
