Countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations typically exchange high commissioners, rather than ambassadors. Though there are a few technical differences (for instance, whereas ambassadors present their diplomatic credentials to the host country's head of state, high commissioners are accredited to the head of government), they are in practice one and the same office. The Sri Lankan high commissioner to the United Kingdom is concurrently accredited as the ambassador to Ireland. The current post of high commissioner is occupied by Nimal Senadheera.\nList of high commissioners\nRepresentatives of the Government of Ceylon\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Representative!!Start of term!!End of term\n|-\n|Claude Corea||1946||1948\n|}\nHigh commissioners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!High Commissioner!!Start of term!!End of term\n|-\n|Claude Corea||1948||1949\n|-\n|Sir Oliver Goonetilleke ||1949 || 1952\n|-\n|Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne ||1952 || 1954\n|-\n|Sir Claude Corea || February 1954 || December 1957\n|-\n|Gunasena de Soyza ||December 1957 || October 1958\n|-\n|P.
