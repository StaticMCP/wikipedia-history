      "text": "# Medieval Serbian nobility\n\nIn the medieval Serbian states, the privileged class consisted of nobility and clergy, distinguished from commoners, part of the feudal society. The Serbian nobility (srpska vlastela, srpsko vlastelinstvo or srpsko plemstvo) were roughly grouped into magnates (velikaši or velmože), the upper stratum, and the lesser nobility (vlasteličići). Serbia followed the government model established by the Byzantine Empire.\nThe nobility possessed hereditary allodial estates, which were worked by dependent sebri, the equivalent of Byzantine paroikoi; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree. The nobility was obliged to serve the monarch in war.\nHierarchy\nThe nobility (vlastela, vlastelinstvo or plemstvo) of Serbia in the Middle Ages is roughly divided into magnates (velikaši or velmože), nobility and petty noblemen (vlasteličići). Sometimes, the division is made between vlastela (including \"great\" and \"small\" ones) and vlasteličići, the petty nobility. The lower-half social class, commoners, were the sebri (себри).\n*The velikaši (великаши) were the highest nobility class of Serbia.\n*The vlasteličići (властеличићи) were the lower nobility class of Serbia. It was a relatively numerous class of the small, warrior nobility, originating from the vojnici (warriors) from sources from the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century. They held villages, with full rights, and in socioeconomic and legal terms stood below the vlastela. They had military obligations, such as the vlasteličić joining the army individually or with a group of his men (soldiers), dependent on his wealth.\nTitles\nHistory\nEarly Medieval Serbian principalities\nThe Serbs at that time were organized into župe (sing. župa), a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local župan (a magistrate or governor); the governorship was hereditary, and the župan reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war.\nAccording to Fine Jr.: Bosnia, Zahumlje and Rascia were never incorporated into an integrated state with Duklja (1043–1101); each principality had its own nobility and institutions, simply requiring a member of the royal family to rule as Prince or Duke. After Constantine Bodin died, the principalities seceded from Duklja, and Vukan became the most powerful Serb ruler, as Grand Prince. Subordinate to the ruler were local counts who seem to have been more or less autonomous in the internal affairs of their counties, but who swore loyalty and were obliged to support in war. It seems that the counts were hereditary holders of their counties, holding their land before Duklja annexed Rascia.\nSerbian Kingdom\n.]]\nThe hierarchy of the Serbian court titles was the following: stavilac, čelnik, kaznac, tepčija and vojvoda, the supreme title.\nIn the Dečani chrysobulls, King Stefan Dečanski (r. 1321–1331) mentioned that the court dignitaries present at the Dečani assembly were the kaznac, tepčija, vojvoda, sluga and stavilac.\nSerbian Empire\nOn April 16, 1346 (Easter), Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia convoked a huge assembly at Skopje, attended by the Serbian Archbishop Joanikije II, the Archbishop of Ochrid Nikolaj I, the Bulgarian Patriarch Simeon and various religious leaders of Mount Athos. The assembly and clerics agreed on, and then ceremonially performed the raising of the autocephalous Serbian Archbishopric to the status of Serbian Patriarchate. The Archbishop from now on is titled Serbian Patriarch, although some documents called him Patriarch of Serbs and Greeks, with the seat at the Patriarchal Monastery of Peć. The first Serbian Patriarch Joanikije II now solemnly crowned Dušan as \"Emperor and autocrat of Serbs and Romans\" (Greek ). Dušan had his son crowned King of Serbs and Greeks, giving him nominal rule over the Serbian lands, and although Dušan was governing the whole state, he had special responsibility for the \"Roman\", i.e. Greek lands.\nA further increase in the Byzantinization of the Serbian court followed, particularly in court ceremonial and titles. As Emperor, Dušan could grant titles only possible as an Emperor. In the years that followed, Dušan's half-brother Symeon Uroš and brother-in-law Jovan Asen became despotes. Jovan Oliver already had the despot title, granted to him by Andronikos III. His brother-in-law Dejan Dragaš and Branko is granted the title of sebastocrator. The military commanders (voivodes) Preljub and Vojihna receive the title of caesar. The raising of the Serbian Patriarch resulted in the same spirit, bishoprics became metropolitans, as for example the Metropolitanate of Skopje.\nFall of the Serbian Empire\nEmperor Uroš V died childless in December 2/4 1371, after much of the Serbian nobility had been destroyed in Maritsa earlier that year. This marked an end to the once powerful Empire.  Vukašin's son Marko, who had earlier been crowned Young King was to inherit his father's royal title, and thus became one in the line of successors to the Serbian throne. Meanwhile, the nobles pursued their own interests, sometimes quarreling with each other.  Serbia, without an Emperor \"became a conglomerate of aristocratic territories\", and the Empire was thus divided between the provincial lords: Marko, the Dejanović brothers, Đurađ I Balšić, Vuk Branković, Nikola Altomanović, Lazar Hrebeljanović and other lesser ones.\nList of nobility\nEarly medieval Serbian principalities (9th century–1100)\n*Beloje, Lord of Trebinje (before 847)\n*Krajina Belojević, Duke of Travunia (after 847)\n*Hvalimir Belojević, Duke of Travunia (late 9th century)\n*Čučimir Belojević, Duke of Travunia (first half of 10th century)\n*Draško, Duke of Narentines (fl. 836–839)\n*Ljudislav, Duke of Narentines (ca. 840)\n*Uneslaf and Diodur, Duke of Narentines (after 840)\n*Peter, archon  of Diokleia (10th- or 11th century)\n*John, protospatharios and katepano of Ras (fl. 971–976)\n*Ljutovid, protospatharios epi tou Chrysotriklinou, hypatos, strategos of Serbia and Zahumlje (fl. 1039–1042)\n*Domanek, Duke of Travunia (fl. 1054–1055)\n*Petrilo (fl. 1072), vojvoda\n*Stefan, Duke of Bosnia (fl. 1081–1101)\nSerbian Grand Principality (1100–1217)\n*Grdeša (fl. 1154–56), župan of Trebinje\n*Vučina (fl. 1150–51), župan\n*Radomir (fl. 1170), župan in Trebinje\n*Slavogast (fl. 1154–56), ban of Hum\n*Hramko, Lord of provinces in Hum (ca 1177–1200)\n*Svergius (?), župan\n*Đura (fl. 1186), satnik (stotnik), Stefan Nemanja's delegate in the city of Kotor\nSerbian Kingdom (1217–1345)\n*Obrad ( 1230s), veliki tepčija, served Stefan Vladislav\n*Manojlo (fl. 1237), vojvoda (duke), served king Vladislav, mentioned in king's charter to noblemen of Split\n*Pribilša, župan, son of Grdeša, \"died in the time of Stefan Vladislav\".\n*Bogdan Radojević (fl. 1278), kaznac.\n*several (small) nobles from charter of prince Andrija of Hum in 1240. - Hrelko Rastomirić, Dobrovit Radovčić, Hrelja Stepković, Odumisl i Strezimir Adamović, Čepren Osilić, Hranislav Prvoslavić, Bigren Mrđić, Dobromisl Pobratović, Desin Berivojević, Radovan Pribidružić, Hrelja Desavčić, Pribin Zlošević, Toma Čupetić, Galic Vuksanić, Hrelja Hranidružić, Predislav Vukmirić, Vojmir Vlastinić, Bogdan Dobromirić, Hrvatin Turbić, Prvoslav Prodančić, Bratoslav Vuković, Berko Radovančić\n*Vlado, kaznac, served between 1274 and 1279\n*Prvoslav Radojević (fl. 1280), kaznac, served Helen of Anjou.\n*Mrnjan (fl. 1288), kaznac, served Helen of Anjou at the court at Trebinje\n*Miroslav, kaznac, served Stefan Milutin\n*Kuzma (fl. 1306), tepčija, served Stefan Milutin.\n*Branko, čelnik, served Stefan Milutin.\n*Vladislav Jonima (fl. 1303–19), župan (fl. 1306), served Stefan Milutin in northern Albania (fl. 1303–06).\n*Dražen Bogopenec (fl. 1306–07), župan, served Stefan Milutin in eastern Hum.\n*Hardomil, tepčija (1306–1321), served Stefan Milutin.\n*Novak Grebostrek (fl. 1312), veliki vojvoda. fought at Gallipoli\n*Jovan Dragoslav (fl. 1290–1315), kaznac (fl. 1300), veliki kaznac (fl. 1315), serving Stefan Milutin.
