It is conferred every year on July 20, the birthday of the poet Herman Wildenvey, in an event held at Hergisheim. The award consists of NOK 15,000 and a bronze relief plaque designed by the sculptor Ørnulf Bast.\nThe award is given to a person or institution that has helped foster interest in Herman Wildenvey's poetry and stimulated efforts for his poetic values to hold a greater place in everyday life.\nThe award was conferred for the first time in 1996 by the Wildenvey Society ().
