It was the brainchild of Keith Critchlow, the Professor Emeritus at the School, who is also the author of several books on sacred geometry.\nThe Programme transferred to The Prince of Wales' Institute of Architecture in 1993 which subsequently became incorporated into The Prince's Foundation in 2000. The School was initiated as a separate charity of Charles in April 2004.\nIn 2018, the School became a part of the Prince's Foundation, merging with The Prince's Foundation for Building Community, The Prince's Regeneration Trust, The Great Steward of Scotland's Dumfries House Trust.\nIn 2018, works created by graduates of the School and two other charities founded by King Charles were put on display during the Prince & Patron exhibition to mark his 70th birthday.\nPostgraduate degrees\nThree postgraduate degrees are offered by the school: a Master of Arts (MA), a Master of Philosophy degree (MPhil) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in arts practice research in the traditional arts. All degrees are awarded by University of Wales Trinity Saint David.\nSee also\n* Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom\n* Islamic geometric patterns\n* Multiculturalism in the United Kingdom\n* The Royal Drawing School\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://schooloftraditionalarts.org/ School of Traditional Arts]"
