McCarthy captured nineteen delegates by narrowly winning several of the state's suburban congressional districts, including nine out of ten delegates from Bergen County. The uncommitted delegates were expected to determine internally whether to support Hubert Humphrey or Robert F. Kennedy. However, Kennedy was assassinated on the night of the primary, leading the New Jersey delegation to support Humphrey at the convention.\nIn the preference primary held at the same time, McCarthy won with 36.1 percent of the vote. However, no candidate appeared on the ballot and far fewer voters participated in the write-in preference primary, which had no binding effect on the delegates.\nBackground\nPrimary campaign\nAfter Lyndon B. Johnson announced on March 31 that he would not seek or accept the Democratic nomination for president, Democratic leaders in New Jersey formed an uncommitted \"Regular Democratic Organization\" slate. Ahead of the April 25 filing deadline, only Minnesota senator Eugene McCarthy fielded an opposing slate of delegates; his chief competitors, Hubert Humphrey and Robert F. Kennedy, chose not to enter the New Jersey primary and instead focus on swaying the party leaders and uncommitted delegates once elected.\nProcedure\nFive delegates were elected at-large with five more elected from each of the state's congressional districts. Delegates were elected individually, rather than as a slate, with each voter selecting up to five choices in each race. They were permitted to run as pledged or unpledged delegates. Typically, the state and county party organizations attempted to elect unpledged slates. In addition, New Jersey's two Democratic National Committee members were entitled to a delegate seat ex officio.\nIn addition to the delegate election, a nonbinding preference poll was held, as had been in every presidential year since 1912, with the exceptions of 1948, 1960 and 1964. The preference primary was often disregarded by convention delegates.\nThe filing deadline was April 25. In 1965, the legislature rescheduled the primary date from the third Tuesday in April to the first Tuesday in June.\nCandidates\n* Jesse Gray, New York City tenants' advocate\n* Hubert Humphrey, Vice President of the United States and former U.S. senator from Minnesota\n* Robert F.
