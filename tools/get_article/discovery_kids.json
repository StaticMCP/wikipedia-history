Starting as a television block within Discovery Channel, the brand expanded as a separate television channel in October 1996. In 2002, the channel began airing a Saturday morning children's programming block on NBC, which ran from October 5, 2002, to September 2, 2006.\nMost of Discovery Kids' worldwide channels, as well as its website for children's activities and consumer products, have been either rebranded or shut down. Following the Warner Bros. Discovery merger in 2022, the brand was replaced by the standard Discovery brand for activities and consumer products. As of 2025, Discovery Kids-branded channels continue to broadcast in both India and Latin America. An unbranded morning programming block based on the Latin American channel (formerly branded as Discovery Kids) also airs in the United States on Discovery Familia.\nChannels\nCurrent channels\n* Discovery Kids Latin America (launched in 1996; divided into five feeds plus one subfeed)\n** Pan-regional feed (broadcast to most Latin American countries, including the Caribbean)\n** Mexican feed\n** Colombian feed\n** Southern feed (broadcast to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay)\n*** Chilean subfeed (available in Chile with local advertisement)\n** Brazilian feed (dubbed in Portuguese)\n* Discovery Kids India (launched in 2012)\nFormer channels\n* Discovery Kids on NBC, programming block on NBC (2002-2006)\n* Discovery Kids Australia (2014-2020)\n* DKids, broadcast in Middle East and North Africa (2016-2020)\n* Discovery Kids UK, time-shared with Discovery Wings (both operated from 2000 to 2007)\n* Discovery Kids Canada (2001-2009)\n* Discovery Kids Asia (2012-2016)\nRebranded channels\n* Discovery Kids US (1996–2010) – In 2009, the channel became a 50/50 joint venture between Discovery and Hasbro Entertainment and was relaunched as Hub Network in 2010.
