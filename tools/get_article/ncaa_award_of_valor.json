Valor is described as \"the strength of mind or spirit that enables a person to brave danger with boldness and firmness.\" Members of the armed forces and police forces may receive the award for duty-connected actions if their actions were \"clearly above and beyond the call of duty.\"\nThe Award of Valor is presented during an award celebration at the NCAA's annual convention.
