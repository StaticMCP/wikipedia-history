The most famous butte formations are located in northeastern Arizona along the Utah–Arizona state line. The valley is considered sacred by the Navajo Nation, the Native American people within whose reservation it lies.\nMonument Valley has been featured in many forms of media since the 1930s. Famed director John Ford used the location for a number of his Westerns. Film critic Keith Phipps wrote that \"its  have defined what decades of moviegoers think of when they imagine the American West\".\nGeography and geology\nMonument Valley is part of the Colorado Plateau. The elevation of the valley floor ranges from  above sea level. The floor is largely siltstone of the Cutler Group, or sand derived from it, deposited by the meandering rivers that carved the valley. The valley's vivid red coloration comes from iron oxide exposed in the weathered siltstone. The darker, blue-gray rocks in the valley get their color from manganese oxide.\nThe buttes arising from the valley floor are clearly stratified, with three principal layers. The lowest layer is the Organ Rock Shale, the middle is de Chelly Sandstone, and the top layer is the Moenkopi Formation capped by Shinarump Conglomerate. Major rock formations include West and East Mitten Buttes, Merrick Butte, Hunts Mesa, Eagle Mesa, Sentinel Mesa, Brighams Tomb, Castle Rock, Stagecoach, Big Indian, Rain God Mesa, Spearhead Mesa, Mitchell Mesa, Mitchell Butte, Gray Whiskers, Elephant Butte, Camel Butte, Cly Butte, King-on-his-Throne, Rooster Rock, and Setting Hen. Another notable formation is Totem Pole, a highly eroded butte remanent. The valley also includes large stone structures, such as the \"Eye of the Sun\".\nBetween 1945 and 1967, the southern extent of the Monument Upwarp was mined for uranium, which occurs in scattered areas of the Shinarump Conglomerate; vanadium and copper are associated with uranium in some deposits.\nTourism\nMonument Valley includes much of the area surrounding Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, a Navajo Nation equivalent to a national park. Oljato, for example, is also within the area designated as Monument Valley.\nVisitors may pay an access fee and drive through the park on a  dirt road. Parts of Monument Valley, such as Mystery Valley and Hunts Mesa, are accessible only by guided tour.\nClimate\nMonument Valley experiences a desert climate with cold winters and hot summers. While the summers may be hot, the heat is tempered by the region's high altitude. Although the valley experiences an average of 54 days above  annually, summer highs rarely exceed . Summer nights are comfortably cool, and temperatures drop quickly after sunset. Winters are cold, but daytime highs are usually above freezing. Even in the winter, temperatures below  are uncommon, although possible. Monument Valley receives an occasional light snowfall in the winter, but it usually melts within a day or two.\n|date=March 2013\n}}\nIn visual media\nMonument Valley from the valley floor\nMonument Valley has been featured in numerous computer games, in print, and in motion pictures, including multiple Westerns directed by John Ford that influenced audiences' view of the American West, such as: Stagecoach (1939), My Darling Clementine (1946), Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), and The Searchers (1956).\nMany more recent movies, with other directors, were also filmed in Monument Valley, including Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), the first Spaghetti Western to be filmed (in 1967) outside Europe, and Gore Verbinski's The Lone Ranger (2013).\nGallery\nMonument Valley (14).jpg|Monument Valley, the Thumb\nMittens and Merrick after Sunset.jpg|West, East Mittens and Merrick Butte after sunset\nSnow covered Monument Valley sunrise in January.jpg| Snow-covered Monument Valley sunrise in January\nMonument Valley, 6AM.jpg|Monument Valley West and East Butte at 6:00 am\nSandstorm in Monument Valley, Arizona - Utah, USA.jpg|Sandstorm in Monument Valley\nMonument Valley, Utah, USA - 23638754781.jpg|Vegetation of Monument Valley\nMonument Valley, Utah, USA - 23426578800.jpg|Monument Valley landscape\nGolden_Monument_Valley (cropped).jpg|View on the Monument Valley from Hunts mesa\nMonument Valley rock formation.jpg|Monument Valley rock formation\nMystery Valley, Monument Valley, 2005 (1).jpg|Mystery Valley\nPanorama\nSee also\n* List of sandstones\n* Valley of the Gods\n* Uluru\n* Goulding's Lodge\n* Tepui\n* List of rock formations in Monument Valley\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
