The song was released as the second and final single from the band's 1996 album Wither Blister Burn & Peel.\nBackground\nIn a 2020 interview with Songfacts, lead singer Christopher Hall said:\n}}\nReception\nIn a retrospective overview of the band, Kyle Anderson of MTV said the song \"remains a pretty solid anthem.\" Anderson also praised the video, saying it \"is more clever than it has any right to be.\"\nMusic video\nThe video begins with a woman (Julie) running around and dancing in her living room. Her phone rings and the caller is her ex-boyfriend (Nick), who just escaped from a mental institution. Going to Julie's, Nick runs into a cop who he promptly kills. As Julie tries to run away and take the elevator, the officer's body falls on her before she continues running. Nick chases her to the building's roof, where he jumps at her and misses, falling to his death. The video is inter-cut with shots of the band performing the song in a room, leaving one by one before Hall is the only one left. The other members leave to see the movie, which is the Nick and Julie story.\nActors\n* Christopher Hall as himself\n* Walter Flakus as himself\n* Andy Kubiszewski as himself\n* Mark Eliopulos as himself\n* Jim Sellers as himself\n* Clint Curtis as Nick\nTrack listing\n;US single\n;Australian single\n;Austrian single\n;12\" single\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot 100 Airplay\n|align=\"center\"|69\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|US Modern Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|align=\"center\"|14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Mainstream Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|}\nPersonnel\n* Christopher Hall &ndash; vocals, guitar\n* Mark Eliopulos &ndash; guitar\n* Jim Sellers &ndash; bass\n* Walter Flakus &ndash; keyboards, programming\n* Andy Kubiszewski &ndash; drums\nReferences"
