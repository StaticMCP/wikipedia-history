He, with his partner William Olive, bought the Turn Lee Mill from Thomas Hamer Ibbotson. He bought it to try out a modern method of paper manufacture using the sulfite process.  He expanded rapidly with mills in Salford and Barrow in Furness. He merged with Kellner of Vienna and was created Lord Doverdale in 1914. His factories in Charlestown created nearly a 1000 jobs. He employed a thousand workers in his Charlestown Mill, 1 in 12 of the working population. He was a Unitarian and a Liberal. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of Derbyshire. He was made a Baron in the 1916 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours, being created Baron Doverdale, of Westwood Park in the County of Worcester on 6 January 1917.\nHe died suddenly a few hours after visiting his mills one afternoon in 1925.\nReferences"
