President\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Pro-Rouhani\n||Hope||≈103\n|rowspan=\"2\"|≈193\n||Mohammad Reza Aref\n|-\n|||Unknown||Kazem Jalali\n|-\n!Opposition\n||Wilayi Deputies\n|colspan=\"2\"|\n|}\nThe reformist Hope fraction is the largest bloc by number, however it is unable to form a partnership with a great number of newcomers and independents who owe little allegiance to any particular faction. Instead, the conservative allies of Hassan Rouhani led by Ali Larijani have effectively mobilized them. It was clearly illustrated when Mohammad Reza Aref declined to stand for the speaker and Larijani was re-elected uncontested with 237 out of 276 votes.\nMembers\nReferences"
