Waring was a left-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium. He was born at Chesterfield, Derbyshire.\nWaring made his debut for Sussex in a List A match against Surrey in the 1985 John Player Special League at the County Ground, Hove. He made a further appearance in that season's competition against Nottinghamshire at Cricket Field Road, Horsham. It was in that same season that he made his first-class debut against Glamorgan at Sophia Gardens in the 1985 County Championship. Waring only featured in one first team match for Sussex in 1986, a first-class fixture against Cambridge University at Hove. The following season, he made two first-class appearances in the 1987 County Championship against Derbyshire and Worcestershire. In what was to be his final season with Sussex, Waring featured more regularly in List A cricket, making ten appearances in 1987, the last of which came against Kent in the Refuge Assurance League. Waring's role in the Sussex team was as a bowler. In twelve List A matches for the county, he took 10 wickets at an average of 39.30, with best figures of 3/26.
