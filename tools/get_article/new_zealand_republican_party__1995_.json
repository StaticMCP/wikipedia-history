It existed from 1995 to 2002. The party's policies included adopting a republican form of government, with an elected president and a restored upper house. The party was not supported by the Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand.\nFounding\nThe party was registered as an incorporated society on 24 January 1995 as \"The Confederation of United Tribes of New Zealand Incorporated\" but changed its name on 8 February 1995 to the New Zealand Republican Party. It was led by William Powell.\nThe party registered with the Electoral Commission on 20 May 1995.\n1996 election\nAlthough the party was registered in time for the 1996 election, it was late in submitting its party list. The party challenged its exclusion as a result of failing to submit a list at the High Court of New Zealand, and attempted to have the 1996 elections postponed to allow this. Their application for an injunction was rejected however.\n1999 election\nIn the 1999 election, the party submitted a list, but won only 0.01% (292 votes in total) of the vote, the lowest of all registered parties. The party was officially de-registered on 24 June 2002, just before the 2002 election.\nSee also\n* Republicanism in New Zealand\nReferences"
