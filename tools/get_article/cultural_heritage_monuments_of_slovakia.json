Article 2 defines monuments and historic sites as those movable and immovable cultural properties that have been declared as national Cultural Heritage Monuments (Slovak: Národná kultúrna pamiatka (NKP)). Cultural Heritage Monuments are declared by the Ministry of Culture after proposal by the Monuments Board (Article 15). A central register is kept by the Monuments Board, comprising a register of (1) movable cultural heritage monuments; (2) immovable cultural heritage monuments (Register nehnuteľných NKP); (3) protected historic reserves (Register Pamiatkových rezervácií); (4) protected historic zones (Register Pamiatkových zón) (Article 22).
