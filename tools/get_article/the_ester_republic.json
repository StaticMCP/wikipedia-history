      "text": "# The Ester Republic\n\nThe Ester Republic is a small, independent monthly newspaper published in Ester, Alaska, and established January 1999. The paper serves as an alternative media publication for the Tanana Valley. It is the only newspaper that has been published in Ester; the village has been served historically by Fairbanks newspapers. Contributors are generally amateur writers, although some professional journalists, poets, and photographers appear in its pages (e.g., Richard A. Fineberg, John Haines, Dahr Jamail). The periodical encourages submissions of editorial cartoons by Alaskan artists, and has two \"staff\" cartoonists, Jamie Smith and Daniel Darrow. The paper has been operated out of the home of the publisher for much of its history; for a time its office space was the historic Ester post office, a 14'x16' structure built in 1971.\nThe paper was the recipient of at least one award from the Alaska Press Club each year from 2002 to 2008.\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://esterrepublic.blogspot.com The publisher's blog]"
