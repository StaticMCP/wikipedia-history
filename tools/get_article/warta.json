Its drainage basin covers . The Warta is navigable from Kostrzyn nad Odrą to Konin - approximately half of its length.\nThe Warta connects to the Vistula via its own tributary, the Noteć, and the Bydgoszcz Canal () near the city of Bydgoszcz.\nCourse\nThe Warta rises in the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland at Kromołów in Zawiercie, Silesian Voivodeship, flows through Łódź Land, Greater Poland and Lubusz Land, where it empties into the Oder near Kostrzyn at the border with Germany.\nThe Greater Warta Basin defines the site of early Poland; it is said that the tribe of Western Polans () settled the Warta Basin between the 6th and 8th centuries.
