The -story wood-frame house was built c. 1850–54, and is the oldest surviving house on Warren Street, once an important thoroughfare between Waltham and Belmont.  The house has classic Italianate styling, with a symmetrical three-bay facade, wide cornerboards and entablature, and round-arched gable windows.  It was built by Warren White, a wheelwright, on land owned by David White, a farmer, who sold Warren White the property in 1855.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Waltham, Massachusetts\nReferences"
