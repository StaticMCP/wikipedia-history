Its capital was first Pyatigorsk, and later Vladikavkaz. After July 1918, it was part of the North Caucasian Soviet Republic.\nIn contrast to other Soviet republics, the Republic was a coalition government.\nThe economist Jacob Marschak served as Secretary of Labour, despite being only a 19-year-old student.\nAfter internal struggles, it was conquered by the Volunteer Army led by Anton Denikin in early 1919.\nReferences"
