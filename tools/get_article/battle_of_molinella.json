The army was led by Federico da Montefeltro.\nBattle\nThe battle was fought along the Idice river, between the villages of Riccardina (near Budrio) and Molinella.\nHistorians disagree on who won the battle. The only certainty is that Bartolomeo Colleoni had to abandon his plans to conquer Milan. There were between 600 and 700 casualties. Notable was the large number of horses killed (almost 1,000). Artillery and firearms were intensively used for the first time in Italy in this battle.\nA large fresco in the Castle of Malpaga, probably by Girolamo Romani, depicts the battle.\nIn 1468 peace was concluded under the initiative of Pope Paul II.\nReferences"
