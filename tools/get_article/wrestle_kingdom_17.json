After the match, Tam Nakano challenged Kairi for the title at Wrestle Kingdom.\nAfter Taiji Ishimori lost a non-title match to Master Wato at Declaration of Power, he was confronted by Hiromu Takahashi and previous champion El Desperado, who both wanted a shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship after accusing Ishimori of not being a fighting champion. Ishimori, who wanted to establish himself as the \"big one\" in the junior heavyweight division, decided to defend his title against both competitors and Wato at Wrestle Kingdom in a four-way match.\nOn December 22, 2022, NJPW revealed a championship belt to represent the KOPW Championship, replacing the trophy which had been destroyed and vandalized many times since its inception.
