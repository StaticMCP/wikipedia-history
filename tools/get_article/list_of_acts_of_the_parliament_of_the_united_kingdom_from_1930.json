For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n20 & 21 Geo. 5\nContinuing the first session of the 35th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 25 June 1929 until 1 August 1930.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 20 & 21 G. 5.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  to persons under the age of eighteen years.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| known in Canada as the Constitution Act, 1930|public|26|10-07-1930|archived=n|An Act to confirm and give effect to certain agreements entered into between the Government of the Dominion of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan respectively.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  to industries involving exposure to asbestos dust, and to amend the provisions of that section relating to medical arrangements and examinations.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  for the constitution and functions of a Coal Mines National Industrial Board; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n| or the Greenwood Act|public|39|01-08-1930|maintained=y|An Act to make further and better provision with respect to the clearance or improvement of unhealthy areas, the repair or demolition of insanitary houses and the housing of persons of the working classes; to amend the Housing Act, 1925, the Housing, &c., Act, 1923, the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, and the other enactments relating to housing subsidies; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.}}\n|  the Housing, &c., Act, 1923, the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, and other enactments relating to housing subsidies; and for purposes, connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  to amend the law with respect to the powers of local authorities to provide public service vehicles, and for other purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\nand the Gas and Water Works Facilities Act 1870 Amendment Act 1873 for empowering the Sheppey Water and Lighting Company Limited to construct and maintain waterworks and to supply water in parts of the Rural District of Sheppey in the County of Kent.}}\n-\n|\n|\n| |po1=Fylde Water Board Order 1929|po1year=y|Provisional Order amending a local Act. }}\n| |po1=Bradford (Extension) Order 1929|po1year=y|Provisional Order made in pursuance of the Local Government Act 1888 for the extension of a County Borough.}}\n|  relating to Rothesay Tramways and Omnibuses.|po1=Rothesay Tramways and Omnibuses Order 1930|Provisional Order to make provision as to the temporary discontinuance and permanent abandonment of the tramways of the Rothesay Tramways Company Limited to authorise the Company to run omnibuses in substitution for tramcars and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|  relating to Dundee Corporation (General Powers).|note4=|po1=Dundee Corporation (General Powers) Order 1930|Provisional Order to confer powers on the Dundee Corporation as to Belmont Castle and Estate to make certain provisions in respect of the municipal administration and the water undertaking of the city and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Edinburgh Corporation.|note4=|po1=Edinburgh Corporation Order 1930|Provisional Order to authorise the Corporation of the City and royal burgh of Edinburgh to acquire lands to amend the superannuation scheme of the Corporation to amend the Edinburgh.
