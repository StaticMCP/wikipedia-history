It is the fourth series of the RDF Media programme, Shipwrecked, and featured a radically different format from the first three series, in that contestants were divided into tribes, with competitions, voting and a cash prize at stake.\nTribes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#1560BD\" align=\"center\"|Sharks\n| bgcolor=\"#000000\"|\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#FF6600\" align=\"center\"| Tigers\n|-\n!

The Shark Tribe ask for Katie who is a founding member of the Tigers and is heavily inclined towards them. When the Tigers ask for Anna the Sharks are wary of their strategy and eagerly await the return of their tribe member.\nAfter a night of enjoyment on Tigers Anna becomes close to Chris Brain, the Tigers agree to kidnap Anna for a bit of fun and send a ransom note to the Sharks. (though when they originally voice the idea you can hear Anna agree to it due.) Enraged by the demands, the Sharks endure the 1/2-mile swim and demand the return of their tribe mate who is hiding in the jungle with Chris Brain, Shipwrecked rules dictate that an opposing tribe cannot stand on the opposing island unless invited or if it is a Sunday (generally known as a Beach Party where the new castaway decide their tribe). The Sharks violate this rule by raiding the camp and in doing so taking Kevin with them, thus breaking another rule by unofficially joining an island without nomination. At the Beach Party in which Ryan chose his tribe (eventually, Tigers) they were informed that they would be punished for their actions, and that each tribe must sacrifice one of their own to move permanently. Tiger Island accepted Kevin's wish to return, meanwhile Shark Island's John Melvin volunteered to move.\nWhen Kevin and John swapped necklaces – they were reminded that this was non-negotiable. And they would never bear their old tribes necklace, much to the dismay of Sharks.\nReferences\nExternal links"
