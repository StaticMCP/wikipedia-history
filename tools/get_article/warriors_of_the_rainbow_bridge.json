In January 2005, guitarist Bobby Ingram invited Dave Hlubek, one of the original three guitarists, to rejoin Molly Hatchet and in doing so became the only current member who was a part of the original band, and appears on this album.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Molly Hatchet\n*Phil McCormack – lead vocals, harmonica\n*Bobby Ingram – guitars, acoustic guitar, backing vocals, producer, editor\n*Dave Hlubek – guitars, backing vocals\n*John Galvin – keyboards, piano, programming\n*Tim Lindsey – bass, backing vocals\n*Shawn Beamer – drums, percussion\n;Additional musicians\n*Rich DelFalvo – keyboards, piano\n;Production\n* Nikolo Kotzev – engineer, mixing\n* Rainer Hänsel – mixing\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!Chart (2005)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
