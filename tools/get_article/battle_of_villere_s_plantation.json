The British invaded the home of Major Gabriel Villeré, who narrowly evaded capture by jumping through a window. The British later established their headquarters in Villeré's house. As for Villeré himself, after his escape, he reported the British landing to Major General Andrew Jackson. After hearing about the British landing, Jackson allegedly exclaimed, \"By the Eternal, they shall not sleep on our soil!... Gentlemen, the British are below, we must fight them to-night.\"\nOrder of battle\nAmerican\nUnited States Army\n*7th Infantry Regiment\n*44th Infantry Regiment\nLouisiana Militia\n*Major D'Aquin's Battalion of Free Men of Color\n*Orleans Rifle Company\n*Baptiste Plauche's Battalion\nMississippi Militia\n*Mississippi Dragoons\nTennessee Militia\n*John Coffee's Mounted Rifles\nChoctaws warriors\nUnited States Navy\n*United States Marines\n*USS Carolina\n*USS Louisiana\nBritish\nBritish Army\n*4th Regiment of Foot\n*21st Regiment of Foot (reinforcements)\n*85th Regiment of Foot\n*93rd Regiment of Foot (reinforcements)\n*95th Rifle Regiment\nBattle\nOn the evening of 23 December, Jackson led a force of 2,131 men in a three-pronged assault on the British encampment. At 7:00pm, the USS Carolina under the command of Captain John D. Henley, and USS Louisiana, under the command of Master commandant Daniel Patterson bombarded the British camp. A half an hour after the Carolina's bombardment, Jackson sent his forces forwards with the Marines pressing forward along the levee, the 7th and 44th Infantry Regiments in column to the Marines' left, Plauche and Daquin's battalions coming in from the rear. The 7th and 44th Regiments made initial contact, routing a British force behind a hedge and ditch. As the battle progressed British reinforcements from the 21st Regiment of Foot and 93rd Regiment of Foot arrived and engaged the Americans, with the 21st Regiment of the Foot beating back John Coffee's Mounted Rifles.\nAftermath\nAfter the brief but chaotic engagement, Jackson withdrew his forces to the Rodriguez Canal. Historian Robert Quimby stated that the British won a \"tactical victory, which enabled them to maintain their position\" but also \"were disabused of their expectation of an easy conquest.\" The Bill of Rights Institute said about the engagement, \"Although a tactical defeat, the skirmish was a strategic victory for Jackson. It forced the British forces to remain in place and shattered their illusions of a quick and easy conquest. It also granted Jackson the time to build earthworks and other defenses he desperately needed to hold off the much larger enemy force. His men constructed ramparts more than five feet high and as many as twenty feet deep and reinforced with logs. The artillery was dug in at regular intervals. The gamble had paid off.\"\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
