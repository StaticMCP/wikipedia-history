Chartered in 1888, it completed building a road from Hawkinsville to Dublin, Georgia, in 1890. A receiver was appointed the same year.\nIt began by using a former logging railroad owned by the Empire Lumber Company that ran about  between Empire and Dublin, then rebuilding and extending it to Hawkinsville.\nWhen the Empire Lumber Company failed, the Empire and Dublin Railroad was sold at auction for $30,100, and was reorganized as the Oconee and Western Railroad in 1892.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Empire and dublin railroad\n\n#REDIRECT Empire and Dublin Railroad"
