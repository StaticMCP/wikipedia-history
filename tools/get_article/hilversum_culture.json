It has been associated with the Wessex culture from the same period in southern England, and is one of the material cultures of this part of northwestern continental Europe which has been proposed to have had a \"Nordwestblock\" language which was Indo-European, but neither Germanic nor Celtic.\n, , Netherlands.

An urn found there, initially classified as being of the Deverel–Rimbury type, was found to be older than was expected: radiocarbon dating pointed to 3450 BP (1770 +/-250 cal BC). This led archeologist  to propose a new classification, the Hilversum type, and the conclusion that later continental Deverel pottery would have \"devolved\" from this type.\nGenetic profile\nAn individual without funerary context was found in the Krabbeplas artificial lake (Vlaardingen, Zuid-Holland province), he was dated to 1421-1216 cal BCE, his Y-chromosome DNA was R1b-S497 (a derivation from R1b-U106).\nGallery\nFile:Zwaard van Ommerschans (39301299902).jpg|Sword of Ommerschans, Netherlands, .
