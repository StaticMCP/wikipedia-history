He nonetheless noted \"Against the Clock\", \"Dodgy Boat\" and the title track as highlights.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Allan Holdsworth – guitar, SynthAxe, mixing, producer\n*Naomi Star – vocals\n*Steve Hunt – keyboard (tracks 1, 2, 4, 5)\n*Gordon Beck – keyboard (tracks 9–11)\n*Chad Wackerman – drums (tracks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9–11), keyboard (track 7)\n*Gary Husband – drums (tracks 2, 4), keyboard (track 3)\n*Vinnie Colaiuta – drums (track 6)\n*Jimmy Johnson – bass\n*Joel Schnebelt – spoken vocals\n*Robert Feist – engineering\n*Gordon Davis – mixing\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140908202931/http://www.therealallanholdsworth.com/wardenclyffe2.htm Wardenclyffe Tower] at therealallanholdsworth.com (archived)\n*[https://www.guitar9.com/column/allan-holdsworth-wardenclyffe-tower Allan Holdsworth \"Wardenclyffe Tower\"] at Guitar Nine"
