His tone has never been accurately duplicated\".\nTrack listing\n# \"The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi\" (Bryan Stokes, Dudley Vernor) -  2:23\n# \"Stella by Starlight\" (Ned Washington, Victor Young) - 2:59\n# \"With Every Breath I Take\" (Ralph Rainger, Leo Robin) - 3:02\n# \"Accent on Youth\" (Vee Lawnhurst, Tot Seymour) - 2:57\n# \"But Beautiful\" (Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen) - 2:50\n# \"Time After Time\" (Sammy Cahn, Jule Styne) - 3:08\n# \"Nancy (With the Laughing Face)\" (Van Heusen, Phil Silvers) - 3:09\n# \"I'm Beginning to See the Light\" (Duke Ellington, Don George, Johnny Hodges, Harry James) - 2:44\n# \"It Was So Beautiful\" (Harry Barris, Arthur Freed) - 3:21\n# \"The Whiffenpoof Song\" (Tod Galloway, Meade Minnigerode, George S.
