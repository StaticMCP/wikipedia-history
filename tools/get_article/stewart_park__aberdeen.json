It is a  site owned by Aberdeen City Council. The land was originally bought by the council in 1891, when Woodside was incorporated into Aberdeen, using £500 bequeathed by Mrs. Jane Taylor, the widow of Mr. John Taylor, a merchant in the city \"for a playground for the children of Woodside\". The park was named after a former Lord Provost of the city, Sir David Stewart.\nThe park contains monumental whale jaw bones arches presented to the park in 1903 by the Captain of the Arctic whaler Benbow.\nThere is an intricate fountain designed as a replica of an Italian lavabo which was sculptured by Arthur Taylor of Jute Street, Aberdeen and erected in 1903 and was dedicated to Mrs. Jane Taylor whose bequest had funded the purchase of the land for the park.\nThere are nearby all weather tennis courts and bordered-off cricket and football pitches. The park is popular with local dog walkers and there is a playground for children.\nDirectly opposite the park are the \"Woodies\", an old granite quarry that is now a wooded area of land that is kept relatively wild.\nImage:SP Fountain.JPG|Stewart Park Fountain\nImage:Whale Bones.JPG|Stewart Park Whale Bones\nImage:StewartPark.JPG|Stewart Park Playing Fields\nSee also\n* Green spaces and walkways in Aberdeen\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/ACCI/web/site/Parks/NSC(Parks)/pos_StewartPark.asp Stewart Park]"
