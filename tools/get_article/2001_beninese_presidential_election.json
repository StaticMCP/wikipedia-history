They controversially resulted in the re-election of Mathieu Kérékou for a second term. Kérékou's rival Nicéphore Soglo, who had been president from 1991 to 1996, failed in his bid to reclaim the presidency; although he qualified to participate in the second round of the election against Kérékou, he refused to do so, alleging electoral fraud. Adrien Houngbédji, the parliament speaker and third-placed candidate, also refused to participate in a second round. As a result, Kérékou faced fourth-place candidate Bruno Amoussou, who was planning minister and had already given his support to Kérékou, in the second round; Kérékou won an easy victory with 84% of the vote.\nAfter the election, it was revealed that the Titan Corporation, a defense contractor based in the United States, had illegally provided $2 million to Kérékou's re-election campaign. The company pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $28.5 million in fines and civil penalties, the largest penalty under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act up to that point, for bribery and filing false tax returns.\nResults\n|party7=Democratic Party|votes7=15614|color7=red\n|cand8=Adébayo Abimbola|party8=National Rally for Democracy|votes8=15251\n|cand9=Wallis Zoumarou|party9=National Union for Solidarity and Progress|votes9=13576\n|cand10=Rhétice Dagba|party10=Independent|votes10=12697\n|cand11=Marie-Elise Gbèdo|party11=Independent|votes11=8952\n|cand12=Léandre Djagoué|party12=Liberal Democrats' Rally for National Reconstruction – Vivoten|votes12=8565\n|cand13=Lionel Agbo|party13=African Congress of Democrats|votes13=8226\n|cand14=Gatien Houngbédji|party14=Democratic Union for Social and Economic Development|votes14=8092\n|cand15=Olofindji Akandé|party15=Independent|votes15=6258\n|cand16=Sadikou Alao|party16=National Alliance for a Democratic Alternative|votes16=6223\n|cand17=François Kouyami|party17=Independent|votes17=5414\n|invalid=181066\n|invalid2=173809\n|electorate=3034471\n|electorate2=3152365\n|source=[https://africanelections.tripod.com/bj.html African Elections Database]\n}}\nReferences"
