There were six provinces and one special administrative city (the capital of the Republic, Stepanakert).\nMunicipalities in Artsakh were divided into 2 categories: urban communities and rural communities. Before the 2020 war, there were 10 towns (urban) and 322  villages (rural) in Artsakh.\nAdministrative divisions\nThese divisions included territories never controlled by the Republic of Artsakh. They were officially considered occupied by Azerbaijan.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Province\n! Population(2005 census)\n! Area (km2)\n! Capital\n!

Artsakh extended its provinces across the border of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO), removing the administrative distinction between the two areas. The following districts, which were not part of the NKAO but were in Azerbaijan proper, were completely within the de facto borders of Artsakh before the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war: Lachin, Qubadli, Zangilan, Jabrayil, Kalbajar. Additionally, parts of the following districts were partly under the control of Artsakh: Agdam District and Fuzuli District.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style\"background:#efefef;\"  | Former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast\n|-\n!
