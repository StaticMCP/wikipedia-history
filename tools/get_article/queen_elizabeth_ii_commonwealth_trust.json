The charity's focus is on social entrepreneurs who have founded organisations to address problems in their communities. Queen Elizabeth II, the charity's patron, was succeeded by King Charles III.\nIt was originally formed as the '''Queen's Commonwealth Trust (QCT)''', then changed its name on 4 July 2025.\nHistory and mission\nThe Queen's Commonwealth Trust, also known as QCT, was launched on 21 April 2018 (the Queen's 92nd birthday) with her patronage and her grandson Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex as president. After marriage, Harry's wife Meghan was appointed vice president later that year. The couple retained their positions until February 2021. In May 2024, King Charles III became the charity's patron.\nThe QCT seeks to elevate the work of young people in their efforts for change and to equalise their efforts with professional organisations. The Trust operates as a network for young changemakers throughout the Commonwealth, to fund, connect, and platform discussions and projects on a local level. Periodically, online QCT chat sessions are conducted and uploaded to YouTube for public viewing.\nIn March 2019, The Queen's Trust gave QCT its final funds of £2,672,287 from a planned run-down.\nIn 2021, model Naomi Campbell became a global ambassador for QCT.\nIn the financial year 2020/2021, QCT paid nearly all of its income on staff costs, £787,314 of the £796,106 it raised. The staff costs of its five senior executives was £420,000. The charity put this down the difficulties of raising donations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The charity operated at a large deficit during the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 financial years.\nProjects\nQECT finds and funds youths who are making a difference in their local communities. Projects and organisations supported by the Trust revolve around the issues of poverty, climate change, lack of access to healthcare, education and unemployment.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+QECT Funded Projects\n!Organisation\n!Founder(s)\n!Country\n|-\n|Justice Defenders (formerly African Prisons Project)\n|Alexander Mclean\n|Uganda/Kenya\n|-\n|The Justice Desk\n|Jessica Dewhurst\n|South Africa\n|-\n|GirlDreamer\n|Amna Akhtar and Kiran Kaur\n|United Kingdom\n|-\n|Eco Brixs\n|Andy Bownds and Gee Elliott\n|Uganda\n|-\n|Uganda Marathon\n|Henry Blanchard\n|Uganda\n|-\n|Unloc / Acts of Gratitude\n|Hayden Taylor and Ben Dowling (Unloc) / Jean D’Amour Mutoni (AoG)\n|Rwanda\n|-\n|Hope for Children Cameroon\n|Joannes Yimbesalu\n|Cameroon\n|-\n|Nature Fun Ranch\n|Corey Lane\n|Barbados\n|-\n|iDebate\n|Jean Michel\n|Rwanda\n|-\n| Kisoboka\n| Stephen Katende\n|Uganda\n|-\n| MAYEIN\n| Edem Ossai\n| Nigeria\n|-\n| Boundless Minds\n| Benjamin Rukwengye\n|Uganda\n|-\n| Planet Green Africa\n| Mwayi Kampesi and Atu Kampesi\n|Malawi\n|-\n| RBA Initiative\n| Erick Venant\n|Tanzania\n|-\n| OneDay Health\n| Nicolas Laing\n|Uganda\n|-\n| WISE\n| Caroline Odera\n|Kenya\n|-\n| IYAN\n| Daniel Misaki\n|Uganda\n|-\n| Ukani Malawi\n| Temwa Chirembo and Modester Mangilani\n|Malawi\n|}\n2019 OYW Partnership\nIn 2019, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust partnered with One Young World (OYW) to offer QCT Scholarships to 53 leaders – one from every Commonwealth country – to attend the 2019 OYW Summit in London, UK from 22–25 October.
