For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003.  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n4 Geo. 4\nThe fourth session of the 7th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 4 February 1823 until 19 July 1823.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 4 G. 4.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  for regulating the Trade between His Majesty's Possessions in America and the West Indies and other Parts of the World.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  for rendering the Payment of Creditors more equal and expeditious in Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  in so far as relates to the Application of certain Exchequer Bills therein mentioned.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and Fiftieth Years of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Third, for the preventing improper Persons from having Arms in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  as relates to the Toll payable on Carriages laden with Lime for the Improvement of Land.}}\n|  for the better preventing of clandestine Marriages.\"|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for apportioning the Burthen occasioned by the Military and Naval Pensions, and Civil Superannuations, with the Governor and Company of the Bank of England.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  respecting Justice of the Quorum in Cities and Towns Corporate.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  for the more speedy Return and Levying of Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures, and Recognizances estreated.}}\n|  for regulating the same.|note4= }}\n|  for allowing a Drawback of the Whole of the Duties of Customs on Brimstone used and consumed in Great Britain in the making and preparing Oil of Vitriol or Sulphuric Acid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and Twenty-seventh Years of King George the Second, and of the Third, Fourth and Twenty-second Years of King George the Third;
