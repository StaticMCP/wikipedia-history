      "text": "# Cockfosters War Memorial\n\nThe Cockfosters War Memorial is located at the junction of Chalk Lane and Cockfosters Road in Cockfosters, London. It commemorates the men of the district who died in the first and second World Wars and is in the form of a tapered column with a celtic cross at the top and the names of the dead on the base. It was unveiled by the Bishop of Willesden in March 1921.\nHistory\nFollowing the First World War, communities across the United Kingdom commissioned local memorials to honour those who had died in the conflict. In Cockfosters, residents and the parish of Christ Church Cockfosters raised funds for a permanent memorial, which was unveiled on 6 November 1921.\nAfter the Second World War, additional inscriptions were added to include the names of local men who died in that conflict as well.\nDesign\nThe memorial consists of a Portland stone cross mounted on a square plinth and stepped base. The front face bears the main dedication:\nIN HONOURED MEMORY\nOF THE MEN OF THIS VILLAGE\nWHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR\n1914-1918\nA plaque beneath commemorates those who died in the Second World War, reading:\nAND OF THE WORLD WAR 1939 – 1945\nA relief carving of a downward-pointing sword appears on the shaft of the cross, a symbol commonly used in British war memorials to represent sacrifice.\nLocation and setting\nThe memorial stands where Cockfosters Road meets Chase Side, near the entrance to Christ Church Cockfosters. Mature hedges and low walls surround the site, providing a defined space for commemoration within the suburban streetscape.\nListing and conservation\nThe Cockfosters War Memorial was listed at Grade II on 20 November 2017 for its architectural and historic interest. Its listing recognises its simple design, quality of craftsmanship, and local significance. The structure is recorded in the National Planning Database under entity ID [31855993].\nThe memorial has been maintained by the London Borough of Enfield with occasional conservation work supported by the War Memorials Trust. Its condition is regularly monitored, and local volunteers assist with upkeep, especially before annual remembrance events.\nRemembrance and community role\nThe memorial remains a local focal point for Remembrance Sunday services each November. A service is held at Christ Church, followed by a procession to the memorial, where wreaths are laid by civic representatives, local schools, veterans’ groups and community members.\nMany names inscribed on the memorial are researched by local historians, and further details can be found through the Imperial War Museums and Roll of Honour records.\nSee also\n* List of public art in Enfield\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
