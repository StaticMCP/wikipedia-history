Voters chose twelve representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nKentucky cast twelve electoral votes for the Democratic-Republican candidate and incumbent President James Monroe, as he ran effectively unopposed. The electoral votes for Vice president were cast for Monroe's running mate Daniel D. Tompkins from New York. The state was divided into three electoral districts with four electors each, whereupon each district's voters chose the electors through block voting. Monroe electors ran unopposed in Districts 1 and 3. In District 2, a single Federalist elector pledged to Monroe ran, winning more votes than the best performing Monroe elector.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1820 United States presidential election in Kentucky\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| James Monroe (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 2,729\n| align=\"right\" | 58.44%\n| align=\"right\" | 12\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Federalist\n|\n| align=\"right\" | 1,941\n| align=\"right\" | 41.56%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 4,670\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 12\n|-\n|}\nResults by electoral district\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Results by District\n! rowspan=\"2\" |District\n! colspan=\"3\"  |James Monroe\nDemocratic-Republican\n! colspan=\"3\"  |James Monroe\nFederalist\n! colspan=\"2\" |Margin\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total Votes Cast\n|-\n! |#\n! |%\n! |Electors\n! |#\n! |%\n! |Electors\n!#\n!%\n|-\n| |1\n|No Data\n|100%\n|4\n| colspan=3 align=center | no candidates\n|No Data\n|100%\n|No Data\n|-\n| |2\n|1,471\n|43.11%\n|3\n|1,941\n|56.89%\n|1\n| -470\n| -13.78%\n|3,412\n|-\n| |3\n|1,258\n|100%\n|4\n| colspan=3 align=center | no candidates\n| 1,258\n| 100%\n|1,258\n|-\n|Total\n|2,729\n|58.44%\n|12\n|1,941\n|41.56%\n|0\n|788\n|16.88%\n|4,670\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Kentucky\nNotes\nReferences"
