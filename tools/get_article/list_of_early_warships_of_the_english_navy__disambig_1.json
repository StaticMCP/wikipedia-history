These include major and minor warships from 1485 until 1660, the latter being the year in which the Royal Navy came formally into existence with the Restoration of Charles II (before the Interregnum, English warships had been the personal property of the monarch and were collectively termed \"the king's ships\"). Between Charles I's execution in 1649 and the Restoration eleven years later, the Navy became the property of the state (Commonwealth and Protectorate), under which it expanded dramatically in size.\nPrefix\nWhile the prefix \"HMS\" (for His or Her Majesty's Ship) is often applied in connection with these ships, the term was not technically applicable, as it was only instituted with the establishment of the Royal Navy in 1660, following the Restoration of King Charles II of England.\nGlossary\n* BU = broken up\nThe dates for ships before 1485 are probably listed using the contemporary English convention of the first day of the year being 25 March (Lady Day).\nIn the sections listing warships in the English/Royal Navy from 1485 onwards, the dates have been quoted using the modern convention of the year starting on 1 January, where this information is available. All dates are given in the Julian Calendar (\"Old Style\").\nList of English warships before 1485\nThe following list is based extensively upon that provided in Michael Oppenheim's History of the Administration of the Royal Navy and in Volume 1 of William Laird Clowes's The Royal Navy: A History from the Earliest Times to 1900.\n:Note that almost every vessel listed had the words \"of the Tower\" (or \"de la Tour\" when inscribed in French, still an official language at the time) affixed to its name. This affix was simply the equivalent of the modern prefix \"HMS\" and is omitted below.\n:The number of guns quoted in most sources comprised almost entirely small(ish) iron weapons created from wrought material bound into barrels by iron hoops. These were exclusively anti-personnel weaponry; very few heavy weapons were carried, and even these were rarely used for ship-to-ship fire.\n* Trinity – Dismantled c. 1409, materials used for Trinity Royal\n* Goodgrace (c. 1400)\n* Le Carake (ex-Genoese Sancta Maria & Sancta Brigida, captured 1409)\n* Christopher 5 (1410/12) – Holk (similar to a cog)\n* Trinity Royal (1416)\n* Jesus (c. 1416)\n* George (ex-Genoese carrack ?, captured 1416) – To Venice 1424\n* Marie Hampton (ex-Genoese carrack ?, captured 1416)\n* Marie Sandwich (ex-Genoese carrack ?, captured 1416)\n* Agase (ex-Genoese carrack ?, captured 1416) – Wrecked on mudflats c. 1418\n* Andrew (ex-Genoese carrack Galeas Negre, captured 1417)\n* Peter (ex-Genoese carrack ?, captured 1417)\n* Paul (ex-Genoese carrack Vivande, captured 1417)\n* Christopher Spayne (ex-Genoese Pynele ??, captured 1417) – Sold 1423\n* Marie Spayne (ex-Spanish ?, captured 1417)\n* Holigost Spayne [Holy Ghost of Spain] (ex-Spanish Santa Clara, captured 1417)\n* Grace Dieu (1418) – Lightning and fire, 1439\n* Grace Dieu (1449) – rebuilt 1473, BU c. 1487\n* Peter – Abandoned 1462\n* Mary 48\n* George\n* Edward Howard (c. 1466, ex-Portuguese ?, captured 1479)\n* Governor (1485)\nList of English warships 1485–1603\nThe lists for the Tudor period are taken primarily from Arthur Nelson's The Tudor Navy and David Childs's Tudor Sea Power (cited in references at the end of this article).\n::Where applicable, number of main guns follows name (see Rating system of the Royal Navy). Note that long-lived ships could be rearmed several times. Many earlier ships went through periodic repairs and rebuildings (many now unrecorded) during which their dimensions and their armament changed considerably.\nHenry VII (additions 1485–1509)\nThe number of guns listed in various sources is not really relevant; most of the large number quoted in contemporary records were small anti-personnel weapons, and the number of these would vary from time to time (changes usually unrecorded). Accordingly, the figures have been omitted.\n* Carvel of Ewe (purchased 1487) – last mentioned 1518\n* Regent (ex-Grace Dieu) (built 1488) – burnt at the Battle of St Matthieu, 1512\n* Sovereign (ex-Trinity Sovereign) (built 1488) – rebuilt 1509, last mentioned 1525\n* Michael (1488, a prize taken from the Scots; not to be confused with the much larger Scottish carrack Michael) – last mentioned 1513\n* Margaret (1490, a prize taken from the Scots) – deleted before 1509\n* Mary Fortune (prototype galleass built 1497) – renamed Swallow when rebuilt 1512, deleted 1527\n* Sweepstake (prototype galleass built 1497 in Portsmouth what is thought by some to be the UK's first dry dock) – deleted 1527\nHenry VIII (additions 1509–1547)\nHeavy (bronze) guns mounted on carriages only appeared during this reign. The concept of cutting gunports into the lower deck emerged early in the period, and relatively few heavy guns were carried. Even the largest would only have heavy guns numbering in single figures, the remainder being small anti-personnel weapons.\nShips\nThese were described simply as ships, most were probably carracks)\n** Mary Rose (1509) – rebuilt 1536, sank 1545, starboard-side remains recovered 1982 and preserved at Portsmouth\n** Peter Pomegranate (1510) – rebuilt 1536, deleted 1552\n** Jennet Prywin (ex-Scottish Andrew Barton, captured 1511, originally Danish) – deleted 1514\n** Lion (ex-Scottish privateer prize, captured 1511) – sold 1513\n** Anne Gallant (built 1512) – wrecked 1518\n** Christ (ex Christ of Lynn, purchased 1512) – captured by Barbary pirates 1515\n** Dragon (built 1512) – last recorded 1514\n** John Baptist (purchased 1512) – wrecked 1534\n** Mary George (ex Mary Howard, purchased 1512) – last recorded 1526\n** Mary James (ex James of Hull, purchased 1512) – last recorded 1529\n** Lizard (purchased 1512) – last recorded 1522\n** Great Nicholas (ex Nicholas Reede, purchased 1512) – deleted by 1522\n** Great Bark 63 (built 1512) – sold 1531\n** Little Barbara or Barbara of Greenwich (1512) – last recorded 1514\n** Black Bark or Christopher (1513) – last recorded 1514\n** Henry Hampton (purchased 1513) – hulked 1521 and not later recorded\n** Mary Imperial (1513) – last recorded 1525\n** Henri Grâce à Dieu (\"Great Harry\") 186 (1514) – rebuilt 1539, renamed Edward 1547, but accidentally burned 1553.\n** Great Elizabeth (ex Salvator von Lubeck, purchased 1514) – wrecked 1514.\n** Great Galley (built 1515) – rebuilt 1542 as a ship and renamed Great Bark\n** Less Bark (1517) – rebuilt 1536 and renamed Small Bark, last recorded 1552\n** Mary Gloria (purchased 1517) – last recorded 1522\n** Katherine Bark (built 1518) – last recorded 1525\n** Bark of Bullen (captured 1522 from the French) – last recorded 1525\n** Bark of Murless (ex Bark of Morlaix, captured 1522 from the French) – last recorded 1530\n** Magdeline (ex Mawdlyn of Deptford, 1522) – last recorded 1525\n** Mary and John (Spanish galleon) – last recorded 1528\n** John of Greenwich (captured 1523) – last recorded 1530\n** Primrose (built 1523) – rebuilt 1538, sold 1555\n** Minion (built 1523) – rebuilt 1536, given away 1549\n** Mary Guildford (built 1524) – last recorded 1539\n** Trinity Henry (1530) – sold 1558\n** Sweepstake (built 1535) – condemned 1559\n** Mary Willoughby (built 1535) – captured by the Scots 1536 but retaken 1547, rebuilt 1551, sold 1573\n** Matthew (ex Matthew Gonson, purchased 1539) – last recorded 1558\n** Pansy (built 1543) – condemned 1558\n** Artigo (ex Ferronière, captured 1543 from the French) – sold 1547\n** Jesus of Lübeck (ex-Hanseatic League carrack Jesus von Lübeck, purchased 1544) – sunk by Spanish 1568\n** Marryan (ex-Hanseatic League Morian Murryan, purchased 1544) – sold 1551\n** Struss (ex-Hanseatic League Struce of Dawsky, purchased 1544) – sold 1552\n** Mary Hambrough (ex-Hanseatic League, purchased 1544) – sold 1558\n** Christopher of Bream (purchased 1545) – sold 1556\n** Mary Thomas (captured 1545) – last recorded 1546\n** Mary James (captured 1545) – last recorded 1546\n** Mary Odierne (captured 1545) – last recorded 1546\n** Trinity (captured 1545) – last recorded 1546\n** Sacrett (captured 1545) – condemned 1559\n** Hope Bark (1546) – last recorded 1548\nCarracks\nThese were specifically mentioned as such, although most of the \"ships\" above were probably carracks also.\n** Gabriel Royal (ex Genoese, purchased 1512)\n** Katherine Fortune (ex Genoese Katarina Fortileza, purchased 1512)\n** Mary Loret (ex Genoese Maria de Larreto, requisitioned 1514, but returned later in the same year)\n** Great Barbara (ex Mawdelyn, purchased 1513) – last recorded 1524\nGalleys\n** Henry Galley (built 1512) – lost 1513\n** Rose Galley (1512) – last recorded 1521\n** Kateryn Galley (1512) – last recorded 1527\n** Galley Subtile (built 1543) – listed as a gallease 1546, condemned 1560\n** Mermaid (ex Galley Blanchard, captured 1545) – last recorded 1563\nGalleasses\nThe galleass was a compromise between the sleek lines and underwater shape of the galley and the broadside guns of the carrack; in this sense it was the predecessor of the galleon. Primarily sailing warships, with oars as ancillary means of propulsion. Twelve were built for Henry VIII in three groups between 1536 and 1546, and two further vessels of the type were captured from the Scottish Navy and added to the English fleet, and another was purchased. As the oars were found to detract from their sailing performance, they were removed by the time of Henry's death and in 1549 all fifteen galleasses were re-classed as 'ships'. Those in good condition were rebuilt as small galleons in 1558 (six) or 1570 (two).\nFirst group\nThese four vessels were three-masted galleasses, each with a low forecastle and three pairs of gunports set along the rowing deck. A fifth galleasse - the George - was much smaller and was purchased rather than built for the Navy.\n* Lion (1536) – taken to pieces 1552\n* Jennet (1539) – rebuilt as a galleon 1558\n* Dragon (1542) – taken to pieces 1552\n* Greyhound (1545) – rebuilt as a galleon 1558\n* George (1546) - taken to pieces 1558\nSecond group\nThe four ships built to this type (together with two similar vessels captured from the Scots) were four-masted galleasses with a higher forecastle. They also had three or four pairs of gunports on the lower deck, but also a couple of smaller pairs on the half-deck above.\n* New Bark (1543) – rebuilt as a galleon 1558\n* Swallow (1544) – rebuilt as a galleon 1558\n* Unicorn (captured 1544 from the Royal Scots Navy) – taken to pieces 1552\n* Salamander (built 1537 in France and captured 1544 from the Royal Scots Navy) – condemned 1559\n* Grand Mistress (1545) – sold to take to pieces 1552\n* Anne Gallant (1545) – gone by 1560\nLast group\nAlso four-masted, these were flush-decked vessels, with the forecastle joined to the half-deck to form a continuous upper deck.\n* Hart (1546) – rebuilt as a galleon 1558\n* Antelope 38 (1546) – rebuilt as a galleon 1558\n* Bull 26 (1546) – rebuilt as a galleon 1570\n* Tiger (1546) – rebuilt as a galleon 1570\nOther small vessels\nThese were classed as pinnaces\n** Great Zebra (1522) – last recorded 1525\n** Less Zebra (1522) – last recorded 1525\n** Mary Grace (a hoy Mary of Homflete, captured 1522 from the French) – last recorded 1525\n** Great Pinnace (1544, but may have been the Great Zabra renamed) – last recorded 1545\n** Less Pinnace (1544, but may have been the Less Zabra renamed) – last recorded 1549\n** Falcon (1544) – listed as a ship from 1557, last recorded 1578\n** Roo (built 1545) – captured by the French 1547\n** Marlion or Martin (captured from the French 1545) – last recorded 1549\n** Saker (built 1545) – listed as a ship from 1557, last recorded 1565\n** Hind (built 1545) – listed as a ship from 1557, sold 1557\n** Brigantine (built 1545) – captured by the French 1552\n** Hare (built 1545) – sold 1573\n** Phoenix (purchased 1546) – listed as ship from 1557, rebuilt 1558 and sold 1573\n** Trego Ronnyger (1546) – last recorded 1549\nAlso in 1546, thirteen armed rowbarges of 20 tons each were built – Double Rose, Flower de Luce (captured by the French in 1562), Sun, Harp, Cloud in the Sun, Hawthorne, Three Ostrich Feathers, Falcon in the Fetterlock, Portcullis, Rose in the Sun, Maidenhead, Roseslip and Gillyflower. The first three of these were rebuilt in 1557–58 and classed as pinnaces, the next five named above were sold in 1548–49 (for £154.4.0d each) and the last five were condemned in 1552.\nEdward VI (additions 1547–1553)\nNotwithstanding the considerable number of minor additions below, few significant vessels were added during this brief reign, and the majority of those that were added are prizes. Except where a fate is stated below, all the following were only listed as king's ships in the year quoted in brackets, and did not appear subsequently in records.\n** Black Pinnace 17 (1548)\n** Spanish Shallop 7 (1548)\n** Great Bark Aiger (1549)\n** Black Galley (captured 1549) – retaken by the French in the same year\n** Swift (1549) – listed to 1558\n** Moon 12 (1549) – wrecked 1553 off West Africa\n** Seven Stars (1549) – listed to 1558\n** Mary Norwell (1549)\n** John (captured 1549)\n** Lion (ex-Royal Scots Navy, captured 1549)\n** Margaret (1549)\n** Nicholas (captured 1549)\n** Katherine (captured 1549)\n** Small Swallow (1549)\n** Bark of Bullen (1550) – given away in 1553\n** Jer Falcon (1550) – condemned 1558\n** Edward Bonaventure (1551) – wrecked 1556 at Aberdeen.\nMary I (additions 1553–1558)\nContrary to the subsequent Elizabethan propaganda that Mary's reign neglected the Navy, this brief reign saw the addition of the first real galleons (all Henry's new or rebuilt big ships had been carracks) – the first three detailed below – and the rebuilding of six former galleasses to the galleon concept, as well as the commencement of a larger vessel ordered under the name Edward, which was to be launched as Elizabeth Jonas in the first few months of Elizabeth's reign.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For many early warships, the published \"number of guns\" included smaller anti-personnel weapons (mounted on swivels), whereas for strict comparison with later data only carriage-mounted heavy guns should be included.\n:The major ships (from 1618 onwards) are included in pages&nbsp;158–159 of The Ship of the Line, Volume I, by Brian Lavery, published by Conways, 1983, .

The largest of the great ships were categorised as ships royal, while the remainder were grouped as middling ships or small ships.Note that ships royal would under Charles I become the first rank (later first rate) ships; similarly, great ships would become the second rank (later second rate) ships; middling ships would become the third rank (later third rate) ships; and small ships would become the fourth rank (later fourth rate) ships – later to be further sub-divided (about 1650) into fourth, fifth and sixth rates.\n* Ships royal (later, first rank ships)\n**  40 guns (1608) – a rebuilding of the Ark Royal of 1587.\n**  51 guns (1610) – a replacement for (not a rebuilding of) the Victory of 1560.\n**  40 guns (1615) – a rebuilding of the ship of 1590.\n* Great ships (later, second rank ships)Originally with 32–34 guns, by 1660 this had increased to 56 guns (64 in the Triumph).\n**  34 guns (1605) – a second rebuilding of the Hope of 1559.\n**  32 guns (1605) – a rebuilding of the Nonpareil of 1584 (itself a rebuilding of the Philip and Mary of 1556.\n**  32 guns (1609) – a second rebuilding of the Golden Lion of 1557.\n**  34 guns (1610) – a rebuilding of the ship of 1596.\n**  34 guns (1613) – a rebuilding of the ship of 1590.\n**  34 guns (1615) – a rebuilding of the ship of 1586.\n**  34 guns (1615) – a rebuilding of the ship of 1586.\n**  42 (1619) – Joined Royalists June 1648, lost September 1651.\n**  42 (1620) – Rebuilt 1666.\n**  42 (1621) – Rebuilt 1654.\n**  42 (1622) – Renamed George 1649 but resumed name St George in 1660, hulked 1687 and then sunk as a blockship 1697.\n**  42 (1622) – Renamed Andrew 1649 but resumed name St Andrew in 1660, wrecked 1666.\n**  42 (1623) – Sold 1688.\n* Middling ships (later, third rank ships) Originally with only 28 or 30 guns, this was raised to 30–34 by 1633 and 40 guns by 1652.\n**  29 guns (1607) – a second rebuilding of the Swiftsure of 1592.\n**  28 guns (1614) – a second rebuilding of the ship of 1573.\n**  30 guns (1618) – a second rebuilding of the ship of 1546.\n**  28 (1619) – Burnt 1658 by accident.\n**  28 (1620) – Captured by the Netherlands at the Battle of Dungeness, 1652.\n**  30 (1621) – Blew up and sunk at the Battle of Leghorn, 1653.\n**  30 guns (1620) – built as the Destiny for Sir Walter Ralegh in 1616, and acquired by the Navy in 1620 – sold at Lisbon by the Royalists 1650.\n* Small ships (later, fourth rank ships)\n**  18 guns (1613) – not mentioned after 1624.\n** Mary Rose'' 26 (1623) – Wrecked 1650.\nNew and rebuilt ships, Charles I (1625–1642)\nNote that this list only included the first part of Charles's reign preceding the English Civil War (i.e. up to 1642), Subsequent acquisitions are listed in the following section.\n* First rank (ships royal)\n**  102 (1637) – Renamed Sovereign in 1649, renamed Royal Sovereign in 1660, rebuilt 1659-1660\n**  First Rank, 70 (rebuilt 1641) – Rearmed to 80, rebuilt again 1663\n* Second rank (great ships)\n**  Second Rank, 40 (rebuilt 1629) – Rearmed to 56 guns by 1660, sunk as a breakwater 1680.\n**  Second Rank, 40 (rebuilt 1631) – Rearmed to 56, wrecked, sold 1667\n**  44 (1632) – Renamed Liberty 1649, wrecked 1650\n**  42 (1633) – Renamed Paragon 1650, lost 1655\n**  48 (c. 1634) – rearmed as 60 guns by 1660, sold 1682\n**  46 (1634) – rearmed as 56 guns by 1660, sold 1688\n* Third rank (middling ships)\n**  34 (1634)\n**  34 (1635) – Captured by Netherlands 1653\n**  40 (rebuilt 1640 from Second Rate) – Rebuilt again 1658\nLesser ships\nEarly frigates\n*  10 (1636) – Collision 1641\n*  12 (1636) – Blown up in action 1656\n*  14/30 (1637) – Sold 1667\n*  14/30 (1637) – Wrecked 1668\nCaptured ships, 1625–1636\n*  (ex-French, captured 1625)\n*  38 (ex-French, captured 1625)\n*  (ex-French, captured 1625)\n*  (ex-French, captured 1626)\n*  (ex-French, captured 1626)\n*  (ex-French, captured 1627)\n*  42 (ex-Dutch, captured 1627 from French)\n*  (ex-Dunkirker, captured 1635) – Sunk 1638\n*  6 (ex-Dunkirker, captured 1636) – Sold 1657\nList of major English warships of the English Civil War, the Commonwealth and Protectorate (1642–1660)\nThe interregnum between the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the Restoration of royal authority in 1660 saw the full emergence of the ship-of-the-line and its employment during the first Anglo-Dutch War. During this period the English navy technically became first the Commonwealth Navy, later the Protectorate Navy and subsequently the Commonwealth Navy again; the prefix \"HMS\" is thus not applicable to any English warship during the Interregnum. In fact, the abbreviated form \"HMS\" was not used until nearly the end of the following century, with the term \"His Majesty's Ship\" (formally altered to \"Their Majesties' Ship\" between 1689 and 1694, when William I and Mary II were co-rulers, and to \"Her Majesty's Ship\" between 1702 and 1714, and again from 1837 to 1901, when there was a queen on the throne) always appearing in full.\nThe following lists include ships of the line, i.e. vessels of the first, second, third and fourth rates which were judged fit to stand in the line of battle. Smaller warships of the fifth and sixth rates, and the even smaller unrated vessels, appear in the subsequent section.\nUnder the categorisation as amended in late 1653, the rates were based on the number of men in the established complement of a ship, as follows:\n* First rate, 400 men and over.\n* Second rate, 300 men and up to 399.\n* Third rate, 200 men and up to 299.\n* Fourth rate, 140 men and up to 199.\nHowever, there were numerous exceptions, and ships changed their Rating from time to time.\n:Number of main guns follows name (see rating system of the Royal Navy)\n:The larger ships are listed in pages&nbsp;159–160 of The Ship of the Line Volume I, by Brian Lavery, published by Conways, 1983, , and more fully in British Warships in the Age of Sail: 1603–1714, by Rif Winfield, published by Seaforth Publishing, 2009, . Lesser warships (\"below the line\") are taken from A History of the Administration on the Royal Navy (sic!) 1509–1660, by Michael Oppenheim, published by the Bodley Head, 1896, as well as from Winfield's book.\n:The frigates listed here are not the type of vessel known as frigates in the 18th and 19th centuries. The term in the 17th century signified a fast vessel, with low superstructure to give more stability.\nFirst and second rates (three-decked ships)\nA programme comprising four second rates of 60 guns each was adopted in 1654. However, of these four ships the Naseby was completed as a first rate, while the Richard was reclassed as a first rate in 1660 (and renamed).\n* First rate\n** Naseby 80 (1655) – Renamed Royal Charles 1660, captured by the Netherlands, 1667, BU.\n* Second rates\n**  70 (1658) – Renamed Royal James 1660, burnt 1667.\n**  64 (1656) – Renamed Henry 1660, rearmed to 82, burnt by accident in 1682.\n**  64 (1656) – Blown up by accident in 1665.\nEarly frigates (fourth rates)\n* '''The 'first' English frigate'\n**  32 (1645) built as a private venture; she was hired by the Navy from 1646, and purchased outright in 1649 – BU 1666 for rebuild\n* 1646 programme group\n**  32 (1646) – Sold 1698\n**  34 (1646) – BU 1688 for rebuild\n**  34 (1646) – Wrecked 1664\n* 1647 programme group\n**  32 (1647) – BU 1690 for rebuild\n**  32 (1647) – Burnt 1667\n**  32 (1647) – Captured by the Netherlands at the Battle of Elba, 1652, recaptured 1652, wrecked 1664\n**  32 (1647) – BU 1681 for rebuild\nLater frigates (third and fourth rates)\n* Great frigate (second rate)\n**  56 (c. 1651) – Wrecked 1652\n* 'Speaker group third rate frigates'\n**  52 (c. 1650) – Burnt 1653\n**  50 (c. 1650) – Renamed Mary 1660\n* 1649 programme group, third rate frigates\n**  48 (c. 1651) – Renamed Dunkirk 1660\n* 1652 programme group, third rate frigates\n**  48 (c. 1653) – Captured by the Netherlands at the Four Days Battle, 1666\n**  50 (1654) – Rearmed to 54, rearmed to 60, wrecked 1682\n**  52 (c. 1653)\n**  52 (c. 1654) – Renamed Dreadnought 1660, rearmed to 62, sank 1690\n**  52 (c. 1654) – Renamed Revenge 1660, condemned 1678\n**  52 (c. 1654) – Renamed Anne 1660, blew up 1673\n**  52 (c. 1654) – Renamed Montague 1660\n**  52 (c. 1654) – Renamed York 1660, wrecked 1703\n**  50 (c. 1654) – Renamed Henrietta 1660, wrecked 1689\n**  52 (c. 1653) – Wrecked 1674\n**  50 (c. 1654) – Renamed Resolution'' 1660, burnt at the St. James' Day Battle, 1666\n* Later third rate frigates\n**  52 (c. 1659)\n* 1649 programme group, fourth rate frigates\n**  34 (1650) – Blew up 1689\n**  34 (1650) – Renamed Bonaventure 1660\n* 1650 programme group, fourth rate frigates\n**  34 (1650) – Wrecked 1698\n**  34 (1650)\n**  34 (1650)\n**  34 (1650)\n**  34 (1650) – Burnt 1656\n**  34 (1650) – Wrecked 1689\n* 1651 programme group, fourth rate frigates\n**  34 (1651) – Rearmed to 46, wrecked 1657\n**  34 (1651) – Wrecked 1671\n**  38/40 (1653) – Rearmed to 44\n* 'Ruby class (part of 1651 programme)\n**  40 (1651) – Captured by France at the Battle at The Lizard, 1707\n**  40 (1652) – Captured by France 1693\n* 1652 programme group, fourth rate frigates'\n**  40 (1652) – Renamed Kent 1660, wrecked 1672\n**  38/40 (1652) – Rearmed to 46, blew up 1653\n**  40 (1653) – Burnt to avoid capture 1692\n**  38 (1653) – Rearmed to 46\n* 1653 programme group, fourth rate frigates\n**  38/40 (1653) – Renamed Swallow 1660, wrecked 1692\n**  40 (1653) – Renamed Antelope 1660, sold 1693\n**  38/40 (1654) – Renamed Bredah 1660, wrecked 1666\n**  38/40 (1654) – Captured by France 1691\n**  40/48 (1654) – Renamed Mary Rose 1660, – Captured by France 1691\n**  40 (1654) – Renamed Crown 1660, rearmed to 48\n**  40 (1654) – Rearmed to 48\n* Large type (built as 44-gun, later raised in stages to 54 guns)\n**  44 (1653) – Wrecked 1703\n**  44 (1653) – BU 1680\n**  44 (1654) – Renamed Happy Return 1660, captured by France 1691\n**  44 (1659) – Scuttled 1699\n**  44 (1660) – BU 1680\nMajor rebuilds\n*  100 (1660) – Rebuilt 1685\n*  60 (1654) – Captured by the Dutch 1667\n*  48 (c. 1658) – re-armed at 60 by 1677.
