He competed for England in the men's 3 metre springboard event at the 2014 Commonwealth Games where he won a bronze medal with his diving partner, Nicholas Robinson-Baker. He took part in the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics 3m springboard but narrowly missed qualifying for the semi-finals.\nWoodward is the current British 3m synchro (with James Heatly) and 1m individual champion, winning both events at the 2018 British Diving Championships.\nWoodward retired in 2018, stating that a career in competitive diving was not sustainable in his current position. He subsequently spent 6 months on a cruise-liner, acting as an on-board aquatics performer, before returning to the UK. He has since continued in his work as an on-board aquatics performer for a second cruise season.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
