It served the Ladywood area of Birmingham, it was also the site of a large goods yard and a locomotive shed. In 1886, a new station was opened just north of the first station.\nThe station closed in 1958, although the Rugby–Birmingham–Stafford line loop from the West Coast Main Line still runs through the site of the station today.\nMonument Lane goods yard was adjacent to the East, as was an engine shed with turntable.\nThere is some evidence of the station on the ground today, as there is a gap in the tracks running currently through the site at the location of an island platform.  There were calls for a new station to be built at this site to serve the International Convention Centre but this seems unlikely to happen owing to the Midland Metro extension now running to Centenary Square.\n|next=|route=London and North Western RailwayStour Valley Line|col=004400}}\n|next=|route=Harborne RailwayHarborne Branch Line|col=004400}}\nReferences\n*[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22960 British History Online: Birmingham Communications]"
