He served as the Creative Director of Issey Miyake from 2006 to 2011 and co-developed the experimental clothing system A-POC (A Piece of Cloth), a zero-waste garment production method now part of the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA) permanent collection.\nEarly life and education\nFujiwara studied Chinese painting and calligraphy at the China Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. He graduated from Tama Art University with a degree in textile design.\nCareer\nFujiwara joined the Miyake Design Studio in 1994 as part of the Issey Miyake Paris collection team. He first gained recognition through his collaboration with Issey Miyake on the A-POC project, launched in 1998. The concept utilized computer-controlled manufacturing to create entire garments from a single thread, allowing for reduced fabric waste and user customization. The project received the Good Design Grand Prize in 2000 and the Mainichi Design Award in 2003.\nIn October 2006, Fujiwara was appointed Creative Director of Issey Miyake, where he led collections from Autumn/Winter 2007, integrating elements such as wind, water, and movement as narrative themes. His leadership ended after the Autumn/Winter 2011 collection, when he left the company to pursue independent projects.\nFujiwara subsequently launched DAIFUJIWARA & COMPANY (DAI&Co.), a Tokyo-based studio focusing on multidisciplinary design strategies across fashion, community projects, and color-based storytelling. He has held additional roles including professor at Tama Art University, director of the MUJI to GO project, and creative director for initiatives such as Shiseido's \"LINK OF LIFE\" and Hitachi's \"Hi Miura.\"\nExhibitions\nFujiwara has directed and contributed to several exhibitions:\n* \"A-POC MAKING: ISSEY MIYAKE & DAI FUJIWARA\" (2005–2006), Vitra Design Museum, Weil am Rhein, Germany\n* \"COLOR-HUNTING\" (2013), 21_21 Design Sight, Tokyo – An exhibition exploring color through spontaneous watercolor mixing and collaborative results with researchers and corporations\n* Items: Is Fashion Modern? (2017–2018), Museum of Modern Art, New York – Featured A-POC designs including \"A-POC Le Feu\" from Spring/Summer 1999\n* \"The Road of My Cyber-Physical Hands\" (2021), HKDI Gallery, Hong Kong Design Institute – A solo exhibition showcasing 24 works from his career, focusing on handcraft, data, and cyber-physical environments\n* \"Human Nature\" (date unspecified), Chigasaki City Museum of Art, Japan\nDesign philosophy\nFujiwara approaches design as a universal language capable of translating invisible phenomena—such as wind, time, and emotion—into tangible, sensorial experiences. His methodology often begins with field research, color observation, and movement analysis, drawing inspiration from nature and emphasizing minimalism and humility. He integrates ecological and cultural systems, blending digital innovation with traditional sensibilities. In an interview, he described himself as \"a hunter of things invisible to the eye.\"\nSelected talks and appearances\nFujiwara has shared his work at various international platforms, including:\n* Design Indaba (2009) – \"Dai Fujiwara Answers All\"\n* Japan Design International Symposium, Milan (2022) – Speaker on \"Arts Over the Boundaries\"\nExternal links\n* [https://www.daiand.com/ Official website – DAI&Co.]\n* [https://www.moma.org/collection/works/100361 MoMA: A-POC by Dai Fujiwara]\n* [https://www.2121designsight.jp/en/program/color_hunting/ Color-Hunting – 21_21 Design Sight]\n* [https://www.axismag.jp/posts/2021/03/345329.html AXIS Magazine: HKDI Exhibition]\n* [https://www.designboom.com/design/dai-fujiwara-interview/ Designboom profile]\n* [https://www.dezeen.com/tag/dai-fujiwara/ Dezeen archive]\n:Category:1967 births\n:Category:Living people\n:Category:Japanese fashion designers\n:Category:Tama Art University alumni\nReferences"
