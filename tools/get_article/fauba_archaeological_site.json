The site was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1978, when the region was part of the US-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.\nDescription\nThe site consists of an area enclosed by a stone wall that is roughly triangular in shape.  The wall is between  in height, and is about  thick.  The enclosed area includes a number of stone platforms, and there is a refuse midden outside the enclosure that is believed to be associated with the site.  The exact purpose of the site is a subject of debate: although its siting has obvious military benefits (including commanding views of Chuuk Lagoon and other islands of the atoll, it is not clear that it actually saw military activity.\nReferences"
