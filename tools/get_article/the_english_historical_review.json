It publishes articles on all aspects of history – British, European, and world history – since the classical era. It is the oldest surviving English language academic journal in the discipline of history.\nSix issues are currently published each year, and typically include at least six articles from a broad chronological range (roughly, medieval, early modern, modern and twentieth century) and around forty book reviews. The journal has (as of 2023) introduced a new section entitled Reflections, which includes historiographical essays, review articles, and assessments of the contributions of individual scholars to the field. It also aims to publish one Forum collection each year.\nThe journal was established in 1886 by John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton, Regius professor of modern history at Cambridge, and a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. The first editor was Mandell Creighton. The current editors are Nandini Chatterjee, Misha Ewen, Alex Middleton, Jan Rüger, John Sabapathy and Hannah Skoda.\nList of editors\nEditors of The English Historical Review:\n* 1886–1891: Mandell Creighton\n* 1891–1894: Samuel Rawson Gardiner, assisted by Reginald Lane Poole\n* 1895–1901: S.&nbsp;R.
