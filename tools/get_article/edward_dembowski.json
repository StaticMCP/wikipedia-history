On account of Edward's szlachta origins and contrasting radical social views, he was called \"the red castellan's-son.\"\nDembowski published Przegląd Naukowy (The Learned Review), a journal for young, independence-minded members of the intelligentsia.\nIn 1842–43 Dembowski conducted underground revolutionary activities in the Russian-ruled Congress Poland.  Later, being at risk of arrest by Russian authorities, he transferred to Prussian-ruled Greater Poland.\nDuring the 1846 Kraków Uprising, Dembowski was secretary to dictator Jan Tyssowski.  Dembowski died on 27 February 1846 at Podgórze, shot by Austrian troops while leading a procession to conduct agitation among the peasants.\nIn his philosophical views, Dembowski was a leftist Hegelian.\nSee also\n*History of philosophy in Poland\n*List of Poles\nNotes\nReferences\n*\"Dembowski, Edward,\" Encyklopedia Polski (Encyclopedia of Poland), Kraków, Wydawnictwo Ryszard Kluszczyński, 1996, , p.&nbsp;128.\n* Władysław Tatarkiewicz, Zarys dziejów filozofii w Polsce (A Brief History of Philosophy in Poland), [in the series:]  Historia nauki polskiej w monografiach (History of Polish Learning in Monographs), [volume] XXXII, Kraków, Polska Akademia Umiejętności (Polish Academy of Learning), 1948.
