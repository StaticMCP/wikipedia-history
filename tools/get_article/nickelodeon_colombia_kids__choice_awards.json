This was also intended as an incentive to reward Colombia's young students, if they performed well academically (on a national level) in the school year 2012–2013. Ultimately, the popular Colombian sitcom on Spanish-language Nickelodeon, Chica Vampiro, would go on to win Personality of the Year (Colombian) and Best Musical Artist (Colombian). Other nominees included a diverse range of celebrities, from Alkylados, Linda Palma, Diego Saenz, to 21 bedroom, among others.
