The team plays its home games at the 4,000 seat Duane Stadium in North Andover, Massachusetts. The Warriors are led by Mike Gennetti.\nHistory\nThe Merrimack football program had its first official season in 1996. During this time the Warriors played their home games at Martone-Mejail Field. Which also served as the schools soccer and softball field. Led by head coach Tom Caito the warriors played a 9 game schedule. That consisted of both Division III and Division II opponents. They ended up going 5-4 in their inaugural season.\nBefore the 1997 season the Warriors joined the Eastern Football Conference. The conference shut down after only 3 seasons only lasting from 1997-2000. They would have their first really successful season in 1999 when they were 7-3 overall and 6-3 in conference.\nIn 2001 the Warriors and all the other schools from the Eastern Football Conference joined the Northeast 10 conference. Going 6-4 in 2001 and 2002. Coach Caito left after the 2002 season and was replaced by Jim Murphy. The warriors were 6-3 in 2003. Then in 2004 the Warriors had their best season in program history with an 8-2 record but did not qualify for the NCAA tournament. At the end of the year WR Elfren Quiles was the first player in program history to be honored as an All American. After leading the nation in receiving yards per game. 2006 wound up being another historic season for the Warriors going 8-4 overall and 7-2 in conference play. Merrimack also claimed a share of the NE10 championship this season which was the first championship in program history. They also qualified for their first and only appearance to the NCAA division II playoffs. The Warriors hosted Southern Connecticut State in the first round and won 28-26. They then went on the road to face Shepherd in the second round falling 31-7 to the rams. For all the success during the season Murphy was named NE10 coach of the year. Murphy left after the 2007 season following a 4-6 record then being replaced by John Perry. The warriors were 6-4 in Perry’s first year during the 2008 campaign season. In 2009 Perry led the Warriors to their second NE10 title going 6-2 in conference play and 7-3 overall. Despite this the Warriors did not qualify for the NCAA tournament. At the end of the season QB James Suozzo was the first player in program history to be named NE10 MVP after averaging 325.1 total yards per game. After a 4-6 record in 2010, they were 6-4 in 2011 and 2012 which would be Coach Perry’s final to years as he would leave to become the QB coach for Delaware in 2013.\nWarriors linebacker Shawn Loiseau was the first player in program history to sign an NFL deal in 2012, after being NE10 defensive player the year in both 2010 and 2011.\nThe Warriors promoted assistant coach Dan Curran to replace Perry as their new head coach. The Warriors kicked off the 2013 season on the road against FCS school Wagner. This ended up being the programs first ever victory against a Division 1 opponent beating the Skyhawks in a high scoring affair 42-41. The Warriors finished the season 7-4 and would end the year with a 35-24 win over #8 Southern Connecticut State. Warriors QB Joe Clancy also became the first ever NE10 QB to throw for 4000 yards in a season. This however was the warriors last successful season at the D2 level, as they see mediocre results for the next 5 seasons.\nDuring the 2017 season they played their first season at Duane Stadium.\nIn 2019, Merrimack announced they would move their athletics program up to the Division 1 level and would join the Northeast Conference with football becoming a Division I FCS program. . The Warriors played a mix of Division 1 and Division 2 schools in their first D1 season. They would finish the year 6-5 with 3 of those wins coming against D1 schools Delaware State, Presbyterian and LIU. Early on in the 2021 season the Warriors played their first game vs a ranked FCS opponent #24 Holy Cross. The Warriors pulled off the biggest win in program history beating the Crusaders 35-21. They  finished the year 5-6. Jacari Carter became the first player in program history to be named a D1 all American at the end of the season. During the 2022 season they tied a program record in wins with a 8-3 overall record going 6-1 in conference play. The final game of the season ended up being a de facto conference championship game against the Saint Francis Sed Flash who were also carrying a 6-0 record in conference play going into the final week of the season. Due to the athletic program being in the last year of The NCAA's 4-year reclassification rule, the program was not eligible to qualify for the 2022 FCS Playoffs. The Warriors ended up losing 52-23 on home soil. In 2023 the Warriors found themselves in the same position overcoming a poor start to the season. The Duquesne Dukes were also 4-2 in conference play heading into the final week of the season. This set up another defacto NEC Championship Game with the Warriors being eligible for postseason berth. The Warriors met the same fate falling 26-14 on home soil. This would end up being the programs last game in the NEC.\nIn October 2023 it was announced Merrimack would leave the NEC to join the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference along with fellow NEC member Sacred Heart. Due to the MAAC not sponsoring football, both Merrimack and Sacred Heart became FCS independents. Shortly after the 2023 season ended, Head Coach Dan Curran left the program to take up the same position at Holy Cross. The Warriors promoted long time assistant Mike Gennetti to become the 5th Head Coach in program history. In his first season the Warriors finished with a 5-6 record in their first year as an independent during the 2024 season.  in 2024]]\nWins vs Ranked FCS Opponents\n*September 11, 2021 Vs #24 Holy Cross (the Warriors won 35-21)\nClassifications\n*1996: NCAA Division III\n*1997–2018: NCAA Division II\n*2019–present: NCAA Division I FCS\nConference memberships\n* 1985–1995: Independent\n*1996: Eastern Collegiate Football Conference\n*1997–2000: Eastern Football Conference\n*2001–2018: Northeast-10 Conference\n*2019–2023: Northeast Conference\n*2024-present FCS independent\nHead Coaches\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Tenure\n!Coach\n!Years\n!Record\n|-\n|1996-2002\n|Tom Caito\n|7\n|34-33\n|-\n|2003-2007\n|Jim Murphy\n|5\n|30-21\n|-\n|2008-2012\n|John Perry\n|5\n|29-21\n|-\n|2013-2023\n|Dan Curran\n|11\n|53-58\n|-\n|2024–present\n|Mike Gennetti\n|1\n|5-6\n|}\nSource\nChampionships\nNortheast 10\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Coach\n!Conference record\n!Overall record\n!Note\n|-\n|2006\n|Jim Murphy\n|7-2\n|8-4\n|Co champions with Post and Southern Connecticut\n|-\n|2009\n|John Perry\n|6-2\n|7-3\n|Co champions with Bentley and Southern Connecticut\n|}\nPlayer & Coaches Awards\n]]\nPlayer Awards\nGeorge H. “Bulger” Lowe Award\n*Jermaine Corbett (2024)\nNEC offensive player of the year\n* Donovan Wadley (2023)\nFCS All-Americans\n* Jacari Carter (2021)\n* Victor Dawson (2022)\n* Brandon Robert’s (2022)\n* Donovan Wadley (first team 2023)\n* Jermaine Corbett (second team 2024)\nD2 All Americans\n* Elfren Quiles (2004)\n* Andrew Jackson (2006, 2008)\n* Anthony Smalls (2009)\n* Tony Johnson (2010)\n* Shawn Loiseau (2010, 2011)\n* Isaiah Voegeli (2011, 2012)\n* Jere Brown (2013)\n* Joe Clancy (2013)\n* Quinn McDonough (2013)\n* Ben Polci (2015)\nNE10 Most Valuable player\n* James Suozzo (2009)\n* Isaiah Voegeli (2012)\nNE10 Offensive player of the year\n* Joe Clancy (2012, 2013)\n* Jere Brown (2015)\nNE10 Defensive player of the year\n* Jimmy Festa (1999)\n* Shawn Loiseau (2010, 2011)\nNE10 Freshman/Rookie of the year\n* Elfren Quiles (2004)\n* Chris Carter (2018)\nNE10 Defsinve Lineman of the year\n* Robert Slattery (1998, 1999)\n* Tony Johnson  (2010, 2011)\nCoach Awards\nNE10 Coach of the year\n* Jim Murphy (2006)\nGridiron Club of Greater Boston Assistant Coach of the Year\n* Mike Gennetti (2022)\nMerrimack athletics Hall of fame\nThe following is a list of people associated with the Merrimack football program who were elected into the Merrimack college Athletic Hall of Fame (induction date in parentheses)\n* Andrew Jackson (2017)\n* Tony Johnson (2019)\n* Isaiah Voegeli (2023)\nDuane Stadium\nThe warriors play their home games at Duane Stadium located in North Andover Massachusetts (capacity of 4,000).
