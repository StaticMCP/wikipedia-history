From 1999 to June 1, 2020, the PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award for Poetry was awarded by PEN America (formerly PEN American Center) in odd-numbered years in recognition of a book of poetry with \"high literary character\" by a new and emerging American poet of any age with \"the promise of further literary achievement.\" The winner received $5,000. The award was one of many PEN awards sponsored by PEN International affiliates in over 145 PEN centres around the world. It was replaced with an annual PEN/Voelcker Award for Poetry Collection.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award for Poetry winners\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Ref.\n|-\n!1999\n|\n|Some Ether\n|\n|-\n!2001\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2003\n|\n|In the Surgical Theatre\n|\n|-\n!2005\n|\n|Forms of Gone\n|\n|-\n!2007\n|\n|Cut Off the Ears of Winter\n|\n|-\n!2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2011\n|\n|Far District\n|\n|-\n!2013\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2015\n|\n|Prelude to Bruise\n|\n|-\n!2017\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2019\n|\n|stereo(TYPE)\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.pen.org/content/penjoyce-osterweil-award-poetry-5000 PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award for Poetry]"
