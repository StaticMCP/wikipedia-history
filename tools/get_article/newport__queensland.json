In 1986 following a number of burglaries, the NWPOA established a Neighbour-hood Watch program called \"Newport Watch\" to improve community security and social services to canal residents.\nNewport is home to Spinnaker Park, which was voted Australia's Favourite Playground in 2021.\nDemographics\nIn the , Newport had a population of 2,964 people.\nIn the , Newport had a population of 5,964 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Newport.
