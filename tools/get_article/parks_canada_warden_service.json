The modern Law Enforcement Branch and warden law-enforcement specialization were formalized in the 2000s after health and safety audits recommended sidearm carriage for officer safety. Parks Canada publishes national guidance, incident reporting lines, and park-level law enforcement summaries.\nPark-by-park (selected units)\nBelow are park-level summaries with founding/establishment dates, typical warden responsibilities for the unit, typical field/enforcement vehicles and equipment used by wardens in that unit.\nBanff National Park\n*Established: 1885 (Rocky Mountains Park; Canada’s first national park).\n*Warden role locally: Banff has one of the oldest warden presences (original fire & game wardens in the early 1900s).
