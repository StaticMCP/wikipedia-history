It was the sole legal party in the country from 1981 to 1990. Its members are nicknamed \"\" (the tamarinds) in Portuguese, and they identify themselves with the color yellow. Their rivals are the centrist Movement for Democracy, or the wind fans, and the conservative Democratic and Independent Cape Verdean Union.\nHistory\nIn 1956, its forerunner, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), was founded by the Cape Verdean nationalist leader Amílcar Cabral (born in Guinea-Bissau). PAIGC fought to overthrow the Portuguese Empire, unify Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, and use its vanguardism to advance socialist revolution.\nFrom 1961 on, the PAIGC fought a guerrilla warfare campaign in cooperation with its fraternal party umbrella group, the CONCP, during the Portuguese Colonial War. By 1973 the PAIGC controlled Guinea-Bissau, while Portugal's own Carnation Revolution in 1974 effectively dissolved the empire, relinquishing Cape Verde within the next year.\nAfter the wars of national liberation, the PAIGC established a socialist state within both territories under Amilcar Cabral's brother, Luís Cabral.\nEstablishment\nFollowing a military coup in Guinea-Bissau that ousted Cabral in November 1980, the Cape Verde portion of the party became the PAICV in January 1981; it was headed by the President of Cape Verde, Aristides Pereira. The PAICV was Cape Verde's sole legal party from 1981 until the abolition of the one-party state in 1990.\nMultiparty democracy\nAt an extraordinary party congress in February 1990, the PAICV approved the introduction of multiparty democracy. Pereira stepped down as General Secretary of PAICV in July 1990, and Prime Minister Pedro Pires replaced him in August 1990. The PAICV won 23 of the 79 National Assembly seats in the January 1991 multiparty parliamentary election, losing to the Movement for Democracy (MpD). Pereira was subsequently defeated in the February 1991 presidential election, and PAICV again fared poorly in the December 1991 local elections. At a party congress in August 1993, Pires was replaced as General Secretary by Aristides Lima and was instead elected as President of PAICV.\nThe PAICV won 21 out of 72 National Assembly seats in the December 1995 parliamentary election. At a PAICV congress in September 1997, Pires faced José Maria Neves in a leadership contest, and Pires was elected with 68% of the vote. Pires stepped down as PAICV President in 2000 in preparation for a presidential bid in the next year's election and he was succeeded by Neves.\n2001 election\nIn the presidential election held on 11 and 25 February 2001, PAICV candidate Pedro Pires, who won 46.52% of the vote in the first round, narrowly defeated the MpD's Carlos Veiga by a margin of only 12 votes in the run-off.\n2006 election\nIn the parliamentary election held on 22 January 2006, PAICV won 52.28% of the popular vote and 41 out of 72 seats in the National Assembly.\nIn the presidential election held on 12 February 2006, Pedro Pires again narrowly defeated Carlos Veiga, winning 50.98% of the vote.\n2011 election\nIn the parliamentary election held on 7 February 2011, the PAICV led by Jose Maria Neves won 52.68% of the popular vote and 38 out of 72 seats in the National Assembly.\nIn the presidential election held on 7 and 21 August 2011, Manuel Inocêncio Sousa lost to Jorge Carlos Fonseca (MpD) with 32.66% of the votes in the first round and 45.74% in the second round.\n2016 election\nPAICV lost 2016 presidential elections and president Jorge Carlos Fonseca was re-elected with very clear majority of the votes. PAICV even failed to forward a candidate. Before that PAICV had lost the 2016 parliamentary election. The main opposition party Movement for Democracy (MpD) won the parliamentary elections, taking back power after 15 years.\nIdeology and affiliation\nThe PAICV describes itself as democratic socialist but began to trend towards social democracy in the 2010s. The party has been placed as left-wing on the political spectrum.\nThe party is a full member of the Socialist International.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!rowspan=2|Election\n!rowspan=2|Party candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n!rowspan=2|Result\n|-\n!colspan=2|First round\n!colspan=2|Second round\n|-\n|1991\n|Aristides Pereira\n|25,544\n|26.6%\n| –\n| –\n|Lost\n|-\n|1996\n|colspan=6|Did not participate\n|-\n|2001\n|rowspan=2|Pedro Pires\n|61,646\n|46.52%\n|75,827\n|50.00%\n|Elected\n|-\n|2006\n|86,583\n|50.98%\n| –\n| –\n|Elected\n|-\n|2011\n|Manuel Inocêncio Sousa\n|52,612\n|32.66%\n|82,379\n|45.74%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2016\n|colspan=6|Did not participate\n|-\n|2021\n|José Maria Neves\n|96,035\n|51.79%\n| –\n| –\n|Elected\n|}\nNational Assembly elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Party leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Result\n|-\n|1975\n|rowspan=4|Aristides Pereira\n|100,835\n|95.6%\n|}}\n| 56\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1980\n|141,244\n|93.0%\n|}}\n| 7\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1985\n|92,865\n|94.0%\n|}}\n| 20\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1991\n|39,673\n|33.6%\n|}}\n| 60\n| 2nd\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|Pedro Pires\n|45,263\n|29.75%\n|}}\n| 2\n| 2nd\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|rowspan=3|José Maria Neves\n|67,860\n|49.50%\n|}}\n| 19\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|88,965\n|52.28%\n|}}\n| 1\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|117,967\n|52.68%\n|}}\n| 3\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|rowspan=2|Janira Hopffer Almada\n|86,078\n|38.16%\n|}}\n| 9\n| 2nd\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|87,063\n|39.55%\n|}}\n| 1\n| 2nd\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080603220111/http://www.paicv.cv/ Official website ]"
