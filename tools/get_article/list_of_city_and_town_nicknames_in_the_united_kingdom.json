City nicknames can help in establishing a civic identity, helping outsiders recognize a community or attracting people to a community because of its nickname; promote civic pride; and build community unity.\nNicknames and slogans that successfully create a new community \"ideology or myth\" are also believed to have economic value. Their economic value is difficult to measure, but there are anecdotal reports of cities that have achieved substantial economic benefits by \"branding\" themselves by adopting new slogans.\nSome unofficial nicknames are positive, while others are derisive. The unofficial nicknames listed here have been in use for a long time or have gained wide currency.\nA\nis one of the principal materials used in the architecture of Aberdeen, to the extent that it has become known as \"The Granite City\"]]\n*Aberdare\n**\"Swît Byr-dɛ̄r (Gwentian Welsh), Sweet 'Berdare (English)\" – A nickname remembered by the very old in the town, but no longer in general use.
