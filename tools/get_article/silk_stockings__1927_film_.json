On the eve of their wedding anniversary, Sam is forced to stop over at the office to discuss business with some clients. Pressed by his haste to get home as soon as possible, he does not notice that a lady has slipped a silk stocking into his suit pocket which, upon his return, is immediately discovered by Molly. She and George Bagnall, a friend of the family, learn that in another similar case, it ended in divorce. Judge Moore, their mutual friend, thinks it well to teach the two quarrelsome spouses a lesson and suggests that Molly get a divorce. Reluctantly, she agrees to separate from her husband. While the two are at the seaside, visiting friends, the young wife is unable to hide her unhappiness. Moore then tells her that the divorce petition would be immediately rejected if she and her husband were found together in an awkward situation. She then rushes into what she believes to be her husband's room, but instead finds herself in front of George and his fiancée. The situation is resolved with the arrival of Sam who will take his beloved wife in his arms, thus offering her the excuse to retrace his steps.\nCast\n* Laura La Plante as Molly Thornhill\n* John Harron as Sam Thornhill\n* Otis Harlan as Judge Foster\n* William Austin as George Bagnall\n* Marcella Daly as Helen\n* Heinie Conklin as Watchman\n* Burr McIntosh as Judge\n* Tempe Pigott as Mrs. Gower\n* Ruth Cherrington as Dowager\nPreservation\nA print of Silk Stockings is in the George Eastman Museum Motion Picture Collection.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
