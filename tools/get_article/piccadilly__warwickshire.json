It is located near to the larger village of Kingsbury (where population details are included), and is four miles south of Tamworth.\nHistory\nPiccadilly was built in 1904 to house miners who worked at the nearby Kingsbury Colliery, and the village was built on land belonging to the mine. It consisted of two rows of three-storey houses along one main street.\nPiccadilly earned its name from Piccadilly in London, which was the home of Colonel Dibley, one of the village's founders. Dibley asked the miners what they would like to call their new village, but when nobody could think of an appropriate name, he chose Piccadilly.\nIn 1908 a clubhouse was built. It had been turned into a pub named The Jewel in the Crown but this has now been demolished and social housing built.\nThe village remained much the same until 1947 when prefabricated housing was built to house more mineworkers. These were demolished in the early 1960s after which the local authority of the time, Tamworth Rural District Council, used the land to build council houses. These remain to the present day.\nThe mine was closed in 1968 and is now the Kingsbury link Business park.\nMiners Memorial Wall\nIn 2009 a memorial wall was built containing the names of all the miners who worked at Kingsbury Colliery and Dexter Colliery. In the center of the wall there is a miner's lamp that is always lit to commemorate those who have died and those who remember working down the mines.\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2001 Census the population of the Hurley and Wood End ward was 3,642.
