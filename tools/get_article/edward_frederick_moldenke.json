By 1888, he was pastor of St. Peter's German Lutheran Church in New York City.\nHe died in Watchung, New Jersey on 25 June 1904, shortly after 20 of his parishioners were killed in the sinking of the PS General Slocum.\nLiterary work\nIn 1865 he was editor of the Gemeindeblatt at Watertown, Wisconsin.
