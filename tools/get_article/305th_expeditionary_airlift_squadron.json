It is assigned to Air Mobility Command, and operates from New Castle Air National Guard Base, Delaware.\nMission\nAttached to the 89th Airlift Wing at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, the squadron operates from New Castle Air National Guard Base, Delaware with approximately eight aircrews, 60 maintenance personnel, and about a dozen operations personnel supporting five Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft.  The squadron supports presidential airlift, through a mission known as \"Banner Express\".  Aircraft and personnel are prepositioned to support an expected surge in airlift requirements.\nThe squadron was expected to commence operations in April 2012 and inactivate in late November.\nHistory\nWorld War II\nThe squadron was first activated with Douglas C-47 Skytrains in September 1943 as the 305th Troop Carrier Squadron at Sedalia Army Air Field, Missouri and trained under I Troop Carrier Command.   It trained in various parts of the eastern United States until early 1944.  The unit then deployed to England, where it became part of IX Troop Carrier Command.\nThe squadron prepared for the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe. It began operations by dropping paratroops of the 101st Airborne Division in Normandy on D-Day (6 June 1944) and releasing gliders with reinforcements on the following day. The unit received a Distinguished Unit Citation and a French citation for these missions.  After the Normandy invasion the squadron ferried supplies in the United Kingdom.\nAfter moving to France in September, the unit dropped paratroops of the 82nd Airborne Division near Nijmegen and towed gliders carrying reinforcements during Operation Market Garden, the airborne attack on the Netherlands. In December, it participated in the Battle of the Bulge by releasing gliders with supplies for the 101st Airborne Division near Bastogne.\nWhen the Allies made the air assault across the Rhine River in March 1945, each aircraft towed two gliders with troops of the 17th Airborne Division and released them near Wesel. The squadron also hauled food, clothing, medicine, gasoline, ordnance equipment, and other supplies to the front lines and evacuated patients to rear zone hospitals. It converted from C-47s to Curtiss C-46 Commandos and used the new aircraft to transport displaced persons from Germany to France and Belgium after V-E Day.  It was inactivated in Germany in September 1946.\nAir Force reserve operations\nPostwar, the squadron was activated in the Air Force reserve in 1949 at Fairfax Field, Kansas.  At Fairfax, it again operated C-46 Commandos. The squadron was called to active duty during the Korean War in 1951, and its aircraft and personnel were used as fillers other units and the squadron was inactivated.   The squadron was again activated in the reserve in 1952 at Olathe Naval Air Station.  The unit moved to nearby Grandview Air Force Base in 1955, but was inactivated shortly thereafter.    It was activated again at Tinker Air Force Base. Oklahoma in 1957 and conducted routine reserve training operating Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs flying worldwide transport missions beginning in 1961.  The squadron was again called to active duty in 1961 due to the Berlin Crisis of 1961.  The 305th returned to reserve service in the late summer of 1962.  It was inactivated with the retirement of the C-124 on 20 May 1972.\nOperations and decorations\n* Combat Operations.
