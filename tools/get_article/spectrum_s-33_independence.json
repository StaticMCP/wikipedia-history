FAA and JAA Type Certifications of the S-33 Independence were expected to be completed in 2009, but were not. The company has provided no press releases to explain the long delay in gaining certification.\nThe aircraft was reported to be able to accommodate 5–6 passenger seats, a full-sized private lavatory, and will have a maximum take-off weight of 7,300&nbsp;lb., with a range of over 2,000 miles.\nThe retail sales price of the aircraft, which is equipped with Williams FJ-33 engines was supposed to be US-$3.95 million. The aircraft was to be released about 12 months after the bigger S-40 \"Freedom\". In May 2011 Spectrum president Austin Blue said, \"We are still trying to get the programs advancing, but it is not easy\".\nAccident\nThe only completed S-33, registration N322LA, crashed in a test flight on July 25, 2006 in Spanish Fork, Utah, killing the two test pilots aboard, Glenn Maben and Nathan Forrest. The aircraft rolled right immediately after takeoff, reaching a 90-degree angle before the wingtip struck the ground. The preliminary NTSB report revealed that the control linkage had been connected backward during maintenance after the previous flight, resulting in opposite control output (a left roll input on the control stick resulting in the aircraft rolling right).\nSpecifications\n|eng1 type=turbofan engines\n|eng1 number=2\n|eng1 kn=6.68\n|max speed kts= 425\n|range nmi= 1600-2000\n|range mi= 1830-2280\n|range km= 2960-3700\n|ceiling ft= 45000\n|ceiling m=\n}}\nSee also\n* Spectrum S-40 Freedom\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.spectrum.aero/ Spectrum Aeronautical]"
