He was a J.P. for Wiltshire by 1583. From 1594 to 1595 he was High Sheriff of Wiltshire. He was an extensive landowner when he succeeded to the estates of his half-brother Sir Walter Hungerford (Knight of Farley) in about 1596. In 1598 he became collector for the loan.  He supplied a light horse for Ireland in 1600 and 1601.\nAfter the rebellion of the Earl of Essex, he was given custody of his relative William, Lord Sandys. He was knighted in 1601, and elected Member of Parliament for Wiltshire.\nIn 1602, he purchased the manor of Corsham, and in 1604 was granted further manors in Berkshire, Cornwall, Somerset and Wiltshire which had formerly belonged to his father (whose lands had been forfeited along with his life when he was found guilty of being a traitor). Hungerford made his will on 1 December 1607, and died four days later.\nFamily\nHungerford married firstly, after 1574, Jane, daughter of Anthony Hungerford of Down Ampney, Gloucestershire and widow of William Forster of Aldermaston, Berkshire; and secondly Cecily Tufton (d. 1653), daughter of Sir John Tufton, of Hothfield, Kent, but died without issue. His widow married Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
