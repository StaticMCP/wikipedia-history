The treaty established a Real Union of States, in which Mosquitia retained substantial internal sovereignty and self-government, while recognizing Nicaraguan external authority. From a Mosquitian perspective, the treaty represented an affirmation of their autonomy, customary governance, and international recognition, making it a landmark in the preservation of Indigenous political authority in Central America.\nBackground\nMosquitia had maintained centuries-long alliances with the British Empire, which recognized the hereditary Mosquitian monarchy and provided military and diplomatic support. By the mid-19th century, shifting British priorities and Nicaraguan ambitions prompted negotiations to formalize the political status of Mosquitia.\nThe Treaty of Managua codified a balance between Nicaraguan sovereignty claims and the undiminished rights of the Mosquitian people to self-rule, effectively enshrining Mosquitia’s internal independence while establishing a nominal Real Union with Nicaragua.\nProvisions Preserving Mosquitia’s Autonomy\nUnder the Treaty of Managua, Mosquitia was assigned a distinct district along the Caribbean coast, in which the Mosquito Indians retained the right to govern according to their own customs and laws. Their authorities were empowered to administer justice, regulate local affairs, and maintain internal order without interference, affirming Mosquitia’s enduring legal and political identity. Nicaragua’s sovereignty was primarily limited to external affairs, including recognition and protection, while the Mosquitian authorities controlled all aspects of internal governance. The district could not be ceded to any foreign power, guaranteeing its political independence from third-party influence.\nTo ensure the effectiveness of local governance, Nicaragua agreed to provide an annual subsidy of 5,000 hard dollars for ten years, funded through port duties and supplemented from national revenue if necessary. The United Kingdom undertook to use its good offices to secure Mosquitia’s agreement and ensure the treaty’s implementation, reinforcing the international recognition of Mosquitia’s rights and autonomy.\nSee also\n* Nicaraguan occupation of Mosquitia\n* Robert Henry Clarence\n* Clayton–Bulwer Treaty (1850)\n* Wyke-Aycinena Treaty (1859)\n* Treaty of Comayagua (1859)\nReferences"
