It took place on July 20, 1866, near the island of Vis (then Lissa) off the coast of Dalmatia, which is now part of Croatia. This battle was the first naval engagement in which newly developed ironclad warships were used on a significant scale. Both naval forces at Lissa exhibited notable technical deficiencies, while the Italian Navy also suffered from severe rivalries within its command staff. The Imperial Austrian Navy secured a victory by employing ramming tactics.\nBackground\nIn order to seize the last areas of the Apennine Peninsula that were still in the hands of the Habsburg Empire, the then Kingdom of Italy entered into an alliance with Prussia. War broke out between Prussia and Austria in mid-June 1866. Italy also declared war on Austria and had its troops march into Veneto. Although the Italian army outnumbered the Austrians, it was defeated at Custoza on June 24 and forced to retreat.\nShortly before the Italians were ready to resume the offensive, Napoleon III telegraphed on the night of July 4 that Austria had offered to cede Veneto to him on the basis of an armistice in order to return it to Italy. However, Napoleon III's own plans were thwarted by the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Königgrätz. The emperor's telegram was followed three days later by the threat that he would return Venice to Austria if the armistice was rejected and perhaps enter into an alliance with it. This put the Italians in a terrible dilemma. Risking a break with France was too great a risk.\nThe Italians replied to the Emperor that they could not conclude an armistice without Prussian consent and made acceptance conditional on the immediate surrender of the Venetian fortresses and French support for their claims to Trieste. In the meantime, Italy wanted to use the time to occupy Istria and later use it as a bargaining chip in the peace negotiations.\nPrelude\nAdmiral Persano had already been instructed on June 10, 1866 to clear the Adriatic of enemy warships and merchant ships and to make Ancona an operational base in the Adriatic, but not to attack Trieste and Venice for the time being. After Austria officially declared war on Italy on June 20, the Italians initially planned to occupy the Austrian coastal land on the Adriatic. After von Tegetthoff was informed of the declaration of war, he immediately took the necessary measures to take offensive action against the enemy fleet when a favorable opportunity arose. In order to obtain information about the strength and movements of the Italians, von Tegetthoff sent the steamer Stadium on the same day to reconnoitre the coast from Ancona to Bari. On June 23, the Stadium returned with the news that no enemy warships had been sighted.\nAssuming that the Italians had only assembled part of their fleet in the roadstead at Ancona, the rear admiral quickly decided to undertake a reconnaissance voyage from Fasana to Ancona. On June 24, von Tegetthoff asked Archduke Albrecht whether he would be permitted to take the offensive and carry out reconnaissance missions on the Italian coast. In the meantime, von Tegetthoff had held a council of war with all the ship commanders and weighed up the chances of an operation against Ancona and a possible attack on the Italian ships anchored there. The Archduke's reply arrived on June 26 and was as follows: No obstacle in the way of the free action of the escadre, only not beyond Lissa; keep an eye on the mouths of the Po and the coast of Venice. With the approval of the High Command, von Tegetthoff set sail from Fasana on the evening of June 26 with the armored frigate Archduke Ferdinand Max.\nAfter the Italian coast came into sight at dawn, the Austrians set course for Monte Conero. At around 4:00&nbsp;a.m., the lookout on the Archduke Ferdinand Max sighted smoke in the direction of the course. Soon afterwards, at around 4:20&nbsp;a.m., a steamer was sighted by the Elisabeth. The Elisabeth was immediately ordered to reconnoitre. When the Elisabeth had approached the foreign steamer to within about , the ship - the Radaviso Esploratore under the command of Marchese di Orengo - hoisted the Italian flag. This was answered by the Elisabeth by hoisting her own flag and firing a few shots, whereupon the Esploratore immediately turned and headed for Ancona.\nThe Elisabeth tried to cut off the Italian ship, but the Esploratore soon got out of range due to her greater speed. At 5:30&nbsp;a.m. she was about  from Ancona. Contrary to expectations, the enemy fleet was almost completely anchored on the Rede. The Italians, alerted by the Esploratore, then set off. At around 6:30&nbsp;a.m., four armored ships approached Monte Conero in their wake, followed at intervals by other Italian ships. Several wooden ships formed a second wave between the armored ships.\nDue to the superiority of the proximity of the shore batteries and a possible naval mine belt, Rear Admiral von Tegetthoff decided to retreat to Fasana at 7:30&nbsp;a.m.Admiral Persano cruised the latitude of Lissa from July 9 to 11, but without taking any action against the Austrians. His passive behavior was increasingly criticized and the Minister of the Navy ordered him to finally take some kind of promising action. It was therefore decided to occupy the island of Lissa. The aim was to create a maritime base of operations so that the Italian land force could later land in Dalmatia relatively safely.\nOpposing fleets\nItaly\nThe  and the  were both built in New York. They had a displacement of  each,  thick armour and were equipped with powerful artillery. However, they were not good seagoing vessels as they lacked buoyancy and maneuverability, and their rudders were unprotected. Italy also had the  , a turret ship built in Great Britain in 1866. The ship had  armor and was equipped with two 300-pounder Armstrong guns and an 26&nbsp;ft-long ramming spur. According to an article in the London Times, it was capable of destroying the Austrian fleet single-handedly if necessary.\nHowever, the Affondatore also had serious design flaws. The  , the , the  , the  and the   were also armored and had a continuous armored belt on the waterline. The two smaller ironclads  and , each with a displacement of , were built in France. They had  thick armor and were equipped with  guns. Two armored gunboats, the  and the , each carried two Armstrong 150-pounders and several smaller guns.\nBehind these twelve ships, which formed the first line of the Italian fleet, were nine wooden frigates and corvettes with steam propulsion, but of the older type that armor had made obsolete. Dissatisfied with the state of his fleet, Persano repeatedly pointed out a number of deficiencies to the responsible naval minister, General Diego Angioletti. Persano estimated that he would need at least another month to get the fleet into fighting condition. On June 20, Angioletti was replaced by Agostino Depretis, who ordered Persano to sail immediately and assemble the fleet at Ancona.\nAustria\nThe Austrians had the ironclads , , , , , , and . Each had  thick armor) and a large number of obsolete muzzle-loading guns at their disposal. In addition, the fleet consisted of the ship-of-the-line  with ninety-one guns, the frigates  ,  ,  , , and , as well as ten gunboats (Narenta, Kerka, Hum, Vellebich, Dalmat, Seehund, Wal, Streiter, Reka, Andreas Hofer, Kaiserin Elisabeth, Greif, and Stadion).\nAfter the naval battle at Heligoland in the German-Danish War, Rear Admiral Wilhelm Freiherr von Tegetthoff, who was extremely popular with his subordinates, was considered one of the most experienced and creative naval commanders in Europe, especially when it came to compensating for the Austrian fleet's lack of combat power via emergency solutions.\nBattle\nLissa\nThe island of Lissa is located in the middle of the Adriatic Sea about 34 miles from the Croatian coast and 80 miles from the Italian coast. The island has several bays and harbors, which were equipped with batteries for defense. On the north-eastern side is Vis with the port of San Giorgio. To the south are the bays of Carober, Gradac, Portochiave and Travna. On the south-eastern side: the bays of Milna and Ruda and the port of Manego. After Austria came into possession of the island of Lissa in 1815, the existing fortifications were strengthened and new works added. At that time, 1,833 Austrian soldiers under the command of Colonel David Freiherr von Urs de Margina and around 100 cannons were available for the defense of the rugged and densely wooded island. There was also a police station on the 639 yd-high hill of Hum, which was in telegraphic contact with the Dalmatian mainland via the neighboring island of Hvar.\nOrder of Battle\nRear Admiral von Tegetthoff was not entirely free in his choice of attack formation. The planned attack required the armored division to form the vanguard and to simultaneously adopt a formation that enabled it to steam full speed at the enemy. However, since the Austrian ships did not all achieve the same speed, he decided against the line-ahead formation. In this formation, there was a risk that the faster ships might collide with the slower ones when breaking out of the line. For this reason, and to ensure optimal utilization of his combat strength, he opted for a wedge formation.\nAdmiral Persano divided his armored ships into three divisions. The first division, under Rear Admiral Giovanni Vacca, consisted of the Principe di Carignano, the Castelfidardo, and the Ancona. The second division, under Admiral Persano himself, included the Re d’Italia, the Palestro, and the San Martino. Finally, the third division, under Captain Riboty, comprised the Re di Portogallo, the Varese, the Maria Pia, the Terribile, and the Formidabile. Rear Admiral Giovanni Battista Albini’s squadron consisted of four frigates, one corvette, five scouts, three gunboats, a hospital ship, and two troop transports.\nAttack\nAdmiral Persano set sail on the afternoon of July 16. The fleet initially took a north-easterly course in order to conceal the target. During the night of July 16–17, the Messaggero, sailing under a (false) British flag with Chief of Staff d'Amico on board, approached the coast to reconnoitre the positions of the coastal batteries and fortresses. Persano's plan was to bombard San Georgio with most of his fleet, destroy the Komiža forts with a smaller detachment so that a later arriving force could land there, and land the expeditionary force he had with him at Manego.\nThe gunboats were sent to Hvar to cut the telegraph cable to Lissa and destroy any boats that could transmit information to the mainland. One scout was sent to cross between the islands of Palagruža and Svetac, another to Punta Planca on the mainland. This division exposed the Italians to the risk of being destroyed by locally superior Austrian units. Moreover, so much time had been lost in issuing orders that should have been given before the fleet left that the Italians did not reach their position until after 10 a.m. on July 18. Thanks to this delay, the Austrians had had enough time to telegraph the arrival of the Italians to Tegetthoff. At 10:30 Persano gave the order to attack.\nThe first division under Rear Admiral Vacca approached the batteries at Komiža under fire up to 1,600 yards and then opened fire on the Austrian positions. However, at up to 273 yards above sea level, the coastal batteries were too high for the Italian guns. Consequently, after a few hours of useless shelling, Vacca decided to drive to Manego and support Rear Admiral Albini. Albini, who had received orders to destroy the batteries at Nadpostranje and land troops in the bay of Rukavac, reached his position at around 11:15. Shortly afterwards, the Austrian cannons opened fire on the approaching Italians.\nAlbini was faced with the same problem as Rear Admiral Vacca and also decided to cease firing. Albini then sent the corvette San Giovanni to San Giorgio to ask Persano for further orders. After Vacca had reached Manego at around 14:00, Albini informed him of the situation, whereupon Vacca decided to continue on to San Giorgio. Meanwhile, Admiral Persano had approached San Giorgio from the north and Captain Riboty from the south. While Persano intended to attack Fort George, Riboty was to attack Fort Wellington. After most of Fort George's guns had been silenced by 15:00, Persano ordered the Maria Pia and the San Martino to enter the harbor at 16:00 and destroy the inner gun batteries.\nAs the two Italian ships entered the harbor, they came under fire from both the eastern guns of Fort Wellington and the inner gun batteries. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Vacca had appeared at about 16:45 and had received immediate orders to support Riboty in his attack on Fort Wellington. By 17:00, Fort George had ceased firing after half of its guns had been destroyed and a fifth of its soldiers had fallen. Only Fort Wellington was still resisting. In this situation, Persano decided to break off the battle and allow his men to rest.\nDuring the night of July 19, Persano received the news that von Tegetthoff had been informed of the attack. However, Admiral Persano decided to continue the attack, as he expected that if von Tegetthoff had indeed sailed, he would not arrive before the evening of July 19. The Austrians worked throughout the night to repair the damage caused by the Italians and restore their defensive capabilities. At dawn, the Affondatore arrived with the frigates Carlo Alberto and Principe Umber, bringing a further 2,600 men with them. The two ships Terribile and Varese were ordered to attack Komiža, while Albini was to cover the disembarkation of the troops.\nAt the same time, the Formidabile, supported by the three ships from Vacca, was to enter the port of San Giorgio, while Persano himself wanted to attack the outer fortresses again. The Austrian fortifications again withstood the bombardment and the Italian divisional commanders proved too timid to land the troops. By 20:00, the Italian fleet had again broken off the attack and retreated  north of San Georgio. After receiving further telegrams from Lesina about the presence and activities of the Italian fleet, Tegetthoff decided to leave his safe position in the northern Adriatic with his escadre immediately in order to relieve the hard-pressed garrison on Lissa. The entire Austrian fleet, three divisions, sailed out of the Fažana Channel at around 13:30 on July 19 and headed south at full steam.\nVon Tegetthoff had formulated his instructions for the attack precisely. The Panzerschiff-Abteilung was to break through the Italian line, ram their ships and concentrate their fire. The wooden ships were to attack one or other wing of the enemy line or be deployed as they saw fit. The gunboats were to split into three groups and support the wooden ships in their action.\nThe Italians were sighted at 06:40 on the morning of July 20. Shortly after 9:00&nbsp;a.m., the order “prepare for battle” was given. This was followed by the signals “close up” and “full speed” and finally at 10:35&nbsp;a.m. to the armored ships: “attack and sink the enemy”. After the Italians had sighted the Austrians, Persano gave a number of signals.\nFirst he ordered the Terribile and the Varese to join him, then he had his own ships and those of Vacca deploy in line of bearing to the northwest. He gave Albini the signal to leave the boats and men ashore and at the same time ordered him to position his wooden ships behind the armored line. When he realized a few minutes later that his line was pointing in the wrong direction, Persano gave the signals: “Steer northeast for one minute”, then “Close up” and “Attack the enemy”.\nThe ironclads were very slow to reach their positions and Re di Portogallo and Castelfidardo reported engine failures. After some repairs, they finally took their places. The Formidabile immediately steamed off to Ancona after signaling to Persano that he could not fight. Shortly after the Italians had formed up, Persano changed his mind and ordered a keel line formation to be formed. First came the Carignano, then the Castelfidardo and the Ancona, which formed the vanguard. They were followed by the ''Re d'Italia, the Affondatore, the Palestro, the San Martino in the center and, in the rear, the Ribotti, the Re di Portogallo and the Maria Pia. The Terribile and the Varese were still several nautical miles away to the south, so that the entire line covered a space of .\nAt around 10:00, Persano decided that he needed a fast, maneuverable ship to monitor the fighting outside the battle line. Since the Re d' Italia was neither fast nor maneuverable, he decided to switch to the Affondatore. Unfortunately, the Affondatore ''only had a vice admiral's flag, not an admiral's flag, and no signal was sent to the rest of the fleet announcing this change. The stopping of the Re d'Italia also created a significant gap in the line of Italian armored ships. The Italian armored line was therefore only closed at the front. In the center, the ''Re d'Italia was isolated, and at the end, the gaps between the ships were much wider than they should have been according to the order.\nVon Tegetthoff recognized his chance and broke through the enemy line between the Re d'Italia and the Ancona ''at 10:50. The Austrians engaged in an exchange of fire with Vacca's division, but the Italian shells missed the Austrian ships due to the heavy swell. Whether because of the smoke from their own guns or because the Italians had maneuvered well, the Austrians were unable to ram any Italian ships during this first attack. After the Austrians had passed the gap, Vacca had broken off to port with his three ships to attack the weaker Austrian rearguard.\nHowever, he executed the movement very slowly, so that the rearguard had pushed through the gap before Vacca had completed his turn. Led by the Kaiser, the Novara, the Friedrich Max, the Radetzky, the Adriatic, the Schwarzenberg and the Donau now sailed south to attack the Italian wooden ships. The Kaiser was initially confronted by the Affondatore, which opened fire on the Kaiser, killing six men and causing minor damage. The Kaiser returned fire and after the other Austrian ships also concentrated their fire on the Affondatore, the ship withdrew to the west. Shortly afterwards, Ribotti's division, reinforced by the Varese, opened fire on the Kaiser.\nThe Portogallo then came into view off the port bow and Commodore Petz was determined to ram it despite his wooden ship. Petz dropped slightly to starboard and with a sharp turn to port he managed to hit his opponent abeam. The Kaiser grazed along the side of the Portogallo, shattering part of its armor, the crane beams, tearing all the port side port portlights and the shrouds of the foremast in two. The Kaiser itself suffered equally severe damage. The bowsprit and the stay were torn away and the foremast crashed over the side onto the funnel. Despite her condition and the Italian gunfire, the Kaiser was able to fire at least two concentrated broadsides at close range, causing so much damage above and below the waterline that the Portogallo subsequently drifted away and was lost in the smoke of battle.\nIn the meantime, von Tegetthoff had attacked Persano's division. The entire seven Austrian armored ships had concentrated on the ''Re d'Italia, the Palestro and the San Martino''. The battle had now developed into a dense mêlée that allowed each combatant only a brief glimpse of the other. The Austrian ships were painted black, while the Italians were painted light gray. In addition, the Austrians had painted the funnels of the ships different colors so that they could easily identify their own armored ships. Tegetthoff's order was clear: Ram everything that is gray!. The hard-pressed Italian center was now attacked from the front, flanks and rear. The Palestro and the San Martino were covered with massive gunfire, whereupon they withdrew to the north and south-west after several hits.\nWhile the Kaiser, badly battered, with her rigging on fire and many gunners killed or wounded, sailed on, the Affondatore emerged from the smoke, steaming on a course that crossed that of the Kaiser at right angles. The Affondatore approached as if to ram the ship. When the collision was imminent, Persano suddenly gave the order to take evasive action and spare the ship. Perhaps he feared that his ramming spike would get caught in the hull of the Kaiser and his own ship would go down with the enemy. Meanwhile, the battle reached its climax. As the Austrians approached the now encircled ''Re d 'Italia, a ship actually hit her sternpost and tore away the rudder, rendering her virtually helpless.\nIn this extremely critical situation, von Tegetthoff ordered the Ferdinand Max to ram the ship at full speed. The Re d Italia heeled heavily to starboard when she was hit. The ship immediately began to fill up and sank within just three minutes. While von Tegetthoff attempted to launch some boats to rescue the Italians, the ships of the vanguard and rearguard arrived, whereupon von Tegetthoff withdrew. The loss of the Re d'Italia and the withdrawal of the Palestro reduced the Italian armored squadron to nine ships. Nevertheless, Persano was determined to continue the fighting. The Ancona and the Varese ''were preparing for a new attack on Petz's division when they collided and remained wedged together for several minutes. During these minutes, the Austrians were able to gain an advantage and escape. The losses aboard the Kaiser were heavy.\nOne of the Affondatore's 300-pound shells had hit the hull of the ship, killing or wounding twenty men. In total, she had suffered twenty-four dead and seventy-five wounded. But the Kaiser was not yet safe. The Maria Pia had now appeared and opened fire from a distance of 874 yards. The Kaiser tried to return fire, but many of the guns were disabled, while the fire spread through the rigging to the entire ship. The steam ran out and the steering gear was damaged. The other wooden ships had also been badly damaged. One ship was only kept afloat by the pumps, another was on fire, and the crew of the guns on another had been decimated. Petz withdrew his division from the operation and headed for San Georgio. Nevertheless, the Kaiser had proven that even a wooden ship could attack an ironclad and escape destruction.\nBy 12:20&nbsp;p.m., the two fleets had separated and the Austrian ironclads moved toward San Georgio in support of their unarmored ships. After his fleet had regrouped, the Austrian admiral formed them into three columns to the northeast, between the Italian armored ships and the land, his own armored ship column seaward. Halfway through, when the gun smoke had cleared, Persano saw that Albini's division was still on the coast, while his armored ships were in column to the west. Persano then gave the signal for general pursuit. However, as his captains did not know that Persano was on the Affondatore, they paid no attention to the signals.\nPersano was now obviously losing track of the battle, as he repeatedly sent out contradictory flag signals such as: The fleet should chase the enemy. The commander wants the orders given to be carried out quickly, any ship that is not fighting is not at its post. He then learned by signals that the Re d'Italia had sunk, the Palestro was doomed by fire and the San Martino was almost incapable of fighting. Together with his wooden ships and the Terrible, Persano put his column in the lead and steamed west. The two fleets watched each other until nightfall, with the Italians zigzagging but keeping a respectful distance from von Tegetthoff. At dusk, Persano set course for Ancona and von Tegetthoff for Pola.\nAftermath\nThat same evening, von Tegetthoff sent a telegram to Vienna:\n\"This morning near Lissa, encountered the enemy fleet. After a two-hour battle, drove the enemy away. Lissa relieved.\"\nThe decisive factors in the Italian defeat were the scattered starting positions of their ships during the landing operations, the disorganized command caused by disputes and misunderstandings, Persano's change of flagship, the gap in their formation that this caused, and the hesitant counterattack after the Austrians had breached the gap. The Austrian fleet was able to win the battle because orders were issued without delay, the battle plan was well-prepared and carefully thought out, and, above all, their crews were exceptionally well-trained. A significant part of the success was also due to Tegetthoff's determined and unconventional approach.\nThe Battle of Lissa was the first naval engagement in European warfare to feature the use of ironclad warships. However, too much emphasis was placed on ramming tactics during the battle. The Austrians attacked a fleet that was completely disorganized, giving them the best opportunities to employ the ram. Even so, they succeeded in sinking only one ship using this weapon. With the development of even more powerful and longer-range cannons, which could sink ships before they came close enough to ram, this tactic soon became obsolete. While the Italians had a numerically superior and technically more advanced fleet compared to the Austrians, they were unable to capitalize on this advantage.\nFor Italy, the defeat was a national tragedy. Admiral Persano was removed from his post and dishonorably dismissed from naval service. Tegetthoff, on the other hand, was promoted to Vice Admiral by Emperor Franz Joseph – practically on the battlefield – for his efforts. Shortly thereafter, he was also awarded the Maria Theresa Order with Commanders' Cross. In Vienna and numerous other cities of the empire, he was declared an honorary citizen. Additionally, a congratulatory letter from his former superior, Ferdinand Maximilian, now Emperor of Mexico, reached him. The postmaster of Lesina, Bräuer, was also decorated for his services, and the local priest, Plancic, was gifted a valuable monstrance for his church.\nThe Italians recorded 700 dead and wounded and 19 prisoners. The Austrians suffered a total of 176 men wounded and killed. Some foreign newspapers incorrectly reported that the liner SMS Kaiser had also been sunk. Several ironclads from both parties were slightly damaged. The badly damaged Affondatore sank off Ancona three days later.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20010505053119/http://www.geocities.com/tegetthoff66/vis.html  The Battle of Vis]\n*  [http://www.marina.difesa.it/storiacultura/storia/almanacco/Pagine/ABCD/affondatore.aspx Page of the Italian Navy official site on Affondatore]\n*  [http://www.marina.difesa.it/storiacultura/storia/storianavale/Pagine/lissa.aspx Page of the Italian Navy official site on battle of Lissa]"
