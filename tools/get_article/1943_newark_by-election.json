The by-election was held due to the succession to the peerage of the incumbent Conservative MP, William Cavendish-Bentinck.  It was won by the Conservative candidate Sidney Shephard.\nCandidates\n49 year-old Sidney Shephard was chosen as the Conservative candidate. He was High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire. He also commanded the Newark Home Guard Battalion.\nAt the outbreak of war, the Conservative, Liberal and Labour parties had agreed an electoral truce which meant that when a by-election occurred, the party that was defending the seat would not be opposed by an official candidate from the other two parties. When the Labour and Liberal parties joined the Coalition government, it was agreed that any by-election candidate defending a government seat would receive a letter of endorsement jointly signed by all the party leaders.\nAlan Dawrant, known to have progressive leanings, stood as an Independent. He was the brother-in-law of Denis Kendall, the recently elected Independent MP for Grantham. 40 year-old solicitor Flight-Lieutenant Edward Moeran, who had served in Gibraltar, was the Common Wealth party candidate. 55 year-old Liberal, John Thomas Pepper also stood. He was the prospective Liberal candidate for neighbouring Melton and Chairman of Nottingham East Liberals.\nCampaign\nThe three anti-Tory candidates spent much time attacking each other. The Dawrant campaign was belatedly able to establish its candidate as the main challenger to the Conservative, with the support of Independent MPs Kendall, George Reakes and his election agent William Brown, along with the Liberal MPs Clement Davies and Tom Horabin.\nResult\nThe Conservative Party held the seat with an increased majority.\nSee also\n*2014 Newark by-election\nReferences"
