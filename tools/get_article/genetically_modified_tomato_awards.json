The first Genetically Modified Tomato Awards were given in 2005 by Lambda Istanbul, and it is currently given by the Istanbul Pride Committee. The title of the award comes from sports commentator Erman Toroğlu, who infamously said that the \"genetically modified tomatoes are turning people gay\".\nDue to COVID-19 regulations, 2020 award ceremony was planned to be livestreamed on YouTube, but it was later removed for \"Violation of Terms of Service\", then later held on Zoom.\nWinners\n2005\n* Lifetime Genetically Modified Tomato -
