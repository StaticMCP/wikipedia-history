It was created on 20 July 2010, during the Second presidency of Alan García. It replaced the National Institute of Culture (, INC), with Juan Ossio Acuña serving as its inaugural minister after his appointment on 4 September 2010.\n, the culture minister is\nHistory\nHouse of Culture of Peru\nThe House of Culture of Peru () was created under the government of Ricardo Pérez Godoy in 1962. The following year, Supreme Decree 48 established its headquarters at the Casa de Pilatos, in the historic centre of Lima, which were inaugurated on 24 July after being restored by architect .\nThe same year, president Nicolás Lindley López created the National Commission of Culture (, CNC), which was overseen and directed by the head of the House of Culture. In 1965, the CNC was dissolved and the National System for the Promotion of Culture () was created to absorb all cultural institutions of the Peruvian State, being composed of the Consejo Superior de Fomento de la Cultura, the Casa de la Cultura del Perú, and the houses of culture for each department. The first was formed by the minister of education, a number of cultural directors (those of the National Archive, the National Library, the House of Culture, the National Conservatory of Music, and the National Superior Autonomous School of Fine Arts), and delegates from universities.\nAll state museums, the National Symphony Orchestra, the National Archaeology Board, and the National Theatre were directly dependent on the House of Culture of Peru, which also had an important bibliography, including the Cultura y pueblo magazine (1964–1970), the Revista peruana de cultura (Lima, 1963–1970), and the Boletín informativo de la Casa de la Cultura del Perú (1964–1969).\nNational Institute of Culture\nThe National Institute of Culture () was created on 9 March 1971, by the Revolutionary Government as a decentralized public body of the education sector through Supreme Decree 18799, replacing the House of Culture of Peru. The INC's functions were to formulate and execute the policies and strategies of the state in regards to cultural development, cultural conservation, and the diffusion and investigation of affairs related to the country's cultural heritage. The Regulations of the Organization and Functions of the INC were defined by Supreme Decree 027-2001-ED of 20 April 2001.\nThe INC continued to be based at its predecessor's headquarters until 1996, when it was replaced by the Constitutional Court of Peru. Due to this, it moved to San Borja District, next to the Museo de la Nación. It had a theatre called the National Theatre of the INC, which was renamed the Grand National Theatre of Peru in 2011. It also published the report Política cultural del Perú, which was printed by UNESCO.\nIn 1992, the Fund for Culture and the Arts was created by the institute. In 1998, minister  announced that the INC would become the National Institute of Cultural Heritage (), but this never came to pass.\nIn 2001, government of Alejandro Toledo created the National Commission of Culture (, chaired by artist and social activist Víctor Delfín and writer and scientist Jose-Carlos Mariátegui (Executive Director). This commission was tasked with preparing the Cultural Policy Guidelines, which outlined the need for the creation of a Ministry of Culture. However, despite repeated public promises during his term, Toledo did not legally formalise its creation, and it was deactivated in 2003.\nIn mid-2002, it was integrated into the Executive Branch. In 2004, the INC collaborated with IBM to improve its asset registration system. In 2006, a weekly publication focusing on the country's relevant contributions was launched, known as the Gaceta Cultural del Perú.\nThe ministry was officially dissolved on 1 October 2010, by Supreme Decree 001-2010-MC, being incorporated into the newly-formed ministry three months after its establishment.\nThroughout its history, the INC was headed by the following:\n*Directors-general:\n**Miguel Oviedo Chamorro (1971–1972)\n**Martha Hildebrandt Pérez-Treviño (1972–1976)\n**Jorge Cornejo Polar (1976–1978)\n**Francisco Abril de Vivero (1978–1980)\n**Ricardo Roca Rey (1980–1981)\n**Luis Enrique Tord Romero (1982–1983)\n**José del Busto Duthurburu (1983–1984)\n**Carlos Ernesto Saavedra Sánchez (1984)\n** (1984–1985)\n**Fernando Silva Santisteban (1985–1987)\n**Germán Peralta Rivera (1987–1989)\n** (1989–1990)\n**Elías Mújica Barreda (1990)\n**Pedro Gjurinovic Canevaro (1990–1996)\n**Juan Guillermo Carpio Muñoz (1996)\n**Luis Arista Montoya (1996–1999)\n**Luis Repetto Málaga (1999–2000)\n**Luis Enrique Tord Romero (2000–2001)\n**Leonor Cisneros Velarde (2001)\n**Luis Guillermo Lumbreras Salcedo (2002–2006)\n** (2006–2010)\n*Executive directors:\n** (1973–1974)\n**Rodolfo Loayza Saavedra\n**César Urueta Alcántara (1985–1986)\n**Laura Bozzo Rotondo (1989–1990)\n**Ricardo Rivera Martínez\n**Flor de María Valladolid Illescas\n**Gustavo Benza Pfucker (1999–2000)\n**Eduardo Antonio Mazzini Otero (2000–2001)\n**María Elena Córdova Burga (2001–2002)\n**Alejandro Falconi (2002–2006)\nMinistry of Culture\nDuring the Second presidency of Alan García, several bills were introduced in Congress with the aim of creating a Ministry of Culture, eventually being approved. The ministry was formally created through Law 29565 of 2010.\nOn 12 June 2020, Popular Action Congressman Jorge Vásquez presented a bill suggesting that the headquarters the ministry be moved to Cuzco, the historic capital of the Inca Empire. The following year, during the inauguration of Pedro Castillo, it was suggested that the name be changed (from \"Ministry of Culture\" to \"Ministry of Cultures\") and that its headquarters be moved to Government Palace, which ultimately did not happen.\nOrganisation\n*Minister of Culture\n*Vice Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Cultural Industries\n**General Directorate of Cultural Heritage\n**General Directorate of Immovable Archaeological Heritage\n**General Directorate of Museums\n**General Directorate of Cultural Industries and the Arts\n**General Directorate for the Protection of Cultural Heritage\n**Directorate of Audiovisual, Phonography, and New Media (DAFO)\n*Vice Ministry of Interculturality\n**General Directorate of Intercultural Citizenship\n**General Directorate of Indigenous Peoples' Rights\n*Secretary General\n*Public prosecutor\nList of ministers\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-bgcolor=lightgrey\n!\n!Name\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Took office\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Left office\n!Party\n|-\n|1.\n|Juan Ossio Acuña\n|4 September 2010\n|28 July 2011\n| Independent\n|-\n|2.\n|Susana Baca de la Colina\n|28 July 2011\n|10 December 2011\n| Independent\n|-\n|3.\n|Luis Peirano Falconí\n|11 December 2011\n|24 July 2013\n| Independent\n|-\n|4.\n|Diana Álvarez-Calderón Gallo\n|24 July 2013\n|28 July 2016\n| Independent\n|-\n|5.\n|Jorge Nieto Montesinos\n|28 July 2016\n|5 December 2016\n| Independent\n|-\n|6.\n|Salvador del Solar Labarthe\n|5 December 2016\n|27 December 2017\n| Independent\n|-\n|7.\n|Alejandro Neyra Sánchez\n|9 January 2018\n|2 April 2018\n| Independent\n|-\n|8.\n|Patricia Balbuena Palacios\n|2 April 2018\n|30 November 2018\n| Independent\n|-\n|9.\n|Rogers Valencia Espinoza\n|18 December 2018\n|11 March 2019\n| Independent\n|-\n|10.\n|Ulla Holmquist Pachas\n|11 March 2019\n|8 July 2019\n| Independent\n|-\n|11.\n|Luis Castillo Butters\n|8 July 2019\n|30 September 2019\n| Independent\n|-\n|12.\n|Francisco Petrozzi Franco\n|3 October 2019\n|4 December 2019\n| Independent\n|-\n|13.\n|Sonia Guillén Oneeglio\n|7 December 2019\n|29 May 2020\n| Independent\n|-\n|14.\n|Alejandro Neyra Sánchez\n|30 May 2020\n|10 December 2020\n| Independent\n|-\n|15.\n|María del Carmen de Reparaz Zamora\n|12 November 2020\n|17 November 2020\n| Independent\n|-\n|16.\n|Alejandro Neyra Sánchez\n|18 November 2020\n|28 July 2021\n| Independent\n|-\n|17.\n|Ciro Gálvez Herrera\n|29 July 2021\n|6 October 2021\n| National United Renaissance\n|-\n|18.\n|Gisela Ortiz Perea\n|6 October 2021\n|1 February 2022\n| Independent\n|-\n|19.\n|Alejandro Salas Zegarra\n|1 February 2022\n|5 August 2022\n| We Are Peru\n|-\n|20.\n|Betssy Chavez Chino\n|5 August 2022\n|25 November 2022\n| Democratic Peru\n|-\n|21.\n|Silvana Robles Araujo\n|25 November 2022\n|7 December 2022\n| Free Peru\n|-\n|22.\n|Jair Pérez Brañez\n|10 December 2022\n|16 December 2022\n| Independent\n|-\n|23.\n|Leslie Urteaga\n|21 December 2022\n|3 September 2024\n| Independent\n|-\n|24.\n|Fabricio Valencia Gibaja\n|3 September 2024\n|Incumbent\n| Independent\n|}\nSee also\n*Tourism in Peru\n*Culture of Peru\n*Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Tourism\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cultura.gob.pe Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090118152107/http://www.inc.gob.pe/ Official website of the National Institute of Culture (Archive)]"
