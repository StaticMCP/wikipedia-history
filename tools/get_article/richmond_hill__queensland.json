A number of schools opened in the area.\nSt Columba's Primary School for girls was opened in 1876 by the Sisters of Mercy (a Catholic order). In 1882 the Sisters established St Mary's College. Later these schools were operated by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan (another Catholic order). On 14 April 1902 the Christian Brothers (also a Catholic order) opened Mount Carmel College for boys. In 1998 the three schools combined into Columba Catholic College operating from the three campuses (including the Mount Carmel campus in Richmond Hill); the church is now operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Townsville through Catholic Education.\nRichmond Hill State School, opened 9 September 1895.\nThe Presbyterian and Methodist Churches opened Thornburgh College as a boys boarding school on 1 June 1919. In 1978 Thornburgh College merged with Blackheath College (a Presbyterian and Methodist girls school in Charters Towers) to create an independent co-educational Christian college, Blackheath and Thornburgh College, on the site of Thornburgh College in Richmond Hill.\nIn 1920 All Souls’ School for boys was established by the Bush Brotherhood of St Barnabas (part of the Anglican Church) as a memorial school to the fallen of World War I. In 1921 St Gabriel’s School for girls was established by the Sisters of the Sacred Advent (also an Anglican order). After many years of co-educational activities, in 1990 the two schools merged as All Souls St Gabriels School on the All Souls campus. In 2000, the school ceased to be operated by the church and is now an independent Anglican school.\nDemographics\nIn the , Richmond Hill had a population of 2,776 people.\nIn the , Richmond Hill had a population of 2,488 people.\nIn the , Richmond Hill had a population of 2,453 people.\nHeritage listings\nRichmond Hill has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Stone kerbing, channels and footbridges of Charters Towers\n* Thornburgh House, 57–59 King Street\nEducation\nRichmond Hill State School is a government primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls on the corner of Baker and Burdekin Streets ().
