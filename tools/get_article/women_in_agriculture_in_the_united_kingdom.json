Women were also bringing money into farms through initially small diversifications into other businesses. Farmers Weekly ran a television show, Farmers Apprentice, presented by the Leicestershire dairy farmer Philippa Hall.\nIn March 2016, the then Environment Secretary Liz Truss celebrated International Women's Day with women farmers. In Scotland, too, the government and the National Farmers Union Scotland are working to promote women in agriculture in the 21st century. In February 2018, the 110 year old National Farmers' Union of England and Wales elected the beef farmer Minette Batters as their first female president.\nSee also\n* Women's Land Army (\"Land Girls\")\n* Working for Gardeners Association\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.rabdf.co.uk/women-in-dairy/ Women in Dairy]\n* [http://www.wfga.org.uk/ Women's Farm and Garden Association]"
