Emperor En'yū followed his mother's advice and favored Fujiwara no Kanemichi, his maternal uncle. He had only one son, later the emperor Emperor Ichijō by Senshi, a daughter of his uncle Fujiwara no Kaneie, who was another brother of his mother. He made the daughter of Kanemichi the empress consort, though she bore no children. Senshi and her father Kaneie were angry at this elevation of their rival and were absent from the court for a long time, staying at the mansion of Kaneie with the child.\nImperial processions to the Hachiman and Hirano Shrines were first made during the reign of Emperor En'yū.\n* 24 September 984 (Eikan 2, 27th of the 8th month): The emperor abdicated at age 26.\n* 16 September 985 (Kanna 1, 29th of the 8th month): The former-Emperor En'yū took the tonsure, becoming a Buddhist priest and taking the name of Kongō Hō.\n* 1 March 991 (Shōryaku 2, 12th of the 2nd month): En'yū, now known as Kongō Hō, died at age 32.\nThe actual site of En'yū's grave is known.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Kyoto.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as En'yū's mausoleum.  It is formally named Nochi no Mukarami no misasagi.\nKugyō\nis a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.
