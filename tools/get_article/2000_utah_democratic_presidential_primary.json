The Utah primary was an open primary, with any registered voter able to participate. The primary awarded 29 delegates towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of which 24 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nContinuing from his wins on Super Tuesday, Vice president Al Gore placed first by a large margin with around 79% of the vote and won 21 delegates, while Senator Bill Bradley came in second with around 20% and 3 delegates, after withdrawing the night before.\nProcedure\nUtah was one of two states that held primaries on March 10, 2000, along with Colorado.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. In the primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 24 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 5 and 6 were allocated to each of the state's 3 congressional districts and another 4 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 6 at-large delegates.\nThe convention voted on national convention district delegates via delegates from a specific district, those national convention district delegates than voted on the 4 pledged PLEO delegates, and the state convention finally voted on the 6 at-large delegates for the national convention. The delegation also included 5 unpledged PLEO delegates: 4 members of the Democratic National Committee and 1 add-on.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
