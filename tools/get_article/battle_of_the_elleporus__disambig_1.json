Dionysius triumphed in the battle and was then able to extend his control into southern Italy.\nHistory\nAfter arriving in southern Italy with a force of 20,000 men, 3000 horses and a fleet of 40 galleys, Dionysius decided to lay siege to Caulonia. To force Dionysius into relaxing his siege, the League commander Heloris decided to leave his camp and march north towards Elleporus with his army which numbered 25,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalrymen (mostly composed of Syracusan exiles). In response, Dionysius lifted the siege and marched his army to Elleporus  away from the enemy.\nThe two armies were ignorant of each other's whereabouts until Dionysius acquired intelligence about Heloris's position from one of his scouts. Exploiting this advantage he ordered his forces to launch a surprise attack on the enemy at dawn. Dionysius used his overwhelming numerical superiority to form a tight noose around the enemy. The disorganised and scattered forces of Heloris became easy prey for Dionysius's well organised phalanx and fled after hearing that their leader had been killed. They sought refuge on a hill but were surrounded by Dionysius's forces and later 10,000 of them surrendered.\nDionysius I of Syracuse went on to conquer southern Italy (Magna Graecia), heavily defeating the Italiote (Greek) League.\nSee also\n* Magna Graecia\nNotes\nReferences\n*Tucker, Spencer C.
