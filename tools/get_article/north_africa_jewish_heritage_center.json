Work took four years and required a team of Moroccan craftsmen to create the intricate zellige mosaic tile work.\nReconstructing the building in an authentic Moroccan style was controversial, as some saw it as \"importing foreign architecture and damaging a historic building\", but it is expected to become one of Jerusalem's top tourist sites.\nIt was opened in June 2011 in the presence of President Shimon Peres and former President Yitzhak Navon.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
