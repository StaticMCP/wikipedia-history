King Hans had been elected King of Sweden four years prior, but there was great dislike of his rule and the Danish officials placed to rule in the king's stead. When the Swedish rebel army took Örebro in August 1501, the king left for Denmark to gather troops and left his queen, Christina of Saxony, in possession of Stockholm. The king was declared deposed and Sten Sture the Elder proclaimed regent. In October, Stockholm was taken, and in May 1502, Queen Christina surrendered Stockholm Castle. In the summer of 1502, the rebels took Finland, and in the spring of 1503, Kalmar was taken.\nThe conflict resulted in the deposition of Hans as King of Sweden, and was a part of the bigger Dano-Swedish War (1501–1512).\nReferences\n* Sundberg, Ulf (2002).
