Anne Erickson from Blabbermouth.net gave the album 8 out of 10 and said: \"It's difficult to say where Where Do We Go from Here? fits in Asking Alexandria's discography, as it's one of the more dynamic records in their collection. The core of the album is still melodic metalcore, but it's certainly one of their heavier offerings, hinting at a heavier direction for the band.\" Kerrang! gave the album 4 out of 5 and stated: \" As usual, this album isn't entirely what fans will be expecting, and also as usual, it'll be more than worth the time for each and every one of them.\"\nLouder Sound gave the album a positive review and stated: \"Asking Alexandria stress that they worked hard to incorporate parts of many prior albums here, and in doing so they've produced some chart-worthy anthemic stadium rock songs. Where Do We Go From Here? also achieves something fans have craved for a long time: glimpses of the heaviness that made this inherently emotional band so beloved in the first place, albeit doused with some hefty doses of modern electronic influences.\" Wall of Sound scored the album 6.5/10 and wrote: \"Asking Alexandria's musical evolution continues on Where Do We Go from Here?. They have embraced both their past and present musical inclinations, showcasing a band maturing while reembracing some of their core roots. Will the 'core' parts be enough to re-engage lost fans? While I personally would only add a few of the tracks to my playlists, that's more than I would have from the last two albums.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAsking Alexandria\n* Danny Worsnop – lead vocals, additional guitar\n* Ben Bruce – lead guitar, backing vocals\n* Cameron Liddell – rhythm guitar\n* Sam Bettley – bass\n* James Cassells – drums\nAdditional personnel\n* Matt Good – production, mixing\n* Howie Weinberg and Will Borza – mastering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Chart performance for Where Do We Go from Here?\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
