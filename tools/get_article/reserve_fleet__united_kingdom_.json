Sir John Fisher's reforms made these reserve ships more ready for combat, in the lead up to the First World War.\nWhilst warships had been laid up in ordinary routinely, the establishment of a Reserve Fleet as a separate, formally established naval formation dated to the change in title and appointment of Vice Admiral Henry Oliver in November 1919. With the breakup of the Grand Fleet in April 1919, Royal Navy forces in home waters was divided between a new Atlantic Fleet consisting of the most powerful naval units, and a Home Fleet consisting of ships with nucleus crews and other vessels. On 8 April Admiral Sir Charles E. Madden became Commander-in-Chief, Home and Atlantic Fleets, and Vice-Admiral Sir Henry F. Oliver was appointed in command of the Home Fleet. The Home Fleet then consisted of the 3rd Battle Squadron of six ships, and the Fourth and Fifth Destroyer Flotillas totaling 35 destroyers and destroyer leaders.  This arrangement lasted until 1 October 1919, when the Fleet was reduced to a reserve basis, and \"Home Fleet\" was dropped from the Commander-in-Chief's title. On 1 November Vice-Admiral Oliver's title was changed to Vice-Admiral Commanding, Reserve Fleet.\nIt continued to exist in the inter-war years but in 1930 the Admiralty reduced it in size on the basis that war was unlikely in the next ten years, under the Government's Ten Year Rule. At the start of the Second World War the Reserve Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral Sir Max Horton, was again brought to a state of readiness. Some 15,000 men were called up in May 1939 to man the Reserve Fleet which became ready for service on 15 June 1939. During the 1950s ships were regularly 'cocooned' for the Reserve Fleet and it ceased to exist in 1960.\nCommanding admirals\nAdmirals commanding included:\n* 1919–1920 Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Oliver\n* 1920–1922 Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Phillimore\n* 1922–1923 Vice-Admiral Sir Douglas Nicholson\n* 1923–1924 Vice-Admiral Sir William Goodenough\n* 1924–1926 Vice-Admiral Sir Victor Stanley\n* March–October 1926 Vice-Admiral Sir Rudolph Bentinck\n* 1926–1928 Vice-Admiral Sir Hugh Watson\n* 1928–1929 Vice-Admiral Sir William Boyle\n* 1929–1930 Vice-Admiral Percival Hall-Thompson\n* 1930–1932 Vice-Admiral Sir Frank Larken\n* 1932–1934 Vice-Admiral Sir William Kerr\n* 1934–1935 Vice-Admiral Edward Astley-Rushton\n* 1935–1937 Vice-Admiral Sir Gerald Dickens\n* 1937–1939 Vice Admiral Sir Max Horton, Vice-Admiral Commanding Reserve Fleet, flag aboard HMS Hawkins until June 1938.
