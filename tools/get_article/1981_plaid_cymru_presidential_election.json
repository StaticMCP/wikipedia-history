The election followed both the defeat at the 1979 general election of Evans in Carmarthen and the defeat earlier that year of the Yes side in 1979 devolution referendum.\nThe contest was between Caernarfon MP Dafydd Wigley and Meirionnydd Nant Conwy MP Dafydd Elis Thomas, both of whom had entered the House of Commons in February 1974.\nThe contest was won by Dafydd Wigley, who went on to serve until 1984.\nNotes\nReferences"
