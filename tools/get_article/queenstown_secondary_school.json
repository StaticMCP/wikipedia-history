QTSS was one of the 28 schools selected by the Ministry of Education to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2020 onwards due to its ability to help students fulfil their potential. This includes reorganised form classes of varying academic abilities (Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical)).

Initially, classes were held at the Jalan Eunos English School while the school building was being prepared. In 1957, the school moved to Strathmore Road. Improvements to the building took place in 1963. A pre-university class was added in 1965, which existed until 1994. A new four-storey building was opened in April 1968. The school became co-educational in 1971. New facilities such as basketball courts have been added. In 1985, the school acquired a computer laboratory and language laboratory. Home Economics was also introduced as a subject in 1985.\nQueenstown Secondary School (1993–present)\nThe school was renamed Queenstown Secondary School (QTSS) in January 1993. From December 1993 to June 1997, it occupied temporary premises while the buildings at Strathmore Road were renovated and upgraded. The school has launched the masterplan for learning spaces and have started to reimagine the learning spaces in school so as to prepare students for the future of learning. The school's applied learning programme is in Environmental Sustainability and has worked many partners e.g. [https://www.swedcham.sg/initiatives/green-innovation-centre Swedish Chamber of Commerce Singapore] to enhance sustainability education. The school's learning for life programme is in Community Youth Leadership and has worked with many partners e.g. [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/playing-mahjong-and-kahoot-nus-students-tackle-ageism-creatively-to-promote-bonding-with-seniors NUS] to serve the community.\nIdentity and culture\nSchool crest\nThe school crest consists of a shield with the school colours, sky blue and maroon. The sky blue reflects the limitless opportunities to strive for and the maroon signifies the spirit of fraternity. The open book symbolises learning and knowledge, and the wheel symbolises the technical aspect of education offered in the school.\nOn the tower, which denotes strength, is the lion which signifies courage and from which Singapore derives its name. Below the shield is the school motto \"Berani Berkhidmat\", which means \"Dare To Serve\" in Malay.\nThe School Alumni Association was established in 1966 and registered in [https://www.sgpbusiness.com/societies/Queenstown-Secondary-School-Alumni 1977]. Beyond the many luminaries that walked through the gates of the school, the popular Quests band was derived from the school name as two of the members were from Queenstown Secondary Technical School.\nFormer house system\nBefore the Subject-based banding was announced, the school had five houses named after nearby roads and streets. They are:\nAlexandra - Red\nBelvedere - Green\nCommonwealth - Purple\nDundee - Blue\nStrathmore - Yellow\nNotable alumni\n* Lee Yock Suan (born 1946), a former Cabinet minister\n* Bahrin Abdullah (born 1961), a Bruneian politician and businessperson\n* Desmond Tan (born 1970), a current Senior Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office\nReferences"
