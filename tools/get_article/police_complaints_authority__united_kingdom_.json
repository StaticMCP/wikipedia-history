It was formed in 1985, replacing the Police Complaints Board and was then itself replaced by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) in April 2004.\nThe IPCC was also, in Northern Ireland, the successor body to Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, set up in 2000 to investigate complaints against the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its successor the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). It had its own teams of civilian investigators and was completely independent of the Police. In addition to the PSNI it also covered the Belfast Harbour Police and the Larne Harbour Police, the Belfast International Airport Constabulary, and the MoD Police (not the same as the Royal Military Police). Unlike the IPCC the Ombudsman's office could investigate an incident without a referral or complaint.\nInvestigations\nThe PCA asked the West Yorkshire Police to investigate the activities of the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad in 1989. It reported in 1994.\nSee also\n* Police Complaints Authority (New Zealand)\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ipcc.gov.uk IPCC]\n* [http://www.policeombudsman.org Police Ombudsman]\nReferences"
