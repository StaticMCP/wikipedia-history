She alleged that the assaults began under the pretext of spiritual guidance and were continued during religious tours and events. In 2014, she filed a police complaint after confiding in her husband. A trial court later acquitted Raghaveshwara Bharathi, stating that the prosecution had not established a strong enough case to proceed to trial. An appeal against this acquittal is pending in the Karnataka High Court.\nIn the second case, the seer was accused of raping a 15-year-old girl in 2006. The complainant, a former student at a school run by the math, alleged that the assault occurred during a private ritual called \"Rama Darshan\" conducted at the math. She further alleged that she was threatened and later abducted by individuals including advocate Aruna Shyam, who was named as a co-accused in the case. Charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act were filed, and the matter is currently under judicial consideration.\nJudicial recusals and case developments\nSince 2014, over ten Karnataka High Court judges have recused themselves from various cases involving the seer. Reasons cited or speculated include potential conflicts of interest, prior professional associations, and personal connections to the parties involved. The high number of recusals has led to delays in the judicial process. Similar recusals by other judges followed over the years.\nAdditional allegations related to threats and intimidation of the complainants have been raised. In the second case, advocate Aruna Shyam, who also served as Additional Advocate General of Karnataka, was granted anticipatory bail after being accused of kidnapping and threatening the survivor.\nAs of 2022, proceedings in both cases continue, with hearings and appeals pending before various judicial benches.\nOther Allegations\nAllegations related to Gauri Lankesh murder\nIn September 2017, one of the alleged rape victims filed a complaint with the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh. They alleged that Bharati might have had an indirect role in the murder due to critical articles written about him by Gauri Lankesh. According to them, her writings had exposed past allegations involving the Bharati, including sexual assault claims. The SIT reviewed the documents submitted by the couple and, according to media reports, found no direct evidence linking the seer to the crime.\nHonors\nHe declined the offer of an honorary doctorate from Gulbarga University in 2013.\nNotable disciples\n*Suresh Oberoi and Vivek Oberoi Bollywood actors\n*Arvind Bhat, PV Sindhu International Badminton players\n*Rama Jois, Former Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Former Governor of Jharkhand and Bihar\n*Radhe Shyam Agarwal, Indian Entrepreneur, Founder of Emami Industries, Kolkata\n*Anant Kumar Hegde, Former Union Minister and current MP (Lok Sabha) of Uttara Kannada\n*Nalin Kumar Kateel, BJP Karnataka State President\n*Tejasvi Surya MP Bengaluru South and National President of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.srisamsthana.org/ Official Website of Sri Sri Raghaveshwara Bharathi Swamiji]\n* [http://udayindia.in/2016/04/20/declare-cow-and-its-progeny-national-animal-sri-sri-raghaveshwara-bharati/ “Declare Cow and its progeny National Animal” –Sri Sri Raghaveshwara Bharathi]"
