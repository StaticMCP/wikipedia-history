It was later dubbed into English and released in America and Europe as Defenders of Space and parts of its footage was used to create 'Space Thunder Kids.' The small image of the movie poster depicts a toy version of Phoenix King that was released.\nPhoenix King is identical to a Diaclone toy No.10 Fire Engine, that later became Inferno of the Transformers. This is the earliest animated version of said toy.\nCriticism\nThe film is infamous for copying designs from numerous Super Robot Series in Japan, especially Mazinger Z, Ippatsuman, Space Cruiser Yamato, Mobile Suit Gundam and many of Leiji Matsumoto's works.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://sulfur.pe.kr/tech/board.php?board=lyric&command=body&no=836 Phoenix-bot Phoenix King] at Mimanbu\n* [http://karaeff.tistory.com/566 Karaeff]\n*\n* [http://www.kmdb.or.kr/eng/md_basic.asp?nation=K&p_dataid=05591 Phoenix Robot Phoenixing (Bulsajo Roboteu Pinikseu King)] at the Korean Movie Database"
