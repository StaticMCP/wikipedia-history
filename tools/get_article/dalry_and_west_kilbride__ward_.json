      "text": "# Dalry and West Kilbride (ward)\n\nDalry and West Kilbride was one of the 10 wards used to elect members of North Ayrshire Council. Created in 2007 following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements, the ward elected three councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system. As a result of the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018, the ward was abolished in 2022.\nThe ward latterly produced strong results for the Conservatives but was previously split between the Scottish National Party (SNP), Conservatives and independents.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Dalry and West Kilbride was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards. It contained the southern part of the former Largs South and Fairlie ward, the majority of the former Ardrossan North, Garnock East and Kilbirnie South wards as well as all of the former Dalry and West Kilbride wards and the northern half of the former Kilwinning West ward. Dalry and West Kilbride rans across the council area from the Firth of Clyde to the easternmost part of the council area between its borders with East Ayrshire and East Renfrewshire and centred around the towns of Dalry and West Kilbride. Following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections, the ward was increased in area as the northern boundary was moved to run along the A737 up to the council's border with Renfrewshire, taking in an area that was previously part of the Kilbirnie and Beith ward.\nIn 2018, the Scottish Parliament passed the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018 which included provisions to improve the representation of island communities on councils. As a result, an intermediate review of the boundaries in North Ayrshire was carried out. The review coincided with the introduction of the Scottish Elections (Reform) Act 2020 which allowed for the creation of five-member wards. This proposed that three wards – Dalry and West Kilbride, Kilbirnie and Beith and North Coast and Cumbraes – be replaced by two new wards named Garnock Valley and North Coast. The proposals for North Ayrshire were subsequently approved by the Scottish Parliament and the ward was abolished in 2022.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!colspan=6|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Elizabeth McLardy(Ind.)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|John Reid(Labour)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=5|Robert Barr(Conservative/Ind.)\n|-\n!2010\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Catherine McMillan(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Todd Ferguson(Conservative)\n|rowspan=1|Joy Brahim(SNP)\n|-\n!2021by-election\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ronnie Stalker(Conservative)\n|}\nElection results\n2021 by-election\n2017 election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nNotes\nReferences"
