It provides additional protections for copyright to respond to advances in information technology since the formation of previous copyright treaties before it.Julie S Sheinblatt, 'The WIPO Copyright Treaty' (1998) 13 (1) Berkeley Technology Law Journal 535  As of August 2023, the treaty has 115 contracting parties. The WCT and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, are together termed WIPO \"internet treaties\".\nHistory\nDuring the earlier stages of negotiations, the WCT was seen as a protocol to the Berne Convention, constituting an update of that agreement since the 1971 Stockholm Conference. However, as any amendment to the Berne Convention required unanimous consent of all parties, the WCT was conceptualized as an additional treaty which supplemented the Berne Convention. The collapse of negotiations around the extension of the Berne Convention during the 1980s saw the shifting of the forum to the GATT, resulting in the TRIPS Agreement. Thus, the nature of any copyright treaty by the World Intellectual Property Organization became considerably narrower, being limited to addressing the challenges posed by digital technologies.\nProtection granted by the Treaty\nThe WCT emphasizes the incentive nature of copyright protection, claiming its importance to creative endeavours. It ensures that computer programs are protected as literary works (Article 4), and that the arrangement and selection of material in databases is protected (Article 5). It provides authors of works with control over their rental and distribution in Articles 6 to 8, which they may not have under the Berne Convention alone. It also prohibits circumvention of technological measures for the protection of works (Article 11) and unauthorized modification of rights management information contained in works (Article 12).\nThe treaty has been criticised for being too broad (for example in its prohibition of circumvention of technical protection measures, even where such circumvention is used in the pursuit of legal and fair use rights) and for applying a \"one size fits all\" standard to all signatory countries, despite their widely differing stages of economic development and knowledge industry.\nImplementation\nThe WIPO Copyright Treaty is implemented in United States law by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). By Decision 2000/278/EC of 16 March 2000, the Council of the European Union approved the treaty on behalf of the European Community. European Union Directives which largely cover the subject matter of the treaty are: Directive 91/250/EC, creating copyright protection for software; Directive 96/9/EC on copyright protection for databases; and Directive 2001/29/EC, prohibiting devices for circumventing \"technical protection measures\", such as digital rights management (also known as DRM).\nSee also\n*List of parties to international copyright agreements\n*List of parties to international treaties protecting rights related to copyright\n*Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs)\n*Software patents under TRIPs Agreement\n*WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT)\n*Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement\nReferences\nExternal links and references\n*The full text of the [http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/text.jsp?file_id=295166 WIPO Copyright Treaty (adopted in Geneva on December 20, 1996)]  in the WIPO Lex database – official website of WIPO.\n**[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?lang=en&treaty_id=16 Parties to the Treaty]\n* Summary: https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/wct/summary_wct.html"
