These were rubber-stamped on 26 September after the Home Secretary had granted permission, they commenced a month later. There were two divisions; eastern and western; each consisting of 16 clubs. This left out six of the previous league clubs; Montrose, Brechin City, Forfar Athletic, Leith Athletic, Edinburgh City and East Stirlingshire.\nCowdenbeath resigned halfway through the season, they had played all the other clubs once and so their record was allowed to stand. The competition was completed by a play-off between the two divisional winners, who were Rangers and Falkirk; Rangers won 2–1 at Hampden Park.\nFor the following season, competitions were organised separately in different parts of the country: the Southern Football League and the North Eastern Football League, which lasted until the resumption of official competitions in 1946 (although the Southern League 'absorbed' the North Eastern League in the 1945–46 season).\nWestern division\nEastern division\nPlay-off\nFalkirk Reasonably Annoyed], The Glasgow Herald, 3 June 1940\n| time =\n| team1 = Rangers\n| score = 2–1\n| team2 = Falkirk\n| goals1 = Venters Little\n| goals2 = Napier\n| stadium = Ibrox Park, Glasgow\n| referee = P.
