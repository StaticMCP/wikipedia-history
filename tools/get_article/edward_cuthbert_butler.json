He was sometimes referred to as Dom Cuthbert Butler.\nButler is known for ''The Vatican Council: The Story from Inside in Bishop Ullathorne's Letters. Described by Michael J. G. Pahls as \"[t]he standard [English-language] account of the First Vatican Council\", the book is based on the correspondence of Bishop William Bernard Ullathorne of Birmingham. Gertrude Himmelfarb describes The Vatican Council'' as designed to support papal infallibility.\nHe also wrote on mysticism.\nEarly life\nEdward Joseph Aloysius Butler was born on 6 May 1858 in Dublin, Ireland, to Edward Butler (1812-1902) and Mary (Cruise) Butler. His father was the first professor of mathematics at the Catholic University of Ireland, from 1854 to 1859, before and after that having worked for the Commission of National Education in Ireland. His mother came from a Norman Irish Catholic family and was a sister of the eminent consulting physician Sir Francis Cruise.\nButler was educated at Downside School, an English Benedictine school, from 1869 to 1875. During his time at the school, he was greatly influenced by the Benedictine priest William Petre who, along with the prior, Bernard Murphy, advised him as he discerned his vocation. As his parents did not want him to enter the Benedictine noviciate immediately after finishing at Downside, he spent a brief period at the short-lived Catholic University College in Kensington, London, as well as travelling throughout Europe.\nMonastic life\nButler entered the noviciate at Belmont Abbey in Herefordshire in 1876. Reflecting on his entry into the abbey in a manuscript written between 1891 and 1892, he wrote:\n}}\nHe was ordained in 1884, the same year he got an MA from the University of London, under his birth name, and then became headmaster at Downside School.  In 1896 he moved to Cambridge, and soon thereafter he founded Benet House there for Benedictines attending that university.  He was a student at Christ's College, Cambridge, now using the name Edward Cuthbert Butler, and was awarded BA 1898 and MA 1903. In 1906 he was elected Abbot of Downside Abbey, a post he held until his resignation in 1922.\nHe spent the rest of his life preaching in London and writing the books for which he is now remembered, in particular Western Mysticism (1922) and The Vatican Council (1930). He had earlier contributed dozens of articles to the 11th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica (1911).\nHe died at his home in London on 2 April 1934.\nPublished works\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  Reprint of\n*\n|year=2003\n|title=Butler, Edward Cuthbert\n|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/butler-edward-cuthbert\n|encyclopedia=New Catholic Encyclopedia\n|volume=2\n|edition=2nd\n|location=Detroit, Michigan\n|publisher=Gale\n|page=720\n|access-date=18 November 2017\n|via=Encyclopedia.com\n}}\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n|year=1963\n|chapter=The Works and Thought of Abbot Butler\n|title=The Historian and Character: And Other Essays\n|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/historiancharact00know\n|chapter-url-access=registration\n|location=Cambridge, England\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|publication-date=2008\n|pages=341–362\n|isbn=978-0-521-08841-1\n|access-date=18 November 2017\n|ref=none\n}} Reprint of\nExternal links"
