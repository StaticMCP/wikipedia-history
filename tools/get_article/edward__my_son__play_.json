      "text": "# Edward, My Son (play)\n\nEdward, My Son is a British play written by Noel Langley and Robert Morley. Its original West End run lasted for 782 performance between 30 May 1947 and 23 April 1949, initially at His Majesty's Theatre and then at the Lyric Theatre. The play portrays the moral decline of a business tycoon, Sir Arnold Holt, who has worked his way up from humble beginnings. Holt's efforts for social advancement are driven by his desire to provide the best for his only son, Edward of the title, who never actually appears.\nThe original cast included Morley himself as Arnold Holt alongside Peggy Ashcroft, Leueen MacGrath and Richard Caldicot. John Clements later took over the lead role from Morley. In 1948 it transferred to Broadway, lasting for 260 performances at the Martin Beck Theatre.
