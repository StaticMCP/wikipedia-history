It was disbanded on August 31, 1919, in France.\nOrganization\n(center) at the SOS headquarters at Tours, France, October 1918.]]\nThe Services of Supply (SOS) of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) was established under the designation \"Line of Communications,\" on July 5, 1917. The Line of Communications was judged by senior officers, including Colonel Johnson Hagood, who was in charge of the advance section, to be incompetent. It was re-designated \"Service of the Rear\" on February 16, 1918, to March 12, 1918. It was finally designated as \"Services of Supply\" on March 13, 1918. Its headquarters was in Tours, France. The SOS consisted of base sections, which provided seaport and receiving services; an intermediate section, which provided storage and services; and an advanced section, which also stored supplies and issued them to line forces. The SOS remained in operation until July 19, 1919; some of its sections were transferred to American Forces in France and American Forces in Germany\nOn September 7, 1917, General John J. Pershing, the AEF's commander, directed that a ninety-day reserve of all classes of supplies be maintained by monthly shipments to reduce the impact of possible German submarine attacks. The goal was to have reserves stockpiled as follows in the established sections (see below):\n*Forty-five days near ports in the base sections.\n*Thirty days in the Intermediate Section.\n*Fifteen days in the Advance Section.\nCommanders\nCommanders of the S.
