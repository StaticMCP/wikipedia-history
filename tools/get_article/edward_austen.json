Austen's batting style is unknown.\nThe son of Sir Francis William Austen and Mary Gibson, Austen was born at Chawton, Hampshire. He was a nephew to the novelist Jane Austen. He studied at St John's College, Oxford, gaining his BA in 1846 and his MA in 1850. He played a single first-class cricket match for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Oxford University in 1844 at the Magdalen Ground, Oxford. In a match which Oxford University won by 5 runs, Austen was run out for a duck in the MCC's first-innings, while he ended their second not out on 3.\nAusten was later the rector at Barfrestone, Kent, a position he held from 1854 until his death on 10 June 1908.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
