Most of the songs on the project were recorded at E.M.E headquarters. Banky W told Beverly Bryan of MTV Iggy that living with Skales and Wizkid made the album easier to record. Empire Mates State of Mind was initially scheduled for release on 12 June 2012, but ended up being postponed. E.M.E released the album's final track listing instead. On 15 and 16 June, E.M.E organized a listening party and launch event to celebrate and promote the album. The listening party was held at the Deuces Bar & Lounge in Victoria Island, Lagos.\nEmpire Mates State of Mind was released exclusively on Spinlet, a digital media company.
