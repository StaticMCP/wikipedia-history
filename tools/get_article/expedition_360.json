It was begun by Lewis and Stevie Smith in 1994 and ended at 12:24 pm[http://www.expedition360.com/journal/archives/2007/10/circumnavigatio.html x360 Journal: Circumnavigation Complete!] on 6 October 2007, when Lewis re-crossed the prime meridian at Greenwich, London, having travelled .[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7022644.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Human power fuels 13-year odyssey][https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/7031576.stm BBC NEWS | England | Dorset | Briton completes 13-year odyssey]\nUnderlying definition\nA true circumnavigation of the world must pass through two points antipodean to each other. Norris McWhirter, founding editor of Guinness, 1971.\n[A] true circumnavigation of the Earth must: start and finish at the same point, traveling in one general direction, reach two antipodes, cross the equator, cross all longitudes, cover a minimum of 40,000km. AdventureStats by Explorersweb\nHistory\nIn 2006, the Adventure publication of the National Geographic Society honored Canadians Colin Angus and Julie Wafaei as Adventurers of the Year for their \"journey around the world\" by human power. The Society also stated that it does not \"act as an official arbiter of geographic issues\". Angus' journey did not cross the equator or hit the minimum of two antipodal points as stipulated by the rules of Guinness World Records or  by Explorersweb. Additionally, in the February 2013 issue of Outside magazine, Angus's then-traveling partner Tim Harvey went on the record to say the pair \"put up an emergency sail, using it for about 95 nautical miles\" crossing the Bering Sea between Alaska and Siberia. As journalist Nick Heil pointed out, this alone was enough to disqualify a human-powered claim of any description.\nThe only other person to have completed a legitimate human-powered circumnavigation is Turkish-American adventurer Erden Eruç who completed the first solo circumnavigation between July 2007 and July 2012.\nStevie Smith developed the concept of the Expedition 360 global circumnavigation while he was working in an office in Paris. Smith's friend Jason Lewis joined the project and the pair raised money for a pedal boat, which was built by Chris Tipper and Hugo Burnham. The specially-built vessel was named the Moksha, a Sanskrit word that means freedom. To raise cash Stevie bicycled to Marrakesh, Morocco. Neither Smith nor Lewis had received formal training in cycling or in operating pedal boats.\nThe Expedition\nEuropean leg\nSmith and Lewis set off on bicycles from Greenwich, London at midday on 12 July 1994. They cycled south-east across Britain to the coast at Rye, then pedalled across the English Channel, and then cycled south again across France through major cities including Paris and Orléans. The pair split up for a short while, meeting back up in Spain. They then travelled through Madrid, across Portugal and through Lisbon, finally arriving at Lagos on 29 September 1994. According to Smith, they slept outdoors, taking their sleeping bags into open places and sleeping under the stars.\nThe Atlantic Ocean\nThe trip across the Atlantic took 111 days, pedaling in two-hour day and four-hour night shifts. It ended in Miami.\nNorth America\nThey crossed the North American continent on bicycles and skates. Skating near Pueblo, Colorado, Lewis was hit by a drunk driver and broke both of his legs. He spent 9 months in Colorado healing and resting.\nPacific\nLewis completed the journey across the Pacific in the Moksha.  Smith quit the project in Hawaii.\nAustralasia\nThe next leg to be completed was Australia and Indonesia. The journey north used pedal boats, kayaks and bicycle. This leg of the circumnavigation in Australia was especially noteworthy, as Jason reached the antipode to his Atlantic crossing path.\nFinal legs\nin London, shortly before completing the first human-powered circumnavigation of the Earth (2007)]]\nThe second half of Jason's human powered circumnavigation journey continued through Southeast Asia and India before crossing the Arabian Sea to the African shores, from where he aimed north toward the Middle East and Europe, eventually returning to his starting point in England.\nDuring his expedition, Lewis twice survived malaria, septicaemia, a bout of mild schizophrenia, and a crocodile attack near Australia in 2005.\nSee also\n* Colin Angus (explorer)\n* Julie Wafaei\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Smith, Stevie, Pedaling To Hawaii: A Human-Powered Odyssey, US: Countryman; UK Summersdale Publishers Ltd (2006) foreword by the Dalai Lama.\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mikecarter Carter, Mike], \"One Man and his Bike\", Ebury Press (June 2, 2011).
