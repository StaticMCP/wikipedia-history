Past members include notable British Field Marshals Wavell, Auchinleck and Templer. The current president is Lieutenant-General Sir Edward Smyth-Osbourne and Brigadier James Cook is chairman of its council. The patron of the society is Field Marshal HRH the Duke of Kent.\nThe society's interests embrace both army and regimental history, military antiquities and pictures, uniforms, badges and medals, arms and equipment and the history of land warfare in general. The study of campaigns, commanders and the political aspects of war are covered from the sixteenth century to the recent past.\nFrom 2022, the society has conferred a small number of [https://www.sahr.org.uk/fellowships.php Fellowships], allowing the holder the use of the postnominals FSAHR.\nJournal\nThe society's main activity is the publication of the peer-reviewed quarterly Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research reflecting its members' interests. Issues of the Journal contain a mixture of articles, which are peer-reviewed, communications, which typically deal with more specialised subjects and are not subject to peer-review, and book reviews. Listings are also included of recent academic work in the field of military history, and of new archival resources of relevance to the topic. Each issue typically contains at least one colour plate, as well as other illustrations. Not all articles are dryly academic; there are often interesting or amusing anecdotal forays into historical nooks, or revealing examinations of unjustly forgotten soldiers. In addition, over the years, the society has produced a number of [http://www.sahr.org.uk/special-publications.php special issues]: topics for special issues include monographs on dress distinctions and bibliographical or regimental research aids,  previously-unpublished soldiers' letters or diaries, and anthologies of material dealing with specific topics - most recently the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo, and the Great War.\nTempler Medal\nSince 1982, the society has awarded the [http://www.sahr.org.uk/templar-medal-book-prize.php Templer Medal] to the author of the most impressive or significant book relating to the British, Commonwealth or Dominion armies published in the preceding year. This prize was founded to commemorate the life and achievements of Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, best known for his defeat of the guerrilla rebels in Malaya between 1952 and 1954.
