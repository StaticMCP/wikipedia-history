He played college football for the Tulane Green Wave.\nBankston played at fullback for the Steelers for four seasons: 1969–1972. When the Steelers tried him at tight end in an exhibition game during the 1973 preseason, the Raiders, who needed a tight end, spotted him. They traded for him, and he went to the Raiders at the preseason's end.\nDuring the 1976 season, from which the Raiders went on to Super Bowl XI, Bankston, as team captain, called the coin flip correctly for every game but one. He called it correctly again at the Super Bowl itself, which the Raiders won.  He was very popular with the fans due to his practice of throwing the football into the stands when he scored.\nBefore attending Tulane University, Bankston was quarterback for the Hammond High School (Louisiana) Tornadoes and finished in the Class of 1965. At Hammond High he was elected to the National Honor Society and the Kiwanis-related Key Club, besides lettering in football, basketball, and track during all four years.\nFootnotes"
