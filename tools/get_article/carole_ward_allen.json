As commission chair, Ward Allen pushed for practical workplace policies that resulted in women receiving paid maternity leave; she worked closely on this workplace policy with then-Assemblywoman Maxine Waters who introduced a bill on this issue in 1984, and she advocated for women to receive equal compensation for equal work. Ward Allen told The New York Times that women should be allowed to return to the workplace after having children and be afforded maternity leave under California law. She saw maternity leave as a vital right for women and thought the lack of a maternity law in California perpetuated a false choice for women, stating:\n}}\nCalifornia state legislators Diane Watson and Waters worked closely with commissioner Ward Allen on issues pertaining to women's rights in society. Ward Allen served on the commission with future-California state senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, and Irene Inouye who would become chair of the  Ford Foundation Board of Trustees.\nOakland Board of Port Commissioners\nPortrait of Ward Allen as an Oakland port commissioner\nTenure\nIn 1987, Ward Allen was nominated by Oakland's 45th Mayor Lionel J.

From 1990 until 1992, she served as commission president, making her the first African American female to lead the port in its history; during a time when Oakland's port was recognized as one of the top ten ports in the country. Also, Ward Allen was the second African American female to be appointed to the commission and the third female.\nDuring her six-year tenure with the port, Ward Allen was responsible for transportation, businesses, financial and political strategies for the development of the maritimes facilities, the Oakland International Airport, and commercial real estate holdings.

This was the second time in history Amtrak had come to Oakland. The site of the Amtrak station officially re-opened in 1995 owned by the Port of Oakland.

Ward Allen represented the 4th district in Alameda County, which included the cities of Oakland and Alameda. She was re-elected in 2002 and 2006 running unopposed.\nDuring Ward Allen's tenure she changed policies, procedures, operations, and reformed the BART Police with assistance from the California State Legislature and members of the general public under her watch.\nIn addition, she advocated for the hiring of Dorothy Dugger as the first female to serve as general manager or CEO of the entire BART organization. Although, Ward Allen originally supported the hiring of an African American female, Beverly Scott of the Sacramento Regional Transit District to become general manager, she had to compromise.\nWard Allen constantly reinforced transit oriented development policy-making, which resulted in affordable housing and livable communities for residents in the Fruitvale, Coliseum, and Lake Merritt districts. She supported minority-and-women-owned businesses stay afloat economically, and generated employment opportunities for her constituents.\nWard Allen's greatest public policy achievements were passing legislation to build the controversial Oakland Airport Connector project, and advocating for civilian oversight of the BART Police Department. She called on the California State Legislature to assist the BART Board, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, stating:\nAdditionally, she served as vice president in 2005 and President in 2006 of the BART board of directors, managing a budget of $672 million for the transportation agency.\nOakland Airport Connector Project\n, (Center) Ward Allen, James Fang, and Sandre Swanson at the groundbreaking of the Oakland Airport Connector in 2010.]]\nSince 1998, Ward Allen fought vigorously for the creation of contracting opportunities for small minority-and-women-owned businesses. Providing employment opportunities to Oakland and Alameda residents was her main source of motivation in elected office. Therefore, she often collaborated with the local unions to facilitate the creation of job opportunities to put people back to work and provide economic relief to citizens, especially  in the wake of the Great Recession. For example, the  Oakland Airport Connector project generated approximately 2,500 to 5,200 direct and indirect jobs. Ward Allen actively sponsored many of BART's historic measures such as its first Project Labor Agreement with zip-code-priority to disadvantaged communities in her district and formulated the first small business and bonding committee to help mitigate economic disparities disproportionately impacting minority-owned businesses.\nOn October 20, 2010, BART director Ward Allen had a ground breaking event on the project at the Oakland Coliseum Station and was joined by Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Mayor Ron Dellums, Assemblywoman Sandre Swanson, Oakland city councilman Larry Reid, Port of Oakland officials, representatives of local unions and ministers on its announcement to the public. The high-tech and environmentally friendly 3.2-mile automated Oakland Airport Connector began operating in November 2014.\nTitle VI\nAs chairwoman of the Oakland Airport Connector Committee, she has solicited the input from diverse communities (such as non-English speaking and low-income), in the aftermath of a civil rights complaint against the construction of the Oakland Airport Connector. She was the first BART director to demand that signage and documentation needed to be multi-lingual; to serve her communities, but to ensure diverse populations understand how to evacuate train stations in the circumstance of an emergency. This need was especially a priority to Oakland's Chinatown and Fruitvale districts given the predominantly Asian and Latino populations. Furthermore, she made sure there were live translators available for the first time in BART's history during community and townhall meetings in 2009.\nCalifornia legislation to enforce civilian oversight\nOn July 15, 2010, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the historic BART Accountability Act AB 1586 into California law, which Ward Allen urged the California State Legislature to adopt during a Senate hearing on June 15, 2010. She worked closely with Assemblyman Sandre Swanson, who authored the legislation, to enforce civilian oversight of the BART Police Department. Ward Allen thanked the governor, the community, the entire BART organization and Assemblyman Swanson for their hard work on getting AB 1586 bill implemented in the aftermath of the shooting of Oscar Grant. The law also created the Office of the Independent Auditor at BART, which would investigate matters brought to the BART Board by the civilian oversight committee.\nIn addition to changing California law, Ward Allen supported the family of Oscar Grant by being the only BART director who attended the Oscar Grant trial on the nine-member board in Los Angeles during the summer of 2010. Earlier, in the same year, she was one of the keynote speakers at the inaugural vigil; honoring the life of Oscar Grant and supporting his family at the Fruitvale station. In her speech, she apologized again on the behalf of BART for his tragic death, and gave Grant's uncle Cephus Johnson a bouquet of flowers for the family. The events leading up to Grant's death were chronicled in the film Fruitvale Station, in which Michael B. Jordan starred as Grant. The Fruitvale station was in Ward Allen's district.\nBART Police Department reform\nIn 2009, the hiring of two independent organizations reviewed BART's policies and procedures in the process of reforming the BART Police. The two independent firms, included the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement and Myers Nave who were responsible for investigating the matters of BART Police Shooting of Oscar Grant and were charged with making recommendations to the board. Ward Allen acknowledged that the BART Police Department needed to be reformed and restructured. She told the public at its first board meeting after the shooting that:\n}}\nThereafter, Ward Allen formulated and chaired BART's first Police Department Review Committee, and as a result, BART made sweeping changes on many security measures, as well as corrected and implemented several policies and procedures. BART Police Department Review Committee has led to the re-training of all officers on use of force, diversity re-training and other issues. Ward Allen hired Kenton Rainey, the person selected to lead BART's 296-member police force, to take command as Chief of Police.\nColiseum Intercity Rail Station\n, David Hinson, and Ward Allen (far right) finishing a business meeting with U.S. Department of Commerce.]]\nOn May 25, 2005, then-Vice President Ward Allen of the BART board of directors joined Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, city councilman Larry Reid, CCJPA vice chair Forrest Williams, and Caltrans Division of Rail Chief Bill Bronte at the grand opening of the Oakland Coliseum Intercity Rail Station. She was a proponent of the $6.6 million facility being built to provide other modes of public transportation to citizens of Oakland and the Bay Area. Ward Allen served on the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority board of directors for several years during the early 2000s.\nFruitvale and Coliseum Transit Villages\nWard Allen's efforts toward cultivating a more eco-friendly and green environment for BART resulted in the largest BART bicycle station being created as a part of the Fruitvale transit village. The Fruitvale transit village is a national model for transit oriented development, given Ward Allen and former BART director Margaret Pryor's leadership. The Fruitvale transit village was built in partnership with the Spanish Speaking Unity Council, and Phase I was completed in 2004. Phase I included 94 rental units, 92 of which were affordable households that were considered low income, and 2 market-rate units. This was a significant victory for BART's 4th district residents in the City of Oakland. On July 22, 2010, Ward Allen and the BART Board approved 3.4 acres of property that remained undeveloped for Phase II of the transit village.\nIn addition, she worked hard on the Coliseum transit village for more than a decade and approved its construction of single-family for-sale homes — with some set aside for low- and moderate-income residents — as well as shops and restaurants. Ward Allen worked closely with Oakland city councilman Larry Reid to approve the third stage of the transit village project, which would explore building approximately 100 workforce housing units on what is now a 1.3-acre parking lot at Snell Street and 71st Avenue in their shared district.\nSmall/Minority/Women-Owned Business and Bonding Committee\nIn 2009, Ward Allen formulated BART's first Small/Minority/Women-Owned Business and Bonding Committee. The committee sought to address the critical problems that are preventing minority-and-women-owned construction businesses from receiving adequate information in a timely fashion, making plan rooms available to low-income communities, expediting the response time of all allocations and qualifying for contracts. Ward Allen advocated that the BART Board should earmark a part of the capital budget to support disadvantaged business enterprises, resulting in BART injecting up to $45 million between 2009 and 2014 into the local economy with much of that money going to minority- and women-owned businesses.\nPublic service recognition\nIn March 2011, Ward Allen was inducted into the  Alameda County Women's Hall of Fame in the category of Education. She has taught over 100,000 students in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to The Oakland Post. Many students have indicated that she made  a fundamental difference in their lives and inspired them to seek out knowledge.\nThe Conference of Minority Transportation Officials (COMTO) presented Ward Allen with the Lifetime Achievement Award at its annual awards ceremony in 2011 for her dedication to public service in the transportation industry, and recognizing her achievement of breaking ground on the Oakland Airport Connector, a landmark construction project legislated by Ward Allen.\nIn 2008, Laney College President Frank Chong recognized Ward Allen for her leadership in higher education with the President's Award.\nIn 2005, she received recognition for her expertise as a groundbreaking executive of public transportation with the  National Coalition of 100 Black Women, Inc San Francisco Bay Area chapter's  Pioneer Award at the 7th Annual Madam C.J. Walker Business and Community Recognition Awards Luncheon.
