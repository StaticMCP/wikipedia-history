He served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York from 1960 to 1978.\nSwanstrom served as the national director of Catholic Relief Services from 1947 to 1976.\nBiography\nEarly life\nEdward Swanstrom was born on March 20, 1903, in New York City to Gustave and Mary (Cronin) Swanstrom. Edward Swanstrom graduated from Fordham University in the Bronx with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1924. While at Fordham he was a member of the varsity track team, captaining it his senior year. He studied for the priesthood at St. John's Seminary in Brooklyn.\nPriesthood\nSwanstrom was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Brooklyn by Bishop Thomas Edmund Molloy on June 2, 1928 in Brooklyn. Swanstrom earned a Master of Arts degree in social work from the New York School of Social Work in Manhattan in 1933 and a Doctor of Political Philosophy degree from Fordham in 1938. His doctoral dissertation concerned the problems of waterfront laborers in Brooklyn.\nSwanstrom was curate at St. James Pro-Cathedral in Brooklyn from 1934 to 1960. He took on additional responsibilities as assistant diocesan director of Catholic Charities from 1933 to 1943, assistant executive director of Catholic Relief Services (CRS) from 1943 to 1947, and finally as executive director of CRS from 1947 to 1976.\nIn 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber of the US Army Air Corps accidentally crashed into the Empire State Building in Manhattan, destroying the CRS office there. Swanstrom's secretary was killed. Swanstrom was in the building lobby when the plane hit; he went upstairs to deliver sacraments to the dying.\nAuxiliary Bishop of New York\nIn 1960, Swanstrom was appointed auxiliary bishop of New York by Pope John XXIII. He was consecrated by the pope at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome on October 28, 1960. He also served as pastor of St. Andrew's Church in New York City from 1965 to 1973 while remaining executive director of Catholic Relief Services.\nWith American involvement in the Vietnam War, CRS began substantial operations in Southeast Asia. Swanstrom and CRS were heavily criticized by the Catholic Peace Fellowship (CPF) for concentrating their efforts in what was then South Vietnam. In 1967, CPF alleged that CRS' single largest food distribution program was being used by the U.S. and South Vietnamese governments as a pay program for South Vietnamese militiamen and their families. If so, said the CPF, Catholic Relief Services was merely an agent of American governmental policy rather than an impartial provider of needed services to the Vietnamese people.\nIn November 1967, Swanstrom stated that CRS was providing funding for humanitarian supplies to North Vietnam. Swanstrom in 1976 set up a special CRS fund to aid earthquake victims around Udine, Italy.The Vatican named him an assistant to the papal throne in 1977.\nDeath and legacy\nSwanstrom retired on March 20, 1978 and lived in New York City. He died at Lennox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on August 10, 1985, at age 82. He held honorary degrees from Catholic University, Iona College in New Rochelle, New York, and St. John's University in Queens.\nPublications\n* The Waterfront Labor Problem: A Study in Decasualization and Unemployment Insurance (1938) Fordham University Press, New York\n* Pilgrims of the Night: A Study of Expelled Peoples (1950) Sheed and Ward, New York\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D71E38F937A2575BC0A963948260  Bishop Edward Swanstrom; Directed Catholic Aid Group (August 14, 1985)]\n*[http://www.crs.org Catholic Relief Services Website]"
