But I like the way Zevon resists pigeonholes like 'country-rock' while avoiding both the banal and the mystagogical, and I like quatrains like: 'And if California slides into the ocean/Like the mystics and statistics say it will/I predict this motel will be standing/Until I pay my bill.'\"\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Warren Zevon.\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n*Warren Zevon – harmonica, piano, rhythm guitar, string arrangements, vocals\n*Jackson Browne – harmony vocals on tracks 2, 3 & 11, piano on track 10, slide guitar on track 3\n*Lindsey Buckingham – guitar on track 3, harmony vocals on tracks 5 & 7\n*Rosemary Butler – harmony vocals on track 10\n*Jorge Calderón – harmony vocals on tracks 8 & 11\n*Marty David – bass guitar on track 3\n*Ned Doheny – guitar on track 10\n*Phil Everly – harmony vocals on tracks 1 & 4\n*Glenn Frey – rhythm guitar on track 9, harmony vocals on tracks 6 & 9\n*The Gentlemen Boys – background vocals on track 11\n*Bob Glaub – bass guitar on tracks 1, 2, 4–7 & 9–11\n*Don Henley – harmony vocals on track 6\n*Billy Hinsche – harmony vocals on track 11\n*Bobby Keys – saxophone on tracks 5, 7 & 10\n*David Lindley – banjo on track 1, fiddle on tracks 1, 2 & 5, slide guitar on tracks 4 & 7, guitar on track 9\n*Gary Mallaber – drums on tracks 3 & 8\n*Roy Marinell – bass guitar on track 8\n*Stevie Nicks – vocals on track 7 & 10\n*Bonnie Raitt – harmony vocals on track 10\n*Fritz Richmond – jug on track 8\n*Sid Sharp – strings on tracks 4, 6 & 11\n*JD Souther – harmony vocals on tracks 2 & 11\n*Waddy Wachtel – guitar, vocals\n*Carl Wilson – harmony vocals on track 11, vocal arrangements\n*Jai Winding – piano on track 5, organ & synthesizer on track 10, vocals on track 11\n*Larry Zack – drums on tracks 1, 2, 4–7 & 9–11\n*The Gentlemen Boys consisted of: Jackson Browne, Jorge Calderón, Kenny Edwards, JD Souther and Waddy Wachtel.\nProduction\n*Producer: Jackson Browne\n*Engineer: Fritz Richmond\n*Mixing: John Haeny\n*Arranger: Warren Zevon\n*Vocal Arrangement: Carl Wilson\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Chart performance for Warren Zevon\n!Chart (1976)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Top LPs & Tape\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|189\n|}\nReferences"
