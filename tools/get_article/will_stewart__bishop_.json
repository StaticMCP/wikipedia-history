He was also, at 6&nbsp;feet 7&nbsp;inches, one of its tallest.\nStewart was educated at Uppingham and Trinity College, Cambridge (where he gained a Cambridge Master of Arts {MA Cantab}). Made a deacon at Michaelmas 1968 (29 September) and ordained a priest the Michaelmas following (28 September 1969), both times by John Taylor, Bishop of Sheffield, at Sheffield Cathedral; he was a curate at Ecclesall then Cheltenham. Following this he was Vicar of St James, Gloucester then Rector of St Mary Magdalene, Torquay. A sideways move to St Mark, Oulton Broad'' led to promotion to be Rural Dean of Lothingland and finally, before his appointment to the episcopate, a Canon of Norwich Cathedral.\nReferences"
