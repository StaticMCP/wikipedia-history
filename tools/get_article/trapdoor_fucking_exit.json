The staff described the album as \"the sound of three newly freed New Zealanders wrestling with the implications of punk-primitive aesthetics in the wake of US/Euro free jazz ground leveling. Two broken guitars and a rapid-firing drummer, playing lead, singlehandedly redefined the concept of garage punk without any considerations of melody, rhythm or fidelity.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAdapted from Trapdoor Fucking Exit liner notes.\n;The Dead C\n* Michael Morley&nbsp;– guitar, vocals\n* Bruce Russell&nbsp;– guitar, drums\n* Robbie Yeats&nbsp;– drums, guitar\n;Additional musicians\n* Chris Heazlewood&nbsp;– additional guitar (3, 4, 7–10)\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
