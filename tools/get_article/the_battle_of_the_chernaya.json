      "text": "# The Battle of the Chernaya\n\nThe Battle of the Chernaya (Italian: La battaglia della Cernaia) is an 1857 history painting by the Italian artist Gerolamo Induno.  It depicts the Battle of the Chernaya fought on 16 August 1855 during the Crimean War. The action was the last major attempt to break the Allied Siege of Sevastopol  by the Russian Army. The Russian strategy to rapidly overwhelm the French positions was thwarted by fierce opposition from Bersaglieri from Kingdom of Sardinia, allowing the Allies forces to rally and drive them off.\nThe Italian Expeditionary Force had arrived a few months earlier to bolster the Anglo-French army sent to assist the Turks.the resistance of the Sardinian forces became\na symbol of pride for the emerging Italian nation. The painting was purchased by Victor Emmanuel II. Today it is in the  collection of the Gallerie di Piazza Scala in Milan.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Cipolla, Constantino.
