      "text": "# Russo-Crimean Wars\n\nThe Russo-Crimean Wars were fought between the forces of the Tsardom of Russia and the Crimean Khanate during the 16th century over the region around the Volga River.\nIn the 16th century, the Wild Steppes in Russia were exposed to the Khanate. During the wars, the Crimean Khanate (supported by the Ottoman army) invaded central Russia, devastated Ryazan, and burned Moscow. However, the next year they were defeated in the Battle of Molodi. Despite the defeat, the raids continued. As a result, the Crimean Khanate was invaded several times, and conquered in the late 18th century. The Tatars eventually lost their influence in the regions.\nThe raids began shortly after the establishment of the Russian buffer state, Qasim Khanate, and the domination of Russia in the Russo-Kazan Wars of the late 15th century.\nHistory\n.]]\nThe Crimean invasions of Russia began in 1507, after the death of Moscow's grand duke Ivan III, with the Crimean Khanate attacking the Russian towns of Belev and Kozelsk.\nOver the course of the 16th century, the outer border of the Wild Steppes was near the city of Ryazan, outside the Oka River. The main path for the invading forces to Moscow was the Muravsky Trail, running from the Crimean Isthmus of Perekop, between the basins of the Dnieper and Seversky Donets rivers, and finally up to Tula. The Tatars would turn back only after extensive looting and kidnapping, the Tartars usually managed to penetrate 100–200 kilometers into Russian territory. Captives were subsequently sent to the Crimean city of Caffa to be sold into the Crimean slave trade. As a result, the Russian population in the border regions suffered heavily.\nEach spring, Russia mobilized up to several thousand soldiers for border service. The defensive lines consisted of a circuit of fortresses and cities.\nTo protect from invasions by the Nogai Horde in the region between the Volga and Ural\nrivers, the Volga cities of Samara (1586), Tsaritsyn (1589), and Saratov (1590) were founded.\nThe most damaging invasions occurred in 1517, 1521 (supported by the Khanate of Kazan), 1537 (supported by the Khanate of Kazan, the Lithuanians, and the Ottoman Empire), 1552, 1555, 1570–72 (supported by Sweden and the Ottoman Empire), 1589, 1593, 1640, 1666–67 (supported by Poland–Lithuania), 1671, and 1688.\nRusso-Crimean wars of 1571–1572\nFire of Moscow (1571)\nIn May 1571, the 60,000-strong Crimean and Ottoman army (40,000 Tatars, 13,000 irregular Turks, and 7,000 janissaries) led by the khan of Crimea Devlet I Giray, and Big and Small Nogai hordes and troops of Circassians, bypassed the Serpukhov defensive fortifications on the Oka River, crossed the Ugra River, and rounded the flank of the 6,000-man Russian army. The sentry troops of Russians were crushed by the Crimeans. Not having forces to stop the invasion, the Russian army retreated to Moscow. The rural Russian population also fled to the capital.\nThe Crimean army devastated unprotected towns and villages around Moscow, and then set fire to suburbs of the capital. Due to a strong wind, the fire quickly expanded. The townspeople, chased by a fire and refugees, rushed to the northern gate of the capital. At the gate and in the narrow streets, there was a crush, people \"went in three lines went on heads one of another, and top pressed those who were under them\". The army, having mixed up with refugees, lost order, and general prince Belsky died in a fire.\nWithin three hours, Moscow burnt completely. In one more day, the Crimean army, sated with its pillage, left on the Ryazan road to the steppes. Contemporaries counted up to 80,000 victims of the invasion in 1571, with 150,000 Russian taken as captives. Papal ambassador Possevin testified of the devastation: he counted in 1580 no more than 30,000 inhabitants of Moscow, although in 1520 the Moscow population was about 100,000.\nBattle of Molodi (1572)\nAfter the burning of Moscow, Devlet Giray Khan, supported by the Ottoman Empire, invaded Russia again in 1572. On 26 July 1572 the huge horde of the khan, equipped with cannons and reinforced by janissaries, crossed the Oka River near Serpukhov, decimated the Russian vanguard of 200 men, and advanced towards Moscow in order to pillage it once again. Little did they know, however, that the Russians had prepared for the second invasion, setting up innovative fortifications just beyond the Oka river. The Cirmean Tatars were this time repelled. After the battle, only 20,000 Tatar horsemen returned to the Crimea, while the khan left his tent and banner on the battlefield and barely managed to escape alive.\nAfter 1572\nDespite the defeat of the Crimean Tatars at Molodi, the raids against Russia continued until the Russo-Turkish war of 1768–1774. The Russian expansion turned to the Black Sea region and the Crimean Khanate was invaded several times in the 18th century and finally annexed in 1783.\nIncomplete list of Tatar raids\nThis list does not include raids into Poland-Lithuania (75 raids during 1474–1569)\n*1507: defeat of the Crimeans who marched on Moscow.\n*1507 and 1514: the raids led by Tatar nobles, avoiding a peace agreement held by the Khan.\n*1517: unsuccessful Crimean raid into Russia, upon arrival, the Crimeans lose 15,000 people.\n*1521: Khan and 50,000 men cross the Oka at Kolomna and ravage outskirts of Moscow for 2 weeks.\n*1521: the unsuccessful  by the Crimean troops; after the defeat at Pereyaslavl-Ryazansky (Ryazan), the Crimean troops leave Russia.\n*c. 1533: Abatis defense line about 100&nbsp;km south of the Oka.\n*1533–1547 (regency for Ivan IV): some 20 large raids on the frontiers.\n*1541: Crimean Khan crosses the Oka river on rafts under covering fire from Turkish guns.\n*1552: Crimean campaign of Tula.\n*1555: the defeat of 60,000 troops of the Crimean Khanate in Battle of Sudbischi.\n*1562, 1564, 1565: the khan lead a large army into Muscovy.\n*1559: the Russians are ravaging the north of the Crimean Khanate and they are being released those who were taken into slavery.\n*1556–1559: the Russians and Zaporozhians raid the Black Sea coast four times.\n*1564: the city of Ryazan posad was burned.\n*1570: Russo-Turkish War (1568–1570)\n*1571: Russo-Crimean War (1571)\n*1572: Battle of Molodi\n*1575: Ivan IV requests Zaporozhian Ataman Ruzhynsky to launch Crimean Campaign.\n*1591: the defeat of the Crimean troops near Moscow, this was the last campaign in which the Crimean troops reached Moscow.\n*1598: the Crimeans stopped by Bank Line, withdraw and sue for peace.\n*1614: Nogai raids within sight of Moscow.
