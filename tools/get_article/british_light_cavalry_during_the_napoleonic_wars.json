These new units proved so useful in the Seven Years' War, that in 1763 the 15th Dragoons were converted into 'light dragoons', as were the 17th–20th.  By 1798 this arm had increased to some 23 regiments: the 7th–14th Dragoons had been converted, and 15 new regiments had been raised and retained in service.  The 30th–33rd Light Dragoons had been raised in 1794, but with Britain's eviction from Europe in 1795, they were disbanded again in early 1796.  No details of their uniforms are known, and it is very doubtful they ever reached full strength.  In 1806, the 7th, 10th, and 15th Dragoons were also \"converted\" - or rather \"re-costumed\" - to light dragoons.\nUniforms (standard)\nIn 1784 these light cavalry regiments changed their red coats for dark blue and the helmet assumed the form known as the \"Tarleton\", with black fur crest, turban in the facing colour, and the regimental badge on the left-hand side.\nList of regiments in 1768\n* 15th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons — dark blue facings, white buttons in pairs, with white small clothes\n* 16th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons — dark blue facings, white buttons in pairs, with white small clothes\n* 17th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons — white facings, white buttons in pairs, with white small clothes\n* 18th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons — white facings, white buttons in pairs, with white small clothes\nNapoleonic Wars\nBackground\nIn 1803 the 10th Light Dragoons \"converted to hussars\".  This conversion consisted mainly of sartorial changes: they abandoned the Tarleton helmet for the winged cap (mirliton), adopted the fur-lined pelisse, the barrel sash and the Mongolian Bock saddle.  Forty Baker Rifles were issued to them, making them the first British cavalry regiment to use rifled weapons.  In general, however, the old bicorns of the light dragoons and the Tarletons of the hussars were replaced by the shako at this time.\nUniforms (standard)\nEach regiment wore a facing colour on collar, cuffs, and turnbacks.  Pink seems to have been an unpopular facing colour: the 21st was given permission to change to black in 1814, and the 22nd to white in the following year.\n1812 uniform changes\nLight Dragoons\nIn 1812 the French-style shako was introduced for the light dragoons.  It had a black-within-white frontal cockade, regimental loop and button, traditional white over red plume and top band and chin scales in the button colour.  The tunics were also changed from a dolman to a short-skirted double-breasted tunic in dark blue with facings shown on the collar, lapels, cuffs, turnbacks and piping around the pocket.  The tunic was in a completely lancer-style fashion with the coloured lapels folded back in imitation of Napoleon's Polish Lancers.  The men even wore a waist belt or sash with two dark blue stripes on a backing colour, and in the small of the back they had the \"waterfall\" of the lancers.  White breeches or grey overalls were worn on campaign with twin stripes in the facing colour.\nHussars\nHussars wore a brown fur busby with red bag (except the 18th, which had blue).  Dolman, lace, facings, and buttons were as before, a dark blue pelisse with a red and yellow barrel sash was worn by the men, crimson and gold for the officers.\nin officer's uniform of the 7th (Queen's Own) Hussars during the Napoleonic era.
