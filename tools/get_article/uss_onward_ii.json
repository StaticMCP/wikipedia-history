The U.S. Navy acquired her from her owner, W. S. Forsythe, on 23 June 1917 for World War I service as a patrol vessel and commissioned her on 25 June 1917 as USS Onward II (SP-728).\nFor the rest of World War I, Onward II performed routine harbor patrol duties at Newport, Rhode Island. In 1918 she was renamed USS SP-728.\nSP-728 was returned to her owner on 2 December 1918.\nOnward II should not be confused with the patrol vessel USS Onward (SP-311), in commission from 1917 to 1919.\nReferences\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20020805183003/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-civil/civsh-o/onward2.htm Department of the Navy: Naval Historical Center: Online Library of Selected Images: Civilian Ships: Onward II (American Motor Boat, in service in 1917).
