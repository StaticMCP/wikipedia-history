The family moved to Denmark in 1936. James studied at Oxford University, graduating with a Master of Arts degree. He entered the family business (for which, among others, Finn Juhl had designed products) in 1957. The firm was sold in 1966, at which point France started a chain of toy stores. He wrote a book about his father's firm, France & Søn, in 2016.\nHistorian of the Cistercian Order\nFrance returned to scholarship after retiring; his interest in the Cistercian Order had begun at Oxford. He wrote books on the Cistercians in Scandinavia (1992) and monks of the same order in medieval art (1998). He received a doctorate in 2002 from the University of Roskilde, having written a dissertation on The Medieval iconography of St Bernard of Clairvaux c. 1135 - c. 1530. It was published in 2007 as Medieval images of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. 2012 saw the publication of a book on Cistercian lay brothers. France was made a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1998.\nPublications\n* The Cistercians in Scandinavia. Cistercian Publications, Kalamazoo, Mich. 1992.
