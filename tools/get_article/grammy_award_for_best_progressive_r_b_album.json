Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the Recording Academy of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nThis category was one of the three newly created categories for the 55th Annual Grammy Awards as Best Urban Contemporary Album. In June 2020, the Recording Academy announced a renaming and redefining of the category. Its new name was Best Progressive R&B Album, with immediate effect, \"to appropriately categorize and describe this subgenre. This change includes a more accurate definition to describe the merit or characteristics of music compositions or performances themselves within the genre of R&B.\"\nAdding to this, the description of this category is now as follows: \"[t]his category is intended to highlight albums that include the more progressive elements of R&B and may include samples and elements of hip-hop, rap, dance, and electronic music. It may also incorporate production elements found in pop, euro-pop, country, rock, folk, and alternative.\"\nAccording to Recording Academy president Harvey Mason Jr. in the same press release, these changes reflected \"the current state of the music industry and how it's evolved over the past 12 months.\" In the weeks leading up to this decision, the label \"urban\" to indicate music made by African American musicians, songwriters and producers had come under fire.\nThe award goes to the artist, producer and engineer/mixer, provided they are credited with more than 50% of playing time on the album. A producer and engineer with less than 50% of playing time, as well as the mastering engineer, can apply for a \"Winners Certificate\".\nControversies\nSome African American musicians have disputed the use of the term \"urban contemporary\", seen as a \"catchall for music created by Black artists, regardless of genre\". In a backstage interview given after his first Grammy win (for Best Rap Album), artist Tyler, the Creator stated that \"[i]t sucks that whenever we — and I mean guys that look like me — do anything that's genre-bending or that's anything, they always put it in a rap or urban category\", adding that \"I don't like that 'urban' word — it's just a politically correct way to say the n-word to me\".\nRecipients\nwas the first recipient in 2013]]\nis the first artist to win this award twice, in 2016 and 2018]]\nis the first female artist to win this award twice, in 2017 and 2019]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"7%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Performing artist(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Work\n! width=\"35%\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2013\n| Frank Ocean\n* James Ryan Ho, Frank Ocean and Om'Mas Keith, producers; Jeff Ellis, James Ryan Ho and Frank Ocean, engineers/mixers\n| Channel Orange\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2014\n| Rihanna\n* Kuk Harrell, producer; Kuk Harrell, Manny Marroquin and Marcos Tovar, engineers/mixers\n| Unapologetic\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2015\n| Pharrell Williams\n* Pharrell Williams, producer; Andrew Coleman, Mick Guzauski and Mike Larson, engineers/mixers\n| Girl\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2016\n| The Weeknd\n* Carlo \"Illangelo\" Montagnese and the Weeknd, producers\n| Beauty Behind the Madness\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2017\n| Beyoncé\n* Beyoncé, producer; Stuart White, engineer/mixer\n| Lemonade\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2018\n| The Weeknd\n* Cirkut, Doc McKinney and the Weeknd, producers; Serban Ghenea, John Hanes, Doc McKinney and Josh Smith, engineers/mixers\n| Starboy\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2019\n| The Carters\n* The Carters, producers; Gimel \"Young Guru\" Keaton and Stuart White, engineers/mixers\n| Everything Is Love\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2020\n| Lizzo\n* Ricky Reed, producer; Manny Marroquin and Ethan Shumaker, engineers/mixers\n| Cuz I Love You (Deluxe)\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2021\n| Thundercat\n* Flying Lotus and Thundercat, producers; Daddy Kev and Flying Lotus, engineers/mixers\n| It Is What It Is\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2022\n|  Lucky Daye\n* Dernst \"D'Mile\" Emile, producer; John Kercy, engineer/mixer\n| Table for Two\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2023\n| Steve Lacy\n* Steve Lacy, producer; Neal H Pogue and Karl Wingate, engineers/mixers\n| Gemini Rights\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2024\n| SZA\n* Rob Bisel and Carter Lang, producers; Rob Bisel, engineer/mixer\n| SOS\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2025\n| AverySunshine\n| So Glad to Know You\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| NxWorries\n| Why Lawd?\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2026\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|}\nEach year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.\nArtists with multiple wins\n;2 wins\n* Beyoncé (one as The Carters)\n* The Weeknd\nArtists with multiple nominations\n;4 nominations\n* Terrace Martin\n;3 nominations\n* Beyoncé (one as The Carters)\n* Steve Lacy (one with The Internet)\n* Miguel\n;2 nominations\n* Jhené Aiko\n* Durand Bernarr\n* 6lack\n* Chris Brown\n* Chloe x Halle\n* Childish Gambino\n* Robert Glasper\n* Cory Henry\n* Kehlani\n* Anderson Paak\n* Rihanna\n* SZA\n* The Weeknd\nSee also\n* Grammy Award for Best R&B Album\n* Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album\n* Progressive soul\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.grammy.com Official site of the Grammy Awards]"
