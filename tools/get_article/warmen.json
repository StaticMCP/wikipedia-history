      "text": "# Warmen\n\nWarmen is a Finnish heavy metal band assembled by keyboardist Janne \"Warman\" Wirman. Wirman had played with Children of Bodom since 1997, and in 2000 created the neoclassical/melodic power metal project Warmen focused on instrumental work in the first two albums, with the next three albums heavily relying on guest singers. In 2023, the band added full-time singer Petri Lindroos and moved towards a melodic death metal style similar to Children of Bodom.\nHistory\nUnknown Soldier (1999–2001)\nThe first incarnation of Warmen was composed of Janne Wirman, guitarist Sami Virtanen and drummer Mirka Rantanen. This line-up recorded and released the Unknown Soldier album in 2000, with the collaboration of guest singer Kimberly Goss (from Sinergy), guitarist Roope Latvala (also from Sinergy, later also from Children of Bodom) and bassist Jari Kainulainen (from Stratovarius).\nBeyond Abilities (2002–2004)\nThe following year, the band saw the addition of Lauri Porra (later in Sinergy and Stratovarius) and Janne's guitarist brother, Antti Wirman (from Kotipelto). In the Warmen Productions Studio (now called Beyond Abilities), this line-up recorded the album Beyond Abilities, which received positive reviews. With a more diverse use of vocals, this album made use of the talent of Timo Kotipelto (from Stratovarius), Pasi Nykänen (from Throne of Chaos) and returning vocalist Kimberly Goss.\nAccept the Fact (2005–2006)\nTheir third album, Accept the Fact was released in June 2005 and features vocals by Timo Kotipelto, Marko Vaara, Jonna Kosonen and Alexi Laiho from Children of Bodom. Alexi performs clean vocals in \"Somebody's Watching Me\" (originally by Rockwell), which is rare, since in Children of Bodom he has performed clean vocals in only one song, a cover of \"Rebel Yell\", originally by Billy Idol. The spoken words on the first track \"Accept the Fact\" are taken from the movie Amadeus, spoken by the character Antonio Salieri.\nJapanese Hospitality (2008–2010)\nThe fourth Warmen album, titled Japanese Hospitality, was released on 24 August 2009 via Spinefarm Records. The 10-song effort includes two cover versions — \"Separate Ways\", originally recorded by Journey, and \"Black Cat\" by Janet Jackson, featuring a guest appearance by the Finnish pop/rock singer Jonna Kosonen. Other guest musicians that appear on the CD include Alexi Laiho (Children of Bodom) and Pasi Rantanen (ex-Thunderstone).\nFirst of the Five Elements (2014)\nOn 9 July 2014, Warmen started a campaign on PledgeMusic to have fans help fund the production of the album, titled First of the Five Elements. This campaign was successful and the album was released on that same year. The album was re-issued in 2023 due to PledgeMusic's bankruptcy, resulting in a limited number of physical copies released.\nStylistic change, Here for None and Band of Brothers (2023–present)\nIn late March 2023, the band announced drummer Mirka Rantanen was leaving the band and was being replaced by Seppo Tarvainen. A few weeks later, the band announced Petri Lindroos of Ensiferum as the band's first vocalist. This change would see the band move towards a melodic death metal style similar to Children of Bodom. On 31 May 2023, the band announced their sixth album, Here for None, which was released on 18 August, and is their first album in this new style.\nOn 19 May 2025, the band announced their seventh album, Band of Brothers, which was released on 15 August.\nBand members\nCurrent members\n* Janne Viljami Wirman – keyboards\n* Antti Wirman – guitars\n* Jyri Helko – bass guitar\n* Seppo Tarvainen – drums\n* Petri Lindroos – vocals, guitars\nFormer members\n* Mirka Rantanen – drums\n* Sami Virtanen – guitars\n* Lauri Porra – bass guitar\nTimeline\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:1\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1999\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2000\nColors =\nid:vocals  value:red       legend:Lead_vocals\nid:guitar  value:green     legend:Guitar\nid:bass    value:blue      legend:Bass\nid:drums   value:orange    legend:Drums\nid:keys    value:purple    legend:Keyboards\nid:lines   value:black     legend:Studio_album\nid:other   value:gray(0.5) legend:Other_releases\nLineData =\nat:02/24/2000 color:black layer:back\nat:10/29/2001 color:black layer:back\nat:07/06/2005 color:black layer:back\nat:08/26/2009 color:black layer:back\nat:09/30/2014 color:black layer:back\nat:08/17/2023 color:black layer:back\nat:08/15/2025 color:black layer:back\nBarData =\nbar:Petri    text:\"Petri Lindroos\"\nbar:Sami     text:\"Sami Virtanen\"\nbar:Antti    text:\"Antti Wirman\"\nbar:Lauri    text:\"Lauri Porra\"\nbar:Jyri     text:\"Jyri Helko\"\nbar:Mirka    text:\"Mirka Rantanen\"\nbar:Seppo    text:\"Seppo Tarvainen\"\nbar:Janne    text:\"Janne Wirman\"\nPlotData=\nwidth:11\nbar:Petri      from:04/13/2023 till:end        color:vocals\nbar:Petri      from:04/13/2023 till:end        color:guitar width:3\nbar:Antti      from:01/01/2000 till:end        color:guitar\nbar:Sami       from:start      till:06/15/2009 color:guitar\nbar:Lauri      from:01/01/2000 till:06/15/2009 color:bass\nbar:Jyri       from:06/16/2009 till:end        color:bass\nbar:Mirka      from:start      till:03/24/2023 color:drums\nbar:Seppo      from:03/24/2023 till:end        color:drums\nbar:Janne      from:start      till:end        color:keys\n}}\nDiscography\nAlbums\n* Unknown Soldier (2000)\n* Beyond Abilities (2001)\n* Accept the Fact (2005)\n* Japanese Hospitality (2009)\n* First of the Five Elements (2014)\n* Here for None (2023)\n* Band of Brothers (2025)\nCompilations\n*The Evil That Warmen Do (2010)\nSingles\n* \"Alone\" (2001)\n* \"Somebody's Watching Me\" (2005)\n* \"Warmen Are Here for None\" (2023)\n* \"Hell on Four Wheels\" (2023)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* (archived)\n*"
