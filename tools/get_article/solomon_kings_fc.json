At least one club from the Solomon Islands had expressed interest when the process began. Clubs had until June 2025 to submit their applications to the confederation for consideration with eight slots available for clubs from around Oceania and Australia available for the first season. In early July 2025, Jeremiah Manele, Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, announced that the national government, Solomon Islands Football Federation, and Australian club Wynnum Wolves had created a partnership to create the Solomons' first professional club, Solomon Kings, with the goal of playing in the region's new professional league. The club was expected to improve health and well-being in young people; develop the sport in the Solomon Islands; and provide pathways to higher leagues, including to Borussia Dortmund through Wynnum Wolves' partnership. Wynnum Wolves had been connected with football in the Solomon Islands since the mid-1990s when the club traveled to the nation to tour and play exhibition matches. At the time of announcement, Solomon Kings was one of only two that had publicly announced their desire to join the league, along with Wellington Phoenix.\nSolomon Kings's application was the only inquiry submitted to the OFC from the Solomon Islands. However, the club would still need to demonstrate that it met all of the confederation's professional club licensing requirements. On 29 August 2025, the OFC announced its list of eight \"preferred\" clubs which had tentatively been accepted into the league. The clubs would have to pass a final stage of the licensing and compliance process before the season kicked off in January 2026 to receive final approval. Prior to the announcement, newly announced Chairman Don Marahare indicated that the club would need financial assistance and planned to reach out to the governments of Australia and the China for support. On 28 October 2025, It was revealed that the Solomon Kings were accepted and were listed among the final 8 teams that will play in the OFC Pro League.\nIdentity\nThe club's name is an homage to biblical King Solomon for whom the country is named. The club's colors of yellow and black mirror its partner club Wynnum Wolves.\nDomestic history\n;Key\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#FDFD07;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" ! scope=\"col\"| Season\n! colspan=\"8\" ! scope=\"col\"| League\n! rowspan=\"2\" ! scope=\"col\"| Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"|Div.\n! scope=\"col\"|Pos.\n! scope=\"col\"|Pl.\n! scope=\"col\"|W\n! scope=\"col\"|D\n! scope=\"col\"|L\n! scope=\"col\"|P\n! scope=\"col\"|Playoffs\n|-\n|2026\n|rowspan=\"1\"| OFCPL\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|align=center|\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.facebook.com/SolomonKingsFC?mibextid=wwXIfr&rdid=PO2mhajp36IBhgEV&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2F19nservxMj%2F%3Fmibextid%3DwwXIfr# Official Facebook]"
