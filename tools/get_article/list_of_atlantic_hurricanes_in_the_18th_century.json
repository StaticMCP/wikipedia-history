Although not all of the data for every storm that occurred are available, some parts of the coastline were populated enough to provide data of hurricane occurrences.\n}}\n1700–1724\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Area(s) affected\n! Date\n! Deaths\n! Damage/notes\n|-\n| 1700\n| Charleston, South Carolina to Virginia\n|\n| 98\n| Rising-Sun Hurricane of 1700. A hurricane struck the South Carolina coastline while the Rising-Sun, a Scottish warship, was prevented from entering Charleston Bay from the Atlantic by a sandbar across the mouth. It had already been badly damaged by a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, being dismasted, and was seeking repairs. The ship, passengers and crew were returning to Scotland from a failed Scottish attempt to establish a colony at Darien (what we now call Panama). The crew was in the process of 'lightening the ship', to gain entry to the bay, and as part of that, 15 passengers were taken ashore in a small boat. In the ensuing hurricane, the ship was thrust up on the beach, broken up, and all left aboard were drowned. The only survivors from the ship were those who had gone ashore earlier and ended up having to bury the dead on the beach the next day. Ships docked in the harbor at Charleston were also wrecked. Charleston was devastated and flooded by this ferocious hurricane.\n|-\n| 1700\n| Barbados\n|\n|\n| N/A\n|-\n| 1702\n| Barbados\n|\n|\n| N/A\n|-\n| 1703\n| Virginia, Maryland to New England coastline\n|\n| N/A\n| Great wind and flood damage; many ships were lost.\n|-\n| 1703\n| England, British Isles\n|\n| Many thousands\n| The Great Storm of 1703. This was the most powerful wind force ever experienced in modern English history, causing more death and destruction than any known storm before or after. One-third of the British Navy fleet sunk during this storm, which likely originated from an Atlantic-based hurricane.\n|-\n| 1705\n| Havana Cuba to southeast coast of Florida\n|\n| Many were lost\n| 4 ships lost\n|-\n| 1706\n| Barbados to New York to Connecticut\n|\n|\n| Strong wind and heavy rains were reported in NY (14th) and CT (16th). Unusual and heavy flooding occurred in many areas in NY and CT.\n|-\n| 1706\n| Offshore of Virginia coast\n|\n| N/A\n| A hurricane at sea - an England-bound fleet of ships from America was scattered by a raging hurricane at sea. Many ships had to return to Virginia for repairs after the hurricane while other ships were lost at sea. No landfall is believed to be known.\n|-\n| 1707\n| St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat to St. Thomas\n|\n| N/A\n| Nevis was \"nearly ruined\" and several ships were wrecked off the coast of St. Kitts.\n|-\n| 1707\n| St. Augustine, Florida\n|\n| N/A\n| Heavy flooding and damage\n|-\n| 1708\n| Veracruz\n| N/A\n| 578\n| N/A\n|-\n| 1712\n| Barbados to Cuba and Jamaica\n|\n| 400\n| Many houses destroyed\n|-\n| 1712\n| Barbados\n|\n|\n| N/A\n|-\n| 1713\n| Lesser Antilles, Martinique, Guadeloupe to St. Thomas to Puerto Rico\n|\n| 100 in Martinique\n| San Zacarias Hurricane of 1713. Caused a storm surge in southern Puerto Rico.\n|-\n| 1713\n| North of Antigua to Charleston, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia\n|\n| Many\n| Carolina Hurricane of 1713. Charleston was once again inundated by the sea (see 1700). The death toll was reportedly significant and resulted from the high storm surge that washed in with the storm. On Sullivan's Island, \"The new lookout made of wood, built eight square and eighty feet high, was blown down.\" In Charleston's harbor, all but one of the vessels were driven ashore and \"all the front wall and mud parapet before Charlestown [were] undermined and washed away.\" The two rivers on both sides of the town were connected for a period of unknown time during the storm. The storm was reportedly more violent in the north of Charleston, suggesting that landfall was made north of the town. The effects were most prominent in Currituck County, North Carolina, near the Virginia-North Carolina border, where the storm surge breached the Outer Banks and opened several inlets into the Currituck Sound. William Byrd, one of the commissioners who established the Virginia-North Carolina boundary, stated: \"There was no tide in Currituck until 1713 when a violent storm opened a new inlet five miles south of the old one. One of the new inlets carved out by the storm became the location where the Virginia-North Carolina line begins on the Atlantic coast.\"\n|-\n| 1713\n| Puerto Rico\n|\n|\n| Hurricane San Cándido of 1713. Caused a lot of storm damage in the south coast.\n|-\n| 1713\n| Jamaica to Bermuda\n|\n|\n| N/A\n|-\n| 1714\n| Florida Keys\n| Late June\n| Many drowned\n| Many ships sank\n|-\n| 1714\n| Guadeloupe\n|\n|\n| N/A\n|-\n| 1714\n| Barbados to Jamaica\n|\n|\n| Tropical storm\n|-\n| 1715\n| Bahamas, Florida East Coast\n|\n| 1000–2500\n| Florida Treasure Coast Hurricane of 1715. Occurred near southeastern Bahamas and straits of Florida. Due to numerous delays, the fleet of twelve ships did not depart from Havana, Cuba, until late. Once the heavy-laden treasure ships turned into the Bahamas channel, they encountered northeasterly winds. The hurricane overtook the fleet as it emerged from the Bahamas channel. Three ships sank in deep water; the remainder were driven to the Florida coast wrecked on the rocks and reefs just north of present-day Vero Beach. The fleet captain Spanish Admiral Don Juan de Ubilla drowned in the storm along with more than a thousand other sailors. See 1715 Treasure Fleet and Florida Treasure Coast. The surviving sailors tried to live on the uninhabited Florida coast where their ships had wrecked. After the sinking of the ships, the Spanish government tried to recover some of the treasure, some of which they were able to, though most remains unclaimed to this day. This area off of the Florida coast would be named the \"Treasure Coast\" for the millions in gold, silver, and jewels these ships from this fleet took down with them from this storm.

Moved through the Lesser Antilles on September 11. This hurricane is the first tropical storm to strike the region for which there are adequate first-hand accounts and almost completely destroyed the city's fragile existing infrastructure. The storm made landfall in Louisiana on September 23 with 15 hours of hurricane winds and an 8-foot storm surge flooding. Hurricane force winds lasted 15 hours. In 1718,  high levees protected New Orleans from both river and tidal overflow (today they are  high). The buildings in New Orleans suffered extensive destruction, but they were not of high-grade construction; instead, they had been hastily constructed when New Orleans was initially selected to be the capital of the Louisiana Company in 1717-18. The bayou between New Orleans and Biloxi was filled with  of water as a result of the storm, and all ships at the port were destroyed. Rainfall and flooding were reported to have lasted for five days. The French occupied Spanish settlement at Santa Rosa Island, Florida offshore from Pensacola was swept away by storm surge. This storm was responsible for moving Mobile from its old site  north of the mouth of the Mobile River to its present-day site. This same storm likely re-curved northeast and headed into South Carolina as they reported three days of flooding rains in South Carolina around the 27th.\n|-\n| 1722\n| Charleston, South Carolina\n|\n|\n| Tropical storm\n|-\n| 1723\n| North of Antigua to New York City\n|\n|\n| N/A\n|-\n| 1723\n| Rhode Island\n|\n|\n| N/A\n|-\n| 1724\n| Virginia, Maryland and Chesapeake Bay\n|\n| N/A\n| The Great Gust of 1724. Almost all tobacco crops and much of the corn crops were destroyed by this violent tropical storm, which struck the Chesapeake Bay. Violent floods of rain and prodigious gusts of wind were seen upon the James River. Some homes were wrecked, and several vessels were driven ashore. The storm was likely followed by a second hurricane just five days later, which caused rain for many straight days that caused the Virginia floods of 1724.\n|-\n| 1724\n| South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania\n|\n|\n| Second of two hurricanes that passed through the area within five days. Another violent storm system came through affecting Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania with violent winds, flooding, and rain. This system and the Great Gust of 1724 systems are among the most significant tropical storms to affect the Mid-Atlantic during the colonial period of the late 1600s and 1700s.\n|-\n| 1724\n| Hispaniola\n| September 12\n| 121\n| Caused the sinking of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe and El Conde de Tolosa (ship) in Samaná Bay carrying 400 tons of quicksilver from Spain.\n|}\n1725&ndash;1749\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n!

All but one warship in a Spanish fleet were sunk off the coast. Ships in the New Orleans harbor were pushed well inland, causing heavy damage. Many houses in New Orleans were destroyed, many ships were sunk and trees knocked down. William Dunbar, who happened to be in New Orleans at this time, estimated that the center of the hurricane passed directly over New Orleans. Dunbar wrote that nearly half of the houses in New Orleans were either blown down or lost roofs and that every boat on the Mississippi river had disappeared from the storm. From this hurricane experience in 1779, Dunbar first uncovered the true nature of tropical storms and hurricanes that a hurricane revolves around a vortex in the center and had progressive forward movement. He presented his findings to the American Philosophical Society in 1801.\n|-\n| 1779\n| August 28-September 3\n| Martinique to offshore South Carolina\n| \"Many\"\n| Martinique on August 3\n|-\n| 1779\n| December 3\n| Atlantic coast\n| 120\n| N/A\n|}\n1780s\nThe 1780 Atlantic hurricane season was extraordinarily destructive and was the deadliest Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history with over 25,000 deaths. Four different hurricanes, three in October and one in June, caused at least 1,000 deaths each; this event has never been repeated and only in the 1893 and 2005 seasons were there two such hurricanes. The season also held the deadliest Atlantic tropical cyclone of all time.\nAdditionally, 1780 was a turning point in Caribbean habitation and trade, marking the end of a long period of economic boom that started in the early 1500s and marked the beginning of an economic decline for the region as news of the devastating hurricanes spread. Eight different storms battered the West Indies including three killer storms in the month of October alone. Tens of thousands were killed across the Caribbean onshore from storm surge, powerful winds and many thousands more killed offshore on sunken ships. The hurricanes struck the Caribbean in the midst of the American Revolutionary War as British and French navies were vying for control over the region and the hurricanes did considerable damage to both fleets wrecking numerous ships and drowning many.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n!

As many of the town's residents gathered at the coast to see the large waves coming in, a 20-foot surge came in engulfed the onlookers, docked ships, and many of the town's buildings. In the nearby port village of Lucea, 400 people and all but two structures perished, with 360 people also killed in the nearby town of Montego Bay. It would go on to sink the British frigate Phoenix (killing 200 of its crew), the Monarch with its crew and several hundred Spanish prisoners onboard, and ships-of-the-line Victor, Barbadoes, and Scarborough and crippled many others.

See List of deadliest Atlantic hurricanes.\nOn October 10, the hurricane destroyed the island of Barbados with winds possibly exceeding  which would make it an extreme category 5 strength hurricane, leaving the island completely decimated with nearly all its buildings and plantations destroyed. The town of Bridgetown in Barbados was completely destroyed. The force of the winds was so intense that most of the island's trees were knocked down and the ones that remained standing had their bark stripped off. It also severely affected St. Vincent and Grenada. The hurricane then moved to Saint Lucia, Martinique, and St. Eustatius. Coming in the midst of the American Revolution, the storm caused heavy losses to British and French fleets in conflict in the area. The hurricane later passed near Puerto Rico and over the eastern portion of Hispaniola. There, it caused heavy damage near the coastlines and then sank 50 ships in Bermuda.
