There is no reception equipment available to view the broadcast, but it gives the concept of a teletext service carrying software on some of its pages great practical credibility. This broadcast is observed on a public demonstration teletext television at the BBC Pebble Mill studio in Birmingham by the kind help of a member of BBC staff. The software is for a Signetics 2650 microprocessor.\n* 1978\n** ITV's teletext service ORACLE launches.\n* 1979\n** 14 May –  BBC Ceefax begins broadcasts a telesoftware broadcast on Ceefax page 192. The software is written in a specially designed machine independent object code (1456 object code, in speech \"fourteen fifty-six object code\") with the idea that the object code could be used in a virtual machine so that a telesoftware decoder could use a microprocessor of the choice of the manufacturer of the decoder thus providing fairness of opportunity for manufacturers of microprocessors.\n1980s\n* 1980\n** 12 March – The very first in-vision Ceefax transmission is broadcast. It is shown on BBC1 between 8:30am and 9am. A short time later, two 30-minute broadcasts, usually aired at 10am and 3:30pm, begin on BBC2. The output showcases various aspects of the Ceefax service, with a digest of news, sport, weather, TV listings and other topics. The in-vision broadcasts are designed to help promote the Ceefax service and what it offers, along with teletext in general. The broadcasts, called Ceefax in Vision, are not referred to in the Radio Times or on newspapers’ television listings pages.\n* 1981\n** October – National Teletext Month takes place.
