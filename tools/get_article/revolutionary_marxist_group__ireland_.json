Many of the initial group had formerly been in the Young Socialists, along with some others who attended discussion meetings (such as Charlie Bird and Butch Roche) but who tended to drop off later when the RMG name was adopted and democratic centralism set in.\nIn 1972, they joined with a loose grouping in Belfast to form the Revolutionary Marxist Group, mainly under the influence of\nD.R. O'Connor Lysaght (known as Rayner Lysaght) and Anne Speed, Brendan Kelly, Betty Purcell. In 1974, the organisation affiliated to the USFI. The RMG campaigned against internment in Northern Ireland and took part in\nseveral public protests against it.\nJournal\nThe theoretical journal of the group was Marxist Review.  The group focused on supporting a united Ireland and on gaining influence in the student movement. The RMG rejected the Éire Nua plan put forward by Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Dáithí Ó Conaill, arguing EN was \"too tied to the bourgeoisie\". Marxist Review also criticised the ideas advocated by the conservative Irish writer Desmond Fennell, arguing that \"Fennellism\" is essentially idealistic and ultra-clerical\". They also accused Fennell of being anti-feminist and anti-trade union.\nViews\nThe RMG was strongly pro-feminist, and RMG members took part in the \"Irishwomen United\" group in 1976, along with members of People's Democracy and the Irish Republican Socialist Party. \"Irishwomen United\" was a left-wing, anti-clerical, radical feminist group that called for the legalisation of contraception and abortion, equal pay for Irish women, and secular community-controlled schools.\nChange\nIn 1976, the group changed its name to the Movement for a Socialist Republic. Between 1977 and 1978 the MSR began fusion talks with People's Democracy. In November 1978 the two groups fused, adopting the name People's Democracy. In 1981 People's Democracy was recognised as the Irish Section of the Fourth International.\nPublications\n* Towards a History of the Communist Party of Ireland by Donal Raynor O'Connor Lysaght (1972).\nDublin; Revolutionary Marxist Group.\n*  The E.E.C. and Ireland (1972) Dublin : Plough Book Service for Revolutionary Marxist Group.\n* Irish Nationalism and British Imperialism by Robert Dorn (1973).
