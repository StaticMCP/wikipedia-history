The Holkar artillery, led by Roshan Beg, attacked them with a long line of 63 cannons. At one point, the British were on the verge of losing the battle. However, they were helped by Gafur Khan, a traitor in the Holkar camp. Khan deserted the battlefield with the force under his command. After this, the Holkars were decisively defeated.\nMalhar Rao III, Tatya Jog and others escaped to Alot. A peace treaty was signed on 6 January 1818 at Mandsaur. The Holkars accepted all the terms laid down by the British in the Treaty of Mandsaur. At the conclusion of this Third Anglo-Maratha War, the Holkars lost much of their territory to the British and were incorporated into the British Raj as a princely state of the Central India Agency.\nThis battle led to the final destruction of Maratha power. Baji Rao II, who was trying to consolidate Marathas, finally surrendered in June 1818. The British abolished the position of the Peshwa (prime minister), and the Marathas were limited to the small kingdom of Satara until its annexation into Bombay state in 1848.\nFile:Battlefield of Mehidpur from Seepra.jpg|Battlefield of Mahidpur from the Shipra River, December 1817.\nFile:Battle of Mehidpoor 1st position, 21 Dec 1817.jpg|Plan of the Battle of Mahidpur, 21 December 1817.\nFile:Mehidpur, Capturing Holkar guns.jpg|Capturing Holkar guns.\nReferences"
