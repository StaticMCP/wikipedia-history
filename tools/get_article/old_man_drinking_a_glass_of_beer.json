The 35-second, single-shot film shows comedian Tom Green, according to Bryony Dixon of BFIfilms, \"performing what is known as a 'facial', that is a piece direct to camera showing changing facial expressions. The ability to get close up to the star was a great advantage that film had over the stage and early filmmakers were keen to exploit it.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrRKm_V0lZU Movie on YouTube]"
