      "text": "# Battle of the Belly River__disambig_1\n\nThe Battle of the Belly River was the last major conflict between the Cree (the Iron Confederacy) and the Blackfoot Confederacy, and the last major battle between First Nations on Canadian soil.\nThe battle took place within the present limits of the city of Lethbridge on the banks of the Oldman River, which was then called the Belly River. A devastating outbreak of smallpox had reduced the strength of the Blackfoot, and a Cree war party had come south in late October 1870 to take advantage of that weakness. An advance party of Crees had stumbled upon a Peigan camp and decided to attack instead of informing the main Cree body of their find. Soon word passed to other Blackfoot, Blood and Peigan camps in the immediate area, and warriors were sent to join battle. After several hours of trading shots, a Blackfoot party gained the high ground and made the Cree positions untenable. The retreat became a rout, and up to 300 Cree warriors were killed trying to make their escape.\nMore significant than the outcome of the battle is the fact that it is perhaps the best-covered inter-tribal fighting of all time given the number of eyewitnesses it produced. Above all, it is believed to be the last significant inter-tribal battle in North America. The clash does not refer to a single organized engagement but consists of many scattered encounters in the valley of the Oldman River. The Blackfoot, after having significantly reduced their numbers in a ghastly smallpox epidemic that killed over 2,200 of their people, repulsed the Cree and Assiniboine attackers, who had hoped to exploit the incidence by launching a full-scale raid against the Blackfoot.\nApproximately a year after the battle, the Cree and Blackfoot made a formal peace. That was formalized by Crowfoot, a Blackfoot chief, ritually adopting Poundmaker, an up-and-coming Cree leader in 1873. Treaty No.7, between the Blackfoot Confederacy and the Crown, was signed in 1877. In 1906, the town of Lethbridge was founded near the battle site. The battle itself is commemorated in Indian Battle Park.\nAfter the battle, the region’s politics changed. In January 1871, just months after the fight, the Cree extended an olive branch to the Blackfoot with a gift of tobacco and an informal peace. That was formalized in the fall of the same year on the Red Deer River. A monument in Wetaskiwin now commemorates the peace between the Blackfoot and Cree Nations. The battle marked the end of inter-tribal warfare and the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the First Nations, a peace that has lasted to this day.\nSee also\n*Fort Whoop-Up\n*Jerry Potts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://shrineodreams.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/the-battle-of-belly-river/ The Shrine of Dreams]"
