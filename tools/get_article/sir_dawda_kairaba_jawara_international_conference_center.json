The project began in 2017 and inaugurated in January 2020. The construction of the part was controversial because it the construction removed important land from the Bijilo Forest Park, a popular tourist location and natural space home to endangered Western red colobus monkeys.\nThe conference center was built and funded by Chinese investment of US$50 million in the country. The center was treated as an important international gesture between the two countries, the first collaborative project since resumption of relations. The center was built in part to host the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The first major event in the space was the Annual General Meeting of the African Development Bank in August 2020.\nThe center was named after Dawda Kairaba Jawara, the first president of The Gambia.\nReferences"
