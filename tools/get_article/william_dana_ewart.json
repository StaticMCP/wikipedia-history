The metal chain \"linked belt\" replaced the leather and strap belts used on agricultural equipment at the time.\nEwart was inducted into the Association of Equipment Manufacturers Hall of Fame\nin 1996 at CONEXPO-CONAGG.\nHistory\nInvention of linked-belt drive chain\nIn 1874, William (Will) Dana Ewart sold farm implements in Belle Plaine, Iowa. He saw metal drive-chain belts on harvesters would break, requiring difficult repairs and delaying harvests.\nEwart invented a new version using detachable links -- a \"linked belt.\" Farmers could carry extra links into the field and then quickly repair a broken drive chain.\nThe new drive chain was useful far beyond farm equipment, integrating into any machinery transmitting power via a sprocket and chain. In 1875, Ewart and investors founded the Ewart Manufacturing Company to manufacture the new \"Ewart Detachable Link-Belting\" and matching sprockets.\nExpansion into coal and materials handling\nEwart quickly found customers requesting help engineering and constructing industrial facilities, especially coal-handling systems. During this time, coal fueled almost everything. Railroads especially used huge amounts of coal to power steam engines.\nTo serve the market, Ewart founded founded two new companies. In 1880, he created Link-Belt Machinery in Chicago, \"to design, build, and supply accessory parts, and install elevating and conveying machinery employing Ewart chains.\"\nThen in 1888, he formed Link-Belt Engineering in Philadelphia. This company built a plant in Philadelphia's Nicetown neighborhood.\nBy 1894, the three companies had constructed facilities for railroads including the New York Central and Hudson, the Philadelphia and Reading, and the Chicago and West Michigan. (See [https://digital.hagley.org/AVD_1982_301_001 circa 1894 marketing booklet].)\nLink-Belt coal-handling cranes\nDuring this period, cranes and excavators shared many similarities. Huge steam shovels and steam cranes operated from railroad chassis. Workers laid rail tracks where the shovel was expected to work, then repositioned as required. Link-Belt Machinery quickly developed a steam-powered crane for wide-gauge rails. It used a clamshell-bucket for coal-handling. As shown in the photo at the right, the crane had a large house-like structure mounted on its rail chassis. The middle house-like structure held a steam engine like those used for locomotives.\nThrough the turn of the century, Link-Belt expanded its line of steam-powered, heavy-duty coal-handling cranes. The company also expanded into lighter, more versatile rail-based cranes.\nRetirement, death and legacy\nDeclining health and hife in Italy\nBy the early 1900s, Link-Belt had moved well beyond its initial drive-chain origins. Ewart was leading several companies.  As he became increasingly ill, Ewart mostly retired and moved to Italy.\nMove to Chicago and consolidation to a single company\nLikely as part of Ewart's retirement, in 1906 the three Link-Belt companies consolidated into one publicly traded organization: the Link-Belt Company headquartered in Chicago. Charles Piez, who had started at Link-Belt as a Nicetown-based engineer-draftsman, became company president.\nDeath in Italy and legacy\nEwart died in Rome on May 3, 1908. The Association of Equipment Manufacturers inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 1996 at CONEXPO-CONAGG.\nEwart's Link-Belt companies live on as Link-Belt Cranes and LBX Link-Belt Excavators.\nReferences"
