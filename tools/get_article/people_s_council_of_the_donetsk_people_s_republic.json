According to the official results, the political party Donetsk Republic, which includes the Communist Party of the Donetsk People's Republic, gained a majority of the seats in the Council with the 68,53% and 68 seats. Free Donbas, which includes the Russian-nationalist New Russia Party, gained the 31.65% and 32 seats.\nThe body is presided over by the Chairman of the People's Council. The position was first held by Andrey Purgin but he was stripped of his position and detained under charges of disrupting and attempting to destabilize a meeting. Denis Pushilin succeeded Purgin on 4 September 2015 and stayed in office until 14 December 2018 when he was replaced by Olga Makeeva. Soon after she was succeeded by Vladimir Bidyovka on 20 November 2018.\nIn 2016, blogger Stanislav Vasyn described the parliament as an absurd and mock structure.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
