It was the first Mnet Asian Music Awards to take place outside of South Korea. They also aired on a Sunday, which means performers had to choose between SBS' The Music Trend show or the awards ceremony.\nBroadcast\n* South Korea: Mnet\n* Cambodia: MyTV\n* China: SMG, Channel V Mainland China\n* Hongkong: TVB J2, TVBM\n* Japan: Mnet Japan, Music On!
