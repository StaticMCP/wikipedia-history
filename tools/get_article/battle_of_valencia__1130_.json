The Almoravids were victorious.\nBackground\nThe city of Valencia has been a major target for the Aragonese king, Alfonso the Battler. The Aragonese sent raids to the vicinity of Valencia to establish an Aragonese influence there. In 1129, the Almoravids suffered a major defeat at Cullera by the Aragonese, who were besieging Valencia. Despite their victory, they failed to capture the city for unknown reasons.\nBattle\nIn early May 1130, the Aragonese launched another raid into the vicinity of Valencia, a sizeable army led by Gaston of Béarn and the Bishop Stephen of Huesca. News of this raid soon reached the city, and the governor of Valencia, Yintan bin al-Lamtuni, a rather energetic governor, left with his army to meet them. Both sides clashed with each other near the city, and the Almoravids successfully defeated the invading army. Both Gaston and Stephen met their ends on the battlefield. Gaston's body was found, and his head was cut. It was sent to the city of Granada to be paraded on a spear through the streets and later sent to Marrakesh.\nAftermath\nAfter this victory, Yintan was rewarded with the governorship of Seville. Later, the Aragonese king had to make a peace treaty with the Almoravids, which they accepted.\nReferences\nSources\n*Bernard F.
