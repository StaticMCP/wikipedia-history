The first released title was an adventure game titled Ghost in the Sheet. The studio was then inactive for a few years and its members worked on titles such as Dark Fall II: Lights Out, Barrow Hill and Tale of a Hero.\nIn 2011, the studio was renamed to CBE Software. A year later, it released two games – J.U.L.I.A. and J.U.L.I.A. Untold. These games were exclusively published by Lace Mamba Global who didn't pay them and the publishing agreement was cancelled. The studio came to financial troubles and so released another game titled Vampires!\nIn March 2013, the Indiegogo for J.U.L.I.A. Among the Stars (originally titled J.U.L.I.A. Enhanced Edition) was launched. The goal was $5,000 but $14,120 was raised. It was released on 12 October 2014. It is a remake of the original J.U.L.I.A. with different gameplay and story.\nGames\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ All games by CBE Software\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title !! Year !! Platform(s) !!
