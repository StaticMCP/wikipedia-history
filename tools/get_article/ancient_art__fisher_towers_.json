There are four summits known as the North Summit (highest), Corkscrew Summit, Middle Summit, and Kient Art Summit. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises  above terrain in 0.2 mile (0.32&nbsp;km). Precipitation runoff from the tower drains to Onion Creek which empties into the Colorado River, approximately three miles to the west. Access is via Fisher Towers Road from Route 128, and hiking on the Fisher Towers Trail.\nClimbing\nThe first ascent of the summit was made June 11, 1967, by Herbie Hendricks and Dennis Willis via the  Hippie Route on the North Summit.\nRock-climbing routes on Ancient Art:\n* Hippie Route -  – Herbie Hendricks, Dennis Willis – (1967)\n* Stolen Chimney (Corkscrew Summit) - class 5.10 – Paul Sibley and Bill Roos – (1969)\n* Purebred (Middle Summit) - Harvey T. Carter, Dave Erickson, Ken Wyrick – (1971)\n* Adjacent Art (Kient Art Summit) - class 5.8 – Pete Takeda, Eric Kohl – (1996)\nGeology\nAncient Art is set on an eroded fin and is composed of 290 million years old sandstone, mudstone, and conglomerate of the Permian Cutler Formation. The reddish coloration of the rock is a result of varying amounts of hematite.\nClimate\nSpring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Ancient Art. According to the Köppen climate classification system, it is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone with cold winters and hot summers. Summers highs rarely exceed . Summer nights are comfortably cool, and temperatures drop quickly after sunset. Winters are cold, but daytime highs are usually above freezing. Winter temperatures below  are uncommon, though possible. This desert climate receives less than  of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.\nSee also\n* Fisher Towers\nGallery\nFile:Fisher towers - Ancient Art - 05.jpg|The Corkscrew summit\nFile:Fisher towers - Ancient Art - 06.jpg|Climber on the Corkscrew\nFile:Ancient Art - Fisher Towers.jpg|Kingfisher and Ancient Art\nFile:Fisher Towers (52672531977).jpg|Kingfisher/Ancient Art to left, Cottontail to right\nFile:Fisher Towers - Utah.jpg|Fisher Towers L→R: Kingfisher, Ancient Art, Cottontail, Titan.\nFisher Towers Cliffs (52673530658).jpg|Kingfisher and Ancient Art\nFile:The Corkscrew of Antient Art.jpg|The Corkscrew summit\nFile:Fisher towers - Ancient Art - 13.jpg|South aspect of Ancient Art centered, Kingfisher upper right\nFile:Fisher Towers area, near Moab, Utah…note the climbers!!
