He is the brother of fellow manager Will Still and video analyst Nicolas Still. He was raised in English and went to a French school in Walloon Brabant.

In the meantime, he studied at Loughborough University, Université catholique de Louvain, KU Leuven and Erasmus University Rotterdam.\nIn September 2015, he became assistant of Croatian manager Ivan Leko, initially as video-analyst at Sint-Truiden, but thereafter he followed Leko as assistant at Club Brugge. When Leko was coach at Al Ain, Still went on to work as a project manager at Vlerick Business School and as an analyst on the RTBF football talk show La Tribune. In May 2020, Still rejoined Leko's staff at Antwerp, then Shanghai Port in early 2021.\nCharleroi\nIn May 2021, Still returned from China to start his first job as lead manager at age 30, at Charleroi, where he succeeded Karim Belhocine.

His final result was a 4–1 loss at Cercle Brugge.\nEupen\nIn November 2022, Still became the manager of Eupen, also in the top division. After the 2022 FIFA World Cup, his debut was a late 1–0 win away to Seraing on 23 December. He was sacked on 25 April after taking 12 points from a potential 51; his final two games were lost 5–1 at home to Zulte Waregem and 7–0 at Club Brugge.\nKortrijk\nStill began the 2023–24 season as manager of Kortrijk, and was the first manager sacked, on 25 September.
