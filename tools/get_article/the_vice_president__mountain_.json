The Vice President was named Mount McNicoll in 1904 by Edward Whymper after David McNicoll, the VP of the Canadian Pacific Railway.  In 1907, the mountain was renamed by the Alpine Club of Canada, after it was discovered that the name had already been used on a mountain near Rogers Pass.\n__NOTOC__\nRoutes\nThere appears to be only one route up the Vice President—up the President glacier to the col, then up a snow slope to the ridge, then to the peak.\nGallery\nFile:Expeditions organized or participated in by the Smithsonian Institution..
