      "text": "# 1984 Holy Cross Crusaders football team\n\nThe 1984 Holy Cross Crusaders football team was an American football team that represented the College of the Holy Cross as an independent during the 1984 NCAA Division I-AA football season. The Crusaders ranked No. 15 nationally and did not qualify for the postseason.\nIn their fourth year under head coach Rick E. Carter, the Crusaders compiled an 8–3 record. Bill McGovern and Peter Muldoon were the team captains.\nAs in the previous year, Holy Cross began the campaign with a long winning streak (seven games), and was ranked as high as No. 2 in the weekly national rankings. Two late-season losses to Division I-AA foes, however, dropped them out of the upper echelon. Their third loss, in a game played after the final rankings were released, was to Division I-A powerhouse Boston College on the day that BC quarterback Doug Flutie won the Heisman Trophy.\nHoly Cross played its home games at Fitton Field on the college campus in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n| September 22 |   | UMass | 5\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 35 7\n| 17,641 |\n| September 29 | @ | Harvard | 4\n| Harvard Stadium | Boston, MA | W 24 14\n| 19,500 |\n| October 6 |   | Dartmouth | 3\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 30 20\n| 19,061 |\n| October 13 | @ | #12 Colgate | 2\n| Andy Kerr Stadium | Hamilton, NY | W 42 27\n| 9,500 |\n| October 20 |   | Connecticut^ | 2\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 41 0\n| 20,659 |\n| October 27 | @ | Brown | 2\n| Brown Stadium | Providence, RI | W 38 17\n| 12,843 |\n| November 3 | @ | #13 Boston University | 2\n| Nickerson Field | Boston, MA | L 12 16\n| 14,750 |\n| November 10 |   | #4 New Hampshire | 6\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 13 14\n| 12,441 |\n| November 17 | @ | Maine | 19\n| Alfond Stadium | Orono, ME | W 24 7\n| 3,000 |\n| December 1 |   | Boston College | 15\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA (rivalry) | L 10 45\n| 25,000 |\n}}\nReferences"
