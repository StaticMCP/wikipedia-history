      "text": "# Draft:A Century After Nanook\n\n----\nA Century After Nanook is a 2025 documentary film directed and co-produced by Kirk French, an American anthropologist, and co-produced by Neal Hutcheson and Sarah Samisack. The documentary was filmed to honor the 100th anniversary of Nanook of the North, a 1922 silent ethnographic film by Robert J. Flaherty. As opposed to the original film, which was a staged docufiction, A Century After Nanook prioritized the perspectives of the Inuit, allowing them to tell their stories both as the film's subjects and as co-creators.\nFilming\nA Century After Nanook began filming in Inukjuak, Nunavik, Canada in August 2020.\nFrench began collaborating with the Inuit of Inukjuak in November of 2019, with the intended goal of releasing A Century After Nanook on Nanook of the North's 100th anniversary. Due to complications with the COVID-19 pandemic, French's initial filming and travel plans were delayed. Instead, camera equipment was shipped to Inukjuak in July 2020. Portions of the documentary were also shot using cellphone video captured by local community members. French would later travel to Inukjuak to continue production after the pandemic, interviewing local Inuit community members. Interviews were also filmed by Samisack, an Inukjuak native and co-producer on the documentary. The documentary combines archival footage from the original film alongside interviews with local Inukjuak residents and climate change scientists in order to examine the environmental and cultural changes in the Nunavik region over the last century.\nA Century After Nanook premiered on October 19, 2024 at Inukjuak’s Pinguavik Recreation Centre. It would later be released to wider audiences on March 1, 2025, where a screening of the documentary was held at Pennsylvania State University.\nReferences"
