Jackson and his force of about 2,000 men (about 1,200 infantry and 800 cavalry) were camped at Ten Islands on the Coosa River, near the present day Neely Henry Dam. The Creeks under command of Weatherford numbered about 700 warriors.  A few white men and about 150 allied Indians were inside a small stockade named Fort Leslie (it is often called Fort Lashley mistakenly). Fort Leslie was built around the trading post of a Mr. Leslie.\nBattle\nOn November 9, 1813, Jackson's army arrived outside the village.  The Red Sticks inflicted 17 casualties on Jackson's forces.  Jackson inflicted 299 casualties on the Red Sticks and drove them from the field.\nAftermath\nCasualties for the Creeks numbered about 300 killed and about 110 wounded. Jackson's casualties numbered 15 killed and around 85 wounded. After the battle, there was a significant lull in the fighting between the Red Sticks and Jackson's army.  By December, the U.S. force was down to almost 500 because of desertion and enlistments running out. In January, in order to support the Georgia militia, Jackson marched toward the village of Emuckfaw with an inexperienced force. This move resulted in the battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek. After these battles Jackson retired to Fort Strother. When Jackson received additional reinforcements (some of the regular U.S. troops), he once again went on the offensive and met the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.\nNotes\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/national_parks/horseshoe_bend_war_1813-14.jpg A map of Creek War Battle Sites] from the PCL Map Collection at the University of Texas at Austin.\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=CksTAAAAYAAJ&q=weatherford&pg=PA86 Holy Ground & William Weatherford]"
