Players who are made to fall are eliminated from the game. The game ends once one team has all of its players eliminated, with the other team then winning the game.\nVariations of tag\nKabaddi\nKho-kho\nKho-kho is traditional for some people in Punjab and Sindh.\nWanjh wati\nWanjh wati is traditional to Sindh.\nBaraf Paani\nPlayers become frozen in place when tagged by an opponent, but are unfrozen by the touch of a teammate.\nOonch Neech\nLangri Pala\nPlayers attempt to tag opponents while hopping on one foot.\nJee\nJee is a traditional Balochi game in which one team attempts to send one player at a time from one area to another without being tagged out by the opponents.\nBandar killa\nBefore the game starts, a coin toss-like process known as pugan pugayee is done, in which three players are chosen randomly and are asked to face one of their hands either upwards or downwards; if one of the player faces their hand in the opposite direction of the other two players, then that player is eliminated from this process; this repeats until finally, one player in the last group of three faces their hand in the opposite direction of the other two players, with this last player being chosen as the \"monkey\" (bandar). Once the monkey is chosen, the other players place their footwear around a tree or similar object; a rope is then bound to the tree, with the monkey required to hold the rope and continuously run around the tree. The other players then attempt to retrieve their footwear, but if any player is tagged by the monkey, play restarts and the tagged player becomes the new monkey. If all of the footwear is successfully retrieved, then the monkey is forced to run to a designated area away from the tree, while the other players are allowed to throw the footwear at the monkey. Play then restarts with all players continuing in their roles.\nBoard games\nCarrom\nAnimal events\nChirpiest Partridge\nVarious caged partridges are placed next to each other, with the chirpiest of them winning the day's contest.\nTent pegging\nSee also\n* Traditional games of South Asia\n** Traditional games of Afghanistan\n** Traditional games of Bangladesh\n** Traditional games of India\n** Traditional games of Nepal\n** Traditional games of Sri Lanka\n*All-Punjab Games\nNotes\nReferences"
