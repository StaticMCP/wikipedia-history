In 1958, she played Mario's girlfriend in the comedy Next to No Time.\nIn 1959, Buckingham played the eponymous role in the film Sapphire about a young woman found murdered on Hampstead Heath, but she did not have a speaking part and appears only briefly, as a dead body and in photographs.\nFollowing her uncredited role in Our Man in Havana (1959), Buckingham enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. In 1960, Buckingham graduated with a diploma in acting.\n1960s\nBuckingham had prominent roles in two 1961 films, A Question of Suspense and Murder in Eden. As a result, she forfeited £4,000 which might have been paid from an insurance policy she took out in 1958 when she was aged 20, against failure to become a star within five years.\nIn 1962, she had a minor background role as \"pretty girl\" in the Neo Noir film, The Frightened City. In 1963, Buckingham played the lead role in The Keeler Affair, a film about Christine Keeler. Before Buckingham had secured the role, it was offered to Keeler who accepted it but because the Actors Equity did not accept her application, it meant that the other cast members could not perform with her.\n1970s and 80s\nIn the late 1980s, she had a role in the Marcio Kogan, Isay Weinfeld directed film, Fogo e Paixão, which was a film about a bus tour through São Paulo where strange people are encountered. One of the tourists, a Japanese man called Kankeo (played by Ken Kaneko), filmed the event and shows it to his friends when he returns home.\nPersonal life\nIn 1965, Buckingham married Belgian-Brazilian businessperson  in London. The couple subsequently  moved to São Paulo and had four children before later divorcing.\nBuckingham has served as the social director on the São Paulo Branch of the  English-Speaking Union Brazil members committee.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1957\n| Robbery Under Arms\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1958\n| Grip of the Strangler\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Next to No Time\n| Mario's girlfriend\n| Uncredited\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Blood of the Vampire\n| Serving Wench\n| Uncredited\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Passport to Shame\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1959\n| ''The Captain's Table\n| Yvonne, chosen life-jacket volunteer\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Room at the Top\n| Girl at tote window\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| No Trees in the Street\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Sapphire\n| Sapphire Robbins\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Desert Mice\n| Waitress\n|\n|\n|-\n| Our Man in Havana\n| Striptease girl\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Urge to Kill\n| Gwen\n| Season 1, episode 1\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1960\n| The Tell-Tale Heart\n| Mina\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1961\n| The Frightened City''\n| Pretty girl at 'Taboo Club'\n|\n|\n|-\n| The Sinister Man\n| Miss Russell\n|\n|\n|-\n| Murder in Eden\n| Vicky Wolf\n|\n|\n|-\n| A Question of Suspense\n| Jean Forbes\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1962\n| Solo for Sparrow\n| Jenny\n|\n|\n|-\n| A Kind of Loving\n| Barmaid\n|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1963\n| The Keeler Affair\n| Christine Keeler\n| Title role\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1972\n| Missão: Matar\n| Iracema Freire Campos\n| Directed by .
