The park is located in east Buffalo and bisected by Fillmore Avenue.\nThe park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The park is on a , slightly L-shaped site and was originally conceived as a place for military displays and active children's sports. It contains four contributing structures: The brick Shelter House (1904), Buffalo Museum of Science building (1926), Greenhouse (1907), and Humboldt Park Casino (ca. 1926).\nHistory\nThe park was designed in 1874 by Frederick Law Olmsted and originally connected to Delaware Park via the Humboldt Parkway.  That connection was lost in the early 1960s with the construction of the Kensington Expressway.  The park originally contained a large wooden refectory, designed by Calvert Vaux; it was destroyed by fire in 1877.\nIn July 2009, a neatly manicured, tree-and flower-filled pedestrian pathway was unveiled by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy.\nSee also\n*Buffalo, New York parks system\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://buffaloolmstedparks.org/ Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy – Buffalo, NY, Western New York, WNY, Olmsted, Frederick Law]\n*[http://www.buffaloah.com/a/landmks/mlk/mlk.html Buffalo as an Architectural Museum, Martin Luther King Jr. Park]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060713062314/http://preserve.bfn.org/bam/kowsky/kowold/ Buffalo as an Architectural Museum, \"Municipal Parks and City Planning: Frederick Law Olmsted's Buffalo Park and Parkway System,\"] by Francis R.
