Tuco and Gonzo return immediately to the junkyard meetup site asking Walt to resuscitate No-Doze, who has died from his injuries. Gonzo hides the body under a car. Fearful of Tuco's violent and unpredictable manner, Walt develops a plan to poison Tuco with untraceable ricin. Hank reviews the security surveillance footage of the methylamine warehouse break-in. The DEA finds the bodies of both Gonzo and No-Doze in the junkyard after Gonzo accidentally bleeds out, which sets off a manhunt for Tuco. After receiving a picture of Gonzo's body from a jesting Hank, Walt mistakenly believes Gonzo was murdered by Tuco and becomes convinced that Tuco will come after him and Jesse. Skyler tells Hank about Marie's shoplifting, and learns she has already been receiving therapy for kleptomania. Seeing headlights outside his home window, Walt hurriedly leaves a confused Skyler to investigate, where he finds Jesse being held at gunpoint by Tuco. Tuco orders Walt to get in the car and they drive away.\n|LineColor = 135C6B\n}}\n|Viewers = 1.60\n|ShortSummary = Tuco takes Walt and Jesse at gunpoint to a remote desert hideout, where he takes care of his uncle Hector Salamanca, a former drug kingpin who is now incapacitated due to a stroke and can only communicate with a bell. Tuco explains that Hank and the DEA have rolled his entire organization. Unaware of Gonzo's death, Tuco believes Gonzo has ratted him out and becomes extremely agitated. Tuco voices his plan to take Walt to Mexico and run a covert cooking operation in the jungle. After several unsuccessful attempts to have Tuco ingest the ricin, Hector warns Tuco using his bell that Walt and Jesse are not to be trusted. Enraged, Tuco attacks and attempts to kill Jesse, but Jesse manages to shoot him in the torso and escape. Meanwhile, Skyler enlists Hank to help track down Walt. After Marie reveals that Walt has a second cell phone, Skyler mentions that Jesse had been supplying Walt with marijuana. After visiting Jesse's mother, Hank tracks Jesse's car to Tuco's hideout and gets into a shootout with Tuco, whom he kills in self-defense. Seeing Hank from a distance, Walt and Jesse bury the gun and run off into the desert.\n|LineColor = 135C6B\n}}\n|Viewers = 1.13\n|ShortSummary = Walt forms a plan to explain his and Jesse's disappearance and they split up to hitchhike back to the city. Walt goes to a supermarket alone, removes all his clothes, and wanders around the aisles feigning a disoriented state. He is hospitalized and claims to have no memory of the past several days. Walt is scheduled to undergo ongoing psychiatric evaluation, but is ultimately released after telling his psychiatrist that he simply wanted to be alone and faked his \"fugue state\" to cover this from his family. Jesse, who is now a fugitive, returns to his house and, with Badger's help, packs all of his lab equipment into the RV and arranges it to be towed. He then allows the DEA to find him in a motel room with a prostitute, with whom he claims to have been shacked up all weekend. Hank brings in Hector to identify him, but the old man refuses to cooperate with the authorities. Jesse is released, but the DEA confiscates all of his money.

Upon being confronted by the lot owner, Jesse steals the RV by driving through the locked gate. Walt tries to reconnect with Walt Jr. by giving him a driving lesson. Suspicious of Walt's actions, including his denial of having a second cell phone, Skyler begins going out all day and refuses to tell Walt of her whereabouts. An increasingly frustrated Walt continues to deny any wrongdoing. Jesse arrives at Walt's home and convinces him to give him half of their remaining money.\n|LineColor = 135C6B\n}}\n|Viewers = 1.21\n|ShortSummary = Walt continues his treatment and his condition improves, but he is concerned about the growing medical bills, which include the hospital visit in his \"fugue state\". Jesse begins to re-establish his life, paying off his debts and getting a new place to live. He develops an interest in his new next-door neighbor and landlord, Jane Margolis. Hank and the DEA come across the name Heisenberg, but are not sure if he is real or just an urban legend. Hank is promoted and appointed to a tristate drug task force, but experiences panic attacks due to his shootout with Tuco. Skyler and Marie reconcile over the tiara incident. As Walt and Jesse resume cooking, Jesse suggests they take over Tuco's role as a distributor to increase their profits; he recruits his friends Badger, Skinny Pete, and Combo as dealers.

In response, Gretchen calls Skyler and tells her that she and Elliott can no longer pay for Walt's treatment. Walt covers by telling Skyler that Gretchen and Elliott are insolvent, which Skyler believes. Meanwhile, Jesse tracks down the couple—a man named Spooge and his female partner—who ripped off Skinny Pete, but finds only their young and heavily neglected son at the house. Jesse makes the boy food and watches TV with him until the couple returns home with a stolen ATM, after which they incapacitate Jesse. Later, the female addict crushes Spooge's skull under the ATM after he repeatedly insults her.

Jesse is not providing product to his dealers, so Walt arranges to deliver it.

Badger is arrested in a sting operation by the Albuquerque police; Walt and Jesse hire a shady lawyer, Saul Goodman, who ensures that Badger will get off with a light sentence without having to give away Jesse or Walt's identity. Saul tells Walt and Jesse about an ex-convict named Jimmy, who makes a living being paid by other criminals to go to jail, and offers to have him stand in for Heisenberg. The DEA busts Jimmy when Badger gives them a fake deal, but Hank isn't completely convinced.

After Saul calculates the numbers, Walt realizes that there is not much money left for his family. With an excuse of visiting his mother, Walt and Jesse set off for the desert for a marathon cooking session over an extended weekend. During their trip, Jesse accidentally leaves the keys in the ignition, inadvertently draining the RV's battery. Walt and Jesse find themselves stuck in the middle of the desert, cold and without food or water. Walt's knowledge of chemistry again saves the day, as they build a makeshift battery providing enough power to jump-start the RV.

Realizing he is being copied, Walt orders them to stay out of his territory.\n|LineColor = 135C6B\n}}\n|Viewers = 1.29\n|ShortSummary = After Combo is murdered by a rival gang, Skinny Pete decides to quit the drug trade. With no distribution network, Saul proposes a new distribution method by putting Walt and Jesse in touch with a meth distributor named Gus Fring, who is the owner of a regional fast food chain called Los Pollos Hermanos. Gus agrees to purchase Walt's product, but expresses concern about Jesse's drug problem, warning Walt never to trust a drug addict. Distraught over Combo's death, Jesse tells Jane what he does for work. Jane later relapses into drug addiction and introduces Jesse to heroin. Skyler finds out that Ted has been engaging in tax evasion from the IRS, but decides not to report it due to their past relationship. Walt receives a large offer for the short-notice delivery of the remainder of their inventory, but at the same time receives a call from Skyler, notifying him of her imminent labor.\n|LineColor = 135C6B\n}}\n|Viewers = 1.19\n|ShortSummary = Walt delivers the inventory in time but misses his daughter's birth.

In an effort to minimize the cost of Walt's upcoming surgery, Walt Jr. sets up a website to gather donations for his father's medical expenses. It is quickly used by Saul as a way to launder Walt's earnings so they can be spent without raising suspicion. After discovering Jesse's payday, Jane blackmails Walt into delivering Jesse's share. Later, Walt returns to Jesse's and finds Jesse and Jane passed out in bed after a drug binge, both lying on their sides.

Walt's funds are funneled into his son's website, which attracts the attention of the media, causing him to be overcome with shame. Walt's secretive behavior becomes a problem once again when he accidentally references a second cell phone while under the initial effects of anesthesia moments before his surgery. This prompts Skyler to investigate deeper, thereby revealing many of Walt's lies, including not taking any money from Gretchen and never visiting his mother, which spurs her to leave him. Donald, an air traffic controller, is distraught by Jane's death and accidentally allows a mid-air collision to occur between an airliner and a small plane in the sky above Albuquerque. The crash results in debris, including a scorched pink teddy bear and human remains, raining down onto the Whites' residence, as well as much of the city.\n|LineColor = 135C6B\n}}\n}}\nProduction\nThe writers of Breaking Bad planned the storyline for the entire season in advance of filming and knew how the season would end right from the beginning. That differed from subsequent seasons, in which the writers did not have a complete plan and developed the storyline as the episodes progressed. Series creator Vince Gilligan said of season two, \"That came about through many, many hours of beating our heads against the wall—very laborious work, which is probably why we haven't repeated that formula since.\"\nMusic\nThe original score for Breaking Bad was composed by Dave Porter. The show also uses music from other recording artists with music supervision by Thomas Golubić. Selected songs from Season 2 are featured on the Breaking Bad soundtrack available through iTunes and Amazon.\nReception\nReviews\nThe second season of Breaking Bad received very positive reviews from critics, scoring 84 out of 100 on Metacritic. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the second season has an approval rating of 97% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Breaking Bad continues to soar, thanks to its artsy style and suspenseful thrills.\" Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker stated \"Bad is a superlatively fresh metaphor for a middle-age crisis: It took cancer and lawbreaking to jolt Walt out of his suburban stupor, to experience life again—to take chances, risk danger, do things he didn't think himself capable of doing. None of this would work, of course, without Emmy winner Cranston's ferocious, funny selflessness as an actor. For all its bleakness and darkness, there's  a glowing exhilaration about this series: It's a feel-good show about feeling really bad.\" San Francisco Chronicle's Tim Goodman claimed \"The first three episodes of Season 2 that AMC sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps. In fact, it looks as if Gilligan's bold vision for Breaking Bad, now duly rewarded against all odds, has invigorated everyone involved in the project. You can sense its maturity and rising ambition in each episode.\" Horror novelist Stephen King lauded the series, comparing it to Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger praised the season, calling it \"brilliant\". He lauded the sound design as well as the cinematography, enjoying the \"emphasis of beautiful desert vistas and disturbing tableaux\". He also compared the series to The Sopranos, more specifically on the similarity of Walter White and Tony Soprano and their respective reactions to similar situations. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News praised Cranston's performance of Walter White, calling him \"one of the best played characters on television\".\nAwards and nominations\nThe second season received numerous awards and nominations, including five Primetime Emmy Award nominations with two wins. Bryan Cranston won his second consecutive award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Lynne Willingham won her second consecutive award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series for \"ABQ\". The series received its first nomination for Outstanding Drama Series, Aaron Paul received his first nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and Michael Slovis was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a One Hour Series for \"ABQ\".\nCranston won the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama, with the series being nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Drama. Cranston won his second consecutive Satellite Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series, with the series winning the award for Best Drama Series. Aaron Paul won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television, with the series winning the award for Best Syndicated/Cable Television Series.
