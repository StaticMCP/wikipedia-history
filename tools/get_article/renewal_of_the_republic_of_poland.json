It was formed on 3 September 2021 by former Agreement MPs that decided to continue their support of Law and Justice government after the remainder of the party went into opposition. The leader of the group is Marcin Ociepa.\nDeputies\nAll deputies were elected on the United Right list\n* Marcin Ociepa: leader of the group.\n* Andrzej Gut-Mostowy\n* Grzegorz Piechowiak\n* Anna Dąbrowska-Banaszek\n* Agnieszka Ścigaj\n* Krzysztof Ciecióra\nIdeology\nThe group has been referred to as a pro-European \"deputy ministers union\" due to their apparent lack of political ideology and the fact that all but one of their MPs were deputy ministers in the Second Cabinet of Mateusz Morawiecki. The association is supposed to unveil their political program in the middle of November. Ociepa stated that \"the main five priorities of the party are security, economy, self-government, European policy and health policy, with a special opening to the young generation\".\nElection results\nSejm\n{| class=wikitable\n!
