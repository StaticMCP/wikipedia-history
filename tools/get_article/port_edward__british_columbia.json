It is situated on the Tsimpsean Peninsula, at Porpoise Harbour, near the southern end of Chatham Sound, close to the mouth of the Skeena River, 15&nbsp;km (9&nbsp;mi) southeast of Prince Rupert.\nDirections\nNorthwest of Port Edward is the City of Prince Rupert, northeast of Port Edward is the City of Terrace, and the unincorporated community of Thornhill, while the cities of Kitimat and Prince George are to the east.\nEconomy\nAt one time sustained by the numerous canneries in the area, transportation and construction are now the mainstays of the local economy.

The project was cancelled on July 25, 2017.\nDemographics\nIn the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Port Edward had a population of 470 living in 181 of its 207 total private dwellings, a change of |467|1}} from its 2016 population of 467.
