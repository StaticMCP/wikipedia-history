Nominations are submitted by Peruvians in categories which have varied since the award's establishment.\nHistory\nThe award was created on 30 September 1942 by Law No. 9614 and was presented by the Ministry of Education in twelve categories; the winners were announced on 28 July.\nIn 1966, the award was expanded to 18 categories. On 20 March 1974, by Decree Law No. 20561, it was reduced to six categories (Literature, Art, Social Communication, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and Applied Sciences and Technology) and was presented by the National Institute of Culture.\nThe award was discontinued after 1983, but then reinstated in 2012 with three categories:\n* Best Institutional Practices: recognition of a public or private entity, of national, regional or local scope, whose practice – in cultural management and promotion of art and culture, specifically – can serve as an example for other communities\n* Career: recognition of the person whose work and contribution to Peruvian and universal culture, as a creator, researcher or preserver, has been sustainable and productive over time, in constant variation and pursuit\n* Creativity: recognition of the most original and transcendent creator and/or researcher of Peruvian culture, who represents an innovative contribution to the panorama of their discipline and whose value can be recognized at the national level\nIn August 2019, the ministerial resolution governing the award was amended to remove the Creativity category, and to limit entries to the same fiscal year.\nWinners\n1942\n* Sculpture:\n* Journalism: Antonio Miró Quesada\n* Medicine: Hipólito Unanue\n* Philosophy and Education: Manuel González Prada\n* University Thesis:\n* Scientific Research and Essay: Daniel Alcides Carrión\n1944\n* Poetry:\n1945\n* Poetry: Jorge Eduardo Eielson\n1946\n* Painting:\n* Poetry: Martín Adán\n* Journalism:\n1947\n* Painting: Juan Manuel Ugarte Eléspuru\n1950\n* Painting:\n1952\n* Painting:\n* Philosophy and Education: Jorge Puccinelli Converso\n1953\n* Law: Remigio Pino Carpio\n* Music:\n* Poetry: Washington Delgado\n* Painting:\n1954\n* Music: Francisco Pulgar Vidal\n1955\n* Poetry: Demetrio Quiroz Malca\n* Journalism: Manuel Jesús Orbegozo\n1956\n* Scientific Research and Essay:\n* Pedagogy:\n* Poetry: Manuel Scorza\n1957\n* Novel: Mario Florián Díaz\n* Children's Literature: Cota Carvallo\n1958\n* University Thesis: José María Arguedas\n1959\n* Poetry:\n* Painting: Teodoro Núñez Ureta\n* Medicine: Javier Arias Stella\n* Novel: Esteban Pavletich Trujillo\n1960\n* Novel: Julio Ramón Ribeyro\n* Painting: Enrique Galdos Rivas\n1962\n* Poetry: Carlos Germán Belli\n* Scientific Research and Essay: Martha Hildebrandt\n* Novel: José María Arguedas\n1963\n* Pedagogy: Luis Jaime Cisneros\n* Poetry: Arturo Corcuera\n* Novel: Francisco Izquierdo Ríos\n1964\n* Poetry: Antonio Cisneros\n1965\n* Poetry:  and\n1966\n* Poetry:\n1967\n* Novel: Mario Vargas Llosa\n* Painting: Venancio Shinki\n* Journalism:\n1968\n* Novel:\n* Poetry:\n* History and Geography: José Antonio del Busto Duthurburu\n1969\n* Novel: Eduardo González Viaña\n* Poetry: Marco Martos Carrera\n* Scientific Research and Essay: Martha Hildebrandt\n1971\n* Poetry:  and\n1972\n* Novel: Alfredo Bryce Echenique\n* Children's Literature: Jorge Díaz Herrera\n1973\n* Novel:\n1975\n* Literature: César Calvo\n* Human Science: Jorge Basadre\n1976\n* Art:\n1977\n* Literature: Luis Alberto Sánchez and\n* Art:\n1980\n* Biological and Natural Sciences: Óscar Trelles Montes\n1983\n* Literature: Julio Ramón Ribeyro\n2012\n* Best Institutional Practices: \"Sand and Mats\" Association Workshop for Education and Communication through Art\n* Creativity:\n* Career: Gustavo Gutiérrez\n2013\n* Best Institutional Practices: Contisuyo Association\n* Creativity:\n* Career: Rodolfo Hinostroza\n2014\n* Best Institutional Practices:\n* Creativity:\n* Career: Francisco José Lombardi\n2015\n* Best Institutional Practices: National Registry of Identification and Civil Status\n* Creativity: Gonzalo Portocarrero\n* Career: Julio Cotler\n2016\n* Best Institutional Practices: Augusto N.
