Her family now lives in Middleham and is involved in horse racing; her father is a former jockey and horse trainer. As a child, she played football before her grandfather introduced her to golf and to her first coach. She attended the University of New Mexico, graduating with a degree in psychology in 2010. While at New Mexico, she had five collegiate wins and was a two-time NCAA All-American (2009 and 2010).\nAmateur career\nEwart was on the Great Britain and Ireland Curtis Cup team in 2008 which was defeated by the United States. She is also a two-time English Women's Strokeplay champion, winning in 2008 and again in 2009.\nProfessional career\nEwart turned professional in 2010 and played on the Futures Tour. She qualified for the LPGA Tour in 2011. Her most successful season to date is 2013 when she finished tied for 7th in the 2013 Kraft Nabisco Championship and tied for 4th in the 2013 U.S. Women's Open. Her best finish to date is 2nd at the 2017 Women's British Open. She qualified for the Ladies European Tour (LET) in 2012 by winning at the LET Final Qualifying Tournament.\nAfter the conclusion of the 2013 Women's British Open, she was chosen by Liselotte Neumann as one of her four captain's selections to the 2013 European Solheim Cup Team for the matches to be held in Colorado. In 2017, she had the fourth highest total of LET Solheim Cup, qualifying her to compete for the 2017 European Solheim Cup Team held in Des Moines, Iowa.\nUnlike many of her fellow competitors she used an anchored putter until anchoring was banned by the R&A.\nAfter 11 seasons on tour, Shadoff won her first LPGA Tour event at the 2022 LPGA Mediheal Championship after 246 starts.\nPersonal life\nEwart married Adam Shadoff, now a sports anchor and reporter at WOFL-TV in Orlando, Florida, on 19 January 2013.\nShadoff is a supporter of Leeds United F.C.\nProfessional wins (1)\nLPGA Tour wins (1)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!
