In the , Haigslea had a population of 507 people.\nHistory\nThe area was originally called Kirchheim by the many German people who settled there as immigrants between 1865 and 1873.

On 17 November 1923, the church was destroyed in a cyclone.  A replacement church was built at Haigslea (formerly Kirchheim) and re-dedicated on 13 April 1924. A new church building was opened in April 1924 with 300 people in attendance. On 7 March 1971, the church held its last service before closing.
