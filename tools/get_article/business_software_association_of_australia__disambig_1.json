The BSAA typically retained the law firm Mallesons Stephen Jacques (a particularly notable Australian law firm) to investigate and litigate its interests.\nThe association published a range of auditing tools and provided information on software copyright  and license compliancy.\nThe association had been particularly more active in the defense of copyright infringement since January 2006 when Australian Copyright law was changed to make the running of an enterprise with infringing software a criminal offense.\nAs of January 2007, the BSAA is now the Australian branch of the Business Software Alliance.\nMembers\nThe full members of the BSAA were Adobe Systems, Microsoft, Computer Associates, Symantec, Autodesk and Apple Computer.\nCriticisms\nLike most industry associations that support litigation of copyright matters, the BSAA was occasionally mentioned as being draconian, although it is considerably more measured in action it takes than its counterparts in the UK and United States.\nAssociations such as the BSAA are also sometimes considered as an example of a 'good hand, bad hand' tactic as its members can actively pursue their interests through the association and draw criticism to the association rather than themselves as members.\nReferences"
