These include a non-ankylosaurid ankylosaur (possibly nodosaurid), a non-hadrosaurid ornithopod, a primitive neoceratopsian, and a tyrannosauroid, all represented by teeth. Other dinosaur specimens are known but cannot be assigned to any specific clades due to their non-diagnostic nature.\nSee also\n* List of dinosaur-bearing rock formations\n** List of stratigraphic units with indeterminate dinosaur fossils\nFootnotes\nReferences\n* Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osmólska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. 861 pp.&nbsp;."
