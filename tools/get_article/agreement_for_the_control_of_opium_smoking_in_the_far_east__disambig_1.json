The treaty was signed and ratified by the State of Vietnam, France, British India, Japan, Laos, Netherlands, Thailand, and United Kingdom.\nArticle I provided that retail sale and distribution of opium would be limited to Government shops. Fixed salaries were mandated for retailers; sales commissions were abolished. A system of licensing and rationing smokers was permitted as an alternative to the Government retail provisions.\nArticle II prohibited minors under the age of 21 from smoking opium or entering smoking establishments, and mandated prison sentences for inducing minors to smoke opium, to enter an opium-smoking establishment, or to procure opium.\nOther provisions mandated that opium be sold for cash only, allowed governments to establish monopolies on opium production, and limited the application of the agreement to the Far East.\nThe Agreement was superseded by the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.\nReferences\n*[https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1947/10/19471027%2009-06%20AM/Ch_VI_9p.pdf Agreement concerning the Suppression of Opium Smoking], United Nations Treaty Collection.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823174850/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=VI-9&chapter=6&lang=en Ratifications].\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050120020650/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/bulletin/bulletin_1950-01-01_1_page005.html Unification of Conventions on Narcotic Drugs], Bulletin on Narcotics, 1950."
