The war occurred during the reign of Chikhulamayembe Bamantha (1850–1855) and involved Bemba invasions into Tumbuka territories near Chikhulamayembe, including Kajumba, Hewe, Mulindawafwa, and the Luvili River area near Chikang’ombe hill. The conflict ended with the Tumbuka successfully repelling the Bemba forces.\nBackground\nBamantha, whose name means \"to mould or shape,\" was the son of Chayeka (Bwati the First) and succeeded his brother Bwati the Second as the sixth Chikhulamayembe in 1850. Earlier, members of the royal family, including Bamantha, had been chased away by Kampungu. During his reign, Bamantha faced the challenge of Bemba incursions under Chitimukulu Chileshe Chipele (also called Chipera or Chepele).\nCourse of the war\nThe Bemba invaded several Tumbuka regions, settling at Bururuji and Kawuwu, and attempted to establish control over Bamantha’s territory. In response, Bamantha sought military assistance from Chungu (Kyungu) of Kalonga, whose warriors counterattacked the Bemba via the Nthalire–Hebe route, striking them from the rear.\nDespite putting up strong resistance, including fortifying Kawuwu, the Bemba were defeated. Tumbuka archers used heated arrows to burn the stockaded village, forcing the Bemba to retreat to their homeland.\nAftermath\nAfter Bamantha’s death, the throne was briefly held by Mujuma, from the house of Bwati the First, before being replaced by Mkuwayila in 1855, considered a 'son' of Bamantha under Tumbuka tradition. Mkuwayila was later killed by Ngoni impis, marking the end of Chikhulamayembe rule in Nkhamanga for the next fifty years during Ngoni domination (1855–1907).\nThe Balowoka lineage had thus ruled the Tumbuka of Nkhamanga for approximately 80 years (1775–1855). The Chikhulamayembe chieftaincy was revived by the British in 1907 to assist in administering northern Nyasaland (now Malawi) through indirect rule. Since 1907, there have been only three Chikhulamayembe chiefs.\nReferences\n}"
