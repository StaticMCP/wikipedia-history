The awards are presented for outstanding achievements, both in popular as well as technical branches such as television software and crafts. Initially the award show represented the best achievements of the year in the opinion of the TV industry. The voting was by industry workers right from the spot boys to actors, directors, writers and producers. Later, however, the voting system changed to an audience vote.\nIn the year 2007 and 2008, more than 300 TV and film personalities attended the event held in Mauritius and Dubai respectively.\nEditions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
