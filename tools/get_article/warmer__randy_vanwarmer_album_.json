A year later Warmer was released and produced by Del Newman. It was initially released on vinyl, 8-track, and cassette, and in 1995 it was released on compact disc. \"Just When I Needed You Most\" was written by VanWarmer when he was eighteen and still in England, and the song has been described as \"a ballad of heartbreak from a man's point of view.\" It reached No. 4 on Billboard in 1979.\nPromotion\nBy December 1980, VanWarmer toured in Europe to support the release of Warmer, as well as Japan and Hong Kong.\nReception\n| rev2 = Billboard\n| rev2Score = Mixed\n| rev3 = Rolling Stone\n| rev3Score =\n}}\nA brief review in a 1979 issue of Billboard compares VanWarmer's style of singing on Warmer to that of The Bee Gees, and although the writer felt the album lacked diversity, \"Just When I Needed You Most\" was regarded as a good cut. According to  The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music, \"Just When I Needed You Most\" was the song VanWarmer was \"best remembered for.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks composed by Randy VanWarmer\nPersonnel\n*Randy VanWarmer - vocals, guitar, backing vocals\n*Arti Funaro, John Holbrook, John Tropea, Johnny Christopher, Mick Barakan, Steve Gibson - guitar\n*Jack Williams, Tony Levin - bass\n*John Holbrook, Mick Hodgkinson, Shane Keister, Warren Bernhardt - keyboards\n*Kenny Malone, Steve Jordan - drums\n*George Carnell, Ian Kimmet, John Holbrook, Ray Cooper - percussion\n*John Sebastian - autoharp\n*Stan Saltzman - saxophone\n*Alan Williams, Chris Thompson, Gary Osborne, John Richardson, Katie Kissoon, Roger Moss, Stevie Lange - backing vocals\n*Del Newman - string arrangements, conductor\n;Technical\n*John Holbrook - additional production, engineer, remixing\n*Ian Kimmet - additional production\n*Brent Maher, George Carnell, Jeff Hendrickson, Richard Dodd, Scott Litt - engineer\n*Desmond Strobel - art direction\n*Aaron Rapoport - photography\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (1979)\n!scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|67\n|}\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*}}\n*}}\n*\n*\n*}}\n*\nOnline sources\n*}}\n*\n*}}\n*}}\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
