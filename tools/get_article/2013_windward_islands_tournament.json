Matches took place at Victoria Park in Kingstown. The tournament was organised by the Windward Islands Football Association (WIFA) and received financial assistance from CONCACAF.  It was the first time that the tournament has been held since 2001. After the three nations were eliminated from 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification and the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, none of them were scheduled for any international matches. Therefore, the tournament was organized to assess current and future talent. After Dominica withdrew, they were replaced by a team compromised exclusively of players from the NLA Premier League organized by the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Football Federation called the \"President's XI.\"\nGrenada won the tournament, beating Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the final match of the tournament.  Grenada only needed a draw to be named champions.\nDominica withdrawal\nDominica was originally scheduled to take part in the tournament but withdrew on 19 April, only two days before the tournament began, after head coach Kurt Hector and defender Noran Jno Hope were killed in a car accident on the way to Melville Hall Airport to meet their other teammates to fly to St. Vincent. Tournament organizers decided to not cancel the tournament as a tribute.  WIFA then released a revised schedule\nSquads\nFixtures\nAll times are local (UTC−4)\n|team2=LCA|name_LCA=\n|team3=SVG|name_SVG=\n|team4=FFP|name_FFP= Football Federation President's XI\n|win_GRN=2|draw_GRN=0|loss_GRN=1|gf_GRN=4|ga_GRN=3\n|win_LCA=2|draw_LCA=0|loss_LCA=1|gf_LCA=5|ga_LCA=3\n|win_SVG=1|draw_SVG=0|loss_SVG=2|gf_SVG=2|ga_SVG=3\n|win_FFP=1|draw_FFP=0|loss_FFP=2|gf_FFP=3|ga_FFP=5\n|update=complete|source=\n}}\n| time         =\n| team1        = Football Federation President's XI\n| team2        =\n| score        = 2–1\n| goals1       = Small   Slater\n| goals2       = Baptiste\n| stadium      = Victoria Park, Kingstown\n| attendance   =\n| referee      = Leo Clarke (Saint Lucia)\n| report       =\n}}\n| time         =\n| team1        =\n| team2        =\n| score        = 0–2\n| goals1       =\n| goals2       = Charles   Williams\n| stadium      = Victoria Park, Kingstown\n| attendance   =\n| referee      = Valman Bedeau (Grenada)\n| report       = [http://caribbeanfootballdatabase.com/matches/2013/saintvincentandthegrenadinesvssaintlucia4212013.html Report]\n}}\n----\n| time         =\n| team1        =\n| team2        =  Football Federation President's XI\n| score        = 2–0\n| goals1       = McDowall   Solomon\n| goals2       =\n| stadium      = Victoria Park, Kingstown\n| attendance   =\n| referee      = Vivian Robinson (Saint Lucia)\n| report       = [http://www.stlucianewsonline.com/grenada-defeats-saint-lucia-in-highly-charged-clash/ Report]\n}}\n| time         =\n| team1        =\n| team2        =\n| score        = 2–1\n| goals1       = Jules   Daniel\n| goals2       = Joseph\n| stadium      = Victoria Park, Kingstown\n| attendance   =\n| referee      = Trevor Taylor (Barbados)\n| report       = [http://caribbeanfootballdatabase.com/matches/2013/grenadavssaintlucia4232013.html Report]\n}}\n----\n| time         =\n| team1        = Football Federation President's XI\n| team2        =\n| score        = 1–2\n| goals1       = Small\n| goals2       = Neptune   Joseph\n| stadium      = Victoria Park, Kingstown\n| attendance   =\n| referee      = Valman Bedeau (Grenada)\n| report       =\n}}\n| time         =\n| team1        =\n| team2        =\n| score        = 0–1\n| goals1       =\n| goals2       = Daniel\n| stadium      = Victoria Park, Kingstown\n| attendance   =\n| referee      = Trevor Taylor (Barbados)\n| report       = [http://caribbeanfootballdatabase.com/matches/2013/saintvincentandthegrenadinesvsgrenada4252013.html Report]\n}}\nGoal scorers\nJamil Joseph\n|1 goal=\n* Kwan Baptiste\n* Denron Daniel\n* Lisdon Jules\n* Kimron Redhead\n* Eden Charles\n* Gerlanne Neptune\n* Pernal Williams\n* Jolanshoy McDowall\n* Tevin Slater\n* Dominic Small\n* Kevin Small\n* Azhino Solomon\n}}\nReferences"
