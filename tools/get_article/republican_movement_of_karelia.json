And protests against the former head of the Republic of Karelia,  Aleksandr Hudilainen.\nThe RMK also focused on expanding and popularizing Karelian culture with projects such as National Kyykkä Assoсiation and Onegaborg radio, which only broadcast songs from Karelia.\nThe organization also had candidates during the 2014 Petrozavodsk city council election but did not secure any seats.\nOn 4 December 2015, Vadim Shtepa was arrested for distribution of extremist materials on the same day an article was posted on Respublika, the news website of the government of the Republic of Karelia, where the Head of the Republic of Karelia, Aleksandr Hudilainen, condemns Shtepa of extremism, saying that “extremists will have no will either in Petrozavodsk or in Karelia”. After this incident, Vadim Shtepa moved to Estonia.\nThe organization continued to legally exist under the leadership of Emelyanova Ekaterina Valentinovna until its liquidation on 14 August 2019. It was almost completely inactive, but in 2017 the movement introduced three bills to the Legislative Assembly of the Republic of Karelia, which suggested the use of the languages of the indigenous Baltic-Finnish peoples of Karelia in the ballots during elections, but the proposal was rejected.\nGoals\nRMK was created as an organization that aimed to gain more autonomy for the Republic of Karelia as a part of the Russian Federation, however, some local journalists and politicians believed that it was separatist in nature.\nOther goals included the creation of a multi-cultural state of Russians, Karelians, Finns, Vepsians, Zaonezhians, Pomors and other ethnic groups of Karelia; creation of parliamentary republic and diversification of the economy; renaming of streets and cities to more Karelian names; liquidation of \"United Russia\" in Karelia and the law enforcement agencies serving it; revival of the transboundary project \"Euroregion Karelia\"; ecological protection and technological modernization of the country.\nThe organization supported the ideas of civic nationalism and opposed ethnonationalism.\nThe movement rejected the idea of unifying with Finland, seeing it as \"a colony wanting to change its overlord\".\nSee also\n* Karelian National Movement\n* Separatism in Russia\n* Regionalism\nReferences"
