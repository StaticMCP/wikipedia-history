His main motivation for advancing to this position was that he coveted control of the ferry of Chausa.\nUpon their arrival, they noticed Brahmins performing prayers and rituals. They proceeded to disturb and interfere with the rituals which drew the attention of the Ujjainiyas. The Ujjainiyas were initially successful in driving the Jaunpur Sultanate out of the region however they later returned plundered the city, destroying the temples in the process. The Ujjainiyas were then forced to flee into the forests.\nFinal defeat\nAfter their defeat, the Ujjainiyas retreated into the hills and forests and continued to harass the forces of the Jaunpur Sultanate by using guerrilla warfare. After the death of Sultan Malik Sarwar in 1399, many Ujjainiyas felt it safe to return from living in the forest. However, for certain periods throughout the 1400s, many Ujjainiyas had to return to living in the forests. By the latter half of the 1400s, many Ujjaniyas were paying tribute to the Jaunpur Sultan as the Ujjainiya chief at the time, Durlabh Deva had accepted their suzerainty. This continued until the Jaunpur Sultanate was eventually absorbed into the Lodi dynasty.\nSee also\n*Bengal Sultanate-Jaunpur Sultanate War\nReferences"
