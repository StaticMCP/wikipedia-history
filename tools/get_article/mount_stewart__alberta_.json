It is the highest point of the Cloister Mountains.\nThe mountain was named by Arthur Coleman in 1902 for Louis Stewart, a Professor of Surveys at the University of Toronto. In the late 1800s, Stewart had accompanied Coleman on two trips into the Canadian Rockies. Stewart's father, George Alexander Stewart became the first superintendent of Banff National Park.\nReferences"
