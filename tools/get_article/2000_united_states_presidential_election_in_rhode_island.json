Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nRhode Island voted for the Democratic Party's candidate, then Vice President Al Gore of Tennessee, over the Republican Party's candidate, Governor George W. Bush of Texas. Gore ran with Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate, while Bush ran with former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate.\nRhode Island is one of the most reliably Democratic states in the country. This state was Democrat Al Gore's best performance in the 2000 presidential election, where he won with over 60% of the vote. Gore won all five of the Ocean State's counties and won all but two townships. Ralph Nader, running a high-profile campaign on behalf of the Green Party with Winona LaDuke as his running mate, took 6.12% of the popular vote in the state, making Rhode Island his fourth best showing in the 2000 election after Alaska, Vermont and neighboring Massachusetts. Despite Gore not winning the national election, his over 29-point win margin in this state has not been topped since.\nPrimaries\nDemocratic Primary (March 7)\nAl Gore won the primary from Rhode Island and won every county except Bristol County and Washington County. The state was worth 32 delegates.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Al Gore\n!
