The battle was fought in 9 February 1232 at the Sanfeng Mountain which is in the southwest of what is now the city Yuzhou in Henan Province, China. The battle resulted with a crushing Mongol victory, successfully planned and orchestrated by their general Tolui, and successfully wiped out the last field army of the Jin Dynasty, therefore sealing its fate of falling to the Mongol Empire.\nReferences"
