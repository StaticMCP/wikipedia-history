This service was not limited to the Belgian colonies of the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi but also included the Middle East, Nigeria, Madagascar and Burma, for which clasps were awarded for six months service in those areas.\nPersons eligible for award of both the 1940–1945 Colonial War Effort Medal and the 1940–1945 African War Medal could only receive one of the two, usually the one earned for the longest period of service.\nThe 1940-1941 Belgian Ethiopian Campaign has his own medal : the Abyssinian Campaign Medal.\nAward description\nThe 1940–1945 African War Medal was a 52mm high (including suspension) by 33mm wide rectangular medal struck from bronze with sloped upper shoulders and rounded lower corners.  Its obverse bore the relief images of the left profiles of a native African soldier wearing a fez and of a pith-helmeted Belgian soldier, both within a recessed central area.  Under the recess, the embossed years \"1940 - 1945\".  The reverse was plain.\nFour clasps were issued for wear on the ribbon inscribed in French:\n* NIGERIE (must be read as NIGÉRIE) for six months service in Nigeria\n* MOYEN-ORIENT for six months service in the Middle East\n* MADAGASCAR for six months service in Madagascar\n* BIRMANIE for six months service in Burma\nAir force personnel who served in theatre whether on an operational combat or transport unit received the medal with a miniature set of bronze wings on the ribbon.\nThe 1940–1945 African War Medal was suspended by a ring passing laterally though a suspension loop at the top of the medal, from a 37mm wide light blue silk moiré ribbon with a 5mm wide central yellow stripe and 3mm wide yellow stripes situated 5mm from the ribbon edges.\nSee also\n* Belgian Congo\n* Orders, decorations, and medals of Belgium\nReferences\nOther sources\n* Quinot H., 1950, Recueil illustré des décorations belges et congolaises, 4e Edition.
