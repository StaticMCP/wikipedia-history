Ltd. is a helicopter airline based at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal, operating chartered helicopter services. The company was established in 1993 and mainly carries out domestic chartered helicopter flights throughout Nepal from its three hubs in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Lukla. It is currently banned from flying in EU airspace.\nHistory\nAir Dynasty was founded in 1993 in Kathmandu, Nepal, by Ang Tshering Sherpa, who later also founded Yeti Airlines. In 2001, the airline received a foreign direct investment from British businessman Malcolm Roy Smith, who held 50% of the airline and served as the chairman. In 2005, the airline partnered with the Bhutanese flag carrier Druk Air, to which a Eurocopter helicopter was leased, after the government of Bhutan decided to introduce helicopter charter services in the country.\nIn 2013, the European Commission banned all Nepalese airlines from entering European airspace. This restriction is still in place as of January 2023 and specifically also regards Air Dynasty.\nFleet\nCurrent fleet\nThe Air Dynasty fleet consists of these aircraft (as of May 2019):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; border-collapse:collapse; text-align: center\"\n|+ Air Dynasty fleet\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Aircraft\n!rowspan=2|In fleet\n!rowspan=2|Orders\n!colspan=3|Passengers\n!rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n!C\n!Y\n!Total\n|-\n|align=left|Eurocopter AS350 B3e\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|5\n|5\n|\n|-\n|align=left|Eurocopter AS350 FXII\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|5\n|5\n|\n|-\n|align=left|Eurocopter AS350 BA\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|5\n|5\n|\n|-\n!Total\n!4\n!1\n| colspan=\"4\" |\n|}\nFormer fleet\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; border-collapse:collapse; text-align: center\"\n|+ Air Dynasty former fleet\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Aircraft\n!rowspan=2|Operated\n!colspan=3|Passengers\n!rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n!C\n!Y\n!Total\n|-\n|align=left|Airbus H125\n|1\n|0\n|5\n|5\n| Crashed on 27 February 2019\n|-\n|}\nAccidents and incidents\n* 26 September 2013 – An Air Dynasty Eurocopter AS 350 helicopter crashed after landing at Lukla Airport.
