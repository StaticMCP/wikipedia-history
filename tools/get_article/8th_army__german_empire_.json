It was formed on mobilization in August 1914 from the I Army Inspectorate.  The army was dissolved on 29 September 1915, but reformed on 30 December 1915. It was finally disbanded in 1919 during demobilization after the war.\nHistory\nOn mobilization in August 1914, the 8th Army Headquarters was formed in Posen to command troops stationed in East Prussia to defend against the expected Russian attack, Plan XIX.  Initially, the Army commanded the following formations:\n{|\n|\n* I Corps (Generalleutnant Hermann von François based on Königsberg)\n* XVII Corps (General der Kavallerie August von Mackensen based on Danzig)\n* XX Corps (General der Infanterie Friedrich von Scholtz based on Allenstein)\n* I Reserve Corps (Generalleutnant Otto von Below formed on mobilisation)\n* Landwehr Corps (General der Infanterie Remus von Woyrsch formed on mobilisation)\n* 3rd Reserve Division (Generalleutnant Kurt von Morgen, formed on mobilisation)\n* 1st Cavalry Division (Generalleutnant Hermann Brecht, formed on mobilisation)\n|}\nConcerned by the defeat at Gumbinnen and the continued advance of the Russian Second Army from the south, Prittwitz ordered a retreat to the Vistula, effectively abandoning East Prussia. When he heard of this, Helmuth von Moltke, the German Army Chief of Staff, recalled Prittwitz and his deputy to Berlin. They were replaced by Paul von Hindenburg, called out of retirement, with Erich Ludendorff as his chief of staff.  Under its new command, the Army was responsible for the victories at the Battles of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes.\nDissolved and reformed\nThe Army of the Niemen was formed on 26 May 1915 to control the troops in Courland.  The commander of the 8th Army, General der Infanterie Otto von Below, along with his chief of staff, Generalmajor von Böckmann, assumed command.  In the meantime, the 8th Army got a deputy commander, General der Artillerie Friedrich von Scholtz, who was simultaneously commander of XX Corps.  8th Army was dissolved on 29 September 1915.  On 30 December 1915 the Army of the Niemen was renamed as the 8th Army with von Below still in command.\nCommanders\nThe original 8th Army had the following commanders-in-chief from mobilisation until it was dissolved 29 September 1915.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+8th Army\n!
