The team is an associate member of the Northeast Conference, which is part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. Howard's first men's soccer team was fielded in 1965. The team plays its home games at Greene Stadium near the Park View neighborhood of the District. The Bison are coached by Howard alumnus and former U.S. national team player, Phillip Gyau.\nHoward achieved much of their success in the early to mid-1970s and in the late 1980s, where they would win two NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championships (1971 and 1974), and reach the College Cup on six occasions. The 1971 title would later be vacated by the NCAA. Howard is the first historically black university to win an NCAA soccer title (or any Division I national title). Despite these achievements, the Bison have had less success in modern times, with their last NCAA berth coming in 1997.\nRoster\nThe 2021-2022 roster for the Howard Men's Bison.\nNotable alumni\nHoward Bison's that have played professionally include.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! width= px style=\"\"| Player\n! width= px style=\"\"| Year\n! width= px style=\"\"| Notable Teams\n! width= px style=\"\"| National Team\n|-\n|Keith Aqui\n|1971\n|Baltimore Comets (NASL)\n|Trinidad and Tobago\n|-\n|Al Henderson\n|1972\n|Baltimore Comets (NASL)\n|Trinidad and Tobago\n|-\n|Ian Bain\n|1975\n|Washington Darts (NASL)\n|Trinidad and Tobago\n|-\n|Phillip Gyau\n|1985\n|Montreal Impact, Tampa Bay Rowdies, Washington Diplomats\n|United States\n|-\n|Peter Isaacs\n|1989\n|Fort Lauderdale Strikers, Tampa Bay Cyclones\n|Jamaica\n|-\n|Shaka Hislop\n|1991\n|West Ham, Newcastle United, Portsmouth FC\n|Trinidad and Tobago\n|-\n|Greg Simmonds\n|1998\n|DC United, Miami Fusion, Rochester Rhinos\n|\n|-\n|Ray Goodlett\n|1998\n|DC United, Richmond Kickers\n|\n|-\n|Nigel Henry\n|2000\n|Montreal Impact, Charleston Battery\n|Trinidad and Tobago\n|-\n|Idris Ughiovhe\n|2005\n|Chicago Fire, Crystal Palace Baltimore\n|\n|-\n|Jason Gross\n|2008\n|NJ Ironmen\n|\n|-\n|Sam Howard\n|2016\n|IFK Amal, Union Omaha, OKC Energy FC\n|\n|-\n|Andres Gomez\n|2020\n|Nykoping\n|\n|}\nIndividual achievements\nHoward has produced five first team All-Americans.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width= px style=\"\"| Player\n! width= px style=\"\"| Pos.\n! width= px style=\"\"| Year(s)\n|-\n| Al Henderson || FW || 1970, 1971\n|-\n| Keith Aqui || FW || 1970\n|-\n| Ian Bain || FW || 1972\n|-\n| Peter Isaacs || FW || 1989\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
