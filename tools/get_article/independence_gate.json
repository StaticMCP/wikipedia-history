It was built in January 1898. Its construction was planned by Philip Jaisohn, as a symbol of Korea's commitment to independence. It was designated as a Historic Site of South Korea in 1963, and relocated  northwest from the original location in 1979 for preservation.\nDongnimmun measures 14.28 meters in height and 11.48 meters in width, and is made of approximately 1,850 pieces of granite.\nHistory\nBackground\nIn early 1895, the Government of Joseon abandoned its long-standing diplomatic policy of sadae. Under sadae, Joseon was a tributary state of Qing China. To celebrate this change, the Government of Joseon demolished Yeongeunmun in February 1895, which they had built in 16th century as a symbolic gate for welcoming Chinese diplomats to the country. On April 17, 1895, the Joseon Government was formally released from China's sphere of influence with the conclusion of the Treaty of Shimonoseki between the Empire of Japan and the Qing dynasty at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War.\nPhilip Jaisohn proposed the building a new gate near the former site of Yeongeunmun's ruins to symbolize the country's desire for freedom. This plan was approved by King Gojong, and the gate was named \"Independence Gate\".\nPlan for construction\nTo support construction of the gate, Soh created the Independence Club and published Korea's first modern newspaper named Tongnip sinmun. Regular citizens of Joseon donated to the construction of the gate via a public campaign run by the newspaper. Soh wrote the following in the English edition of that newspaper:\n}}\nConstruction and relocation\nThe design of Independence Gate was inspired by the design of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. An unknown Swiss architect working for the German legation in Joseon created the blueprint for its construction. Its construction began in 1896, and finished in January 1898. The construction process was overseen by Korean engineer named .\nSubsequent history\nThe Government of South Korea designated it as a historic site of South Korea in 1963. The gate was initially located north of the plinths of Yeongeunmun Gate, but was relocated 70 meters northwest from its original place with plinths of Yeongeunmun Gate, due to construction of Seongsan Road and its overpass. It is now located in Seodaemun Independence Park, where Dongnimmun is located, is easily accessed from Exit 4 or 5 of Dongnimmun Station on Seoul Subway Line 3.\nGallery\nFile:The independent 4th July 1896.jpg|An editorial in Tongnip sinmun promoting fundraising for construction of Dongnimmun, July 4, 1896\nFile:독립문_기공식_초청장.png|An image of the invitation to the groundbreaking ceremony for the Independence Gate on November 21, 1896\nFile:Hamilton - En Corée - p052.png|Scene of Dongnimmun looking down the Plinths of Yeongeunmun Gate in 1904\nFile:Independence Gate after the First Battle of Seoul.png|North Korean propaganda installed on the Independence Gate after the First Battle of Seoul, 1950\nFile:195103 1950年朝鲜战争中国志愿军攻入汉城独立门.png|The Chinese People's Volunteer Army storming through Independence Gate during the Third Battle of Seoul, January 1951\nFile:Independence Gate Seoul Korea 1955.jpg|View of Dongnimmun from northern side in 1955 before relocation\nFile:Dokripmun.jpg|Dongnimmun and Plinths of Yeongeunmun Gate, Seoul after relocation\nFile:Hangul Script on the Dongnimmun Gate.jpg|Letters of '독립문' and Taegukgi is carved on arch via Vertical writing.
