The hostilities quickly resulted in a peace treaty and the two parties would soon reconcile.\nBackground\nDuring Bernt Pessart's time as overhoved of Danish India, Masulipatnam was the centre of the cotton trade and Pessart would rather prefer residing in Masulipatnam than Tranquebar. Masulipatnam was originally an unimportant fishing village located in the Sultanate of Golconda, however, in the 17th century its commercial importance began to grow, and the Danes established a factory there.\n( 1621–1636) made Masulipatam the centre for the company's trade, and Bernt Pessart additionally made it the official headquarters.]]\nPrelude\nInitially, the relations with the local sultan remained stable, and he had been eager to acquire cloves from the Danish Company. However, as the company's finances suffered, the relations would deteriorate. By 1638, Pessart's debts in the trading town amounted to 35,000 pagodas. In 1639 Dutch, English, and Danish agents in Masulipatnam had been ordered to present the sultan with a gift of 600,000 pagodas. When the Danes could not deliver this, their trading post was ransacked. In 1640, the St. Jacob wrecked off Masulipatnam. It was a serious blow to the company, and led Pessart's creditors to demand his imprisonment.\nBecause of the financial situation, Christian IV sent Captain Willem Leyel to Dansborg to investigate the company's affairs. When Leyel arrived he assumed Pessart's leadership, however, the conditions in Masulipatnam was still at place.\nWar\nThe disordered state of affairs with regard to trade with the Sultanate of Golconda continued, and Leyel was finally forced to declare war on Golconda. Leyel initiated a blockade of Masulipatnam, the biggest trading town in the Sultanate, and launched privateering ventures to the Coromandel Coast. These ventures eventually led to the capture and seizure of a couple of Golcondian ships. As a result, Leyel and the Golcondian sultan, Abdullah Qutb Shah, would agree to a peaceful settlement.\nAftermath\nThis peace settlement put an end to the lucrative market, in which the Danish officers had been involved, and it may be assumed that this settlement caused a mutiny in Tranquebar in 1648.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*"
