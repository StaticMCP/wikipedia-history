According to the biblical narrative, after the death of Solomon, representatives of the northern tribes of Israel demanded that his son, Rehoboam, make changes to the kingdom's governance. When Rehoboam refused, the ten northern tribes rejected his rule and chose Jeroboam, a former rebel, as their king. These tribes retained the name \"Israel\" and established the northern kingdom, while the tribes of Judah and Benjamin remained loyal to the Davidic line, forming the kingdom of Judah. This division marked the beginning of the era of the Divided Monarchy.\n914 BCE\n* Rehoboam of Judah dies; he is replaced by Abijah.\n911 BCE\n* Abijah dies and is succeeded by Asa as the king of Judah.\nc. 910 BCE\n* Death of Jeroboam I of Israel.\n909 BCE\n* Short reign of Nadab of Israel; he is succeeded by Baasha in the same year.\n886 BCE\n* Death of Baasha.\n885 BCE\n* Elah reigns briefly over Israel before being killed by the chariot commander Zimri, who rules for seven days before being overthrown by Omri, who then establishes the Omride dynasty over Israel.\n871 BCE\n* Jehoshaphat ascends to the throne of Judah.\nc. 853 BCE\n* The Battle of Qarqar took place between Shalmaneser III of Assyria and a coalition of allied kings. Ahab of Israel contributed the second-largest contingent of troops, along with the largest number of chariots, to the coalition army. The battle is recorded on the Assyrian Kurkh Monoliths, which provide a detailed account of the conflict.\nc. 852–851 BCE\n* Ahaziah rules Israel.\n851 BCE\n* Jehoram ascends to the throne of Israel.\n848 BCE\n* Jehoram ascends to the throne of Judah.\n841 BCE\n* Hazael of Aram-Damascus conducts a campaign against Israel and Judah; Jehoram of Israel and Ahaziah of Judah die; according to the Bible, Jehoram is wounded in battle and later killed by the usurper Jehu alongside Ahaziah of Judah in Jezreel, during a purge of the Omri dynasty. In the Tel Dan Stele, Hazael claims responsibility for their deaths. Jehu becomes king of Israel, founding a new ruling dynasty. Jehu of Israel sends tribute to Shalmaneser III of Assyria, as recorded on the Black Obelisk.\n734–732 BCE\n* Tiglath-Pileser III campaigns against Israel, conquering Galilee and Transjordan. He also records receiving tribute from Ahaz of Judah.\n722–720 BCE\n* Samaria is conquered by Shalmaneser V and Sargon II; this event is documented in the Sargon II Display Inscriptions, Nimrud Prism, Assur Charter, and Babylonian Chronicle I, and corresponds with the biblical account in 2 Kings 17:5–6 and 18:9–12.\n701 BCE\n* Sennacherib's conquest of Lachish and the siege of Jerusalem.\nc. 676 BCE\n* Manasseh of Judah contributes forced laborers to Esarhaddon for construction projects in Nineveh, as recorded in an Assyrian prism.\n667 BCE\n* Manasseh of Judah sends tribute to Ashurbanipal during the Assyrian campaign against Egypt.\n597 BCE\n* Nebuchadnezzar II's first siege of Jerusalem culminated in the city's fall on March 16. In the aftermath, Zedekiah was installed as king of Judah.\n587/586 BCE\n* Jerusalem is besieged and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. 2 Kings 25:8 and Jeremiah 52:12 date the fall to his 19th regnal year (traditionally 586 BCE); other evidence, such as Jeremiah 52:29, which records a deportation in his 18th year, suggests variation in regnal year calculation. Based on this, the actual fall likely occurred in July 587 BCE.\nSee also\n* Chronology of the Bible\n* Timeline of the Second Temple period\nBibliography\n*\n*\nFootnotes"
