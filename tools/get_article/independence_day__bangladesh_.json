It commemorates the country's declaration of independence from Pakistan in the early hours of 26 March 1971 following Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan's Operation Searchlight, eventual defeat and the Surrender of Pakistan.\nBackground\nIn the 1970 Pakistani general election, held under the military government of President Yahya Khan, the Awami League—led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman—won a clear majority in both the national and provincial assemblies of East Pakistan. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto conspired with Yahya Khan and changed their position, refusing to hand over power to Sheikh Mujib. Negotiations began between the two sides, however the ruling West Pakistani leadership did not trust Sheikh Mujib, due to instances such as the Agartala conspiracy case. When it became evident that the promises made by the West Pakistan government were not going to be kept, many East Pakistani Bangla-speaking Muslims and Hindus began a spirited struggle for independence. On 7 March 1971, Sheikh Mujib gave his famous speech at the Ramna Racecourse, in which he called for a non-cooperation movement.\nAuthorities, mostly West Pakistani personnel, rounded up Bengali armed forces officers, NCOs, and enlisted personnel. Forced disappearences were rampant. On the night of 25 March, the Pakistan Army began Operation Searchlight, conclusively signalling West Pakistan was not ready for a transfer of political power to the Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\nThe Independence of Bangladesh was declared on 26 March 1971 at the first watch (00:00) by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman . Then it was read out at first M.A Hannan and then by Major Ziaur Rahman, on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Radio Station on 27 March, 1971.  Major Zia (who was also a BDF Sector Commander of Sector 1 and later of Sector 11) raised an independent Z Force brigade, Chittagong and the guerrilla struggle officially began. The people of Bangladesh then took part in a nine-month guerrilla war against the Pakistan Army and their collaborators, including the paramilitary Razakars. This resulted in the death of about 3 million Bangladeshi, as per Awami league and Indian sources, in the Bangladesh War of Independence and Bangladesh Genocide. The BDF, later with military support from India, defeated the Pakistan Army on 16 December 1971, leading to the end of the war and the Surrender of Pakistan.\nCelebrations\nbuilding in Dhaka illuminated during celebration]]\nIndependence Day is commonly associated with parades, political speeches, fairs, concerts, ceremonies, and various other public and private events celebrating the history and traditions of Bangladesh. TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs in honor of Independence Day. A thirty-one gun salute may be conducted in the morning. The main streets are decorated with national flags. Different political parties and socioeconomic organizations undertake programs to mark the day in a befitting manner, including paying respects at National Martyrs' Memorial at Savar near Dhaka.\nGoogle displayed a doodle commemorating the Independence Day of Bangladesh on 26 March 2017 on their bd domain. The same year celebrations were organised in Tripura, India, by Bangladesh deputy high commissioner stationed there.\n2021 marked the Golden Jubilee of the Independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan.\nIndependence Award\nThe Independence Award, which is bestowed upon Bangladeshi citizens or organizations on the eve of the Independence Day, is awarded by the government of Bangladesh. This annual award, instituted in 1977, is given for substantial contribution in the Independence War, the Language Movement, education, literature, journalism, public service, science-technology, medical science, social science, music, games and sports, fine arts, rural development, and other fields.\nSee also\n* Bangladesh Genocide Remembrance Day\n* Victory Day\n* History of Bangladesh (1947–1971)\n* Timeline of Bangladesh Liberation War\n* The Blood telegram\nReferences"
