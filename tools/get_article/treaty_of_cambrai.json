The treaty confirmed the effective Habsburg hegemony in the Duchy of Milan and in the Kingdom of Naples.\nThe peace was negotiated and signed at Cambrai by two ladies: Margaret of Austria for the Emperor and Louise of Savoy for the King.\nThe treaty renewed the Treaty of Madrid (1526) but also introduced some new clauses, which were aimed to resolve several long-standing issues that remained unresolved by previous treaties, mainly those related to disputes over the Burgundian inheritance.\nBackground\nThe Peace of Cambrai ended France's involvement in the War of the League of Cognac, which had lasted since 1526. It was signed in the city of Cambrai, the center of the principality-bishopric in the Netherlands (now the French department Nord).\nThis treaty is also called \"Ladies' Peace\" since women played an important role in its preparation: Francis' mother, Louise of Savoy, and Charles' aunt, Margaret of Austria. They represented both monarchs in negotiations and helped them not lose face. Marguerite of Navarre was also instrumental in the achievement.\nTerms\n(1482), Senlis (1493) and Madrid (1526)]]\nThe treaty contained several territorial and political clauses. Francis renounced his claims to Italian lands, including the Kingdom of Naples (articles 24 and 33) and the Duchy of Milan (article 22). The French side also accepted that all of the former-Burgundian domains within the Holy Roman Empire, including the Free County of Burgundy, would remain in the Emperor's possession. In addition, France realm renounced its suzerainty over two important provinces, the County of Artois and the County of Flanders, which were effectively in the Emperor's possession. On the other hand, Charles accepted that all of the other Burgundian domains within the Kingdom of France, including the Duchy of Burgundy and the Picardian counties, would remain in French possession.\nThe treaty provided for the return of Dauphin François and Prince Henry, the future Henry II, to France in exchange for a ransom of 2 million écus. Francis I confirmed his consent to marry Charles V's sister Eleanor and married her on 7 July 1530.\nEffects\nThe Treaty of Cambrai, together with the Treaty of Barcelona (between the Emperor and the Pope), which was concluded in June 1529, meant the disintegration of the Cognac League; only the Florentine Republic continued to fight against Charles V, which led to the siege and the surrender of Florence in 1530. Nevertheless, the terms of peace did not satisfy Francis I. In 1536, a new conflict began between France and the Holy Roman Empire.\nSee also\n* Treaty of Arras (1482)\n* Treaty of Senlis (1493)\nReferences\nSources\n* Baumgartner, Frederic J. Louis XII.
