They are the modern equivalent of the former districts, which were abolished in the 2015 decentralization reforms. The DRC is a unitary state divided into 26 provinces (including Kinshasa as a province-equivalent), which are further subdivided into territories, sectors, chiefdoms, and grouping of localities (groupements de localités). Territories are led by administrators and typically named after their administrative center.\nAs of 2025, there are 145 territories across the 26 provinces. Kinshasa is unique, divided into 4 districts and 24 communes without traditional territories. The three eastern provinces of Maniema, Nord-Kivu, and Sud-Kivu were never subdivided into districts even pre-2015 and retain direct territorial divisions.\nHistory\nThe administrative structure of the DRC has evolved significantly since colonial times. Under Belgian rule (1908–1960), the colony was organized into 22 districts, later restructured into provinces and districts.\nPost-independence in 1960, the country fragmented into 21 provinces (provincettes) by 1963, resembling the original districts. In 1966, under Mobutu Sese Seko, it was centralized into 8 provinces. By 1975, Kinshasa gained provincial status, and further changes occurred, including the 1988 split of Kivu into three provinces.\nThe 2006 Constitution (Article 2) mandated decentralization into 26 provinces, effectively converting the existing 26 districts (under 11 provinces) into these new units. Progress was delayed by political instability, but the reforms were enacted via Organic Law No. 15/013 of 25 March 2015. Districts were abolished as intermediate levels, with territories becoming direct subdivisions of provinces. Cities (villes) and communes remain for urban areas.\nNo major changes have occurred since 2015, though eastern conflicts (e.g., M23 advances in 2025) have disrupted governance without altering boundaries.\nPost-2015 Reorganization\nThe 2015 reforms increased provinces from 11 to 26:\n* Former districts became the new provinces (e.g., Haut-Katanga District → Haut-Katanga Province).\n* Territories (pre-2015: ~200) were reassigned directly to these provinces.\n* Urban areas gained expanded city status (e.g., 21 cities in 2008 expanded to 99 by 2014 plans, with staged implementation).\n* Kinshasa's 4 districts and 24 communes were retained but integrated as a province.\nAs of 2025, the system remains stable, though implementation varies in conflict zones like Ituri and Nord-Kivu.\nList of Territories by Province\nThe following table lists the 26 provinces and their territories (145 total as of 2025). Data is compiled from official mappings; some remote territories face governance challenges due to ongoing insurgencies.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Province\n!Capital\n!Territories\n!Population (2025 est.)\n!Notes\n|-\n|Haut-Katanga\n|Lubumbashi\n|10\n|15,000,000\n|Includes mining areas; Kolwezi urban territory.\n|-\n|Haut-Lomami\n|Kamina\n|5\n|2,500,000\n|Sparse population; historical rail hubs.\n|-\n|Haut-Uele\n|Isiro\n|8\n|2,000,000\n|Border with South Sudan; Garamba National Park territories.\n|-\n|Ituri\n|Bunia\n|5\n|5,500,000\n|Conflict zone; M23/ADF activity in 2025 (e.g., Djugu, Irumu).\n|-\n|Kasai\n|Luebo\n|6\n|4,000,000\n|Agricultural focus.\n|-\n|Kasai Central\n|Kananga\n|7\n|3,500,000\n|Diamond mining.\n|-\n|Kasai Oriental\n|Mbuji-Mayi\n|6\n|6,000,000\n|Industrial diamond center.\n|-\n|Kwilu\n|Kikwit\n|8\n|7,000,000\n|Riverine territories.\n|-\n|Kwango\n|Kenge\n|4\n|2,000,000\n|Angola border.\n|-\n|Kongo Central\n|Matadi\n|7\n|6,500,000\n|Includes Boma port city.\n|-\n|Lomami\n|Kabinda\n|6\n|2,500,000\n|Post-2015 split from Kasai-Oriental.\n|-\n|Lualaba\n|Kolwezi\n|4\n|3,000,000\n|Copperbelt mining.\n|-\n|Lulua\n|Kananga\n|5\n|3,000,000\n|Shared capital with Kasai Central.\n|-\n|Mai-Ndombe\n|Inongo\n|5\n|2,200,000\n|Lake Mai-Ndombe territories.\n|-\n|Maniema\n|Kindu\n|6\n|2,800,000\n|Undivided pre-2015; Virunga overlaps.\n|-\n|Mongala\n|Lisala\n|3\n|1,800,000\n|Congo River basin.\n|-\n|Nord-Ubangi\n|Gbadolite\n|3\n|1,200,000\n|Central African Republic border.\n|-\n|Nord-Kivu\n|Goma\n|6\n|8,000,000\n|Undivided pre-2015; M23 offensive in 2025 (Rutshuru, Masisi, Walikale).\n|-\n|Sankuru\n|Lodja\n|4\n|1,500,000\n|Sparse, river-dependent.\n|-\n|Sud-Kivu\n|Bukavu\n|8\n|7,500,000\n|Undivided pre-2015; Lake Kivu territories; M23 capture of Bukavu Feb 2025.\n|-\n|Sud-Ubangi\n|Gemena\n|3\n|1,700,000\n|Central African Republic border.\n|-\n|Tanganyika\n|Kalemie\n|6\n|1,400,000\n|Lake Tanganyika shore.\n|-\n|Tshopo\n|Kisangani\n|7\n|3,200,000\n|Congo River confluence.\n|-\n|Tshuapa\n|Boende\n|6\n|2,000,000\n|Rainforest territories.\n|-\n|Kinshasa\n|Kinshasa\n|0 (4 districts, 24 communes)\n|17,000,000\n|Capital province; no territories.\n|}\nSample Territories (Full List at Territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo)\nFor brevity, here's a sortable excerpt of select territories (alphabetical by province; full 145 at linked page).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Province\n!Territory\n!Capital\n!Area (km²)\n!Population (2025 est.)\n|-\n|Haut-Katanga\n|Bukama\n|Bukama\n|25,000\n|500,000\n|Haut-Katanga\n|Kapulo\n|Kapulo\n|15,000\n|200,000\n|...
