In organising it, eight battalions were formed in the department of Kalisz and four from troops arriving from France (the Northern Legions). Subsequently, the number of battalions was reduced to eight.\nOn 4 June 1807, Minister of War Jozef Poniatowski issued an order introducing new unit numbering, but its regiments retained their previous numbers from 5 to 8. In July 1808, the Legion was reorganised and the 2nd Division was formed. Its commander was the former commander of the Kalisz Legion, General Józef Zajączek, and the division's staff included Stanisław Malczewski. In August 1808, the 2nd Division was reviewed by Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout.\nDivision command\n* Commander– Lt. Gen. Józef Zajączek\n* Major – Brig. Gen.. Paweł Skórzewski\n* Cheifof staff – Col.
