The 2021 census for England and Wales recorded the majority (53.4%) of usual residents who were born in Singapore identified as White British. 19.0% identified as Chinese and 8.0% identified as Indian.\nBackground\nThe story of the Singaporean community in the UK has some similarities follows that of the British Chinese community, as Singaporeans of Chinese descent (see Chinese Singaporean) make up around 70% of the population. The Singaporean diaspora in Britain stems from Singapore's history as a former British colony (as part of the Straits Settlements' capital from 1826 to 1942, and separately as the Crown Colony of Singapore from 1946 to 1959), and its current membership in the Commonwealth of Nations.\nPopulation\n40,474 Singaporean-born people were recorded by the 2001 UK Census, with 40,180 of those living in Great Britain. The Singaporean-born population of Great Britain has increased by 19 per cent since the 1991 Census, when 33,751 Singaporean-born people were recorded.\nThe Office for National Statistics estimates that, in 2009, 41,000 Singaporean-born people were resident in the UK. The 2021 United Kingdom census recorded a population of just over 45,000 Singaporean-born residents in the United Kingdom.\nThe distribution of Singaporean-born residents according to the 2001 census is shown on the map. Nine of the ten census tracts with the most Singaporean-born residents in 2001 are in London. The most popular tracts were Hyde Park, Kensington, Holborn, Chelsea, Southall West, Regent's Park, Cambridge West, Highgate, East Ham South, Richmond North.\nNotable individuals\nThe list below includes British people of Singaporean descent and Singaporean immigrants to the UK, regardless of ethnicity.
