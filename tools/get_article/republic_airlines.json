Republic was formed by the merger of North Central Airlines and Southern Airways on July 1, 1979. Their headquarters were at Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, in what is now Fort Snelling in unincorporated Hennepin County, Minnesota. The former headquarters is now Delta Air Lines Building C.\nHistory\nRepublic Airlines began in 1979 with the merger of North Central Airlines and Southern Airways, the first such merger following the federal Airline Deregulation Act. The new airline's headquarters were at Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport where it operated a major hub, however, their largest hub was at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. A third hub was also operated at Memphis International Airport. Following their buyout of Hughes Airwest in 1980, Republic became the largest airline in the U.S. by number of airports served. New hubs were also acquired at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport.\nThe company operated the world's largest McDonnell Douglas DC-9 fleet, with DC-9-10, DC-9-30 and DC-9-50s and also flew Boeing 727-200, Boeing 757-200, and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets. In addition, Republic operated Convair 580 turboprops previously flown by North Central.\nAfter the merger, losses mounted and service reductions followed. Saddled with debt from two acquisitions and new aircraft, the airline struggled in the early 1980s, and even introduced a human mascot version of Herman the Duck. They reduced service to Phoenix and Las Vegas, former hubs of Hughes Airwest, citing their inability to compete with non-union airlines there, and eventually dismantled the former extensive route system operated by Hughes Airwest in the western U.S. As a result, this caused the airline’s image to worsen at a sensitive time, and the airline was sometimes derided as \"Repulsive\".\nIn early 1985 Republic teamed up with Simmons Airlines and Express Airlines I to provide feeder service from dozens of smaller cities to Republic's three main hub airports at Detroit, Memphis, and Minneapolis. The service was known as Republic Express using turboprop aircraft that were painted as Republic Airlines, accommodating from 14 to 34 passengers.\nNorthwest Airlines\nIn 1986, Northwest Orient Airlines announced on January 23 that they would buy Republic for $884 million in response to United Airlines' purchase of the Pacific routes of Pan American World Airways and to provide domestic feed. Opposed by the Justice Department, the Northwest-Republic merger was approved by the Transportation Department on July 31 and was completed on October 1, with Northwest dropping the word Orient from their name after the merger. Northwest merged Republic's hub at Minneapolis, with its existing hub there, and retained Republic's hubs at Memphis, and Detroit. Together, they became the backbone of Northwest's domestic network.\nNorthwest later merged with Delta Air Lines in October 2008; the deal was finalized in January 2010, with Delta as the surviving air carrier. Delta initially retained the former Republic hubs, but dehubbed Memphis in 2013.\nFrequent flyer program\nIn October 1984 Republic introduced a new frequent flyer program called the Perks program. The new program eliminated the need to place a frequent flyer account number sticker on each flight ticket coupon, with earned mileage automatically being assigned to accounts if the reservation was booked directly with Republic. Each flight segment earned a minimum of 1,000 miles or the actual mileage, if greater. A domestic round trip reward ticket was automatically issued every 20,000 miles. The new program included a partnership with Pan American World Airways for earning and redeeming mileage awards. In January 1986, Western Airlines was added as a partner. Effective October 1, 1986, the Republic Perks frequent flyer program was merged into Northwest Airlines which adopted the WorldPerks program name, taken from Republic.\nFleet\nin 1979]]\n*133 Douglas DC-9-14; Douglas DC-9-15; McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31; McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32; McDonnell Douglas DC-9-51\n*22 Boeing 727-200\n*8  McDonnell Douglas MD-82\n*6  Boeing 757-200\n*24  Convair CV-580 turboprop aircraft\nDestinations in 1986\nAccording to the Republic Airlines system route map dated March 2, 1986, the airline was serving the following domestic and international destinations shortly before the merger with Northwest Airlines:\nDomestic\nAlabama\n* Birmingham\n* Huntsville/Decatur\n* Mobile\n* Montgomery\nArizona\n* Phoenix – Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport  (previously a hub immediately following the acquisition of Hughes Airwest in 1980; sold to startup carrier America West Airlines in 1983)\n* Tucson\nArkansas\n* Little Rock\nCalifornia\n* Los Angeles – Los Angeles International Airport (previously a hub immediately following the acquisition of Hughes Airwest in 1980)\n* Orange County (SNA, now John Wayne Airport)\n* Sacramento\n* San Diego\n* San Francisco – San Francisco International Airport (previously a hub immediately following the acquisition of Hughes Airwest in 1980)\nColorado\n* Denver – Stapleton International Airport\nConnecticut\n* Hartford – Bradley International Airport\nFlorida\n* Fort Lauderdale\n* Fort Walton Beach\n* Miami\n* Orlando – Orlando International Airport (previously a focus city immediately following the merger of North Central Airlines and Southern Airways in 1979)\n* Panama City  – Panama City–Bay County International Airport\n* Sarasota\n* Tampa\nGeorgia\n* Atlanta – Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (previously a hub immediately following the merger of North Central Airlines and Southern Airways in 1979 but no longer a hub in 1986)\nIllinois\n* Chicago – Chicago O'Hare International Airport (previously a hub immediately following the merger of North Central Airlines and Southern Airways in 1979)\nIndiana\n* Fort Wayne\n* Indianapolis\n* South Bend\nIowa\n* Cedar Rapids\n* Des Moines\nKansas\n* Wichita – Wichita Dwight D.

Arriving from Minneapolis in sleet and snow showers at 7:40&nbsp;p.m., the Convair 580 skidded off the right edge of the runway and the right propeller struck a snowbank. Three other passengers were injured, one seriously. Following this incident, the airline had a number of close calls in 1983. In 1985, a pilot for the airline named Jack Brasher deviated 700 feet from an assigned altitude in flight. As a result, a warning was issued to him months later. The warning would be named after him - the Brasher warning.\nSee also\n* List of defunct airlines of the United States\n* Revenue Technology Services (1982)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://rzjets.net/operators/?show=1066 Fleet and code information]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028141203/http://geocities.com/~aeromoe/fleets/rc.html Fleet information]\n*[https://www.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00358.xml Republic Airlines historical artifacts] - inventory list of items stored at the Minnesota Historical Society\n*[https://asn.flightsafety.org/database/operators/4398 Aviation Safety Network] &ndash; Republic Airlines\n*[https://digitalcollections.museumofflight.org/nodes/view/27712 Republic Airlines | Museum of Flight Digital Collections]"
