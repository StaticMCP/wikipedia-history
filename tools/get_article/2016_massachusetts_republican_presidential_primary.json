Massachusetts was one of eleven states that held both their Democratic and Republican presidential primaries on that day, dubbed \"Super Tuesday\". 42 delegates were allocated proportionally to all candidates who received at least 5 percent of the vote in the primary.\nState of the campaign\nDonald Trump won the Massachusetts primary comfortably, in keeping with polls that had shown him with double-digit leads over his primary rivals in the state. Trump's victory also reflected his relative strength among Republicans in the Northeastern United States. Trump received about 49% of the vote statewide. John Kasich and Marco Rubio came in second and third, respectively, each with about 18% of the vote. Ted Cruz came in fourth with just under 10% of the vote. Of the state's 42 delegates, Trump received 22 of them, Kasich and Rubio each received eight, and Cruz received four.\nDonald Trump enjoyed the endorsement of former Senator Scott Brown, who stumped for him in Massachusetts and New Hampshire ahead of the primary.\nEndorsements\n*Daily Hampshire Gazette (Northampton)\n}}\nPolling\nAggregate polls\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;line-height:17px\"\n|+\n!Source of poll\naggregation\n!Dates\nadministered\n!Dates\nupdated\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Marco Rubio\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Donald Trump\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Ted Cruz\n! class=\"unsortable\" |John Kasich\n!Margin\n|-\n|RealClearPolitics\n|until March 1, 2016\n|March 1, 2016\n|18.5%\n|  |45.3%\n|11.0%\n|15.3%\n|  |Trump +26.8\n|-\n|FiveThirtyEight\n|until March 1, 2016\n|March 1, 2016\n|19.2%\n|  |50.0%\n|9.9%\n|15.6%\n|  |Trump +30.8\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:180px;\" |Poll source\n! style=\"width:135px;\" |Date\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |1st\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |2nd\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |3rd\n!Other\n|-\n|- style=\"background:Moccasin;\"\n|Primary results\n|March 1, 2016\n|Donald Trump48.99%\n|John Kasich17.94%\n|Marco Rubio17.75%\n|Ted Cruz 9.50%, Ben Carson 2.57%, Jeb Bush 1.03%, Chris Christie 0.30%, Rand Paul 0.29%, Carly Fiorina 0.18%, Jim Gilmore 0.12%, Mike Huckabee 0.11%, Mike Huckabee 0.08%, George Pataki 0.08%, Rick Santorum 0.05%\n|-\n|Emerson College\nMargin of error: ± 4.8% Sample size: 408\n|February 26–28, 2016\n|  |Donald Trump51%\n|Marco Rubio\n20%\n|John Kasich\n14%\n|Ted Cruz 10%, Ben Carson 1%, Undecided 1%\n|-\n|UMass Amherst/WBZ\nMargin of error: ± 6.3% Sample size: 292\n|February 24–26, 2016\n|  |Donald Trump47%\n|Marco Rubio\n15%\n|Ted Cruz\n15%\n|John Kasich 11%, Ben Carson 2%, Other 7%, Don't Know 3%\n|-\n|Suffolk University\nMargin of error: ± 4.4% Sample size: 500\n|February 24–26, 2016\n|  |Donald Trump42.6%\n|Marco Rubio\n19.8%\n|John Kasich\n17%\n|Ted Cruz 8.8%, Ben Carson 3.8%, Other 1%, Don't Know 7%\n|-\n|MassINC/WBUR\nMargin of error: ± 4.9% Sample size: 386\n|February 21–23, 2016\n|  |Donald Trump39%\n|Marco Rubio\n18%\n|John Kasich\n17%\n|Ted Cruz 9%, Ben Carson 5%, Don't Know 12%\n|-\n|Emerson College\nMargin of error: ± 5.7% Sample size: 289\n|February 19–21, 2016\n|  |Donald Trump50%\n|Marco Rubio\n16%\n|John Kasich\n13%\n|Ted Cruz 10%, Ben Carson 2%\n|-\n|Suffolk University\nMargin of error: ± ?%\nSample size: 134\n|November 19–22, 2015\n|  |Donald Trump32%\n|Marco Rubio\n18%\n|Ted Cruz 10%\n|Jeb Bush 7%, Ben Carson 5%, Carly Fiorina 4%, Chris Christie 4%, John Kasich 2%, Rand Paul 1%, Mike Huckabee 0%, Rick Santorum 0%, Lindsey Graham 0%, George Pataki 0%, Jim Gilmore 0%, Undecided 14%\n|-\n|Emerson College\nMargin of error: ± 5.9%\nSample size: 271\n|October 16–18, 2015\n|  |Donald Trump47.8%\n|Ben Carson\n13.9%\n|Marco Rubio\n11.8%\n|Jeb Bush 7.1%, Carly Fiorina 6.5%, Ted Cruz 5.1%, John Kasich 2.8%, Chris Christie 2.3%, Lindsey Graham 0.9%, Mike Huckabee 0.4%, Rand Paul 0.1%, Undecided 1.4%\n|-\n|Emerson College\nMargin of error: ± ?\nSample size: 216\n|March 14–19, 2015\n|  |Jeb Bush19%\n|  |Scott Walker19%\n|Ben Carson\n13%\n|Rand Paul 7%, Chris Christie 6%, Ted Cruz 6%, Mike Huckabee 3%, Other/Undecided 28%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Suffolk University\nMargin of error: ± 4.9%\nSample size: 400\n| rowspan=\"2\" |August 21–24, 2014\n|  |Chris Christie11%\n|  |Paul Ryan11%\n|  |Jeb Bush10.75%\n|Rand Paul 10.5%, Mike Huckabee 7%, Scott Walker 6.75%, Marco Rubio 5.75%, Rick Perry 4.75%, Ted Cruz 4.25%, Bobby Jindal 3.5%, Rick Santorum 2.75%, Jon Huntsman Jr. 1.75%, John Kasich 1%, Undecided 18.25%, Other 0.5%, Refused 0.5%\n|-\n|  |Mitt Romney48.62%\n|Chris Christie\n7.69%\n|Paul Ryan\n5.54%\n|Jeb Bush 5.23%, Ted Cruz 3.69%, Jon Huntsman Jr. 3.38%, Bobby Jindal 3.38%, Rand Paul 3.38%, Scott Walker 3.38%, Mike Huckabee 3.08%, Marco Rubio 2.77%, Rick Perry 1.54%, John Kasich 1.23%, Rick Santorum 1.23%, Undecided 4.92%, Refused 0.92%\n|}\nAnalysis\nMassachusetts was Trump's best Super Tuesday state.
