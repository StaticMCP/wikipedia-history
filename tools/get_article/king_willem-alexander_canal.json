The new canal through the Hondsrug is part of the larger Veenvaart project to draw more recreational boaters and tourists to the Veenkoloniën region in the provinces of Drenthe and Groningen.\nThe canal was originally to be called the Veenkanaal but was renamed on 8 June 2013 in honor of recently enthroned King Willem-Alexander.\nReferences"
