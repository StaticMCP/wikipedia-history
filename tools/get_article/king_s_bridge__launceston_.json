The bridge span was constructed in Manchester, England and was transported to Launceston for final assembly.  At the time it was named the Cataract or South Esk Bridge''' and it was the only form of vehicular crossing of that river in Launceston.\nIn 1904, a second, parallel span was added to widen the bridge.  This span was almost identical to the original span, but was fabricated locally in Launceston, instead of overseas.\nEngineering heritage award\nThe received a  Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.\nReferences"
