Others, such as Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, held the lead role for many years but were in Virginia for only a short portion of that time and usually delegated responsibilities to others. Probably for those reasons, in many historical documents and references, the deputies and lieutenant governors who had the primary responsibility in Virginia are also often titled simply \"governor.\" Also, transportation from England routinely took several months and occasionally, much longer. Thus, dates may appear to overlap.\nGovernor of Virginia (1585–1590)\nThe first English attempt to colonize Virginia was the \"Lost Colony\" of Roanoke. Unsuccessful settlements were established under two different governors, and the final fate of the colonists remains unknown.\n* Sir Walter Raleigh, Governor of Virginia (1585–1590, absentee)\n** Sir Ralph Lane, Governor of Roanoke (Virginia) (1585–1586)\n** John White, Governor of Raleigh (Virginia) (1587–1590)\nVirginia Company of London Governors (1607–1624)\nFrom 1606 until 1624, Proprietary Governors oversaw the operation of the Virginia Colony.

Governors were appointed by the ruling monarch to oversee the interests of the Crown.  During the interregnum period (1649–1660), when England came under commonwealth rule and the protectorate rule of Oliver and Richard Cromwell, those governments appointed Virginia's governors.  William Berkeley, who was governor at the time of the execution of King Charles I, remained in office until the arrival of a Commonwealth fleet in 1651 led to his removal.  Berkeley was returned to office by votes of the Virginia assembly and by appointment of the restored King Charles II in 1660.\n*Governor Sir Francis Wyatt (1624–1626)\n*Governor Sir George Yeardley (1626–1627)\n*Acting Governor Francis West (1627–1629)\n*Governor Sir John Harvey (1628–1639)\n**Acting Governor John Pott (1629–1630)\n**Acting Governor John West (1635–1636)\n**Acting Governor Col.
