The first meeting saw Squib Burton win the Golden Helmet in front of over 10,000 people. The promotion soon ran into trouble in November 1930 the speedway went into liquidation. The team's assets (including the venue) were taken over by the management of the Liverpool speedway team (General Speedways (Liverpool) Ltd for £1,100. However, following a court battle, Liverpool were forced to relinquish the assets to a higher bidder.\nThe stadium found new tenants in 1931 after a greyhound track was added and the venue became the Warrington Greyhound Stadium. Many years later in 1949 the venue held speedway demonstration meetings.\nSeason summary\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=350|Year and league\n!width=50|Position\n!width=350|Notes\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1929 Speedway English Dirt Track League ||N/A || withdrew, results expunged\n|- align=center\n|align=\"left\"| 1930 Speedway Southern League || 5th ||\n|}\nReferences"
