Known as the \"Garden of the Gulf\", the island is located in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence north of Nova Scotia and east of New Brunswick, with which it forms the Northumberland Strait.\nOverview\nPrince Edward Island (PEI) consists of the capital city Charlottetown, as well as urban towns Cornwall and Stratford and a developing urban fringe. A smaller urban area surrounds Summerside Harbour, situated on the southern shore  west of Charlottetown Harbour, and consists primarily of the city of Summerside. As with all natural harbours on the island, Charlottetown and Summerside harbours are created by rias. (See also a list of communities in Prince Edward Island.) The highest point of land is located at Springton in Queens County, rising  above sea level.\nThe island's landscape is pastoral; rolling hills, pristine forests, white sand beaches, ocean coves and the red soil have given PEI a reputation as a province of outstanding natural beauty. A number of laws have been passed by the provincial government to attempt to preserve the landscape through regulation, although the lack of consistent enforcement and absence of province-wide zoning and land-use planning has resulted in some unsightly development in recent years.\nThe island's lush landscape has had a strong bearing on the island's culture. During the late Victorian Era, author Lucy Maud Montgomery used the island as the setting of her novel Anne of Green Gables. Today, the island attracts tourists in all seasons, with popular leisure attractions including beaches, golf courses, and eco-tourism.\nCommunities\nMost rural communities on Prince Edward Island are based on small-scale agriculture, and the average size of farm properties is less than other areas in Canada. There is an increasing amount of industrial farming as older farm properties are consolidated and modernized.\nCoastline\nThe coastline of the island consists of a combination of long beaches, dunes, red sandstone cliffs, saltwater marshes and numerous bays and harbours. The beaches, dunes and sandstone cliffs consist of sedimentary rock and other material with a high iron concentration which oxidizes upon exposure to the air. The geological properties of white silica sand found at Basin Head are unique in the province; the sand grains cause a scrubbing noise as they rub against each other under pressure. Large dune fields on the north shore can be found on barrier islands at the entrances to various bays and harbours. The sand dunes at Greenwich have a shifting, parabolic dune system that is home to a variety of birds and rare plants and is also a site of significant archaeological interest.\nClimate\nThe climate of the island is a maritime climate considered to be moderate and strongly influenced by the surrounding seas. As such, it is milder than inland locations owing to the warm waters from the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  The climate is characterized by changeable weather throughout the year; it has some of the most variable day-to-day weather in Canada, in which specific weather conditions seldom last for long.\nfreezes over, the island's climate is similar to a continental climate as opposed to an oceanic climate.]]\nDuring July and August, the average daytime high in PEI is ; however, the temperature can sometimes exceed  during these months. In the winter months of January and February, the average daytime high is . The Island receives an average yearly rainfall of  and an average yearly snowfall of .\nWinters are moderately cold and long but are milder than inland locations, with clashes of cold Arctic air and milder Atlantic air causing frequent temperature swings. The climate is considered to be more humid continental climate than oceanic since the Gulf of St. Lawrence freezes over, thus eliminating any moderation. The mean temperature is  in January. During the winter months, the island usually has many storms (which may produce rain as well as snow) and blizzards since during this time, storms originating from the North Atlantic or the Gulf of Mexico frequently pass through. Springtime temperatures typically remain cool until the sea ice has melted, usually in late April or early May.\nSummers are moderately warm, but rarely uncomfortable, with the daily maximum temperature only occasionally reaching as high as . Autumn is a pleasant season, as the moderating Gulf waters delay the onset of frost, although storm activity increases compared to the summer. There is ample precipitation throughout the year, although it is heaviest in the late autumn, early winter and mid spring.\nThe following climate chart depicts the average conditions of Charlottetown, as an example of the small province's climate.\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|collapsed = Y\n|Jan record high C = 15.1\n|Feb record high C = 13.3\n|Mar record high C = 24.5\n|Apr record high C = 26.7\n|May record high C = 31.7\n|Jun record high C = 32.2\n|Jul record high C = 33.9\n|Aug record high C = 36.7\n|Sep record high C = 31.5\n|Oct record high C = 27.8\n|Nov record high C = 21.3\n|Dec record high C = 16.7\n|year record high C = 36.7\n|Jan high C = -3.4\n|Feb high C = -2.9\n|Mar high C = 0.9\n|Apr high C = 7.2\n|May high C = 14.3\n|Jun high C = 19.4\n|Jul high C = 23.3\n|Aug high C = 22.8\n|Sep high C = 18.6\n|Oct high C = 12.3\n|Nov high C = 6.3\n|Dec high C = 0.5\n|year high C = 9.9\n|Jan mean C = −7.7\n|Feb mean C = −7.3\n|Mar mean C = -3.1\n|Apr mean C = 3.1\n|May mean C = 9.2\n|Jun mean C = 14.5\n|Jul mean C = 18.7\n|Aug mean C = 18.3\n|Sep mean C = 14.1\n|Oct mean C = 8.3\n|Nov mean C = 2.9\n|Dec mean C = -3.3\n|year mean C = 5.7\n|Jan low C = -12.1\n|Feb low C = -11.7\n|Mar low C = -7.0\n|Apr low C = -1.2\n|May low C = 4.1\n|Jun low C = 9.6\n|Jul low C = 14.1\n|Aug low C = 13.7\n|Sep low C = 9.6\n|Oct low C = 4.4\n|Nov low C = -0.5\n|Dec low C = -7.0\n|year low C = 1.3\n|Jan record low C = -32.8\n|Feb record low C = -30.6\n|Mar record low C = -27.2\n|Apr record low C = -16.1\n|May record low C = -6.7\n|Jun record low C = -1.1\n|Jul record low C = 2.8\n|Aug record low C = 2.0\n|Sep record low C = -0.6\n|Oct record low C = -6.7\n|Nov record low C = -17.2\n|Dec record low C = -28.1\n|year record low C = -32.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 101.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 83.2\n|Mar precipitation mm = 86.3\n|Apr precipitation mm = 83.7\n|May precipitation mm = 91.0\n|Jun precipitation mm = 98.8\n|Jul precipitation mm = 79.9\n|Aug precipitation mm = 95.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 95.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 112.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 112.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 118.1\n|year precipitation mm = 1158.2\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 34.1\n|Feb rain mm = 29.8\n|Mar rain mm = 44.1\n|Apr rain mm = 59.7\n|May rain mm = 87.2\n|Jun rain mm = 98.8\n|Jul rain mm = 79.9\n|Aug rain mm = 95.7\n|Sep rain mm = 95.9\n|Oct rain mm = 110.3\n|Nov rain mm = 93.0\n|Dec rain mm = 58.6\n|year rain mm = 887.1\n|snow colour = green\n|Jan snow cm = 73.3\n|Feb snow cm = 58.3\n|Mar snow cm = 44.1\n|Apr snow cm = 24.4\n|May snow cm = 3.7\n|Jun snow cm = 0.0\n|Jul snow cm = 0.0\n|Aug snow cm = 0.0\n|Sep snow cm = 0.0\n|Oct snow cm = 1.7\n|Nov snow cm = 19.2\n|Dec snow cm = 65.6\n|year snow cm = 290.4\n|unit precipitation days = 0.2 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 19.3\n|Feb precipitation days = 15.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 15.9\n|Apr precipitation days = 15.3\n|May precipitation days = 14.1\n|Jun precipitation days = 13.2\n|Jul precipitation days = 12.6\n|Aug precipitation days = 11.7\n|Sep precipitation days = 12.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 15.0\n|Nov precipitation days = 16.9\n|Dec precipitation days = 19.8\n|year precipitation days = 182.4\n|unit rain days = 0.2 mm\n|Jan rain days = 6.3\n|Feb rain days = 5.0\n|Mar rain days = 7.5\n|Apr rain days = 11.6\n|May rain days = 13.8\n|Jun rain days = 13.2\n|Jul rain days = 12.6\n|Aug rain days = 11.7\n|Sep rain days = 12.8\n|Oct rain days = 14.6\n|Nov rain days = 13.0\n|Dec rain days = 8.6\n|year rain days = 130.8\n|unit snow days = 0.2 cm\n|Jan snow days = 17.3\n|Feb snow days = 13.7\n|Mar snow days = 12.2\n|Apr snow days = 6.4\n|May snow days = 0.93\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.03\n|Oct snow days = 1.0\n|Nov snow days = 6.4\n|Dec snow days = 15.3\n|year snow days = 73.2\n|Jan sun = 108.9\n|Feb sun = 109.1\n|Mar sun = 141.3\n|Apr sun = 148.2\n|May sun = 197.1\n|Jun sun = 219.8\n|Jul sun = 253.6\n|Aug sun = 219.0\n|Sep sun = 181.0\n|Oct sun = 123.9\n|Nov sun = 62.9\n|Dec sun = 75.8\n|year sun = 1840.5\n|Jan percentsun = 38.8\n|Feb percentsun = 37.6\n|Mar percentsun = 38.3\n|Apr percentsun = 36.5\n|May percentsun = 42.5\n|Jun percentsun = 46.6\n|Jul percentsun = 53.2\n|Aug percentsun = 49.9\n|Sep percentsun = 47.9\n|Oct percentsun = 36.5\n|Nov percentsun = 22.1\n|Dec percentsun = 28.1\n|year percentsun = 39.8\n|source 1 = Environment Canada\n|date= August 2010\n}}\nSee also\n*List of parks in Prince Edward Island\n*List of islands of Prince Edward Island\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"
