      "text": "# Tall Dwarfs\n\nTall Dwarfs are a New Zealand rock band formed in 1981 by Chris Knox and Alec Bathgate, who helped pioneer the lo-fi style of rock music. The duo were former members of Toy Love.\nThe band lacked a drummer, but would use household objects and hand claps to act as percussion. Both members can play guitar, with 12 strings and bass guitar often heard on their records. Both can play organ as well, which has been utilised on some of their songs. The Casiotone is frequently used too, especially on live concerts.\nTheir debut was the EP Three Songs (1981), and for many years they released EPs only. The album Weeville (1990) was their first full-length album. They did, however, release a number of full-length compilations of their EPs, like Hello Cruel World and The Short and Sick of It.\nIn the liner notes to their album 3 EPs (1994) (released as a single CD, or as three vinyl EPs collected in one box), they asked for listeners' rhythm tracks: \"Send us your idea of a great T.D. throb.\" The responses came from many countries and were used for the next album, Stumpy (1997). This album was credited to \"International Tall Dwarfs.\"\nBands who have claimed to be influenced by the Tall Dwarfs include Guided by Voices, Jay Reatard, Superchunk, Elf Power, Neutral Milk Hotel and Olivia Tremor Control. In 2005, they did a small number of concerts in the US, playing with the Olivia Tremor Control.\nDiscography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|Date of Release\n!  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|Title\n!  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|Label\n|- style=\"background:#ddd;\"\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| EPs\n|-\n|1981\n|Three Songs\n|Furtive Records\n|-\n|1982\n|Louis Likes His Daily Dip\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1983\n|Canned Music\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1984\n|Slugbucket Hairybreath Monster\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1985\n|''That's the Short and Long of It\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1986\n|Throw a Sickie\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1987\n|Dogma\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1998\n|Gluey, Gluey and The Ear Friend\n|Flying Nun Records\n|- style=\"background:#ddd;\"\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Albums\n|-\n|1990\n|Weeville\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1991\n|Fork Songs\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1994\n|3 EPs\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1996\n|Stumpy (as the International Tall Dwarfs)\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1998\n|Fifty Flavours of Glue\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|2002\n|The Sky Above the Mud Below\n|Flying Nun Records\n|- style=\"background:#ddd;\"\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Compilation Albums\n|-\n|1988\n|Hello Cruel World\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|1992\n|The Short and Sick of It\n|Flying Nun Records\n|-\n|2022\n|Unravelled: 1981 - 2002''\n|Merge Records\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/tall-dwarfs Audioculture profile]\n* [http://www.flyingnun.co.nz/ Flying Nun] – Flying Nun Records official website"
