He studied at Deccan College in Pune to receive his master's degree in 1873. He then served for a few years as a teacher in Akola. He was awarded Rao Bahadur in 1913.\nThe liberal views of Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade had highly influenced Mahajani's thinking. He used to attend several meetings of Prarthana Samaj, where abhang of  Sant Tukaram would often be recited. The recitations developed his deep interest in the works of Tukaram. In 1902, he delivered lectures on the works of Tukaram at the Hemantotsav Vyakhanmala in Mumbai. Later he translated 900 Marathi abhang of Sant Tukaram into English. (They remain unpublished.)\nMahajani wrote 12 Marathi books which comprise plays and collections of his poems, the latter including translations of some English poems. (Three of Mahajani's works remain unpublished.)\nHe chaired  Regional Social Conference, a conference related with conference of Indian National Congress, held in Dharwad in 1903.\nHe chaired in 1907 Marathi Sahitya Sammelan held in Pune.\nReferences\n* Vishnu Moreshwar Mahajani - Vykati Ani Vangmay :  Biography by Pushpa Limaye"
