The Lordship Lane and North Cross Road area now has a wide selection of bars, restaurants and specialist retailers for the 'foodie' market.\nPoints of interest\nThe architecturally meritorious Dulwich Library, which opened on 24 November 1897, is on the lane. Lordship Lane is also home of the unusual listed building, the so-called \"Concrete House\".\nThe children's author, Enid Blyton was born on 11 August 1897 above a shop in Lordship Lane. A Southwark Blue Plaque was placed there in 2003 (above 352–356 Lordship Lane, near the library).\nThe Concrete House\non Lordship Lane.]]\nOne of the most architecturally interesting buildings in the area is at 549 Lordship Lane. The so-called \"Concrete House\" grade II listed building and is an example of a 19th-century concrete house. It was built in 1873 by Charles Drake of the Patent Concrete Building Company. In 1867, the builder had patented the use of iron panels for shuttering rather than timber. It is listed on English Heritage's Buildings At Risk register. Southwark Council refused permission for its demolition.\nDerelict for many years it has now been restored with the help of the Heritage of London Trust into 5 flats, to be managed by Hexagon Housing Association. The Duke of Gloucester opened the completed building on 13 June 2013.\nHistory of the lane\nLordship Lane is East Dulwich's oldest street. It is an ancient thoroughfare that significantly predates the late 19th century developments.\nThe area was transformed from fields and market gardens to Victorian suburbs in the period 1865–1885. The tram line that once served Lordship Lane is long gone.\nLordship Lane station\n'', an intermediate station on the Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway, a LCDR branch line in London, 1871 by Camille Pissarro.]]\nLordship Lane station was a station on the Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway, built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1865, which closed along with the rest of the line on 20 September 1954. The railway crossed London Road (just beyond the southern end of Lordship Lane) on a bridge and the station was just to the south-west of the road. The site is now housing: the London Borough of Southwark's Sydenham Hill Estate.\nThis locality is also the subject of Lordship Lane Station, Dulwich, an 1871 painting by Camille Pissarro, which now hangs at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.\nGallery of shops and sites\nFile:EDT (East Dulwich Tavern), 1 Lordship Lane, London SE22 8EW.jpg|East Dulwich Tavern, 1&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:Chener Books.jpg|Chener Books, 14 Lordship Lane\nFile:East Dulwich Deli, 15-17 Lordship Lane, London SE22 8EW.jpg|East Dulwich Deli, closed, 15–17&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:Paine and Hunter Opticians, 55 Lordship Lane, London, SE22 8EP.jpg|Paine and Hunter Opticians, 55&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:Black Cherry, 21 Lordship Lane, London SE22 8EW.JPG|Black Cherry (bar & restaurant, closed), 21&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:The Bishop, 27 Lordship Lane, SE22 8EW.jpg|The Bishop (pub & restaurant), 27&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:Dulwich Cafe, 89 Lordship Lane, London SE22 8EP.jpg|Dulwich Cafe, 89&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:William Rose Butchers, 126 Lordship Lane, London SE22 8RS.jpg|Willam Rose Butchers, 126&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:The Lane Cafe, 135 Lordship Lane, London SE22 8HX.jpg|The Lane Cafe, closed, 135&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:Franklins, 157 Lordship Lane, London SE22 8HX.jpg|Franklins (bar & restaurant), 157&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:Police Station, 173-183 Lordship Lane, London SE22 8HA.jpg|Police Station, now a school, 173–183&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:Baptist Church, 257 Lordship Lane, London SE228JF.jpg|Baptist Church, 257&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nFile:Blyton blue plaque.jpg|Enid Blyton blue plaque, 352&nbsp;Lordship&nbsp;Lane\nSee also\n*Photographs ordered by address in Lordship Lane (Wikimedia Commons)\n*Dulwich Library\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.lordshiplane.co.uk/ Lordship Lane, East Dulwich]\n* [http://www.lordshiplane.co.uk/history/ History of the Lordship Lane area]\n* [http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConBar.3718 English Heritage on the Concrete House]\n* [http://www.lordshiplane.co.uk/ Lordship Lane website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090218152128/http://southwark.gov.uk/YourServices/LibrariesSection/librariesandlocations/dulwichlibrary.html Dulwich Library]"
