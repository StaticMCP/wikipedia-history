These sites demonstrate the political, economic, and historical importance of Trier during the Roman Empire as one of the four capital during the Tetrarchy period, and as a prominent city during the early days of the Holy Roman Empire in the Middle Ages.\nFrom UNESCO/CLT/WHC:\n\"Trier is an example of a large Roman capital after the division of the empire. The remains of the Imperial Palace, in addition to the Aula Palatina and the Imperial Thermae, are impressive in their dimensions. The city bears exceptional testimony to Roman civilization owing to the density and the quality of the monuments preserved: the bridge, the remains of the fortified wall, thermae, amphitheatre, storehouses, etc. In particular, funerary art and the craftsmanship of potters, glassworkers, and moneyers flourished in the city.\"\nIn 2009, the site was featured on a golden 100-Euro coin.\nConstituent sites\nNine locations in Trier are listed as part of the World Heritage Site:\n#Amphitheatre, built in the mid-2nd century and accommodating up to 20,000 people\n#Moselle Bridge:\n#Barbara Baths\n#Igel Column: a burial monument erected in the 3rd century\n#Porta Nigra: the northern gate to the Roman city\n#Imperial Baths: incomplete baths that were constructed in the 4th century.\n#Aula Palatina (Basilica): An early Christian basilica built in the early 4th century.\n#Cathedral: The oldest church in Germany\n#Church of Our Lady (Liebfrauenkirche): A Gothic church built in the 13th century.\nGallery\nFile:Trier Roman amphitheatre in October 2011.JPG|Trier Roman Amphitheatre\nFile:Trier Roemerbruecke BW 1.JPG|Trier Roman Bridge\nFile:Trier Barbarathermen.jpg|Trier Barbara Baths\nFile:Igel BW 2011-09-03 16-41-58.JPG|Igel Column\nFile:Porta Nigra morgens (100MP).jpg|Trier Porta Nigra\nFile:Trier Kaiserthermen BW 1.JPG|Trier Imperial Baths\nFile:Trier - Aula Palatina.JPG|Trier Basilica of Constantine\nFile:Trier Dom BW 1.JPG| Trier Cathedral\nFile:Trier Innenstadt3.jpg|Trier Liebfrauenkirche\nFile:Augusta Treverorum Stadtplan.png|Augusta Treverorum City Plan\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/367.pdf UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE LIST N° 367 Identification, Recommendation, Justification Document]"
