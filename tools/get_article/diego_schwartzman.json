He defeated seventh seed Nicolás Jarry in three sets before losing in the second round to Pedro Martínez.\nPlaying style\nSchwartzman tended to play as a baseline player with solid groundstrokes on both wings and the ability to counterpunch and go on the offensive. He was known for clean hitting off both his forehand and backhand and his ability to take the ball on the rise and hit it with depth and pace. Analysts consider that he played well on the defensive due to his speed and ability to hit winners from defensive positions far off of the court. His speed also allowed him to retrieve drop shots and hit passing shots easily. He also possessed solid volleys and preferred the drop volley, though they were not a major weapon in his game.\nSchwartzman had a consistent, though not outstanding, serve and arguably played better on the return than on serve. In 2017, he statistically led the ATP on return games, and second-serve points won.\nSchwartzman's speed and powerful baseline game resulted in most of his success coming on clay rather than hardcourts or grass. However, towards the middle years of his career, he attempted to add more variety to his game, resulting in breakthroughs, particularly on grass, scoring his first-ever win on grass only in 2018 at Wimbledon.\nCareer statistics\nGrand Slam performance timeline\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center;font-size:97%\n!Tournament!!2013!!2014!!2015!!2016!!2017!!2018!!2019!!2020!!2021!!2022!!2023!!2024!!SR!!W–L!!Win%\n|-\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"text-align:left\" |Grand Slam tournaments\n|-\n|bgcolor=efefef align=left|Australian Open\n|bgcolor=ecf2ff|Q3\n|bgcolor=ecf2ff|Q1\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|2R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|4R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|3R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|4R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|3R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|2R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|2R\n|bgcolor=ecf2ff|Q1\n|bgcolor=efefef|0 / 9\n|bgcolor=efefef|13–9\n|bgcolor=efefef|\n|-\n|bgcolor=efefef align=left|French Open\n|bgcolor=ecf2ff|Q2\n|bgcolor=afeeee|2R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|2R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|3R\n|bgcolor=ffebcd|QF\n|bgcolor=afeeee|2R\n|bgcolor=yellow|SF\n|bgcolor=ffebcd|QF\n|bgcolor=afeeee|4R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|3R\n|bgcolor=ecf2ff|Q2\n|bgcolor=efefef|0 / 10\n|bgcolor=efefef|23–10\n|bgcolor=efefef|\n|-\n|bgcolor=efefef align=left|Wimbledon\n|A\n|A\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|2R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|3R\n|style=color:#767676|NH\n|bgcolor=afeeee|3R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|2R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|2R\n|bgcolor=ecf2ff|Q1\n|bgcolor=efefef|0 / 8\n|bgcolor=efefef|7–8\n|bgcolor=efefef|\n|-\n|bgcolor=efefef align=left|US Open\n|bgcolor=ecf2ff|Q3\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|2R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=ffebcd|QF\n|bgcolor=afeeee|3R\n|bgcolor=ffebcd|QF\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|4R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|3R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=afeeee|1R\n|bgcolor=efefef|0 / 11\n|bgcolor=efefef|16–11\n|bgcolor=efefef|\n|-style=font-weight:bold;background:#efefef\n|style=text-align:left|Win–loss\n|0–0\n|1–2\n|2–4\n|0–4\n|7–4\n|10–4\n|9–4\n|8–3\n|11–4\n|7–4\n|4–4\n|0–1\n|0 / 38\n|59–38\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"text-align:left\" |Year End Championship\n|-\n|align=left bgcolor=efefef|ATP Finals\n|colspan=7|Did not qualify\n|bgcolor=afeeee|RR\n| colspan=\"4\" |Did not qualify\n|style=background:#efefef|0 / 1\n|style=background:#efefef|0–3\n|style=background:#efefef|\n|}\nPersonal life\nSchwartzman married Eugenia De Martino, a fashion model from Argentina, in October 2025.
