For most of the band's duration, the core members were Felix Riebl (lead vocals, percussion), Harry James Angus (trumpet, vocals), Will Hull-Brown (drums), Jamshid \"Jumps\" Khadiwhala (turntables, percussion), Ollie McGill (keyboards, backing vocals) and Ryan Monro (bass, backing vocals). Monro retired from the band in March 2021, while Angus, Hull-Brown and Khadiwhala all left in April 2022. They are often supplemented by The Empire Horns, a brass duo composed of Ross Irwin (trumpet) and Kieran Conrau (trombone), among others. Their sound is a fusion of jazz, funk, ska, and rock with heavy Latin influences.\nHistory\n1999–2003: Beginnings\nThe Cat Empire's origins are traced back to Jazz Cat, a Melbourne-based band, led by Steve Sedergreen in 1999. Jazz Cat was a nine-piece group of players from different schools and backgrounds which debuted at the Manly Jazz Festival in Sydney. They gigged around Melbourne's jazz club scene, including at Dizzy's, where Sedergreen was a part-owner. Late that year, Jazz Cat spawned the Cat Empire, originally as a three-piece, with Ollie McGill on keyboards, Felix Riebl on percussion and vocals and Ryan Monro on double bass. The band's name was taken from the title of a drawing by Riebl's younger brother, Max, and its distinctive cat's eye icon, known as \"Pablo\", was created by Ian McGill, Ollie McGill's father. For a few months, both groups performed on alternate Thursdays at Dizzy's. They started playing a variety of gigs at other clubs, including Bennett's Lane. The band expanded in July 2001 by adding Harry James Angus on trumpet, Will Hull-Brown (ex-Jazz Cat) on drums and Jamshid \"Jumps\" Khadiwala as a DJ on turntables (later also on percussion).\n, April 2011]]\nIn late 2001, the band appeared in the Spiegeltent at the Melbourne Festival. By year's end, they had released an independent single, \"Feline\", in October, and a live six-track extended play, Live @ Adelphia, in December. In early 2002, the group played gigs at the Adelaide Festival of Arts, and in March, they headlined the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and St Kilda Film Festival. The ensemble commenced its first overseas tour on the West Coast of the United States, playing at The Matrix in San Francisco and at the Napa Valley Wine Auction in June. The band received a Music for the Future grant to fund the recording of a live album, The Sun, at Melbourne's Adelphia Studios. At the Edinburgh Festival, they played sixteen successive shows in the Late 'n' Live slot between 3 A.M. and 5 A.M. They performed at the 2002 Melbourne Festival and a series of local gigs; Kate Ceberano appeared as a guest vocalist at their final show for the year.\n2003–2005: Debut album\nThe Cat Empire recorded their debut studio album, The Cat Empire, in seven months during 2003 with producer Andy Baldwin in Melbourne. Between recording sessions they toured Australia, including appearing at the St Kilda Festival with Ceberano, and at the East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival in April. The ensemble was nominated in two categories at the Australian Jazz Bell Awards. They successfully applied for an International Pathways grant from the Australia Council for the Arts. The band was featured on BBC Four performing at the 2003 WOMAD festival. The lead single, \"Hello\", was placed on high rotation on BBC Radio 1 in August. The group's growing live and critical reputation enabled them to approach record companies for a deal to issue the album in August. They signed with EMI and Virgin Records, and, in the UK, with an independent label.\n2005–2006: Two Shoes\nThe Cat Empire released their second album, Two Shoes, on 19 April 2005. It was recorded in Havana, Cuba, at Egrem Studios, late in 2004, with production by the Cat Empire, Riebl and Jerry Boys. It debuted at number&nbsp;1 and until 2016 was their only album to reach the number-one position. The tracks were more Latin in flavour, with a higher proportion written by Angus than on the first album. AllMusic's Jeff Tamarkin wrote \"Skipping merrily from alt-rock crunch to hip-hop beats, landing on reggae/ska, Latin jazz, and points in between, Two Shoes is clever and brainy, danceable and absorbing\". The Australian version contains a hidden track, called \"1001\", which is coupled with the track, \"The Night That Never End\". The lead single, \"Sly\", was issued ahead of the album on 28 March and reached the top&nbsp;30. The song appeared on EA Sports' FIFA 08 soundtrack. \"The Car Song\", written by Angus, was released as the second single in July, and peaked in the top&nbsp;50.\nIn July, the band played two sets at the Cambridge Folk Festival. Later in the month, they performed a set on Sunday evening of Sheep Music. In October, Two Shoes Deluxe Edition DVD was released, which contained live footage of \"Lullaby\" and \"The Car Song\", a documentary on the making of the album in Cuba, the original video clips created for the album, and behind-the-scenes footage. The ensemble also featured on a Triple J CD entitled Like a Version, featuring cover versions of songs performed by artists on Mel Bampton's show, Mel in the Morning. Their track was a version of \"Hotel California\" (originally by the Eagles), sung in French by Angus. By the end of 2005, The Cat Empire achieved double platinum certificate and Two Shoes achieved platinum status.\n2006–2010: Cities to So Many Nights\nIn March 2006, the Cat Empire participated in the opening ceremony of the Melbourne Commonwealth Games, playing their own compositions for approximately an hour as the Games' athletes entered the stadium, introducing the group to an estimated worldwide audience of one billion. The band signed an American record deal with Velour Recordings, who released a modified version of the second Australian album, Two Shoes, which included some songs previously released on their debut.\nOn 1 April 2006, the group issued their third studio album, Cities (aka Cities: The Cat Empire Project) in Australia, which peaked at number&nbsp;11. Described by the group as \"between a tribute to our own city and an experiment in sounds that we've found abroad\", a limited edition of 10,000 individually numbered copies were made available. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006, they won the Best World Music Album category, and received a nomination for Engineer of the Year for Adam Rhodes' work on the album.\n, West Coast Blues & Roots Festival, April 2011]]\nThe band toured extensively over the year, visiting Asia, America and Europe and playing over 45 gigs in 12 countries.\nThe ensemble started 2007 with a busy touring schedule and US TV appearances, including the Late Show with David Letterman in February, followed by The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in March.

In June, on the group's European tour, they appeared on the Avalon Stage at the Glastonbury Festival, where the mud was so deep that Riebl and Khadiwhala performed the \"gumboot shuffle\".\nThe Cat Empire released their fourth album, So Many Nights in Australia on 22 September 2007, it was produced by John Porter and reached number&nbsp;two. The lead single, \"No Longer There\", was issued two weeks earlier and peaked at number&nbsp;12. \"So Many Nights\" was listed at number&nbsp;50 on the Triple J Hottest 100 for 2007, while \"No Longer There\" finished at number&nbsp;62.\nIn February 2008, the band concluded their Outdoor Australian Tour, with performances in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Newcastle, Canberra, Geelong, Townsville and Launceston. The group later played at an Australian Grand Prix event, sharing the stage with KISS. In March, the band headlined on the Sunday night at the East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival in Byron Bay. After this show, Angus quit the band, prompting the band to stop performing for 9 months until reuniting for a small European tour in December.\nIn January 2009, the ensemble opened the Sydney Festival 2009 at The Domain. In early February, they performed at Hisense Arena as part of the Australian Open for A Day on the Baseline. Also in February, the group issued Live on Earth – a live album featuring 22 songs recorded around the world – and a DVD Live at the Bowl of their Sidney Myer Music Bowl performance, with other shows and on-the-road videos. They issued a box set which was limited to 2000 copies. It contained the Live on Earth CD and DVD as well as a tour diary written by Monro, and band memorabilia.
