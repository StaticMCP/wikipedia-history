      "text": "# Bevo Francis Award\n\nThe Bevo Francis Award is an American college basketball award given annually since 2016. The award recognizes the top small college basketball player in the United States for a given season. The award is named after the late Bevo Francis, who earned national acclaim and All-American status for Rio Grande College in the 1950s.\nEligible players must come from below NCAA Division I. Players are eligible if they compete in one of the following college basketball divisions: NCAA Divisions II or III; NAIA (and while the NAIA had classifications of Divisions I or II between 2016 and 2020); USCAA Divisions I or II; and NCCAA Divisions I or Division II.\nThe first winner was Dominez Burnett of Davenport University. Only two schools, Northwest Missouri State University and Nova Southeastern University, have won the award more than once.\nWinners\n, Davenport, 2016]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
