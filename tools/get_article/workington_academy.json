It was established in September 2015 following the merger of Southfield Technology College and Stainburn School and Science College.\nHistory\nEstablishment\nIn 2014, both Southfield Technology College and Stainburn School and Science College were placed into special measures by Ofsted after receiving inadequate inspection reports. As a result, it was decided that the two schools would close and merge to form a new academy.\nTo support the transition, an executive headteacher, Lorrayne Hughes, was appointed. It was also announced that William Howard School in Brampton would act as the sponsor for the new academy. This led to the formation of the William Howard Trust, a multi-academy trust, in September 2015, which was later renamed Cumbria Education Trust.\nBoth schools officially closed in August 2015, and Workington Academy opened the following month.\nNew Building\nWorkington Academy was initially located in the building of the former Stainburn School and Science College. In 2015, plans for a new £20 million building were approved by Cumbria County Council, with construction taking place at the rear of the existing site.\nThe new building was completed in early 2017, and the academy officially relocated in March 2017. The new building was officially opened by The Duchess of Gloucester in a ceremony held in September 2017.\nWest Coast Sixth Form\n| mark-coord =\n| label = Workington Academy\n| label-pos = bottom\n| mark-coord1 =\n| label1 = Whitehaven Academy\n| label-pos1 = right\n| zoom = 10\n}}\n}}\nIn September 2020, Workington Academy launched the West Coast Sixth Form in partnership with The Whitehaven Academy. The initiative was designed to expand post-16 education opportunities across West Cumbria, offering a broad range of academic and vocational courses.\nThe sixth form provides qualifications equivalent to one, two, or three A Levels, including Extended Certificates, National Diplomas, and Extended Diplomas. Courses offered include Business, Health and Social Care, Performing Arts, Applied Science, Sports Science, and Information Technology.\nStudents benefit from a combination of classroom-based learning and practical experience, with many vocational courses including a weekly workplace placement. Free transport is provided between the Workington and Whitehaven campuses to support accessibility.\nWorkington Academy Radio\nWorkington Academy Radio is the student-run radio station of Workington Academy.\nIn 2020, students from the station conducted an interview with BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Group\n!Award\n!Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2019\n| rowspan=\"3\" |The Young ARIAS\n|Best in Sport\n|\n|-\n|Best in Comedy/Drama\n|\n|-\n| Secondary Radio Station of the Year\n|\n|-\n| 2020\n| Young Audio Awards\n| Secondary Radio Station of the Year\n|\n|-\n| 2023\n| Young Audio Awards\n| Secondary Radio Station of the Year\n|\n|}\nPublic criticism\nIn July 2017, Workington Academy faced criticism on social media, where parents and pupils raised concerns about the quality of teaching. Comments posted on a local Facebook page, \"Workington Rants - News And Views\", alleged an overreliance on supply teachers and a lack of classroom discipline, including claims that students were using mobile phones during lessons.\nThe interim headteacher at the time, Colette Macklin, responded to the criticism in an interview with the News and Star, defending the school and addressing the concerns raised.\nHeadteachers\nSince its establishment in 2015, Workington Academy has been led by the following headteachers:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
