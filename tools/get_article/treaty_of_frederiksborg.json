      "text": "# Treaty of Frederiksborg\n\nThe Treaty of Frederiksborg () was a treaty signed at Frederiksborg Castle, Zealand, on 3 July 1720 (14 July 1720 according to the Gregorian calendar), ending the Great Northern War between Denmark–Norway and Sweden.\nHistory\nThe Danish-Swedish conflict began with a Danish attack in 1700 but Sweden forced a peace the same year, while continuing to fight Russia. Denmark rejoined the war in 1709 in a campaign to regain their lost provinces; Scania, Blekinge, and Halland. Denmark participated until the Swedish defeat, primarily at the hands of Russia, in 1721.\nSweden paid 600,000 Riksdaler in damages, broke her alliance with Holstein and forfeited her right to duty-free passage of Öresund. Denmark also gained full control over Schleswig, while Danish-held areas of Swedish Pomerania were returned to Sweden.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ieg-friedensvertraege.de/treaty/1720%20VII%203%20Friedensvertrag%20von%20Frederiksborg/t-25-1-de.html?h=1 scan and transcription of the treaty, in French, hosted by IEG Mainz]"
