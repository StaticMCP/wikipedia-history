The score system will be based on:\n* Self-Evaluation – 3,000 points\n* On-Site Audience Vote – 7,000 points\nFor the Self-Evaluation, each boy group would send five members to each vote for three aces and three teams, excluding their team's Ace and their own teams, respectively.\nFor the On-Site Audience Vote, 300 on-site audience must vote for their more preferred team in each VS battle, and also vote for three aces (for the Ace Ranking) and three boy groups out of all seven teams (for the Team Ranking).

However, if the first placed group in the Team Ranking and the group with the first-place Ace are not the same, a one-on-one Ace Battle would be done between the two teams to own the right to cue sheet arrangement. The voting shall be done via self-evaluation — with each team sending the number of members equivalent to the least number of members among the five remaining teams. Since The New Six and Tempest have the least number of members among the remaining five, having 6 members, six members will vote from each team, making a total of 30 voters for the Ace Battle.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 1-on-1 Ace Battle results\n!\n!

For this round, there would be two Aces per team. The score system for the Team Ranking and Ace Ranking will be similar as that of Round 1:\n* Self-Evaluation – 3,000 points\n* On-Site Audience Vote – 7,000 points\nAfter the second round, one team would be eliminated. The candidates for elimination will be the seventh-place team in the Team Ranking and the seventh-place ace in the Ace Ranking on the cumulative scores and ranking from Rounds 1 to 2. The team to be eliminated will be determined by an Ace Battle between the two teams. If a team places seventh both in the cumulative Ace Ranking and Team Ranking, then they would be eliminated immediately without holding an Ace Battle.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Round 2: Identity results\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Team\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Performance Song\n! colspan=\"2\" | Team\n! colspan=\"3\" | Ace\n|-\n!
