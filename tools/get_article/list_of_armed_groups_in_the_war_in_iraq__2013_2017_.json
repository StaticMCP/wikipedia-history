Part of the Iraqi conflict, the war escalated in 2013, following a 2011–2013 insurgency and the rise of the Islamic State. Following the liberation of much of Islamic State-held territory in 2017, only a low-level insurgency continued after. The Islamic State had a major involvement during the war, until it was militarily defeated in Iraq by Iraqi and  western coalition forces in December 2017. Baathist supporters and some Sunni groups also fought against the Government of Iraq and its allies. The Peshmerga fought against the Islamic State and other forces during the war; though not against the government, and they did not join the Iraqi forces.\nWar in Iraq (2013–2017)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Prior to this, the two had worked together against IS, however fighting between Kurdish forces and Turkmen groups in the PMF had occurred sporadically since 2015.\n* Coalition forces support both the Iraq government and Kurdish forces against IS, but are not involved in their conflict with one another and have urged for peaceful resolution.\n* Turkey supported Kurdish forces against IS until 2017, but have since voiced support for Iraqi forces in their fight against the Kurds.\n* The MCIR reportedly has a truce agreement with the Kurdish Regional Government not to target Kurdish territory, in return for the Regional Government's non-interference in the Council creating an autonomous area outside of the control of the current Iraqi government.\nSee also\n* Belligerents in the Syrian civil war\n** List of armed groups in the Syrian civil war spillover in Lebanon\n* List of armed groups in the Second Libyan Civil War\n* List of armed groups in the Yemeni civil war\n* Combatants of the Iraq War\nReferences"
