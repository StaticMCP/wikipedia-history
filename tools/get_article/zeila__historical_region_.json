The region was named after the port city of Zeila in modern-day Somalia.\nGeography\n(Galla), and Kingdom of Bale to its immediate west, while the Mogadishu lies to the south.]]In the medieval Arab world the Muslim inhabited domains in the Horn of Africa were often referred to as Zeila to differentiate them from the Christian territories designated Habasha. According to Ibn Battuta, a journey through the whole of Zeila and the Mogadishu region would take eight weeks to complete.\nFourteenth century Arab historian Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari recounted on the usage of the term and its origin being the city of Zeila, a vital port in the region.\nThe Muslim inhabited territories during this period spanned from the commercial port city of Zeila to a place further inland called Walalah. Ethiopian scholar Taddesse Tamrat noted that according to the Arab historian Al-Maqrizi, Jabarta was also considered part of the region of Zeila.\nHistory\nThe term Zeila in the thirteenth century was often interchangeable with the Ifat Sultanate which ruled over the entire region and later in the fourteenth century onwards used to denote its successor state the Adal Sultanate as well as Adal region. Throughout this period the attribution \"al-Zaylai\" frequently signified an individual from this region however it was not made consistently clear whether it referred to the denizens of city specifically or the Muslims further inland.\nIn the fourteenth century Egyptian historian al-Maqrizi mentions the inhabitants of Zeila country were fond of the narcotic khat leaf grown in the region. One of the earliest accounts of coffee in text is by the sixteenth century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami who writes about its development from a tree in the Zeila region.\nThe fifteenth-century empress Eleni of Ethiopia was styled as \"queen of Zeila\" due to her Muslim upbringing and connection to the Hadiya Sultanate. The leaders of Adal were also often referred to as Zeila kings in texts most notably Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi conqueror of Abyssinia.\nMedieval Portuguese missionary Manuel de Almeida recorded the sixteenth century Oromo Invasions into the Zeila region, which he described as a form of divine retribution directed at Abyssinia and the Adal Sultanate:\nThe seventeenth century saw the decline of Adal, described as being divided into smaller separate states due to the “long and bloody” wars waged on Abyssinia. According to Samuel Augustus Mitchell, the neighbouring port of Berbera was flourishing in trade stretching through depths of Ethiopia from the Emirate of Harar whose Sultan ruled over the Somalis. However during this period, British government official James Henson noted that Berbera and Zeila was controlled by the local Isaaq merchant Sharmake Ali Saleh.\nInhabitants\nAccording to John Fage and I.M. Lewis, the main inhabitants of Zeila were ancestral to the Somali tribes who historically resided in the region. According to British explorer Richard Burton, al-Maqrizi mentions the \"Kingdom of Zayla\" using the Harari moniker. The Somalis were among the earliest converts to the Islamic religion. Often presented as evidence for this conversion is the Masjid al-Qiblatayn built in Zeila during the first Migration to Abyssinia.\nWith the spread of Islam into Africa in the seventh century, the Somali language, especially certain northern dialects were influenced immensely by Arabic as well as the Harari language with traditional titles such as Garad, Malaq, and Aw adopted by various Somali clans. The Zeila region itself positioned at the crossroads of two continents has often been included under the sphere of the South Semitic languages.\nIn the nineteenth century the inhabitants of Zeila narrated to one British commissioner that the ruined town of Amud (in the Zeila region) was built by the ancient Harla people. The British commissioner attested to the similarities between the ruins of Amud and that of the walled city of Harar.\nReferences"
