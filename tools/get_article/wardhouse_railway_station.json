It was originally built for Pedro Carlos Gordon, who lived in a nearby mansion. A second platform was added in 1889. A gate box opened when the line was doubled in 1896. It became a full box in 1898, downgraded to a gate box in 1915, upgraded to a full box again in 1920 and demoted to a gate box on 1931. It closed to both passengers and goods traffic on 5 June 1961.\nReferences\nExternal links\nLine open, station closed|previous=Line open, station open|route=Great North of Scotland Railway|col= }}"
