The Representation of the People Act 1948 reorganised constituencies: all MPs were now elected single-seat constituencies using FPTP, ending the two-seat constituencies which had been in place till then, and the university constituency of Queen's University of Belfast was abolished.\nResults\nIn the election as a whole, the Labour Party led by Clement Attlee as Prime Minister was returned with a narrow majority, while the Conservative Party, which included the Ulster Unionists, led by Sir Winston Churchill, continued in opposition.\n}}\n|gain       = 1\n|loss       = 0\n|net        = +1\n|votes      = 352,334\n|votes %    = 62.8\n|seats %    = 83.3\n|plus/minus = -4.0\n}}\n|}\nMPs elected\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
