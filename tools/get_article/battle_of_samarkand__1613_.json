Imam-kuli-khan crossed paths with them, who despite the support of his brother Nadir-Muhammad-sultan, the ruler of Balkh, was defeated and returned to the capital in a pitiful state. The return of the eastern regions of the state proved to be a challenging task, so Imam-kuli-khan decided to help bring a reliable ally from among the Kazakh sultans to power. The opportunity for this soon arose.\nReferences"
