In total, he awarded it to 26 people \"who have made an outstanding contribution to the State of Israel or to humanity, through their talents, services, or in any other form.\" The medal, based on the French Légion d'Honneur, was designed by Yossi Matityahu and includes a verse from the Book of Samuel, which loosely translates as \"head and shoulders [above the rest].\nPresident Isaac Herzog revived the institution of the medal in 2022, awarding it for the first time since Shimon Peres in 2014.
