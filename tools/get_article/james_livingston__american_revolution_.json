Livingston was living in the Province of Quebec (as it was known following the French and Indian War) when the American Revolutionary War broke out.  He was responsible for raising and leading the 1st Canadian Regiment of the Patriots' Continental Army during the invasion of northeastern Canada, and continued to serve in the war until 1781.  He retired to Saratoga, New York, where he served as a state legislator and raised a family of five children.\nEarly life\nJames Livingston was born March 27, 1747, in Albany, New York, to Johanes \"John\" Livingston (1709–1791) and Catherine Ten Broeck (1715–1801).  His siblings included Margerita Livingston (1742–1820), Dirck Livingston (1744–1784), Janet Livingston (1751–1823), Abraham Livingston (1753–1802), Catherine (née Livingston) Willard (1755–1827), and Maria Livingston (1761–1839).\nHis paternal grandfather was Robert Livingston the Younger (1663–1725), a nephew of Robert Livingston the Elder.  His paternal grandmother, Margareta Schuyler (b. 1682), was the daughter of Pieter Schuyler (1657–1724), the first Mayor of Albany.  They were all members of the prominent Livingston family.  His maternal grandparents were Dirck Ten Broeck  (1686–1751) and Margarita Cuyler (1682–1783).  His mother, the great-granddaughter of Dirck Wesselse Ten Broeck (1638–1717), was the sister of General Abraham Ten Broeck (1734–1810), who married Elizabeth Van Rensselaer, and Christina Ten Broeck (1718–1801), who married Philip Livingston (1716–1778), and Sara Ten Broeck, who married Johannes Ten Eyck.  Among his many cousins was Dirck Ten Broeck (1765–1832), the Speaker of the New York State Assembly from 1798 to 1800.\nBy 1765, the family had moved to Montreal.\nAmerican Revolutionary War\nLivingston was living in Chambly, working as a grain merchant, when the invasion of northeastern Quebec began in September 1775.  As early as August, he had been in contact with General Philip Schuyler, mostly through the efforts of John Brown, an American spy. On August 18, he sent a messenger to Schuyler at Fort Ticonderoga, presumably with information on British military readiness at Fort Chambly and Fort Saint-Jean;  however, this messenger destroyed the message, fearing he might be captured with it. General Richard Montgomery (who was married to one of Livingston's relatives), who was in command of Ticonderoga at the time, sent John Brown back to Livingston. On the 28th, they sent word back to Montgomery with news that spurred him to begin the invasion: the British had almost completed ships capable of threatening the American naval superiority on Lake Champlain.\nUp to, and then also following, the arrival of the American forces at Île aux Noix in early September, Livingston was active in the Chambly area, raising local support for the Americans. On September 15, he reported to Schuyler that militia under his control had cut off Fort Chambly from communication with Montreal, and that Brown and Ethan Allen were raising additional troops and guarding the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence River.\nForces under his command, numbering about 200, participated in the capture of Fort Chambly on October 18, along with militia under Brown's command. On November 20, Montgomery made him a colonel in the Continental Army, and gave him command of the 1st Canadian Regiment, consisting mainly of the troops he had recruited.  This regiment then served at the battle of Quebec in December 1775, and the ensuing retreat. They later saw action in the Saratoga campaign, including the relief of the siege of Fort Stanwix in August 1777, both Battles of Saratoga, and the Battle of Rhode Island.\nLivingston was in command of Verplanck's Point on the Hudson River in September 1780, when he played a crucial role in the unmasking of Benedict Arnold's treachery. While on guard duty, his troops fired on the British sloop of war Vulture, forcing that vessel to retreat southwards. This ship had brought British Major John André to meet with General Arnold. After being driven off in his approach by water, he attempted to re-approach on land by portaging in civilian clothing. He was captured with incriminating papers in his possession. André was hanged as a spy, and Arnold, knowing that his plot had been discovered, managed to escape to the British lines.\nLivingston retired from the Continental Army on January 1, 1781. In recognition of his service, he was granted  of land near where Tyre, New York is today. In 1801, Congress awarded him another  of land near the modern location of Columbus, Ohio.\nPost-war\nAfter the war, Livingston settled in Saratoga.  From July 1, 1783 until June 30, 1788, he served in the New York State Assembly beginning with the 7th Legislature and continuing through the 8th, 9th, 10th, and finally, the 11th New York State Legislature as a Federalist.  He served again from July 1, 1789 until June 30, 1791 during the 13th and 14th Legislatures.\nLivingston served as a member of the first Board of Regents of the University of New York from April 13, 1787 until his resignation in 1797. He was replaced by Abraham Van Vechten.\nDeath\nLivingston died in Saratoga, New York, in 1832, at age 85.\nPersonal life\nIn 1772, Livingston had married Elizabeth Simpson (1750–1800), an immigrant from Cork, Ireland living in Montreal.
