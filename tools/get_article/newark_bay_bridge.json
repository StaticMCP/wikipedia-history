Casciano Memorial Bridge, is a steel through arch bridge that is continuous across three spans. It crosses Newark Bay and connects the cities of Newark (in Essex County) and Bayonne (in Hudson County) in New Jersey, United States. It was completed April 4, 1956, as part of the New Jersey Turnpike's Newark Bay (Hudson County) Extension, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony led by Governor of New Jersey Robert B. Meyner.\nThe main span is , with a  clearance over water to allow marine access to Port Newark. The bridge is similar in design to the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge, and was similar in length to the Francis Scott Key Bridge at Baltimore's Outer Harbor. It runs parallel to the earlier built Lehigh Valley Terminal Railway's Upper Bay Bridge.\nThis bridge is also known as \"The Turnpike Bridge\" and \"The Turnpike Extension Bridge\". It carries traffic on a toll regulated section of Interstate 78 along the New Jersey Turnpike to interchanges 14 through 14A. It provides access from the New Jersey Turnpike's main roadway to Hudson County, New Jersey and the Holland Tunnel. The turnpike route creates the border between Bayonne and Jersey City and then runs northward along Port Jersey, Liberty State Park, and Downtown Jersey City. Hoboken is just north of the entrance to Holland Tunnel which continues to  Lower Manhattan in New York City.\nFrom March 2014 until May 2019, during certain hours, the eastbound shoulder of the Turnpike Extension (including the bridge) was opened for normal traffic (by green arrows above, instead of red Xs), for a total of 5 lanes (3 eastbound, 2 westbound). This system was discontinued on May 20, 2019.\nThere is a long-term capital improvements project to build a new bridge.\nFile:Newark Bay Bridge at night time.jpg|The bridge at night\nFile:Bottom of the Newark Bay Bridge.jpg|Under the bridge\nFile:2014-05-07 16 26 18 View of the Newark Bay Bridge from an airplane heading for Newark Airport-recropped.jpg|Aerial view with the Upper Bay Bridge in the foreground\nFile:Lehigh Valley and Newark Bay Bridges 2023b.jpg|Aerial view of the bridge approach in 2023\nFile:Newark Bay Bridge 2021.jpg|Head west, approaching the main span across the deck\nSee also\n}}\n* List of bridges, tunnels, and cuts in Hudson County, New Jersey\n* CRRNJ Newark Bay Bridge\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/newark-bay/ Newark Bay Bridge Historic Overview]"
