It also ran through several other Marvel comics series.\nThe plot is the culmination of a series of events that began with the Hulk being tricked into space by the Illuminati and a Life Model Decoy of Nick Fury. Planet Hulk shows the Hulk's subsequent exile and his imminent return to Earth to seek revenge on the Illuminati.\nPublication history\nThe story, a crossover throughout various series, began in the one-shot World War Hulk Prologue: World Breaker (May 2007), written by Peter David and penciled by Sean Phillips, Al Rio, and Lee Weeks. Marvel followed this with Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #106–111 and World War Hulk: Frontline #1–6 as parallel stories following the impact of the Hulk's return on various characters. The crossover extended into regular issues of Avengers: The Initiative, Ghost Rider, Heroes for Hire, Irredeemable Ant-Man, The Punisher War Journal, and Iron Man, as well as a miniseries starring the Hulk and the X-Men and a newly created group, the Gamma Corps. The stories ran from summer through fall, beginning in issues cover-dated July 2007. Initially scheduled to end in October, Marvel announced through the October 10 Diamond Dateline retail newsletter that the final titles in the crossover would be delayed until mid to late November.\nPlot\nAfter the Illuminati (Black Bolt, Tony Stark, Doctor Strange, and Reed Richards) banished Hulk from Earth, the spacecraft they used explodes, killing Hulk's pregnant wife Caiera. Blaming the Illuminati for her death, and more powerful than ever because of his time spent absorbing the radiation levels on Sakaar, Hulk returns to Earth for revenge with his allies, the Warbound: Hiroim, Korg, Elloe Kaifi, Miek, No-Name of the Brood, Arch-E-5912, and Mung.\nStopping at the Moon, the Hulk defeats Inhuman king Black Bolt. The Hulk proceeds to Manhattan, New York where he demands the presence of The Illuminati.\nHe travels to the home of the X-Men, where Professor X, absent from the decision to send the Hulk off-planet, admits that while he never would have agreed to permanent banishment, he would have agreed to temporary exile while they searched for a cure. The Hulk defeats several teams of X-Men and battles the Juggernaut but leaves after learning of the M-Day incident, believing that Xavier has suffered enough.\nThe Hulk returns to Manhattan and battles the superhuman-operative team Gamma Corps and Ghost Rider. Hulk defeats Iron Man, destroying Stark Tower in the process. Hulk and his Warbound next defeat the New Avengers, the Mighty Avengers, Doc Samson, and the Fantastic Four (including Black Panther and Storm). The Hulk attaches \"obedience disks\" to the defeated, imprisoned superheroes, preventing them from using their powers.\nAfter a brief battle involving Hercules, Amadeus Cho, Namora, and Angel, the Hulk defeats Thunderbolt Ross and a U.S. Army force. The Hulk then encounters Doctor Strange, who harnesses the power of his old enemy Zom. Hulk defeats the Zom-possessed Doctor Strange, causing him to flee.\nAn imprisoned Tony Stark (Iron Man) communicates with S.H.I.E.L.D., revealing an emergency plan to engulf Manhattan in the Negative Zone, thereby annihilating the Hulk and all other positive matter on the island, should the heroes fail.\nThe Hulk and the Warbound transform Madison Square Garden into a gladiatorial arena. Meanwhile, he repels an assassination attempt from Scorpion, and a confrontation with the Initiative.\nFollowing speeches from the Hulk's human supporters, the Hulk arranges for Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Black Bolt, and Mister Fantastic to fight a tentacled alien and later battle each other to the death, as a cheering audience watches. The Hulk declares his intention was for \"justice and not murder\", and nobody had to or would die. He plans to destroy New York City and leave the Avengers to their shame.\nThe Sentry arrives and attacks the Hulk. Sentry and the Hulk battle, leveling the city, until they revert into Robert Reynolds and Bruce Banner with Reynolds passing out. Angered that the Hulk disappeared, Warbound member Miek attacks Banner. Rick Jones pushes Banner aside and is injured, causing Banner to return to Hulk form. As the Hulk attacks the Warbound, Miek reveals the explosion that started this war was not caused by the Illuminati, but by Red King loyalists. Miek chose not to prevent it, hoping the incident would encourage the Hulk to keep destroying. Overwhelming rage causes the Hulk to unwillingly radiate energy that threatens Earth. Stark activates a series of weaponized satellites that open fire on the Hulk, leaving him unconscious in his Bruce Banner form.\nS.H.I.E.L.D. later imprisons Banner in a facility three miles underground, with the other Warbound members having been taken into U.S. military custody.\nNamor alone was spared from the Hulk's wrath, as Hulk discovered early on that Namor was the sole Illuminati member who voiced his opposition to banishing the Hulk from the outset and wisely predicted Hulk's eventual return and quest for vengeance.\nAftermath\nWith the conclusion of the \"World War Hulk\" storyline, the series The Incredible Hulk was replaced with The Incredible Hercules, which officially replaced the title of the previous series with issue #113, even though the story arc started one issue earlier in The Incredible Hulk #112. The series continued the story of Hercules and Amadeus Cho.\nA continuation of both \"Planet Hulk\" and \"World War Hulk\" began in May 2009. A special stand-alone prologue and Skaar: Son of Hulk #11 saw the beginning of \"Planet Skaar\", an arc intended to bring Skaar directly into the middle of the Marvel Universe. Following the return of the Silver Savage (the Silver Surfer), events begin to spiral, forcing Skaar to not only abandon Sakaar but also head toward Earth. As was revealed by series writer Greg Pak, Mister Fantastic, Reed Richards, is not amused with the arrival of another Hulk-like being, and the meeting between father and son will not be very pleasant for the Hulk.\nIn the 2010 \"World War Hulks\" storyline, it is revealed that the satellites used to revert Hulk to Banner at the end of \"World War Hulk\" siphoned off the gamma radiation from his body, to collect it for the cathexis ray later used to create the Red Hulk.\nCharacters\n* Doc Samson\n* Excalibur\n** Captain Britain (Brian Braddock)\n** Dazzler\n** Juggernaut\n* Fantastic Four\n** Black Panther\n** Human Torch\n** Invisible Woman\n** Storm\n** Thing\n* Gamma Corps\n* Heroes for Hire\n** Black Cat\n** Colleen Wing\n** Humbug\n** Misty Knight\n** Shang-Chi\n** Tarantula\n* Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)\n* Illuminati\n** Black Bolt (Skrull imposter)\n** Doctor Strange\n** Iron Man\n** Mister Fantastic\n** Professor X\n* Initiative\n** Cloud 9\n** Gauntlet\n** Hardball\n** Justice\n** Komodo\n** Rage\n** Slapstick\n** Thor Girl (Skrull Imposter)\n** Triathlon\n** Ultra-Girl\n* Shadow Initiative\n** Trauma\n** Mutant Zero\n** Bengal\n** Constrictor\n** Red Team (see Scarlet Spider)\n* The Mighty Avengers\n** Ares\n** Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers)\n** Wonder Man\n* New Avengers\n** Echo\n** Iron Fist\n** Luke Cage\n** Ronin (Clint Barton)\n** Spider-Man\n** Spider-Woman (Veranke)\n* The New X-Men\n** Dust\n** Elixir\n** Hellion\n** Mercury\n** Rockslide\n** Surge\n** X-23\n** Prodigy (David Alleyne)\n* Sentry\n* She-Hulk\n* Stepford Cuckoos\n* X-Factor Investigations\n** M\n** Multiple Man\n** Siryn\n** Strong Guy\n** Wolfsbane\n* X-Men\n** Beast\n** Colossus\n** Cyclops\n** Darwin\n** Emma Frost\n** Hepzibah\n** Lockheed\n** Nightcrawler\n** Shadowcat\n** Warpath\n** Wolverine\n* Warbound\n** Hulk\n** Arch-E-5912\n** No-Name of the Brood\n** Elloe Kaifi\n** Hiroim\n** Korg\n** Miek\n** Mung\nOther characters\n* Eric O'Grady (as Slaying Mantis)\n* Caiera\n* Daredevil\n* Ben Urich\n* Sally Floyd\n* Danny Granville\n* Punisher\n* Stuart Clarke\n* Thunderbolt Ross\n* President of the United States\n* Medusa\n* Monstro\n* Namor\n* Renegades\n** Angel\n** Hercules\n** Amadeus Cho\n** Namora\n* Rick Jones\n* S.H.I.E.L.D.\n** Gabe Jones\n** Maria Hill\n** Derek Khanata\n** Dum Dum Dugan (Skrull imposter)\n** Scorpion (Carmilla Black)\n* Wong\nSequel\nWorld War Hulk II\nA sequel arc titled World War Hulk II is shown in the issues of The Incredible Hulk. After returning from a restored Sakaar, Amadeus Cho's Hulk faces off against Phalkan. His Hulk form's persona changed to where it easily defeated Phalkan and used his \"computer brain\" to leave Phalkan with a broken arm, a broken foot, a punctured lung, and some broken ribs.\nOther versions\nWhat If?\nFor the 2009 What If series, there was a What If? World War Hulk one-shot which examines two alternatives to the storyline:\n* The first tale shows Tony Stark not hesitating to fire the laser satellite into New York City, killing the Warbound and many heroes during Hulk's fight with the Sentry. Watching from hiding, the Skrulls hear of the death of their queen Veranke (masquerading as Spider-Woman), but believe the Hulk is a prophet sent to aid them by destroying the heroes. They attack, their sleeper agents allowing them to wipe out most of the remaining super-beings and take over the world. Two months later, the Vision finds Bruce Banner in the ruins of New York, waiting to die, and convinces him to become the Hulk again and help. The Hulk aids the remaining heroes against the Skrulls, inspiring people to help. In this world, it's the Wasp who's a Skrull, and she infects Hank Pym with the bio-weapon that wipes out the remaining heroes. The Hulk survives and summons the Silver Surfer, demanding the Surfer call Galactus to destroy Earth. The Surfer does so, but leaves, disgusted at the Hulk's bloodthirsty ways. Galactus arrives and feeds upon Earth, destroying the Skrulls and the planet. He lets Hulk live, promising to take away his pain and memories. The Hulk agrees and is transformed into Galactus' new herald, the World-Breaker.\n* The second story has Thor and the Warriors Three flying back from Africa on a plane when they hear of The Hulk's attack. Thor leads the others against the Hulk's forces. He and the Hulk engage in a massive battle across Manhattan, before learning of civilians needing help in destroyed subway tunnels, and work together to save them. Thor manages to get through to the Hulk, convincing him to give up his vendetta. Back at Madison Square Garden, the Warbound have discovered Miek's role in the destruction of Sakaar and have surrendered. Sentry arrives only to find the battle over. Thor negotiates a settlement for all parties with the Hulk and his forces returning to rebuild Sakaar and leave Earth in peace.\nMarvel Zombies Return\nIn the last issue, the Earth-Z version of Hulk became infected while on the moon, the rest of the Warbound being devoured by the zombie Inhumans (with the Hulk eating Elloe Kaifi when the infection takes control of him). Instead of seeking revenge on the Avengers and Earth, he returned to Earth to satisfy his hunger, and in turn, infects the version of the Sentry that was responsible for the outbreak in the first place. This Hulk goes on to join Spider-Man's team of New Avengers when the Sentry turns against him.\nMini Marvels\nIn Chris Giarrusso's Mini Marvels comics, a World War Hulk three-story series had been written.\nPinball adaptation\nZen Studios developed a virtual pinball adaptation of the limited comic series, releasing it on the comic's fifth anniversary in 2012 as part of the four Avengers Chronicles tables as downloadable content for Marvel Pinball, Zen Pinball 2, Pinball FX 2 and Pinball FX 3. This table is set in the ruins of New York City and features voice acting and battles between the Hulk and the superheroes he sought to confront as revenge for his exile.\nCollected editions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
