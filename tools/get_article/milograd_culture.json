Geographically, it corresponds to present day southern Belarus and northern Ukraine, in the area of the confluence of the Dnieper and the Pripyat, north of Kyiv. Their ethnic origin is uncertain, but likely to be either Baltic or Early Slavic. The town of Milahrad (), after which the culture is named, is located in the Gomel Region of Belarus.\nThis culture is identified with the Neurae of Herodotus. The bearers of this archaeological culture are considered to be Balts or Proto-Slavs.  Retrieved 2025-07-14 It is genetically related to the Sosnytsia and Tszynets cultures.\nThe Milograd culture was over time strongly influenced by the culture of the Podkles-Pomeranian tribes, who came from the northwest and, together with the local Milograd-Podhirtsi tribes, later formed the Zarubynet culture in this territory. In the north, part of the territory of the Milograd culture became part of the Brushed Pottery culture of the late period.\nTerritory of residence\nThis is the culture of the tribes who lived between the middle reaches of the Berezina in the north and the Ros River in the south, the Western Bug in the west and the Iput River in the east. This is the modern territory of Southern Belarus and Ukrainian Polissya. The territory of the Milograd culture bordered the Dnieper-Dvina culture in the north, the Yukhniv culture in the east, and the Pomeranian culture in the west. In the south and southeast, it bordered the Scythians.\nIn the 1950s, O. Melnykivska, having studied the Mylograd settlement in the Rechytsky district of the Gomel region (Belarus), singled out the Mylograd culture among the monuments of the Early Iron Age. At the same time, archaeologist V. Danylenko discovered monuments of this culture in the village of Pidhirtsi, Obukhiv district of the Kyiv region.\nSee also\n* Middle Dnieper culture\n* Pomeranian culture\n* Zarubintsy culture\n* Przeworsk culture (Middle and Upper Vistula with the right bank of the Oder)\n* Chernoles culture (Pripyat basin, Middle Dnieper and part of Upper Dnieper)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.livius.org/articles/people/scythians-sacae/ Scythians/Sacae] by Jona Lendering"
