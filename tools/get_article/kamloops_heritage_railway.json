The railway used to operate throughout the year running trains within Kamloops. The train was pulled by restored steam locomotive Canadian National Railway #2141, the \"Spirit of Kamloops\". The museum is currently on temporary static display.\n2141 was built in 1912 by the Canadian Locomotive Company, in Kingston, Ontario - built for the Canadian Northern Railway, prior to it being absorbed into the Canadian National Railway. The locomotive is a 2-8-0, 'Consolidation' class of steam locomotive built for branchline use as well as drag freights . Originally a coal burner, the locomotive was converted to burn oil in 1954, and retired from active duty in 1958. #2141 was sold to the City of Kamloops in 1961, and placed on display in Riverside Park until restoration work began in 1995. The restoration was completed in 2001, and #2141 pulled trains for the KHR from May until December each year. A second restoration took place from 2013 to 2015, with the engine running again in August 2015. The locomotive was also featured in the movie Gold (2013).\nTickets for excursions were sold at the ticket office, located at #3-510 Lorne Street, right across from the old Kamloops railway station.\nIn 2020, the Kamloops Heritage Railway was reduced to temporary static display. This was due to the increased amount of freight traffic, mainly the export of American coal through Kamloops via Canadian Pacific Railway to the Canadian National Kamloops North yard via the rail bridge over the North Thompson River.\nA new board of directors have made plans to have 2141 back in operational service by 2026, with Canadian National offering to let KHR operate on 71 miles of the Okanagan Subdivision, between Campbell Creek and Vernon. A boiler inspector surveyed the locomotive and stated that little work has to be done in order for operational use.\nSee also\n*List of heritage railways in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGUllashOzg footage of 2141 operating on Vancouver Island in 1958]"
