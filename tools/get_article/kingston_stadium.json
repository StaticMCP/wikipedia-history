Kingston Stadium is located southwest of downtown Cedar Rapids, adjacent to Veterans Memorial Stadium and ImOn Ice Arena. Opened September 12, 1952, it was named for a settlement called Kingston established in 1839 on the west side of the Cedar River which was later annexed into Cedar Rapids.\nIn 2019, Kingston Stadium underwent three-months of renovations at a cost of $2 million. Upgrades included new turf, improved ADA compliant bleachers, and an eighth track lane allowing for state qualifying meets. The north bleachers were demolished and replaced with a grassy hillside.\nUses\nKingston Stadium is the home stadium for Jefferson, Kennedy, and Washington high school football games. It previously hosted Regis and LaSalle high schools when they were in existence, and Coe College games before K. Raymond Clark Field was built.\nKingston Stadium hosted a Canadian Football League exhibition game in 1961, and one NFL exhibition game each in 1961, 1962, and 1963.\nIn the 1970s Kingston Stadium was home to three semipro football teams: the Rapid Raiders (Midwest Football League) in 1972 and 1973; the Buccaneers (Central States League) in 1974; and the Falcons (Chicagoland League; Northern States League) in 1976 and 1977. The 1972 Rapid Raiders won the Midwest Football League championship. In 1978, the Metro Falcons (Northern States League) were refused permission to play at Kingston Stadium.\nThe Cedar Rapids Rampage United amateur soccer team in the Premier League of America played at Kingston Stadium in 2017.\nThe stadium has also been used for public school graduation ceremonies, cheerleading, marching band festivals, track meets and soccer matches.\nReferences"
