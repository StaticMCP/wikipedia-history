Once the regular season was complete, the NAIA sponsored a 16-team playoff to determine the year's national champion. A final poll was then taken after completion of the 2010 NAIA Football National Championship.\nPoll release dates\nThe poll release dates were:\n* April 19, 2010 (Spring)\n* August 9, 2010 (Preseason)\n* September 13, 2010\n* September 20, 2010\n* September 27, 2010\n* October 4, 2010\n* October 11, 2010\n* October 18, 2010\n* October 25, 2010\n* November 1, 2010\n* November 8, 2010\n*

various weekly polls has been held by only a select group of teams. Through the postseason poll of the 2010 season, the teams and the number of times they have held the #1 weekly ranking are shown below. The number of times a team has been ranked #1 in the postseason poll (the national champion) is shown in parentheses.\nIn 1999, the results of a postseason poll, if one was conducted, are not known. Therefore, an additional poll has been presumed, and the #1 postseason ranking has been credited to the postseason tournament champion, the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Team\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Total #1 Rankings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||55 (3)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Carroll (MT)||54 (6)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||23 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||12 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Saint Francis (IN)||3\n|}\nReferences"
