The Almohad fleet inflicted a severe defeat on the Portuguese.\nBackground\nFaced with the relentless attacks from the Almohad fleet led by Gamin ben Mardanis against Portugal, the inhabitants of Lisbon decide to assemble a powerful fleet, commanded by Admiral Fuas Roupinho. The Portuguese ships quickly ravaged the shores of Algarve, which were then under Almohad's control.\nIndeed, in 1180, the Almohad fleet from Seville, consisting of more than 10 galleys under the command of Gamin ben Mardanis, launched an attack on Lisbon. The Portuguese hastily armed all available vessels in the port and engaged the Almohad squadron, marking their first naval battle in history. The Battle of Cape Espichel turns in favor of the Portuguese. They captured several vessels and took the commander, Gamin ben Mardanis, as a prisoner.\nEncouraged by this triumph, Portuguese admiral Fuas Roupinho ventures to lead a successful raid on Ceuta, taking many Muslim ships in the harbor.\nBattle\nIn June 1182, the Portuguese fleet, emboldened by its previous successes, sails in the ocean off the Almohad territories. The Almohad fleets from Ceuta and Seville, totaling 40 galleys and commanded by Abd Allâh ben Ishâq ben Jâmi and Ahmed es-Sekili, respectively, converge in Cadiz. From there, they set course towards Silves, intercepting the Lisbon Portuguese fleet stationed there. The naval battle tilts in favor of the Almohads, inflicting a severe defeat on the Portuguese, resulting in the loss of over 20 to 30 ships and 1,800 prisoners.\nReferences"
