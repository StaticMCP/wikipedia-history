Black Grape were originally meant to record \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\", but the band withdrew due to a conflict between members; Space recorded the song instead. In addition, the final song recorded, Damon Albarn and Michael Nyman's version of \"London Pride\", was nearly rejected due to being, reportedly, almost unrecognisable in its original version. Tennant ordered the song to be kept, though Albarn had already agreed to make changes by that time.\nSuede were asked to release their version of \"Poor Little Rich Girl\" as a single but declined in order to focus on preparing their next album, Head Music.\nTrack listing\nReferences"
