Specifically, Roderick MacAulay claimed that a number of people had voted in the Georgetown / Georgetown Royalty electoral district who were not entitled to vote.  As a result, the colonial government held a review of the eligibility of some of the voters.  This review took place at the Georgetown courthouse starting on March 25, 1859.  As a result of this review, Roderick MacAulay was declared elected by the House of Assembly in place of Andrew A. MacDonald on April 27, 1859. Roderick MacAulay took his seat in the House of Assembly the following day.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?doc=9_00960_56 Journal of the House of Assembly of Prince Edward Island (1859)]"
