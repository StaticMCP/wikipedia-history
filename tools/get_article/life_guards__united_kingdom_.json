They formed part of the contingent raised by the exiled King Charles II as his contribution to the army of King Philip IV of Spain who were fighting the French and their allies the English Commonwealth under the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell in the Franco-Spanish War and the concurrent Anglo-Spanish War.\n* The second troop was founded in 1659 as Monck's Life Guards.\n* The third troop, like the first troop was formed in 1658 from exiled Royalists and was initially known as The Duke of York's Troop of Horse Guards.\n* The fourth troop was raised in 1661 in England.\n* The first troop of horse grenadier guards was formed in 1693 from the amalgamation of three troops of grenadiers.\n* The second troop of horse grenadier guards was raised in Scotland in 1702.\nThese units first saw action during the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672 and then at the Battle of Sedgemoor during the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685.\nThe 3rd and 4th troops were disbanded in 1746. In 1788, the remaining 1st and 2nd troops, along with the two troops of Horse Grenadier Guards, were reorganised into two regiments, the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Life Guards (from 1877, simply 1st Life Guards and 2nd Life Guards). From then on (1788), rank and file were mostly formed of commoners giving rise to their pejorative nickname: \"the cheesemongers\", while the bulk of the gentlemen-troopers were pensioned off.\nFrom 1812 to 1814, two squadrons from each of the Life Guard regiments served in the Peninsular War. In 1815 they were part of The Household Brigade at the Battle of Waterloo under Major-General Lord Edward Somerset. This would be their last active service for more than 60 years, during which time they performed ceremonial and public order duties in London.\nIn 1821, the Life Guards under the command of Captain Oakes fired upon mourners trying to redirect the funeral procession of Queen Caroline through the city of London. Two civilians were killed. Though charges of manslaughter and murder were brought, no Life Guards were prosecuted.\nElements of the Life Guards, along with the Royal Horse Guards, formed the Household Cavalry Composite Regiment (HCCR) for active service. The HCCR was in action in the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882 and the Second Boer War of 1899 to 1902. The HCCR was mobilized again in 1914 at the start of the First World War, where they formed part of the British Expeditionary Force and fought in most of the major battles on the Western Front.\nIn 1918, the two Life Guards regiments gave up their horses and were re-roled as machine gun battalions, becoming the 1st and 2nd Battalions, Guards Machine Gun Regiment. They reverted to their previous names and roles after the end of the war. In 1922, the two regiments were merged into one regiment, The Life Guards (1st and 2nd)''. In 1928, it was re-designated The Life Guards.\nDuring the Second World War, again forming part of the HCCR, the Life Guards undertook armoured reconnaissance duties in Palestine, Iraq, Iran, Egypt and Italy. In 1944, the Life Guards took part in the Normandy landings and the advance through France to liberate Brussels. In the late 1940s, they were deployed to the Middle East, initially in Egypt, garrisoned at Kasr-el-Nil Barracks in Cairo from 1946 to 1947, and then in Palestine from 1947. In 1948, the unit left the Middle East and returned to England on leave. In 1952, it returned to Germany as part of the 11th Armoured Division.\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the unit repeatedly rotated from Britain to Germany. In 1965, the unit was deployed to Asia for the first time in central Malaysia until 1968, returning to England. Like in the past decades, the unit was stationed in West Germany and England through the early to late 1970s. During its deployments, the unit always maintained a squadron in London conducting public duties. In 1971, several squadrons were deployed to Northern Ireland during The Troubles, and the regiment would see action there several more times through the mid-1970s. In March 1979, B Squadron was deployed to Cyprus as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, and this would become another location that components of the unit would be deployed to.\nIn 1980, the unit's headquarters would be moved from Combermere Barracks in Windsor to Lothian Barracks in Detmold, North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany as a part of the 4th Armoured Division of the British Army of the Rhine, in a heavy armoured role equipped with Chieftain MBT, and also tasked with the defense of part of the North German Plain. In January 1981 it became a component of the 20th Armoured Brigade. The unit provided a mounted escort for then Charles, Prince of Wales and then Lady Diana Spencer during their wedding ceremony on 29 July 1981, in London. Throughout the rest of the 1980s-1990s, its headquarters moved frequently from Germany to Britain, and in January 1984 had squadrons deployed to Cyprus as part of a UN tour. In 1990–1991, the Life Guards saw action with their Challenger 1 tanks in the Gulf War.\narmoured vehicle of the Household Cavalry in Helmand Province, 2011]]\nIn 1992, as part of the Options for Change defence review, The Life Guards were joined with the Blues and Royals in a 'Union', becoming part of the new Household Cavalry, classified as a corps, not an amalgamation, forming the Household Cavalry Regiment (armoured reconnaissance) and the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment (ceremonial duties). However, both units maintain their regimental identity, with distinct uniforms and traditions, and their own colonel. Like The Blues and Royals, they have a peculiar non-commissioned rank structure: In brief, they lack sergeants, replacing them with multiple grades of corporal. Since the union, the Household Cavalry Regiment has seen active service in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn 2018, the Life Guards began admitting women. In 2020, Elizabeth Godwin became the first woman to be commissioned as an officer in the Life Guards.\nPrevious names\nNames used by the regiment were as follows:\n* From 1788, 1st Regiment of Life Guards and 2nd Regiment of Life Guards\n** The following troops were reorganised into 1st Regiment of Life Guards\n*** 1st Troop of Horse Guards\n*** 1st Troop, Horse Grenadier Guards\n** and the following troops were reorganised into 2nd Regiment of Life Guards\n*** 2nd Troop of Horse Guards\n*** 2nd Troop (Scots), Horse Grenadier Guards\n* From 1877, 1st Life Guards and 2nd Life Guards\n* From 1922, The Life Guards (1st and 2nd)\n* From 1928, The Life Guards\nUniform\ntunic worn by an officer]]\nOn ceremonial occasions, The Life Guards wear a scarlet tunic, a metal cuirass and a matching helmet with a white plume worn bound on the top into an 'onion' shape; the exceptions to this are the regiment's trumpeters, who wear a red plume, and farriers, who wear blue tunics and have a black plume. In addition, The Life Guards wear their chin strap below their lower lip, as opposed to The Blues and Royals, who wear it under their chin. On service dress, The Life Guards Officers and Warrant Officers Class One wear a red lanyard on the right shoulder, as well as a Sam Browne belt. The Life Guards, as part of the Household Division, does not use the Order of the Bath Star for its officer rank \"pips\", but rather the Order of the Garter Star.\nBattle honours\nThe battle honours are:\n[combined battle honours of 1st Life Guards and 2nd Life Guards, with the following emblazoned]:\n*Dettingen, Peninsula, Waterloo, Tel-el-Kebir, Egypt 1882, Relief of Kimberley, Paardeberg, South Africa 1899–1900\n*The Great War: Mons, Le Cateau, Marne 1914, Aisne 1914, Messines 1914, Ypres 1914, Passchendaele 1917 '18, Somme 1916 '18, Arras 1917 '18, Hindenburg Line, France and Flanders 1914–18\n*The Second World War: Mont Pincon, Souleuvre, Noireau Crossing, Amiens 1944, Brussels, Neerpelt, Nederrijn, Nijmegen, Lingen, Bentheim, North-West Europe 1944-45, Baghdad 1941, Iraq 1941, Palmyra, Syria 1941, El Alamein, North Africa 1942–43, Arezzo, Advance to Florence, Gothic Line, Italy 1944\n*Wadi al Batin, Gulf 1991, Al Basrah, Iraq 2003.\nCommanding officers\nThe Commanding Officers of the regiment have been:\n*Lt Col Emerson M.
