Despite progress over the past few years, medical care remains both costly and inaccessible for many families across the Central African Republic. Vaccination rates for preventable diseases stand at less than 52%, and one child in eight does not live past five years of age.]]\nHealth in the Central African Republic has been degraded by years of internal conflict and economic turmoil since independence from France in 1960.  One sixth of the country's population is in need of acute medical care. Endemic diseases put a high demand on the health infrastructure, which requires outside assistance to sustain itself.\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative has found that the Central African Republic is fulfilling 65.7% of its national obligations regarding the right to health based on its income levels. When looking at the right to health with respect to children, the Central African Republic achieves 92.1% of what is expected based on its current income. In regards to the right to health amongst the adult population, the country achieves only 75.2% of what is similarly expected.  The Central African Republic falls into the \"very bad\" category when evaluating the right to reproductive health; the nation is fulfilling only 29.8% of what is expected based on the resources (income) it has available.\nHealth infrastructure\nthat have been stripped and looted by local militias.]]\nThe largest hospitals in the country are located in Bangui district.

In 2024, UNICEF delivered over 43,200 doses of the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine by air funded by Gavi, with further shipment of 163,800 doses to follow. The Central African Republic is the first country to receive the R21 malaria vaccine for use in routine childhood immunization. In addition, Gavi committed US$3 million to support the Ministry of Health’s request in using data for strengthening routine immunisation, by investing in the District Health Information System (DHIS2) platform.\nAccording to 2009 estimates, the HIV/AIDS prevalence is about 4.7% of the adult population (ages 15–49). This is in general agreement with the 2016 United Nations estimate of approximately 4%.\nGovernment expenditure on health was US$20 (PPP) per person in 2006, and 10.9% of total government expenditure in 2006.

In the Central African Republic, the number of midwives per 1,000 live births was 3, and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 27.\nHIV/AIDS\nThere were 13,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS in 2007 in the CAR. and 11,000 in 2009. About 160,000 people had HIV/AIDS in 2007, with the number dropping to 140,000 in 2009, for a prevalence rate of about 3.2%. By 2016, the rate had dropped to about 2.8%, although the prevalence in gay males was over 25%.\nCoronavirus\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/resources/docs/country_info/profile/en_CAR_SoWMy_Profile.pdf The State of the World's Midwifery]"
