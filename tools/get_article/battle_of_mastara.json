After two failed Ottoman attacks from 24–25 May 1918, they decided to assault the Church of Saint John directly, due to its importance for the Armenian troops both culturally and for the sake of the battle's command, the Ottoman attack began on the night of 26 May 26 1918, with Ottoman troops seeing initial successes, breaking through the Armenian defensive line for the first time and rapidly advancing towards the church. The Armenians did not easily give up, as they fought bravely, using grenades and hit and run tactics against the Ottomans in the fairly fortified city, suffering hundreds of casualties in the process but being successful in the defense, as Ottoman troops were forced to retreat outside of the city, back to their original positions. Following this failed attack by the Ottomans, their morale continued to deplete, with Ottoman troops regularly deserting during the battle which forced the Ottomans to retreat after more breakthrough attempts between 27 and 28 May had horribly failed.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
