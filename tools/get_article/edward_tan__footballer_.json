He was released by the club in 2012 and completed his transfer as a free agent for Woodlands Wellington FC in March, impressing the media and fans alike on his debut against Gombak United just days later.\nDuring the 2012 mid-season break, Edward decided to leave the club to pursue a normal career outside of football.\nHe played a total of 7 games for the Rams, coming on as a substitute in 2 of those matches.\nReferences"
