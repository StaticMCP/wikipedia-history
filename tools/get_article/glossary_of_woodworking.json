An example is a \"blind\"  joint.}}\nor .}}\nholes, having a knobbed handle on the top to which pressure is applied and a U-shaped grip in the middle which is used to rotate the drill bit.}}\nhas grown in a deformed and convoluted manner.}}\n.}}\nC\nblade.}}\n.}}\ndirection changes, as in flame figured maple.}}\n, stone, or metal by hand, with a mallet, or with mechanical power. Chiselling involves forcing the blade or cutting edge into the material in order to cut it.}}\n.}}\nor , cutting against the normal feed direction at the end of the cut to prevent .}}\nwith very fine fibers of cells that are not visibly porous.}}\nor . See .}}\n.}}\n.}}\nD\ntechnique most commonly used in woodworking joinery. Noted for its resistance to being pulled apart (tensile strength), the dovetail joint is commonly used to join the sides of a drawer to the front.}}\n.}}\n.}}\nused in combination with a mallet.}}\nE\nF\n.}}\ndirection.}}\nfor general work or ; may have square sides or  on both sides.}}\nor  with a splayed end.}}\nwith minimal curvature used for  and smoothing.}}\nused to cut, flatten, and smooth (or \"float\") wood surfaces by abrasion, e.g. when making a wooden plane. Unlike  and files, floats have parallel teeth and can be resharpened as many times as the thickness of the blade will allow.}}\nof a .}}\nwith a very fine-toothed blade used for delicate cuts in thin material.}}\nG\nH\n.}}\n.}}\n(i.e. crack or split) radiating out from the .}}\n, , or  bevel which meets the back of the blade and polishes the cut.}}\non a , , or .}}\nI\n, or a gouge sharpened on the concave surface.}}\nwhich has multiple longitudinal directions in alternating layers, typical of many tropical , and very difficult to work and to produce smooth surfaces.}}\nJ\nthat can form circular cuts by moving the workpiece past a blade which moves rapidly up and down.}}\n}}\nused to straighten boards and square edges.}}\n; a jointer plane.}}\nK\nL\n.}}\nfrom old lath and plaster walls.}}\nM\nor a hinge.}}\nmade by fastening together pieces with the ends cut at an angle.}}\nby having slots to guide a saw at the desired angle for the joint.}}\nN\nor other surface.}}\nP\n.}}\n.}}\nthat is flat, elongated, and rectangular with parallel  that are higher and longer than they are wide.}}\nQ\nwith tree growth rings perpendicular to the wider .
