The existence of a distinct, large-scale battle at Najaf in 1638 is not corroborated by major contemporary Ottoman, Persian, or European sources and therefore remains disputed.\nBackground\nIn 1638 Sultan Murad IV led a major campaign that resulted in the recapture of Baghdad from Safavid control. Najaf — a city of great religious importance for Shia Islam located south of Baghdad — lay within the theatre of these operations. Some local or later accounts suggest skirmishing in the region, but no widely accepted primary account describes a separate, decisive Battle of Najaf in 1638.\nCourse of events\nDetails of troop dispositions, tactics, and the course of any alleged engagement near Najaf are not documented in reliable contemporary sources. If fighting occurred, it may have been a localized action connected to the Ottoman advance on Baghdad rather than an independent major battle.\nAftermath\nThe primary corroborated outcome of the 1638 campaign was the Ottoman recapture of Baghdad. This victory contributed to the diplomatic settlement formalized by the Treaty of Zuhab (also spelled Qasr-e Shirin) in 1639, which recognized Ottoman control over most of Iraq and established long-term borders between the two empires.\nHistorical assessment\nModern historians typically do not list a Battle of Najaf (1638) among the documented major engagements of the Ottoman–Safavid wars. References to such a battle should be treated with caution until archival or other reliable evidence is located.\nSee also\n* Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639)\n* Siege of Baghdad (1638)\n* Treaty of Zuhab\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Matthee, Rudi.
