Business was successful and in 1865 they built new premises next door which they later extended back to Elizabeth Street. In 1876 his brother in law, Henry James Harcourt (1820–1909), also an Iron Monger, helped the business and \"between the death of the late Mr. W Perry and the advent of his sons into the firm acted in a very responsible way in the business\". His sister-in-law was married to Thomas Peate, of Smith, Peate & Co. Sydney.\nPolitics\nWilliam Perry was appointed as a life member of the Queensland Legislative Council on 22 September 1890.

William Perry built the house Miegunyah at Bowen Hills (also then known as Newstead) as a house for his sons; Miegunyah was lower on the hill from his own home Folkestone.\nIn April 1891, William Perry purchased Harlaxton House in Toowoomba as a summer residence after the death of its previous owner Francis Thomas Gregory.\nLater life\nOn 11 June 1891, Perry died suddenly at his home Folkestone at Bowen Hills aged 55 years. He was buried in Toowong Cemetery the following day (12 June 1891).\nLegacy\nPerry Park is named after William Perry. Perry had used the land as his family cattle and horse paddock.\nThe house Miegunyah that Perry built was added to the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992.\nHarlaxton House which Perry owned was added to the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* —a description of the business that William Perry founded"
