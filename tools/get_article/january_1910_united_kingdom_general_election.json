Called amid a constitutional crisis after the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected the People's Budget, the Liberal government, seeking a mandate, lost their majority.\nThe result was a hung parliament: Arthur Balfour’s Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies won the most votes, but Asquith’s Liberals secured the most seats, edging out the Conservatives by two. With Irish Parliamentary Party support, Asquith remained in power. Another election followed in December.\nThe Labour Party, led by Arthur Henderson, returned 40 MPs. Much of this apparent increase (from the 29 Labour MPs elected in 1906) came from the defection, a few years earlier, of Lib Lab MPs from the Liberal Party to Labour.\nResults\n|}\n}}\nVoting summary\n|46.82}}\n|43.51}}\n|6.99}}\n|1.19}}\n|0.38}}\n}}\nSeats summary\n|40.90}}\n|40.60}}\n|10.60}}\n|5.97}}\n|1.19}}\n}}\nSee also\n*List of MPs elected in the January 1910 United Kingdom general election\n*Parliamentary franchise in the United Kingdom 1885–1918\n*January 1910 United Kingdom general election in Ireland\n*January 1910 United Kingdom general election in Scotland\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.spartacus-educational.com/politics.htm Spartacus: Political Parties and Election Results]\n*[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/geresults.html United Kingdom election results—summary results 1885–1979]\nManifestos\n*[http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1910/jan/january-1910-conservative-manifesto.shtml January 1910 Conservative manifesto]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811005157/http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1910/jan/1910-jan-labour-manifesto.shtml January 1910 Labour manifesto]\n*[http://www.libdemmanifesto.com/1910/jan/january-1910-liberal-manifesto.shtml January 1910 Liberal manifesto]"
