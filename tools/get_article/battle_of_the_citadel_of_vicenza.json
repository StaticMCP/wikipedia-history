During the summer, the League of Cambrai's armies, the Holy Roman Empire, Kingdom of France, Marquisate of Mantua, Papal States, and Duchy of Ferrara's ones invaded Veneto.\nHowever, Serenissima  resisted and in October, after the defeat in the Siege of Padua, the French Army's Marshal Jacques de la Palice left Veneto, moving to Milan. The Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I left the battle field, too, moving to Trento.\nDue to the Emperor's leaving, the Venetians, during November, took back a large part of Veneto and, on November 26, the inhabitants of Vicenza opened the doors to Andrea Gritti and Venetian Army. However, the imperial garrison located in Vicenza didn't leave the city and, commanded by the Prince of Anhalt Rudolph IV, took place in the fortified citadel. This started a three-day clash between the Venetian Army and the  Army of the Holy Roman Empire, won by the first Venetian Army, which took the control over the citadel.\nSources"
