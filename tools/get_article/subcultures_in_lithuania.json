One of the most notable was hippies.\nAs the hippie movement faded in the 1980s, punk subculture took over its role of youth's cultural resistance. In those days people participating in punk subculture could still get beaten up by Soviet police (Militsiya), taken for interrogation by KGB, expelled from schools, and sometimes even put into mental health institutions.\nHippies\nEvents\nHippyland annual festival taking place in Šiauliai during official city festival Šiaulių dienos (Šiauliai days) since 2003. It combines music festival and political activities (demonstrations against racism, xenophobia, violence, Lithuania's involvement in Iraq war etc.) although latter aspect of Hippyland is not predominant.[http://www.su.lt/article/articleview/1699/1/670/]\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gitara.lt/pries-plauka/11.html History of hippie movement in Lithuania]\nPunks\nBands\nEvents\nDurnių laivas (Ship of fools) was the festival of punk rock bands.

It was called Mūsų ašigalyje (In Our Pole) [http://www.hell-music.lt/straipsniai/subkultura/98/]. During The Soviet era zine publishing was extremely difficult because private ownership of Xerox machines was prohibited and state-owned Xerox machines were under close watch by KGB [http://www.hell-music.lt/straipsniai/subkultura/98/]. During Perestroyka and Glasnost reforms ban of private ownership of Xerox machines was lifted and zine publishing flourished. When Lithuania regained its independence dozens of zines (most of them short lived) were published all across the country. But with coming of the Internet, zine publishing stopped almost completely. Some zines however continued to exist on the Internet.\nK.N.K. (Koks nors kelias - Any Road) punk/alternative zine from Kaunas.
