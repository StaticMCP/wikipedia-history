NEAT was conducted from December 1995 until April 2007, at GEODSS on Hawaii (Haleakala-NEAT; 566), as well as at Palomar Observatory in California (Palomar-NEAT; 644). With the discovery of more than 40,000 minor planets, NEAT has been one of the most successful programs in this field, comparable to the Catalina Sky Survey, LONEOS and Mount Lemmon Survey.\nNEAT was the successor to the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS).\nHistory\ndetected by various projects:\n{| style=\"width: 100%; margin-bottom: 8px;\"\n|-\n| valign=top width=45% |\n| valign=top |\n|}\n]]\nThe original principal investigator was Eleanor F. Helin, with co-investigators Steven H. Pravdo and David L. Rabinowitz.\nNEAT had a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Air Force to use a GEODSS telescope located on Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii. GEODSS stands for Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance and these wide-field Air Force telescopes were designed to optically observe Earth orbital spacecraft. The NEAT team designed a CCD camera and computer system for the GEODSS telescope. The CCD camera format was 4,096&nbsp;×&nbsp;4,096 pixels and the field of view was 1.2°&nbsp;×&nbsp;1.6°.\nBeginning in April 2001, the Samuel Oschin telescope ( Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory) was also put into service to discover and track near-Earth objects. This telescope was equipped with a camera containing 112 CCDs each 2,400&nbsp;×&nbsp;600. This was the telescope that produced the images leading to the discovery of 50000 Quaoar in 2002, and 90377 Sedna in 2003 (published 2004) and the dwarf planet Eris.\nIn addition to discovering thousands of asteroids, NEAT was also credited with the co-discovery (recovery) of periodic comet 54P/de Vico–Swift–NEAT and of the high proper-motion Teegarden's Star. The C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) comet was discovered on August 24, 2001 by NEAT.\nAn asteroid was named in its honour, 64070 NEAT, in early 2005.\nDiscoveries\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"font-size: 0.9em; width: 270px;\"\n|+ Minor planets discovered: 40,975\n|-\n| see\n|}\n1996 PW was discovered on 9 August 1996 by a NEAT automated search camera on Haleakalā, Hawaii. It was the first object that was not an active comet discovered on an orbit typical of a long-period comets. This raised the possibility it was an extinct comet or an unusual asteroid.\nSee also\n* Minor Planet Center (MPC)\n* Planetary Data System (PDS)\n* Spaceguard\n* List of near-Earth object observation projects\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20151024002715/http://neat.jpl.nasa.gov/ Near Earth Asteroid Tracking]"
