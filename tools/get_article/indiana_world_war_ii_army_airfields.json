      "text": "# Indiana World War II Army Airfields\n\nDuring World War II, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) established numerous airfields in Indiana for training pilots and aircrews of USAAF fighters and bombers.\nMost of these airfields were under the command of the First Air Force or the Army Air Forces Training Command (AAFTC), a predecessor of the current Air Education and Training Command of the United States Air Force. However the other USAAF support commands—Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command—also commanded a significant number of airfields in support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture, and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nTroop Carrier Command\n* Baer Army Air Base, Fort Wayne\n: I Troop Carrier Group\n: 45th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now:  Fort Wayne Air National Guard Station\n* Stout Army Air Field, Indianapolis\n: Headquarters, Troop Carrier Command, Glider Ferrying & Pickup facility\n: I Troop Carrier Group\n: 362d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Used by Indiana Air National Guard until 1961.
