It sets out the boundaries between Alfred and Guthrum's territories as well as agreements on peaceful trade, and the weregild value of its people.\nBackground\nIn 865, the Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia with the intention of conquering  all of the English kingdoms. During its campaign, the Viking army conquered the kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia, and Northumbria. It initially  overran the Kingdom of Wessex, but Danish King Guthrum was defeated by Alfred's army at the Battle of Edington in 878. Under the terms of his surrender, shortly afterward, Guthrum was obliged to be baptised}} to endorse the agreement, as well as to allow him to rule more legitimately over his Christian vassals but remaining pagan to his pagan vassals. He was then with his army to leave Wessex. That agreement is known as the Treaty of Wedmore.\nSometimethe army from East-Anglia broke their peace with Alfred\", which might indicate that the treaty had been signed earlier.}} after Wedmore, a treaty was agreed that set out the lasting peace terms between the two kings, which is known as the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum. The treaty is one of the few existing documents}} of Alfred's reign and survives in Old English in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Manuscript 383, and in a Latin compilation, known as Quadripartitus.\nThe year that the treaty was created is not known for sure, but is believed to have been between  878 and Guthrum's death in 890.\nThe prologue to the treaty was a legitimisation of the territory that was held by both parties: Guthrum's landholdings in East Anglia and Alfred's in Mercia. Clauses 2 and 3 specify the blood money (or weregild), that is the value of men based on their status. The other clauses are concerned with the purchase of men, horses and oxen. There is also provision for hostages as a guarantee of good faith for one side trading with the other.\nTerms\nThere is more than one version of the treaty recorded. The original documents were written in Old English. The following version was translated by Frederick Attenborough:\n}} the Lea, and along the Lea to its source, then in a straight line to Bedford, and then up the Ouse to Watling Street.\n# Secondly, if a man is slain, whether he is an Englishman or a Dane, all of us shall place the same value on his life — namely 8 half-marks troy ounces or 225&nbsp;grams.}} of pure gold, with the exception of commoners who occupy tributary land,}} and freedmen of the Danes. These also shall be valued at the same amount — [namely] 200 shillings — in either case.\n# If anyone accuses a king's thegn of homicide, if he dares to clear himself, he shall do so with [the oaths of] twelve king's thegns. If anyone accuses a man who belongs to a lower order than that of king's thegn, he shall clear him-self with [the oaths of] eleven of his equals and one king's thegn. And this law shall apply to every suit which involves an amount greater than 4 mancusses. And if he [the accused] dare not [attempt to clear himself], he shall pay [as compensation] three times the amount at which the stolen property is valued.\n# Every man shall have knowledge of his warrantor when he buys slaves, or horses, or oxen.\n# And we all declared, on the day when the oaths were sworn, that neither slaves nor freemen should be allowed to pass over to the Danish host without permission, any more than that any of them [should come over] to us. If, however, it happens that any of them, in order to satisfy their wants, wish to trade with us, or we [for the same reason wish to trade] with them, in cattle and in goods, it shall be allowed on condition that hostages are given as security for peaceful behaviour, and as evidence by which it may be known that no treachery is intended.|source= }}\nSee also\n*Treaty of Wedmore\n*List of treaties\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
