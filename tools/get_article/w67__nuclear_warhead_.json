It was housed in the Mark 17 reentry vehicle and one of the warhead's design goals was the highest maximum output temperature possible. Only one partial yield test of the warhead was performed before the warhead was cancelled in January 1968. Hansen identifies this test as Crosstie Zara.\nThe Mark 17 RV had a difficult development. The planned total RV and warhead weight was , but by November 1966 it weighed  due to the higher than anticipated levels of hostile weapons effects protection needed. The actual warhead weight was .\nAfter its cancellation, the W68 warhead was developed for Poseidon and the W62 warhead for Minuteman III.\nThe W67 was briefly revived in 1970 for the CAFE (C-3 Alternative Front End) program for Poseidon. CAFE was a contingency program for in the event that MIRV warheads were banned and Poseidon needed to be fitted with a single warhead. Two W67 designs were examined and would use the Mark 1 Prime reentry body. Total warhead weight was .\nSee also\n* List of nuclear weapons\n* LGM-30 Minuteman\n* UGM-73 Poseidon\nReferences\nExternal links"
