It usually occurs in urban areas in a capital city. By contrast, the plain term \"revolution\" suggests that pressure from below is a major driving force in events, even if other social groups cooperate with—or ultimately capture—the movement. The phrase \"revolution from above\" was coined by the Spanish writer Joaquín Costa (1846-1911) in the 19th century. In contrast, a \"revolution from below\" refers to a grassroots campaign against élites. Johann Gottlieb Fichte advocated the right of revolution, particularly from above rather than below.\nExamples\nEast Asia\n* Meiji Restoration\n* Wuxu Reform\nMiddle East\n* Tanzimat\n* Kemalism in Turkey\n* White Revolution in Iran\nEurope\n*Enlightened absolutism in 18th-century Europe\n*The Constitution of the German Confederation (1871) and the formation of the German Empire\n*Stalin's Collectivization of agriculture\n*De-Stalinization under Nikita Khrushchev\n*Great Purge in the Soviet Union under Stalin\n*German reunification\nSee also\n*Revolution from Above: Military Bureaucrats and Development in Japan, Turkey, Egypt, and Peru, a 1978 book written by Ellen Kay Trimberger\n*Passive revolution – a similar concept associated with Antonio Gramsci\nReferences"
