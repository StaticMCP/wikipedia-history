The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 51st Academy Awards, nineteen films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Cuba and Lebanon submitted films for consideration for the first time. The five nominated films came from France, West Germany, Hungary, Italy and the Soviet Union.\nFrance won for the eleventh time with Get Out Your Handkerchiefs by Bertrand Blier.\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
