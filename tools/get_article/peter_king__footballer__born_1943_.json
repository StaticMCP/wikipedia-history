After spending thirteen seasons at Cardiff he was forced to quit the game at the age of thirty-one after suffering an Achilles tendon injury.\nHonours\n;Cardiff City\n* Welsh Cup Winner: 7\n:: 1963–64, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1969–70, 1970–71\n* Welsh Cup Finalist: 1\n:: 1971–72\nReferences"
