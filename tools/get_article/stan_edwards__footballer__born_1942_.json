However, he never made his first-team debut at Goodison Park and instead signed with Norman Low's Port Vale in May 1961. He played 22 Third Division games in the 1961–62 season, and scored his first goal in the Football League on 17 March, in a 4–0 win over Lincoln City at Vale Park; he also claimed goals against Coventry City and Brentford. In the 1962–63 campaign he scored six goals in 27 league games and two goals in four FA Cup appearances. Despite this reasonable goal return he was transferred to Bangor City in July 1963.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Everton\n|1959–60\n|First Division\n|0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Port Vale\n|1960–61\n|Third Division\n|22||3||0||0||22||3\n|-\n|1961–62\n|Third Division\n|27||6||4||2||31||8\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!49!!9!!4!!2!!53!!11\n|}\nReferences"
