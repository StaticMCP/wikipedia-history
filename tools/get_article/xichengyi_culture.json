It is contemporary with the Qijia culture to its southeast. It succeeded the Majiayao culture (2,300–2,000 BCE) in the area, and preceded the Siba culture.\nSome of its important archaeological sites are Xichengyi, Ganggangwa (where there are also some earlier Machang culture remains), and Huoshiliang (exclusively Xichengyi culture).\nThe Xichengyi culture practiced bronze smelting extensively, as seen by the quantity of slabs and furnace material (adobe constructions with blast pipes). The copper ore was from the neighbouring Beishan Mountain.\nFile:Huoshiliang site.jpg|Huoshiliang site, EBA 2000-1600 BCE\nFile:Huoshiliang bronze.jpg|Huoshiliang bronze slabs, 2000-1600 BCE\nFile:Huoshiliang pottery Xichenyi culture.jpg|Huoshiliang pottery shards, Xichenyi culture, 2000-1600 BCE\nFile:Ganggangwa site.jpg|Ganggangwa site\nFile:Ganggangwa site pottery, Xichengyi culture.jpg|Ganggangwa site pottery shards, Xichengyi culture, 2000-1600 BCE\nFile:Xichengyi adobe building and bronze slabs.png|Xichengyi adobe building and bronze slabs.\nFile:Xichengyi blast pipes.png|Xichengyi blast pipes.\nReferences"
