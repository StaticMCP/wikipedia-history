Bolsheviks on the other hand didn't have a shortage of ammunition. Mykhailo Pavlenko decided to raid Voznesensk in order to capture the necessary supplies. Some sources put the date of the battle at 16 April.\nBattle\nAround three o'clock, Ukrainian forces begun the offensive and Soviet forces opened fire. Ukrainian infantry reportedly clapped their hands while advancing due to lack of ammunition. Ukrainian forces were disadvantaged and eventually retreated. Red forces left their positions and pursued retreating Ukrainians. However, a fog that appeared gave an advantage to Ukrainian Cossack units and could only orient via sound. Bolsheviks continued attacking, but with advantage on Ukrainian side they were able to efficiently counterattack. Reds were later trapped and Zaporozhians wiped them out in the city during sabre battle. Only some of the Red cavalry managed to retreat.\nAftermath\nThe Ukrainian victory at Voznonesk allowed for Ukrainian forces to get the necessary supplies needed to continue their winter campaign. This battle was considered to be crucial for the outcome of winter campaign and existence of Ukrainian army.\nReferences"
