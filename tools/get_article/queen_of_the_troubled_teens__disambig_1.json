Initially, the single received only small scale acknowledgement in Edinburgh's record shops, and later received praise from local students and BBC Radio 1's Steve Lamacq.\nThis single is the only release to feature original bassist Phil Scanlon.\nQueen of the Troubled Teens, can be downloaded for free (along with second single, \"Chandelier\") by fans who enter the CD version of Scottish Fiction - Best of 1997-2007 into their computer.\nDuring an interview in 2007, Roddy Woomble mentioned that he had: \"one copy of ‘Queen Of The Troubled Teens’, but the thing is that it’s rubbish. I mean, for what it is – when I look back, like I do with fondness at copies of a favourite book or something – musically it’s just a bunch of 19-year-olds. Of course it’s part of the band’s history, but I think things have moved on.”\nThe song has appeared on recent setlists, and remains a fan-favourite.\nTrack listing\n#\"Queen of the Troubled Teens\"\n#\"Faster\"\n#\"Self Healer\" (Original version)\nReferences"
