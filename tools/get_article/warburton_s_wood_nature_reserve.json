Together with Well Wood, a similar clough woodland to the east, it forms part of the Warburton's Wood and Well Wood Site of Special Scientific Interest, which covers a larger area of .\nTrees include familiar species such as pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and hazel (Corylus avellana), but also small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) and wild service-tree (Sorbus torminalis), which are uncommon in Cheshire.\nThe Wildlife Trust also owns the adjacent Hunter's Wood Nature Reserve, on which trees have been planted to act as a wildlife corridor, and with the hope that specialist plants from the ancient woodland will eventually colonise.\nReferences"
