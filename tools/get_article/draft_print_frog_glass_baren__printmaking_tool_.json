Introduced in 2014, it is the first production glass baren designed specifically for relief hand printing.\nHistory\nMatt Bagley developed the Print Frog Glass Baren to print warped or irregular blocks that could not be run through a press. The first production models were released in 2014 by Iron Frog Press. Over time, the tool has evolved into multiple models, including Studio, Tadpole, Froglette, and Pro, which are used by printmakers internationally.\nDesign\nThe Print Frog Glass Baren features a solid glass construction that provides consistent weight and smooth movement across paper for relief printmaking. The bottom surface is smooth to reduce friction and improve ink transfer. It has an ergonomic grip designed for comfortable use during extended printing sessions.\nThe baren is compatible with a variety of printmaking techniques and surfaces, including relief printing, chine-collé, mokulito (Japanese lithography), and monoprinting.\nReception\nThe Print Frog Glass Baren has been recognized in independent printmaking and art media. In 2022, *Uppercase* magazine included it in the *Encyclopedia of Inspiration: Art Supplies*, noting its suitability for precise hand printing.\nRegional art publication *Glasstire* profiled Matt Bagley, highlighting the Print Frog Glass Baren as a notable innovation in his printmaking practice.\nIn December 2024, NBC 5 Dallas–Fort Worth aired a *Texas Today* segment, *How to Make Your Own Prints*, demonstrating the baren in use.\nSecondary coverage appears in online craft media. For example, *The Weekend Beckons* blog included the Print Frog Glass Baren in a roundup of professional linocut tools.\nSee also\n* Baren (printmaking)\n* Relief printing\n* Printmaking tools\nReferences\nReferences"
