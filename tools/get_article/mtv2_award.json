      "text": "# MTV2 Award\n\nThe MTV2 Award was first presented at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2001. The category recognized the best videos to have premiered and/or got their start on MTV's sister channel, MTV2. Much like the '''Viewer's Choice award, the MTV2 Award''' was also fan-voted. Until 2005, the award was considered to be one of the main awards of the night, even being presented on the main show; in 2006, though, the MTV2 Award was relegated to being handed out during a commercial break of the MTV2 simulcast of the VMAs. The following year, as the VMAs were revamped, the MTV2 Award was eliminated and subsequently never brought back.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year !! Winner !!
