This was confirmed by Kamal ad-Din Binai:\nAccording to Binai and Shadi, however, Muhammad Shaybani hurried to outpace the Sultan and set out for Suzak himself, accompanied by a hundred warriors\nBattle\nThe battle took place in winter, during the cold days near the fortifications of Suzak. Binai writes that, despite the numerical superiority, the Kazakh Sultan's army was scattered, and Muhammad Shaybani took a large spoil and returned to Sygnak without attempting to capture the Suzak fortress or secure this strategically important possession of the Kazakh Sultan in the struggle for the steppe. This highlights the illusory nature of Muhammad Shaybani's victory. Soon, Mahmud Sultan gathered his forces, and Burunduk came to his aid. The united Kazakh army was vast, \"beyond counting,\" as Molla Shadi metaphorically describes. Upon learning of Burunduk's arrival at Suzak and the unification of the Kazakh forces, Muhammad Shaybani hastened to depart from Sygnak towards Suzak. The meeting with the Kazakh armies took place at the Sogunluk Pass in the Karatau Mountains. Although Sultan Mahmud, the son of Khan Janibek, fell in battle, Muhammad Shaybani also suffered a decisive defeat, one that even his future court historians could not ignore.\nEffects\nAfter his defeat, Muhammad Shaybani was forced to leave Turkestan. According to the source \"Tawarikh-i Guzida-yi Nusrat-nama\" from Khwarezm, he went to Mangyshlak. Thus, the second attempt by Muhammad Shaybani to establish control over his grandfather's lands also ended in failure, particularly in the Syr Darya region, especially in the steppe areas of Kazakhstan's Dasht-i Kipchak, where Burunduk Khan had already seized Sygnak.\nMeaning\nJanibek and Kerei, Kazakh khans, and later the son of the latter, Burunduk, in the 1470s successfully subdued Eastern Dasht-i Kipchak, strengthening their positions in the southern regions of Kazakhstan. With holdings in Western Zhetysu, they became a significant political force in the steppes of Central Kazakhstan, although they faced strong opponents from the Shaybanids and the leaders of the Mangyts.\nReferences\nBibliography\nRecommended literature\n*\n*"
