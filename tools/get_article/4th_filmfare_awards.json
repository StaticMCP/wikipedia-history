Shantaram), thus becoming the most-awarded film at the ceremony.\nWhile most of the nominated films were released in 1956, the films which won most of the main awards were 1955 releases. Devdas, Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje, Seema and Shree 420 were 1955 films, but were not considered for the 3rd Filmfare Awards.\nFor the first time in the history of Filmfare Awards did a winner refuse to accept their award – Vyjayanthimala, who won Best Supporting Actress for Devdas, declined her award as she thought that her role was not supporting and was equally important as that film's other female lead, Suchitra Sen.\nNutan won her first of five Best Actress awards for her performance in Seema.\nMain Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Best Film\n!style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje – Rajkamal Kala Mandir – V.
