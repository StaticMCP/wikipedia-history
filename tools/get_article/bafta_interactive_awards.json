No mention of Interactive Awards was made, and all traces of the ceremony vanished shortly afterwards when BAFTA's website was reorganised, making it the shortest running event in BAFTA's history.\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Host\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! 2003\n| scope=\"row\" |19 February 2004\n| London\n| rowspan=\"2\"\n| }}\n|-\n! 2004\n| scope=\"row\" |2 March 2005\n| Café Royal, London\n| }}\n|-\n|}\nChildren's Learning\n:2004 : [http://www.headlinehistory.co.uk Headline History]\n:2003 : (not awarded)\nDesign\n:2004 : Alexander McQueen Website\n:2003 : Greenwich Millennium Village\nDVD\n:2004 : The Chaplin Collection\n:2003 : Lion King - Special Edition DVD\nFactual\n:2004 : Stagework\n:2003 : (two awards - Online & Offline)\nFilm/TV website\n:2004 : Trauma\n:2003 : Starfinder\nInteractive Arts\n:2004 : Frequency and Volume\n:2003 : Alleph.net\nInteractive Arts Installation\n:2004 : (not awarded)\n:2003 : The House of Osama Bin Laden\nInteractive TV\n:2004 : Spooks Interactive\n:2003 :\tV:MX\nMusic\n:2004 : SSEYO miniMIXA\n:2003 : (not awarded)\nNew Talent Award\n:2004 : Dan Jones\n:2003 : (not awarded)\nNews & Sport\n:2004 : England's Exit From Euro 2004\n:2003 : (not awarded)\nOffline Factual\n:2004 : (single Factual award)\n:2003 : DNA Interactive DVD\nOffline Learning\n:2004 : (combined with Online Learning)\n:2003 : Knowledge Box\nOnline Entertainment\n:2004 : Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Adventure Game - 20th Anniversary Edition\n:2003 : Celebdaq\nOnline Factual\n:2004 : (single Factual award)\n:2003 : Tate Online\nOnline Learning\n:2004 : Stagework\n:2003 : Bodysong\nTechnical Innovation\n:2004 : Careers Wales Online\n:2003 : The Darkhouse\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080412130117/http://www.headlinehistory.co.uk/ Headline History]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080405025301/http://www.alexandermcqueen.com/flash.html Alexander McQueen]"
