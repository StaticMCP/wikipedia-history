Yawar's wife was Mama Chicya (or Chu-Ya) and their sons were Paucar Ayllu and Pahuac Hualpa Mayta. Yawar's name refers to a story that he was abducted as a child by the Sinchi (Warlord) Tokay Qhapaq of the Ayarmaca nation, crying tears of blood over his predicament. He eventually escaped with the help of one of his captor's mistresses, Chimpu Orma. Assuming the reign at the age of 19, Yawar conquered Pillauya, Choyca, Yuco, Chillincay, Taocamarca and Cavinas.\nNotes\nReferences\n-\n| after  = Viracocha Inca\n}}"
