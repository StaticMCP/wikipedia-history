In 1903 he published his first novel, The Chasm, co-authored with Reginald Wright Kauffman, which received favorable reviews.\nOn June 1, 1907, Carpenter married the illustrator Helen Alden Knipe; later they collaborated as writers.\nCarpenter began writing plays while working at the Inquirer from 1905 to 1916, beginning with The Dragon Fly in 1905 (with Luther Long), followed by a dramatization of his own 1906 novel Captain Courtesy, which was later made into a silent film of the same title, Captain Courtesy.  His longest-running plays were The Cinderella Man in 1916, with 192 performances, The Bachelor Father in 1928, with 264 performances (later made into a film, The Bachelor Father), and Whistling in the Dark, co-authored with Laurence Gross, in 1932, with 144 performances (also later made into a film, Whistling in the Dark).\nFrom 1924 to 1927, Carpenter was president of the Dramatists' Theatre, Inc. In 1922, he became the second elected president of the Dramatists Guild of America. He was re-elected in 1929 continuing on as the Guild's fifth president until 1935.  He was a member of the Franklin Inn Club in Philadelphia, and The Players and The Lambs clubs in New York City.\nCarpenter died in Torrington, Connecticut on October 7, 1950. He and his wife, writer and illustrator Helen Alden (née Knipe) Carpenter, are interred in Town Hill Cemetery in New Hartford, Connecticut.\nWorks\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Year\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Title\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Genre\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1903\n|The Chasm\n|Book (with Reginald Wright Kauffman)\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1905\n|The Dragon Fly\n|Play (with John Luther Long)\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1906\n|Captain Courtesy: A Tale of Southern California\n|Book (Illustrated by Elenore Plaisted Abbott)\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1906\n|Remembrance\n|Play\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1907\n|The Code of Victor Jallot; a Romance of Old New Orleans\n|Book (Illustrated by Elenore Plaisted Abbott)\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1909\n|The Barber of New Orleans\n|Play\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1911\n|The Challenge\n|Play\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1912\n|The Easy Mark\n|Book\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1913\n|The Tongues of Men\n|Play\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1916\n|The Cinderella Man\n|Play\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1916\n|The Cinderella Man, A Romance of Youth\n|Book (with Helen Knipe Carpenter)\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1917\n|The Pipes of Pan\n|Play\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1917\n|The Three Bears\n|Play\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1920\n| Bab (dramatization of the novel by Mary Roberts Rinehart)\n|Play, Comedy\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1921\n|Pot Luck\n|Play, Comedy\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1923\n|Connie Goes Home\n|Play, Comedy\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1926\n|Scotch Mist\n|Play, Comedy\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1928\n|The Bachelor Father\n|Play\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1932\n|Whistling in the Dark\n|Play, Farce, Melodrama\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1933\n|Melody\n|Play, Musical, Romance\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1934\n|Order Please\n|Play, Comedy\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1942\n|''Shylock's Daughter\n|Play, Drama (with Helen Knipe Carpenter)\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1942\n|Queen of the South; from Ancient Rabbinical & Persian Legends\n|Play\n|-\n|rowspan=1|1944\n|Public Relations''\n|Play\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
