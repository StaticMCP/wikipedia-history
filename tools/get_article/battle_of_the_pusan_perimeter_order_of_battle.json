The engagement brought each side to muster substantial ground, air and sea resources to fight across southeastern Korea.\nThe UN brought to bear hundreds of units from member countries South Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Several other nations augmented the large naval task forces with ships of their own, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and The Netherlands. Opposing the UN force was the entirety of the North Korean military.\nUN forces proved superior to the North Koreans in organization and numbers, but UN forces also suffered from a lack of equipment and training, particularly in their ground forces. As the battles around Pusan Perimeter continued, UN forces and equipment continued to flood into Korea, giving them overwhelming advantages in their land, air, and sea components. Though many nations would eventually contribute forces to the Korean War, the majority of troops at the battle were American and South Korean only.\nNorth Korean forces were inferior to the UN forces in number, but in several cases they were able to make up for this in superior training. North Korean air and naval forces were small and poorly trained and equipped, thus playing a negligible role in the battle. However North Korean ground troops were often well trained and well equipped with modern weapons. The protracted battle around the perimeter severely depleted these troops forcing the North Koreans to rely increasingly on conscripts and replacements, diminishing their advantage in the battle and leading them to an eventual defeat.\nUN Forces\nGround\nDouglas MacArthur (center) retained overall command of the UN forces during the fight at Pusan]]\nThe United Nations forces were organized under the command of the United States Army. The Eighth United States Army served as the headquarters component for the UN forces, and was headquartered at Taegu. Under it were three weak US Divisions; the 24th Infantry Division was brought to the country early in July, while the 1st Cavalry Division and 25th Infantry Division arrived between July 14 and July 18. These forces occupied the western segment of the perimeter, along the Naktong river.\nThe Republic of Korea Army, a force of 58,000, was organized into two corps and five divisions; from east to west, ROK I Corps controlled the 8th Infantry Division and Capital Divisions, while the ROK II Corps controlled the 1st Division and 6th Infantry Division. A reconstituted ROK 3rd Division was placed under direct ROK Army control.  Morale among the UN units was low due to the large number of defeats at that point in the war. US Forces had suffered over 6,000 casualties over the past month while the South Korean Army had lost an estimated 70,000.\nmove to Pusan Perimeter]]\nTroop numbers at the beginning of the battle were initially difficult to estimate for US and North Korean forces. Subsequent research indicates that the North Korean army had around 70,000 combat troops committed to the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, with most of its divisions far understrength. It likely had less than 3,000 personnel in mechanized units, and around 40 T-34 tanks at the front due to extensive losses so far in the war. MacArthur reported 141,808 UN troops in Korea on August 4, of which 47,000 were in US ground combat units and 45,000 were in South Korean combat units. Thus the UN ground force outnumbered the North Koreans 92,000 to 70,000.\nThroughout September 1950 as the battle raged, more UN forces arrived from the US and other locations. The 2nd Infantry Division, 5th Regimental Combat Team, and 1st Provisional Marine Brigade and a British Army brigade arrived in Pusan later in the fighting, along with large numbers of fresh troops and equipment, including over 500 tanks. By the end of the battle, Eighth Army's force had gone from three under-strength divisions to four fully manned formations which were well equipped and well prepared for war. By the end of the battle, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade had arrived to assist the American and South Korean units.\nUS 8th Army\nEighth United States Army\nCommander: Lieutenant General Walton H.

This support was provided primarily by the Far East Air Forces (FEAF) and the Fifth Air Force, but US Navy and US Marine Corps aviation played a substantial role in supporting operations from the sea. UN Forces had complete control of the air and sea throughout the fight. and US Air Force and US Navy elements provided support for the ground units throughout the battle virtually unopposed. By the end of the battle the Eighth Army had more air support than General Omar Bradley's Twelfth United States Army Group in Europe during World War II.\nBy the end of July, the US had shipped a large number of aircraft of all types to Korea. On 30 July, the Far East Air Forces had 890 planes-626 F-80's and 264 F-51's-but only 525 of them were in units and available and ready for combat.\nThe Far East Air Force commanded a large contingent of long-range heavy bomber aircraft, and these assets were based in Japan, far from the North Koreans' striking range. Generally, the massive striking power was too unwieldy for the UN to use against the dispersed North Korean units, and the airpower of FEAF's B-29 Superfortresses was passed over in favor of smaller and more versatile fighter bombers of the Fifth Air Force. Under orders from MacArthur, however, the FEAF bomber command conducted one mission during the Pusan Perimeter fights.\nOn August 16, in the midst of the fight around Taegu, conducted one large carpet bombing operation northwest of Waegwan, where up to 40,000 North Korean troops were believed to be massing. The bombers from 10,000 feet dropped approximately 960 tons of 500- and 1,000-pound bombs. The attack had required the entirety of the FEAF bombing component, and they had dropped 3,084  bombs and 150  bombs. This comprised the largest Air Force operation since the Battle of Normandy in World War II.\nGeneral Walker reported to General MacArthur the next day that the damage done to the North Koreans by the bombing couldn't be evaluated because of smoke and dust, and ground forces couldn't reach it because of North Korean fire. Information obtained later from North Korean prisoners revealed the enemy divisions the Far East Command thought to be still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and were not in the bombed area. No evidence was found that the bombing killed a single North Korean soldier.\nHowever, the bombing seems to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks against enemy tactical troops unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces. They subsequently canceled a second bombing of an area east of the Naktong scheduled for August 19.\nFar East Air Force and 5th Air Force\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"| Far East Air Forces\nCommander: Lieutenant General George E.

Carrier Air Group 5 was the only Carrier-based air wing in the Far East at the time of the outbreak of war. Many of the pilots operating these aircraft were World War II veterans, however budget cuts following the end of the war had greatly reduced their training and readiness in the months before the war.\nEarly in the war, these aircraft were used primarily to conduct raids and gather intelligence on North Korean ground targets, focused on disrupting North Korean supply to the front lines. However, as soon as UN forces retreated to Pusan Perimeter following the Battle of Taejon, the Naval aircraft were immediately re purposed for close-air support and airstrikes against North Korean ground troops on the front. These missions were significantly more risky and the aircraft suffered much higher losses due to North Korean ground fire.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=33%; align= center | Unit\n! width=33%; align= center | Sub-units\n! width=33%; align= center | Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|  Carrier Air Group 5\n|\n* Fighter Squadron 51 (F9F Panther)\n* Fighter Squadron 52 (F9F Panther)\n* Fighter Squadron 53 (F4U-4B Corsair)\n* Fighter Squadron 54 (AD-1 Skyraider)\n* Attack Squadron 55 (AD-1 Skyraider)\n|| Based on USS Valley Forge\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|  Carrier Air Group 11\n|\n* Fighter Squadron 111 (F9F Panther)\n* Fighter Squadron 112 (F9F Panther)\n* Fighter Squadron 113 (F4U-4B Corsair)\n* Fighter Squadron 114 (F4U-4B Corsair)\n* Attack Squadron 115 (AD-1 Skyraider)\n||Based on USS Philippine Sea\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 13th Carrier Air Group (Fleet Air Arm)\n|\n* 800 Naval Air Squadron (Fairey Firefly and Supermarine Seafire)\n* 827 Naval Air Squadron (Fairey Firefly and Supermarine Seafire)\n||Based on HMS Triumph\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|  Marine Aircraft Group 33\n|\n* Marine Fighter Squadron 214 (F4U-4B Corsair)\n* Marine Fighter Squadron 323 (F4U-4B Corsair)\n* Marine Night Fighter Squadron 513 (F4U-5N Corsair and F7F Tigercat)\n* Marine Observation Squadron 6 (OY-2 Observation craft and HO3S1 Helicopter)\n* Marine Tactical Air Control Squadron 2 - Air Support Section co-located with Brigade CP\n||Part of 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.

Ships of the fleet provided supporting artillery fire during pitched ground battles and provided a route of resupply and evacuation during other junctures. Multiple aircraft carriers provided bases for large contingents of aircraft that flew sorties and air strikes over North Korean ground forces.\nUN ships continued to stream into the theater during and after the Pusan Perimeter engagement, and they played varying roles in support of the battle. The fleet was split into three primary groups; Task Force 77 formed the primary Aircraft carrier and striking component of the fleet, Task Force 96 consisted of a variety of smaller ships concerned with coastal bombardment, and Task Force 90 formed an attack transport squadron to assist in the evacuation and movement of ground troops.\nOverall command of the naval force was taken by the US Seventh Fleet, and the bulk of the naval power provided was also from the US. The United Kingdom also provided a small naval task force including an aircraft carrier and several cruisers. Eventually, Australia, Canada and New Zealand provided ships as well. The Republic of Korea Navy itself was almost negligible during the battle. The South Koreans had a very small navy consisting of a few dozen minesweepers, LSTs, PT boats and other small craft donated to them by other UN member states. Compared to the larger UN fleet these craft played a very small role in the engagement, but North Korean naval ships, which were also very small, tended to target the ROK fleet more often.\nUS 7th Fleet\nUnder Vice Admiral Arthur D. Struble, Task Force 77 formed the core Carrier striking force of the UN forces. The force contained the UN aircraft carriers as well as a number of attendant escorts. The lineup of the escorts differed as ships were assigned roles in Task Force 96 during the course of the battle.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=33%; align= center | Ship name\n! width=33%; align= center | Class\n! width=33%; align= center | Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|| USS Valley Forge (CV-45)\n||Essex-class aircraft carrier\n||Arrived in theater in early July with Carrier Air Group 5.\n|-\n|| USS Philippine Sea (CV-47)\n||Essex-class aircraft carrier\n||Arrived in theater August 5 with Carrier Air Group 11.

Turner Joy, was the largest organization of UN forces by number of ships. The force consisted primarily of cruisers, destroyers, and other smaller ships, which were used to blockade North Korean waterways and conduct coastal bombardments. Ships in this role would also periodically switch to Task Force 77, acting as a screen and escort for the UN aircraft carriers. This force was also the most diverse of the forces, as ships from five nations would eventually be assigned to it.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=33%; align= center | Ship name\n! width=33%; align= center | Class\n! width=33%; align= center | Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|| USS Helena (CA-75)\n||Baltimore-class heavy cruiser\n||\n|-\n|| USS Juneau (CL-119)\n||Atlanta-class light cruiser\n||\n|-\n|| HMS Jamaica (C44)\n||Crown Colony-class light cruiser\n||\n|-\n|| HMS Kenya (C14)\n||Crown Colony-class light cruiser\n||Arrived in theater June 30.\n|-\n|| HMS Belfast (C35)\n||Town-class light cruiser\n||Flagship of 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron, Far East Fleet.

Doyle, was primarily concerned with amphibious operations in the theater. As such, it contained no combat ships, only attack transports and a large number of LSTs. The force consisted entirely of US ships. At least 15 LSTs were assigned to the force during the battle to support the attack transports.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=33%; align= center | Ship name\n! width=33%; align= center | Class\n! width=33%; align= center | Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|| USS Mount McKinley (AGC-7)\n||Mount McKinley-class command ship\n||\n|-\n|| USS Cavalier (APA-37)\n||Bayfield-class attack transport\n||\n|-\n|| USS Titania (AKA-13)\n||Arcturus-class attack cargo ship\n||\n|-\n|| USS Oglethorpe (AKA-100)\n||Andromeda-class attack cargo ship\n||\n|-\n|| USS Diphda (AKA-59)\n||Andromeda-class attack cargo ship\n||\n|-\n|| USS Alshain (AKA-55)\n||Andromeda-class attack cargo ship\n||\n|-\n|| USS Union (AKA-106)\n||Tolland-class attack cargo ship\n||\n|-\n|| USS Arikara (AT-98)\n||Abnaki-class tug\n||\n|-\n|| USS Diachenko (APD-123)\n||Crosley-class high speed transport\n||\n|-\n|| USS Horace A.

However, defensive actions by US and South Korean forces had delayed the North Koreans significantly in their invasion of South Korea, costing them 58,000 of their troops and a large number of tanks. To recoup these losses, the North Koreans had to rely on less experienced replacements and conscripts, many of whom they took from the conquered regions of South Korea. During the course of the battle, the North Koreans raised a total of 13 infantry divisions and one armored division to the fight at Pusan Perimeter.\nFrom south to northeast, the North Korean units initially positioned opposite the UN units were the 83rd Motorized Regiment of the 105th Armored Division and then the 6th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 15th, 1st, 13th, 8th, 12th, and 5th Divisions and the 766th Independent Infantry Regiment.\nNorth Korean People's Army\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|  North Korean People's Army\nCommander-in-chief: Choi Yong-kunCommander, Advanced General Headquarters: Kim Chaek\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n! width=20%; align= center | Unit\n! width=25%; align= center | Commander\n! width=20%; align= center | Sub-units\n! width=35%; align= center | Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|| I Corps\n|| Lieutenant General Kim Ung\n||\n||\n|-\n||2nd Infantry Division\n|| Major General Lee Ch'ong Song\n||\n* 4th Infantry Regiment\n* 6th Infantry Regiment\n* 17th Infantry Regiment\n||Estimated strength of 7,500 on August 5.

The navy possessed a few torpedo boats and gunboats among others, some of which were donated by the Soviet Union, but these ships were no match for the UN naval forces. Following the Battle of Chumonchin Chan, a one-sided engagement in which UN forces ambushed and crushed a small North Korean flotilla, North Korean ships generally avoided UN ships completely, leaving the UN naval forces virtually unopposed. North Korean torpedo boats may have conducted isolated attacks against similarly small South Korean ships but they did not oppose larger UN ships during the fight around the Pusan Perimeter. They could also not find resupply from Soviet or China as neither had a large standing navy in the region. This is seen by historians as one of the largest disadvantages North Korea had during the battle, as it allowed the UN complete sea and air superiority.\nAt the start of the Korean War in July, the Korean People's Air Force consisted of about 150 combat aircraft. This force was a mixture of Russian-built models and generally were in poor maintenance and repair. Fighter aircraft included Yakovlev Yak-7s, Yak-3s and a few Yak-9s, 70 in total. They controlled a handful of Ilyushin Il-10 for air-to-surface combat, and used Polikarpov Po-2 biplanes for training. These craft were poorly maintained and their pilots were eager but mostly untrained. However, the North Korean ground forces had much more modern equipment, including Anti-aircraft weapons and vehicles, which were more effective in threatening UN aircraft. North Korean aircraft engaged US aircraft in small, isolated dogfights throughout the battle, but the North Koreans were unable to muster a sufficient force of fighters to the front to seriously oppose the massive UN air component.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
