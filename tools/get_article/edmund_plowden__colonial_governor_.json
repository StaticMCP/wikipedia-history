This attempt, fraught with mutiny, legal woes, lack of funds, and bad timing and compromised by Plowden's ill-temper, was a failure, and Plowden returned to England in 1649.\nBiography\nThe grandson of the jurist, Edmund Plowden (1515–1585), Sir Edmund Plowden was born in 1590 to Francis Plowden (1562–1652) of Shiplake Court in Oxfordshire and Wokefield Park in Berkshire and his wife, Mary Fermor.  Plowden married Mabel Marriner (1596–1674) in 1609.\nReferences\n*Edward C.
