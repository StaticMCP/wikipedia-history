On August 13, 1862, Campbell was transferred to the 15th New Jersey Infantry Regiment and was made Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment before being wounded at the Battle of Antietam. In September 1864, he was made the main commander of the First New Jersey Brigade and commanded it throughout the battles of 3rd Winchester, Fisher's Hill, and Cedar Creek although he was wounded in the latter.\nAround the conclusion of the war, Campbell served within George Meade's staff as the Acting Judge Advocate. He was promoted to colonel on October 19, 1864, and brevetted brigadier general on April 9, 1865, for \"gallant and meritorious services during the recent operations resulting in the fall of Richmond, Va., and the surrender of the insurgent army under General Robert E. Lee\". He was then given command of the 4th New Jersey Infantry Regiment on May 29, 1865, before being honorably mustered out on July 9 in the same year.\nLater years\nCampbell initially returned to Trenton, New Jersey before moving to Trinidad, Colorado.
