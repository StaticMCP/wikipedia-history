The Warhawks, led by first year head coach Brooks Donald-Williams, played their home games at Fant–Ewing Coliseum and were members of the Sun Belt Conference. They finished the season 3–26, 1–17 in Sun Belt play to finish in dead-last twelfth place. They failed to qualify for the Sun Belt women's tournament.\nThis was Donald-Williams' first season at the helm of the Warhawks teams following the firing of Jeff Dow in March 2019. She came to Louisiana–Monroe after assistant stints at Alabama, Southern Miss, Memphis, and Arkansas–Little Rock and a nine-year stint at the helm of McNeese State's program including four 20+ win seasons, two conference tournament championships, and one regular season championship at McNeese.\nPreseason\nSun Belt coaches poll\nOn October 30, 2019, the Sun Belt released their preseason coaches poll with the Chanticleers predicted to finish in seventh place in the conference.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1 || Little Rock || 127 (6)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2 || Troy || 123 (4)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 3 || UT Arlington || 120 (1)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 4 || South Alabama || 119 (1)\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 5 || Appalachian State || 100\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6 || Georgia State || 73\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 7 || Coastal Carolina || 66\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 8 || Louisiana || 64\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 9 || Texas State || 59\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 10 || Arkansas State || 44\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 11 || Georgia Southern || 26\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 12 || Louisiana–Monroe || 15\n|}\nSun Belt Preseason All-Conference team\nNo Louisiana–Monroe members were chosen to the preseason team.\nRoster\n)\n|asst_coach=\n* Christie Sides ()\n* Jessica Barber ()\n* Kendra Wells ()\n|roster_url=https://ulmwarhawks.com/sports/womens-basketball/roster/2019-20\n|accessdate=16 August 2020\n}}\nSchedule\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Sun Belt regular season\nSee also\n2019–20 Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks men's basketball team\nReferences\nExternal links"
