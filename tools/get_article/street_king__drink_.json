The product was manufactured and distributed by Street King LLC in New York, NY.\nThe drink was sold in  shots which contain a caffeine amount of 285&nbsp;mg, comparable to that of 2-3 cups of coffee. Street King was available in orange-mango and grape.\nPhilanthropy\nIn September 2011, Jackson publicly committed to donating one billion meals to the World Food Program over five years. If he reaches this goal, Jackson would become the 20th largest donor to the organization.  Each meal is covered by a 10 cent donation to the World Food Program for each shot purchased.  He donated 3.5 million meals between the launch in September 2011 and January 2012.\nMarketing\nStreet King was rebranded as \"SK Energy\" in summer 2012. Street King was marketed heavily over social media, including videos with Pauly D and Joan Rivers.\nThe drink had gained a number of celebrity endorsements, including Joan Rivers; Pauly D; Free agent Wes Welker; Erin Andrews; J. R. Smith of the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nLosing money\nSK Energy was losing \"millions\" of dollars per year, according to Jackson's accountant, in July 2015.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
