Formed in April 2018, it is responsible for managing government property and advising government departments in their management of property.\nHistory\nA similar organisation to the GPA, the Property Services Agency, existed between 1972 and 1993. It was disbanded in favour of government departments taking on responsibility for managing their own property. The GPA was created in shadow form in 2017 and formally established as an executive agency of the Cabinet Office in 2018.\nFunctions\nThe GPA delivers \"property and workplace solutions\" to the various departments of the United Kingdom government. It is designed to introduce a \"portfolio-led approach to managing central government general purpose property as a strategic asset\". It is, or is becoming, the legal owner of the government general purpose estate, and works with government departments to manage their property. The GPA is a national organisation, working with client departments across the country. In addition to London, they have offices in Swindon, Coventry, Newport, Manchester, Leeds, and Norwich.\nThe GPA describes themselves as \"behav[ing] like a commercial real estate company\". They are responsible for managing the government's central estate offices and warehouses, supporting government departments as tenants, providing workplace services to government departments and providing portfolio advice to support departments' objectives.\nGovernance\nThe GPA is governed by a Board, and managed by the GPA Executive Committee.
