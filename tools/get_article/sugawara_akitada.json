      "text": "# Sugawara Akitada\n\nis a fictional character and a hero in a series of historical detective/mystery short stories and novels written by I. J. Parker, set in the Heian period of ancient Japan.\nIntroduction\nThe character lived in 11th century Japan, and came from a family of scholar-officials.  It was revealed through short stories and novels that he was trained in orthodox (Confucianist) education, followed his family's tradition of entering the university, and graduated first in the final year, having specialised in law.  His family suffered financially when prior to the completion of his education, his father died.\nIn the stories, Sugawara Akitada entered the civil service as a junior clerk in the Ministry of Law, with an income barely able to support his family: his mother who was shown as always being inexplicably hostile to him (the reason not revealed until the novel Hell Screen), two younger sisters and a small staff of family retainers.\nAs according to the era, the character was shown to be under immense pressure for the great responsibility to ensure his sisters married well - the only promising path for women of the era.  Finding successful 'good' match would depend on the level of prestige of the family (as reflected through social status, wealth and rank), and the dowry he could offer.\nThe character's inquisitive mind and strong sense of justice got him involved in a variety of difficult cases, which he was usually able to solve, some in his personal capacity, some in the capacity of his job.\nThe main frustrations faced though was that his stubborn nature was not appreciated in a society, especially within the bureaucracy, which prized orthodoxy, conformity (to hierarchy), stability and unquestioning obedience to figures of authority.  In the stories, Akitada was constantly reprimanded and even dismissed several times by his superiors.\nTo balance the odds, the author gave him allies in the form of several influential personages in the Imperial Court who respected and supported him, and appreciated his integrity.\nList of appearances in publications\nAccording to the author herself, \"The writing of the first Akitada novels actually predates the stories by more than a decade, but it was to be the stories that brought the novels into print.\"\nShort stories\nThe following is a list of stories, in chronological order of publication in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, that features Sugawara Akitada:\n# Instruments of Murder (October 1997).\n# ''The Curio Dealer's Wife (November 1997).\n# A Master of Go (December 1998).\n# Akitada's First Case (July/August 1999).
