      "text": "# Taiwan independence Left\n\nThe Taiwan independence Left () are the leftist political and economic ideologies of the participants in the Taiwan independence movement, which favored left-wing nationalism, anti-imperialism, socialism (mainly social democracy or Trotskyism) and progressivism.\nThe Taiwan Statebuilding Party, the New Power Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party Taiwan, and the Taiwan Obasang Political Equality Party are left-wing parties that support Taiwan independence. The International Socialist Forward is a revolutionary socialist (Trotskyist) political organization that supports Taiwanese independence. Some of the Taiwan Independence Left collaborate with the main moderate Taiwanese nationalist Democratic Progressive Party and others distance themselves.\nHistory\nToday's main Taiwanese nationalist movements have been bent on anti-communism and pro-Americanism to oppose Chinese imperialism, but historically, Taiwanese nationalist movements have adopted national liberation concepts derived from Marxism and Leninism to resist Japanese colonial rule and KMT dictatorship; Su Beng and Lee Teng-hui were members of the Chinese Communist Party in the late 1940s, and there was also a short-lived radical leftist party called the Taiwan Revolutionary Party in the 1980s.\nTaiwan under Japanese rule\nThere were left-leaning political parties for Taiwan independence, such as the Taiwanese Communist Party during the period of Taiwan under Japanese rule. The Taiwan independence movement under Japan was supported by Mao Zedong in the 1930s as a means of freeing Taiwan from Japanese rule, but he changed this position only after the Nationalists started claiming Taiwan with the Cairo Declaration.\nTaiwan under Republic of China rule\nTaiwan independence activists and leftists have been the main victims of \"white terror\" by the Kuomintang-led ROC government in the past.\nThe Democratic Progressive Party was left-wing in its early days, but it turned to a moderate Taiwanese nationalist party; The DPP does not support strict left-wing views on labor issues, and supports Huadu rather than Taiwanese independence.\nSee also\n* Anarchism in Taiwan\n* Chinese imperialism\n* Labor movement in Taiwan\n* List of political parties in Taiwan\n* New Tide faction\n* Progressivism in Taiwan\n* Taiwan Communist Party\n*\n* Taiwan Independence Revolutionary Armed Force\nReferences"
