Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Zambia accepted the convention on June 4, 1984, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. , there is only one World Heritage Site in Zambia, Mosi-oa-Tunya / Victoria Falls, which it's shared with Zimbabwe. Zambia has served on the World Heritage Committee once, from 2021 to 2025.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n!

Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Zambia maintains 7 properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Dag Hammarskjoeld Memorial (Crash site)\n|\n|Copperbelt Province\n| align=\"center\" |1997\n|i, ii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Kalambo falls archaeological site (prehistoric settlement site)\n|\n|Northern Province\n| align=\"center\" |1997\n|i, ii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Chirundu Fossil Forest\n|\n|Southern Province\n| align=\"center\" |2009\n|vii, viii (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Mwela Rock Paintings\n|\n|Northern Province\n| align=\"center\" |2009\n|iii, v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Kalambo Falls\n|\n|Northern Province\n| align=\"center\" |2009\n|iii, iv, vii, viii (mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Zambezi Source\n|\n|North-Western Province\n| align=\"center\" |2009\n|x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Barotse Cultural Landscape\n|\n|Western Province\n| align=\"center\" |2009\n|iii, v (cultural)\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links"
