      "text": "# Nigerian Presidential Transport Fleet\n\nThe Nigerian Presidential Transport Fleet encompasses a range of air and ground vehicles dedicated to the secure and efficient movement of the President of Nigeria, the Vice President, and other senior government officials. Managed primarily by the Nigerian Air Force and the State Security Service, this fleet is a vital component of the nation's executive transport infrastructure.\nPresidential air fleet\nThe Presidential Air Fleet (PAF) is operated by the Nigerian Air Force and is  headquartered at the Presidential Wing of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. As of 2024, the fleet comprises approximately ten aircraft, including both fixed-wing jets and helicopters tailored for VIP transport.\nHistory\nThe Presidential Air Fleet (PAF) was created in January 1996 following a directive from General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's 10th Head of State. This directive unified the military-run Executive Airlift Group (EAG) and the civilian Presidential Fleet (PF) into a single entity.\nThe merger brought 11 aircraft under a centralized command, establishing the PAF as a cohesive operational unit. Its primary responsibility is to deliver safe, reliable, and comfortable air transportation for the President, Vice President, and other high-ranking government officials and dignitaries. The fleet operates under the supervision of the Chief of Staff to the President, with strategic guidance provided by the Office of the National Security Adviser.\nSeizure of airplanes\nIn 2021, Zhongshan Fucheng Industrial Investment Co. Ltd. obtained a US$70 million arbitral award against Nigeria under a Bilateral Investment Treaty following the termination of its joint venture in Ogun State. The dispute escalated after Ogun State officials demanded that two Zhongshan executives leave Nigeria or face \"forceful removal, complications, and possible prosecution,\" obtained arrest warrants against them, and requested the collection of their immigration papers. One executive was arrested at gunpoint, physically beaten, deprived of food and water, intimidated, and detained for ten days, while the other was repeatedly sought by police. Fearing for their safety, both executives ultimately fled Nigeria.\nZhongshan turned to arbitration under the BIT in London. The tribunal unanimously ruled in its favor, awarding approximately US$70 million plus interest, reasoning that the abusive and obstructive actions of Ogun State, the Nigeria Police, and related authorities were attributable to Nigeria under international law.\nTo enforce the award, Zhongshan pursued multiple asset seizures internationally. Most prominently, on 14 August 2024 the Paris Judicial Tribunal authorised the seizure of three aircraft from the Presidential Air Fleet: a Dassault Falcon 7X (5N-FGU, serial number 090), a Boeing 737-7N6/BBJ (5N-FGT, serial number 34260/1746), and an Airbus A330-243 (5N-FGA, serial number 1053), located at Paris-Le Bourget and Basel–Mulhouse airports.\nOperational role\nSince its formation, the PAF has been engaged in domestic and international missions. Besides serving the President and Vice President, the fleet is occasionally used by other high-ranking officials such as the Senate President, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Chief Justice of Nigeria, and former Presidents.\nAdditionally, the Presidential Air Fleet (PAF) supports Nigeria's foreign policy initiatives by facilitating missions coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This includes regional and continental engagements, particularly those involving the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union. For example, in 2003, the fleet transported former Liberian President Charles Taylor into exile in Calabar, Cross River State, during the tenure of President Olusegun Obasanjo.\nAircraft\nAs of 2024, the Presidential Air Fleet (PAF) consists of ten aircraft, including both fixed-wing and rotary-wing platforms. The primary aircraft currently in use are detailed below:\nAirbus A330 (NAF-001) The Airbus A330, designated NAF-001 and registered as 5N-FGA, serves as the primary presidential transport aircraft since 2024.\nIt replaced the older Boeing 737-700 BBJ (formerly designated NAF-001, registered 5N-FGT), which was acquired in 2005 under President Olusegun Obasanjo.\nThe A330 is a VIP-configured aircraft, approximately 15 years old at the time of acquisition. Reports indicate that the aircraft was purchased for around ₦150 billion (approximately USD $100 million), a price far below market rate, with an additional $50 million spent on retrofitting and systems upgrades.\nThe acquisition followed a recommendation by the Senate Committee on National Security and Intelligence, which cited frequent breakdowns and rising maintenance costs of the older fleet. The presidential jet NAF-001 operates under the call sign Eagle One when transporting the President of Nigeria.\nThe aircraft is equipped with advanced avionics, customized interior furnishings, and secure communication systems suitable for government operations.\nJust like the former NAF-001, the exact details of its defensive capabilities are classified, however, it is believed to be fitted with countermeasure systems such as the Airborne Missile Protection Systems (AMPS). These systems are designed for modular use and can be transferred across compatible aircraft.  The A330 also supports Airborne Surveillance, Information, and Observation (ASIO) capabilities.\nThe aircraft is configured for long-range, intercontinental travel and includes VIP private quarters, such as a master bedroom, bathroom with shower facilities, a lounge, communications centre, cabin and crew area, VIP conference room, VIP state room, business class seats for accompanying travelers, security area and dining space. It complies with European Union noise regulations and is permitted to land at airports worldwide.\nBoeing Business Jet 737-700The Boeing Business Jet 737-700, previously designated NAF-001 and registered 5N-FGT, served as Nigeria's primary presidential aircraft from 2005 until its replacement in 2024.\nThe aircraft was acquired during the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo and was configured for long-range executive transport. Following its decommissioning in 2024, the Nigerian government listed the aircraft for sale.\nThe jet features a master bedroom, shower facilities, a lounge area, and a conference/dining room. It is equipped with secure communication systems and defensive measures suitable for VIP operations. The aircraft meets European Union noise compliance standards, allowing access to airports with strict environmental regulations.\nOther aircraft in the PAF include:\n* Gulfstream G550 (5N-FGW)\n* Gulfstream G500\n* Gulfstream V-SP (5N-FGS)\n* Bombardier Challenger 605 (5N-FGZ)\n* Dassault Falcon 7X (5N-FGV and 5N-FGU)\n* AgustaWestland AW139 (2 units)\n* AgustaWestland AW189 (2 units)\nDecommissioned or retired aircraft\nOver time, the PAF has phased out, sold, or decommissioned several older aircraft, including:\n*Two Dassault Falcon 900s\n*Boeing Business Jet 737-700\n*Gulfstream IV-SP\n*Gulfstream II\n*Cessna Citation Bravo\n*Hawker\nThese were either returned to the Nigerian Air Force, sold, or destroyed on the advice of the Presidential Guard Brigade over age or operational concerns.\nGround transport\nThe ground transportation for the President of Nigeria is managed by the State Security Service (SSS), which operates a fleet of armored vehicles to ensure safe and secure transit during both official and personal engagements.\nHistorically, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class has served as the most commonly used state car due to its combination of cutting-edge security features and executive-level comfort. However, following his inauguration in 2023, President Bola Tinubu opted for an armored Cadillac Escalade as his official vehicle.\nThis Escalade has been custom-fitted to meet specific presidential security standards. In addition to the primary state vehicle, the SSS maintains a variety of armored SUVs and limousines from brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota, and Lexus. These vehicles are deployed according to operational and security needs.\nPresidential Convoy\nThe presidential motorcade typically comprises about 30 vehicles, including:\n*Police motorcycles and vehicles to lead and clear routes\n*SUVs carrying the SSS detail, key staff, and electronic countermeasure systems\n*SSS and Presidential Guards Brigade Assault Teams\n*Communications teams\n*Press vans\n*An ambulance\nThe State Security Service is responsible for maintaining the main presidential vehicles, while support vehicles used by the convoy are maintained by the Presidential Guards Brigade.\nArmored Features\nThe presidential vehicle—often a customized Mercedes-Benz S-Class—is extensively modified for high-level protection while maintaining a standard appearance. Key armored features include:\n*Bullet-resistant windows, constructed with alternating layers of glass and polycarbonate using a system called controlled delamination, capable of withstanding high-caliber gunfire\n*Bomb-proof reinforcement throughout the vehicle's structure\n*Upgraded suspension, brakes, and shock absorbers to support the added weight of armor\n*Run-flat tires capable of maintaining speeds of up to 90 km/h even after a puncture or direct attack\nThe President's vehicle is strategically positioned at the center of the motorcade, surrounded by other armored S-Class sedans or SUVs operated by SSS personnel to maximize protection.\nBudget and public perception\nThe maintenance and operation of the Presidential Transport Fleet have been subjects of public scrutiny, especially concerning expenditures during economic challenges. In 2023, the government allocated approximately $38 million for the presidential air fleet, vehicles, and residential renovations. This spending drew criticism from citizens facing economic hardships.\nThe acquisition of the Airbus A330-200 in 2024 also sparked debate. While officials justified the purchase as a necessary replacement for the aging Boeing 737 BBJ, critics viewed it as an extravagant expense amid national economic concerns.\nOversight and management\nThe Presidential Air Fleet operates under the purview of the Nigerian Air Force, with strategic decisions influenced by the Office of the National Security Adviser. The State Security Service oversees ground transportation, ensuring the President's safety through a combination of armored vehicles and trained personnel. The Presidential Guard Brigade provides additional security, particularly during official ceremonies and public engagements.\nThe fleet has five wings: Administration, Engineering, Operations, Operation Services, and Supply.\nSee also\n* President of Nigeria\n* Nigerian Air Force\n* State Security Service (Nigeria)\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n* Presidential Guards Brigade\nReferences"
