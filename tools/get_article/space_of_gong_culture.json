      "text": "# Space of gong culture\n\nThe space of gong culture in the Vietnam Highlands () is a region in Central Vietnam that is home to cultures that value gongs. It spreads in the Tây Nguyên (Central Highlands) provinces of Kon Tum, Gia Lai, Đắk Lắk, Đắk Nông, and Lâm Đồng. The UNESCO recognized it as a Masterpiece of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity on November 25, 2005.\nThe gong culture sees gongs as a privileged connection between men and the supernatural, where each gong houses a deity whose power corresponds to the gong's age. It has been strongly affected by economic and social transformations that disrupted the traditional transfer of knowledge and stripped the gongs of their spiritual significance.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00120 UNESCO recognizes space of Gong]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090912002154/http://www.festivalcongchieng.vn/ Official website of Central Highland's Gong Culture Festival]"
