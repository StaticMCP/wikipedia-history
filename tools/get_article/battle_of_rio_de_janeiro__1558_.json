The Portuguese, though in far smaller numbers, defeated the French and made them flee to the jungle. The French town was then burnt by Mem de Sá, the Portuguese governor.\nBackground\nA few years before, the French admiral and colonist Villegagnon and his friend and comrade, Admiral Coligny, managed to build a fort in the area of modern-day Rio de Janeiro which they called Fort Coligny. As the French colony grew in size and power it was named Henriville and became a serious threat to the Portuguese establishment in Brazil.\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165140/http://palma1.no.sapo.pt/franceses.htm A Tentativa dos Franceses se estabelecerem no Brasil]"
