He made his first foray into poker in 1993, when he joined some friends for a game in one of Toronto's private clubs. As a recreational poker player, he had previously entered only a few major tournaments, one of which was the 1994 World Series of Poker championship event, where he finished in 22nd place.\nAt the 1995 World Series of Poker main event, Goldfarb made it to the final table where he was the chip leader for a time.  In the final hand of the heads up match against Dan Harrington, Goldfarb began with the best hand (Ace, 7 unsuited) to Harrington's (9, 8).  Harrington paired his eight on the flop and called Goldfarb's all-in, dodged the remaining aces thus winning the championship.\nGoldfarb's tournament winnings exceed $500,000.\nGoldfarb is married and is the father of three children.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.cardplayer.com/poker-players/24537-howard-goldfarb Card Player profile]\n* [http://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=r&n=94 Hendon Mob profile]\n*[https://www.worldpokertour.com/player/howard-goldfarb/ WPT profile]\n*[https://www.wsop.com/players/profile/?playerid=17441 WSOP profile]"
