The state legislature chose 19 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nDuring this election, New York split its 19 electoral votes among two Democratic-Republican candidates. 13 electoral votes went to Secretary of State James Madison while the remaining 6 went to incumbent Vice President George Clinton. Clinton was also supported by a group of New York Democratic-Republicans for president even though he had remained the party's official vice presidential candidate.\nThis would be the final election until 1972 in which New York did not have the largest number of electors in the Electoral College.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New York\nReferences"
