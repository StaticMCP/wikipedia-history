Mail-in ballots are accepted until March 30. 70 delegates to the Democratic National Convention were allocated to presidential candidates.\nPresident Biden won the primary in a landslide. \"Uncommitted\" won three delegates and received 36% of the vote in the city of St. Louis. A number of groups in the St. Louis area directly campaigned for Missouri Democrats to cast \"uncommitted\" ballots in protest of Biden's reaction to Israel's military invasion of Gaza.  Dean Phillips tied with Biden in Clark County.\nAdministration\nThe Missouri Democratic Party organized the 2024 statewide primary as a closed, ranked-choice firehouse presidential primary. The state-run presidential primary for all parties in Missouri had previously been abolished by the Missouri General Assembly in 2022, and a bill which would have reinstated it for 2024 was defeated in August 2023.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates achieved ballot access.\nState legislators\n*Crystal Quade, Minority Leader (2019–present) of the Missouri House of Representatives from the 132nd district (2017–present), candidate for Governor in 2024\nOrganizations\n*Missouri Democratic Party\n}}\n*Kansas City, St. Louis and Springfield Party for Socialism and Liberation branches\n*Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine\n}}\nResults\nSee also\n* 2024 Missouri Republican presidential caucuses\n* 2024 United States presidential election\n* 2024 United States elections\n* 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 United States presidential election in Missouri\nReferences"
