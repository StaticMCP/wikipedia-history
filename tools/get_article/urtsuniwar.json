The total number of speakers is estimated to be around 2,900–5,700 peoples.\nSimilarity\nIt has been debated whether Urtsuniwar is a distinct language or a dialect of Kalasha-mun. Urtsuniwar and Kalasha-mun exhibit 70% mutual intelligibility. Urtsuniwar also shares some similarities with the Ushojo.\nHistory\nThe Kafirs of Urtsun were among the last pagans in Afghanistan and Pakistan to convert to Islam in the mid-1900s. The last Urtsun Kafir was Mranzi, who had married a Kalasha from the Biriu valley and moved out of the valley in 1940, just as the conversion to Islam was completed. They renamed their language from Kalasha-mun to Urtsuniwar and later borrowed heavily from the Khowar, changing their identity. Subsequently, Urtsuniwar started to diverge into a distinct dialect of Kalasha-mun.\nReferences"
