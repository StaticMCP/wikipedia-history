These events are roughly divided into two periods: the first encompasses the gradual build-up over many decades of the numerous social, economic, and political issues that ultimately contributed to the war's outbreak, and the second encompasses the five-month span following the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States in 1860 and culminating in the capture of Fort Sumter in April 1861.\nScholars have identified many different causes for the war, but the most polarizing issue was whether the institution of slavery should be retained and even expanded to other territories or whether it should be contained, which would lead to its ultimate extinction. Since the early colonial period, slavery had played a major role in the socioeconomic system of British America and was widespread in the Thirteen Colonies at the time of the American Declaration of Independence in 1776. During and after the American Revolution, events and statements by politicians and others brought forth differences, tensions and divisions between citizens of the slave states of the Southern United States and citizens of the free states of the Northern United States (including several newly admitted Western states) over the topics of slavery. In the many decades between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, such divisions became increasingly irreconcilable and contentious.\nEvents in the 1850s culminated with the election of the anti-slavery Republican Abraham Lincoln as president on November 6, 1860. This provoked the first round of state secession as leaders of the cotton states of the Deep South were unwilling to remain in what they perceived as a second-class political status, with their way of life now threatened by the President himself. Initially, seven states seceded: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. After the Confederates attacked and captured Fort Sumter, President Lincoln called for volunteers to march south and suppress the rebellion. This pushed four other states in the Upper South (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas) also to secede, completing the incorporation of the Confederate States of America by July 1861. Their contributions of territory and soldiers to the Confederacy ensured, in retrospect, that the war would be prolonged and bloody.\nColonial period, 1607–1775\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"75%\" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1619\n|\n* A Dutch ship arrives in the Virginia Colony carrying about twenty black Africans as indentured servants. From this beginning, African slavery is introduced to the future United States.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1640\n|\n* The General Court of Virginia orders John Punch, a runaway black servant, to \"serve his master or his assigns for the time of his natural Life here or elsewhere.\" Thus, \"John Punch, a black man, was sentenced to [a] lifetime [of] slavery.\"\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1652\n|\n* After earlier laws in the Massachusetts Bay Colony (1641) and Connecticut Colony (1650) limit slavery to some extent, a 1652 law in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations clearly limits bond service to no more than 10 years or no later than a person attaining the age of 24. Nevertheless, Newport becomes a large slave trade center a century later.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1654\n|\n* John Casor of Northampton County is the first Virginian to be judicially confirmed as a slave for life other than for violation of the law.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1671\n|\n* About 2,000 of the 40,000 inhabitants of colonial Virginia are imported slaves. White indentured servants working for five years before their release are three times as numerous and provide much of the hard labor.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1712\n|\n* A slave insurrection in New York City causes significant property damage and results in severe punishment or execution of the rebels.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1719\n|\n* Non-slaveholding farmers in Virginia persuade the Virginia General Assembly to discuss a prohibition of slavery or a ban on importing slaves. In response, the assembly raises the tariff on slaves to five pounds, which about equals the full price of an indenture, so as not to make importation of slaves as initially attractive or preferable to a mere indenture for a term of years.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1739\n|\n* In South Carolina, the Stono Rebellion becomes the largest slave uprising yet in the Thirteen Colonies, with 25 white people and 35 to 50 black people killed.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1741\n|\n* Another insurrection of slaves in New York City causes significant property damage; slaves are severely punished or executed.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1774\n|\n* Quakers, led by James Pemberton and others including Benjamin Rush and Benjamin Franklin, organize the first abolitionist society in the colonies, the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery, in Philadelphia.\n|-\n|}\nAmerican Revolution and Confederation period, 1776–1787\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1776\n|\n* The United States Declaration of Independence declares \"that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" Slavery remains legal in the new nation. A clause condemning slavery is included in the Declaration but is removed at the insistence of South Carolina and Georgia.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1777\n|\n* The Republic of Vermont, an independent state at the time, prohibits slavery in its constitution.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1778\n|\n* The Virginia legislature passes a law, with Thomas Jefferson's support and probably authorship, that bans importing slaves into Virginia. It is the first state to ban the slave trade, and all other states eventually follow suit.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1779\n|\n* John Laurens attempts to convince the Continental Congress to allow slaves to join the Continental Army in return for freedom. The Congress gives him permission to do this, but opposition from the South Carolina legislature prevents it.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1780\n|\n* A gradual emancipation law is adopted in Pennsylvania.\n* Massachusetts bans slavery in its constitution.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1782\n|\n* Virginia liberalizes its very strict law preventing manumission; under the new law, a master may emancipate slaves in his will or by deed.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1783\n|\n* The New Hampshire Constitution says children will be born free, but some slavery persists until the 1840s.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1784\n|\n* Rhode Island and Connecticut pass laws providing for gradual emancipation of slaves.\n* The Continental Congress rejects by one vote Jefferson's proposal to prohibit slavery in all territories, including areas that become the states of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1786\n|\n* George Washington writes: \"There is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of it [slavery].\"  Civil War era historian William Blake says these \"sentiments were confined to a few liberal and enlightened men.\"\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1787\n|\n* July 13: Under the Articles of Confederation, the Continental Congress passes the Northwest Ordinance to govern the frontier territory north of the Ohio River and west of Pennsylvania, which includes the future states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Minnesota. In the ordinance, Congress prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude in the Northwest Territory and requires the return of fugitive slaves captured in the territory to their owners. The law no longer applies as soon as the territories become states. In the following years, anti-slavery Northerners cite the ordinance many times as precedent for the limitation, if not the abolition, of slavery in the United States. Despite the terms of the ordinance, Southern-born settlers try and fail to pass laws to allow slavery in Indiana and Illinois.\n|-\n|}\nEarly Constitutional period, 1787–1811\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1787\n|\n* The Constitutional Convention drafts the new United States Constitution with many compromises between supporters and opponents of slavery, including the Three-Fifths Compromise, which increases legislative representation in the House of Representatives and Electoral College by counting each slave as three-fifths of a person (Article I, Section 2). Additionally, the passage of any law that would prohibit the importation of slaves is forbidden for 20 years (Article I, Section 9) and the return of slaves who escape to free states is required (Article IV, Section 2).\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1789\n|\n* August 7: Congress re-adopts the Northwest Ordinance under the Constitution.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1790\n|\n* The total U.S. slave population according to the 1790 United States census is 697,681. The number will grow to nearly 4 million by 1860, 3.5 million of whom live in the seceding Southern states.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1791\n|\n* Vermont is admitted to the Union as a free state.\n* Kentucky is admitted to the Union by a joint resolution of Congress before the state has adopted a constitution.\n* Robert Carter III of Virginia gradually begins to free his 452 slaves. He will perform the largest manumission of slaves in U.S. history.\n* The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is passed, declaring that all powers not included in the Constitution are delegated to states.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1792\n|\n* Kentucky drafts a constitution permitting slavery and is admitted to the Union.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1793\n|\n* Congress passes the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, based on Article IV Section 2 of the Constitution and guaranteeing a slaveholder's right to recover an escaped slave.\n* Eli Whitney Jr. invents the cotton gin, making possible the profitable large-scale production of short-staple cotton in the South. The demand for slave labor increases with the resulting increase in cotton production.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1794\n|\n* In the Slave Trade Act of 1794 Congress prohibits ships from engaging in the international slave trade. By 1794, every existing state has banned the international slave trade (though South Carolina reopens it in 1803).\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1796\n|\n* Tennessee is admitted to the Union as a slave state.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1798\n|\n* The legislatures of Kentucky and Virginia pass the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which are anonymously written by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Most other states reject the Resolutions, which claim that the states can negate federal laws that go beyond the federal government's limited powers. In the second Kentucky resolution of November 1799, the Kentucky legislature says the remedy for an unconstitutional act is \"nullification\".\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1799\n|\n* New York enacts a law that gradually abolishes slavery. It declares children of slaves born after July 4, 1799, to be legally free, but the children have to serve an extended period of indentured servitude: to the age of 28 for males and to 25 for females. Slaves born before that date were redefined as indentured servants but essentially continued as slaves for life.\n* George Washington dies on December 14, 1799. His will frees the 124 slaves that he owns outright upon the death of his wife, Martha. They are freed by Martha in 1801, about 18 months before her death. Richard Allen, a black minister, calls on the nation's white leaders to follow Washington's lead.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1800\n|\n* The U.S. slave population according to the 1800 United States census is 893,605 (as corrected by late additions from Maryland and Tennessee).\n* The Gabriel Plot is led by Gabriel Prosser, a literate blacksmith slave. He plans to seize the Richmond, Virginia armory, then take control of the city, which would lead to freedom for himself and other slaves in the area. The plot is discovered before it can be carried out; Gabriel, along with 26 to 40 others, is executed.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1803\n|\n* The United States purchases the Louisiana Territory from France. Slavery already exists in the territory and efforts to restrict it fail; the new lands thereby permit a great expansion of slave plantations.\n* Ohio is admitted to the Union as a free state. Three hundred Blacks live there and the legislature tries to keep others out.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1804\n|\n* New Jersey enacts a law that provides for the gradual abolition of slavery. All states north of the Mason–Dixon line (the boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania) have now abolished or provided for the gradual abolition of slavery within their boundaries.\n* The American Convention of Abolition Societies meets without any societies from Southern states in attendance.\n* Haiti becomes the first independent country in the Americas made up of freed slaves after the conclusion of the Haitian Revolution. Following the revolution, under the orders of the radical general Jean-Jacques Dessalines, almost the entirety of the remaining white French population of Haiti is ethnically cleansed in the 1804 Haiti Massacre. As a result of these events, white supremacist sentiment was bolstered in the Antebellum South.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1805\n|\n* January: Slaves overpower and whip their overseer and assistants at Chatham Manor, near Fredericksburg, Virginia, in protest of shortened holidays. An armed posse of white men quickly gathers to capture the slaves, killing one slave in the attack. Two others die trying to escape and the posse deports two more, likely to slavery in the Caribbean.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1806\n|\n* Virginia repeals much of the 1782 law that had permitted more liberal emancipation of slaves, making emancipation much more difficult and expensive. Also, a statute permits a widow to revoke a manumission provision in her husband's will within one year of his death.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1807\n|\n* With the expiration of the 20-year ban on Congressional action on the subject, President Thomas Jefferson, a lifelong enemy of the slave trade, calls on Congress to criminalize the international slave trade, calling it \"violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of our country have long been eager to proscribe\". At Jefferson's urging, Congress outlaws the international slave trade in an Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, whereby importing or exporting slaves becomes a federal crime, effective January 1, 1808; in 1820 it is made the crime of piracy. Previously about 14,000 new foreign-born slaves had arrived in the U.S. each year. This number is dramatically reduced following the new law, but illegal smuggling continues to bring in about 1,000 new slaves per year. During the debates, Congressman John Randolph of Roanoke warns that outlawing the slave trade might become the \"pretext of universal emancipation\" and further warns that it would \"blow up the constitution\". If ever there should be disunion, he prophesies, the line would be drawn between the states that did and those that did not hold slaves.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1810\n|\n* The U.S. slave population according to the 1810 United States census is 27,510 slaves in the North and 1,191,364 in the South. The percentage of free blacks increases in the Upper South from less than one percent before the American Revolution to 10 percent by 1810. Three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware are free.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1811\n|\n* Slave Charles Deslondes leads a slave uprising in the Louisiana territory. Two white people are killed before the uprising is crushed, and 95 blacks are killed in retaliation.\n|-\n|}\n1812–1849\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1812\n|\n* April 30: Louisiana is admitted to the Union as a slave state.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1814\n|\n* The Hartford Convention, featuring delegates from Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island and others, discusses New England's opposition to the War of 1812 and trade embargoes. The convention report says that New England had a \"duty\" to assert its authority over unconstitutional infringements on its sovereignty, a position similar to the later nullification theory put forward by South Carolina. The war soon ends and the convention and the Federalist Party which had supported it fall out of favor, especially in the South, although leaders in Southern states later adopt the states' rights concept for their own purposes.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1816\n|\n* Henry Clay, James Monroe, Bushrod Washington, Robert Finley, Samuel John Mills Jr. and others organize the American Colonization Society to fund the migration of about 10,000 freed slaves to Liberia.\n* In Philadelphia, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first black denomination in the United States, is established by Richard Allen.\n* December 11: Indiana is admitted to the Union as a free state. The 1816 state constitution frees all the slaves within state lines.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1817\n|\n* December 10: Mississippi is admitted to the Union a slave state.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1818\n|\n* December 3: Illinois is admitted to the Union as a free state.\n* The Missouri Territory petitions Congress for admission to the Union as a slave state. Missouri's possible admission as a slave state threatens the balance of 11 free states and 11 slave states. Three years of debate ensue.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1819\n|\n* December 14: Alabama is admitted to the Union as a slave state.\n* Missouri again petitions for admission to the Union.\n* U.S. Representative James Tallmadge Jr. of New York submits an amendment to the legislation for the admission of Missouri which would prohibit further introduction of slaves into Missouri. The proposal would also free all children of slave parents in Missouri when they reached the age of 25. Representative Thomas W. Cobb of Georgia threatens disunion if Tallmadge persists in attempting to have his amendment enacted. The measure passes in the House of Representatives but is defeated in the Senate.\n* Southern Senators delay a bill to admit Maine as a free state in response to the delay of Missouri's admission as a slave state.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1820\n|\n* The U.S. slave population according to the 1820 United States census is 1,538,000.\n* Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky proposes the Missouri Compromise to break the Congressional deadlock over Missouri's admission to the Union. The compromise proposes that Missouri be admitted as a slave state and that the northern counties of Massachusetts, later the State of Maine, be admitted as a free state, thereby preserving the balance between slave and free states. The Missouri Compromise also includes a provision that prohibits slavery in all territory west of the Mississippi River and north of 36°30' latitude, with the exception of Missouri. Many Southerners argue against the exclusion of slavery from such a large area of the country, but the compromise passes nevertheless.\n* March 15: Maine is admitted to the Union as a free state.\n* The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church is founded in New York City.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1821\n|\n* August 10: Missouri is admitted to the Union as a slave state. Its legislature soon passes a law excluding free blacks and mulattoes from the state in violation of a Congressional condition to its admission.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1822\n|\n* The Vesey Plot causes fear among whites in South Carolina, who are convinced that Denmark Vesey and other slaves are planning a violent slave uprising in the Charleston area. The plot is discovered and Vesey and 34 of his presumed followers are seized and hanged.\n* Edward Coles, a former Virginia slaveholder who manumitted his slaves and became an anti-slavery advocate, narrowly defeats pro-slavery Joseph Philips, 33.16% to 31.22% in the 1822 Illinois gubernatorial election.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1824\n|\n* Congregationalist minister Charles Grandison Finney, a leader of the religious revivals of the Second Great Awakening, includes abolitionism among its social reforms.\n* Illinois voters reject a proposal for a new constitutional convention that could have made slavery legal outright, 6640 against to 4972 for.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1826\n|\n* New Jersey, later followed by Pennsylvania, passes the first personal liberty laws, which require a judicial hearing before an alleged fugitive slave can be removed from the state.\n* Thomas Cooper of South Carolina publishes On the Constitution, an early essay in favor of states' rights.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1827\n|\n* The process of gradual emancipation is completed in New York state and the last indentured servant is freed.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1828\n|\n* Congress passes the Tariff of 1828. It is called the \"Tariff of Abominations\" by its opponents in the cotton South.\n* The opposition of Southern cotton planters to transfer of federal funds in one state to another state for internal improvements and to protective tariffs to aid small Northern industries competing with foreign goods leads a South Carolina legislative committee to issue a report entitled South Carolina Exposition and Protest. The report outlines the nullification doctrine, which proposes to reserve to each state the right to nullify an act of Congress that injures perceived reserved state rights as unconstitutional and permit the state to prevent the law's enforcement within its borders. James Madison of Virginia calls the doctrine a \"preposterous and anarchical pretension.\" The report threatens secession of South Carolina over high tariff taxes. In 1831, Vice President John C. Calhoun admits he was the author of the previously unsigned South Carolina committee report.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1829\n|\n* David Walker, a freed slave from North Carolina living in Boston, publishes Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World, calling on slaves to revolt and destroy slavery.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1830\n|\n* The U.S. slave population according to the 1830 United States census is 2,009,043.\n* In North Carolina v. Mann, the Supreme Court of North Carolina rules that slave owners have absolute authority over their slaves and cannot be found guilty of committing violence against them.\n* Daniel Webster delivers a speech entitled Reply to Hayne. Webster condemns the proposition expressed by Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina that Americans must choose between liberty and union. Webster's closing words become an iconic statement of American nationalism: \"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!\"\n* The National Negro Convention, a black abolitionist and civil rights organization, is founded.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1831\n|\n* Abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison begins publishing The Liberator, a greatly influential publication. About this time, abolitionism takes a radical and religious turn. Many abolitionists begin to demand immediate emancipation of slaves.\n* August 21: Nat Turner leads a slave revolt in Southampton County, Virginia. At least 55 white persons are killed. Whites in turn kill about 100 blacks in the area in retaliation, during the search for Turner and his companions and in retaliation for their actions. Turner is captured several months later, after which he and 12 of his followers are executed. Turner's actions outrage Southerners and some suspect abolitionists supported him. The uprising leads to harsher laws against blacks in slaveholding states, making their education and assembly illegal.\n* Southern defenders of slavery start describing it as a \"positive good\", not just a \"necessary evil\".\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1832\n|\n* Congress enacts a new protective tariff, the Tariff of 1832, which offers South Carolina and the South little relief and provokes new controversy between the sections of the country.\n* John C. Calhoun further explains the nullification doctrine in an open letter to South Carolina Governor James Hamilton Jr., arguing that the Constitution only raises the federal government to the level of the state, not above it. He argues that nullification is not secession and does not require secession to take effect.\n* Thomas R. Dew writes Review of the Debate in the Virginia Legislature of 1831 and 1832, a strong defense of slavery and attack on colonization in Africa by freed slaves.\n* November 19: South Carolina calls a state convention, which passes an Ordinance of Nullification with an effective date of February 1, 1833. The convention declares the tariff void because it threatens the state's essential interests. The South Carolina legislature acts to enforce the ordinance.\n* President Andrew Jackson, a Southerner and slave owner, calls nullification \"rebellious treason\" and threatens to use force against possible secessionist action in South Carolina caused by the Nullification Crisis. Congress passes the \"Force Bill\", which permits the President to use the Army and Navy to enforce the law. Jackson also urges Congress to modify the tariff, which they soon do.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1833\n|\n* The Compromise Tariff of 1833 proposed by Henry Clay ends the Nullification Crisis by lowering some tariff rates. No other states support South Carolina's argument and position and, after Clay's compromise legislation passes, South Carolina withdraws its resolution.\n* The abolitionist American Anti-Slavery Society is founded in Philadelphia. The movement soon splits into five factions that do not always agree but which continue to advocate abolition in their own ways.\n* Abolitionist Lydia Maria Child of Massachusetts publishes An Appeal in Favor of That Class of Americans Called Africans. Wendell Phillips and Charles Sumner are persuaded to become abolitionists.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1834\n|\n* Anti-slavery \"debates\" are held at Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio. Lane had been founded by abolitionist evangelist and writer Theodore Weld with financial help from abolitionist merchants and philanthropists Arthur Tappan and Lewis Tappan.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1835\n|\n* May 26: The U.S. House of Representatives passes the Pinckney Resolutions. The first two resolutions state that Congress has no constitutional authority to interfere with slavery in the states and that it \"ought not\" to do so in the District of Columbia. The third resolution, from the outset known as the \"gag rule\", says: \"All petitions, memorials, resolutions, propositions, or papers, relating in any way, or to any extent whatsoever, to the subject of slavery or the abolition of slavery, shall, without being either printed or referred, be laid on the table and that no further action whatever shall be had thereon.\" Massachusetts representative and former President John Quincy Adams leads an eight-year battle against the gag rule. He argues that the Slave Power, as a political interest, threatens constitutional rights.\n* A Georgia law prescribes the death penalty for publication of material with the intention of provoking a slave rebellion.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1836\n|\n* The Republic of Texas declares and wins its independence from Mexico in the Texas Revolution.\n* June 15: Arkansas is admitted to the Union as a slave state.\n* Committed abolitionists Angelina Grimké Weld and her sister Sarah Grimké who were born in Charleston, South Carolina, move to Philadelphia because of their anti-slavery philosophy and Quaker faith. In 1836, Angelina publishes \"An Appeal to the Christian Women of the South\", inviting them to overthrow slavery, which she declares is a horrible system of oppression and cruelty.\n* Democratic Party nominee Martin Van Buren, a New Yorker with Southern sympathies, wins the 1836 presidential election.\n* Lynching of Francis McIntosh, a free man of color, who had fatally stabbed one police officer. He was attacked by an angry mob, chained to a locust tree and burned alive without a trial in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 28, 1836. In a speech in January 1838, Abraham Lincoln called McIntosh's lynching \"revolting to humanity\".\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1837\n|\n* In Alton, Illinois, a mob kills abolitionist and anti-slavery editor Elijah P. Lovejoy, whose newspaper angered Southerners and Irish Catholics.\n* January 26: Michigan is admitted to the Union as a free state.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1838\n|\n* Pennsylvania Hall (Philadelphia), built by the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, was destroyed by arson three days after it opened.\n* Kentucky Congressman William J. Graves kills Maine Congressman Jonathan Cilley in a duel.\n* Anti-slavery societies claim to have 250,000 members.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1839\n|\n* Slaves revolt on the Spanish ship La Amistad and attempt to return it to Africa, but the ship ends up in the U.S. After a highly publicized Supreme Court case argued by John Quincy Adams, the slaves are freed in March 1841, and most return to Africa.\n* Influential abolitionist Theodore Weld, assisted by his new wife Angelina Grimké and her sister Sarah, exposes the reality of American slavery in American Slavery As It Is. He uses as evidence the slave owners' own words, as found in Southern newspaper advertisements and articles seeking the recapture of fugitives.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1840\n|\n* The U.S. slave population according to the 1840 United States census is 2,487,000.\n* The abolitionist Liberty Party nominates James G. Birney of Kentucky for President.\n*William Henry Harrison wins the 1840 Presidential election.\n*Arthur Tappan and Lewis Tappan organize the American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1841\n|\n* The last lifetime indentured servant in New York is freed.\n* William Henry Harrison dies in office after 31 days of becoming president, and his VP, John Tyler, takes over.\n*Slaves being moved from Virginia to Louisiana seize the brig Creole and land in the Bahamas, which as a British colony had already abolished slavery. The British give asylum to 111 slaves (giving the 19 ringleaders accused of murder their freedom once the case is decided in court). The U.S. government protests and in 1855 the British paid $119,000 to the original owners of the slaves.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1842\n|\n* In Prigg v. Pennsylvania, the U.S. Supreme Court declares the Pennsylvania personal liberty law unconstitutional as in conflict with federal fugitive slave law. The Court holds that enforcement of the fugitive slave law is the responsibility of the federal government.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1843\n|\n* Massachusetts and eight other states pass personal liberty laws under which state officials are forbidden to assist in the capture of fugitive slaves.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1844\n|\n* The Methodist Episcopal Church, South breaks away from the Methodist Episcopal Church on the issue of slavery.\n* Well-known black abolitionist, Charles Lenox Remond, and famous white abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, declare they would rather see the union dissolved than keep the Constitution only through the retention of slavery.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1845\n|\n* March 3: Florida is admitted to the Union as a slave state.\n* The Southern Baptist Convention breaks from the Northern Baptists but does not formally endorse slavery.\n* Frederick Douglass publishes his first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written by Himself. The book details his life as a slave.\n* Former U.S. Representative and Governor of South Carolina and future U.S. Senator James Henry Hammond writes Two Letters on Slavery in the United States, Addressed to Thomas Clarkson, Esq., in which he expresses the view that slavery is a \"positive good.\"\n* Anti-slavery advocates denounce Texas Annexation as evil expansion of slave territory. Whigs defeat an annexation treaty but Congress annexes Texas to the United States as a slave state by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress on a joint resolution without ratification of a treaty by a two-thirds vote in the U.S. Senate.\n*December 29: Texas is admitted to the Union as a slave state.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1846\n|\n* The Walker Tariff reduction leads to a period of free trade until 1860. Republicans (and Pennsylvania Democrats) attack the low level of the tariff rates.\n* James D.B. DeBow establishes ''DeBow's Review, the leading Southern magazine, which becomes an ardent advocate of secession. DeBow warns against depending on the North economically.\n* The Mexican–American War begins. The administration of President James K. Polk had deployed the Army to disputed Texas territory and Mexican forces attacked it. Whigs denounce the war. Antislavery critics charge the war is a pretext for gaining more slave territory. The U.S. Army quickly captures New Mexico.\n* Northern representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives pass the Wilmot Proviso which would prevent slavery in territory captured from Mexico. Southern Senators block passage of the proviso into law in the U. S. Senate. The Wilmot Proviso never becomes law but it does substantially increase friction between the North and South. Congress also rejects a proposal to extend the Missouri Compromise line to the west coast and other compromise proposals.\n* December 28: Iowa is admitted to the Union as a free state.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1847\n|\n* The Massachusetts legislature resolves that the \"unconstitutional\" Mexican–American War was being waged for \"the triple object of extending slavery, of strengthening the slave power, and of obtaining control of the free states\".\n* John C. Calhoun asserts that slavery is legal in all of the territories, foreshadowing the U.S. Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision in 1857.\n* Democrat Lewis Cass of Michigan proposes letting the people of a territory vote on whether to permit slavery in the territory. This theory of popular sovereignty would be further endorsed and advocated by Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois in the mid-1850s.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1848\n|\n* The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo confirms the Texas border with Mexico and U.S. possession of California and the New Mexico territory. The U.S. Senate rejects attempts to attach the Wilmot Proviso during the ratification vote on the treaty.\n* Radical New York Democrats and anti-slavery Whigs form the Free-Soil party. The party names former President Martin Van Buren as its presidential candidate and demands enactment of the Wilmot Proviso. The party argues that rich planters will squeeze out small white farmers and buy their land. The Whig Party candidate, General Zachary Taylor, who owned slaves, wins the United States Presidential Election of 1848. Taylor expresses no view on slavery in the Southwest during campaign. After the election, he reveals a plan to admit California and New Mexico to the Union as free states covering the entire Southwest, and to exclude slavery from any territories. Taylor warns the South that he will meet rebellion with force. His moderate views on the expansion of slavery and the acceptability of the Wilmot Proviso angered his unsuspecting Southern supporters but did not fully satisfy Northerners who wanted to limit or abolish slavery.\n* May 29: Wisconsin is admitted to the Union as a free state.\n* The Oregon Treaty between the United States and Great Britain ends the Oregon boundary dispute, defines the final western segment of the Canada–United States border and ends the scare of a war between the U.S. and Great Britain. Northern Democrats complain that the Polk administration backed down on the demand that the northern boundary of Oregon be set at 54°40' latitude and sacrificed Northern expansion while supporting Southern expansion through the Mexican–American War and the treaty ending that war.\n* The Polk administration offers Spain $100 million for Cuba. Spain rejects the offer.\n* Southerners support Narciso López's attempt to cause an uprising in Cuba in favor of American annexation of the island, which allows slavery. López is defeated and flees to the United States. He is tried for violation of neutrality laws but a New Orleans jury fails to convict him.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1849\n|\n* The California Gold Rush quickly populates Northern California with Northern-born and immigrant settlers who outnumber Southern-born settlers. California's constitutional convention unanimously rejects slavery and petitions to join the Union as a free state without first being organized as a territory. President Zachary Taylor asks Congress to admit California as a free state, saying he will suppress secession if it is attempted by any dissenting states.\n* Harriet Tubman escapes from slavery. She makes about 20 trips to the South and returns along the Underground Railroad with slaves seeking freedom.\n|-\n|}\nCompromise of 1850 to the Election of 1860\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1850\n|\n* The U.S. slave population according to the 1850 United States census is 3,204,313.\n* March 11: U.S. Senator William H. Seward of New York delivers his \"Higher Law\" address. He states that a compromise on slavery is wrong because under a higher law than the Constitution, the law of God, all men are free and equal.\n* April 17: U.S. Senator Henry S. Foote of Mississippi pulls a pistol on anti-slavery Senator Benton on the floor of the Senate.\n* President Taylor dies on July 9 and is succeeded by Vice President Millard Fillmore. Although he is a New Yorker, Fillmore is more inclined to compromise with or even support Southern interests.\n* Henry Clay proposes the Compromise of 1850 to handle California's petition for admission to the union as a free state and Texas's demand for land in New Mexico. Clay proposes (1) admission of California as a free state, (2) prohibition of Texas expansion into New Mexico, (3) compensation of $10 million to Texas to finance its public debt, (4) permission to citizens of New Mexico and Utah to vote on whether slavery would be allowed in their territories via popular sovereignty, (5) a ban of the slave trade in the District of Columbia, though slavery would still be allowed in the district, and (6) a stronger fugitive slave law with more vigorous enforcement.\n* Under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, a slave owner could reclaim a runaway slave by establishing ownership before a commissioner rather than in a jury trial, and imposed harsh penalties to anyone who aided runaway slaves. Clay's initial omnibus bill that included all these provisions failed. Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois then established different coalitions that passed each provision separately.\n* Responses to the Compromise of 1850 varied. Southerners cease movement toward disunion but are angered by Northern resistance to enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. Anti-slavery forces are upset about possible expansion of slavery in the Southwest and the stronger fugitive slave law that could require all U.S. citizens to assist in returning fugitive slaves.\n* The Nashville Convention of nine Southern states discusses states' rights and slavery in June; in November, the convention talks about secession but adjourns due to the passage of the laws that constitute the Compromise of 1850.\n* The Utah Territory is organized and adopts a slave code. Only 29 enslaved black Americans are found in the territory in 1860 although several hundred Native Americans were enslaved in the territory as well.\n* October: The Boston Vigilance Committee frees two fugitive slaves, Ellen and William Craft, from jail and prevents them from being returned to Georgia.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1851\n|\n* Southern Unionists in several states defeat secession measures. Mississippi's convention denies the existence of the right to secession.\n* February: a crowd of black men in Boston frees fugitive slave Shadrach Minkins, also known as Fred Wilkins, who was being held in the federal courthouse, and helps him escape to Canada.\n* April: The federal government guards fugitive slave Thomas Sims with 300 soldiers to prevent local sympathizers from helping him with an escape attempt.\n* September: Free blacks confront a slave owner, his son and their official posse who are trying to capture two fugitive slaves near Christiana, Pennsylvania. In the fight that follows, the slave owner is killed while his son is seriously wounded.  The subsequent trial for treason of one of the white onlookers also stoked passions.\n* October: Black and white abolitionists free fugitive slave Jerry McHenry from the Syracuse, New York jail and aid his escape to Canada.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1852\n|\n* In Lemmon v. New York, a New York court frees eight slaves in transit from Virginia with their owner.\n* In the Act in Relation to Service, the Utah Territory legalizes slavery in March 1852.\n* After magazine publication, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe is published in book form. The powerful novel depicts slave owner \"Simon Legree\" as deeply evil, and the slave \"Uncle Tom\" as the Christ-like hero. It sells between 500,000 and 1,000,000 copies in U.S. and even more in Great Britain. Millions of people see the stage adaptation. By June 1852, Southerners move to suppress the book's publication in the South and numerous \"refutations\" appear in print.\n* April 30: A convention called by the legislature in South Carolina adopts \"An Ordinance to Declare the Right of this State to Secede from the Federal Union\".\n* The Whig party and its candidate for president, Army general Winfield Scott, are decisively defeated in the election and the party quickly fades away.  Pro-South (\"doughface\") Democrat Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire is elected president.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1853\n|\n* Democrats control state governments in all the states which will form the Confederate States of America.\n* The United States adds a  region of present-day southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico to the United States through the Gadsden Purchase of territory from Mexico. The purposes of the Gadsden Purchase are the construction of a transcontinental railroad along a deep southern route and the reconciliation of outstanding border issues following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican–American War. Many early settlers in the region are pro-slavery.\n* Filibusterer William Walker and a few dozen men briefly take over Baja California in an effort to expand slave territory. When they are forced to retreat to California and put on trial for violating neutrality laws, they are acquitted by a jury that deliberated for only eight minutes.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1854\n|\n* Democratic U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois proposes the Kansas–Nebraska Bill to open good Midwestern farmland to settlement and to encourage building of a transcontinental railroad with a terminus at Chicago. Whether slavery would be permitted in a territory would be determined by a vote of the people at the time a territory is organized.\n* Congress enacts the Kansas–Nebraska Act, providing that popular sovereignty, a vote of the people when a territory is organized, will decide \"all questions pertaining to slavery\" in the Kansas–Nebraska territories. This abrogates the Missouri Compromise prohibition of slavery north of the 36°30' line of latitude and increases Northerners' fears of a Slave Power encroaching on the North. Both Northerners and Southerners rush to the Kansas and Nebraska territories to sway the vote. Violence known as Bleeding Kansas erupts in the ensuing months, between the pro- and anti-slavery settlers, that leaves hundreds dead.\n* Opponents of slavery and the Kansas–Nebraska Act meet in Ripon, Wisconsin on March 20, and subsequently meet in other Northern states, to form the Republican Party. The party includes many former members of the Whig and Free Soil parties and some northern Democrats. Republicans win most of the Northern state seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in the fall 1854 elections as 66 of 91 Northern state Democrats are defeated. Abraham Lincoln emerges as a Republican leader in the West (Illinois).\n* Eli Thayer forms the New England Emigrant Aid Society to encourage settlement of Kansas by persons opposed to slavery.\n* Bitter fighting breaks out in Kansas Territory as pro-slavery men win a majority of seats in the legislature, expel anti-slavery legislators and adopt the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for the proposed state of Kansas.\n* The Ostend Manifesto, a dispatch sent from France by the U.S. ministers to Britain, France and Spain after a meeting in Ostend, Belgium, describes the rationale for the United States to purchase Cuba (a territory which had slavery) from Spain and implies the U.S. should declare war if Spain refuses to sell the island. Four months after the dispatch is drafted, it is published in full at the request of the U.S. House of Representatives. Northern states view the document as a Southern attempt to extend slavery. European nations consider it as a threat to Spain and to imperial power. The U.S. government never acts upon the recommendations in the Ostend Manifesto.\n* Anthony Burns, a fugitive slave from Virginia, is arrested by federal agents in Boston. Radical abolitionists attack the courthouse and kill a deputy marshal in an unsuccessful attempt to free Burns.\n* Abolitionist editor Sherman Booth was arrested for violating the Fugitive Slave Act when he helped incite a mob to rescue an escaped slave, Joshua Glover, in Wisconsin from U.S. Marshal Stephen V. R. Ableman.\n* The Knights of the Golden Circle, a fraternal organization that wants to expand slavery to Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean Islands, including Cuba, and northern South America, is founded in Louisville, Kentucky.\n* Former Mississippi Governor John A. Quitman begins to raise money and volunteers to invade Cuba, but is slow to act and cancels the invasion plan in spring 1855 when President Pierce says he would enforce the neutrality laws.\n* The Know-Nothing Party or American Party, which includes many nativist former Whigs, sweeps state and local elections in parts of some Northern states. The party demands ethnic purification, opposes Catholics (because of the presumed power of the Pope over them), and opposes corruption in local politics. The party soon fades away.\n* George Fitzhugh's pro-slavery Sociology for the South is published.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1855\n|\n* Over 95 percent of the pro-slavery votes in the election of a Kansas territorial legislature in 1855 are later determined to be fraudulent.\n* Anti-slavery Kansans draft the Topeka Constitution and elect a new legislature that actually represents the majority of legal voters. Kansas now has two constitutions, one pro- and one anti-slavery, and two different governments in two different cities, each claiming to be the legitimate government of Kansas.\n* July 18: Jane Johnson, a slave belonging to US Minister to Nicaragua John Hill Wheeler, is rescued by abolitionists William Still and Passmore Williamson. Wheeler later brings an unsuccessful prosecution against Still for assault and kidnapping.\n* Congress convenes in December with the anti-slavery Opposition Party as the largest party in the House of Representatives. Bitterly divided along sectional lines over slavery, the House requires eight weeks (133 ballots) to choose a speaker.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1856\n|\n* May 21: Missouri Ruffians and local pro-slavery men sack and burn the town of Lawrence, Kansas, an anti-slavery stronghold.\n* John Brown, an abolitionist born in Connecticut, and his sons kill five pro-slavery men from Pottawatomie Creek in Kansas retaliation for the sacking of Lawrence.\n* May 22: Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina beats with a cane and incapacitates Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts on the floor of the U.S. Senate. In a speech in the Senate chamber, The Crime Against Kansas, Sumner ridicules slaveowners—especially Brooks's cousin, U.S. Senator Andrew Butler of South Carolina—as in love with a prostitute (slavery) and raping the virgin Kansas. Brooks is a hero in the South, Sumner a martyr in the North.\n* In the 1856 U.S. presidential election, Republican John C. Frémont crusades against slavery. The Republican slogan is \"Free speech, free press, free soil, free men, Frémont and victory!\" Democrats counter that Fremont's election could lead to civil war. The Democratic Party candidate, James Buchanan, who carries five northern and western states and all the southern states except Maryland, wins.\n* Thomas Prentice Kettell, a New York Democrat, writes Southern Wealth and Northern Profits, a lengthy statistical pamphlet about the economies of the Northern and Southern regions of the country. The book receives wide acclaim among secessionists in the South and much derision from anti-slavery politicians in the North, even though some historians think Kettell intended it as an argument that the two regions are economically dependent upon each other.\n* Filibuster William Walker, in alliance with local rebels, overthrows the government of Nicaragua and proclaims himself president. He decrees the reintroduction of slavery. Many of Walker's men succumb to cholera and he and his remaining men are rescued by the U.S. Navy in May 1857.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1857\n|\n* George Fitzhugh publishes Cannibals All! Or Slaves Without Masters, which defends chattel slavery and ridicules free labor as wage slavery.\n* Commercial conventions in the South call for the reopening of the African slave trade, thinking that a ready access to inexpensive slaves would spread slavery to the territories.\n* Hinton Rowan Helper, a North Carolinian, publishes The Impending Crisis of the South, which argues that slavery was the main cause of the South's economic stagnation. This charge angers many Southerners.\n* March 6: The U.S. Supreme Court reaches the Dred Scott v. Sandford decision, a 7 to 2 ruling that Congress lacks the power to exclude slavery from the territories, that slaves are property and have no rights as citizens and that slaves are not made free by living in free territory. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney concludes that the Missouri Compromise is unconstitutional. If a court majority clearly agreed (which it did not in this decision), this conclusion wand would allow all territories to be open to slavery. Scott and his family were purchased and freed by a supporter's children. Northerners vowed to oppose the decision as in violation of a \"higher law\". Antagonism between the sections of the country increases. The ruling is seen by many historians as the worst Supreme Court decision of the era.\n* Anti-slavery supporters in Kansas ignore a June election to a constitutional convention because less populous pro-slavery counties were given a majority of delegates. The convention adopts the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution. Meanwhile, anti-slavery representatives win control of the state legislature.\n* August: The Panic of 1857 arises, mainly in large northern cities, as a result of speculation in, and inflated values of, railroad stocks and real estate. Southerners tout the small effect in their section as support for their economic and labor system.\n* Buchanan endorses the Lecompton constitution and breaks with Douglas, who regards the document as a mockery of popular sovereignty because its referendum provision does not offer a true free state option. A bitter feud begins inside the Democratic party. Douglas's opposition to the Lecompton constitution erodes his support from pro-slavery factions.\n* The Tariff of 1857, authored primarily by R. M. T. Hunter of Virginia, uses the Walker Tariff as a base and lowers rates.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1858\n|\n* May 11: Minnesota is admitted to the Union as a free state.\n* February: A fistfight among thirty Congressmen divided along sectional lines takes place on the floor of Congress during an all-night debate on the Lecompton constitution.\n* The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the pro-slavery Lecompton constitution for Kansas on April 1.\n* Congress passes the English Bill, proposed by Representative William Hayden English of Indiana, which sends the Lecompton constitution back to the voters of Kansas.\n* May 19: Pro-slavery Missourians capture 11 free-staters in Kansas, then attempt to execute them in the Marais des Cygnes Massacre. Five are killed and five wounded.\n* June 16: Lincoln gives his \"House Divided\" speech, stating \"a house divided against itself cannot stand.\"\n* August 2: Kansas voters reject the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution.\n* The New School Presbyterians split as the New Schoolers in the South who support slavery split and form the United Synod of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. In 1861, the Old School church splits along North–South lines.\n* The Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858 focus on issues and arguments that will dominate the Presidential election campaign of 1860. Pro-Douglas candidates win a small majority in the Illinois legislature in the general election and choose Douglas as U.S. Senator from Illinois for another term. However, Lincoln emerges as a nationally known moderate spokesman for Republicans and a moderate opponent of slavery.\n* In a debate with Lincoln at Freeport, Illinois, Douglas expresses an opinion which becomes known as the \"Freeport Doctrine\". Lincoln asks whether the people of a territory could lawfully exclude slavery before the territory became a state. In effect, this question asks Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Dred Scott decision. Douglas says they could do so by refusing to pass the type of police regulations needed to sustain slavery. This answer further alienates pro-slavery advocates from Douglas.\n* Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina proclaims: \"No, you dare not make war on cotton. No power on earth dares to make war upon it. Cotton is King; until lately the Bank of England was king; but she tried to put her screws, as usual...on the cotton crop, and was utterly vanquished\", which argues that even Europe is dependent on the cotton economy of the Southern states and would have to intervene in any U.S. conflict, even an internal threat, to protect its vital source of raw material, King Cotton.\n* William Lowndes Yancey and Edmund Ruffin found the League of United Southerners. They advocate reopening the African slave trade and the formation of a Southern confederacy.\n* U.S. Senator William H. Seward says there is an \"irrepressible conflict\" between slavery and freedom.\n* Although solid evidence of their guilt is presented, the crew of the illegal slave ship The Wanderer is acquitted of engaging in the African slave trade by a Savannah, Georgia jury. Similarly, a Charleston, South Carolina jury acquits the crew of The Echo, another illegal slave ship which is caught with 320 Africans on board.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1859\n|\n* Southerners block an increase in the low tariff rates of 1857.\n* February: U.S. Senator Albert G. Brown of Mississippi says that if a territory requires a slave code in line with Douglas' Freeport Doctrine, the federal government must pass a slave code to protect slavery in the territories. If it does not, Brown says he will urge Mississippi to secede from the Union.\n* February 14: Oregon is admitted to the Union as a free state, but prohibits the residency of any person of African origin, slave or free.\n* In Ableman v. Booth, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law is constitutional and that state courts cannot overrule federal court decisions.\n* President Buchanan and Southern members of Congress, including Senator John Slidell of Louisiana, make another attempt to buy Cuba from Spain. Douglas supports the proposed annexation of Cuba. Republicans block funding.\n* Southern senators block a homestead act that would have given settlers in the West each 160 acres of land.\n* The Southern Commercial Convention endorses reopening the African slave trade to reduce the price of slaves and widen slaveholding. Many members think this would lessen feelings that the slave trade was immoral and provide an incentive or tool for Southern nationalism.\n* September 13: Pro-slavery David S. Terry fatally shoots abolitionist David C. Broderick in a duel over Terry's offensive remarks relating to Broderick's opposition to the Lecompton Constitution. Broderick is seen as a martyr to the cause of abolitionism.\n* October 4: Kansas voters adopt the anti-slavery Wyandotte Constitution by a 2-to-1 margin.\n* October 16: Kansas abolitionist John Brown attempts to spark a slave rebellion in Virginia through seizure of weapons from the federal armory at Harpers Ferry. Brown holds the arsenal for 36 hours. No slaves join him and no rebellion ensues but 17 persons, including 10 of Brown's men, are killed. Brown and his remaining men are captured by U.S. Marines led by Army Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee. Brown is tried for treason to the state of Virginia, murder, and inciting a slave insurrection. He was found guilty of all charges.\n* November 2: John Brown is sentenced and delivers his famous \"last speech\".\n* The New Mexico Territory adopts a slave code, but no slaves are in the territory according to the 1860 census.\n* December 2: John Brown is hanged, in Charles Town, Virginia (now West Virginia). Across the North it is treated as a national calamity; church bells are rung, rallies held, speeches and sermons given. Brown is seen as a martyr to the cause of ending slavery. Brown is seen in the South as a fanatical Yankee abolitionist trying to start a bloody race war, as well as stealing their property (the enslaved). The reaction in the North to his execution reinforces the Southern fear that more such raids would soon be coming. Secession, for which support had grown steadily since the Nullification Crisis of 1832–33, is believed by Southern leaders to be their only option.\n* Members of the Congress that convenes in December insult, level charges at, threaten, and denounce each other. Members come to the sessions armed. The House of Representatives requires eight weeks (44 ballots) to choose a speaker. This delays consideration of vitally important business.\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1860\n|\n* The U.S. slave population according to the 1860 United States census is 3,954,174. The census also concludes that the total U.S. population has increased from 23,191,875 to 31,443,321 since the 1850 Census, an increase of 35.4 percent; 26 percent of all Northerners but only 10 percent of Southerners live in towns or cities; and that 80 percent of the Southern workforce but only 40 percent of the Northern workforce is employed in agriculture.\n* Southern opposition kills the Pacific Railway Bill of 1860. President James Buchanan vetoes a homestead act.\n* February: U.S. Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi presents a resolution stating the Southern position on slavery, including adoption of a Federal slave code for the territories.\n* February 27: Abraham Lincoln gives his Cooper Union speech against the spread of slavery.\n* The Knights of the Golden Circle reach maximum popularity and plan to invade Mexico to expand slave territory.\n* April 23 – May 3: The Democratic Party convention begins in Charleston, South Carolina. Southern radicals, or \"fire-eaters\", oppose front-runner Stephen A. Douglas' bid for the party's presidential nomination. The Democrats begin splitting North and South as many Southern delegates walk out. Douglas cannot secure the two-thirds of the vote needed for the nomination. After 57 ballots, the convention adjourns to meet in Baltimore six weeks later.\n* May 9: Former Whigs from the border states form the Constitutional Union Party and nominate former U.S. Senator John C. Bell of Tennessee for President and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for Vice President on a one-issue platform of national unity.\n* May 16: William H. Seward of New York, Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, and Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania are leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, along with the more moderate Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, when the Republican convention convenes in Chicago. Lincoln supporters from Illinois skillfully gain commitments for Lincoln. On May 18, Abraham Lincoln wins the Republican Party nomination for president, with Hannibal Hamlin of Maine as his running mate. The Republicans adopt a concrete, precise, and moderately worded platform which includes the exclusion of slavery from the territories but the affirmation of the right of states to order and control their own \"domestic institutions\".\n* June 18: The main group of Democrats meeting in Baltimore, bolstered by some new Douglas Democrats from Southern states who are seated to the exclusion of the Southern delegates from the previous session of the convention, nominate Douglas for President.\n* June 28: Southern Democrats nominate Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for President. Their platform endorses a national slave code.\n* Honduran militia stop another filibuster effort by William Walker. They capture and execute him before a firing squad on September 12, 1860.\n|-\n|}\nElection of 1860 to the Battle of Fort Sumter\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n|-\n|valign=center align=right|1860\n|\n* November 6: Abraham Lincoln wins the 1860 presidential election on a platform that includes the prohibition of slavery in new states and territories. Lincoln wins all of the electoral votes in all of the free states except New Jersey, where he wins 4 votes and Stephen A. Douglas wins 3. The official count of electoral votes occurs February 13, 1861.\n* November 7: Charleston, South Carolina authorities arrest a Federal officer who had attempted to move supplies to Fort Moultrie from Charleston Arsenal. Two days later, the Palmetto Flag of South Carolina is raised over the Charleston harbor batteries.\n* November 9: A false report that U.S. Senator Robert Toombs of Georgia has resigned reaches Columbia, South Carolina.\n* November 10: The South Carolina legislature calls for an election on December 6 for delegates to a convention for December 17 to consider whether the State should secede from the Union. U.S. Senators James Chesnut Jr. and James Henry Hammond of South Carolina resign from the U.S. Senate.\n* November 14:\n** Congressman Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, later Vice President of the Confederate States of America, speaks to the Georgia legislature in opposition to secession.\n** The Governor of Alabama says he will call for an election on December 6 or December 24 for delegates to a convention to meet on January 7 to consider whether the State should secede from the Union.\n** The Governor of Mississippi calls for an extraordinary session of the legislature on November 26. On November 29, the legislature votes for an election on December 29 for delegates to a convention to meet on January 7 to consider whether the State should secede from the Union.\n* November 15:\n** Major Robert Anderson of the First United States Artillery, a 55-year-old career army officer from Kentucky, was ordered to take command of Fort Moultrie and the defenses in Charleston Harbor, including Fort Sumter.\n** United States Navy Lieutenant Tunis Craven informs authorities in Washington, D.C. that he is proceeding to take moves to protect Fort Taylor at Key West, Florida and Fort Jefferson on the Dry Tortugas, Florida.

The U.S. House of Representatives appoints a Committee of Thirty-Three to consider \"the present perilous condition of the country\".\n* December 8, 1860 – January 8, 1861: Buchanan administration cabinet members from the South resign. Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb of Georgia resigns on December 8. On December 23, President Buchanan asks for the resignation of Secretary of War John B. Floyd, a former governor of Virginia, whose actions appear to favor the Southern secessionists. He arranged to shift weapons from Pittsburgh and other locations to the South. Floyd resigns on December 29. The War Department stops the transfer of weapons from Pittsburgh on January 3. United States Secretary of the Interior Jacob Thompson of Mississippi resigns on January 8, 1861.\n* December 10: South Carolina delegates meet with Buchanan and believe he agrees not to change the military situation at Charleston.\n* December 11: Major Don Carlos Buell delivers a message to Major Anderson from Secretary of War Floyd. Anderson is authorized to put his command in any of the forts at Charleston to resist their seizure. Later in the month Floyd says Anderson violated the President's pledge to keep the status quo pending further discussions and the garrison should be removed from Charleston. Floyd soon will join the Confederacy.\n* December 12: Secretary of State Lewis Cass of Michigan resigns. He believes President Buchanan should reinforce the Charleston forts and is unhappy about Buchanan's lack of action.\n* December 17, 20, 24: The South Carolina Secession Convention begins on December 17. On December 20, secession begins when the convention declares \"that the Union now subsisting between South Carolina and other states under the name of the 'United States of America' is hereby dissolved\". The convention published a Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union in explanation and support of their position. The document cites \"encroachments on the reserved rights of the states\" and \"an increasing hostility of the non-slaveholding states to the institution of slavery\" and \"the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery\" as among the causes. On December 24, South Carolina Governor Francis Wilkinson Pickens declares the act of secession in effect.\n* December 18, 1860 – January 15, 1861: Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky proposes the \"Crittenden Compromise\". Its main features are a constitutional amendment that would reinstate the Missouri Compromise line between free and slave territory and retention of the fugitive slave law and slavery where it existed, including in the District of Columbia. On January 16, 1861, the Crittenden Compromise is effectively defeated in the United States Senate.\n* December 20: Vice President John C. Breckenridge of Kentucky, unsuccessful candidate of the Southern Democrats for President and later Confederate general and Confederate Secretary of War, appoints a Committee of Thirteen U.S. Senators of differing views, including Jefferson Davis, Robert Toombs, William Seward, and Stephen A. Douglas, to consider the state of the nation and to propose solutions to the crisis. On December 31, the Committee reports they are unable to agree on a compromise proposal.\n* December 21, 24: The four United States Congressmen from South Carolina withdraw from the U.S. House of Representatives, but on December 24 the House refuses their resignations.\n* December 26–27, 30: Under cover of darkness, Major Anderson moves the Federal garrison at Charleston, South Carolina from Fort Moultrie, which is indefensible from the landward side, to the unfinished Fort Sumter, which is located on an island in Charleston harbor. He spikes the guns of Fort Moultrie. Secessionists react angrily and feel betrayed because they thought President Buchanan would maintain the status quo.
