The diocese was established in 948, and dissolved in 1536 during the Protestant Reformation. Within the newly established protestant Church of Denmark, the Diocese of Ribe effectively replaced its Roman Catholic precursor.\nThe diocese contained 29 deaneries and 278 parishes. Its bishop also oversaw a number of monasteries and friaries, in addition to a hospital.\nHistory\nRibe was established as a diocese for Leofdag in 948 under the supervision of Adaldag, Archbishop of Hamburg, who was authorized by the Roman Curia to proselytize the Danes. Leofdag (Leofdag of Ribe) was consecrated by Adaldag, and attended the Synod of Ingelheim. Adam of Bremen praised Liafdag's pastoral zeal. Leofdag was martyred that same year, when a housecarl skewered him with a spear, as he forded the river at Ribe. He is regarded as a local saint, though he was never canonized. His remains would eventually end up in Ribe Cathedral. The name \"Leofdag\" indicates he was not Danish. According to Johannes Vastovius, Leofdag was born in Friesland. Until the death of his third known successor Vale (1044–59) the bishops of Ribe, Schleswig, and Aarhus wandered about Jutland on missionary tours.\nRibe Cathedral, which served as the central cathedral of the diocese, contains a shrine dedicated to him. Until the death of his third known successor, Val, the bishops of Ribe, Schleswig, and Aarhus primarily worked to convert locals to their faith and traveled around Jutland on missionary tours.\nIn 1060, the region north of the Kongeå in Jutland was divided into the four dioceses of Ribe, Aarhus, Viborg and Vestervig. The diocese was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen until 1104, when the newly formed Archdiocese of Lund became its metropolitan.\nAlthough Ivar Munk was selected to take the position of bishop in 1499, he was not ordained until 1513. During his term, the church was pressured by the Protestant Reformation. He lost authority over some of his diocese in Northern Schleswig following their adoption of protestantism, though he maintained authority over the remainder of the diocese.\nIvar Munk opposed the selection of Christian III of Denmark as king in 1533, yet was forced to act as a privy councillor to the monarch's party for Jutland. As a result, he resigned from his position as bishop. Ivar Munk was succeeded by his nephew, Olaf Munk in 1534. As a result of the reformation, Olaf Munk was imprisoned on 12 August 1536, like all other catholic bishops in Denmark. He was later released on the conditions that he conform to the Church of Denmark and marry.\nStructure\nThe first church built within the diocese was founded by Ansgar ca. 855. It was initially overseen by his successor: Saint Rembert. The church was destroyed following Rembert's death in 888, though it was rebuilt circa 948. Following the completion of Ribe Cathedral in the 12th century, it served as the central cathedral of the diocese. The city of Ribe was also home to St. Nicholas' Priory, a Franciscan friary, St. Catherine's Priory, a hospital of the Holy Ghost, and a commandery of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. The diocese also oversaw the Cistercian monasteries of Tvis Abbey, Løgum Abbey, and Seem Abbey, which had been Benedictine until 1171. There were Benedictine convents at Gudum Priory and Stubber Priory, in addition to a Dominican priory in Vejle and a Franciscan friary in Kolding.\nThe diocese comprised 29 deaneries and a total of 278 parishes. The bishop's cathedral chapter included four prelates, 21 prebendaries, eight minor canons, and approximately 50 chaplains.\nBishops\n*948–9??
