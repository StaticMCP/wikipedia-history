The Grogan family of Dublin were cousins of the Grogans of Johnstown  Castle, County Wexford, who narrowly escaped forfeiture of their estates after the Irish Rebellion of 1798, in which they fought on the rebel side. Educated at Winchester College and Trinity College Dublin, Grogan matriculated with a M.A. degree. He was called to the bar in 1840. He was made a baronet on 23 April 1859, of Moyvore, County Westmeath.\nHe was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dublin City at the 1841 general election, and held the seat until the 1865 general election. As a young man, he was a fierce opponent of  Catholic Emancipation, but this had ceased to be a live issue long before he entered politics.\nIn 1867, he married Catherine Charlotte MacMahon, daughter of Sir Beresford Burston MacMahon, 2nd Baronet and Maria Bateson, and granddaughter of Sir William MacMahon, 1st Baronet, Master of the Rolls in Ireland. They had four children. In January 1891, he fell from the upstairs window of his home in Dundrum and suffered severe injuries, dying two weeks later.\n|crest = A lion's head erased Sable charged with a mullet Or.\n|motto = Honor Et Virtus}}\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
