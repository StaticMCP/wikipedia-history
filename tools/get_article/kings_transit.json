The system, incorporated in 1981, is funded by Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County and the towns of Berwick, Wolfville, Kentville, Middleton, Annapolis Royal, and Digby.\nKings Transit originally operated between Wolfville and Kentville, eventually expanding to Greenwood in western Kings County.\nIn 2000, the Municipality of the County of Annapolis funded the system's expansion to Bridgetown and eventually Annapolis Royal.  The Municipality of the District of Digby funded the expansion of Kings Transit west to Weymouth, serving Upper Clements Park, Cornwallis Park and Digby.  The Municipality of the District of West Hants funded the system's eastern expansion from Wolfville through Hantsport to Brooklyn.\nToday the Kings Transit system consists of seven fixed routes, primarily travelling on Trunk 1 from Grand Pre to Weymouth.\nIn October 2015, Kings Transit ended their Wolfville to Brooklyn route due to lack of funding from West Hants, and the towns of Hantsport and Windsor.\nFleet\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
