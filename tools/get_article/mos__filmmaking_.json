The solution was to use a special form of motor which has multiple \"windings\" in it, and which can be connected to another identical motor in such a way that turning one motor a certain distance will turn the other motor exactly the same distance. The motors did not have to be close together, and, with appropriate circuitry, did not have to be of the same size or power. These motors were called selsyn (self synchronous) motors. A system was created by which a single sound recording room could be connected to any of the stages on a studio lot (such connection points are still visible on some of the oldest stages). The production sound mixer on stage connected the control panel to the recording room and the camera. There was a selsyn motor on the camera and it was linked to a matching selsyn motor on the sound recording equipment at another point on the studio lot.\nIn order to use this system, the sound mixer used an intercom to the sound recordist to tell him to \"roll\", or start the system. Since this was a mechanical system, it took some time to start the motors and get them up to proper speed. When proper speed and synchronization was reached, the recordist would use the intercom to announce, \"Speed\" and the sound mixer would relay that to the director and crew on the stage. The expression is still used, but now simply means, \"Sound is recording\".\nIt was the recordist who started and stopped the camera motor. The camera operator had a switch to ensure that the camera did not roll at an inopportune time such as loading, replacing lenses, etc. It was also the recordist's duty to stop the motor if something went amiss. The actual power source for the camera motor was in the sound booth.\nWhen a shot was planned that did not require sound, the sound mixer would ask the recordist to \"roll the motor only\". The recordist would start the camera motor without starting the matching \"sound\" motor and electronics. The procedure, allegedly, acquired the name \"motor only shot\", which became the basis of the acronym MOS.\nAlternative origin\nA popular origin theory is that MOS stands for broken English \"mit ohne sound\", that is, \"without sound\" as a 1920s German-émigré director might have said it.\nAccording to this theory, a German director, recently transplanted to Hollywood (probably Ernst Lubitsch, but possibly Fritz Lang), was asked by a script supervisor how he would like to shoot the next scene of the day. The director apparently responded \"mit ohne sprechen!\" which translates to \"with without speaking\", and so this was noted as a joke on the production reports and the camera slates for the shot. However, the apparently nonsensical phrase \"mit ohne\" is used commonly in spoken German albeit jokingly looked down upon.\nIn ''The Screenwriter's Bible'', author David Trottier credits the term to Austrian director Erich von Stroheim, who allegedly would tell his crew \"Ve'll shoot dis mid out sound.\"\nUnsubstantiated meanings\nOther explanations for the meaning of the initials have appeared over the years in books, articles, publications, journals, and web pages:\n*mic off stage\n*minus optical signal\n*minus optical stripe\n*minus optical sound\n*motor only sync\n*music on side\n*muted on screen\n*mute on sound\nPublished definitions\nOccurrences\n* MOS Scene shot silent, i.e., without sound rolling. Derives from \"mit out sound\" as in \"ve vill shoot it mit out sound,\" allegedly spoken by a director of Germanic descent to his Hollywood crew. Pronounced \"m-o-s\".\n* MOS stands for \"mit-out sound\" and is a continuing industry joke on the German directors who came to Hollywood in the late 1920s and early 1930s and preferred to add sound to their shots in post-production.\n* MOS Literally \"mit-out sound\". Used to denote a picture take for which no sound was shot.\n* M.O.S. Script abbreviation calling for a silent shot or scene accompanied by neither dialogue nor sound effects. It is said to have originated with a German-speaking Hollywood director who habitually referred to such shot as \"mit out sound\". At first used jokingly by cinema crews, the abbreviation stuck in film terminology. A shot of a scene without sound is sometimes also called a \"wild picture,\" a term borrowed from its counterpart, \"wild sound,\" the recording of sound without an accompanying picture.\n* It features MOS as well as studio self-blimped versions.... Used as a shorthand term for a motion picture camera that is not designed for synchronous (direct) sound photography.\n* Shots without sound are labelled MOS on camera reports; MOS stands for \"mit-out sound,\" naturally.\n* When there is no sound on a take, the sound no. is erased (from the slate) and the letters MOS (\"Mit Out Sound\") substituted to indicate it is a silent take. Everyone in the industry is familiar with the story of the German-accented Director who called \"without sound,\" and the phonetics-minded slateman who started a film industry tradition. Also see Figure 5-1 (Image of term as used on a camera report).\n* MOS (mit-out-sound) An expression used instead of saying silent shot.\n* M.O.S. - a silent shot (Mit out sound)\nAbsences\nThe terms \"MOS,\" \"motor only shot,\" \"mit out sound,\" or any of their versions, do not occur in the following works:\n*\n::A compilation of lectures on sound sponsored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, held from September 17, 1929 through December 16, 1929.\n*\n::A Series of Lectures Presented to the Classes Enrolled in the Courses in Sound Engineering Given by the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Hollywood, California, in the fall of 1936 and spring of 1937.\n* Cameron, James R.
