Knopf.\nPlot\n“The King in the Tree” is told from   first-person singular point-of-view by a reliable narrator, Thomas of Cornwell, counselor to the King.\nThe narrative is presented as a series of chronological diary entries kept by Thomas as the tragic events unfold.\nThe novella is a retelling of the legend of Tristan and Iseult, in which a beautiful young queen and the king’s nephew—her kinsman by marriage—fall in love, an act of treason.\nBackground\nMillhauser bases this novella on the legend of Tristan and Iseult, “one of the Western canon’s oldest myths of infidelity.” Recognized as a “foundation story in the courtly tradition,” this version is perhaps the “the most unromantic permutations ever spun of this romance.” Biographer and critic Earl G. Ingersoll provides this narrative sketch:\nMillhauser’s rendition focuses on the king “whose dilemma is loving both his queen, Ysolt, and his nephew-rival, Tristan.”\nThe title for the novella refers to King Mark perched in a tree, secretly observing his queen and nephew, who he suspects of having an affair.\nThe narrative for the novella is an amalgamation of the “all the available versions” of the legend. Millhauser enlisted the name of Thomas of Britain (or Thomas of Cornwall)—whose poem on the story of Tristan and Iseult survives only in fragments—to serve as the narrator.  Describing Thomas as “ambivalent,” Ingersoll reports that as councilor, he is dedicated to the King but limited by his    first-person point-of-view assigned by Millhauser. Thomas “can only observe and record what he sees and hears, but not penetrate the psyche of the King, the Queen, or Tristan.”\nCritical appraisal\nKirkus Reviews  considers “The King in the Tree” the “best” of the collection’s novellas: “It’s an unforgettable dramatization of the many faces of love and loyalty.\nTurrentine places the center of Millhauser’s narrative in the suffering of the king whose cuckolding is more tragic than comic:\nMillhauser’s denouement reveals that “Tristan and Ysolt not only destroy their own lives, but deeply wound many others as well,” not least of whom is the king, who loves them both.\nFootnotes\nSources\n*Gabinski, Andrzej. 20o9-2010.
