Warananagar, is a cooperative organization generating electric power from non-conventional, natural clean energy resources, such as hydro and biomass through the co-operative sector.  These members are other co-operative organizations of Warana Group.  They have also proposed to generate electric energy from wind, solar, tidal and geothermal, and later from other conventional energy resources.\nWarana Group\nWarana Group (Warana Nagar) is situated on the banks of the Warana River, and lies in a green valley about  from the city of Kolhapur, and about  from Mumbai. The transformation of Warana from a barren to its current prosperous and fertile region began with the setting up of a cooperative sugar factory near the village of Kodoli in 1959.  The Warana Power Co-operative idea of generating energy through co-operative organization was grown in the mind of Vinay Kore; and in January 2005, Warana Power Co-operative had been established.  To start, Warana Power Co-operative took up 6 small hydropower projects form the state government of Maharashtra under the BOT (build–operate–transfer) policy.\nHydropower projects\nThe hydropower projects, all located in Kolhapur district, Maharashtra, India, are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Bagasse, a waste product of sugar cane, will be used as fuel in the co-generation plant for the 150-day crushing period of the sugar factory; and for remaining 150 days, imported coal or biomass such as sugarcane trash, cotton stalk, rice husk.
