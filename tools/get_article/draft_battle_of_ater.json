This meeting was convened in the context of growing Maratha influence in North India and the weakening of central Mughal authority under Emperor Muhammad Shah. At the outset of negotiations, Bajirao I demanded a revenue assignment of Rs.13 lakh along with the cession of the province of Malwa. These demands were accepted by the imperial side, a move that emboldened the Peshwa to escalate his demands further. Subsequently, Bajirao pressed for the right to annually levy tribute amounting to ₹10,60,000 from several Rajput principalities located south of the Chambal River. These included: Bundi, Kota, Bhadawar, Orchha, Datia, Khechi, Chanderi, Amjhera, Narwar, Sipri, and Rampura. The imperial delegation agreed to this demand in principle, and secret documents confirming the arrangement were prepared. However, these documents were eventually leaked to Bajirao, which provided him with evidence of the Mughal court’s vulnerability.\nAccording to historian William Irvine, this disclosure led Bajirao to dramatically increase his demands, which now included:\nThe forts of Mandu, Raisen, and Dhar\nHereditary rights to collect revenue from the six Deccan provinces\nRs. 50 lakh in cash or an equivalent order on Bengal\nControl over the cities of Mathura, Banaras, Gaya, and Allahabad\nThese expansive demands proved unacceptable to even the conciliatory factions within the Mughal court. As a result, the diplomatic negotiations collapsed.\nBattle\nBy March 1737, Maratha forces under Bajirao I and his general Malhar Rao Holkar had begun a concerted military campaign in the Bhadawar region, located to the southeast of Agra. This incursion was part of a broader Maratha strategy to extend influence into the Mughal-controlled territories of North India. During this campaign, the rulers of Orchha, Datia, and Narwar capitulated and agreed to pay substantial sums to the Marathas in exchange for peace. The Maratha movement in the region alarmed the Mughal authorities, prompting a response supported by Saadat Ali Khan I, the Nawab of Awadh, who pledged military and economic support to resist the Maratha advance. While Bajirao I remained encamped at Dholpur with approximately 8,000 cavalry, he ordered Malhar Rao Holkar to lay siege to the fortified stronghold of the Raja of Bhadawar. In response, Mughal commanders Khan Dauran and Qamar-ud-Din Khan mobilized—one advancing toward Ajmer and the other toward Mathura. Simultaneously, Burhan ul Mulk, the Subahdar of Awadh, crossed the Ganges River to aid the Aniruddh Singh Bhadauriya, Raja of Bhadawar. Burhan-ul-Mulk, in coordination with Aniruddh Singh, engaged Holkar's forces near Bhadawar and pursued them toward Gwalior. Upon learning that Bajirao remained encamped at Dholpur, they redirected their efforts northward, intending to confront the Peshwa.\nHowever, as Burhan-ul-Mulk, Qamar-ud-Din Khan, and Khan Dauran began converging on his position, Bajirao I strategically withdrew, retreating towards Gwalior while conducting plundering operations along his route. Notably, this retreat was unopposed by the imperial forces, underscoring the difficulty faced by the Mughal army in mounting an effective resistance.\nReferences"
