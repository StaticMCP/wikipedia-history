When the Imperial German Army was reorganized as the Reichsheer, 'A Squadron'/'10th Horse' became bearer of the regiment's tradition.\nThe 1st King's Mounted Rifles belonged to the V Army Corps and was garrisoned in Posen. When the regiment was mobilized in 1914, it formed 10th Cavalry Brigade. Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment was Wilhelm II, German Emperor who was also the King of Prussia, hence the title ''King's''.\nSee also\n*List of Imperial German cavalry regiments\nReferences\n*\n\n---\n\n## 1st King’s Mounted Rifles\n\n#REDIRECT 1st King's Mounted Rifles"
