Duncan also authored several books on plant species of the Eastern and Southeastern United States.\nBiography\nDuncan was born in Buffalo, New York, on October 15, 1910. He attend Bloomington High School in Indiana. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees, in 1932 and 1933, from Indiana University Bloomington, then his PhD in botany from Duke University in 1938. He then began a forty-year period in the faculty at the University of Georgia.\nAs Curator of the UGA Herbarium, he increased the collection size from 16,000 to 135,000 specimens. He personally collected over thirty thousand specimens, which he shared with herbaria across the country.\nDuring World War II, Duncan served in the United States Public Health Service, in which he earned the rank of Major. His duties during this period included directing mosquito control for Charleston, South Carolina and serving as state entomologist for Kentucky.\nDuncan was married for 64 years (from 1941 until his death) to botanist Marion Bennett Duncan, with whom he collaborated on several books, including Wildflowers of the Eastern United States.\nSpecies described\nDuncan is the botanical authority who first described three plant species: Quercus oglethorpensis, Trillium persistens, and Baptisia arachnifera.
