The following is a list of nominees and recipients of the awards, along with the film(s) for which they were nominated.\nHistory\nThe category, which made its debut at the 15th Razzie ceremony, was originally named Worst Screen Couple, but in 2011 it was changed to Worst Screen Couple / Worst Screen Ensemble so entire casts could be included.
