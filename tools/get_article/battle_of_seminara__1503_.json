Frederick was deposed and his kingdom divided between the two occupying forces as stipulated in the treaty. However, dissension appeared between the Spanish and the French for possession of several areas that lay between their spheres of control, and by June 1502 war broke out between them.\nThe more numerous French forces were divided into two: the French Viceroy of Naples, Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours remained in Apulia besieging Fernández de Córdoba in Barletta while d'Aubigny pursued the Spanish forces under Hugo de Cardona and Manuel de Benavides in Calabria.\n.]]\nThe battle\nIn February 1503 a Spanish fleet sailed from Cartagena, Spain, headed for southern Italy carrying reinforcements for Fernández de Córdoba.  The fleet consisted of 40 ships carrying 600 cavalry and 2,000 infantry under the command of Luis Portocarrero, and arrived in Messina, Sicily on 5 March. However, Portocarrero died shortly after his arrival, and Fernando de Andrade took over command.\nUpon hearing of the Spanish reinforcements, d'Aubigny gathered 200 cavalry and 800 infantry and marched towards Terranova Sappo Minulio. He lifted the siege of Terranova and proceeded to San Martino.  Meanwhile Fernando de Andrade crossed over from Messina and concentrated his troops at Seminara. After negotiations, the French and Spanish agreed to do battle on Friday, 21 April. On that day both armies met halfway between Seminara and Gioia Tauro; in the ensuing battle the Spanish defeated the French, who retreated to the north, pursued by the Spanish.\nConsequences\nD'Aubigny and his remaining troops were besieged in Castel Angitola, and was forced to surrender one month later. He was taken to Castel Nuovo as a prisoner. The French defeat led to Calabria falling under Spanish control; one week after this battle, Fernández de Córdoba would defeat the French at Cerignola in Apulia.\nNotes\nReferences\n*Juan de Mariana, José Sabau y Blanco, Madrid.
