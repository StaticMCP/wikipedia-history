Rise Up in fact served as a proto-version of Breaking All the Rules, as the latter album features re-recordings of nearly all tracks on Rise Up, including its title track, which features an almost entirely different lineup of musicians; only Frampton and bassist John Regan appeared on both versions of \"Rise Up\".\nThe album had won airplay for its anthemic title track, which was co-written with Procol Harum lyricist Keith Reid. The album's cover was photographed at 350 W 23rd Street, Chelsea, New York City. The album features Steve Lukather and Jeff Porcaro of Toto.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Peter Frampton except where indicated.\n# \"Dig What I Say\" – 4:13\n# \"I Don't Wanna Let You Go\" – 4:22\n# \"Rise Up\" (Alessi Brothers) – 3:46\n# \"Wasting the Night Away\" – 4:13\n# \"Going to L.A.\" – 6:05\n# \"You Kill Me\" – 4:18\n# \"Friday on My Mind\" (George Young, Harry Vanda) – 4:18\n# \"Lost a Part of You\" – 3:43\n# \"Breaking All the Rules\" (Frampton, Keith Reid) – 7:17\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1981)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart\n|align=\"left\"|89\n|}\nPersonnel\n*Peter Frampton – guitars, keyboards, vocals\n*Steve Lukather – guitars & backing vocals\n*John Regan – bass guitar\n*Arthur Stead – piano, synthesizer, electric piano, organ, Fender Rhodes & backing vocals]\n*Jeff Porcaro – drums, percussion\nReferences"
