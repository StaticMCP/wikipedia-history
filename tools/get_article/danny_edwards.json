He started playing golf at age 14 and nearly four years later won the Oklahoma State High School Championship.\nHe is the older brother of former PGA Tour player David Edwards.\nAmateur career\nEdwards attended Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma and was a four-year starter on the golf team. He won the 1972 and 1973 Big Eight Conference Championships, the 1972 North and South Amateur, and was a three-time All-American. He was the lone unbeaten player on the 1973 Walker Cup team and that same year, while on his first trip to Europe, finished as the Low Amateur in the British Open.\nProfessional career\nIn 1973, Edwards turned professional. In 1975, he joined the PGA Tour and won five official tour events. His first victory came at the 1977 Greater Greensboro Open – the only event he would win twice. His best finish in a major was T-5 at the 1974 British Open. Edwards would earn more than three dozen top-10 finishes in Tour events; his final win came at the 1985 Pensacola Open.\nIn 1982, two months after winning his second Greater Greensboro Open he donned a racing helmet and won the June Sprints, one of the country's most prestigious automobile races, in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin. He is the only PGA Tour professional to accomplish the crossover victory feat in the two sports.\nIn the summer of 1988, after 14 years on the PGA Tour, and never losing exempt status, Edwards stepped away from competitive golf and founded Royal Grip Inc., in Scottsdale, Arizona. The company would become its own revolution in advancing and improving perhaps the most essential piece of golf equipment.\nceomees  he turned his attention to the business world. In 1998, Edwards became CEO of GreenFix Golf, a company that manufactures a tool that enables players and maintenance crews to repair ball marks to golf greens. In 2019, he founded The Chipping Equation, a revolutionary yet simple system that is geared to helping golfers of all abilities learn and perfect one forgotten yet key segment of the game.\nIn April 2022, Edwards wrote his first book, DRIVEN - The Danny Edwards Story (with Bob Denney), which was published by Classics of Golf, www.ClassicsofGolf.com, Amazon, Kindle, and Apple.\nPersonal life\nEdwards lives in Wellington, Florida.\nAmateur wins\n*1972 North and South Amateur, Southeastern Amateur\nProfessional wins (9)\nPGA Tour wins (5)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.!!Date!!Tournament!!Winning score!!Margin ofvictory!!Runner(s)-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=right|Apr 3, 1977\n|Greater Greensboro Open\n|−12 (68-68-68-72=276)\n|4 strokes\n| George Burns,  Larry Nelson\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|align=right|Oct 19, 1980\n|Walt Disney World National Team Championship(with  David Edwards)\n|−35 (60-63-65-65=253)\n|2 strokes\n| Gibby Gilbert and  Grier Jones, Dan Halldorson and  Dana Quigley, Mike Harmon and  Barry Harwell\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|align=right|Apr 5, 1982\n|Greater Greensboro Open (2)\n|−3 (66-72-72-75=285)\n|1 stroke\n| Bobby Clampett\n|-\n|align=center|4\n|align=right|Jul 17, 1983\n|Miller High Life QCO\n|−14 (66-64-69-67=266)\n|Playoff\n| Morris Hatalsky\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|align=right|Oct 20, 1985\n|Pensacola Open\n|−15 (67-68-67-67=269)\n|1 stroke\n| John Mahaffey,  Gil Morgan\n|}\nPGA Tour playoff record (1–0)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result\n|-style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\"\n|align=center|1\n|1983\n|Miller High Life QCO\n| Morris Hatalsky\n|Won with birdie on first extra hole\n|}\nPGA of Japan Tour wins (1)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.!!Date!!Tournament!!Winning score!!Margin ofvictory!!Runners-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=right|Nov 15, 1981\n|Toshiba Taiheiyo Masters\n|−12 (67-70-69-70=276)\n|3 strokes\n| Jerry Pate,  Tom Watson\n|}\nOther wins (3)\n*1975 Oklahoma Open\n*1977 Oklahoma Open\n*1979 Oklahoma Open\nResults in major championships\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1972\n!1973\n!1974\n!1975\n!1976\n!1977\n!1978\n!1979\n|-\n|align=left|Masters Tournament\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T19\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|U.S. Open\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|T19\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|The Open Championship\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T39LA\n|style=\"background:yellow;\"|T5\n|T23\n|T60\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|PGA Championship\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T36\n|T38\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;text-align:center;\"\n!Tournament\n!1980\n!1981\n!1982\n!1983\n!1984\n!1985\n!1986\n!1987\n!1988\n!1989\n!1990\n|-\n|align=left|Masters Tournament\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T24\n|T36\n|T18\n|T47\n|T28\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|U.S. Open\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T12\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T44\n|CUT\n|T24\n|T40\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|-\n|align=left|The Open Championship\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|T21\n|T29\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|-\n|align=left|PGA Championship\n|T59\n|T61\n|T22\n|T20\n|T39\n|T47\n|CUT\n|CUT\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|\n|}\nLA = Low amateur\nCUT = Missed the half-way cut (3rd round cut in 1982 Open Championship)\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\nSummary\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Tournament !!
