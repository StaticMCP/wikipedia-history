      "text": "# Warren House Colliery\n\nWarren House Colliery was a coal mine situated to the north of Rawmarsh, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England.\nThe colliery within lands owned by Earl Fitzwilliam was opened in the early 19th century and closed in, or shortly after, the First World War. The pit was leased to Wakefield-based agents J. J. Charlesworth & Company. The colliery was connected underground with two other local Charlesworth pits, Warren Vale Colliery and Kilnhurst Colliery.\nSome remains of the colliery buildings and one of the spoil heaps still remain after almost 100 years after closure.\nReferences\n* Official handbook of Rawmarsh Urban District Council, 1959."
