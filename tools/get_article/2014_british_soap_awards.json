The ceremony was held on 24 May 2014 at the Hackney Empire theatre in Hackney, London, and was later broadcast on ITV1 and STV. The publicly voted categories were announced on 17 March 2014, with the vote opening that same day. This included a longlist for the Best Actress and Actor, Sexiest Female and Male and Villain of the Year awards. The shortlist, including panel nominations, was released on 27 April 2014. An accolade for Outstanding Achievement (off-screen) was introduced, replacing Best Exit.\nChannel 4 soap Hollyoaks won three of the six viewer-voted categories including Best British Soap, while ITV soap Coronation Street took the other half of the publicly-chosen awards. This marked Hollyoaks first win of Best British Soap. Coronation Street also took home the most awards of the night, with nine wins. Their wins included cast member Helen Worth receiving the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement for her role as Gail Platt. EastEnders and Emmerdale each won one award, while BBC medical soap Doctors did not win one.\nWinners and nominees\nPublicly voted\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Award\n! Winner\n! Shortlisted\n!
