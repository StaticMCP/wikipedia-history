Like most tribute albums, it features  cover versions of many Queen songs by various artists, but uniquely the songs are not performed by established groups. Instead, the album is performed by a group of musicians who normally perform with other groups or artists, in different combinations for each track.\nNotable artists featured on the album include Yngwie Malmsteen, John Petrucci, Robby Krieger, the Kulick brothers and Lemmy. The musicians involved come mainly from a metal background, having performed with the likes of Motörhead, Deep Purple, Impellitteri, Meat Loaf, Kiss, Alice Cooper, Dream Theater, Megadeth, Quiet Riot, Hawaii, Cacophony, Ozzy Osbourne, Whitesnake and Black Sabbath.\nThe album was re-released in the UK as Top Musicians Play Queen: The Collectors Collection  with \"Keep Yourself Alive\" omitted and a 2010 recording of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", with John Wetton on vocals, added.\nChris Impellitteri is incorrectly listed on the cover as 'Chris Impelletteri'.\nTrack listing\n#I Want It All – Vocal: Robin McAuley; Lead Guitar: Chris Impellitteri; Rhythm Guitar: Bob Kulick; Keyboards: Edward Harris Roth; Drums: Jay Schellen\n#Sheer Heart Attack – Vocal: James LaBrie; Lead and Rhythm Guitar: Marty Friedman; Bass: Tony Franklin; Drums: Carmine Appice\n#Another One Bites the Dust – Vocal: Adam Paskowitz; Lead and Rhythm Guitar: John Petrucci; Bass: Rudy Sarzo; Drums: Tommy Aldridge\n#Save Me – Vocal: Jeff Scott Soto; Lead Guitar: Bruce Kulick; Piano: Michael Sherwood; Bass: Ricky Philips; Drums: Eric Singer\n#We Will Rock You – Vocal: Paul Shortino; Lead & Rhythm Guitar: Bob Kulick; Drums: Jay Schellen; Backing Vocals: Matt Laurent, Nick Dio\n#We Are the Champions – Vocal: Paul Shortino; Lead Guitar: Robby Krieger; Rhythm Guitar: Bob Kulick; Piano: Michael Sherwood; Bass: Tony Franklin; Drums: Carmine Appice; Backing Vocals: Matt Laurent, Nick Dio\n#Tie Your Mother Down – Vocal: Lemmy; Lead Guitar: Ted Nugent; Rhythm Guitar: Lemmy, Bob Kulick; Bass: Rudy Sarzo; Drums: Tommy Aldridge\n#Get Down Make Love – Vocal: Glenn Hughes; Lead Guitar: Jake E.
