The church has served as parish church of the neighbourhood of Sant'Edoardo since 1947, and from 1951–1991, along with the Church of Santa Croce. Construction of the church began on 24 June 1938 and was consecrated by Cardinal Ildefonso Schuster on 12 October 1939.\nFrom the Church in 1945, the news that the North of Italy was now free from Fascist forces was sent by the Partigiani, including the priest of the church, Ambrogio Gianotti. A plaque was erected near the location where the news was announced.\nHistory\nIn 1936, plans to construct a larger church for the Cascina Brughetto began, due to an increase in the population of the area. The previous church, dedicated to Sant’Eurosia, was demolished in 1954, 15 years after the Church of St. Edward opened, and two years after the Church of Santa Croce opened. The church's crypt was opened on 15 November 1938, and for nearly a year served as the church of Strà Brughetto. The neighbourhood was constructed over one of the presumed sites of the Battle of Legnano, and before the 1940s, was scarcely populated, with its residents living in Cascinas, predominantly owned by the Azzimonti, Brazzelli, Colombo, Crespi, Girola, Lualdi, Pellegatta, Tovaglieri, and Tosi families, whose descendants still reside in the neighbourhood today.\nConstruction of the church began on 24 June 1938 and was finished and consecrated on 12 October 1939 by Cardinal Ildefonso Schuster. The church was primarily funded by Edoardo Gabardi, to whom the church was dedicated.\nThe church was designed by two architect-priests, Don  and Don Giacomo Bettoli. The architects took inspiration from the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio and the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. The frescos were painted between 1943 and 1947 by Ernesto Bergagna, with additional frescos painted in 1985 by Giuseppe Magini.\nIn 1945, at the church, the order for the partigiani to liberate the area was sent from the church. The first priest, Don Ambrogio Gianotti (1901–1969), was a partigiano. The church became the parish church for the neighbourhood in 1947.\nIn 1972 the church acquired the paintings from the Church of Santa Croce, which was demolished that year. The church also has an Oratorio, dedicated to Giovanni Bosco. The oratorio was founded on 19 January 1947, by Don Silvio Gallazzi, who created the church's 'summer school' in the summer of 1946. It was replaced with the oratorio in 1947. Currently, the oratorio is directed by Don Gabriele Bof.\nOn 11 March 1963, the church was briefly visited by the then Archbishop of Milan, Giovanni Battista Montini, who would be elected Pope a few months later.\nThe church celebrates its patron saint day on the second Sunday of October every year.\nThe church's current priests are: Don Antonio Corvi, Don Giorgio Zordan and Don Gabriele Bof. The church's nun is Suor. Laura Motta, who arrived in 2024. The choir is directed by Luca Andena.\nThe church's construction was officially finished in 2025, after they added a missing section of the floor by the organ.\nArchitecture\nInterior\n, 1661. Once conserved in the Church of Santa Croce, now in Sant’Edoardo. ]]\nThe interior of the church is decorated with frescos, painted by Ernesto Bergagna and Giuseppe Magini. At the back of the altar there is a large mosaic, representing the trinity, made by the ‘Beato Angelico’ school. Various artworks present in the church came from the old Church of Santa Croce, demolished in 1972.\nOn the left side of the church, near the altar, there is the church's organ, donated by the church of Santa Maria di Piazza. The nave has four chapels, two on the left side, two on the right. Along with the main altar, there are two other altars on each side of the main altar. The church's organ has never been used, due to the fact that the floor surrounding it was missing until 2025, concluding the church's construction.\nFrescos\nThe frescos on the churches side walls were painted in 1985 by Giuseppe Magini. There are 12 frescos on the walls. Magini chose these frescos to represent the prayer of the Profession of faith, and they terminate on the church's main arch with the words ' Tu solo Signore hai parole di vita eterna (Only you Lord have the words of eternal life). Each of the 12 frescos depicts a verse from the profession of faith prayer. The 12th fresco depicts Maranatha (מרנאתא‎). This was chosen to represent the community's unity and hope. The frescoes are supposed to be read left to right, starting from the right side of the church.\nChapels\nThe nave has four chapels, two on the right, two on the left.\nOn the left side there is:\n*A chapel dedicated to Saint Edward. This chapel was built fairly recently, with the statue of Saint Edward being sculpted in 1994.\n*A chapel dedicated to Saint Rita of Cascia. The chapel was built in 1943 and the portrait of Saint Rita was painted by Bregagna. The chapel also has a black marble altar in front of the painting. It was restored in July 1989, in honour of the church's 50th anniversary.\nOn the right side there is:\n*A chapel dedicated to Saint Teresa. This chapel is similar to the one dedicated to Saint Rita. It has a small black altar at the front, with a portrait of Saint Teresa in the back. This chapel was also built in 1943, by Bergagna and was also restored in July 1989.\n*The tomb of Don Ambrogio Gianotti. This tomb was built in 1980, and Gianotti was officially interred there 11 years after his death, on the 12 April 1980, after being moved from the cemetery of Busto Arsizio. The tomb also features a portrait of  Jesus Christ.\nAltars\nThe church, along with the main altar, has two smaller altars on each side of the main altar. The main altar is situated in the apse of the church and is covered with a Baldachin. On the sides of the baldachin there are a series of palm trees, which reference Palm Sunday, and the interior of the baldachin is decorated with mosaics. On top of the baldachin there are four statues, which depict the Tetramorph of the Four Evangelists. The baldachin is topped with a marble cross.\nOn the left side there is:\n*The Altar dedicated to the Saints Ambrose, Charles Borromeo, and Galdino. This altar is decorated with frescos of the three saints, along with a fresco of Our Lady of Help painted by Bergagna between 1943 and 1947. The altar was consecrated in 1947. On the altar, there is the church's tabernacle. The tabernacle was made by the Beato Angelico school.\nOn the right side there is:\n*The Altar dedicated to Madonna of the Rosary. This altar was constructed between 1943 and 1947, and consecrated in 1947. Behind the altar there is a large fresco depicting the Madonna holding the baby, Jesus. Around this fresco there are various pictograms. Each pictogram depicts a verse from the Ave Maria. This was all designed and executed by Bergagna.\nApse\nThe Apse displays a mosaic, inspired by Byzantine architecture. It depicts four figures; Saint Edward, who holds a crown, and the Holy Mary. They face towards the trinity, which sit in a gold circle in the centre, between a dove, chosen by Bergagna to represent peace. On the mosaic, are inscribed the words: 'PATREM ET FILIUM ET SANCTUM SPIRITUM DICAMUS ET SUPEREXALTEMUS EUM IN SÆCULA' which translate to '' 'Let us praise the Father and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and exalt Him forever'.''  The dome was constructed between 1959-1961, by Ernesto Bergagna. It was designed by Bergagna and the Beato Angelico school.\nBaptistery\nThe baptistery was constructed between 1940-1941 and decorated by Ernesto Bergagna between 1943-1947. The baptistery has an octagonal shape and each side depicts a fresco of a biblical event associated with baptisms. In the center there is the baptismal font made of marble and a small altar.\nExterior\nThe exterior is covered with bare brick. The church also has a portico by the entrance, with two memorials dedicated to Edoardo Gabardi, constructed in 1942 and to Don Ambrogio Gianotti, constructed in 1971. The portico was constructed in 1941. By the entrance there are 6 statues, which (in the original design) were meant to be placed on the roof of the portico. The church was meant to have a decorated Cornice, which would have depicted various scenes of Jesus Christ's life, but due to lack of funds this couldn't be achieved. On the portico, above the entrance, the words 'D. O. M. AC D. ÆDUARDO REGUMQUE REGIS CONF.' which translate to  To God and to King Edward the confessor, king of kings.\nBell tower\nConstruction of the bell tower began in 2002, and concluded in 2003. The construction of the steel frame though began in 1946, but due to lack of funds it wasn't completed for another 57 years. It has the same style of bare brick like the church. There are 11 bells. On the side of the bell tower, facing the road, there are two plaques, one commemorating the church's involvement in the liberation of Italy, and the other commemorating the construction of the bell tower. Standing at 52 meters, the bell tower is the tallest in Busto Arsizio. In 2024, the bell tower was opened for the first time since its construction to the public, with guided tours being offered one weekend a year.\nParish priests\nBelow is the list of parish priests of the church of Saint Edward:\n*Don Ambrogio Gianotti (1947–1969)\n*Don Eugenio Bertolotti (1969–1992)\n*Don Giovanni Mariano (1992–2000)\n*Don Giuliano Mattiolo (2000–2011)\n*Don Emilio Sorte (2011–2019)\n*Don Antonio Corvi (2019–)\nNotable people\n*Don Ambrogio Gianotti (1901–1969), first priest of St. Edward, partigiano.\n*Giovanni Marcora (1922–1983), Italian politician and partigiano, frequently attended mass  at the church and lived in the neighbourhood during the war.\n*Angelo Borri (1919–2001), Mayor of Busto Arsizio from 1979 to 1985, lived in Sant'Edoardo and was known for being an active parishioner.\nNotes\nReferences"
