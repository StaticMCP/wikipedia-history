Founded on July 24, 2019, CARD follows a rights-centered approach to support the democratization process in Ethiopia.  The organization focuses on promoting civic engagement among youth, facilitating conflict-sensitive dialogue through informed freedom of expression, and combating disinformation, hate speech, and dangerous speech. CARD also works on grassroots empowerment of youth and women to foster a human rights culture in Ethiopia.\nFoundation and Mission\nCARD was co-founded by Ethiopian writer, activist, and blogger Befeqadu Hailu Techane, who currently serves as its Executive Director.  Befeqadu Hailu is also known for being a co-founder of the Zone 9 Bloggers group.CARD was established following legal reforms for civil society organizations in Ethiopia.\nThe organization's mission is to contribute to Ethiopia's democratization by empowering citizens, particularly youth and women, to actively participate in the promotion and protection of human rights and democratic values.\nActivities and Achievements\nCARD engages in various activities aimed at achieving its mission. These include:\n* Civic Engagement of Youth: CARD prioritizes the involvement of young people in democratic processes and human rights advocacy.\n* Conflict-Sensitive Dialogue: The organization promotes discussions that are sensitive to existing conflicts and aim to build understanding and peace.\n* Combating Disinformation and Hate Speech: CARD actively works to counter the spread of false information and harmful rhetoric.\n* Human Rights Education and Awareness: CARD is dedicated to making human rights a popular movement through grassroots empowerment.\nSome notable achievements of CARD include:\n* Hosting the Human Rights Festival 2023.\n* Signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a Coalition of Journalists Association for Safety.\n* Launching research on the media landscape and conflict-sensitivity.\n* Organizing a Youth Dialogue Forum on Secularism.\nChallenges and Government Relations\nCARD has faced significant challenges in its operations, particularly concerning its relationship with the Ethiopian government and the Authority for Civil Society Organizations (ACSO).\nIn November 2024, ACSO initially suspended CARD along with other civil society organizations, alleging that they were engaged in activities lacking political impartiality and acting against national interests. This suspension came shortly after CARD, along with other organizations, condemned the government's proposed amendments to the Ethiopian Mass Media Proclamation, which aimed to increase government oversight of the media. While the initial suspension of CARD was reportedly lifted on December 12, 2024, the organization was re-suspended by ACSO on December 18, 2024. ACSO claimed that CARD had \"failed to heed the lessons\" from the previous warning and had not taken corrective measures.\nCARD challenged the suspensions, arguing that ACSO did not follow the necessary legal procedures, such as providing prior notification or conducting a transparent investigation. International human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, criticized the suspension, stating that Ethiopian authorities were \"squeezing shut whatever space remains for independent rights groups to operate in the country\".\nThe Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced the lifting of suspensions on several rights groups, including CARD, in March 2025, citing successful advocacy efforts and commitment to dialogue from ACSO, government bodies, and the affected organizations. However, the repeated suspensions indicate the challenging environment in which CARD operates, particularly concerning its advocacy for human rights and freedom of expression.\nReferences"
