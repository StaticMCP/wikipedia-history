They were sparked by the 1993 Guatemalan constitutional crisis in which President Jorge Serrano Elías had attempted a self-coup. The result was a victory for Ramiro de León Carpio, who won unopposed in the second round of voting, whilst the army-backed Arturo Herbruger was elected vice-president.\nResults\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Dosal, Paul J.
