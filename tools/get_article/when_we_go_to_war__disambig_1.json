The series uses fictional characters to depict the impact of the First World War on New Zealanders at home as well as in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force during the Gallipoli Campaign and in Egypt. The series premiered in 2015, the centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign, with its first two episodes aired together during the ANZAC day holiday weekend.\nProduction\nThe six one-hour episodes were commissioned and broadcast by TVNZ. Each episode is framed around a letter written by one of six young men and women, who, in 1914 on the eve of World War I, are full of plans and dreams. Studio filming was undertaken at Studio West in West Auckland.\nEpisodes\n|episodes        =\n| Viewers             = 314,820\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| Viewers             = 314,820\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| Viewers             = 305,820\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| Viewers             = 273,310\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| Viewers             = 267,450\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| Viewers             = 284,840\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
