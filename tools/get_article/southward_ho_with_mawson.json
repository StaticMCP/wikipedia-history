      "text": "# Southward Ho with Mawson\n\nSouthward Ho with Mawson, also spelt Southward Ho! With Mawson, is a 1930 Australian silent documentary film directed and filmed by Frank Hurley about the first BANZARE expedition (1929), led by Douglas Mawson.\nThe film was a black and white silent film, photographed and directed by Hurley \"under the auspices of the Commonwealth Government\".\nThe film was widely screened in cinemas across Australia, with the title variously recorded as having an exclamation mark after the word \"Ho\".  It was sometimes presented as a lecture which included the motion footage, lantern slides, sound effects on disc, and commentary by Hurley. When the film was screened at the Lyceum Theatre in Sydney in August 1930, the Minister for Education encouraged further screenings for schoolchildren.\nA second film also made by Hurley, Siege of the South, was released in 1931, capturing the second voyage by BANZARE. This film had a soundtrack.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n\n---\n\n## Southward Ho With Mawson\n\n#REDIRECT Southward Ho with Mawson\n}}"
