It is named after two barrow sites in Dorset and dates to between c. 1400 BC and 1200 BC.\nSite characteristics\nThe period is characterised by the incorrectly-named Celtic fields, palisaded cattle enclosures, small roundhouses and cremation burials either in urnfield cemeteries or under low, round barrows. Cremations from this period were also inserted into pre-existing barrows. The people were arable and livestock farmers.\nPottery\nDeverel–Rimbury pottery is characterised by distinctive globular vessels with tooled decoration and thick-walled, so-called \"bucket urns\" with cordoned, usually finger-printed decoration. In the southern counties of the UK, fabric is usually coarsely flint-tempered. In East Anglia and further northeast grog-tempering is typical.\nTerminology\nThe term \"Deverel-Rimbury\" is now mostly used to refer to the pottery types, as archaeologists today believe that Deverel–Rimbury does not represent a single homogeneous cultural group but numerous disparate groups who shared a varying range of cultural traits.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060106043919/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/ceramics/pages/subcategory.asp?subcat_id=803&subcat_name=Deverel-Rimbury Deverel-Rimbury ware at the Museum of London]"
