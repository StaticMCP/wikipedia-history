He joined Magdalene College, Cambridge in 1845. In April 1846, he joined the 6th Dragoon Guards as a cornet, and between 1847 and 1851, he was a lieutenant of the same group. He married Eliza Browne, daughter of Andrew Browne of Mount Hazel in 1850. Together they had one child: Pauline Mary McEvoy (–1944), who married the 4th Duke of Stacpoole.\nAt some point, he was a Justice of the Peace. He also received the Order of St. Gregory the Great.\nAt a by-election in 1855, McEvoystood as an Independent Irish candidate and was elected as one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Meath . He was again elected at the next general election in 1859 and shortly after joined the Liberal Party on its formation. He then held the seat until 1874 when he stood down.}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
