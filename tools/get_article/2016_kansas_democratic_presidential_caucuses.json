Sanders ran up big margins in urban areas including Kansas City, Lawrence, Topeka, and Wichita, but also won in very rural areas. He won all four congressional districts in the state, never dipping below 60% of the vote. His worst showing was in Kansas's Third Congressional District which borders Missouri, where he received 62% of the vote.\nReferences"
