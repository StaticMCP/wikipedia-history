It is applied in a range of production models, including intensive conventional agriculture, low-input systems, and organic or regenerative methods. The approach seeks to improve agricultural productivity while supporting sustainability, resource efficiency, and climate resilience.\nUnlike prescriptive models, integrative agriculture is defined by its flexibility and system-wide orientation. It combines various practices—such as advanced plant breeding, precision farming, agroecological design, and sustainable soil and water management—to optimize the performance of the farming system as a whole. The goal is to enhance both yield and environmental outcomes under changing climate and socioeconomic conditions.\nOverview\nThe concept of integrative agriculture builds on the understanding that farming systems are complex and interconnected. It promotes the alignment of genetic, environmental, and technological innovations to manage agricultural systems more efficiently. It has been linked to broader paradigms such as sustainable intensification, agroecology, and climate-smart agriculture.\nThis approach is applicable to diverse farming contexts. In intensive systems, it may involve digital tools, biotechnology, and AI-based decision support. In low-input or organic settings, integrative agriculture often incorporates crop diversification, natural resource recycling, and participatory innovation. Its adaptability makes it suitable for both industrial and smallholder agriculture.\nPrinciples and practices\nIntegrative agriculture is underpinned by several key principles. These include systemic thinking, where interactions between soil, plants, water, biodiversity, and management are viewed collectively; technological integration, such as the use of precision farming tools and artificial intelligence; and ecological balance, emphasizing ecosystem services such as pollination, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration.\nPractices vary based on local contexts but commonly include the use of climate-resilient crop varieties developed through modern breeding techniques, conservation agriculture to protect soil and water, agroforestry to diversify production, and integrated crop-livestock systems. Precision agriculture technologies—such as sensors, drones, and satellite imagery—are often used to optimize input use, especially in large-scale operations.\nResearch and innovation\nScientific research plays a central role in advancing integrative agriculture. Emerging technologies such as multi-omics (genomics, transcriptomics, phenomics), AI-based crop modeling, and climate forecasting are increasingly applied to improve decision-making and system design.\nBreeding strategies focus on enhancing traits linked to reproductive resilience, especially under heat, drought, and salinity stress. Participatory approaches are also important, especially in low-resource settings where farmers contribute to co-developing and validating new practices.\nPolicy and global relevance\nIntegrative agriculture aligns with international goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those targeting food security (Goal 2), climate action (Goal 13), and land sustainability (Goal 15).\nIt is also supported by the Paris Agreement through its emphasis on adaptive and low-emission agriculture. In the European Union, integrative principles are reflected in the European Green Deal and the Farm to Fork Strategy.\nCase studies\nA prominent example is the RECROP COST+ initiative, a European network that promotes reproductive resilience in crops such as maize and tomato by integrating genomics, agronomy, and AI technologies. Similarly, FAO’s Climate-Smart Agriculture programs have applied integrative strategies to improve yields and sustainability among smallholders in Africa and Asia.\nIn Europe, eco-functional intensification initiatives have introduced integrated pest management, cover cropping, and biodiversity enhancement in conventional systems, demonstrating the model’s relevance to industrial agriculture.\nLiterature and academic context\nSeveral studies have framed integrative agriculture as essential to modern agricultural transformation. Agho et al. (2025) highlighted the necessity of cross-disciplinary coordination to ensure reproductive success in crops under climate stress. Pretty et al. (2018) argued for agricultural redesign combining ecological principles with technical innovation. Tittonell (2020) presented integrative approaches as a foundation for ecological intensification. Reviews by Zhang et al. (2022) emphasized the role of AI and omics tools in designing resilient agroecosystems\nReferences"
