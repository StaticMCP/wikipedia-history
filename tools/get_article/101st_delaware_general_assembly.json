Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began in Dover on the first Tuesday in January. This date was January 4, 1921, which was two weeks before the beginning of the first administrative year of Governor William D. Denney and J. Danforth Bush as Lieutenant Governor.\nThe distribution of the Senate Assembly was made to seven senators for New Castle County and for five senators each to Kent and Sussex counties. Likewise, the distribution of the House Assembly was made to fifteen representatives for New Castle County and ten representatives each to Kent and Sussex County. The actual population changes of the county did not directly affect the number of senators or representatives at this time.\nIn the 101st Delaware General Assembly session, the Senate had a Republican majority and the House had a Democratic majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Wallace S.
