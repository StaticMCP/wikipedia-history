Toni Stern wrote the lyrics and King wrote the music. It was released as a single in April 1971 by Ode Records and reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts. Sales were later platinum-certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Billboard ranked \"It's Too Late\" and its fellow A-side, \"I Feel the Earth Move\", as the No. 3 record for 1971.\nMusic and lyrics\nThe lyrics describe the blameless end of a loving relationship. Music critic Dave Marsh saw implicit feminism because the woman leaves the man. Marsh also remarked on the maturity of the theme.  Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that \"if there's a truer song about breaking up than 'It's Too Late,' the world (or at least AM radio) isn't ready for it.\"  Marsh described the melody as Tin Pan Alley and the arrangement as a cross between light jazz and \"L.A. studio craftsmanship.\" Rolling Stone remarked that Carole King's \"warm, earnest singing\" on the song brought out the song's sadness. According to author James Perone, the feel of the song is enhanced by the instrumental work of Danny Kortchmar on guitar, Curtis Amy on saxophone and King on piano. Kortchmar and Amy each have an instrumental solo. Cash Box described the song as \"a sensitive ballad with a strong rock under-beat.\" Record World said that it is \"quality contemporary pop.\"\nLyricist Toni Stern told author Sheila Weller that she wrote the lyrics in a single day, after her relationship with James Taylor ended. (This runs counter to multiple obituaries, including one by her husband of many years until her death, Jerry Rounds.) The recording won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards in 1972, and the song is included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2003 the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\nPersonnel\n*Carole King&nbsp;– piano, vocals\n*Curtis Amy&nbsp;– soprano saxophone\n*Danny \"Kootch\" Kortchmar&nbsp;– congas, electric guitar\n*Charles \"Charlie\" Larkey&nbsp;– bass guitar\n*Joel O'Brien&nbsp;– drums\n*Ralph Schuckett&nbsp;– electric piano\nSoundtracks\n\"It's Too Late\" has been featured in Hollywood films, including Fandango (1985), The Lake House (2006), and Invincible (2006).

The single, released by Mercury Records, earned Carroll her first hit, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart and on the Music Week Dance Singles chart. It was also a top-5 hit in Israel and Luxembourg and a top-30 hit in Austria, peaking at number 21.\nCritical reception\nJames Hamilton from Music Week described the cover as a \"gentle Carole King revival\" in his weekly Dance column. Anthony James from NME wrote, \"'It's Too Late' should see a reversal in their fortunes. Featuring the gutsy vocals of Dina Carroll it's a truly kickin' track but with a commercial edge. Carole King will turn in her rave.\" Another NME editor, Ian McCann, complimented it as \"a genuine hit\".\nTrack listing\n* 7\", UK (1991)\n:A. \"It's Too Late\"\n:B. \"Obsession\"\n* 12\", UK (1991)\n:A. \"It's Too Late\" (Overnight Mix)\n:B1. \"It's Too Late\" (Overnight Dub)\n:B2. \"Obsession\"\n* CD single, UK & Europe (1991)\n#\"It's Too Late\" (Overnight Mix) – 9:37\n#\"It's Too Late\" (Overnight Dub) – 6:46\n#\"Obsession\" 3:17\n* Cassette, UK (1991)\n:A1. \"It's Too Late\"\n:A2. \"Obsession\"\n:B1. \"It's Too Late\"\n:B2. \"Obsession\"\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1991)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 17\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Israel (Israeli Singles Chart)\n| 5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Luxembourg (Radio Luxembourg)\n| 2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n| 8\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Airplay (Music Week)\n| 4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Dance (Music Week)\n| 8\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Club Chart (Record Mirror)\n| 6\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1991)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n| 57\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Club Chart (Record Mirror)\n| 53\n|}\nGloria Estefan version\n| type          = single\n| artist        = Gloria Estefan\n| album         = Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me\n| released      =\n| recorded      = 1993–1994\n| studio        =\n| venue         =\n| genre         = Pop\n| length        = 3:57\n| label         = Epic\n| writer        =\n* Carole King\n* Toni Stern\n| producer      =\n* Emilio Estefan, Jr.\n* Jorge Casas\n* Clay Ostwald\n| prev_title    = Everlasting Love\n| prev_year     = 1995\n| next_title    = Cherchez La Femme\n| next_year     = 1995\n| misc          = }}\n}}\nCuban American singer and songwriter Gloria Estefan released her cover of \"It's Too Late\" in 1995 as the third promotional single (in the US), and fourth overall single released from her fourth studio album, Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me (1994). It was produced by Emilio Estefan, Jr., Jorge Casas and Clay Ostwald, and released in May 1995 by Epic Records.\nCritical reception\nAllMusic editor Eddie Huffman described Estefan's version as \"[a] moment of genuine pathos\" in his review of the Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me album. Steve Baltin from Cash Box felt the singer \"does a decent job with the vocals, but this is one of those songs that everybody feels they own. As such, it’s better off being left alone.\" Chuck Campbell from Knoxville News Sentinel viewed it as a \"faithful\" remake of Carole King's 1971 hit, \"though Tim Mitchell's intrusive electric-guitar solo is an unwelcome addition.\" Phil Shanklin of ReviewsRevues remarked that King's voice does possess the same warmth as Estefan's. Tony Cross from Smash Hits gave Estefan's version two out of five, writing that \"Glo's done a fine job tweeking it into shape by funking it up a bit.\"\nOfficial versions\n# Album version – 3:57\n# Piano mix – 3:38\n# Radio mix – 3:19\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
