The route ran from an intersection with unnumbered Duncan Road, just west of DE&nbsp;41, north of Prices Corner east to DE&nbsp;100 near Elsmere. Along the way, the route intersected DE&nbsp;41 and DE&nbsp;141 as it passed through suburban areas to the west of Wilmington. The road was paved in the 1930s and designated DE&nbsp;34 in 1974. The DE&nbsp;34 designation was removed from Faulkland Road in 2019.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;34 began at an intersection with Duncan Road north of Prices Corner and headed east on two-lane undivided Faulkland Road through wooded areas and homes, crossing Hyde Run. The route intersected DE&nbsp;41 and passed north of Brandywine Springs Park, where a park and pool lot is located, before it crossed Red Clay Creek and the Wilmington and Western Railroad at-grade. The road continued east through suburban neighborhoods, crossing Centerville Road. Farther east, DE&nbsp;34 ran through residential and commercial areas, crossing Little Mill Creek before it came to an intersection with DE&nbsp;141. Past this junction, the route passed to the south of DuPont's Chestnut Run Plaza research facility and headed across Chestnut Run. DE&nbsp;34 crossed an East Penn Railroad line at-grade and ran between two cemeteries before ending at DE&nbsp;100 north of the town of Elsmere, just west of the western city limit of Wilmington.\nDE&nbsp;34 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 9,141&nbsp;vehicles at the DE&nbsp;100 intersection to a low of 3,482&nbsp;vehicles at the DE&nbsp;41 intersection.\nHistory\nFaulkland Road originally existed as a county road by 1920. By 1936, the road was paved. DE&nbsp;34 was designated onto Faulkland Road in 1974 in order to give \"proper recognition\" to the important connector road that linked DE&nbsp;41, DE&nbsp;141, and DE&nbsp;100. In 2019, the Delaware Department of Transportation proposed removing the DE&nbsp;34 designation from Faulkland Road in order to reduce traffic volumes and truck traffic along the road, which runs mostly through residential areas. The removal of the designation occurred in the middle part of 2019.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-034/ Former DE&nbsp;34 at AARoads.com]"
