      "text": "# Charles Pickard Ware\n\nCharles Pickard Ware (c. 1840–1921) was an American educator and music transcriber. An abolitionist, he served as a civilian administrator in the Union Army, where he was a labor superintendent of freedmen on plantations at Port Royal, South Carolina, during the American Civil War. This included Seaside Plantation. It is here that he transcribed many slave songs with tunes and lyrics, later published in Slave Songs of the United States, which he edited with William Francis Allen and Lucy McKim Garrison. It was the first published collection of American folk music.\nWare was also an educator in Boston, Massachusetts.\nReferences\n*William Francis Allen, Charles Pickard Ware and Lucy McKim Garrison, Slave Songs of the United States,  1867, New York\n*Manuscript Papers of Charles Pickard Ware, ca. 1862 - 1907 resides at Howard University, Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington D.C.\n*Elizabeth Ware Pearson (ed), Letters From Port Royal 1862-1868, 1906, W.
