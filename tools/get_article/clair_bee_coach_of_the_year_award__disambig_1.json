      "text": "# Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award__disambig_1\n\nThe Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award honored the active men's NCAA Division I basketball coach who has made the most significant positive contributions to his sport during the preceding year. The winner reflected the character and professional qualities of Clair Bee, a Hall of Fame coach who many consider to be the best technical basketball coach in history, and a man who cared deeply about his players' well-being. The Hilton and Bee Awards were created by Chip Hilton Sports and the NCAA Foundation in 1996 as a way to promote positive character in the sport of basketball, a game upon which the legendary Bee had a great impact as a coach, administrator, innovator and teacher.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!
