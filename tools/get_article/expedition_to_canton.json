Beginning at the Humen Strait (Bogue), the British captured the forts leading up to the city of Canton (Guangzhou). The operation was in response to British subjects being attacked by the Chinese near Canton. Hong Kong Governor John Davis demanded redress from Chinese Commissioner Keying.\nUnsatisfied with his reply, Davis ordered Major-General George D'Aguilar, the commander-in-chief of British forces in China, to seize the forts approaching Canton and to prepare for an attack on the city to force reparations on the spot. The forts were captured, but Canton was spared after Keying agreed to punish the culprits and to allow entry into the city.\nOperations\nOn the afternoon of 1 April 1847, D'Aguilar received communication from Davis with orders to proceed to Canton with force.
