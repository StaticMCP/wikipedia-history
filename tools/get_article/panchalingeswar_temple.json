The temple is on top of a hillock near the Nilagiri hill.\nThe Shivalingas are said to have been enshrined by Sita, the wife of Lord Rama during their exile. Another story holds that King Banasura worshiped the Swayambhu Lingas at this place given its beauty. A perennial stream, which is the main attraction of the area, regularly washes the Shivalingas as it flows over them. To reach to the Shivalingas, one has to lie flat on the rock parallel to the stream, touch and worship the lingas present inside a natural reservoir of the water stream.\nLocation\nPanchalingeswar is 27.7&nbsp;km south west from Balasore.
