Climatic conditions and poor soils limit farm output, and domestic food production meets about 15% of demand. 10% of the Djiboutian workforce are employed in agriculture.\nHistory of agricultural development\nIn the year 1999, the amount of vegetation that was produced in Djibouti was about 23,000 tons. Agriculture consists of growing of tomatoes in the country that is usually for the purpose of household utilization and the date palms are also produced along the coastal fringes of the country.\nDjibouti's harsh climate does not support much variety in the flora. The production in the area of agriculture is limited to a certain extent. The official figure that was given in 1991 for employment in agriculture was about 75 percent of the total employment. Farm animals have always received greater importance in comparison to farming and agriculture, which consists of vegetables and fruits. The agricultural products of Djibouti include goats, animal hides, camels and sheep.\nLand use and irrigation\nWhich  dedicated to irrigated agriculture, under 2% of the land is arable and about 60% is suitable for grazing livestock. Most arable land is in the Tadjourah Region, and the Mabla Mountains near Obock. The highest parts of Goda Mountains receive 300–500&nbsp;mm of rain annually, and the adjacent area, north of the Mabla Mountains, receives 200–300&nbsp;mm. Central and Southern Boura Mountains and Arta Mountains average 150 to 250&nbsp;mm.\nFishing\nDjibouti has a coastline of  of and a maritime area of  at the crossroads of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Djibouti's fishing catch was 503 tons by 1981, and 2296 in 2014. Most fleets were located on the eastern coast near Djibouti City.\nAlthough there is no a large-scale fishery in Djibouti and it does not have a big role in the economy, there exists a subsistence-level fishing that is locally important in some rural communities. The present contribution of fisheries to the economy is less than 0.1%, it can be raised substantially to around 5% if the projections are realised.\nStatistics\nGeographic coordinates:\nArea:\nLand:\nWater:\nCoastline:\nContiguous zone:\nExclusive economic zone:\nTerritorial sea:\nClimate: Desert, dry\nTerrain: Coastal plain and plateau separated by central mountains\nNatural resources: potential geothermal power, gold, clay, granite, limestone, marble, salt, diatomite, gypsum, pumice, petroleum\nLand use:\nArable land: 0.1%\nPermanent crops: 0%\nPermanent pastures: 73.3%\nForests and woodland: 0.2%\nOther: 26.4%\nIrrigated land:\nNatural hazards: earthquakes, droughts, occasional cyclonic disturbances from the Indian Ocean which bring heavy rains and flash floods\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.fao.org/family-farming/detail/en/c/289319/]\n*[http://ec.europa.eu/echo/field-blogs/stories/djibouti-farming-barren-wasteland_en]"
