The Treaty of Chudniv was signed on 17 October, mostly repeating the 1657 Treaty of Hadyach (although the creation of Grand Duchy of Ruthenia had to be confirmed by the Polish king) and pledging Cossacks allegiance to the Poles.\nReferences\n* Łukasz Ossoliński, \"Kampania na Ukrainie 1660 roku\"; doctoral thesis (University of Warsaw), 1995, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040611013227/http://www.historia.icenter.pl/pdf/Kampania_na_Ukrainie.pdf available here]"
