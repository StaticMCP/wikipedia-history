Ellen is able to materialize anything she wishes due to perfectly remembering the periodic table; creating precious metals and causing explosions at will.

Ellen's greatest wish to is to become a voluptuous woman, but she only has a few years before she stops aging permanently.\n:Ellen later ascended to godhood, with the power to manipulate all matter; Origin explained it as a form of purification as Ellen can \"reset\" what she deems incorrect.\n; Rovel Vankrieft\n:\n: A hero who save his kingdom from demons; he is Ellen's father and half spirit. He is so handsome that most women will immediately consider infidelity. Rovel is very displeased the prince is blackmailing him and Ellen into helping resolve the curse; otherwise the truth about Aria's receiving a divine punishment would be revealed.\n:Rovel is annoying to Ellen, due to his obsessive doting and overprotectiveness; she has to act like the adult most of the time and scold him.\n; Origin\n:\n: Ellen's mother and Rovel's wife, nicknamed \"Ori\" by the latter; she is the Goddess of creation and Queen of Spirits. Ori is best remembered for her see through dress, which she has no shame in wearing. Her sisters govern truth and marriage.\n:Origin's powers can create life, be it passively affecting the environment by being in the human world, or deliberately by creating spirits.\n; Sauvel Vankrieft\n: The current Duke; he looks older due to his mustache. Sauvel is a good man, but is weak willed and has little time for family. He often calls in Rovel and Ellen for help.\n; Aria Vankrieft\n: Formerly a barmaid and Sauvel's lover for many years in his unhappy marriage.

She does end up befriending the princes, whom see her hardship.\n; Agielle\n: A princess of the royal family, who forced an engagement to Rovel before his disappearance; she forced Sauvel to marry her instead, lying that her daughter was the result of a drunken one-night stand.

Victorious but dying Rovel was taken to the spirit world by Spirit Queen Origin. Rovel has returned after ten years but stays anonymous as he does not want to be the hero. He also brought with him Ellen, his and Origin's half-spirit daughter. Ellen reveals in her past life she was a Japanese scientist. Rovel is found by his former bodyguard Alberto, who informs him after his victory the Venkreift's were made nobility. Unfortunately, his younger brother Sauval married Princess Agiel, Rovel's unpleasant former fiancée. Her extravagance has bankrupted the Vankreifts, so Alberto asks Rovel to somehow get rid of her. Knowing she is a devious woman, Rovel quickly visits a church and summons Origin to legally register their marriage. With her power to synthesize elements from the periodic table Ellen creates platinum wedding rings. The wedding is also blessed by Origin's sisters, twin Goddesses Vor the All-seeing and Var the Condemner. Rovel sends Origin and Ellen to the spirit world so Agiel doesn't learn they exist. Watching through a spirit mirror they watch Rovel confront Agiel, a selfish, obese woman obsessed with Rovel, convinced he has returned to marry her.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Agiel introduces her similarly obese daughter Amiel, whom she insists is Rovel's daughter. Sauvel's butler Roren confirms Amiel probably isn't Sauvel's daughter either. Rovel demands a meeting with the Justice Department to begin Sauvel's divorce. Rovel informs Sauvel about Origin and Ellen. Sauvel admits he has a mistress and a daughter he wishes to be with. The King is informed of the situation so his underhanded son Ravisel reminds him it is vital he not upset Rovel further. Ellen notices miasma around Ravisel and Origin explains it is a curse placed on the royals generations ago for angering the spirits. In court Agiel demands a divorce so she can marry Rovel, whom she insists is Amiel's father. Rovel denies this as he has been gone ten years and cannot have fathered the eight year old Amiel. Having claimed Sauvel is not Amiel's father either the court accepts Agiel's accidental confession of infidelity and grants the divorce along with forbidding Agiel to marry again. Goddess Var curses Agiel to prevent her touching men for the rest of her life. Rovel visits Ravisel in secret, who is pleased that with Agiel ruined and the King certain to abdicate he will soon become King thanks to Rovel. He suggests Ellen marrying his son, which Rovel rejects. He returns home certain Ravisel is now an enemy.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Suspecting it was Alberto that leaked information to Ravisel, Rovel suspends Alberto's employment. Rovel meets his mother Isabella and explains the royal family's curse prevents them forming contracts with spirits, so Ravisel must want to marry Ellen to his son to end the curse. Rovel introduces Origin and Ellen to Isabella. Ellen demonstrates her powers by creating a huge diamond and a pile of gold bars. Isabella worries about being able to freely create such wealth, so Ellen promises not to do it again. She gives the diamond to Isabella while Sauvel takes the gold to restore public funds stolen by Agielle. Alberto insists he won't work for Ravisel anymore, but Ravisel forces him to perform one last task. Alberto infiltrates the house at night to give Ellen a letter from Ravisel. Refusing to even read it she informs ALberto the royals have forgotten it was their arrogance that offended the spirits, and until they earn forgiveness they do not deserve to form contracts with them. She advises Alberto to never see Ravisel again and convinces Rovel to consider forgiving Alberto, who only had good intentions for the Vankreift's. Ravisel is amused Ellen was smart enough to burn his letter and becomes even more determined to have her for the royals.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Rovel reassigns Alberto as Sauvel's bodyguard, but reminds him it is his fault Ravisel is targeting Ellen. Rovel and Sauvel decide to claim the gold Ellen conjured was discovered in a Vankreift mine to hide where it came from. Sauvel hopes to bring his lover Aria, a barmaid at a café, and their daughter Rafilia who is Ellen's age, to live in the mansion. As Ellen is destined to replace Origin as Spirit Queen, Rovel agrees Sauvel needs to marry Aria so Rafilia can be heir to the Vankreift's. Aria is attracted to Rovel as soon as she meets him. Rovel asks Origin to accompany him to the wedding as proof he is married, but asks Ellen to stay in the spirit world away from Ravisel. Aria cannot hide her disappointment that Rovel is married. Ellen notes Ravisel's wife Lalar and children Gadielle, Rasel, and Ciel possess the same royal curse. Goddess Var sends a sign disapproving of Sauvel and Aria's marriage which only they and Ravisel notice. Ellen panics as Ravisel could use it to destroy their family's reputation. To stop Ravisel saying anything, Ellen teleports to the wedding and creates a fake Goddess blessing by showering the guests in diamonds. Before she can teleport away, she is seen by Gadielle.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Knowing Var disapproved of Sauvel marrying Aria, Ravisel demands Rovel bring Ellen to meet his sons. Rovel confronts Aria who now has a scar on her wrist from Var for lying during her wedding vows. Origin explains the scar is faint, so Aria does love Sauvel, but she lusts for Rovel. Origin warns Aria to remain faithful to Sauvel to earn Var's forgiveness. Aria confesses her sin to Sauvel, hurting him deeply. Origin's servant Vint reveals to Ellen 200 years ago the human King demanded the Spirit Queen destroy monsters attacking his kingdom. When the Queen refused, the King tried to force her, and she ended up cursing the royals. Ellen decides it is unjust for Ravisel to try breaking the curse while unaware of the crime his ancestor committed. Ellen visits Aria and explains her actions have caused an even deeper rift between Rovel and the royals. Since Rovel is necessary for the kingdom's defense, Ravisel might fear Aria's actions will cause Rovel to leave again. This means Ravisel might assassinate Aria to please Rovel. Aria faints from terror and Sauvel thanks Ellen for giving Aria the warning she needed. As they are going to meet the royals, Isabella demands new formal clothes for everybody. Ellen also shaves Sauvel's beard, making him look more like Rovel and hopefully, more attractive to Aria.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Rovel and Ellen teleport to the royal castle where Ravisel attempts to embarrass Rovel with gossip of Aria's attraction to him, yet is impressed when Ellen deduces it was Queen Lalar spreading the gossip. Ravisel brings in Gadiel and Rasel, with Gadiel recognising Ellen as the wedding spirit.  With three cursed royals so close to her Ellen sees the truth; their miasma is deformed spirits, trapped and suffering. Ellen has a vision of the past King and sees he tortured spirits in an attempt to force the Spirit Queen to serve him. Rovel teleports Ellen away while Ravisel finally realises why royals can't talk to spirits. The next day the royals take part in their annual prayer to the spirits during the Spirit festival. It is revealed Gadiel learned the truth years ago from an old book and has been praying to the spirits regularly. Origin explains to Ellen that the spirits cursed the former King to always hear the screams of the spirits he tortured. The curse should have ended when he died but since the tortured spirits had nowhere to go they clung to the royal blood instead. Ellen is desperate to help the trapped spirits but Origin explains it will be difficult as the royals only pray once a year for tradition, not because they are truly sorry. As they have not earned forgiveness Origin is forced to forbid Ellen from helping the trapped spirits or contacting the royals.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Three years pass and though Gadiel and Rasel visit the Vankreift's regularly Ellen avoids them. On their latest visit they encounter Rafilia whom Gadiel finds amusing due to her temper. Ellen and Rovel visit Sauvel to help with the Vankreift mines. Ellen's childhood friend Van, a White Tiger spirit and son of Origin's butler Vint, regrets he can't go as he still can't take human form. Sauvel decides he must close the mine as the silver appears to have run out. He has also decided to claim Ellen's gold ingots are family heirlooms. They visit the miners who are like family to Isabella. Ellen notices the mine contains a lot of quartz, so she magics some silver into a quartz piece, giving the miners hope the mine can stay open. Rovel is angered by Ellen's interference. Sauvel also claims the mine has been cursed by the spirits. Ellen deduces the curse which makes the miners sick is actually Pneumoconiosis, a lung condition caused by breathing in rock dust. With Origin's permission Ellen draws on her past life as a scientist to design a medicine for the miners. After days of work Ellen transmutes the medicine but develops a fever from the effort.\n}}\n}}\nSee also\n* Parallel World Pharmacy, a light novel series also illustrated by keepout\n* Reincarnated as a Neglected Noble, a light novel series also illustrated by keepout\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  at Shōsetsuka ni Narō\n*\n*\n*\n*"
