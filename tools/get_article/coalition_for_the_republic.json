It consisted of several parties - the Movement for the Republic (RdR), Solidarność 80, National Christian Movement \"Polish Action\" (Akcja Polska), Freedom Party (PW), Upper Silesian Christian Democracy (GChD), Party of Polish Democracy (SDP), Polish Popular-Christian Forum \"Patrimony\" (\"Ojcowizna\") and the Patriotic Forum of Fighting Poland.\nHistory\nThe Coalition was initially formed on 6 July 1993, after a failure of two-month long coalition talks between RdR and the Centre Agreement (PC), the original party of RdR chairman Jan Olszewski. A failed attempt at bringing the Polish People's Party - Peasants' Agreement (PSL-PL) into the coalition left it as the weakest of the three \"center-right\" coalitions (other ones being the Catholic Electoral Committee \"Fatherland\" (KKW or \"Ojczyzna\") and Centre Agreement – Polish Union (PC-ZP)) running in the 1993 Polish parliamentary election.\nKdR ran a campaign under the slogan \"coalition of clean hands\" (). The campaign was notably similar to PC-ZP, both attacking the \"neocommunist\" Alliance of the Democratic Left (SLD) and \"pseudoliberal\" Democratic Union (UD) and Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD), the Balcerowicz plan as well as supporting lustration.\nThe coalition only contested one election, the 1993 parliamentary election, winning 2.70% of valid votes. Despite de-facto being a coalition, it registered as a party, thus only needing 5% of valid votes to cross the electoral threshold, which it failed to pass regardless. Their failure to pass the threshold contributed to the SLD's landslide victory in the election.\nElectoral results\nSejm\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
