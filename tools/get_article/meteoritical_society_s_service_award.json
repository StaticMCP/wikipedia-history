Examples of activities that could be honored by the award include, but are not limited to, education and public outreach, service to the Society and the broader scientific community, and acquisition, classification and curation of new samples for research. This award may be given annually, and should be given at least every other year. Winners will be granted lifetime membership in the Meteoritical Society.\nMeteoritical Society's Service Award Winners\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=center\n!Year!!Name\n|-\n|2006||Jörn Koblitz\n|-\n|2007||John Schutt\n|-\n|2008||Drew Barringer\n|-\n|2009||Derek Sears\n|-\n|2010||Joel Schiff\n|-\n|2011||Richard N.
