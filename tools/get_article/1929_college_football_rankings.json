But when it comes to saying that Notre Dame could beat Pittsburgh or that Notre Dame could beat Purdue or that Pittsburgh could beat Purdue -- that is something else again,\"\n]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Dickinson System\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Rank\n!scope=\"col\"| Team\n!scope=\"col\"| Record\n!scope=\"col\"| Rating\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 1\n| Notre Dame\n| 9–0\n| 25.00\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2\n| Purdue\n| 8–0\n| 23.60\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 3\n| Pittsburgh\n| 9–0\n| 22.00\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 4\n| California\n| 7–1–1\n| 20.00\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 5\n| Illinois\n| 6–1–1\n| 18.70\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 6\n| USC\n| 9–2\n| 17.75\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 7\n| Nebraska\n| 4–1–3\n| 16.82\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 8\n| TCU\n| 9–0–1\n| 16.51\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 9\n| SMU\n| 6–0–4\n| 16.31\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 10\n| Tulane\n| 9–0\n| 16.22\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 11\n| Penn\n| 7–2\n| 15.00\n|}\nErskine Trophy\nThe Albert Russel Erskine Trophy poll results were released on January 2.
