In 1881, he was appointed governor of Heligoland, knighted in 1887 and became governor of Newfoundland in 1889.\nO'Brien as governor of Newfoundland helped precipitate the 1894 bank crash by his many dispatches to London noting that Newfoundland politicians under Premier William Whiteway's Liberal Government were uniquely corrupt and incompetent. He resigned from office in 1895 and returned to London.\nThe Newfoundland community of Terenceville was so named in his honour. O'Brien's son, Sir Charles O'Brien, also became a colonial governor.\nO'Brien died in 1903 in London, England.\nSee also\n*Governors of Newfoundland\n*List of people from Newfoundland and Labrador\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/govhouse/governors/g56.html Biography at Government House The Governorship of Newfoundland and Labrador]\n*[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=6966 Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]"
