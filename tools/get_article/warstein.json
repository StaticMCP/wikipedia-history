It is located at the north end of Sauerland.\nGeography\nWarstein is located north of the Arnsberger Wald (forest), at a brook called Wäster. The area south of the city is mostly forested; the lightly forested Haarstrang mountain is to the north. The river Möhne flows between these two areas. The highest elevation is  in the south of the city near a hill called Stimm Stamm; the lowest elevation is  in the village Waldhausen in the north.\nNeighbouring municipalities\nThe following municipalities, some with town status, border Warstein (clockwise, beginning in the north): Anröchte, Rüthen (town), Bestwig, Meschede (town), Arnsberg (town), Möhnesee, Bad Sassendorf. Of these, Bestwig and Meschede are in the district of Hochsauerlandkreis, on Warstein's (and, thus, Soest district's) southern border.\nSubdivisions\nWhile named for the main settled portion within its  total area, the town can be roughly divided into the following subdivisions ():\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Allagen\n*Belecke\n*Hirschberg\n*Mülheim\n*Niederbergheim\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Sichtigvor\n*Suttrop\n*Waldhausen\n*Warstein\n|}\nHistory\nThe evidence of human life was found in the  between Warstein and Hirschberg.\nWarstein was first mentioned officially in the year 1072. Historians once thought Warstein was organized as an official town in 1276, but its exact charter date is unclear. Likely, it was founded between 1276 and 1296 by the Archbishop of Cologne, Siegfried von Westerburg.\nIn the Middle Ages, Warstein was part of the Hanseatic League, a trade association for guilds, a very important international trading association at that time.\nA fire in 1802 destroyed a significant portion of the town. After the 1802 fire the town centre was moved to the Wester brook. In 1844, the Amt Warstein was founded.\nIn 1975, Warstein and the other eight independent villages merged to form the new borough of Warstein.\nThe decrease of population in Warstein since 1998:\n*1998: 29,102\n*1999: 29,084\n*2000: 29,028\n*2001: 29,007\n*2002: 29,012\n*2003: 28,762\n*2004: 28,629\nList of mayors\n*1999–2004: Georg Juraschka (SPD)\n*2004–2015: Manfred Gödde (BG)\n*2015–incumbent: Thomas Schöne (CDU)\nInternational relations\nWarstein is twinned with:\n*25px Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, France - twinned in 1964\n*25px Wurzen, Saxony, Germany - twinned 3 October 1990\n*25px Hebden Royd, United Kingdom - twinned November 1995\n*25px Pietrapaola, Italy - an official friendship since 2001\nEconomy\nThe largest employer in Warstein is the Warsteiner brewery, founded in 1753.
