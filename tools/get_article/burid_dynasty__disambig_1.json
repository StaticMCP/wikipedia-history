Following Duqaq's death in 1104, he seized the city for himself.\nThe dynasty was named after Toghtekin's son, Taj al-Muluk Buri. The Burids gained recognition from the Abbasid caliphate in return for considerable gifts. In return, the caliphate did not interfere in the emirate.\nThe Burids ruled the city until 1154, when it was taken by the ruler of Aleppo, Nur ed-Din, founder of the Zengid dynasty.\nThe Burids lost to the Crusaders in the battle of Marj al-Saffar (1126) but were able to prevent the Second Crusade from capturing Damascus.\nmint, dated AH 533 (1138-9 CE).
