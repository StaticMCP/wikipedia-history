pertains to the awards, nominations and honors given to the ABC dramedy series Ugly Betty. The series so far has been nominated for 160 awards and won 60 of them, including 3 Emmys, 2 Golden Globes, 2 GLAADs, 5 NAACP Image, 8 ALMAs and 3 Satellite Awards. Of most of these achievements, America Ferrera has won an Emmy, a Golden Globe, an NAACP Image, a SAG, 2 ALMAs (one of them for Entertainer of the Year in 2008), and a Teen Choice breakout award. It has also been honored with a Peobody Award and was recognized by the United States Congress. In addition, Ferrera was chosen by Time magazine as one of their 100 most influential people in 2007, due to the portrayal of the series' main character, Betty Suarez.\nALMA Awards\nThe ALMA Awards honors the Hispanic entertainment community. During its first season, Ugly Betty won four of its first seven nominations and in the second season took home three more, along with a Chevrolet Entertainer of the Year Award for Ferrera for her work on the show. Overall the series has received eleven nominations.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! width=\"35%\" | Category\n! width=\"38%\" | Nomimee\n! width=\"18%\" | Episode\n!
