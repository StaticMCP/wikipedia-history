Raglan argues that the typical culture hero is a sacral king whose life follows a conventional narrative sequence rooted in ritual and kingship. Raglan identifies 22 beats in legendary hero narratives, known as the Raglan scale, and applies it comparatively to figures such as Oedipus, Theseus, Romulus, Moses, and more.\nThe Hero became influential across mythology and folklore and it generated sustained debate about method, comparativism, and historicity in classical studies and biblical scholarship.\nSynopsis\nRaglan frames his argument within James Frazer and the Cambridge school myth ritualism. He maintains that myths do not preserve biographies of historical individuals, presenting them as narratives that encode rites of seasonal renewal and sacral kingship and that are shaped by performance and tradition. He proposes a comparative pattern of 22 recurrent incidents in the life of a hero. The sequence begins with unusual birth and threatened infancy, passes through exile, return, decisive victory, marriage, and rule, and ends with loss of favor, mysterious death, and posthumous reverence. Raglan treats these incidents as a structured whole rather than as a loose list of motifs. He assigns points when episodes appear in a narrative to show how closely any one hero conforms to the scale.\nRaglan applies the scale to a wide range of mythic traditions. He highlights Greek narrative cycles about Oedipus and Theseus, Roman legends of Romulus, biblical traditions about Moses and Joseph, and medieval materials about Arthur, among others. He argues that heroes who accumulate many points should be treated as mythic rather than as strictly biographical. Raglan argues heroes' stories reflect real social roles and rituals, especially how sacred leaders fall from power. He sees ancient tragedies as stories that grew from these cultural patterns.\nRaglan Scale\nRaglan scored the following heroes: Oedipus (21 or 22 points), Theseus (20 points), Romulus (18 points), Heracles (17 points), Perseus (18 points), Jason (15 points), Bellerophon (16 points), Pelops (13 points), Dionysos (19 points), Apollo (11 points), Zeus (15 points), Joseph (12 points), Moses (20 points), Elijah (9 points), Watu Gunung (18 points), Nyikang (14 points), Sigurd (11 points), Lleu Llaw Gyffes (17 points), King Arthur (19 points), Robin Hood (13 points), and Alexander the Great (7 points).\nReception\nContemporary\nOn publication in 1936 the book attracted attention among classicists, anthropologists, and folklorists, a reception later documented by Robert A. Segal and William G. Doty. Segal and Doty praised Raglan's wide comparative scope and explicit \"hero pattern,\" but also questioned the assumption that the pattern forms a fixed order and criticized Raglan's point-by-point scoring as a tool for distinguishing myth from history. Scholars sympathetic to myth ritualism cited the work as an insightful synthesis, while other classicists voiced reservations about demands for uniformity across cultures and about reading literary sources as direct witnesses to ritual.\nLegacy\nScholars, influenced primarily by Robert A. Segal, embraced Raglan's scale as a useful theory for comparative hero work but cautioned its applicability to modern stories, as \"for Raglan, hero myths have disappeared.\" Alan Dundes reintroduced the scale to a new generation of folklorists and applied it to biblical materials, arguing that a high score identifies a mythic pattern rather than a historical biography.\nJonathan Z. Smith and Bruce Lincoln criticized universalizing comparative theories that privilege similarity and erase difference within Western mythic patterns, challenging Raglan-style patterning. G. S. Kirk rejected monolithic checklist theories that force diverse myths into uniform sequences, while William G. Doty emphasized attention to narrative voice, performance, audience, and social context that motif counts overlook. Despite these reservations, the book remains a standard reference in surveys of myth theory and in courses that introduce students to comparative approaches to ancient hero narratives.\nReferences"
