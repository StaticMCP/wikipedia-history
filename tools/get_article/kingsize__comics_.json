      "text": "# Kingsize (comics)\n\nKingsize is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\nFictional character biography\nKingsize attacked the Wasp as she was modeling her own fashion-wear in a mall. She defeated him by firing a sting-blast at the jewel on his forehead.\nFerocia, Blue Streak, Flame, and Kingsize later broke Ricadonna from Sing Sing. Kingsize and his allies waited in the Corporation HQ on Hart Island and he trained his shapeshifting abilities, and Ricadonna told them that they would finish their job now. During the Heroes for Hire's attack on the Corporation's facility Kingsize fought Orka, and was later carried by Orka into an escape tunnel before it exploded.\nPowers and abilities\nKingsize can transform into any animal by touching the jewel on his brow. He does not need to touch it to transform back into human form, and he reverts to normal when knocked unconscious. In Heroes for Hire (vol. 2), Kingsize receives a Skrull organ transplant that gives him enhanced shapeshifting abilities.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
