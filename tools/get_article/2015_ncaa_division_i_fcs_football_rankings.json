Unlike the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), college football's governing body, the NCAA, bestows the national championship title through a 24-team tournament. The following weekly polls determine the top 25 teams at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision level of college football for the 2015 season. The STATS poll is voted by media members while the Coaches' Poll is determined by coaches at the FCS level.  STATS LLC acquired The Sports Network, which previously sponsored the media poll, in early 2015.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|+ Legend\n|-\n| style=\"background:#bbffbb; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffbbbb; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| Italics\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n| (#–#)\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n| т\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nSTATS Poll\n|Week2Date =Sep 7\n|Week3Date =Sep 14\n|Week4Date =Sep 21\n|Week5Date =Sep 28\n|Week6Date =Oct 5\n|Week7Date =Oct 12\n|Week8Date =Oct 19\n|Week9Date =Oct 26\n|Week10Date=Nov 2\n|Week11Date=Nov 9\n|Week12Date=Nov 16\n|Week13Date=Nov 22\n|Week14Date=Jan 11\n|Week1-1   = North Dakota State 144\n|Week1-2   = Illinois State 3\n|Week1-3   = Sam Houston State\n|Week1-4   = Villanova\n|Week1-5   = Coastal Carolina\n|Week1-6   = Eastern Washington\n|Week1-7   = Jacksonville State\n|Week1-8   = Chattanooga\n|Week1-9   = New Hampshire\n|Week1-10  = Northern Iowa\n|Week1-11  = Montana State\n|Week1-12  = James Madison\n|Week1-13  = Montana\n|Week1-14  = Youngstown State\n|Week1-15  = Liberty\n|Week1-16  = South Dakota State\n|Week1-17  = Eastern Kentucky\n|Week1-18  = Richmond\n|Week1-19  = Southeastern Louisiana\n|Week1-20  = Fordham\n|Week1-21  = Indiana State\n|Week1-22  = Idaho State\n|Week1-23  = Harvard\n|Week1-24  = Stephen F.
