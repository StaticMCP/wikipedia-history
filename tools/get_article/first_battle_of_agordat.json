Fighting began when a force of one-thousand Mahdists attacked tribes that had signed protectorates with the Kingdom of Italy. The Sudanese continued on to the wells at Agordat, where they were met by two companies of Italian-led ascari. The battle that ensued was an Italian victory, with around 250 Mahdists being killed. Italian losses were three dead and eight wounded. Author Sean McLachlan attributes the Mahdists' defeat at both Agordat and the upcoming Battle of Serobeti (1892) to their \"inferior weaponry and fire discipline\".\nReferences"
