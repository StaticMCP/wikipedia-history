The earliest dynasty, known as the Badami Chalukyas, ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. After the death of Badami Chalukya ruler Pulakeshin II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. The Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) until the end of the 12th century.\n*Badami Chalukya Empire (c. 543–753 CE)\n*Eastern Chalukya Empire (c. 624–1189 CE)\n*Western Chalukya Empire (c. 957–1184 CE)\nList of kings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n! colspan=2 | Ruler!!Reign !!Capital\n|-\n|Jayasimha I||||500–520||Badami\n|-\n|Ranaraga||||520–540||Badami\n|-\n|Pulakeshin I||||540–567||Badami\n|-\n|Kirtivarman I||||567–592||Badami\n|-\n|Mangalesha||||592–610||Badami\n|-\n|Pulakeshin II||||610–642||Badami\n|- bgcolor=#cef\n|Kubja Vishnuvardhana I||||615/24–641||Vengi (Eastern)\n|- bgcolor=#cef\n|Jayasimha I (II)||||641–673||Vengi (Eastern)\n|-\n|Adityavarman||||642–645||Badami\n|-\n|Abhinavaditya||||645–646||Badami\n|-\n|Chandraditya||||646–649||Badami\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|Regency of Vijaya-Bhattarika (649–655)\n| Regent for her minor son.
