Like all the Pacific clubs, their forms were of a very wide variety and specific to each country and each purpose. They were found in phallic form, but also in the form of a fungus or a bird’s beak. Their striking head consisted of a root knot. These weapons were originally decorated with plants, human hair, or cloths, and were wielded with one or two hands.\nOceanian art specialist Roger Boulay makes a distinction between a mace, that is \"an object whose percussion point is in the axis of the handle\" and a club, that is \"an object whose percussion point is shifted in relation to this axis\".\nThe Kanak called the \"bird beak\" club a \"turtle beak\".\nGallery\nFile:Two Kanak (Canaque) warriors holding weapons, New Caledonia.jpg|Kanak warriors holding clubs\nFile:Casse tête 2 nouvelle caledonie.jpg|Kanak mace with fungus head\nFile:Casse tête kanak.jpg|Kanak mace fungus type\nFile:Casse-tête bec d'oiseau kanak.jpg|Bird's beak club\nFile:Casse-tête bec oiseau.jpg|Kanak bird's beak club\nFile:Massue phallique.jpg|Phallic mace\nFile:Casse tête MHNT ETH AC NC 33 Nouvelle Calédonie.jpg|Kanak Mace\nSee also\n* Kanak\n* Melanesia\nReferences\nBibliography\n* John Charles Edler, Terence Barrow, Art of Polynesia, Hemmeter Publishing Corporation, 1990.\n* Roger Boulay, Casse-Tête et Massues Kanak, 2015.\n* Adrienne L.
