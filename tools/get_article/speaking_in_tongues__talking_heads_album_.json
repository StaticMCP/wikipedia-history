After their split with producer Brian Eno and a short hiatus, which allowed the individual members to pursue side projects, recording began in 1982. It became the band's commercial breakthrough and produced the band's sole US top-ten hit, \"Burning Down the House\", which reached No. 9 on the Billboard chart.\nThe album's tour was documented in the 1984 Jonathan Demme-directed film Stop Making Sense, which generated a live album of the same name. The album also crossed over to the dance charts, where it peaked at number two for six weeks. It is the group's highest-charting album on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number 15. It was also their biggest-selling album in Canada, where it was certified platinum in 1983.\nArtwork\nTalking Heads frontman David Byrne designed the cover for the general release of the album. Artist Robert Rauschenberg won a Grammy Award for his work on the limited-edition LP version, which featured a clear vinyl disc in clear plastic packaging along with three clear plastic discs printed with similar collages in three colors. Byrne has said, as a partial explanation of the album's title, \"I originally sang nonsense, and ... made words to fit that. That worked out all right.\"\nRelease\nOriginal cassette and later CD copies of the album have \"extended versions\" of \"Making Flippy Floppy\", \"Girlfriend Is Better\", \"Slippery People\", \"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\" and \"Moon Rocks\". The album was re-released in February 2006 as a remastered DualDisc. It contains the extended versions of the songs found on the original cassette, and includes two additional tracks (\"Two Note Swivel\" and an alternate mix of \"Burning Down the House\"). The DVD-A side includes both stereo and 5.1 surround high resolution (96&nbsp;kHz/24bit) mixes, as well as a Dolby Digital 5.1 version of the album, a new alternate version of \"Burning Down the House\", and videos for \"Burning Down the House\" and \"This Must Be the Place\" (videos are two-channel Dolby Digital only). In Europe it was released as a CD+DVDA two-disc set, rather than a single DualDisc. The reissue was produced by Andy Zax with Talking Heads.\nIn 2021, Rhino Entertainment re-released the album on sky blue vinyl.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Chicago Tribune\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Mojo\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Pitchfork\n| rev4score = 8.5/10\n| rev5 = Rolling Stone\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev6score =\n| rev7 = Smash Hits\n| rev7score = 9/10\n| rev8 = Spin Alternative Record Guide\n| rev8score = 7/10\n| rev9 = Uncut\n| rev9score = 9/10\n| rev10 = The Village Voice\n| rev10score = A−\n}}\nRolling Stones David Fricke lauded the album's crossover nature, calling it \"the album that finally obliterates the thin line separating arty white pop music and deep black funk.\" He elaborated that the songs are all true art rock yet avoid the genre's common pretensions with a laid-back attitude and compelling dance rhythms, making it an ideal party album. For The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau described the album as \"quirkily comfortable,\" opining that without Brian Eno the band's rhythms sounded less portentous but also less meaningful. He added that \"the disjoint opacity of the lyrics fails to conceal Byrne's confusion about what it all means\", but praised the second side of the LP.\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann said that the album saw the band \"open up the dense textures of the music they had developed with Brian Eno\", and that they were \"rewarded with their most popular album yet.\" He felt the additional musicians made the sound \"more spacious, and the music admitted aspects of gospel,\" particularly on \"Slippery People\" and \"Swamp\". He noted Byrne's \"impressionistic, nonlinear lyrics\" and lauded the return of his \"charming goofiness\", calling the music \"unusually light and bouncy.\"\nIn his book on funk music, Rickey Vincent describes Speaking in Tongues as \"deeply thumping funk disguised as modern rock.\"\nLegacy\nIn 1989, Speaking in Tongues was ranked number 54 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s. In 2012, Slant Magazine listed it as the 89th best album of the 1980s.\n\"Burning Down the House\" was later covered by Welsh singer Tom Jones with the Cardigans, on his album Reload, reaching number 7 in the UK Charts. It has also been covered by screamo band the Used, pop-punk band Paramore, pop rock band Walk the Moon, blues singer Bonnie Raitt and R&B singer John Legend. The song has also appeared in the movies Revenge of the Nerds, Nymphomaniac, 13 Going on 30, The Banger Sisters, and the TV series The Walking Dead.\n\"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\" has been covered by artists such as folk musicians the Lumineers and Iron & Wine, and indie rock band Arcade Fire. The song was also featured in the movies Wall Street and its sequel, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, Crazy, Stupid, Love., ''He's Just Not That Into You, Lars and the Real Girl, and the TV shows Little Fires Everywhere and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D..\n\"Swamp\" appears in the movies Risky Business, The King of Comedy and The Simpsons episode \"3 Scenes Plus a Tag from a Marriage\". \"Girlfriend Is Better\" appeared in an episode of the TV series Entourage. \"Slippery People\" appeared in the movie American Made and the TV series The Americans.\nIn 2022, the song \"Burning Down the House\" was used as a sample in the song \"Keep It Burning\" from Donda 2'' by Kanye West, featuring a performance by rapper Future. The song was removed from the album after a day and was released later that year on Future's album I Never Liked You, under the same name, but without the sample.\nTrack listing\nLP/early CD version\nCassette/later CD versions\n2006 DualDisc reissue bonus tracks\nPersonnel\nTalking Heads\n* David Byrne – vocals, guitars, keyboards, synthesizers, bass guitar, percussion\n* Jerry Harrison – keyboards, synthesizers, guitars, backing vocals\n* Tina Weymouth – bass guitar, synth bass, backing vocals, guitar\n* Chris Frantz – drums, backing vocals, synthesizer\nAdditional musicians\n* Wally Badarou – synthesizers (1, 6, 9)\n* Bernie Worrell – synthesizers (3)\n* Alex Weir – guitar (2, 6, 7, 8)\n* Steve Scales – percussion (1, 7)\n* Raphael Dejesus – percussion (4, 5, 8)\n* David Van Tieghem – percussion (5, 9)\n* L.
