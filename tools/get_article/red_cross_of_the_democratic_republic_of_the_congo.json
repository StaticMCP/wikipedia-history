It was founded by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and admitted to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in 1963. An unrelated earlier Red Cross society had existed in the Congo Free State under King Leopold II of Belgium's rule, and disbanded in 1909.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.croixrouge-rdc.org/ Official website]\n* [https://www.icrc.org/en/where-we-work/africa/democratic-republic-congo ICRC profile]"
