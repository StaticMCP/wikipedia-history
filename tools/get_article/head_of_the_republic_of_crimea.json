Person under 30 cannot be a head of the Republic.\nTerm of office is five years. Appointed by the State Council of the Republic on nomination of President of the Russian Federation. Interim Head of the Republic is appointed directly by President.\nThe current Head of the Republic Sergey Aksyonov was elected in 2014 and re-elected in 2019.\nHistory\nBackground\nThe Crimean Peninsula, historically part of Imperial Russia and later an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, was ceded in 1954 to Ukraine, which administered it until its annexation by Russia in 2014.\nUkrainian President of Crimea\nUnder Ukrainian rule, an equivalent post, named President of the Republic of Crimea (), was provided by the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Crimea (de facto a special statute), with jurisdiction over the autonomous city of Sevastopol too. The first presidential elections took place in 1994, won by the pro-Russian separatist Yuriy Meshkov (leader of a coalition named \"Russia\"), but on 17 March 1995 the Ukrainian parliament, as part of a wider process of reduction of the Crimean autonomy, unilaterally abolished both the statute and the post of President of Crimea.\nFrom Ukraine to the Russian Federation\nIn the immediate aftermath of the revolution of Dignity, on 27 February 2014, Russian special forces without insignia stormed the Crimean parliament. A few hours later, pro-Russian deputy Sergey Aksyonov came into the parliament, and asked some of the other deputies to come as well. After the deputies summoned by Aksyonov were let in by the Russian soldiers guarding the parliament building, two votes were held. The first one appointed Aksyonov as the new Prime Minister of Crimea, and the second called for a referendum on Crimea's secession from Ukraine. The results for both of these votes were unanimous. One week later, Aksyonov and other deputies held another vote, resulting in an appeal for Russia to annex Crimea.\nOn 16 March, a referendum on Crimea's status was held, with the results being overwhelmingly in favor of joining Russia. The next day, 17 March 2014, Crimea's newly installed authorities declared independence and requested to join Russia.\nOn the same day, Russia recognized the Republic of Crimea as a sovereign state.\n, Konstantinov, Putin and Chaly, signing the Treaty on Accession of the Republic of Crimea to Russia]]\nOn 18 March, the Crimean authorities signed the accession treaty to the Russian Federation, thus forming the Crimean Federal District, subsequently merged into the Southern Federal District.\nOn 11 April, the State Council of the Republic of Crimea consequently ratified a new constitution, providing for the post of Head of the Republic of Crimea, effective from 14 April of the same year.\nEligibility and authorities\nUnder article 62 of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, approved by the State Council on 11 April 2014 and entered into force the following day, any Russian citizen who has reached the age of thirty can take up the post, provided that he has not been subjected to restrictions on civil and political rights.\nFormally a head of state, the head of the republic is actually a governor, subordinate to the president of the Russian Federation; he oversees the executive, and has the right to legislative initiative in the State Council, which he can also convene exceptionally.\nFurthermore, under articles 61–65 of the Constitution, he:\n* appoints and dismisses, with the consent of the State Council, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, without prejudice to the possibility of simultaneously holding both posts, as well as the ministers and other senior officials of the Republic;\n* represents the Republic of Crimea in relations with the central government and other local authorities of the Russian Federation, as well as with foreign economic representatives; and signs treaties in the name of the Republic;\n* signs and promulgates the laws of the Republic of Crimea; and adopts presidential decrees.\nPresidential appointed officials\n* Prosecutor General: Natalia Poklonskaya, appointed by Sergey Aksyonov on 11 March 2014 (although the right of appointment has passed to the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, her mandate was confirmed ad interim on 25 March and definitively on 2 May 2014 by Yury Chaika, ending on 6 October 2016);\n* Representative to the Federation Council: Olga Kovitidi, appointed by Sergey Aksyonov on 15 April 2014;\n* Prime Minister: Yury Gotsanyuk, appointed by Sergey Aksyonov on 20 September 2019.\nFile:Natalia Poklonskaya August 2015 (cropped).jpg|Natalia Vladimirovna Poklonskaya\nFile:Kovitidi OF cropped.jpg|Olga Fyodorovna Kovitidi\nFile:Yury Gotsanyuk (2019-08-09).jpg|Yury Mikhailovich Gotsanyuk\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=2 |\n! rowspan=2 | Portrait\n! rowspan=2 | Name\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Political party\n! rowspan=2 | Election\n! colspan=3 | Term of office\n! rowspan=2 | Prime minister(s)\n! rowspan=2 |\n|-\n!
