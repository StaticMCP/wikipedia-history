The institute offers advanced educational programs for specialized Saudi talents in an academic format that ensures the sustainability and growth of traditional arts in the Kingdom.\nHistory\nPrince Bader bin Abdullah bin Farhan Al Saud, Saudi Minister of Culture, had approved the plan to launch the Royal Institute of Traditional Arts at the Royal Arts Complex in Riyadh on October 22, 2019, as part of the Art Academies Initiative that was announced within the first batch of the Ministry of Culture and the Quality of Life Program initiatives in March 2019. The Minister of Culture had earlier announced the commissioning of market studies to identify the need for academies, with the first one specializing in heritage and traditional arts and crafts.\nObjective\nThe Royal Institute of Traditional Arts preserves the national identity by teaching arts, enriching and encouraging traditional arts, further developing local talent, preserving tangible and intangible cultural heritage assets in the traditional arts field, contributing to preserving and protecting Saudi heritage, graduating qualified traditional art practitioners, raising awareness about the arts and raising the value of artists through programs carried out by them or through partnership with relevant sectors, teaching arts and crafts through accredited programs, in addition to striking academic partnerships with different universities to provide educational programs.\nTracks\nThe Royal Institute of Traditional Arts offers its educational programs across three tracks: apprenticeship programs, academic programs, and short courses. The institute offers the opportunity to study many subjects like the studies of traditional visual arts, such as textile and embroidery arts, material arts, construction arts, book arts, traditional performing arts, and traditional music, in addition to studies on museums, heritage, and antiquities.\nNew Identity\nIn February 2024, the Royal Institute of Traditional Arts announced its new identity and strategy entitled “Wrth.” The modern visual identity is inspired by the traditional arts of the Kingdom. It consists of Al-Sadu inscriptions, which is one of the most prominent handicrafts in the Kingdom. These inscriptions are used to express the identity of the Kingdom. It also includes the Rababah, one of the traditional musical instruments associated with traditional performing arts, and the flower inscription used in Saudi architecture and fashion, in addition to the formal interconnection and alignment that embodies the cohesion of the Kingdom's people. The seal of King Abdulaziz unifies these elements to indicate the high-ranking status of the traditional arts sector, its pioneers, and the attention accorded to it. At the heart of the logo is the word \"Wrth,\" which highlights the art of Arabic calligraphy, all of which are surrounded by the Muqassab Eqal (Zari Eqal), two swords, and a palm tree to represent authenticity and royalty.\nReferences"
