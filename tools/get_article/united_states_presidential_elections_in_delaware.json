The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become president, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

To the extent that a popular vote was held, it was primarily directed to filling the office of vice president.\nIn elections from 1792 to 1816, Delaware did not conduct a popular vote. Each Elector was appointed by the state legislature.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n! Winner (nationally)\n!
