It also lists important milestones in thermometry, thermodynamics, statistical physics and calorimetry, that were crucial in development of low temperature systems.\nPrior to the 19th century\n*  – Zimri-Lim, ruler of Mari in Syria commanded the construction of one of the first ice houses near the Euphrates.\n*  – The yakhchal (meaning \"ice pit\" in Persian) is an ancient Persian type of refrigerator. The structure was formed from a mortar resistant to heat transmission, in the shape of a dome. Snow and ice was stored beneath the ground, effectively allowing access to ice even in hot months and allowing for prolonged food preservation. Often a badgir was coupled with the yakhchal in order to slow the heat loss. Modern refrigerators are still called yakhchal in Persian.\n*  – Hero of Alexandria knew of the principle that certain substances, notably air, expand and contract and described a demonstration in which a closed tube partially filled with air had its end in a container of water. The expansion and contraction of the air caused the position of the water/air interface to move along the tube. This was the first established principle of gas behaviour vs temperature, and principle of first thermometers later on. The idea could predate him even more (Empedocles of Agrigentum in his 460 B.C. book On Nature).\n* 1396 AD – Ice storage warehouses called \"Dong-bing-go-tango\" (meaning \"east ice storage warehouse\" in Korean) and Seo-bing-go (\"west ice storage warehouse\") were built in Han-Yang (currently Seoul, Korea). The buildings housed ice that was collected from the frozen Han River in January (by lunar calendar). The warehouse was well-insulated, providing the royal families with ice into the summer months. These warehouses were closed in 1898 AD but the buildings are still intact in Seoul.\n* 1593 – Galileo Galilei builds a first modern thermoscope. But it is possible the invention was by Santorio Santorio or independently around same time by Cornelis Drebbel. The principle of operation was known in ancient Greece.\n* –1613 – Francesco Sagredo or Santorio Santorio, put a numerical scale on a thermoscope.\n* 1617 – Giuseppe Biancani publishes first clear diagram of thermoscope\n* 1638 – Robert Fludd describes thermometer with a scale, using air thermometer principle with column of air and liquid water.\n* 1650 – Otto von Guericke designed and built the world's first vacuum pump and created the world's first ever vacuum known as the Magdeburg hemispheres to disprove Aristotle's long-held supposition that 'Nature abhors a vacuum'.\n* 1656 – Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke built an air pump on this design.\n* 1662 – Boyle's law (gas law relating pressure and volume) is demonstrated using a vacuum pump\n* 1665 – Boyle theorizes a minimum temperature in New Experiments and Observations touching Cold.\n* 1679 – Denis Papin – safety valve\n* 1702 – Guillaume Amontons first calculates absolute zero to be −240&nbsp;°C using an air thermometer of his own invention (1702), theorizing at this point the gas would reach zero volume and zero pressure.\n* 1714 – Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit invented the first reliable thermometer, using mercury instead of alcohol and water mixtures\n* 1724 – Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit proposes a Fahrenheit scale, which had finer scale and greater reproducibility than competitors.\n* 1730 – René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur invented an alcohol thermometer and temperature scale ultimately proved to be less reliable than Fahrenheit's mercury thermometer.\n* 1742 – Anders Celsius proposed a scale with zero at the boiling point and 100 degrees at the freezing point of water. It was later changed to be the other way around, on the input from Swedish academy of science.\n* 1755 – William Cullen used a pump to create a partial vacuum over a container of diethyl ether, which then boiled, absorbing heat from the surrounding air.\n* 1756 – The first documented public demonstration of artificial refrigeration by William Cullen\n* 1782 – Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace invent the ice-calorimeter\n* 1784 – Gaspard Monge liquefied the first pure gas with Clouet producing liquid sulfur dioxide.\n* 1787 – Charles's law (Gas law, relating volume and temperature)\n* 1799 – Martin van Marum and Adriaan Paets van Troostwijk compressed ammonia to see if it followed Boyle's law.
