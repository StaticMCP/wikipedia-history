Once the regular season was complete, the NAIA sponsored a playoff to determine the year's national champion. A final poll was then taken after completion of the 2001 NAIA Football National Championship.\nPoll release dates\nThe poll release dates were:\n* August 21, 2001 (Preseason)\n* September 11, 2001 (Week 1)\n* September 25, 2001 (Week 3)\n* October 2, 2001 (Week 4)\n* October 9, 2001 (Week 5)\n* October 16, 2001 (Week 6)\n* October 23, 2001 (Week 7)\n* October 30, 2001 (Week 8)\n* November 6,

been held by only a select group of teams. Through the postseason poll of the 2001 season, the teams and the number of times they have held the #1 weekly ranking are shown below. The number of times a team has been ranked #1 in the postseason poll (the national champion) is shown in parentheses.\nIn 1999, the results of a postseason poll, if one was conducted, are not known. Therefore, an additional poll has been presumed, and the #1 postseason ranking has been credited to the postseason tournament champion, the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Team\n!style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Total #1 Rankings\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|Georgetown (KY)||21 (2)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||12 (1)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|||3\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|}\nReferences"
