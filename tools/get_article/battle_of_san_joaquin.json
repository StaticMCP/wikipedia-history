Nevertheless, Miramón went to San Joaquín, and encountered Degollado the next day, when the battle took place.\nConclusions\nThe victory went to the conservative side, who managed to disperse General Degollado's troops in the region. This ensured the safety of the city of Guadalajara, so Santos Degollado had to retreat in the direction of Morelia. Despite their side's victory in the battle, Medellin's supporters in Colima City were taken prisoner and shot by Daniel Larios (who was deputy from Colima to Congress), and the then secretary general of government Encarnación Reyes, who was also the mayor. Conservative Colonel Jose Maria Mendoza took charge of armed conservative forces stationed in Canyon Beltran, and returned with them to Guadalajara. They arrived on 30 December. Following a victory there, Mendoza became governor of Colima.\nWhen General Miguel Miramón entered Mexico City on 7 January, a series of triumphal receptions were made by the Conservative government. Among them was a hymn referring to the battles that Miramón had fought in Colima. There were fireworks at the National Palace, and singing of the national anthem, to which some verses had been added in Miramón's honor by Francisco González Bocanegra, the national anthem's writer.\n\"By Hon.
