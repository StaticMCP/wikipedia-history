Adam Pavlacka of NextGen said that the former console version's \"biggest strength lies in its realism. The lack of arcade play is going to turn off a lot of potential fans.\"\nIn one review, Air Hendrix of GamePro called the Nintendo 64 version \"a true title contender that every N64 gamer should check out.\" In another, however, he changed his tune and said of the same console version, \"There's a lot of flash and name recognition going on here, but this fighter doesn't have the iron will necessary to be a true champion.\" He later said of the PlayStation version in one review, \"If you're looking for a PlayStation boxing match, there's no better bout in town – with its improved in-depth features and controls, it even beats out its N64 counterpart and the Dreamcast's glamorous Ready 2 Rumble. It's no contest; KO Kings rules the console boxing ring.\" The Burn Out said in another review that the PlayStation version \"achieves its goal of creating a realistic boxing experience that's better than the original. Die-hard boxing fans are sure to dig the massive list of moves and combos. If you liked the first Knockout Kings, you'll definitely enjoy this one as well. But if you're looking for a game like Ready 2 Rumble, then you're stepping into the wrong ring.\"\nThe PlayStation version was a runner-up for \"9th Annual GamePro Readers' Choice Awards\" for \"Best Boxing Game\", which went to Ready 2 Rumble Boxing for Dreamcast. Said console version did, however, win the award for \"Console Sports Game of the Year\" at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
