He further consolidated his reputation with and The Battle of La Hogue, exhibited at the 1780 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition.\nThe scene shows a mounted Edward III leading his army across the River Somme in Northern France shortly before the Battle of Crécy in 1346 during the Hundred Years War. On the left of the picture are French forces on the opposite bank. To the right of the King are the knights of the English Army including his son and heir Edward the Black Prince. Above them is the Royal standard and other banners while English archers can be seen in the background.\nThe battle was a decisive victory for England over France and reflected the series theme of glorifying Edward's reign as one of triumphs. It was commissioned for a sum of six hundred guineas. It was exhibited at the 1792 Summer Exhibition, the same year West succeeded Sir Joshua Reynolds to become the second President of the Royal Academy. Today it remains part of the Royal Collection.\nSee also\n* ''Queen Philippa at the Battle of Neville's Cross, 1789 painting by West\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Black, Jeremy.
