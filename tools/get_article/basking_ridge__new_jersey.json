The tree was located on the historic graveyard of the local Presbyterian church. The tree was  high and had a trunk circumference of  and its lower branches were supported.

The tree has since been cut down as of April 26, 2017.\n* A specially designed experimental hospital was built in 1779 by local resident John \"Rebel Banker\" Morton with the help of Dr. James Tilton in the winter of 1779-80. The hospital was built with three wards, that held patients in its hub and each of the three wards held eight patients. Patient beds were oriented so that their heads were closest to the walls of the buildings. When temperatures fell, a \"fire was built in the midst of the ward, without any chimney, and the smoke circulating about, passed off through an opening about 4 inches wide in the ridge of the roof.\" Tilton described how the design of the building allowed infection to be fought using smoke, \"without giving the least offense to the patient, for it always rose above their heads, before it spread abroad in the ward.\" This hospital, which could accommodate up to 55 patients, provided an uncrowded but fully ventilated space in which those with infectious disease could be kept apart from those who were wounded.\n* The Bernards Township Municipal Hall was once owned by the Astors. The estate was built in 1912 by Samuel Owen of Newark, New Jersey.\n*The Brick Academy was built in 1809 as the Basking Ridge Classical School; its function was to prepare young men for the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University).
