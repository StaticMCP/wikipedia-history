The range lies south and east of the New York Mountains, southwest of Searchlight and west of Cal-Nev-Ari, Nevada. The range lies at the northeastern end of Lanfair Valley and reaches  in elevation at the summit of Hart Peak and 5580&nbsp;ft at Linder Peak. The mountains lie in a southwest-northeasterly direction. The Piute Range lies to the southeast.\nCastle Mountains National Monument is surrounded on three sides by the Mojave National Preserve, managed by the National Park Service.\nIt surrounds the Castle Mountain Mine Area, an open pit gold mine in the southern Castle Mountains owned by Canadian NewCastle Gold Ltd., who can excavate nearly 10 million tons of ore through 2025, though due to low gold prices mining has been suspended since 2001. The national monument proclamation states that after any such mining and reclamation are completed, or after 10 years if no mining occurs, the Federal land in the 8,340 acre Castle Mountain Mine Area is to be transferred to the National Park Service.\nDesignation and management\nIt was designated by President Obama on February 12, 2016, along with Mojave Trails National Monument and Sand to Snow National Monument also in  Southern California.\nOf the three it is the only one to be managed by the National Park Service, with the other two being placed under the control of the Bureau of Land Management and/or the United States Forest Service.\nSee also\n*List of national monuments of the United States\n*\n*\n**\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nps.gov/camo/index.htm National Park Service: official Castle Mountains National Monument website]\n*[http://californiadesert.org/project/castle-mountains-national-monument/ Campaign for the California Desert.org: Castle Mountains National Monument] — natural and cultural features.\n*[http://westernmininghistory.com/mine_detail/10310700 Site location of Castle Mountain Mine, adjacent south of Hart, California, at south region of Castle Mountains]"
