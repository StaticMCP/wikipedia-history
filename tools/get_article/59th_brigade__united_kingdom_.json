It was formed in September 1914 as part of the new army also known as Kitchener's Army and was assigned to the 20th (Light) Division, serving on the Western Front. It was popularly known as the 'Greenjacket Brigade' because it was composed of battalions of the King's Royal Rifle Corps and the Rifle Brigade, whose full dress uniforms were Rifle green.\nOrigin\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The newly-appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. Men flooded into the recruiting offices and the 'first hundred thousand' were enlisted within days. This group of six infantry divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. Recruits continued to arrive in large numbers, and Army Order No 382 of 11 September authorised a further six divisions (15th–20th), which became the Second New Army (K2). 20th (Light) Division began forming at Aldershot with the 59th, 60th and 61st Brigades.\nOrder of Battle\nThe brigade was composed as follows:\n*10th (Service) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps – disbanded 5 February 1918\n*11th (Service) Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps\n*10th (Service) Battalion, Rifle Brigade – disbanded 4–14 February 1918\n*11th (Service) Battalion, Rifle Brigade\n*59th Company, Machine Gun Corps – joined 3 March 1916; joined 20th Divisional MG Battalion 15 March 1918\n*59th Trench Mortar Battery – 59/1 Bty formed by 16 April 1916, 52/2 Bty by 25 April, and combined to form 59th Bty by 16 July\n*2nd Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) – joined from 23rd Brigade, 8th Division, 3 February 1918\nService\n20th (Light) Division crossed to France in July 1915 and completed its concentration in the area west of Saint-Omer by 26 July.

In the summer of 1917 the division adopted a comprehensive scheme for battalion identification signs worn on both sleeves. These were black geometric shapes, with 59th Bde using circles. Underneath, one, two, three or four bars indicated the battalion's seniority. 11th KRRC (the former 60th Foot) also wore a Rifle green diamond with '11' over '60th' in red on its helmet coverings.\nFootnote\nNotes\nReferences\n* Maj A.F.
