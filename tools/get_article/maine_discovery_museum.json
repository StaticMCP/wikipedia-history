Maine Discovery Museum is a member of the Association of Children's Museums.\nHistory\nIn 1996, Sean Faircloth had the idea for the Maine Discovery Museum and led the project through completion of a $4.5 million facility in 2001.  Then-Congressman John Baldacci said that Maine Discovery Museum “restored the heart” to downtown Bangor.  At that time, the Maine Discovery Museum was the largest children's museum outside Boston in New England.\nMDM boosts three floors of interactive exhibits, including its newest addition NANO, a permanent exhibit donated by NISE Network. NANO is an interactive exhibition of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. Hands-on exhibits present the basics of nanoscience and engineering, introduce some real-world applications, and explore the societal and ethical implications of this new technology. MDM was selected by the NISE Network to receive this donated exhibit valued at $50,000 in recognition of their work to educate in the field of science.\nCelebrating ten years in the community, the Maine Discovery Museum was named Nonprofit of the Year in 2012 by the Bangor Region Chamber of Commerce.\n}}\n*"
