      "text": "# Draft:2030 South Korean Presidental election\n\nThe 2030 South Korean presidential election is scheduled to be held on an undetermined date in 2030. Under the current South Korean Constitution, presidents are limited to a single five-year term. Consequently, incumbent President Lee Jae-myung is ineligible to seek a second consecutive term. This election will mark the tenth presidential election since the democratization of South Korea. The previous election, held in 2025, saw Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung win over People Power Party candidate Kim Moon-soo.\nPolitical Context\nThe political landscape leading up to the 2030 election is influenced by ongoing discussions regarding constitutional reform. President Lee Jae-myung has supported amendments to change the presidential term limit, proposing a system of two four-year terms instead of the current single five-year term. However, any such changes would not apply to the incumbent president due to Article 128 of the Constitution, which stipulates that amendments extending presidential terms \"shall not be effective\" for the president in office at the time of the amendment.\nElectoral System\nThe president of South Korea is elected via a single-round plurality voting system. The election administration is overseen by the National Election Commission (NEC).\nPotential Candidates\nAs of 2030, potential candidates have not yet officially declared their intentions. Nominees are expected to emerge from major political parties, including the Democratic Party and the People Power Party, as well as potential third-party or independent candidates.\nReferences"
