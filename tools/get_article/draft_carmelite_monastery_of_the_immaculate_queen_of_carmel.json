It is located in the Sarajevo neighborhood of Stup, at Mehe Porobića 83.\nHistory\nThe idea of building a Carmelite monastery in Stup dates back to 1988, when the then Archbishop of Vrhbosna, Marko Jozinović, invited Carmelite sisters from Croatia to establish a monastery in the parish of Stup. By 1992, a temporary chapel, library, kitchen, and eleven rooms for the sisters had been constructed. However, during the Bosnian war, the entire complex was mined and destroyed.\nAfter the war, efforts were made to clear the area of mines and to rebuild the monastery and church. In September 2000, eight Carmelite sisters arrived in Stup to re-establish the Carmelite community. On October 23, 2000, Cardinal Vinko Puljić celebrated Mass on the remnants of the destroyed church, thereby canonically establishing the Carmel in Stup, dedicated to the Immaculate Queen of Carmel.\nSee also\n* Discalced Carmelites\n* Archdiocese of Vrhbosna\nReferences"
