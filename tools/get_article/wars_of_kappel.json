The union was a rejection of Swiss leader Ulrich Zwingli's attempts at forced reformation.\nEvents\nIn 1529, after enlisting the help of the leaders of the forest cantons, Zwingli attempted to reform the cantons by force. However, the winning diplomacy of the Union forced the Protestants to not cross the border, postponing the conflict until 1531.\nSecond War\nThe canton of Zürich was the principal supporter of Zwingli and the movement of Swiss reformation. When they fought the Musso War against the Duchy of Milan, the member states of the Catholic Union refused to provide aid. Zwingli immediately sanctioned the Catholic cantons.\nReferences"
