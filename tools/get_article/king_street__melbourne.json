It is considered a key hub of Melbourne's nightlife and is home to many pubs, nightclubs, restaurants, and adult entertainment venues.\nPart of the original Hoddle Grid laid out in 1837, the road has become a main traffic thoroughfare connecting Southbank and North Melbourne through the city centre. King Street is named for Captain Philip Gidley King, the third Governor of New South Wales.\nGeography\nKing Street begins at Flinders Street and ends at the intersection of Hawke Street and Victoria Street in West Melbourne. Towards the northern end of King Street lay the Flagstaff Gardens, whilst the Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium and Crown Casino are at its southern tip. King Street becomes Kings Way south of Flinders Street.\nThe street was part of National Routes 1 and 79 until the city bypass road linking the Monash Freeway with the West Gate Freeway was completed. Crossing through Melbourne's main financial district, many of Melbourne's tallest office towers line King Street. The area was once lined with bluestone warehouses, some of which still exist to the present day.\nNotable buildings\nstood on the corner of Collins Street and King Street.]]\nThe street has many examples of modern architecture, some designed by Yuncken Freeman who also had their offices located on the street.
