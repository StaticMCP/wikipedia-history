They receive formal, written nominations from the general public at the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame, 1445 Wampanoag Trail, Unit 201, East Providence RI 02915.\nInductees\nNearly 800 men and women have been inducted into the Rhode Island Hall of Fame, representing all walks of life and areas of achievement, including Native Americans from the earliest days of the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.\nThis institution caused controversy when convicted felon Michael Flynn was inducted for 2024, causing an exodus of board members and one inductee to decline their invitation.\nPublications\n* Patrick T.
