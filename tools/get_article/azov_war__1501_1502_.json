The campaign ended with the defeat of the Tatars. As revenge, in the autumn of 1501, the Circassians raided the vicinity of the Azov Fortress. They stole the cattle and killed the chase. In response, in 1502, the Ottoman Turks organized a punitive campaign against the lands of the Circassians. But the campaign did not take place due to the death of the Kafsky governor.\nAftermath\nIn 1504, Şehzade Mehmed attempted to organize another campaign into Circassia. He demanded that Khan Meñli I Giray provide troops for the expedition. However, the campaign was called off because Mehmed was poisoned on his father's orders. After these setbacks, Circassia remained free from Turkish aggression.\nReferences"
