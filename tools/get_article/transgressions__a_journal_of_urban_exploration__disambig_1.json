Although only four editions were produced during its lifetime, one of these was a double-issue (nos 2/3). Its contents reflected the emergence of new forms of psychogeographical activity in the 1990s. A more playful and sensuous direction was charted, nodding more to the situationism of Asger Jorn than Guy Debord, with frequent allusions to the \"magico-Marxism\" current amongst British groups, such as the reformed London Psychogeographical Association. The first usage of the term \"magico-Marxism\" appears to have been in this magazine, in 1996.\nThe magazine also introduced the work of the Italian \"situationauts\" as well as various psychogeographical initiatives, some of which have a post-avant-garde insistence on \"ordinary lives\". The magazine was edited by Alastair Bonnett and published by Salamander Press, London. It ended publication in 2001.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://libcom.org/article/transgressions-journal-urban-exploration Transgressions archive at Libcom]"
