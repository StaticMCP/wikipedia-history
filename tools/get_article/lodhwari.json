Its population as of 1901 was 3,218, a majority of whom were Ahirs. There was a small bazar, which held markets twice per week, and an aided indigenous school. It had previously formed part of the estate belonging to Beni Madho Bakhsh, but it was confiscated after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and was held at the time by a Sikh Sardar.\nThe 1961 census recorded Lodhwari as comprising 29 hamlets, with a total population of 3,646 people (1,980 male and 1,666 female), in 803 households and 792 physical houses. The area of the village was given as 3,861 acres and it had a medical practitioner and a post office at that point.\nThe 1981 census recorded Lodhwari (as \"Lodhawari\") as having a population of 5,555 people, in 180 households, and having an area of 1,387.72 hectares. The main staple foods were given as wheat and rice.\nReferences"
