It was their final album, due to Steve Poltz's decision to pursue a solo career. It was a commercial failure.\nThe album's first single was \"War\". The album title is a reference to the 13-year journey it took the band to sign with a major label.\nProduction\nJewel cowrote \"Old Lover's House\", on which she also sang. The album contains two unlisted tracks.\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n|rev2score =\n|rev3 = The Indianapolis Star\n|rev3score =\n|rev4 = MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide\n|rev4score =\n}}\nThe Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph deemed the album \" jangly, twangy, hook-filled and quite compelling.\" The Los Angeles Times concluded that \"Poltz is one of the few rock writers who can be funny and sad in the same song... Most compelling, however, is 'The Ballad of Tommy & Marla', a song about a couple of speed freaks who lived unhappily ever after.\" The Tulsa World labeled Taking the World by Donkey \"the Knack with a sharper sense of humor, cooler guitar licks and no hope of success.\"\nThe Dayton Daily News noted that \"Suburbia\" and \"War\" \"filter social commentary through sarcastic humor.\" The Indianapolis Star concluded that, \"obscured in the humor and silliness is that the Rugburns actually are a talented, tight band capable of many styles... 'War' is a rough rocker, like Country Joe and the Fish gone to hell.\" The San Diego Union-Tribune complained that \"their folk-based alternative rock and Poltz's nasal vocals display limited range.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"each tune feels upbeat and drenched in California sunshine, but the subject matter underneath the pop exterior usually revolves around the themes of uncaring women and disillusionment along the same vein that Too Much Joy experimented with in the '80s.\"\nTrack listing\nReferences"
