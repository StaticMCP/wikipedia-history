Countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations typically exchange high commissioners rather than ambassadors. Though there are a few technical differences, they are in practice one and the same office. Since 1965 when the Maldives were granted independence from the United Kingdom, the British high commissioner to Sri Lanka has doubled as the (non-resident) British high commissioner to the Maldives (from 1982 to 2016, and since 1 February 2020) and as the British ambassador to the Maldives (1965 to 1982, and October 2016 to 2020).\nList of British high commissioners\nDominion of Ceylon\n* 1948–1951: Sir Walter Hankinson\n* 1951–1957: Sir Cecil Syers\n* 1957–1962: Sir Alexander Morley\n* 1962–1966: Sir Michael Walker\n* 1966–1969: Sir Stanley Tomlinson\n* 1969–1972: Sir Angus Mackintosh\nSri Lanka\n* 1972–1975: Sir Harold Smedley\n* 1976–1979: David Aiers\n* 1979–1984: Sir John Nicholas\n* 1984–1987: John Stewart\n* 1987–1991: David Gladstone\n* 1991–1996: John Field\n* 1996–1999: David Tatham\n* 1999–2002: Linda Duffield\n* 2002–2006: Stephen Evans\n* 2006–2008: Dominick Chilcott\n* 2008–2011: Peter Hayes\n* 2011–2015: John Rankin\n* 2015–2019: James Dauris\n* 2019–2023: Sarah Hulton\n* 2023–: Andrew Patrick\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-high-commission-colombo British High Commission Colombo]"
