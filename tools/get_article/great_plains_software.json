It was founded in 1981, went public in 1997, and was sold to Microsoft in 2001. Prior to its acquisition, it had 2,200 employees.\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 1981 by Joseph Larson, who also served as the company's first president. Doug Burgum, who later went on to become a future Governor of North Dakota and United States Secretary of the Interior, joined the company in March 1983 as a shareholder. Burgum provided seed capital for the company; he bought out its other investors in early 1984 and became its new president. Larson continued to serve as a company director until its acquisition.\nThe company grew to about 170 employees by 1987, and had around 290 employees by 1989. It earned about $300&nbsp;million in annual sales and had its IPO in 1997, after using the Internet to help it expand beyond North Dakota. In 1999 the company acquired Match Data Systems, a development team in the Philippines. In 2000, after several layoffs, it announced its acquisition by Microsoft for $1.1 billion. The purchase was completed in 2001.\nIts products were rebranded \"Microsoft Dynamics GP\" in 2005, part of Microsoft Dynamics 365 as of 2016.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20000828130757/http://www.greatplains.com/ Official website] (archived snapshot, as of August 2000)"
