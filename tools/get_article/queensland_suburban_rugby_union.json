The major \"Subbies\" trophy is the Barber Cup, awarded to the first grade premiers of the first division.\nThe Subbies competition has around 1000 players and 20 clubs competing in three divisions, spread across Brisbane spanning from Redcliffe to Beenleigh, and Wynnum to Ipswich. The competition is for amateur players, and provides another tier of rugby below the Brisbane premier club competition.\nHistory\nThe earliest predecessors of the sub-districts rugby union in Queensland were the Minor Rugby Union and the Sub-Junior Minor Rugby Union, which were founded in 1888 and 1890 respectively for second and third tier teams.\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\" font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"background:white; text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=100% style=\"border:1px solid white; vertical-align:bottom; padding:0; font-size:108%;\"|Premiership winners: 1994–2002\n|- style=\"background:white; border:1px solid white; vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; font-size:80%;\"\n|style=\"border:1px solid white;border-bottom:none;padding:0;\"|&nbsp;\n|style=\"border:1px solid white;border-bottom:none;padding:0;\"|Division 1 A Grade\n|style=\"border:1px solid white;border-bottom:none;padding:0;\"|Division 1 Reserve\n|-\n!\n! style=\"width:7.5em;\"| Norbert Byrne\n! style=\"width:7.5em;\"| Geoff R Pegg\n|-\n| 1994\n| Kenmore\n| Ipswich\n|-\n| 1995\n| Kenmore\n| Kenmore\n|-\n| 1996\n| Logan Workers\n| Ipswich\n|-\n| 1997\n| Logan Workers\n| Wynnum\n|-\n| 1998\n| Logan City\n| Ipswich\n|-\n| 1999\n| Logan City\n| Ipswich\n|-\n!\n!

Mirror Newspapers donated the Sunday Truth Shield for the competition which was contested by nine teams including the Commonwealth Bank, AMP, Bank of New South Wales, and Law Clerks. The Gold Coast Eagles joined in 1965, winning the competition that year and in 1966, and finishing second in 1967.\nThe competition was restructured after the 1993 season to provide a secondary level of rugby under the Brisbane premiership. Strong district and suburban clubs in Brisbane were grouped into a new suburban competition sponsored by Coca-Cola. Teams in the renamed competition's inaugural season in 1994 included Caboolture and Everton Park to the north, Kenmore and Ipswich to the west, Redlands and Wynnum to the east, and Beenleigh and Logan City to the south.\nMembership of the Subbies competition grew in the 1990s , Kenmore won the premiership in 1990 with several players from that team representing Qld in the  Sub Districts team playing against NSW .With an increase in corporate and university sides as well as teams formed by ex-students of schools. The growth in population of Brisbane led to the growth in the number of rugby clubs.\nWhen Coca-Cola's sponsorship ended after the 1998 season, the QSRU administered 47 teams representing 30 clubs in seven grades of competition spread across five divisions. Division I was composed of the Norbert Byrne Cup (1st grade), Geoff R. Pegg Cup (2nd grade), and Robert A. Tuckey Cup (Colts) competitions; with the club championship Sydney Cup awarded based on the best all round performance of the Division I clubs. The lower division competitions were the John Barber Cup (Division II), Edinburgh Cup (Division III), Ian Scotney Cup (Division IV), and Darwin V. Normanby Cup (Division V). A number of Division I clubs, however, had begun to experience problems in fielding a colts (under 20s) side.\nFrom 1999 onwards, due to insufficient teams for a stand-alone colts competition, the Subbies clubs began to play their colts sides in the Brisbane or Gold Coast competitions.\n2000–2019\nThe QSRU competition was reduced to four grades in 2000 when Ipswich and Logan City transferred to the Brisbane competition, Redlands relocated to the Gold Coast competition, and the QUT club folded. Wynnum and Everton Park, as the only former Division I clubs remaining, were merged into the lower division competitions.\nNew clubs, including the Black Rhinos and Brisbane Irish, were added in 2001 and the QSRU competition was restructured into three divisions. There were five grades in total, with the Barber, Pegg, Scotney, Wyatt, and Normanby Cups being contested. Promotion and relegation between the divisions was introduced in 2007.\nIn 2011, an under 19 representative Subbies team was selected to compete in the annual City v Country Carnival, however the QSRU has not been involved in administering colts rugby teams since then.\nThe QSRU had three divisions encompassing five grades of competition in 2014. In Division 2, the first grade Scotney Cup was incorporated into the Brisbane fourth grade competition for the 2014 and 2015 seasons to provide additional opposition teams, but was restored to a Subbies-only contest thereafter. Until 2012, the Wyatt Cup had been contested by the second grade teams in Division 2 but after four seasons without competition from 2013–2016, the trophy was re-purposed for an additional Division 3 competition in 2017.\nIn 2018 the Division 1 clubs were reduced to four in number—Caboolture, Goodna, Springfield and Wynnum—and to provide additional opposition the first and second grades played matches against clubs from the Sunshine Coast Rugby Union in the first half of the season.\nAt the completion of the 2018 season, the two Division 1 Grand Final teams - premiership winners Wynnum and Caboolture announced that they were leaving the QSRU competition, and would join the Sunshine Coast Rugby Union from the start of the 2019 season. The Queensland Suburban Rugby Union then had only one grade of competition within each of the three divisions in 2019 – the Barber Cup in Division 1, Pegg Cup in Division 2 and Normanby Cup in Division 3.\nRecent events\nThe Pegg Cup was not contested in 2020 and the Division 2 competition for men's teams was replaced by the inaugural women's competition in that year. The Women's Cup competition was played as twelve-a-side. Division 1 men's reserve grade was reinstated in 2021, with the Pegg Cup awarded as its competition trophy.\nCompetition structure\nThe Queensland Suburban Rugby is made up of three divisions as of 2021, structured as follows:\n:Division 1 (Men's)\n:* 1st grade – Barber Cup\n:* 2nd grade – Pegg Cup\n:Division 2 (Women's 12s)\n:* Women's Cup\n:Division 3 (Men's Friday night)\n:* Normanby Cup\nTeams\nClubs competing for the Queensland Subbies trophies as of 2021, are:\nBarber Cup:\n* Brisbane Irish\n* Goodna Gladiators\n* Ipswich Rangers\n* North Lakes Leopards\n* Redlands Mudcrabs\n* Riverside Rebels\n* Springfield Lakes Hawks\nPegg Cup:\n* Brisbane Irish\n* Goodna Gladiators\n* Ipswich Rangers\n* North Lakes Leopards\n* Redlands Mudcrabs\n* Springfield Lakes Hawks\n'''Women's Cup:\n* Brisbane Irish\n* Coomera Crushers\n* Logan City Saints\n* North Lakes Leopards\n* Redlands Mudcrabs\n* Brisbane Hustlers\nNormanby Cup'''\n* Brisbane Hustlers\n* Brisbane Irish\n* Ipswich Rangers\n* Logan City Saints\n* Southern Bay Cyclones\nRepresentative team\n}}\nA Queensland Suburban team is selected from players within the competition each year to play against other amateur representative sides.\nUntil the end of the 2011 season, an under 19 representative Subbies team was also selected to compete in the annual City v Country Carnival. An annual interstate match against NSW Suburban for the Barraclough Shield was played from 1966 to 2016.\n}}\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://qsru.com.au/ Queensland Subbies] official website\nQSRU club websites\nArchived websites\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}"
