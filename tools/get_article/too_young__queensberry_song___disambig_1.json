It was written by Swedish composer Eric Palmqvist and recorded for the deluxe edition of the group's debut studio album Volume I (2008). Production on the track was helmed by Erik \"Kid Crazy\" Nyholm and Pete Kirtley. A melancholic uptempo pop song, it is built upon 1980s synthesizer sounds. Lyrically, \"Too Young\" has the protagonist wondering whether her broken but still longed-for relationship fell apart because of their naivety and youth.\nThe song was released by Starwatch Music as the band's second single on 22 May 2008. It became their first top ten hit on the German Singles Chart and ranks among the band's highest-charting singles: It peaked at number five in Germany and reached the top 20 in Austria and the top 40 in Switzerland. In support of the single, Queensberry flew to Miami, Florida to film a music video for the track with director Markus Gerwinat. \"Too Young\" was later also included on Queensberry's second studio album On My Own (2009).\nCritical reception\nBeatblogger editor Andreas Krogull noted that the song discards \"the musty 60s retro style\" of previous releases in favor of \"fresh and uncompromisingly pop\" sounds. He found that \"Too Young\" catches \"the ear as a light, pleasantly spring-like pop number; melancholy and 80s echoes are well measured. Gabby and Anto, as the two dark-haired (and undoubtedly stronger vocally) Berries are called in fan jargon, share lead vocals, while Leo and Vici only play supporting roles this time. Unfortunately, there is no real recognition value, and the pretty but harmless composition could have used a little more bite. Otherwise you can't complain: the song is right.\" Artur Schulz from laut.de felt that \"Too Young\" was \"same ol'.\"\nLive performances\nOn 21 May 2009, \"Too Young\" was performed live for the first time during the finale of the fourth cycle of ''Germany's Next Top Model. On 22 May 2009, and 30 November 2009, the group performed the song at music event The Dome. \"Too Young\" was performed for the first time in the second line-up on 30 June 2010, on Wanna Challenge'' in Beijing, China. It has been featured on numerous other occasions, including the Radio Teddy birthday in Potsdam on 28 August and the IFA Sommergarten in Berlin on 4 September 2010.\nMusic video\n\"Too Young\" was filmed in various locations in Miami, including the southern extremity of South Beach.\nA music video for \"Too Young\" was filmed in various locations in Miami, Florida in April 2009, particularly South Beach, including the South of Fifth neighborhood and the Government Cut.
