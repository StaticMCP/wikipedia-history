Staunton teams played partial seasons in the 1894 Virginia League and 1914 Virginia Mountain League before the Presidents played as members the Virginia League from 1939 to 1942. The Presidents hosted home minor league games at Municipal Stadium. Staunton's use of the \"Presidents\" nickname corresponded to the city being the birthplace of President Woodrow Wilson.\nHistory\n1894 and 1914 seasons\nMinor league baseball began in Staunton, Virginia in 1894. The Staunton Hayseeds became charter members of the Virginia League. The Virginia League began play as an Independent level league and fielded six teams, with the Lynchburg Hill Climbers, Norfolk Clam Eaters, Petersburg Farmers, Richmond Bluebirds and Roanoke Magicians, joining Staunton in beginning league play.\nIn their first season of minor league play, the Staunton Hayseeds relocated during the season. On August 14, 1894, Staunton, with a record of 36–53 moved to Newport News-Hampton. Finishing with an overall record of 50–64, the combined team placed fourth in the final standings. Playing under managers George Ziegler, William Donovan and C.A. Gaussen, Staunton/Newport News-Hampton finished 21.0 games behind the first place Petersburg Farmers in the final standings. The 1894 team is also referred to as the \"Mountaineers.\" The franchise did not return to the 1895 Virginia League.\nMinor league baseball returned to Staunton, Virginia in 1914. On March 3, 1914, at a meeting in Lynchburg, Virginia, discussions began for the formulation of a six–team Class D level baseball league in the region. The league teams were tentatively slated to be based in the Virginia cities of Lynchburg, Danville, Charlottesville, Clifton Forge, Staunton and Covington, with a salary limit of $800 (per team) monthly. Lynchburg, was hesitant to commit because of a previous $700 lien on its territory, a result of a previous team in the Virginia League. The league was then formed at a March 12, 1914 meeting, without Danville and Lynchburg franchises. B.F. Donovan, of Clifton Forge, was elected league president. D. R. Ellis, of Covington, was elected as vice–president.\nThe Staunton \"Lunatics\" became charter members of the four–team Class D level Virginia Mountain League, before relocating during the 1914 season. The Lunatics were joined by the Charlottesville Tuckahoes, Clifton Forge Railroaders, Covington Papermakers in beginning 1914 league play. The league schedule began play on May 14, 1914.\nThe Staunton use of the \"Lunatics\" nickname corresponds with the Western State Hospital being located in Staunton in the era.\nPlaying at Charlottesville on opening day, May 14, 1914, the Staunton Lunatics were defeated by Charlottesville defeated 10–4 in their first game.\nOn July 1, 1914, the league announced the Staunton Lunatics were relocating to Harrisonburg, Virginia with a 15–22 record. Continuing play as the Harrisonburg Lunatics, the Staunton/Harrisonburg team finished last in the 1914 Virginia Mountain League standings in a shortened season. On July 25, 1914, Staunton/Harrisonburg team had an overall record of 26–32 when the Virginia Mountain League permanently folded. Led by managers Davy Crockett and Pat Krebs, the Lunatics finished 8.5 games behind of the first place Covington Papermakers (37–26) in the final standings of the shortened season. They were followed by second place Charlottesville (31–30) and third place Clifton Forge Railroaders (28–34) in the 1914 league standings.\nShortly after the Virginia Mountain League folded, there was an unsuccessful attempt to revive the league and the teams in August, 1914, headed by Buck Hooker, manager of the Clifton Forge Railroaders. However, following the collapse of the league, the Covington and Clifton Forge teams elected to play a 10–game championship series. Charlottesville did not return to play. The Railroaders captured the unofficial league “title,” winning 7 of the 10 games over Covington.\n.
