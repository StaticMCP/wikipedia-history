At the time this area was known as Astapura.\nThis peth, or district, is bordered by Kasba Peth and Somwar Peth. Areas of the peth suffered severe damage  during the Panshet dam floods of 1961. The temple of Trisund Ganapati and Omkareshwar as well as the Kamla Nehru hospital are located in this area. This district is famous for transportation business. This area also has the popular Juna Bazaar (Flea Market) on the banks of the Mutha river.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://wikimapia.org/686888/Mangalwar-Peth-Pune Mangalwar Peth, Pune (Wikimapia)]"
