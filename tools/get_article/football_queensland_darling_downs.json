The zone administers major regional areas including Toowoomba, Dalby, Roma, Charleville, St George, Goondiwindi and Stanthorpe. The premier men's soccer competition is the Football Queensland Premier League 3 − Darling Downs and the premier women's soccer competition is the Football Queensland Women's Premier League 3 − Darling Downs. Football Queensland Darling Downs also has a numerous variety of lower divisions for both men and women, as well as academy and junior competitions to develop soccer and fitness within the region.\nThe administrative zone traces its history to the Toowoomba British Football Association formed early in the 20th century with games played as early as 1906. The earliest mention of a regional association zone was in 1912 when the secretary of the association sought permission to erect post and mark out a field within Albert Park. The region has since been represented by of a variety of administrative councils representing sections of the contemporary zone. In 2021 as part of Football Queensland Future of Football 2020+ reforms, the region's councils were collated and renamed Football Queensland Darling Downs.\nGovernance\nThe earliest reference to a governing body is to the Toowoomba British Football Association in 1912.  Presumably this association was affiliated with the Queensland governing body.\nIn 2021 Football Queensland Darling Downs was created as an office and under the control of Football Queensland. Before 2021 local administration and decision-making was decentralised to regional associations including Football Toowoomba, Football Chinchilla, Football Stanthorpe and the South Burnett Soccer Federation.\nFootball Toowoomba\nThe first game of British Association football was played in 1906, and the first club was Newtown.  The same article suggests that by 1908 there were up to 5 teams in existence. During 1906, Newtown played a series of games under British Association rules at the Polo Grounds.  Opponents included Rangers Rugby Football Club (rugby union) and the Young Rangers (rugby union).  The game against Rangers Rugby Union team ended in a draw.\nIn 1906, the newly-formed Newtown club invited Brisbane club Milton to Toowoomba.  Milton \"won somewhat easily\" but in the return game in Brisbane Newtown won 4 – 2.\nIn 1907, the newly-formed City or Cities teams played Newtown at the Polo Grounds.\nBy 1909, there were 5 clubs and a 6-team competition – Newtown Hotspurs, Toowoomba City, Western Suburbs, Kleinton Rovers, Kleinton Rangers and Oakey.\nAn early reference to British Association Football was in March 1912, when Mr. Henry Smith, the Secretary of the Toowooomba British Football Association approached the Gowrie Shire Council seeking permission to erect posts and mark out a field within Albert Park.  The annual meeting of the Toowoomba British Football Association was also advertised in March 1912.\nIn June 1920, a Toowoomba representative side played the touring New South Wales side at the Athletic Grounds, Toowoomba.  The local side put in a \"creditable performance\" losing 2 – 0.\nIn August 1920, a game was played at the Athletic Grounds, Toowoomba between a Toowoomba representative side and sailors from HMS Renown. At the time, there were 4 teams in the Toowoomba competition – Diggers, Norths, Western Suburbs and Wanderers (from Cawdor).  Two Digger's players selected for this game played for Queensland. Percy Martin had represented Queensland before World War One, while Dugald French was a current Queensland squad member.\nA preview of the 1924 season indicated that definitely 4 and up to 6 clubs would participate in senior football.  The confirmed clubs were Diggers, Caledonians, Rangers and Toowoomba Athletic, with Waratahs and Willowburn Asylum also contemplating senior football.  Toowoomba Athletic and Waratahs were junior clubs stepping up to senior level.  Toowoomba Athletic played junior football as Scouts and it's possible they had some connection to the scouting movement.  Junior football was in existence and 2 clubs mentioned were Starlights and Tech Old Boys.  In addition, 7 schools were playing football.\nIn June 1925, the touring English FA side defeated a Toowoomba representative side 6 − 0 at the Toowoomba showgrounds in front of a crowd of 4,000.  In July 1925, after the English FA tour soccer was introduced to Warwick.\nBy 1938 there were 9 teams – Willowburn, Gowrie-Little Plains, Gomoran, Oakey, Sugarloaf, Southern Cross, Greenwood, Kingsthorpe and Rovers.\nIn September 1938 the touring Indian national team defeated Queensland 5–2 at Athletic Oval (now Clive Berghofer Stadium/Toowoomba Sports Ground) in Toowoomba.\nIn July 1939, Palestine defeated a \"weak\" Queensland team 13–3 in Toowoomba.\nAfter World War II\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Toowoomba Soccer Federation - 1949 Final Table\n|-\n!

It re-commenced in 1946 with the re-formation of the Acland & District Soccer Association which included a Toowoomba club as one of its 6 affiliated clubs.\nThe Toowoomba Soccer Association was re-formed in 1949 and had 4 affiliated senior clubs; Blue Stars, Cawdor Rangers, Valley and Willowburn.  In 1949 Valley won the first post World War premiership and Willowburn won the Knock-Out Cup defeating Valley 2 - 0 in the final.\nIn 1975 the Men's representative team of the Toowoomba & District Soccer Federation was given direct entry into the 1976 Ampol Cup.  The Ampol Cup became a State-wide competition having previously being limited to First Division clubs from Brisbane and Ipswich.\nIn May 2024 Willowburn celebrated the 75th anniversary of their formation (in 1949) with a gala dinner.\nWomen's Football\nToowoomba was a pioneer of Women's football in Queensland and Australia.  In June 1921 at about the same time that Women's football was commencing in Brisbane, clubs were also being formed in Toowoomba.  The first clubs were Toowoomba Rovers and Toowoomba Cities.\nIn July 1921, interest was growing in sending a Toowoomba ladies representative team to play in Brisbane, with the Toowoomba players training at the Showgrounds.\nA number of female footballers from Toowoomba have played for the Matildas, including Lana Harch and Karla Reuter.\nWinstanley Memorial Shield (Men)\nThe Winstanley Memorial Shield is a senior Men's pre-season competition held in memory of Ian David (Dickie) Winstanley, a talented Toowoomba footballer who died on 16 July 1961, aged 18, from injuries suffered in a car accident.  Winstanley played seniors at age 16, captained the Toowoomba Under 18 representative side and at age 18 captained the Toowoomba Under 21 representative side.  In 1960, Winstanley won Willowburn's best and fairest player award (the Stanley Prasser Memorial Trophy).\nWinstanley Memorial Shield winners\n* 1962 – Willowburn (1st)\n* 1963 – Willowburn (2nd) - defeated Tatersalls Rovers 4-3\n* 1964 – Tattersalls Rovers (1st)\n* 1965 – Willowburn (3rd) - defeated Rangers 4-2\n* 1966 – Willowburn (4th) - Willowburn (A) 4 defeated Rangers (A) 1\n* 1967 – Willowburn (5th)\n* 1968 – Willowburn (6th)\n* 1969 – Willowburn (7th) – defeated Rockville Rovers 1–0\n* 1970 – Queensland Agricultural College A (1st)\n* 1971 – Rockville Rovers (1st)\n* 1972 – Willowburn (8th) – defeated St Albans (the score is unknown)\n* 1973 – Rockville Rovers (2nd) – defeated Rangers 2–1\n* 1974 – Rockville Rovers (3rd) – defeated Aviation 2–1\n* 1975 – Rangers (1st) - defeated Aviation 6-1\n* 1976 – Rangers (2nd)\n* 1977 – Willowburn (9th)\n* 1978 – Wanderers (1st)\n* 1979 – Rangers (3rd)\n* 1980 – Wanderers (2nd)\n* 1981 – Wanderers (3rd)\n* 1982 – Wanderers (4th)\n* 1983 – Wanderers (5th)\n* 1984 – St Albans (1st)\n* 1985 – Wanderers (6th)\n* 1986 – DDIAE (1st)\n* 1987 – St Albans (2nd)\n* 1988 – Willowburn (10th) – defeated Wanderers 3–2\n* 1989 – Wanderers (7th)\n* 1990 – Wanderers (8th)\n* 1991 – Rockville Rovers (4th)\n* 1992 – Willowburn (11th)\n* 1993 – Dalby (1st)\n* 1994 – Not contested\n* 1995 – Not contested\n* 1996 – Not contested\n* 1997 – USQ (2nd)\n* 1998 – USQ (3rd)\n* 1999 – Not contested\n* 2000 – Not contested\n* 2001 – Not contested\n* 2002 – Not contested\n* 2003 – Not contested\n* 2004 – Not contested\n* 2005 – Not contested\n* 2006 – South Toowoomba (1st)\n* 2007 – West Wanderers (9th)\n* 2008 – Not contested\n* 2009 – South Toowoomba (2nd)\n* 2010 – Not contested\n* 2011 – Willowburn (12th)\n* 2012 – Willowburn (13th) – defeated USQ 5–1\n* 2013 – South Toowoomba (3rd)\n* 2014 – Willowburn (White) (14th) – defeated Willowburn (Black) 7–0\n* 2015 – Gatton (1st) – defeated Willowburn 5–4 after extra time.

In April 1930, the third annual meeting of the SBSA was held at the Home Creek Hotel, Tingoora.\nThis suggests the SBSA was formed in 1927 or 1928, then changed names to the Proston & District Soccer Association at the beginning of the 1935 season.\nOne of the earliest references to \"soccer\" is from July 1928, when 2 teams (a senior and junior team) from the Kingaroy Town Soccer Club visited Murgon for games.\nBy 1931, teams from eight towns were expected to affiliate for the season – Murgon, Byee, Proston, Hivesville, Stalworth, Memerambi, Haly Creek and Kingaroy.\nIn October 2021, the Nanango Soccer Club celebrated the 40th anniversary of their formation in 1980 at a COVID-postponed event at the Taras Hall in Nanango.\nFormer clubs\n* Abbeywood\n* Hivesville\n* Proston\n* Stalworth\nSenior Premiers and Grand Final winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
