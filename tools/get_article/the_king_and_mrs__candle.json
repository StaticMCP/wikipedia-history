It aired in 1954 and was directed by Arthur Penn and starred Cyril Ritchard and Joan Greenwood. Variety wrote \"the kind of tongue-in-cheek comedy which tv viewers rarely get to enjoy, and which in fact is extremely difficult to put over, was managed with considerable gusto.\"\nProduction\nNBC enjoyed great success with a musical transmission of Peter Pan and decided to musicalise The King and Mrs Candle. Elliott did the adaptation, and Ritchard and Greenwood reprised their roles, as did director Arthur Penn. Music was by Moose Charlop (who had composed for Peter Pan) and lyrics were by Chuck Sweeney. NBC publicised the musical by promoting songs from the soundtrack recorded by Tony Martin (\"Young Ideas\") and Eydie Gorme.\nSongs\n* \"Young Ideas\"\n* \"Absolutely Mad\"\n* \"We Must Fly\"\n* \"You're Lucky for Me\"\n* \"What Is the Secret of Your Success\"\nReception\nThe New York Times called it \"relaxing and enjoyable television\".\nVariety wrote \"For what it was the Philco show was a pleasant romp. As a musical comedy, King and Mrs. Candle was something less satisfying.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
