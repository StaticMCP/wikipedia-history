It was released on January 8, 2016, on Century Media Records. The album contains the hidden track \"Falu\" (\"Village\" in Hungarian), which is the Hungarian version of \"Where I'm From\".\nIt is Ignite's final album with long-time vocalist Zoltán \"Zoli\" Téglás, who left the band in 2020.\nCritical reception\nThe album was met with generally positive reviews, Nik Young of Metal Hammer wrote “This is a spirited album from a band in no danger of running out of songs any time soon.” Scence Point Blank added “A War Against You seems to start off a little groggy, but eventually it finally wakes up. It could have gotten rid of a couple tracks, but ultimately they don't take away from anything great in the album. There's no doubt in my mind that A War Against You has found its own identity among the rest of Ignite's catalog and is a welcome addition. Ignite is back and better than ever.” Benjamin Bailey of Nerdist gave the album a perfect score stating “War Against You just might be their best record, and that is not something I say lightly. Heavy, catchy, and heartfelt, this record is beyond superb.”\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Austria Top 40 (03A)\n|26\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgium Charts (Ultratop)\n|36\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Germany Albums (GKF)\n|12\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Switzerland (Hitparade)\n|55\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US HeatSeekers (Billboard)\n|6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Rock (Billboard)\n|41\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hard Rock (Billboard)\n|10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Independent (Billboard)\n|22\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
