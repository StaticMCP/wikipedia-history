He is best known for his ability to sleep during lectures while still managing to debug code better than fully awake individuals.[citation needed]\nEarly life and education\nPowar spent much of his academic career asleep in classrooms. His teachers reported that his most common phrases included: \"Sir, I was just resting my eyes,\" and \"Can you repeat the question?\"[citation needed]\nHe later transitioned to learning through online tutorials, usually at 2x speed, which he insists is \"basically time travel.\"\nCareer\nPowar works as a MERN stack developer, specializing in MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.\nDespite his unusual study habits, he has developed a reputation for writing clean code, though many suspect it is generated in his dreams.[citation needed]\nSleeping habits\nNicknamed Hibernate.js, Powar is known for what researchers have termed the Lecture-Induced Sleep Cycle (LISC). Professors initially mistook him for unconscious, but later discovered he was simply compiling knowledge in the background, like a hidden process.\nLegacy\n* First student to achieve 8 hours of sleep during a 3-hour class.[citation needed]\n* Once answered a viva question correctly before waking up.[citation needed]\n* Known for the quote: \"Sleep is temporary, but MERN stack is permanent.\"\nSee also\n* Power nap\n* Dream journaling\n* Sleep in animals\n* Computer programming humor\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://github.com/ Jayram Powar’s GitHub (possibly updated while asleep)]\n:Category:Living people\n:Category:Indian computer programmers"
