The novel was published on December 13, 2023, by the independent American imprint Timber Publishing. It is the first installment in the *Battle for Barrenwest* series and blends traditional Western motifs with epic fantasy elements.\nThe novel follows protagonist Tommy White, a lone traveler in the desert region of Barrenwest, as he becomes entangled in a mystical conflict involving cursed relics, ancient forces, and shifting alliances. The book has been released in multiple formats, including paperback, eBook, and audiobook, and is available globally through major retailers.\nSynopsis\nSet in the harsh and arid land of Barrenwest, the story centers around Tommy White, a mysterious drifter with a troubled past. As he wanders into the desolate frontier town of Ashfall, Tommy discovers a hidden conspiracy involving a mythical relic known as the \"Black Sun\"—a powerful artifact said to bestow godlike abilities upon its wielder.\nDrawn into a conflict between tyrannical warlords, ancient cults, and desperate villagers, Tommy must confront both physical and spiritual threats. His journey forces him to reckon with the ghosts of his past, the corruption of power, and the possibility of redemption in a lawless world where morality is as dry and cracked as the desert soil.\nThemes\nBattle for Barrenwest explores several core themes:\n* Myth and frontier: It reimagines the Western genre through a mythological lens, where the desert becomes a liminal space between reality and legend.\n* Power and corruption: The novel questions who deserves power, and whether anyone can wield it without consequence.\n* Redemption: Tommy's journey is one of self-reckoning, testing the limits of justice, forgiveness, and survival.\n* Magic realism: Although rooted in gritty realism, the story incorporates magical and mystical elements, evoking classic fantasy traditions.\nDevelopment\nAndré Rettedal developed the concept for *Battle for Barrenwest* over several years, inspired by his interest in both American Westerns and high fantasy storytelling. In interviews and social media posts, Rettedal has cited influences ranging from The Dark Tower series by Stephen King to classic Spaghetti Westerns and Norse mythology.\nThe book was published by Timber Publishing, a boutique publisher founded in 2023 with a focus on genre fiction. The manuscript was written in English, and as of 2024, translations into other languages are under consideration.\nPublication and formats\nThe book was officially released on December 13, 2023, in the following formats:\n* Paperback (ISBN 9798223186724)\n* eBook (available via Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play)\n* Audiobook (distributed on Storytel and other platforms)\nReception\nBattle for Barrenwest received generally positive early reviews from readers and genre enthusiasts. Reviewers have praised the book’s unique setting, character-driven plot, and atmospheric writing.\nSome notable feedback included:\n* \"A bold debut that fuses the grit of the Wild West with the grandeur of high fantasy.\"\n* \"Tommy White is an unforgettable protagonist—equal parts gunslinger and philosopher.\"\n* \"Fans of The Gunslinger, Dune, and The Witcher will feel right at home in Barrenwest.\"\nSales data is not officially available, but the book charted on niche fantasy platforms and was featured on independent genre blogs in late 2023 and early 2024.\nDistribution\nThe novel is distributed globally through:\n* [https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/battle-for-barrenwest-andr-rettedal/1144491835 Barnes & Noble]\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Barrenwest-Black-Andre-Rettedal-ebook/dp/B0D5JDNPF7 Amazon Kindle]\n* [https://books.apple.com/us/book/battle-for-barrenwest/id6474357730 Apple Books]\n* [https://www.storytel.com/sg/books/battle-for-barrenwest-the-black-sun-10692292 Storytel (Audiobook)]\nFuture\nAuthor André Rettedal has hinted at sequels and expansions set in the same universe.
