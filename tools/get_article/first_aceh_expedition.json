The expedition was launched as a punitive measure by the Dutch colonial authorities in response to perceived challenges to their control over the region and Aceh's resistance to Dutch interference in its affairs.\nThe campaign resulted in a Aceh victory. However, it was costly for both sides, with significant loss of life on both sides and extensive destruction of Aceh's infrastructure and economy.\nEarly in 1873, the American Consul in Singapore had discussions with an Acehnese emissary about a possible Acehnese-American treaty, which the Dutch saw as justification for intervention. In March 1873, the Dutch bombed the Acehnese capital Banda Aceh (Kutaraja) and in April they landed 3,000 troops led by Johan Harmen Rudolf Köhler. Having misjudged their Acehnese opposition, the Dutch were forced to withdraw losing Köhler and eighty men. They then established a blockade and Acehnese troops (estimates of whom range from 10,000 to 100,000) prepared for battle.\nThis was followed by the Second Aceh Expedition in late 1873.\nSee also\n*History of Indonesia\n*Second Aceh Expedition\nReferences\nSources\n*"
