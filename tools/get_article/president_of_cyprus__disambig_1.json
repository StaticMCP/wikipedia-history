The office was established by the Constitution of 1960, after Cyprus gained its independence from the United Kingdom.\nThe combination of the role of head of state and that of government is unique among member states of the European Union, making Cyprus the only EU state with a full presidential system of government.\nThe constitution, which was negotiated during the London and Zürich Agreements that divided power between the Greek Cypriot community and Turkish Cypriot community, requires the president to be a Greek Cypriot. Other requirements are that the officeholder must be over the age of thirty-five and elected directly in a two-round system. The president's term lasts for five years, and in accordance with the thirteenth amendment to the constitution, no person can serve more than two consecutive terms.\nNikos Christodoulides is the eighth and current president of Cyprus, having assumed office on 28&nbsp;February 2023.\nPowers and limitations\nAccording to the Constitution, the president of the Republic is the head of state, and is elected for a five year term through direct, universal and secret ballot.\nAmong the most important powers granted to the president of the Republic by the Constitution, are the power to put into effect laws passed by the House of Representatives or the right of veto to prevent legislation passed by the House from being enacted, if a given law concerns issues of the external policy, security and defence of the Republic, the right to refer such legislation back to the legislative body, as well as the right to refer it to the Supreme Court for the purposes of checking its constitutionality.\nIn addition, the president convenes the meetings of the Council of Ministers and draws up their agenda, while maintaining the right of veto for council meetings as well, provided that they concern issues of external policy, security and defence of the Republic, as well as the right to refer them back to the aforementioned body.\nToday, under the doctrine of necessity, the president appoints eleven ministers, who constitute the country's Cabinet, and with the exception of the powers reserved by the constitution explicitly for the president and vice president of the Republic, exercise the executive authority of the state.\nFurthermore, the Constitution grants the president the power to unilaterally appoint independent state officials and Supreme Court judges.\nThere are two ways for the president of the Republic to be removed from office. In the first case, they must be convicted by the Supreme Court for high treason, following prosecution by the prosecutor general and the deputy prosecutor general, which has to be approved by a resolution of at least three-quarters of members of parliament. In the second case, they must be convicted of a dishonorable offense or an offense of moral turpitude, following prosecution by the prosecutor general and the deputy prosecutor general, which has to be approved by the president of the Supreme Court.\nList of officeholders\n;Key\nElected unopposed\n† Died in office\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! rowspan=2| Name\n! colspan=3| Term\n! rowspan=2| Political Party\n! rowspan=2| Elected\n|-\n!
