However, other critics have offered alternate interpretations on whether it actually depicts romantic love between men or an idealization of male spirituality.\n* 1888: William Dorsey Swann, the first known person to self-identify as \"queen of drag\", and a group of men are detained in the earliest recorded arrests for female impersonation in the United States.\n* 1889: British writer and critic Alan Dale publishes in the US the novel A Marriage Below Zero, considered the first US novel that explicitly depicts a homosexual relationship, although it also started the trend of including tragic endings (many times by suicide) for its LGBT characters.\n20th century\n1900s\n* 1903: The Ariston Bathhouse raid takes place in New York City, which became the first recorded police raid against an LGBT venue in US history. As a result of the incursion, 26 men were arrested and 12 of them were prosecuted on sodomy charges.\n* 1906: American author Edward Prime-Stevenson publishes the novel Imre: A Memorandum in Italy, considered the first American gay novel in which the same-sex couple get a happy ending.\n1920s\n1922\n* The American silent movie Manslaughter, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, gets released. The film showed the first erotic same-sex kiss in the history of cinema.\n1924\n* The Society for Human Rights, established in Chicago in 1924, was the first recognized gay rights organization in the United States, having received a charter from the state of Illinois, and produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom. Society founder Henry Gerber was inspired to create it by the work of German doctor Magnus Hirschfeld and the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. A few months after being chartered, in 1925, the group ceased to exist in the wake of the arrest of several of the society's members. Despite its short existence and small size, the society has been recognized as a precursor to the modern gay liberation movement.\n1926\n* June 11: Police raids the lesbian bar Eve's Hangout, located in New York City, and arrests its owner, Polish feminist Eva Kotchever. Kotchever was deported after the incident and Eve's Hangout never opened again.\n1929\n* The Surprise of a Knight becomes the first American pornographic film to depict homosexual intercourse.\n1930s\n* One of the first crossdressing performers in the Southern United States, Sweet Evening Breeze, starts regularly performing on Saturdays in Lexington, Kentucky.\n1934\n* The Motion Picture Association starts enforcing the Hays Code, which in practice banned the representation of explicit LGBT characters onscreen, with the exception of those who were depicted as villains or criminals.\n1940s\n1947\n* June:  Lisa Ben (anagram of «lesbian») starts self-publishing in Los Angeles a small lesbian magazine called Vice Versa, considered the oldest recorded lesbian periodical in the United States.\n1948\n* Alfred Kinsey, a bisexual American sexologist, publishes his seminal work Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, which helped the homosexual male community gain more visibility.  The book states, among other things, that 37% of the male subjects surveyed had at least one homosexual experience, and that 10% of American males surveyed were \"more or less exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55\".\n1950s\n1950\nand Roy Cohn, who started a witch hunt against LGBT federal employees during the Lavender scare.]]\n* The Mattachine Society, founded in 1950, was one of the earliest LGBT (gay rights) organizations in the United States, probably second only to Chicago's Society for Human Rights. Communist and labor activist Harry Hay formed the group with a collection of male friends in Los Angeles to protect and improve the rights of gay men.\n* As part of the Lavender scare, a moral panic about homosexuals working in US federal agencies, the Senate launched an investigation in June 1950 into the government's employment of homosexuals. The results were not released until December, but in the meantime federal job losses due to allegations of homosexuality increased greatly, rising from approximately 5 to 60 per month. To address this supposed threat, Joseph McCarthy hired Roy Cohnwho later died of AIDS and who, like McCarthy himself, is believed to have been a closeted gay manas chief counsel of his Congressional subcommittee. Together, McCarthy and Cohn were responsible for the firing of scores of gay men and women from government employment, and they strong-armed many opponents into silence using rumors of their homosexuality.\n1951\n* The Black Cat Bar, located in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood, was the focus of one of the earliest victories of the homophile movement when in 1951 the California Supreme Court affirmed the right of gay people to assemble in a case brought by the heterosexual owner of the bar.\n1952\n* April: The American Psychiatric Association includes homosexuality in their diagnostic manual as a \"sociopathic personality disturbance\".\n* Christine Jorgensen was an American transgender woman who was the first person to become widely known in the United States for having sex reassignment surgery.

It was not until 1973 that a federal judge ruled that a person's sexual orientation alone could not be the sole reason for termination from federal employment, and not until 1975 that the United States Civil Service Commission announced that they would consider applications by gays and lesbians on a case-by-case basis.\n1955\n* The Daughters of Bilitis , also called the DOB or the Daughters, was the first lesbian civil and political rights organization in the United States. It was formed in San Francisco in 1955.\n1956\n* The Daughters of Bilitis starts the publication of The Ladder, considered the first nationally distributed lesbian magazine.\n1958\n* The first gay leather bar, the Gold Coast, opened in Chicago in 1958.\n* One, Inc. v. Olesen  is a landmark United States Supreme Court decision for LGBT rights in the United States. It was the first U.S. Supreme Court ruling to deal with homosexuality and the first to address free speech rights with respect to homosexuality. The ruling held that pro-homosexual writing is not per se obscene.\n1959\n* The Cooper Donuts Riot happened in 1959 in Los Angeles, when the lesbians, gay men, transgender people, and drag queens who hung out at Cooper Do-nuts and who were frequently harassed by the LAPD fought back after police arrested three people, including John Rechy. Patrons began pelting the police with donuts and coffee cups. The LAPD called for back-up and arrested a number of rioters. Rechy and the other two original detainees were able to escape.\n1960s\n1961\n* José Sarria ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1961, becoming the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States.

The law came into effect on January 1, 1962.\n* 11 September: The Rejected becomes the first documentary about homosexuality to be broadcast in American television, after it was broadcast by a local TV station in California.\n1962\n* The first article published in America that recognized a city's gay community and political scene was about Philadelphia, and was titled \"The Furtive Fraternity\" (1962, by Gaeton Fonzi) and published in Greater Philadelphia.\n1964\n* American film The Best Man, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner is released. It is the first US film to use the word \"homosexual\".\n1965\n* In April 150 gender non-conforming people came to Dewey's Coffee Shop in Philadelphia to protest the fact that the shop was refusing to serve young people in \"non-conformist clothing\". After three protesters refused to leave after being denied service they, along with a black gay activist, were arrested. This led to a picket of the establishment organized by the black LGBTQ population. Later, in May of that same year another sit-in was organized and Dewey's agreed to end their discriminatory policies.\n1966\n* The Compton's Cafeteria Riot occurred in August 1966 in  the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. This incident was one of the first recorded LGBT-related riots in United States history. It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco.\n* 21 April: Four activists from the Mattachine Society staged a \"Sip-In\" at Julius, a bar in Greenwich Village, to protest the NY State Liquor Authority's discriminatory policies against homosexuals.\n1967\n* 1 January: The Black Cat Tavern, one of the most well-known gay bars of its time, faces an extreme police raid just after midnight as many of the gay patrons share a New Year's kiss. This raid led to the later protesting against constant police harassment of gay people by hundreds of protestors on February 11 outside the Black Cat Tavern.\n* March:  The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled that it could no longer forbid bars from serving gay men and lesbians. This decision annulled a 30-day suspension imposed on Julius, a bar, in April.\n* September: The first issue of the magazine The Los Angeles Advocate is published. Two years later it changed its name to The Advocate and began to be distributed nationally. Today it is considered the oldest LGBT magazine still in publication in the country.\n* 24 November: The first bookstore devoted to gay and lesbian authors was founded by Craig Rodwell on November 24, 1967, as the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop. It was initially located at 291 Mercer Street.\n1968\n* 9 May: One of the biggest pre-Stonewall gay rights demonstrations occurs at Bucks County Community College in Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, when about 200 students protested against the decision made by the college's president to cancel a lecture by Richard Leitsch, president of the Mattachine Society of New York.\n1969\n.]]\n*28 June&nbsp;–  The Stonewall riots (also referred to as the Stonewall uprising or the Stonewall rebellion) were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay (LGBT) community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. They are widely considered to constitute the most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.\n*31 October&nbsp;–  Sixty members of the Gay Liberation Front and the Society for Individual Rights staged a protest outside the offices of the San Francisco Examiner in response to a series of news articles disparaging LGBT people in San Francisco's gay bars and clubs. The peaceful protest against the \"homophobic editorial policies\" of the Examiner turned tumultuous and were later called \"Friday of the Purple Hand\" and \"Bloody Friday of the Purple Hand\". Examiner employees \"dumped a bag of printers' ink from the third story window of the newspaper building onto the crowd\". Some reports state that it was a barrel of ink poured from the roof of the building. The protesters \"used the ink to scrawl 'Gay Power' and other slogans on the building walls\" and stamp purple hand prints \"throughout downtown San Francisco\" resulting in \"one of the most visible demonstrations of gay power\". According to Larry LittleJohn, then president of SIR, \"At that point, the tactical squad arrived&nbsp;– not to get the employees who dumped the ink, but to arrest the demonstrators. Somebody could have been hurt if that ink had gotten into their eyes, but the police were knocking people to the ground.\" The accounts of police brutality include women being thrown to the ground and protesters' teeth being knocked out.\n1970s\n1970\n(r), 1970]]\n* The modern gay movement for PRIDE and marriage equality in the United States began on the Minneapolis campus (U&nbsp;of&nbsp;M) of the University of Minnesota. James Michael McConnell, librarian, and Richard John Baker, law student, applied for a marriage license. Gerald R. Nelson, Clerk of District Court, denied the license because both applicants were men.\n* 17 March: The film The Boys in the Band, directed by William Friedkin, gets released. The film was one of the first American movies focused on gay characters and is now considered a milestone of queer cinema.\n* 28 June: The first Christopher Street Liberation Day parade takes place in New York City, celebrating the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots. Today, it's considered one of the first LGBT pride parades.\n1971\n*4 June&nbsp;– Members of the Gay Activists Alliance demand marriage rights for same-sex couples at New York City's Marriage License Bureau.\n*Jack Baker and Michael McConnell re-apply and are granted a marriage licence in Blue Earth County, Minnesota after discovering the county has no laws prohibiting same sex marriage.

Nelson that the state's statute limiting marriage to different-sex couples does not violate the U.S. Constitution. However this ruling did not invalidate the 1971 licence in Blue Earth County. Baker and McConnell appealed the verdict, but the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the appeal the following year.\n1973\n*1 January&nbsp;– Maryland becomes the first state in the U.S. to statutorily ban same-sex marriage. In the following two decades, other states joined Maryland in statutorily banning same-sex marriage, reaching almost the totality of US states by 1994.\n*24 June&nbsp;– The UpStairs Lounge arson attack occurred on June 24, 1973, at a gay bar located on the second floor of the three-story building at 141 Chartres Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the United States. Thirty-two people died as a result of fire or smoke inhalation. The official cause is still listed as \"undetermined origin\". The most likely suspect, a gay man named Roger Nunez who had been ejected from the bar earlier in the day, was never charged and took his own life in November 1974. No evidence has ever been found the arson was motivated by hatred or overt homophobia. Until the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, the UpStairs Lounge arson attack was the deadliest known attack on a gay club in U.S. history.\n* 9 November: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rules in Jones v. Hallahan that two women were properly denied a marriage license based on dictionary definitions of marriage, despite the fact that state statutes do not restrict marriage to a female-male couple.\n* 15 December: The American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.\n1974\n*2 April&nbsp;– Kathy Kozachenko becomes the first openly LGBT person to be elected to public office in the United States' history.

But when one of those married in Boulder tried to use it to sponsor his husband for immigration purposes, he lost his case, Adams v. Howerton, in federal court.\n1976\nin June 1978.]]\n* Harvey Milk became the first openly gay male non-incumbent elected in the United States (and the first openly gay person elected to public office in California), when elected as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\n* The Lincoln Legion of Lesbians was established in Nebraska, an early example of a lesbian organization in a rural state.\n* Gaysweek was founded as the first mainstream gay publication published by an African-American (Alan Bell).\n1977\n* The Supreme Court of New York rules in favor of transgender tennis player Renée Richards, who brought a lawsuit in order to compete in the female category of the US Open.\n* November: The 1977 National Women's Conference adopts a resolution which called for an end to discrimination against sexual minorities and to repeal any state law that restricted sexual relationships between adults.\n1978\n* Gilbert Baker designs the rainbow flag as a symbol of LGBT pride and hope, for the 1978 San Francisco Gay Freedom Celebration.\n* The San Francisco Lesbian/Gay Freedom Band was founded by Jon Reed Sims in 1978 as the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Marching Band and Twirling Corp. Upon its founding in 1978, it became the first openly gay musical group in the world.\n* November 27: Harvey Milk, the first openly gay male non-incumbent elected in the United States (and the first openly gay person elected to public office in California), is assassinated by Dan White.\n1979\n* 21 May; The White Night riots were a series of violent events sparked by an announcement of the lenient sentencing of Dan White for the assassinations of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and of Harvey Milk, a member of the city's Board of Supervisors who was the first openly gay male non-incumbent elected in the United States (and the first openly gay person elected to public office in California). The events took place on the night of May 21, 1979 (the night before what would have been Milk's 49th birthday) in San Francisco. Earlier that day, White had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the lightest possible conviction for his actions. As well, the gay community of San Francisco had a longstanding conflict with the San Francisco Police Department. White's status as a former police officer intensified the community's anger at the SFPD. Initial demonstrations took place as a peaceful march through the Castro district of San Francisco. After the crowd arrived at the San Francisco City Hall, violence began. The events caused hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of property damage to City Hall and the surrounding area, as well as injuries to police officers and rioters. Several hours after the riot had been broken up, police made a retaliatory raid on a gay bar in San Francisco's Castro District. Many patrons were beaten by police in riot gear. Two dozen arrests were made during the course of the raid, and several people later sued the SFPD. In the following days, gay leaders refused to apologize for the events of that night. This led to increased political power in the gay community, which culminated in the election of Mayor Dianne Feinstein to a full term the following November. In response to a campaign promise, Feinstein appointed a pro-gay Chief of Police, which increased recruitment of gay people in the police force and eased tensions. The SFPD never apologized for its indiscriminate attacks on the gay community.\n* 14 October: The first National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights takes place in Washington D.C., with an attendance between 75,000 and 125,000 people.\n1980s\n1980\n* Transgender people were officially classified by the American Psychiatric Association as having \"gender identity disorder.\"[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/transgender_activism.html glbtq >> social sciences >> Transgender Activism]\n1982\n* February 25 — Wisconsin becomes the first state in the nation to make it unlawful for private businesses to discriminate based on sexual orientation in employment and housing.

Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), is a United States Supreme Court decision that upheld, in a 5–4 ruling, the constitutionality of a Georgia sodomy law criminalizing oral and anal sex in private between consenting adults, in this case with respect to homosexual sodomy, though the law did not differentiate between homosexual sodomy and heterosexual sodomy. This case was overturned in 2003 by a case styled Lawrence v. Texas.\n1987\n* Barney Frank became the first member of Congress to voluntarily identify themselves as gay.\n1989\n* 30 May: San Francisco Board of Supervisors passes a domestic partnership registry ordinance, which is closely defeated by San Francisco voters as Proposition S on 7 November.\n* The rainbow flag came to nationwide attention in the United States after John Stout sued his landlords and won when they attempted to prohibit him from displaying the flag from his West Hollywood, California, apartment balcony.\n1990s\n1990\n* A modified domestic partnership registry ordinance is passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, and the ordinance is ratified by voters as Proposition K on 6 November.\n1991\n* June: Berkeley becomes the third city in California to create a domestic partnership registry for same- and opposite-sex couples.\n* December 17: The Minnesota Court of Appeals issues a ruling in the case In re Guardianship of Kowalski in which it gave the legal guardianship of an incapacitated woman to her lesbian partner.\n1993\n* 5 May: The Supreme Court of Hawaii sends the case of Baehr v. Miike to a trial court after ruling that the state same-sex marriage ban was presumed to be unconstitutional and that the State would need to demonstrate a compelling interest in denying same-sex couples the right to marry.\n* Brandon Teena was an American transgender man who was raped and murdered in Humboldt, Nebraska in 1993. His life and death were the subject of the Academy Award-winning 1999 film ''Boys Don't Cry, which was partially based on the 1998 documentary film The Brandon Teena Story''. Both films also illustrated that legal and medical discrimination contributed to Teena's violent death. Teena's murder, along with that of Matthew Shepard, led to increased lobbying for hate crime laws in the United States.\n* 30 November: President Bill Clinton signs a military policy known as \"Don't ask, don't tell\", which took effect on February 24, 1994. The policy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing closeted gay or bisexual service members or applicants, while barring openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons from military service.\n1994\n* \"Don't ask, don't tell\" was the official United States policy on military service by gays, bisexuals, and lesbians, instituted by the Clinton Administration on February 28, 1994, when Department of Defense Directive 1304.26 issued on December 21, 1993, took effect,\n* 21 March: Philadelphia, a film about a gay man who is dying of complications related to AIDS, wins two Oscars at the 66th Academy Awards.\n* September: Governor Pete Wilson from California vetoes a bill that would have legalized domestic partnerships in the state.\n1996\n* April: Rent, a musical written by Jonathan Larson about a group of friends during the AIDS crisis and now considered a queer musical classic, is performed for the first time.\n* 20 May: Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), is a landmark Supreme Court of the United States case dealing with sexual orientation and state laws. It was the first Supreme Court case to address gay rights since Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), when the Court had held that laws criminalizing sodomy were constitutional. The Court ruled in a 6–3 decision that a state constitutional amendment in Colorado preventing protected status based upon homosexuality or bisexuality did not satisfy the Equal Protection Clause. The majority opinion in Romer stated that the amendment lacked \"a rational relationship to legitimate state interests\", and the dissent stated that the majority \"evidently agrees that 'rational basis'—the normal test for compliance with the Equal Protection Clause—is the governing standard\". The state constitutional amendment failed rational basis review.\n* 21 September: As a direct result of the Baehr v. Lewin ruling of 1993, President Bill Clinton signs the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) into law, which banned the federal Government from recognizing same-sex unions.\n* 3 December: Judge Kevin Chang of Hawaii issues a ruling in Baehr v.

He was taken to Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colorado, where he died six days later from severe head injuries. Perpetrators Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson were arrested shortly after the attack and charged with first-degree murder following Shepard's death. Significant media coverage was given to the killing and to what role Shepard's sexual orientation played as a motive in the commission of the crime. Both McKinney and Henderson were convicted of the murder, and each received two consecutive life sentences. Shepard's murder, along with that of Brandon Teena, led to increased lobbying for hate crime laws in the United States.\n* Rita Hester was a transgender African American woman who was murdered in Allston,  Massachusetts in 1998. In response to her murder, an outpouring of grief and anger led to a candlelight vigil held the following Friday (December 4) in which about 250 people participated. The community struggle to see Rita's life and identity covered respectfully by local papers, including the Boston Herald and Bay Windows, was chronicled by Nancy Nangeroni. Her death also inspired the \"Remembering Our Dead\" web project and the Transgender Day of Remembrance.\n* 3 November: Hawaii and Alaska become the first U.S. states to pass constitutional amendments against same-sex marriage. As a result of this, the ruling in Baehr v. Miike was reversed. Other U.S. states followed suit and passed similar amendments in the following years, reaching a peak of 31 in 2012. For more information, refer to U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions.\n1999\n* The Transgender Pride Flag was created by American transgender woman Monica Helms in 1999.\n* Transgender Day of Remembrance was founded in 1999 by Gwendolyn Ann Smith, a transgender woman, to memorialize the murder of transgender woman Rita Hester in Allston, Massachusetts. Since its inception, TDoR has been held annually on November 20, and it has slowly evolved from the web-based project started by Smith into an international day of action. It is now observed annually on November 20 as a day to memorialize all those who have been murdered as a result of transphobia and to draw attention to the continued violence endured by the transgender community.\n* 22 September: Governor Gray Davis from California signs a domestic partnerships bill into law that provided limited rights for same-sex couples, which made California the first state to have a statewide domestic partnership scheme and the second to provide a registry for same-sex couples after Hawaii.\n* 20 December: The Vermont Supreme Court holds in Baker v.

Two of the defendants were convicted of second-degree murder, but not convicted on the requested hate crime enhancements. The other two defendants pleaded guilty or no contest to voluntary manslaughter. In at least one of the trials, a \"trans panic defense\"—an extension of the gay panic defense—was employed. Some contemporary news reports referred to her by her birth name.\n2003\n* Lawrence v. Texas,  is a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court. The Court struck down the sodomy law in Texas in a 6–3 decision and, by extension, invalidated sodomy laws in 13 other states, making same-sex sexual activity legal in every U.S. state and territory. The Court, with a five-justice majority, overturned its previous ruling on the same issue in the 1986 case Bowers v. Hardwick, where it upheld a challenged Georgia statute and did not find a constitutional protection of sexual privacy.\n* 18 November: The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts rules in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that same-sex couples have the right to marry, setting the start date for the ruling to take effect on 17 May 2004, to allow the legislature six months to modify state law if it chooses to.\n2004\n* Registered partnerships are legalized in New Jersey (12 January) and Maine (April).\n* February/March: A number of U.S. jurisdictions begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, including San Francisco, California (12 February), Sandoval County, New Mexico (20 February), New Paltz, New York (27 February), Multnomah County, Oregon (3 March) and Asbury Park, New Jersey (9 March). The licenses were later nullified (not necessarily in Sandoval County, New Mexico).\n* 17 May: Same-sex marriage becomes legal in Massachusetts after the legislature failed to take any action in the 180 days period given by the state's Supreme Court.
