The LISA program pledged to match funds received from the EPA dollar for dollar each year.\nMission\nThe ACE program was created to aid in the prevention and reduction of agricultural pollution. To achieve this, the program created 3 main goals:\n*  to reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural practices\n* to promote the implementation of nutrient management planning and use of reduced-risk pesticides and biological controls\n* to protect ecologically sensitive areas\nReferences"
