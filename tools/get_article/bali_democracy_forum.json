The forum was initiated by Indonesia in 2008 with the stated aim of fostering democracy, human rights, equality, and mutual respect.\nthere have been 11 forums, held each year since 2008. 58 nations have attended the forums, with some from outside the Pacific region, such as Yemen and Afghanistan. The forum has been the subject of controversy and has been boycotted by several groups because of the perceived lack of democratic ideals in Bali, the removal of direct elections for local bodies, and the banning of protests during the forum itself.\nBDF participants are encouraged to discuss democracy constructively, regardless of their own political taboos or restrictive standardization. The BDF encourages participants to share their experiences in accordance with the conditions of each country.\nHistory\nTen years after Indonesia began to reform its government, the BDF was founded. The BDF is an annual intergovernmental forum in which democratic development, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, is discussed.\nThe BDF was created out of a stated belief that the promotion of democracy is an integral part of Indonesia's foreign policy. The forum was initiated to help create a strong democratic architecture in the region by sharing experiences, best practices, and adhering to the principles of equality, mutual understanding, and respect.\nTo date, the BDF has sought to advance democracy throughout the Asia Pacific region by promoting economic and political development, peace and security, and human rights, which are the three pillars of the United Nations.\nDevelopment\nBDF I\nBDF I was held on December 10–11, 2008.
