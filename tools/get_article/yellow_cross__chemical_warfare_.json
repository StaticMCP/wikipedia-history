      "text": "# Yellow Cross (chemical warfare)\n\nYellow Cross (Gelbkreuz) is a World War I chemical warfare agent usually based on mustard gas (also known as sulfur mustard, HS, Yperite, or Lost, among other names).\nThe original Gelbkreuz was a composition of 80–90% of sulfur mustard and 10–20% of tetrachloromethane or chlorobenzene as a solvent which lowered its viscosity and acted as an antifreeze, or, alternatively, 80% sulfur mustard, 10% bis(chloromethyl) ether, and 10% tetrachloromethane. A later formulation, Gelbkreuz 1, was a mixture of 40% ethyldichloroarsine, 40% ethyldibromoarsine, and 20% of bis(chloromethyl) ether. In some cases nitrobenzene, also highly toxic, was used to mask the material's characteristic odour. French \"ypérite no.20\" was a similar mixture of 80% sulfur mustard and 20% tetrachloromethane.\nYellow Cross is also a generic World War I German marking for artillery shells with chemical payload affecting the skin.\nSee also\n* Green Cross (chemical warfare)\n* Blue Cross (chemical warfare)\n* White Cross (chemical warfare)\nReferences"
