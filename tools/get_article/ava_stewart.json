She represented Canada at the 2020 and 2024 Olympic Games.  Additionally she was a member of the bronze medal winning teams at the 2022 Pan American Championships and 2023 Pan American Games.\nEarly life\nStewart was born in Lebanon, Tennessee in 2005 to an American mother and a Canadian father. Her family moved to Bowmanville, Ontario in 2010. She began gymnastics when she was eighteen months old.\nGymnastics career\n2020\nStewart made her elite debut at Elite Canada where she finished third in the junior all-around behind Maya Zonneveld and Cassie Lee. As a result, she was selected to make her international debut at 2020 L'International Gymnix. While there, she was part of the Canadian team that finished fourth. Individually, she finished seventh in the all-around and won the bronze medal on the balance beam behind Americans Konnor McClain and Skye Blakely.\n2021\nStewart became age-eligible for senior competition in 2021 and made her senior debut at Elite Canada, which was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. She finished second in the all-around and on balance beam behind Ellie Black, first on floor exercise, and third on uneven bars behind Rose-Kaying Woo and Black. Stewart was scheduled to compete at the Doha World Cup in March; however, the event was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar. Stewart next competed at two Technical Trials where she finished second in the all-around behind Black at both. Stewart competed at the Canadian Championships where she once again finished second in the all-around behind Black. Additionally she finished first on uneven bars, second on balance beam behind Black, and fourth on floor exercise behind Brooklyn Moors, Black, and Lillian Bate.\nOn June 17, Stewart was officially named to Canada's 2020 Olympic team alongside Black, Moors, and Shallon Olsen. Had the Olympic Games not been postponed, Stewart would not have been age-eligible for the competition due to her 2005 birth year. Stewart made her senior international debut at the Olympic Games. The Canadian team finished tenth in the qualification round and did not advance to the finals.\n2022\nStewart competed at the 2022 City of Jesolo Trophy where she helped Canada finish third in the team competition.  Individually she qualified to and finished fifth in the uneven bars event final.  In July Stewart competed at the Pan American Championships where she helped Canada finish third as a team.\n2023\nStewart announced her verbal commit to the Minnesota Golden Gophers, starting in the 2024–25 season.\nIn early October Stewart competed at the 2023 World Championships where she helped the Canadian team finish twelfth in qualifications.  Later that month she competed at the Pan American Games.  On the first day of competition Stewart helped Canada win bronze behind the United States and Brazil.  Individually she qualified to the all-around, uneven bars, and balance beam finals.  During the all-around final she finished fifth.  During event finals she placed sixth on uneven bars and won bronze on balance beam behind Brazilians Rebeca Andrade and Flávia Saraiva.\n2024\nIn late June Stewart was named to the team to represent Canada at the 2024 Summer Olympics alongside Ellie Black, Cassie Lee, Shallon Olsen, and Aurélie Tran.\nAt the 2024 Olympic Games Stewart helped Canada qualify to the team final, where they ultimately finished fifth.
