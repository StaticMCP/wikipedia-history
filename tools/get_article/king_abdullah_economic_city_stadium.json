It is set to be a venue for the 2034 FIFA World Cup and has a proposed capacity of 45,700 people, where it will host fixtures in the group stage and round of 32.\nOverview\nKing Abdullah Economic City is a planned city in Rabigh Governorate, Mecca Province, Saudi Arabia. It was announced as a megaproject in 2005 by King Abdullah, and the city — including its stadium — was named in his honor. It is located in close proximity to Thuwal, almost 100 km north of Jeddah.\nDescription\nConstruction\nConstruction on the stadium is planned to begin in 2027 and its opening will take place in 2032. The primary architects hired to design the stadium will be AFL Architects based out of Manchester. AFL said the stadium will feature energy-efficient systems and green spaces as part of plans to prioritize the conservation of resources and the reduction of its ecological footprint.\nIts innovative design and organic aesthetic take inspiration from the adaptive growth of local Red Sea coral reefs. Developed as a multifunctional hub, the stadium emphasizes economic prosperity, environmental sustainability, and community integration. Beyond the stadium itself, the precinct will feature additional facilities, including three hotels, mixed-use spaces, and a sports clinic. The surrounding area seamlessly blends the stadium with public spaces, incorporating parkland, retail units, and other amenities.\nPost-2034\nAfter the World Cup, the main stadium will primarily serve as a venue for football matches, concerts, and exhibitions. The surrounding precinct will focus on fostering community engagement, featuring extensive green spaces that provide residents with opportunities to connect with nature.\nSee also\n* List of things named after Saudi kings\n* List of football stadiums in Saudi Arabia\nReferences"
