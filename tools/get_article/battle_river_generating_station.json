Formerly a coal-fired power station, the generating station transitioned off coal in 2021. Coal is provided by the Forestburg Collieries operated by West Moreland Coal, while natural gas is supplied by the Pembina Keephills Transmission pipeline.\nDescription\nUnits 1 and 2 were 32 MW coal-fired generating units that operated from 1954 until their retirement in 2000. Unit 3 supplied by Combustion Engineering and was commissioned late 1968 to early 1969 retired on December 31, 2019. Unit 3 was a 149 MW coal-fired unit that operated until its retirement on 31 December 2019. Unit 4 is a 155 MW unit that operates using 50% coal and 50% natural gas. Unit 5 is a 385 MW gas fired steam unit. Unit 4 is a candidate for future conversion to 100% natural gas.\nThe plant also features two large smokestacks, 161&nbsp;m (528&nbsp;ft) and 137&nbsp;m (450&nbsp;ft) in height.\nSee also\n* List of power stations in Canada\n* List of tallest structures in Canada\n* Coal in Canada\n* Natural gas in Canada\nReferences"
