It is the Space Force's counterpart to the Air Force Warfighting Integration Capability and United States Army Futures Command. It is headquartered at Washington, D.C.\nThe establishment of SWAC was ordered by Chief of Space Operations John W. Raymond. Originally planned as Space Warfighting Integration Center, Vice Chief of Space Operations David D. Thompson was tasked to focus with its establishment upon taking office. Raymond approved the organizational design of SWAC on  8 March 2021. It was activated on 5 April 2021.\nSWAC was criticized by the House Committee on Appropriations in a report as being duplicative of the Space Security and Defense Program (SSDP), refusing the $37 million budget request for the organization. It is expected to complete its first architecture study, which focuses on missile warning, missile tracking, and missile defense architecture.\nForce designs\n* Missile Warning and Tracking\n* Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI)\n* Space Data Transport\n* Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)\n* Tactical ISR\n* Space Domain Awareness (SDA)\n| officeholder_sort = Cox, Andrew D.\n| born_year         =\n| died_year         =\n| term_start        = 5 April 2021\n| timeinoffice      =\n}}\n|}\nReferences\nSee also\n* United States Army Futures Command\n* United States Space Force"
