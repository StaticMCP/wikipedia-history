Designed by noted Ohio architect Joseph W. Yost in the Richardsonian Romanesque style of architecture, it was built to serve as a Grand Army of the Republic memorial and the meeting hall of Dick Lambert Post No. 165 of the GAR. It later served as the meeting hall of the now long-defunct American Legion Post No. 59 as well as the Ironton city hall. After being abandoned by the city, American Legion Post No. 433 undertook the task of restoring the long neglected veteran's memorial. On September 19, 2012, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nOn May 28, 2014, demolition of the building began.\nSee also\n* Grand Army of the Republic Hall (disambiguation)\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Lawrence County, Ohio* Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/gar/ Library of Congress lists of GAR posts by state]\n*"
