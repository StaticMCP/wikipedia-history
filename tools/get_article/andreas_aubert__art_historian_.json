His elder brother Ludvig Mariboe Benjamin Aubert (1838-1896) became a jurist and professor. His sister-in-law was novelist Elise Aubert (1837- 1909).\nAubert married Martha Johanne Védastine Moe (1855–1933), daughter of Bishop Jørgen Moe (1813-1882) and sister of writer Moltke Moe (1859-1913).\nAndreas Aubert was a student at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry (1869–71), before he began to study theology. He studied theology cand.theol. (1877) and then worked as a teacher at Aars og Voss' skole (1878–1895). He was also employed as an art critic at Morgenbladet, Aftenposten and Dagbladet.\nAubert wrote extensively about Norwegian artist, Johan Christian Dahl, starting with an autobiography titled Professor Dahl. Et stykke af Aarhundredets Kunst- og Kulturhistorie in 1893.\nHis major works in art history were fundamental studies of the art of Johan Christian Dahl. Because of his work, he was awarded an annual government scholarship in 1895. He was able to stop teaching and became a professional art historian, critic, and researcher.\nAubert also championed Edvard Munch, Puvis de Chavannes, Arnold Böcklin, Max Klinger, Gabriel von Max, and Vilhelm Hammershøi. He described them as \"neurasthenics\", by which he meant that their art was oriented toward the psychological. Toward the end of the 19th century, he had an important role in restoring the legacy of German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich. The painter is now considered the leading artist of that period.\nSelected works\n*Professor Dahl.
