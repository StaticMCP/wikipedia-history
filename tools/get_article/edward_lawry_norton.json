He worked at Bell Labs and is known for Norton's theorem.\nHis areas of active research included network theory, acoustical systems, electromagnetic apparatus, and data transmission. A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Columbia University, he held nineteen patents on his work.\nEdward L. Norton is known for development of the dual of Thevenin's equivalent circuit, currently referred to as Norton's equivalent circuit.\nBiography\nEdward Lawry Norton served as a radio operator in the United States Navy from 1917 to 1919.\nHe attended the University of Maine for two years before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1922. He received a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1925.\nHe was interested in communications circuit theory and the transmission of data at high speeds over telephone lines. Norton began his telephone career in 1922 with Western Electric's engineering department, which later became Bell Laboratories.\nEdward Lawry Norton was one of the founders of the Acoustical Society of America at the Bell Laboratories Building in New York City on December 27, 1928.\nAfter the World War II, Norton worked on the circuits for the Nike missile control system.\nIn 1962, he was named an Institute of Radio Engineers fellow.\nIn 1963, Norton retired after serving as a head of the High Speed Data Terminals Department at Bell Lab in Holmdel Township, New Jersey.\nNorton died on January 28, 1983, in King James Nursing Home, Chatham, New Jersey.\nWork\nNorton and his associates at AT&T in the early 1920s are recognized as some of the first to perform pioneering work applying Thevenin's equivalent circuit and who referred to this concept simply as Thévenin's theorem. In 1926, he proposed the equivalent circuit using a current source and parallel resistor to assist in the design of recording instrumentation that was primarily current driven. This became known as Northon equivalent circuit.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
