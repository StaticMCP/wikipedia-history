It was renamed in 2023 along with several other ASHG awards in a new organizational policy that removed individual's names from awards in favor of descriptive names.\nAward recipients\nSource: [https://web.archive.org/web/20141003163707/http://www.ashg.org/pages/awards_pastrecipients.shtml#stern American Society of Human Genetics]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
