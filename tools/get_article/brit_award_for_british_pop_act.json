The accolade is presented at the Brit Awards, an annual celebration of British and international music. The winners and nominees were initially determined by the Brit Awards voting academy with over one-thousand members comprising record labels, publishers, managers, agents, media, and previous winners and nominees, but starting with the 42nd Brit Awards ceremony, the award is voted by fans.\nBoy band Five are the first winners of the category, while Westlife and Dua Lipa have the most wins, with two. The category was exclusively won by bands until 2006, when James Blunt became the first solo artist to receive the award. S Club 7 hold the record for most nominations without a win, with three. The current holder of the award is JADE, who won in 2025.\nHistory\nThe award was first presented as Best British Pop Act at the 2000 Brit Awards and was retired in 2006.\nIn 2021, it was announced that the category had been revived and renamed Best British Pop/R&B Act following the removal of gendered categories. This new iteration of the award was first presented at the 42nd Brit Awards and the winner is voted for by the public on TikTok alongside the three other genre categories (Rock/Alternative Act, Dance Act and Hip Hop/Grime/Rap Act).\nFor the 2024 Brit Awards, it was announced that Best British Pop Act would return as it split from R&B and the award for Best British R&B Act. The change follows criticism from many artists in the R&B community around the lack of representation in the category.\nWinners and nominees\nBritish Pop Act (2000–2006)\n]]\nwas the only solo winner of the award during its original tenure]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
