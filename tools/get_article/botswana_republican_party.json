It was founded in 2023 as a result of a split from the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) following a prolonged leadership battle between Butale and the BPF. This battle ultimately led to Butale's expulsion from the BPF and the foundation of the BRP. The Africa Report described the party as having \"Christian conservative leanings as Butale, a pastor, opposes homosexuality and the legalisation of abortion\". They participated in the 2024 Botswana general election, which was their first.\nElectoral history\nNational Assembly\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!Party leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Result\n|-\n|2024\n|Biggie Butale\n|3,212\n|0.38%\n|}}\n|New\n| 5th\n|\n|}\nReferences"
