It is managed by the Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Most of the hospital buildings are inside Ashfield District Council (town planning) area with some peripheral buildings falling under Mansfield District Council planning controls.\nHistory\n]]\nKing's Mill was opened as the 30th General Hospital of California, a military hospital, in 1942. The hospital housed 400 injured American personnel as well as German prisoners of war.\nPart of the site was used to accommodate Mansfield Secondary Technical School, taking students from 1945 housed in the Nissen huts that had been left by the US Army. It was officially opened by Sir Hubert Houldsworth, Chairman of the East Midlands Division of the National Coal Board on 22 June 1948. It later moved to new premises, becoming known as Sherwood Hall Secondary School.\nOther areas of the site were used to create King's Mill Hospital. The hospital was officially opened by Hilary Marquand, the Minister of Health on 17 September 1951. The Dukeries Maternity Centre was opened by the Duchess of Devonshire on 14 January 1975.\nNew facilities were procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2005. The works were carried out by Skanska at a cost of £300 million and opened in 2011. The design incorporated surface-solar energy heat recovery from an adjacent reservoir, which provides one-third of the heating and all of the cooling requirements for the complex. This involved submerging a grid of 140 stainless steel plates into the water at the deepest point, connected to the hospital via twin  pipes laid under the A38 dual carriageway road.\nAfter Maternity Services moved into a new Women and Children's Centre, the old Dukeries Maternity Centre was finally demolished in spring 2013.\nFacilities\nMillside Radio provides entertainment for patients via a Hospedia wired network from in-house studios run by volunteers. Established during 1989 in an attic room at the old Dukeries Maternity Centre, the station was officially opened by Jeremy Beadle in 1990. The studios later moved into the Trust's administrative building.\nThe ambulance station, operated by the East Midlands Ambulance Service, opened in 1981 is located nearby on the A38 road.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nhs.uk/services/hospitals/overview/defaultview.aspx?id=1057 King's Mill Hospital information page at NHS UK]\n*[http://www.millsideradio.co.uk Millside Hospital Radio]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050210024951/http://www.itsnottingham.info/hospKmc.htm Information on travelling to King's Mill]\n*[http://www.travelineeastmidlands.co.uk/scripts/webtriplanner.dll/journeys?dsttype=naptan&dstname=3300AS0579 Public Transport to King's Mill Hospital]\n*[http://www.travelineeastmidlands.co.uk/scripts/webtriplanner.dll/journeys?orgtype=naptan&orgname=3300AS0579 Public Transport from King's Mill Hospital]"
