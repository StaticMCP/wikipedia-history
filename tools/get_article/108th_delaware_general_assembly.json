Elections were held on the first Tuesday after November 1, and terms began in Dover on the first Tuesday in January. This date was January 8, 1935, two weeks before the beginning of the seventh administrative year of Governor C. Douglass Buck and the third administrative year of Roy F. Corley as Lieutenant Governor.\nCurrently, the distribution of the Senate Assembly seats comprises seven senators for New Castle County and five for each Kent and Sussex County. Likewise, the current distribution of the House Assembly seats comprises fifteen representatives for New Castle County and ten representatives each to the Kent and Sussex counties. The actual population changes of the county did not directly affect the number of senators or representatives at this time.\nIn the 108th Delaware General Assembly session, both chambers had a Republican majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Levi G.
