Brandenburg-Prussia was promised southern Swedish Pomerania up to the Peene river, which had just been conquered by Russia. In turn, Brandenburg-Prussia accepted Russia's annexation of Swedish Ingria, Estonia and Karelia, and agreed to pay 400,000 thalers to Russia. Southern Swedish Pomerania was to be administered by Brandenburg-Prussia until a definite ruling in a peace treaty was reached.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015523/http://www.ieg-mainz.de/likecms/index.php?site=site.htm&dir=&nav=&siteid=133&treaty=1374&lastsiteid=77&searchquery=&is_fts=1&filter_select=&filter_wt=&filter_id=&filter_l=&filter_p=&searchlang=de&searchstring=schwedt&date=&year_from=&year_till=&location= Scan of the treaty at IEG Mainz]"
