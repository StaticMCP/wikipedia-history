The alliance was led by the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) and the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC). It lost the 16 May 2006 legislative elections.\nOutcome\nThe electoral alliance was led by then-mayor political parties, the PRD (El Partido Blanco, The \"White\" Party) and the PRSC (El Partido Colorado, The \"Reddish\" Party), hence it was referred by its own organizers as the Pink Alliance (Pink being a combination of red and white).\nAfter the elections, the poor performance of the PRSC left it out so bad that it had one more chance (the 2008 Dominican presidential elections) to keep calling itself a major contemporary political party. Even its former presidential candidate, Eduardo Estrella, was first ousted (through alleged internal ballot bribery) and later left the party before the 2008 elections, on grounds of severe political differences.\nAfter the failed alliance, only the PRD and the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) were left as the de facto major political parties, changing the Dominican multiple party system to an effective two-party system."
