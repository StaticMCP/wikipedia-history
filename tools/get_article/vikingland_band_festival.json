The\nevent was founded in 1985 and is widely regarded as the midwest's biggest\nand most prestigious summer marching band competition. It is often regarded\nas the unofficial state championship for parade marching in Minnesota.\nThe parade features only marching bands. It does not include floats or\nother units commonly associated with parades. Bands march at a\nthree-block interval to prevent their music from blending together.\nAlexandria's extra-wide main street provides a venue for\nthe performances.\nA panel of six judges provides recorded feedback and scores for each band.\nPlacement awards are presented to every band, with the top band in each\nclass earning the distinction of Class Champion. The overall high\nscoring band of the day is named the Grand Champion. Each champion band\nis awarded a traveling flag to carry for one year. If a band wins its\nchampion title for three consecutive years, the band earns the right to\nkeep the flag. Caption awards are presented for the top wind section,\npercussion section and color guard in each class.\nOne band is named the \"People's Choice\" by a panel of non-professional\njudges.\nParticipants\nThe Vikingland Band Festival has drawn 95 different bands since its\ninception in 1985. Participants have come from seven different states\n(Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Colorado, South Carolina, South Dakota,\nMichigan), three Canadian provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan), and Norway (five times).\nAlthough many of the performing bands are experienced competitors with\nlong-standing traditions of excellence, the festival welcomes younger\nbands as well. Organizers believe the education, intensity, and\nsportsmanship can provide a valuable experience for any band.\nThe tradition of including non-competing \"honor bands\" in the parade was\nstarted in 1989 as a way to showcase a variety of marching styles.\nStyles represented have included foreign bands, military bands,\nbagpipes, drum and bugle corps, and percussion lines.\nHistory\nEight different bands have earned the title of Grand Champion:\nLong Prairie (1985)\nHenry Sibley High School (1986, 2018, 2019)\nLitchfield (1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1998)\nIrondale High School (1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996)\nPark Center High School (1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012)\nMankato 77 Lancers (2000, 2002, 2010)\nWaconia Marching Band (2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2016, 2022, 2025)\n728 Cadets (2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2023, 2024)\nNo awards were presented during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (online video format) nor in 2021 (live event with ratings-only format and no awards ceremony). Competition resumed in 2022.\nIn 1989 the festival began presenting traveling flags to the Grand Champion and Class Champion bands. A band can retire a flag in its honor by winning the title three consecutive years. Three bands have retired Grand Champion flags: Irondale (1993, 1996), Waconia (2006), and 728 Cadets (2015).
