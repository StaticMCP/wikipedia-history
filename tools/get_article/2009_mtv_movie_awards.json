Baron Cohen was dressed as an angel, and he was wearing only a jockstrap underneath his costume. In mid-flight, he was lowered upside-down from the rafters after an apparent problem with his wire harness. This caused him to land directly on top of Eminem in such a way that Baron Cohen's fully exposed buttocks area was positioned directly in Eminem's face. An apparently incensed Eminem angrily shouted \"You serious?\" and \"Are you fuckin' serious?!\" and then \"Get this motherfucker off me!\", demanding that his bodyguards and members of D12 remove Baron Cohen from atop him. After they aggressively shoved Baron Cohen away while he was still suspended in the air, Eminem and his entourage stormed out of the theater immediately. Baron Cohen then announced the winner of the Best Male Performance award (Zac Efron for High School Musical 3: Senior Year) while still hanging from harness wires above the audience. Eminem and Baron Cohen later claimed the event was staged and had been rehearsed extensively. Eminem claimed that after he \"stormed\" out of the theatre he went back to his hotel room and \"laughed uncontrollably for about three hours\". However, while the prank is widely accepted as being staged - at least on Baron Cohen's part - commentators have questioned as to how much (if at all) Eminem truly was in on the joke.\n* Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight earned the actor a posthumous award for Best Villain.\n* Kiefer Sutherland jokingly broke down in tears while presenting the MTV Generation Award to Ben Stiller.\n* Taylor Swift, Aziz Ansari, and Justin Timberlake acted in the cold open skit with Samberg.\nSneak Peeks\n*Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\n*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n*The Twilight Saga: New Moon\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
