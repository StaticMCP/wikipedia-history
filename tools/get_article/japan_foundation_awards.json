However, the nominated application for that year was carried over to the following year, and in 2021 four recipients were listed.\nDescription\nThe awards help to further the mission of the foundation in language and culture.\nTwo types of awards (the Japan Foundation Awards and the Japan Foundation Special Prizes) previously composed the Japan Foundation Awards. But these awards are integrated into “The Japan Foundation Awards” in three categories: \"Arts and Culture\", \"Japanese Language\", and \"Japanese Studies and Intellectual Exchange\" from 2008.\nRecipients\nJapan Foundation Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
