Later on, the Kaohsiung City Government combined the two museums to form the Kaohsiung Museum of Fisheries Civilization after obtaining a fund of NT$20 million from the Fisheries Agency.\nExhibitions\nThe museum is divided into four exhibition areas, which are:\n* Area A, for the far sea trawl fisheries zone, coastal and offshore fisheries zone, aquaculture zone\n* Area B, tuna exhibition zone\n* Area C, for the fisheries products processing zone, fisheries conservation and utilization zone\n* Area D, squid exhibition zone\nTransportation\nThe museum is accessible within walking distance southwest of Caoya Station of Kaohsiung MRT.\nSee also\n* List of museums in Taiwan\nReferences"
