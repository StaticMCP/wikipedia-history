It was formed in France on 1 February 1918 from the former 14th Army command.  It served exclusively on the Western Front and was dissolved on 19 January 1919.\nHistory\n17th Army was one of three armies (along with 18th Army and 19th Army) formed in late 1917 / early 1918 with forces withdrawn from the Eastern Front.  They were in place to take part in Ludendorff's German spring offensive.  The Germans had realised that their only remaining chance of victory was to defeat the Allies before the overwhelming human and matériel resources of the United States could be deployed. They also had the temporary advantage in numbers afforded by nearly 50 divisions freed by Russia's withdrawing from the war (Treaty of Brest-Litovsk).\nAt the end of the war it was part of .\nThe Headquarters was at St Amand until 6 April 1918, Douai until 1 May 1918, Denain until 18 October 1918 and Mons until start of the march back, reaching Zülpich for disbandment on 19 January 1919.\nOrder of Battle, 30 October 1918\nBy the end of the war, the 17th Army was organised as:\n{| style=\"float: right;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"font-size: 100%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:grey; color:black;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Organization of 17th Army on 30 October 1918\n|-\n|- style=\"background-color:grey; color:black;\"\n!
