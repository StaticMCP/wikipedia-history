Many components make up that spectrum, and vary greatly based upon the type of tea being prepared, and the cultural setting in which it is being prepared. This is often referred to as the tea ceremony, and holds much significance in many cultures, particularly in northwestern Europe and in eastern Asia. A complete, cohesive collection of tea ware makes up a tea set.\nComponents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Teaware (may be part of a Tea set)\n|-\n|  || Teapot || Used to steep tea leaves in hot water\n|-\n|\n|Tea kettle\n|Used to boil water\n|-\n|  || Teacup || Vessels from which to drink the hot tea (after the leaves have been strained).
