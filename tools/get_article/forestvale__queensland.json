The nearest government primary schools are Mitchell State School in neighbouring Mitchell to the south-east and Mungallala State School in Mungallala to the south-west. The nearest government secondary school is also Mitchell State School (to Year 10). However, the north of Forestvale is too distant from these schools for a daily commute, so other options are distance education and boarding school. Distance education and boarding schools are also the alternatives for secondary education to Year 12.\nAttractions\nThe Moondi shelter shed is at the end of Major Mitchell Road (). It is the site where the explorer Thomas Mitchell camped in 1846 while mapping an overland route from Sydney to Port Essington (now Darwin, Northern Territory). For the sesquicentenary in 1996, the  shelter shed was constructed with plaques, maps, and information about the expedition. It was officially dedicated on Saturday 18 May 1996.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
