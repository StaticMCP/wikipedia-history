Today this fishweir re-creation is located on dry land near what was once an early shoreline that existed when ocean levels were lower and before new land was made by fill of the Back Bay tidal estuary that began in the Colonial period.\nThe fishweir construction is based on archeological discovery of wooden stakes from fishweirs, including the Boylston Street Fishweir, that are still buried under the streets of the Back Bay, Boston.\nThe early fishweirs, fence-like structures of wood and brush, were built in tidal flats to catch alewife, smelt, and herring during the spring spawn.\nThe time of the spring fish spawn, and the beginning of new growing season, is traditionally considered the New Year for Wampanoag and Massachuset people. In traditional culture it is said that the fish return to spawn in the streams when “the oak leaf is as big as a mouse’s ear”.\nInitiators of the Ancient Fishweir Project include Gill Solomon, Sachem of the Massachuset Tribe;  Ross Miller; Dena Dincauze, archeologist; Ellen Berkland, Archeologist for the City of Boston; and Annawon Weedon and Jim Peters of the Wampanoag Tribe.\nAnnual building of the fishweir on Boston Common, the oldest public common in the country (1634), challenges assumptions of the history that is currently taught. Construction of the fishweir is supported by educational programs and teacher workshops in collaboration with Boston Children's Museum. Lectures and on-site music and dance performance events provide interpretation of the history for students and the public.\nSee also\n* Boston Children's Museum\n* Indigenous People's Day\n* Massachusett\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESlvZDOCUeU/ TEDx BeaconStreet video, In the place we now call Boston, Ross Miller]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130525005200/http://bostonmuseum.org/ The Boston Museum]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100702082530/http://www.huh.harvard.edu/collections/fof/newsletters/FOFFall07.pdf  article from Friends of Farlow Botany Library, Harvard University]\n*[http://www.aviewoncities.com/boston/bostoncommon.htm A View on Cities article on Boston Common]"
