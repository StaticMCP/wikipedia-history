Recipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters \"BEM\".\nThe honour is divided into civil and military medals in a similar way to the Order of the British Empire. Like the ribbons used for other classes of the Order of the British Empire, the ribbon of the British Empire Medal is rose-pink with pearl-grey edges, with the addition of a pearl-grey central stripe for the military division. While recipients are not technically counted as members of the Order, these medals are nevertheless affiliated with it.\nThe 1946 New Year Honours were appointments by many of the Commonwealth Realms of King George VI to reward and highlight good works by citizens of those countries, and to celebrate the passing of 1945 and the beginning of 1946. Recommendations for appointments to the Order of the British Empire were made on the nomination of the United Kingdom, the self-governing Dominions of the Empire (later Commonwealth) and the Viceroy of India. They were announced on 1 January 1946 for the United Kingdom, and Dominions, Canada, the Union of South Africa, and New Zealand.\nListed are the 1946 New Year Honours recipients of the British Empire Medal (BEM), divided into military and civil divisions.\nMilitary Division\nRank, name and number are shown.\nRoyal Navy\n*Regulating Petty Officer Joseph Luis Abraham, T.RNVR.11087.\n*Chief Petty Officer Albert Henry Abrahams, D/J.4185.\n*Petty Officer Wren Telegraphist Olive Annie Adlington, 20243, WRNS.\n*Petty Officer Sheikh Ahmed, 6936, RIN.\n*Chief Stoker William Aitken, P/K.60406.\n*Marine Anthony Francis Alcoe, CH/X115783.\n*Petty Officer Albert William Alderman, P/J.763.\n*Chief Petty Officer Stanley Ernest Hill Alexander, D/J.94522.\n*Temporary Chief Petty Officer Samuel John Allen, D/JX390251.\n*Stoker First Class Diver B.
