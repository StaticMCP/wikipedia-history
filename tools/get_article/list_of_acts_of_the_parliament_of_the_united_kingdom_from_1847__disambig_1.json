For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n10 & 11 Vict.\nThe seventh session of the 14th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 19 January 1847 until 23 July 1847.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n| or the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act 1847|public|7|23-02-1847|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for the temporary Relief of destitute Persons in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  authorizing the Advance of Money for the Improvement of Land by Drainage in Great Britain.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  for making Provision for the Treatment of poor Persons afflicted with Fever in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| or the Harbours Clauses Act 1847|public|27|11-05-1847|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act for consolidating in One Act certain Provisions usually contained in Acts authorizing the making and improving of Harbours, Docks, and Piers.}}\n|\n| or the Ten Hours Act|public|29|08-06-1847|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to limit the Hours of Labour of young Persons and Females in Factories.|note4= }}\n|\n| or the Irish Poor Law Extension Act 1847or the Poor Law Amendment Act 1847|public|31|08-06-1847|archived=n|An Act to make further Provision for the Relief of the destitute Poor in Ireland.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n| or the General Police (Scotland) Act 1847|public|39|21-06-1847|archived=n|An Act to amend an Act to enable Burghs in Scotland to establish a general System of Police, and another Act for providing for the Appointment and Election of Magistrates and Councillors for certain Burghs and Towns of Scotland.}}\n|  for amending the Law relative to private Lunatic Asylums in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  for amending the Constitution of Newfoundland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  to amend the Laws relating to Loan Societies.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for granting certain Powers and Authorities to the Van Diemen's Land Company.}}\n| or the Marriages Act 1847|public|58|02-07-1847|archived=n|An Act to remove Doubts as to Quakers and Jews Marriages solemnized before certain Periods.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for the Establishment of public Baths and Wash-houses.}}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  of making certain Railways in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  of the last Session to amend the Acts for promoting the Drainage of Lands, and for other Purposes;
