It was there that Édouard Leclerc and his wife Hélène decided to establish a space dedicated to contemporary art. The fund was created in 2011 and is chaired by Michel-Édouard Leclerc, son of the founders.\nIt was officially inaugurated on , in the presence of Hélène Leclerc, former Minister of Culture Jean-Jacques Aillagon, and featured its first exhibition, dedicated to the artist Gérard Fromanger, who was also in attendance.\nThe site\nIn 1986, the Leclerc hypermarket located in the large hall built to the northwest of the former Capuchin convent closed due to limited space, with a larger Leclerc center opening in the outskirts of Landerneau. Meanwhile, the convent had been listed as a monument historique in 1970, making major alterations to the site difficult. It was then that Édouard and Hélène Leclerc conceived the idea of revitalizing this emblematic site of Landerneau.\nThe outer walls of the former Leclerc hypermarket were clad in golden‑ochre Logonna stone, a regional microgranite, while the roof was covered in slate. The adjoining 17th‑century structures—including the former offices, courtyard, and chapel—were also restored.\nVisitors\nThe fund aims to make contemporary art accessible to the widest possible audience, particularly school groups. Around 125,000 visitors attended the exhibition dedicated to Joan Miró in 2013, and approximately 140,000 came to view the works of Alberto Giacometti in 2015.\nThe exhibitions are also accompanied by publications—initially through Éditions Textuel, and later through the fund’s own publishing house.\nExhibitions\nSince 2012, the Fonds Hélène et Édouard Leclerc pour la culture has hosted two exhibitions per year:\n* Gérard Fromanger – Périodisation 1962–2012, from 24 June to 28 October 2012.\n* Yann Kersalé – À des Nuits Lumière.
