On the morning of 11 March 1651, Polish troops led by Marcin Kalinowski and Liantskoroński clashed with Cossacks commanded by Ivan Bohun near Vinnytsia. Bohun employed hit-and-run tactics, taking advantage of his army’s cavalry to outmaneuver the Polish force. This combined with the difficult to traverse terrain of the area led to heavy Polish losses. The siege of Vinnitsa lasted until 20 March, during which the Cossacks successfully repulsed the attacks, using both fortifications and brilliant tactics. Attempts at negotiation failed, as the Cossacks refused to surrender Bohun and their weapons, and on hearing of incoming aid decided to continue defending. In the end, the Polish army, weakened and lacking in morale, retreated, avoiding total defeat by crossing the Southern Bug.\nThe number of Cossack troops is somewhat controversial as most sources claim that it was 3,000, but according to the Polish historian Sławomir Leśniewski, it was much more than the Crown army itself, i.e. more than 20,000.\nReferences"
