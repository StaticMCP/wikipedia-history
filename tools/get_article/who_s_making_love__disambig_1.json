It became one of the few singles Taylor would become primarily known for in the mainstream. The song featured the Stax house band, Booker T. & the M.G.'s, and Isaac Hayes (on keyboards). It was Taylor's best-selling single before the release of \"Disco Lady\" almost a decade later.\nAccording to Bettye Crutcher, the lyrics were inspired by the 1920s novelty song, \"Who Takes Care of the Caretaker's Daughter (While the Caretaker's Busy Taking Care)\".[https://archive.org/details/soulsvilleusasto00bowm/page/236   Rob Bowman, Soulsville, U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records, p. 163], Archive.org\nChart history\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1968–69)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Canada (RPM Top 100)\n|align=\"center\" | 7\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Hot R&B singles\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|}\nCover versions\n*Tony Joe White covered the song on his 1968 album Black and White.\n*Young-Holt Unlimited released a cover on the album Soulful Strut in 1968 and as a single in 1969 (#47 Canada), both on Brunswick Records.\n*The Blues Brothers released a cover version as a single in 1980, which reached number 39 on the US chart.\n*Christian McBride included the song in his 2013 album Out Here.\n*The Nation Funktasia covered the song on their 1991 album In Search of the Last Trump of Funk.\nReferences"
