Stewart is sometimes credited as Melvin Stewart or Mel Stuart.\nCareer\nStewart began his acting career in 1959 with small roles on television and in films. In the early 1960s, he appeared in the Broadway shows Purlie Victorious, The Hostage, The Cool World and Simply Heavenly.\nStewart's early career also included notable work as a voice actor. He provided the narration for \"Scenes in the City\", a long jazz composition with text by Lonne Elder and Langston Hughes that appeared on Charles Mingus' 1957 album A Modern Jazz Symposium of Music and Poetry. In 1961, Stewart recorded an album of Langston Hughes' poetry on Folkways Records titled ''Langston Hughes' The Best of Simple. He was also a member of the San Francisco-based improv group The Committee, with whom he performed on The Dick Cavett Show in 1969.\nStewart played roles in various television series including That Girl, Marcus Welby, M.D., The Bob Newhart Show, Good Times and Harry O''. One of his most memorable roles was as Henry Jefferson, George Jefferson's brother, in three seasons of the series All in the Family. In 1973, he co-tarred in the short-lived series Roll Out. The following year, Stewart directed two episodes of the short-lived series Get Christie Love! and costarred in On the Rocks. After that series was canceled in 1976, Stewart portrayed Marvin Decker in the Bewitched spinoff series Tabitha from 1977 to 1978.\nStewart starred on Scarecrow and Mrs. King as section chief Billy Melrose during the show's four-year run from 1983 through 1987, and continued guest-starring in both television and films. His last on-screen appearance came in the 1993 film Made in America.\nSide projects\nIn addition to acting and directing, Stewart was an accomplished jazz saxophonist. A longtime resident of San Francisco, he also taught acting at San Francisco State University. His students included actor Danny Glover.\nHe established the theater group Black Actors Now Through Unity (BANTU) and directed plays at the Center for African and African-American Art and Culture in San Francisco and the Black Repertory Theater in Berkeley, California.\nA third degree black belt in aikido, Stewart opened a dojo for inner-city youth in the Bayview district of San Francisco.\nPersonal life and death\nOn July 11, 1976, Stewart married Annie Dong.
