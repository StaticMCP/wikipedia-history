Political maneuvering by Fushimi's father, the Jimyōin-tō Emperor Go-Fukakusa, was a crucial factor in this choice.\nIn the year 1287 (Kōan 10, 10th month), in the 13th year of Go-Uda-tennōs reign (後宇多天皇十三年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (senso) was received by his cousin.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Fushimi is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).\nAfter this, there was a short period of time in which the two lines alternated power.  Two years later, the retired Emperor Go-Fukakusa ended his reign as Cloistered Emperor, and Fushimi took direct control.\nIn 1289, by making his own son (the future Emperor Go-Fushimi) Crown Prince, he increased the antagonism of the Daikakuji line.  In 1290, the family of Asawara Tameyori made an assassination attempt on the Emperor.\nDuring his reign, efforts were made by the noble families to defeat the government, but the power of the Bakufu increased.  In 1298, Fushimi abdicated and began his reign as cloistered emperor. Three years later, in 1301, the Daikakuji Line rallied and forced Emperor Go-Fushimi to abdicate.\nIn 1308, his co-operation with the Bakufu succeeding, his fourth son's enthronement as Emperor Hanazono took place, and he again became cloistered Emperor.\nDuring Fushimi's reign, the alternating plan for the Daikakuji and Jimyōin lines had not yet come into being, and the two lines fought each other for the throne.\n* 1313 (Shōwa 2, 10th month): Retired Emperor Fushimi shaved his head and became a Buddhist monk; and the power to administer the court of reigning Emperor Hanazono shifted to his adopted son, former-Emperor Go-Fushimi.\nIn 1317, former-Emperor Fushimi died; but his son, Emperor Hanazono, did not participate in formal mourning rites for him.  This was unprecedented; but this was rationalized with the explanation that Hanozono had become the adopted \"son\" of his older brother, former-Emperor Go-Fushimi.  Fushimi is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called Fukakusa no kita no misasagi (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.\nKugyō\nis a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Fushimi's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:\n* Kampaku, Nijō Morotada, 1287–1289\n* Kampaku, Konoe Iemoto, 1289–1291\n* Kampaku, Kujō Tadanori, 1291–1293\n* Kampaku, Konoe Iemoto, 1293–1296\n* Kampaku, Takatsukasa Kanetada, 1296–1298\n* Sadaijin\n* Udaijin\n* Nadaijin\n* Dainagon\nEras of Fushimi's reign\nThe years of Fushimi's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.\n* Kōan (1278–1288)\n* Shōō         (1288–1293)\n* Einin             (1293–1299)\nAncestry\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
