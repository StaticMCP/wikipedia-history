It is close to the A422 and the border with Oxfordshire.\nThe village was given by King Edward IV to the Company of Cooks in London, and has since been sold into private hands.\nThe parish church is St Augustine, a Grade II* listed building. The church dates back to the 13th century, though much restored in 1863. The church tower houses four bells, one of which dates back to the 14th century.\nThe village is home to Beachborough School, a private prep school established originally in Hampshire in 1910, but relocated to Westbury in 1942 in the manor house.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.westburyparishcouncil.gov.uk/ Westbury Parish Council]"
