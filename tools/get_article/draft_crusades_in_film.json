As depictions of the Crusades continue to appear in film, they naturally invite critics. In the article  \"Here and There, Now and Then: Portrayals of the Third Crusade in Film and how their Inaccuracies Encompass Contemporary Movements,\" Steven Anthony explores how filmmakers manipulate historical narratives, particularly those surrounding the Third Crusade to reflect contemporary values and ideologies. The article examines how various cinematic lenses influence the portrayal of historical events and he analyzes two film that depict specifically the Third Crusade.\nIn his article he discusses the films Al Nasser Salah Ad-Din and Kingdom of Heaven, both of which represent the Third Crusade which took place in 1187-1192, but the films do so in different ways. These films create parallels between historical events and modern concerns such as religious tolerance, intercultural dialogue, and inclusive national identity. while the portrayals often involve historical exaggerations, they raise questions about the limits of creative freedoms of film about historical events. The conversation often leads to that the films embellish the battle scenes and the significance of some historical characters and under-represent others.\nAnthony begins by emphasizing that films reflect the era it is being produced more than the era it takes place in. Both films he analyzed include events that are not chronological in terms of the Third Crusade which many critiques of these films stem from. While the film Kingdom of Heaven primarily focuses on the events leading up to Saladin's 1187 siege of Jerusalem, while Al Nasser Salah Ad-Din offers a depiction of the end of Saladin reign.\nWhile both of the films focus on the same general time of the Third Crusade, they emphasize different events because of the directors perspective and priorities of the films. Such film interpretations of the Third Crusade contribute to broader historiographical debates surrounding Christendom and the ethics and legacy of Crusading.\nArticles of Crusading in film\nDASSANOWSKY, ROBERT. “GENDERING THE CRUSADE: Female Types and Sexuality in Feature Film.” In Screening Transcendence: Film under Austrofascism and the Hollywood Hope, 1933-1938, 110–46.
