The peak is in California's Sequoia National Park.\nClimate\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Kaweah Queen is located in an alpine climate zone. Weather fronts originating in the Pacific Ocean travel east toward the Sierra Nevada mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the range.\nGallery\nto left]]\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
