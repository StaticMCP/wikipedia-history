LAC runs on the north–south ridgeline of Gurung Hill.\nThe Battle of Gurung Hill, along with Battle of Rezang La were collectively known as  in Chinese perspective.\nBackground\nThe Sino-Indian War broke out in 1962 over disputed border regions between India and China. Ladakh, with its high-altitude terrain and strategic locations, became a key battleground. The Chinese launched a series of attacks across the front, aiming to seize Indian positions in the region. Gurung Hill, located near the Spanggur Gap in Ladakh, was a vital position for both sides, offering a commanding view of the surrounding area and control over approaches into southern Ladakh. It became the target of Chinese assaults.\nPLA formed a company-sized task force, mostly from elements of 10th Infantry Regiment:\n*3 X squads of 4th Rifle Company\n*2 X squads of 5th Rifle Company\n*2 X squads of 6th Rifle Company\n*1 X squad of No.9 Border Defense Checkpoint\n*1 X sapper platoon, regimental sapper company  (18 men)\n*8 X flamethrower crews (16 men)\n*1 X general-purpose machinegun (7.62mm) crew (3 men)\n*1 X 57mm recoilless gun crew (3 men)\nDespite unspecified, it can be concluded the assault element contained 112 men in total as each squad contains 9 men. They were commanded by the Commanding Officer of the 4th Rifle Company, Captain Cao Furong (). Meanwhile, 2 batteries of 82mm mortars (12 guns in total) were deployed to support the assault element.\nThe Battle\nOn 18 November 1962, Chinese forces launched a determined attack on Gurung Hill. Indian forces, heavily outnumbered and lacking artillery support, faced overwhelming odds. However, the Indian Army employed innovative tactics to bolster their defenses, including the use of tanks airlifted into the Ladakh region, which played a critical role in the battle. The Indian Air Force carried out one of the most extraordinary operations of the war by airlifting AMX-13 tanks to the Ladakh front. These tanks helped solidify Indian positions at Gurung Hill and contributed to repelling Chinese forces. The Chinese launched several waves of attacks but faced stiff resistance from the Indian defenders. After the Chinese captured the \"No.16 Indian Post\", 15 Indian survivors}} of the forward locality had fallen back on their depth platoon and there were still 45 Indians standing.\nIn the eyes of India, in the face of fierce hand-to-hand combat and heavy casualties, Chinese forces were unable to capture the hill.\nAftermath\nThe battle had wider strategic implications, helping to stabilize the defense in the region.\nLegacy\nIn Chinese perspective, despite the victory at No.16 Indian Post, researchers of PLA Military Science Academy concluded the heavy casualties were mainly resulted from the following reasons:\n*The main attack point was chosen at the strongest point of breaching (frontal side), and the three minefields and Indian automatic fire kill zone increased casualties;\n*The front and rear edges and depth of the Indian minefield were not clearly identified;\n*The artillery range was not accurately measured, and the shells failed to hit the target;\n*Communication was interrupted due to internal reasons\n*the coordination of various arms was notably poor, therefore, no overall combat effectiveness was formed.\nIt can also be concluded that the Chinese significantly underestimated the number of Indian soldiers who were at the positions and the firepower Indian could provide from No.19 Post.\nIn Indian perspective, the Battle of Gurung Hill remains an important episode in the history of the Sino-Indian War, highlighting the role of determination and innovation in the face of overwhelming odds. It stands as a testament to the resolve of the Indian Army to defend its territory during one of the most challenging conflicts in its history.\nSee also\n* Sino-Indian War\n* Battle of Walong\n* Battle of Bum La Pass\nReferences\nNotefoot\nBibliography\n*\n*"
