Initially, incumbent president Óscar Carmona was due to face an opponent in General José Norton de Matos. However, the Salazar government subjected Norton de Matos and his followers to severe persecution. The intimidation progressed to the point that Norton de Matos pulled out of the contest just before election day. As a result, Carmona was reelected unopposed for a fourth consecutive term.\nElectoral system\nAccording to the 1933 Constitution of Portugal, a president is elected for a period of 7 years and whoever gets the more votes is elected as president. Candidates must be Portuguese citizens, older than 35, in full possession of their civil and political rights, and must have always had Portuguese nationality. Family members of the King of Portugal, up to the 6th degree, could not become presidents.\nVoters had to be 21 years or older and, for women they had to a) have secondary education or equivalent or b) be household heads, while, for men, they either a) had to prove they were able to read, write, and count or b) had been taxed at least 100 escudos.\nResults\nDe Almeida\n}}\nReferences"
