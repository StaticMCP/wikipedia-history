In July 1958 the military characteristics were approved for the new warhead and the design released. Two months later the requirement for a HAWK with a nuclear warhead was cancelled.\nThe warhead was briefly considered for the AAM-N-10 Eagle long-range air-to-air missile\nThe dimensions of the warhead were  wide by  long. It weighed  and used a proximity fuze.\nThe project was cancelled in June 1961.\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*"
