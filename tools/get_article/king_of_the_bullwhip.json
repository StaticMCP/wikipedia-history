The screenplay was cowritten by Jack Lewis and associate producer Ira S. Webb. The film was shot at the Iverson Movie Ranch.\nPlot\nMarshal Lash La Rue and deputy marshal Fuzzy Jones are sent to stop a gang led by bullwhip-wielding masked bandit El Azote, who is terrorizing the area with murder and armed robbery. Ambushed by a group of seven riders, Lash and Fuzzy evade them and travel to Tioga City. Upon arrival, Lash notices that the local newspaper has informed the town of the arrival of a marshal and deputy. This leads Lash to believe that someone at the newspaper published the information arrival in order to kill them.\nAfter a fight in a saloon in which Lash uses his whip on a thug, he meets Benson, the owner of the saloon. Lash informs Benson that they were waylaid by a gang of men and that they saw the bodies of a marshal and his deputy whom they had buried. Benson notices Lash's prowess with a bullwhip in the fight and schemes to dress Lash as El Azote to reap a profit and cast the blame on El Azote.\nEventually Lash's and Fuzzy's true identities as lawmen are discovered. They are captured, disarmed and bound. Escaping their bonds by using their spurs, Lash and Fuzzy bring El Azote and his outlaw gang to justice; Lash uses his whip and Fuzzy uses his slingshot. Lash and El Azote have a bullwhip fight to the finish while Fuzzy meets Buffalo Bill Cody.\nCast\n*Lash La Rue as Marshal Lash La Rue\n*Al St. John as Deputy Fuzzy Q.
