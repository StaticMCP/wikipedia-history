The 2018 concert raised money for Salisbury District Hospital's STARS appeal, in particular the Pembroke Unit which is the specialist treatment centre for people with cancer and blood diseases from across south Wiltshire, north and east Dorset and west Hampshire.\nThe final Concert at the Kings took place in 2021.\nHistory of performing acts\n2012\nThe SAS Band, Brian May & Kerry Ellis, Mike & The Mechanics, Madeline Bell, Midge Ure, Tom Robinson, Chris Thompson, Patti Russo, Fabbagirls, Sweet, The Strawbs, The Dave Kelly Blues Band\n2013\n1st Act – Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Titch, 2nd Act – Georgie Fame, 3rd Act – The Blues Band, 4th Act – Dr. Feelgood, 5th Act – 10CC, 6th Act – The SAS Band ft.
