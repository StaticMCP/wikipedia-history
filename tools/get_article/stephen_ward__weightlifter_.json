The three medals were won during an unusual period when three medals were awarded in one category (clean and jerk, snatch and combined) which invariably led to the same athlete winning all three of the same colour medal. Four years later he won a snatch gold medal and two silver medals for England, at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  and he also competed at the 2002 Commonwealth Games.\nWard also competed at the world championships, most recently at the 2001 World Weightlifting Championships.\nReferences"
