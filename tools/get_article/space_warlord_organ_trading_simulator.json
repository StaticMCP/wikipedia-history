The game takes place in a far dystopian future where the player accrues power and wealth through the organ trade.\nGameplay\nSpace Warlord Organ Trading Simulator is centered around \"trading days\", that each only last a couple of minutes, in which the player has to deal with rival traders who are after the same organs, clients who want organs with specific properties, potential scammers, and random events. Fulfilling client requests adds to the player's reputation, which is the game's equivalent of XP, and the higher a player's reputation, the more the gameplay opens up.\nDevelopment\nSpace Warlord Organ Trading Simulator is compatible with the Kinect, a feature that was added \"just for the hell of it\". Lead designer Xalavier Nelson Jr. has offered a bounty of $50 to the first person to finish the campaign mode of the game entirely with the Kinect alone.  On February 10, 2023, user \"Swag Gucci Balenciaga Corndog\" on Steam completed this bounty and submitted proof of his run.\nThe game was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S on December 7, 2021, and on the Nintendo Switch on April 29, 2022. To celebrate the Switch release the game added cross-over content from the videogames Inscryption, Bugsnax and Among Us on all platforms.\nReception\nThe game received mixed reviews upon release, with the game having an aggregate score of 6.4 on Metacritic.  The game was praised for its soundtrack, which Nic Reuben from The Guardian described as \"incredibly stylish\" and \"one of the best of the year\". The game also received praise for its dark humor and storytelling, but was criticized for its shallow gameplay.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
