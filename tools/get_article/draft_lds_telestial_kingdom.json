It is a post-mortal kingdom of glory prepared for individuals who did not accept the gospel of Jesus Christ or repent of their sins in mortality or in the spirit world. Despite being the lowest kingdom, it is still considered a degree of glory and far surpasses mortal existence in happiness and beauty.\nDoctrinal background\nThe concept of the Telestial Kingdom originates in a vision received by Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon in 1832, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants Section 76. This revelation describes three degrees of heavenly glory: the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial Kingdoms, with the Telestial being the lowest.\nAccording to LDS doctrine, the Telestial Kingdom is reserved for those who:\n* Rejected the gospel of Jesus Christ\n* Did not repent in mortality or in the post-mortal spirit world\n* Lived sinful lives but did not become sons of perdition\nCharacteristics\nIndividuals in the Telestial Kingdom:\n* Will not be resurrected until after the Millennium is complete\n* Will inherit glory likened to that of the stars in brightness\n* Will be ministered to by the Holy Ghost, but will not dwell in the presence of God the Father or Jesus Christ\nAlthough this kingdom is for the unrepentant and wicked, Latter-day Saints teach that even the Telestial Kingdom is a place of immense glory and peace, far better than earthly life.\nInhabitants\nAccording to Doctrine and Covenants 76, the inhabitants of the Telestial Kingdom include:\n* “Liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and whoremongers”\n* Those who “loved and made a lie”\n* Those who refused to accept the testimony of Jesus\nThose who inherit the Telestial Kingdom will have suffered for their sins in spirit prison and will only be resurrected after others have been glorified.\nDistinction from outer darkness\nThe Telestial Kingdom is distinct from outer darkness, which is reserved for the \"sons of perdition\"—those who knowingly rebel against God after receiving a perfect knowledge of Him. Outer darkness is considered a state of no glory, unlike the Telestial Kingdom.\nComparison with other kingdoms\n* The Celestial Kingdom is the highest, for those who lived faithfully, received necessary ordinances, and endured to the end.\n* The Terrestrial Kingdom is for honorable individuals who rejected the fullness of the gospel but were not openly wicked.\nSee also\n* Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)\n* Degrees of glory\n* Afterlife (Latter Day Saints)\n* Outer darkness (Latter Day Saints)\n* Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)\nReferences"
