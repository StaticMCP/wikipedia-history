It is delimited by the East River on the west; Bridge Plaza North, the Long Island Rail Road and Northern Boulevard on the north; New York Connecting Railroad on the east; and Newtown Creek on the south.\nDemographics\nAs of the 2000 United States census, the Community Board had a population of 109,920, up from 94,845 in 1990 and 88,930 in 1980.\nOf these (as of 2000), 33,877 (30.8%) were non-Hispanic White, 2,158 (2.0%) were African-American, 29,380 (26.7%) were Asian or Pacific Islander, 184 (0.2%) were American Indian or Native Alaskan, 550 (0.5%) were of some other race, 3,732 (3.4%) were non-Hispanic of two or more races, and 40,039 (36.4%) were of Hispanic origins.\nGeography\nThe land area is .\nAncient Glacier Rock\nAncient Glacier Rock () is a glacial erratic in the Long Island City section of Queens, New York City.  Until the late 2010s, the street area next to it was largely ignored by city planners, unusable by car traffic, often surrounded by litter and used for parking for employees of a nearby business.\nIn April 2019, the New York City Department of Transportation made a proposal to the Queens Community Board 2 to convert it into a \"Street Seat area\" under the Street Seats program, which creates public areas for use in the warmer months.  The plan was approved and the area was opened later that year.\nFile:12 St 43 Rd boulder jeh.jpg|The erratic in 2011\nFile:Boulder 43 Rd 12 St sunny jeh.jpg|In 2011 the erratic was used for parking\nFile:Nyc ancientglacier loz DSC01198.jpg|A closer shot of the erratic in Jan 2024\nFile:Nyc ancientglacier loz DSC01196.jpg|A close up of the erratic in 2024\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nyc.gov/site/queenscb2/index.page Profile of the Community Board]"
