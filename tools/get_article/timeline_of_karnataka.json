The name can also mean 'land of black soil' (kari, 'black'; nadu, - 'area' or 'region') in Kannada. There are other possible roots of the name. The recorded history of Karnataka goes back to the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics. The capital of \"Vaali\" and \"Sugriva\" referenced in the Ramayana is said to be Hampi. Karnataka is mentioned in the Mahabharata as \"Karnata Desha\".\" Historically, the region was also called \"Kuntala Rajya\".\nKarnataka was also part of the Dakshinapatha (southern region) which is mentioned in many Indian epics. Vatapi, associated with the sage Agastya, is identified with Badami in Bagalkot district.\nKarnataka is situated on the western edge of the Deccan Plateau. It neighbours Maharashtra and Goa to the north, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Telangana to the northeast, and Tamil Nadu and Kerala to the south. On the west, it opens out on the Arabian Sea.\nPrehistory\nof Kavirajamarga praising people for their literary skills]]\nDuring 4th and 3rd century BCE, Karnataka was part of Nanda and Maurya Empire. The Brahmagiri edicts in Chitradurga dated around c.230BCE belongs to emperor Ashoka and says of the nearby region as \"Isila\", which means \"fortified region\" in Sanskrit. In Kannada \"Isila\" can mean \"To shoot an arrow\" (\"sila\" or \"sala\" means to-shoot and \"ise\" or \"ese\" means to-throw in Kannada). After Maurya, Shatavahana came to power in the north and Ganga in the south which can roughly be taken as the starting point of Karnataka in modern times. Kavirajamarga by Amogavarsha states Karnataka as the region between the Kaveri River in the south and the Godavari River in the north. It also says \"Kavya prayoga parinathamathigal\" (See Image) which means people in the region are experts in poetry and literature.\nStarting period\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| Starting period\n| Shatavahana\n| Semukha / Gouthamiputhra\n| Deccan comprising present Andhra, Karnataka, Maharashtra\n|-\n|}\nbuilt during Vijaynagar times.]]\nAround 3 BCE the Shatavahana came to power. The Shatavahanas ruled parts of northern Karnataka. They used Prakrit as the administrative language and they might belong to Karnataka. Semukha and Gouthamiputhra Shatakarni were important rulers. The empire lasted for almost 300 years. With the disintegration of Shatavahana Empire, the Kadambas came to the power in the north of Karnataka and the Gangas in the south.\nBanavasi Kadamba\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| A.D.325 - A.D.540\n| Banavasi Kadamba\n| Mayura Varma / Kakustha Varma\n| Central, Northern Karnataka, parts of Southern Maharashtra\n|-\n|}\nis the oldest available inscription in Kannada dated to c.450 CE]]\nThe Kadambas are considered the earliest indigenous rulers of Karnataka. Its founder was Mayuravarma and its most powerful ruler was Kakusthavarma. The Kadamba name is attributed to the Kadamba tree that was grown near the place where the empire was founded. Kadambas ruled for almost 200 years before Chalukyas took over their empire, but some minor branches of Kadambas ruled Hanagal, Goa and other regions till the 14th century. The details about this old empire are available through inscriptions like Chandravalli, Chandragiri, Halmidi, Talagunda etc.\nGangas of Talakadu\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.325 - CE.999\n| Gangas of Talakadu\n| Avanitha / Durvinitha / Ratchamalla\n| South Karnataka / parts of Andhra and Tamil Nadu\n|-\n|}\nThe Gangas first ruled from Nandagiri and then from Talakadu. They were patrons of Jain and Hindu religions. They were also instrumental in laying a strong foundation for the flourishing and development of Kannada literature. They ruled for almost 700 years. During their peak period, the empire included Kodaugu, Tumkur, Bangalore, Mysore districts, parts of Andhra and Tamil Nadu. Durvinitha, Shripurusha and Ratchamalla were famous rulers. The most famous example of Ganga architecture is the Gomateshwara in Shravanabelagola built in c. 983 CE by the Ganga minister \"Chavundaraya\". The statue is carved out of a single monolith rock and measures 57 feet high. This is the tallest monolith statue in the world, and is so perfect that the fingers of the hand are cut up slightly as a mark of induced imperfection (Drushti Nevarane in Kannada). The statue is naked, and shows the beauty of the human in that form. The statue is the first of its kind in Karnataka and comparable statues were not produced thereafter.\nChalukyas of Badami\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.500 - CE.757\n| Chalukyas of Badami\n| Pulakeshi II (Immadi Pulakeshi)/ Vikramaditya II\n| Most of Karnataka and Maharashtra, large parts of Andhra Pradesh, parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Orissa\n|-\n|}\nis constructed by carving large rock structure and an example of Chalukya architecture.]]\nThe Chalukya empire was established by Pulakeshi. His son Kirttivarma I consolidated and strengthened the empire. Mangalesha who was a powerful ruler extended the empire. The name \"Chalukya\" has no definite meaning. According to legend, the brave man who was born out of god Brahma's Cheluka (a type of vessel) was named Chalukya. They were patrons of deity Vishnu. The most famous ruler was Pulakeshin II (c. 610 CE - c. 642 CE). He was having the title of \"Satyasherya Parameshwara\" and \"Dakshina Patheshwarya\" because he defeated most of the southern and northern rulers Harshavardhana of Kanouj. During his rule, the empire extended up to the south of Karnataka and included the whole of western India (i.e. Gujarat, Maharashtra). Later victories also brought the eastern portions (Orissa, Andhra) into his rule. Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited his court and called the empire \"Maholocha\" (Maharashtra). His description included Pulakeshin II's personal details and military techniques that were employed. An artistic picture in Ajanta depicts the arrival of the representative of Persian emperor Kusru 2nd to his kingdom. Pulakeshin II was finally defeated by Pallava ruler Narasimhavarma who occupied Badami and called himself \"Vatapikonda\", which literally means \"The one who won Badami\". The end of Pulakeshi II remains a mystery. But the empire could last up to 757 CE. Their contribution to architecture includes cave temples of Badami, Aihole, Pattadakal, Mahakoota, etc.\nRastrakuta of Manyakheta\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.757 - CE.973\n| Rastrakuta of Manyakheta (modern Malkhed)\n| Druva Dharavarsha / Krishna I / Govinda III / Nrupatunga Amoghavarsha I / Indra IV / Krishna III\n| All of Karnataka and Maharashtra, large parts of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhyapradash, extended to Kannauj at their peak.\n|-\n|}\nThe name Rastrakuta is a formal title like Patela, Gowda, Hegade, Reddy etc. Dantidurga and his son Krishna overtook the empire from Chalukyas and built a powerful empire on it. During the rule of Govinda, the empire became more powerful all over the south and the north. His son Nrupatunga Amogavarsha got immortalised as \"Kavichakravarthi\" due to the work of Kavirajamarga. In c. 914 CE Arab traveller Hassan-al-Masood visited the empire. The 10th century was a golden age for the literature of Kannada. The famous poet \"Pampa\" was in the court of Arikesari who was a feudatory to Rastrakutas. Adikavi Pampa popularised the \"Champu\" style through the epic \"Vikramarjuna Vijaya\". Other famous poets who lived in this period are Ponna, Ranna, etc. among others. During c. 973 CE Taila 2nd of Chalukya defeated the Rastrakutas after a prolonged battle taking advantage of Karka 2nd's (the last ruler of Rastrakutas) weakness. The world-famous Kailash Temple at Ellora is an excellent example of their architecture.\nChalukyas of Kalyana\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.973 - CE.1198\n| Chalukyas of Kalyana\n| Vikramadithya VI\n| Entire Karnataka and Maharashtra, large areas in Andhra Pradesh, parts of Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh while at their peak\n|-\n|}\nAfter the Rastrakutha came to the Chalukya who ruled from Kalyana. The most famous among them was Vikramadithya 6th. He was responsible for the setting of a new era called \"Vikrama shaka\". An important event that took place during this period (c. 1150 CE) is the social and religious movement of Basaveshwara who was in the court of Bijjala. The literature that flourished under Basaveshwara, Allamaprabhu, Channabasavanna and Akkamahadevi during this period gave rise to \"Vachanna\" in Nadugannada (middle Kannada) which was simple to understand, elegant and effective in reaching the people. The Vachanna form of literature was instrumental in removing the Sanskrit influence to a large extent and thus popularised Kannada as an effective language for literature. The Kashmiri poet Bilhana came to his court and lived there. He wrote \"vikramankadevacharita\" praising Vikramaditya 6th. The Kalachurya took over their empire and ruled for about 20 years but were ineffective to see the integrity of the empire. Thus the empire got broke up which was shared by Sevunas in the north and Hoysalas in the south.\nSevunas of Devagiri\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1198 - CE.1312\n| Sevunas of Devagiri\n| Singana II\n| Northern Karnataka, most of Maharashtra, and parts of Andhra Pradesh\n|-\n|}\nin Halebidu]]\nThe Sevunas were from Nasik and came to power during 835 CE. They ruled parts of Deccan and very small parts of Karnataka until the beginning of the 12th century, with Devagiri as the capital. Singana II was the main ruler and during his reign, most of the empire experienced stability that could not be maintained thereafter. They were constantly at war with Hoysalas and other rulers and fell to Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khilji and his general Malik Kafur.\nHoysalas of Dwarasamudra\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1000 - CE.1346\n| Hoysalas of Dwarasamudra\n| Vishnuvardhana / Ballala II\n| Southern Karnataka including the coast, parts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu\n|-\n|}\nin Belur]]\nThe Hoysalas were famous for their architecture. The empire was founded by the legendary person \"Sala\", who hailed from the village of Sosavur (present-day Angadi in Chikkamagalur). Once, he accompanied his teacher Sudatta to the temple of Vasantika, but, a tiger came in their way and tried to attack them. The master threw a \"Khatari\" (knife) and exclaimed \"Hoy Sala (Hit, Sala)\" and he obediently agreed and mauled the tiger, killing it. Sudatta blessed him and said that he would establish a mighty empire. The emblem of Hoysala depicts Sala fighting with the tiger. Some people interpret that the man represents Hoysala and tiger represents the Cholas (tiger being their emblem), while this represents the Hoysala's victory over Cholas in Talakkad. This legend is also depicted in their royal emblem and found in many inscriptions and in front of Belur temple. The Hoysalas were patrons of Jain religion but also respected all religions. During the 8th Century CE,  the famous philosopher Adi Shankaracharya established Dakshinamnaya Sharada Peetha at Sringeri in Chikamagalur and gave impetus to the Vidheka (Hindu) religion. The famous philosopher Ramanujacharya established the Cheluvanarayana Temple in Yadugiri (now Melukote, near Mysore). The famous Hoysala king Bittideva (also called Bittiga) was influenced by Ramanujacharya and got converted to Hindu, changing his name to Vishnuvardhana.\nThe world-famous Chennakeshava Temple, Belur, Hoysaleshwara Temple, Halebid and Chennakeshava Temple, Somanathpura are examples of their architecture. After Veera Ballala III's death in a battle at Madurai, the Hoysala Dynasty came to an end. The famous expert in epigraphy Mr. Furgusen described the architecture of  \"Hoysaleshwara\" temple as exceeding the art of any Gothic architecture. Some European critics compare Hoysala architecture at Halebid with the Parthenon in Athens, Greece.\nVijayanagara\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1336 - CE.1565\n| Vijayanagara\n| Devaraya II / Krishnadevaraya\n| The whole of South India, encompassing present-day states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, along with parts of Orissa and Maharashtra\n|-\n|}\n]]\nThe Vijayanagara empire was founded by the duo Harihara and Bukka. This empire was established during tough times when Kakatiyas of Warangal and King Kampili of Kummatadurga were killed and their dynasties uprooted by the Delhi Sultanate. The feeble Hoysala emperor Veera Ballala III desperately fought from Tiruvannamalai and finally succumbed in a battle at Madurai. At such a time, Hakka and Bukka, under the spiritual guidance of Vidyaranya, found a rabbit trying to shoo off hunting dogs. Hence, in 1336 CE, they built a city and named it Vidyanagara at first (in memory of Vidyaranya), but changed it into Vijayanagara. Hakka assumed the name of Harihara Raya I and due to his work, the empire got firmly established in 1346 CE. He subdued the Madurai Sultanate and helped in bringing back the idol of Sri Ranganatha of Srirangam, that had been shifted to Tirupati during an attack by Delhi Sultanate. His brother Bukka succeeded him, assuming the name of Bukka Raya I. His successors were able administrators and were successful in\nblocking Muslim invasion in South India for about 300 years. Italian, Portuguese and Persian visitors (Parsee, Kantae, Abdul Razak) described the Vijayanagar capital Hampi as equivalent to Rome in those days. Krishnadevaraya was the most famous ruler of the empire . After his death in 1530, internal feuds arose in the royal family. There was no one to hold the empire stably and crush the rebellions of the vassals. Seeking advantage of this, the Berar Sultanate, and Sultans of Bijapur, Bidar, Golconda and Ahmadnagar defeated the forces of Aliya Rama Raya in the battle of Talikota in c. 1565 CE. These Sultans also sacked Hampi. The Stone Chariot of Vijaya Vitthala Temple (in Hampi) is an excellent example of Vijayanagar architecture.\nBahamani\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1347 - CE.1527\n| Bahumani Sultanate\n| Muhammadshah I / II\n| Deccan area comprising northern Karnataka and Andhra\n|-\n|}\nmeasures 857 feet in height and an important source of electricity in the region.]]\nThe Bahumani empire was established due to the conquest of the Muslim rulers in south India. The Muslim raids were so intense that in almost two attacks, four empires of the south were destroyed (Devagiri in c. 1318 CE, Varangal of Andhra in c. 1323 CE, Pandya of Tamil Nadu in c. 1330 CE, and partially Hoysala). But Hoysala Ballala shifted his capital to Tiruvannamalai and continued his fight. Amir Hassan from Persia called himself as Bahamani and established the Bahamani kingdom. Muhammad Shah was an able ruler and strengthened the empire. The empire occupied large chunks of Maharashtra and also parts of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka (Bijapur, Bidar, Gulbarga area) Muhammad Gawan was the most famous minister under the Bahumans. They ruled from Bidar. Russian traveller Nikiten visited the empire in c. 1470 CE and described Bidar as a beautiful city.\nSultans of Bijapur\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1490 - CE.1686\n| Sultans of Bijapur\n| Yusaf Addil Khan / Ibrahim Addil Shah II\n| Bijapur and adjoining areas\n|-\n|}\nin Bijapur]]\nAround c. 1490 CE the empire broke into five parts, of which Bidar and Bijapur belong to Karnataka. The other kingdoms are Berar, Ahmadnagar and Golconda. Muhammad Ibrahim Adil Shah built the famous Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur. Muslim architecture flourished under their reign but many remained uncompleted. Farista who was in the court of Ibrahim II compiled an encyclopedia called \"Najumal-Ullum\" (star of scientists) which contained much arts of southern style. The Mughals, under Aurangzeb finally defeated Sikandar Adil Shah in 1686, while the erstwhile Sultan was imprisoned in Daulatabad Fort, where he died in 1686, ending the Adil Shahi Dynasty.\nNayakas of Keladi\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1500 - CE.1763\n| Nayakas of Keladi\n| Shivappa Nayaka / Rani Channama\n| Coastal and Central Karnataka\n|-\n|}\nThe Nayakas of Keladi ruled the Malnad and Karavali (west coast) regions during the Vijayanagar reign. They successfully repelled the Portuguese and Bijapur sultans. They carried forward the principles and traditions of Hindu religion after the demise of the Vijayanagar empire. During its peak, the kingdom stretched from Banavasi (in Uttara Kannada) to Kannur (in Kerala) and the West Coast to Sakkarepattana (in Kodagu), and included present-day districts of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada, Shimoga, Chikkamagalur, Hassan and parts of Kodagu. The most famous among them was Shivappa Nayaka, who had excellent military and administrative skills. He sheltered Tirumala Nayaka of Vijayanagara from the Bijapur Sultans. He was famous for his taxation and agricultural systems. His land taxation system is famous as \"Shivappanayakana Shisthu\" (Discipline of Shivappanayaka). An important queen was Keladi Chennamma. She was one of the first Indian rulers to defy and defeat the Mughal hordes of Aurangzeb. While sheltering Shivaji's son Rajaram, she employed guerilla warfare and fought with Aurangzeb's forces. The Mughal emperor himself had to sue for peace with her. She is immortalised in Kannada traditional (janapada) songs. Later, during the reign of Rani Veerammaji, Hyder Ali of Mysore occupied their kingdom and imprisoned her in Madhugiri.\nWodeyars of Mysore\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1399 - CE.1761\n| Wodeyars of Mysore\n| Ranadhira Kantirava / Chikkadevaraja\n| Southern Karnataka, parts of northern Tamil Nadu\n|-\n|}\nThe Yeduraya and Krishnadeva of Yadava clan who came from Dwaraka to Mysore were approached for help to contain Marappanayaka. They defeated and killed him. His heir was married to Yeduraya and he came to crown in c.1399 CE. Mysore was previously called \"MahishaMandala\" which means the region of demon Mahisha. The demon was killed by a goddess in this region and hence got the name Mysore. The small kingdom was made into a mighty empire by RajaWodeyar. They shifted their capital from Mysore to Srirangapattana. Chikkadevaraja. Wodeyar is the most famous ruler among them and got the title \"Karnataka Chakravarthy\" by defeating Nayakas (Ikkeri), Sultans (Madurai) and Shivaji. By 1686 CE the kingdom included almost all of south India. In 1687 CE they bought the city of Bangalore from Mughal by paying three lakh Rupees. By 1761 CE Hyder Ali who was a normal soldier took over their empire.\nSultanate of Srirangapattana\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1761 - CE.1799\n| Sultanate of Srirangapattana\n| HyderAli / Tippu Sultan\n| Most of Karnataka, parts Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu and Kerala\n|-\n|}\nHyder Ali, who overtook the Mysore from the Wodeyars ruled from Srirangapattana. He soon displaced Nanjaraj, the prime minister, and made the Raja a prisoner in his own palace. Tipu Sultan succeeded Hyder Ali. He fought bloody wars against the British and their allies but was resoundingly defeated by a confederation of the British, the Marathas and the Hyderabad Nijamas in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and died on the battlefield in 1799 CE.\nMysore Wodeyars\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1800 - CE.1831\n| Mysore Wodeyars\n| Krishna Raja Wodeyar III\n| Old Mysore area\n|-\n|}\nAfter the defeat of Tipu, according to the treaty in 1800 CE, the British divided the state in which Bellary, Kadapa, Kurnool areas went to Nijamas; Marathas got the northern parts; the coastal parts were retained by the British, but they divided it among Bombay and Madras presidencies. The then governor-general of British India Markvis of Wellesley reinstated the Wodeyar in Mysore and administration was given to Dewan Purnaiya because the throne prince was still young. Purnaiya was an able administrator, and under his guidance, the empire functioned like any modern government. The other ministers in line were Sir Sheshadri Aiyar, Dr. M. Visveswaraya and Sir Mirza Ismail. Around 1824 CE \"Rani Channamma\" and her general \"Sangoli Rayanna\" of Kittur started to fight against British and declared independence. Due to this, in 1831 CE the British took over the empire.\nBritish takeover\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1831 - CE.1881\n| British Takeover.\n| Commissioners of British\n| Old Mysore and other areas\n|-\n|}\nIn 1831 CE the British overtook the empire and appointed the commissioners, who were yakshith\ngiven the power to rule on behalf of the British empire.

During this period the urge to independence gained momentum with the result that many leaders were imprisoned. The struggle finally led to the grant of independence to India by the British. The rule of the Wodeyars continued until the Indian independence and finally they merged Mysore with the Indian union which got incorporated into India as a state.\nKarnataka State\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Time Period / Era\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire / Dynasty\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Main Rulers\n! style=\"text-align: left;\"|Empire Extent\n|-\n| CE.1956\n| Karnataka State\n| Government\n| Whole of Karnataka\n|-\n|}\nAfter the Indian independence and partition of the country, the states were reorganised based on the linguistic and other criteria and thus the divided areas of Kannada speaking population came together to form the present day Karnataka under the name of Mysore. On 1973 November 1, the name Mysore was changed to Karnataka. The state choose the city of Bangalore as its capital and gave Kannada the status of an administrative language. The Vidhana Soudha build by Kengal Hanumanthya became the state parliament house. The Attara Kachery was made the state high court.\n]]\nBengaluru City\nBengaluru, often hailed as the \"Silicon Valley of India\" and the \"Garden City,\" boasts a rich and dynamic history spanning millennia, from ancient settlements to its modern-day status as a global technology hub. The national language of Karnataka, and thus prominently spoken in Bengaluru, is Kannada (ಕನ್ನಡ).\nAncient Roots (c. 4000 BCE - 1537 CE):\nEvidence suggests human habitation around Bengaluru dates back to the Stone Age (around 4000 BCE), with findings of stone implements. Iron Age tools and burial mounds from around 800 BCE have also been discovered. The region was involved in trans-oceanic trade with the Romans in the 1st century CE, as indicated by Roman coins found in the area.\nThe earliest written reference to \"Bengaluru\" appears in a 9th-century CE Ganga inscription (hero-stone) from Begur, mentioning \"Bengaval-uru\" (City of Guards) and a battle fought there. This indicates its significance as a strategic military location. Successive South Indian dynasties, including the Western Gangas (4th-10th centuries CE), the Cholas (11th-12th centuries CE), and the Hoysalas (12th-14th centuries CE), ruled the region, leaving their architectural and cultural imprints. One popular legend attributes the name \"Bengaluru\" to a 12th-century incident where Hoysala King Veera Ballala II, lost in a forest, was offered \"benda kaalu\" (boiled beans) by an old woman, leading him to name the place \"Benda-Kaal-ooru.\"\nFoundation of Modern Bengaluru (1537 CE):\nThe foundation of modern Bengaluru is widely attributed to Kempe Gowda I in 1537 CE. A local chieftain and feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda built a mud fort and established a town within its walls, which would become the nucleus of the burgeoning city. He planned the town meticulously, dividing it into \"petes\" (markets) with main streets like Chikkapete and Doddapete. He also constructed temples and water tanks, laying the groundwork for the city's infrastructure. His son, Kempe Gowda II, further contributed to the city's beautification.\nChanging Hands and Dynasties (17th - 18th Centuries):\nOver the centuries, Bengaluru witnessed the rule of various powers:\nMarathas (1638-1687): Shahaji Bhosle, father of Chhatrapati Shivaji, captured and ruled Bengaluru for a period.\nMughals (1687-1690): The Mughals took control and later sold the city to the Mysore Kingdom's Wadiyar dynasty.\nMysore Kingdom (Wadiyar Dynasty, 1690-1799): Bengaluru became part of the Mysore Kingdom. In 1759, Krishna Raja Wadiyar II gave Bengaluru as a personal jagir to Hyder Ali, a military commander, who significantly developed the city, strengthening the fort and promoting trade. His son, Tipu Sultan, continued these efforts, further expanding Lal Bagh and contributing to the city's economic growth, particularly in sericulture.\nBritish Influence and Cantonment (Late 18th Century - 1947):\nThe British East India Company's involvement grew during the Anglo-Mysore Wars.\n1791: Lord Cornwallis captured the Bangalore Fort during the Third Anglo-Mysore War.\n1799: Following Tipu Sultan's death in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, Bengaluru was returned to the Wodeyar dynasty.\n1809: The British shifted their military cantonment to Bengaluru, establishing the Bangalore Cantonment outside the old city. This area developed as a distinct entity, governed by the British, and attracted a large European and Anglo-Indian population due to its salubrious climate. The old city, meanwhile, remained under the Maharaja of Mysore's nominal rule as a princely state of the British Raj.\n1831-1881: Bengaluru served as the headquarters of the British administration.\n1862: Separate municipal boards were established for Bangalore City and the Cantonment.\nLate 19th - Early 20th Centuries: The British period saw significant infrastructure development, including the introduction of electricity (1905, making Bengaluru the first Asian city to have streetlights), railway lines (1859), and the construction of iconic buildings like the Attara Kacheri (High Court) and Bangalore Palace. The city also faced challenges like the Great Famine of 1875-77 and the plague epidemic in 1898, which led to the development of new extensions like Basavanagudi and Malleswaram. Educational institutions like the Indian Institute of Science (1909) were established.\nPost-Independence Growth and \"Silicon Valley\" Transformation (1947 - Present):\n1947: After India gained independence, Bengaluru became the capital of the Mysore State.\n1949: The two separate urban settlements, Bangalore City and Bangalore Cantonment, merged into a single urban center, forming the Bangalore City Corporation.\n1956: Mysore State was reorganized and later renamed Karnataka in 1973, with Bengaluru remaining its capital.\nMid-20th Century: The city experienced significant industrial growth, particularly with the establishment of public sector undertakings like Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), laying the groundwork for its future as a technological hub.\n1980s - Present: Bengaluru witnessed an unprecedented IT boom, attracting major multinational corporations and domestic tech giants like Infosys and Wipro. This rapid growth in the information technology and software sectors earned it the moniker \"Silicon Valley of India\" and led to a massive influx of population, transforming it into a vibrant, diverse, and cosmopolitan metropolis.\n2006: The city officially reverted to its original Kannada name, Bengaluru.\nToday, Bengaluru continues to be a leading center for technology, education, research, and innovation, while striving to balance its rapid modernization with its rich historical and cultural heritage. The presence of Kannada as the state language is a fundamental aspect of its cultural identity, shaping its linguistic landscape and heritage.\nKannada:\nಬೆಂಗಳೂರು ನಗರ\n\"ಸಿಲಿಕಾನ್ ವ್ಯಾಲಿ ಆಫ್ ಇಂಡಿಯಾ\" ಮತ್ತು \"ಗಾರ್ಡನ್ ಸಿಟಿ\" ಎಂದು ಸಾಮಾನ್ಯವಾಗಿ ಗುರುತಿಸಲ್ಪಡುವ ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು, ಸಹಸ್ರಮಾನಗಳಷ್ಟು ವಿಸ್ತಾರವಾದ, ಪ್ರಾಚೀನ ವಸಾಹತುಗಳಿಂದ ಹಿಡಿದು ಜಾಗತಿಕ ತಂತ್ರಜ್ಞಾನ ಕೇಂದ್ರವಾಗಿ ಇಂದಿನ ಸ್ಥಾನದವರೆಗಿನ ಶ್ರೀಮಂತ ಮತ್ತು ಕ್ರಿಯಾತ್ಮಕ ಇತಿಹಾಸವನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿದೆ. ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದ ರಾಜ್ಯ ಭಾಷೆ, ಮತ್ತು ಬೆಂಗಳೂರಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಮುಖವಾಗಿ ಮಾತನಾಡಲ್ಪಡುವ ಭಾಷೆ **ಕನ್ನಡ (ಕನ್ನಡ)** ಆಗಿದೆ.\n---\n### ಪ್ರಾಚೀನ ಬೇರುಗಳು (ಸುಮಾರು 4000 BCE -
