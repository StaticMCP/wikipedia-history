There, he encountered Abdelkader's army, consisting of 8,000 cavalrymen and 4,000 infantrymen. After the French vanguard folded under the impetuous charge of the Algerian cavalry, Trézel ceded the place to the Algerians and retreated some distance away to avoid total defeat.\nOn 27 June Trézel and his forces set off to return to Oran. The day after, they were ambushed by Abdelkader near the marshes of the Macta.\nSee also\n* Emir Abdelkader\n* Emirate of Abdelkader\n* French Algeria\n* French conquest of Algeria\n* Sig\nReferences"
