In the , Bellbowrie had a population of 5,495 people.\nBellbowrie  is on the northern side of the Brisbane River and lies  west-southwest of Brisbane's city centre. It is a rapidly developing semi-rural area due to Brisbane's growth heading in a westwards direction.\nGeography\nThe suburb is bounded to the north by Pullen Pullen Creek and to the east by the Brisbane River with two of its reaches:\n* Pullen Reach (downstream )\n*Goggs Reach (upstream )\nMoggill Road, which bisects the suburb, is a main thoroughfare for traffic passing from Ipswich to central Brisbane. Commuters may use the Moggill Ferry to gain access to Moggill Road as an alternative to the Centenary Highway.  Neighbouring suburbs include: Moggill, Pinjarra Hills and Anstead.\nThe streetscape in Bellbowrie benefits from the provision of underground power and there are few power poles to be seen.\nBellbowrie is part of the Pullenvale Ward for Brisbane City Council Elections as well as the seat of Moggill for state elections and the seat of Ryan for federal elections.\nHistory\nThe name Bellbowrie is an Aboriginal word (possibly from the Hunter River area in New South Wales) meaning , possibly referring to the red gum. It was named on 4 November 1972 and bounded on 11 August 1975.\nThe Moggill bora ring is at 102 Riversleigh Road (). It is a raised earthen mound about  high and about  in diameter. It was used for ceremonies in which Aboriginal boys became recognised as men.\nThe Bellbowrie subdivision took place in 1972.\nDevelopment slowed in the aftermath of the 1974 Brisbane flood which saw much of the eastern, lower-lying areas of the suburb badly inundated with water.  Since the construction of the Wivenhoe Dam in the 1980s the fear of floods was reduced and development increased.  Many acreage owners are subdividing their properties and as a consequence, significant areas of bushland are being cleared.\nThe boundaries of the suburb were extended on 13 December 1990 to include land previously in Anstead.\nThe Bellbowrie Swimming Pool was built in 1974.\nSeveral new housing estates began development in 2001 on land that used to be pineapple farms.\nIn the 2011 Brisbane floods, the Brisbane River rose significantly and some small areas of Bellbowrie were flooded. However, of greater concern was the inundation of access roads to the area, isolating a number of suburbs including Bellbowrie including the loss of electricity and telecommunications and a shortage of food with the supermarket inundated. The Uniting Church acted as an evacuation centre for those whose homes were flooded and as a communal food bank which received supplies of necessities via helicopter.\nFollowing the 2011 floods, the Bellbowrie swimming pool was rebuilt to be more flood-resistant based on a design by Bureau Proberts Architect. It won the Horbury Hunt Award, for the best commercial project utilising clay brick.\nDemographics\nIn the , Bellbowrie had a population of 5,413 people.\nIn the , Bellbowrie had a population of 5,462 people.\nIn the , Bellbowrie had a population of 5,495 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Bellbowrie.

In March 1851, the original land owner, Joseph Lewis, purchased portions 7 & 8. It is believed  portions 7 & 8 was used as church graveyard, circa 1855, only clues remain as to the exact location of the associated, possibly Methodist, chapel. George Mounser, who accidentally drowned at Moggill on 4 March 1855, is assumed to have been the first person buried in the graveyard.\nIn 1865, the land was sanctioned as a cemetery. In June 1921, the Queensland Governor, Sir Matthew Nathan, ordered that the cemetery be permanently reserved and placed under the control of trustees: John Anstead, John Bird, Maurice William Doyle, Norman Charles Robert Sexton and Frederick Charles Sugars. In February 1922, the land was resumed by the Crown. In July 1930, the Governor, Sir Thomas Herbert Goodwin, passed control of Moggill Cemetery over to the Brisbane City Council).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/dls06p/alma99183475620102061 Moggill Historical Society Inc.
