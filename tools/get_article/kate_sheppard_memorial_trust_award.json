This day is the anniversary of women winning the right to vote in New Zealand in 1893.\nThe award commemorates the life of a leading New Zealand women's suffrage campaigner, Kate Sheppard, and was established by a group of women from Christchurch who had also commissioned the Kate Sheppard National Memorial. Its aim is to assist a woman to develop her potential through study, research or training in an area of value to the community. Although the award is open to any woman, it has been noted that the large majority of applications come from university and polytechnic institute students.\n, circa 1914.
