The ceremony took place privately on January 9, 2022. The nominees were announced on December 13, 2021, by rapper Snoop Dogg and HFPA president Helen Hoehne.\nFor the first time since 2008, there was no traditional, televised ceremony. In support of boycotts of the HFPA by various media companies, actors, and other creatives over its lack of action to increase the membership diversity of the organization, the Golden Globes' regular broadcaster NBC declined to televise the 79th Golden Globe Awards. The HFPA ultimately chose to hold the presentation privately, with attendance limited to the organization's beneficiaries, and results announced via press release and highlighted on the Golden Globes' social media pages.\nBelfast and The Power of the Dog tied for the most nominations with seven each, while the latter's three awards (including Best Motion Picture – Drama) tied with West Side Story (Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy) and HBO's Succession (Best Television Series – Drama) for the most wins of the night.\nCeremony information\nOn May 10, 2021, NBC announced that it would not televise the ceremony, in support of a boycott of the HFPA by multiple media companies over what it criticized as insufficient efforts to increase the membership diversity of the organization. NBC added that it would be open to televising the ceremony in 2023 if the HFPA were successful in its efforts to reform its organization. Following these events, the HFPA released a timeline for its reforms, which would see the process completed by the week of August 2, 2021. On October 1, 2021, the HFPA released a list of 21 new members that it had recruited under these reforms.\nThe HFPA then announced on October 15 that it still planned to hold the 79th Golden Globe Awards on January 9, 2022, with or without a telecast. It was then reported that the HFPA would not require its normal submission process and screening requirements for the year. NBC ultimately aired Sunday Night Football as usual on the night of the ceremony, with the 2021 NFL season having extended the regular season to 17 game, 18-week season for the first time.\nDetails of the ceremony remained unclear when the HFPA announced the nominations on December 13, including whether the nominees would continue to boycott the ceremony. Following the announcement of nominations, The New York Times wrote that the HFPA's choices represented improvement on its goal to diversify itself, but it along with many other publications doubted its effectiveness. In support of the boycott, many studios chose not to acknowledge Golden Globes nominations in their \"For Your Consideration\" marketing.\nOn January 6, the HFPA announced that the ceremony would be held privately, with the winners announced via its social media platforms and press releases. It marked the first time since the 36th Golden Globe Awards in 1979 that there was no telecast and the 65th Golden Globe Awards in 2008 that there was no traditional ceremony. The HFPA stated that the 90-minute event would primarily highlight the organization's philanthropic efforts and be interspersed with the award presentations. After reportedly being unable to secure celebrities to serve as presenters, attendance was limited to those associated with the HFPA's beneficiaries, and no nominees, guests, or credentialed media were in attendance. The private ceremony was held under strict COVID-19 protocol due to the Omicron variant's widespread surge in Los Angeles.\nWinners and nominees\n, Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama winner]]\n, Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Best Actor in a Television Series – Drama winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama winner]]\n, Best Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy winner]]\n, Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Film winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film winner]]\nFor her role as Blanca Evangelista in Pose, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez became the first transgender person to win a Golden Globe Award, winning Best Actress – Television Series Drama.
