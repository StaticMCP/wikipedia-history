Touchdown Maths had recently been accused of being societally and technologically outdated; \"too boy-oriented\", and only running on Apple II and MS-DOS systems. Marx paid a Ukrainian software developer $350,000 update the games to run on Windows and Mac computers; meanwhile he tasked Siboney software staff of 8 programmers to create more titles. They debuted in October 1997.\nOf Gamco's total sales for the quarter ended March 31, 1997, approximately 94% was generated by proprietary software.
