Alongside with him were Kadri Veseli, Fatmir Limaj, Isak Musliu and Ymer Alushani.\nThe Pristina-Peja road was made impassable for the Serbian forces. The Llapushnik gorge was kept blocked for months, enabling the KLA fighters to move freely in a large part of the territory of Kosovo and this enabled them to organise and supply themselves with weapons.\nFirst battle\nThe first battle ended in the Kosovo Liberation Army being victorious against Yugoslav forces as they capture Lapušnik and build prison camp\nSecond battle\nOn 25-26 July 1998, Serbian military and police forces launched a summer offensive against most of the KLA's major checkpoints and bases, including an attack against the Llapushnik gorge and surrounding villages. Yugoslav forces seized back control of Llapushnik on July 27.\nAftermath\nKadri Veseli, a Kosovo Politician and former founder and leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, recalled it as one of the most fierce battles, saying that the dimensions of frontal fighting in Llapushnik resonated throughout Europe and increased the population's confidence in the strength of the Kosovo Liberation Army with a massive mobilisation.\nFrom mid-June to the end of July 1998, KLA forces established a prison camp in Llapushnik where both Serb and Albanian civilian detainees were subjected to mistreatment, torture and murder. When Yugoslav forces retook Llapushnik and the surrounding areas, the KLA abandoned the camp and marched the prisoners towards the mountains, dividing them into groups. A group of nine was released while another group numbering some 12 people were shot, ten of whom were killed. Llapushnik remained under Yugoslav control until 31 March 1999 when Yugoslav forces withdrew from their positions in Drenica after an offensive on the Region.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n* Summary & Facts  Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Kosovo-conflict|access-date=2022-01-07|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}}\nExternal links\n*"
