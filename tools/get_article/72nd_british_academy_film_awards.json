In a reference to the controversy surrounding Kevin Hart's removal as host of the 91st Academy Awards, Lumley said that she suspects she probably would not have been hosting the ceremony if she were on Twitter. It opened with a performance from Cirque du Soleil for the third consecutive year and was broadcast after a short delay on BBC One.\nThe period comedy-drama The Favourite received the most nominations with twelve and won seven, including Outstanding British Film, Best Actress in a Leading Role for Olivia Colman, and Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Rachel Weisz. Roma won four awards, including Best Film and Best Director for Alfonso Cuarón. Rami Malek won Best Actor in a Leading Role for Bohemian Rhapsody, thanking Freddie Mercury in his acceptance speech.\nThe In Memoriam section paid tribute to those who had died during the previous year, including Albert Finney, William Goldman, Penny Marshall, Burt Reynolds and Nicolas Roeg. The segment was accompanied by saxophonist Jess Gillam, who performed \"(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story\", the title song from the film Love Story, as composed by Francis Lai, who also was featured in the tribute. Thelma Schoonmaker won the BAFTA Fellowship, presented by Cate Blanchett and Prince William. She joined the fellowship along with her late husband Michael Powell and long-term collaborator Martin Scorsese. Elizabeth Karlsen and Stephen Woolley won the BAFTA Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema Award for their contributions to Number 9 Films.\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Films that received multiple nominations\n! style=\"background:;| Nominations\n! style=\"background:;| Film\n|-\n| 12\n| The Favourite\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 7\n| Bohemian Rhapsody\n|-\n| First Man\n|-\n| Roma\n|-\n| A Star Is Born\n|-\n| 6\n| Vice\n|-\n| 5\n| BlacKkKlansman\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4\n| Cold War\n|-\n| Green Book\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 3\n| Can You Ever Forgive Me?\n|-\n| Mary Poppins Returns\n|-\n| Mary Queen of Scots\n|-\n| Stan & Ollie\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 2\n| Beast\n|-\n| Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\n|-\n| If Beale Street Could Talk\n|-\n| Isle of Dogs\n|-\n| McQueen\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Films that received multiple awards\n! style=\"background:;| Awards\n! style=\"background:;| Film\n|-\n| 7\n| The Favourite\n|-\n| 4\n| Roma\n|-\n| 2\n| Bohemian Rhapsody\n|}\nPresenters\n* Melissa McCarthy presented Outstanding British Film\n* Lily Collins and Olga Kurylenko presented Best Animated Film and Best Production Design\n* Jason Isaacs presented Best British Short Animation\n* Henry Golding and Eleanor Tomlinson presented Best Sound and Best Editing\n* Lucy Boynton and Joseph Fiennes presented Best Documentary and Best Hair and Makeup\n* Bill Nighy presented the BAFTA Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema Award\n* Mary J.
