He had a great ascent of releasing remixes of songs like \"Blue Monday\" by New Order and \"Another Brick in the Wall\" by Pink Floyd. These songs went viral with his versions of \"Bete Balanço\" by Cazuza and \"Bidolibido\" by Fernanda Abreu.\nVintage Culture is also a record company manager at Só Track Boa.\nBiography\nLukas Ruiz Hespanhol was born in Mundo Novo, Mato Grosso do Sul in 7 July 1993. Son of Valdir and Edmara Rita Hespanhol, he has a sister named Lohana Sthefanie Hespanhol Ruiz. During his childhood, he spent much of it in a farming village in Katueté, a city in Paraguay in the Canindeyú Department, which borders Brazil. At that time, he helped his father with work on the family farm and his desire was to be a \"harvest pilot\", he says. At the age of 8, he moved to Mundo Novo, where he studied at the Mundo Novo Mickey Educational Center where he completed elementary school and graduated from high school.\nIt was in that city that his interest in electronic music began when he found a CD that his uncle had. Until then, he had been enjoying electronic bands like New Order and Depeche Mode.\nAfter finishing school he moved to Maringá, at the age of 19, where he decided to study law, but he abandoned his career to dedicate himself fully to producing music.\nIn 2015, Vintage Culture barely missed the DJ Mag by appearing at #118 in the Top 100 DJs list of British magazine, and in that same year, he had appeared at #2 on the best Brazilian DJs House Mag list. By 2016, he achieved the 54th position at the DJ Mag.\nIn 2016, he released the EP Hollywood by Ganza Seal Skol Music in partnership with Spinnin Records. Soon after, he charted his remix of \"Drinkee\" for duo Sofi Tukker, released by Ultra Music at the #4 Dance chart of Beatport; after a month, the release has remained in the Top 10. However, it was \"Wild Kidz\" Spinnin Records as he began to gain international recognition, as the song entered the \"Global Viral\" Spotify and received support from Oliver Heldens, EDX, and Sam Feldt.\nIn 2023, he climbed up at the best position of his career, at #10 in the DJ Mag Top DJs list.\nDiscography\nExtended plays\n* 2016 Hollywood, Ganzá, N.5 iTunes Electronic\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!
