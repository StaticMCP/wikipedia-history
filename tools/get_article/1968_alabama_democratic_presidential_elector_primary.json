Unlike in 1964, former Governor of Alabama George Wallace did not seek the national Democratic nomination for President, instead opting to run on a third-party ticket. Although many of Alabama's delegates to the DNC supported Wallace, he urged delegates to not vote for him. In most states, George Wallace had used the American Independent Party to gain ballot access for the presidency. In his home state of Alabama, however, Wallace sought to use the state Democratic Party's ballot line, the only state where he did so.\nThis was the last election in which the Alabama Democratic Party elected its presidential elector nominees by a primary vote, as in 1970, the State Democratic Executive Committee changed party rules to require the Democratic electoral college slate to be chosen by the Committee. By 1968, Alabama was the only state that still used this system. The Committee adopted this proposal 69–28.\nElectoral slates\nPro-Wallace\nThe following ten candidates for electors were endorsed by former Governor George Wallace:\n*Place 1: Earl Morgan, attorney\n*Place 2: Mabel S.
