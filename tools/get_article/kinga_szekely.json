She is responsible for numerous maps and discoveries of Hungarian caves and the creation of databases to inventory and study them. She was instrumental in the declaration by the United Nations that made the Aggtelek Karst and the Slovak Karst World Heritage Sites.\nBiography\nSzékely was born in Pécs, Hungary, on 27 September 1945, and graduated from the Móricz Zsigmond Gymnasium in Budapest in 1964. She graduated from the Faculty of Geography and Cartography of Eötvös Loránd University in 1976. In 1973, she spent an academic year at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, where she studied karst geomorphology.

From 1978, she was an employee of the Speleological Institute (Department) operating within the Nature Conservation Office.

In 1968, she was one of the surveyors of the Szabó-Pallagi caves. In 1981, she developed and maintained the national cave registry system and managed its database for more than two decades. She also created the computer database of the Hungarian speleological bibliography, which today contains more than 10,000 entries. She helped to prepare the groundwork for laws dealing with cave protection published since 1982, and in the acceptance of the justification for the proposal necessary for declaring the Aggtelek Karst and the Slovak Karst as United Nations World Heritage Sites. She advocated for the recognition of the right to build structures inside caves to protect visitors and the development of technical standards related to caves. She supervised the reconstruction of caves built for tourism on the same principles.\nFrom 1968 to 1993, she was the editor of Karst and Cave.
