It was published from September - October 1971 to June 1983.\nPublication history\nThe original title ran for 12 years and 124 issues. It was an anthology series that told war stories with horror, mystery, fantasy and science fiction elements. Changes in the Comics Code Authority made the use of horror elements possible. The first seven issues were reprinted material. Each issue beginning with issue #8 was hosted by Death, usually depicted as a skeleton dressed in a different military uniform each issue. The title's name was inspired by editor Joe Orlando. Walt Simonson's first professional published comic book work appeared in Weird War Tales #10 (January 1973). Roger McKenzie and Frank Miller's first collaboration was on a two-page story published in Weird War Tales #68 (October 1978). Recurring characters began to appear late in the series run, notably the G.I. Robot, and the return of \"The War that Time Forgot\" which originally ran in Star Spangled War Stories. Writer J. M. DeMatteis and penciler Pat Broderick created the Creature Commandos in Weird War Tales #93 (November 1980).\nSeveral issues featured a series of short vignettes titled \"The Day After Doomsday\" featuring largely doomed characters dealing with various threats and harsh ironies of living in a post-nuclear war apocalyptic landscape. The first few stories dealt with a society reduced to medieval ways seven centuries after a war but most others dealt with the near-term aftermath, with the unexpected results of radiation or infrastructure damage almost always catching the characters by surprise.\nOther stories featured robot soldiers, ghosts, the undead, and other paranormal characters from different eras of time.\nRevival\n.]]\nWeird War Tales was revived for DC Comics' Vertigo imprint in 1997. It was published as a four-issue limited series, followed by two one-shot special issues in 2000 and 2010.\nCollected editions\n* Showcase Presents: Weird War Tales collects Weird War Tales #1–21, 576 pages, December 2012,\n* America at War includes Weird War Tales #3: \"The Pool\" by Len Wein, Marv Wolfman and Russ Heath, 247 pages, July 1979,\n* Showcase Presents: The Great Disaster featuring the Atomic Knights includes \"The Day After Doomsday\" stories from Weird War Tales #22-23, 30, 32, 40, 42–44, 46–49, 51–53, 64, 68, 69, and 123, 576 pages, June 2014,\n* The Steve Ditko Omnibus Volume 1 includes stories from Weird War Tales #46, 49, 95, 99, and 104–106, 480 pages, September 2011,\n* DC Through the 80s: The End of Eras includes Weird War Tales #93, 520 pages, December 2020,\n* The Creature Commandos collects stories from Weird War Tales #93, 97, 100, 102, 105, 108–112, 114–119, 121, and 124, 288 pages, December 2013,\nSee also\n* Weird Western Tales, a sister title dealing in Weird West stories.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://www.coverbrowser.com/covers/weird-war-tales Weird War Tales] at Cover Browser\n* [https://www.mikesamazingworld.com/main/features/series.php?seriesid=2315 Weird War Tales] and [https://www.mikesamazingworld.com/main/features/series.php?seriesid=2316 Weird War Tales (vol. 2)] at Mike's Amazing World of Comics"
