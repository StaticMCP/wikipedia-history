Built in 1888, during an early phase of development in the area, it originally housed workers at nearby manufacturers, and later housed office workers who went downtown by streetcar. The house was highlighted for its Stick style architectural decorations when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, including elements in the gable end and on the porch.  Many of these details have been lost or covered over as a result of subsequent exterior siding work (see photo), although round-arch windows in the gable end survive.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in southwestern Worcester, Massachusetts\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Worcester County, Massachusetts\nReferences"
