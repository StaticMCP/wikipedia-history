The two-hour presentation, billed as The AVN Adult Movie Awards, was taped on January 12 at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Paradise, Nevada. For the first time the show was shot on High-Definition and was also broadcast in that format.\nAVN announced nominations for its annual awards on November 26, 2007. Nominees in the 114 categories were selected by the AVN staff, and winners were selected by AVN writers and other adult film reviewers.\nLeaders in nominations were Upload, a science-fiction thriller video from SexZ Pictures, with 22 nominations, and Layout, a film from Vivid Entertainment, with 18. This is the last year for separate film and video categories at the AVN awards.\nPerformer/director Belladonna received nine nominations, for Best Director (Non-Feature), Director of the Year and seven sex scenes. Performer/director Stormy Daniels received seven nominations, for acting, directing, screenplay, Director of the Year, Female Performer of the Year, Crossover Star of the Year, and Couples Sex Scene with veteran performer Randy Spears.\nSpears himself received five nominations, including Best Actor (Video), Best Supporting Actor (Film) and Male Performer of the Year; performer Steven St. Croix received five, four for acting and one sex scene; performer/director Brad Armstrong received four, for acting, screenplay, and two for direction.\nWicked Pictures and its affiliated companies led the nominations count with 91, followed by Evil Angel Productions and its affiliates with 88, Vivid Entertainment and its affiliates with 84, Pure Play Media and its affiliates with 48, Digital Playground and its affiliates with 41, JM Productions and its affiliates with 39, Elegant Angel Productions with 33, Adam & Eve Pictures and its affiliates with 32 and Hustler Video and its affiliates with 31.\nThis year's additions to the AVN Hall of Fame are performers Brittany Andrews, Jay Ashley, Angel Kelly, Dyanna Lauren, Raylene, Ruby, Alexandra Silk, Angela Summers and Tasha Voux, performer/director Skye Blue, cameraman Jake Jacobs and director Michael Raven.\nChanges in categories\nThe 25th annual AVN Awards was the last at which productions shot on film are divided into separate categories from those shot on video. This change comes due to the very few number of companies producing films.\nAVN president Paul Fishbein stated, \"If people make films, they'll be eligible in every category, and if there are enough of them, then we'll have a separate Best Film category.\"\nThe AVN Award categories that have until this year been divided up into film and video are: Best Actor, Best Actress, Best All-Girl Sex Scene, Best Anal Sex Scene, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography/Videography, Best Couples Sex Scene, Best Director, Best Editing, Best Group Sex Scene, Best Oral Sex Scene, Best Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress.\nMain awards\nWinners of categories announced during the awards ceremony on January 12, 2008, are highlighted in boldface.\nwinner of Male Performer of the Year]]\nwinner of Performer of the Year]]\nwon Best Actress Video for Upload]]\nwon Best Actress Film for Layout]]\nwon for Best New Starlet]]\nwon The Jenna Jameson Crossover Star of the Year]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best Actor Film\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best Actress Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Tom Byron, Layout (Vivid)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Penny Flame, Layout (Vivid)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best Actor Video\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best Actress Video\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Brad Armstrong, Coming Home (Wicked)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Eva Angelina, Upload (SexZ Pictures)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best Male Newcomer\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best New Starlet\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Alan Stafford\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Bree Olson\n|-\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | The Jenna Jameson Crossover Star of the Year\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Unsung Starlet of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Stormy Daniels\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Gianna Michaels\n|-\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Female Foreign Performer of the Year\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Female Performer of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Monica Mattos\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Sasha Grey\n|-\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Male Performer of the Year\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Transsexual Performer of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Evan Stone\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Alannah Starr\n|-\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best Film\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Director of the Year (Body of Work)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Layout, Vivid\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Jules Jordan\n|}\nOther performing awards\n* Best Supporting Actor - Film: Randy Spears\n* Best Supporting Actor - Video: Barrett Blade\n* Best Supporting Actress - Film: Kylie Ireland\n* Best Supporting Actress - Video: Hillary Scott\n* Male Foreign Performer of the Year: David Perry\n* Best Tease Performance: Brianna Love, Brianna Love: Her Fine Sexy Self\n* Best Non-Sex Performance: Bryn Pryor, Upload\nBest Scenes\nWinners of categories announced during the awards ceremony on January 12, 2008, are highlighted in boldface.\nFilm\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best All-Girl Sex Scene\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best Anal Sex Scene\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Faith Leon, Monique Alexander & Stefani Morgan, Sex & Violins (Vivid)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Chelsie Rae & Tyler Knight, The Craving (Wicked)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best Couples Sex Scene\n! style=\"background:#89cff0\" | Best Group Sex Scene\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Penny Flame & Tom Byron, Layout (Vivid)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n: Stefani Morgan, Savanna Samson, Monique Alexander,Evan Stone, Christian & Jay Huntington, Debbie Does Dallas ...
