The trio were named by King Sisavang Vatthana to form a coalition government following the independence of Laos.\nBackground and Representatives\nThe Three Princes represented three different political factions during the Laotian Civil War (1959–75), which was fought between the communist Pathet Lao (including many North Vietnamese of Lao ancestry) and the Royal Lao Government. Both sides received heavy external support in what became one of many proxy wars of the Cold War. It is known as the Secret War among the CIA Special Activities Division and Hmong veterans of the conflict.\nPrince Souvanna Phouma\nPrince Souvanna Phouma was the leader of the neutralist faction and Prime Minister of Laos several times (1951–1954, 1956–1958, 1960, and 1962–1975). The Prince was supported by Kong Le and the Royal Lao Government.\nPrince Souphanouvong\nPrince Souphanouvong, unlike his half-brothers, was born to a commoner without royal lineage, Mom Kham Ouane. He was the figurehead president of Laos from December 1975 to August 1991. A staunch communist and the leader of the Pathet Lao, he was supported by Kaysone Phomvihane (later Prime Minister and President of the LPDR) and the North Vietnamese. By 1972, the Pathet Lao found it unacceptable to form a coalition with rightist members, mostly military generals and the rich and powerful Na Champassak and Sananikone families.\nPrince Boun Oum Na Champasak\nPrince Boun Oum (also Prince Boun Oum Na Champassak) was the son of King Ratsadanay, and hereditary prince of Champassak, who served as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos from 1948–1950 and again in 1960–1962. The right-wing Prince, cousin to the other two princes, overthrew the Phouma Government in 1960 which was supported by Lao leaders Phoui Sananikone and General Phoumi Nosavan, and the Hmong leader General Vang Pao.\nSupporters of the Princes\nSee also\n*Mitford family – British aristocratic family with both far-left and far-right political associations, involved in politics from the interwar period to the early Cold War.\nReferences"
