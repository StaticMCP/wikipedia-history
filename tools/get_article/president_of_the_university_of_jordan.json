The appointment, made by royal decree from the King of Jordan based on the recommendation of the Board of Trustees, reflects the significant influence and responsibility associated with this position. The university president holds the highest position at the university and is at the top of its hierarchy. Through the university's branches in Amman and Aqaba, the university has a vast academic community with over 1,600 faculty members and more than 50,000 students spread across 25 schools.\nThe role of president covers academic, administrative, and financial responsibilities. He has the authority to determine and approve university policies and procedures, with oversight from the Board of Trustees. This includes reviewing general administrative and academic policies to align them with the institution's mission and societal needs. The president also plays a key role in appointments, from vice presidents to deans, and oversees the creation and modification of colleges, departments, centers, institutes, and academic programs.\nSelection process\nThe requirements for appointing the President of the University of Jordan include a term of four years, renewable once, with the appointee being of Jordanian nationality and holding the rank of professor as a faculty member. The appointment is made by royal decree based on the recommendation of the Board of Trustees, and the selection is made from a list of three candidates proposed by the Board.\nPowers and duties\nThe president’s responsibilities are diverse and include shaping policies, managing staff, enforcing ethical standards, representing the university externally, managing crises, and steering the university collectively towards its overarching goals while maintaining its integrity within the broader academic landscape. The president has significant power in shaping the university's direction, not only by determining policies and procedures but also by approving them. This includes a comprehensive review of both administrative and academic policies to ensure they align seamlessly with the institution’s overarching mission and address the evolving needs of the community. In addition to his central role in policy formation, the president holds a crucial position in the complex network of managing staff affairs, from appointing vice presidents to deans, with direct oversight over the creation or modification of colleges, departments, centers, institutes, and academic programs. The president is, at heart, the architect of the university’s academic landscape.\nThe president is responsible for approving the university's code of ethics, a founding document that guides ethical and behavioral standards within the academic community. His role extends beyond the campus, where the president serves as the official representative in various fields, including interactions with government bodies, appearing before courts, and participating in public and formal meetings.\nAs a member of the Board of Trustees by virtue of his position, the president’s influence extends to faculty appointments, renewals, and terminations, thus playing a key role in shaping the faculty body.\nIn times of necessity or unexpected circumstances, the president has discretionary power to suspend classes partially or entirely. This ability to make swift decisions emphasizes the president's role as the ultimate decision-maker, ensuring the safety of the university community.\nAssistants and deputies\nThe president holds the highest position at the university and is at the top of the hierarchy, while the Vice President holds the highest levels within college groups.\nWithin the president's executive team, five main vice presidents play pivotal roles. Among them is the vice president for the humanities colleges, responsible for shaping the academic landscape in this field, while the vice president for the scientific colleges focuses on the complexities of scientific disciplines, ensuring their growth and development. The vice president for administrative affairs handles administrative matters, streamlining organizational efficiency.\nAdditionally, the vice president for planning, development, and financial affairs plays a critical role in guiding the university towards its strategic goals. Finally, the vice president for centers and community service, who also serves as the head of Aqaba branch, leads community engagement initiatives.\nList of University of Jordan presidents\nThe 15th and most recent president of the university is Nathir Obeidat, appointed in 2021.

Removal from office is decided by the university council or board of trustees based on a justified recommendation. When the president's service ends, specific conditions apply. It is worth noting that a president who served at the university before his appointment is entitled to a severance pay and his financial entitlements are calculated based on his length of service at the university. Upon leaving office, the president retains the title of Professor.\nReferences"
