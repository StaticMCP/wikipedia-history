The main idol in this temple is Shiva and was consecrated by Narayana Guru in M. E. 1092. There are sub-shrines for Parvathi, Ganapathi, Murugan, Ayyappan, Krishna, Muthappan, Bhadrakali, Navagrahas and Nāgas (serpent deities). Even though Shiva is the main deity of the temple, Thaipooya Mahotsavam, a seven-day festival dedicated to Subramanya, is the main festival held here. It is one among the biggest festivals in the vicinity of Thrissur, perhaps second only to Thrissur Pooram.\nReferences"
