The Yugoslav defence plan involved placing the bulk of its land forces close to its borders, with very limited strategic reserves in depth. Almost all of the divisions that had been effectively mobilised were concentrated in the 3rd Army Group deployed in the east of the country along the Romanian and Bulgarian borders between the Iron Gates and the Greek border. Most of the heavy weapons and armoured vehicles available to the VKJ were obsolete, most formations were heavily reliant on animal-powered transport, and the VKJ had only 50 tanks that could engage front line German tanks on an equal basis.\nBy 6 April 1941, the VVKJ had been almost completely mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighter aircraft, and 100 modern medium bombers. Other than a small number of locally made Rogožarski IK-3 fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available.\nThe KJRM consisted of a flotilla of river monitors based on the Danube and a small fleet based in several ports along the Adriatic coast. The blue-water navy centred on a flotilla leader, three smaller destroyers, four obsolescent submarines and a gunboat, supplemented by minelayers and torpedo boats. Some of the smaller vessels in the Yugoslav fleet had been inherited from the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire following World War I and were obsolete.\nRoyal Yugoslav Army\nAt the time of the invasion, the Royal Yugoslav Army (, VKJ) consisted of 29 infantry divisions, three horse cavalry divisions, and a divisional-sized mountain detachment. There were also a significant number of independent infantry, cavalry, mountain, and combined arms brigades, infantry and cavalry regiments and fortress troops, as well as 17 border guard battalions. The Commander-in-chief of the VKJ was the 17-year-old King Peter II, and the Chief of the General Staff was the Prime Minister, Armijski đeneral}} Dušan Simović. The Yugoslav defence plan positioned almost all land forces close to its borders, with very limited strategic reserves in depth. The VKJ was heavily reliant on animal-powered transport, mainly oxen, and had only 50 relatively modern Renault R35 tanks that could fight German tanks on an equal footing, although these were only just being formed into a unit at the time of the invasion. The VKJ was organised into the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Army Groups, the independent 5th and 6th Armies and the Coastal Defence Command. The General Headquarters of the VKJ maintained command over five infantry divisions and a large number of smaller infantry, engineer and artillery units, as well as the only operational tank battalion. Each Army Group and independent Army was supported by an air reconnaissance group attached from the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force  (VVKJ). As mobilisation had been tentative and partial, many divisions were still in the process of mobilisation on 6 April 1941. The VKJ order of battle on 6 April 1941 is detailed below as provided by Niehorster.\n1st Army Group\nThe 1st Army Group was commanded by Armijski đeneral Milorad Petrović. It consisted of the 4th Army of Armijski đeneral Petar Nedeljković, responsible for the Yugoslav-Hungarian border and deployed behind the Drava between Varaždin and Slatina, and the 7th Army of Divizijski đeneral (Major General) Dušan Trifunović, which was responsible for the defence of the northwestern border with Italy and the Third Reich. and was located in the Zagreb area.}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Composition of 1st Army Group\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Army\n! scope=\"col\" | Formation\n! scope=\"col\" | Mobilisation status\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n|rowspan=6|}}\n| 27th Infantry Division Savska\n|bgcolor=\"FF8080\"|\n|\n|-\n| 40th Infantry Division Slavonska\n|bgcolor=\"FFFF80\"|\n|\n|-\n| 42nd Infantry Division Murska\n|bgcolor=\"FF8080\"|\n|\n|-\n| Detachment Ormozki\n|bgcolor=\"e3d9ff\"|\n|\n|-\n| 127th Infantry Regiment\n|bgcolor=\"e3d9ff\"|\n|\n|-\n| 81st Cavalry Regiment\n|bgcolor=\"e3d9ff\"|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=5|}}\n| 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski\n|bgcolor=\"FF8080\"|\n|\n|-\n| 38th Infantry Division Dravska\n|bgcolor=\"FF8080\"|\n|\n|-\n| Mountain Detachment Triglavski\n|bgcolor=\"80C080\"|\n|  but Terzić states it consisted of one mountain infantry regiment and a mountain artillery battalion.}}}}\n|-\n| Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski\n|bgcolor=\"80C080\"|\n|  but Terzić states it consisted of one mountain infantry regiment and a mountain artillery battalion.}}}}\n|-\n| Detachment Lika\n|bgcolor=\"80C080\"|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=1|}}\n| 1st Cavalry Division\n|bgcolor=\"FF8080\"|\n|\n|}\n4th Army support units included one motorised heavy artillery regiment, one artillery regiment, a motorised anti-aircraft battalion, six border guard battalions, and the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group comprising eighteen Breguet 19s was attached from the VVKJ and was based at Velika Gorica just south of Zagreb.

These aircraft used 22 different engines, four different machine guns and two models of aircraft cannon. This made the training, supply and maintenance of the VVKJ quite problematic. The VVKJ was organised into a headquarters, four air brigades and one naval brigade. Its order of battle on 6 April 1941 is detailed below as provided by Shores, Cull and Malizia, the most detailed work available on the subject.\nAir Force Headquarters\nThe VVKJ was commanded by Brigadni General (Brigadier) Borivoje Mirković, from his headquarters at Lješnica, and had two air groups and one independent squadron under its direct command.
