The two-game series was the setting for a game-rigging scandal that eventually resulted in the demise of both teams.  During the scandal, members of the Bulldogs were accused of throwing the championship to the Tigers. While Edwards officiated the first game of the series, he was unavailable to referee the second game because of a prior commitment to officiate that year's Harvard–Yale game.\nIn 1910, he thwarted an attempt on the life of New York mayor William Gaynor by tackling the assailant and sustaining a flesh wound in the arm in the process.  For his heroism, Edwards was awarded the Carnegie Medal for Heroism.\nLater that decade, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson appointed Edwards as collector of Internal Revenue for New York's Second District.\nEdwards was deputy of street cleaning in New York before becoming chief of waste disposal in nearby Newark, New Jersey. In 1926, Edwards became the first president of the first American Football League, which disbanded at the end of the season. Fourteen years later, his name was mentioned as a possible president of the third AFL at the press conference announcing the formation of the league, but he did not serve in that position.\nHe died on January 4, 1943, in Manhattan, New York City. His funeral was held at Calvary Episcopal Church in Manhattan.\nLegacy\nHe was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971.\nSee also\n* List of covers of Time magazine (1920s) (October 4, 1926)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
