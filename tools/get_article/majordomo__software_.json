It is written in Perl and works in conjunction with sendmail on UNIX and related operating systems. The name is derived from Latin \"majordomo\" meaning \"master of the house\"; in English, the word refers to a large household's chief servant.\nThe current version of Majordomo is 1.94.5, released 19 January 2000.\nThe official Web site warns that it will not work with Perl versions 5.001 and 5.005_01 specifically. It recommends using Perl 4.036 or the latest version available. Support for Perl 4.036 may not be kept for the future.\nHistory\nWith the advent of email, many mailing lists were maintained manually, with a list owner adding and removing participants by editing a text file. In 1984, LISTSERV was developed to run on IBM VM mainframes, and automated mailing lists on a large scale.\nMost mailing lists moved to commercial mailing list hosting services, often with a stipend of $100 or more paid to the list owner by the hosting service in exchange for the transfer. Most of those hosting providers were subsequently bought out by Yahoo! and merged into its now-discontinued Yahoo! Groups service.\nMajordomo has been in widespread use since 1992, predating the popularity of the Web browser, in an era when many people had access to email, but the World Wide Web did not enjoy wide deployment. As a result, tasks such as subscribing and unsubscribing are only handled by sending mail messages.\nThere are front-ends, such as MajorCool, to provide a Web interface. Many mailing lists still use Majordomo.\nMajordomo 2\n, a complete rewrite of Majordomo was underway, with a focus on keeping the familiar email interface while greatly improving the Web interface and other features. This coding effort is referred to as Majordomo 2 and is being used by the OpenBSD project.\nLicensing\nMajordomo is community-supported source available software; the license states \"No part of Majordomo may be incorporated into any program or other product that is sold, or for which any revenue is received without written permission of Great Circle Associates\". There are a few exceptions listed in the license to this: \"You may install Majordomo at your site and run mailing lists for other (sic) using it, and charge for that service.
