As a young man he was an interpreter in France and Germany, a secondary school teacher in Derby, and a tutor at the University Tutorial College in London. He first entered the House of Commons at the 1945 general election, as the Member of Parliament for Luton in Bedfordshire. However, at the 1950 general election, he lost his seat to the Conservative Party candidate Charles Hill, the former \"radio doctor\".\nWarbey re-entered Parliament at a 1953 by-election for the Nottinghamshire constituency of Broxtowe, following the death of sitting Labour MP Seymour Cocks. However, that constituency was abolished for the 1955 general election, at which Warbey was returned for the new Ashfield constituency. He held the seat until his retirement at the 1966 general election.Thereafter, he was employed as Executive Director of the Organisation for World Political and Social Studies.\nHe was known for his strong opposition to British support for the United States in the Vietnam War, resigning the Labour whip in protest in September 1965, and \"subsequently wrote a scathing book about [[Harold Wilson|[Harold] Wilson]]'s support for the United States\" entitled Vietnam: The Truth. He was also a strong European federalist, setting up the Socialist Europe Group in July 1948.\nHe died in Eastbourne aged 76.\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*"
