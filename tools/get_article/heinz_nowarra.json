He finished fifth in 1941 (Dr Walcker won) and second, behind Mross, in 1942 in the Kraków City championships,[http://www.astercity.net/~vistula/fredvandervliet2.htm Chess In Former German, Now Polish Territories - Fred Van Der Vliet]  tied for 10-12th at Kraków/Warsaw 1941 (the second General Government-ch, Alexander Alekhine and Paul Felix Schmidt won),[http://www.rogerpaige.me.uk/tables12.htm 1941]  tied for 7-8th at Krynica 1943 (the fourth GG-ch, Josef Lokvenc won),[http://www.rogerpaige.me.uk/tables%2014.htm 1943]  took seventh at Radom 1944 (the fifth GG-ch, Bogoljubow won),[http://www.rogerpaige.me.uk/Tables%2015.htm 1944]  and finished fifth in Kraków in May 1944 (Rudolf Teschner won).\nNowarra took also part in correspondence chess tournaments. In December 1944, his game against Klaus Junge had to be declared a draw, when Junge left for the front. As Luděk Pachman wrote, Nowarra probably shared the fate of his opponent, who died in the final days of World War II. To this day, there is no news about the fate of Nowarra.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
