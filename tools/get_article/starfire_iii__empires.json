Barton reviewed Starfire III: Empires in The Space Gamer No. 47. Barton commented that \"Overall, Starfire III: Empires does a good job of what it sets out to do – complicating and extending the Starfire system into a campaign game. If such appeals to be, and you already own Starfire and perhaps Starfire II, you should find it worth the buy.\"\nSteve List reviewed Starfire III: Empires in Ares Magazine #13 and commented that \"Given an abstract combat resolution system, it could be a decent postal game played with a referee. All in all, it should be of interest mainly to fans of the existing Starfire games.\"\nReviews\n*Dragon\nReferences"
