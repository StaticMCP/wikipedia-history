For each governorate, the first city in the table is the governorate capital (and capital city of its district at the same time). The following towns are the regional capitals (administrative centers) of the districts. The last item is the rural area outside the listed towns in each governorate. Each section details a brief summary of that city or town's history during the Syrian Civil War. The population figures are given according to the 2004 official census.\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0 auto; width:55em; clear:both;\"\n|-\n!Table of contents\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nAleppo Governorate:\nAleppo ·\nAfrin ·\nAtarib ·\nAyn al-Arab (Kobanî) ·\nAzaz ·\nAl-Bab ·\nDayr Hafir ·\nJarabulus ·\nManbij ·\nAl-Safira ·\nAnadan ·\nAqiba ·\nDarat Izza ·\nKafr Safra ·\nKhan Tuman ·\nKhanasir ·\nAl-Muslimiyah ·\nSarrin ·\nTell Aran ·\nTell Rifaat ·\nTell Shughayb ·\nUrum al-Kubrah ·\nUrum al-Sughrah ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nDamascus & Rif Dimashq Governorates:\nBarzeh ·\nJobar ·\nKafr Sousa ·\nQaboun ·\nTadamon ·\nYarmouk camp ·\nOther neighborhoods ·\nDarayya ·\nDouma ·\nAn-Nabk ·\nQatana ·\nQudsaya ·\nAl-Qutayfah ·\nAl-Tall ·\nYabrud ·\nAl-Zabadani ·\nArbin ·\nAssal al-Ward ·\nBabbila ·\nBeit Sahem ·\nBeit Sawa ·\nDeir Atiyah ·\nAl-Hajar al-Aswad ·\nHarasta ·\nJaramana ·\nKafr Batna ·\nMuadamiyat al-Sham ·\nAl-Sabinah ·\nSahnaya ·\nSaidnaya ·\nSaqba ·\nSayyidah Zaynab ·\nYalda ·\nZamalka ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nDaraa Governorate:\nDaraa ·\nIzra ·\nAl-Sanamayn ·\nAdwan ·\nDa'el ·\nJasim ·\nKhabab ·\nMuthabin ·\nNawa ·\nAl-Shaykh Saad ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nDeir ez-Zor Governorate:\nDeir ez-Zor ·\nAbu Kamal ·\nMayadin ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nHama Governorate:\nHama ·\nMasyaf ·\nMahardah ·\nSalamiyah ·\nAl-Suqaylabiyah ·\nKafr Nabudah ·\nMa'an ·\nQastun ·\nTremseh ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nAl-Hasakah Governorate:\nAl-Hasakah ·\nAl-Malikiyah ·\nQamishli ·\nQamishli border crossing ·\nRas al-Ayn ·\nAl-Qahtaniya ·\nSimalka border crossing ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nHoms Governorate:\nAbbasiya ·\nBaba Amr ·\nDeir Baalbah ·\nGhouta ·\nJobar ·\nJoret al-Shayyah ·\nKarm al-Shami ·\nKarm al-Zeitoun ·\nKhaldiyeh ·\nOld City ·\nQusour ·\nAl-Waer ·\nOther neighborhoods ·\nAl-Mukharram ·\nPalmyra ·\nAl-Qusayr ·\nAl-Rastan ·\nTaldou ·\nTalkalakh ·\nAbil ·\nAl-Buwaydah al-Sharqiyah ·\nAl-Husn ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nIdlib Governorate:\nIdlib ·\nArihah ·\nHarem ·\nJisr al-Shughur ·\nMaarrat al-Nu'man ·\nAzmarin ·\nBab al-Hawa border crossing ·\nBinnish ·\nAl-Dana ·\nDarkush ·\nKafr Nabl ·\nKhan Shaykhun ·\nMaarrat Misrin ·\nSaraqib ·\nSarmin ·\nTaftanaz ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nLatakia Governorate:\nLatakia ·\nAl-Haffah ·\nHarasta ·\nJableh ·\nQardaha ·\nKesab ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nQuneitra Governorate:\nQuneitra\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nRaqqa Governorate:\nRaqqa ·\nTell Abyad ·\nAl-Thawrah ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nAs-Suwayda Governorate:\nAs-Suwayda ·\nSalkhad ·\nShahba ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nTartus Governorate:\nTartus ·\nBaniyas ·\nDuraykish ·\nSafita ·\nAl-Shaykh Badr ·\nOthers\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\nSee also · References\n|}\nAleppo Governorate\n{| class=\"toccolours sortable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|+\n|- style=\"background:lavender;\"\n!Name\n!Population\n!District\n!Held by\n!\n|-\n|Aleppo\n|1,800,000\n|Mount Simeon District\n|u\n|See Aleppo (Syrian Civil War).\n|-\n|Afrin\n|36,562\n|Afrin District\n|y\n|See Afrin (Syrian Civil War).\n|-\n|Atarib\n|10,657\n|Atarib District\n|y\n|See Atarib (Syrian Civil War).\n|-\n|Ayn al-Arab (Kobanî)\n|45,000\n|Ayn Al-Arab District\n|y\n|See Kobanî (Syrian Civil War).\n|-\n|Azaz\n|31,623\n|A'zaz District\n|y\n|Azaz is a passage point to Turkey. On 19 July 2012, the FSA chased out the Syrian Army from the city of Azaz and took complete control of it. FSA also took over the associated border crossing of Bab al-Salame. Samir Haj Omar, an economist who now heads the local 30-member political council, said Turkish officials have been more willing to deal with him and other rebel leaders now that they are de facto governors. In early August 2012, the first new shipments of rice, flour and gasoline arrived in rebel-controlled northern Syria, according to local officials there. Earlier in the conflict, supplies were ferried across the Turkish border by horse, or on foot, by smugglers traversing muddy trails while dodging Turkish and Syrian border guards. On 29 October 2012, France 24 reported that there was a refugee camp between Azaz and the Turkish border. On 28 February 2013, it was reported that the FSA checkpoint in Azaz was where the Free Syrian Soldiers hand in their weapons to go into the refugee camp and to Turkey. It is also the first or second checkpoint into Turkey and Syria. On 18 September 2013, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant seized control of the town, posting snipers on rooftops, erecting checkpoints and imposing a curfew on the local population. On 28 February 2014, FSA and Jabhat al-Akrad took control of the town and the surrounding villages. As of January 2015; Northern Storm Brigade controls the town. al-Nusra Front has a minor presence.\n|-\n|Al-Bab\n|63,069\n|Al Bab District\n|y\n|See Al-Bab (Syrian Civil War).\n|-\n|Dayr Hafir\n|18,948\n|Dayr Hafir District\n|r\n|See Dayr Hafir (Syrian Civil War).\n|-\n|Jarabulus\n|11,570\n|Jarabulus District\n|y\n|See Jarabulus (Syrian Civil War).\n|-\n|Manbij\n|99,497\n|Manbij District\n|y\n|See Manbij (Syrian Civil War).\n|-\n|Al-Safira\n|106,382\n|As-Safira District\n|n\n|See Battle of Safira.\n|-\n|Anadan\n|11,918\n|Mount Simeon District\n|y\n|At dusk on 29 July 2012, FSA commander in the area, Lieutenant Rifaat Khali, mobilized 150 fighters to seize control of the Anadan checkpoint, a strategic location linking the city of Aleppo  to the south with the Turkish border to the north, which the FSA used as a source for supplies. On 30 July, after ten hours of fighting, FSA seized control of Anadan checkpoint and retrieved ammunition left behind by the defeated government forces. During the fighting, eight tanks were also captured, seven of which were still operational; the operational ones were intended for use in the battle of Aleppo. At least some of the captured tanks were deployed northwards to Azaz, where they were used to support an attack on a loyalist-held airbase. Anadan has been the site of heavy shelling by the Syrian army military. On 24 October 2012, the formation of a local administration council composed from prominent engineers, doctors, human right activists, was announced. On 16 February 2020, the Syrian Army took the city.\n|-\n|Darat Izza\n|13,525\n|Mount Simeon District\n|y\n|On 23 June 2012, 25 Shabiha militias were killed by Syrian rebels in the city. They were part of a larger group kidnapped by a rebel group. The fate of the others kidnapped was unknown. Many of the corpses of the shabiha militia killed were in military uniform. A secondary school has turned into a police station, a courthouse and a temporary town hall run by the rebels. It is part of a nascent rebel administration that is taking shape in areas of the country where Assad's authority has disappeared as his security forces try to secure control of Syria's main cities: Aleppo, Damascus, Homs and others. A defector from the Assad administration, Abdul Hadi heads a \"revolutionary\" security force made up of some 40 officers, all of them former policemen in the government. At times, Abdul Hadi's role seems more akin to that of a local mayor than a police officer. Among his self-assigned responsibilities, he monitors local bread supplies, urging bakeries to adjust production according to need. Recent rebel attacks on a government-owned wheat silo and army gasoline depots have given them access to new supplies. On 21 November, rebels attacked the nearby Sheikh Suleiman base (which was under siege for over two months), but were repelled from the area by an army counterattack, in which 25 rebels were killed. on 10 December, the base was taken by opposition forces. A little over 100 regime troops that were left inside the base retreated to the scientific building wearing gas masks. The town was under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant since September 2013., but then withdrew following a wide-scale offensive led by the Army of Mujahedeen and the Islamic Front.\n|-\n|Khan Tuman\n|2,781\n|Mount Simeon District\n|y\n|There is a huge collection of warehouses (about 58 of them) that extends over five kilometers in Khan Tuman. on 15 December 2012, Free Syrian Army declared their full control of the fuel, ammunition, and grain warehouses in Khan Tuman 11&nbsp;km southwest of central Aleppo after clashes with the government forces. On 15 March, rebels seized control of an ammunition factory complex and munitions depots. The complex had been used to supply the Syrian army with munitions to regularly shell rebel positions in the surrounding area. On 18 August, Sohr said that Syrian troops take control over the hill of Khan Toman. On 29 January 2020, government forces captured the town.\n|-\n|Khanasir\n|2,397\n|Al-Safira District\n|y\n|On late August 2013, Ahrar al-Sham eized the town. On 1 October, Syrian Army forces launched an offensive outside the town (which is situated along a key road needed to transport essential supplies), met by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Al Nusra Front, Ahrar al-Sham and other militias troops. By 10 October, Syrian government troops had seized the town. On 25 February 2016, government forces regain over control the town of Khanassir after ISIS take him during their attack on the town a few days ago. On 1 December 2024, Syrian oppositionist rebels have captured the city.\n|-\n|Al-Muslimiyah\n|5,916\n|Mount Simeon District\n|y\n|Since late November 2012, the Syrian Army Military Infantry College (northeast of the city of Aleppo) has been under siege by rebels from the Tawhid Brigade of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). The siege of the College is a continuation of the push from Atarib and base 46. In early December, FSA entered the College and took control progressively of all buildings On 15 December 2012, the rebels reportedly captured the infantry academy, army base and recruiting center at al-Muslimiyah, after weeks of fighting. The Hanano Barracks has a three-kilometer square campus. A top rebel commander from the Tawhid Brigade, Yusef al-Jadr (\"Abu Furat\"), was killed during the clashes while the pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated a large number of rebels and soldiers were also slain in the battle. The rebel brigade claimed it captured 100 prisoners. During the SAA offensive in October 2014 which captured the Handarat area and placed rebel-held Aleppo under a de facto siege, Syrian Army units captured the village along with surrounding areas.\n|-\n|Sarrin\n|6,104\n|Ayn Al-Arab District\n|y\n|In May 2013, the YPG took control of this area near the Tomb of Suleyman Shah. In September 2013, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al-Nusra Front militants seized control of Sarrin. See also 2012 Syrian Kurdistan campaign. In July 2015, YPG forces took over the area.\n|-\n|Tell Aran\n|17,767\n|Al-Safira District\n|y\n|On 1 August 2013, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and Al Nusra Front fighters took control of the town after defeating Kurdish forces. Shortly afterwards, local Kurdish sources claimed that Kurdish civilians were killed by the jihadist groups. On 11 November 2013, Tell Aran was seized by Syrian Army troops\n|-\n|Tell Rifaat\n|20,514\n|A'zaz District\n|y\n|In the early summer of 2012, Syrian government authorities withdrew from Tell Rifaat and were replaced by a council made up of local scholars, judges, and former Syrian Army officers. On 8 August 2012, Tell Rifaat was bombed by the Syrian Air Force, resulting in the deaths of six people, all members of the Blaw family. Opposition activists based in Aleppo claimed that Syrian Army forces were attempting to cut off the FSA's transport route between Tell Rifaat and Aleppo. By November 2013, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was in full control of the town. In January 2014, resistance fighters, mainly members of the Islamic Front, defeated ISIS militants in the town. Liwa al-Fatah of the Islamic Front came into control of the town. On 15 February 2016, the town was taken by the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces. On 12 March 2018, came under control of the Syrian army.\n|-\n|Tell Shughayb\n|5,110\n|Mount Simeon District\n|n\n|On 1 March 2013, the Syrian army regained control of the strategic Tell Shughayb town allowing them to approach the Aleppo airport.\n|-\n|Urum al-Kubrah\n|5,391\n|Atarib District\n|y\n|Since June, has control. On 22 September 2012, FSA seized Urum al-Kubrah from \"pro-government militias\", opening the way to lay siege to Base 46. By January 2014, the town was controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n|-\n|Urum al-Sughrah\n|637\n|Atarib District\n|y\n|Since June 2012, FSA has control. In October 2012, the military base of regiment 46 (west of town) was under siege by rebels who shelled it on a regular basis with mortar and rockets. On 18 November 2012, the base which is considered as one of the most important in north Syria, fell under rebel control, after a 55-day siege On 14 December 2012, the Administrative Affairs College (which is 17&nbsp;km west of central Aleppo and 8&nbsp;km east of the recently captured 46th regiment base) fell under rebel control\n|-\n|Outside listed towns in Aleppo G.\n|\n|—\n|u~52%~27.5% ~20.5%\n|In March 2012, fighting erupted for the first time in the northern Aleppo Governorate. Fighting even spilled over the border into Turkey in May, and by the end of that month, the rebels could report effective control over most of the northern Aleppo countryside. Assad's security forces lost control of almost all of the countryside north of Aleppo in late July, fleeing an offensive by rebel groups from across the rural north. Since then, local village committees that steered the uprising have shifted gears, transforming themselves into interim village governments. Rebel checkpoints dot the winding single-lane roads between the region's farming villages and towns. The countryside stretching from Aleppo to the Turkish border about  away has been cleared of government forces. Across the scattered farm towns, locals have formed councils to remove rubble, restore utilities and funnel supplies to fighters in Aleppo. They organize security patrols to guard against thieves and government spies. Some are running prisons and rudimentary courts. On 1 January 2013, it was reported that a large majority of the Governorate was under rebel control. At 30 June 2017, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) fully withdrew from all of their remaining positions in the Aleppo province to government forces.\n|}\nDamascus and Rif Damashq Governorates\n{| class=\"toccolours sortable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|+\n|- style=\"background:lavender;\"\n!Name\n!Population\n!District\n!Held by\n!History during the Syrian Civil War\n|-\n|Damascus – Barzeh\n|47,339\n|Damascus District\n|n\n|Barzeh, a suburb of Damascus, was reported to be contested as of 7 December 2012. A truce in Barzeh was signed in January 2014. Government footage showed bulldozers clearing rubble and the local governor speaking to residents; footage from the rebels showed their fighters were still present, neither shooting nor being rounded up. The deal was voluntary; rebels were tired and wanted their destroyed town cleaned up. On 14 April, Barzeh, a suburb of Damascus, was reported to be under army control. See also: Damascus offensive.In February 2017, the Government demanded that the rebels leave Barzeh as well as the neighbouring Tishreen neighbourhood.

On 19 July 2012, the Syrian Army stormed the rebel held Qaboun neighborhood with a large number of tanks. On 20 July, the Syrian Army continued its counterattack, storming the neighborhood of Jobar in Damascus, searching for rebels. The rebels confirmed they had been forced to withdraw from Al-Midan after the army assault. Rebel fighters stormed and burned the Sa'iqa military camp, which was being used as a training facility, in the Basateen al-Mezzeh neighborhood in central Damascus. The conflict reached a decisive phase in late July. Government forces managed to break the rebel offensive on Damascus by pushing out most of the opposition fighters. In November 2012, there was renewed fighting in some of the neighborhoods (Qaboun, Jobar, Qadam) after a regain in strength of the rebels in Rif Dimashq. The Mezzeh Military airport and its nearby military bases are home to the 4th Armored Division. These bases protect central Damascus from the rebel forces in Darayya and Muadamiyat al-Sham. The nearby Mazzeh 86 neighborhood is an Alawite slum and the point of origin for many pro-government militias.See also: Rif Dimashq Governorate campaign\n|-\n|Darayya\n|78,763\n|Darayya District\n|r\n|See Darayya during Syrian Civil War.\n|-\n|Douma\n|110,893\n|Douma District\n|y\n|A battle began on 21 January 2012, after FSA fighters changed their tactics from attack and retreat guerrilla warfare in the suburbs of Damascus to an all-out assault on army and loyalist units. Earlier in January, the FSA had gained control over large portions of Douma. On 31 January 2012, the Syrian Army retakes Douma. Hundreds of troops controlled the mostly deserted streets and arrested hundreds of people. Complete control was achieved on 30 June when Syrian army troops entered all parts of Douma. On 18 October, after heavy fighting, the FSA retook control of the city. On 30 October, there were continuing fights in Douma. It was reported to be under rebel control as of 7 December 2012.

The city was also one of the places where the rebel retreated after their defeat in Damascus. At the end of July, rebels were gathering and massing in Al-Tall to ready themselves for another attack on Damascus. At the beginning of August, the Syrian Army started shelling the rebel positions more intensively. The city became completely besieged by the Army after the capture of 3 Syrian journalists by the rebels near the city.

Rebels and loyalist troops had reached an uneasy stalemate in the city by the time the ceasefire went into effect in mid-April, since neither side had been able to expel the other from the town, but by the end of May, the pace of fighting had picked up again and gun battles raged two out of every three days in al-Qusayr On 10 July 2012, Al-Qusayr was completely under rebel control with the city being under siege from the surrounding countryside.

There followed reports that the military was massacring members of the Syrian opposition. The reports were mostly from civilians fleeing over the Kabir River into Lebanon to escape the violence. By 19 May, the military finished its operation and withdrew from Talkalakh. Since June 2012, FSA has controlled some neighbourhoods of the city, however, the government has retained control of loyalist and mixed neighbourhoods. In late October 2012, Talkalakh was under siege by the army. On 12 February 2013, a CNN report from inside Talkalakh revealed that the town itself was under rebel control, though government forces were only a matter of yards away, surrounding the town. Nevertheless, there was no fighting in or around the town thanks to a tenuous ceasefire between the warring sides brokered by a local sheikh and an Alawite member of parliament. Though isolated clashes have occurred, killing three rebels, and though government forces have been accused of harassing civilians since its implementation, the ceasefire has largely held. The town has returned to a degree of normal function, and some shops have started to re-open. Even the governor of Homs Province has been able to meet with rebels in the town and has called the ceasefire an \"experiment\". Both sides reject sectarianism, stressing the need to keep foreign jihadist fighters out of the country. Nevertheless, rebels in the town stated that they remained committed to overthrowing Assad. On 23 June, the Syrian Army captured the town. Following the assault, 39 local leaders of the Free Syrian Army surrendered and handed over their weapons.

As early as 23 March, it was reported Binnish was one of their next targets. Binnish is on a hill, so it is harder to assault. The Syrian Army had agreed to Kofi Annan's peace plan and to withdraw troops by 10 April. By 3 April, CNN reported the Syrian Army was assaulting Binnish with tanks and helicopters. On 4 April 2012, the Syrian Army was still shelling Binnish with citizens fleeing the city. In June, the government has control.

Saraqib was considered an important strategic point because of its size, being the second largest city of the Governorate, and its geographic position at the junction of two highways going to Aleppo: one going south towards Hama, Homs and Damascus, and one going west towards Latakia. It was also used as a base to launch attacks on military convoys. On 24 March, eleven days after the Syrian Army took back Idlib, the Syrian Army shelled the city briefly while leading a ground assault at the same time. A column of tanks entered the city to attack the defenses of the rebels, while infantry backed by snipers led the second wave to pursue the remaining fighters.\nThe Free Syrian Army fighters fought back on the first day and damaged a tank. After the first day, the rebels were forced to withdraw from the city after the army took full control of it.\nIn July 2012, it was reported that the FSA had regained control of the city.\nOn 24 October, there was fierce shelling targeting the city from the Hamsho check point.

Heavy fighting took place on the outskirts of the town, killing 20 people. By 5 April, the military captured Taftanaz's city center, which was defended by 200 FSA fighters, after a two-hour battle, following which the army reportedly rounded up and executed 82 people. It was unknown how many were opposition fighters and how many were civilians. Witnesses in the town said that tanks shelled the town from four sides before armored cars brought in dozens of soldiers who dragged civilians from their homes and gunned them down in the streets, and they also claimed that the soldiers looted, destroyed and torched hundreds of homes, bringing some down on their owners' heads. Videos showed this, and 62 people were killed during the attack, despite the town only having a small rebel presence. Nine government tanks were destroyed by homemade bombs as they left the town. Two months after, two-thirds of the population had left. On 29 August 2012, rebels claim to have attacked a \"military air base in Taftanaz\" damaging several Government helicopters. Their claims could not be independently verified.\nIn November, the town was under rebel control.\nOn 2 January 2013, the strategic Taftanaz military airbase (which rebels have repeatedly tried to capture but failed) was attacked by rebels launching what they called \"the battle to liberate Taftanaz Military airport\" involving three rebel brigades.\n|-\n|Outside listed towns in Idlib G.\n|\n|—\n|t\n|By June 2012, large parts of Idlib Governorate are controlled by FSA who (along with local people), administered justice and the distribution of supplies to residents. Sham Falcons (led by General Mustafa al-Sheikh) operate in Jabal al-Zawiya. Eight out of the 35 villages of the Zawiya Mountain, around 25%, were reportedly under opposition control.

According to residents, government forces had used the building as a barracks, but had abandoned it due to local complaints before the town was taken by rebels. The town's Shi'a minority has since largely fled the village. Al Nusra Front and a number of Islamist militias, along with a small number of FSA groups, now controlled between 70 and 80 percent of Idlib province.\nSee also: 2011–2012 Idlib Governorate clashes, Summer 2011 Jabal al-Zawiya operation, October 2011 Jabal al-Zawiya clashes, December 2011 Jabal al-Zawiya massacres, December 2011 Syrian–Turkish border clash, April 2012 Idlib Governorate Operation, Idlib Governorate clashes (2014) and Northwestern Syria offensive (April 2019–present)\n|}\nLatakia Governorate\n{| class=\"toccolours sortable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|+\n|- style=\"background:lavender;\"\n!Name\n!Population\n!District\n!Held by\n!History during the Syrian Civil War\n|-\n|Latakia\n|383,786\n|Latakia District\n|n\n|See Latakia (Syrian Civil War).\n|-\n|Al-Haffah\n|4,298\n|Al-Haffah District\n|n\n|Al-Haffah is a Sunni Muslim town that lies in the foothills of the coastal mountains that form the heartland of Assad's Alawi sect. It is strategically located close to the port city of Latakia, as well as, the Turkish border which has been used by the rebels to smuggle people and supplies. On 12 June 2012, the military recaptured al-Haffah, and the remaining 200 FSA fighters under heavy bombardment by government forces withdrew from the town. FSA said that the fact that Al-Haffah is surrounded by Alawi villages did not help them.

On 13 October 2012, rebels were attacking the town. Since November 2012, Turkmen rebels tried to take control of the town and its border post, however, they were prevented from doing so by the local Alawite militias formed there. Local Alawite militias continue to exercise control over the area. In late December, the town was reportedly shelled by unspecified forces, but no residents were killed or injured. On 24 March 2014, the Islamist rebels and their jihadist ally Al-Nusra Front seized the small city of Kasab and nearby Kasab border crossing. However they were repelled and forced back by the Syrian army and allied NDF forces (including by Syrian Resistance of Ali Kayali) by the end of June 2014.\n|-\n|Outside listed towns in Latakia G.\n|\n|—\n|p\n|Since June 2012, FSA controls a small part in the northeast. In late July 2012, France 24 reported that the army has been burning forests to avoid FSA hiding in them. By October 2012, the FSA slowly captured most of the Jebel Akrad and Jebel Turkman mountain ranges in the north. Rebels have taken control of six Alawite villages in the region, in some cases intimidating the locals to leave by way of kidnappings, theft, and looting of homes. There are fears even among elements of the opposition that if the conflict continues to spread, rebel forces may perpetrate larger sectarian revenge killings. The region of the province now controlled by rebels was home to a sizeable Kurdish minority prior to the war. Most Kurds have fled from the 60 villages in the region they once inhabited due to the fighting, but many are too poor to afford to flee to neighbouring Turkey. Those who are internally displaced have resettled in refugee camps close to the border, such as one near Khirbet al-Joz, where a farmer has been converting part of his land with the help of a Qatari company into a camp that will be able to house 10,000 refugees once completed. According to Human Rights Watch, rebel forces also broke into and looted churches in the Christian villages of Ghassaniyeh and Jdeideh after taking control of them, though it was not clear if sectarianism was the motive. Several locals had been kidnapped by rebels, who also looted homes. Much of the population of the villages had fled.
