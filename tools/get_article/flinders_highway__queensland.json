The road continues as the Barkly Highway from Cloncurry to the Northern Territory border at Camooweal and beyond. The Flinders Highway passes a number of small outback towns and typical outback landscape predominates towards the inland. It was known as National Route 78 before Queensland began to convert to the alphanumeric system being adopted in Australia and is now designated as A6. The highway is also known as Overlanders Way. Its entire length is part of the National Land Transport Network (formerly Auslink).\nState-controlled road\nFlinders Highway is a state-controlled national road. It is defined in five sections, as follows:\n* Number 14A, Townsville to Charters Towers.\n* Number 14B, Charters Towers to Hughenden.\n* Number 14C, Hughenden to Richmond.\n* Number 14D, Richmond to Julia Creek.\n* Number 14E, Julia Creek to Cloncurry.\nHistory\nAs at 1957, only the Townsville to Charters Towers section was sealed. The rest of the highway was progressively sealed with the last section completed in November 1976.\nIn the 1980s, the second stage of the Ross River Dam necessitated a deviation of the Flinders Highway and Mount Isa railway line (which previously ran straight north-south) to be further east. This was completed by 1986 and resulted in the closure of Toonpan and Barringha railway stations on the removed route; they were not re-established on new route.\nNorthern Australia Roads Program upgrades\nThe Northern Australia Roads Program announced in 2016 included two projects for the Flinders Highway.\nPavement strengthening\nThe project for pavement strengthening and rehabilitation between Townsville and Torrens Creek was expected to finish in late 2021 at a total cost of $22.2 million.\nReplacement of culverts\nThe project for replacement of culverts between Charters Towers and Richmond was completed in late 2018 at a total cost of $15.1 million.\nRoads of Strategic Importance upgrades\nThe Roads of Strategic Importance initiative, last updated in March 2022, includes the following projects for the Flinders Highway.\nCorridor upgrade\nA lead project to upgrade the Queensland section of the Tennant Creek to Townsville corridor, including sections of the Barkly and Flinders Highways, the Kennedy Developmental Road and surrounding state and council roads, at an estimated cost of $250 million, was in the planning stage in 2020.\nOvertaking lanes\nA project to construct overtaking lanes between Townsville and Charters Towers at a cost of $33.4 million is planned to be completed by mid-2023. This project is targeted for \"early works\" by the Queensland Government, and has been split into two packages.\nPavement strengthening and widening\nA project to strengthen and widen the pavement at Scrubby Creek, between Julia Creek and Cloncurry, at a cost of $32.6 million is due for completion in early 2024. This project is targeted for \"early works\" by the Queensland Government.\nWide centre line treatment\nA project to deliver wide centre lines on a section of road between Townsville and Charters Towers at a cost of $9.7 million was due for completion in early 2022. This project was targeted for \"early works\" by the Queensland Government, and was split into two packages.\nOther upgrades\nConstruct acceleration lane\nA project to construct an acceleration lane at Woodstock, at a cost of $5 million, was completed in December 2020.\nTowns\nCharters Towers\nCharters Towers, 133&nbsp;km to the south west from Townsville.
