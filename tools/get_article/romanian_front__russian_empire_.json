Nominally. the commanding officer of the front was King Ferdinand I of Romania; however, the de facto power lay in his \"deputies,\" which were Imperial Russian Army generals delegated by the Russian Stavka.\nInitially the front consisted of three armies: the Russian 4th, 6th, and 9th Armies. Soon it was joined by the forces of the Romanian 1st Army under General Constantin Cristescu and the Romanian Second Army under Alexandru Averescu, and, in September 1917, by the Russian 8th Army.\nFollowing the October Revolution of 7 November 1917, the front was merged with the Southwestern Front as the Ukrainian Front under administration of the Central Rada of Ukraine.\nComposition\nCommand\n;Commander in Chief\n* 1916 – 1918 King of Romania Ferdinand I\n;Deputies of the Commander in Chief\n* 12.12.1916 – 01.04.1917 — General of Cavalry Vladimir Viktorovich Sakharov\n* 11.04.1917 – 25.03.1918 — General of Infantry Dmitry Shcherbachev\n;Chief of Staff\n* 12.12.1916 – 08.04.1917 – General Mikhail Shishkevich\n* 17.04.1917 – 15.10.1917 – General Nikolai Golovin\n* 23.10.1917 – ? – General Georgy Viranovsky\nComponenets\n* Danubian Army (as a separate army of the Southwestern Front supporting the Romanian Armed Forces, merged with the Russian 6th Army)\n;Original composition (December 1916)\n* 4th Army (from Western Front, General Alexander Ragoza (HQ in Bacău))\n**8th Army Corps (General Anton Denikin)\n**7th Army Corps (General Arkadiy Sychevskiy)\n**30th Army Corps (?)\n**separate formations\n* 6th Army (from Petrograd, General  (HQ in Bolhrad))\n**4th Army Corps (General )\n**47th Army Corps (General V.
