The People's Republic of Zanzibar had been created the previous year during a revolution in the Sultanate of Zanzibar, which 1890–1963 was a semi-independent Protectorate of the United Kingdom.\nThe high commissioner to Tanzania is also the UK representative to the East African Community.\nList of heads of mission\nAgents and consuls-general to the Sultanate of Zanzibar\n*1902–1904: Sir Charles Eliot (while he was Commissioner for the British East Africa Protectorate (later Kenya))\nHigh commissioners\nTanganyika\n*1961–1963: Sir Neil Pritchard\nUnited Republic of Tanzania\n*1964–1965: Robert Fowler\n*1965–1968: &nbsp; Diplomatic relations severed due to situation with Rhodesia\n*1968–1972: Horace Phillips\n*1972–1974: Arthur Kellas\n*1975–1978: Mervyn Brown\n*1978–1982: Peter Moon\n*1982–1985: John Sankey\n*1986–1989: Colin Imray\n*1989–1992: Thorold Masefield\n*1992–1995: Roger Westbrook\n*1995–1998: Alan Montgomery\n*1998–2001: Bruce Dinwiddy\n*2001–2003: Richard Clarke\n*2003–2006: Andrew Pocock\n*2006–2009: Philip Parham\n*2009–2013: Diane Corner\n*2013–2016: Dianna Melrose\n*2016-2020 Sarah Cooke,\n*2020–: David Concar\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gov.uk/government/world/tanzania UK and Tanzania], gov.uk"
