Her father, Gary King, played at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. Her brother, Stephen, played at Ohio University.\nFrom 1994 to 2000, she attended the Academy of Holy Angels, a Catholic coeducational high school in Richfield, Minnesota, where she became the first and only 7th grader in school history to play on the varsity girls' basketball team.\nFrom 2000 to 2005, she played the point guard position on the women's team at Stanford University.\nDuring her freshman season, she injured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her right knee, and missed the final 21 games of the year. While recuperating, she met her future husband, Curtis Borchardt, then a sophomore on Stanford's men's basketball team, who had just suffered a stress fracture in his right foot and missed the final 14 games of his season. Eventually, they married in August 2003.\nAfter graduating, Curtis joined the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) while Susan spent her senior year at Stanford.\nAfter graduating with a degree in psychology, she was selected by the Minnesota Lynx during the 2005 WNBA draft. She saw limited time with the Lynx, playing in only three games during the regular season before being waived by the team.\nCareer statistics\nCollege\nSource\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Year\n|Team\n|GP\n|Points\n|FG%\n|3P%\n|FT%\n|RPG\n|APG\n|SPG\n|BPG\n|PPG\n|-\n|2001-02\n|Stanford\n|2\n|7\n|22.2%\n|25.0%\n|100.0%\n|3.0\n|2.5\n|1.0\n| -\n|3.5\n|-\n|2002-03\n|Stanford\n|30\n|190\n|39.0%\n|32.7%\n|81.1%\n|1.3\n|1.5\n|0.9\n|0.1\n|6.3\n|-\n|2003-04\n|Stanford\n|34\n|289\n|47.9%\n|43.7%\n|91.4%\n|1.2\n|2.6\n|0.9\n|0.1\n|8.5\n|-\n|2004-05\n|Stanford\n|20\n|172\n|53.0%\n|44.9%\n|85.0%\n|1.9\n|1.8\n|0.9\n|0.1\n|8.6\n|-\n|Career\n|\n|86\n|658\n|45.7%\n|40.1%\n|86.2%\n|1.4\n|2.0\n|0.9\n|0.1\n|7.7\n|}\nWNBA\nRegular season\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 2005\n| align=\"left\" | Minnesota\n| 3 || 0 || 5.7 || .000 || .000 || .750 || 0.3 || 0.3 || 0.0 || 0.3 || 0.0 || 1.0\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Career\n| align=\"left\" | 1 year, 1 team\n| 3 || 0 || 5.7 || .000 || .000 || .750 || 0.3 || 0.3 || 0.0 || 0.3 || 0.0 || 1.0\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050901003434/http://gostanford.collegesports.com/sports/w-baskbl/mtt/borchardt_susanking00.html Stanford basketball profile]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090341/http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/susan_kingborchardt/?nav=page WNBA Player Profile]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040810053319/http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595052520,00.html March 30, 2004 Deseret News article on her marriage with Curtis Borchardt]\n* [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/womensbasketball/tourney05/2005-03-16-borchardt-marriage_x.htm March 16, 2005 USA Today article on the couple]"
