State voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nDelaware was won by Governor Thomas E. Dewey (R–New York), running with Governor Earl Warren, with 50.04% of the popular vote, against incumbent President Harry S. Truman (D–Missouri), running with Senator Alben W. Barkley, with 48.76% of the popular vote. This is the last time that New Castle County did not back the statewide winner and when the Democratic candidate would win a presidential election without Delaware.\nThis election marks one of three times in the 20th century that the state voted for the losing candidate, along with 1932 and 1916. As this was the last election until 2000 when Delaware failed to support the overall winner of the presidency, and the electoral college after which the state has leaned Democratic. However, it has since voted for the popular vote loser only twice, in 2004 and 2024.\nResults\nResults by county\n{| width=\"60%\"  class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| County\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Thomas E.
