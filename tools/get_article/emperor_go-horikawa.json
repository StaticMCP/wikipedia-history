His reign spanned the years from 1221 through 1232.\nThis 13th-century sovereign was named after the 11th-century Emperor Horikawa and go- (後), translates literally as \"later\"; and thus, he is sometimes called the \"Later Emperor Horikawa\". The Japanese word go has also been translated to mean the \"second one;\" and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as \"Horikawa, the second,\" or as \"Horikawa II.\"\nGenealogy\nBefore his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his imina) was , also known as Motsihito-shinnō.\nThe third son of Imperial Prince Morisada (守貞親王) (Go-Takakura-in, 後高倉院), the second son of Emperor Takakura.\n*Empress (Jingū): Sanjō (Fujiwara) Ariuko (三条（藤原）有子) later Ankimon’in (安喜門院), Sanjo Kinfusa's daughter\n*Empress (Chūgū): Konoe (Fujiwara) Nagako (近衛（藤原）長子) Later Takatsukasa’in (鷹司院), Konoe Iezane’s daughter.\n*Empress (Chūgū): Kujō (Fujiwara) Shunshi (九条（藤原）竴子) Later Sōhekimon’in (藻璧門院), Kujo Michiie’s daughter\n**First son: Imperial Prince Mitsuhito (秀仁親王) later Emperor Shijō\n**Fourth daughter: Imperial Princess Hoshi (暤子内親王; 1232-1237)\n**Second Son: (1233)\n*Lady-in-waiting: Betto-Naishi (別当典侍), Jimyōin Ieyuki’s daughter\n**First daughter: Imperial Princess Kishi (暉子内親王; 1228-1300) later Muromachi-in (室町院)\n**Second daughter: Imperial Princess Taishi (体子内親王; 1231-1302) later Shinsenmon’in (神仙門院)\n*Lady-in-waiting: Dainagon-no-Tsubone (大納言局), Fujiwara Kaneyoshi’s daughter\n**Third daughter: Imperial Princess Akiko (昱子内親王; 1231-1246)\nEvents of Go-Horikawa's life\nIn 1221, because of the Jōkyū Incident, an unsuccessful attempt by Emperor Go-Toba to seize real power, the Kamakura shogunate completely excluded those of the imperial family descended from Emperor Go-Toba from the Chrysanthemum Throne,  thus forcing Emperor Chūkyō to abdicate.  After the Genpei War, he, as the grandson of the late Emperor Takakura, who was also a nephew of the then-exiled Retired Emperor Go-Toba, and Chūkyō's first cousin, was enthroned as Go-Horikawa.  He ruled from July 29, 1221 to October 26 (?), 1232.\n* 29 July 1221 (Jōkyū 3, 9th day of the 7th month): In the 1st year of what is now considered to have been Chūkyō-tennōs reign (仲恭天皇一年), he abruptly abdicated without designating an heir; and contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (‘‘senso’’)  was received by a grandson of former Emperor Go-Toba.\n* 14 January 1222 (Jōkyū 3, 1st day of the 12th month): Emperor Go-Horikawa acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).\nAs Go-Horikawa was only ten-years-old at this time, his father Imperial Prince Morisada acted as cloistered emperor under the name Go-Takakura-in.\nIn 1232, he began his own cloistered rule, abdicating to his 1-year-old son, Emperor Shijō.  However, he had a weak constitution, and his cloistered rule lasted just under two years before he died.\nEmperor Go-Horikawa's Imperial tomb (misasagi) is at Sennyū-ji in the .\nKugyō\nKugyō (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Go-Horikawa's reign, this apex of the  Daijō-kan included:\n* Sesshō, Konoe Iezane, d. 1242.\n* Sadaijin, Konoe Iemichi, 1204–1224.\n* Udaijin,  Fujiwara Kintsugu, 1117–1227.\n* Naidaijin, Saionji Kintsune, 1171–1224.\n* Dainagon\nEras of Go-Horikawa's reign\nThe years of Go-Horikawa's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.\n* Jōkyū      (1219–1222 CE)\n* Jōō  (1222–1224 CE)\n* Gennin           (1224–1225 CE)\n* Karoku           (1225–1227 CE)\n* Antei            (1227–1229 CE)\n* Kangi            (1229–1232 CE)\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\nNotes\n— a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nReferences\n* Brown, Delmer M. and Ichirō Ishida, eds.
