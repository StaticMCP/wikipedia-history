Posse,  Dwayne Simon was the only member left of the group willing to work on Walking with a Panther, as other members, such as Bobby \"Bobcat\" Erving, wanted a higher pay after realizing how much of a success the previous album had become. Def Jam, however, refused to change the contract, which caused the L.A. Posse to leave. Walking with a Panther was primarily produced by LL Cool J and Dwayne Simon, with additional production from Rick Rubin and Public Enemy's production team, the Bomb Squad.\nReception\n|rev2 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n|rev2Score =\n|rev3 = Q\n|rev3score =\n|rev4 = Rolling Stone\n|rev4score =\n|rev5 = The Village Voice\n|rev5Score = A−\n}}\nWalking with a Panther was a commercial success, peaking at number six on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it spent four weeks. The album contained the singles \"Going Back to Cali\", \"I'm That Type of Guy\", \"Jingling Baby\", \"Big Ole Butt\" and \"One Shot at Love\", which also achieved chart success. Walking with a Panther, however, was met with a mixed response from the hip-hop community at the time of its release, which was un-favorable of several of the album's love ballads. Despite this, Walking With a Panther was well received by music critics. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nTrack listing\nAll tracks produced by LL Cool J & Dwayne Simon except where noted.\n| writer2         = Simon, Smith\n| length2         = 3:31\n| title3          = Fast Peg\n| writer3         = Smith, Bryan Philpot\n| extra3          = Co-produced by DJ Cut Creator\n| length3         = 1:38\n| title4          = Clap Your Hands\n| writer4         = Smith\n| length4         = 5:07\n| title5          = Nitro\n| writer5         = Smith, Eric Sadler, Hank Shocklee\n| extra5          = Co-produced by The Bomb Squad\n| length5         = 4:43\n| title6          = You're My Heart\n| writer6         = Simon, Smith\n| length6         = 4:42\n| title7          = I'm That Type of Guy\n| writer7         = Simon, Smith, Steve Ett\n| length7         = 5:16\n| title8          = Why Do You Think They Call It Dope?\n| writer8         = Brian Latture, Simon, Smith\n| length8         = 3:49\n| title9          = Going Back to Cali\n| writer9         = Smith, Rick Rubin\n| extra9          = Produced by Rick Rubin\n| length9         = 4:09\n| title10         = It Gets No Rougher\n| writer10        = Smith, Sadler, H.
