As the owner of a major metalworking concern known as the Duffryn Steel and Tinplate Works, he had the resources to fund a number of philanthropic and charitable endeavours for which he was recognised in the 1921 Birthday Honours by being created, at the unusually young age of 32, a baronet of Treforis in the County of Glamorgan.\nEdwards married Kathleen Ermyntrude Corfield, daughter of John Corfield, managing director of Dillwyn & Co, on 18 January 1911. They had a son and a daughter. In the years following his death, Hendrefoilan House, which he purchased in 1920, became part of the campus of Swansea University and was the site, until 2006, of the South Wales Miners' Library.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*Who Was Who, vol II, 1916−1928 (third edition, 1962).
