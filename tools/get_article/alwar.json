It is located 150&nbsp;km south of Delhi and 150&nbsp;km north of Jaipur.\nEtymology\nThere are several theories about the derivation of the name Alwar. Alexander Cunningham, the British Indian archeologist, believed that the city derived its name from the Salva tribe and was originally Salwapur, then Salwar, Halawar and eventually Alwar, According to another school it was known as Aravalpur or the city of Aravali.\nSome others opine that the city is named after Khanzada Alawal Khan Mewati (the Muslim Khanzada prince who wrested Alwar from Nikumbh Rajputs). A research conducted during the reign of Maharaja Jai Singh of Alwar revealed that Maharaja Alaghraj, second son of Maharaja Kakil of Amber. ruled the area in the eleventh century and his territory extended up to the present city of Alwar. He founded the city of Alpur in 1106 Vikrami Samvat (1049 A.D.) after his own name which eventually became Alwar. It was formerly spelt as Ulwar but in the reign of Jai Singh the spelling was changed to Alwar. Some sources say that the name Alwar comes from the Persian word timber.\nHistory\nAncient history\nThe ancient name of Alwar is Salva or Salwa. Alwar was a part of the Matsya Kingdom, one of the 16 ancient Mahājanapadas. In late Vedic texts (such as the Jaiminiya Brahmana), the Salva or Salvi tribe is described as a non-Vedic tribe that occupied Kurukshetra and conquered the Kuru kingdom.\nThe Salvas\nThe Salvas settled along the Yamuna river and the Alwar province of Rajasthan after attacking the Kuru kingdom, and they later accepted Vedic culture by the end of the Vedic era as they converged with the remaining Kurus and the Surasena mahajanapada, near Matsya kingdom.\nMedieval history\nAlwar was ruled by multiple dynasties. Notable dynasties included the Jadauns of Karauli, Nikumbh Rajputs, the Khanzada Rajputs, the Badgujar Rajputs, Gaur rajputs and  the Rao Sahab of Rewari who took the control over this area. The Maratha Empire also ruled this region for a short period. Rao Raja of Rewari, captured the Alwar Fort from the Rajput Naruka  and laid down the foundation for modern day Alwar.\nWali-e-Mewat Raja Khanzada Alawal Khan, Bahadur, son of Khanzada Zakaria Khan Mewati, was the Khanzada Rajput ruler of Mewat from 1485 till 1504.[1] He was succeeded by his son Hasan Khan Mewati as Wali-e-Mewat in 1504. In 1492 he won Bala Quila from Nikumbh Rajputs to stop the practice of human sacrifice.[2] It is also believed that the city of Alwar is named after him.\nHemchandra Vikramaditya (Hemu), born in Machari, Rajgarh, a village in Alwar, was a Hindu emperor of North India during the 16th century. This was a period when the Mughals and Afghans were vying for power in the region. Hemu captured Delhi on 7 October 1556 after defeating the Mughal forces in the Battle of Delhi in the Tughlaqabad area in Delhi, and became the de facto emperor. He won twenty-two battles in succession and became the last Hindu emperor of Delhi. In 1556, after his defeat in the Second Battle of Panipat, he was executed and Mughal regime was restored in North India. In 1781, the Battle of Mandan fought between Raos of Rewari under leadership of Mitrasen and Rajput Sardar Shardul helped by Mughals. Both side seen heavy casualties with only 6000 Ahirs defeated 25000 rajput forces. The whole area annexed by Raos of Rewari.\nColonial era\n]]\nThe Princely state of Alwar was established in 1770 by a Kachwaha Rajput named Pratap Singh Naruka who was earlier a jagirdar of \"Dhai Gaon\" (two-and-a-half villages) near Machari. His successor, Bakhtawar Singh Naruka, was defeated after launching an armed incursion into neighbouring Jaipur State (ruled by their Kachwaha seniors, erstwhile overlords of his predecessor) and being forced to accept the consequent treaty mediated by East India Company prohibiting him from political relations with other states without the consent of the colonial British. According to the \"Gazetteer of Ulwar\" published by the British Raj], Alwar State was subdivided into four regions:\n* Rath region: current Behror and Neemrana, was ruled by Lah Chauhan Rajput zamindar who had descended from Prithviraj Chauhan. Sahesh Mal was a son of Raja Sangat Singh Chauhan. Sangat was the great-grandson of Chahir Deo Chauhan, brother of famous king Prithviraj Chauhan. In accordance with the pledge by the Raja Sangat Singh Chauhan to his younger queen for marrying her in his old age, her two sons from him were bestowed the Rath area and its headquarter of Mandhan near Neemrana. King Sangat Singh Chauhan's 19 sons from the older queen set out to seek their fortunes. Of the 19 brothers, Harsh Dev Chauhan and Sahesh Mal Chauhan arrived in the Gurgaon district.  Lah Chauhan, the ruler of Rath, was a son of raja Sangat Singh Chauhan by the younger Rani whose two sons became inheritors of Raja Sangat Singh's territory of Rath with its headquarter at Mandhan when other 19 sons from the other wives were required to quit the kingdom as per the promise of Raja Sangat. Rao NandRam Ahir rule rath and Tijara during Aurangzeb rule. Later Rao Mitrasen Ahir defeated combined forces of Sekhawat and kachwa Rajput at Mandhan. After decline of Mughal Empire, Rao Tez Singh (1766-1823) was ruler of Rath and Tijara (Ahirwal). He was grandfather of freedom fighter Rao Tula Ram.Henry Miers Elliot, [https://archive.org/details/supplementtoglo00elligoog/page/n249  Supplemental Glossary of Terms Used in the North Western Provinces]\nAlwar]]\n*  Wai region: current Bansur and Thana Ghazi, was ruled by Shekhawat rajput zamindars.\n*  Narukhand region: current Rajgarh and Laxmangarh, was ruled by Naruka clan of Rajputs same as that of the ruling kings of the Alwar State\n*  Mewat region: current Palwal and Nuh districts, had the highest population of the Meo Muslims.\nPost-independence\nAlwar acceded to the dominion of India following the independence of India in 1947.
