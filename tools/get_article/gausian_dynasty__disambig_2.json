Under their rule, the Lombards first migrated into the Italian peninsula. The Gausi traced their lineage back to the Goths, for the family had originated from the marriage between Audoin and Rodelinda, daughter of Ermanafrid, the last king of the Thuringians, and Amalaberga, daughter of Amalafrida, consort of Thrasamund, king of the Vandals, and sister of Theodoric the Great king of the Goths.\nThe Gausi were a prominent family when, in 539, the Lombards came under the rule of a minor, Walthari of the Lethings clan, and a Gausian, Audoin, was elected his regent. In 547, Audoin succeeded Walthari, who died young of natural causes, and assumed the royal mantle by usurpation. Audoin's son and successor, Alboin, led the Lombards into Italy in 569 and made the Lombard kings into kings of Italy. To strengthen his power, Alboin contracted several dynastic marriages, first with Chlothsind of the Merovingian dynasty, then with the Gepid Rosamund. Alboin died without male heirs in 572 or 573 and his successor was Cleph of the Beleos clan.\nThe noble house of the Gausi continued through the first duke of Friuli, Gisulf I of Friuli, nephew of Alboin and grandson of Audoin. His heirs would eventually go on to secure power in the Duchy of Benevento, leading to the establishment of another Gausian king of Italy, Grimoald of Benevento.\nReligion\nOriginally pagans, around the mid-6th century the Gausi, like other Lombards, had adopted Christianity in its Arian form. They adhered to this religion at least until the second half of the 7th century. However, since the time of Duke Romuald I of Benevento, members of the Gausi family are mentioned in sources only as supporters of Roman Catholic Church.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
