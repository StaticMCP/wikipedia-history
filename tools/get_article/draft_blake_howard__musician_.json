He eventually graduated to cardboard boxes, pillows, couches and cookie tins according to his own account. At 11 years old his Father took him to buy a blue Stewart snare drum in Rexdale near the Sears Warehouse, from a woman who said, \"Remember me when you're famous...\". The next year a full drumset appeared in the living room on Christmas Day. He was most intrigued by the hi-hat.\nBiography\nAt a very young age Blake began to play on whatever sound making objects that could be found and gradually this was developed into a playing style recognized as sympathetic, with an empathetic heart. All of this has been generated and supported by exploring music from all points, including accompanying contemporary dance classes, as well as attending\nto the music for dance performances in a wide range of settings. Starting at Banting Memorial High School in the mid '80's with a group known as 'Subject To Change', (this accordingly changed into 'Sundog', then was briefly named 'Full Fathom Five' and in the end became 'Glueleg') a great number of experiences took place before moving to Toronto (in the late summer of 1991) to further investigate just what it was that was taking place.  There, there was the good fortune (starting in May, 1997) of studying 'time' with Jim Blackley over a seven year period divided into two intervals. So many teachers. One Teacher.\nBeing a member of the continually exfoliating group known as GUH (a.k.a. guh or Guh with the possibility of gUH and/or gUh and finally guH) from shortly after their inception in 1991, would provide background for contributions to such beautiful artists as Sandro Perri, Brodie West with and without Eucalyptus, Dave Clark, Jason Kenemy, Emily Mover, Alex Lukashevsky, Reflectiostack, Justin Haynes, Ryan Driver, Josh Cole, Michael Davidson, Slow Loris, Rock Plaza Central, Kurt Newman, Mike Smith, Kim Barlow, Kyp Harness, Emily Millard, Dun Dun Band, Marker Starling, Alexandra Babiak, Peter Zummo, Andrew Whiteman, Anne Waldman, Jesse Dara, Quadruped, Ayal Senior, Little Annie, Priya Thomas, Dana Sipos, Steph Yates (Cots), Don Rooke (The Henrys), Michael White, Maggie Keogh and once in a while, even Spooky Ruben.\nSerious Repercussions  (2015-present)\nMade up of mini-cassette recordings from the 2004 Dusk Dances Tour of Southern Ontario, as well as home recordings on the same device, plus a two day session at 6 Nassau, this proposed multi-layered, multi-album project of which two have been released so far, explores simultaneity and the mystery of déjà vu.\nReferences\nExternal Links\n* https://blakehoward.bandcamp.com/\n* https://www.discogs.com/artist/589660-Blake-Howard\n* https://guhmusic1.bandcamp.com/\n* https://slowloris3.bandcamp.com/\n* https://submutations.bandcamp.com/album/submutations-turn-up-live-inside-la-revolucion"
