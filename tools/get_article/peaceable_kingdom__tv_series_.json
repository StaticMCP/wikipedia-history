The series, created by Art Monterastelli and developed by Mark Waxman, was a joint production of Victoria Productions in association with Columbia Pictures Television for CBS. It was cancelled after only seven episodes (though twelve episodes were produced).\nOverview\nPeaceable Kingdom stars Lindsay Wagner as the recently hired managing director of the Los Angeles County Zoo, who was also recently widowed with three children. Her zoologist colleagues included Tom Wopat and David Ackroyd.\nPerhaps due to scheduling competition from other networks (NBC's Top 20 hit Unsolved Mysteries and ABC's Top 30 hits Growing Pains and Head of the Class), Peaceable Kingdom was a ratings failure and CBS cancelled the series after seven episodes. The remaining episodes aired some years later in syndication.\nSome scenes of the series was shot on location at the San Diego Zoo and the Los Angeles Zoo.\nCast\n* Lindsay Wagner as Rebecca Cafferty\n* Melissa Clayton as Courtney Cafferty\n* Michael Manasseri as Dean Cafferty\n* Victor Di Mattia as Sam Cafferty\n* David Ackroyd as Dr. Bartholomew Langley\n* Tom Wopat as Dr. Jed McFadden\n* Conchata Ferrell as Kate Galindo\n* David Renan as Sequoya Ridge\n* Kathryn Spitz as Robin\nEpisodes\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|OriginalAirDate=\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|OriginalAirDate=UNAIRED\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n|OriginalAirDate=UNAIRED\n|ShortSummary=\n|LineColor=\n}}\n}}\nReferences\n*Brooks, Tim, and Marsh, Earle, The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows\nExternal links\n*"
