Kentucky voters chose 11 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nKentucky being captured by the Union and driving out the Confederacy early in the war was won by the Democratic candidate, 4th Commanding General of the United States Army George B. McClellan of New Jersey and his running mate Representative George H. Pendleton of Ohio. They defeated the National Union candidate, incumbent Republican President Abraham Lincoln of Illinois and his running mate former Senator and Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson. McClellan won the state in a landslide, by a margin of 39.64%.\nDespite having been born and raised for the first five years of his life in the state, Kentucky would end up being Lincoln's weakest state and McClellan's strongest state. In addition, Kentucky was the only state that McClellan won by more than 6%. As of the 2024 presidential election, this is the last occasion when Butler County and Monroe County voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.\nResults\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Kentucky\nReferences"
