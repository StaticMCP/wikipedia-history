Woody Island is an uninhabited coral/mangrove island, but the main attraction is Low Isle, a typical tropical island with vegetation and a sandy, coral cay surrounded by  of reef.\nThe Low Isles are a Marine National Park Zone. Day visitors come to the island via a number of commercial operators. There is a lagoon where private vessels can moor or anchor (outside the reef protection markers) overnight, but there is no overnight accommodation on the island. There is a weather station and a lighthouse. Caretakers are permanently on Low Island and monitor both islands.\nNo fishing is allowed in the lagoon or within a buffer zone around the islands; the main activity is snorkeling as the coral is excellent. No motorised water sports are permitted in the locality. Fires, including BBQs and dogs are not permitted on either island.\nReferences"
