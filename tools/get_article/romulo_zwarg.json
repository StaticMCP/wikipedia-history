Mainly a defensive midfielder, he can also play as a right-back or a centre-back.\nCareer\nEarly career\nBorn in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Rômulo joined Desportivo Brasil's youth sides at the age of 15, and made his first team debut on 8 August 2018, in a 1–0 Copa Paulista home win over Rio Claro. In September of that year, he was loaned to Cruzeiro and returned to the under-20 squad.\nDeportes La Serena\nRômulo left Cruzeiro in January 2020, after his loan expired, and joined Chilean Primera División club Deportes La Serena on 16 February. He made his professional debut on 4 September, starting in a 1–1 home draw against O'Higgins.\nRômulo scored his first goal at professional level on 21 December 2020, netting his side's second in a 2–0 away win over Universidad de Chile. He started to feature regularly in the 2021 season, but as a right-back.\nLoan to Juventude\nOn 7 January 2022, Rômulo returned to his home country after agreeing to a loan deal with Juventude. He made his Série A debut on 16 April, coming on as a second-half substitute for Rodrigo Soares and scoring his side's only in a 4–1 away loss to América Mineiro.\nRômulo featured rarely as the club suffered relegation, only contributing with eight appearances in the year.\nAthletic-MG\nOn 9 January 2023, Athletic-MG announced the signing of Rômulo. He became an undisputed starter for the side during the 2023 Campeonato Mineiro, scoring once in eight matches as the club was eliminated in the semifinals.\nInternacional\nOn 12 April 2023, Rômulo was announced at Internacional on loan until the end of the year. Initially a fourth-choice behind Johnny Cardoso, Gustavo Campanharo and Gabriel Baralhas, he later overtook Campanharo in the starting eleven, and established himself as a first-choice after Johnny was sold.\nOn 14 January 2024, Inter executed the buyout clause on Rômulo's contract, and the player signed a permanent deal until the end of 2027. Already established as a regular starter, he featured in 47 matches overall during the year.\nTigres UANL\nOn 26 January 2025, Inter announced the transfer of Rômulo to Liga MX club Tigres UANL, for a rumoured fee of US$ 5 million. He was often deployed as a centre-back by manager Guido Pizarro, and scored his first goal for the club on 8 April, netting his side's third in a 3–2 home win over LA Galaxy which qualified the club to the 2025 CONCACAF Champions Cup semifinals.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|State League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Desportivo Brasil\n|2018\n|Paulista A3\n|colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||2||0||2||0\n|-\n|Cruzeiro (loan)\n|2019\n|Série A\n|0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Deportes La Serena\n|2020\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Chilean Primera División\n|10||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||10||1\n|-\n|2021\n|21||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||25||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!31!!2!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!4!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!35!!2\n|-\n|Juventude (loan)\n|2022\n|Série A\n|4||1||2||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||8||1\n|-\n|Athletic-MG\n|2023\n|Série A\n|colspan=\"2\"|—||7||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||8||1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Internacional\n|2023\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Série A\n|20||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||5||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||25||1\n|-\n|2024\n|30||0||12||0||2||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||47||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!50!!1!!12!!0!!2!!0!!8!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!72!!1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Tigres UANL\n|2024–25\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Liga MX\n|12||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||17||1\n|-\n|2025–26\n|5||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||8||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!17!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!5!!1!!3!!0!!25!!1\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!102!!4!!21!!1!!9!!0!!13!!1!!5!!0!!150!!6\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
