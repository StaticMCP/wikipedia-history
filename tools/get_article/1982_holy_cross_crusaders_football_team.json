Carter, the Crusaders compiled an 8–3 record. Terry Malone, Brian Kelley and Doug O'Donnell were the team captains.\nThis was the Crusaders' first year in Division I-AA, after having competed in the top-level Division I-A and its predecessors since 1896.\nA four-game winning streak to open the campaign put Holy Cross in the weekly national rankings in its first year in Division I-AA, rising as high as No. 4. The Crusaders ended the year ranked No. 13, following a rivalry loss to Tangerine Bowl-bound Boston College of Division I-A.\nHoly Cross played its home games at Fitton Field on the college campus in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n| September 18 |   | UMass |\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 27 14\n| 13,251 |\n| September 25 |   | Dartmouth | 6\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 28 12\n| 18,861 |\n| October 2 | @ | Yale | 5\n| Yale Bowl | New Haven, CT | W 10 6\n| 19,200 |\n| October 9 | @ | #6 Colgate | 4\n| Andy Kerr Stadium | Hamilton, NY | L 17 21\n| 10,000 |\n| October 16 |   | Connecticut | 9\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 10 7\n| 11,441 |\n| October 23 | @ | Brown | 9\n| Brown Stadium | Providence, RI | W 17 6\n| 15,100 |\n| October 30 | @ | Boston University | 6\n| Nickerson Field | Boston, MA | W 34 21\n| 9,130 |\n| November 6 |   | Harvard^ | 7\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 17 24\n| 20,681 |\n| November 13 |   | Maine |\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 21 7\n| 11,111 |\n| November 20 | @ | Boston College | 14\n| Alumni Stadium | Chestnut Hill, MA (rivalry) | L 10 35\n| 32,800 |\n}}\nReferences"
