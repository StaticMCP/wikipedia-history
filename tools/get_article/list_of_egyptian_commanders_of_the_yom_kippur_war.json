It is the fourth Israeli war launched by Egypt and Syria against Israel on Saturday, October 6, 1973, corresponding to the 10th of Ramadan 1393 AH with a surprise attack by the Egyptian army and the Syrian army on the Israeli forces that were stationed in Sinai and the Golan Heights.\nOn the Egyptian front: The Egyptian army achieved the desired strategic goals behind the military surprise of Israel. There were tangible achievements in the first days after the launch of the war, as Egyptian forces penetrated 20&nbsp;km east of the Suez Canal. But at the end of the war, the Israeli army recovered and was able to initiate Operation Abirey-Halev, cross to the western bank of the canal, and impose a siege on the Third Field Army, but it failed to achieve any strategic gains, whether by controlling the city of Suez or the Third Army. During the war, many Arab countries helped Egypt and Syria, whether militarily or economically. Egypt decided to adhere to the Security Council resolution for a ceasefire on October 22, 1973, while Israel agreed on October 24. The first and second disengagement agreements were concluded. Then, after several discussions between Egypt and Israel, a comprehensive peace agreement was reached at Camp David in 1978.\nThe Egyptian military leadership witnessed many changes after the Six-Day War of 1967 until before the October 1973 War:\n* Ministry of War: Amin Howeidi took over the Ministry of War (July 21, 1967 - January 25, 1968), then General Mohamed Fawzi (January 25, 1968 - May 13, 1971) as a result of his resignation.

Then Major General Ahmad Ismail Ali assumed the position (March 10, 1969 - September 10, 1969) but was referred for retirement following Operation Raviv incident. Then the position was held by Lieutenant General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek (September 10, 1969 - May 12, 1971). Then Lieutenant General Saad el-Din el-Shazly (May 16, 1971 - December 12, 1973) until he was dismissed to leave the position to Lieutenant-General Mohamed Abdel Ghani el-Gamasy (December 12, 1973 - 1974).\n* Military Operations Authority: Major General Mohamed Abdel Ghani el-Gamasy (January 1, 1972 - December 12, 1973).\n* Navy: Rear Admiral Mahmoud Abdel Rahman Fahmy (September 11, 1969 - October 24, 1972) was then referred for retirement and was replaced by Rear Admiral Fouad Mohamed Abou Zikry.\n* Air forces: Major General Madkour Abu el-Ezz (June 11, 1967 - November 10, 1967), Air vice-marshal Mustafa el-Hanawi (November 10, 1967 - June 22, 1969), who was referred to retirement as a result of an Israeli air penetration over Cairo, then Air vice-marshal Ali Mustafa Baghdady until April 22, 1972, then he was dismissed and took over.
