He afterward taught for two years, first in Wethersfield, Connecticut and then in Windham, and in 1801 became a tutor at Yale. In 1805 he was appointed to the newly established professorship of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin in there. Kingsley was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1825. He was relieved of a part of his duties in 1831, when a separate professorship of Greek was established, and of another part in 1835, when a professorship of sacred literature was founded, but he continued to instruct in Latin until he resigned in 1851. Kingsley died in New Haven, Connecticut.\nWork\nAs a writer of English, Yale president Timothy Dwight called him the “American Addison”; and Yale president Woolsey said of him, “I doubt if any American scholar has ever surpassed him in Latin style.” He published a discourse on the 200th anniversary of the founding of New Haven, April 25, 1838; editions of Tacitus (Philadelphia), and Cicero, De Oratore (New York); and was the author of a history of Yale college in the American Quarterly Register (1835); a life of Ezra Stiles, president of Yale college, in Sparks's series “American Biography.”\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nFurther reading\n* Daniel Coit Gilman wrote a sketch of his life.
