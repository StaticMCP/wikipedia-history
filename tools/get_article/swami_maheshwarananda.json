His father was an astrologist. Inspired by his parents, he started to learn to meditate when he was 3 years old. He grew up with two brothers and three sisters and soon spent most of his time in prayer and meditation. His father died when he was twelve and his mother sent him to meet his uncle, Swami Madhavananda, at the age of 13 in Nipal. Mangilal showed little interest in schoolwork, but constantly asked his uncle to make him a sannyasi.\nAfter some years Madhavananda granted his wish. Mangilal was prescribed strict yogic exercises and after six months of fasting and meditation he attained the state of self-realisation (1962). He was initiated in the order of swamis in 1967. In 1972 he went to Europe and founded the Austrian-Indian Yoga-Vedanta fellowship in Vienna and the first Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram.\nGuru lineage\nThe guru lineage begins with Sri Alakh Puriji. He was the Guru of Sri Devpuriji. Sri Devpuriji was believed to be an incarnation of Shiva, by his disciples. He lived sometime in the 19-20th century in ashram in a village Kachras in Rajasthan, India.\nHis spiritual successor was named Sri Mahaprabhuji. Sri Mahaprabhuji was born in 1828 and died in 1963 and was therefore believed to be 135 years old at that time. As Sri Devpuriji, he also announced his departure and died in meditation posture after singing OM in the presence of his disciples. Sri Mahaprabhuji was believed to be an incarnation of Vishnu by his disciples and was thought to possess all 24 siddhis. He spent a lot of his life in an ashram built close to Bari Kathu in Rajasthan.\nSri Mahaprabhuji received the title of Paramhansa from Sri Shankaracharya of Shringhari Matha in Pushkar in the presence of Sri Shankaracharya of Puri.\nParamhans Swami Madhavananda spent on the side of Mahaprabhuji more than 20 years and with his permission wrote a book titled \"Lila Amrit\" about the lives of Sri Mahaprabhuji and Sri Devpuriji describing the many miracles they performed. Swami Madhavananda named Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda as his spiritual successor and died in 2003.\nTeachings\nThe main points of Maheshwarananda's teachings are physical, mental, social and spiritual health; respect for life; tolerance for all religions, cultures and nationalities; world peace; protection of human rights and values; protection of the environment and preservation of nature; selfless service, and care and love for all living things. According to his teachings, the realisation of these fundamental principles of life will lead man to spiritual development, self-realisation, and realisation of God. Yoga is not a part of any religion, but all religions are part of Yoga, because Yoga is universal. Yoga is a religion in terms of relation between individual and cosmic self, that is God. It is not a religion in terms of today's understanding of the word religion. Yoga is a Universal principle which balances entire Universe, the space and the consciousness. There is only one religion, humanity. One should not change religion, but become a better Christian, a better Muslim.... a better human according to their religion. Helping hands are worth more than praying hands. We can help the world peace by limiting our needs, reduce the use of plastics, become vegetarians and avoid drugs, especially alcohol, which can be considered as a devil in the form of liquid. Peace begins within one's own heart and charity within one's own home.\n\"Yoga in Daily Life, the System\" is a holistic and comprehensive system concerning body, mind, consciousness and soul. The system can't be described only as a religion or only as exercise. Yogic exercises are so called psychosomatic movements which can be adapted to any individual. The exercises have very old origin coming from ancient yogic scriptures. The system was developed with doctors, therapists and psychologists and is designed as a complete system in the yoga tradition, including all the main yoga paths:\n* the path of the selfless way of acting (Karma Yoga)\n* the path of discipline and meditation (Raja Yoga)\n* the path of devotion (Bhakti Yoga)\n* the path of realisation and knowledge (Jnana Yoga)\n* purification techniques (Hatha Yoga)\nThe system was developed and organised into 8 levels by Swami Maheshwarananda. The goal of \"Yoga in Daily Life, the System\" is to create a program in which people can learn human responsibility towards the world and environment in which we are living; foster our compassion for all living beings; develop dormant hidden forces, and learn how to use them for the benefit of the world. The system can be lived and practised independently of age, social status, nationality and denomination. The system is an acknowledged diplomatic course in overseas (European) universities, and is taught in schools and hospitals for physical rehabilitation.\nSwamiji's books are published in 11 languages and thousands of non-profit centres of Yoga in Daily life are present in all five continents.\nOrganisation of work\nThe International Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram Fellowship is a non-profit and non-denominational organisation seated in Vienna/Austria, at Schikanedergasse 12/13 (A-1040 Vienna). It was founded in 1990 by Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda to unite, under one organisation, the various associations of \"Yoga in daily life\" that are scattered across the world. The fellowship has a member association in Roster Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC).\nIn 1990 Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda also laid the foundation stone of a project referred to as \"Om Ashram\" with the full name Om Vishwa Deep Gurukul, Swami Maheshwarananda Education & Research Center. The center is located on  in the Jadan district of Rajasthan in the form of ancient symbol OM. Once completed, it would be the largest man-made symbol of OM in the world. Since 2003, the Om Ashram is also the Mahasamadhi Shrine (tomb) of his guru Dharmasamrat Paramhans Swami Madhavananda.\nAnother his initiative is the Sri Swami Madhavananda World Peace Council which has been established as a non-governmental, humanitarian and charitable society. The feature event of the Sri Madhavananda World Peace Council is the \"World Peace Summit\" (WPS) which met for several years in different countries with the aim to discuss a special topic (religious dialogue, humanitarian projects,... ) to support world peace. The events brought together a large gathering of politicians, scientists and general public.\nLatest initiative by Swami Maheshwaranandaji \"Save the Birds\" would like to bring broader attention to the problem of birds live being endangered.\nHumanitarian projects\n* In 2002 the Shree Vishwa Deep Gurukul Prathmik Vidyalaya, Yoga in Daily Life's primary school in Rajasthan, India, was founded.\n* To address the major water crisis in the desert state of Rajasthan, India, the International Sri Deep Madhavananda Ashram Fellowship, has launched a Desert Rainwater Harvesting initiative.\n* Healthcare. The \"Sri Swami Madhavananda Hospital\" at Jadan Ashram in the Pali district of Rajasthan, India, serves as a naturopathic and allopathic hospital since there is no other professional hospital in the 30&nbsp;km area of the Ashram. This will provide residential health care to neighbouring districts.\nRecognitions and awards\n* Representative at the Millennium World Peace Conference of Religious and Spiritual Leaders at the UN-Headquarter, New York, 2000.\n* Award with the Danica Order, the highest decoration for humanitarian merits, by the President of the Republic Croatia, Stjepan Mesic, October 2002.\n* Bharat Gaurav, Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014.
