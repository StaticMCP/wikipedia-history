With the launch of Nickelodeon Canada in late 2009, Canada broadcast the awards live as it aired in the Eastern, Central, and Mountain time zones of the United States (it was tape-delayed for the Pacific Time Zone) and the awards was rebroadcast on YTV on April 2, 2010, at 7 p.m. ET. As a result, Canadian kids were able to vote on candidates for the first time. Nickelodeon's sister channels TeenNick and Nicktoons suspended regular programming during the 90-minute duration of the award show to allow viewers to see the awards.\nThe awards show featured the orange carpet, the celebrities, the fun, the slime, and the orange blimp awards (some featuring the new Nickelodeon logo that debuted on September 28, 2009). Votes were cast on Nickelodeon's websites on the 19 categories this year (including one new category) from February 25, 2010, to March 27, 2010, at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. ET. More than 91.1 million votes were cast by kids for the 2009 award show. For the 2010 awards, more than 115 million votes were cast. This was the last year the awards were held at Pauley Pavilion for some time, due to renovations that began in 2010 and continued until the fall of 2012.\nThe ''Non-Stop Kids' Choice Weekend, a two-day-long look at preparations for the 2010 KCAs and included an inside look at the new series Victorious, whose pilot aired as a \"sneak preview\" episode immediately after the awards telecast (two weeks before it began airing as a regular weekly series), ran during regular Nickelodeon daytime programming as wraparound segments hosted live by BrainSurge host Jeff Sutphen on March 26, 2010, with taped segments hosted by Big Time Rush stars Kendall Schmidt, James Maslow, Carlos Pena, Jr., and Logan Henderson aired on March 27, 2010. The Countdown to Kids' Choice! pre-show telecast was hosted by Sutphen and Lily Collins and aired live from 6 to 8 p.m. ET, also aired as wraparound segments during scheduled programming, and included Miranda Cosgrove performing her new single \"Kissin U\". True Jackson, VP cast members Ashley Argota and Matt Shively hosted a webcast portion of Countdown to Kids' Choice!'' at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. ET on Nick.com.\n13-year-old Megan Call of Guilford, Connecticut, was the winner of the \"All Access Sweepstakes with Justin Bieber\" contest from the 500,000 entries. Call met Bieber, attended his pre-show rehearsal, walked with him down the orange carpet and attended the awards show in Los Angeles.\nPresenters and performers, and stunts\nHost\n* Kevin James\nPresenters\nThe list of presenters and performers for the ceremony were announced on March 24, 2010.\n* Tyra Banks\n* Big Time Rush\n* John Cena\n* Jackie Chan\n* Lily Collins\n* Miranda Cosgrove\n* Rosario Dawson\n* Robert Downey Jr.\n* Lucas Cruikshank\n* Jonah Hill\n* Victoria Justice\n* Nathan Kress\n* George Lopez\n* Jennette McCurdy\n* Lea Michele\n* Cory Monteith\n* Keke Palmer\n* Dev Patel\n* Katy Perry\n* Chris Rock\n* Zoe Saldana\n* Jaden Smith\n* David Spade\n* Shaun White\nNote: In addition, promos aired prior to the telecast also announced that Queen Latifah was supposed to be a presenter at the awards, but she did not appear.

It featured Nickelodeon live-action stars alongside characters from the Nicktoon series The Penguins of Madagascar, Fanboy & Chum Chum and The Fairly OddParents split amongst three teams with each team performing a different style of dance.\nRobbie Amell from True Jackson, VP, Ariana Grande from Victorious, Gage Golightly from The Troop and The Penguins of Madagascar performed a Bollywood routine; Leon Thomas from Victorious, Nick Purcell from The Troop, Ashley Argota from True Jackson, VP and Poof and Foop of The Fairly OddParents performed a disco routine; and Matt Shively from True Jackson, VP, Noah Munck from iCarly and the title characters of Fanboy & Chum Chum performed a hip-hop routine.\nViewers could vote for the winner of the battle at Nick.com during the show. The hip-hop competitors, consisting of Munck, Shively and the title characters of Fanboy & Chum Chum, were voted winners of the battle.\nSlime stunts\nTwo slime stunts were featured in the 2010 awards: the first involved gold-medalist Olympic speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno  in a stunt in which he would be catapulted into slime by a \"slime slingshot\" in a \"slime world record\" attempt (the \"launch\" segment was actually pre-taped in advance of the show with Ohno's \"catapulting\" into the air digitally inserted); the second slime stunt involved actress Nicola Peltz, who co-stars in the then-upcoming feature film The Last Airbender making an attempt to bend slime (Peltz plays Katara, who has the ability to bend water.)\nMystery slimed celebrities\nThe Last Airbender co-star Jackson Rathbone, iCarly co-star Jerry Trainor, Katy Perry, online celebrity Fred Figglehorn (played by Lucas Cruikshank, who announced during commercial breaks the awards whose categories could not make it into the main show due to time constraints), Tina Fey, Steve Carell, and show host Kevin James were all slimed during the awards show.\nTrainor and Rathbone were slimed during the slimebending stunt by a slime geyser (the podium where presenters and winners appear featured a pool of slime in front of the podium, directly surrounding it, thus also allowing those in the audience directly in front of that area of the stage to be slimed as well when the slime geyser is activated), Perry was slimed while introducing the \"Favorite Movie Actress\" award in which Miley Cyrus won (Perry was slimed while opening a box thought to contain a card announcing the winner; the force of the slime sprayed from the box caused Perry to lose balance and fall on the stage briefly), and Fey and Carell were also slimed by a slime geyser from the slime area directly surrounding the podium (though they appeared onstage, Fey and Carell did not introduce or present an award); Cruikshank (as his persona from his YouTube video series) slimed himself during one of the commercial break segments.\nKCA host James, who was standing onstage with the children who handed out the awards to the winners appearing on the show, was slimed along with the children onstage near the end of the telecast after completing a running gag within the telecast in which James attempted to become a \"beyond awesome\" host by doing things to get in the audience's favor, with special guest Adam Sandler appearing on the videoscreens directly above the stage during the final sliming of the telecast.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
