Woodside was incorporated as a township by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 24, 1869, from portions of Belleville Township On April 5, 1871, almost two weeks after its second anniversary, the township was dissolved, and its territory was absorbed by Belleville and Newark.\nCockloft Hall\nIn the early 1800s Washington Irving, his oldest brother William, James Kirke Paulding a few friends formed a group known as the \"Lads of Kilkenny\", described as “a loosely knit pack of literary-minded young blades out for a good time.” When they weren't spending time at the Park Theatre or the Shakespeare Tavern at the corner of Nassau and Fulton Streets in Lower Manhattan, they gathered at an old family mansion on the Passaic River in Woodside which Gouverneur Kemble had inherited and which they called \"Cockloft Hall\". For a short time they produced Salmagundi, a periodical.\nRail stations\nWoodside Station, near the intersection of Grafton Avenue & Oraton Street, was a stop on the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad Newark Branch. There was a small railroad green, snack bar & ticket station next to the tracks. Passenger service was discontinued in 1966, although freight service, operated by Norfolk Southern Railroad as the Newark Industrial Track, remained active for a time and served several local industries.\nThe North Newark station, with service provided by the Erie Railroad's New York and Greenwood Lake Railway and later by NJ Transit's Boonton Line was located on Broadway. The right of way is a planned state park, the Essex–Hudson Greenway.\nHousing project\nThe Archbishop Walsh Homes, named for Thomas Joseph Walsh, the first Roman Catholic Archbishop of Newark holding the position from 1937 until his death in 1952, when the project was built.
