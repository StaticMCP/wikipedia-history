The letter referred to the freezing of assets from earlier that month. The Reuters report cited financial advisers of Lai, as well as statements by Lai dating back to May 2020, as saying that his assets were spread across Asia, Canada and the United States; one advisor gave as reason that they were certain that the Hong Kong government wanted to \"choke\" the Apple Daily. One adviser said that, while the off-shore assets would fall under jurisdictions in their respective countries and thus be secure notwithstanding the fact that the accounts were set up in Hong Kong, the action against Lai's assets could hurt the financial industry in the city and lead other investors to channel their investments elsewhere, with Singapore being a favourite destination. Lee had said a week earlier that the move was not taking aim at media work but related to national security. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the action would hopefully strengthen the status of the city as a financial hub, through ensuring that \"no-one can use our financial system to carry out acts endangering national security\". HSBC declined to comment on the incident, and Citibank stated that it must abide by all local laws.\nHKUST girl convicted for unlawful assembly and sentenced to 10 weeks in prison\nOn Halloween on 31 October 2019, some citizens launched the 'Hello, Nine Officials Mask Night'.

She pointed out that although the defendants advocated a 'peaceful' demonstration, they believed that it was a period of violence and described them. It is \"naive and unrealistic\", which means that imprisonment is the only suitable sentence option. This case cannot be compared with the 8.18 and 8.31 assembly cases sentenced earlier, because the Hong Kong environment on 1 October was more violent. Considering that Figo Chan, Lee Cheuk-yan, Leung Kwok-hung, and Albert Ho were involved in inciting others to participate in the demonstration, and the guilt was heavier than the other defendants, so a higher starting point of sentencing was adopted. The following activists were sentenced are:\n* Jimmy Lai, Yeung Sum, Cyd Ho, and Sin Chung-kai pleaded guilty to 1 count of organizing unlawful assembly; Lai was sentenced to 14 months in prison, and together with his other two illegal demonstrations, a total of 20 months in prison; Yeung was sentenced to 14 months in prison; Ho was sentenced to 14 months in prison.

Their legal team is actively considering appeals against the commutation. Leung Kwok-hung's wife, Chan Po-ying, also believes that the sentence is very heavy. She pointed out that in the past, most of them were only fined, but now participating in demonstrations and assemblies not approved by the police will face years of imprisonment, worrying about the 'chilling effect' of future assemblies. In addition, Figo Chan said through social media that the Civil Human Rights Front would not be dissolved.

In the future, there will be heavy sentences for peaceful assemblies.\n14-year-old girl sentenced for unlawful assembly\nA 14-year-old girl participated in an unlawful assembly with other unknown persons in the public area of Prince Edward Road West and Water Canal, Nathan Road, Mong Kok from 24 to 25 September 2019. She was charged with the crime of unlawful assembly. After trial, he was found guilty and sentenced by Magistrate Creamy Chan to probation for 24 months in the West Kowloon Magistrates' Court. Chan emphasized that the defendant's situation in this case was special. The probation was not because the defendant was young, but because the defendant's father died 2 months before the incident, and the defendant suffered from depression. The magistrate understands that young people with mental problems may aggravate their condition if they are sentenced to detention, and therefore follow the recommendations to impose a probation order.\n21-year-old student sentenced to 4 years and 3 months in prison for rioting at Reclaim Tuen Mun Park rally\nA 21-year-old male student named Lee Ho-ming, participated in the riot outside Tuen Mun Times Square during the Reclaim Tuen Mun Park rally on 21 September 2019, along with other unidentified persons, and possessed a trekking pole in the same place on the same day.

This shows that the scale of the demonstrations was huge. The defendant stood at the forefront of the demonstrators, holding a shield and a trekking pole in front of the police. The end of the trekking pole was a metal pointed tip without a rubber plug, which was lethal. The judge believed that Lee \"has a shield in one hand and a staff in the other, as if he is on guard and fighting at any time.\" Lee stands on the front line, plays an active role, undermines social peace, and ignores laws and regulations. He must be sentenced to deterrent punishment, and immediate imprisonment is the only option.\n20-year-old boy convicted of damaging the gate of Wan Chai MTR station with swelling glue\nOn 15 September 2019, a 20-year-old man sprayed an expanding agent on the iron gate at Lockhart Road MTR Wan Chai station Exit A1.

The iron gates involved were sprayed with expansion agent, making it difficult for the staff to open the gates and affecting citizens' access. The defendant and another person had a plan to ignite the fire. If the place really caught fire, it would hinder the escape of citizens and MTR staff, and even affect the property and personal safety of nearby people. Considering that it did not cause a major impact, it was deemed that short-term imprisonment was not applicable to this case, and the defendant was finally sentenced to a rehabilitation center in accordance with the report's recommendations.\n29 May\nSecurity Bureau warns against participation in Tiananmen vigil\nThe Security Bureau warned Hongkongers that participation in either the vigil in memory of Tiananmen massacre on 4 June, which had been banned ostensively due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, or in a commemorative long-distance run on 30 May, would be liable to up to five years in prison.
