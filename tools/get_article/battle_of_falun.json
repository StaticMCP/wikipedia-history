      "text": "# Battle of Falun\n\nThe Battle of Falun () was the first battle of the Swedish War of Liberation that took place in Falun, Sweden, on February 5, 1521. Swedish rebels under Gustav Vasa, who had just days earlier been proclaimed leader of the Dalecarlians against the Danes, raided Falun. The rebels, consisting of a few hundred poorly armed peasants and some noble officers, took the Danish forces in the town completely by surprise. The local  (bailiff) Kristoffer Olsson and a few others labelled as \"traitors\" were captured. Local shops run by German merchants were plundered, and the population taxed.\nThe rebels continued onwards through the region, gaining many new recruits. Shortly after they returned to Falun, and the locals pledged allegiance to Gustav Vasa and his cause. The rebellion continued until the Treaty of Malmö in 1524. A year earlier, in 1523, Vasa was crowned King of Sweden.\nReferences\n*\n*"
