The county was formed in 1890 and named Kingfisher by a vote of residents.\nThe land was given to the Creek Nation by the federal government, but was taken back after the American Civil War.\nHistory\nLimited archaeological surveys may have discovered evidence of pre-contact peoples, including Paleo-Indian and Archaic (6000 BC - 1 AD) groups that used the area for hunting and foraging. The historic Osage, Cheyenne, and Comanche tribes traversed the prairie grasslands of this area.\nBefore the county's creation, The Chisholm Trail's many routes crossed the area. A stage road which paralleled the trail had important stops at Dover Station, King Fisher Station and Baker Station.\nThe area was given to the Creek Nation by the federal government after their forced removal from Georgia. At the end of the American Civil War, the Creeks were forced to cede the land back to the federal government for siding with the Confederacy. It became part of the Unassigned Lands, and the area was opened to non-Indian settlement in the land run on April 22, 1889. Several towns, including Kingfisher, Oklahoma developed soon after the land run.\nOriginally this area was called County 5, when the Organic Act of May 2, 1890, created Oklahoma Territory. At an August 5, 1890, election, the voters of County 5 overwhelmingly voted for the name \"Kingfisher\" over \"Hennessey\" and \"Harrison\". The origin of the name is unclear. The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture mentions three different possibilities. The first is that the name memorialized a local rancher, David King Fisher. The second version is that King and Fisher were two different settlers, whose names were combined for the county and town. The third explanation was that the name was for a rancher named John Fisher and for whom Uncle Johns Creek was named.\nIn November 2022, the county gained national attention when four Chinese nationals were murdered, execution-style, at a Chinese-run marijuana farm at the crossroads hamlet of Lacey, near Hennessey. Prior to that, the farm had drawn some attention to itself by having armed guards visible at its perimeters, who hasselled anyone stopping nearby, including postal delivery personnel.\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (0.9%) is water. The principal waterway is the Cimarron River, which runs from northwest to east through the county.\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census1790-1960 1900-19901990-2000 2010\n}}\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 13,926 people, 5,247 households, and 3,893 families residing in the county.
