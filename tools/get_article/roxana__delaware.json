It is roughly centered on the intersection of Delaware Route 20 and Delaware Route 17. It is part of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nHistory\n}}\nRoxana was originally named the \"Village of Centreville\" and underwent a name change to Roxana that was passed by the Delaware General Assembly on April 2, 1869. An act to incorporate the \"town of Roxana\" was brought before the Delaware Senate on February 16, 1909, by Senator Drexler and passed on February 25, 1909. The bill to incorporate Roxana was then passed by the Delaware House of Representatives on March 12, 1909.\nOn February 16, 1921, Representative E.J. Turner presented a bill to the Delaware House of Representatives revoking the charter of the town of Roxana, which was passed. The same bill was passed by the Delaware Senate on February 28, 1921, bringing an end to Roxana's 12-year municipal status as a town.\nPublic safety\nRoxana is served by the Roxana Fire Company Station 90, which provides fire protection to the community along with nearby areas in southeastern Sussex County. The Roxana Fire Company was founded in 1960. Lacking municipal or county police forces, these services are provided by the Delaware State Police.\nSports\nRoxana is home to the Little League Baseball Senior League Softball World Series, held every year at the Lower Sussex Little League Complex north of the community.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
