His father was a Swiss watchmaker who had settled in London. His father died in 1901 and Guye emigrated to Australia at the beginning of the 20th century. He enlisted in the AIF on 2 September 1914, and was sent to Europe in October. He returned to Australia in 1916.\nIn 1940, Guye was elected as Country Party representative for the Electoral district of Polwarth in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. In March 1949, Guye was one of six Country MPs to defect to the Liberal and Country Party established by Thomas Hollway as the Victorian division of the Liberal Party. In December 1949, he became Minister of Transport and a Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works.\nGuye's brother Denis Guye, who remained in England, was an Olympic rower.\nReferences"
