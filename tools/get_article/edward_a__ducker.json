Ducker was \"without the advantages of an early education\", but \"applied himself and finally took up the study of law\". He passed the bar examination in 1902 and entered the practice of law in Winnemucca, Nevada. He was elected district attorney of Humboldt County, Nevada, in 1904. He remained in that position until his election to a seat on the Nevada Sixth Judicial District in 1910, which he won handily, receiving more votes than his other two opponents combined.\nJudicial service\nAs a district court judge, Ducker \"decided many of the most important mining suits that have clustered the courts of Nevada for years\", and in 1914 \"was prominently mentioned as a candidate for the supreme court of Nevada\", though he ultimately chose not to run at that time, instead running unopposed for reelection to his district court seat.\nIn 1918, Ducker ran for a seat on the Nevada supreme court, waging \"an energetic campaign... throughout the state\", and defeating incumbent Pat McCarran by a vote of  12,101 to 11,566 to win the election. Ducker subsequently ran unopposed in 1924, 1930, 1936, and 1942, remaining on the supreme court until his death in 1946. He served several stints as Chief Justice of the court.\nPersonal life and death\nOn March 10, 1903, Ducker married Dollie B. Guthrie of Humboldt County, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Ducker was an avid hunter and fisherman, and \"spent much time horseback riding\".\nDucker died at his home in Carson City, Nevada, from cardiovascular disease, at the age of 76.\nReferences"
