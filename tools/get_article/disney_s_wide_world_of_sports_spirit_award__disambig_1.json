Tyler celebrated with the team on the field and in the locker room after the win. Tyler's story has generated thousands of donations for cancer research and created an [https://giving.purdue.edu/s/1461/campaign/start.aspx?sid=1461&gid=1010&pgid=9633 endowment with the Purdue Cancer Center].

Tre struggled to deal with one family tragedy after another, as well as four season-ending injuries at Pitt. That eventually led to multiple suicide attempts and turned a traditional four-year college football experience for him into what is now his seventh year.\nBut instead of letting his misfortune bring him down, he’s using his circumstances to help others. Tre eventually committed to seeking the help that he needed for his mental health as well as his physical health. And he’s helping to rescue others fighting similar demons with L.O.V.E. — Living Out Victoriously Everyday, a nonprofit organization he launched with a classmate aimed at providing mental health support for fellow students on campus and beyond. Tre also does motivational speaking about mental health around campus, at his old high school and the surrounding community.\n|-\n| 2022 || Tylee Craft, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n|-\n| colspan=3 | Craft embodies the essence of the award after being diagnosed with stage 4 large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, a rare form of lung cancer, on March 14, 2022. According to his family, doctors said he was just weeks away from dying when they realized he was sick and took him to the hospital. Doctors at UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center immediately started Craft on an aggressive regimen of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\n“It felt good to be recognized and be surrounded by my teammates and coaches,” said Craft after practice recently when he learned that he had won the award. “That bond that we share on and off the field gets me through my days.”\nThe UNC community quickly rallied around Craft. Teammates frequently visited him in the hospital, and, on April 9, the Tar Heels dedicated their annual spring football game to Craft, renaming the event the #TyleeStrong Spring Game. Craft died from the cancer on October 12, 2024, at the age of 23.\n|-\n| 2023 || Brian Dooley, Eastern Michigan University\n|-\n| colspan=3 | Dooley showed the character and strength of spirit that makes him one of the country’s best teammates when he donated his football scholarship to another Eastern Michigan player, Zack Conti, before the season. Conti, who initially had to try out for the team, had been working multiple jobs and donating blood plasma for money to pay for college while his mother fights polycystic kidney disease, which typically requires transplant surgery.\nDooley, whose mother is a nurse and father is a truck driver, is a graduate student in his final season at Eastern Michigan. He’s been a team captain for several years and played a leading role in helping the team make it to a bowl game this season. After giving away his scholarship, he is now paying for college with his own savings along with a loan his mother took out to help cover tuition and expenses.\n“I think it’s just the beginning. If people see what I’ve done they might take it to a whole new level,” said Dooley. “I wish I could do more. To me it wasn’t that big of a deal what I did. I was just doing it for one of my brothers. So, hopefully I can do a lot more now.”\n|-\n| 2024 || Megan Twist and Richard Bremer, Georgia Bulldogs fans\n|-\n| colspan=3 | After being a life-long Florida Gators fan, Richard Bremer developed his intense love for the Georgia Bulldogs from a most unusual source – the compassionate spirit of a young University of Georgia fan and her lifesaving lung donation. Bremer's life was saved by Twist's decision to become an organ donor, and that led to Bremer relinquishing his long-time devotion to the Gators in favor of the rival Bulldogs as well as inspiring donations that are saving the lives of so many others.\nIn 1996, Bremer, a carpenter from Jacksonville, Fla., was diagnosed with a degenerative lung disease called sarcoidosis. By 2012, his lung function had plummeted to just 20 percent, necessitating a lung transplant. After four years of waiting, he received a life-changing phone call that a match had been found. The donor was Twist, a 23-year-old from Georgia who was tragically killed in a car accident. Remarkably, Twist registered as an organ and tissue donor just a few months prior on her 23rd birthday. The surgery to save Bremer's life lasted 10 hours, and he was placed in a medically induced coma for several weeks. Upon waking and learning of Twist's loyalty to the Georgia Bulldogs, Bremer felt compelled to shift his own football loyalty to the Bulldogs in honor of her.\nSince the surgery, Bremer and Twist's family have been dedicated to raising awareness for organ donation. He has served as a spokesperson for LifeLink Foundation, a non-profit with a mission to help as many people as possible through organ and tissue transplantation. Bremer keeps a photo of Twist on his phone, which appears six times a day whenever his alarm goes off, reminding him to take his medications.\n\"I celebrate (Twist's organ donation) every day when I wake up,\" said Bremer. \"Getting to breathe every day, having her as a part of my life. She's with me every day. Getting to bring her to Walt Disney World with me and receive the Spirit Award, I'm carrying her spirit with me.\"\n|}\nReferences"
