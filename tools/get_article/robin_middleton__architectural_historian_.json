Middleton (born 1931) is a British architectural historian, described as a leading authority on 18th-century French architecture and architectural theory by the University of Cambridge where he studied and worked. He is Professor Emeritus of Columbia University and was editor of Architectural Design and also head of general studies at the Architectural Association in London before he moved to New York City in 1987, where he still resides.\nEarly life and education\nMiddleton was born in South Africa but moved to England in the 1950s. He trained as an architect at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg and was a doctoral student under Nikolaus Pevsner at Cambridge University. He was awarded a PhD in 1958 with a thesis on the French architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc and the rational gothic tradition.\nHis contributed to the rediscovery of a sustained interest in the structural finesse of Gothic architecture in 17th-century France, prompting a concern for the expression of structure in architecture, which, transposed into classical terms, took the form of the introduction of free standing columns in church architecture. The prime promoter of this practice was the Abbé Jean-Louis de Cordemoy, virtually unknown, the subject of two articles by Middleton in the Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes in 1962 and 1963. The notion served as a preamble, as it were, to Viollet-le-Duc’s explorations of structural expression as the basis of good architecture in the 19th century.\nCareer\nMiddleton was technical editor of Architectural Design from 1964 to 1972 and introduced a section Cosmorama that replaced the News section in July 1965. It was ‘a commentary on buildings or on events throughout the world that impinge upon architecture’ and was printed on non-glossy rough paper, embracing topics such as new materials, ecology, disposability and electronic technology.\nMiddleton was head of general studies at the Architectural Association, London, and librarian and lecturer in the Department of History of Art at Cambridge University from 1972 to 1987. He joined the Department of Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University in 1987.\nMiddleton appeared in the TV series Art of the Western World in 1990 in two episodes exploring the Neo-Classical revival in 18th century France and England.\nA festschrift in his honour, entitled Fragments: Architecture and the Unfinished: Essays Presented to Robin Middleton, was published in 2006 upon his retirement.\nArchival holdings\nA 1969 photographic portrait of Middleton taken by Monica Pidgeon is held by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and papers of Robin Middleton are held in the archive of Columbia University Libraries. 35mm slides from Middleton's collection of original architectural photographs and research images were digitized by the Media Center for Art History at Columbia University. Photographs attributed to Middleton are held in the Conway Library at The Courtauld Institute of Art, London, whose archive, of primarily architectural images, is in the process of being digitised under the wider Courtauld Connects project.\nPersonal life\nWhile at university in South Africa, Middleton met Denise Scott Brown (née Lakofski) and her first husband Robert Scott Brown and they became firm friends, sharing the same interests. In 1956, she and her husband embarked on a six month trip to Italy on a route devised by Middleton to explore mannerist art and architecture. Middleton would later live with Scott Brown’s sister, the artist and architect, Ruth Lakofski (1933–2009), in East Village, New York for \"many, many years\".\nSelected publications\n*\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/750811 The Abbé de Cordemoy and the Graeco-Gothic Ideal: A Prelude to Romantic Classicism]\", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 25 no. 3/4, Jul.-Dec. 1962.\n*\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/750571 The Abbe de Cordemoy and the Graeco-Gothic Ideal]\", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 26 no. 1/2, Jan.-June, 1963.\n*Neoclassical and nineteenth century architecture, R.
