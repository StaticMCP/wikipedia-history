The award was established by the Liverpool-based music blog Getintothis in response to the revitalisation of the city's music scene following Liverpool's designation as European Capital of Culture in 2008.\nThe award was described as a \"Scouse Mercury Prize\" by Getintothis editor Peter Guy ahead of its official launch in November 2011. This comparison was widely used throughout the award's existence, including in national media outlets such as BBC, The Guardian, and NME.\nThe award was held annually for six editions; however, no ceremony took place in 2018 or in subsequent years. While no official termination has been announced, Getintothis editor Peter Guy attributed the award's absence to declining arts funding, financial struggles for independent venues and festivals, and broader challenges within Liverpool's creative sector.\nWinners and shortlisted nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! !!
