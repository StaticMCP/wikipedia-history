Unlike the band's first album, their sophomore record is written as a concept album, revolving around a series of documents produced by the United States’ Office of Legal Council between 2002 and 2005. The text in the lyrics is taken directly from these documents. The album was released to iTunes and CD Baby on December 1, 2009. The album in its entirety was first performed live at the Tranzac Club in Toronto, Ontario on June 6, 2009, and the video footage of the performance was released to the band's official YouTube channel. Additionally, a music video for the song 'Good Faith' was released. The video is a stop-motion animation film, and was shot by Benjamin Mueller-Heaslip.\nTrack listing\n| title1          = You Have Asked Us To Address\n| writer1         =\n| extra1          =\n| length1         = 2:40\n| title2          = The Interrogators Remove The Hood\n| writer2         =\n| extra2          =\n| length2         = 2:40\n| title3          = This Sensation Is Based Upon A Deeply Rooted Physiological Response\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          =\n| length3         = 3:50\n| title4          = The Ultimate Question Is\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          =\n| length4         = 1:55\n| title5          = Technique\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          =\n| length5         = 3:11\n| title6          = Medical Personnel Are On The Scene\n| writer6         =\n| extra6          =\n| length6         =  2:34\n| title7          = Drawing Distinctions Between Gradations Of Pain Is Not An Easy Task\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          =\n| length7         = 2:29\n| title8          = Good Faith\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          =\n| length8         = 3:50\n| title9          = Self Defense\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          =\n| length9         = 2:38\n| title10          = Authority\n| writer10         =\n| extra10          =\n| length10         = 2:12\n| title11          = Please Let Us Know If We May Be Of Further Assistance\n| writer11         =\n| extra11          =\n| length11         = 3:46\n}}\nReferences"
