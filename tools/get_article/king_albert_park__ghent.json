The park is located in the southeast of the city center, between Woodrow Wilson Square and the B401 motorway exits that terminate at Zuidpark in the city. It is a neo-baroque park, where the other parks in the city are mostly laid out in English landscape style.\nAfter the demolition of the Gent-Zuid train station in 1928, which was replaced by the Gent-Sint-Pieters railway station, a large elongated space became available. In the 1930s, the Zuidpark was built on these former railway sites. After the death of King Albert I in 1934, it was officially called King Albert Park.\nA bust of Leopold II of Belgium stood in the park for many years. It was removed in 2020, as a result of the George Floyd protests in Belgium.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
