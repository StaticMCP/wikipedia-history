      "text": "# Republican News\n\nRepublican News was a longstanding newspaper/magazine published by Sinn Féin. Following the split in physical force Irish republicanism in the late 1960s between the Officials (Official Sinn Féin &mdash; also known as Sinn Féin Gardiner Place &mdash; and the Official IRA) and the Provisionals (Provisional Sinn Féin &mdash; also known as Sinn Féin Kevin Street and now most commonly simply as Sinn Féin &mdash; and the Provisional IRA) Republican News was eclipsed by An Phoblacht, a new magazine launched by Provisional Sinn Féin in 1970. \"An Phoblacht\" came first and then in early 1970, Joe Graham and  Proinsias Mac Airt put together the Republican News and it functioned  independently for quite a while. Graham worked on only three issues of it before starting The Vindicator. The magazines merged under the name An Phoblacht/Republican News in 1979.\nEditors\n:1970: Jimmy Steele\n:1970: Proinsias Mac Airt\n:1973: Leo Martin\n:1974: Sean Caughey\n:1975: Danny Morrison\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://republicanarchive.com/2024/09/15/republican-news/ Archived issues] at the Irish Republican Digital Archive"
