She was Goryeo's first Grand Consort () even though King Taejo's daughter, Queen Dowager Sunan, was already Queen Dowager.\nBiography\nShe was born in 960 in Seonju (now Seonsan-eup, Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province) as the daughter of Kim Won-sung and Lady Wang.\nAfter her marriage with King Seongjong, she was formally called as Princess Yeonheung () while living in \"Yeonheung Palace\" () and Princess Hyeondeok () since she lived in \"Hyeondeok Palace\" ().\nShe was said to have raised and taken care of her husband's two nephews (Wang Song and Wang Sun) as their parents died young.\nDuring King Hyeonjong's reign, she was denied the title of queen dowager and instead became Grand Consort in 1029 with the equivalent authority of a queen dowager. Various government positions, lands and honours were granted to her relatives.\nAs her death date was unknown and became grand consort in 1029, it was presumed that she might have died after that. Her funeral procedure became a predicament for Queen Wonmok and Consort Wonsun since King Munjong discussed what to do with Wonmok's rite as he prepared a plan based on the example of the Seonsan Kim clan.\nHer official residence, Hyeondeok Palace was then inherited by her only daughter with Seongjong, Queen Wonjeong, and was used as one of the Goryeo royal palaces by King Chungsuk later when he reigned.\nFamily\n* Father - Kim Won-sung (; 935–?)\n** Grandfather - Kim Gwang-ui (상서좌복야 상주국 회의국개국백 김광의; 金光義; 915–?)\n** Grandmother - Grand Princess Hwaui of the Kim clan (화의군대부인 김씨; 和義君大夫人 金氏; 915–?)\n* Mother - Grand Princess Hwaui of the Kaeseong Wang clan (; 935–?)\n* Spouse\n** Wang Ch'i, Seongjong of Goryeo (고려 성종; 15 January 961 – 8 November 997)\n*** Mother-in-law - Queen Seonui of the Chungju Yu clan (선의왕후 유씨; 937–?)\n*** Fathet-in-law - Daejong of Goryeo (고려 대종; 937–969)\n* Issue\n** Daughter - Queen Wonjeong of the Kim clan (원정왕후 김씨; 994–1018)\n*** Son-in-law - Wang Sun, Hyeonjong of Goryeo (고려 현종; 992–1032)\nIn popular culture\n*Portrayed by Moon Jeong-hee and Kim Min-ji in the 2009 KBS2 TV series Empress Cheonchu.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0019783 Queen Munhwa] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture .\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013000841981 문화왕후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
