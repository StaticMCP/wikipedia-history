It was the first large offensive victory for the Finns in the Winter War.\nThe battle took place on the territory of so-called Ladoga Karelia () which today is part of the Republic of Karelia in Russia.\nBackground\nOn 2 December, the Red Army captured Suojärvi, threatening the railroad to the Karelian Isthmus and the rear of the Mannerheim Line. On 6 December, the IV Army Corps was reorganized by Mannerheim into a Group commanded by Paavo Talvela. Aaro Pajari was immediately ordered by Talvela to defend the western shore of Lake Tolvajärvi, while Per Ole Ekholm was ordered to continue the defense of Ilomantsi. On 10 December, Talvela issued counteroffensive orders to both Pajari and Ekholm for the next day.\nOn 11 December, Talvela reorganized the planned attack over frozen lakes Hirvasjärvi and Tolvajärvi, following the Battle of Varolampi Pond on the night of 10–11 December. On 12 December, a reinforced battalion under J.A. Malkamäki, would attack of northern Lake Hirvasjärvi and the rear of northeast Kotisaari Island. Pajari would then advance from the western shore of Lake Tolvajäri across Hevossalmi Strait.\nComposition\n* Finnish side (4,000):\n** Talvela Group of the 4th Corps (16th Infantry Regiment)\n** Räsänen detachment (4 separate battalions and one artillery battalion of the 6th Artillery Regiment)\nThe Finnish side consisted of 7 infantry battalions and 30 pieces of artillery.\nThe Finnish 16th Infantry Regiment was composed of workers out of Tampere city and headed by the chief of police of Tampere.\n* Soviet side (20,000):\n** 139th Rifle Division of the 8th Army (718th, 609th, 364th Rifle regiments)\nThe Soviet side consisted of 9 infantry battalions, 60 artillery pieces, one scout battalion, one signal battalion, one sapper battalion, 30 tanks, and 376 planes.\nBattle\nMalkamäki's attack was delayed until daylight when it encountered two battalions of the Soviet 718th Regiment preparing to make their own attack on the Finnish flank. The opposing attacks cancelled each other. The Finnish Third Company retreated back to the Tolvajärvi-Kokkari road, while the Second Company crossed the lake and turned south before stalling near the Hirvasvaara ridge. By noon, Malkamäki ordered a retreat around the northern end of the lake. However, parts of the Second Company remained in the Hirvasaara area in support of Pajari's flank. Simultaneously, the Finnish First and Second Companies of ErP 112 attacked the southern end of Kotisaari Island, but were forced to retreat to the south by early afternoon.\nPajari's attack across the Tolvajärvi peninsula was also delayed until 9:15, meeting resistance 200 yards west of the tourist hotel. Three Soviet tanks were disabled, and Pajari committed his reserves in an attack on the hill containing the hotel, and Hirvasharju. Becoming demoralized by the renewed attacks, the Soviets began to retreat. ErP 112 renewed its attack on Kotisaari Island and threatened the Soviet supply road at Kivisalmi. The Soviet commander Belyaev then ordered the withdrawal of his 139th Division as far as Ristisalmi.\nOn 14 December, the Finns renewed their counteroffensive, now encountering the Soviet 75th Division, reserves sent in to replace the 139th. Yet, by the end of the day the Finnish troops had secured the Ristisalmi Strait and the Soviets continued their retreat towards Metsänvaara. On 17 Talvela committed all of his reserves to Pajari. On 18 December, the battle had reached Ägläjärvi, which fell on 22 December. On 23 December, the Finnish troops reached the Aittojoki River.\nAftermath\nMannerheim called a halt to the advance along the Aittojoki River, and ordered defensive positions prepared. The Red Army's losses along the Tolvajärvi-Aittojoki road included 4000 dead, 580 prisoners, 59 tanks, and 220 machine guns. Yet, by this time the Finnish losses were also accumulating, especially after the frontal attacks at Tolvajärvi and Ägläjärvi. According to Allen Chew, for the Finns, \"Proportionally, these were the heaviest losses of the entire war,\" with 630 killed and 1320 wounded. Yet despite the Finnish losses associated with their first offensive victory, according to Chew, \"It would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of the Finnish victory,\" eliminating the threat to Ladoga-Karelia, and ensuring national survival with a sense of optimism.  The arrival of Talvela and Pajari, according to Erik Heinrichs, \"...overturned the depressed mood and fatigue...a fascinating example of what, in a war, can be accomplished by strong will power and strong mind.\" During the battle, Talvela was promoted to Major General and Pajari to full Colonel.\nGeneral Belyaev was dismissed from commanding on 16 December 1939, but preserved his rank. In June 1940 after re-attestation he was granted the rank of major general.\nGallery\nFile:Pajari tolvajarven esikunnan edessa.jpg|Aaro Pajari in Tolvajärvi\nFile:Talvisota Tolvajarvi 1.PNG| Two burning Soviet T-26s\nFile:Tolvajärven taistelijoita.jpg|Finnish skiers of the Talvela Group\nFile:Neuvostopanssariauto.jpg|Destroyed Soviet armoured car is inspected by Finnish officers.\nNotes\nSee also\n* List of Finnish military equipment of World War II\n* List of Soviet Union military equipment of World War II\nReferences\nSources\nEnglish\n*\nExternal links\n*  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s13xV-rTE80 How did the USSR lose a battle to Finland because of a sausage? – Politics and Weapons (Как СССР проиграл битву Финляндии из-за колбасы? - Политика и Оружие)].
