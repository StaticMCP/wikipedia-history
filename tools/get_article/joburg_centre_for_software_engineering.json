The JCSE was established in 2005 as a partnership between academia, government, and industry to promote skills development, research, innovation, and best practices in software engineering, software development, and related ICT fields. This partnership between three major sectors, the City of Johannesburg, the University of the Witwatersrand and ICT and financial services was supposed to lead to a growing infrastructure base, better governance and investments in Gauteng.\nThe JCSE initiated a digital innovation hub known as Wits University’s Tshimologong Digital Innovation Precinct. This precinct was launched in 2016, with the intention of reaching greater heights of industrialisation.\nA year later, the 2017 Tshimologong Precinct was spun off by Adam Habib as The Wits Incubator (Pty) Ltd\ncompany (Tshimologong)\nAlthough innovative, the precinct has not addressed poor policy, under regulation and mis-governance.Today, instead of a smart city, Joburg faces multiple basic infrustructure problems that President Ramaphosa demanded that they quickly address. before the G20 Summit takes place in Johannesburg in November 2025.\nSoftware solutions are not a quick fix for hijacked buildings, the lack of affordable housing, an unreliable water supply system, potholes or blocked sewers. Barry Dwalatky who launched the JCSE, would be disappointed.\nReferences"
