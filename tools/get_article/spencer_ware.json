He was released on August 20, 2014.\nKansas City Chiefs (first stint)\nOn December 31, 2014, Ware signed a future contract with the Kansas City Chiefs.\nOn September 5, 2015, he was waived by the Chiefs and was re-signed to the practice squad. Ware was activated off the practice squad for the Week 8 matchup against the Detroit Lions for the NFL game in London on November 1, 2015. In this game, Ware scored his first NFL touchdown, a four-yard run, in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter against the Detroit Lions. In Week 11, against the San Diego Chargers, he had two rushing touchdowns in the 33–3 victory. In the next game against the Buffalo Bills, he had 19 carries for 114 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown during the 30–22 victory. Ware ended the 2015 season playing in 11 games with two starts, rushing for 403 yards and six touchdowns. He scored a rushing touchdown in the Chiefs' Wild Card Round victory over the Houston Texans.\nIn 2016, with starter Jamaal Charles coming off a knee injury suffered in 2015, Ware became the starter for 2016. In Week 1, against the San Diego Chargers, he had 199 scrimmage yards (70 rushing, 129 receiving) and a rushing touchdown in the 33–27 victory. In Week 6, against the Oakland Raiders, he had 24 carries for 131 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 26–10 victory. He started 14 games, rushing for 921 yards and three touchdowns. In addition, he caught 33 passes for 447 yards and two touchdowns.\nComing into the 2017 season, Ware was projected to be the Chiefs' starting running back after the release of longtime starter Jamaal Charles. In the team's third preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks, Ware suffered a torn PCL and additional knee damage. He was placed on injured reserve on September 2, 2017.\nOn November 30, 2018, Ware was named starting running back for the Kansas City Chiefs following the release of starting running back Kareem Hunt after he misled the team regarding an assault alleged to have occurred earlier that year. In his first game as the new starter, Ware achieved 47 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown against the Oakland Raiders. He had 129 scrimmage yards in the 27–24 victory over the Baltimore Ravens in Week 14.
