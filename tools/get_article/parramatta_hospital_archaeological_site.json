Two pavilions were established to house exhibits and interpretation panels, and other aspects of the site were capped with a protective slab. The project won an Architects Australia Award for heritage work in 2008.\nHeritage listing\nThe Parramatta Hospital Archaeological Site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.
