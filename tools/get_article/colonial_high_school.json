It was originally built to serve grades 7–12, but in 1988 Colonial High began serving grades 9–12.\nIn 1990 University High School was built as a relief school, which later formed a rivalry with Colonial.\nThe main campus underwent total reconstruction in 2000, at a cost of $49 million with completion in 2004.\nIn 2009 Colonial celebrated its 50th anniversary, with the class of 2009 becoming its 50th graduating class.\nDuring 2014 the school was ranked 90 out of 100 in the nation for its enrollment size, but as of 2016 its ranking has fallen to 114.\nIn the summer 2018 Colonial began reconstruction of its performing arts center with completion for the 2019–2020 school year.\nNinth grade center\nAfter the transition from junior high schools to middle school in 1988, Colonial High School was assigned an added grade to serve. In response to the new enrollment size, a separate ninth grade center was built as a relief campus in what is now known as Waterford Elementary School. In the early 1990s, the 9th grade campus was moved closer to the original main campus, now located at 7775 Valencia College Lane, approximately three miles from the main campus.\nIn 2005 the ninth grade center underwent total reconstruction, with completion in 2006.\nAthletics\nThe school's athletic teams are known as the Grenadiers. They have won numerous Metro Championships over their more than 50-year history.\nIn November 2011, Head Coach Rene Plasencia and Assistant Coach Casey Calhoun led the boys' cross country team to a sweep of team titles culminating with the first State title of any sport in Colonial High School history. The team was led by junior standout Andres Arroyo who also won the individual title of 4A state champion.\nEach year, Colonial High School and its rival, University High School, vie for possession of a stylized leather boot, the eponymous symbol of the much-hyped annual football game known as \"The Boot Game\". The winning school displays the boot in a trophy case until the following year, when the next Boot Game is played.\nNotable alumni\n* Casey Anthony (2004), mother of Caylee Anthony and media sensation\n* Andrés Arroyo (2013), middle-distance track athlete and competitor at 2016 Summer Olympics\n* Delta Burke (1974), film and television actress\n* Kevin Elliott (2007), former NFL wide receiver (Buffalo Bills)\n* Mike Metcalfe (1991), former professional baseball player (Los Angeles Dodgers)\n* Joel Piñeiro (1996), former MLB pitcher\n* Dot Richardson (1979), two-time Olympic gold medalist in softball at 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics\n* Larry E.
