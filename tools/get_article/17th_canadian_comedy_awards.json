Due to budgetary and time limitations, Canadian Comedy Awards, also known as Beavers, were awarded in only nine categories with all nominees and winners decided by public vote.  There was no festival or gala ceremony.\nTrailer Park Boys led with three nominations, for their TV show, podcast, and feature.  They won Beavers for the former two categories.\nReorganization and abbreviated awards\nThe Canadian Comedy Awards (CCA) had been put on hold when the license expired in 2015.  When the separation process was completed in 2016, there had been insufficient time for the usual consultation with industry members in creating categories, selecting juries and nominees.  Industry-voting categories were set aside and nine categories were made available for online public voting in two rounds.  An initial round of voting from 8 to 30 September determined nominees, and a second round of voting from 3 to 16 October determined the winners.\nDue to time and budgetary limitations, there was no CCA festival or awards gala for this year. Winners were announced at a nominees reception at The Second City in Toronto, Ontario, on 6 November 2016.\nWinners and nominees\n27,062 people voted online for winners in nine categories.\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Comedic Artist of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Feature\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Mike Ward\n* Kenny Hotz\n* K.
