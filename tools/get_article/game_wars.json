First published in 1991, the book centers on undercover agent Dave Hall as he infiltrates groups of poachers and gathers evidence to prosecute them.  The three chapters of the book focus on poaching of alligators in Louisiana, ivory in Alaska, and sacalait in the Southern United States.  The book highlights the debate over whether declines in wildlife populations should be attributed to over-hunting or loss of habitat.  The book also highlights and details several cases and operations that Special Agent Hall conducted along with game wardens from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries – Enforcement Division.\nThe title was reviewed in The Chicago Tribune.\nReferences"
