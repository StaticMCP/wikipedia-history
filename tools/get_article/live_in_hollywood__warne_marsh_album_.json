He consistently pushes the pace \". The AllMusic review noted: \"This privately recorded club appearance (from the Haig in Los Angeles) features the vastly underrated tenor-saxophonist Warne Marsh in excellent form... Since Warne Marsh was sparsely recorded during this era, this is a valuable document of his playing\".\nTrack listing\n# \"Fine and Dandy\" (Kay Swift, Paul James) – 7:12\n# \"You Go to My Head\" (J.
