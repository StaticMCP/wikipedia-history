In 2015, agricultural products were valued at $7,463,718,000, with slightly over half of that from the sale of livestock and dairy products. Cattle is the second largest agriculture sector of the state and Idaho is the third largest producer of milk and cheese in the United States. Although dairy plays a significant role in the economy, Idaho is most known for its potatoes. Idaho is the number one producer of potatoes in the nation and contributes to 32% of the country's production. Idaho has nearly 25,000 farms and ranches spread over 11.8 million acres of land that produces more than 185 different commodities. The state's production ranks in the top ten in the nation in nearly 30 of the commodities it produces.\nViticulture\nIdaho has three approved wine-grape growing regions, or American Viticulture Areas (AVA), located throughout the state:\n* Snake River Valley AVA - Approved in 2007 and located in the southern region of the state.\n* [https://www.eaglegrapegrowers.org Eagle Foothills AVA] - Approved in 2015 and located in the southwestern region of the state.
