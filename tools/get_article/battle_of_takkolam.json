The battle resulted in the death of Rajaditya on the battlefield and the defeat of the Chola garrison at Takkolam.\nThe battle is considered as the climax of the confrontation between the two imperials powers, the Rashtrakutas and the Cholas, for complete domination of south India. The death of prince Rajaditya is unusually commemorated by the Cholas. The Chola version of the events can be found in Larger Leiden Grant (1006 AD) of Rajaraja I and Tiruvalangadu Plates (1018 AD) of Rajendra Chola. An account of the battle, which differs in some details from the Chola version, is found in the Atakur inscription issued by Krishna III and prince Butuga II (a young underlord of Krishna III) of the Western Ganga family. The Shravanabelgola record of Ganga king Marasimha (963–975 AD) also claims victory of the king for his predecessor Bhutuga II.\nBackground\nIt seems that king Parantaka I anticipated a climactic battle with the Rashtrakutas and their allies in Tirumunaippati Nadu.\nSometime in the 930s, or perhaps as early as 923 AD, prince Rajaditya was sent with a substantial military contingent, including elephants and horses, as well as his entire household, to the region (to protect the northern edges of a nascent Chola state). The prince was joined in Tirumunaippati Nadu by his mother and his half-brother Arinjaya (whose mother also might have been from the Chera Perumal family).\nBattle at Takkolam\nThe Rashtrakuta contingent at Takkolam included a collection of feudal militias and royal soldiers (from Western Gangas, Banas and Vaidumbas among others). Prince Rajaditya was supported by a number of military personnel from Kerala (Chera) chiefdoms.\nAn account of the battle, which differs in some details from the Chola version, is found in the Atakur inscription issued by Krishna III and prince Butuga (a young underlord of Krishna III) of the Western Ganga family. According to the inscription, during the battle, Rajaditya was struck while seated atop his war elephant by an arrow from prince Butuga. The Chola prince died instantly. The Chola army was subsequently defeated and retreated in disorder.\nConsequences\nThe collapse of the Chola resistance after the battle of Takkolam lead to the virtual destruction of the Chola empire. The Rashtrakutas conquered eastern and northern parts of the Chola empire and advanced to Rameswaram.  As per the Karhad copper plates of Krishna II, dated 959 AD, the king \"uprooted the Cholas, distributed their territory among his followers, and extracted tribute from the Chera (Kerala) and Pandya kings\" during his campaign.\nThe epithet ‘Tanjaiyunkonda’ or the 'conqueror of Tanjore' was given to Krishna III as mentioned in many records found in Tondai-Mandalam, that the conclusion becomes inevitable that he had conquered and occupied the Chola capital at least for some time. The statements in the Karhad plates states that Krishna defeated the Pandyas and the Keralas, exacted tributes from the king of Ceylon and planted the creeper of his fame at Ramesvara\nAs per historians, the defeat at Takkolam reversed the substantial political gains made by Parantaka Chola in previous decades. It opened the way for a period of multiple (and perhaps even disputed) Chola accessions. The Chola royals remained in confusion, and perhaps continued a precarious political existence under the threat of Rashtrakuta invasion.\nSee also\n* Krishna III\n* Parantaka I\nReferences\nBibliography"
