It is a remaster of the 1999 game Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the original. It features significantly improved visuals, supports 4K resolution, and includes all previous expansions from the original and HD Edition. In addition, the game includes The Last Khans, an expansion that adds four new civilizations based on Central Asia and Eastern Europe, as well as four new campaigns. Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition was released for Windows on November 14, 2019, and was ported to Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on January 31, 2023. A PlayStation 5 version was released on May 6, 2025.\nGameplay\nThe core gameplay elements are shared heavily with the original. Players compete alone or in teams to build medieval economies and armies. The object of the game is to force the other players to surrender through conquest or other means, such as by harming their economies or winning other victories (gathering all holy relics for a religious victory, for example).\nSingle player modes exist, in which players can compete against AI opponents or play predesigned historical storylines known as campaigns. Non-campaign games are played on procedurally generated maps, and the options exist for varied maps and team sizes. Players with sufficient connection to the internet can play the more competitive ranked games with each other.\nChanges\nThe remaster includes 4K graphics, improved visuals for troops and buildings, the ability to zoom in and further out, and a new spectator mode. It features a new expansion called The Last Khans and includes four new civilizations: Bulgarians, Cumans, Lithuanians and Tatars. Four new campaigns were added for the new civilizations: Ivaylo, Kotyan Khan, Tamerlane and Pachacuti which is about the Inca civilization and replaces El Dorado from the HD Edition (Lithuanians do not appear as a playable civilization in any campaign; however, they represent Poles in the Ivaylo campaign). It includes all previous expansions from the original (The Conquerors) and HD edition (The Forgotten, The African Kingdoms, Rise of the Rajas).\nPlayers can choose between the original AI, the updated HD Edition AI that was added alongside the HD Edition of the game, and a newer AI developed for the Definitive Edition. When the old and new AIs were pitted against each other in a test, the new one easily defeated the old one. Unit pathfinding is also supposedly improved upon. Players can shift-queue villager tasks. Farms now have the option to be replenished automatically.\nDevelopment\nAge of Empires II: The Age of Kings was developed by Ensemble Studios and released in 1999. Ensemble Studios was acquired by Microsoft in 2001 and ultimately shuttered in 2009, just after their final project, Halo Wars, was finished. Hidden Path Entertainment developed a high-definition remaster of Age of Empires II,  HD Edition, which released in 2013. Among other features, HD Edition added Steam Workshop integration for custom content. Concurrently, a group of modders had been developing additional content and bug fixes for the original game, called Forgotten Empires. Approaching Microsoft after the mod's release in late 2012, they learned that Microsoft was developing HD Edition and had expressed interest in turning their mod into an official release. Their efforts became the first expansion for HD Edition, \"The Forgotten\", developed in conjunction with Skybox Labs. The mod team, now Forgotten Empires LLC, continued to collaborate with Microsoft on new expansions for HD Edition.\nRelease\n]]\nOn August 21, 2017, at Gamescom, Microsoft announced Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition was in development by Forgotten Empires, Tantalus Media and Wicked Witch Software.
