The list begins after the Adventus Saxonum in c. AD 446 (when the Anglo-Saxons are said to have arrived in Britain) to the late Middle Ages when England annexed the whole of Wales in 1535. The list is not exhaustive but seeks to note the significant campaigns and the major battles.\n5th century\nPagan Germanic tribes who colonized parts of the eastern and southern coasts of Britannia attacked the Britons, whom the Anglo-Saxons dubbed Wīelisċ (“Welsh; Briton; Roman; Celt”), in a series of immigrations and coordinated uprisings. Additional reinforcements from Old Saxony, Angeln, Flanders and Jutland make landings and mostly through treaty occupy large areas of eastern and south eastern Britain.\n* The Germanic people settled on the eastern \"Saxon Shore\" of Britain rise in a revolt led by Hengest and his sons against their Romano British masters.\n* Battle of Aylesford – Anglo-Saxons (particularly a group called Jutes) led by Hengest defeat the Britons (Welsh) led by Vortimer in Battle of Aylesford, Kent.\n* Battle of Crayford – Anglo-Saxons (Jutes) led again by Hengest perhaps defeat the Britons (Welsh) led by Vortimer in battle. The Britons are allegedly driven from (Kent) which is afterwards ruled by Hengist and his son Æsc and their descendants.\n* Battle of Wippedesfleot – Britons (Welsh) defeat the Anglo-Saxons (Jutes) in battle in Kent and confine them to the Isle of Thanet.\n* The Anglo-Saxons (Jutes) move westwards and regain their ground in Kent.\n* Battle of Cymensora – Anglo-Saxons (Saxons) led by Ælle defeat the Cantii close to Selsey.\n* Siege of Anderida – Anglo-Saxons (Saxons) led by Ælle capture the Castle of Anderida from the Britons and slaughter all men, women and children therein. Ælle establishes the Kingdom of the South Saxons (Sussex).\n* Cerdic reputedly defeats the Britons (Welsh) in battle close to modern day Bournemouth and establishes kingdom of the West Saxons (Wessex).\nArthurian Battles listed in the Historia Brittonum.\n* Battle on the River Glein – Arthur, general of the British forces, and the British kings defeat the Anglo-Saxons.\n* Second, third and fourth battles of Arthur at the river Dubglas in Linnuis - thought to be the old Kingdom of Lindsey, where he led the Britons to victory over the Anglo-Saxons at each battle.\n* Battle at the river Bassas – Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons.\n* Battle in the Caledonian forest – Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons(?) somewhere in the Caledonian forest in Scotland.\n* Battle of the fort (castellum) of Guinnion – Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons.\n* Battle of \"City of the Legion(s)\" (urbs Legionis) – Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons, which is thought to probably be Caerleon or Chester, both known anciently as \"city of the legion(s)\".\n* Battle of the river shore of Tribruit – Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons.\n* Battle of the hill of Breguoin – Arthur defeats the Anglo-Saxons at what is believed to be the old Roman fortress of Bremenium in Rochester, Northumberland.\n* Battle of Mons Badonicus – The Anglo-Saxons are soundly defeated by the Britons (possibly led by King Arthur). This defeat allegedly ends the Saxon attacks for decades.\n6th century\nPagan Anglo-Saxon tribes conquer southern Britain capturing London, Colchester, Silchester, Chichester, Winchester, Grantchester, Leicester, Gloucester, Cirencester, Bath, York, Lincoln and Canterbury among other places. Later in the century Angles defeat the northern Britons and colonize the north eastern coast.\n* c.509 Battle of Natanleod – the West Saxons allegedly led by Cerdic defeat the Britons at Netley, Hampshire.\n* 519 Another supposed battle in which Cerdic is victorious.

The Anglo-Saxons convert to Christianity by the middle of the century. The last serious attempts by the Britons to reclaim Britain fail.\n* 614 Battle of Beandun – The West Saxons led by Cynegils defeat the West Britons, possibly led by Tewdwr ap Peredur, at Badbury Rings, Dorset.

The borders of modern Wales are broadly defined as Mercian expansion grinds to a halt.\n* 710 after defeating the West British of Devon, led by Geraint of Dumnonia, and capturing the stronghold at Norton Fitzwarren, Ine of Wessex builds a fortress at Taunton to defend \"his\" lands. In the course of the battle King Geraint is slain.\n* c.720 Battle of Hehil, in Dumnonia where the Cornish British with support from Rhodri Molwynog are victorious against Wessex bringing freedom from attack to the Cornish for almost a century.

The result is not known but the Cornish preserve their independence, so a Cornish British victory seems likely.\n* 755 the westward expansion of Wessex resumes. Over the next thirty or so years eastern and northern Devon is controlled by Wessex.\n* 756 the Northumbrians led by Eadbert in alliance with the Picts invade the northern British Kingdom of Strathclyde and defeat their king Dumnagual who is forced to submit thus becoming, for a while, a vassal of Northumbria. A second battle at Hereford is recorded as another British victory in the Brut y Tywysogion.\n* 765 where the British invade Mercia and cause much devastation.\n* 769 Mercians campaign in Wales.\n* 760 Battle of Hereford is recorded as a British victory against the Mercians led by Offa of Mercia. The British were probably led by Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys and his son Brochfael ap Elisedd.\n* 780 the construction of Offa's Dyke begins.

The Anglo-Saxon King Ethelstan, brother Edmund and many allies, allegedly beat the armies of Olaf III Guthfrithson, the Norse–Gael King of Dublin; Constantine II, King of Alba; and Owen I, King of British Strathclyde. Though relatively little known today, it was called \"the greatest single battle in Anglo-Saxon history before the Battle of Hastings.
