However, while its competitor, during some weeks, managed to outperform it in some categories, such as the 20-49 year old demographic, as well as streaming, popularity and brand reputation charts, the latter enjoyed modest viewership, while The Emperor: Owner of the Mask still managed to top the ratings in its time slot. William Schwartz of HanCinema stated that the series is \"irredeemably stupid\", adding that \"...the obstacles the characters run into are never clearly defined. It's one of the reasons why the resolutions in this drama are so unsatisfying. There's no tension.\" Despite some expressing dissatisfaction with the story and the production as a whole, viewers praised the performances of the cast.\nRatings\nIn the table below, the blue numbers represent the lowest ratings and the red numbers represent the highest ratings.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Broadcast date\n! colspan=\"4\" |Average audience share\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |TNmS Ratings\n! colspan=\"2\" |AGB Nielsen\n|-\n! width=\"100\" |Nationwide\n! width=\"100\" |Seoul\n! width=\"100\" |Nationwide\n! width=\"100\" |Seoul\n|-\n!1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|May 10, 2017\n| 8.8% (9th)\n|10.0% (5th)\n|9.7% (6th)\n|10.5% (5th)\n|-\n!2\n| 10.1% (6th)\n| 10.9% (4th)\n| 11.6% (4th)\n| 12.1% (4th)\n|-\n!3\n|rowspan=\"2\"|May 11, 2017\n| 10.4% (8th)\n| 11.5% (6th)\n| 10.5% (6th)\n| 11.2% (5th)\n|-\n!4\n| 10.8% (6th)\n| 11.9% (5th)\n| 12.6% (4th)\n| 13.4% (4th)\n|-\n!5\n|rowspan=\"2\"|May 17, 2017\n|8.5% (12th)\n|10.4% (6th)\n|11.2% (5th)\n|11.8% (5th)\n|-\n!6\n|9.2% (10th)\n|11.0% (5th)\n|12.5% (4th)\n|12.9% (4th)\n|-\n!7\n|rowspan=\"2\"|May 18, 2017\n|10.4% (6th)\n|11.8% (5th)\n|12.0% (5th)\n|12.9% (5th)\n|-\n!8\n|11.6% (5th)\n|13.1% (4th)\n|13.4% (4th)\n|14.2% (3rd)\n|-\n!9\n|rowspan=\"2\"|May 24, 2017\n|10.6% (8th)\n|10.9% (6th)\n|11.9% (6th)\n|12.7% (5th)\n|-\n!10\n|11.7% (5th)\n|12.6% (4th)\n|13.8% (4th)\n|15.2% (3rd)\n|-\n!11\n|rowspan=\"2\"|May 25, 2017\n|11.1% (7th)\n|11.7% (5th)\n|12.1% (6th)\n|13.2% (5th)\n|-\n!12\n|12.3% (5th)\n|13.3% (4th)\n|13.8% (4th)\n|15.1% (3rd)\n|-\n!13\n|rowspan=\"2\"|May 31, 2017\n|11.8% (6th)\n|13.8% (4th)\n|11.7% (6th)\n|12.2% (4th)\n|-\n!14\n|12.8% (6th)\n|15.7% (3rd)\n|13.6% (4th)\n|14.5% (3rd)\n|-\n!15\n|rowspan=\"2\"|June 1, 2017\n|12.0% (6th)\n|14.5% (5th)\n|12.0% (6th)\n|12.6% (5th)\n|-\n!16\n|13.4% (5th)\n|15.8% (2nd)\n|13.6% (4th)\n|14.2% (3rd)\n|-\n!17\n|rowspan=\"2\"|June 7, 2017\n|11.6% (6th)\n|13.0% (5th)\n|10.9% (7th)\n|11.6% (5th)\n|-\n!18\n|12.4% (5th)\n|14.0% (3rd)\n|11.9% (5th)\n|11.0% (6th)\n|-\n!19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|June 8, 2017\n|11.0% (7th)\n|13.0% (5th)\n|11.2% (6th)\n|11.2% (6th)\n|-\n!20\n|11.4% (6th)\n|14.0% (4th)\n|12.2% (5th)\n|12.1% (5th)\n|-\n!21\n|rowspan=\"2\"|June 14, 2017\n|11.8% (5th)\n|13.0% (5th)\n|11.3% (5th)\n|11.8% (5th)\n|-\n!22\n|13.0% (4th)\n|14.5% (2nd)\n|13.0% (4th)\n|13.8% (3rd)\n|-\n!23\n|rowspan=\"2\"|June 15, 2017\n|10.3% (5th)\n|11.3% (5th)\n|11.3% (5th)\n|11.3% (5th)\n|-\n!24\n|12.0% (4th)\n|13.2% (3rd)\n|13.4% (4th)\n|13.2% (4th)\n|-\n!25\n|rowspan=\"2\"|June 21, 2017\n|10.3% (8th)\n|11.5% (5th)\n|10.6% (6th)\n|10.8% (7th)\n|-\n!26\n|11.8% (5th)\n|13.0% (4th)\n|13.2% (4th)\n|13.5% (3rd)\n|-\n!27\n|rowspan=\"2\"|June 22, 2017\n|10.0% (9th)\n|11.9% (5th)\n|10.8% (6th)\n|11.4% (5th)\n|-\n!28\n|11.6% (5th)\n|14.1% (3rd)\n|12.2% (4th)\n|12.4% (4th)\n|-\n!29\n|rowspan=\"2\"|June 28, 2017\n|9.6% (7th)\n|11.0% (5th)\n|10.2% (6th)\n|10.1% (5th)\n|-\n!30\n|11.2% (4th)\n|13.7% (3rd)\n|12.2% (4th)\n|12.3% (4th)\n|-\n!31\n|rowspan=\"2\"|June 29, 2017\n|10.5% (6th)\n|12.6% (4th)\n|11.9% (5th)\n|11.9% (5th)\n|-\n!32\n|12.2% (4th)\n|14.5% (2nd)\n|14.4% (4th)\n|14.6% (3rd)\n|-\n!33\n|rowspan=\"2\"|July 5, 2017\n|12.1% (6th)\n|14.0% (4th)\n|12.6% (5th)\n|13.3% (5th)\n|-\n!34\n|14.0% (4th)\n|14.6% (3rd)\n|13.6% (4th)\n|14.5% (4th)\n|-\n!35\n|rowspan=\"2\"|July 6, 2017\n|12.9% (5th)\n|15.2% (4th)\n|12.8% (5th)\n|13.5% (5th)\n|-\n!36\n|14.7% (4th)\n|16.6% (3rd)\n|14.9% (3rd)\n|15.2% (2nd)\n|-\n!37\n|rowspan=\"2\"|July 12, 2017\n|15.5% (5th)\n|18.0% (2nd)\n|13.2% (5th)\n|13.9% (5th)\n|-\n!38\n|17.6% (3rd)\n|20.3% (1st)\n|14.5% (4th)\n|15.2% (2nd)\n|-\n!39\n|rowspan=\"2\"|July 13, 2017\n|14.4% (5th)\n|16.1% (4th)\n|13.3% (5th)\n|13.5% (5th)\n|-\n!40\n|16.0% (3rd)\n|18.4% (2nd)\n|14.4% (3rd)\n|14.7% (3rd)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Average\n!11.5%\n!13.51%\n!12.4%\n!13.19%\n|}\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!
