Among his best-remembered roles are Bert the cop in Frank Capra's ''It's a Wonderful Life'' (1946) and Captain Clayton in John Ford's The Searchers (1956).  As a character actor, Bond frequently played cowboys, cops, or soldiers.\nEarly life\nBond was born in Benkelman in Dundy County, Nebraska. The Bond family, John W., Mabel L., and sister Bernice, lived in Benkelman until 1919, when they moved to Denver, Colorado, where Bond graduated from East High School.\nBond attended the Colorado School of Mines and then attended the University of Southern California and played football on the same team with future USC coach Jess Hill. At 6'2\" and 195 pounds, Bond was a starting lineman on USC's first national-championship team in 1928. He graduated from USC in 1931 with a bachelor of science degree in engineering.\nBond and John Wayne, who had played tackle for USC in 1926 before an injury ended his career, became lifelong friends and colleagues. Bond, Wayne, and the entire USC team were hired to appear in Salute (1929), a football film starring George O'Brien and directed by John Ford. During filming, Bond and Wayne befriended Ford, who later directed them in several films.\nFilm career\n(1956)]]\nBond made his screen debut in Salute and thereafter was a busy character actor, playing over 200 supporting roles. He appeared in 31 films released in 1935 and 23 in 1939. Rarely playing the lead in theatrical films, he starred in the television series Wagon Train from 1957 until his death in 1960. Wagon Train was inspired by the 1950 film Wagon Master, in which Bond also appeared. Wagon Master was influenced by the earlier The Big Trail. For Wagon Train, Bond was assigned the lead role of the crusty but compassionate Major Seth Adams, the trail master. He was frequently typecast in extremes, as either a friendly lawman or a brutal henchman. He had a longtime working relationship with directors John Ford and Frank Capra, performing in such films as The Searchers, Drums Along the Mohawk, The Quiet Man, They Were Expendable, and Fort Apache for Ford, with whom he made 25 films, and It Happened One Night, It's a Wonderful Life, and Riding High for Capra.\nAmong his other well-known films were Bringing Up Baby (1938), Gone with the Wind (1939), The Maltese Falcon (1941), Sergeant York (1941), Gentleman Jim (1942), Joan of Arc (1948), Rio Bravo'' (1959), and Raoul Walsh's 1930 widescreen wagon train epic The Big Trail, which also featured John Wayne, in his first leading role.\nDuring the 1940s, Bond was a member of the conservative group called the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, whose major platform was opposition to communists in the film industry.\nOn the American Film Institute's \"100 Years... 100 Movies\" list—both the original and the 10th-anniversary edition, Bond appears in the casts more often than any other actor, albeit always in a supporting role: It Happened One Night (1934), Bringing Up Baby (1938), Gone with the Wind (1939), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), The Maltese Falcon (1941), ''It's a Wonderful Life (1946), and The Searchers (1956).\nBond appeared in 13 films that were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture: Arrowsmith (1931/32), Lady for a Day (1933), It Happened One Night (1934) Dead End (1937), You Can't Take It with You (1938), Gone with the Wind (1939), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), The Long Voyage Home (1940), The Maltese Falcon (1941), Sergeant York (1941), It's a Wonderful Life (1946), The Quiet Man (1952), and Mister Roberts (1955).\nBond appeared in 24 films with John Wayne:\n* Words and Music – bit part (uncredited) (1929)\n* Salute – Midshipman Harold (1929)\n* The Lone Star Ranger – Townsperson at the Dance (uncredited) (1930)\n* Born Reckless – Sergeant (1930)\n* The Big Trail – Sid Bascomb (1930)\n* Maker of Men – Pat (uncredited) (1931)\n* Three Girls Lost – Airline Steward (uncredited) (1931)\n* College Coach – Assistant Coach (uncredited) (1933)\n* Conflict – Gus \"Knockout\" Carrigan (1936)\n* The Long Voyage Home – Yank (1940)\n* The Shepherd of the Hills – Wash Gibbs (1941)\n* A Man Betrayed – Floyd (1941)\n* Tall in the Saddle – Judge Robert Garvey (1944)\n* Dakota – Jim Bender (1945)\n* They Were Expendable – BMC \"Boats\" Mulcahey (1945)\n* 3 Godfathers – Perley \"Buck\" Sweet (1948)\n* Fort Apache'' – Sergeant Major Michael O'Rourke (1948)\n* Operation Pacific – Commander John T. \"Pop\" Perry (1951)\n* The Quiet Man – Father Peter Lonergan (1952)\n* Hondo – Buffalo Baker (1953)\n* Rookie of the Year – Buck Goodhue, Alias Buck Garrison (TV drama 1955)\n* The Searchers – Reverend Captain Samuel Johnson Clayton (1956)\n* The Wings of Eagles – John Dodge (1957)\n* Rio Bravo – Pat Wheeler (1959)\nPersonal life and death\nBond married Doris Sellers Childs in 1936, but they divorced in 1944. In 1954, he married Mary Louise Meyers, and they remained together until his death in November 1960.\nBond was an early and dedicated anti–communist.\nOn November 5, 1960, Bond suffered a massive heart attack while at a hotel in Dallas with his wife. He was pronounced dead at a Dallas hospital at the age of 57. His close friend John Wayne delivered the eulogy at his funeral. Bond's will bequeathed to Wayne the shotgun with which Wayne had once accidentally shot Bond on a hunting trip.\nOn the same day Bond died, country singer Johnny Horton was fatally injured in an automobile accident in Milano, Texas. This led to a rumor that Horton was on his way to Dallas to meet Bond, who was to offer Horton a role on Wagon Train; the rumor was untrue.  Bond's actual reason for visiting Dallas was to attend a football game at the Cotton Bowl.\nLegacy\nFor his contribution to the television industry, Bond has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6933 Hollywood Boulevard. It was dedicated on February 8, 1960. In 2001, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City.\nCredits\nFilmography\n(1933)]]\n, John Wayne, and Bond in Conflict
