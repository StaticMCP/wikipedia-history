Firuz Khan was sent in the vanguard while Sayyid Wajih-ud-din of the Sadaat-e-Bara was sent to reinforce him. It resulted in a victory for the Mughals as Nawab Firuz Khan Mewati cleared Thanesar, in northern India.\nAftermath\nFiruz Khan after clearing Thanesar would move onto Shahabad Markanda, ten miles further to the north, which was also taken by the Mughals. Therefore, Firuz Khan won all four engagements with Binod Singh. Hundreds of Sikhs who were made prisoner were strung up by Firuz to the road-side trees, their long hair being twisted to perform the office of a rope. Firuz Khan was awarded the Faujdari of Sirhind.\nReferences"
