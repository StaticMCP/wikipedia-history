For the first two years of its existence, it was known as the No More War International Movement. Chaired by Fenner Brockway, it asked members to strive for revolutionary socialism but not to take part in any war. In 1926, chairing the annual conference Brockway outlined a two-pronged strategy for peace in which peoples would resist any call to war by organised refusal to fight. The NMWM was distinctive among peace societies in advocating resistance to war. In 2012, the report of his strategy was re-run on its anniversary and in the context of parliamentary and public discussions about the commemoration of the First World War and learning the right lessons from history.\nOther notable NMWM members included Wilfred Wellock, Leslie Paul, A. Barratt Brown, Leyton Richards, W. J. Chamberlain and Monica Whately. The movement also received messages of support from several international figures, including Albert Einstein. In 1926, a member proposed the creation of a white poppy, in the manner of the British Legion's red poppies, but with the added meaning of a hope for an end to all wars. The group did not pursue the idea, but it was later taken up by the Women's Co-operative Guild. At its peak, the NMWM numbered around 3000 members, many from the Independent Labour Party. In 1929, several prominent British intellectuals signed a statement, \"Why I Believe in the No More War Movement\", supporting the NMWM's aims. The group published two journals: The New World and No More War. It became the British section of War Resisters International.\nAfter Brockway resigned in 1929, and secretaries Walter Ayles and Lucy Cox left in 1932, the group foundered. Reginald Reynolds, a Quaker influenced by Gandhi, became general secretary, but he could not stop a drift of members to the communist British Anti-War Movement and the New Commonwealth Society. Anarchists became increasingly prominent, but most left after the Movement, in accordance with its pacifist principles, refused to support the fighting of either side in the Spanish Civil War. In 1937 the organisation formally merged with the Peace Pledge Union, although the Midlands Council of the NMWM retained an independent existence for a year or so.\nNew Zealand group\nThe New Zealand NMWM was founded in the 1920s by Fred Page (1899–1930). It strived to influence public opinion in New Zealand through petitions and public discussion. By the late 1930s it was losing influence to two other New Zealand pacifist bodies: the New Zealand branch of the Peace Pledge Union, and Archibald Barrington and Ormond Burton's Christian Pacifist Society of New Zealand.\nNMWN UK Publications\n* No More War Movement: Remembrance: notes for Armistice Day (1927)\n* Disarmament by example by Arthur Ponsonby (1927)\n* Peace in our Time for all Time: The Rising Tide of War Resistance by Norman Cliff (1928)\n*  Militarism unmasked by Walter H Ayles  (1928)\n* The League's authority: war or public opinion? by A.
