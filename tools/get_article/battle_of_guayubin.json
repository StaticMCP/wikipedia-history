This was the first military conflict following the rebel cry of Grito del Capotillo on August 16, 1863. On August 19, 1863, Dominicans forces, led by General Benito Monción, shot at the cavalry of the Governor of Santiago, General Manuel Buceta, who was in Las Pastillas, on the march towards Guayubín. (One says that the Spanish military returned fire, but there was no combat). That same day, General Gaspar Polanco's military force, upon hearing the shots, pursued the Spanish cavalry and faced each other at the Macabón River. In that circumstance, the surprise attack on Buceta’s forces left heavy casualties, forcing Buceta's troops to retreat and continue their march towards Guayubin. In turn, Juan Antonio Polanco and his men took Guayubín by assault, and Federico de Jesús García, in command of his forces, occupied Monte Cristi.\nReferences"
