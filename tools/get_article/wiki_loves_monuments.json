They generally follow the basics of Wiki Loves Monuments and mostly differentiate in their scope and changes in some of the rules.\n* In spring 2013, a photographic competition called Wiki Loves Earth () was organised in Ukraine with a main focus on taking photographs of the natural heritage sites in Ukraine and subsequently uploading them on Wikimedia Commons.\n* A few months later, Wikimedia Sweden and Europeana initiated a photographic competition with the name Wiki Loves Public Art aiming to increase the number of photographs taken from public artworks. The project was organised in five countries and resulted in more than 9,250 photographs uploaded.\n* In autumn 2013, the photographic competition Wiki Loves Cultural Heritage () was organised in North Macedonia, broadening the scope of Wiki Loves Monuments to include cultural heritage in any form, both tangible and intangible, including monuments, heritage sites, dishes, outfit, tapestries, crafts, dances and other elements of traditional culture.\nSee also\n* Wiki Loves Monuments on Wikimedia Commons\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2010 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2011 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2012 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2013 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2014 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2015 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2016 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2017 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2018 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2019 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2020 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2021 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2022 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2023 winners\n* Wiki Loves Monuments 2024 winners\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-photography-competition/ Guinness World Record for Wiki Loves Monuments as the World's largest photography competition]"
