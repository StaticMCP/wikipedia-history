It was one of the first aircraft to fly in the United States using a VW engine. The prototype flew with a Huggins VW conversion. To use a standard propeller, a patented PRSU (propeller speed reducing unit) was developed to keep the engine RPM high and propeller RPM at its optimum speed.\nThe design was inspired by the Demoiselle by Alberto Santos-Dumont. The fuselage is triangular sections of welded tube steel covered in fabric.\nVariants\nA Volkswagen air-cooled engine was the only engine specified for this model, however many examples exist with alternate engine installations.\nSpecifications Stewart Headwind\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Volkswagen air-cooled engine\n|eng1 type=automotive conversion engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=65\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=wooden\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=85\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=80\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=38\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=110\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=195\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=2 hours\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=7000\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=650\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\n*Sport Aviation Feb 1972, pp 22.
