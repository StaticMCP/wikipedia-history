The series is designed to help Game Masters (GMs) populate their towns and cities rather than having to make them all from scratch.\nThe remaining books in the series focused on specific parts of town, such as fancy establishments, the seedy side of town, port city-specific locations and more. ''King's River Bridge'' details the businesses and characters that service or are near the city's river bridge.\nRather than being tied to one role-playing system, the CityBook series was a generic fantasy supplement with information that allowed its characters to be easily converted or created in any fantasy role-playing game. As such, it is still a usable supplement even though the game systems that existed when it was published have changed rules a few times.\nEntries within the book are:\nThe Royal Tax Collector by Joseph Formichella\n''The Halfling Rat Catchers' Guild by James L. Walker\nMildred Al Hassan's Messengers by Don Webb\nMother Footcandle's Oil Shack by S.
