The concert film was directed by Julian Schnabel, live at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn during five nights in December 2006. Background shots of the characters Jim and Caroline were done by Lola Schnabel.\nThe Berlin tour was the first time Lou Reed had played the full album live in over 30 years, after the original album had been a critical and commercial disappointment (in spite of it being a top 10 album hitting #7 in the UK and going Silver). Individual songs had been played, but not the entire album.\nThe concert film and album both feature three non-Berlin songs as an encore, \"Candy Says\", \"Rock Minuet\" and \"Sweet Jane\".\nTrack listing\nAll tracks composed by Lou Reed\n# \"Intro\" – 1:51\n# \"Berlin\" – 2:34\n# \"Lady Day\" – 4:12\n# \"Men of Good Fortune\" – 6:35\n# \"Caroline Says (I)\" – 4:31\n# \"How Do You Think It Feels?\" – 5:37\n# \"Oh, Jim\" – 8:16\n# \"Caroline Says (II)\" – 4:33\n# \"The Kids\" – 8:08\n# \"The Bed\" – 5:59\n# \"Sad Song\" – 8:21\n# \"Candy Says\" – 6:04\n# \"Rock Minuet\" – 7:18\n# \"Sweet Jane\" – 5:31\nPersonnel\n*Lou Reed – lead vocals, guitar\n*Steve Hunter – guitars, bandleader\n*Fernando Saunders – bass guitar, synthesizer, guitar, backing vocals\n*Tony \"Thunder\" Smith – drums, backing vocals\n*Rupert Christie – keyboards, backing vocals\n*Rob Wasserman – double bass\n*Sharon Jones – vocals\n*Anohni Hegarty – vocals\n*Steven Bernstein – flugelhorn, trumpet\n*Curtis Fowlkes – trombone\n*Paul Shapiro – saxophone, flute\n*Doug Wieselman – bass clarinet, clarinet\n*David Gold – viola\n*Eyvind Kang – viola\n*Jane Scarpantoni – cello\n*Brooklyn Youth Chorus – choir\n*Bob Ezrin - conductor\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/lou-reed/1979/eissporthalle-berlin-germany-33d6582d.html Berlin] at setlist.fm"
