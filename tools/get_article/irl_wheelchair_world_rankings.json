The first rankings were published in June 2020.\nRanking calculation method\nThe world rankings are calculated by International Rugby League using a points system based on the following criteria which are used for men's, women's and wheelchair teams:\n*Match result: win, draw or loss\n*Margin of victory or loss: a larger winning margin is worth more than a narrow win\n*Opponent strength: playing higher ranked teams is of greater value than playing lower ranked teams\n*Assessment period: all matches played over the current season and the three preceding seasons are included, using a weighting system in which more recent matches are of greater value\n*Importance of match: World Cup matches are of greatest value, followed by World Cup qualifiers,}} regional championships and then one-off matches\nHistory\nThe first rankings were published in June 2020.
