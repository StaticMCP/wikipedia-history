Blackfellow Creek rises close to the meeting of the Main Range and Mistake Mountains in the south-east of the locality and flows in a north-westerly direction through the locality exiting to the north-west (Junction View). The creek traverses from the almost the highest point of the locality to its lowest point,  above sea level.\nThe only route into the locality is East Haldon Road, which enters the locality from Junction View to the north-west and loosely follows the course of Blackfellow Creek terminating in the national park.\nApart from the north-west of the locality, the locality is within the protected areas of the Main Range National Park and the Main Range Conservation Park. In the north-west, the land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation with some crop growing along Blackfellow Creek.\nEast Haldon has the following mountains:\n* Mount Arthur ()\n* Mount Edgar ()\n* Mount Haldon ()\n* Mount Lowe ()\n* Mount Philp ()\n* Mount William ()\n* Point Pure ()\nDemographics\nIn the , East Haldon had a population of 29 people.\nIn the , East Haldon had a population of 35 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in East Haldon.
