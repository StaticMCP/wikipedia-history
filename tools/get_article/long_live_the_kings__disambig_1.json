It was released on April 20, 2010, via Suburban Noize Records. Recording sessions took place at the \"Cannibus Cabin\" in Tehachapi, California and at the Subnoize Compound and Electric Ghetto in Los Angeles, with additional vocals recorded at Spidey Hole Studios in Bend, Oregon. Production was handled by Mike Kumagai, Jim Perkins, and member Daddy X, who also served as executive producer together with Kevin Zinger. It features guest appearances from Big B, BJ Smith, Dogboy, Insane Clown Posse, Tech N9NE, Vicky Calhoun, Jason Nava and Sonny Tipton.\nThis was the first album after adding The Dirtball into the group as well as the only album to date that featured eight members of the Kottonmouth Kings on the cover of the album, as it was released just prior to Pakelika leaving the group. It features the single \"At It Again\" from Johnny Richter's new solo studio album, Laughing, as well as a single from The Dirtball, entitled \"Mushrooms\", which is said to be the sequel to a song he released earlier in his career called \"Mushroom Cloud\".\nA deluxe edition of the album including a Super Bonus CD (containing all bonus tracks that were available through other retailers' exclusives and two tracks that were only available on the Super Bonus CD) and DVD was sold exclusively through the Suburban Noize online store.  The Super Bonus CD contained 16 tracks; the first 11 tracks were included on a bonus disc with the Best Buy edition of Long Live the Kings, tracks 12-14 were included as bonus tracks on the iTunes edition of the album, and tracks 15-16 were exclusive to the Super Bonus CD. The bonus CD featured guest appearances by Saint Dog and Dog Boy, as well as tracks from D-Loc, DJ Bobby B, and the X-Pistols (a newly formed side group, similar to Kingspade, consisting of KMK vocalists Daddy X and The Dirtball).\nThe album peaked at number 26 on the Billboard 200, number 3 on both the Top Rap Albums and the Independent Albums, number 6 on the Top Rock Albums, and number 4 on the Top Alternative Albums chart in the United States.\nTrack listing\n| extra_column = Artist(s)\n| title21 = High Times\n| extra21 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length21 = 3:50\n| title22 = All I Need\n| note22 =\n| extra22 = Kottonmouth Kings and Dogboy\n| length22 = 3:32\n| title23 = It's a Lie\n| note23 =\n| extra23 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length23 = 4:01\n| title24 = Talkin' Shit on the Internet\n| extra24 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length24 = 3:51\n| title25 = Life Is Beautiful\n| extra25 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length25 = 4:22\n| title26 = Smiling Faces\n| extra26 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length26 = 4:07\n| title27 = Enjoy The Ride\n| note27 =\n| extra27 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length27 = 3:35\n| title28 = Dead and Gone\n| extra28 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length28 = 4:17\n| title29 = Playa\n| note29 =\n| extra29 = D-Loc and Saint Dog\n| length29 = 5:04\n| title30 = P in the Punk\n| extra30 = X-Pistols\n| length30 = 2:32\n| title31 = Super Chronic Megablast\n| extra31 = DJ Bobby B\n| length31 = 4:15\n| title32 = Free Soul\n| extra32 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length32 = 4:25\n| title33 = American Made\n| extra33 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length33 = 2:07\n| title34 = Last Joint\n| extra34 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length34 = 3:44\n| title35 = Mission Control\n| extra35 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length35 = 3:52\n| title36 = Top of the World\n| extra36 = Kottonmouth Kings\n| length36 = 4:26\n}}\nPersonnel\n;Kottonmouth Kings\n*Brad \"Daddy X\" Xavier – vocals, producer, arranger, sequencer, executive producer, liner notes\n*Dustin \"D-Loc\" Miller – vocals\n*Timothy \"Johnny Richter\" McNutt – vocals\n*David \"The Dirtball\" Alexander – vocals\n*Luiz \"Lou Dog\" Gaez – performer\n*Robert \"DJ Bobby B\" Adams – performer\n*Patrick \"Pakelika\" Cochrun – performer\n;Guest musicians\n*BJ Smith – vocals (tracks: 1, 4, 14, 18)\n*Aaron \"Tech N9NE\" Yates – vocals (track 2)\n*Jason Nava as Dazed Stoner – voice (track 4)\n*Sonny Tipton as Officer Babbit – narrator (tracks: 6, 12, 17)\n*Vicky Calhoun – vocals (track 9)\n*Joseph \"Violent J\" Bruce – vocals (track 12)\n*Joseph \"Shaggy 2 Dope\" Ultser – vocals (track 12)\n*Robert \"Dog Boy\" Rogers – vocals (track 15)\n*Bill \"Big B\" Mahoney – vocals (track 17)\n;Technical\n*Jim Perkins – guitar & producer (tracks: 15, 17)\n*Mike Kumagai – producer, mixing, engineering\n*Patrick \"P-Nice\" Shevelin – mixing, engineering\n*Tom Baker – mastering\n*Kevin Zinger – executive producer, management\n*Casey Quintal – art direction, design\n*Fabrice Henssens – photography\n*Derek Plank – photography\n*Luke Tarnowski – illustration\n*Ivory Daniel – management\n*Ron Opaleski – booking\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2010)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
