Recognition of his work in liquid crystal elastomers included the 2003 EuroPhysics Prize from the European Physical Society.\nBeyond research, Mark also played an important role in physics education in schools, culminating in the Isaac Physics program, which he founded with Prof. Lisa Jardine-Wright. They were awarded IOP Lawrence Bragg Medal and Prize for this initiative.\nHe was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 2002, and Fellow of the Royal Society in 2012.\nReferences"
