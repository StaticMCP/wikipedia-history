      "text": "# Timeline of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2024 Atlantic hurricane season saw an above-average amount of storms and was very active in terms of ACE. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, and officially ended on November&nbsp;30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic Ocean (over 97%). No subtropical or tropical development occurred in the Atlantic prior to the start of the season, and the season got off to the slowest start since 2014. Even so, hurricane researchers predicted an above-normal number of named storms this year.|group=\"nb\"}}\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) are: Greenwich, Cape Verde, Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first, with the respective regional time zone included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\n__TOC__\nTimeline of events\nJune\nJune 1\n* The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.|group=\"nb\"}}\nJune 20\n* 00:00&nbsp;UTC (7:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;CDT, June&nbsp;19) at Tropical Storm Alberto attains its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of  and a minimum barometric pressure of .\n* 09:00&nbsp;UTC (4:00&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp;CDT) at Tropical Storm Alberto makes landfall near Tampico with sustained winds of , and dissipates later that day inland over mountainous terrain.\nJune 28\n* 12:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp;AST) at Tropical Depression Two forms from a tropical wave about  east of Barbados.\nJune 29\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;AST, June&nbsp;28) at The recently formed tropical depression strengthens into Tropical Storm Beryl about  east-southeast of Barbados.\nJune 30\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;AST, June&nbsp;29) at Tropical Storm Beryl strengthens into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane about  east-southeast of Barbados.\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp;AST) at Hurricane Beryl intensifies to Category&nbsp;2 strength about  east-southeast of Barbados.\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp;AST) at Hurricane Beryl intensifies to Category&nbsp;3 strength about  east-southeast of Barbados, making it the first major hurricane of the season.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;AST) at Hurricane Beryl intensifies to Category&nbsp;4 strength about  east-southeast of Barbados.
