Refugees across the border in Serbia planned the rebellion and rose up together with villagers from the area during a scheduled meeting of the two sides agreed upon by the Serbian Prince Miloš Obrenović, the community protector, and the Vali of Rumelia. He had promised to help the rebels, but broke out his promise and remained loyal to the Ottoman Sultan. The Serbian prince suppressed the rebels and punished the fugitives.\nBackground\nIn the aftermath of the Serbian Revolution (1804–17), in which several commanders from the Pirot area participated in and during which also a part of the Pirot nahiya was liberated, and the Serbian rebel army engaged the Ottomans in the vicinity of Pirot, some locals saved themselves from zulum (cruelty, oppression, persecution) and fled to the newly established Principality of Serbia. From there, some organized into hajduk bands that crossed Knjaževac (formerly Gurgusovac) into Ottoman territory. Due to the Serbian Revolution and influence of the Principality of Serbia, the Ottomans viewed suspiciously of Pirot. During the Greek Revolution (1821–29), the locals turned to Prince Miloš for aid and protection. There was a dispute between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire in 1831–34 over border demarcation in the Stara Planina area; Prince Miloš tried hard to have the western part ceded to Serbia, which failed, as the new borders were set up and held officially until 1878. In January 1835, 16 villages in Lower Ponišavlje rose up due to Ottoman zulum; the rebellion was suppressed with the mediation of Prince Miloš. The zulum continued however and a large group of villagers therefore migrated to Serbia. Another rebellion broke out in March, in which 100 rebels died; the rebellion was suppressed, again with the mediation of Prince Miloš and his minister Avram Petronijević. Pirot was a larger town, inhabited by Orthodox Christians and Muslims, estimated to have had a population of 6–8,000. It suffered greatly from plague in 1834, 1835 and 1836.\nPrelude\nwas the mediator, as protector of the Orthodox population south of Serbia, in the events surrounding the rebellion.]]\nIn 1836, the ayan (leader) in Pirot was Mahmud the Kapıcıbaşı, while the Orthodox bishop was Hieronymos, a Greek. These two acted in concert, and amerced and oppressed the population. German historian Nenad Stefanov notes that the rebellions between 1836 and 1840 in the areas of Niš, Pirot and Belogradchik are object of contention between nationally-centered Serbian and Bulgarian historical narratives, both sides claiming them to be manifestations of respective national consciousness.\nDuring the Tanzimat period (1839–1876), the Sanjak of Niš was in Ottoman usage included as an area part of \"Bulgaristan\", and its inhabitants were called Bulgarians. Accordingly researchers like Mark Pinson describe all rebellions in the area, including the Pirot Rebellion of 1836, as uprisings of Bulgarians. A study of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences from 2015, with authors G. Demeter et al, states that contemporary Serbian newspapers and maps, designated the town of  Pirot and its inhabitants as Bulgarian and as a situated outside the boundaries of the Serbian race.\nThe area was ecclesiastically part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Serbian philologist and linguist Vuk Karadžić (1787–1864) regarded the speech of Pirot and neighbouring Chiprovtsi (now in Bulgaria) as part of the Serbian language, and also called on the Pirot area and close to Sofia to be ceded to Serbia (1828). Prince Miloš, when sending gifts to Hadži-Neša, called himself \"Prince of the free Serbs\". }}\n, p. 334.}}\nReferences\nSources\n;Books\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n;Journals\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n;Symposia\n*\nSee also\n*Berkovitsa Rebellion (1836)\n*Belogradchik Rebellion (1836)\n*Niš Rebellion (1841)"
