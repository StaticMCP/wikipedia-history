      "text": "# Phlyctis lueckingii\n\nPhlyctis lueckingii is a species of corticolous (bark-dwelling) lichen in the family Phlyctidaceae. Found in Sri Lanka, it was formally described as a new species by Gothamie Weerakoon and André Aptroot in 2016. The type was collected on the Dothalugala mountain, where it was found in a rainforest on the smooth bark of a tree. The species epithet honours lichenologist Robert Lücking.\nCharacteristics of the lichen include its relatively large (0.2–0.3&nbsp;mm in diameter), grey apothecia that occur in groups, and its fusiform (spindle-shaped) ascospores that have 7 septa and measure 27–29 by 5.5–6.5&nbsp;μm. The thallus contains the lichen product norstictic acid.\n}}"
