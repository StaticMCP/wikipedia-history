Set in present-day Montana, it explores the tension and mistrust that can characterize interactions between Native Americans and White Americans.\nPlot\nA group of re-enactors attempt to stage a 100th-anniversary battle between US Cavalry and Blackfeet Indians. Racial hostilities and a real gun lead to some all too real casualties, and three young Blackfeet men are caught in the middle. The film follows their flight for freedom in the face of an angry community which has mistakenly blamed them for the violence.\nCast\n*Billy Wirth as Sonny Crowkiller\n*Kevin Dillon as Skitty Harris\n*Tim Sampson as Warren Cutfoot\n*Jimmie Ray Weeks as Jay Stivic\n*Kevyn Major Howard as Calvin Morrisey\n*Jerry Hardin as The Sheriff\n*Tantoo Cardinal as Sonny's Mother\n*Bill McKinney as The Mayor\n*Guy Boyd as Major Crawford, National Guard\n*R.D.
