The Saturn Awards, which are the oldest film and series-specialized awards to reward science fiction, fantasy, and horror achievements, included the category for the first time at the 42nd Saturn Awards ceremony, when the Saturn Award went through major changes in their television categories. It specifically rewards streaming television series created for non-traditional platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. At the 45th Saturn Awards, it was discontinued to make room for the Saturn Awards for best streaming horror/thriller and science fiction/action/fantasy series, in addition to the award for best streaming superhero series.\n(NOTE: Year refers to year of eligibility, the actual ceremonies are held the following year)\nThe winners are listed in bold.\nWinners and nominees\n2010s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"550px\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"centre\"\n|-\n! width=\"70px\"|Year\n!
