The area includes all municipalities in those provinces with an Afrikaans-speaking majority. In 2009, it was claimed to have had a membership of approximately 1,000 people across South Africa, but official membership figures are not made public. The party currently holds two seats on the Cape Town City Council.\nIt is registered with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and was on the provincial ballot of the Western Cape in the South African general elections of 2009, where it received 2,552 votes. It again contested in the municipal elections of 2016, where it received 4,473 votes. In the elections of 2019, it received 9,331 votes.\nThe party did not compete in the 2024 South African general election after failing to meet the IEC's new signature requirements as stipulated in the 2023 Electoral Amendment Bill. Fellow pro-independence parties, the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) and newly formed Referendum Party (RP) did contest the elections.\nFormation and early years\nThe party grew out of a Facebook group in 2007, and is led by Jack Miller, a Cape Town businessman. On 17 March 2009, the young party's website was defaced by vandals. The website was replaced with an image of a \"black devil\" and the words \"fuck off\". Jack Miller, the party leader, alleged that the attack would have required a great deal of funding and equipment, and claimed that it had been perpetrated by one of South Africa's two largest political parties, the African National Congress or the Democratic Alliance. The attack was investigated by the IEC, which has come to no conclusions.\nIn 2009, the Cape Party petitioned the Independent Electoral Commission to reject the registration of another political party, the recently formed Congress of the People, on the grounds that the abbreviation of their name (Cope) could cause confusion between the two parties amongst voters, which is against the IEC's regulations. The IEC rejected the objection.\nIn 2010, the Cape Party announced its support for the Thembu clan, whose chief has said that the clan is seeking autonomy for the clan's territory east of the Fish River. King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo had announced the plan after his 15-year conviction for violent crime. After discussions within the royal family, the plan was suspended shortly after.\nFuck White People Court case\nDuring 2017, the Cape Party instituted an application to have a poster, which was covered with the words \"Fuck White People\" in black-and-white all caps letters, on display since 2016 alongside a chair and \"goldendeanboots\" as part of an exhibition called The Art of Disruptions at the Cape Town gallery, declared hate speech.\nThe work was created by Dean Hutton, who wore a suit with the same print publicly before Iziko approached them. Some members approached the art gallery and placed a sticker over the poster that read \"love thy neighbour\". For this, the gallery charged them criminally for damage to property. In the incident, the party members who defaced the poster were documented accosting and physically manhandling Iziko staff members in their attempts to stop the party's actions.\nThe application was heard in the Equality Court of South Africa in Cape Town in terms of the Regulations Relating to the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act. However, the Court declared that the words \"Fuck white people\" were not hate speech.\nLand expropriation without compensation\nOn 13 June 2018, the Cape Party lodged a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to have the parliamentary resolution on land expropriation declared a crime against humanity.\nThe Cape Party stated that South Africa is signatory to numerous international treaties which safeguard property rights, Standing in front of the SAHRC offices in Cape Town, leader of the Cape Party, Jack Miller said: \"There is another word for state expropriation without compensation; it is quite simply theft in the most criminal sense.\"\nThe Cape Party stated that the resolution is in contravention of international law and cited such examples as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 17 (2): \"No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her property.\" And that it is taking the issue to the International Court of Justice.\nThe Cape Party stated that one permanent solution to this communist South African government action is the Secession of the Western Cape to form the Cape of Good Hope.\n2021 election recount\nIn the 2021 elections the party obtained 17,881 votes overall and obtained 1 seat in the City of Cape town.\nThe party received reports from voters that they had voted at certain voting stations but that the results for those stations were showing 0 votes for the Cape Independence Party signed affidavits were obtained from voters and submitted to the IEC.\nThe IEC refused a recount, so the Cape Independence Party appealed to the Electoral court and won.\nAfter the recount the parties votes totalled 19,180; with the party awarded a second seat in the city and the Democratic Alliance losing a seat that they had been previously awarded.\nPlatform\nThe party maintains that the population of the Western Cape and parts of surrounding provinces (which it calls the Cape Nation), is culturally and linguistically distinct from the rest of South Africa, and is therefore entitled to statehood under chapter 14, section 235 of the South African Constitution. The party says the Republic of South Africa is a colonial construct, and that the Cape would be better off if it separated from South Africa. It claims that the national government and legislative apparatus are racist and totalitarian, and has referred to President Jacob Zuma as an illegitimate occupier of the Cape. They have cited black economic empowerment, affirmative action and housing allocation policies as examples of the national government's racist policies.\nEconomics\nThe party cites the Division of Revenue Act in which 78% of revenue raised in the province never returns and that taxpayers pay R3.5 Billion per week to the South African treasury. The province, the second wealthiest in South Africa, would be more economically successful if these revenues were spent within its borders.\nThe Cape Party has said that it occupies a unique position, as it focuses on local issues, instead of attempting to contest power in national elections, which would legitimise the national political machinery.\nThe party maintains that representative democracy has failed and proposes a system of direct democracy where the electorate are consulted in referendums before passing laws. It also supports the ability of individual communities and cultural groups to determine the laws that govern them. It supports free ports, and has suggested turning its prospective republic into a tax haven.\nPolicies\nThe three main policies that the Cape party envisage for the Cape of Good Hope, which will have bearing on all other policies are their Canton political system, direct democracy electoral system and Singaporean economic system.\nElection results\nThe Cape Party has so far contested elections in 2009, 2011, 2016, 2019 and 2021. The party fielded candidates in all wards of the City of Cape Town in the municipal elections of 2011, and also contested wards of the Cape Winelands, Overberg, Eden and West Coast municipalities. The party launched its manifesto for the election on 15 April 2011. Miller described the election as \"an opportunity to take great steps toward our end goal of establishing the Cape Republic\".\nIn addressing the results of the 2009 elections, a party spokesperson described the Cape Party's campaign in those elections as a publicity drive, noting that it didn't expect to win any seats. He said, however, that the party hoped to win a \"significant portion\" of votes in 2011, adding that the party's support was growing and was strongest in people between the ages of 18 and 35. He acknowledged, however, that this was difficult for the media to believe. The party finally garnered 1,670 votes (0.1% of the Western Cape vote) on the proportional representation ballot in the 2011 election.\nIn 2011, the Cape Party was the first political party to put up election posters in the City of Cape Town. However, the party claimed that 2500 of these went missing in three weeks. A party spokesman blamed the Democratic Alliance for the missing posters, calling them \"masters of the dark arts\", and alleging that the Cape Party posters had been replaced with posters for the DA.\nIn the runup to the 2021 South African municipal elections, the party released a Cape Republic Novelty Passport. The party earned gained two seats in the City of Cape Town.\nProvincial elections\n! rowspan=2 | Election\n! colspan=3 | Western Cape\n|-\n! Valid Votes !!
