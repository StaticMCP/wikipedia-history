The Sendai River (Sendaigawa) was among the final obstacles to Hideyoshi's attack on Kagoshima, the center of the Shimazu clan's domains.\nToyotomi Hideyoshi and his half-brother Hashiba Hidenaga met a Shimazu clan force, led by Niiro Tadamoto, near the river. Despite being vastly outnumbered 5,000 to 170,000, Niiro led his men in a charge against the Toyotomi force, and even engaged the famous warrior Katō Kiyomasa in personal combat before retreating under cover of night.\nReferences\n*Turnbull, Stephen (2010).
