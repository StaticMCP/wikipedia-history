The ceremony launched in 1967 as  Music City News Awards; it is the oldest award show currently airing under Paramount Global. The ceremony originally aired on TNN, prior to its parent company's acquisition of former rival network Country Music Television in 1991. The show would then air on CMT from 2001 to 2021. Beginning in 2022 until the pause in 2025, the show was broadcast live on CBS.\nHistory\nEarly history\nBeginning in 1967, the Music City News Awards were presented yearly by the now—defunct Music City News magazine. In 1988, The Nashville Network (TNN) began a fan—voted awards show dubbed the '''Viewers' Choice Awards to help the network celebrate its fifth anniversary; two were broadcast in 1988 and 1989. In 1990, the two awards shows merged to become the TNN/Music City News Country Awards'''. TNN's contract with Music City News ended in 1999, and the magazine ceased publication shortly thereafter.\nCountry Weekly became the presenting sponsor of the awards show in 2000, and the show was known as ' Country Weekly presents the TNN Music Awards.\n2001—2021\nIn 2001, as TNN began to phase out its association with country music, the decision was made to shift the awards show to sister network CMT. The 2001 show, known as the TNN/CMT Country Weekly Music Awards', was simulcast on both networks.\nWhen the show moved permanently to CMT, Country Weekly ended its brief association with the production. During this era, viewers voted for the nominees by telephone or mail in traditional categories such as \"Entertainer of the Year,\" \"Male/Female Artist of the Year,\" \"Song of the Year,\" etc.  Most of the categories mirrored those on the CMA Awards and ACM Awards, except all awards were fan—voted.\nThe awards show was completely retooled in 2002 as the CMT Flameworthy Video Music Awards, named for the network's branding concept at the time for its most popular videos. The \"Flameworthy\" name was coined by program development vice president Kaye Zusmann, and aimed to symbolize the waving of lighters or similar lights at concerts (this was before the current negative meaning of the word flaming from the Internet became more commonplace).  The show became more production—based, rather than awards—based, and was modeled after sister network MTV's Video Music Awards. In the process, the traditional awards were shifted to specifically honor the music videos of country artists.\nThe show included several non—traditional categories highlighting especially funny, sexy, and patriotic videos; however, these categories were phased out over the years. The show further differentiated itself from the CMA Awards and ACM Awards by showcasing bluegrass performers such as Alison Krauss and Earl Scruggs.\nIn 2003, the show was moved to April but returned to June in 2009 to coincide with the CMA Music Festival (the renamed \"Fan Fair\") and the influx of tourists to Nashville as well as capitalize on a time when many of the artists would already be in Nashville at once.\nThe name of the show was changed to the CMT Music Awards in 2005.\nIn 2020, the awards were delayed until October due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with that year's CMA Fest not going forward. Initially planned for October 14, a scheduling conflict with that year's Billboard Music Awards caused the ceremony to be pushed back to October 21.\n2021—present\nOn June 28, 2021, ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Global) announced that the awards would move to broadcast television on sister network CBS and shift back to April beginning in 2022. CBS subsequently declined to renew its broadcast rights to the ACM Awards (which had also traditionally been held in April), citing declining viewership in comparison to increased rights fees demanded by Dick Clark Productions.\nIn 2023, after more than twenty years in Nashville, the CMT Music Awards were hosted for the first time at the Moody Center in Austin, Texas.\nIn February 2025, Bruce Gillmer of Paramount International Networks announced a one-year pause for a few selected events scheduled for 2025, including the CMT Music Awards, as Paramount seeks \"to reimagine and optimize [our] events slate going forward\".\nMajor awards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" font-size=\"10%\" width=\"100%\"|\n|-\n!
