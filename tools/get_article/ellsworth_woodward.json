During the late 19th century in New Orleans, Ellsworth and his older brother William Woodward were two of the most influential figures in Southern art.

Ellsworth Woodward is best known for founding the Newcomb Pottery movement, and for his landscape-structure, genre, etcher.\nof New Orleans]]\nBiography\nWoodward was born in 1861 in Seekonk, Massachusetts, and died in 1939 in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he spent the majority of his adult life.
