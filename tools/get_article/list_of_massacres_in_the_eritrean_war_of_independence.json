This asymmetrical campaign against Ethiopian control left the Ethiopian military at a disadvantage and so it embarked on a policy of destroying Eritrean villages. It was hoped that this would prevent the separatists from continuing their campaign. Listed below are some of the major civilian massacres committed by both the Ethiopian Empire and the Derg.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date||Deaths||Location||Description of event\n|-\n|1967-07-24\n|172\n|Hazemo\n|Several villages wiped out and the throats of men slit in front of their wives and children.\n|-\n|Late 1967\n|Approx 50\n|Akordat\n|Students suspected of being members of the ELF were hanged in the centre of town.
