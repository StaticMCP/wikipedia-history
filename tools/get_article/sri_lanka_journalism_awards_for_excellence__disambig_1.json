Applicants who do not win a category but have satisfied the standards set by the panel of judges receive merit awards which are only certificates.\nNo cash or other prizes and incentives are offered to the winners. In some years, the winners received other gifts such as mobile phones or tablets along with their awards.\nHistory\nThe Journalism Awards Programme was inaugurated in 1999 by The Editors’ Guild of Sri Lanka (TEGOSL) following the “Colombo Declaration on Media Freedom and Social Responsibility.”\nIn 2004, the Sri Lanka Press Institute (SLPI) was established and from then on, the Awards Night was jointly organized by TEGOSL and the SLPI.\nThe inaugural ceremony was held at TransAsia Hotel in Colombo. After that, the ceremony moved to Mount Lavinia Hotel which became a co-sponsor of the event and became the host for every ceremony after that. Usually, the ceremony is held in the last week of July every year.\nEntry and prize considerations\nThe Journalism Awards for Excellence programme does not automatically consider all applicable works in media. All interested candidates are invited every year to apply for an award in a category of their choice. Generally, the entries close in the last week of March every year.\nTo be considered for an award, the qualifying work should have been published in a Sri Lankan newspaper between January 1 and December 31 of the preceding year.\nTo qualify for awards, the applicant should be a full-time journalist, a journalism student doing an internship or someone who had a minimum of ten articles published in a newspaper during the previous calendar year.\nThe organisers announce the application deadline in media and also on the Sri Lanka Press Institute website.\nAlong with the newspaper articles, candidates are required to submit an application form which can be downloaded from the Sri Lanka Press Institute website.\nThe organisers appoint a panel of judges every year and this panel is allowed to meet and consider the entries independently.\nThere is no competitive process or an involvement of the judges for three of the main award categories. These “Special Awards” are conferred by the TEGSOL as determined by them. The Special Awards categories are; “D.  R. Wijewardene Award for Earning the Appreciation of Peers and the Public”, “Sepala Gunasena Award for Defending Press Freedom in Sri Lanka” and “Long and Distinguished Service”.\nChanges in Award categories\nThe award categories have changed over the years. Some new categories have been introduced; some categories have been abandoned while some categories have undergone changes to the name of the category.\nFrom 2000 to 2006, there were three separate awards named D.B. Dhanapala award for Best Journalist in Sinhala Language,  D. B. Dhanapala award for Best Journalist in Tamil Language and D. B. Dhanapala award for Best Journalist in English Language. This was in addition to the main award Mervyn de Silva Award for Journalist of the Year. But D.B. Dhanapala Awards were abandoned in 2006.\nThe Upali Wijewardene Award for Human Interest Reporting category underwent a change of name to Upali Wijewardene Award for Feature writer of the year after the first two years.\nBest Environmental Reporter of The Year was initially known as the Best Environmental Report of the Year.\nD. B. Dhanapala Award for the Scoop of the Year later shed “D. B. Dhanapala Award” from its category title, and is now known as the “Scoop of the Year”\nA significant new category for Investigative Journalist of the Year was introduced in 2008, while a new category for news websites was introduced from 2016. Best Health Care and Medical Reporter category was introduced in 2017.\nAn award for Best TV News Story was offered in 2007 but was abandoned after that.\nSeveral Award categories started as one main award but were later divided into three language categories later.\nControversies\nJournalists of the Leader Group of Publications which published the newspapers The Sunday Leader, The Morning Leader and Irudina boycotted the 2003 programme to show solidarity with one of their colleagues Frederica Jansz alleging that Jansz had to face harassment from the Editors’ Guild of Sri Lanka regarding her application. Incidentally, Jansz won the top award – “Mervyn de Silva Award for Journalist of the Year” at the following year’s edition of the programme.\nThen in 2007, the Leader Group claimed that a new regulation introduced by the organisers forced them out of contention for awards. The newspaper published an article alleging that the new regulation made it mandatory for all applications to be endorsed by the editor of the publication to the fact that the applicant subscribed to the Code of Ethics of the Editors’ Guild and the Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka.\nAll editors of the group including The Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge were not members of the Editors’ Guild and did not subscribe to the Press Complaints Commission or the mandate of the Sri Lanka Press Institute. It effectively meant that the journalists of the Group were not eligible to apply for awards.\nInterestingly, until that year, The Sunday Leader was one of the most successful publications at the awards programme producing the winner of Journalist of the Year Award every year except in 1998 and 2001. (They boycotted the event in 2003).\nTwo years later, journalists from the Leader Group of Publications resumed taking part in the programme as some regulations were changed. Wickrematunge was assassinated in 2009.\nMultiple award winning journalists (more than four)\n* 9 – Sonali Samarasinghe (The Sunday Leader) – Mervyn de Silva Journalist of the Year 2000, 2001, 2005, 2006, D.
