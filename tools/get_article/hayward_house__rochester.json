Designed by Robert Baker and completed in 1823, it originally housed aged “industrious poor” from St Nicholas parish. A red-brick Georgian-style block of three storeys with a symmetrical 3–1–3 bay front, it remains a Grade II listed building. Today Hayward House is managed by the Richard Watts Charities and provides six self-contained flats.\nFounder and trust\nThe benefactor was Sir John Hayward (c.1591–1636), a Kent landowner and son of Sir Rowland Hayward (Lord Mayor of London). Born in London and later Sheriff of Kent, Sir John lived at Rochester from the 1620s and died in 1636. By his will he left the manor of Minster (Isle of Sheppey) and other lands to trustees “for the erection of workhouses” and relief of the poor, especially in Rochester’s St Nicholas parish. His charter trustees were to establish almshouses and provide tools and employment for the poor, reflecting the philanthropic concern of the early Stuart era.\nImportantly, Sir John’s endowment was not immediately realised. Due to ambiguities in the trust and competing interests, the estate was held in Chancery and under continuous legal challenge for nearly two centuries.  In the late 18th century a descendant of one trustee contested the charity’s use, triggering a 25-year suit beginning around 1790. Only after this prolonged litigation – apparently in the Court of Chancery – could the accumulated funds be applied as intended. Consequently, although Hayward died in 1636, no almshouse was built until 1823, roughly 187 years later.\n1823 Foundation and poor relief context\nBy the early 19th century, Rochester’s poor relief was handled by parish and charity schemes.  Under the old Poor Law, local parishes (St Nicholas, Strood, etc.) maintained small workhouses. For example, Rochester’s St Nicholas parish had its own workhouse by 1725, alongside Strood and other parishes. Charity funds like the Watts Charity (for rope-making) also provided outdoor relief and schooling. In this milieu, Hayward House was founded privately by charity trustees to supplement existing relief.\nBuilt in 1823 as the House of Industry, Hayward House was specifically intended “for the industrious poor of St. Nicholas”. Unlike the parish workhouse, which housed all paupers, Hayward House served a narrower niche: it provided long-term sheltered housing for elderly or “impotent” poor who could no longer work. It thus functioned alongside rather than replacing the parish workhouses. This was just before the 1834 Poor Law reform; Hayward House remained a private charity-run almshouse under the old system. In summary, its purpose was to relieve poverty among the aged in Rochester/Strood when other aid was still largely parish-based (hence union workhouses would only follow in 1837).\nArchitecture and building\nArchitect and style\nHayward House was designed by Robert Baker, a little-known local builder/architect active in the early 1800s.  (No other buildings by him are documented, suggesting he may have been a local journeyman or amateur architect.)  The style is a restrained late Georgian form with minor neoclassical influence.. It is a plain brick block with a Welsh-slate roof.  The front elevation is symmetrical in a 3–1–3 bay format: three windows on each side of a single central bay containing the entrance.  Each side of the door is flanked by shallow brick pilaster-bays (plain projections) carrying inscription panels (the inscriptions note the 1823 date and benefactor). Windows are original sash with glazing bars and stone sills. A simple brick string-course wraps horizontally between the upper floors. Internally, although altered, the building likely had a central corridor with small living rooms off it (as was common in small almshouses), but no detailed floorplan has been found for the 1823 layout.\nModifications and conservation\nThe exterior of Hayward House retains much of its original early-19th-century character. However, it underwent significant modernisation in the 20th century.. In 1960 the property was transferred to Richard Watts Charities, which in 1961 replaced the solid wood entrance door with a glazed one, rewired and updated services, and installed external metal fire-escapes. In 1995–96 the interior was extensively refurbished: the old dormitory-style plan (housing up to 12 individuals) was converted into six self-contained one-bedroom flats. A small electric passenger lift was added to give wheelchair access to the first floor. These works were sympathetic enough to win a local conservation award in 1996. Throughout, the exterior red-brick façade and slate roof were preserved, and the 1961 glazed door and rear casement windows are the main visual changes noted by Historic England. No major planning disputes or heritage conflicts have been recorded, implying the alterations were approved as necessary for continued use.\nGrade II Listing\nHayward House was listed at Grade II in 1991 (List Entry 1336103) in recognition of its architectural and historic interest. The listing notes its date (1823), builder (trustees of Sir John Hayward), and 1961 modernization. It covers the building’s external fabric — the brick walls, symmetrical façade, sash windows, and original proportions. This status means the almshouse is legally protected as a “significant early-19th-century charitable building” (an exemplar of local philanthropic architecture). The listing explicitly includes the 1961 glazed door and later roof alterations, indicating these do not detract from its special interest. In practice, the 1961 and 1996 changes have been managed so as to preserve the exterior appearance, allowing the building to retain its Grade II designation throughout.\nLocation and access\nHayward House is at 1–8 Corporation Street, Rochester, Kent ME1 1NJ, on Corporation Street in the town centre. By train, Rochester railway station (86 Corporation Street) is on the same street and is a short walk (around 300 yards / a few minutes) to Hayward House. By bus, alight at the stops on or adjacent to Corporation Street (for example Rochester Guildhall Museum / Visitor Information Centre) or at Star Hill / Furrell’s Road; these stops are typically a 2–5 minute walk to Corporation Street. By car, short-stay on-street parking and pay-and-display/short-stay spaces are available on Corporation Street and nearby.\nReferences"
