As of 2025, there are 14 completely recognized autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches, with 3 partially recognized Eastern Orthodox churches.\nThe \"date\" column is determined the most recent date with support from a Patriarch (self-declared autocephaly is not taken into consideration). The \"date\" column also excludes former autocephaly halted by a force, and re-granted later.\nAny tomoi once proclaimed, but no longer accepted.\n4th-century\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Granter\n!Recipient\n!Recognized by\n|-\n|325\n|First Council of Nicaea\n|Patriarchate of Rome\n|\n|-\n|325\n|First Council of Nicaea\n|Patriarchate of Alexandria\n|\n|-\n|325\n|First Council of Nicaea\n|Patriarch of Antioch\n|\n|-\n|381\n|First Council of Constantinople\n|Patriarchate of Constantinople\n|}}\n|}\n5th-century\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Granter\n!Recipient\n!Recognized by\n|-\n|431\n|Council of Ephesus\n|Cypriot Orthodox Church\n|\n|-\n|451\n|Council of Chalcedon\n|Patriarchate of Jerusalem\n|\n|}\n15th-century\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Granter\n!Recipient\n!Recognized by\n|-\n|1448\n|Jonah of Moscow\n|Russian Orthodox Church\n|\n|}\n16th-century\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Granter\n!Recipient\n!Recognized by\n|-\n|1589\n|Ecumenical Patriarch Jeremias II of Constantinople\n|Russian Orthodox Church\n|\n|}\n19th-century\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Date\n!Granter\n!Recipient\n!Recognized by\n|-\n|29 June 1850\n|Ecumenical Patriarch Anthimus IV of Constantinople\n|Church of Greece\n|\n|-\n|1879\n|Ecumenical Patriarch Joachim III of Constantinople\n|Serbian Orthodox Church\n|\n|-\n|25 April 1885\n|Ecumenical Patriarch Jochim IV of Constantinople\n|Romanian Orthodox Church\n|\n|}\n20th-century\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Granter\n!Recipient\n!Recognized by\n|-\n|13 November 1924\n|Ecumenical Patriarch Gregory VII of Constantinople\n|Polish Orthodox Church\n|\n|-\n|17 April 1937\n|Ecumenical Patriarch Benjamin I of Constantinople\n|Albanian Orthodox Church\n|\n|-\n|31 October 1943\n|Patriarch Sergius of Moscow\n|Georgian Orthodox Church\n|\n|-\n|1945\n|Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow\n|Bulgarian Orthodox Church\n|\n|-\n|9 December 1951\n|Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow\n|Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia\n|\n|-\n|10 April 1970\n|Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow\n|Orthodox Church in America\n|\n|}\n21st-century\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Granter\n!Recipient\n!Recognized By\n|-\n|5 May 2019\n|Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople\n|Orthodox Church of Ukraine\n|\n|-\n|5 June 2022\n|Patriarch Porfirije of Serbia\n|Macedonian Orthodox Church\n|\n|}\nReferences"
