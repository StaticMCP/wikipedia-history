      "text": "# United Kingdom Low Flying System\n\nThe United Kingdom Low Flying System (UKLFS) is the airspace across the United Kingdom in which low flying training is permitted. The system was established in 1979 and extends from ground level to 2000ft AGL. Flying is carried out from 0800 to 2300 during weekdays only. Military aircraft are also allowed to fly in Tactical Training Areas.\nAircraft are restricted to a cruising speed of 450 knots, and reheat (use of afterburner) is not permitted except for emergencies. Low flying aircraft should not enter any Air Traffic Zones, including Aerodrome Traffic Zones and Military Aerodrome Traffic Zone.\nHistory\nIt was introduced by the Air Force Board, and by Labour Under-Secretary of State for Air James Wellbeloved, who two years later defected to the SDP.  In 1990 the Defence Select Committee had proposed that low-flying be removed over two years.\nComplaints\nIn 1979 there were around 4,000 complaints about low flying, with £38,000 paid in compensation. In 1978 a USAF General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark had flown supersonic directly over a Welsh village, receiving many complaints. In 1981, a F-111 flew low over Finzean in Aberdeenshire; Captain Robert Vosburgh was disciplined.\nTactical Training Areas\n* LFA7(T), central Wales\n* LFA14(T), northern Scotland\n* LFA20(T), Anglo-Scottish border and west Northumberland\nSee also\n* Purple Corridor\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.vcm-photography.co.uk/gallerys/aviation_uk/uk_low_fly_system.html UKLFS]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/low-flying-in-your-area Low flying in the UK]\n*[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/656298/UK_Military_Low_Flying-withdrawn.pdf UK Military Low Flying - An Essential Skill]"
