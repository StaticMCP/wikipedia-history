It was hosted, for the third time since 1997, by Rosie O'Donnell, with special guest Nathan Lane.\nEligibility\nShows that opened on Broadway during the 1999–2000 season, before May 2, 2000, were eligible.\n;Original plays\n*Copenhagen\n*Dirty Blonde\n*The Green Bird\n*The Ride Down Mt.

Martin, and Megan Mullally.\nProduction numbers from musicals included Contact, Boyd Gaines and the Girl in the Yellow Dress, Deborah Yates; Kiss Me, Kate, \"Too Darn Hot\"; Jesus Christ Superstar, \"Superstar\" and \"Gethsemane\"; The Music Man, Craig Bierko in \"Seventy-Six Trombones\"; The Wild Party, medley from Mandy Patinkin, Eartha Kitt and Toni Collette; Swing!, medley from company and Ann Hampton Callaway and Laura Benanti; and ''James Joyce's The Dead'', \"Parnell's Plight.\"\nTen awards were presented prior to the main ceremony and were broadcast on Public Television in a show titled \"The First 10 Awards: Tonys 2000.\" The show had interviews and showed clips from the season's productions, and presented the awards: Direction (Play and Musical), Choreography, Original Score, Book of a Musical, Costume Design, Scenic Design, Orchestration, Lighting Design and Regional Theater.  Michael Blakemore is the only director to win Tony Awards as Best Director of a Play and Best Director of a Musical in the same year. He won this year for Copenhagen (play) and Kiss Me, Kate (musical).\nThe television ratings for this broadcast were 7.2, down from the 1999 Tony Award broadcast of 7.9. In prior years in which O'Donnell hosted, the program had ratings of 11.2 (1997) and 10.3 (1998).\nContact controversy\nThe winner of the award for Best Musical, Contact, raised controversy about what constitutes a musical, as it is a dance musical with no singing and minimal dialogue; and instead of original music, it uses pre-recorded music and songs. As a result of the controversy, a new category was created for the Tony Awards: Best Special Theatrical Event.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are in bold\n{| class=wikitable width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! width=\"50%\" | Best Play\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! width=\"50%\" | Best Musical\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Copenhagen – Michael Frayn'\n** Dirty Blonde – Claudia Shear\n** The Ride Down Mt.
