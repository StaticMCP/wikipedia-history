C. S. Kempff, the Captain of the Yard; and commissioned on 22 December 1919.\nAfter brief service with the Train of the Atlantic Fleet, Warbler was decommissioned on 16 June 1920 and simultaneously transferred, on loan, to the United States Shipping Board. The ship operated with a civilian crew under the aegis of Merritt, Chapman, and Scott, a New York-based salvage firm. On 13 September 1941, the Navy reclassified Warbler a salvage vessel and designated her ARS-11\nWorld War II operations\nDuring World War II, she continued to operate with a civilian crew under a contract with the Naval Salvage Service. She was based at the Merritt, Chapman, and Scott salvage depot at Key West, Florida, and worked primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, towing disabled ships; assisting stranded or grounded vessels; escorting coastwise convoys; and conducting salvage operations.\nEnd-of-War deactivation\nAfter the war ended, the U.S. Navy designated Warbler for disposal on 29 March 1946 and declared her surplus on 13 January 1947. She was struck from the Navy list on 10 June 1947.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/5203.html uboat.net - USS Warbler]"
