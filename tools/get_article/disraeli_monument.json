It is located on Tinker's Hill in the Hughenden Valley near High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire.\nIt was erected in June 1862 at a cost of £500; Lamb was paid £200 for his work, and a Mr. Thomas Coates had sold the land on which the monument stands to the Disraelis for £20. The monument stands in fields near Hughenden Manor, the D'Israelis' country house. Windsor Castle could be seen from the monument at the time of its erection.\nThe monument is 50&nbsp;ft in height and made from Bath stone.\nThe monument was commissioned by D'Israeli's daughter-in-law Mary Anne Disraeli, who was married to his eldest son, the politician and writer Benjamin Disraeli. The monument was secretly planned and erected by Mary Anne without her husband's knowledge. It was designed by architect Edward Buckton Lamb. The positive reception of the monument led to Lamb being hired to remodel Hughenden Manor for the Disraelis.\nIn a letter dated 21 August 1862 to Sarah Brydges Willyams, Disraeli described the new monument as \"both for design, execution & even material is one of the most beautiful things not only in the County of Buckingham, but in England!\". Disraeli repeated the sentiment in a letter to Lionel de Rothschild later that month.\nInscription\nOn the east face of the monument a panel is inscribed:\nThe panel on the north face is inscribed\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hughenden/trails/monument-walk-at-hughenden A guided walk to the monument from Hughenden Manor]"
