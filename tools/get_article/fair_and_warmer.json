It was first staged at the Eltinge Theatre in New York City on November 15, 1915, running for 377 performances, featuring Madge Kennedy, John Cumberland, Janet Beecher, Ralph Morgan, Hamilton Revelle, Olive May, Robert Fisher and Harry Lorraine. Staged by Robert Milton, it was well received by critics. It is a farce about a mild-mannered banker who becomes embroiled in an innocent scheme to rekindle the romance in his marriage using his best friend's wife.\nPlot\nFriends Laura Bartlett and Jack Wheeler enjoy going out partying, but their respective spouses, Billy Bartlett and Blanche Wheeler, do not. One evening when Laura and Jack are out together, Billy and Blanche decide to try partying themselves. The inexperienced drinkers mix a cocktail so potent that they pass out together after just one drink, leading their spouses to think they are having an affair. Blanche returns the next day to apologize, but Laura has already decided to leave Billy and is having the furniture removed. The misunderstanding is resolved by Tessie, the Barletts' maid.\nCast and characters\nThe characters and cast from the Broadway production are given below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Cast of the Broadway production\n! scope=\"col\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" | Broadway cast\n|-\n|Laura Wheeler ||Janet Beecher\n|-\n|Billy Bartlett ||John Cumberland\n|-\n|Harrigan ||Robert Fisher\n|-\n|Blanche Wheeler ||Madge Kennedy\n|-\n|Pete Mealy ||Harry Lorraine\n|-\n|Tessie ||Olive May\n|-\n|Jack Wheeler ||Ralph Morgan\n|-\n|Phillip Evans ||Hamilton Revelle\n|}\nReception\nThe reviewer for The New York Times praised the play as well-written and the acting of the Broadway cast, especially Kennedy and Cumberland.\nFilm adaptations\nIn 1919 the play was turned into an American silent film of the same title.\nThe 1937 German comedy The Model Husband with Heinz Rühmann was based on Hopwood's play and was followed up by West German and Swiss remakes in 1956 and 1959, respectively.\nA Swedish film version The Green Lift was made in 1944, another Swedish film version The Green Lift in 1952, a Danish film version  was made in 1961, and a Norwegian film version Den grønne heisen in 1981.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Fisher, James & Hardison Londre, Felicia.
