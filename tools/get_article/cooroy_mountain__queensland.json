It means the place where the Sun God came down to Dha (Earth). It is believed the mountain turned yellow once a year due to the flowering of an unknown tree. Most likely due to the endemic silky oak tree (Grevillea robusta'') which has glabrous yellowish orange flowers from around September to November.\nThe Kabi Kabi people are the traditional owners of the land. While the Kabi people and their language group are not extinct, many are no longer in the local area of Cooroy mountain as a result of having been moved out of the area as a result of government policies in the past.\nBetween 2008 and 2013, Cooroy Mountain (and the rest of the Shire of Noosa) was within Sunshine Coast Region, due to an enforced amalgamation of local government areas that was subsequently reversed.\nDemographics\nIn the , Cooroy Mountain had a population of 136 people.\nIn the , Cooroy Mountain had a population of 148 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Cooroy Mountain.
