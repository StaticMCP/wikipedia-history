It was governed by the Central Siberian Executive Committee. The republic fell as a result of the Czechoslovak mutiny  and the Battles of the Lower Udin Front and advances of the White forces on August 28, 1918 (dissolution of Central Siberia).\nThe capital was Irkutsk, where the Central Siberian Executive Committee, the Siberian Sovnarkom, and the All-Siberian Congresses of Soviets were held.\nFormation\nThe Siberian Soviet Republic was declared on February 28, 1918, at the  Second All-Siberian Congress of Soviets, amid ongoing conflicts regarding the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers. Opposing the treaty, Centrosibir exerted influence on the congress, resulting in the adoption of the following resolution:\nThe disobedience of the local government to Lenin's government was driven by fears of possible intervention by the Entente countries in Siberia. The local Soviet authorities adopted a course towards building autonomous statehood, establishing their own commissariats for foreign affairs, state property, and defense.\nHowever, resistance to the peace treaty led by Shumyatsky was overcome, and he resigned, volunteering to fight on the German front. Lenin, in turn, proposed \"limiting Siberia’s autonomy as an inseparable part of Russia.\" Appointed from Moscow, Yakovlev dissolved the commissariats, replacing them with executive departments, and abolished the commissariats for foreign affairs and state property.\nThe term \"Siberian Soviet Republic\" continued to be used in everyday speech, and Central Siberia and the Siberian Soviet People's Commissariat continued to exist, governing Siberia autonomously. However, the main directions of policy were now determined by Moscow. Central Siberia publicly rejected accusations of \"Soviet regionalism\", \"separatism\", and \"independence\", emphasizing the necessity of universal unity against \"global imperialism.\"\nOn April 5, 1918, a resolution was passed protesting the intervention, announcing the introduction of martial law in Siberia and the establishment of the Siberian Military Revolutionary Headquarters. The Siberian Military Commissariat was formed, uniting the Omsk, Irkutsk, and Amur military districts under the leadership of ensign P. N. Polovnikov, with former General A. A. Taube appointed Chief of Staff. In mid-April, officer training courses were opened, and internationalist detachments began to be formed. In April-May, the Siberian Cheka was created, headed by Ivan Semyonovich Postolovsky.\nIn the spring of 1918, the Transbaikal (Daurian) Front was created, whose forces, led by Sergey Georgievich Lazo, fought against the troops of Ataman Semenov. On May 8, a decree from Central Siberia declared Semenov an \"enemy of the people\" and outside the law.\nDissolution\nInitially, negotiations were held with the Czechoslovak Corps and all measures were taken to speed up its movement eastward. However, on May 26 1918, Centrosibir decided to disarm the Czechoslovak trains arriving at the station of Innokentievskaya. At 3 PM, fighting broke out at the Irkutsk station between Czechoslovak legionaries and the Red Army and internationalist detachments. As a result of the clashes, 50 people were killed. After negotiations, the enemy laid down their arms and vacated the railway station. Fighting also took place near the railway bridge over the Irkut River. On May 27, Central Siberia's delegation signed a peace treaty with the White Czechs. Central Siberia decided to create the Siberian Supreme Command to lead military operations.\nBy June 13, Centrosibir confirmed that Nizhneudinsk had fallen, and the entire line from there to Kansk was in the hands of the Czechs. On June 24, a treaty was concluded for peaceful negotiations with the Czechs, but it was later rejected, and the fighting continued. During this period, the forces of Central Siberia were weakened by the dispatch of a detachment to Yakutsk to establish Soviet power there.\nOn July 1, the Presidium of Centrosibir appealed to the people of Irkutsk to disregard rumors of the retreat of all Soviet organizations from the city. On July 11, Soviet troops left Irkutsk, and Central Siberia evacuated to Verkhneudinsk. After the retreat from Irkutsk, battles continued on the Baikal Front and the Transbaikal Front. The troops' morale was unstable, discipline was weak, and the units acted on their own initiative without a unified plan, as described by front commander P. K. Golikov in his initial orders.\nUnable to establish cooperation with the Far Eastern Soviet People's Commissariat, Central Siberia appealed to the population for support. On August 9 1918, Centrosibir issued a statement urging continued resistance and addressing the \"separatism\" (reluctance to cooperate) of the Far Eastern Sovnarkom. It also recommended the creation of a unified military body to coordinate operations on three fronts. On August 16, evacuation to Chita began, and Verkhneudinsk fell on August 20.\nOn August 21, the Siberian People's Commissariat was re-established. In Chita, a final attempt was made to unite the Soviets and continue the struggle, but Chita was also abandoned by Soviet forces on August 26. On August 28, a conference of leading party, Soviet, and military officials was held at Uralga station. The conference decided to dissolve the Siberian People's Commissariat, and a temporary VRC was formed, tasked with supplying internationalist forces retreating to the forests and transitioning to a struggle through both legal and illegal means.\nArmed forces\nThe armed forces of the Siberian Soviet Republic, established under the  Central Executive Committee of Siberian Soviets in early 1918, were primarily composed of irregular partisan and cavalry units loyal to the Bolshevik cause during the initial phases of the Russian Civil War. These forces played a critical role in defending Soviet control in eastern Siberia against White counter-revolutionary elements, particularly in the Transbaikal and Irkutsk regions. Under the command of figures like Nestor Kalandarishvili, the military emphasized mobile guerrilla tactics suited to Siberia’s vast terrain, drawing recruits from local miners, anarchists, and international volunteers.\nFormation and size\nThe Siberian Soviet armed forces were formalized in February 1918 when Centrosibir appointed Nestor Kalandarishvili as commander-in-chief of its military units. The core formation was the 1st Irkutsk Separate Cavalry Division of Communist-Anarchists, initially organized from anarchist militants, Cheremkhovo miners, and foreign volunteers in Irkutsk. By April 1918, the division had grown to approximately 500 sabers and was deployed to the Transbaikal front. Overall military strength remained modest, with estimates suggesting 800 to 1,500 personnel by September 1918 during retreats, reflecting the challenges of recruitment in a remote and contested region. These units were supplemented by local Red Guard detachments and worker militias, but lacked the heavy artillery or infantry divisions typical of larger fronts.\nEngagements\nSiberian Soviet forces saw their first major action in spring 1918 on the Transbaikal front, where Kalandarishvili’s cavalry clashed with White movement forces amid the broader Allied intervention and Czech Legion uprising. The most significant engagement occurred in September 1918 near the Dzhida River, where the division confronted the Baikal Cossacks under Grigory Semyonov. Despite initial successes in hit-and-run raids, the Soviets suffered a decisive defeat, forcing a retreat into Mongolia before regrouping in Buryatia for continued guerrilla operations over the Sayan Mountains. These actions disrupted White supply lines but highlighted the numerical inferiority of Soviet forces against better-equipped adversaries.\nOrganization and advancements\nIn July 1918, as part of broader Red Army centralization efforts, Centrosibir reorganized Kalandarishvili’s division into the 3rd Soviet Verkhneudinsk Division, integrating it into the 2nd Siberian Rifle Corps. This marked a key advancement, shifting from purely anarchist-led irregulars to a more structured socialist military framework, with improved command hierarchies and access to Bolshevik supplies. Tactical innovations included the emphasis on cavalry mobility for Siberia’s harsh winters and expansive steppes, enabling effective partisan warfare that influenced later Soviet strategies in the Far East. By late 1918, these reforms facilitated coordination with central Red Army commands, though the republic’s dissolution limited further developments.\nReferences\n* Boryev, I. A.
