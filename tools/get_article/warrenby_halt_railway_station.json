It was built to serve the village of Warrenby near Redcar, England, and the nearby Dorman Long steelworks. It consisted of wooden platforms and brick shelters and was gas-lit.\nIn 1978, the railway was diverted to allow for the building of the Redcar steelworks, leaving Warrenby bypassed. A new station, Redcar British Steel, opened on the deviated line to take its place.\nOne of Warrenby Halt's platforms survives at Newton Dale Halt on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\nLine closed, station open|next=Line and station closed|route=London and North Eastern RailwayTees Valley Line|col= }}"
