Her 2008 PhD dissertation at Harvard University was titled The regulation of individual autonomy in medical decision-making. King held the Bion M. Gregory Chair of Business Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law. King's appointment to the law faculty at the University of Auckland was announced in early 2020, but she worked remotely from taking up the position in July until early the following year, due to the need to go through quarantine for COVID 19.\nKing's research covers the interaction of law and medicine, and how health policy can influence people's lives. She is interested in access and equity issues, including healthcare costs and pricing transparency, and has researched medical decision-making and genetic testing. She has commented on how the wording of New Zealand law around advertising of therapeutics in the Therapeutic Products Bill would need to be precise to avoid preventing patients from fundraising for medicines.\nKing has testified before members of the US House of Representatives, and served on a Technical Expertise Panel for the US Department of Health and Human Services. She has been a board member and President of the Board of the American Society of Law, Medicine, and Ethics.\nSelected works\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nejm.org/do/10.1056/NEJMdo007016/full/ Interview with Prof. Jaime King on the functions of antitrust law and the effects of health care consolidation on prices, quality of care, and access to care], podcast episode by Stephen Morrissey, executive editor of New England Journal of Medicine"
