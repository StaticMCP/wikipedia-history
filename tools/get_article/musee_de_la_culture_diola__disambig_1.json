It is located among tall kapok trees between Elinkine and Oussouye. A guide at the museum is there to explain some of the museum's objects.\nCollections\nThe collections include fetishes, baskets used as fish traps, gris-gris worn as amulets as protection against injury, hoops for climbing palm trees, pestle and mortar for making palm wine, and shields made of hippopotamus hide. There are also African musical instruments.\nAmong animists, an individual's life is linked to that of one or more protective fetishes. The museum exhibits four such fetishes, essential to the social organisation of the Diola community.\nFile:Musée de la Culture Diola (Mlomp) - Impluvium.jpg|Impluvium\nFile:Musée de la Culture Diola (Mlomp) - Outils et ustensiles de production.jpg|Tools for production\nFile:Musée de la Culture Diola (Mlomp) - Carapace de tortue de mer et la peau d'hippopotame.jpg|Sea turtle shell and hippopotamus skin\nFile:Mlomp-MuséeDiola7.JPG|Fetish\nSee also\n* List of museums in Senegal\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
