The Ismahayana Landak Palace has a relatively long historical chronicle, although written sources that prove the history of this kingdom can be said to be very limited. Similarly, the source of the folk tales that emerged in Ngabang, West Kalimantan, where this kingdom is located.\nHowever, archaeological evidence in the form of royal palace buildings (keraton) and royal attributes can still be seen today and also the book Indoek Lontar Keradjaan Landak written by Gusti Soeloeng Lelanang (19th king) in 1942, In fact, it is sufficient to prove the long journey of this kingdom, which is broadly divided into two phases, namely the Hindu phase and the Islamic phase, which began in 1275.\nHistory\nHistorians believe, based on local stories, that the founder of the Landak Kingdom was a noble from the Singasari Kingdom. The nobleman's real name is unknown. The group led by this nobleman were probably members of the troops sent by Kertanegara on the expedition of Pamalayu which did not return to Java, when the turmoil of the change of Singasari into Majapahit occurred, which then diverted the destination towards Tanjungpura. He then landed in Ketapang, then followed the Kapuas River to the Landak River and landed in Kuala Mandor.\nIn another version, this group stopped temporarily in Padang Tikar before following the Tenganap River and landing in Sekilap (now known as Secepat). This place later became known as Anggrat Bator or Ningrat Batur. According to local stories, he then gained the trust and followers of the local people by distributing salt. Then he founded the Landak kingdom in the area and took the title \"Ratu Sang Nata Pulang Pali\" and became the founder of the Ismahayana dynasty.\nPeriod of government\nThe period of this kingdom's reign is divided into four periods of two phases, namely:\n* Hindu phase\n** Landak Kingdom in Ningrat Batur (1292–1472)\n* Islamic phase\n** Landak Kingdom in Mungguk Ayu (1472–1703)\n** Landak Kingdom in Bandong (1703–1768)\n** Landak Kingdom in Ngabang (1768–1962)\nTerritory areas\nThe territory of the Landak Kingdom roughly covered the entire present-day Landak Regency, West Kalimantan. In the first three periods, geographically the area controlled by this kingdom included the area along the Landak River and the small rivers that were branches of it. This river, which is a tributary of the Kapuas River, is approximately 390&nbsp;km long. In its later development, the scope of Landak's territory is expanding to include inland areas. If imagine the current conditions, the boundaries of the Landak Kingdom are approximately similar to the Landak Regency which borders directly with Sanggau Regency to the east, Mempawah Regency on the west side, Bengkayang Regency on the north, and the south by Ketapang Regency.\nIt is suspected that the main reason the ancestors of the Landak Kingdom chose the banks of the Landak River as a place to settle was because along this river has extraordinary natural wealth potential, namely diamond and gold. Usman (2007) said that the largest diamond ever found and owned by the Landak Kingdom was called the \"Palladium Intan Kubi\" (intan ubi) weighing 367 carats. After the discovery, the diamond was named the \"Intan Danau Raja\". This diamond was discovered when Raden Nata Tua Pangeran Sanca Nata Kusuma Tua (1714–1764) reigned as the 19th king of Landak in Bandong. Furthermore, as a kingdom, Landak does not close itself off from the outside world. This kingdom was actually active in establishing relations with other kingdoms around West Kalimantan. The relationships that were built were kinship relationships, such as with the Sambas Sultanate, Mempawah Kingdom, Sanggau Kingdom, Matan Kingdom, and Tayan Kingdom.\nList of rulers\nThe lineage of the rulers of the Landak Kingdom is divided into four periods of rule and two religious phases, Hinduism and Islam. The four periods referred to are based on the existence of the Landak Royal Palace, which is recorded as having occupied four different locations.\nHindu phase\n* Landak Kingdom in Ningrat Batur (1292–1472)\n# Ratu Sang Nata Pulang Pali I\n# Ratu Sang Nata Pulang Pali II\n# Ratu Sang Nata Pulang Pali III\n# Ratu Sang Nata Pulang Pali IV\n# Ratu Sang Nata Pulang Pali V\n# Ratu Sang Nata Pulang Pali VI\n# Ratu Sang Nata Pulang Pali VII\nIslamic phase\n* Landak Kingdom in Mungguk Ayu (1472–1703)\n# Raden Iswaramahayan Raja Adipati Karang Tanjung Tua atau Raden Abdul Kahar (1472–1542) (Islam masuk pada periode ini di Kerajaan Landak)\n# Raden Pati Karang Raja Adipati Karang Tanjung Muda (1542–1584)\n# Raden Cili (Tjili) Pahang Tua Raja Adipati Karang Sari Tua (1584–1614)\n# Raden Karang Tedung Tua (viceroy) Raja Adipati Karang Tedung Tua (1614–1644)\n# Raden Cili (Tjili) Pahang Muda Raja Adipati Karang Sari Muda (1644–1653)\n# Raden Karang Tedung Muda (viceroy) Raja Adipati Karang Tedung Muda (1679–1689)\n# Raden Mangku Tua (viceroy) Raja Mangku Bumi Tua (1679–1689)\n# Raden Kusuma Agung Tua (1689–1693)\n# Raden Mangku Muda (viceroy) Pangeran Mangku Bumi Muda (1693–1703)\n* Landak Kingdom in Bandong (1703–1768)\n# Raden Kusuma Agung Muda (1703–1709)\n# Raden Purba Kusuma (viceroy) Pangeran Purba Kusuma (1709–1714)\n# Raden Nata Tua Pangeran Sanca Nata Kusuma Tua (1714–1764)\n# Raden Anom Jaya Kusuma (viceroy) Pangeran Anom Jaya Kusuma (1764–1768)\n* Landak Kingdom in Ngabang (1768–present; since 1962 only a titular title without territorial and governmental powers), with the head of state holding the title \"paduka panembahan\" and the head of government has the title of \"His Royal Highness\"\n# Raden Nata Muda Pangeran Sanca Nata Kusuma (1768–1798)\n# Raden Bagus Nata Kusuma (viceroy) Ratu Bagus Nata Kusuma (1798–1802)\n# Gusti Husin (viceroy) Gusti Husin Suta Wijaya (1802–1807)\n# Panembahan Gusti Muhammad Aliuddin (1807–1833)\n# Haji Gusti Ismail (deputy worshipper) Pangeran Mangkubumi Haji Gusti Ismail (1833–1835)\n# Panembahan Gusti Mahmud Akamuddin (1835–1838)\n# Ya Mochtar Unus (deputy worshipper) Pangeran Temenggung Kusuma (1838–1843)\n# Panembahan Gusti Muhammad Amaruddin Ratu Bagus Adi Muhammad Kusuma (1843–1868)\n# Gusti Doha (deputy worshipper) (1868–1872)\n# Panembahan Gusti Abdulmajid Kusuma Adiningrat (1872–1875)\n# Haji Gusti Andut Muhammad Tabri (wakil panembahan) Pangeran Wira Nata Kusuma (1875–1890)\n# Gusti Ahmad (wakil panembahan) Pangeran Mangkubumi Gusti Ahmad (1890–1895)\n# Panembahan Gusti Abdulazis Kusuma Akamuddin (1895–1899)\n# Gusti Bujang Isman Tajuddin (deputy worshipper) Pangeran Mangkubumi Gusti Bujang (1899–1922)\n# Panembahan Gusti Abdul Hamid (1922–1943)\n# H.
