The London architects work primarily in education, and have also worked in the heritage, community and health sectors.\nIn 2010 the practice produced a monograph detailing their work to date; van Heyningen and Haward – Buildings and Projects. The book was published by Right Angle Publishing and edited by Ian Latham. As well as giving an overview of the projects undertaken by the practice from inception until publication, it also includes essays by Trevor Garnham and contributions by Ken Powell and Patrick Lynch. The launch party for the book was held at Latymer Upper School, a long-standing client of the practice.\nSelected projects\n* Quintin Kynaston Community Academy (now Harris Academy St John's Wood), St
