Dillon (brother)\n}}\nEdward Dillon ( or 1879 or 1882&ndash; July 11, 1933) was an American actor, director and screenwriter of the silent era.\nEarly and personal life\nDillon was born in 1872, 1873, 1879 or 1882, in New York City. His brother John T. Dillon was also an actor. He married Franc Newman in October 1914, and they divorced sometime before 1930. Newman kept her married name, Dillon. She attended his funeral in 1933, and afterward listed herself as a widow rather than divorced.\nCareer\nDillon's work on Broadway included acting in Prince Otto (1900), Francesca da Rimini (1901), The Taming of the Shrew (1905), and The Ranger (1907). He left the stage to begin acting in films in 1908, working under D. W. Griffith at Biograph. He performed in more than 320 films between 1905 and 1932 and also directed 134 productions between 1913 and 1926. He was Mary Pickford's first leading man, and he was instrumental in Fay Tincher's developing into a star. He was known as an \"ace\" director for D. W. Griffith. In 1915 he was described as a director for Komic Pictures Company when a fire devastated his home.\nDillon died on July 11, 1933, at the age of 60 in Hollywood, California from a heart attack.\nSelected filmography\nActor\n* The Invisible Fluid (1908, Short) - Messenger\n* ''Bobby's Kodak (1908, Short) - Father\n* When Knights Were Bold (1908) *short\n* The Fight for Freedom (1908, Short) - Man in Bar / Member of the Posse\n* The Kentuckian (1908, Short) - Ward Fatherly\n* Monday Morning in a Coney Island Police Court (1908, Short)\n* Where the Breakers Roar (1908, Short) - Policeman\n* After Many Years (1908, Short)\n* The Feud and the Turkey (1908, Short)\n* The Reckoning (1908, Short)\n* The Welcome Burglar (1909, Short)\n* The Brahma Diamond (1909, Short)\n* In the Border States (1910, Short) - Confederate Soldier (uncredited)\n* A Flash of Light (1910, Short) - At First Party\n* The Modern Prodigal (1910, Short) - Guard\n* The Lucky Toothache (1910, Short) - One of the Boys\n* The Fugitive (1910, Short) - John - the Confederate Son\n* A Mohawk's Way (1910, Short) - Friend\n* What Shall We Do with Our Old?
