The game was released on February 11, 2025, for Windows, macOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It was also released on June 5, 2025 for Nintendo Switch 2.\nSimilar to previous installments, the goal for the player is to develop a civilization from an early settlement through many in-game millennia to become a world power and achieve one of several victory conditions, such as through military domination, technological superiority, economic prowess, or cultural influence over the other human and computer-controlled opponents. Players do this by exploring the world, founding new cities, building city improvements, deploying military troops to attack and defend themselves from others, researching new technologies and civics advancements, developing an influential culture, and engaging in trade and negotiations with other world leaders. A significant change from previous iterations of the game was the introduction of an ages system to break up gameplay with different civilizations for each era.\nReception to the game was mixed, with players and critics praising its visuals, sounds, and diplomacy system overhaul, but criticizing its user interface and in some cases the ages system.\nGameplay\nCivilization VII is a 4X turn-based strategy game. The player oversees the growth of a human civilization from its earliest settlements to advanced society. The player uses various military and civilian units to explore the map, grow their civilization through the founding of additional settlements, advance their civilization's culture and technology, utilize surrounding resources, and contend or collaborate with competing civilizations. Multiple victory conditions are available to the player, including military, scientific, cultural, and economic avenues.\nCivilization VII allows the player to select leaders and civilizations independently, with civilizations favoring leaders with certain attributes. The criteria for what constitutes a \"leader\" have also been updated, now including philosophers, religious figures, and scientists who were not heads of state. The historical era system is simplified into the antiquity, exploration, and modern ages, in comparison to the further divisions implemented by the game's predecessors. During all ages, independent factions—deliberately labeled to prevent perceived negative connotations of the term \"barbarian\" used in previous games in the series—emerge. Depending on how the player chooses to interact with them, these may evolve to become city states.  Towards the end of the antiquity and exploration ages, players are faced with \"crisis events\" which simulate societal disruption and civilization downfall. Upon the conclusion of these ages, the player must choose a new civilization with which to begin the next age.\nDevelopment\nIn February 2023, Firaxis Games announced it was developing a sequel to Civilization VI (2016). PCGamesN reported in August 2021 that Firaxis had posted a job opening for a narrative lead for the game. Gwendoline Christie narrates the game's voiceovers.\nFiraxis Games collaborated with members of the Shawnee Tribe, including Shawnee chief Benjamin Barnes, to create a historically accurate depiction of Tecumseh in the game. Tecumseh is voiced by Dean Dillon, a Shawnee voice actor. As part of the partnership between Firaxis Games and the Shawnee Tribe, Firaxis and 2K donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to programs working to revitalize the Shawnee language.\nCivilization VIIs opening cinematic \"Rediscover Hope\" and theme song \"Live Gloriously\" were revealed at the 2024 Game Awards. \"Live Gloriously\" is written by American composer Christopher Tin, who also composed the Grammy Award-winning song \"Baba Yetu\", the main theme of Civilization IV, as well as Civilization VI's main theme \"Sogno di Volare\". The song's lyrics are derived from four ancient poems—the Iliad, Beowulf, Popol Vuh, and Ramayana—which are sung in their languages as originally written. The game's original score was composed, arranged, and produced by Geoff Knorr and Roland Rizzo. It features performances by ensembles and musicians from around the world, including the FILMharmonic Orchestra Prague, Mongolian State Morin Khuur Ensemble, Ensemble I Fedeli, Southern Pine Drum Group, Wong Pleng Khmer, among many soloists.\nRelease\nCivilization VII was announced at the Summer Game Fest on June 7, 2024. 2K previously announced it would appear at Summer Game Fest in May to reveal the \"next iteration in one of its biggest and most beloved franchises\". Hours before the presentation, the game was unintentionally announced on 2K's website. Civilization VII was released for Windows, macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Steam Deck, and Xbox Series X/S on February 11, 2025. It was also released for the Nintendo Switch 2 as a launch title on June 5, 2025.\nA virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR) version of Civilization VII was released on April 9, 2025, for the Meta Quest 3 and 3S. This version was developed by PlaySide Studios.\nDue to feedback during the early access stage, on February 10, 2025, Firaxis Games released Patch 1.0.1 for Civilization VII, which included improvements to the user interface and tooltips. The update also introduced minor rebalancing for certain civilizations, ensuring a more streamlined gameplay experience.\nReception\n: 79/100\n| OC = 76% recommend\n| Destruct = 9/10\n| DT = 4/5\n| EuroG = 2/5\n| GSpot = 8/10\n| GRadar = 4/5\n| IGN = 7/10\n| PCGN = 7/10\n| SN = 9/10\n| TR = 4/5\n| TG = 5/5\n| VGC = 5/5\n| VG247 = 4/5\n}}\nCivilization VII received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to the review aggregator website Metacritic. OpenCritic determined that 76% of critics recommended the game.\nThe game's visuals and sounds and diplomacy system overhaul were mostly praised. However, many critics found the UI lacking, the mechanics oversimplified, and the three ages system, coupled with the ability to change civilizations, divisive. Other points of criticism included the perceived premature end of the technology tree and the overreliance on DLC to fix or add lacking features.\nPlayer reviews were less positive, with Civilization VII receiving Mixed reviews on Steam from advanced access players shortly before its full release. Months after the game's release, Civilization VII maintained a Mixed rating on Steam, with only 48% of players recommending the game, with the most heavy criticism being aimed at the abruptness of the ages system and the immersion breaking of changing Civilizations.\nCivilization VII was nominated for \"Best Sim/Strategy Game\" at The Game Awards 2025.\nSales\nCivilization VII reached more than 80,000 concurrent players on Steam during its launch week. However, the two previous entries of the series surpassed Civilization VII in active players in April 2025. In May 2025, concurrent players for the game dropped below 5,000 for the first time. In August 2025, Take-Two Interactive's CEO Strauss Zelnick described the game's initial sales as \"slow\" but expressed optimism about its long-term sales potential.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*"
