They are members of the Capital Region Junior Hockey League (CRJHL). The franchise was founded in 1963.\nThe team was a member of the Keystone Junior Hockey League until 2018. For the 2018–19 season the Warriors were one of five teams that departed the Keystone Junior Hockey League and established the Capital Region Junior Hockey League.\nThe Warriors have six league championships to their credit, first winning the KJHL title in 1995. The team first medaled at the Keystone Cup in 1997 when they claimed silver after losing to host Grenfell Storm in the championship game.\nAs KJHL champion, the Warriors traveled to Thunder Bay in 2009 for the Keystone Cup. They finished the round robin with one win in five games, failing to qualify for the medal round.\nSt. Malo hosted the Keystone Cup in 2013, losing all five round robin games.\nThe Warriors returned to the Keystone in 2018 as playoff runner-up along with the champion Peguis Juniors in a border battle with the Lakehead Junior Hockey League champion and runner up. They would win one of three games and did not qualify for the playoff round.\nSt. Malo Warriors claimed their first CRJHL title in 2024 defeating the Beausejour Comets in six games. After dropping the first two games of the series, the Warriors won four straight games to win their first league championship in 15 years.\nSeason-by-season records\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, &nbsp; PCT = Winning Percentage\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\n|- style=\"color: white; font-weight:bold; background-color:#000000;\"\n| Season || GP || W || L || T || OTL || Pts || GF || GA || PCT || Finish || Playoffs\n|-\n| 2004–05 || 36 || 24 || 11 || 1 || 0 || 49 || 213 || 110 || .681 || 2nd ||align=left| &nbsp;\n|-\n| 2005–06 || 36 || 12 || 23 || 0 || 1 || 25 ||—||—|| .347 || 7th ||align=left| &nbsp;\n|-\n| 2006–07 || 40 || 20 || 19 || 0 || 1 || 41 || 211 || 207 || .512 || 4th ||align=left| &nbsp;\n|-\n| 2007–08 || 40 || 28 || 11 || 0 || 1 || 57 || 260 || 162 || .713 || 1st ||align=left| KJHL finalists\n|-\n| 2008–09 || 36 || 22 || 10 || 0 || 4 || 48 || 217 || 149 || .667 || 4th ||align=left|KJHL ChampionsKeystone Cup: 5th (1–4–0)\n|-\n| 2009–10 || 32 || 19 || 9 || 0 || 4 || 42 || 186 || 112 || .656 || 4th ||align=left| &nbsp;\n|-\n| 2010–11 || 32 || 18 || 13 || 0 || 1 || 37 || 176 || 115 || .578 || 6th ||align=left| &nbsp;\n|-\n| 2011–12 || 36 || 8 || 24 || 0 || 4 || 20 || 112 || 192 || .278 || 7th ||align=left| &nbsp;\n|-\n| 2012–13 || 36 || 22 || 12 || 0 || 2 || 46 || 207 || 153 || .639 || 4th||align=left| Lost semi-finals\n|-\n| 2013–14 || 34 || 14 || 17 || 1 || 2 || 31 || 133 || 154 || .456 || 3rd of 4, South5th of 8, KJHL ||align=left| Lost div. semi-finals\n|-\n| 2014–15 || 32 || 15 || 16 || 0 || 1 || 31 || 158 || 155 || .484 || 6th ||align=left| Won quarter-finals, 3–2 (Ice Dawgs)Lost semi-finals, 0–4 (Fishermen)\n|-\n| 2015–16 || 34 || 21 || 10 || 0 || 3 || 45 || 162 || 128 || .662 || 2nd of 5, South4th of 10, KJHL ||align=left| Won div. semi-finals, 3–2(Falcons)Lost div. finals, 2–4 (Fishermen)\n|-\n| 2016–17 || 34 || 24 || 9 || 0 || 1 || 49 || 233 || 137 || .721 || 1st of 4, South1st of 10, KJHL ||align=left| Won quarter-finals, 3–0 (Falcons)Lost semi-finals, 3–4 (Juniors)\n|-\n| 2017–18 || 34 || 16 || 13 || 0 || 5 || 37 || 149 || 125 || .544 || 3rd of 4, South6th of 10, KJHL ||align=left| Won quarter-finals, 3–1 (Storm)Won semi-finals, 4–3 (Fishermen)Lost league finals, 1–4 (Juniors)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\n|- align=\"center\"  bgcolor=\"gold\"  style=\"color:black\"\n|colspan=13\t|CAPITAL REGION JUNIOR HOCKEY LEAGUE\n|-\n!
