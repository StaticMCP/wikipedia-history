The act was first introduced in the House of Representatives in 2004 () and passed the house in 2005.  The bill was reintroduced in March 2007 to further prosecute makers of spyware.\nHistory\nOn June 23, 2004, Representatives Bob Goodlatte, Zoe Lofgren, and Lamar S. Smith introduced the Internet Spyware Prevention Act as an amendment to Title 18 of the United States Code.\nCriticisms\nMembers of the Interactive Advertising Bureau claim that the provisions of the act would prohibit all but one form of data collection on computers, cookies.  They say that advanced programs (involving JavaScript) in the future that utilize data collection would be criminalized under this act.\nSee also\n* Spyware\n* United States Congress\nReferences\nExternal links\n#[https://web.archive.org/web/20041009190904/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:H.R.4661: The Library of Congress Search on HR 4661]"
