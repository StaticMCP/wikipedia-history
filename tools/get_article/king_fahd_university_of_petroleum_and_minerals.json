The university ranks 2nd and 8th globally in petroleum and mineral & mining engineering according to the QS subject rankings, respectively. As of 2024, the university has been ranked 5th globally by the National Academy of Inventors (NAI), first globally in the Student Unmanned Aerial Systems Ranking (SUAS), and first in the Middle East & North Africa (MENA) region according to the QS Ranking.  According to the NAI, KFUPM has consecutively held the record of the highest STEM patent-per-capita rate in the world since 2023.\nHistory\nKFUPM is a premier university in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and North Africa regions. KFUPM was established on September 23, 1963, by a Saudi royal decree as the College of Petroleum and Minerals, to provide high-level education in the academic fields of petroleum and minerals, two of the most valuable natural resources in Saudi Arabia.\nThe first students were admitted on September 23, 1964, when 67 young men enrolled in what was then named the College of Petroleum and Minerals (CPM). The original campus was designed by CRS Design Associates, architects and engineers of Houston, Texas. The college was elevated to university status in 1975 when it expanded its academic offerings in science, engineering, technology, business, and management. In 1984 the Program of Industrial and Systems Engineering was first introduced. The university was renamed after King Fahd in 1986. Since that time, enrollment has grown to over 10,000 students by the 2021 academic year and has graduated more than 39,000 students since its inception.\nIn 2019 the university put in place a transformation plan whose primary goal was to support the transformation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from a natural resource monetizing economy primarily focused on oil and gas resources, into a diversified knowledge economy.\nPart of this transformation plan presents an important milestone in the history of the university with the inclusion of female students in the engineering and technical academic programs. In 2019 male and female students were equally accepted into new postgraduate programs for the first time in the history of the university, and in 2021 admissions started for female students at the undergraduate level on a merit basis. The university hopes this step will help create diversity throughout engineering fields, and other sectors in the Kingdom.\nAcademics\nAcademic programs\nKFUPM degree offerings include Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, Master of Engineering, Master of Business Administration, and Doctor of Philosophy.\nThe university's academic programs are focused on engineering, sciences, computer sciences, business, and management, and are accredited by international bodies such as ABET, AACSB, as well as the national accrediting body NCAAA.\nSince 2020, the university has introduced new aspects to the academic programs through undergraduate concentrations (CX) and professional masters (MX). Recently there were 38 undergraduate concentrations (CX) introduced, along with 32 one-year master's degrees, and 20 interdisciplinary research centers.\nInnovative learning\nDammam No. 7 on March 4, 1938, near where KFUPM would later be built\nThe 35 undergraduate degrees were revised to include the study of modern programming languages, data science, big data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, business, and entrepreneurship. Every discipline starts with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and then branches into more specific fields.\nAdditionally, KFUPM has launched an effort to migrate some of its courses into other instructional methods, such as inquiry-based learning (IBL), where research on the topics is encouraged to enhance the class time with discussions, debates, and questions and answers.\nKFUPM's 38 undergraduate concentrations (CX) allow students to add a concentration in an area beyond their major. A few examples of these concentrations are Hydrogen Mobility, Renewable Energy and Energy Storage, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Business Analytics, Robotics and Autonomous Systems.\nKFUPM offers 32 one-year professional master's degrees (MX) in several fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Supply Chain Management, Quantum Computing, Smart and Sustainable Cities.\nAdmissions\nKFUPM is a merit-based admissions academic institution. With an acceptance rate of 4% (2023), it is considered to be one of the most coveted universities in Saudi Arabia, recruiting roughly the top 2% of the national talent based on admission criteria that include performance on the nationwide aptitude tests to ensure the acceptance of the most promising students.\nThe university has accelerated the admission process of female students since 2019 as both male and female students were equally accepted into the new master's degree programs for the first time in the university's history. Starting from 2021, KFUPM is opening admissions for female students at the undergraduate level for the 2021/2022 academic year, marking an important milestone in the university's history since until then it was an institution exclusively open to male students.\nKFUPM is improving the quality of the student intake by attracting the most outstanding high school graduates by introducing an early admissions system and accepting winners in international scientific Olympiad competitions. The progression of students in the first year has been accelerated by developing programs to bypass the preparatory year (SkipPrep).\nRankings\n| QS_W = 67 | QS_W_year = 2026| QS_W_ref =\n| THE_W = =176  |THE_W_year = 2025| THE_W_ref =\n| USNWR_W = =400 | USNWR_W_year = 2023 | USNWR_W_ref =| QS_Arab = 1 | QS_Arab_year = 2024 | QS_Arab_ref =\n| USNWR_Asia = 77 | USNWR_Asia_year = 2022 | USNWR_Asia_ref =\n| USNWR_Saudi_Arabia = 77 | USNWR_Saudi_Arabia_year = 2022 | USNWR_Saudi_Arabia_ref =\n}}\nKFUPM was named the top university in the Arab Region as per the QS University Rankings for 2015 and 2016. In 2022 it was ranked the third university in the region.\nSince the KFUPM transformation phase started in 2019, the university's rankings have seen a steady rise. According to the QS World University Rankings, KFUPM is placed among the top 200 universities in the world at the 163rd position.\nAccreditation\nAll programs of the engineering colleges were evaluated for \"Substantial-Equivalency\" recognition by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). They were found substantially equivalent to similar accredited programs in the United States. All Business & Management related programs offered by KFUPM Business School (including its flagship Master of Business Administration) are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). KFUPM is a member of AACSB since 1975 and it is among the first few schools outside the US to get this prestigious recognition. KFUPM is also accredited by the national accrediting body NCAAA.\nOrganization\nColleges\nKFUPM undergraduate and graduate programs are divided into seven colleges. As part of the university's recent transformational initiatives, all colleges recently underwent a complete restructuring to encourage collaboration among disciplines, and encourage cross-discipline research.\n*College of Engineering and Physics\n*College of Computing and Mathematics\n*College of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences\n*College of Chemicals and Materials\n*College of Design and Built Environment\n*KFUPM Business School\n*College of General Studies\nIn addition, Dammam Community College is under the auspices of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals as a fully approved academic entity by the Minister of Higher Education.\nLeadership\nThe current president of KFUPM is Muhammad M.
