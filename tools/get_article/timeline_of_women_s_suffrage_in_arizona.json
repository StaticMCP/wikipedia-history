      "text": "# Timeline of women's suffrage in Arizona\n\nThis is a '''timeline of women's suffrage in Arizona'''. The first women's suffrage bill was brought forward in the Arizona Territorial legislature in 1883, but it did not pass. Suffragists worked to influence the Territorial Constitutional Convention in 1891 but lost by only three votes. That year, the Arizona Suffrage Association was formed. In 1897, taxpaying women gained the right to vote in school board elections. Suffragists from both Arizona and around the country continued to lobby the territorial legislature and organize women's suffrage groups. In 1903, a women's suffrage bill passed, but it was vetoed by the governor. In 1910, suffragists worked to influence the Arizona State Constitutional Convention, but were again unsuccessful. When Arizona became a state on February 14, 1912, an attempt to legislate a women's suffrage amendment to the Arizona Constitution failed. Frances Munds mounted a successful ballot initiative campaign. On November 5, 1912, women's suffrage passed in Arizona. In 1913, the voter registration books were opened to women. In 1914, women participated in their first primary elections. Arizona ratified the Nineteenth Amendment on February 12, 1920. However, Native American women and Latinas would wait longer for full voting rights.\n19th century\n1880s\n1883\n* Murat Masterson of Prescott introduces a partial women's suffrage bill for women to vote in school board elections, but it fails.\n1884\n* The first Arizona chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) is formed.\n1887\n* The Arizona Woman's Equal Rights Association (AWERA) is founded in Phoenix.\n1890s\n1891\n*Josephine Brawley Hughes and Laura M.
