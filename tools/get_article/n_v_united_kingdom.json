      "text": "# N v United Kingdom\n\nN v United Kingdom [2008] [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2008/453.html ECHR 453] is an ECHR human rights case, concerning the lawfulness of deporting an individual in the UK with serious health issues.\nFacts\nA Ugandan citizen with HIV/AIDS claimed deportation to Uganda would be inhuman and degrading under ECHR article 3, because she would be unlikely to get health treatment. Without treatment she would stay alive for 2 years, with treatment for decades, almost as normal.\nThe House of Lords [2005] UKHL 31 agreed her case was not sufficiently exceptional, to justify halting deportation.\nJudgment\nThe European Court of Human Rights agreed with the House of Lords that the case was not exceptional, in contrast to the case of D v United Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 423.\nSee also\n*United Kingdom enterprise law\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
