After being vested the power to award its own degrees from the University of London in 2006, graduates began wearing King's College London academic dress in 2008.\nHistory\n, suppliers of the Westwood-designed academic dress of King's. This main shop is along Chancery Lane, stone's throw away from King's Maughan Library]]\nPrior to 2008, the Academic dress of King's was similar to that of the University of London's which, like most academic dress, is based on medieval attire. Graduates of the University of London have been formally presented to the Chancellor of the university since 1849, and the first public presentation of the university was held at King's Great Hall in 1850. From 1903 to 1992 this university ceremony was continued in the Royal Albert Hall, and King's first held its own ceremony in 1989. In 1995, the University of London granted some of its constituent colleges the power to confer degrees on behalf of the university.\nIn 2007, in line with the evolution of the university's constituent colleges, King's successfully petitioned the Privy Council for its degree-awarding powers in its own right; these powers were first used in 2008. Such development in securing its own degree-awarding powers brought the need for King's to design its own academic dress. During the transition phase, global fashion icon Dame Vivienne Westwood was approached by Patricia Rawlings, Baroness Rawlings, then Chairperson of King's College London, to design an academic gown of the institution. Working with Ede & Ravenscroft, the producers of the academic dress, the Westwood-designed academic dresses for King's College London have been unveiled in 2008. On the gowns, Vivienne Westwood commented: \"Through my reworking of the traditional robe I tried to link the past, the present and the future. We are what we know.\"\nThe 'new' academic gowns were showcased at the first graduation of summer 2008, where Westwood and former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Lord Smith of Finsbury were among those wearing the gowns as they received their King's College London Honorary Fellowships.\nFeatures\nWestwood-designed academic dress features two long (4') stole-like streamers which serve as gown facings. There is no neckband. Westwood's unique but unifying style for King's academic dress is the King's College London lion gold button on each shoulder. Influenced by University of London's tradition, being the first university in the world to devise a system of academic dress based on faculty colours, the gowns and hoods have been designed with colours that reflect the university's faculties/schools/institutes of study and the level of the degree. Owing to its unique shape, the hood cannot be folded flat. The hood may be made with a neckband but this is strictly for use by clergy who require to wear the hood over a surplice and are not to be used for university ceremonies.\nThe scheme does not provide for a hat, though mortarboards may be hired for the day or provided for photography (they are not allowed to be worn during graduation ceremonies).\nColours\nin different meaningful colours, as unveiled by the university and Westwood during the Summer 2008 graduation.]]\nThe King's gowns and hoods have been designed with colours to reflect the academic faculties or schools.\n* Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine (School of Bioscience Education) – Orange\n* Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences – Fuchsia\n* Faculty of Arts & Humanities – Mint Green\n* Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience – Deep Red\n* The Dickson Poon School of Law – Silver\n* Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, GKT School of Medical Education (MBBS) only – Purple\n* Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care – Lilac\n* Faculty of Natural, Mathematical & Engineering Sciences – Coral\n* Faculty of Social Science & Public Policy – Gold\n* '''King's Business School''' – Teal (2018-2023), Emerald Green (from 2024)\nFirst degrees\nAll hoods and gowns for first degrees are black, lined with a certain colour.
