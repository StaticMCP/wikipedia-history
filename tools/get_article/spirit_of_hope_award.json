      "text": "# Spirit of Hope Award\n\nThe Spirit of Hope Award is a United States military award presented by the Department of Defense.  The award was created based on the contributions of entertainer Bob Hope to members of the military, and is annually awarded to individuals or organizations whose work benefits the quality of life of service members and their families.\nHistory\nThe Spirit of Hope Award was established in 1997 under the Clinton administration. It was first granted to entertainer Bob Hope by the United States Congress, and is awarded in his honor.  The basis for the award was to recognize Hope's commitment to entertaining military service members over many decades, both within and outside of combat zones.\nOriginally commissioned by the USO, the bas-relief sculpture was created by St. Louis sculptor Don F. Wiegand and co-creator Mr. Michael Fagin. Michael Fagin, president of The International Group, Inc., says the piece was inspired by [null Bob Hopes] dedication to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. \"We could think of no better way to say thank you to Bob, and to all the volunteers who support and entertain American service men and women all over the world.\" said Fagin.\nCriteria\nThe Spirit of Hope Award is awarded to individuals who:\n# Epitomize the values of Bob Hope: duty, honor, courage, loyalty, commitment, integrity, and selfless dedication.\n# Significantly enhance the quality of life of Service members and their families serving around the world.\n# Selflessly contribute an extraordinary amount of time, talent, or resources to benefit Service members.\nFurthermore, the award is presented annually to recipients nominated and selected by the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard.\nRecipients\n2005\n* Diane Devalt (US Marine Corps)\n* SSgt Jason Lerma (US Air Force)\n* Sheila McNeill (US Coast Guard)\n*\n2006\n* Col (ret) Robert Nett (US Army)\n* James Carrier (US Navy)\n* Dr. Ronald Lingle (US Marine Corps)\n* SMSgt Ann Hinote (US Air Force)\n* The Coast Guard Foundation (US Coast Guard)\n*\n2007\n* Chaplain (Col) Lyle Metzler (US Army)\n* SCPO Giovanni Balingit (US Navy)\n* The Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund (US Marine Corps)\n* MSgt Louis Pell (US Air Force)\n* Marvin Perrett (posthumous) (US Coast Guard)\n*\n2008\n* Walter White (Office of the Secretary of Defense)\n* Michael Peterson (US Army)\n* Cynthia Martinez (US Marine Corps)\n* Nicholas Grand (US Air Force)\n* The Crew of the USCGC ALERT (US Coast Guard)\n*\n2009\n* The Soldiers' Angels (Office of the Secretary of Defense)\n* Still Serving Veterans Association (US Army)\n* Laura Froehlich (US Navy)\n* Joseph Finch (US Marine Corps)\n* Sew Much Comfort (US Air Force)\n* AST2 Tye Coknlin (US Coast Guard)\n*\n2010\n* Fisher House Foundation (Office of the Secretary of Defense)\n* Camp Hope (US Army)\n* Jack and Nina Baugh (US Navy)\n* MSgt Chantell Hardway (US Air Force)\n* Rear Admiral Stephen Rochon (US Coast Guard)\n*\n2011\n* Segs4Vets (Office of the Secretary of Defense)\n* Janice Bridges (US Army)\n* PO Jamar Salters (US Navy)\n* Ronald Katz (US Marine Corps)\n* SSgt Leray Smedley (US Air Force)\n* Elaine Savage (US Coast Guard)\n2012\n* Gary Sinise (Office of the Secretary of Defense)\n* Two Top Mountain Adaptive Sports Foundation (US Army)\n* Operation Gratitude (US Navy)\n* Hope for the Warriors (US Marine Corps)\n* MSgt Brandon Lambert (US Air Force)\n* Ross Roeder (US Coast Guard)\n2013\n* John Barnes (Office of the Secretary of Defense)\n* Wayne C.
