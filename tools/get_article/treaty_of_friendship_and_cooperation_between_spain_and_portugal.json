It was ratified on 17&nbsp;April 1978 in Portugal and on 25&nbsp;April 1978 in Spain. Its stated goals were to strengthen the bonds of friendship and solidarity between the two countries. It was signed by Portuguese Prime Minister Mário Soares and Spanish Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez.\nThe treaty replaced the Iberian Pact signed in 1939, and followed both countries' transitions into democracies, after the Carnation Revolution in Portugal and the 1977 Spanish general election.\nSee also\n*Portugal–Spain relations\nExternal links\n*[https://www.britishpathe.com/video/VLVAB88CKBU2E7VY1FK8JNQ3YCDEZ-SPAIN-SPAIN-AND-PORTUGAL-SIGN-NEW-IBERIAN-PACT British Pathe video of signing]\nReferences"
