In Neolithic Italy, female images are found in a domestic context, while images that combine sexual characteristics appear in burials or religious settings. In Neolithic Greece and Cyprus, figures are often dual-sexed or without identifying sexual characteristics.\n3rd millennium BCE\n29th century BCE&nbsp;– 25th century BCE\n* c. 2900 BCE&nbsp;– c. 2500 BCE&nbsp;– A burial of a suburb of Prague, Czech Republic, a male is buried in the outfit usually reserved for women.

Marriage between men in Greece was not legally recognized, but men might form lifelong relationships originating in paiderastia (\"pederasty,\" without the pejorative connotations of the English word). These partnerships were not dissimilar to heterosexual marriages except that the older person served as educator or mentor.\n* Sappho, a Greek lyric poet born on the island of Lesbos, was born between 630 and 612 BCE, and died around 570 BCE. The Alexandrians included her in the list of nine lyric poets. She was famous for her lesbian themes, giving her name and that of her homeland to the very definition of lesbianism (and the lesser used term of \"sapphism\"). She was exiled c. 600 BCE unrelated to lesbianism. She was later permitted to return.\n6th century BCE\n* 534&nbsp;– 492 BCE&nbsp;– Duke Ling of Wey and Mizi Xia had a loving same-sex relationship, where various plays and stories have commemorated their love story in the phrase, \"the bitten peach\".\n* c. 540&nbsp;– 530 BCE&nbsp;– Wall paintings from the Etruscan Tomb of the Bulls (Italian: Tomba dei Tori), found in 1892 in the Monterozzi necropolis, Tarquinia, depict homosexual intercourse. The tomb is named for the pair of bulls who watch human sex scenes, one between a man and a woman, and the other between two men; these may be apotropaic, or embody aspects of the cycle of regeneration and the afterlife.

J. McGinn, Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 140–141.Amy Richlin, The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 86, 224.John Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 67–68.Craig Williams, Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116. It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. For an adult male citizen to desire and engage in same-sex relations was considered natural and socially acceptable, as long as his partner was a male prostitute, slave or infamis, a person excluded from the legal protections accorded a citizen. In the Imperial period, the Lex Scantinia was revived by Domitian as part of his program of judicial and moral reform.\n1st century BCE\n* c. 90s&nbsp;– 80s BCE&nbsp;– Quintus Lutatius Catulus was among a circle of poets who made short, light Hellenistic poems fashionable in the late Republic.

Men who had been raped were exempt from the loss of legal or social standing suffered by those who submitted their bodies to use for the pleasure of others; a male prostitute or entertainer was infamis and excluded from the legal protections extended to citizens in good standing. As a matter of law, a slave could not be raped; he was considered property and not legally a person. The slave's owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.Richlin, \"Not before Homosexuality,\" pp. 562–563.See also Digest 48.5.35 [34] on legal definitions of rape that included boys.\n* 46 BCE&nbsp;– Lucius Antonius, the brother of Mark Antony, accuses Gaius Octavius for having \"given himself to Aulus Hirtius in Spain for three hundred thousand sesterces.\"\n* 44 BCE&nbsp;– After the assassination of Dictator and Consul Gaius Julius Caesar, Gaius Octavius is publicly named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir.

Caligula also either exiled or contemplated exiling spintriae from Rome. Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus reports that Caligula could only be restrained with difficulty, after lengthy pleadings, from having the spintriae thrown into the sea.\n* 54&nbsp;– Nero becomes Emperor of Rome. Nero married two men, Pythagoras and Sporus, in legal ceremonies, with Sporus accorded the regalia worn by the wives of the Caesars. Juvenal and Martial note (with disapproval) that male couples are having traditional marriage ceremonies.\n* 79&nbsp;– The eruption of Mount Vesuvius buries the coastal resorts of Pompeii and Herculaneum, preserving a rich collection of Roman erotic art, including representations of male-male and female-female.\n* 98&nbsp;– Trajan, one of the most beloved of Roman emperors, begins his reign.

In Germania, Tacitus writes that the punishment for those who engage in \"bodily infamy\" among the Germanic peoples is to \"smother in mud and bogs under an heap of hurdles.\" Tacitus also writes in Germania that the Germanic warrior-chieftains and their retinues were \"in times of peace, beauty, and in times of war, a defense\". Tacitus later wrote in Germania that priests of the Swabian sub-tribe, the NaharvaliFor the spelling, see Hans-Werner Goetz, Jörg Jarnut, Walter Pohl (eds.), Regna and Gentes: The Relationship Between Late Antique and Early ...

It is said, too, that in Thebes long ago this practice was not held to be shameful, and they say that Meriones the Cretan was so called by way of indicating the Cretans' customed and some refer to this the burning love of Achilles for Patroclus. And what wonder, when both the adherents of the Cynic philosophy and the followers of Zeno of Citium, Cleanthes and Chrysippus, declare that this practice is indifferent?\".\n2nd century&nbsp;– 3rd century\n* 193&nbsp;– 211&nbsp;– Roman emperor Septimius Severus prescribed capital punishment for homosexual rape throughout the Roman Empire.\n3rd century\n* 218&nbsp;– 222 – Roman emperor Elagabalus's reign begins.

The emperor wears makeup and wigs, prefers to be called a lady and not a lord, and offers vast sums to any physician who can provide them with a vagina; for this reason, the emperor is seen by some writers as an early transgender figure and one of the first on record as seeking sex reassignment surgery.\n* 222&nbsp;– 235&nbsp;– Roman emperor Severus Alexander deported homosexuals who were active in public life.
