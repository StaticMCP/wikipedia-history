      "text": "# Century (American band)\n\nCentury was an American metalcore band formed in 2005 by multi-instrumentalist/ArmsBendBack guitarist Carson Slovak. Century was originally conceived as a solo project, but later evolved into a complete band. Slovak writes all of Century's music, and designs all of the artwork and merchandise. In 2005 the band signed a contract with Tribunal Records. On February 7, 2006, Century released its first studio album, Faith and Failure through Tribunal Records. This album saw Carson Slovak as guitarist and producer joined by Mike Guiliano (guitar), Huggie (bass) and Grant McFarland (drums). Before the album was released, McFarland left to focus more on his current band This or the Apocalypse and was replaced by new drummer Matthew Smith.\nIn February 2009, it was announced that McFarland had rejoined the band, along with new additions: bassist Ricky Armellino (also of This or the Apocalypse), and  additional guitarist Todd Mogle.  The band has begun work on the follow-up to Black Ocean, which was released in April 2008.\nOn March 9, 2010, the band posted a cover of Seal's \"Kiss from a Rose\" on their Myspace page and announced that they would be working on a new album scheduled to be released later in 2010.\nTheir third studio album, titled Red Giant, was released on August 30, 2011. It featured Candlebox singer Kevin Martin on the track, \"Oak God\".\nMembers\nCurrent members\n* Carson Slovak – vocals\n* Jason Baker – guitar\n* Todd Mogle – guitar\n* Ricky Armellino - bass\n* Grant McFarland – drums\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!width=\"200\"|Album details\n|-\n|2006\n|Faith and Failure\n*Released: February 7, 2006\n*Label: Tribunal\n*Formats: CD, Paid download\n|-\n|2008\n|Black Ocean\n*Released: April 29, 2008\n*Label: Prosthetic\n*Formats: CD, Paid download\n|-\n|2011\n|Red Giant\n*Released: August 30, 2011\n*Label: Prosthetic\n*Formats: CD, Paid download\n|-\n|}\nExtended plays\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!width=\"200\"|Album details\n|-\n|2005\n|Century\n*Released: 2005\n*Label: Self-released\n*Formats: CD\n|-\n|}\nVideography\nMusic videos\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
