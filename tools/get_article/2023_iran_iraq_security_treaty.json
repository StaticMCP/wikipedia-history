Under the terms of the security agreement, Iraq pledged it would not allow militant groups to use its territory in the Iraqi Kurdish region to launch any border-crossing attacks on areas close to Iran's borders. Iraq moved armed groups opposed to Iran from border areas in the Kurdistan region.\nThe deadline for the agreement was 19 September 2023.\nReferences"
