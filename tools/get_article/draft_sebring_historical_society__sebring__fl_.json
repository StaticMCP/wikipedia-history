Weigle House Museum. The Archives Office is located at 321 W. Center Avenue, Sebring, FL 33870. The Museum is located at 1989 Lakeview Drive, Sebring, Florida.\nCurrent Board of Directors\nOFFICERS 2025\nPresident: Kim Piesik\nVice President: Frank Cartisano\nSecretary: Linda Kolarik\nTreasurer: {Vacant}\nAdditional Board Members: Chris Day, Elaine Haines, Bobby Lee, Alex Lopez, Terry Mendel, Denise Serrano and Robert Shannon\nSHS history\nInitial interest in forming a historical society began in 1962 as Sebring High School graduates were reminiscing at the end of their alumni reunion. Included in the formal organization meetings were pioneers Floyd Schumacher, Ford Heacock and Allen Altvater. By July 1967, a Board of Directors had been formed, and the first officers had been elected. Ray Graddy, who later became Sebring's Postmaster, was the first president. The State of Florida issued Articles of Incorporation on August 7, 1968. In April 1969, Sebring historian Allen Altvater authored and published the first newsletter, The Bulletin. He continued as Editor and Publisher through 1986.\nEarly on, members recognized the need for a historical records office. In 1973, the Archives opened in three rooms in the basement of the Sebring police station and in 1976, a committee was formed to collect memorabilia and to promote the Archives.  In 1988, SHS member Woodrow Harshman gave a gift of $85,000 to the Sebring Historical Society. The SHS worked out an arrangement with the Sebring Public Library, whereby the library agreed to use the money to build a 1,700 square foot Archives as part of its new library addition. In 1991, the Archives was moved to the Sebring Public Library.\nQuarterly luncheon meetings with speakers have been held at the Sebring Civic Center since 1991. A recent meeting in 2024 was also held in the Jack Stroup Civic Center.\nIn 1992, the name of The Bulletin newsletter was changed to The Historian.\nIn 2003, Director of Archives Carol Goad and volunteers began to organize many of the historical records into notebooks which were put on display in the front room. By 2015, over 100 topics had been organized and cataloged into notebooks.\nEnsuing years have brought additional changes. Needing a space to display collected artifacts, a museum was established in 2022.  Also announced in 2022 was the possibility of the Society headquarters being housed in a proposed Sebring Cultural Center as part of CRA plans. An alternative headquarters location was also considered with a proposal for leasing part of the MOTA building submitted in 2023.  The Sebring Historical Society continues to evolve after over 60 years of continuous existence. In 2023 SHS established an annual community event named \"Pioneer Daze\", followed with the second event in 2024. Over the years many local residents have served in Board, staff and volunteer positions. Sadly, the SHS noted the passing of Jim Pollard in December 2024, who most recently functioned as Director. The latest Board was elected to serve beginning in 2025.\nArchives Office - Archives/Collections\nThe Society has extensive historical records covering the history of Sebring.
