It was also reported that Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Shanell,  Drake,  Tyga, Christina Milian, Gudda Gudda, Lil Twist, and Euro would be featured on the album. In the release it stated, \"We Are Young Money helped launch the careers of our first generation of acts with Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Tyga. Even though we've been honored with accolades as a company, our hunger hasn't diminished or dwindled. We're hungrier than ever, and we're still building. That goes hand-in-hand with the title Young Money: Rise Of An Empire. We're not going anywhere. We don't plan on stopping— ever. Our goal is the expansion of this empire with the next generation of kings and queens ruling.\"\nOn January 26, 2014, Birdman told Sway Calloway of MTV News that every artist signed to Young Money would be featured on the album including Lil Chuckee, Austin Mahone and Paris Hilton among others already revealed. The album's cover artwork was revealed on February 15, 2014. The ominous red image displays a moon and clouds with a castle in the distance. On February 22, 2014, the album's track listing was announced, revealing appearances on the final version of the album from Lil Wayne, Drake, Nicki Minaj, Mack Maine, Tyga, Jae Millz, Cory Gunz, Christina Milan, Gudda Gudda, Lil Twist, Shanell, Chanel West Coast, PJ Morton, Euro and Flow. It revealed additional guest appearances outside of Young Money from YG, Meek Mill, Yo Gotti and Birdman.\nSingles\nOn January 22, 2014, Young Money released the album's first single \"We Alright\", featuring Lil Wayne, Birdman and the label's newest signee Euro. The Colin Tilley-directed music video was released on February 15, 2014. The video features cameo appearances from multiple members of Young Money.\n\"Senile\" originally started as a single for Tyga, who then got Nicki Minaj featured on it, then Lil Wayne. Due to Tyga's fourth studio album not coming out till later in the year, they just decided to release it as a single for the compilation album. On February 10, 2014, Tyga revealed the cover artwork for the D.A. Doman-produced \"Senile\". He also said that the single would be released on February 17, 2014, however it would be pushed back slightly. Then on February 24, 2014, the song was premiered online as a promotional single. On April 13, 2014, the music video was released for \"Senile\".\nOn February 27, 2014, \"Trophies\" featuring Drake and \"Lookin Ass\" featuring Nicki Minaj were released as the second and third official singles.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 55, based on 8 reviews, indicating \"generally mixed reviews\". Melanie Sims of the Associated Press said, \"Lil Wayne isn't just the founder of Young Money Cash Money Billionaires, he's the rap squad's captain, too. And on \"Rise of an Empire,\" Weezy plays his role well, anchoring a winning compilation from the camp, and making up for last year's lackluster I Am Not a Human Being II.\" In closing she said \"though Wayne, Drake and Minaj are the star players, their bench-warmers keep it hot.\" David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, \"Call it a wobbly when it comes to quality, or a showcase for the young that's stolen by the old, but it's best to consider it a simple roster-promoting label compilation that just happens to come with an EP or so worth of fire.\" Sheldon Pearce of XXL said, \"Rise Of An Empire is muddled by mid-level talent. The stars shine brightly but their presence is spotty at best. The rest of the roster just doesn't produce in their absence. While We Are Young Money was a semblance of roughly disjointed but mildly enjoyable posse cuts loaded with artists willing to just make their presence felt, Rise Of An Empire feels almost entirely like an album pitching stand-ins as the next wave of world conquering MCs to no avail.\" However, he praised Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj's appearances and the Lil Twist, Tyga and YG collaboration \"One Time\".\nCarrie Battan of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 4.9 out of 10, saying \"A DVD released along with the deluxe edition of Nicki Minaj's last album pictures her alongside Wayne, presenting him with a brand new car for his birthday and faithfully referring to him as the President. She and Drake clearly remember the days when they were lucky to have Young Money. Rise of an Empire paints a different picture, one that emphasizes exactly how lucky Young Money is to still have them.\" Mike Powell of Rolling Stone gave the album two and a half stars out of five, saying \"Contractually, Drake and Minaj are here; artistically, they've moved on. And the label's flagship genius, Lil Wayne, is ostentatiously bored: \"Have my cake and eat it, too/I want a bakery.\" That's so half-ass, it's almost funny.\" Jordan Sowunmi of Now gave the album two out of five stars, saying \"The album is bogged down in missteps like Tyga, Lil' Twist and YG's limp One Time and uninspired strip club anthem Back It Up. Wayne, who's been on autopilot the last few years, is spotty again here, delivering a characteristically apathetic verse on the Christina Millian co-starring Video Model, sounding like a man trying to capture the flirty magic of his earlier pop features, but falling painfully short.\"\nComplex named it the twenty-sixth best album of the first half of 2014. Writing for them, Lauren Nostro said, \"Intro posse cut \"We Alright\" bangs, as does \"Trophies\" and \"Lookin Ass.\" Add strong YG and Meek Mill features, plus a tremendous effort from Wayne on \"Moment,\" and you've got an unlikely success\"\nCommercial performance\nThe album debuted at number 7 on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 32,000 copies in the United States. In its second week, the album dropped to number 36 on the chart, selling 11,000 more copies. In its third week, the album sold 6,000 more copies. In its fourth week, the album sold 5,100 more copies bringing its total album sales to 53,000 copies.\nTrack listing\n| extra1        = S-X\n| length1       = 5:12\n| title2        = Trophies\n| note2         = featuring Drake\n| writer2       =\n| extra2        =\n| length2       = 3:08\n| title3        = Bang\n| note3         = featuring Lil Twist, Euro and Cory Gunz\n| writer3       =\n| extra3        = Sonny Digital\n| length3       = 4:10\n| title4        = Senile\n| note4         = featuring Tyga, Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne\n| writer4       =\n| extra4        = David D.A.
