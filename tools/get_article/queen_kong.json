It was written by Agram, Ron Dobrin and Fabio Piccioni. The film is a parody of King Kong.\nPlot\nThis film switches the traditional roles of females and males and reverses the sexes of the original cast of King Kong. The main character Ray Fay plays the damsel in distress, which tends to usually be played by women. He is kidnapped by film director Luce Habit to star in her new African jungle movie. He then finds himself the attraction of an amorous giant female gorilla that pursues him across London.\nMain cast\n*Robin Askwith as Ray Fay\n*Rula Lenska as Luce Habit\n*Valerie Leon as Queen of the Nabongas\n*Roger Hammond as Woolf\n*Linda Hayden as the singing nun\n*John Clive as Comedian\n*Carol Drinkwater as Ima Goodbody\n*Anthony Morton as antique dealer\n*Vicki Michelle as crew girl\n*Anna Bergman as crew girl\n*Geraldine Gardner as crew girl\n*Jeannie Collings as crew girl\nProduction\nThe film was shot at Shepperton Studios and on location around London and Newhaven.
