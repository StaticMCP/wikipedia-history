This city is an ancient original place of the Silk Road. At the end of the Ming dynasty, many battles took place in Nanyang. In 1641, Li Zicheng attacked Nanyang and finally took control of the west of this city from the Ming dynasty. In 1642, he attacked Nanyang again and took control of the whole city. And that war was called Battle of Nanyang, which lasted nearly a year.\nReferences"
