Delegates to the 1932 Republican National Convention were elected from each of the state's congressional districts, along with seven delegates at-large.\nThe plurality of the elected delegates were not publicly committed to supporting any candidate, but most were establishment politicians who supported incumbent Herbert Hoover. Where delegates pledged explicitly to Hoover ran, they won every race. Four delegates were elected on tickets opposed to the prohibition of alcohol under the Volstead Act. In the non-binding presidential preference primary held concurrently, U.S. senator Joseph I. France was the only candidate listed on the ballot, but several thousand write-in votes were cast for Hoover.\nUltimately, all of the New Jersey delegates voted for Hoover at the national convention, as he was easily renominated. He lost the general election in a landslide to New York governor Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nBackground\nProcedure\nIn 1932, New Jersey was allocated 31 total delegates to the Republican National Convention. Seven delegates were elected at-large, and two delegates were elected from each of the state's twelve congressional districts, along with two alternates. Delegates were given the choice of pledging support to a particular candidate or running as uncommitted delegates.\nThe state also held a presidential preference primary. Joseph I. France was the only candidate listed on the ballot.\nEndorsements\nResults\nPreference primary results\nDespite France's large margin in the \"beauty contest\" primary, he received significantly fewer votes than Hoover had in 1928, when Hoover was also the only candidate listed. Further, three of the largest counties in the state (Bergen, Essex, and Passaic) did not record any write-in votes, depressing Hoover's total significantly.\nDelegate primary results\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:100%;line-height:20px\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#F2F2F2;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"colgroup\" | Delegate slate\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Delegate candidates\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Delegates\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Aggregate votes\n|- style=\"background-color:#F2F2F2;\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Statewide\n! scope=\"col\" | District\n! scope=\"col\" | Total\n! scope=\"col\" | Oftotal(%)\n! scope=\"col\" | Total\n! scope=\"col\" | Oftotal(%)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" data-sort-value=\"Uncommitted\" style=\"background:#000000;\" |\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Uncommitted\n|\n| 7\n| 8\n| 13\n| 39.93\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" data-sort-value=\"Hoover\" style=\"background:#9e5728;\" |\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" scope=\"row\" | Herbert Hoover\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n| 0\n| 10\n|10\n| 30.30\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" data-sort-value=\"Lowden\" style=\"background:#008000;\" |\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" scope=\"row\" | Regular Republican\n|\n| 0\n| 8\n| 6\n| 18.18\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" data-sort-value=\"Edge\" style=\"background:#1c3f93;\" |\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" scope=\"row\" | Anti-Prohibition\n|\n| 0\n| 5\n| 4\n| 12.12\n|\n|\n|- class=\"unsortable\" style=\"background-color:#F2F2F2\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Total\n! 7\n! 33\n! 33\n! 100.0\n! 1,246,302\n! 100.00\n|- class=\"unsortable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Registered voters, and turnout\n!\n!\n|}\nDelegate primary results by contest\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:100%;line-height:20px\"\n|+1932 New Jersey Republican primary\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Contest\n! colspan=\"5\" |Delegatesand popular vote\n|-\n!
