The official title is '''His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador to the Republic of Korea''' (ROK).\nHistory\nUnder the Imperial Chinese tributary system, Korea was a tributary state to China. After the United Kingdom–Korea Treaty of 1883 British Ministers to China were appointed as \"Her Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to His Majesty the Emperor of China, and also Her Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to His Majesty the King of Corea.\" Britain also appointed consuls-general to be resident in Seoul, but they were not heads of mission, as the head of mission was the minister in Peking (now Beijing). In 1898, following the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), the Korean Empire became independent of China, and Britain appointed a chargé d'affaires who became Minister Resident when the United Kingdom and Korea exchanged envoys in 1901.\nConsul-General in Seoul\nBritish representative to Joseon (until 1897) and later Korean Empire (after 1897).\n*1884–1885: William George Aston\n*1889–1896: Walter Hillier\n*1896–1898: John Jordan\nHead of mission to Korea\nMinister to China, non-resident minister to Korea\nHolders were station in Beijing.\n*1884–1885: Sir Harry Smith Parkes\n*1885–1892: Sir John Walsham, 2nd Baronet\n*1892–1895: Sir Nicholas O'Conor\n*1896–1898: Sir Claude MacDonald\nChargé d'affaires\n*1898–1901: John Jordan\nMinister Resident\n*1901–1905: Sir John Jordan\nUnder the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 Korea became a protectorate of Japan, and Britain and other countries withdrew diplomatic missions from Seoul. After World War II Japan's rule ended and Korea was occupied by the Soviet Union and United States, resulting in division of Korea between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea).\nKorea under Japanese rule\nFrom 1910 to 1945 Korea was under Dependent territory of the Empire of Japan, thus no longer required a diplomatic mission.\nHead of mission to South Korea\nThe current mission represents South Korea, while the ambassador for North Korea did not exist until 2000.\nEnvoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary\n*1949–1954: Captain Vyvyan Holt (consul-general from 1948).\n*1954–1956: Charles Stewart\n*1957: Hubert Evans\nAmbassadors extraordinary and plenipotentiary\n*1957–1961: Hubert Evans\n*1961–1966: Sir Walter Godfrey\n*1967–1969: Ian Clayton Mackenzie\n*1969–1971: Nigel Trench\n*1971–1974: Jeffrey Petersen\n*1975–1980: William Bates\n*1980–1983: John Morgan\n*1983–1986: Nicholas Spreckley\n*1986–1990: Lawrence Middleton\n*1990–1993: David Wright\n*1994–1997: Thomas Harris\n*1997–2000: Sir Stephen Brown\n*2000–2003: Charles Humfrey\n*2003–2008: Warwick Morris\n*2008–2011: Martin Uden\n*2011–2015: Scott Wightman\n*2015–2018: Charles Hay\n*2018–: Simon Smith\n*2022–present: Colin Crooks\nSee also\n* British Embassy, Seoul\n* Embassy of Korea in the United Kingdom\n* South Korea–United Kingdom relations\n** United Nations Command\n** United Kingdom in the Korean War\n** United Nations Memorial Cemetery\n** 1st Commonwealth Division\n** KATCOM\n** British Commonwealth Forces Korea\n* Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office\n* Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n* List of diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom\n* List of diplomatic missions in South Korea\nNotes\nReferences\n* Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921-1922.
