Larson that aired on the ABC network from September 17, 1978, to April 29, 1979. It stars an ensemble cast led by Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict and Lorne Greene. Canceled after 24 episodes, the series was revived as Galactica 1980, which aired for 10 episodes from January 27 to May 4, 1980.\nThe series follows a group of humans fleeing the destruction of their homeworlds aboard the titular spacecraft, searching for a new home while being pursued by the Cylons, a fearsome society of robots intent on exterminating all humans.\nSeries overview\n| start1    =\n| end1      =\n| color2    = #6796E9\n| link2     = List of Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series) and Galactica 1980 episodes#Galactica 1980 (1980)\n| linkT2    = Galactica 1980\n| episodes2 = 10\n| start2    =\n| end2      =\n}}\nEpisodes\nBattlestar Galactica (1978–79)\n}}\n|writer     = 42\n|writerT    = Written by\n|airdate    = 15\n|airdateR   =\n|episodes   =\n| ShortSummary      = In a distant part of the cosmos, the human race is embroiled in a thousand-year-long war with the robotic Cylons. Aided by the human traitor Baltar, an armistice turns out to be a ruse by the Cylons, who launch a massive surprise attack against the Twelve Colonies of humanity, almost wiping them out. Only the Battlestar Galactica, led by Commander Adama, and a ragtag fleet of 220 civilian ships survive, beginning a journey across the galaxy in search of long-lost sister civilization Earth. But the Cylons will not rest until every last human has been eliminated, and pursue them across the galaxy.

Led by Adama's spiritual interpretations, the fleet enters a vast magnetic void, emerging at the planet Kobol, the legendary world from which humanity originated.  Before Adama can discover Earth's location from the inscribed hieroglyphs, a Cylon attack destroys the sacred city on Kobol—and claims the life of Serina.\n| LineColor         = #574AA9\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate   =\n| ShortSummary      = Marooned on a frontier planet, Apollo befriends a young widow and her son, rallying a town against \"Red Eye\"— a likewise marooned, yet memory-damaged, Cylon centurion gunslinger.

Apollo, Starbuck, and Boomer lead a team of cutthroat demolitions and cold-weather experts (and the stowaway Boxey). Along the way, they encounter the misguided human scientist who originally built the weapon, as well as his legions of clones.\n| LineColor         = #574AA9\n}}\n| ShortSummary      = When a Cylon attack destroys the fleet's food supply, Adama and the others must agree to certain compromises with old acquaintances and with the inhabitants of a grain-rich, yet politically turbulent planet.

The Pegasus plunges into the teeth of Cylon forces and is either destroyed or \"missing in action\" after the attack.\n| LineColor         = #574AA9\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate   =\n| ShortSummary      = The Galactica is rammed by Cylon Raiders making suicide runs on the main bridge and a landing bay.

On an eerie, red-glowing planet, the enigmatic Count Iblis (portrayed by Patrick Macnee), is found, apparently the sole survivor of a major catastrophe.  Always shunning the mysterious bright lights, Iblis (a character very much like the Devil) uses his charm and his supernatural powers to wrest control of the fleet from Adama, but the wiley Commander knows Iblis' key is on the red planet, where Apollo and Starbuck go only to face tragedy and find the answer to the mysterious lights.\n| LineColor         = #574AA9\n}}\n| ShortSummary      = An old con man named Chameleon (Fred Astaire) meets Starbuck and cons him into believing he may be his father in order to gain his help in evading a trio of blood-thirsty Borellians who are after him seeking revenge for a previous con. In the process, Starbuck's girlfriend Cassiopeia learns that Chameleon's con may not actually be a con after all.\n| LineColor         = #574AA9\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate   =\n| ShortSummary      = When Starbuck is implicated in a rival triad-player's murder, Apollo and Boomer come to his defense as Protectors.

Commander Xaviar steals an experimental Viper capable of time travel and goes back to the 1940s in an attempt to speed up Earth's technological development by giving Colonial technology to the Nazis.

At some point between the events of Battlestar Galactica and Galactica 1980, Starbuck crash lands on a remote planet, and builds a robot companion from Cylon parts, which he names \"Cy\". As Cy tries to understand human relationships, Starbuck helps a mysterious woman, Angela (Judith Chapman), give birth to a baby boy. Starbuck sends Angela and the baby off toward the Galactica in an escape ship cobbled together with Cy's assistance.

The first film, Battlestar Galactica, was an edited version of the pilot, \"Saga of a Star World\", featuring some differences from the original televised episodes, including the death of Baltar. It was released in cinemas in Canada, New Zealand, Australia and continental Europe before its American TV premiere and, in 1979, it was released theatrically in the UK, Ireland and the US. The second film, Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack, was a re-edited version of the episodes \"The Living Legend\" and \"Fire in Space\", which also differed from the broadcast versions, omitting several scenes from both episodes. In 1979, it was released theatrically in continental Europe and Japan, and in the UK, New Zealand and Australia in 1980. The third film, Conquest of the Earth (also called \"Galactica III\" on the German poster), was a similar edit, though this time its source episodes were from Galactica 1980. It was also released theatrically, in 1981, in Europe, New Zealand and Australia.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! Title\n! Release\n!

The four two-part episodes (\"Lost Planet of the Gods\", \"Gun on Ice Planet Zero\", \"The Living Legend\" and \"War of the Gods\") were all combined and expanded with about five minutes of scenes deleted from the original broadcasts. The remaining single episodes were edited into two-hour blocks, combining two episodes into a single narrative, occasionally including over-dubbed dialogue. The final TV movie, an expanded version of \"Experiment in Terra\" with some scenes from the Galactica 1980 episode \"The Return of Starbuck\", featured new footage of an astronaut finding Commander Adama's logbook, which retold the premise of the show. It is believed that this version of the episode was to be released as another theatrical film in other countries, but never materialized.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! #\n! TV movie title\n!
