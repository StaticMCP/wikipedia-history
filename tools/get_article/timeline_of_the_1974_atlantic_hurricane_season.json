      "text": "# Timeline of the 1974 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 1974 Atlantic hurricane season was a cycle of the annual tropical cyclone season in the Atlantic Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere. There was near-average activity during the season,|group=\"nb\"}} which officially began on June&nbsp;1, 1974 and ended on November&nbsp;30, 1974. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical systems form. The first system of the season, Tropical Depression One, formed on June&nbsp;22. The final system of the season, Tropical Depression Seventeen, dissipated on November 11.\nThe 1974 season produced twenty tropical or subtropical depressions, of which eleven reached tropical (7) or subtropical (4) storm intensity. Four of the tropical storms became hurricanes, of which two became major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} At Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson scale, Hurricane Carmen was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season. It threatened two densely populated areas during its duration, Belize City, Belize and New Orleans, Louisiana, but veered away at the last moment each time. Even so, the storm caused much flooding and crop damage in and around the Yucatán Peninsula and Gulf Coast of the United States. The deadliest cyclone of 1974 was Hurricane Fifi (Category 2), which killed 6,000–8,000 people in Honduras, making it one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes on record. As a result of their intensity and damage caused, the names Carman and Fifi were subsequently retired from reuse in the North Atlantic by the World Meteorological Organization.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC). In this time line, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective local time included in parentheses.\nTimeline\nJune\nJune 1\n* The 1974 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\nTracking map of Tropical Depression One\nJune 22\n* 1200 UTC (7 a.m. CDT)Tropical Depression One forms in the Gulf of Mexico.\nTracking map of Subtropical Storm One.\nJune 24\n* 1800 UTC (1 p.m. CDT)Subtropical Depression One forms in the Gulf of Mexico.\nJune 25\n* 0000 UTC (7 p.m. CDT June 24)Subtropical Depression One strengthens into a subtropical storm.\n* 1200 UTC (7 a.m. CDT)Subtropical Storm One reaches its peak intensity and makes landfall just north of Tampa, Florida, with winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h).\nJune 26\n* 0000 UTC (8 p.m. EDT June 25)Subtropical Storm One becomes extratropical off the coast of Florida.\n* 1200 UTC (7 a.m. CDT)Tropical Depression One dissipates in the central Gulf of Mexico.\nJuly\nTracking map of Tropical Depression Two.\nJuly 13\n* 1800 UTC (1 p.m. CDT)Tropical Depression Two forms in the northern Gulf of Mexico just south of the Florida Panhandle.\nImage of Subtropical Storm Two on July 17, 1974, at peak strength.\nJuly 16\n* 0000 UTC (8 p.m. EDT July 15)Subtropical Depression Two forms off the Eastern coast of the United States.\nJuly 17\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Subtropical Depression Two strengthens into a subtropical storm.\n* 1800 UTC (1 p.m. CDT)Tropical Depression Two makes landfall near Galveston, Texas, and dissipates.\nJuly 18\n*1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Subtropical Storm Two reaches its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h).\nJuly 20\n* 0000 UTC (8 p.m. EDT July 19)Subtropical Storm Two becomes extratropical east of Newfoundland, Canada.\nTracking map of Tropical Depression Three.\nJuly 31\n* 1200 UTC (10 a.m. AST)Tropical Depression Three forms just northwest of the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa.\nAugust\nAugust 2\n* 1200 UTC (10 a.m. AST)Tropical Depression Three dissipates in the central Atlantic Ocean.\nImage of Subtropical Storm Three at peak strength.\nAugust 10\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Subtropical Storm Three forms south of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\nAugust 12\n*1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Tropical Depression Four forms in the  southern tropical Atlantic Ocean.\nAugust 13\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Tropical Depression Four strengthens into a tropical storm and is named Alma.\n* 1800 UTC (2 p.m. EDT)Tropical Storm Alma reaches a peak intensity of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h).\nTracking map of Tropical Storm Alma.\nAugust 14\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Tropical Storm Alma makes landfall on Trinidad and Tobago with winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h).\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Subtropical Storm Three reaches its peak strength of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h).\n* 1800 UTC (2 p.m. EDT)Tropical Storm Alma makes landfall on Venezuela with winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h).\nAugust 15\n* 0600 UTC (2 a.m. EDT)Subtropical Storm Three is absorbed by a frontal boundary just southeast of Nova Scotia, Canada.\n* 1800 UTC (2 p.m. EDT)Tropical Storm Alma rapidly dissipates over the mountains of Venezuela.\nTracking map of Tropical Depression Five.\nAugust 24\n* 1200 UTC (7 a.m. CDT)Tropical Depression Five forms north of Cuba in the Gulf of Mexico.\nAugust 26\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Tropical Depression Six forms in the central Atlantic far from land.\n* 1200 UTC (7 a.m. CDT)Tropical Depression Five makes landfall near Galveston, Texas, and dissipates.\nImage of Hurricane Becky at peak intensity on August 30, 1974.\nAugust 28\n* 0600 UTC (2 a.m. EDT)Tropical Depression Six strengthens into a tropical storm and is named Becky.\n* 1800 UTC (2 p.m. EDT)Tropical Storm Becky strengthens into a hurricane.\nAugust 29\n* 0600 UTC (2 a.m. EDT)Tropical Depression Seven forms off the Greater Antilles.\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Hurricane Becky reaches category 2 hurricane strength.\nAugust 30\n* 0600 UTC (2 a.m. EDT)Hurricane Becky reaches major hurricane strength and a peak intensity of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h).\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Tropical Depression Seven strengthens into a tropical storm and is named Carmen.\nAugust 31\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Tropical Storm Carmen strengthens into a hurricane.\n* 1800 UTC (3 p.m. AST)Hurricane Becky weakens into a category 2 hurricane.\nSeptember\nSeptember 1\n* 0600 UTC (2 a.m. EDT)Hurricane Carmen becomes a category 2 hurricane.\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Hurricane Carmen becomes a major hurricane.\n* 1200 UTC (8 a.m. EDT)Hurricane Becky weakens into a category 1 hurricane.\n* 1800 UTC (2 p.m. EDT)Hurricane Carmen becomes a category 4 hurricane.\nHurricane Carmen at landfall in Belize on September 2\nSeptember 2\n* 0000 UTC (9 pm.
