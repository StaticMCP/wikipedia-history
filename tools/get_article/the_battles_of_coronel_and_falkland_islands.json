To counter the German squadron, the Royal Navy sent two battle-cruisers -  and  - to the South Atlantic. In December 1914, the British battle-cruisers, accompanied by smaller ships, engaged the German squadron during the Battle of the Falkland Islands and sank the German armoured cruisers  and  near the Falkland Islands.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Dixon, Bryony [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/443264/ Battles of the Coronel and Falkland Islands, The (1927)].
