Anthony Lagman, a soldier from Yonkers, N.Y. who was killed in action in 2004.\nHistory\nThe site that would eventually become Forward Operating Base Lagman was originally an abandoned mud shack to the east of the large hill-top fortress overlooking the town of Qalat. Elements of Alpha Company, 2-22nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team (10th Mountain Division) first surrounded the mud shack with a rudimentary barrier of concertina wire and guard positions in a sparse firebase position. Over their remaining deployment, this firebase was slowly built up with mortar positions, raised guard shacks, sandbag bunkers, and a large tent for sleeping.\nNearing the end of 2nd Brigade Combat Team's 2003 - 2004 deployment rotation, the firebase was officially named after Staff Sgt. Anthony Lagman, who died during a combat operation in the village of Miam Do in March 2004. At the end of 2nd Brigade Combat Team's 2003-2004 deployment rotation, the firebase was turned over to elements of 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division (Light).\nThe base was home to:\n* EOD response teams from the 706th Ordnance Company (EOD) January 2004 until July 2004\n* 926th Engineer Battalion Bravo Company (US Army Reserve) July 2004 until March 2005\n* 926th Engineer Battalion Charlie Company (US Army Reserve) March 2005 until March 2006 (This unit would become infamous for the report that two Soldiers of the unit had abused a detainee.)\n* A detachment of Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Seven (NMCB 7)\n* 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment until 10 April 2005.\n* 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment from 10 April 2005.\n* Elements of 1st Battalion, 325th Air Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division for help with Afghan Elections.\n* 70th Engineer Battalion Bravo Company RCP 6  2007-2008\n* Elements of B CO 1/158th Inf.
