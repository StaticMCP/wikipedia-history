After the fall of the Qin dynasty in 206 BC, Xiang Yu divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms. Shen Yang was appointed by Xiang Yu as the King of Henan and granted part of the former Hán kingdom's territory as his domain. In 205 BC, Shen Yang surrendered to Liu Bang and his kingdom became the Henan Commandery of the Hàn Empire.\nReferences\n*"
