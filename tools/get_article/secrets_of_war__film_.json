The two twelve-year-old boys Lambert and Tuur are best friends, although Lambert's father sympathizes with the Germans and Tuur's family with the resistance. At first the boys don't tell anyone about the hiding place of a downed Allied pilot in a tunnel system that they found together. However, after Tuur discovers that families from the neighborhood are being deported in freight cars, he becomes radicalized. He finally understands that his parents and older brother are active in the resistance against the Germans. In Lambert, whose father has meanwhile been appointed mayor by the Germans, he begins to see a traitor. When Tuur flirts with his new classmate Maartje and turns his back on Lambert, Lambert reveals that Maartje's host family is hiding a pig from the occupiers. Little does he know that he is putting the lives of Maartje –- whose real name is Tamar and is Jewish –- and her host family in danger. When Tuur follows the arrested Tamar to Maastricht and is arrested himself, Lambert promises his father that he will join the Nazi youth if he gets Tuur out of prison. Shortly after Tuur's release, Maartje's host father, under torture, betrays the other members of the resistance. Although the entire village is surrounded by German soldiers, Tuur and his family are able to flee to Belgium via the tunnels. Lambert supports them in this by bringing them food and other supplies. The fate of Tamar and the other villagers remains unknown.\nCast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Actor !! Character !!
