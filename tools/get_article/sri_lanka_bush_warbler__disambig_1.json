It is monotypic. The species is named after the collector Captain Edward Palliser (1826-1907). Edward and his brother Fred Palliser were both collectors in Sri Lanka. The species was described by Kelaart but published by Edward Blyth in 1851.\nDistribution\nThe Sri Lanka bush warbler is a bird of dense forest undergrowth, often close to water. It is found in the highlands of central Sri Lanka, usually above 1200 m. The nest is built in a shrub, and two eggs are laid.\nDescription\nThis is a medium-large warbler at 14&nbsp;cm. The adult has a plain brown back, pale grey underparts, a broad tail and short wings. There is a weak supercilium, and the throat is tinged orange. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds lack the throat colouration.\nThe Sri Lanka bush warbler is a skulking species which can be very difficult to see. Perhaps the best site is Horton Plains National Park. It keeps low in vegetation and, like most warblers, it is insectivorous.\nMales are often only detected by the loud song, which has an explosive queet.\nReferences\n* Warblers of Europe, Asia and North Africa by Baker,\n* Birds of India by Grimmett, Inskipp and Inskipp,\n* A Field Guide to the Birds of the Indian Subcontinent'' by Kazmierczak and van Perlo,"
