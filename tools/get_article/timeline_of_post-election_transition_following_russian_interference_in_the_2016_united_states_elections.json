Later, Papadopoulos says he declined the offer because he knew it was unethical and possibly illegal, and feared it might have been an FBI setup.\n** Page submits an application to the Trump transition team for a position in the new administration. The team never responds.\n** Google searches for election results return as the top search result an alleged news story based upon tweets that claims Trump won the popular vote, contradicting the results displayed above it on the results page.

They discuss Syria, and Kislyak suggests that Russian generals brief the transition team over a secure line. Flynn says the transition team doesn't have one, and Kushner asks if they can use the secure facilities in the Russian Embassy. Kislyak rejects the idea.

The meeting is first reported in March 2017, and attracts the interest of federal and congressional investigators in May. Kushner later characterizes the meeting as brief and meaningless.

Nader had introduced Dmitiev to Gerson in early December. Gerson responds that confidentiality is required before the new administration takes power. He says he will reach out to Kushner and Flynn to find out who the \"key person or people\" are that Dmitriev should meet with. Dmitriev tells Gerson he was tasked by Putin to develop and execute a reconciliation plan between the U.S. and Russia. In June 2018, Gerson tells Mueller's team that he engaged with Dmitriev as a private citizen and not on behalf of the transition team.\n* December 15:\n** Clinton tells a group of donors in Manhattan that Russian hacking was ordered by Putin \"because he has a personal beef against me\" due to her accusation in 2011 that Russian parliamentary elections that year were rigged.

Flynn consults with the Trump transition team, then speaks with Kislyak by telephone to request that Russia not escalate matters in response to Obama's actions. Flynn later pleads guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak regarding the new sanctions. In December 2017, McFarland tells Mueller's team that Flynn said that Russia will not escalate in response to the sanctions because they want a good relationship with the new administration.\n** Obama also amends Executive Order 13964 to authorize sanctions on individuals who interfere in U.S. elections. The amended order enables sanctions on the GRU, the FSB, the Special Technology Center, Zor Security, the Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems, GRU Chief Igor Valentinovich Korobov, GRU Deputy Chief Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov, GRU First Deputy Chief Igor Olegovich Kostyukov, GRU First Deputy Chief Vladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev, hacker Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, and hacker Aleksey Alekseyevich Belan.\n** Before Flynn's call to Kislyak, K. T. McFarland emails other Trump transition officials saying that Flynn will be speaking to Kislyak to try to prevent a cycle of retaliation over the newly imposed sanctions. The email is forwarded to Flynn, Reince Priebus, Bannon, and Sean Spicer. Trump, Bannon, Spicer, Priebus, and other transition team members are briefed about the new sanctions, and the upcoming Flynn-Kislyak call is discussed. In December 2017, McFarland tells Mueller's team that Trump wanted to use the sanctions as leverage against Russia.\n** The NCCIC releases a joint analysis report (JAR) titled \"GRIZZLY STEPPE – Russian Malicious Cyber Activity\" as a follow-up to the October 7, 2016, joint statement on election security. The report describes methods used by Russian intelligence groups APT29 and APT28 to penetrate election-related servers. It is the first JAR that attributes cyber activity to a specific country.\n** The Steele dossier is added to the forthcoming Intelligence Community Assessment at the insistence of the FBI over objections from the CIA. The FBI wants the material interwoven into the document, but the CIA strongly objects because of unknown sourcing in the dossier, so it is appended as \"Annex A\".\n** The NSA first learns of the Steele dossier when reviewing a draft of the forthcoming Intelligence Community Assessment that includes it as \"Annex A\".\n* December 30:\n** Putin announces he will not retaliate against the U.S. expulsions, contrary to recommendations from Lavrov. In reply, Trump tweets \"Great move on delay (by V. Putin) – I always knew he was very smart!\" This action is widely interpreted as praising Putin's actions.\n** Flynn texts a summary of his Kislyak call to McFarland, who forwards the information by email to Kushner, Bannon, Priebus, and other transition team members. The text and email deliberately omit the sanctions discussion because Flynn doesn't want it documented due to its political sensitivity.\n* December 31: Kislyak calls Flynn to tell him that Russia has decided not to retaliate based upon Flynn's request. Afterward, Flynn tells senior members of the transition team, including Bannon, about his conversations with Kislyak and Russia's decision not to escalate.\nJanuary 2017\n* January:\n** McGahn researches the Logan Act and federal laws related to lying to federal investigators.

While the report says Russian hackers did not change votes, it ignores the security of back-end election systems. Putin was personally involved in the Russian interference, per a CIA stream of intelligence.\n** Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, NSA Director Michael S. Rogers, and FBI Director James Comey travel to Trump Tower in New York City to brief Trump and senior members of the transition team on the classified version of the ODNI report on Russian interference in the election. They show Trump the intelligence behind their assessment, including human sources confirming Putin's role, and American, British, and Dutch intelligence services seeing stolen DNC documents in Russian military networks. In addition to Trump, the other people present are incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, incoming CIA Director Mike Pompeo, incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. After the briefing, Comey stays behind to privately brief Trump on the salacious allegations in the Steele dossier. While cordial during the briefings, Trump still refuses to accept the intelligence on Russian interference. The meeting unsettles Comey and prompts him to write a memo documenting the conversation.\n** Trump is briefed on highly classified intelligence — including from a top-secret source close to Putin — indicating that Putin had personally ordered cyberattacks to influence the 2016 American election.\n** Vekselberg's cousin and Columbus Nova CEO Andrew Intrater donates $250,000 to the Trump inaugural fund.

The next day, Nader assures Dmitriev that Prince wields enough influence in the Trump team to be worth meeting and was designated by Bannon for the trip. In 2018 Nader tells Mueller's team that Prince led him to believe that Bannon was aware of the Dmitriev meeting, and, separately, Prince tells them it was fair for Nader to think he was representing the transition team, but Bannon tells them that Prince didn't inform him of the meeting in advance.\n* January 9:\n** Cohen and Vekselberg meet at Trump Tower to discuss their mutual desire to improve Russia's relationship with the U.S. under the Trump administration. After Trump is inaugurated, Cohen receives a $1 million consulting contract from Columbus Nova, headed by Andrew Intrater, who also attended the Vekselberg meeting.\n** Kushner is named Senior Advisor to the President.\n** Profexer, a Ukrainian hacker who is the author of a hacking tool described in the December 29, 2016, NCCIC report on Russian cyber attacks, goes dark. He turns himself in to the Ukrainian police and becomes a cooperating witness for the FBI. The Ukrainian police say he was not placed under arrest.\n** Dmitriev sends his biography to Gerson and asks him to \"share it with Jared (or somebody else very senior in the team) - so that they know that we are focused from our side on improving the relationship and my boss asked me to play a key role in that.\" He also asks if Prince is important or worth spending time with.\n* January 10:\n** In a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions denies communicating with the Russian government during Trump's election campaign.\n** BuzzFeed publishes the Steele dossier alleging various misdeeds by Trump and associates in Russia.

They meet in Nader's room for 30–45 minutes, then have a brief meeting at a restaurant on the Four Seasons Hotel property. After the second meeting, Dmitriev tells Nader he is disappointed that Prince didn't have more authority in the Trump team, and that he found Prince's comments to be insulting. Prince will claim in August that he scarcely remembers Dmitriev. Dmitriev's identity is revealed in November 2017, and Prince confirms the meeting in an interview with House investigators on November 30. The meeting was organized by the U.A.E. and reportedly includes talks of a \"back channel\" with Moscow to try to influence Russian policy in the Middle East, joint U.S.–Russian military operations in Syria, peace between Ukraine and Russia, nuclear non-proliferation, RDIF investment in the midwest, and a joint investment fund between RDIF and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. George Nader, an adviser to crown prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the U.A.E., facilitates and attends. In May 2018 Dmitriev suggests the meeting was more than a chance encounter. The meeting occurs amid a series of meetings of politically connected individuals from Russia, France, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa that are part of a larger gathering hosted by the crown prince.\n** Michael Cohen tells Sean Hannity on The Sean Hannity Show that there is no relationship between Russia and the people around Trump or the Trump campaign.\n** Politico publishes a report on its investigation into the involvement of some Ukrainian government officials in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including helping Alexandra Chalupa with her research and revealing Manafort's name in the Party of Region's \"black ledger\". The report concludes that the Ukrainian government is too fragmented and factionalized to perform an interference campaign of the scale attributed to Russian interference.\n** Trump asks Clapper, Comey, and other intelligence community leaders to publicly refute the Steele dossier allegations.\n* January 12:\n** \"Guccifer 2.0\" denies having any relation to the Russian government.\n** Deripaska's longtime American lobbyist Adam Waldman makes the first of nine visits with Assange in 2017 at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.\n** Manafort returns to the U.S. after meeting with Deripaska deputy Georgiy Oganov in Madrid, where they discussed global politics and \"recreating [the] old friendship\" between Manafort and Deripaska.
