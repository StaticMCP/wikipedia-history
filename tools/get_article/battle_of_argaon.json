In 1803, Nizam Ali Khan fell gravely ill, prompting Daulat Rao Shinde and the Bhonsale to invade his territories.\nBattle\nBritish forces, under the command of Colonel Stevenson and Wellesley, defeated the Marathas at the Battle of Adgaon. This victory allowed the Nizam to regain control of all Maratha claims in Berar, thereby putting an end to the Bhonsales' rule over the region. Nizam Ali Khan died later that same year, and he was succeeded by his son Sikander Jah, also known as Asaf Jah III.\nSee also\n* Second Anglo-Maratha War\nNotes\nReferences\n* |accessdate=17 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305153727/http://akola.nic.in/Gazetteers/maharashtra/places_Adgaon.html |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}\n*\n*\nExternal links"
