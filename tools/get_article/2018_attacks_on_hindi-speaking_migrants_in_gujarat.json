He worked at the ceramic factory at Dhundhar village near Himatnagar, Sabarkantha district in north Gujarat where the incident took place. He was arrested by the police next day. It angered the Thakor community which held protests across Gujarat.\nAttacks and exodus\nOn 2 October, a mob, allegedly led by Kshatriya Thakor Sena members, attacked on the migrant workers in a factory near Vadnagar in Mehsana district. The police arrested twenty people for rioting. The next day, Alpesh Thakor, a leader of Koli Thakor Sena and Indian National Congress MLAannounced fast from 8 October to seek justice of the rape survivor. Alpesh had reportedly demanded preference to local people in jobs in industries in the state while addressing the protest. He also accused the government of filing false cases against the members of his community and demanded their release.\nOn 3 October, an attack was reported in Chandlodiya, Ahmedabad. There were further incidents of attacks by the Thakor community and others on the migrant labourers and the factories employing them. By 7 October, six districts were affected including Sabarkantha, Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Patan, Banaskantha, Aravalli and Ahmedabad district, with first two being worst affected. The attacks were chiefly in industrial estates and industrial belts. On 8 October, there were attacks in villages near Vadodara also. No incidents of attack were reported after 9 October.\nThe attacks allegedly triggered exodus of the more than thousand labourers from Gujarat to their native states. The Director General of Police denied the exodus and attributed the leaving migrants to the upcoming festive season. Uttar Bharatiya Vikas Parishad, an outfit supporting north Indian migrants, claimed that around 20,000 people had left Gujarat by 8 October.\nGovernment action\nBy 8 October, total 55 FIRs were lodged and 431 people were arrested. Ten people were arrested for spreading rumours and hatred on social media. The Government of Gujarat provided security to more than hundred factories. Apart from State Police, seventeen companies of State Reserve Police (SRP) were deployed in the affected districts.\nThe Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) urged the government to restore the peace as the industries were affected.\nPolitical reactions\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian National Congress (INC), two major political parties in Gujarat assembly, appealed for peace and harmony. The opposition INC state chief Amit Chavda reasoned the rising unemployment in youth behind the anger and criticised the attackers. INC President Rahul Gandhi called the attacks \"completely wrong\" and attributed it to unemployment and shutdown of the factories.\nBJP blamed Alpesh Thakor and his outfit for the violence. Alpesh Thakor denied his involvement and appealed for peace to his community. He kept \"goodwill\" fast in Ahmedabad for a day on 11 October. The Government of Gujarat appealed to the migrants to return.\n}}\nIn July 2019, after Lok Sabha Elections, Alpesh Thakor joined BJP after quitting INC.\nYogi Adityanath and Nitish Kumar, the chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar respectively, spoke with Vijay Rupani, Gujarat Chief Minister for their concerns. Tejashwi Yadav, a leader of Rashtriya Janata Dal, criticised the Central Government led by BJP leader Narendra Modi who belongs to Gujarat, alleging that BJP/RSS had \"turned Gujrat into a nursery of hatred & violence against poor, dalits & minorities.\"\nSee also\n*2008 attacks on Uttar Pradeshi and Bihari migrants in Maharashtra\nReferences"
