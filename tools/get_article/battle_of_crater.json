After the mutiny of the Arab Armed Police and ambush of British troops by them, the Crater district in Aden was abandoned by British troops. The British then decided to enter Crater and retrieve the bodies of dead British soldiers.\nThe battle\nThe operation began on 3 July 1967 with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders commanded by Lt-Col Colin Mitchell (\"Mad Mitch\") performing a night invasion of Crater, which he termed Operation Stirling Castle, after the Argylls’ regimental headquarters. The enemy was taken totally by surprise, and effective resistance ceased. A particular sign of Mitchell’s confidence was his decision to order the pipe band to march down the main street of Crater, playing regimental tunes, for which the Pipe major was mentioned in despatches. British troops remained in Crater until the end of the Emergency.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131105091815/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Aden/opsstirling.html Operation Stirling Castle] at Britains Small Wars\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131021142116/http://www.rememberingscotlandatwar.org.uk/Accessible/Exhibition/232/The-Aden-Emergency-a-wee-drap-o-the-Crater The Aden Emergency] at Remembering Scotland at War"
