The cemetery was also called '''Potter's Field''' (name for paupers' grave), not to be confused with the Potter's Field at Hart Island, the Bronx. The cemetery was disestablished and newspaper reports at the time indicated the remains were to be moved to North Brother Island.\nMany unclaimed dead were buried at Potter's Field. At one time, mass graves were used at Potter's Field with large pits containing 100 burials.\nPotter's Field on Livingston Street\nThere was also a Potter's Field, considered a public burying ground, on the northwest corner of Livingston Street and Boerum Street in present day Downtown Brooklyn.\nReferences"
