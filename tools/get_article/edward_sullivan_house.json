This small,  story house was built around 1875, and is the best-preserved example of a 19th-century worker's cottage in the town.  It is three bays wide, with a side-gable roof, and simple vernacular Italianate styling.  It has almost no exterior architectural styling, except for a transom window and modest entablature over the front door.  The house is one of five owned by Edward Sullivan, a stonemason, and is located near St. Mary's Catholic Church, an area where many Irish immigrants sought to settle.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Winchester, Massachusetts\nReferences"
