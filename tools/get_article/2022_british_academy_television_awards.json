Located in the South Bank, fans were also allowed to gather on the Hungerford Bridge pedestrian bridges to watch the red carpet. As well as nominees and others from the television industry, celebrities including sportspeople and musicians attended the ceremony. There were also actors portraying Squid Game characters in red suits. It was hosted by actor and comedian Richard Ayoade, for the third time; Ayoade revealed that he always reads a novel at the ceremony to keep calm, and this year was reading one by John Updike.\nThe BAFTA Fellowship award was given to Sir Billy Connolly. He joked that he is \"such a happy man getting these good attendance medals now my career is out the window.\"\nActor Ncuti Gatwa, nominated for his role in Sex Education, had been announced as the fifteenth incarnation of The Doctor in Doctor Who, a much-anticipated casting announcement, shortly before the ceremony. He presented an award with co-star and fellow nominee Aimee Lou Wood, during which the pair joked about the casting.\nStrictly Come Dancing, specifically dancer Giovanni Pernice and actress partner Rose Ayling-Ellis, won the \"Must-See Moment\" award for a moment of silence representing Ayling-Ellis' deafness during their dance to \"Symphony\". In their acceptance speech, a British Sign Language interpreter joined them on-stage. It was reported that some viewers complained to the BBC that this accessibility measure was only brought on stage at this moment, rather than throughout the show. The ceremony was also held at the end of deaf awareness week, with Ayling-Ellis saying that the timing of the award could reinforce the awareness campaign's intention \"to educate people about how we can be more inclusive for deaf people all year round, because we're deaf all the time.\"\nCelebrity chef Big Zuu won two awards, with his acceptance speeches being rambling and exuberant. Sophie Willan gave an \"expletive-laden\" acceptance speech. These were in contrast to some more serious speeches at the ceremony this year, including several referencing the COVID-19 pandemic as series about it won awards. Most acceptance speeches praised alternative public network Channel 4, following the government announcement that it is to be privatised. British Academy of Film and Television Arts chair Krishnendu Majumdar also gave a speech criticising the privatisation to open the ceremony; it also praised the television workers covering the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and called for more diversity.\nIn Memoriam\n* Bamber Gascoigne CBE\n* Janice Long\n* Tom O'Connor\n* Lionel Blair\n* Gwyneth Guthrie\n* Jimmy Greaves MBE\n* Gerald Sinstadt\n* Geoff Hill\n* Betty White\n* Chelsie Whibley\n* Lynda Baron\n* Sir Antony Sher KBE\n* Tony Selby\n* Beryl Vertue CBE\n* David Frank\n* Una Stubbs\n* Anna Karen\n* Ben Roberts\n* George Rossi\n* Michael K.
