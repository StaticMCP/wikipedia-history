The President of the party was Dr Khan Sahib, Chief Minister of West Pakistan. The main instigator behind this development was Iskander Mirza, the then President of Pakistan. He was the vice president of this party. The Central Parliamentary Leader was Sir Feroz Khan Noon, Prime Minister of Pakistan (1957 - 1958).\nParty leaders\nPunjab\nNawab Muzaffar Ali Khan Qizilbash, Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry (Gujrat District), Syed Amjad Ali (Lahore District), Sardar Abdul Hamid Khan Dasti (Muzaffargarh District), Col.

Civil servants advocated for a stronger central government in the West Pakistan province. Many of the Republican Party’s Military and Civil aligned factions opposed the Islamic right-wing ideology and advocated for Secular forms of government, but at the same time, being a offshoot party of the Conservative Muslim League, the party leaned to the Centre-right.\nOne Unit Scheme\nThe Republican Party's whole founding ideology differed from the ideology of the Muslim League. The Republican Party wished to establish an independent West Pakistan province. The hope was for a better sense of unity throughout the country, just as the way East Pakistan was one province. The One Unit Scheme would unite the provinces of Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas into one province known as the West Pakistan province, the One Unit Scheme ideology of removing inequality between East and West Pakistan by promoting the One Unit program was founded by several statesmen mainly from the Republican Party, and under Mohammad Ali Bogra.\nState leaders\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center; background:#white;\" colspan=\"4\" |  President of Pakistan\n|-\n!
