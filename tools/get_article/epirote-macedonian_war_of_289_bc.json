Outnumbered, Pyrrhus withdrew.\nConflict\nIn 289 BC Pyrrhus was betrayed by his second wife Lanassa, who left him and fled to Corcyra with her dowry, giving herself and the city to Demetrius I who sailed to the city, taking it. After returning from Corcyra, Demetrius planned to invade Epirus. Before invading Epirus, Demetrius planned to defeat the Aetolian League, a close ally to Pyrrhus, however the Aetolians, not seeking battle, retreated to the nearby hills. Seeing this, Demetrius left his best general Pantauchus together with 11,000 to engage with the Aetolians while Demetrius himself began marching to Epirus. Pyrrhus gathered the Epirote army consisting of 20,000–25,000 men and marched to Aetolia.\nBattle of Aetolia\nWhile Demetrius had now reached Epirus and began raiding the region, Pantauchus and Pyrrhus passed through each other while being on separate roads. Pantauchus, according to some sources challenged Pyrrhus to a duel which he accepted. During the duel, while hurling spears at each other, Pyrrhus was lightly injured while Pantauchus was seriously injured. After this duel, the \"motivated\" Epirote army charged and defeated the Macedonian army killing many and capturing 5,000 as prisoners of war. Upon hearing about the defeat, Demetrius withdrew from Epirus, while Pyrrhus set free his prisoners.\nPyrrhus's Macedonian Campaign\nIn 289 BC, after receiving news that Demetrius was ill, Pyrrhus launched a campaign in Macedonia. Initially he planned to raid and pillage Macedonian settlements, however due to facing no resistance as Demetrius was not able to raise an army, the Epirote forces penetrated all the way to the old Macedonian capital of Aegae. When Demetrius was well enough to raise an army, Pyrrhus, outnumbered, retreated back to Epirus.\nAftermath\nPlanning to invade Asia, Demetrius made peace with Pyrrhus, giving the Epirotes land in Macedonia while keeping Corcyra and Lanassa for himself and ensuring Pyrrhus's neutrality during his Asian campaign.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
