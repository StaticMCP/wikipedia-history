It is currently headed by Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, a Republican, who was reelected to a 3rd term in 2022. There are multiple divisions in the Texas Department of Agriculture.\nHistory\nTDA was established by the 13th Texas Legislature in 1907.  TDA is headed by the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, one of four heads of state agencies which is elected by statewide ballot (and the only one where the provision for statewide election is mandated by legislative action, not enshrined in the Texas Constitution) for a four-year term, concurrent with the gubernatorial election (prior to 1978, the term was two years before a statewide amendment in 1974 extended it to four years). John C. White is the longest-serving Agriculture Commissioner in Texas history, with 26 years of service (1951–1977).\nThe department consists of twelve different district offices in places such as Amarillo, Beaumont, Brenham, Dallas, Houston, Lubbock, Odessa, San Antonio, San Juan, Stephenville, Tyler, and Vernon. Previous to its establishment by legislation of the Thirteenth Legislature in 1907, agriculture in Texas was overlooked by the Bureau of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History, which notably ignored its responsibility of keeping any official statistics of agriculture and livestock in Texas. Robert Teague Milner was appointed as commissioner until the 1908 election could be held, during which he established a new agency with specific department duties. These duties included gathering statistics, publishing agricultural information, and holding farmers' institutes to promote advanced farming methods and practices. Milner's agency laid down the foundation for what the Texas Department of Agriculture does today.\nIn order to expand promotional marketing and bring about consumer awareness to agricultural products, the Texas Legislature established the GO TEXAN program in 1999, which expanded markets through eligible participants who were matched to promotional programs provided by the Texas Department of Agriculture.\nThe department is headquartered on the 11th floor of the Stephen F. Austin State Office Building at 1700 North Congress Avenue in Austin.\nThe mission statement of the Texas Department of Agriculture is: \"Partner with all Texans to make Texas the nation's leader in agriculture, fortify our economy, empower rural communities, promote healthy lifestyles, and cultivate winning strategies for rural, suburban and urban Texas through exceptional service and the common threads of agriculture in our daily lives.\"\nStatistics\nThere are a total of 230,662 farms in texas alone, 389 farms are USDA certified organic farms. There are about 125.5 million acres of farmland, 89% of Texas farms are operated by families and individuals. About 6% of farms are operated by partnerships along with 4% of farms being operated by corporations.\nCommissioners of the Texas Department of Agriculture\nMilner was appointed as Commissioner prior to the first statewide election in 1908.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
