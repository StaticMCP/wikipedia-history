      "text": "# Somebody's Knocking at Your Door\n\n\"'''Somebody's Knocking at Your Door\", sometimes given as \"Somebody's Knocking\" and \"Somebody's Knockin ' at Yo' Door'''\", is a spiritual. The song's music and text has no known author, but originated among enslaved African Americans on Plantation complexes in the Southern United States sometime in the early 19th century.\nPublications and arrangements\n\"Sombebody's Knocking at Your Door\" has been published numerous times; including publication within 54 different hymnals catalogued at Hymnary.org. The Hampton Institute (now Hampton University), a historically black college included the spiritual in its 1874 anthology of spirituals edited by Thomas P. Fenner, Religious Folk Songs of the Negro: As Sung on the Plantations, which was subsequently republished in 1909. John Wesley Work Jr., director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers of Fisk University, created one of the earliest known choral arrangements of the spiritual that was written sometime in the first years of the 20th century. Because he never registered a copyright, he lost claim to the rights of this arrangement. John Bunyan Herbert wrote an arrangement for men's chorus which was published in Rodeheaver Collection for Male Voices: One Hundred and Sixty Quartets and Choruses for Men (1916).\nOne of the more well known arrangements of the spiritual for solo voice dates to the year 1919. It was written by the Canadian-American composer Robert Nathaniel Dett. Dett's arrangement for solo voice was popularized by Edward Boatner who sang the arrangement in concerts and church services throughout the United States. Dett also wrote SSA (1921) and SATB (1939) choral arrangements of \"Somebody's Knocking at Your Door\". Norman L. Merrifield (1906-1977) published a men's chorus arrangement in 1942, and Clarence Cameron White published a mixed chorus arrangement in 1955.\nLyrics\nSomebody's knockin' at your door;\nSomebody's knockin' at your door;\nO sinner, why don't you answer?\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nKnocks like Jesus,\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nKnocks like Jesus,\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nO sinner, why don't you answer?\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nCan't you hear him?\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nCan't you hear him?\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nO sinner, why don't you answer?\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nJesus calls you,\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nJesus calls you,\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nO sinner, why don't you answer?\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nCan't you trust him?\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nCan't you trust him?\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nO sinner, why don't you answer?\nSomebody's knockin' at your door.\nRecordings\n*Sung by Edna Thomas on 78 rpm, coupled with ''Rock O' My Soul (1924), Columbia Records\n*Sung by Edna Lewis on the album I Been Buked and I Been Scorned; Gwine-a Lay Down Mah Life for Mah Lawd/Somebody's Knockin' at Your Door!
