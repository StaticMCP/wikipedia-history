It was formed in March 1952 and in August designated as a light division of the national defense force. It was the second PRC infantry division numbered 49; the previous 49th Division had been disestablished in 1950–51.\nThe division was organized from units and detachments of the 5th Army Group left in Guizhou province.\nThe division was composed of:\n*145th Infantry Regiment;\n*146th Infantry Regiment (former 137th);\n*147th Infantry Regiment (former 141st);\n*307th Artillery Regiment.\nFrom April 1955 the division was put under the Kunming Military Region's control.\nFrom June 1957 the division was transferred to the Chengdu Military Region's control, but the division returned to the Kunming MR in May 1958.\nFrom April 1960 the division was renamed as the 49th Army Division ().\nFrom August 1967 to 1968, Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, 49th Army Division was deployed to North Vietnam for air defense missions.\nIn November 1969, the division was transferred to the newly formed 11th Army Corps and later redesignated as the 31st Army Division ().

PLA forces were estimated to outnumber the size of PAVN ones. The PLA 40th Division of the 14th Army crossed the border section to the west of the Lô River, while the 31st Division took Hill 1200 on the eastern bank.\nIn October 1985, the division was transferred to the 14th Army and renamed the 31st Motorized Infantry Division (), as a southern motorized infantry division. Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, 31st Motorized Infantry Division was established.\nIn 1998, the 91st Infantry Regiment merged with the 18th Tank Regiment, 5th Tank Division as the Armored Regiment, 31st Motorized Infantry Division.

Both brigades are now part of the PLA 75th Group Army, stationed in Dali, Yunnan.\nReferences\n*中国人民解放军各步兵师沿革，http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_a3f74a990101cp1q.html\n*"
