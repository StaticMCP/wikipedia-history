He was apprenticed to the London architect George Maddox and by 1847 was in partnership with his father. The partnership continued until his father's death in 1856. Edward Browning qualified as an ARIBA on 22 March 1847. Their architectural practice was at No.16, Broad Street, Stamford. He held a number of ecclesiastical appointments as an architect and surveyor. These included the position of Architect and Surveyor for Dean and Chapter of Peterborough Cathedral for the Cathedral Precincts and surveyor of Ecclesiastical Dilapidations for the Archdeaconry of Oakham, which he resigned in 1882 due to ill health. Browning served as Mayor of Stamford in 1862-3 and gave the town its gold mayoral chain.  He was after 1870 an auditor for the Midland Bank.  The Stamford architect Joseph Boothroyd Corby was a pupil of Browning and the architectural practice was continued by J. C. Traylen.\nApart from the Marquess of Exeter at Burghley House, Edward Browning also worked extensively for a number of the leading aristocratic and landed families in Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire and elsewhere. He took over from his father Bryan Browning with work at Apethorpe Palace for the 12th Earl of Westmorland, and, apart from Apethorpe, designed estate housing, farms and other building at King's Cliffe. For the Marquis of Huntly he added a major extension to Orton Hall near Peterborough. For the Duke of Buccleuch, whose main residence was at Boughton House, he designed a large house at Millwood in Dalton in Furness, in Cumbria. In Essex he undertook a re-modelling of Barrington Hall in Essex for the Barrington/Loundes family. More extensive was his work for Lord Brownlow of Belton House and for other members of the Cust family, which included a number of schools and other buildings in the Grantham area.\nBrowning was married to Louisa Ann Fox on 12 September 1850 at St Michael's Church, Stamford, and they had 16 children.  On retirement he moved to London and died on 14 April 1882.\nWorks\nWith his father, 1848–1856\n*Stamford Town Bridge, St Mary's Hill /St Martins.
