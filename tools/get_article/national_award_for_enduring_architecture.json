The award recognises long lasting, innovative and culturally significant Australian architecture with usually more than 25 years passed since the completion of construction.\nBackground\nThe Award for Enduring Architecture recognises achievement for the design of buildings of outstanding merit, which remain important as high quality works of architecture when considered in the contemporary context. Nominations for the award can be made by AIA members, non-members and non-architects, but they must provide adequate material and information supporting a nomination for consideration of the jury. The Award also provides opportunity to recognise buildings that were not previously submitted into the annual awards programs.\nThe Award was initially called the  National 25 Year Award when it was established in 2003. In 2007 the award name was changed to the '25 Year Award for Enduring Architecture' later becoming the 'National Award for Enduring Architecture' in 2011. The American Institute of Architects has awarded a 25 Year Award annually since 1969. The ACT Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects inaugurated the first '25 Year Award' for architecture in Australia in 1995.\nState awards for enduring architecture\nThe Australian Institute of Architects national awards jury selects a national winner each year from a shortlist made of up to eight selected state and territory 'enduring architecture projects' from the AIA local chapter awards including;\n* Sir Roy Grounds Award for Enduring Architecture (Australian Capital Territory, started 1995)\n* New South Wales Enduring Architecture Award (started 2003)\n* Maggie Edmond Enduring Architecture Award (Victoria, started 2003)\n* Robin Gibson Award for Enduring Architecture (Queensland, started 2003)\n* Jack Cheesman Award for Enduring Architecture (South Australia, started 2005)\n* Tasmania Award for Enduring Architecture (started 2010)\n* Northern Territory Enduring Architecture Award (started 2013)\n* Richard Roach Jewell Award for Enduring Architecture (Western Australia, started 2015)\nRecipients of the state–based award are then eligible for consideration for the National Award for Enduring Architecture presented later in the same year, as part of the Australian National Architecture Awards.\nInaugural award, Sydney Opera House, 2003\nIn November 2003 arguably Australia's most well known building, the Sydney Opera House, designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon was acknowledged with the inaugural National Award for Enduring Architecture (National 25 Year Award) shortly after the 30th anniversary of the building's official opening on 20 October 1973. This acknowledgement followed the awarding of the inaugural New South Wales Enduring Architecture Award to the Sydney Opera House in July 2003 at the New South Wales Chapter Awards.\n}}\nThe move to recognition followed a long period of reconciliation with Utzon and plans for new work and restoration of the Opera House. The award also assisted in the process for UNESCO World Heritage nomination, eventually confirmed in 2007.\nList of National Award recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | National Award for Enduring Architecture (reverse order)\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Year !!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Architect!!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Project!!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Location!!style=\"text-align:left;\"|State!!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Year Built!!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Years Since!!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Other AIA/RAIA Awards\n|-\n| 2025 || Gregory Burgess||Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa Cultural Centre || Uluru Road, Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park||Northern Territory||1995 ||30 years  ||\n* Northern Territory Enduring Architecture Award, 2025\n* High Commendation, Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, 1995\n* Tracy Memorial Award, 1995 (NT)\n* New Institutional Building Award, 1995 (NT)\n* People’s Choice Award, 1995 (NT)\n|-\n| 2024 ||Donovan Hill ||C House||Cooparoo, Brisbane||Queensland ||1998 ||26 years||\n*Robin Gibson Award for Enduring Architecture, 2024\n|-\n| 2023 ||Gregory Burgess ||Brambuk: Living Cultural Centre (now National Parks and Cultural Centre)|| 277 Grampians Road, Halls Gap||Victoria ||1990 ||33 years  ||\n*Maggie Edmond Enduring Architecture Award, 2023\n* Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, 1990\n|-\n| 2022 ||Ken Woolley ||Woolley House (now Woolley Hesketh House)|| 34 Bullecourt Avenue, Mosman||New South Wales||1962  ||60 years  ||\n*NSW Enduring Architecture Award, 2022\n*Wilkinson Award, 1962\n|-\n| 2021 ||Kevin Borland, John and Phyllis Murphy and Peter McIntyre (with engineer Bill Irwin)||Swimming and Diving Stadium||Olympic Boulevard and Batman Avenue, Melbourne||Victoria ||1956||63 years  ||\n*Maggie Edmond Enduring Architecture Award, 2021\n* Building of the Year, 1956\n|-\n| 2020 || Richard Leplastrier||Palm Garden House|| Bilgola Beach||New South Wales||1984 ||36 years  ||\n*NSW Enduring Architecture Award, 2020\n|-\n| 2019 ||Philip Cox & Partners||Ayers Rock Resort(now Sails in the Desert)||Yulara|| Northern Territory||1984||35 years  ||\n*Northern Territory Enduring Architecture Award, 2019\n*Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, 1985\n|-\n| 2018 ||Hall, Phillips and Wilson Architects||Townsville Courts of Law Edmund Sheppard Building||31 Walker Street, Townsville||Queensland||1975 ||43 years ||\n* Robin Gibson Award for Enduring Architecture, 2018 (Qld)\n|-\n| 2017 ||Aaron Bolot||17 Wylde Street Apartments||17 Wylde Street, Potts Point||New South Wales||1951 ||66 years ||\n*NSW Enduring Architecture Award, 2017\n|-\n| 2016 ||John James & Associates||Reader’s Digest Building||Waterloo Street, Surry Hills||New South Wales||1967||49 years ||\n*NSW Enduring Architecture Award, 2016\n|-\n| 2015 ||Howlett & Bailey Architects||Council House||27–29 St Georges Terrace, Perth||Western Australia||1963 ||52 years  ||\n* Richard Roach Jewell Award for Enduring Architecture, 2015 (WA)\n|-\n| 2014 ||Ian McKay and Philip Cox Architects in Association||Tocal College (CB Alexander Campus)||815 Tocal Road, Paterson ||New South Wales ||1963 ||51 years ||\n*NSW Enduring Architecture Award, 2014\n|-\n| 2013 || Mitchell Giurgola and Thorp||Australian Parliament House||Canberra||ACT|| 1988|| 25 years ||\n*Sir Roy Grounds Award for Enduring Architecture, 2013\n*Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, 1989\n* Canberra Medallion for Architectural Excellence, 1989\n|-\n| 2012 ||Harry Seidler||Australia Square||264 George Street, Sydney|| New South Wales ||1967 || 45 years||\n*NSW Award Enduring Architecture Award, 2012\n*Sir John Sulman Medal, 1968\n* RAIA Civic Design Award for a work of outstanding environmental design, 1968\n|-\n| 2011 ||Glenn Murcutt||Magney House||Bingie Point|| New South Wales||1980 || 31 years ||\n*NSW Enduring Architecture Award, 2011\n* Robin Boyd Award, 1985\n* Wilkinson Award, 1985\n|-\n| 2010 || Department of Public Works (Architect Peter Partridge)||Supreme Court Complex || Salamanca Place, Hobart||Tasmania ||1975 ||35 years   ||\n* Tasmania Award for Enduring Architecture, 2010\n|-\n| 2009 ||Yuncken Freeman Brothers, Griffiths & Simpson;
