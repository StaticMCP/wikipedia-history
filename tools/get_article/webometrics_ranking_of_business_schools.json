The ranking is published by the Cybermetrics Lab, a research group of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) located in Madrid.\nThis ranking was discontinued in 2013 and is no longer updated.\nThis discontinued ranking is, however, often cited (as of 2017-06-16) by Google as its main ranking reference.\nExamples are: \"Spain business school ranking \" =  \"Zurich business school ranking\" etc.\nThe Webometrics Ranking of World Universities is a similar ranking of universities.\nReferences"
