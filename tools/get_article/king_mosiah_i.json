He was the father of King Benjamin and the first of two individuals in the Book of Mormon with the name Mosiah. His grandson, Mosiah II was Benjamin's son and was king of the Nephite nation from about 124 BC to 91 BC.\nAccounts\nThe history of Mosiah I is limited to Amaleki's account in the Book of Omni.\nFollowing a period of \"much war and contention between...the Nephites, and the Lamanites\", Mosiah1 was \"warned of the Lord that he should flee out of the land of Nephi, and as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord should also depart out of the land with him, into the wilderness\". The journey led them to the land of Zarahemla, inhabited by a group of people who had come from Jerusalem at the \"time that Zedekiah, king of Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon\". The two groups united and appointed Mosiah their king.\nMosiah I also translated engravings found on a stone which gave an account of the Jaredites, another people who had previously inhabited the area.\nReferences"
