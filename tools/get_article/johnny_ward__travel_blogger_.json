His family moved to Kilkeel, Northern Ireland soon after, and Ward largely grew up there. His family often subsisted on welfare during his childhood. Ward studied international economics at university in England, graduating in 2006.\nTravel and career\nAfter earning his university degree in 2006, Ward began his travels. His first destination was New York City where he spent a short time working as a summer camp counselor in the United States.\nHe returned to Ireland and took part in a medical research experiment to earn more money to travel. He then travelled to Thailand where he taught English for a year before moving to Sydney, where he worked as a telephone sales representative.\nDissatisfied with office work, Ward left his job and sought to make a living from travelling full-time. In 2010, Ward started a blog named \"OneStep4Ward\" to document his travels. During this period, Ward based himself in Bangkok, Thailand, and also began investing in property.\nBy August 2012, Ward had visited over 80 countries, and over 100 countries by the end of that year. In 2014, Ward was a founding member of the Professional Travel Bloggers Association. By 2015, he had earned a total of around $1&nbsp;million and had visited 152 countries. Ward has recounted entering several countries through questionable or illegal means; it was reported that he \"entered China illegally after a five-day trip up the Mekong River while stowed away in a cargo boat\", that he was arrested after paying a smuggler to take him from Liberia to Ivory Coast during the Ebola epidemic, and that he was able to enter Yemen during an ongoing civil war by meeting a dignitary who \"bribed Yemeni officials and I ended up hitching there on a cement cargo ship\". Shortly after arriving in Angola, Ward witnessed a person being shot only a few metres away from his taxi cab, which quickly left the scene.\nIn 2017, Ward visited his 197th and final nation, Norway, chosen because its proximity to Ireland made it convenient for friends and family to join him for the occasion.\nAdventurer\nWard has since declared his intention to be the first person to visit every country, plus visit the North Pole, South Pole, and climb the Seven Summits. He has since finished 8th in the North Pole Marathon, and summited Kilimanjaro, Puncak Jaya, Aconcagua, Denali, and Mount Elbrus. Ward completed the challenge, reaching the South Pole in January 2024. Alongside this, Ward has also completed multiple long-distance ultra-marathons ranging from 100&nbsp;km to 260&nbsp;km, and competed in the Marathon des Sables in 2019.  Ward is the founder of two annual endurance events: the Eye of the Sahara Ultramarathon, held in Mauritania, and the Highway to Hell Ultracycle, held in Turkmenistan.\nWard rowed across the Atlantic Ocean in March, April, and May 2021. He also spent 2 months attempting to climb Mount Everest in April and May and successfully summitted the world's highest mountain on May 17, 2023.\nTelevision\nWard is the host of Where Next with Johnny Ward, a travel series produced in Turkey and broadcast on TRT World. The first season, consisting of 12 episodes, aired in 2024 and featured Ward exploring different regions of Turkey, highlighting both well-known and lesser-visited destinations.\nBlog\nWard started his travel blog, [http://OneStep4Ward.com OneStep4Ward.com], in 2010 whilst living in Australia, and soon began making a full-time income blogging. His blog is often listed as Ireland's leading blog, and one of the world's leading travel blogs.\nWard was nominated for the 11th Shorty Awards for 'Best in Travel'.\nUltimate Explorers Grand Slam\nUpon reaching the South Pole on the 12 January 2024, Ward became the first person in history to complete the self-proclaimed Ultimate Explorers Grand Slam (climbing the seven summits, reaching both the North and South Poles, plus visiting every country in the world). Reportedly, around 1000 people have climbed the Seven Summits. Reports vary from 250 to 500 people having visited every country in the world, but no-one has yet completed the set.\nCountries visited\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Country total !!
