After the railroad closed down and the tracks were removed, all property owned by the railroad was returned to its previous landowners and several small communities built around the stops disappeared. Some houses still exist from the town, at the intersection of Beach Highway and Owens Rd, but most of the former town has disappeared.\nThe Owens Station Hunting Preserve takes its name from the former rail community.\nThe remains of the settlement, now called simply Owens, is an unincorporated community located on Delaware Route 16 east of Greenwood.\nOwens' population was 18 in 1900, and was 62 in 1925.\nReferences"
