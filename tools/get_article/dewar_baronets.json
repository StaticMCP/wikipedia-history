The first was created in 1907, for John Alexander Dewar, and the other in 1917 for his son Thomas Robert Dewar. Both were later elevated to the peerage, as Baron Forteviot and Baron Dewar, respectively.\nSee also\n*Baron Forteviot\n*Baron Dewar\nNotes\n\n---\n\n## Dewar Baronets\n\n#REDIRECT Dewar baronets"
