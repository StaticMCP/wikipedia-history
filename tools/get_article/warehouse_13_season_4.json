They encounter the mysterious Brotherhood of the Black Diamond while traveling to the small village of Richerenches, France. In the end, Artie uses Ferdinand Magellan's Astrolabe to reverse time by 24 hours to just a few minutes before the Warehouse was destroyed. Using Ganhdi's Dhoti to imbue Sykes with pure peace, Artie is able to stop the bomb and save the warehouse with Sykes hitting his head on the floor and dying in the process. H. G. and Mrs. Fredric are restored and Artie successfully argues for H. G. to be pardoned.
