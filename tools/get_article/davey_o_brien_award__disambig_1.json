The Davey O'Brien Hall of Fame is housed at The Fort Worth Club in Fort Worth, Texas. The annual awards dinner and trophy presentation is held there as well, usually in February.\nIn 1977, directly after the death of O'Brien, the award was established as the '''Davey O'Brien Memorial Trophy''', and was given to the most outstanding player in the Southwest. Texas running back Earl Campbell  won the trophy in 1977, Oklahoma running back Billy Sims won it in 1978, and Baylor linebacker Mike Singletary won it twice in 1979 and 1980. In 1981, the award was renamed the Davey O'Brien Award. Since then, only four players have won the award more than once: Ty Detmer of BYU, Danny Wuerffel of Florida, Jason White of Oklahoma, and Deshaun Watson of Clemson.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ List of Davey O'Brien Award winners\n!
