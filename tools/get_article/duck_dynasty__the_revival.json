It is a sequel to the popular Duck Dynasty series which was produced from 2012 to 2017 and inspired multiple spin-offs on A&E and other networks.\nThe new series centers on Willie Robertson and Korie Robertson, their adult children (including Sadie Robertson and John Luke Robertson), and their grandchildren in Louisiana. According to the A&E logline, \"With their dynasty expanding into more than just ducks, Willie and Korie will bring their signature humor and family fun as they grapple with mapping out the future of Duck Commander, watching the kids navigate marriage, children and businesses of their own, and passing down the family legacy.\" Other members of the family who were featured prominently on the original series will be part of the new one, including Kay Robertson, Si Robertson, and others. Phil Robertson, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2024 and died on May 25, 2025, will not be featured.\nThe series is produced by Wheelhouse Entertainment's Spoke Studios and Tread Lively Productions, which was founded by Willie and Korie Robertson. Two ten-episode seasons have been ordered.\nEpisodes\nSeason 1 (2025)\n| EpisodeNumber =1\n| EpisodeNumber2 =1\n| Viewers =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor =B3C1CF\n}}\n| EpisodeNumber =2\n| EpisodeNumber2 =2\n| Viewers =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor =B3C1CF\n}}\n| EpisodeNumber =3\n| EpisodeNumber2 =3\n| Viewers =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor =B3C1CF\n}}\n| EpisodeNumber =4\n| EpisodeNumber2 =4\n| Viewers =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor =B3C1CF\n}}\n| EpisodeNumber =5\n| EpisodeNumber2 =5\n| Viewers =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor =B3C1CF\n}}\n| EpisodeNumber =6\n| EpisodeNumber2 =6\n| Viewers =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor =B3C1CF\n}}\n| EpisodeNumber =7\n| EpisodeNumber2 =7\n| Viewers =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor =B3C1CF\n}}\n| EpisodeNumber =8\n| EpisodeNumber2 =8\n| Viewers =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor =B3C1CF\n}}\n| EpisodeNumber =9\n| EpisodeNumber2 =9\n| Viewers =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor =B3C1CF\n}}\n| EpisodeNumber =10\n| EpisodeNumber2 =10\n| Viewers =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor =B3C1CF\n}}\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
