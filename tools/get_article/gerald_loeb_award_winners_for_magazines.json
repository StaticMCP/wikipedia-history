The \"Magazine\" category is one of the two original categories awarded in 1958 (the other being \"Newspaper\"), with the last award given in 2014. The category included articles published the prior year in national and regional periodicals until 2008, when it was expanded to include magazine supplements to newspapers. Previously, newspaper magazine supplements were entered into an appropriate newspaper category. The \"Magazine\" and \"Large Newspaper\" categories were replaced by the \"Feature\" category in 2015.\nWinners (1958–2014)\n* 1958: \"Cooperation of Businessmen and Municipal Government\" by Werner Renberg, Business Week\n::He was awarded for his series on the maintenance and development of prosperous American cities through cooperation between municipal governments and businesses.\n* 1959: Ernest Havemann, Life\n::Article:\n:::[https://books.google.com/books?id=TlYEAAAAMBAJ&dq=What%27s+Happened+to+the+Business+Boom&pg=PA32 \"What's Happened to the Business Boom\"], January 6, 1958\n* 1960: \"Pricing Ourselves Out of the Market?\" by John A.
