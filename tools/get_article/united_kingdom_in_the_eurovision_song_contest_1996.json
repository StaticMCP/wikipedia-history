The lowest-placed seven songs would be eliminated and would not appear in Oslo. Gina G was placed 3rd with 153 points, thus qualifying for the final.\nOn the night of the final Gina G performed 2nd in the running order, following Turkey and preceding Spain. At the end of the voting it had received 77 points, placing 8th out of 23 contestants. The United Kingdom jury awarded its 12 points to Cyprus.\nDespite this result, 'Just a Little Bit' is one of the most successful of the UK's entries at Eurovision, not only topping the UK singles chart but also finding success in America, where the song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 1998.\nVoting\nQualifying round\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded to the United Kingdom (qualifying round)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 12 points\n| ||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 10 points\n| |||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 8 points\n| ||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7 points\n| ||||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5 points\n| |}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 point\n| ||}}\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded by the United Kingdom (qualifying round)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:gold\" | 12 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:silver\" | 10 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#CC9966\" | 8 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 point\n|\n|}\nFinal\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded to the United Kingdom (final)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 12 points\n| |}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 10 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 8 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6 points\n| ||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 points\n| |}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 points\n| ||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 point\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded by the United Kingdom (final)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:gold\" | 12 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:silver\" | 10 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#CC9966\" | 8 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 6 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 point\n|\n|}\nReferences"
