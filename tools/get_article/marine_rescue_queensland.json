The Queensland Fire and Rescue Service along with the Rural Fire Service would form the Queensland Fire Department, with a new central headquarters. On 1 July 2024 the Queensland State Emergency Service will be merged with the Queensland Police Service along with the Volunteer Marine Rescue and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard Queensland, which itself is to be renamed Marine Rescue Queensland (MRQ) and therefore made part of the Queensland emergency services.\nFacilities\nThe formation of the MRQ would merge 27 Volunteer Marine Rescue and 19 Australian Volunteer Coast Guard stations.\nEmblem\nThe Marine Rescue Queensland badge was designed to recognise the history of both the former Volunteer Marine Rescue and Australian Volunteer Coast Guard.\nLeadership\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
