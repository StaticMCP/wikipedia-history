Dewey of New York for president and Governor John Bricker of Ohio for vice president.\nBackground\nWhen the convention opened, Governor Dewey was the front-runner for the nomination. 1940 presidential nominee, Wendell Willkie again vied for the nomination, but when he lost the Wisconsin primary, the lack of support from the Republican Party became evident. (Before the election, Willkie would die of a heart attack.) General Douglas MacArthur withdrew his name from consideration in May.\nConservative opposition to Dewey coalesced briefly around Governor John W. Bricker of Ohio, but Dewey was the overwhelming favorite as the party's convention opened in Chicago in June.\nPresidential nomination\nPresidential candidates\nFile:Thomas E.

Dewey was nominated on the first ballot with 1,056 votes to 1 for MacArthur.\nDewey became the second Republican candidate to accept his party's nomination in-person at the convention. All subsequent Republican nominees have accepted their nominations in person with the exception of Donald Trump who in 2020 delivered his re-nomination acceptance speech from the White House because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Presidential Ballot\n|-\n!

This line was included in all subsequent platforms until 1980, when the debate over the Equal Rights Amendment was occurring.\nCultural impact\nDuring the convention, Chicago's Billy Goat Tavern gained notoriety for posting a notice saying \"No Republicans Allowed\". This caused Republican conventioneers to pack the place, demanding to be served, and led to increased publicity for the tavern.\nSee also\n* 1944 Republican Party vice presidential candidate selection\n* History of the United States Republican Party\n* List of Republican National Conventions\n* United States presidential nominating convention\n* 1944 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* 1944 United States presidential election\n* 1944 Democratic National Convention\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25835 Republican Party platform of 1944] at The American Presidency Project\n* [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=75627 Dewey acceptance speech] at The American Presidency Project"
