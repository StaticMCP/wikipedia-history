It was played twice, in 2003 and 2005 and took place on the World Cup course at the Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen, China. The event was organised by the Asian Tour and Japan Golf Tour. Asia won both events that were contested.\nFor sponsorship reasons, the 2003 event was called the Phoenix Dynasty Cup presented by VISA, while the 2005 event was called the Visa Dynasty Cup.\nFormat\nThe teams consisted of 12 golfers. The tournament was played over three days with 6 foursomes matches on the first day, 6 fourball matches on the second day, and 12 singles matches on the final day. One point was awarded for each win and a half point for a halved match. With a total of 24 points, a team needed to get 12.5 points to win the Cup.\nHistory\nThe inaugural event was held 14–16 March 2003. The non-playing captains were Hsieh Min-Nan and Isao Aoki. Asia won by a score of 16½ to 7½.\nThe second event was held 15–17 April 2005. The team captains were the same as in 2003, Hsieh and Aoki.
