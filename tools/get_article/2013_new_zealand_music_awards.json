The main awards event will be held on 21 November 2013 at Vector Arena, Auckland and will again be hosted by Shannon Ryan, along with new host Stan Walker. Nominations opened on 27 May 2013 and closed on 8 July 2013. Eligible works were those released between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2013. The ceremony will be broadcast on television channel Four, as will a red carpet special hosted by Drew Neemia and Sharyn Casey.\nThe technical award winners, legacy award recipient and the Critics' Choice Prize shortlist were announced on 22 October at the Pullman hotel, Auckland. The Critics' Choice Prize winner was announced at the Critic's Choice Showcase at the King's Arms bar on 6 November.\nEarly awards\nWhile most of the awards are presented at the main awards ceremony held in November, four genre awards are presented earlier at ceremonies of their field.

The Tui for Best Jazz Album was presented in March to Nathan Haines at the National Jazz Festival in Tauranga for his album ''The Poet's Embrace. The Tui for Best Pacific Music Album was presented to Aaradhna at the Pacific Music Awards in May for her album Treble & Reverb. The Best Country Music Song Tui was presented to Delaney Davidson and Marlon Williams for their album Sad but True – The Secret History of Country Music Songwriting Vol. 1 at the Gold Guitar Awards, also in May.\nIn addition, the three technical awards are presented at the ceremony on 22 October 2013.
