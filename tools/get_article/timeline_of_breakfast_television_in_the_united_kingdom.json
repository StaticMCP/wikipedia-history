Airing at 8:30am, YTV's programme is called Good Morning Calendar and Tyne Tees' programme is called Good Morning North. They are credited as being the United Kingdom's first breakfast television programmes, airing six years before the launch of full-time breakfast television.\n*1978\n**No events.\n*1979\n**No events.\n1980s\n*1980\n**24 January – The Independent Broadcasting Authority announces that in the next ITV franchising round it will offer a national licence for breakfast television.\n**1 December – BBC Scotland carries out a one-week experiment in breakfast television. It is a simulcast of BBC Radio Scotland's breakfast show Good Morning Scotland.\n**28 December – The IBA announces the results of the 1980 franchise round, which includes the winner of a national franchise to provide a breakfast television service on ITV. TV-am is awarded the contract to begin transmission in 1983.\n*1981\n** March – TV-am purchases a former car showroom in Camden as its headquarters. The building is subsequently renovated to create the Breakfast Television Centre.\n*1982\n** 3–9 October – As part of its coverage of the 1982 Commonwealth Games, the BBC broadcasts a two-hour breakfast programme Breakfast with Brisbane. The programme includes regular news summaries and comes three months ahead of the launch of the BBC's breakfast television programme Breakfast Time.\n*1983\n**17 January – At 6:30am, Britain's first-ever breakfast television show, Breakfast Time, launches on BBC1.\n**1 February – TV-am launches on ITV, with Daybreak and Good Morning Britain.\n**14 February – Following the launch of Breakfast Time, the Open University (OU) programmes previously shown on BBC1 on weekday mornings move to BBC2, resulting in the weekday early morning OU transmission on BBC2 being extended from 1 hour 15 minutes to 2 hours 5 minutes. BBC1 continues to broadcast early morning OU transmissions at the weekend until September 1992.\n**28 February\n***TV-am cuts its Daybreak programme to thirty minutes, allowing Good Morning Britain to begin half an hour earlier. Original Daybreak presenters Robert Kee and Angela Rippon are both replaced, with Gavin Scot (Weekdays) and Lynda Barry (weekends).\n***BBC1 begins broadcasting a 30-minute Ceefax slot prior to the start of Breakfast Time. It is called Ceefax AM. It is first mentioned in the Radio Times on 21 March.\n**18 March – Amid falling ratings and mounting pressure from investors, Peter Jay steps aside as TV-am's Chief Executive allowing Jonathan Aitken to take on the role.\n**1 April – Roland Rat makes his first appearance on TV-am. Created by David Claridge and launched by TV-am Children's editor Anne Wood to entertain younger viewers during the Easter holidays, Roland is generally regarded as TV-am's saviour, being described as \"the only rat to join a sinking ship\".\n**12 April – Timothy Aitken succeeds his cousin Jonathan as chief executive of TV-am due to the IBA rules regarding MPs operating a television station.\n**19 April – Angela Rippon and Anna Ford are dismissed from TV-am.\n**29 April – Michael Parkinson is appointed to TV-am's board of directors.\n**23 May – TV-am's new look starts.

Commander David Philpott is moved to weekends only, with Wincey Willis becoming the new weekday weather presenter.\n*1984\n**Bruce Gyngell is appointed as TV-am's chief executive. To make the company financially viable, he introduced cost-cutting measures which were brought sharply into focus in the Brighton hotel bombing. The night before the terrorist attack, TV-am sent the production team home as it could not afford to pay for hotel rooms and TV-am's response was limited to a caption of reporter John Stapleton reporting over the phone. Trade union agreements at the time meant that technical staff at the local ITV station TVS could not provide cover for another commercial television company, and TV-am's previous conflicts with ITN meant that the latter would not share its footage. The IBA told the company to invest and improve its news coverage, or it would lose its licence.\n** 4 August – The BBC broadcasts its very first weekend edition of Breakfast Time as part of its coverage of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games. For the duration of the Games, with the exception of news and weather, the programme was entirely devoted to Olympic coverage and the time difference meant that Olympic Breakfast Time was given over to highlights of the overnight action. Frank Bough presentes the programme with David Icke providing \"Olympic Action Summaries\" at 7.05, 8.05 and 8.50. The weekend editions saw news summaries are broadcast on the hour and this is the first time that the BBC has broadcast a full service of pre-lunchtime news bulletins at the weekend.\n** 13 October – TV-am launches a new Saturday morning children's series called the  Wide Awake Club. The live programme replaces pre-recorded shows such as Data Run and SPLAT.\n*1985\n**3 January – TV-am expands its broadcasting hours. Weekday programmes begin ten minutes earlier during the week, at 6:15am and weekend programmes begin at 6:55am.\n**18 February – Breakfast Time moves to a later slot, now running between 6:50am and 9:20am. Consequently, Ceefax AM is now on air for an extra 20 minutes each day, from 6am until 6:50am.\n**TV-am launches After Nine. It is only broadcast during term time as children's programmes are shown during the school holidays.\n**14 September – TV-am's Wide Awake Club is doubled in length, broadcasting for almost two hours from 7:30am until 9:25am.\n**3 October – Roland Rat, the puppet rodent who saved an ailing TV-am transfers to the BBC. With only a week until October half term  was due to start, TV-am launches Wacaday, a spin-off of the existing and successful Saturday morning programme, Wide Awake Club.\n*1986\n** 25 July – Selina Scott presents Breakfast Time for the final time.\n**10 November – BBC1 revamps its breakfast programming. Breakfast Time is relaunched with a more formal news and current affairs format. The programme now begins at the later time of 7am. Prior to Breakfast Time, BBC1 starts showing The Flintstones at 6:30am, reducing Ceefax AM to a 30-minute broadcast.\n*1987\n** July – TV-am reintroduces a weekday news programme, GMB Newshour, airing initially from the start of programmes until 7am. Good Morning Britain now airs between 7am and 9am.\n** 7 September – TV-am recommences broadcasting each day from 6am. This is the first time since 1983 that TV-am has transmitted throughout its allocated broadcast hours.\n**16 October – Following the Great Storm of 1987, electrical power to TV-am's studios is lost and an emergency programme has to be transmitted from facilities at Thames Television's Euston Road centre using reports from TV-am's own crews and those of ITN, TSW and TVS. The BBC's Breakfast Time, which would usually come from Lime Grove, was unable to broadcast as the studios were without power, as was most of BBC Television Centre at Wood Lane. The early part of the programme was broadcast from the continuity suite at TV Centre usually used for Children's BBC presentation as this area had generator support, before a larger studio was able to be brought into use.\n**23 November – The TV-am strike begins after members of the technicians' union the ACTT walk out in a dispute over the station's ‘Caring Christmas Campaign’. What is meant to be a 24-hour stoppage continues for several months when staff are locked out by Managing Director Bruce Gyngell. TV-am is unable to broadcast Good Morning Britain, replacing it with shows such as Flipper, Batman and Happy Days. By December a skeleton service that sees non-technical staff operating cameras and Gyngell himself directing proceedings, begin to allow Good Morning Britain to start broadcasting again.  The strikers are eventually sacked and replaced with non-union staff. Viewing figures remain high throughout the disruption, which continues well into 1988.\n**7 December – TV-am is able to switch from airing 100% pre-recorded material with the introduction of a 30-minute live segment each morning presented by Anne Diamond.\n**14 December – TV-am extends its live broadcasting to an hour a day.\n**18 December – Frank Bough, who launched breakfast television on 17 January 1983, presents Breakfast Time for the final time.\n*1988\n**14 January – Talks between TV-am's management and the ACTT begin aimed at resolving the ongoing strike.\n**25–29 January – TV-am airs a week of live broadcasts from Sydney to celebrate Australia's bicentenary, and featuring Anne Diamond and Mike Morris.\n**1 February\n***TV-am celebrates its fifth birthday, with Anne Diamond joined by Richard Keys, Gyles Brandreth, Su Pollard and Jimmy Greaves. It is the first time TV-am has been able to get its daily output down to an hour of pre-recorded material since the beginning of the strike. However, the station continues to air imports of old US shows for several more months.\n***The deadline on which the ACTT must accept TV-am's \"Ten Point Plan\" aimed at resolving the strike. However, the plan is rejected by a ballot and the union refuses to resume negotiations.\n**16 February – TV-am Managing Director Bruce Gyngell sacks the station's locked out staff, and calls a meeting of its remaining employees the following morning to announce that the ACTT will never again organise itself at TV-am's studios. His decision fails to resolve the crisis, however, as picketing continues and the quality of its output remains unchanged.\n**30 May – TV-am does not go on air, with its airtime instead taken up by coverage of ITV's ''Telethon '88''. The ACTT had asked its members to boycott the programme on this date, and fearful of sparking a nationwide dispute, TV-am's acting Managing Director, Adrian Moore, allows ITV to use the early morning airtime.\n**July – Stephen Barden is appointed TV-am's new Managing Editor. With the station facing criticism from the IBA over the quality of its output, he acts quickly to improve matters. Repeats of imported US programmes finally come to an end. New programming is launched, and programmes such as Frost on Sunday (off air since the strike began) are restored.\n**19 August – Following concerns about the quality of TV-am's programming, an emergency meeting of the IBA considers whether to review the station's franchise in early 1989. However, it is ultimately decided not to proceed with the review since the next franchise round is approaching, and the IBA feels the success of both organisations is mutually exclusive.\n** 17 September–2 October – Channel 4 broadcasts at breakfast for the very first time as part of its coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympic Games and the BBC resurrects Olympic Breakfast Time for the duration on the event, and this includes the return of weekend editions which, like in 1984, also includes hourly news summaries.\n**1 November – Having decided to step down from her presenting role on TV-am, Anne Diamond makes her final regular appearance on the station.\n**TV-am's GMB Newshour is relaunched as The Morning Programme.\n*1989\n**6 February – Launch of the Sky News flagship breakfast programme Sky News Sunrise.\n**3 April – Channel 4 launches its breakfast television show The Channel Four Daily.

The new programme adopts a rolling news format and starts 30 minutes earlier, at 6:30&nbsp;am. Most of the first 30 minutes is devoted to business news.\n**22 November – Following the commencement of televised coverage of the House of Commons the previous day, BBC2 launches a breakfast round-up of yesterday's proceedings. This is preceded by the 8am bulletin from Breakfast News. Previously, the only BBC2 breakfast output was programmes from the Open University. Open University programmes continue to be shown on BBC2 at breakfast, but in an earlier timeslot. The new programme line-up is completed by the introduction of the first peak-breakfast Pages from Ceefax broadcast with Ceefax shown between the end of the Open University transmission, or from 7:30am when no OU programmes are broadcast.\n1990s\n*1990\n**2 January – The weekday 6am Ceefax slot returns to BBC1.\n**17 April – The Channel Four Daily is revamped in a bid to attract more viewers.
