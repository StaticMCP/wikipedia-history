It confirmed the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca of 1774, wherein the Ottomans had ceded suzerainty over the Crimean Khanate to Russia. Yedisan (the territory between Dniester and Southern Bug rivers) was transferred to Russia, establishing the Dniester as the Russo-Turkish frontier in Europe, while leaving the Asiatic frontier (Kuban River) unchanged. The Ottomans also acknowledged Georgia (the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti) as a Russian protectorate.\nThe signing of peace was strongly influenced by the storming of the Ottoman fortress of Izmail by commander Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov-Rymniksky.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nReferences"
