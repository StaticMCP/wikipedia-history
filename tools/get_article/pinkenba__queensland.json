In the , Pinkenba had a population of 350 people.\nGeography\nPinkenba is a long narrow strip of land on the northern side of the Brisbane River, facing Moreton Bay,  from the Brisbane central business district. The area is spatially isolated from other residential suburbs and is bounded by the Brisbane Airport to west, Moreton Bay to the north, and the Brisbane River to the east.\nThe neighbourhood of Myrtletown is at the northern end of the suburb of Pinkenba ().\nThe neighbourhood of Bulwer Island is in the centre of the suburb ().\nThe former suburb of Meeandah, now a neighbourhood, is located () at the southern end of the suburb of Pinkenba.\nPinkenba has the following headlands:\n* Juno Point on Moreton Bay ()\n* Luggage Point (also known as Uniacke Point) at the mouth of the Brisbane River ()\nThe land use is mostly industrial except for a small residential area at the town centre.\nHistory\nPinkenba is situated in the traditional Aboriginal country of the Turrubal, who spoke a language within the Jagera language group.  The name Pinkenba was adopted from the local Turrubal placename , which means \"place of plentiful, or good hunting place for, land tortoise\", but, like Toowong, was used for a different location;  unlike Toowong, it was not in error: the Turrubal binkenba/Pinkenba had already been named New Farm 65 years earlier.\nThe former suburb of Meeandah took its name from the now disused Meeandah railway station on the Pinkenba railway line, which in turn was named after a corruption of the Greek word meander, and referred to Serpentine Creek which flowed through the area, but has subsequently been converted into a drain due to the development of Brisbane Airport. The name is often thought to be an Aboriginal word.\nBulwer Island was named after Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton who, as the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, separated Queensland from New South Wales in 1859. As the name suggests, it was originally an island in the Brisbane River which became permanently attached to the mainland through a land reclamation project in the 1960s.\nBoggy Creek State School opened on 22 February 1875. It was renamed Myrtle State School in 1888. In 1900, it was renamed Pinkenba State School. With student numbers falling to 6 students, the school was mothballed on 31 December 2008 and closed on 31 December 2010. It was located at 248 Eagle Farm Road, on the corner of Serpentine Road (). The school's website was archived.\nIn 1892, the opening of the Queensland Meat Export and Agency Company's meatworks in Pinkenba necessitated the establishment of a town where workers could live close to their work. On 15 October 1892, there was an auction of 40 allotments of land in the new town of Pinkenba. That land was bounded by the present-day streets of McBride Road to the west, Serpentine Road to the north, and Eagle Farm Road to the south-east ().\nA postal receiving office was opened in 1892, becoming Pinkenba Post Office in 1897. In 1969, it was on the north-eastern corner of Hopper Street and McBride Street ().\nOn Saturday 15 December 1900, auctioneers Isles, Love & Co offered 42 suburban allotments and seven farm sites for sale in the Cluya Road area ().\nIn 1902, a Baptist church opened in Pinkenba. Prior to the opening of the church, the Baptist congregation met in Harris's Hall. A stump-capping ceremony for the new church was held on Monday 11 November 1901. The church officially opened on New Year's Day, 1 January 1902.\nIn 1902, a spur line was built from Pinkenba to the wharf, to facilitate the movement of goods. In 1909, a separate railway wharf was constructed.\nPinkenba Wharf was the point of embarkation for many World War I soldiers. The Pinkenba & District War Memorial commemorates those from the district who served and died in the war. The memorial was unveiled on 16 August 1919 by the Queensland Governor, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams.\nPinkenba Presbyterian Church opened in 1915. In 1969, it was on the north-eastern corner of McBride Street and Esker Street (). It was demolished circa 1980.\nPinkenba Rail Post Office opened at the Pinkenba railway station in mid 1915 and closed in April 1954.\nBrisbane's first sewerage treatment plant was officially opened at Luggage Point on 23 November 1923. It was Australia's first full-scale sewerage treatment plant, a key component of Brisbane's sewerage scheme which commended in March 1914. It was serviced by an electric tramway.\nMyrtletown State School opened in 1924 and closed on 19 February 1971. It occupied the northern part of the block bounded by Main Beach Road, School Road (now Lewandowski Drive) and Sandmere Street ().\nSt Matthias' Anglican Church was dedicated on 14 February 1925 by Canon de Witt Batty. It closed circa 1981. It was located on the south-east corner of Hopper Street and McBride Road ().\nMyrtletown Methodist Church opened circa 1930. In 1969, it was on the western side of Myrtletown Road (now Main Myrtletown Road) between Rowlingson Street (no longer extant) and Priors Road (approx ). The church is no longer extant; its land is now part of the Brisbane Airport, just south of Qantas Hangar 3's carpark.\nQantas selected Pinkenba for its flying boat base in the 1930s. Until World War II, the other flying boat base, at Hamilton Reach, was too congested, but the Qantas base eventually moved upstream, providing better access for passengers.\nDuring the war, a Royal Australian Navy Defence Station was established, with the remains of the facility listed on the current Queensland Heritage Register.\nOn 6 March 1963, Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a roadside memorial at 315 Tingara Street (corner of Kirra Street, ). It commemorates the discovery of commercial quantities of oil in Australia at Moonie. The location was chosen because it was close to the site of the oil refinery which was to be built to process the oil. However, at the time of the queen's visit, The Canberra Times described the site as \"desolate\" and \"a smelly, muddy, mosquito-infested swamp\", but the site was planted with  high palm trees and flower beds and the area sprayed with insecticide in advance of her visit (which are no longer extant). The memorial was designed sculptor Rod Shaw of Narrabeen, Sydney. The bas relief monement reflects the cooperation between the United States and Australia in the search for oil though the imagery of oil workers handling a drill bit with flags of the two countries in the background. Although significant oil deposits had been found at Moonie, the  pipeline to Brisbane was not completed until the following year.\nBulwer Island Oil Refinery commenced with a major land reclamation project on Bulwer Island in the Brisbane River, which was then a tidal mangrove swamp. Over  of material was dredged from the bed of Brisbane River to connect the island with the northern bank of the river and to create a  site () raised to  above the high tide level. During its operation, it was the largest oil refinery in Queensland. It was decommissioned in 2015 and now operates as an import terminal.\nIn 1975, Myrtletown (then an independent suburb) was downgraded to a neighbourhood within Pinkenba. Myrtletown was historically known as a residential and farming locality, though maritime and industrial facilities have developed in recent decades.\n, two cruise ship wharves for Brisbane are located there, with differing facilities. Portside Wharf at Hamilton was completed in 2006 and is an international-standard facility for cruise liners, offering restaurants, coffee shops, gift shops, and other facilities. However, due to the height restrictions of the Gateway Bridge, and length restriction of  that far upstream, larger cruise liners must dock further down the river at the more industrial multi-user terminal at the Port of Brisbane. In late 2020, the new Brisbane International Cruise Terminal was scheduled to open on the northern bank of the Brisbane River at Myrtletown, opposite the port (), but its opening was delayed because of shut-down of the cruise industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The new cruise terminal is located at Luggage Point next to the Luggage Point sewage treatment plant (which has been renamed the Luggage Point Resource Recovery Centre). The new terminal will be able to accommodate the largest cruise vessels in the world. It will be operated by the port but will not be part of the suburb of Port of Brisbane (which is on the southern bank of the river).\nDemographics\nIn the , Pinkenba recorded a population of 350 people; 42.9% female and 57.1% male.

A railway  branch line to Pinkenba was constructed to encourage port development downstream away from the Brisbane central business district. The now-abandoned Pinkenba railway station opened in 1882 as the terminus of the line, and closed in 1993.\nOn the day of the 2011 census, 9.1% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 63.6% by car (either as driver or as passenger).\nSee also\n* List of Brisbane suburbs\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://queenslandplaces.com.au/pinkenba University of Queensland: Queensland Places:Pinkenba]\n*\n*"
