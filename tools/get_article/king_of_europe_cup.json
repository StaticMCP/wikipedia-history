The tournament was hosted at the Liverpool Olympia in Liverpool, England on 28 and 29 April 2007 and was the brainchild of two UK wrestling veterans Alex Shane and Doug Williams. In what was considered a historic event in British wrestling history, the tournament to crowned the KOE cup holder and involved 16 promotions and wrestlers from across the world.\nInteractive aspects\nThe following ideas were advertised on the web-site prior to the tournament, but were not implemented.\n*Prize fighting\nFor the first time in modern British wrestling, fans were given the opportunity to make voluntary donations for match of the night. This money was then added to a £1000 match of the night cash prize which was donated by event organizers, giving £500 a night for the best match on each day. Fans were given score sheets at the start of the show and were asked to put their top three matches from that night in order. The votes were collected and the three matches with the most votes were decided. The fan donated money was then added to the $1000 prize fund giving grand cash reward.\nThe participants who fans selected to have the best 3 matches each night then received the prize money at the end of each night with 55% for 1st prize, 35% for second, and 10% for third prize, improving the earnings of the wrestlers who give fans the best matches.\n*Match suggestions\nAt the end of night one, fans were asked upon leaving to select two matches using the eliminated 8 wrestlers from round one. Once again these suggestions were collected and the matches with the most audience votes were made for the following evening.\nQualification\nSome promotions handpicked wrestlers to participate in the King of Europe Cup, while others held qualifying matches to determine their representatives in the tournament.\nChikara\nChikara held a qualifying match to determine its representative for the King of Europe Cup and Westside Xtreme Wrestling's 16 Carat Gold Tournament.\n(American Legion Hall – Hellertown, Pennsylvania, U.S.)\n|match1  = Claudio Castagnoli defeated Mike Quackenbush\n|stip1   = King of Europe Cup and 16 Carat Gold Tournament qualifying match\n|time1   = 17:01\n}}\nInternational Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom\nThough involved with the pre-show, International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom was not originally scheduled to enter a wrestler into the tournament. However, this was changed in February 2007 when it was revealed that IPW:UK would in fact be entering Pac.\nInternational Wrestling Syndicate\nInternational Wrestling Syndicate held a qualifying match to determine its representative for the King of Europe Cup and 16 Carat Gold Tournament.\n(Bogey's World Bar & Billiard – Montreal, Quebec, Canada)\n|match1  = El Generico defeated Jagged and Kid Kamikaze\n|stip1   = Three Way Dance to qualify for the King of Europe Cup and 16 Carat Gold Tournament\n|time1   =\n}}\nPro Wrestling Guerrilla\nPro Wrestling Guerrilla held a qualifying match to determine its representative for the King of Europe Cup and 16 Carat Gold Tournament.\n(American Legion Post #308 – Reseda, California, U.S.)\n|match1  = Davey Richards defeated Rocky Romero\n|stip1   = King of Europe Cup and 16 Carat Gold Tournament qualifying match\n|time1   = 16:39\n}}\nReal Quality Wrestling\nReal Quality Wrestling's representative for the King of Europe Cup was determined through a one-night tournament for the vacant RQW Heavyweight Championship.\n(York Hall – London, England)\n|times=\n|stip1  = Singles match in the quarter-final round of the tournament for the vacant RQW Heavyweight Championship\n|match1 = Pac defeated Ashley Reed\n|stip2=Singles match in the quarter-final round of the tournament for the vacant RQW Heavyweight Championship\n|match2=Drew Galloway defeated El Ligero\n|stip3=Singles match in the quarter-final round of the tournament for the vacant RQW Heavyweight Championship\n|match3=Martin Stone defeated Iceman\n|stip4=Singles match in the quarter-final round of the tournament for the vacant RQW Heavyweight Championship\n|match4=Aviv Maayan defeated Jody Fleisch\n|time4=17:34\n|stip5=Singles match in the semi-final round of the tournament for the vacant RQW Heavyweight Championship\n|match5=Martin Stone defeated Aviv Maayan\n|stip6=Singles match in the semi-final round of the tournament for the vacant RQW Heavyweight Championship\n|match6=Pac defeated Drew Galloway via count-out\n|stip7=Singles match in the tournament final for the vacant RQW Heavyweight Championship\n|match7=Martin Stone defeated Pac\n|time7=10:38\n}}\nWestside Xtreme Wrestling\nAre$ qualified for the wXw spot after winning wXw's point system which saw any wrestler scoring a direct pinfall over another wrestler during one of wXw's shows was awarded one point; and whoever scored three points first would represent wXw in both this tournament and their own 16 Carat Gold Tournament.

According to him, the tournament had \"a number of excellent bouts\". He felt that \"The first night of the tournament seemed a little OTT with an assortment of finishers getting killed. It seemed in a few matches like it’d only end when someone was dead or in the case of Jody Fleisch, in hospital. That said night one contained some thrilling encounters and at the end a great and unexpected effort from Rhino of all people. The second night boasted some improved technical wrestling including a very strong final between Doug Williams and Nigel McGuinness. It’s a pity the semis were skipped over so quickly but the lack of filler meant the tournament needed a strong final and that was the only way to preserve it.\"\nThe Wrestling Revolution staff felt that the tournament featured \"some great, British-style wrestling, but mostly from just Nigel (McGuinness), Doug (Williams), (Chris) Hero, Claudio (Castagnoli), and Ares\" and \"The lack of DQ’s was a big surprise\". They praised the tournament final between McGuinness and Williams as \"an awesome match\", but \"nothing on this show was truly special\", as \"many of the matches feel the like the same match over and over, especially on night one\" and had \"just a whole bunch of enjoyable wrestling matches\".\nResults\n\"Taste of IPW:UK\" pre-show\nSeveral matches from International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom took place on the afternoon card before the tournament matches in the evening of both dates. The two-hour pre-shows were billed as containing no interval, but due to travel problems for Rhino, the day one pre-show actually had two intervals. These pre-shows gave one of the UK’s fastest growing independent companies a chance to be seen in front of their largest audience ever.\n)\n|times=\n|stip1=Tag team match\n|match1=The Untouchables (Dave Moralez and Jack Storm) defeated Sweet Justice (Blok Busta and C-Juice)\n|stip2=Singles match\n|match2=Dragon Phoenix defeated Claudio Castagnoli\n|stip3=Singles match for the IPW:UK World Championship\n|match3=Andy Boy Simmonz (c) defeated Spud\n|stip4=Two out of three falls match\n|match4=Pac defeated El Generico (2:1)\n|stip5=Singles match\n|match5=Martin Stone defeated Rhino via disqualification\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Fall:\n!Scoring Wrestler\n!Method\n|-\n|1\n|Pac\n|Pac pinned Generico with a cradle\n|-\n|2\n|El Generico\n|Generico pinned Pac after a Brainbustahhh!!\n|-\n|3\n|Pac\n|Pac pinned Generico after a modified Dragonrana.\n|-\n|Winner:\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pac\n|}\n)\n|times=\n|stip1=Tag team match\n|match1=The Untouchables (Dave Moralez and Jack Storm) defeated The Entourage (Mark Sloan and Ollie Burns)\n|stip2=Singles match\n|match2=Dragon Aisu defeated CJ Juice\n|stip3=Singles match\n|match3=Martin Stone defeated The Zebra Kid\n|stip4=Singles match for the IPW:UK World Championship\n|match4=Andy Boy Simmonz (c) defeated Blok Busta\n|stip5=Tag team match for the IPW:UK Tag Team Championship\n|match5=Swiss Money Holding (Ares and Claudio Castagnoli) (c) defeated The Dragon Hearts (Dragon Phoenix and Spud)\n}}\nKing of Europe\nThe results of the main King of Europe card for both days are as follows:\n)\n|times=\n|stip1=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup first round\n|match1=Chris Hero defeated Claudio Castagnoli\n|time1=14:18\n|stip2=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup first round\n|match2=Go Shiozaki defeated Martin Stone\n|time2=13:30\n|stip3=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup first round\n|match3=Pac defeated Trent Acid\n|time3=17:24\n|stip4=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup first round\n|match4=Matt Sydal defeated El Generico\n|time4=12:25\n|stip5=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup first round\n|match5=Doug Williams defeated Ares\n|time5=14:08\n|stip6=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup first round\n|match6=Davey Richards defeated Zebra Kid\n|time6=12:05\n|stip7=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup first round\n|match7=Ryo Saito defeated Jody Fleisch\n|time7=15:04\n|stip8=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup first round\n|match8=Nigel McGuinness defeated Rhino\n|time8=14:47\n}}\n)\n|times=\n|stip1=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup quarter-final round\n|match1=Doug Williams defeated Chris Hero\n|time1=16:34\n|stip2=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup quarter-final round\n|match2=Nigel McGuinness defeated Pac\n|time2=10:50\n|stip3=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup quarter-final round\n|match3=Davey Richards defeated Go Shiozaki\n|time3=15:51\n|stip4=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup quarter-final round\n|match4=Matt Sydal defeated Ryo Saito\n|time4=10:03\n|stip5=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup semi-final round\n|match5=Nigel McGuinness defeated Davey Richards\n|time5=6:51\n|stip6=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup semi-final round\n|match6=Doug Williams defeated Matt Sydal\n|time6=9:19\n|stip7=Six-man elimination tag team match\n|match7=Atsushi Aoki, El Generico and Martin Stone defeated Trent Acid and Swiss Money Holding (Ares and Claudio Castagnoli)\n|time7=21:42\n|stip8=Singles match in the King of Europe Cup final\n|match8=Nigel McGuinness defeated Doug Williams\n|time8=18:49\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Eliminated:\n!Wrestler:\n!Eliminated by:\n!Method:\n|-\n|1\n|Trent Acid\n|Atsushi Aoki\n|Submission\n|-\n|2\n|Atsushi Aoki\n|Ares\n|Pinfall\n|-\n|3\n|El Generico\n|Claudio Castagnoli\n|Pinfall\n|-\n|4\n|Ares\n|Martin Stone\n|Pinfall\n|-\n|5\n|Claudio Castagnoli\n|Martin Stone\n|Pinfall\n|-\n|Winner:\n| colspan=\"3\" |Martin Stone\n|}\nTournament brackets\n16 wrestlers, chosen or qualified from sixteen separate promotions around the world, faced off in a single-elimination two-night tournament, to ultimately crown the King of Europe cupholder.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061214004047/http://www.kingofeuropecup.com/ KingofEuropeCup.com (official site)]"
