      "text": "# Palm Dog Award\n\nThe Palm Dog Award is a yearly award presented by the international film critics during the Cannes Film Festival. Begun in 2001 by Toby Rose, it is awarded to the best performance by a canine (live or animated) or group of canines. The award consists of a leather dog collar with the term \"PALM DOG\". The name of the award is a play on words of the Palme d'Or, the festival's highest honor. In 2023, Woopets, a leading media company, announced that it had taken over the event from its founder, Toby Rose.\nBackground\nFirst reported in June 2002, the Palm Dog has been reported by major news outlets around the world, including Financial Times Deutschland, Sydney Morning Herald, The New York Times, the BBC, the Los Angeles Times, and ABC News. In 2012 the judges for the Palm Dog were The Times chief film critic Kate Muir, The Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin, The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw and Heat Magazine's Charles Gant.\nAward winners\n2000s\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
