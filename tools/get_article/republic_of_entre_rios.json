      "text": "# Republic of Entre Ríos\n\nThe Republic of Entre Ríos was a short-lived republic in South America in the early nineteenth century. Comprising approximately  of what are today the Argentine provinces of Entre Ríos and Corrientes, the country was founded in 1820 by the caudillo General Francisco Ramírez (who styled himself jefe supremo, supreme chief) and lasted only one year. On September 28, 1821, Lucio Norberto Mansilla was elected Governor of the Province of Entre Rios, and the Republic was subsequently dissolved.\nIn spite of the \"Republic\" in its title, Ramirez never really intended to declare an independent Entre Rios. Rather, he was making a political statement in opposition to the monarchist and centralist ideas that back then permeated Buenos Aires' politics.\nSee also\n*History of Argentina\n*List of extinct states\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Republic of Entre Rios\n\n#REDIRECT Republic of Entre Ríos"
