In the , the locality of Boonah had a population of 2,557 people.\nGeography\n, Dugandan and the town of Boonah, 2016]]\nThe town is positioned near the Fassifern Valley, McPherson Range and Main Range. It is surrounded by hills, including Mount French and other Moogerah Peaks. Frog Buttress is a popular rock climbing cliff on the north-west side of Mount French.\nThe Wyaralong Dam was constructed east of Boonah on Teviot Brook, a tributary of the Logan River. At full supply level, water would have inundated parts of the road connecting Boonah and Beaudesert, so a new section of road has been built. Water for the town is supplied from Lake Moogerah on Reynold's Creek, a tributary of the Bremer River. Maroon Dam is another reservoir built  south of Boonah at the base of the McPherson Range.\nState Route 93, a road with two names, runs through the locality, entering from the north as Ipswich–Boonah Road (Coronation Drive in the town) and exiting to the south as Boonah–Rathdowney Road (Yeates Avenue). Boonah–Fassifern Road (State Route 90) exits to the west from its junction with the other roads.\nHistory\nand Main Range (Great Dividing Range) of the Scenic Rim can be seen.]]\nUgarapul the Aboriginal language of South-East Queensland.the name and dialect of a clan that is used within the local government boundaries of City of Ipswich, Lockyer Valley Region and Somerset Region.\nThe history of Boonah township is connected to the nearby settlement of Dugandan which was named after the Dugandan pastoral run that was taken up in August 1844 by Macquarie McDonald and his brother Campbell Livingstone McDonald. Dugandan was one of the earliest pastoral holdings in Queensland. In its early years the area was stocked with sheep but the region was discovered to be well suited for cattle and over time became renowned for the quality of its beef and dairy herds. Adjacent to the property of Dugandan was Coochin Coochin station. In January 1861, a massacre of Ugarapul people, estimated to be as many as 40, is recorded in the area of Hardie's Station, Dugandan Scrub. In 1873, part of the Coochin Coochin pastoral run was acquired by Frederick Macarthur Bowman who named his property Denelgin. Frederick Bowman took advantage of the suitability of the area for cattle and is considered one of the dairying pioneers of the region.\nVariously known as Dugandan Scrub and Blumbergville, Boonah was also positioned within the boundaries of the early Dugandan property. Following the introduction of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868 and the subdivision of the large pastoral runs, the settlement fell within the boundaries of a new 320 acre property acquired by John Hooper in 1878.\nDue to the scattered distribution of European settlers, the close proximity of the two settlements that would eventually become the townships of Dugandan and Boonah and the lack of a clear geographical centre, during the 1870s–1880s the names Dugandan, Blumbergville and Boonah were used interchangeably. As late as 1888, the courts of petty sessions were described as occurring at \"Boonah, otherwise known as Blumbergville\".\nThe Dugandan Provisional School opened on 15 July 1878 between Dugandan Scrub and Dugandan Flats next to the Teviot Brook on land which would eventually fall within the boundaries of the Blumbergville/Boonah township. The school was the first building in the township. On 30 May 1887 it became Dugandan State School. In 1895 it was renamed Boonah State School. (A separate Dugandan State School operated between 1917 and 1966 in Dugandan).By 1880, 40 families were living in the Dugandan Scrub area and Blumbergville  was starting to be established. Blumbergville took its name from a store owned by three brothers, Max, Levi and Adolf Blumberg, located on the later site of the Commercial Hotel in High Street, Boonah.\nThe Fassifern railway line (Queensland's first branch railway line) opened from Ipswich to Harrisville on 10 July 1882. On 12 September 1887 the line was extended to Dugundan with Boonah being served by Boonah railway station in Yeates Avenue (). The line closed in June 1964. There is a memorial to the railway line in Yeates Avenue at the back of the Commercial Hotel (). The town takes its name from the railway station and is an Aboriginal word referring ether to the Bloodwood tree (Eucalyptus Corymbosa) or the Brigalow tree (Acacia harpadhylla).\nIn 1882, the Primitive Methodist Church congregation had grown too large to continue to use the Provisional School. Thomas Hardcastle donated  of land for a church on Old Mount Alford Road near the former Dugandan Bridge. There was a ceremonial cutting of the first sod on Saturday 23 December 1882 by Miss Jessie Hardcastle. The church was  and built by  George Beverley and T. Austin. It was officially opened on 4 November 1883. In 1892 concerns about flooding led to fundraising to relocate the church  to the southern end of High Street in Boonah (now the location of the manse). Eventually that church building became too small for the congregation so a new church was built at 9 Church Street () and was officially opened on Sunday 10 November 1907. In 1908 the old church building was relocated to Kalbar. Following the amalgamation of the Methodist Church into the Uniting Church in Australia, a new Uniting Church building was built at 10 Macquarie Street (). The church building in Church Street was sold to the Salvation Army and was subsequently sold into private ownership.\nAround 1884, the Blumbergville Post Office was opened.\nIn 1887, the railway line from Ipswich was extended to the area, with the name Boonah given to a rail siding at Blumbergville located one stop before the terminus at the settlement of nearby Dugandan. The railway siding took its name from an Aboriginal word from the Yuggera and Yugumbir language groups meaning bloodwood tree (Corymbia gummifera) or Brigalow tree (Acacia harpophylla).\nThe local government, the Goolman Division, had its office in Flinders, but the coming of the railway to Boonah resulted in the relocation of the Goolman Division to Boonah in 1888.\nFollowing devastating floods in 1887, the main commercial interests for the district relocated from the lower lying Dugandan, near the railway terminus, to the higher ground of Boonah.\nThe Post Office was renamed Boonah around 1888.\nChrist Church, a Church of England, was officially opened on 26 May 1890 by Archbishop William Webber assisted by Rev James Coles, rector at Harrisville. The church was designed by John H. Buckeridge. (the diocesan architect for the Anglican Diocese of Brisbane) and built by Mr Vincent of Boonah. Prior to the opening of the church, Church of England services were held in the Goolman Divisional Board office. At the time of the opening of the church, there was no permanent minister. On 7 July 1956 Archbishop Reginald Halse set a stone in the second church building being erected dedicating the new church as a memorial to the martyrs of the New Guinea Mission and those who died in World War I, World War II and the Korean War. The second church as dedicated in 1960 and consecrated in 1961. The original church continues to be used as a church hall.\nBy the end of 1900, the Fassifern Butter Factory owned by Mr. S. Dover was operating in Church Street. On 5 July 1916 a larger state-of-the-art factory with a separate office building, known as the Boonah Butter Factory  was officially opened on a new site on the northern entry to the town by the Queensland Governor Hamilton Goold-Adams. The Boonah Butter Factory closed on 1 March 1974 due to declining production as a result of low prices for milk and shifting agricultural practices in the region.\nMiss Esme Clarke's Private School opened in 1905 in a room was rented from All Saints Church. It closed in 1910.\nIn April 1905, John Carl Streiner opened his Commercial Hotel on the north-west corner of High Street and Park Street. It was a two-storey building with filigree lace balustrading on the upper verandah. Streiner had formerly operated the Royal Exchange Hotel (previously known as the Dugandan Hotel, not to be confused with the  current hotel of that name in Dugandan). Carl Behncken leased and operated the new hotel.\nThe Goolman Shire War Memorial was unveiled in Boonah (then part of the Goolman Shire) on 19 May 1920 by General Birdwood and Councillor Alexander John Tait McKay. It is generally known as the Boonah War Memorial.\nInitially only a primary school, Boonah State School had a secondary class added in February 1955, which it retained until 25 January 1965 when Boonah State High School opened.\nAll Saints' Catholic Primary School was constructed in 1956 using volunteer labour. It was officially opened on 4 November 1956 by Archbishop James Duhig. It was operated by the Sisters of Mercy until 1989 when it passed to the lay leadership of principal Kathleen Lambourne.\nBoonah was the centre of the Shire of Boonah local government area until council amalgamations occurred in 2008.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Boonah had a population of 2,484 people.
