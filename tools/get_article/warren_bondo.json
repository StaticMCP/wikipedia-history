He made his professional debut on 24 November 2020, coming in as a substitute for Dorian Bertrand in the 73rd minute of a 1–0 Ligue 2 defeat against Grenoble; however, he was sent off 14 minutes later. On 22 December of the same year, the midfielder scored his first professional goal, as he opened the score of a league match against Chambly, which ultimately ended in a 3–3 draw.\nOn 10 June 2022, Bondo announced his departure from Nancy, after deciding not to extend his contract, following the club's relegation to Championnat National.\nMonza\nOn 28 July 2022, Bondo joined newly-promoted Serie A side Monza on a free transfer, signing a three-year contract in the process. He then made his Serie A debut on 30 August, coming in as a substitute for Stefano Sensi at the 85th minute of a 3–0 away defeat to Roma.\nOn 31 January 2023, Bondo moved to Serie B club Reggina on a six-month loan. He played three games.\nHaving returned to Monza at the end of his loan, Bondo scored his first Serie A goal on 18 February 2024, a long-distance shot in a 4–2 win against AC Milan.\nAC Milan\nOn 3 February 2025, Bondo joined AC Milan by signing a contract until 2029.\nLoan to Cremonese\nOn 12 August 2025, Bondo signed a one-year loan contract with recently-promoted Serie A side Cremonese.\nInternational career\nBorn in France, Bondo could also choose to represent DR Congo or Congo Republic internationally, due to his family's origins. He has represented his native country at several youth international levels.\nIn June 2022, Bondo was included in the France national under-19 team that took part in the UEFA European Under-19 Championship, where the Bleuets reached the semi-finals before losing to eventual runners-up Israel.\nPersonal life\nBondo's father is from DR Congo, while his mother is from Congo Republic.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|National cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Nancy II\n|2020–21\n|National 3\n|6||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||6||1\n|-\n|2021–22\n|National 3\n|5||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||5||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!11!!1!!0!!0!!11!!1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Nancy\n|2020–21\n|Ligue 2\n|13||1||1||0||14||1\n|-\n|2021–22\n|Ligue 2\n|21||1||4||0||25||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!34!!2!!5!!0!!39!!2\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Monza\n|2022–23\n|Serie A\n|4||0||1||0||5||0\n|-\n|2023–24\n|Serie A\n|25||1||0||0||25||1\n|-\n|2024–25\n|Serie A\n|20||0||2||0||22||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!49!!1!!3!!0!!52!!1\n|-\n|Reggina (loan)\n|2022–23\n|Serie B\n|3||0||0||0||3||0\n|-\n|AC Milan\n|2024–25\n|Serie A\n|4||0||1||0||5||0\n|-\n|Cremonese (loan)\n|2025–26\n|Serie A\n|10||0||1||0||11||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!111!!4!!10!!0!!121!!4\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.acmonza.com/it/player/159/ Profile] at AC Monza\n*"
