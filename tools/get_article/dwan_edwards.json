He played college football for the Oregon State Beavers and was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the second round of the 2004 NFL draft.\nEarly life\nEdwards attended Columbus High School in Columbus, Montana. He lettered in football, basketball, and track and field, and also served as the senior class president. In football, he was a three-year starter, was a three time All-Conference honoree on both, offense and defense. In track and field, he placed third in the shot put and fourth in the discus at the District Finals.\nCollege career\nEdwards attended Oregon State University. He was a two-time All-Pacific-10 Conference selection, and finished his career with 12.5 sacks, 159 tackles (30 for a loss), three fumble recoveries, two forced fumbles, and three pass deflections. He graduated in 2003 with a degree in business administration.\nProfessional career\nBaltimore Ravens\nEdwards was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the second round (51st overall) in the 2004 NFL draft. In his rookie season, he played in four games at defensive tackle and finished the season with four tackles. He made his NFL debut in the opening game of the season on September 12 at the Cleveland Browns. The following season saw Edwards get more playing time with 12 games. This was reflected in his tackle count for the season which was a career-high 38. In 2006, he saw action in eight games and finished the campaign with 12 tackles. He was hurt in the 2008 preseason, and was forced to undergo season-ending surgery. Edwards underwent a spinal fusion of the C3 and C4 vertebrae. The surgeon replaced one of his discs with a cadaver's. His contract was up in 2008 and he had to consider whether to stay or go. With little leverage after surgery, he signed a one-year deal.
