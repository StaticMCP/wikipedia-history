Haddad, who had been Lula's running mate, replaced him as the candidate and PCdoB state legislator Manuela d'Ávila became Haddad's running mate.\nHaddad received 29% of the vote in the first round of the election, thus placing second and qualifying for a run-off against PSL candidate Jair Bolsonaro on 28 October 2018.\nTicket\nElection result\nPresidential elections\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Election year\n! rowspan=2|Candidate\n! colspan=2|First round\n! colspan=2|Second round\n|-\n! # of overall votes\n! % of overall vote\n! # of overall votes\n! % of overall vote\n|-\n! 2018\n| Fernando Haddad\n| 31,342,005\n| 29.28 #2\n| 47,040,380\n| 44.87%\n|}\nEndorsements\nPoliticians and Parties\n*PDT (second round)\n*35th President of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva\n*36th President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff.\n*Governor of Maranhão Flávio Dino.\n*Former environment minister, Acre senator and REDE presidential candidate Marina Silva (second round)\n*Former President of Uruguay José Mujica.\n*Former President of the Supreme Federal Court Joaquim Barbosa (second round)\n*Distrito Federal Senator Cristovam Buarque (second round)\n*Former Governor of São Paulo and ex-PSDB president Alberto Goldman (second round).\n*Former General Prosecutor of Brazil Rodrigo Janot (second round).\nCelebrities\n*Actor José de Abreu.\n*Singer-songwriter Zeca Baleiro.\n*Actor Paulo Betti.\n*Singer-songwriter Chico Buarque.\n*Actress Débora Falabella.\n*Singer-songwriter Gilberto Gil.\n*Actress Alessandra Negrini.\n*YouTuber Felipe Neto (second round).\n*Actress Maria Ribeiro.\n*Actress Letícia Sabatella.\n*Actor and director Marcelo Serrado (second round).\n*Actor, filmmaker and television host Marcelo Tas (second round).\n*Singer Pabllo Vittar.\nReferences"
