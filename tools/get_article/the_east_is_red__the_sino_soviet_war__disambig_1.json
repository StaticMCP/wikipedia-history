(SPI) in 1974 that simulates a hypothetical invasion of Manchuria and North China by Russia using 1970s armaments.\nDescription\nThe East Is Red is a two-player game in which one player controls the Russian invaders, and the other player controls Chinese defenders.\nComponents\nThe game includes:\n* 22\" × 34\" paper hex grid map scaled at 50 km (31 mi) per hex\n* rulesheet\n* 100 die-cut counters\nGameplay\nThe East Is Red uses an alternating system of \"I Go, You Go\" turns, movement and combat first developed by SPI for Kursk: Operation Zitadelle (1971).\nVictory conditions\nVictory is based solely based on how many Chinese industrial centers the Russians capture: 22 or less is a Russian defeat, 23 or more is a Russian victory.\nPublication history\nThe East Is Red was designed by Jim Dunnigan, with graphic design by Redmond A. Simonsen. It was first published by SPI in Strategy & Tactics No. 42, then released in both a \"flat-pack\" box and a regular bookcase box.\nAfter the demise of SPI, Decision Games acquired the rights to the game. Joseph Miranda revised and updated the rules to allow for more modern armaments, and a second edition titled Dragon vs Bear: China vs Russia in the 21st Century with cover art by Eric R. Harvey was published in 2014 as a pullout game in Modern War #12.\nReception\nIn his 1977 book The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming, Nicholas Palmer called it a \"good brisk game with little innovation over the [Kursk: Operation Zitadelle] game system but unusual theme.\"\nIn Moves No. 15, Thomas Sink noted that a large part of Russia's supply line issues stem from a proposed limited shipping capacity of the Trans-Siberian Railway. However, as Sink pointed out, the Russian railway system actually had the ability \"to supply around 300,000 tons of supplies daily to dumps behind the front [...] If only half of this got through, it would be sufficient to supply the 45 [Russian] divisions.\"\nOther reviews and commentary\n* Strategy & Tactics No. 46\n* Panzerfaust No. 66\n* Jagdpanther No. 6, #8 & No. 10\n* International Confederation of Wargamers Newsletter No. 34\n* Outposts No. 2 & No. 10\n* Pursue & Destroy No. 18\nReferences"
