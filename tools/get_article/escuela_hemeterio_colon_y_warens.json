Its original, main building, built in 1913, is architecturally significant as a well-preserved example of the Puerto Rican school buildings of the early 20th century, a period of great transformation in Puerto Rico under the American administration. It was designed by insular architect Albert B. McCulloch using the California Mission Revival and Classical Revival styles, as well as some Modernist elements associated with the work of Antonin Nechodoma.\nThe school was entered on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2022.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in southern Puerto Rico\nReferences\nExternal links\n*, National Register of Historic Places cover documentation"
