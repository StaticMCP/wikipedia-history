He enlisted at Corvallis, Oregon in 1917 and joined the 60th Infantry Regiment of the 5th Division. On November 5, 1918, mere days from the armistice, Allworth and his company crossed the Meuse River via a canal bridge near the French village of Clery-le-Petit. When shellfire destroyed the bridge and separated the company into two halves, Allworth swam across with some of his men while under fire from the enemy. Leading a subsequent charge towards the enemy lines, he forced them back one kilometre, taking 100 prisoners and thus capturing the bridgehead.\nFor this action, Allworth received the Medal of Honor in 1919. In 1925, Allworth rejoined the Oregon State University faculty as secretary of the Alumni Association, secretary of the Memorial Union Board of Governors, and manager of the Memorial Union. He published a set of memoirs titled Edward C. Allworth Papers, 1954-1963 before he retired in 1963. He died in Portland, Oregon on June 24, 1966.\nMedal of Honor citation\npresided.]]\n*Rank and organization: Captain, U.S. Army, 60th Infantry, 5th Division.\n*Place and date: At Clery-le-Petit, France, November 5, 1918.\n*Entered service at: Corvallis, Oregon\n*Born: July 6, 1895, Crawford, Washington\n*General Orders: War Department, General Orders No. 16 ( January 22, 1919).\nCitation:\nMilitary awards and decorations\nAllworth's military decorations and awards include:\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n!1st row\n| colspan=\"7\"|Medal of Honor\n|-\n!2nd row\n| colspan=\"3\"|Purple Heart\n| colspan=\"3\"|World War I Victory Medal w/three bronze service stars to denote credit for the St. Mihiel, Meuse-Argonne and Defensive Sector battle clasps.\n| colspan=\"3\"|Army of Occupation of Germany Medal\n|-\n!3rd row\n| colspan=\"3\"|Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur degree of Knight (French Republic)\n| colspan=\"3\"|Croix de guerre 1914–1918 w/ two bronze palms (French Republic)\n| colspan=\"3\"|Croce al Merito di Guerra (Italy)\n|-\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Medal of Honor recipients\n* List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War I\n* Edward A.
