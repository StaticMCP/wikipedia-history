It was set up by Colin Courtney in 1990 after his previous company, Tynesoft, went bankrupt. It retained Tynesoft's MicroValue brand and published Elvira: The Arcade Game which had originally been scheduled for publication by Tynesoft.\nThe company is mainly associated with popular and colorful Amiga games such as Trolls, Oscar, and Whizz. In 1993 platformer Oscar was bundled with Millennium's Diggers as a launch bundle for the Amiga CD32 and it was considered one of the mascot games for the system. Flair Software's 1994 fighting game Dangerous Streets (that was a pack-in game for the CD32 later in its lifespan) is generally considered one of the worst games of all time.\nThe games Trolls and Oscar were remade and re-released in 2010 as Nintendo DSiWare by Virtual Playground (part of the MicroValue group of companies) under the new titles Oscar in Toyland (since the Trolls license couldn't be used anymore ) and Oscar in Movieland. In 2011 Virtual Playground also released two new original Oscar games (Oscar in Toyland 2 and ''Oscar's World Tour) for DSiWare.\nThe company currently operates under the name Casual Arts and releases games for PC, Mac, Nintendo DS/3DS, iOS, Android, and Kindle.\nSelected games\n* Turn n' Burn (1990, Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS)\n* Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (1991, Commodore 64) (publisher)\n* Elvira: The Arcade Game (1991, Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS)\n* Euro Soccer (1992, Amiga, DOS)\n* Trolls (1992, Amiga, Amiga CD32, Commodore 64, DOS)\n* Oscar (1993, Amiga, Amiga CD32, DOS, SNES)\n* Surf Ninjas (1993, Amiga CD32)\n* Dangerous Streets (1994, Amiga, Amiga CD32, DOS)\n* Summer Olympix (1994, Amiga CD32)\n* Whizz (1994, Amiga, DOS, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, SNES)\n* Rally Championships (1994, Amiga, DOS)\n* Soccer Superstars (1995, Amiga, Amiga CD32, DOS)\n* Realm (1996, SNES)\n* Time Paradox (1996, DOS)\n* MegaMorph (1997, DOS)\n* Double Agent (1998, Windows, Amiga)\n* Jungle Legend (1999, Windows)''\nReferences"
