In 1086, the village was divided between the estates of Roger Bigod, Godric the Steward and St Edmunds Abbey.\nBetween 1764 and 1767, a workhouse was built in Heckingham which was later used as a hospital. In 1766, a pest house was built nearby by John Harris of Ipswich for the afflicted.\nGeography\nAccording to the 2021 census, Heckingham has a total population of 245 people which demonstrates an increase from the 179 people listed in the 2011 census.\nHeckingham is located along the course of the River Chet.\nSt. Gregory's Church\nHeckingham's parish church is dedicated for Saint Gregory and dates from the Twelfth Century. St. Gregory's is located within the village on Church Lane and has been Grade I listed since 1960. The church is no longer open for Sunday services and is in the care of Churches Conservation Trust.\nSt. Gregory's features an Eleventh Century font and several medieval monuments and memorials.\nGovernance\nHeckingham is part of the electoral ward of Loddon & Chedgrave for local elections and is part of the district of South Norfolk.\nThe village's national constituency is South Norfolk which has been represented by the Labour's Ben Goldsborough MP since 2024.\nWar Memorial\nHeckingham War Memorial is shared with nearby Hales and is a rough-hewn Celtic cross on Yarmouth Road.
