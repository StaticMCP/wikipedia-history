Later, Leonid Pasechnik, head of the LPR, did the same, and announced that the LPR civilian population was to be evacuated to Russia. However, Ukraine denied the allegations of starting an offensive against the two republics. The first train for the evacuation departed to Russia on 19 February. According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations in Russia, 50,000 evacuees from the Donbas had arrived in Russia in the first two days since the announcement of the evacuation.\nUkrainian authorities reported that most people in Donetsk and Luhansk did not leave their homes. Some citizens evacuated out of fear of the Russian authorities, rather than allegations of a Ukrainian offensive. Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary to Russian president Vladimir Putin, said that he had no information of what was happening in the DPR.\nSee also\n* Russian filtration camps of Ukrainians\n*\nReferences"
