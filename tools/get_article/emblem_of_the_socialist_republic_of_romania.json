The coat of arms became more emblematically faithful to Communist symbolism: a landscape (depicting a rising sun, a tractor and an oil drill) surrounded by stocks of wheat tied together with a cloth in the colors of the national flag. The pattern of the emblem was modeled after the state emblem of the Soviet Union.\nBetween 1948 and 1966, there were three variants. The first came shortly after 1948 (the proclamation of the people's republic). The emblem shows a landscape with a fir-wood and the Carpathian Mountains, on the dexter a derrick and in the sky a rising sun all proper. On the ears, were the wheat with the motto \"RPR\" in white lettering on a ribbon. In 1952, the red star was added.\nThe final change to the communist emblem took place in 1965 when Romania ceased to be a ''People's Republic, and became a Socialist Republic. At this time, the wording changed from RPR to Republica Socialistă România with some minor changes to the ribbon. The emblem remained in use until the fall of Nicolae Ceaușescu and the communist regime, the communist emblem was removed from all flags, and official seals. Some flags had a hole (a symbol of the revolution) and some changed to the later official blue-yellow-red format. The wording changed to just România''. The new coat of arms replaced the socialist emblem in 1992.\nFile:Coat of arms of Romania (January-March 1948).svg|January–March 1948\nFile:Coat of arms of the Popular Republic of Romania (1948-1952).svg|March 1948–1952\nFile:Coat of arms of the Popular Republic of Romania (1952-1965).svg|1952–1965\nSee also\n*Coat of arms of Romania\n*List of Romanian coats of arms\n*Emblem of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic\nReferences"
