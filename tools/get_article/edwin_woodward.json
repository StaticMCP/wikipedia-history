Born at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, Woodward was a right-handed batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler who made two appearances in first-class cricket.\nWoodward made his debut in first-class cricket for Liverpool and District against the touring Australians in 1888 at Aigburth Cricket Ground, Liverpool. He played a second first-class match for Liverpool and District in 1890 against Yorkshire, during which he took the wickets of Louis Hall and Jack Brown, which were his only wickets in first-class cricket.\nHe died at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire on 3 January 1953.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/23173.html Edwin Woodward] at ESPNcricinfo\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/34/34050/34050.html Edwin Woodward] at CricketArchive"
