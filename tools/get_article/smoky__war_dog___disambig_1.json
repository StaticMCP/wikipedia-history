She weighed only  and stood  tall. Smoky is credited with beginning a renewal of interest in the once-obscure Yorkshire Terrier breed.\nBiography\nDiscovery and purchase\nIn February 1944, Smoky was found by an American soldier in an abandoned foxhole in the New Guinea jungle.  She was already a young adult Yorkie (fully grown).  The soldiers initially thought the small dog belonged to the Japanese, but after taking her to a nearby prisoner-of-war camp they realized she did not understand commands in Japanese or English. Another GI then sold Smoky to Corporal William A. Wynne of Cleveland, Ohio, for two Australian pounds (equal to $6.44 at that time)&mdash;the price paid to the seller so he could return to his poker game.\nWWII\nFor the next year, Smoky back-packed through the rest of the war and accompanied Wynne on combat flights in the Pacific.  She faced adverse circumstances, living in the New Guinea jungle and Rock Islands, suffering the primitive conditions of tents in equatorial heat and humidity.  Throughout her service, Smoky slept in Wynne's tent on a blanket made from a green felt card table cover; she shared Wynne's C-rations and an occasional can of Spam. Unlike the \"official\" war dogs of World War II, Smoky had access to neither veterinary medicine nor a balanced diet formulated especially for dogs.  Despite this, Smoky was never ill.  She even ran on coral for four months without developing any of the paw ailments that plagued some war dogs.\nAs described by Wynne, \"Smoky served in the South Pacific with the 5th Air Force, 26th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron and flew 12 air/sea rescue and photo reconnaissance missions.\"  On those flights, Smoky spent long hours dangling in a soldier's pack near machine guns used to ward off enemy fighters.  Smoky was credited with twelve combat missions and awarded eight battle stars.  She survived 150 air raids on New Guinea and made it through a typhoon at Okinawa.  Smoky even parachuted from  in the air, out of a tree, using a parachute made just for her. Wynne credited Smoky with saving his life by warning him of incoming shells on an LST (transport ship), calling her an angel' from a foxhole\".  As the ship deck was booming and vibrating from anti-aircraft gunnery, Smoky guided Wynne to duck the fire that hit eight men standing next to them.\nIn the downtime, Smoky learned numerous tricks, which she performed for the entertainment of troops with Special Services and in hospitals from Australia to Korea.  According to Wynne, Smoky taught him as much as he taught her, and she developed a repertoire beyond that of any dog of her day.  In 1944, Yank Down Under magazine named Smoky the \"Champion Mascot in the Southwest Pacific Area\".\nSmoky's tricks enabled her to become a hero in her own right by helping engineers to build an airbase at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, a crucial airfield for Allied war planes.  Early in the Luzon campaign, the Signal Corps needed to run a telegraph wire through a  pipe that was  in diameter. Soil had sifted through the corrugated sections at the pipe joinings, filling as much as half of the pipe, giving Smoky only four inches of headway in some places. As Wynne himself told the story when he appeared on NBC-TV after World War II:\nSmoky's work saved approximately 250 ground crewmen from having to move around and keep operational 40 United States fighters and reconnaissance planes, while a construction detail dug up the taxiway, placing the men and the planes in danger from enemy bombings.  What would have been a dangerous three-day digging task to place the wire was instead completed in minutes.\nAfter the war\nWhen they arrived home from the war, Wynne and Smoky were featured in a page one story with photographs in the Cleveland Press on December 7, 1945.  Smoky soon became a national sensation.  Over the next 10 years, Smoky and Wynne traveled to Hollywood and all over the world to perform demonstrations of her remarkable skills, which included walking a tightrope while blindfolded.  She appeared with Wynne on some of the earliest TV shows in the Cleveland area, including a show of their own on Cleveland's WKYC Channel 3 called Castles in the Air, featuring some of Smoky's unbelievable tricks.  Smoky performed in 42 live-television shows without ever repeating a trick.  Smoky and Wynne were also very popular entertainers at the veterans' hospitals. According to Wynne, “after the war Smoky entertained millions during late 1940s and early 1950s.\"\nOn February 21, 1957, \"Corporal\" Smoky died unexpectedly at the approximate age of 14. Wynne and his family buried Smoky in a World War II .30 caliber ammo box in the Cleveland Metroparks, Rocky River Reservation in Lakewood, Ohio.\nNearly 50 years later, on Veterans Day, November 11, 2005, a bronze life-size sculpture, by Susan Bahary, of Smoky sitting in a GI helmet, atop a two-ton blue granite base, was unveiled there. It is placed above the very spot that Smoky was laid at her final resting place. This monument is dedicated to “Smoky, the Yorkie Doodle Dandy, and the Dogs of All Wars\".\nHonors\nMemorials honoring Smoky include:\n*Cleveland Metroparks, Rocky River Reservation, Lakewood, Ohio.

Her service in this area began in July 1944 at the 233rd Station Hospital in New Guinea, where she accompanied nurses to see the incoming battlefield casualties from the Biak Island invasion.  Smoky was already a celebrity of sorts, as her photograph was in Yank magazine at the same time, which made it easy to get permission. Dr. Charles Mayo of the Mayo Clinic was the commanding officer who allowed Smoky to go on rounds and also permitted her to sleep with Wynne in his hospital bed for five nights.  Smoky's work as a therapy dog continued for 12 years, during and after World War II.\nYorkie Doodle Dandy\nYorkie Doodle Dandy: Or, the Other Woman Was a Real Dog, is a book authored by Bill Wynne. It is the memoir of his time with Smoky during World War II and thereafter.  It features highlights of their service in the Pacific and their adventures in Hollywood, as well as advice on dog training, Yorkshire Terrier FAQs, and more. The book tells the story of how Smoky was given a promotion to \"corporal\" and even explains how this Yorkshire Terrier ended up in New Guinea.  Originally published in 1996 by Wynnesome Press, now in 2020, it's the 7th edition, by Top Dog Enterprises, LLC.\nSee also\n*Chips, the most decorated war dog of World War II.\n*Sergeant Stubby, the most decorated war dog of World War I\n*List of individual dogs\nReferences"
