A concept album that is a mix of ambient, alternative, and progressive rock songs that chronicle a fictional character of \"Sonja\" thru a steam punk inspired world. Released on May 17, 2010.\nBackground\nAfter revisiting the pure ambient music explorations in 2007's Lullabies & Sleepless Nights (Ambient Guitar Noise: Volume 2), McCabe uses collaborators again for this high concept album which borrows inspiration from Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. This would be the first independent release for the band.\nFrom March 2009 into December 2010, McCabe hosted the King Never Podcast in which he chronicled the recording of what became the album Possibilities.\nIn April 2012 music videos for The City and Gravity, both directed by Gerald Benesch were released via the King Never official YouTube channel.\nReception\n[http://www.Downthelinezine.com Downthelinezine.com] said: \"If you like music in that arena of alternative rock, you will also like this album.\"\nTrack listing\n# Introduction – 2:34\n# The City – 3:06\n# Hotel Desolation – 2:57\n# Possibilities – 1:22\n# Gravity – 4:07\n# Sorrow – 3:26\n# Down Low – 3:54\n# Believe – 3:19\n# All Is Well That Ends Well – 3:05\nProduction notes\nReleased May 17, 2010.\nMatt McCabe: vocals, guitars, guitar loops/textures, bass, minimal keyboards and incidental cymbals\nKristy McCabe: background vocals\nJake Wood: drums\nRecorded, mixed and mastered by Matt McCabe at Finley Sound.
