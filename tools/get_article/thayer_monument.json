Thayer is known as the \"Father of the Military Academy\" for the profound and lasting impact of his superintendency during the academy's early years. The monument's location has changed over the years.  It first occupied the southwest corner of the Plain, but it currently sits at the intersection of Washington and Jefferson roads, adjacent to the Beat Navy tunnel on the northwest corner of the Plain.  The memorial is the site of multiple memorial ceremonies during the year as West Point reunions hold a parade and memorial service at the site.  Tradition states that the oldest living graduate of the senior reunion class present will lay a wreath at the statue.\nImage:Thayer Monument West Point at Sunset.JPG|Thayer statue at sunset\nImage:Thayer Statue in Early Spring, West Point, NY.JPG|Monument in early spring\nImage:Old (Pre-1910 Gymnasium) and location of Thayer Monument at West Point.png|Original location in front of the old gymnasium\nImage:Thayer Monument in original location, circa 1900, West Point, NY.png|Original location, pre-1910\nReferences"
