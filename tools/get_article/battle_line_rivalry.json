It is an American college football rivalry game between the Arkansas Razorbacks and Missouri Tigers.  The teams have met fifteen times, between November 1906 and November 2023. They have faced off twice in bowl games, first in the 2003 Independence Bowl and second in the 2008 Cotton Bowl Classic. The rivalry was formally introduced in 2014, and the Battle Line trophy was first awarded in 2015.\nHistory\nPre-SEC era\nThe first meeting between the Razorbacks and Tigers was in 1906. Missouri won 11–0 in Columbia, Missouri. The two teams played each other in out of conference, regular season games in 1906, 1944, and 1963. They have met in bowl games twice.\nSEC era\nMissouri leads the series 9–2 since the schools began playing as SEC foes in 2014. The teams did not play in 2012 and 2013, the first two years Missouri was a member of the conference.\nStarting in 2015, the winner of the game received a silver trophy outlining the states of Missouri and Arkansas with the words \"Battle Line\" on the border between the states. In 2014, Missouri's victory gave them a spot in the SEC Championship. The series was played on Black Friday from 2014 to 2019, with the 2020 edition scheduled for the week after due to scheduling complications from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe location of the games changes every year between Fayetteville, Arkansas in Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium and Columbia, Missouri on Faurot Field.\nMissouri won the first meeting as SEC opponents 21–14 in Columbia. In the first game that the trophy was on the line, the Razorbacks won 28–3. The Tigers captured the trophy for the first time in 2016, overcoming a 24–7 halftime deficit to win 28–24 in Columbia. In 2017 the Tigers kept the trophy winning 48–45 on a last second 19-yard field goal by kicker Tucker McCann.\nPrior to 2014, Arkansas played LSU in the Battle for the Golden Boot in its regular season finale every year since joining the SEC in 1992. LSU now plays Texas A&M in its regular season finale. Missouri faced the Aggies to close the 2012 and 2013 regular seasons in a continuation of the former Big 12 Conference series.\nArkansas will bring the game back to War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock in alternating years when the Razorbacks are hosting the Tigers, from 2019 to 2024. A year later, Missouri and the Kansas City Chiefs agreed to move the rivalry game in 2020 to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Due to concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 game was moved back to Columbia instead of Kansas City. Due to contract negotiations falling through between the University of Arkansas and the owners of War Memorial Stadium, the 2021–2024 games have all been moved back to Fayetteville.\nGame results\n| team2 = Missouri\n| team2style =\n| November 10, 1906 | Columbia, MO | Missouri | 11 | Arkansas | 0\n| September 23, 1944 | St. Louis, MO | Arkansas | 7 | Missouri | 6\n| September 28, 1963 | Little Rock, AR | Missouri | 7 | Arkansas | 6\n| December 31, 2003 | Shreveport, LA | Arkansas | 27 | Missouri | 14\n| January 1, 2008 | Dallas, TX | No. 7 Missouri | 38 | Arkansas | 7\n| November 28, 2014 | Columbia, MO | No. 17 Missouri | 21 | Arkansas | 14\n| November 27, 2015 | Fayetteville, AR | Arkansas | 28 | Missouri | 3\n| November 25, 2016 | Columbia, MO | Missouri* | 28 | Arkansas | 24 |win8=none\n| November 24, 2017 | Fayetteville, AR | Missouri | 48 | Arkansas | 45\n| November 23, 2018 | Columbia, MO | Missouri | 38 | Arkansas | 0\n| November 29, 2019 | Little Rock, AR | Missouri | 24 | Arkansas | 14\n| December 5, 2020 | Columbia, MO | Missouri | 50 | Arkansas | 48\n| November 26, 2021 | Fayetteville, AR | No. 25 Arkansas | 34 | Missouri | 17\n| November 25, 2022 | Columbia, MO | Missouri | 29 | Arkansas | 27\n| November 24, 2023 | Fayetteville, AR | No. 8 Missouri | 48 | Arkansas | 14\n| November 30, 2024 | Columbia, MO | No. 21 Missouri | 28 | Arkansas | 21\n| footnote =\n| note = * Missouri vacated all wins from the 2015 and 2016 seasons due to NCAA action.\n}}\nNotable games\n1906 – First meeting\nMissouri 11, Arkansas 0\nThe first meeting between Arkansas and Missouri took place on November 10, 1906, and finished 11 to 0 in favor of Missouri.

The Razorbacks were coming into Columbia off a 2-game run on which they shut out two ranked teams. This game marked the first conference meeting between the two schools.

Collins scored a third time from 25 yards out in the late second quarter, with the score now at 21–3. The final score of the game came with 2:15 in the third quarter, as Kody Walker found the end zone from 9 yards out to make it 28–3. Missouri found themselves in a 4th-and-10 at the UA 33 with 2:35 in the 4th, but Missouri quarterback Drew Lock threw an interception (picked off by Josh Liddell) to seal the game. The Razorbacks defeated the Tigers 28–3, closing Pinkel's 15-year tenure at Mizzou.\nSee also\n* List of NCAA college football rivalry games\nReferences"
