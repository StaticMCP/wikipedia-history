Two seasons of episodes were produced on February 8, 1998, and March 14, 1999; then aired as reruns until May 21, 2000, when CBS' abolition of its Nelvana Limited-produced children's programming in favor of Nick Jr. and later, Nickelodeon content resulted in its cancellation. The series was based on the book series Myth Men Guardians of the Legend written in 1996 and 1997 by Laura Geringer and illustrated by Peter Bollinger.\nThe series was a fixture of CBS' Saturday-morning cartoon lineup. Scottish Television screened the series as part of its children  programme Inside Out. The show was repeat in 2009 on wknd@stv, which is a children's television strand on Scottish television channel, then on Saturday mornings on STV during 2010. The series has been translated into Scottish Gaelic and is broadcast on BBC Alba since 2010.\nMost of the characters in the show are portrayed with their original Greek names, with a few Romanized exceptions (e.g. Hercules, Ulysses).\nMyth Men\nMyth Men Guardians of the Legend is a book series written in 1996 and 1997 by Laura Geringer and illustrated by Peter Bollinger. It is a comic series targeted at children age 4-8 and published by Scholastic Books, Inc. It received the Children's Choice award.\nThe series includes both male and female mythical heroes, including Perseus, Heracles, Odysseus, Theseus, Andromeda and Atalanta. The books retell the actual myths and legends with added fantasy elements.\nPremise\nDepictions of gods\nThis show is well known for its unique depictions of the Greek gods. Most were shown as gigantic (approximately 10–12 feet tall) humanoids possessing immortality, the abilities to fly and teleport, supernatural powers of a magical nature (as opposed to cosmic), and the ability to alter their appearances at will; including reducing themselves to the size of a typical human, as well as completely altering their looks, voices, and even gender. When in their natural form, an echo would accompany their voice whenever they spoke.\nInstead of classic attire resembling that of human nobility often employed during Hellenic times, the Olympians were instead depicted as wearing brightly colored clothing more typical of a warrior's formal attire, the exceptions being Hera, Demeter, and Hephaestus.\nBetween the first and second seasons, the depictions of several gods changed. Hades' attire was slightly altered. Persephone aged from a teenage-looking young girl to a grown goddess. The most significant changes, however, were to Aphrodite and Athena; the former shifted from a giggling pencil-thin schoolgirl-like teenager, to a conniving fully mature armor-clad lust goddess, with an entirely different voice and manner of speech as well. Athena was altered from a blonde in monotonous silver armor; to a brunette cloaked in blood-red dual-split dress with matching cape, plus golden shin guards and arm-bands in addition. Despite the complete change in depiction, her voice did remain the same.\nFeatured Gods\n* Zeus – King of the gods, ruler of Olympus, and god of the sky, justice, thunder, and lightning. He is the father of Hercules and Perseus.\n* Hera – Queen of the gods and goddess of the sky, marriage and childbirth.\n* Hades – God of the Underworld, the Dead, wealth and burial.

Because of his role in mythology, his role in the show was limited.\n* Apollo – God of light, music, prophecies, poetry, medicine, truth, archery and (in Hellenistic myths) replaced Helios as god of the sun. He was to become known as \"Phoebus Apollo\". He is the twin brother of Artemis.\n* Artemis – Virgin goddess of the hunt, wilderness, virginity, fertility, children, childbirth and wildlife.
