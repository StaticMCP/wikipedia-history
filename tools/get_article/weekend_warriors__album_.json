It was released in November 1978 by Epic Records.\nDescription\nWeekend Warriors'' was the first of three Ted Nugent studio albums to not feature Derek St. Holmes, following Holmes' departure in 1978. Instead, Charlie Huhn, the new vocalist and guitarist for Nugent, performed on this album and others until Holmes returned for Nugent in 1982. Founding bassist Rob Grange had left for good, citing the lack of credit for co-songwriting and suspicions about Nugent's creative accounting, which Grange alleged was building his hunting dynasty instead of paying the band.\nThe front sleeve-art was by British artist Jeff Cummins and was originally commissioned by Oui magazine, to accompany an interview with Nugent. Nugent liked what he saw and the artwork was recommissioned by CBS, with additional work being carried out for use as the album sleeve.\nTrack listing\nAll songs composed by Ted Nugent.\n| length3 = 3:05\n| title4 = Tight Spots\n| length4 = 2:55\n| title5 = Venom Soup\n| length5 = 5:47\n}}\n| length8 = 3:26\n| title9 = Good Friends and a Bottle of Wine\n| length9 = 4:00\n| title10 = Name Your Poison\n| length10 = 4:30\n}}\nPersonnel\n;Band members\n* Ted Nugent – lead and rhythm guitars, lead vocals (on tracks 3, 8, 9, 10), backing vocals, bass (on track 10), percussion\n* Charlie Huhn – lead vocals (on tracks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), backing vocals, rhythm guitar (on track 2)\n* John Sauter – bass (except where noted)\n* Cliff Davies – drums, electronic drums, producer\n;Additional musicians\n* David Hull – bass (on tracks 2, 5, 6, 8)\n;Production\n* Lew Futterman, Tom Werman – producers\n* Steve Klein – engineer\n* Tim Geelan – engineer, mixing\n* Kevin Ryan, Lou Schlossberg, Phil Giambaivo – assistant engineers\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1978)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia Albums (Kent Music Report)\n| 44\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
