It is now accepted that the original temple was destroyed and the present temple was built by Maharaja Pran Narayan of the Cooch Behar State in 1665.\nThe main temple roof has been built in the Bengal char chala style having a curved cornish with a circular dome atop. There are two entrances to the temple, the main entrance being on the west and another on the north. There is a nahabatkhana at the main entrance to the temple. The temple is  high and has a square base of .\nDeities inside the temple are two Shiva lingas, an idol of Brahma, a Shalagram/ Narayan shila, an idol of Gopal made of ashtadhatu (alloy of eight metals) and a bronze idol of Surya. There is another Surya idol of the Pal-era on the northern wall of the temple and a Vishnu idol, also of the Pal era, in the south-eastern corner of the temple. Both the latter idols have been brought from somewhere else and placed here. There is another Shiva linga in the south western part of the temple.\nThe Kamteswari temple is a state protected monument.\nKamteswari temple picture gallery\nFile:Gosanimari Kamteshwari Temple at Cooch Behar District In West Bengal 11.jpg\nFile:Gosanimari Kamteshwari Temple at Cooch Behar District In West Bengal 06.jpg\nFile:Kamteswari temple in Gosanimari 08.jpg\nFile:Kamteswari temple in Gosanimari 07.jpg\nFile:Kamteswari temple in Gosanimari 09.jpg\nReferences"
