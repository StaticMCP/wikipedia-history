For this reason, Laurence Housman's play Victoria Regina (1935), which had earlier appeared at the Gate Theatre Studio in London with Pamela Stanley in the title role, could not have its British premiere until the centenary of Queen Victoria's accession, 20 June 1937. This was a Sunday, so the new premiere took place the next day, at the Lyric Theatre. Pamela Stanley reprised the title role at Housman's request, and Carl Esmond played Prince Albert. The play later appeared on Broadway, where Helen Hayes portrayed the Queen, with Vincent Price in the role of Prince Albert.\nVaughan Wilkins' novel And So-Victoria (1937) focuses on Victoria's life.\nQueen Victoria appears in Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel From Hell, where she is depicted as instigating the Whitechapel murders.\nA Royal Diaries book was written, documenting her childhood between 1829 and 1830: Victoria, May Blossom of Britannia by Anna Kirwan.\nThe Victorian age is experienced through the eyes of the fictional Morland family in The Abyss, The Hidden Shore, The Winter Journey, The Outcast, The Mirage, The Cause, The Homecoming and The Question, Volumes 18–25 respectively of The Morland Dynasty, a series of historical novels by author Cynthia Harrod-Eagles. One of the characters becomes Victoria's devoted lady-in-waiting.\nCynthia Harrod-Eagles also wrote I Victoria, a fictional autobiography of Queen Victoria.\nThere is a Sanskrit poem named Cakravarttini gunamanimala, written by T.

In the episode, set in 1879, she is threatened by a werewolf that wants to infect her and take control of her empire. It is suggested that a scratch from the werewolf is the source of haemophilia in many of her descendants. Rose Tyler makes a bet with the Doctor for £10 that she can get the Queen to say \"We are not amused\". At the episode's conclusion, she founds the Torchwood Institute, an integral feature of the spin-off series Torchwood, with various (fictional) speeches and proclamations by her available on the [http://torchwood.org.uk Torchwood Institute website]. An image of Collins as Victoria was later displayed prominently in the 2017 episode \"Empress of Mars\", set during the later years of Victoria's reign (coincidentally, the episode guest-starred Ferdinand Kingsley, who at the time was co-starring with Jenna Coleman in the ITV series based on Victoria's life).

Captain Blackadder interrogates Captain Kevin Darling whom he suspects to be a German spy. Captain Darling claims that he is \"as British as Queen Victoria\", to which Captain Blackadder replies: \"So your father's German, you're half German and you married a German?\"\nA recurring skit performed by the Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster featured a man who flew into a rage upon hearing a pun, which causes an issue when he meets Victoria (played by different actresses over the years) with the idea of renaming a street \"Victoria Mews\" in her honour, to which she replies indigently, \"I am not a Mews.\"\nStatues\n's statue of Queen Victoria at Kensington Palace]]\nin Sydney, Australia]]\non Parliament Hill.
