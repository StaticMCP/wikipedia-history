There are 538 electors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe members of the 1992 Electoral College met on December 14, 1992, the Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December. Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore received 370 electoral college votes. President George Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle received 168 votes. Independent Ross Perot did not receive any electoral college votes despite earning nearly 19% of the popular vote.\nWhile every state except Nebraska and Maine chooses the electors by statewide vote, many states require that one elector be designated for each congressional district. These electors are chosen by each party before the general elections. A vote for that party then confirms their position. In all states except Nebraska and Maine, each state's electors are winner-take-all. In Maine and Nebraska within each congressional district one elector is allocated by popular vote – the states' remaining two electors (representing the two U.S. Senate seats) are winner-take-both. Except where otherwise noted, such designations refer to the elector's residence in that district rather than election by the voters of the district.\nAlabama\nElectors 9: Pledged to George Bush and Dan Quayle\nAlaska\nElectors 3: Pledged to George Bush and Dan Quayle\nArizona\nElectors 8: Pledged to George Bush and Dan Quayle\nArkansas\nElectors 6: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nCalifornia\nElectors 54: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nColorado\nElectors 8: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\n*Howard Gelt, Colorado Democratic Party chair\n*Mary Beth Corsentino of Pueblo\n*Irene Kornelly of Colorado Springs\n*John Castellano of Denver\n*William Bertschy of Fort Collins\n*Adam Dempsey of Aurora\n*George Morgan of Golden\n*Douglas Schroeder of Northglenn\nConnecticut\nElectors 8: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nDelaware\nElectors 3: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nDistrict of Columbia\nElectors 3: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nFlorida\nElectors 25: Pledged to George Bush and Dan Quayle\nGeorgia\nElectors 13: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nHawaii\nElectors 4: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nIdaho\nElectors 4: Pledged to George Bush and Dan Quayle\nIllinois\nElectors 22: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nIndiana\nElectors 12: Pledged to George Bush and Dan Quayle\nIowa\nElectors 7: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nKansas\nElectors 6: Pledged to George Bush and Dan Quayle\nKentucky\nElectors 8: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nLouisiana\nElectors 9: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nMaine\nElectors 4: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\nMaryland\nElectors 10: Pledged to Bill Clinton and Al Gore\n*William B.
