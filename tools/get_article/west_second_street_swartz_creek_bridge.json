It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.\nHistory\nThe West Second Street Bridge was engineered in 1919 by the Flint City Engineer's Office under a royalty agreement with Daniel B. Luten, where the bridge utilized Luten's patented arch design. The Illinois Bridge Company of Chicago, a licensee for Luten, provided design assistance. The city solicited bids to construct the bridge, and awarded the construction contract to Price Brothers Construction Company of Lansing, Michigan, which underbid the Illinois Bridge Company. Work started on the bridge in the summer of 1919, and was completed in early 1920. It has continued to carry vehicular traffic since.\nDescription\nThe West Second Street Bridge is a 70-foot Luten arch bridge. The roadway is asphalt, flanked by cantilevered concrete sidewalks. The bridge is heavily skewed across the creek. Massive concrete abutments support the elliptical filled arch. It has a corbeled arch ring, and cast concrete balusters lining the bridge.\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.historicbridges.org/michigan/flint2nd/ Photograph of Second Street Bridge]"
