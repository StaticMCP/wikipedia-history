Based out of Wisconsin, Warshafsky Law Firm has grown to be one of the largest law firms in the Milwaukee area. In competition with firms such as Foley and Lardner LLP and Michael Best & Friedrich LLP, Warshafsky Law Firm has a history of specializing in personal injury and medical malpractice cases.\nLawsuits\n* 1976 – Warshafsky Law Firm wins the biggest personal injury lawsuit settlement in Wisconsin history, up to this point in time. General Motors was sued after a young girl suffered brain damage as the result of a faulty GM part in a car crash. General Motors made an appeal, which Warshafsky followed by accepting a $3 million agreement.\n* 1987 – Wyeth Laboratories was challenged by Warshafsky in a lawsuit regarding another young girl's brain damage, this time caused by the DPT vaccine.

Warshafsky wrote a book series with his colleague called The Trial Handbook for Wisconsin Lawyers. This collection contained multiple volumes of information regarding issues of Wisconsin civil and criminal law.

Warshafsky has always had for helping communities. The Warshafsky Law Firm formed a charitable foundation, known as Venice Arts, to distribute scholarships to young people in Milwaukee who are needy and deserving.
