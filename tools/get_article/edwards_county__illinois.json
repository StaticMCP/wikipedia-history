As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,245. Its county seat is Albion.\nHistory\nEdwards County was named for Ninian Edwards, the governor of the Illinois Territory, and, later, governor of Illinois.\nEdwards County is subdivided into \"Road Districts\", rather than \"Townships\" as in most Illinois counties. Pursuant to the Land Ordinance of 1785, the Northwest Territory (including Illinois) was surveyed and mostly organized into townships that are six miles square; but Edwards County was settled prior to that survey, and its pre-existing Road Districts do not generally correspond with the survey's townships.\nFile:Edwards County Illinois 1815.png|Edwards County, when it was created in 1815 from Gallatin and Madison Counties, extended north to Lake Michigan.\nFile:Edwards County Illinois 1816.png|The county between 1816 and 1819.
