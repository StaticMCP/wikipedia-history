The church building was built in the 13th century and is protected as a  Grade II* listed building.\nOverview\nThe church building was built in the 13th century. It is made of stone and flint rubble. It comprises a nave, chancel, western tower, and south porch.\nThe building was damaged by lightning in 1865, and again in 1874. It was designated Grade II* listed on 20 August 1965.\nInside the church, the communion table is Elizabethan and the chest at the west end of the nave is Jacobean. There are three ancient bells in the tower, one of them made by Walter Wimbis. There are also a chalice and paten dating back to 1568; a chalice, paten, and flagon of silver, to 1872–1874; and a silver alms-dish, to circa 1700. The church also contains a memorial window to anti-apartheid activist and clergyman Michael Scott.\nThe parish is part of the United Benefice of Iford, Rodmell, Southease and Piddinghoe. The registers began in 1654.\nSee also\n*List of places of worship in Lewes (district)\nBibliography\n*A Guide to the Parish Church of Saint Pancras, Kingston near Lewes, Sussex (Claras, 1988).\nReferences"
