      "text": "# Bonding Warehouse\n\nThe Bonding Warehouse is a historic building in the city centre of York in England.\nThe building lies between Skeldergate and the southwest bank of the River Ouse.  It was constructed in two sections, the northern block being built between 1872 and 1873, and the southern block in 1875.  Both were designed by George Styan, the surveyor of the city of York.  It was originally known as the Bonded Warehouse, and commissioned by York Corporation, for customs house officials to store goods on which duty had not yet been paid.\nIn the 20th century, there was less commercial traffic on the river, and the warehouse closed in 1958.  It was then used by Rowntree's for storage, then in 1981 was converted into a pub and steakhouse.  In the 1990s, it was converted into a music and comedy venue, but it closed in 2000, following flooding.  In 2004, it was briefly squatted by the York Peace Collective.  In 2012, it was converted into a mix of offices and apartments, with concrete casings and a new footbridge enabling access even when the local area was flooded.  The building has been grade II listed since 1977.\nThe building is constructed of pink brick, with multicoloured brick dressings, an ashlar plinth on the riverside front, and slate roofs.  The northern block is three storeys high and seven bays wide, and the southern block has two storeys and six bays.  The central bay of the northern block has original lifting doors on the upper floors.  There is a parapet, which rises to a gable over the central bay.  The southeast front is two storeys high and five bays wide, and a gable over the central bay is inscribed \"BONDING WAREHOUSE/ AD 1875\".  On the street front, the northern block is mostly six bays wide, with a single bay to the left set further back.  There are lifting doors in the second bay.  The southern block comes further forward.\nInside, the northern block has an original full-height stone staircase with cast iron bannisters and handrail.  The lower floors have brick vaulting on cast iron columns.  The roof of the northern block has five queen post trusses, and the southern block four king post trusses.\nReferences"
