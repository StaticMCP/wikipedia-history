Now a private residence, this two-story wood-frame building with false front was built in 1901 by Max Gordon, who operated a high-end public establishment on the premises.  It is the oldest commercial building in Nome, and one of the few to survive from Nome's gold rush days.  It was converted to one of Nome's finest private residences in the 1940s.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Nome Census Area, Alaska\nReferences"
