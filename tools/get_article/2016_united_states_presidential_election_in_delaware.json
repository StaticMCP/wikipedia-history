Delaware voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and her running mate Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. Delaware has three electoral votes in the Electoral College.\nClinton carried the state with 53.1% of the vote to Trump's 41.7%, a victory margin of 11.38% Although Democrats continued their streak of winning Delaware, a state that has not gone to the Republicans in a presidential election since 1988, it swung 7.19% to the right relative to 2012, and Trump managed to flip Kent County. This was the first time since 1968 that Delaware did not vote for the same candidate as neighboring Pennsylvania. As of 2024, this is the last time the Republican nominee won Kent county with Trump failing to win the county again in both of his next presidential runs in 2020 and 2024.\nPrimary elections\nDemocratic primary\nFive candidates appeared on the Democratic presidential primary ballot:\n*Hillary Clinton\n*Rocky De La Fuente\n*Martin O'Malley (withdrawn)\n*Bernie Sanders\nOpinion polling\nResults\nRepublican primary\nSix candidates appeared on the Republican presidential primary ballot:\n*Jeb Bush (withdrawn)\n*Ben Carson (withdrawn)\n*Ted Cruz\n*John Kasich\n*Marco Rubio (suspended, to convention)\n*Donald Trump\nOpinion polling\nResults\nGreen convention\nOn April 2, 2016, the Green Party of Delaware announced that all four of its delegates would support Jill Stein at the national convention.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Delaware Green Party Convention, April 2, 2016\n|-\n!
