At the time of release, the band had been disbanded for nearly two years. Guitarist Robert Fripp selected the tracks for inclusion.\nIts name is most likely derived either from the famous orchestral work ''The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra by composer Benjamin Britten or the 1960s television series Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, created by conductor/composer Leonard Bernstein.\nThe gatefold sleeve featured artwork by Scottish artist Fergus Hall, with the front cover being The Landscape Player and the back cover being Earth. Included as part of the package was a booklet, replete with photographs, and detailing gig history and notable events; this was compiled by Robert Fripp from his own archive. The only studio album not represented is Lizard'' (1970).\nTo date, its sole CD release has been in Japan, in 1990. This 2-CD set, which faithfully duplicated the vinyl running order, included a reproduction of the booklet, scaled-down. Playing times are approximately 40 minutes long for CD1 and 35 minutes for CD2.\nTrack listing\nSide one\n}}\nSide two\nSide three\n| title5          = Groon\n| writer5         = Fripp\n| length5         = 3:30\n| extra5          = \"Cat Food/Groon\" single\n| title6          = Coda from Larks' Tongues in Aspic (Part I)\n| note6           =\n| writer6         = Cross, Fripp, Wetton, Bruford, Jamie Muir\n| length6         = 2:09\n| extra6          = ''Larks' Tongues in Aspic''\n}}\nSide four\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
