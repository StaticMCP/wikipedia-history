Kolzak Award recipient, Wanda Sykes at the 21st GLAAD Media Awards, Los Angeles, April 18, 2010.]]\nThe 21st GLAAD Media Awards was the 2010 annual presentation of the media awards presented by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. The awards seek to honor films, television shows, musicians and works of journalism that fairly and accurately represent the LGBT community and issues relevant to the community. The 21st annual award ceremony included 116 nominees in 24 English-language categories, and 36 Spanish-language nominees in eight categories.\nThe awards were presented in three separate shows: one in New York City on March 13, one in Los Angeles on April 18, and one in San Francisco on June 5. The Los Angeles event was hosted by Candis Cayne and Wilson Cruz. Alan Cumming hosted the New York awards, and Bruce Vilanch hosted the San Francisco event. Additional guests and presenters included Elizabeth Keener, Tom Ford, Benjamin Bratt and Rob Halford.\nComedian Wanda Sykes received the Stephen F. Kolzak Award, which is presented to an openly gay media professional who has made a difference promoting and advancing equal rights in the community. Sykes publicly came out in 2008 at a Las Vegas rally. She said of receiving the award, \"I greatly appreciate the work that GLAAD continues to do, promoting equality, fair representation and tolerance for our LGBT community. I just pray that I don't ruin what GLAAD has achieved with all of my shenanigans.\"\nActress Drew Barrymore received the Vanguard Award, which is presented to media professionals who have increased the visibility and understanding of the gay community. Barrymore was selected for her portrayal of a lesbian daughter of a widower in the film ''Everybody's Fine'', as well as her vocal support for same sex marriage. Barrymore said, \"I was born, bred and raised among diversity, it has defined me and made me the person I am today. I'm honored and humbled to be receiving this award.\" Actress Cynthia Nixon also received the Vito Russo Award, and the musical Hair received a special recognition.\nNominees\nWinning nominees are indicated by bold text.\nOutstanding Film – Wide Release\n* ''Everybody's Fine – Miramax Films\n* I Love You, Man – DreamWorks\n* Precious – Lions Gate Entertainment\n* 'A Single Man – The Weinstein Company'\n* Taking Woodstock – Focus Features\nOutstanding Film – Limited Release\n* Casi Divas – Maya Entertainment\n* The Country Teacher – Film Movement\n* 'Little Ashes – Regent Releasing'\n* Phoebe in Wonderland – THINKFilm\n* The Secrets – Monterey Media\nOutstanding Drama Series\n* 'Brothers & Sisters – ABC'\n* Grey's Anatomy – ABC\n* Mad Men – AMC\n* Skins – BBC America\n* True Blood – HBO\nOutstanding Comedy Series\n* Beautiful People – Logo\n* 'Glee – Fox'\n* Greek – ABC Family\n* Modern Family – ABC\n* United States of Tara – Showtime\nOutstanding Individual Episode (in a series without a regular LGBT character)\n* \"Homeward Bound\", Private Practice – ABC\n* \"Lisa Says\", The Listener – NBC\n* '\"Pawnee Zoo\", Parks and Recreation – NBC'\n* \"The Real Ghostbusters\", Supernatural – The CW\n* \"Wait and See\", Private Practice – ABC\nOutstanding TV Movie or Mini-Series\n* An Englishman in New York – Logo\n* Pedro – MTV\n* 'Prayers for Bobby – Lifetime'\n* Children of Earth – BBC America\nOutstanding Documentary\n* 'Ask Not – PBS'\n* Be Like Others – HBO\n* Derek – Sundance Channel\n* The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls – Diva Productions\n* U People – Logo/VH1\nOutstanding Reality Program\n* The Amazing Race 15 – CBS\n* Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List – Bravo\n* Making His Band – MTV\n* The Real World: Brooklyn – MTV\n* '''RuPaul's Drag Race – Logo/VH1\nOutstanding Daily Drama'\n* All My Children – ABC\n* As the World Turns – CBS\n* Guiding Light – CBS\n* 'One Life to Live – ABC\nOutstanding Music Artist'\n* Brandi Carlile – Give Up the Ghost (Sony Music Entertainment)\n* 'Lady Gaga – The Fame Monster (Interscope Records)'\n* Gossip – Music for Men (Sony Music Entertainment)\n* Adam Lambert – For Your Entertainment (19 Recordings/RCA Records)\n* Otep – Smash the Control Machine (Victory Records)\nOutstanding Talk Show Episode\n* '\"Ellen DeGeneres and Her Wife, Portia de Rossi\" – The Oprah Winfrey Show (syndicated)'\n* \"Hell to Pay – Gay Teen Exorcism\" – The Tyra Banks Show (The CW)\n* \"Mormon Church & Gays\" – The Joy Behar Show (HLN)\n* \"The Science of Intersex\" – The Dr. Oz Show (syndicated)\n* \"Sirdeaner Walker Interview\" – The Ellen DeGeneres Show (syndicated)\nOutstanding TV Journalism – Newsmagazine\n* \"40th Anniversary of Stonewall\" – In the Life (PBS)\n* \"Angie Zapata Murder Trial\" – InSession (truTV)\n* \"Bullied to Death?\" – Anderson Cooper 360° (CNN)\n* \"Gay Killings in Iraq\" – CNN Newsroom (CNN)\n* '\"Uganda Be Kidding Me\" – The Rachel Maddow Show (MSNBC)\nOutstanding TV Journalism Segment'\n* \"Gay Teen Mutilated\" – Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell (HLN)\n* \"Lt.
