It was held at the Literature House in Seoul on April 9, 2015. The selection committee was composed of 25 film professionals and regular audience members who met often to view and discuss new releases; their nomination list was further narrowed in the final voting stage by invited critics and programmers. 21 films were nominated across 10 categories from a pool of 60 narrative films and 30 documentaries, each with a budget under  () and released theatrically between January 1 and December 31, 2014.\nThe nine categories from the inaugural ceremony were expanded to ten this year. An overall Grand Prize (Daesang) and Best Screenplay were added, Best Director was divided into narrative films and documentaries, and Best New Actor or Actress was divided into two according to gender.
