His father was a chartered accountant and director of several corporations; his mother was a daughter of Professor Stirling.\nHe had a privileged life, growing up in North Adelaide, where he attended a small private school before St Peter's College. He completed his BSc in 1932, and Honours in Zoology at Adelaide University in 1933, while also studying art in North Adelaide.\nHe had a scholarship for further study at Melbourne University, but quit after one year and returned to Adelaide.\nHe became interested in conifers, and curated the herbarium attached to the University of Adelaide's Botany Department. He also planted them liberally at his family home \"Arbroath\", near Stirling, in the Adelaide Hills.\nFollowing the death of J. M. Black, author of The Flora of South Australia, the Adelaide Botanic Garden had need of a botanist to collate its various collections, which Booth filled until 1955, but he declined the offer of a full-time position as keeper of the State Herbarium, which instead went to Hansjörg Eichler, however Booth stayed on for another five months as an unpaid assistant, and a long-lasting friendship developed between the Booths and Hansjörg and Marlies Eichler.\nAnother strong friendship and artistic collaboration which developed during this period was with the botanical artist Ludwik Dutkiewicz.\nFrom 1955 Ted pursued personal interests: poetry, art and photography.\nRecognition\nIn 2011 Anna Stirling Pope, a granddaughter of Booth, created a personal tribute \"Ted's Story\", which is free to view on YouTube.
