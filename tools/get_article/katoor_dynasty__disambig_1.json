At the height its power under Mehtar Aman ul-Mulk the territory controlled by the dynasty extended from Asmar in the Kunar Valley to Sher Qilla in the Gilgit valley. The Mehtar of Chitral was an influential player in the power politics of the region as he acted as an intermediary between the rulers of Badakhshan, the Yousafzai Pashtuns, the Maharaja of Kashmir and later the Amir of Afghanistan.\nOrigins\nThe name Katoor is an ancient one and has been in use long before the ancestor of the Katoors settled in Chitral in 1520. According to one theory, Katoor was a Kushan title of nobility. Katoor also means dragon in the archaic Bashgali dialect of Kohistani. According to the royal history of the Katoor dynasty, their ancestor Ayub Baba who came to Chitral in 1520. The title of Shah Katoor was given to Mohtaram Shah, the first ruler of the house, by a local holy man who claimed that his bravery and integrity were reminiscent of the pre-Islamic Katoor rulers of the region.\nTerritorial expansion\nWhen the dynasty was first founded by Shah Katoor, his domains included lower Chitral, Kunar Valley, Lot-Kuh, Torkhow and Mulkhow regions of upper Chitral. Under Shah Katoor the II, Mastuj and the Yasin Valley also came under Katoor domination. The Kati and Kom tribes of Kafiristan, tribes of Dir Kohistan, Swat Kohistan and Kalam paid a yearly tribute to the Mehtar. Shah Katoor the III invaded Wakhan in retaliation for a raid on Chitral from Wakhan, and forced the Mir of Wakhan to pay tribute as well. In 1876, Mehtar Aman ul-Mulk conquered the Ghizer and Puniyal and laid siege to the Dogra garrison of the Maharaja of Kashmir in the Gilgit fort. During this time the tribes of Darel, Tangir and Kandia and the state of Nagar also paid tribute to the Mehtar of Chitral. The Katoor dynasty's influence reached its peak under Mehtar Aman ul-Mulk, when territories of Ghizer, Yasin and Ishkoman were conquered in 1880.\nRulers\nThe rulers of the Kator dynasty with the date of their accession\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n#\tSangeen Ali (I) 1560\n#       Muhtarram Shah Kator (I) 1585\n#\tSangeen Ali (II) 1655\n#\tMuhammad Ghulam 1691\n#\tShah Alam 1694\n#\tShah Muhammad Shafi 1696\n#\tShah Faramurd 1717\n#\tShah Afzal (I) 1724\n#\tShah Fazil 1754\n#\tShah Nawaz Khan 1757\n#\tShah Khairullah 1761\n#\tShah Muhtarram Shah Kator (II) 1788\n#\tShah Afzal (II) 1838\n#\tMuhtarram Shah Kator (III) 1854\n#\tAman ul-Mulk 1856\n#\tAfzal ul-Mulk 1892\n#\tSher Afzal 1892\n#\tNizam ul-Mulk 1892\n#\tAmir ul-Mulk 1895\n#\tShuja ul-Mulk 1895\n#\tNasir ul-Mulk 1936\n#\tMuzaffar ul-Mulk 1943\n#\tSaif-ur-Rehman 1949\n#\tMuhammad Saif-ul-Mulk Nasir 1954\n#\tFateh-ul-Mulk Ali Nasir 2011\n|}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
