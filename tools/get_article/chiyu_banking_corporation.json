Since its founding, it has spent more than HK$1 billion in education in the province, primarily through funding Jimei University and its related schools.\nOwnership\nBank of China (Hong Kong) gradually accumulated a 70% stake in Chiyu in the 1970s; the rest of the bank is held by the Jimei University foundation, the government of Xiamen Municipality City and minority shareholders.\nOn 27 March 2017, Bank of China (Hong Kong) disposed of all of its 70.49% of interests in Chiyu., selling most of it to Xiamen International Investment Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Xiamen International Bank Co. Ltd, and part of it (6.18% of Chiyu) to the Committee of Jimei Schools.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
