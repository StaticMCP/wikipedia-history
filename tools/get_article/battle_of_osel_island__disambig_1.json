It was fought near the island of Saaremaa (Ösel).\nIt led to a victory for the Russian captain Naum Senyavin, whose forces captured three enemy vessels, sustaining as few as eighteen casualties. It was the first Russian naval victory which did not involve ramming or boarding actions.\nBattle\nFive months after Charles XII of Sweden died at Fredrikshald, a Russian squadron of seven warships  assumed the offensive and Captains Naum Sinyaven and Konon Zotov attacked Commodore Anton Johan Wrangel near Osel Island.\nThe Russian ships engaged in convoying galleys and transports, which waged the campaign along the Swedish skerries, landing troops on the islands and the sea coast. The raid by the Russian forces bore a clearly expressed punitive- demonstrative character.\nSwedish flotilla of three vessels was defeated. All three Swedish ships were captured at the cost of 18 Russian casualties. The Swedish flagship Wachtmeister (1681) and a frigate were captured in heavy fighting.\nShips involved\nRussian Empire\n*Devonshire 52\n*Portsmouth 52\n*Raphail 52\n*Uriil 52\n*Varachail 52\n*Hyagudiil 52\n*Natalia 18\nSwedish Empire\n*Wachtmeister 52 - Captured\n*Karlskrona Vapen 30 - Captured\n*Bernhardus 10 - Captured\nNotes\nReferences\n*Naval Wars in the Baltic 1553-1850 (1910) - R.
