On 30 April 2020, it was announced that administrators had failed to find a buyer with the loss of 1,800 jobs.\nIn June 2020, the Warehouse brand, assets and stock, along with those of the Oasis chain, were acquired by online retailer Boohoo Group (now Debenhams Group), reuniting Warehouse with former sibling Coast, acquired by Boohoo as part of a separate takeover of the Karen Millen Group in 2019.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
