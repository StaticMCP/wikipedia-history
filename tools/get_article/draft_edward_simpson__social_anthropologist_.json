His research focuses on how abstract ideas and plans become concrete and tangible realities, often blending anthropology and art with planning and public policy. His work asks questions of the future and the strategies and tactics people use to get there. He has curated two exhibitions at the Brunei Gallery in London on The Future of the Rural World in India and Roadbuilding in South Asia and has worked extensively as a consultant on climate change and infrastructure.\nEducation and Career\nSimpson graduated from University of Manchester with a First Class Degree Social Anthropology and was awarded the Max Gluckman prize for a dissertation on Muslim political protest in Bradford against the publication of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses.\nHe received a PhD in Social Anthropology from London School of Economics and Political Science in 2001 for a dissertation on shipbuilding in western India supervised by Alfred Gell, Chris Fuller and Jonathan Parry.\nLater this work became one of the foundations of an intellectual friendship with Shaina Anand and Ashok Sukumaran from the Mumbai-based artist collective CAMP and the film Gulf to Gulf to Gulf (2011) which had global screenings and was purchased by Tate Modern in London.\nSimpson was granted the prestigious Nuffield New Career Development Fellowship to work with the Geographer Stuart Corbridge on post-disaster reconstruction in Gujarat following the devastating earthquake of 2001. This project ran for a decade exploring social and political consequences of the catastrophe attracting additional funding from the Economic and Social Research Council. It remains one of the few studies to follow the longer-term consequences of a natural disaster and was widely reviewed.\nSimpson has held various academic and leadership roles, including positions at SOAS, Goldsmiths, and the London School of Economics. At SOAS, he Directed the South Asia Institute, overseeing international partnerships, relations with diplomatic missions, and consultancy contracts. He was also Head of the Department of Anthropology and Sociology and Head of the College of Law, Anthropology and Politics.\nFrom 2013-2020 he directed a major programme of research on road-building and climate change in South Asia funded by the European Research Council and again working in partnership with the Mumbai-based arts collective CAMP.\nHe joined Lancaster University in 2023 as Executive Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, where he leads interdisciplinary initiatives and advocates for the value of arts, humanities and social sciences in the public life of the North West of England. He serves as an independent Parish Councillor and on the Boards of Lancaster Arts and the Peter Scott Gallery.\nPersonal Life\nSimpson is married to the potter Isabella Lepri.
