Situated on the western edge of Warwickshire near the border with Worcestershire, it is  southeast of Redditch and  northwest of Stratford-upon-Avon. The Roman road of Ryknild Street, now the A435, passes through the village on its eastern edge, parallel to the River Arrow. The name derives from the Old English leah, being a meadow or pasture, where horses, stod, are kept.\nThe United Kingdom Census 2021 reported Studley's population as being 6,040.\nHistory\nThe manor of Studley is recorded twice in the Domesday Book mostly as part of the lands of William son of Courbucion; who was appointed Sheriff of Warwick soon after 1086; where it reads:\nA further holding is listed as part of the land of William Bonavallet:\n}}\nIn the medieval period it was the site of a castle, the old castle was located just north of what is now St Mary's Church, and was possibly built around 1135-40, all that remains now is a circular rampart and ditch. This castle is unrelated to the nearby 19th-century house called Studley Castle. There is also the remains of a medieval priory. The Augustinian priory was founded in the 12th century by Peter Corbizun but was closed at the dissolution under Henry VIII and was used as a source of stone for other local buildings. Nothing remains today apart from the use of the name priory in a few local building names such as Priory Farm, which now much modernised, embodies a few fragmentary portions of a conventual building. A gabled west wall of stone rubble contains the remains of a large 14th-century window. A few medieval sculptured fragments are built on to the walls.\nThe Studley Inclosure Act 1817 (57 Geo. 3. c. 43 ) inclosed land in the parish.\nEconomy\nStudley is also known for being the site of a sewing needle and surgical needle making industry. This specialisation started when Elizabeth I permitted a number of Huguenot refugees to settle here, bringing this rare craft with them.\nFrom the 19th century, precision-made surgical needles were in demand, and, with advances in manufacturing technology, such was the demand that over 3,000 workers were employed. In 1977 the old factory where needles were made was burnt down, and the production of \"Aero\" needles moved to a nearby site. The original factory site now contains a supermarket, other retail outlets, and housing. One of the streets in the village is named \"Crooks Lane\", ostensibly because the crooked needles from the original factory were dumped at the end of this lane, but the road was there before the village had a needle factory.\nGovernance\nStudley has three levels of local governance:\n* Studley Parish Council currently comprises 11 councillors.\n* Studley North and Studley South are wards on Stratford-on-Avon District Council, and are represented by Liberal Democrat Councillors Peter Hencher-Serafin and Neil Edden, respectively.\n* Studley is a division on Warwickshire County Council, and is represented by Reform Councillor Luke Cooper.\nNationally it is part of Stratford-on-Avon constituency, whose current Member of Parliament is Manuela Perteghella of the Liberal Democrats. Before Brexit in 2020, it was included in the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament.\nGeography\nStudley is surrounded on the north, east and west by hills rising to about 500&nbsp;ft. The River Arrow flows across the south-west corner, through flat ground, but the country north and east of the brook is for the most part undulating and well wooded. The main village lies on the west bank of the river, along the Roman Ryknild Street, which is now the A435, Alcester Road. The fact that the church and the site of the castle are about half a mile away on the opposite side of the river indicates that the original settlement was, at some distance from the Roman Road. At Washford, half a mile north of Studley village, the main road bears right from the Ryknild Street and continues through the village of Mappleborough Green and up Gorcott Hill. The Ryknild Street (which between Washford and Ipsley diverges considerably from its original line) was, until the end of the 18th century, the main road to Birmingham; the present road between Spernall Ash (on the southern boundary of Studley parish) and Digbeth in Birmingham was turnpiked by an act of Parliament of 1721.\nNotable buildings\nThe parish church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin consists of a chancel, nave, south aisle and west tower. It features a 12th-century north wall and window of Norman date, fine surviving examples of opus spicatum or herringbone masonry, a medieval rood screen, Elizabethan era table and dug out chest, Jacobean era pulpit and brasses and other points of interest.\nThe survey of the clergy by the puritans in 1586 described the then vicar, Thomas Penford as; \"dumbe & vnlearned, a verie aged man, he can scarce reade, yet he hath learning enough for 2 benefices ; for he reapeth the fruite of Studley & Coughton both, he hath of late gotten him a certaine hireling to serue his turne at both places, one Robt. Cathell a seelie Welshman that can scarce reade English distinctlie. The valew of both is better then xx'' by the yeare\".\nThere is also St Mary's Church, a Roman Catholic church dating from 1853, designed by Charles Hansom, this is grade II listed.\nEducation\nStudley has 3 primary and one secondary school within the Warwickshire Local Education Authority (LEA) area.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:90%; border:0; text-align:left; line-height:150%;\"\n|-\n!  style=\"height:17px; background:#9cc; color:navy; width:175px;\"| School\n!  style=\"height:17px; background:#9cc; color:navy; width:130px;\"| Compulsory education stage\n!  style=\"height:17px; background:#9cc; color:navy; width:130px;\"| School website\n!  style=\"height:17px; background:#9cc; color:navy; width:200px;\"| Ofsted details\n|-\n!

They perform twice a year, once in April in a spring show, performing Oliver in 2010 and Fiddler on the Roof in April 2011 and a summer concert.\nJust outside the village on the Birmingham road is Studley Cricket Club, home to a social and sports club, members of the Birmingham and District Premier League, (top of the regional midlands structure).\nThere is also a large mixed sports and social club in Eldorado Close (Studley Sports & Social Club, commonly known as the Entaco).
