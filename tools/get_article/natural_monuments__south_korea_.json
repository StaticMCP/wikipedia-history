It is administered by the Cultural Heritage Administration according to the Natural Heritage Protection Law ().\n, a total of 702 items have received this designation. Of them, 132 are scenic sites and 570 are natural monuments. Only 472 of these continue to maintain their natural monument designation, and only 129 maintained their scenic site designation.\nHistory\nDuring the period of Japanese occupation, the Japanese authorities legislated the \"Rules to conserve artefacts and historic sites ()\" in July 1916, and a law called The Act of Conserving the Historic Sites, Natural Monuments, Scenic Sites and Treasures of Korea () was published in August 1933. After the liberation of Korea, the South Korean government legislated the Natural Heritage Protection Law in 1962.\nList\nThis is a partial list of the natural monuments of South Korea.\n1–50\nNumbers 2 to 7, 10, 12, 14 to 17, 20 to 26, 31 to 34, 37, and 41 to 47 were delisted due to these monuments being destroyed, deemed of lost value of preservation or located in unrestored regions of South Korea (now occupied by North Korea, which are matters South Korea deals in the Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left: 5px; font-size: 90%;\"\n! align=\"center\"| #\n! align=\"center\"| Name\n! align=\"center\"| Location\n! align=\"center\"| Description\n! align=\"center\"| Refs\n|-\n|1\n| (대구 도동 측백나무 숲)\n|Do-dong, Dong-gu, Daegu\n|A  forest of oriental arborvitae on the north slope of Mount Hyangsan. Previously thought to grow only in China, this area was determined in the early 1900s to be the southern boundary of the species. It was recorded by Seo Geojeong (1420–1488) in the Joseon dynasty as one of \"Ten Sceneries of Dalseong\" and called the \"Northern Wall Fragrant Forest\" (北壁香林).\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Lacebark Pine of Jae-dong in Seoul (서울 재동 백송)\n|Jae-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n|A lacebark pine on the grounds of the Constitutional Court of Korea. The trunk branches off into two sections that rise to a height of , but needs to be held up with supports to prevent the tree from falling over. Said to have been brought by an envoy from China, the tree is estimated to be about 600 years old, the oldest of this species in the country.\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Lacebark Pine of Susong-dong in Seoul (서울 조계사 백송)\n|Susong-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n|A lacebark pine at the Buddhist temple of Jogyesa. It reaches a height of  but its proximity to the main hall and the lack of growing space has weakened its condition. The tree is estimated to be about 500 years old and said to have been brought by an envoy from China, for which it is also called \"The Pine of Tang\" (唐松).\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Habitat of the White-bellied Black Woodpecker in Gwangneung (광릉 크낙새 서식지)\n|Bupyeong-ri, Jinjeon-eup, Namyangju, Gyeonggi-do\n|A  habitat of the white-bellied black woodpecker stretching across the cities of Pocheon and Namyangju. The planting of pine and fir in the forest surrounding King Sejo and Queen Jeonghui's tombs during the Joseon dynasty provided a good habitat for the species; the area was strictly protected for nearly 500 years. Rare to the point of near-extinction, the bird has not been observed in the Gwangneung area since 1989.\n|\n|-\n|13\n|Breeding Ground of Herons in Jincheon (진천 노원리 왜가리 번식지)\n|Nowon-ri, Iwol-myeon, Jincheon, Chungcheongbuk-do\n|A  heronry of grey and white herons near the village of Nowon-ri. Originally, the birds bred on a ginkgo tree estimated to be about 750 years old on the grounds of a private home; they have since moved on to the trees of the surrounding area. The local waters of the heronry include rice paddies, Miho-cheon, and its tributaries.\n|\n|-\n|18\n|Natural Habitat of Spleenwort of Sam-do (제주 삼도 파초일엽 자생지)\n|Bomok-dong, Seogwipo, Jeju-do\n|Spleenwort ferns on the cliffs of Sam-do. The island is this sub-tropical species' northern boundary and its only natural habitat in South Korea. The approximately 150 specimens have broad leaves up to  in length. Transplantation was used to stabilize the species after over-picking nearly wiped it out, although genetic testing has raised doubts as to the indigenousness of about half the ferns.\n|\n|-\n|19\n|Natural Habitat of Crinum Lily in Gujwa-eup (제주 토끼섬 문주란 자생지)\n|Hado-ri, Gujwa-eup, Jeju City, Jeju-do\n|Crinum lilies on the island of Nan-do. This is the northern boundary of this subtropical species and its only natural habitat in South Korea. Its seeds were likely carried to the island by the ocean current. Surrounded by rocks and covered in sand, Nan-do is a very suitable habitat for this species, whose white flowers bloom from July to September. The plant was nearly wiped out by over-picking but replanting and active protection has since seen it flourish.\n|\n|-\n|27\n|Habitat of Eels in Jeju-do (제주 무태장어 서식지)\n|Cheonjiyeon Waterfall and Saekdal-dong, Seogwipo, Jeju-do\n|A  habitat of marbled eel in Seogwipo. The area is the northern limit of this tropical species, which can only be spotted sporadically. Their spawning grounds are presumed to be in Taiwan, Okinawa, or perhaps even China and the Philippines, subsequently distributing into Korea by way of the ocean current. The inflow of pollutants is anticipated to have a negative effect on the habitat.\n|\n|-\n|28\n|Evergreen Forest of Judo Island (완도 주도 상록수림)\n|Judo, Wando-eup, Wando, Jeollanam-do\n|A  subtropical forest on the island of Judo. Although small in size, the island's virgin forest is home to hundreds of varieties of trees making it valuable for academic research. Since the tree line meets the water, the forest also provides an ideal shelter for the fish of the surrounding waters. Its excellent state of preservation is likely due to the presence of an animist shrine at the island's highest point, for which the island has traditionally been considered hallowed ground.\n|\n|-\n|29\n|Evergreen Forest at Mijo-ri (남해 미조리 상록수림)\n|Mijo-ri, Samdong-myeon, Namhae, Gyeongsangnam-do\n|A  forest on the east coast of Namhae County. It serves as a windbreak in winter for the nearby village of Mijo-ri and a shelter for the fish of the surrounding waters. It is home to a large variety of trees, including species common to the area such as silver magnolia, Japanese cinnamomum, and mochi trees, while its ground is covered in ardisia shrubs, mondo grass and holly leaf ferns. The forest is venerated by local residents who believe that as long as the forest flourishes, the village will produce people of great merit.\n|\n|-\n|30\n|Ginkgo Tree of Yongmunsa Temple (양평 용문사 은행나무)\n|Yongmun-myeon, Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi-do\n|A ginkgo tree at the Buddhist temple of Yongmunsa.

The tree was first registered as a natural monument in 1937 by the Japanese government general.\n|\n|-\n|36\n|Asian Fringe Tree of Ssangam-myeon (순천 평중리 이팝나무)\n|Ssangam-myeon, Suncheon, Jeollanam-do\n|An Asian fringe tree atop a hill near the village of Pyeongjung-ri. Near the ground the trunk splits into two and rises to a height of . The tree is in a poor state of health, with many of the upper branches beginning to wither and its leaves generally smaller than normal. Estimated to be about 400 years old, its blooming flowers are said to predict a good harvest.\n|\n|-\n|38\n|Higna Cherry Tree of Hwaeomsa Temple (구례 화엄사 올벚나무)\n|Gurye, Jeollanam-do\n|A higna cherry tree at Jijangam, a hermitage of the Buddhist temple of Hwaeomsa. Its two trunks rise to a height of . The tree was heavily damaged by wind in 1945 and today its condition is poor, with many withering branches in the crown. It is estimated to be about 300 years old, the oldest of this species in the country, and said to have been planted by the monk Byeogam Gakseong (1575–1660) in the Joseon dynasty.\n|\n|-\n|39\n|Torreya Tree of Byeongyeong-myeon (강진 삼인리 비자나무)\n|Samin-ri, Byeongyeong-myeon, Gangjin, Jeollanam-do\n|A torreya tree on the south slope of Mount Naejangsan. Compared to its modest height of , the crown is wide and has long branches. The area below has been reinforced with stone retaining walls, but the remaining root space is now very small. Estimated to be about 500 years old, the area surrounding the tree was home to an army garrison established by King Taejong (r. 1400–1418) that was in existence until 1894.\n|\n|-\n|40\n|Evergreen Forest at Yesong-ri (완도 예송리 상록수림)\n|Yesong-ri, Bogil-myeon, Wando, Jeollanam-do\n|A  forest on the south-east coast of Bogil-do. Planted about 300 years ago as a windbreak against typhoons, it stretches for about  along the beach. The forest is home to a wide variety of trees, including blacks pines as well as thick oleasters that twist and wind around the other trees. A one-hundred-year-old black pine within the forest is venerated by residents of Yesong-ri as a guardian deity, for which a ceremony is held every December to wish for the peace and security of the village.\n|\n|-\n|48\n|Natural Growth of Chinese Juniper in Tonggumi (울릉 통구미 향나무 자생지)\n|Namnyang-ri, Seo-myeon, Ulleung County, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n|A  habitat of Chinese juniper on Tonggumi, a cliff near the village of Namnyang-ri, Ulleung-do. The trees have largely grown out of the rock crevices in isolation from other species, sharing particular genetic traits unique to this area and making them valuable for research. They have grown twisted along the rock face due to the strong sea winds. An early description of the habitat is found in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty after a patrol of soldiers was forced ashore by a storm in 1724.\n|\n|-\n|49\n|Natural Growth of Chinese Juniper in Daepunggam (울릉 대풍감 향나무 자생지)\n|Taeha-ri, Seo-myeon, Ulleung County, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n|A  habitat of Chinese juniper on Daepunggam, a cliff near the village of Taeha-ri, Ulleung-do. Although once plentiful to this area, the species is now found only above the cliffs where the strong sea winds have prevented the trees from growing to their full height. The difficult terrain ensures that the trees grow in isolation from other species, while protecting them from human encroachment. An early description of the habitat is found in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty after a patrol of soldiers was forced ashore by a storm in 1724.\n|\n|-\n|50\n|Hemlock, Pine and Beech Trees in Taeha-dong (울릉 태하동 솔송나무·섬잣나무·너도밤나무군락)\n|Taeha-ri, Seo-myeon, Ulleung County, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n|A  community of southern Japanese hemlock, Japanese white pine, and Chinese beech in Taeha-dong.

The trees grow along a limestone hill, their height reaching . The low volume of traffic on the adjacent highway to Jecheon has had little adverse effect on the forest compared to the lime kiln that was once nearby. This area has proven to be relatively good for the species to grow, and may be its northern boundary in Korea. The floor of the forest is covered in ferns, and there have been discoveries of holly fern, which is normally found in more temperate climates.\n|\n|-\n|63\n|Natural Habitat of Formosa rice trees on Bijindo island (통영비진도의 팔손이나무자생지)\n|Bijin-ri, Hansan-myeon, Tongyeong, Gyeongsangnam-do\n|Formosa rice trees grow on the southern shore of Korea's mainland and on Geojedo Island. The Korean name of the tree, Palsoninamu (palsoni means “eight fingers”), originated from the fact that its leaves are divided into between 7 and 9 parts. It is also known as Palgakgeumban or Palgeumban. Bijindo Island in Hansan-myeon, Tongyeong City is a natural habitat of Formosa rice trees. This tree was once damaged by a typhoon. Camellias, magnolias, and ardisia japonica also grow in the vicinity. According to a local story about this species of tree, there was once an Indian princess named Vasba who received a set of twin rings as a 17th birthday present from her mother. One day, however, a maid who was cleaning the princess's room put the rings on her thumbs out of curiosity. Unfortunately, she couldn't pull the rings off her fingers, and became so frightened that she covered them up completely. To appease his sorrowful princess, the king had all the people in the palace searched for the rings, but when her turn came the maid only showed her eight fingers, and not her thumbs. At that moment, lightning flashed and thunder filled the air, and the maid was transformed into a palsoninamu. Bijindo Island in Tongyeong is significant as the northernmost habitat of Formosa rice trees, and has been designated as Natural Monument (No. 63) for its protection.\n|\n|-\n|64\n|Ginkgo Tree of Duseo-myeon (두서면의 은행나무)\n|Guryang-ri, Duseo-myeon, Ulju County, Ulsan\n|A ginkgo tree near the village of Jungni. Situated between agricultural fields, the tree reaches a height of . It was heavily damaged in 2003 by Typhoon Maemi, losing about a third of the trunk, and is now held aloft with metal supports. The tree is estimated to be about 550 years old. By tradition, it was planted in the early Joseon dynasty by the scholar Lee Jidae, who, after retiring from government service, brought the tree from the capital and planted it by the lotus pond at his home. In addition to being appreciated for its beauty, the tree was well known among villagers for its ability to give infertile women a son.\n|\n|-\n|65\n|Evergreen Forest of Mokdo (목도의 상록수림)\n|Bangdo-ri, Onsas-eup, Ulju County, Ulsan\n| A  forest on the uninhabited island of Mokdo, just offshore of Ulsan's Onsan Industrial Park. The island is the sole along Korea's east coast to have an evergreen forest, possessing flora which display the climatic features of the Korean peninsula. Sometimes called Chundo (椿島) for its plentiful camellia trees, records indicate that the island previously boasted 20 species of tree and 31 species of herb. It has also been called Jukdo (竹島) for its many bamboo trees, with which, according to tradition, arrows were made for the Imjin War and the Second Manhu Invasion, although the number of bamboo on the island has since dwindled.\n|\n|-\n|66\n|Northernmost Limit of Natural Growth of Camellia in Daecheongdo (대청도의 동백나무자생북한지)\n|Daecheong-ri, Baengnyeong-myeon, Ongjin County, Incheon\n|Camellias are distributed throughout Japan, China, and Korea. In Korea they grow mainly in the south coast area and on nearby islands. Although they usually blossom in early spring, camellias are also called “spring Camellias,” “fall Camellias,” or “winter Camellias” depending the season in which they blossom. Due to the warm ocean current, camellias grow well in the natural habitat in Daecheongdo Island. According to a record dated some 60 years ago, there were 147 Camellias with a diameter of over 20&nbsp;cm as well as some large ones measuring 3m in height and 27&nbsp;cm in diameter. However, nowadays, it is difficult to find large camellias, as the number of trees was drastically reduced all over the country due to illegal gathering. The natural habitat in Daecheongdo Island marks the northernmost extension of camellias. Since it is an important material for academic research, it has been designated as Natural Monument (No. 66).\n|\n|-\n|69\n|Orbicular Granite in Unpyeong-ri, Sangju (운평리구상화강암)\n|Unpyeong-ri, Nakdong-myeon, Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n|An orbicular bead is a round piece of stone that it is formed in particular environmental conditions, usually in granitic layers of rock. The orbicular granite in Unpyeong-ri contains a lot of diorite that is believed to have formed when magma rose to the earth’s surface during a massive diastrophism in the Korean Peninsula about 2.3 million years ago. Eight groups of granite boulders were discovered in Ungok-ri valley in Unpyeong-ri, to the southeast of Sangju, six of which are submerged below the water of the valley while two lie exposed above the water. Villagers refer to these granite boulders as 'turtle rocks' because of their supposed resemblance to turtle shells. Each orbicular bead has a diameter of 5-13 centimeters and a black edge. This kind of stone is only found in some 100 locations around the world. The orbicular granite found in Unpyeong-ri is a geologically rare material of considerable value to studies on the formation of rock. They have been designated and conserved as Natural Monument (No.69) as they provide important data for research on the composition of rock.\n|\n|-\n|73\n|Habitat of Manchurian Trouts near Jeongamsa Temple, Jeongseon(정선 정암사의 열목어서식지)\n|Gohan-ri, Gohn-eup, Jeongseon County, Gangwon-do\n|The Manchurian trout is a species of freshwater fish that lives in water at a temperature of less than 20&nbsp;°C. Its skin is covered with small irregular red spots against a silvery-white background. During spawning time, its whole body becomes red, and its dorsal and pectoral fins acquire a rainbow-like luster. It usually feeds on the larvae of insects in water and small fish. In Korea, Manchurian trout are found in the Amnokgang, Dumangang, Cheongcheongang, Daedonggang, and Hangang Rivers and in the upper reaches of the Nakdonggang River. In summer they stay in cooler areas, usually in the upper reaches of a river, while in winter they remain in midstream areas.

Named \"Gyoyangmok\" in Chinese characters since it bears new leaves and loses the old ones, it makes for a good garden tree and enjoys popularity as a roadside tree. The Population of Macropodous Daphniphyllum is situated at the summit of a mountain in front of Naejangsa Temple. A big Daphniphyllum macropodum is rarely seen in Korea and the inhabitants call the leaves of the tree “Manbyeongcho” as the leaves resemble a medicinal herb Manbyeongcho. Since the northernmost habitat has academic value, the population of Daphniphyllum macropodum in Naejangsan Mountain is designated and protected as a natural monument.\n|\n|-\n|93\n|Turtelary Forest of Seongnam-ri, Wonseong (원성 성남리 성황림)\n|Seongnam-ri, Sillim-myeon, Wonju, Gangwon-do\n|Seonghwangnim (Tutelary Forest) means a forest where a local god who protects the town lives. The shrine woods in Seongnam-ri, Wonseong, is a little far from town. Villagers in Seongnam-ri have believed the local god of Chiaksan Mountain to be their guardian. Seonghwangnim consists of many trees such as Carstor Aralia and Rubus coreanus. The people in the village performed a sacrificial ritual for the god wishing for the well-being and peace of the town twice a year on April 8 and September 9. The Tutelary Forest of Seongnam-ri, Wonseong, has representative deciduous trees of temperate regions as well as biological value.

Manjanggul Lava Tube which is one of the largest lava tubes in the world is about 7.4 kilometers long. There are many lava tubes formations such as lava stalactites, lava stalagmites, and lava stone pillars. The tracks of lava flow on the floor serve as valuable data for researching the process of lava tubes formation. On the other hand, Gimnyeonggul Lava Tube is about 700 meters long. The tracks of lava flow remain on its floor, with hardened lava shaped like a waterfall found at the end of the tube. Unlike lime caves, Gimnyeonggul and Manjanggul Lava Tubes in Jeju-do were formed by lava. As these two lava tubes are world-renowned in scale and are valuable data for research, they are designated and protected as a natural monument.\n|\n|-\n|}\n100–199\nNumbers, 102  104  105  109  113  116  117 .118, 119 ,120  121 125 127 ,128 129 130 .131,132, 133.134 135,137,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,148,149,157,181,186,187,188 were delisted due to these monuments being destroyed, deemed of lost value of preservation or located in unrestored regions of the Republic of Korea (now occupied by the DPRK, which are matters South Korea deals in the Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces), or simply unregistered.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left: 5px; font-size: 90%;\"\n! align=\"center\"| #\n! align=\"center\"| Name\n! align=\"center\"| Location\n! align=\"center\"| Description\n! align=\"center\"| Refs\n|-\n|101\n| Sanctuary of Tundra Swans on Jindo Island(진도고니류도래지)\n|1422, Suyu-ri, Jindo-eup, Jindo-gun, Jeollanam-do\n|An egret breeds in Europe, Russia, Mongolia, and China.
