The awards were introduced by ARIA Chairman, Paul Turner, who explained the nomination and voting procedures. Presenters of the 20 awards included Slim Dusty, Basia Bonkowski and Donnie Sutherland. The ceremony was not televised. The most successful artist was John Farnham with his album (Whispering Jack) and its associated single, \"You're the Voice\" helping him win six awards.\nHistory\nCountdown was an Australian pop music TV series on national broadcaster ABC-TV from 1974&ndash;1987, it presented music awards from 1979&ndash;1987, initially in conjunction with magazine TV Week which had sponsored the previously existing 'King of Pop' Awards. After Cold Chisel performed at the 1980 awards ceremony, and then trashed their instruments and the set, sponsors TV Week withdrew their support and Countdown held its own awards ceremonies until the 1986 awards which were broadcast in 1987. The awards ceremony was co-produced by Carolyn James (aka Carolyn Bailey) during 1981&ndash;1984 in collaboration with the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), which provided peer voting for some awards. Countdown provided coupons in the related Countdown Magazine for viewers to vote for some awards including 'Most Popular Male Performer', 'Most Popular Female Performer', 'Most Popular Group' and 'Most Popular International Act'. At the 1985 awards ceremony (held in April 1986) fans of INXS and Uncanny X-Men scuffled and as a result ARIA decided to hold their own awards.\nARIA instituted its own entirely peer-voted Australian Record Industry Awards. The first awards ceremony was held on 2 March 1987 at the Sheraton Wentworth Hotel in Sydney with Elton John as the host. The awards were introduced by ARIA Chairman, Paul Turner, who explained the nomination and voting procedures. The eligibility period was for material released in the previous calendar year with the final five nominees determined by independent auditors, Deloitte, Haskin & Sells. Presenters of the 20 awards included John, Turner, promoter-manager Glenn Wheatley, Country music veteran Slim Dusty, Music Around the World host Basia Bonkowski, and Sounds Unlimited host Donnie Sutherland. The 1987 ceremony was not televised, host John recommended that it not be televised in future:|Elton John}}\nAnthony O'Grady, an Australian music journalist, cited ARIA founder and spokesperson Peter Rix, \"Not that the first awards would have been allowed on TV ... The boys and girls really let their hair down that night – every acceptance speech was crammed with expletive-deletives.\" John Farnham was the most successful artist on the night, with his album Whispering Jack and its associated single, \"You're the Voice\" winning six awards from ten nominations.\nAwards and nominations\nWinners are listed first and bolded, other final nominees (where known) are listed alphabetically.\nARIA Awards\n*Album of the Year\n**'John Farnham –Whispering Jack'\n***Crowded House – Crowded House\n***Hunters & Collectors – Human Frailty\n***Paul Kelly & the Coloured Girls – Gossip\n***Spy vs Spy – A.O.
