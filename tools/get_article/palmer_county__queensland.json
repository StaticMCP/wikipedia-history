From 30 November 2015, the government no longer referenced counties and parishes in land information systems however the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying retains a record for historical purposes.\nThe centre of local government for the county is Charleville, Queensland just outside the county to the northeast and the postal code is 4470.\nReferences"
