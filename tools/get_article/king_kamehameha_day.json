It honors Kamehameha the Great (Kamehameha I), the monarch who first established the unified Kingdom of Hawaii—comprising the Hawaiian Islands of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lānai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii. In 1883 a statue of King Kamehameha was dedicated in Honolulu by King David Kalākaua (this was a duplicate, because the original statue was temporarily lost at sea but was recovered and is now located in North Kohala, island of Hawaiʻi). There are duplicates of this statue in Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, D.C., and in Hilo, island of Hawaiʻi.\nEstablishment\nKing Kamehameha Day, June 11, was first proclaimed by Kamehameha V (on December 22, 1871) as a day to honor his grandfather, Kamehameha I. It was almost meant as a replacement for Hawaiian Sovereignty Restoration Day (on July 31) which the king and ministers disliked due to its association with the Paulet Affair.\nThe first observance of the holiday happened the following year. Late 19th century celebrations of  Kamehameha Day featured carnivals and fairs, foot races, horse races and velocipede races.  Kamehameha Day was one of the first holidays proclaimed by the Governor of Hawaii and the Hawaii State Legislature when Hawaii achieved statehood in 1959.\nIn contemporary Hawai'i, Kamehameha Day is treated with elaborate events harkening back to ancient Hawaii, respecting the cultural traditions that Kamehameha defended as his society was slowly shifting towards European trends. The King Kamehameha Hula Competition attracts hula groups from all over the world to the Neil S. Blaisdell Center for the two-day event. Prizes are awarded on the second night.\nFloral parade\nA floral parade is held annually at various locations throughout the state of Hawaii. On the island of Oahu, the parade runs from Iolani Palace in downtown Honolulu past Honolulu Harbor and the Prince Kūhiō Federal Building through Kakaako, Ala Moana and Waikīkī, ending at Kapiolani Park. June 11 is also the anniversary of the dedication of Kapiolani Park. The floral parade features local marching bands—including the Royal Hawaiian Band (the oldest municipal band in the United States)—and artistically designed floats using native flowers and plants. Many local companies enter floats for their employees.\nA favorite floral parade feature is the traditional royal pau riders. They represent a royal court led by a queen on horseback, followed by princesses representing the eight major islands of Hawaii and Molokini. Each princess is attended by pau ladies in waiting. Pau women are dressed in colorful and elegant 19th century riding gowns accented with lei and other floral arrangements.\nAfter the parade, the state celebrates a Hoolaulea, literally celebration, or block party with food and music. Cultural exhibitions are also scattered throughout Kapiolani Park—arts and crafts, games, sports, and other events planned by the Bishop Museum, the premier Hawaiian cultural institution.\nOn the Island of Hawaii, there are three floral parades held. One between the towns of Hawi and Kapaau and one in the town of Hilo. There is a King Kamehameha Day Celebration Parade and Hoolaulea in Kailua Kona on Alii Drive each year.  There is also a lei draping ceremony in Kapaau at the statue of King Kamehameha there.\nDraping ceremony\nThe most important ritual of the celebration dates back to 1901 after the Territory of Hawaii was established. It is the afternoon draping ceremony in which the Kamehameha Statue in front of Aliiolani Hale and Iolani Palace on King Street in downtown Honolulu is draped in long strands of lei. The same is done at the Kamehameha Statue on the former monarch's home island, the Big Island of Hawaii. Outside of the state, a similar draping ceremony is held at the United States Capitol where the Kamehameha Statue there is also draped in lei in the company of federal officials.\nCelebration\nThe celebration includes a traditional Pa‘u Parade and a Ho‘olaule‘a. The celebrations are organized by the King Kamehameha Celebration Commission and other community organizations.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://ags.hawaii.gov/kamehameha/ King Kamehameha Celebration Commission]"
