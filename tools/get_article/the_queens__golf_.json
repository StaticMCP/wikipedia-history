The tournament was contested by teams representing the tours of Japan, Korea, Australia and Europe. Hosts Japan led from start to finish to win the inaugural tournament 4–6 December 2015.\nFormat\nThe cup was played over three days with four teams of nine players each.\nIn 2015, there were 34 matches – eight four-balls day one, eight foursomes day two, and 18 singles on the final day. Three points were awarded for each win and one point for halved matches. This is a similar format to the Solheim Cup. The winner was based on cumulative score over all three days.\nIn 2016, the format changed in two ways. Two points were awarded for each win and one point for halved matches. Based on the score from the first two days (foursomes and four-balls), the leading two teams faced off on the third day in singles matches for the championship and the third and fourth place team played for third place.\nIn 2017, the format changed again. On the first day eight four-ball matches were played and on the second day nine singles matches were played. Based on the score from the first two days, the leading two teams faced off in foursomes on the third day for the championship and the third and fourth place team played for third place.\nWinners\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Year!!Winner!!Runner-up!!Third place!!Fourth place\n|-\n| 2017 ||  Japan ||  Korea ||  Australia ||  Europe\n|-\n| 2016 ||  Korea ||  Japan ||  Europe || Australia\n|-\n| 2015 ||  Japan ||  Korea ||  Europe || Australia\n|}\nResults\n2015\nAfter the final round at Miyoshi Country Club in 2015, the Japanese team ended with 41 points, just three ahead of the Koreans, who won eight of their nine singles matches.
