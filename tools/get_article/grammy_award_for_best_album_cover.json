The award is scheduled to be presented for the first time at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards in 2026, as a complement to the Best Recording Package category, and sits in the Package, Notes & Historical field.\nThe academy announced the new category in June 2025, stating that the award \"recognizes excellence in cover art for albums or recordings of any genre of music released for the first time during the eligibility year. The elements judged in this category include the creativity, design, illustration, photography, and/or graphic art of the album cover.\" The eligibility criteria stipulates that the cover must be \"predominantly new\", and that reissued recordings with minor artwork changes are not eligible. Submissions for this category are also able to be submitted to the Best Recording Package category.\nThe award goes to the art director(s) of the album.\nBackground\nFrom the first Grammy Awards in 1959 to 1961, the Best Recording Package category was known as Best Album Cover, and was won by Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely, Shostakovich: Symphony No. 5, and Latin ala Lee! during this time. The category was later split into Classical and Non-Classical divisions from 1962 to 1965, and then into Graphic Arts and Photography divisions from 1966 to 1968. It returned back to Best Album Cover in 1969 until 1973, and was won by Underground, America the Beautiful, Indianola Mississippi Seeds, Pollution, and The Siegel–Schwall Band during this time. From 1974 onwards, the category was known as Best Album Package (1974-1993) and then its current name (1994-present).\nThe establishment of a separate Best Album Cover category was announced alongside Best Traditional Country Album. Regarding the need for a specific category honoring album covers, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. stated: \"In today's digital world, album covers are arguably more impactful than ever. Chances are, there's an iconic cover that's instantly recognizable to you, even if you never owned the physical album. Their cultural significance is undeniable. That's one of the reasons members of the art director community and our Awards & Nominations members felt this Category was necessary. The Packaging Field has always thrived, but we expect this to be one of our most inclusive Categories to date.\"\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Nominees for the Grammy Award for Best Album Cover\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"15%\" | Art Director(s)\n! width=\"15%\" | Work\n! width=\"15%\" | Performing artist(s)\n! width=\"35%\" class=unsortable|NomineesPerformers are in parentheses\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2026\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
