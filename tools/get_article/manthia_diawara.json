He holds the title of University Professor at New York University (NYU), where he is Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs.\nBiography\nDiawara was born in Bamako, Mali, and received his early education in France. He later received a PhD from Indiana University in 1985. Prior to teaching at NYU, Diawara taught at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California at Santa Barbara.\nMuch of his research has been in the field of black cultural studies. Diawara has sought to incorporate consideration of the material conditions of African Americans to provide a broader context for the study of African diasporic culture. An aspect of this formulation has been the privileging of \"Blackness\" in all its possible forms rather than as relevant to a single, perhaps monolithic definition of black culture.\nDiawara has contributed significantly to the study of black film. In 1992, Indiana University Press published his African Cinema: Politics & Culture  and in 1993, Routledge published a volume he edited entitled Black-American Cinema. A filmmaker himself, Diawara has written and directed a number of films.\nHis 1998 book In Search of Africa is an account of his return to his childhood home of Guinea and was published by Harvard University Press.\nDiawara is the editor-in-chief of Renaissance Noire, a journal of arts, culture, and politics dedicated to work that engages contemporary Black concerns. He serves on the advisory board of October, and is also on the editorial collective of Public Culture.\nIn 2003, Diawara released ''We Won't Budge: A Malaria Memoir'', the title a tribute to Salif Keita's anthemic protest song \"Nou Pas Bouger\". The book was described by The Village Voice as \"by turns elegiac, unsentimental, angry, and wise....his story unfolds in the triumphant days post-1960 (when Mali gained independence from France), trips into reverie for a youth spent in thrall to rock and roll, and evokes his awakenings to art and racism in the West.\"\nDiawara serves on the board of TransAfrica Forum, alongside Harry Belafonte, Danny Glover, and Walter Mosley, which supported Barack Obama's successful candidacy for president in 2008.\nIn 2015, he was featured in the documentary Sembene! on the life and career of legendary Senegalese filmmaker Ousmane Sembene, a filmmaker Diawara himself profiled in his own documentary on the filmmaker, Sembene: the Making of African Cinema.\nIn 2022, Diawara directed AI: African Intelligence an essay documentary. The film had its international premiere on February 18, 2023, at the Berlin International Film Festival\nFellowships and honors\nJury Member, The National Black Programming Consortium, Inc., Columbus, Ohio, 1992, 1989; Jury Member, The Paul Robeson Award, The Pan-African Film Festival of Ouagadougou, 1987; NAACP Top of the Mountain Award, 1998.\nWorks\nSelected bibliography\n;Books (author)\n*\n*\n*\n*The 1960s in Bamako: Malick Sidibé and James Brown.
