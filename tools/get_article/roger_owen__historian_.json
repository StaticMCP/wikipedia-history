His work also explored theories of imperialism and military occupations. Owen authored several influential books and held prominent academic positions, including professorships at the University of Oxford and Harvard University.\nBiography\nOwen studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) at Magdalen College, Oxford (1956–1959) before earning a DPhil in Economic History at St Antony's College, Oxford (1960–1964), under the supervision of Middle East scholar Albert Hourani. His thesis on Egyptian cotton production and 19th-century economic development was later published as a book.\nIn the 1960s, Owen became a key figure in the expansion of Middle Eastern studies at Oxford. Appointed to a post in Economic and Social History in 1964, he later served multiple terms as Director of St Antony's College Middle East Centre (1971–1974, 1980–1982, 1986–1988, 1991–1993). He later held the A.J. Meyer Professorship of Middle East History at Harvard University and directed its Center for Middle Eastern Studies (CMES).\nBeyond academia, Owen contributed analysis to English-language Arab newspapers, including Al-Hayat and Al-Ahram. He was a member of the Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA). Owen died on 23 December 2018.\nAwards and honors\n* 2007: Doctorate in Humane Letters, American University in Cairo.\n* 2010: \"Award for Outstanding Contributions to Middle Eastern Studies\" from the World Congress for Middle Eastern Studies (WOCMES).\n* 2012: Giorgio Levi Della Vida Medal for Excellence in Islamic Studies, awarded by the UCLA Von Grunebaum Center.\nSelected works\n* [https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674735378 The Rise and Fall of Arab Presidents for Life].
