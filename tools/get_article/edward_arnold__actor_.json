His schooling came at the East Side Settlement House.\nActing career\nStage\nArnold was interested in acting ever since he appeared on stage as Lorenzo in The Merchant of Venice at age 12. He made his professional stage debut in 1907 and had important roles in several plays on Broadway in the 1920s and 1930s. Among them is the 1927 revival of The Jazz Singer, with Arnold as the second lead to the star, George Jessel.\nFilm\nHe found work as an extra for Essanay Studios and World Studios, before landing his first significant role in 1916's The Misleading Lady. He returned to the stage in 1919, and did not appear in movies again until his talkie debut in Okay America! (1932). He recreated one of his stage roles in one of his early films, Whistling in the Dark (1933). His role in the 1935 film Diamond Jim boosted him to stardom. He reprised the role of Diamond Jim Brady in the 1940 film Lillian Russell. He played a similar role in The Toast of New York (1937), another fictionalized version of real-life business chicanery, for which he was billed above Cary Grant on posters, with his name in much larger letters.\nArnold appeared in over 150 movies. Although he was labeled \"box office poison\" in 1938 by an exhibitor publication (he shared this dubious distinction with Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West, Fred Astaire and Katharine Hepburn), he never lacked work. Rather than continue in leading man roles, he gave up losing weight and went after character parts instead. He said, \"The bigger I got, the better character roles I received.\" He was so sought-after, he often worked on two pictures at once.\n; from the trailer for Annie Get Your Gun (1950)]]\nArnold was expert as rogues and authority figures, and superb at combining the two as powerful villains quietly pulling strings. He was best known for his roles in Come and Get It (1936), ''Sutter's Gold (1936), the aforementioned The Toast of New York (1937), You Can't Take It with You (1938), Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), Meet John Doe (1941), and a larger than life star turn as Daniel Webster in The Devil and Daniel Webster'' (1941). He was the first to portray Rex Stout's famous detective Nero Wolfe, starring in Meet Nero Wolfe (1936), based on the first novel in the series.\nHe played blind detective Duncan Maclain in two movies based on the novels by Baynard Kendrick, Eyes in the Night (1942) and The Hidden Eye (1945).\nLeonard Maltin stated, \"Few character actors achieved the particular kind of stardom that came to Edward Arnold in the 1930s, playing historical figures and dynamic, larger-than-life characters. Burly and round-faced, with piercing eyes and sharp nose, Arnold was a commanding presence.\" Leslie Halliwell called him \"Rotund but dynamic actor who played go-getter leading roles in the thirties. Although he later became typed as kindly father/apoplectic business man, he never lost his popularity.\" Halliwell further praised him \"For maintaining an ebullient star personality through two decades of talkies, despite his unromantic physique.\"\nAn image of Arnold made a posthumous appearance in the 1984 film Gremlins as the deceased husband (visible in a large framed photograph) of Mrs. Deagle, a character much like the rich, heartless characters Arnold was known for. Director Joe Dante mentioned that they received permission from Arnold's family to use his image.\nRadio\nFrom 1947 to 1953, Arnold starred in the ABC radio program Mr. President. He also played a lawyer, Mr. Reynolds, on The Charlotte Greenwood Show. In 1953, he hosted Spotlight Story on the Mutual network.\nTelevision\nArnold hosted Your Star Showcase, \"a series of 52 half-hour television dramas ... released by Television Programs of America.\" It was launched January 1, 1954, and ran in 150 cities. He co-starred in \"Ever Since the Day\", an episode of Ford Theatre on NBC.\nPersonal life\nin which American Federation of Labor officials denied issuing a \"clarification\" which set off the film strike, October 26, 1946.(L-R): James Skelton, Herbert Sorrell, Ronald Reagan, Edward Arnold, Roy Tindall, George Murphy, and Gene Kelly.]]\nArnold was married three times: to Harriet Marshall (1917–1927), with whom he had three children—Elizabeth, Jane, and William (who had a short movie career as Edward Arnold Jr.); to Olive Emerson (1929–1948), and to Cleo McLain (1951 until his death)\nArnold was president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1940 to 1942. In 1940, his autobiography Lorenzo Goes to Hollywood was published. He was the co-founder of the I Am an American Foundation.\nStarting in the 1940s, Arnold became involved in Republican politics and was mentioned as a possible candidate for the United States Senate. In 1950, he announced his candidacy for the open U.S. Senate seat from California, but withdrew soon after, saying he did not have enough time to mount a campaign. He lost a closely contested election for Los Angeles County Supervisor and said at the time that perhaps actors were not suited to run for political office.\nArnold supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election.\nArnold died at his home in Encino, California, at age 66, from a cerebral hemorrhage associated with atrial fibrillation. He was interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery.\nRecognition\nMidwestern University awarded Arnold the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (D.Litt) on May 24, 1951. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6225 Hollywood Boulevard in the recording category on February 8, 1960.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Film\n!
