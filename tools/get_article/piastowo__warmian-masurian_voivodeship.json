It lies approximately  west of Milejewo,  north-east of Elbląg, and  north-west of the regional capital Olsztyn.\nHistory\nThe village was part of the Kingdom of Poland until the First Partition of Poland in 1772, when it was annexed by Prussia. In 1871 it became part of Germany, within which it was administratively part of the province of East Prussia. During World War II, in 1944–1945, it was the location of a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp, in which the German Organisation Todt imprisoned over 5,000 women as forced labour. Following Germany's defeat in World War II, in 1945, the village was reintegrated with Poland.\nReferences"
