Month and date !! Event type !! Details\n|-\n|1968 || July 18 || Companylogo || Intel is founded by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, who had both left Fairchild Semiconductor.\n|-\n|1969 || May 1 || Competition || Advanced Micro Devices is founded by Jerry Sanders. This company would become the second-largest supplier and only significant rival to Intel in the market for x86-based microprocessors.\n|-\n|1970 || October || Products || Intel comes out with its 3rd product, the Intel 1103, which put Intel on the map.\n|-\n|1971 || October 13 || Company || Intel goes IPO at a price of $23.50 a share. At 350,000 shares, this sums to a total of $8.225M. Intel becomes one of the very first companies to be listed on the then-newly established National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) stock exchange.\n|-\n| 1971 || November 15 || Product || Intel launches its first microprocessor, the 4004.\n|-\n| 1972 || April || Product || Intel announces the first 8-bit microprocessor, the 8008.\n|-\n|1974 || April || Product || Intel launches the Intel 8080 microprocessor, the first general-purpose microprocessor, featuring 4,500 transistors. This finally kickstarts computer development.\n|-\n|1976 || || Product || Intel launches the Intel MCS-48 series of microcontrollers, the world's first microcontrollers (which combine a CPU with memory, peripherals, and input-output functions).\n|-\n|1978 || June || Product || Intel introduces the 8086 16-bit microprocessor, which becomes the industry standard (for the x86 instruction set).\n|-\n|1979 || November || Product || Intel launches \"Operation Crush\", a campaign to establish the 8086 as the standard for the 16-bit microprocessor market (which was competing with the technically superior Motorola 68000).

Compaq was one of several IBM clones that would adopt Intel processors, which shifted control of the computing industry from IBM to Intel.\n|-\n|1986 || || Legal || The US-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement is signed, opening up Japanese markets to US semiconductor markets.\n|-\n|1989 || April 10 || Product || Intel introduces the 80486 microprocessor, which it sole-sources for 4 years. This offers backwards compatibility.\n|-\n|1989 || October || Marketing || Intel launches the \"Red X\" marketing campaign by discrediting its original 16-bit and 8-bit products, in order to encourage more people to adopt 32-bit computing.\n|-\n|1990 || June 3 || Team || Robert Noyce suddenly dies from a heart attack.\n|-\n|1990 || November || Competition || Intel loses its suit against AMD. This loss allows AMD to create clones of the 386 processor.\n|-\n| 1991 || Spring || Product || Intel decides that it will stick with CISC architecture, and cuts off support for RISC architecture, which was internally developed by Les Kohn.\n|-\n| 1991 || || Company || Intel starts the Intel Inside marketing campaign.\n|-\n| 1992 || || Competition || Intel becomes the top-ranked seller for semiconductor sales. It has retained its top ranking ever since.\n|-\n| 1993 || March || Product || Intel launches the Pentium processor, which has 3.1 million transistors, initial speeds of 60 MHz, features an integrated floating-point unit, and is built on a 0.8 micron bi-CMOS process.\n|-\n| 1994 || December || Product || Intel suffers a public relations disaster when CNN publicized the story that there was a flaw in the way that the Pentium chip did division. Intel argued that the flaw was irrelevant, but then IBM halted shipments of Pentium-based computers, forcing Intel to reverse course and offer a no-questions-asked return policy.\n|-\n| 1995 || November 1 || Product || Intel launches the Pentium Pro processor, a high-performance chip targeted for 32-bit workstations.\n|-\n| 1996 || October 22 || Product || Intel launches the Pentium MMX product line.\n|-\n| 1997 || May 7 || Product || Intel launches the Pentium II line of processors, which is Intel's sixth-generation microarchitecture (P6).\n|-\n| 1998 || April 1 || Company || Intel wins sponsorship rights to the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.\n|-\n| 1998 || June 29 || Product || Intel rolls out the Intel Pentium II Xeon processor, Intel's new high-end solution for the workstation and server markets.\n|-\n| 1998 || August 24 || Product || Intel launches the first processor for the budget PC market segment, the Intel Celeron processor.\n|-\n| 1999 || February 26 || Product || Intel launches the Pentium III generation of microprocessors, which features the addition of the SSE instruction set (to accelerate floating point and parallel calculations).\n|-\n| 1999 || October || Company || The Dow Jones Industrial Average adds Intel to its list.\n|-\n| 2000 || || Company || Intel launches Intel Research.\n|-\n| 2000 || November || Product || Intel introduces the Pentium 4 processor, with an initial speed of 1.5 GHz.\n|-\n| 2001 || May || Legal, competition || Intel and Advanced Micro Devices make a patent cross-license agreement between the companies.\n|-\n| 2003 || March || Product || Intel launches the Pentium M mobile processor, along with the Centrino processor technology for laptop PCs, which made wireless compatibility a standard for laptop computers.\n|-\n| 2004 || February || Product || Intel announces that it will implement its first 64-bit processor, and releases the Nocona in June 2004.\n|-\n|2005 || May 25 || Product || Intel launches the Pentium D dual-core processor.\n|-\n|2005 || June || Legal, competition || AMD files lawsuit against Intel, claiming that Intel engaged in unfair competition by offering rebates to Japanese PC manufacturers who agreed to eliminate or limit purchases of microprocessors made by AMD or a smaller manufacturer, Transmeta.
