Investigations listed here concern interception of voicemail, hacking of computers, obtaining confidential information under false pretenses, and payments to officials. Dates in parentheses indicate approximately when each investigation was initiated or considered.\nPrior to 2010 investigations focused on just a few individuals, even though there was evidence of many people being engaged in illegal activity. \"The lead investigator in Operation Motorman, a 2006 inquiry...said that his team were told not to interview journalists involved. The investigator...accused authorities of being too 'frightened' to tackle journalists.\" In August 2006, the Metropolitan Police Service (Scotland Yard) seized from a private investigator (Glenn Mulcaire) “11,000 pages of handwritten notes listing nearly 4,000 celebrities, politicians, sports stars, police officials and crime victims whose phone may have been hacked by News of the World.” These documents remained largely unevaluated until the autumn of 2010, even though “senior Scotland Yard officials assured Parliament, judges, lawyers, potential hacking victims, the news media and the public that there was no evidence of widespread hacking by the tabloid.” Testimony indicated that “the police agency and News International … became so intertwined that they wound up sharing the goal of containing the investigation. Through March 2011, no News of the World executives or reporters other than Goodman were questioned.\nBy September 2012, The Metropolitan Police had a total of 185 officers investigating illegal acquisition of confidential information at a cost estimated at £9 million for 2012 and £40 million forecast over four years. This included 96 officers investigating under Operation Weeting, 70 under Operation Elveden and 19 under Operation Tuleta.\nBy law enforcement organizations\n(Scotland Yard) in 2002 and 2006 were limited to just a few individuals, even though there was evidence of widespread phone hacking.]]\nsubsidiaries there also used illegal methods to acquire confidential information.]]\n# UK Metropolitan Police Operation Nigeria; (May 1999-September 1999) surveillance of Southern Investigations run by the anti-corruption squad CIB3.\n# UK Metropolitan Police Operation Glade; (2003) Followed up on evidence obtained in Operation Motorman\n# US FBI Investigation; (2004) computer hacking\n# UK Metropolitan Police Investigation; (2006) headed by Andy Hayman and limited to Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire\n# UK Metropolitan Police Review; (2009) decision made by John Yates not to reopen/broaden the 2006 investigation\n# US FBI Investigation; (2010) probe into a group of hackers who reportedly stole compromising pictures and video from the computers and mobile devices of up to 50 celebs.\n# UK Metropolitan Police Operation Weeting; (26 January 2011) interception of voicemail.

In its application for production orders, DPS cited the Official Secrets Act, an unusual use of this Act that has severe penalties, as well as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) in its order to require reporter Nick Davies and others to disclose sources. It was the Milly Dowler disclosure that inflamed public opinion against phone hacking and led to the resignations of top Met officials, commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and assistant commissioner John Yates. Four days later, in the face of strong negative reaction from politicians, lawyers, and the press, the Met decided not to pursue the application for production orders.\n# UK Metropolitan Police (by February 2012) Operation Kalmyk; illegal access to computers; acknowledged by Sue Akers, a Deputy Assistant Commissioner with the Metropolitan Police.

He later worked for Metropolitan police assistant commissioner John Yates up until shortly before Yates made his cursory 2009 review and determined there was no basis for further investigation into phone hacking.

The Commission \"withdrew\" this conclusion in 2011.]]\n# UK Press Complaints Commission (PCC) Inquiry; (2007) Report concludes phone message tapping should stop but that \"there is a legitimate place for the use of subterfuge when there are grounds in the public interest to use it and it is not possible to obtain information through other means.\" News of the World editor Colin Myler''' told the PCC that Goodman's hacking was \"aberrational\", \"a rogue exception,\" done by a single journalist. Sir Christopher Meyer, then chairman of the PCC, \"promised to investigate 'the entire newspaper and magazine industry of the UK to establish what is their practice' but opted not to question Andy Coulson on the grounds that he had resigned, and not to question any other journalist or editorial executive on the paper, apart from Myler, who necessarily had no direct knowledge of what had been going on before his arrival. The PCC's subsequent report failed to uncover any evidence of any phone hacking by any media organisation beyond that revealed at Goodman's trial.\" The Daily Mail alone made 985 requests, more than any other paper. After the conviction of Whittamore, the Information Commission, which is responsible for policing confidential databases, urged the Press Complaints Commission to issue \"a clear public statement warning journalists and editors of the very real risks of committing criminal offences.\" Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that the PCC, which is funded by newspapers, resisted doing this and finally produced guidance which the Information Commission has publicly described as \"disappointing\".\n# UK Press Complaints Commission Inquiry; (2009) \"Concerned with whether it was misled by the News of the World during its 2007 investigation, and whether there is any evidence that phone message hacking has taken place since 2007.\" Its report concluded the PCC was not misled and that there is no evidence of ongoing phone hacking. This report and its conclusions were withdrawn on 6 July 2011.\n# UK Solicitors Regulation Authority Inquiry; (22 July 2011)\nBy news media companies\n, Chief Executive Officer for News Corp, Europe and Asia maintained through 2009 that phone hacking within News International was limited to a single \"rogue reporter\" and his private investigator. This claim was challenged by Murdoch's senior executives.]]\ndid not uncover widespread phone hacking. After the scandal broke in 2011, Rupert Murdoch's, Board of Directors for News Corporation undertook another investigation.]]\n# News International/Burton Copeland Investigation; (8 August 2005) On the day the Met seized documents from Goodman and Mulcaire and arrested both of them for conspiracy to intercept communications without lawful authority, News of the World editors said they were stunned and vowed to conduct an internal investigation. On 6 March 2007, Les Hinton advised the Commons Culture, Media, and Sport Committee that \"a full, rigorous internal inquiry\" is ongoing.\" Asked whether Goodman was the only person who knew about the phone hacking, Hinton replied that he believed Goodman was. In 2009, Colin Myler testified at the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee hearing that the firm of Burton Copeland was engaged \"to absolutely oversee the investigation to cooperate with police...a very thorough investigation took place where there was a thorough review of everything from how cash payments were processed.\" Tom Crone testified that \"Burton Copeland were in the office virtually every day...their remit was that they were brought in to go over everything and find out what had gone wrong, to liaise with the police...They were given absolutely free-range to ask whatever they wanted to ask.\" Andy Coulson testified that \"I brought in Burton Copeland... to do an investigation. We opened up the files as much as we could. There was nothing they asked for that they were not given.\" As of August 2011, News International had not waived privilege with respect to Burton Copeland and their investigation. Linklaters replaced Burton Copeland in representing News International in July 2011. Linklaters sent a letter to the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee in August 2011 stating \"Burton Copeland did not conduct an investigation into phone hacking at the News of the World and their role was 'only about helping the police'... [but] Scotland Yard received 'very little material' from News International and Burton Copeland.\"\n# News International Email Review by Jonathan Chapman and Daniel Cloke; Reviewed a limited number of emails which were made available to them\" through an electronic folder of emails assembled by News International's IT department.\" and which were subsequently made available to Harbottle & Lewis for review. Chapman states they were not \"tasked with looking for evidence of any other potentially illegal activities\" but had they come across evidence \"of either voicemail interception or any other criminal activity,\" they would have reported it to their employer.\n# News International Email Review by Harbottle & Lewis; (March 2007) Limited by News International to Clive Goodman's claim of unfair dismissal, limited to emails made available to Harbottle & Lewis by News International, and limited to determining whether others at News International were aware of Clive Goodman's illegal activity or were engaged in similar activity.
