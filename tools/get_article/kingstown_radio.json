It was a registered charity. Broadcasting music, news, sport and health information to staff and patients, its Hull City live commentaries were particularly popular beyond its usual audiences, alongside BBC Radio Humberside it was the only station broadcasting these games live.\nFormer volunteer presenters include Jon Culshaw, a popular comedian, and James Hoggarth, who later joined BBC Radio Humberside and more recently became their music editor.\nThe station has been at more than one site during its history, but for many years, Kingstown Radio was based at Hull Royal Infirmary, sharing a building with flats for nurses and doctors upstairs from the studio. However in 2021, the studio building was pulled down with short notice of only a few weeks; the station ceased broadcasting and attempts to find new premises proved fruitless.\nBackpage Sport\n\"Backpage Sport\" was the name of a sports magazine programme which aired in the 1990s on Tyne Tees Television and is also the name of Manx Radio's sports programme.\nAchievements\nIn 2007, Kingstown Radio won the Silver Award for Sports Output, and four commendations for presentation and production at the Hospital Broadcasting Awards, held in Northampton, particularly for its coverage of Hull City home matches presented by Louise Pitts and Stuart Miles.\nSee also\n* Hospital Broadcasting Association\nReferences\n*[https://archive.today/20130705173406/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Kingstown-Radio-celebrates-50-years-broadcasts/story-15294310-detail/story.html%23axzz2YAyiyNsH Kingstown Radio Celebrated 50 Years of Broadcasting]\n*[https://archive.today/20130705153802/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Radio-s-air-appeal/story-19481974-detail/story.html%23axzz2YAyiyNsH Kingstown Radio Off-Air Appeal]\nExternal links\n* [http://psquared.net P Squared Radio Automation]\n* [http://www.jingle.org Dave Langer Jingle Site]\n* \"Kingstown's Off-Air Appeal\", Hull Daily Mail, 5 July 2013 (Hospital Service needs support to get back up and running) [https://archive.today/20130705153802/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Radio-s-air-appeal/story-19481974-detail/story.html%23axzz2YAyiyNsH]"
