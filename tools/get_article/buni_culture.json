The culture was named after its first discovered archaeological site, Buni village in Babelan, Bekasi, east of Jakarta.\nThe Buni culture is known for its peculiar pottery with incised, geometrical decorations, and the fact that it yielded the first Indian rouletted wares recorded from Southeast Asia. Clay potteries were later developed with evidence found in Anyer to Cirebon. Artifacts such as food and drink containers, dated from 400&nbsp;BC to AD 100 have been found, mostly as burial gifts.\nCharacteristics\nSome experts describe the Buni culture as proto-Batawi. Batawi relates to the Malayic-speaking Betawi people living in and around Jakarta. It is also suggested that the culture itself began as a prehistoric community but developed into another culture as it assimilated Hinduism during the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. These two cultures, which are separated by 100 to 200 years, are depicted in the temple complex built at Batujaya and the Hindu temple complex system constructed later. These two cultures may not be viewed individually due to communal continuity.\nThe Buni clay pottery culture bears similarities with the Sa Huỳnh styles in Vietnam and the regions around the South China Sea as well as the style of the earthenware excavated at  in north-central Java. Pottery artefacts were discovered such as clay dishes, pots, water jars, and other daily utensils.\nMegalithic remains can also be found, such as beads as burial gifts, and also menhirs and stone tables. The people that supported the Buni culture had established trade with foreign people. This is shown by the existence of the Indian rouletted ware discovered at Kobak Kendal and Cibutak, which date back to the first and second century A.D. The kingdom of Tarumanagara is probably the successor of the Buni culture after the adoption of Hinduism. The remnants of Buni pottery have also been discovered at the Batujaya Archaeological Site and the Kendaljaya site in Karawang.\nArtifacts\nFile:Buni Culture Pottery 1.jpg|lncised pot containers\nFile:Buni Culture Pottery 2.jpg|Containers with lids\nFile:Buni Culture Pottery 3.jpg|Jars\nReferences\n*Manguin, Pierre-Yves and Agustijanto Indrajaya, \"The Archaeology of Batujaya (West Java, Indonesia):an Interim Report\", in ''Uncovering Southeast Asia's past: selected papers from the 10th International Conference of the European Association of Southeast Asian Archaeologists (Elisabeth A.
