The Vikings have fielded a team since 1909. The program plays home games at Lokken Stadium in Valley City, North Dakota.\nThe program is led by head coach Dennis McCulloch, who began his tenure in 1997. Under McCulloch, the Vikings have captured multiple conference championships and made four NAIA playoff appearances.\nHistory\nValley City State began varsity football in 1909. Over more than a century, the Vikings have won 29 conference championships and made nine NAIA playoff appearances. Their postseason win came in 1980 over McMurry College (TX).\nIn 2025, the Vikings transitioned from the North Star Athletic Association to the Frontier Conference.\nFacilities\nThe Vikings play at Lokken Stadium (capacity ~2,500) on the VCSU campus. The school's athletics master plan has included the Tharaldson Family Athletic Center, an indoor facility under development adjacent to Dacotah Bank Field.\nRivalries\nValley City State maintains long-standing rivalries with University of Jamestown, Dickinson State University, and Mayville State University.\nPaint Bucket rivalry (Jamestown)\nThe Paint Bucket Rivalry is one of the oldest and most recognized small-college football rivalries in the Upper Midwest, contested annually between Valley City State University and the University of Jamestown. The winner receives the ceremonial Paint Bucket, a tradition created to help curb vandalism between the two campuses by giving fans a sanctioned way to “claim” the rivalry through the trophy rather than graffiti. The series dates back to the early 20th century and has been played nearly every season since its inception.\nJamestown controlled large stretches of the rivalry in its early years, while Valley City State gained momentum in the late 20th and early 21st centuries under longtime head coach Dennis McCulloch. The matchup has frequently carried conference-title or postseason implications during eras when both teams competed in the North Dakota College Athletic Conference and later the North Star Athletic Association.\nThe series has historically been competitive, with extended winning streaks on both sides and several games decided in the final moments. As of the most recent meeting, Valley City State leads the all-time series.\nDickinson State\nValley City State and Dickinson State share one of the oldest and most frequently played small-college football rivalries in the Upper Midwest. The teams have met regularly since at least 1930 across multiple conferences, including the North Dakota College Athletic Conference, Dakota Athletic Conference, North Star Athletic Association, and now the Frontier Conference.\nThe rivalry has historically favored Dickinson State, who leads the series 53–35–5. Many matchups between the Vikings and Blue Hawks have carried conference title implications, with Dickinson State emerging as one of the NAIA’s most nationally consistent programs over the past several decades. Despite the overall series deficit, VCSU has recorded notable wins throughout the rivalry’s history, and the annual meeting remains one of the Vikings’ most anticipated games each season.\nMayville State\nValley City State and Mayville State maintain one of North Dakota’s most traditional small-college football rivalries, dating back to at least 1930. The programs have competed as conference opponents for nearly their entire histories, meeting through the NDCAC, DAC, NSAA, and now the Frontier Conference.\nThe series has been strongly controlled by Valley City State, who leads 72–25–2 since 1930. While the Vikings have held the advantage overall, the rivalry has produced long stretches of competitive play and has often influenced conference standings, regional recruiting, and postseason qualification. The annual matchup with the Comets remains an important fixture on VCSU’s schedule.\nHead coaches\nOver more than a century of competition, Valley City State has been led by numerous head coaches. Records below reflect the program’s official totals (latest totals for McCulloch per 2025 infor mation).\nKey\nAll head coaches (1909–present)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ List of head football coaches showing season(s) coached, overall records, and NAIA playoff years\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Season(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | GC\n! scope=\"col\" | OW\n! scope=\"col\" | OL\n! scope=\"col\" | OT\n! scope=\"col\" | O%\n! scope=\"col\" | NAIA playoffs\n|-\n| 1\n! scope=\"row\" | Henry W.
