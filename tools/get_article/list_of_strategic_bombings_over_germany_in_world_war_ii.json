This list is not complete.\nHistory\nDefence of Germany\nGerman defensive strategy of their country, and neighbouring occupied countries, against strategic bombing was conducted by the Defence of the Reich.\nIn February 1944, the RAF and USAAF air raids of Big Week notably limited the offensive capability of the Luftwaffe, from which it would never recover. On the first day of Big Week, 127 German fighters were shot down for the loss of one P-51 Mustang fighter. 434 German fighter pilots were killed in February 1944, which was 17% of the total, and many were the more-experienced fighter pilots.\nThe German air defence had advanced radar and was often impenetrable, or only penetrable at great cost; only aircraft such as the de Havilland Mosquito could completely outwit the German defences; the Mosquito was almost impossible to shoot down, being able to outrun most German fighter aircraft too, and it carried no discernible defensive armament. Around fifteen German cities were firebombed, in which destruction of the cities was almost total; the temperatures created in the firestorm were huge. Many north-western German cities were bombed in late 1943 in the Battle of the Ruhr.\nOn 27 May 1940, a 10 Sqn Armstrong Whitworth Whitley on German raid, becomes first time that a RAF rear gunner shot down a German fighter. On 5 May 1943, the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt escorted for the first time. On 26 July 1944, the first time that a jet fighter shot down an aircraft occurred in air combat history, when a Me 262 shot down a reconnaissance Mosquito of 540 Sq.\nAerial navigation\nIn August 1942 the Germans now could jam the Gee navigation system frequencies. From January 1943 Oboe was deployed, and the Germans could not prevent Oboe navigation until January 1944, when an Oboe-equipped aircraft was shot down near Kleve, and eighty jamming transmitters were built in three days. The British changed the frequency of Oboe, but kept the old frequency broadcasting, and the Germans believed that their frequency-jamming was working as before.\nDestruction\nThere were 1,440,000 bomber sorties over Germany, and 2,680,000 fighter aircraft sorties. Approximately 410,000 German civilians were killed in the strategic bombing.  Within the 1937 borders of Germany, industrial capacity was greater at the end of the war than at the beginning. British and American raids often deliberately targeted the highly flammable medieval and early modern city centres, which had no military value. The raids intensified in the final months of the war, when Germany's defeat was effectively inevitable.\n42 22,000lb Grand Slam devices were dropped over Germany.\nStrategic bombing\nB\n* Bombing of Berlin in World War II; in the first four months of the RAF campaign, the RAF lost around 1,000 aircraft; the USAAF joined the Berlin campaign from March 1944, with Mustang fighter support; the Luftwaffe fighter pilots were deeply alarmed by the numbers of the Mustangs; on 6 March 1944, the first large US raid drops 1600 tons of bombs from 600 bombers, with around 160 of the 800 defending German fighters being shot down; the largest USAAF raid of the entire war, with 1,500 bombers of the Eighth Air Force, was on the morning of 3 February 1945, with 2,300 tons dropped, causing a firestorm, killing 2,500.\n* Bombing of Braunschweig (15 October 1944); the main raid was on 14/15 October 1944 by No. 5 Group RAF and part of the 24-hour Operation Hurricane, where around 10,000 tons were dropped.\n* Bombing of Bremen in World War II, on 13 April 1943, 115 B-17s destroy half of the Focke-Wulf factory; on 8 October 1943, the raid caused a firestorm.\nC\n* Bombing of Cologne in World War II, the morning raid of 31 May 1942 saw the operational debut of the Mosquito, when four Mosquitos of 105 Sqn take off from Norfolk.\nD\n* Bombing of Darmstadt in World War II; the raid on 11/12 September 1944 resulted in a firestorm; with 226 Lancasters of 5 Group and 14 Pathfinder Mosquitos.\n* Bombing of Dortmund, on 12 March 1945, the largest raid of the whole war on one target, the RAF drops 4,851 tonnes, with 1108 aircraft, 748 Lancasters, 292 Halifaxes, and 68 Mosquitos, destroying 98% of the city centre; it began at 4.30pm, and lasted 29 minutes.\n* Bombing of Dresden in World War II\n* Bombing of Duisburg in World War II\n* Bombing of Düsseldorf in World War II, on 12 June 1943 the raid resulted in a firestorm, with 783 aircraft - 326 Lancasters, 202 Halifaxes, 143 Wellingtons, 99 Stirlings, and 13 Mosquitos.\nE\n* Bombing of Emden, on 31 March 1941, the first 4,000lb cookie was dropped, and was the 37th raid on the town, dropped by two Wellingtons of 149 Sqn at RAF Mildenhall, piloted by Sqn Ldr K Wass and Pilot Off Franks; the propaganda film Target for Tonight was being filmed at this time at Mildenhall; the 4,000lb device was described as five-times more powerful than previous RAF ordnance;  the largest raid on 6 September 1944, destroys 80% of the city.\n* Bombing of Essen in World War II, on 8 March 1942 was the first carpet bombing raid by RAF, with the first electronic navigation of the RAF, with 211 aircraft, and the Gee radio navigation system; on 5 March 1943, there was a huge raid, with 160 acres destroyed in a firestorm; this was the first raid of the 'Battle of the Ruhr', with 442 aircraft; and from this moment on, due to advanced ground radar, the targets were mostly found; on 10 April 1943, the first 8,000lb ordnance was dropped, by a Halifax of 76 Sqn, piloted by Pilot Off M.
