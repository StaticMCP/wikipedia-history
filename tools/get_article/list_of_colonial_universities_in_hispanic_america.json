The foundation of a university required, following the medieval tradition, either a papal bull (or papal brief) or a royal privilege granting the right to confer academic degrees to the students. Usually a bestowment from both clerical and secular authorities was sought and achieved. Universities were all subjected to the king's supervision, only San Nicolas in Bogotá held the status of a private university.\nThe new foundations modeled their charters mainly on that of the University of Salamanca, the oldest and most venerable Spanish university. The curriculum of smaller universities was confined to the artes, a kind of basic studies, and Catholic theology (plus church law). A leading role was assumed by the gradually evolving full universities which additionally offered courses in medicine and jurisprudence, thus comprising all four classic faculties. The influential first universities were founded in the viceroyalties centers Santo Domingo, Lima and Mexico City. When it became apparent that the vast distances of the Spanish realm required a greater geographical spread of universities, they contributed to the creation of further foundations.\nA key role in the development of the university system was played by the Catholic orders, especially by the Jesuits, but also the Dominicans and Augustinians. The founding and operation of most universities resulted from the – usually local – initiative of one of these orders, which sometimes quarreled openly over the control of the campus and the curriculum. The (temporary) dissolution of the Jesuit order in the late 18th&nbsp;century proved to be a major setback for the university landscape in Latin America, several of the suppressed Jesuit universities were reopened only decades later.\nThe successful export of the university, a genuine European creation, to another continent demonstrated its \"extraordinary effectiveness and adaptability\" as the highest educational institution and marked the beginning of its universal adoption in the modern age (see also List of the oldest universities). Yet there is no denying that at the end of the colonial era the intellectual and academic life in the younger colonial colleges of the British territories appeared more vital. Nevertheless, the Spanish universities in the Americas fulfilled their primary task, the education of the clerical and secular viceroyalty elite, and could thus assume an important function in aiding the development of the young republics after the separation from the motherland.\nIn Portuguese Brazil, by contrast, no university existed far beyond the colonial period (the first was established as late as 1912 in Curitiba as University of Paraná). The lower local demand for theological and legal specialists was largely met by Jesuit colegios, while students aspiring to higher education had to take up studies overseas at the University of Coimbra. Instead of universities for general studies, the Portuguese favored the creation of professional academies to respond to the local needs of technicians and skilled professionals, including creating the first school of higher studies in engineering of the Americas.\nList\nThe list is sorted by the date of recognition. At places where more than one university was established, the name of the institution is given in brackets.\n16th century\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"10%\" | Founded\n! width=\"25%\" | University\n! width=\"25%\" | Modern country\n|-\n| 15381558\n| Universidad Santo Tomás de Aquino\n| Dominican Republic\n|-\n| 1551\n| National University of San Marcos\n| Peru\n|-\n| 1551\n| Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico\n| Mexico\n|-\n| 1552\n| La Plata or Charcas\n| Bolivia\n|-\n| 1558\n| Santo Domingo (Santiago de La Paz y de Gorjón)\n| Dominican Republic\n|-\n| 1580\n| Saint Thomas Aquinas University\n| Colombia\n|-\n| 1586\n| Quito (San Fulgencio)\n| Ecuador\n|-\n|}\n17th century\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"10%\" | Founded\n! width=\"25%\" | University\n! width=\"25%\" | Modern country\n|-\n| 1613\n| National University of Córdoba\n| Argentina\n|-\n| 1621\n| Santiago (San Miguel)\n| Chile\n|-\n| 1621\n| Cuzco (San Ignacio de Loyola)\n| Peru\n|-\n| 1621\n| University of Saint Francis Xavier\n| Bolivia\n|-\n| 1623\n| Pontifical Xavierian University\n| Colombia\n|-\n| 1624\n|\n| Mexico\n|-\n| 1676\n| University of San Carlos of Guatemala\n| Guatemala\n|-\n| 1677\n| San Cristóbal of Huamanga University\n| Peru\n|-\n| 1681\n| Central University of Ecuador\n| Ecuador\n|-\n| 1685\n| Santiago (Rosario)\n| Chile\n|-\n| 1690\n| National University of San Antonio Abad in Cuzco\n| Peru\n|-\n| 1694\n| Bogotá (San Nicolás)\n| Colombia\n|-\n| 1696\n| Central University of Ecuador\n| Ecuador\n|-\n|}\n18th century\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"10%\" | Founded\n! width=\"25%\" | University\n! width=\"25%\" | Modern country\n|-\n| 1721\n| University of Havana\n| Cuba\n|-\n| 1721\n| Central University of Venezuela\n| Venezuela\n|-\n| 1733\n| Asunción\n| Paraguay\n|-\n| 1738\n| Royal University of San Felipe\n| Chile\n|-\n| 1744\n| University of Cauca\n| Colombia\n|-\n| 1749\n|\n| Panama\n|-\n| 1749\n|\n| Chile\n|-\n| 1791\n| University of Guadalajara\n| Mexico\n|-\n|}\n19th century\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"10%\" | Founded\n! width=\"25%\" | University\n! width=\"25%\" | Modern country\n|-\n| 1806\n| University of the Andes, Venezuela\n| Venezuela\n|-\n| 1812\n| National Autonomous University of Nicaragua\n| Nicaragua\n|-\n| 1828\n| National University of Saint Augustine\n| Peru\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* List of universities in South America\n* History of European research universities\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n* Jílek, Jubor (ed.): \"Historical Compendium of European Universities/Répertoire Historique des Universités Européennes\", Standing Conference of Rectors, Presidents and Vice-Chancellors of the European Universities (CRE), Geneva 1984\n* Roberts, John; Rodriguez Cruz, Agueda M.; Herbst, Jürgen: \"Die Übernahme europäischer Universitätsmodelle\", in: Rüegg, Walter (ed.): Geschichte der Universität in Europa.
