In addition to the disease itself, populations have often dealt with lockdowns, shortages and pandemic fatigue, political and cultural turmoil. This made the pandemic a time of exceptional stress, driving some people to seek peaceful escapism in media and others to consume media concerning fictional pandemics (i.e., zombie apocalypses) in an effort to make sense of the event. Themes include contagion, isolation and loss of control. The pandemic also impacted people's use of social media as well as the sports industry.\nSome commentators have referred to the pandemic as a \"distinct cultural era\".\nIn media\nThe pandemic has been included in the narratives of ongoing pre-pandemic television series and become a central narrative in new ones, with mixed results.\nFilm and television\n| align = right\n}}\nHorror\nThe horror film Host (2020), a computer screen film, was produced and released during the pandemic and centers on characters attacked by a supernatural presence after conducting a seance via Zoom.\nAnother film, Safer at Home, filmed in 2021 and set in 2022, envisions Los Angeles as a police state as a result of the pandemic.

Out of these latter genres, however, country appears to be the most resilient, with popularity soaring by 15.8%.\nOther examples of music influenced by COVID-19 include:\n* Markus J. Buehler at Massachusetts Institute of Technology produced a musical score from a sonification algorithm and the structure of the virus' S (spike) protein.

Either through in the choreography itself (e.g. Rhiannon Faith's Drowntown), in the location (e.g. empty public places Taylor Stanley outside the Lincoln Center, choreography by Kyle Abraham), or the filming technique (e.g. in Flying Home by street dance group BirdGang via \"...the now all-too-familiar segmented Zoom-style screen\").\nThe show believed to be the first full capacity premiere of a play anywhere in the world since the pandemic began was a theatrical adaptation of the popular children's television show Bluey entitled ''Bluey's Big Play, The Stage Show.

With other marketing techniques, digital marketers began depicting safe habits around the virus, altering their advertisements to include practices of social distancing, staying at home, cleanliness, and the usage of masks. For example, NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, continued its Santa Claus tracking on 24 December 2020, but added a mask to the cartoon Santa on his sleigh.\nE-commerce websites\nA chart from Bazaarvoice.com shows a Year-over-Year (\"YoY\") increase in monthly page views and order counts from 1 January – 30 June 2020, averaged from 6,200 different e-commerce (ECOM) websites.\nAs seen from the chart, before major statewide quarantines, ECOM was already starting to see increases in page views and orders from January - March, increasing 14% in page views and 19% in orders. When former President Donald Trump issued COVID-19 a National Emergency in mid-March, both page views and order counts had a YoY increase to 96% and 88%, respectively. The trending psychology behind this surge in ECOM usage is since most people at this time were in fear of in-person and Brick-in-Mortar alternatives that were still open at the time.\nThe top trending ECOM sites amid the pandemic from highest YoY growth to least were Toys and Games, Business and Industrial, Sporting Goods, Hardware, Home & Garden, Entertainment, Animal & Pet Supplies, Electronics, and Food/Beverages/Tobacco. Down trending ECOM websites include those that sell products used in pre-pandemic times, such as Luggage websites. Luggage and Bag websites were one of the only websites to see over 10% decreases in page views and order counts.\nFinancial technology\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented tail-winds to website usage. Financial analysts predicted that for many payment providers, it could also drive new purchasing habits that could leave the companies in a stronger position once the crisis is over. Credit card network websites such as Visa.com, PayPal.com, and Mastercard.com saw page view and payment volume growth pressured by temporary business closures, elevated unemployment, and a cutback on international travel. Due to social distancing and shelter-in-place, these companies saw people increasingly move their spending online, as seen with the increase in E-commerce popularity. However, for websites such as Squareup.com, with many brick and mortar operations, COVID-19 had negative impacts.\nLive chats and video streaming websites\nSchools and businesses worldwide have altered their business structure to an online means of learning and work. As a result of the new norm to online chat and video streaming methods, websites such as Zoom saw massive growth in page visits and user volume. Through these websites users could continue work, communication, and education without risks from COVID-19.\nIn social media\nAmateur content creators created and shared among themselves many memes (notably in the form of art-recreations, songs, and videos) during the isolation period.\nTrends\nDuring the course of the pandemic, the social media app TikTok grew the most, lending to a number of new trends in digital pop culture including video games like Animal Crossing, Among Us and Genshin Impact, banana bread baking, Tiger King memes, and quarantines. The increasing popularity of TikTok led to the development of similar-looking features on other social media platforms, such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.\nSocial media usage\nPeople overall spent more time on social media in 2020 than the year before. However, the attitudes and habits did show a change. Users felt less inclined to share overly positive or unimportant information in the midst of the rising death tolls. At the same time, there was increased posting about social activism surrounding the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. Video-focused sites like TikTok gained attraction, which was speculated as being perhaps due to the social factor of seeing other users.\nAnxiety\nIn the early stage of the pandemic, a survey conducted by Gao J. Zheng showed a high prevalence of mental health problems, which is positively associated with frequent exposure to social media. Many posts on TikTok focused on young people's anxiety, social distancing, and isolation.\nUnlike TikTok, whose users are mostly young people, the overall attitude towards the pandemic was different on Twitter. For example, a study on Twitter users during the pandemic shows overall higher positive sentiments. Among Twitter users, 48,157(51.97%) users expressed positive feelings, while 31,553 (34.05%) were neutral, and the rest of the tweets - amounting to 12,936 (13.96%) - showed negative emotions. One major reason behind the prominence of positive sentiment is that most people still appreciated the government and health workers despite their personal anxieties.\nIn sports\nCOVID-19 forced difficult and financially depleting decisions on the sports industry. Nearly every major sporting event in the sports-event industry was canceled, moved, or postponed in the midst of the outbreak. Teams were forced to withdraw from specific tournaments or entire seasons. For example, in March 2020, during the Sweet 16, the Rams were forced to withdraw their position in the tournament after multiple players caught the COVID-19 virus. A 2019-2020 YoY revenue growth chart listed on Forbes Magazine showed that YoY revenue growth had dramatically downsized for major sports leagues due to these cancellations.\nA 2020 chart from Forbes Magazine shows a revenue growth comparison of major sports leagues from 2019 to 2020.\nFor the 2020 Summer Olympics, foreign spectators were banned from attending the games in Japan without a 100 percent refund. Moreover, the vaccinations rates were increased, and Major League Baseball gave the news to provide vaccine facilities in their stadiums. Vaccinations of the athletes were an ethical issue, if it was legal and ethical. The NBA announced vaccinations were not mandatory, but vaccinated players would be more flexible. According to ESPN, the NBA were allowing vaccinated athletes to not wear masks in the training facilities, with extra freedom traveling. Before the vaccinations, the NBA was continuing in a bubble, where players were not allowed to leave. Players inside the bubble were wearing sensors for social distancing. Reporters who wanted to get inside the bubble were required for temperature and oxygen checks and COVID tests. The benches of the NBA athletes were changed, and they became socially distanced. Without their fans, some of the old NBA coaches were still wearing masks during the games. Popovich, the oldest coach in the NBA, who is 74, said that \"I don't want to die\", when he was asked about wearing masks.\nProfessional wrestling largely ceased, with WWE holding all events in their empty Performance Center in Orlando, Florida, while AEW held all its shows in an empty arena, also in Florida. Other companies such as ROH, Impact Wrestling and New Japan Pro Wrestling postponed and or outright cancelled shows. WWE would eventually implement the ThunderDome,  an arena filled with screens showing fans watching the shows at home.\nReferences"
