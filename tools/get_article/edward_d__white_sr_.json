Ten years later, he was appointed by Governor Henry S. Johnson, also of Donaldsonville, as an Associate Judge of the New Orleans Municipal Court in 1825.\nIn 1834, he married Catherine Sidney Lee Ringgold, daughter of Tench Ringgold, long the U.S. Marshal in the District of Columbia. Their children included Edward Douglass White Jr.\nWhite was a slaveholder.\nPolitical career\nElected to the 21st United States Congress in 1828, White served three terms from 1829 until his resignation in 1834 after being elected as governor. He served a single term as governor from 1835 to 1839. Afterward, he was elected to the U.S. Congress again, serving two more terms from 1839 until 1843.\nLioness incident\nWhite was among the survivors of the steamboat Lioness explosion that occurred on the Red River south of Natchitoches on May 19, 1833.\nDeath and burial\nHe died in New Orleans and was buried at St. Joseph's Catholic Cemetery in Thibodaux, Louisiana.\nHis home in Thibodaux is now operated by the Louisiana State Museum as the Edward Douglass White Historic Site.\nFamily\nWhite's son Edward Douglass White Jr. was elected by the state legislature as a United States senator from Louisiana. He later was appointed as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court by President Grover Cleveland in 1894 and as the 9th Chief Justice by President William Howard Taft in 1910.\nReferences\nSources\n*[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/white3.html  Political Graveyard]\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080110153638/http://www.sos.louisiana.gov/tabid/368/Default.aspx State of Louisiana - Biography]\n*[http://www.la-cemeteries.com/Governors/White,%20Edward%20Douglas/White,%20Edward%20Douglas.shtml Cemetery Memorial] by La-Cemeteries\n*"
