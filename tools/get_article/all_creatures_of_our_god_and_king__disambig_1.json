It was first published in a hymn book in 1919.\nHistory\nThe words of the hymn were initially written by St. Francis of Assisi in 1225 in the Canticle of the Sun poem, which was based on Psalm 148. The words were translated into English by William Draper, who at the time was rector of a Church of England parish church at Adel near Leeds. Draper paraphrased the words of the Canticle and set them to music. It is not known when Draper first wrote the hymn but it was between 1899 and 1919. Draper wrote it for his church's children's Whitsun festival celebrations and it was later published in 1919 in the Public School Hymn Book. As of 2025, it is known to be used in 270 different hymn books. The words written by St Francis are some of the oldest used in hymns after \"Father We Praise Thee\", written in 580 AD.\nLike \"Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones\", Draper's text is usually set to the tune of \"'\", a German Easter hymn published by Friedrich Spee in 1623 in his book '. This tune became widespread in English hymn books starting with a 1906 arrangement by Ralph Vaughan Williams. John Rutter also wrote a piece of music for the hymn. Despite the hymn being initially written by Draper for Whitsun (the Anglican and English designation for Pentecost), it is mostly used in the earlier weeks of the Easter season.\nMelody\nThe most common melody is the 1623 German hymn tune . The following setting is from the 1906 English Hymnal, with the lyrics quoted from the 1986 New English Hymnal:\n1 es,2 | es4 f g es g as | 1 \\bar\"||\"\nes4^\\markup { \\italic \"Harmony.\" } d | c2 bes es4 d | c2 bes\\fermata \\breathe \\bar\"||\" es2^\\markup { \\italic \"Unison.\" } | es4 bes bes as g as | 1 es2 | es4 bes bes as g as | bes1 \\bar\"||\"\nas4^\\markup { \\italic \"Harmony.\" } g | f2 es as4 g | f2 es es'4 d | c2 bes es4^\\markup { \\italic \"Unison.\" } d | c2 bes as4 g | f1. | es1 \\bar\"|.\" } \\\\\n{ bes2 | es1 es2 | es2 d es | bes4 d es2 es2 | es2 d\nbes'4 bes | bes( as) g2 es4 d | g( f) d2 bes'4 as | g2~ g4 f es2 | es d es4 f |    es2. | es4 d g f\nes4 es | es( d) es2 es4 es | es( d) c2 g'4 f | g( f) d2 ~ | 4 4~   c, es | es2 d1 | bes } \\\\\n{ s2 | s1. | s1. | s1. | s1\ns2 | s1. | s1. | s1. | s1 \\stemDown \\once \\override NoteColumn.force-hshift = 0 bes'2 } >> %necessary for that one note\n}\n\\new Lyrics \\lyricmode { \\set stanza = #\"1.\"All2 crea4 -- tures of our God and King,1\nLift2 up4 your voice and with us sing1\nAl4 -- le -- lu2 -- ya, al4 -- le -- lu2 -- ya!\nThou2 burn4 -- ing sun with gold -- en beam,1\nThou2 sil4 -- ver moon with soft -- er gleam:1\nO2 praise him, O praise him\nAl4 -- le -- lu2 -- ya, Al4 -- le -- lu2 -- ya, Al4 -- le -- lu1. -- ya!1\n}\n\\new Lyrics \\lyricmode { \\set stanza = #\"2.\" Thou2 rush4 -- ing wind that art so strong,1\nYe2 clouds4 that sail in heaven a -- long,1\nO2 praise him!

Consequently, he mumbles through most of the song, save for the recurrent \"Alleluia\", which he sings as loudly as possible.\nIn the United States, it was covered by the David Crowder Band on the album Can You Hear Us? in 2002 and in the album Illuminate in 2003.\nReferences\nExternal links"
