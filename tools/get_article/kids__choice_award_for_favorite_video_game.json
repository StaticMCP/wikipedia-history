It existed in 2013 and 2014 before it was merged into \"Favorite Video Game\" (renamed Most Addicting Game for one year) in 2015.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! style=\"background:#FF7F00;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#00FF00;\" | App\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" | 2013\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Temple Run\n|-\n|Angry Birds\n|-\n|Fruit Ninja\n|-\n|Minecraft\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" | 2014\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Despicable Me: Minion Rush\n|-\n|Angry Birds Star Wars II\n|-\n|Candy Crush Saga\n|-\n|Temple Run\n|}\nMultiple nominations and awards\nDuring the early years of the category, nominated games did not have to be from the year before the ceremony to be nominated, and often games that had already been nominated or won the award in years past could be re-nominated. Super Mario 64, for example, was nominated in the category three years in a row (1997, 1998 and 1999), winning in the latter two years. From 2000 onwards, games had to be released the year before the ceremony to be eligible for nomination, but this has been loosened in recent years for Minecraft and Roblox.\nAs of the 2024 ceremony, Minecraft'' holds the record for most wins in the category for a single game, at 4. The game's wins occurred in 2015 (when the category was known as \"Most Addicting Game\"), 2020, 2022 and 2023. Minecraft, Donkey Kong Country (in the award's first two years) and Super Mario 64 are the only games to have won the award in consecutive years. Minecraft has also been nominated for Favorite Video Game in 2014, 2015 and every year since 2020; the main game was also nominated for Favorite Mobile Game in 2013. Minecraft: Story Mode was nominated in place of the main game in 2016 and 2017, while the Java version of the game was nominated separately in 2018.\nThe Just Dance series of games has won the category a record total of 8 times from 2011 to 2014 and 2016 to 2019, winning every edition in which a Just Dance game was nominated during that span. The series was also nominated from 2022 to 2025, for a total of 11 nominations.\nRoblox, as a game development platform, has had its games nominated separately in lieu of the platform as a whole. Brookhaven RP was nominated in 2022 and 2023, with Adopt Me! also nominated in the latter year, marking the only time that two games from the same platform were nominated for Favorite Video Game.\nNotes\nReferences"
