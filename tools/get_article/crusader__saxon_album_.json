That's what started it off. We just liked the name \"Crusader\". We didn't have any connotations of what it meant as far as history goes, but we just liked the name \"Crusader\", so we just wrote the lyrics to fit the title, really.\"\nReception\n| rev2 = ''Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal''\n| rev2Score = 6/10\n| noprose = yes\n}}\nEduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic said that although by the time they released the album, \"the band had obviously stopped leading the New Wave of British Heavy Metal with its aggressive, blue-collar biker anthems\", the album \"as a whole offers a slight improvement over the previous year's Power & the Glory from an overall songwriting perspective\". Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considered Saxon's turn to \"a low-cal, kinder, gentler metal... a well-conceived experiment\" and denied those who called Crusader \"a failure\" and \"a bald-faced commercial maneuver\", finding the album \"refreshing if more than occasionally flawed.\"\nThe album reached No. 1 in the metal charts in Sweden, France and Germany. It peaked at #18 in the UK Albums Chart. It also charted in the U.S. Billboard chart.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Biff Byford – vocals\n*Graham Oliver – guitar\n*Paul Quinn – guitar\n*Steve Dawson – bass guitar\n*Nigel Glockler – drums\n; Production\n* Kevin Beamish – producer, engineer\n* Bruce Barris – engineer\n* Sound City Studios, Los Angeles, California – recording location\n* George Marino – mastering at Sterling Sound, New York City\n* Paul R.
