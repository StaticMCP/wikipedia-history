He joined the Geological Survey of Uganda in 1919 and became its director in 1920.  He was involved in mineral prospecting, geological mapping, and research in Uganda and neighboring countries. He discovered a number of archaeological sites and stone tools in Uganda, such as Nsongezi and was part of the team that excavated the Luzira head. He also wrote about the relationship between rift valleys, rivers, rains, and early human evolution in Africa.\nHe briefly studied archaeology at Cambridge University during his directorship of the Geological Survey of Uganda.In 1923, he was one of the founding members of The Uganda Society, a cultural, and scientific society and became its president in 1934–1935.
