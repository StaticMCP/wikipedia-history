At the south-western edge of the locality, south of the Coalfields Highway, it borders the large coal mines of the Collie area while the remainder of the locality is predominantly forested.\nBuckingham is located on the traditional land of the Wiilman people of the Noongar nation.\nThe locality is home to eight heritage-listed locations, among them the former Buckingham Mill, the Muja open cut coal mine, the Buckingham Memorial Church and the Buckingham Family Residence. The former mill and the Buckingham Family Residence date back to 1911, both belonging to the brothers Ernest and James Buckingham, who settled in the area that year.\nReferences"
