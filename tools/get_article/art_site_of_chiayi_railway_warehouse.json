In July 2000, the Council of Cultural Affairs chose five candidates and then decided to make the warehouse. The warehouse was converted from an idle railway warehouse. The planning work started in September 2000 by Chiayi City Government aiming to turn the warehouse into an art center.\nArchitecture\nThe site consists of 12 warehouses forming a block. They provide a total area of 2,500 m2 of interior space for creative work, exhibition, performance and education. The outdoor area is divided into outdoor performance area, creative art area and general area.\nEvents\n* Black Golden Section Art Festival\nTransportation\nThe building is accessible within walking distance north of Chiayi Station of Taiwan Railways.\nSee also\n* List of tourist attractions in Taiwan\n* Chiayi Station\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
