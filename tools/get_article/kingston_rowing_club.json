On a long wide stretch, its rowers and scullers have the final and the second longest section of the weir-controlled river. Kingston have produced a significant list of international level oarsmen and oarswomen throughout its history and has won events at the British Rowing Championships and Henley Royal Regatta through the years.\nKingston Rowing Club is the supporting club for Kingston Regatta which is held above Kingston Bridge. Kingston organises Kingston Head of the River Race which is a warm-up for the national Head of the River Race on the Championship Course on the following weekend.\nHistory\nThe club started at Messenger's Boathouse, Kingston and was housed there for three years before moving upstream. From 1861 to 1935 the club was based above the bridges on Raven's Ait in Surbiton to the south. In 1935 the club moved downstream to premises known as the Albany Boathouse then moved to its purpose-built facilities in Canbury Gardens in 1968.\nNotable members\n* Edward Corrie\n* Andy Holmes\n* Gilbert Kennedy\n* Courtenay Knollys\n* Dick Offer\n* Jack Offer\n* Rebecca Romero\n* Pongo Scarf VC\n* R C Sherriff\n* Denis Spotswood\n* A A Stuart\n* Douglas Stuart\n* Julian Clary\n* Kieran West\n* Tim Crooks\n* Dinghy Young DFC*\nFacilities\nThe club is the racing shell rowing club in Kingston upon Thames, but also provides training boats for less competitive rowing.  It is on the Kingston Reach which runs between Molesey Lock by Hampton Court down to Teddington Lock ; The reach is a long  V-shaped stretch of the Thames and is the final and second longest section of the River Thames &mdash; the longest reach being Wallingford reach at  in Oxfordshire.\nIt shares the long, wide stretch with three sailing clubs upstream and downstream, the Royal Canoe Club (and The Skiff Club), Walbrook Rowing Club (the rowing club of Teddington), and school clubs of Tiffin, Kingston Grammar, and Surbiton High schools.\nKingston Students Rowing Club\nKingston Students Rowing Club (KSRC) was founded in 1972 as the Kingston Polytechnic Boat Club (KPBC). After 1992, Kingston Polytechnic was granted university status and the club changed its name to Kingston University Boat Club (KUBC).\nIn 2011, Kingston University Boat Club (KUBC)  became Kingston Students Rowing Club (KSRC). KRC took over the training and coaching from Kingston University, maintain its fleet of boats and acquired its launches. University students receive automatic membership of KRC and still represent the university at the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) Regatta and in the University Indoor Rowing Series.\nAnnual events\nThe club organises Kingston Head of the River Race which is a warm-up for the national Head of the River Race on the Championship Course on the following weekend.  The organisation is associated with Kingston Regatta (formerly Kingston Amateur Regatta) since the club's founding &ndash; the regatta predates it by a year.\nThe club has a regular social calendar and Remenham Club rules entitle all established members to join to the social club which is at Henley on Thames, having one of its course-side venues, in the past having contributed to its funds in this case as a founder member.\nHonours\nHenley Royal Regatta\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=70|Year\n!width=400|Races won\n|-\n| 1863 || Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1864 || Grand Challenge Cup, Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1865 || Grand Challenge Cup, Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1866 || Silver Goblets, Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1867 || Silver Goblets, Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1868 || Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1870 || Silver Goblets\n|-\n| 1873 || Silver Goblets\n|-\n| 1877 || Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1878 || Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1883 || Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1884 || Stewards' Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1885 || Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1890 || Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1897 || Thames Challenge Cup, Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1898 || Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1903 || Wyfold Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1909 || Diamond Challenge Sculls\n|-\n| 1936 || Silver Goblets & Nickalls' Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1969 || Britannia Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1978 || Britannia Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1981 || Silver Goblets & Nickalls' Challenge Cup, Prince Philip Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 1982 || Women's Invitation Double Sculls+\n|-\n| 1983 || Prince Philip Challenge Cup, Queen Mother Challenge Cup\n|-\n| 2008 || Visitors' Challenge Cup+\n|}\n+composite\nRecent British champions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=70|Year\n!width=400|Winning crew/s\n|-\n| 2000 || Women 2-c, Women 8+c\n|-\n| 2001 || Women 4-, Women L4-\n|-\n| 2002 || Women L4-\n|-\n| 2003 || Women 2-\n|-\n| 2023 || Women's Junior 16 4x\n|-\n|2025 || Open club 4+\n|}\nc-composite\nSee also\n*Rowing on the River Thames\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.kingstonrc.co.uk/ Kingston Rowing Club official website]"
