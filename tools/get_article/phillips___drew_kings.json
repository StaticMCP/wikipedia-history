Sponsored by the stockbroker firm Phillips & Drew and the Greater London Council (GLC), these were among the strongest chess tournaments ever held in London. They were 14-player all-play-all tournaments held over 13 rounds. The venue was County Hall, the meeting place of the GLC. A fourth tournament, the GLC Chess Challenge, was held in 1986, at a different venue and with changes in sponsorship, but with the same format.\nThe 'Kings' tournaments were all category 13 or 14, and among the strongest in the world at the time. Alongside each was held a lower category (3-5) all-play-all 'Knights' tournament.\n1980 tournament\nThe inaugural tournament, in 1980, was held from the 10–25 April.

The participants were: Anatoly Karpov, Murray Chandler, Lev Polugaevsky, Jan Timman, Zoltán Ribli, Yasser Seirawan, Viktor Korchnoi, Rafael Vaganian, Ulf Andersson, Tony Miles, Jon Speelman, Jonathan Mestel, John Nunn, and Eugenio Torre.\nResult: Karpov 9/13, Chandler, Polugaevsky 8, Timman 7.5, Ribli, Seirawan 7, Korchnoi, Vaganian 6.5, Andersson, Miles, Speelman 5.5, Mestel, Nunn, Torre 5 (14 players).\n1986 tournament\nThe 1986 tournament, not involving Phillips and Drew, was the GLC Chess Challenge. It was the final event in the series, as the GLC itself had been abolished that same year. It was held at the Great Eastern Hotel, from 11 to 17 March. The participants were: Glenn Flear, Murray Chandler, Nigel Short, John Nunn, Zoltán Ribli, Lev Polugaevsky, Lajos Portisch, Boris Spassky, Jon Speelman, Rafael Vaganian, Bent Larsen, James Plaskett, Maxim Dlugy and Jonathan Mestel.\nResult: Flear 8.5/13, Chandler, Short 8, Nunn, Ribli 7.5, Polugaevsky, Portisch, Spassky 7, Vaganian, Speelman 6, Larsen 5.5, Plaskett 5, Mestel, Dlugy 4 (14 players).\nThis was one of the greatest upsets in chess history. Flear, an International Master from Leicester, was a last-minute replacement for Karpov and was not expected to score well in such a high class field.\nSources and external links\n*London 1980 Phillips and Drew Kings Chess Tournament (Hartston and Reuben, 1981)\n*[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1015847 Phillips & Drew Kings Chess Tournament 1982]\n*[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1010389 Phillips & Drew Kings Chess Tournament 1984]\n*[https://chesstales.blogspot.com/2007/05/chess-in-attic-march-1986.html GLC Chess Challenge of 1986]"
