Altshuler's first published work, the play premièred at the 2014 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\nSynopsis\nThe play focuses on Connor and Hannah, two teenagers who brainstorm with their best friends, Stan and Charlotte, ways to seduce the other on a first date.  The play is a comedic exploration of the complicated world of teenage friendships, love, and friend zones.\nThe one-act play is set on a single sofa and parallel dialogs to set up a first date and a first kiss.  Using three dialogs (one dialog occurring during the date, and one between the boyfriend and his best friend, and one dialog with the girlfriend and her best friend), the play progresses from planning to the actual date.\nCharacters\n*Connor: A teenage boy strategizing how to land the first kiss during his first date with Hannah\n*Hannah: A teenage girl contemplating her own moves in case Connor doesn't kiss her on the date\n*Stan: Connor’s best friend and provider of advice to Connor\n*Charlotte: Hannah’s best friend and provider of advice to Hannah\nProduction history\nMaking the Move premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe on August 6, 2014.
