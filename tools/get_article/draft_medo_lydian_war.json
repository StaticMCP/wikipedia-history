The war was first triggered due to Media’s territorial claim on eastern Lydia (modern-day Cappadocia), which eventually boiled over after years of growing tensions.\nDuring the the main battle on May 28, 585 BC, a solar eclipse took place. \"While the battle flared up more and more,\" notes Herodotus, \"day suddenly changed to night.\" In fear of having angered the gods, the warriors of both sides stopped the battle, and the kings hurried to make peace, and the Galis River (modern Kyzylyrmak) was recognized as the border of both kingdoms. As a result, Media was allowed to annex Cappadocia, ending the dispute over the region.\nBattle of the Eclipse\n* Peace agreement\n| status            =\n| combatant1        = Lydia\n| combatant2        = Media\n| commander1        = Alyattes\n| commander2        = Cyaxares\n| strength1         =\n| strength2         =\n| casualties1       =\n| casualties2       =\n| notes             =\n| campaignbox       =\n}}\nHerodotus writes that in the sixth year of the war, the Lydians and the Medes were engaged in an indecisive battle when suddenly day turned into night, leading to both parties halting the fighting and negotiating a peace agreement. Herodotus also mentions that the loss of daylight had been predicted by Thales of Miletus. He does not, however, mention the location of the battle. Nor, according to the quotation below, does he mention the exact date or even the approximate season of the eclipse: only the year.\nAs part of the terms of the peace agreement, Alyattes's daughter Aryenis was married to Cyaxares's son Astyages, and the Halys River (present-day Kızılırmak River) was declared to be the border of the two warring nations.\nOther ancient sources after Herodotus also mention the eclipse. Diogenes Laërtius (3rd century AD) says that Xenophanes, who lived in the same century as Thales, was impressed with the prediction, and he also gives additional testimonies from the pre-Socratics Democritus and Heraclitus. Cicero (1st century BC) mentions that Thales was the first man to successfully predict a solar eclipse during the reign of Astyages, the last king of the Median empire. Pliny the Elder (1st century AD) mentions as well that Thales had predicted a solar eclipse during the reign of Alyattes of Lydia."
