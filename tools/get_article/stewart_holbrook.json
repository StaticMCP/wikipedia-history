His writings focused on what he called the \"Far Corner\": Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. A self-proclaimed \"low-brow\" historian, his topics included Ethan Allen, the railroads, the timber industry, the Wobblies, and eccentrics of the Pacific Northwest. An early proponent of conservationism, Holbrook believed that Oregon's growing population would damage the state's environment.\nCareer\nHolbrook was a logger before he moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1923, when he was 30 years old and became a very accomplished writer.  He wrote for The Oregonian for over thirty years, was featured in The New Yorker,  and authored over three dozen books.  He also produced a number of satirical paintings under the pseudonym of \"Mr. Otis,\" in a style he called \"primitive modern.\"  These paintings are still shown occasionally at the Portland Art Museum  or can be found at the University of Washington Libraries, Special Collections.  In the early 1960s, Holbrook was the founder and leading spokesperson of an early fictitious conservation movement called the James G. Blaine Society, writing on subjects from sustained yield forestry to his concerns about unplanned population growth.\nAwards and honors\nThe Stewart H. Holbrook Literary Legacy Award is named after Holbrook and is presented every year \"to a person or organization in recognition of significant contributions that have enriched Oregon’s literary community.\"\nBibliography\n*Holy Old Mackinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack (1938)\n*Let Them Live (1938)\n*Iron Brew: A Century of American Ore and Steel (1939)\n*Ethan Allen (1940)\n*Tall Timber (1941)\n*Murder Out Yonder: An Informal Study of Certain Classic Crimes in Back-Country America (1941)\n*None More Courageous: American War Heroes of Today (1942)\n*''A Narrative of Schafer Bros.
