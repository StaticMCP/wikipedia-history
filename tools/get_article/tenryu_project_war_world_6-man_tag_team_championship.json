On June 30, 1994, an eight-team single elimination tournament was held in Sendai to crown the inaugural champions. The tournament saw Fuyuki-gun (Hiromichi Fuyuki, Gedo and Jado) defeat Animal Hamaguchi, Genichiro Tenryu and Koki Kitahara in the final.\n|RD1-team2=Hideo Takayama, Hiroshi Itakura and Ichiro Yaguchi\n|RD1-score1=N/A\n|RD1-score2=N/A\n|RD1-team3=Arashi, Ashura Hara and Super Strong Machine\n|RD1-team4=Dos Caras, Brett Como and Lionheart\n|RD1-score3=Dec\n|RD1-score4=30:00\n|RD1-team5=Masao Orihara, Shiryu and The Great Sasuke\n|RD1-team6= Ishinriki Kōji, Masanobu Kurisu and Takashi Ishikawa\n|RD1-score5=N/A\n|RD1-score6=N/A\n|RD1-team7=Animal Hamaguchi, Genichiro Tenryu and Koki Kitahara\n|RD1-team8=Kendo Nagasaki, Kishin Kawabata and Ryo Miyake\n|RD1-score7=N/A\n|RD1-score8=N/A\n|RD2-team1=Fuyuki-gun\n|RD2-team2=Dos Caras, Como and Lionheart\n|RD2-score1=N/A\n|RD2-score2=N/A\n|RD2-team3=Orihara, Shiryu and The Great Sasuke\n|RD2-team4=Hamaguchi, Tenryu and Kitahara\n|RD2-score3=N/A\n|RD2-score4=N/A\n|RD3-team1=Fuyuki-gun'''\n|RD3-team2=Hamaguchi, Tenryu and Kitahara\n|RD3-score1=N/A\n|RD3-score2=N/A\n}}\nThis title was essentially WAR's main championship, as it drew both heavyweights and junior heavyweights for competition. The promotion closed in 2000, and the title was abandoned.\nRevivals\nGenichiro Tenryu revived the title in 2010, for his new Tenryu Project promotion, as the Tenryu Project World 6-Man Tag Team Championship.
