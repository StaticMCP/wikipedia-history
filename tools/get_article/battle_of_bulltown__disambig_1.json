The goal was to cut Federal communications between the Greenbrier and Kanawha Valleys.\nThe Union garrison of roughly 400 men was commanded by Captain William Mattingly. The Union troops manned a \"fort\" of makeshift log barricades and shallow trenches which can still be seen today.\nBattle\nJackson approached Bulltown secretly. He divided his forces in an attempt to converge on the Union position from two different directions. The Confederates advanced at 4:30am on October 13. They quickly captured the Federal pickets but failed to take the main garrison by surprise.\nThe Confederates advanced against the fort and a drawn out skirmish lasted until about 4:30pm, almost twelve hours after the battle began. Twice, Jackson sent a flag of truce with a demand to surrender to Captain Simpson, asking him to surrender, but Simpson answered back that \"he would fight them until Hell froze over, and if he had to retreat he would retreat on ice.\"\nJackson eventually retreated back towards the Greenbrier Valley. Casualties were very light considering the length of the battle. On the Union side there were no fatalities. Captain Mattingly was wounded in the thigh and there were some other slight wounds in the Federal camp. The Confederates suffered eight casualties and a like number wounded.\nOne civilian, Moses Cunningham, who owned the farm on which the majority of the battle took place, was wounded when he ran out of his house shouting \"Hurrah for Jeff Davis.\"\nAftermath\nThe battle was the last significant Confederate offensive in West Virginia and the Confederate goals of disrupting the Federal communications were thwarted.\nSee also\n*Burnsville Lake, a reservoir impounding the Little Kanawha River at Bulltown\n*Union Civil War Fortification, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Hardway, Ronald V.
