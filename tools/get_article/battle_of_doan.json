The Taliban fired harassing fire at an Australian and Afghan patrol near the village of Doan, in Oruzgan Province, an I.E.D causing the loss of one Australian vehicle, with one soldier wounded. One person was arrested, while casualties on the Taliban side are unknown.\nBackground\nThe village of Doan is located in the western part of Oruzgan Province which is often called the \"Wild West of Oruzgan\" due to the high level of violent attacks. One of the most remote outposts in Oruzgan is Patrol Base Tinsley, which is where Australians train their Afghan colleagues. Part of their training involves patrols in order to halt the advance of the Taliban. The Australians and ANA conducted a three-day joint patrol to the village of Doan. During this time, they were constantly being engaged by sporadic fire from the 'green zone'.\nBattle\nOn 9 September 2011 a joint patrol of Australians from Combat Team Charlie, Mentoring Task Force 3 and ANA troops came under Taliban fire near Doan. The patrol made its way through the village before exchanging fire on the outskirts of Doan. RPGs and a mortar crew added to the coalition's firepower. During the battle, a Bushmaster vehicle was destroyed when it hit an IED whilst under fire, the crew had to bail out and a digger was wounded and airlifted to hospital. The Taliban eventually fortified themselves on a hill and managed to counter all attacks. The fighting dragged on well into the night.\nAftermath\nThe Australian who was wounded was airlifted to a Coalition hospital in Tarin Kowt and treated for his injuries.  A squad of US soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division which had been assigned as the security force for the region's Civil Affairs forces, assisted in the Quick Reaction Force (QRF), casevac, and resupply of Australian forces.  Over the previous few days, US forces had conducted combat operations in the Kod Valley to the north of Doan. It is estimated that a small number\nof Taliban were killed during the battle. During the battle, the Australians arrested a local Afghan on suspicion of aiding the Taliban. No civilians were killed or injured and the village of Doan was secured.\nReferences"
