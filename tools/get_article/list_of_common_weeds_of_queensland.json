These plants typically produce large numbers of seeds, often excellent at surviving and reproducing in disturbed environments and are commonly the first species to colonise and dominate in these conditions. Weeds may reduce native biodiversity, affect agricultural productivity, the environment, human health and amenity.\nCommon weeds\nSome of the more common weeds of Queensland are listed below. Weeds that are not yet common or established but pose a significant threat are identified by an asterisk. Weeds that are identified as Weeds of National Significance are noted as \"WoNS\".\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Common name\n!Scientific name\n!Origin\n!Description\n!Signif- icance\n!Primary Distribution\n!Image\n!Ref.\n|-\n|African tulip tree\n|align=center | Spathodea campanulata || align=center | tropical Africa || align=center | Fast growing, highly invasive, evergreen tree forming dense stands in gullies and streams, crowding out native vegetation || align=center | Class 3 || align=center | SE Qld and gardens || align=center |  || align=center |\n|-\n|Alligator Weed*\n|align=center | Alternanthera philoxeroides || align=center | South America || align=center | Grows on land in damp soil, or in water as dense floating mats|| align=center | Class 1 WoNS || align=center | Potential to establish in all Queensland coastal areas and inland agricultural and urban areas|| align=center |  || align=center |\n|-\n|Camphor laurel\n|align=center | Cinnamomum camphora || align=center | Asia || align=center | Large attractive shade tree, aggressively replaces native vegetation || align=center | Class 3 || align=center | Gardens throughout Qld || align=center |  || align=center |\n|-\n|Fireweed\n|align=center | Senecio madagascariensis || align=center | Madagascar, Southern Africa || align=center | Daisy-like herb with bright yellow flowers, competes with pasture species || align=center | Class 2 || align=center | New South Wales coast and north to Brisbane || align=center |  || align=center |\n|-\n|Lantana\n|align=center | Lantana camara || align=center | Central, South America|| align=center | Heavily branched shrub that can grow as compact clumps, dense thickets and as scrambling and climbing vines that smother native vegetation || align=center |Class 3 WoNS|| align=center | Most coastal and sub-coastal areas of eastern Australia || align=center |  || align=center |\n|-\n|Mesquite\n|align=center | Prosopis spp. || align=center | North, South America|| align=center | Spread significantly in Queensland, may form dense impenetrable thickets, aggressive competitor and drought tolerant|| align=center | Class 1 WoNS|| align=center | Western Qld || align=center |  || align=center |\n|-\n|Mother of millions\n|align=center | Bryophyllum spp. || align=center | Madagascar|| align=center | Succulent type plant well adapted to dry areas, highly toxic to stock, forms masses of embryoids (plantlets), hard to eradicate || align=center |Class 2|| align=center |Ornamental garden plant, Central Highlands, Burnett|| align=center |  || align=center |\n|-\n|Ochna (aka Mickey Mouse plant)\n|align=center | Ochna serrulata || align=center | Africa|| align=center | Ornamental species, easily dispersed to new areas by birds eating the fruits || align=center | n/a || align=center | Widely planted in gardens|| align=center |  || align=center |\n|-\n|Parkinsonia\n|align=center | Parkinsonia aculeata || align=center | tropical America|| align=center |  Introduced ornamental small shade tree, seeds float, forms dense, thorny thickets along watercourses|| align=center | Class 2 WoNS|| align=center | inland Qld|| align=center |  || align=center |\n|-\n|Parthenium\n|align=center | Parthenium hysterophorus || align=center | tropical America|| align=center | Vigorous coloniser of weak pastures, disturbed areas, brigalow, gidgee and softwood scrub soils.
