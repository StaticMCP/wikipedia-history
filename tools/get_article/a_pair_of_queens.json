      "text": "# A Pair of Queens\n\nShortly after releasing Peace, Love, Death Metal via Eagles of Death Metal, lead singer Jesse Hughes released the two-song EP, A Pair of Queens, on 7\" vinyl as a solo project. The EP contains two tracks, both of which are Queens of the Stone Age covers, which lends to the EP title A Pair of Queens.\nOverview\nAccording to an interview with Rolling Stone, Hughes reported the inspiration for the release, stating \"I was in a hotel room above the Cafe 101 in Hollywood, and a friend of mine was trying to convince me she hadn't heard Queens (of the Stone Age)'s songs,\" he says. \"All I had was my little Roland VS880 recording device, a guitar, and a drum machine. So I recorded two songs (\"Go With the Flow\" and \"Gonna Leave You\"). It's proof that no matter how bad you suck, you cannot destroy a well-written song. It's a clear ode to my friend Josh Homme, who is my guitar hero. I look up to him musically and I just wanted to say, 'Man, you rule.' It's also a vanity spite, it's 'I'm owning your song!'\"\nTrack listing\n# Side Boogie: \"Go with the Flow\"&nbsp;– 4:34\n# Side Woogie: \"Gonna Leave You\"&nbsp;– 2:50\nReferences"
