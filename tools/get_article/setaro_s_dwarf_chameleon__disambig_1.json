It has a reduced throat crest and a tail that is longer than the body in males, and shorter than the body in females.\nGeographic range and habitat\nB. setaroi is endemic to South Africa, where it is restricted to coastal dune forests in northern Kwazulu Natal. It adapts well to suburban gardens, but domestic cats — as introduced predators — will usually kill all chameleons in the immediate area.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Raw LRG (1976). \"A survey of the dwarf chameleons of Natal, South Africa, with description of three new species\".
