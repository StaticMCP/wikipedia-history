His father, Edward Sr., was an electronics technician who played piano and organ part-time in clubs in Washington, D.C; his uncle, Quentin &mdash; actually the same age as Butch &mdash; played guitar. The Warren home was often visited by jazz musicians Billy Hart, Jimmy Smith, and Stuff Smith. The first time Butch Warren played bass was at home on an instrument left by Billy Taylor, who had played bass for Duke Ellington. Warren has cited Jimmy Blanton, the innovative and virtuoso bassist with Ellington from 1939 to 1941, as his biggest inspiration.\nWarren began playing professionally at age 14 in a Washington, D.C. band led by his father. He later worked with other local groups, including that of Stuff Smith, as well as with altoist and bandleader Rick Henderson at the Howard Theatre.\nWhen he was 19, he sat in with Kenny Dorham to substitute for an absent bassist. A few days later, Dorham invited him to New York City, where he spent the next six months as a sideman at a club in Brooklyn. He appeared on his first recording in January 1960 with Dorham, saxophonist Charles Davis, pianist Tommy Flanagan, and drummer Buddy Enlow. Through his friendship with Sonny Clark, he recorded for Blue Note Records in 1961 on Clark's album ''Leapin' and Lopin''. Alfred Lion, producer at Blue Note, hired Warren to fill the vacancy of staff bassist. During this job he played on \"Watermelon Man\" with Herbie Hancock. As sideman, he also recorded with Miles Davis, Hank Mobley, Donald Byrd, Dexter Gordon, Joe Henderson, Jackie McLean, and Stanley Turrentine.\nMental illness and heroin addiction created problems for Warren. In 1963, his friend Sonny Clark died of an overdose. Months later, Thelonious Monk hired the 23-year-old Warren. Monk's band was surrounded by drugs and Warren quit after a yearlong tour. Moving back to D.C., he admitted himself to St. Elizabeths Hospital. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.\nFollowing the onset of his illness he played professionally only occasionally, including a regular gig at the jazz club Columbia Station in Washington D.C.\nHis only solo effort was captured on \"Butch's Blues\" but he was better known as a sideman on many albums, including Dexter Gordon's Go.\nHe died of lung cancer in Silver Spring, Maryland at the age of 74.\nDiscography\nAs leader\n*2011: Butch Warren French Quintet - with Pierrick Menuau (saxophone), Pierre Christophe (piano), Mourad Benhammou (drums) and Jean Philippe Bordier (guitar)\n*2021: Butch Warren & Freddie Redd: Baltimore Jazz Loft- with Matt Wilson (drums) and Brad Linde (tenor saxophone) Bleebop Records (recorded 2013)\nAs sideman\nWith Donald Byrd\n*1961: Royal Flush\n*1961: Free Form\n*1963: A New Perspective\nWith Kenny Dorham\n*1960: The Kenny Dorham Memorial Album\n*1960: Jazz Contemporary\n*1963: Una Mas\nWith Dexter Gordon\n*1962: Go\n*1962: ''A Swingin' Affair\nWith Jackie McLean\n*1959: Vertigo\n*1961: A Fickle Sonance\n*1962: Tippin' the Scales\n*1967: Hipnosis\nWith Hank Mobley\n*1963: No Room for Squares\n*1963: The Turnaround\n*1963: Straight No Filter\nWith Thelonious Monk\n*1963: Miles & Monk at Newport\n*1963: Big Band and Quartet in Concert\n*1963: Monk in Tokyo\n*1964: It's Monk's Time\nWith others\n* 1961: Leapin' and Lopin' – Sonny Clark\n* 1961: High Hope! – Elmo Hope\n* 1962: Takin' Off – Herbie Hancock\n* 1962: Preach Brother! – Don Wilkerson\n* 1962: Jubilee Shout!!! – Stanley Turrentine\n* 1962: Feelin' the Spirit – Grant Green\n* 1962: Exodus – Slide Hampton\n* 1963: Happy Frame of Mind – Horace Parlan\n* 1963: Exultation! – Booker Ervin\n* 1963: Page One – Joe Henderson\n* 1964: Holiday Soul – Bobby Timmons\n* 1965: The Walter Bishop Jr. Trio / 1965'' – Walter Bishop, Jr.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120128132110/http://butchwarren.com/ Official site archived]\n*"
