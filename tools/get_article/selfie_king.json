There are moments that speak for the filmmaker and his love for the medium. For example, the film opens with a shot of a child and closes on a funeral pyre. Here’s hoping this film has birthed a space for more young, fresh minds to come ahead and share their stories. We will find perfection along the way\". Diwakar Pyakurel of Online Khabar wrote, \"Selfie King's strength is its story, not the making. It is a ruthless revelation of the tragedy of a comedian's life. The young director needs to improve his presentation skills to quench the Nepali audience's thirst for ‘good movies\". Sunny Mahat of The Annapurna Express wrote, \"Written by the director himself, the film's screenplay is extremely loose and the story unconvincing\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
