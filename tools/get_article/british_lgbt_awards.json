LGBT celebrities and straight allies are among the people that are recognised at the ceremony, held annually at the London Marriott Hotel County Hall in Westminster.\n2020\nIn 2020, the awards were delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately the ceremony were held virtually on 27 November 2020.\n2021\nIn 2021, the awards returned to an in-person ceremony and were held on 27 August 2021.\n2023\nThe 2023 awards were held on 23 June 2023. The awards were protested by queer climate activists, who sought to draw attention to the awards' sponsorship deals with Shell plc and BP, alongside financial institutions known to finance fossil fuel projects, including HSBC, Santander Bank and Macquarie Capital. Several nominees withdrew after activists raised concerns with them, alongside the planned MC, Sue Perkins.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlgbtawards.com Official site]"
