      "text": "# List of Superfund sites in Delaware\n\nThis is a list of Superfund sites in Delaware designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to create a list of polluted locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.   These locations are known as Superfund sites, and are placed on the National Priorities List (NPL).\nThe NPL guides the EPA in \"determining which sites warrant further investigation\" for environmental remediation.  As of December 16, 2010, there were 14 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in Delaware.  One additional site has been proposed for entry on the list.  Six sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.\nSuperfund sites\n:\n:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!CERCLIS ID!!Name!!County!!Reason!!Proposed!!Listed!!Constructioncompleted!!Partiallydeleted!!Deleted\n|-\n||DED980714141||Chem-Solv, Inc.||Kent||[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615225939/http://cfpub.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0300124] ||01/22/1987 ||08/30/1990 ||06/30/1998 ||N/A ||N/A\n|-\n||DED980704860||Coker's Sanitation Service Landfills||Kent||[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615225953/http://cfpub.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0300097] ||04/10/1985 ||07/22/1987 ||09/29/1993 ||N/A ||N/A\n|-\n||DE8570024010||Dover Air Force Base||Kent||[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615230001/http://cfpub.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0300191] ||10/15/1984 ||03/13/1989 ||09/27/2006 ||N/A ||N/A\n|-\n||DED980693550||Dover Gas Light Company||Kent||[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615230024/http://cfpub.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0300095] ||01/22/1987 ||10/04/1989 ||N/A ||N/A ||N/A\n|-style=\"background:#d0f0c0\"\n||DED980705545||Tyler Refrigeration Pit||Kent||[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615230047/http://cfpub.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0300111] || || || || ||\n|-style=\"background:#d0f0c0\"\n||DED980704951||Wildcat Landfill||Kent||[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615230055/http://cfpub.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0300101] || || || || ||\n|-\n||DED980494496||Army Creek Landfill||New Castle||[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615230117/http://cfpub.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0300086] ||12/30/1982 ||09/08/1983 ||04/29/1994 ||N/A ||N/A\n|-\n||DED980551667||Delaware City PVC Plant||New Castle||[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090719024707/http://cfpub.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0300091] || || || || ||\n|-\n||DED000605972||Delaware Sand & Gravel Landfill||New Castle||[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615230228/http://cfpub.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0300034] || || || || ||\n|-\n||DED980555122||E.I.
