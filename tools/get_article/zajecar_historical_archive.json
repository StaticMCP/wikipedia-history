The archive is primarily serving municipalities of Zaječar, Boljevac and Knjaževac.\nBackground\nThe Historical Archive in Zaječar was established on April 15, 1948, following the orders of the Government and the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of Serbia. In 1951 the archive was renamed the \"City state archive\", and in 1973 it received the official name Historical Archive \"Timočka krajina\" ().\nThe archive holds over 3,000 linear meters of archival materials, organized into 485 collections and document groups. Eleven collections are designated as materials of exceptional significance. Additionally, the archive's library, containing over 10,000 books, is recognized as a cultural asset of great importance. The Historical Archive of Zaječar publishes a professional journal and has received numerous awards, including the Order of Merit for the People with a Silver Star and the Golden Archive Award for 2006.\nThe building that currently houses the Historical Archive was constructed in 1932, designed by local architect P. Đorđević as a residence for Milan Savić, a wealthy mine owner. In December 1978, the building was purchased by the state to serve the needs of the Historical Archive. In 1984, it was declared a cultural asset and designated as a monument of culture, ensuring its protection and preservation.\nSee also\n* List of archives in Serbia\n* Archive of Serbia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.arhivzajecar.org.rs/ Official website]"
