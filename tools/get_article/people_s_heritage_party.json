It claimed to follow the Nkrumahist philosophy. One of the main supporters of the People`s Heritage Party was Mr Komla Agbeli Gbedemah who was a close associate of the founder of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah\nElections\nThe PHP did not win any seats in the Ghanaian parliamentary election in 1992. This was the first and only parliamentary election that it participated. Its candidate in the 1992 Ghanaian presidential election in 1992 was Lt. Gen. Emmanuel Erskine. He came last out of the five candidates with 1.7% of the total vote.\nMerger\nIn 1993, the PHP merged with the National Independence Party, another party that followed Nkrumah's ideology to form the People's Convention Party.\nSee also\n*Convention People's Party\nReferences"
