There are two principal varieties, Gbari (West Gwari) and Gbagyi (East Gwari), which have some difficulty in communication; sociolinguistically they are distinct languages.\nPhonology\nVowels\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Vowels\n!\n!Front\n!Central\n!Back\n|-\n!Close\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Mid\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Open\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n* /i, u, e, o/ can also have allophones [ɪ, ʊ, ɛ, ʌ].\n* Nasal vowels /ĩ, ũ, ẽ, õ/ can also be heard as [ɪ̃, ʊ̃, ɛ̃, ʌ̃].\nConsonants\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Gbagyi consonants\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!Labial\n!Alveolar\n!Palatal\n!Velar\n!Labial-velar\n!Glottal\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Nasal\n|\n|\n|()\n|()\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Stop/Affricate\n!voiceless\n|\n|\n|()\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!voiced\n|\n|\n|()\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Fricative\n!voiceless\n|\n|\n|()\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!voiced\n|\n|\n|()\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Approximant\n!central\n|\n|()\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!lateral\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n* The following sounds may be labialized as /pʷ, bʷ, fʷ, vʷ, kʷ, ɡʷ, mʷ, k͡pʷ, ɡ͡bʷ, hʷ/ and palatalized as /pʲ, bʲ, fʲ, vʲ, kʲ, ɡʲ, mʲ, lʲ, wʲ/.\n* Sounds /t, d, s, z, n/ when palatalized are always heard as [tʃ, dʒ, ʃ, ʒ, ɲ].\n* Sounds /f, b/ can be heard as bilabial sounds [ɸ, β] in free variation.\n* /n/ is heard as velar [ŋ] when preceding velar consonants.\n* /n/ becomes a labialized-velar [ŋʷ] when preceding a /w/.\n* Sounds /bʷ, ɡʷ, ɡʲ/ are softened to fricatives [βʷ, ɣʷ, ɣʲ] when preceding a glide, in medial-intervocalic position.\n* /ɡ͡b/ is heard as an implosive [ɓ] in free variation.\n* /h/ only has a limited occurrence, but it also may be allophonic with /f/ in Northern Gbagyi.
