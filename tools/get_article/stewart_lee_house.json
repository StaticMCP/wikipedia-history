It was built in 1844, and is a three-story, three-bay, Greek Revival style brick townhouse.  Its low hipped roof is pierced by four interior end chimneys and surrounded by a simple molded cornice with a plain frieze.  In 1864, Robert E. Lee's wife and daughter occupied the house after the confiscation of \"Arlington.\" On April 15, 1865, General Lee retired to the home following the surrender at Appomattox.  He resided there only until June 1865, due to the \"result of constant callers.\" In 1893, the building was given to the Virginia Historical Society \"for the use and occupation of the Virginia Historical Society as a library and assembly rooms\"; they occupied it until 1959.  The house was conveyed to the Confederate Memorial Literary Society in 1961, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/va0582/ Norman Stewart House, 707 East Franklin Street, Richmond, Independent City, VA]: 1 photo at Historic American Buildings Survey"
