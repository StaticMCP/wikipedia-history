The narrative follows residents of the fictional town of Discovery Mountain as they face mysteries, moral dilemmas, and spiritual lessons, tying into biblical themes.\n## History and development\nVoice of Prophecy announced the upcoming series in February 2017 on its *Disclosure* program, indicating a launch in April of that year. The podcast’s listing on Listen Notes confirms a first publication date of **April 19, 2017**. Over the years, the show has grown in scope: as of 2025, it lists 34 seasons (including “mini” seasons) on its official website, with dozens of episodes per season.\nIn an interview published by Audio Theatre Central, creator Jean Boonstra described the conceptual genesis: combining her background in writing children’s stories with the Voice of Prophecy’s heritage in radio, she envisioned a fictional mountain town and summer-camp setting as a framework for modern parables.\nA later profile by Audio Theatre Central (2019) further describes the narrative structure and production processes of *Discovery Mountain*.\nAdditionally, Christian parenting blog *Growing Kids for the Kingdom* ran a “Podcast Highlight” feature in 2024, including an interview with Boonstra about her aims, method, and the show's spiritual goals.\n## Format and production\nEpisodes typically run 20–30 minutes. Between regular seasons, shorter “mini-episodes” are released. The official site states that the series remains free to all families, with a paid “Club” membership (Discovery Mountain Club) offering ad-free access and bonus content.\nProduction involves scriptwriting (often by Boonstra or other Voice of Prophecy writers), casting via auditions, studio recording sessions, editing, and sound-design integration. During the COVID-19 era, remote voice contributions and virtual direction have been adopted, as described in the *Growing Kids* feature.\n## Cast and staff\n- **Jean Boonstra** — Creator, lead executive producer, head writer, and narrator in many episodes.\n- **Ruben Gomez** — Executive producer and voice of lead character **Jake (Jacob P.) Donovan**.\nRecurring and guest cast vary by season and are drawn from Voice of Prophecy personnel, volunteer actors, and remote contributors.\n## Distribution and broadcast\n*Discovery Mountain* is distributed via its public RSS feed to major podcast platforms (including Apple Podcasts) as well as via its website. The show also airs on the LifeTalk Radio Network; per the LifeTalk site, it broadcasts twice weekly (Eastern Time) and is synced with podcast episodes.\nThe show’s official site also includes behind-the-scenes content, bloopers, and cast/character pages.\n## Reception and rankings\nOn Listen Notes, *Discovery Mountain* carries a Listen Score in the mid-50s and is ranked in the **top 0.5%** of podcasts globally (by their indexing). The Listen Notes site defines that percentile ranking as a comparison among all podcasts indexed by the platform.\nThe show is included in the *Audio Drama Directory* under children’s dramatized series.\nOn the LifeTalk site, *Discovery Mountain* is described as a “weekly 30 minute dramatized audio program” for children, and notes its 2017 launch. The promotional materials stress that it is a “Bible-based adventure radio series for kids.”\nIn *Growing Kids for the Kingdom*’s audio drama roundup, *Discovery Mountain* is listed among their recommended Christian audio dramas with positive commentary on its blend of storytelling and biblical lessons.\nA 2024 article in the *Lake Union Herald* recounts that the author found an advertisement in 2017 for a new kids’ program called *Discovery Mountain* and began listening from that time, indicating public visibility of the program in denominational media.\n## External links\n* [Official site](https://discoverymountain.com/)\n* [Discovery Mountain on Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/discovery-mountain-discovery-mountain-9sf0hdMJrQ3/)\n* [Audio Theatre Central interview / profile coverage](https://www.audiotheatrecentral.com/2019/08/4-pillars-of-audio-drama-modern-distribution-jean-boonstra-interview.html)\n* [Audio Theatre Central discovery-mountain article](https://www.audiotheatrecentral.com/2019/11/discovery-mountain-serial-audio-drama.html)\n* [Growing Kids for the Kingdom podcast highlight](https://www.growingkidsforthekingdom.com/childrens-podcast-highlight-discovery-mountain-with-jean-boonstra/)\n* [LifeTalk (radio partner) program page](https://lifetalk.net/discovery-mountain/)\n* [The Story Channel — Discovery Mountain (if desired)]\n* [Lake Union Herald article “For Such a Time as This”](https://www.lakeunionherald.org/archive/articles/for-such-a-time-as-this)\nReferences"
