He is best known today as the subject of an award-winning biography by his son, Gary Imlach, titled My Father and Other Working Class Football Heroes. Another son, Mike Imlach, had a brief professional career in the 1980s.\nClub career\nEarly career\nImlach was born in the fishing town of Lossiemouth, on the Moray Firth coast. He became the first man in five generations of the family name who chose not to become a fisherman. He started his professional football career with Scottish Highland Football League Club, Lossiemouth F.C. He then moved south to Bury FC at the age of 20.\nBury paid £150 for his services in May 1952. He stayed at Gigg Lane for two seasons.\nDerby County\nHe joined Derby County in a player-exchange deal. However the \"Rams\" were relegated out of the Second Division at the end of the 1954–55 season. Imlach had a falling out with the club over a housing dispute as his promised accommodation was given to new signing John Buchanan. He was retained by the club on reduced wages.\nNottingham Forest\nHe joined Nottingham Forest for £5,000 in 1955. He was part of the City Ground club's 1959 FA Cup winning team providing the pass or assist for the first goal in the final by Roy Dwight. Forest were 2–0 up after 14 minutes. Luton Town hit back midway through the second half after Dwight broke his leg in the 33rd minute. Forest had further personnel issues when cramping reduced Bill Whare to little more than a hobbling spectator. Imlach helped Forest protect their 2–1 lead to lift the trophy at Wembley.\nLater career\nHe moved to the vanquished cup final opponents Luton Town, for £8,000 in 1960. He then wound down his career with short spells at Coventry City (1960–62), Crystal Palace (1962–64), Dover (1964–65), Chelmsford City (1965–66) and Crystal Palace again (1966–67).\nInternational career\nThe first Nottingham Forest player ever to be selected by Scotland, Imlach made four appearances for the Scottish national side in 1958, against Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and France, the latter two games taking place at the 1958 FIFA World Cup finals in Sweden. However, prior to the 1970s, caps were only issued to those who appeared in matches against the other home countries, so Imlach never received a cap.\nIn 2005, Imlach's son Gary was at the forefront of a popular campaign to have Imlach and others, such as Eddie Turnbull, retrospectively awarded caps. After concerted public pressure, the Scottish Football Association bowed to the popular will in 2006 and officially capped all players affected by the previous rule.\nCoaching career\nWhen Imlach stopped playing he became a trainer and spent the next 12 years coaching at Notts County, Everton, Blackpool and Bury. His time with Everton was the longest spell, Imlach acting as first assistant trainer then first team trainer for the \"Toffees\" between 1969 and 1976.\nIn 2009 a street of new houses in his home town of Lossiemouth – Imlach Way – was named in his honour.\nHonours\nNottingham Forest\n*FA Cup: 1958–59\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
