Spanish ambassador Oñate persuaded Ferdinand to grant Maximilian any part of the Electorate of the Palatinate to occupy, as well as the Elector title of Frederick V. Moreover, Oñate exceeded his duties by guaranteeing Ferdinand Spanish support in dealing with the Bohemian rebels. Based on the terms of the treaty, Maximilian, leader of the Catholic League, made his Bavarian forces available to Emperor Ferdinand. In return, Maximilian was granted territories in the Palatine in order to maintain his forces.\nReferences\nSources\n*Sutherland, N.M.
