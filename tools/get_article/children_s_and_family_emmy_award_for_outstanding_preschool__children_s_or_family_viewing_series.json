The category was established at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2022 and is a sister category to the Children's and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Young Teen Series, which targets older children.\nThe current holder of the award is the Apple TV+ musical comedy Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock, which won at the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards. Programming aimed towards children and young adults was honored from 1974 to 2021 with the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Series, which was presented under various names across its lifespan, and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program, which was presented from 1950 to 2020. Following the establishment of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards, both categories were discontinued.\nFrom 2022 to 2025, the category was known as '''Children's and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's or Family Viewing Series'''. As of the 4th Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2026, the Outstanding Preschool Series category was discontinued and merged into this one, giving the category it's current name.\nWinners and nominations\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"10%\" | Series\n! width=\"30%\" | Producers\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n! width=\"3%\" | Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2022(1st)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n|The Baby-Sitters Club\n| '''Lucia Aniello, Naia Cucukov, Michael De Luca, Benjamin Forrer, Lucy Kitada, Sascha Rothchild, Rachel Shukert, Frank Smith (executive producers); Ryan O'Connell (supervising producer); Matthew Chipera, Ashley Glazier, Ann M.
