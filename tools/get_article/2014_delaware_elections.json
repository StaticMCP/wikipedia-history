Half of Delaware's executive officers were up for election as well as a United States Senate seat and Delaware's at-large seat in the United States House of Representatives. Primary elections were held on September 9, 2014. , this was the last time Republicans won any statewide election in Delaware.\nFederal\nSenate\nIncumbent Democratic senator Chris Coons, who was elected in a 2010 special election, ran for re-election to a first full term in office.\nHe faced Republican businessman Kevin Wade and Green Party computer science professor Andrew Groff in the general election,}}\nHouse of Representatives\nDelaware has a single at-large congressional district.

He was re-elected with 59% to Izzo's 37%, August's 2% and Gesty's 2%.\nState\nConstitutional officers\nAttorney general\nIncumbent Democratic Attorney General Beau Biden did not run for re-election to a third term in office. He was instead going to run for Governor of Delaware in the 2016 election to succeed term-limited Democratic governor Jack Markell, but he died of brain cancer on May 30, 2015, at the age of 46.\nLieutenant Governor of Delaware Matthew Denn was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. State Prosecutor Kathleen Jennings had considered running, but decided not to and endorsed Denn.\nThe Republicans attempted to recruit former United States Attorney for the District of Delaware Colm Connolly. He considered running, but declined to do so. The Republican nominee was corporate attorney Ted Kittila, who was unopposed for his party's nomination.\nAlso running were Independent Party nominee David Graham, a tax auditor, former Republican candidate for governor and attorney general and the Independent Party-endorsed write-in candidate for Governor in 2012; Green Party nominee Catherine Damavandi, who served as a deputy attorney general of Delaware from 2000 to 2014; and Libertarian John Machurek, a candidate for the State House in 2012.\n}}\nTreasurer\n| map_size = 210px\n| map_caption = Simpler:    Barney:\n| title = Treasurer\n| before_election = Chipman Flowers Jr.\n| before_party = Democratic Party (United States)\n| after_election = Ken Simpler\n| after_party = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\nIncumbent Democratic State Treasurer Chipman L. Flowers, Jr. had planned to run for re-election to a second term in office, but after being dogged by controversy through his term in office over his use of office credit cards and travel spending and his clashes with Governor Markell and the state Cash Management Policy Board, he announced his withdrawal from the race on August 15, 2014. However, he filed a withdrawal form that was postdated to withdraw him from the race on August 28, which meant that he couldn't be removed from the ballot until that date, a move which drew criticism. His failure to withdraw in time meant that his name appeared on absentee ballots and though his name was covered at polling places, he did still receive some votes. The Democratic primary was won by Sean Barney, a former policy director for Governor Markell and former adviser to U.S. Senator Tom Carper, who had announced his candidacy before Flowers had attempted to run for re-election.\n}}\nTwo individuals ran for the Republican party's nomination, money manager Ken Simpler and Sher Valenzuela, former Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in 2012. The Republican primary campaign was a bitter one, marked by infighting and with outside spending behind both candidates, who criticised each other frequently.\nAlso running was Green Party nominee David Chandler, a mathematics professor at the University of Delaware.\nSimpler's win meant that he became the first non-incumbent Republican to win a statewide election in Delaware since 1994.\nAuditor of Accounts\n| map_size = 210px\n| map_caption = Wagner:   Mayrack:\n| title = Auditor\n| before_election = Tom Wagner\n| before_party = Republican Party (United States)\n| after_election = Tom Wagner\n| after_party = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\nIncumbent Republican Auditor of Accounts R.
