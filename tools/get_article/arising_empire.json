It was first established in 2015 in Donzdorf, Baden-Württemberg.\nHistory\nArising Empire was founded in 2015 by Nuclear Blast owner Markus Staiger and former \"People Like You Records\" manager Tobbe Falarz.\nIt was, besides the former subsidiary company SharpTone Records, which was founded shortly after Arising Empire, a sub-label of Nuclear Blast. The distribution was taken on by Warner Music at the time. Most of the bands who were and still are signed to the label hail from Central Europe, Germany in particular, while some bands like Imminence, Royal Republic, and Aviana that hailed from Sweden, Novelists, and Landmvrks originally of France, as well as For the Fallen Dreams and Lionheart who hail from the United States, and One Morning Left of Finland.\nThe first set of bands signed by the label were Amor, Imminence, Novelists, and GWLT.
