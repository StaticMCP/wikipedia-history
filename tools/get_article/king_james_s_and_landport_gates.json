The majority of the town walls were demolished in 1860.\nKing James's Gate\nKing James's Gate was built in 1687, probably as a reconstruction of the older Point gate on the same site, to control access to Portsmouth from The Point. When the town walls were demolished the gate was moved to a pavement of St. Michaels Road. At a later, unknown, date it was moved again and is now roughly  from its original position, forming part of the boundary of United Services Ground in Burnaby Road. During the moves, much of the original ornate stonework was purposefully sold or lost.\nLandport Gate\nLandport Gate was built in 1760 as a new main entry point to Portsmouth from the Dockyard and growing community on the Common. It replaced the original main point of access at the end of the High Street. Unlike the majority of Portsmouth's defences, the gate is still in its original position.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/king-jamess-and-landport-gates-portsmouth/  Visitor information : English Heritage]"
