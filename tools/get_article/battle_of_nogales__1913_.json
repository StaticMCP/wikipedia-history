Rebel forces under General Álvaro Obregón attacked the federal garrison of about 400 infantry. Obregón's army included infantry, cavalry and at least one artillery piece. Fighting lasted for a few hours before the federal commander, Colonel Emilio Kosterlitzky, was captured. The remaining federal troops retreated across the border and surrendered to the United States Army garrison of Nogales, Arizona. Captain Cornelius C. Smith relieved the federals of their weapons and they eventually found their way back to Mexico. Six rebels were killed in action and nine were wounded. The federals lost four men killed and five wounded, and Nogales, Sonora, fell to the Constitutionalists.\nSee also\n*Pancho Villa Expedition\nReferences\n*Trimble, Marshall, (1998), Arizona, A Cavalcade of History Treasure Chest Publications, Tucson, Arizona\n*Cornelius Smith, Emilio Kosterlitzky, Eagle of Sonora (1970)"
