Today the locomotive depot, that lies on the  Schönebeck to Güsten railway line, is operated by the society Eisenbahnfreunde Traditionsbahnbetriebswerk Staßfurt (Railway Friends of the Stassfurt Heritage Locomotive Depot).\nThe locomotive roundhouse, with its 20m turntable, is over 100 years old and can accommodate 24 locomotives. Until 1988, DRG Class 41 and Class 50 steam locomotives were deployed from here on regular passenger, fast-stopping and freight services.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.eisenbahnfreunde-stassfurt.de/index.html Eisenbahnfreunde Traditionsbahnbetriebswerk Staßfurt e.V.]"
