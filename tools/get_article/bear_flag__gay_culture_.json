The colors of the flag—dark brown, orange/rust, golden yellow, tan, white, gray, and black—symbolize species of animal bears throughout the world. Though not necessarily referring to human skin color or hair color, the flag was designed with inclusion in mind. The bear culture celebrates secondary sex characteristics such as growth of body hair and facial hair, traits associated with bears.\nBackground\nCraig Byrnes created the bear flag in Washington, D.C. in 1995. Byrnes' undergraduate degree in psychology involved designing a senior project about the bear culture that has exploded since the early 1980s, of which he had firsthand experience. He thought it might be fitting to design a flag that would best represent the bear community and include it with the results of his research. To do this, he received help from another influential member of the bear cultural community. Four variations were sewing machine-constructed and Byrnes won approval to display the four  prototype flags at the Chesapeake Bay \"Bears of Summer\" events in July 1995.\nThe winning design (a version created by Paul Witzkoske) is a field of simple horizontal stripes with a paw print in the upper left corner — a layout similar to the leather pride flag. The colors represent the furs of different bear species throughout the world as a sign of inclusivity. The flag is trademarked.\nGallery\nFile:Gay bear flag in action bristol.jpeg|The bear flag flown next to the rainbow flag as an expression of bear and gay pride\nFile:Bear Pride flag of Australia.svg|An Australian version using the bear paw from the Brotherhood flag\nFile:People lifting Bear Pride Flag at Helsinki Pride 2022.jpg|The bear flag flown at the Helsinki Pride parade in 2022\nFile:DC and the Development of the International Bear Brotherhood Flag Marker, posted in Washington, DC.jpg|This historical marker in Washington, DC shares local history of the bear flag and bear fraternal organizations\nOther\nAn International Bear Pride tartan was registered with the Scottish Register of Tartans in 2015.
