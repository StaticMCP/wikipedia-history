Andrew Feustel, Oleg Artemyev, and Richard R. Arnold were transferred from Expedition 55, with Andrew Feustel taking the commander role. Alexander Gerst, Serena M. Auñón-Chancellor, and Sergey Prokopyev launched aboard Soyuz MS-09, on June 6, 2018. Expedition 56 ended with the departure of Soyuz MS-08 on October 4, 2018.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Position\n!First part\n(June 3 – 6, 2018)\n!Second part\n(June 6 – October 4, 2018)\n|-\n!Commander\n| colspan=2 align=center| Andrew Feustel, NASAThird spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 1\n| colspan=2 align=center| Oleg Artemyev, RSASecond spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 2\n| colspan=2 align=center| Richard R.

The additions will provide enhanced views during the final phase of approach and docking of the SpaceX Crew Dragon and Boeing CST 100 Starliner commercial crew spacecraft that will soon begin launching from American soil.\nThe astronauts also swapped out a camera assembly on the starboard truss of the station used to film NASA TV and closed an aperture door on the CATS experiment outside the Japanese Kibo module in preparation for disposal on SpaceX CRS 15 and replacement by its successor, ECOSTRESS. Get aheads involved relocating an adjustable grapple bar to the S1 Truss and securing the Flex Hose Rotary Coupler in preparation for replacement on the next spacewalk. During the spacewalk Feustel beat Jerry Ross, his STS 125 crewmate Dr. John Grunsfeld, Fyoder Yurchikhin, and Peggy Whitson to become third on the list of all time space walkers.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Expedition 56EVA 2*\n| Oleg Artemyev\nSergey Prokopyev\n|August 15, 2018,\n16:17\n|August 15, 2018,\n00:03\n|7 hours 46 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |The cosmonauts launched four cubesats and installed the Icarus experiment.

After learning about the leak upon waking up, the astronauts discovered a 2&nbsp;mm hole in the orbital module of the Soyuz MS-09 spacecraft.  The hole was initially repaired with tape, followed by a permanent repair with gauze and epoxy.\nReferences"
