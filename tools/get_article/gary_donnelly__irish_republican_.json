While serving his sentence Donnelly briefly went on hunger strike following his removal from the republican wing of HM Prison Maghaberry. Prison officials explained the decision claiming Donnelly had received a death threat from the Real IRA, a charge Donnelly denied.\nIn August 2010 Donnelly was charged under the auspices of \"terrorism legislation\" in connection with three pipe bomb attacks in September 2009. Authorities accused Donnelly of being in possession of a mobile phone linked to the attacks. On 22 December of the same year the charges were dropped.\nIn addition to Donnelly's March 2010 conviction, he has been charged with assaulting police officers on two other occasions. In both cases the charges were eventually dropped.\nIn November 2014, Donnelly, along with two co-defendants, was sentenced to six-months in prison for \"causing criminal damage\" by writing an anti-internment slogan on the historic walls of Derry. Donnelly's solicitor asserted that \"writing political slogans had been a long-standing tradition and there were no objections from local residents to the graffiti.\" In January 2015, Donnelly was successful in his appeal of the sentence and was granted a 12-month conditional discharge. He was supported by Irish politicians Clare Daly, Éamon Ó Cuív, Thomas Pringle, and Maureen O'Sullivan. They claimed the charges were unfair.\nIn July 2015, following a three-volley salute at the funeral of Patsy O'Hara's mother, Donnelly's house was searched by the PSNI. No arrests were made.\nOn 7 January 2018, Donnelly was arrested and questioned in connection with the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, an ex-Sinn Fein member turned British agent. Donnelly was released without charge a day later.\nIn April 2024, Donnelly was arrested with five others for participating in a Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions demonstration at a supermarket on the Strand Road in Derry.\nPolitical career\nOn 24 May 2014, Donnelly was elected to the Derry and Strabane District Council. Although a purported member of the 32CSM at the time, Donnelly ran as an independent and received 1,154 votes.\nHe supported independent candidate Thomas Pringle in the Donegal constituency in the 2016 general election.\nDonnelly was re-elected to his council seat on 4 May 2019 with 1,374 first-preference votes.\nOn 20 May 2023, Donnelly was elected to a third term on the council, topping the poll with 1,868 first-preference votes.\nReferences"
