Though not extensively documented in mainstream historical sources, the event is preserved in Baloch oral tradition and manuscripts such as the *Makran Nama*.\nBackground\nDuring the Mongol invasions of the Islamic world in the 13th century, the Mongols advanced into parts of Persia and eastern Islamic lands.
