These ceremonies honour music industry achievements in Canada during the previous year.\nThe primary ceremonies were hosted by Pamela Anderson at the Halifax Metro Centre on 2 April and televised on CTV. Buck 65 was the ceremony's introduction and preview announcer. Music artists Bedouin Soundclash, Broken Social Scene, Divine Brown, Hedley, Massari and Nickelback performed songs at these ceremonies. Also performing were the co-winners for the 2006 International Album of the Year, The Black Eyed Peas and Coldplay.\nBryan Adams was the 2006 inductee into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. Chris Martin of Coldplay introduced Adams at the primary ceremony.\nMichael Bublé won four awards, more than any other individual that year. Besides winning Artist of the Year, his album ''It's Time'' won in both the Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year categories. His song \"Home\" from that album was declared Single of the Year.\nAwards for most categories were presented on 1 April in a non-televised ceremony at the Halifax World Trade and Convention Centre hosted by Jully Black, with performances by Kardinal Offishall, The Road Hammers and Martha Wainwright. This Saturday gala included the presentation of the Junos' first Humanitarian award to Bruce Cockburn. The Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award was given to True North Records founder Bernie Finkelstein.\nInternational telecast\nThe 2006 awards were the first to be televised by broadcasters outside Canada, as seen on the following MTV-related operations:\n* Australia (VH1)\n* China (MTV)\n* India (VH1)\n* Italy (MTV)\n* Latin America (VH1)\n* Malaysia (MTV Asia)\n* Portugal (MTV)\n* Singapore (MTV Asia)\n* Taiwan (MTV Asia)\n* United Kingdom (VH1)\n* United States (MTV2)\nControversy\nDuring the televised ceremony, a commercial aired congratulating Michael Bublé for his Single of the Year victory, half an hour before the award was announced.\nBoth CTV and Warner Music Canada have indicated that they did not, in fact, have advance knowledge that Bublé was the actual winner. As is normal practice, Warner had prepared a number of contingency ads congratulating its artists, to be aired only in the event that the artist in question was actually named a winner. CTV has confirmed that its control room technicians mistakenly aired the Bublé ad in place of another congratulatory announcement.\nHost of the show, Pamela Anderson made numerous failed attempts to joke during the show and spoke out against the seal hunt, which elicited loud boos from the audience.  Quotes included, \"One of my favourite artists couldn't be here tonight; Seal. He was afraid he might get clubbed to death.\"\nNominees and winners\nArtist of the Year\nWinner: Michael Bublé\nOther nominees:\n* Boom Desjardins\n* Rex Goudie\n* Diana Krall\n* Kalan Porter\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: Nickelback\nOther nominees:\n* Barenaked Ladies\n* Blue Rodeo\n* Our Lady Peace\n* Theory of a Deadman\nat the 2006 Juno Awards]]\nNew Artist of the Year\nWinner: Daniel Powter\nOther nominees:\n* Divine Brown\n* Jonas\n* Skye Sweetnam\n* Martha Wainwright\nNew Group of the Year\nWinner: Bedouin Soundclash\nOther nominees:\n* Boys Night Out\n* Hedley\n* Pocket Dwellers\n* Silverstein\nJack Richardson Producer of the Year\nWinner: Neil Young: \"The Painter\" by Neil Young\nOther nominees:\n* Jann Arden and Russell Broom: \"Where No One Knows Me\" and \"Willing To Fall Down\" by Jann Arden\n* David Foster: \"Feeling Good\" and \"Home\" by Michael Bublé\n* Nickelback (co-producer Joey Moi): \"Animals\" and \"Photograph\" by Nickelback\n* Garth Richardson: \"Gunnin\" and \"Villain\" by Hedley\nRecording Engineer of the Year\nWinner: Vic Florencia: \"Everyday is a Holiday\" and \"Melancholy Melody\" by Esthero\nOther nominees:\n* Russell Broom: \"God Bless The American Housewife\" by SHeDaisy, \"Where No One Knows Me\" by Jann Arden\n* Adam Messinger and Dylan Bell: \"Dry Cleaner from Des Moines\" and \"Sittin' In the Cellar\" by Cadence\n* Randy Staub: \"Angels Losing Sleep\" by Our Lady Peace, \"Animals\" by Nickelback\n* Denis Tougas: \"Oleander\" by Sarah Harmer, \"Independent Thief\" by Kathleen Edwards\nSongwriter of the Year\nWinner: Arcade Fire: \"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\" (with Josh Deu), \"Rebellion (Lies)\", \"Wake Up\"\nOther nominees:\n* Kathleen Edwards: \"Back to Me\" (with Colin Cripps), \"Copied Keys\", \"In State\"\n* Joel Plaskett: \"Happen Now\", \"Lying on a Beach\", \"Natural Disaster\"\n* Ronald Eldon Sexsmith: \"Lemonade Stand\", \"Listen\", \"One Less Shadow\"\n* Neil Young: \"The Painter\", \"Prairie Wind\", \"When God Made Me\"\nFan Choice Award\nWinner: Simple Plan\nOther nominees:\n* Celine Dion\n* Diana Krall\n* Michael Bublé\n* Nickelback\nNominated albums\nAlbum of the Year\nWinner: It’s Time, Michael Bublé\nOther nominees:\n* All The Right Reasons, Nickelback\n* Christmas Songs, Diana Krall\n* 219 Days, Kalan Porter\n* Under The Lights, Rex Goudie\nAboriginal Recording of the Year\nWinner: Hometown, Burnt Project 1\nOther nominees:\n* Life Is..., Eagle & Hawk\n* Muskrat Blues and Rock & Roll, Billy Joe Green\n* Rattle & Drum, Asani\n* Sinaa, Tanya Tagaq\nAdult Alternative Album of the Year\nWinner: Prairie Wind, Neil Young\nOther nominees:\n* Are You Ready, Blue Rodeo\n* Back to Me, Kathleen Edwards\n* Broken (and other rogue states), Luke Doucet\n* Ex-Girlfriends, Low Millions\nAlternative Album of the Year\nWinner: Broken Social Scene, Broken Social Scene\nOther nominees:\n* Elevator, Hot Hot Heat\n* Live It Out, Metric\n* So Jealous, Tegan and Sara\n* Twin Cinema, The New Pornographers\nBlues Album of the Year\nWinner: Let It Loose, Kenny \"Blues Boss\" Wayne\nOther nominees:\n* The Gas and the Clutch, The Perpetrators\n* Songs of Vice and Sorrow, Julian Fauth\n* Villanelle, Paul Reddick\n* Voice + Story, Harrison Kennedy\nCD/DVD Artwork Design of the Year\nWinner: Hipeponymous by The Tragically Hip: Garnet Armstrong, Rob Baker, Susan Michalek, Will Ruocco\nOther nominees:\n* Broken Social Scene by Broken Social Scene: Kevin Drew, Christopher Mills, Justin Peroff, Louise Upperton\n* In A Coma: 1995–2005 by Matthew Good: Garnet Armstrong, Matthew Good, Ivan Otis\n* A Story-Gram From Vinyl Café Inc. by Stuart McLean: Seth\n* 2005 Album by Wintersleep: Jud Haynes, James Mejia\nChildren's Album of the Year\nWinner: Baroque Adventure: The Quest for Arundo Donax, Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra\nOther nominees:\n* A Butterfly in Time, CMSM Concert Theatre Productions\n* Canada Needs You (Volume One), Mike Ford\n* The Fabulous Song, Michelle Campagne and Davy Gallant\n* Happy All of the Time, Jake\nContemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year\nWinner: Amanda Falk, Amanda Falk\nOther nominees:\n* The Art of Breaking, Thousand Foot Krutch\n* In This Time, Patricia Shirley\n* ''Livin' for Something, Janelle\n* MMHMM, Relient K\nClassical Album of the Year (large ensemble)\nWinner: Beethoven: Symphonies nos. 5 et 6, Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra, Bruno Weil\nOther nominees:\n* J.S.
