It was the country's first direct vote for president. At the time, the country was a one-party state with the All People's Congress as the only legal party.\nMomoh was named as the APC's presidential candidate after retiring president Siaka Stevens persuaded several other hopefuls to stand down. Voters only had the option of approving or rejecting his candidacy. According to official results, 99.85% of voters confirmed Momoh in office, with just over 4,000 people voting no.\nResults\nReferences"
