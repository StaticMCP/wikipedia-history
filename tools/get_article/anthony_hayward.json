He is a regular contributor to The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph, and has written more than 20 books about television and film.

It was described by the Far Eastern Economic Review as \"an excellent introduction to abuses of power around the world\" and by Julian Petley (The Independent) as \"a fascinating account of the changing nature of censorship on British television\". Den Shewman, of the American film trade magazine Variety, wrote: \"Anthony Hayward's excellent account of Pilger's work shows how [his] sensibility [to justice and injustice] has driven Pilger to create 50 British television documentaries over the last 30 years, programs that have changed public policy and saved lives… Pilger's professional life has been dedicated to exploring tragic situations, and Hayward stares unblinkingly into these horrors\". In 2013, Profiles International Media published an updated account, Breaking the Silence: The Films of John Pilger, as an e-book to tie in with Pilger's documentary film Utopia.\nWhich Side Are You On? Ken Loach and His Films, Hayward's 2004 book, was described by the New Statesman as \"an eloquent insight into the work of Britain's finest and most courageous film director\".\nMedia appearances\nAs well as giving scores of radio and television interviews, Hayward has been chair or speaker at many events, including the Hay Festival of Literature and the Arts (2001, 2004, 2006), the Ways with Words Festival, Dartington (2001), the Mashamshire Arts Festival (2005), the Bradford Film Festival (2006, 2007) and the AV Festival (2008). The discussion with John Pilger that he chaired at the 2006 Hay Festival was included as a bonus feature with the DVDs Documentaries That Changed the World (2006) and Heroes – The Films of John Pilger 1970–2007 (2008).\nIn 2024, Hayward hosted the opening evening of the British Film Institute's month-long season Hidden Truths: John Pilger and the Power of Documentary, presenting an illustrated career overview, then chairing a panel discussion on the journalist and documentary-maker's legacy with Ken Loach, Richard Creasey, Victoria Brittain and  Christopher Hird.\nBooks\n*Who’s Who on Television (Boxtree, 1990, 1994, 1996)\n*Coronation Street: Celebrating 30 Years (co-author and editor, Boxtree, 1990)\n*Phantom: Michael Crawford Unmasked (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1991)\n*Life in the Street: Coronation Street Past and Present (co-author and editor, Boxtree, 1991)\n*Street Cred: Spotlight on Coronation Street’s Rising Stars (Boxtree, 1991)\n*The Who’s Who of Soap Operas (Guinness Publishing, 1991)\n*The Boxtree A-Z of TV Stars (Boxtree, 1992)\n*TV Unforgettables (with Deborah Hayward, Guinness Publishing, 1993)\n*Annie’s Song: My Life & Emmerdale (with Sheila Mercier, Titan Books, 1994)\n*The New and Revised Guinness Who’s Who of Soap Operas (Guinness Publishing, 1995)\n*Prime Suspect (co-author and editor, Carlton Books, 1996)\n*The Making of Moll Flanders (Headline, 1996)\n*The Emmerdale Companion: A Celebration of Twenty-five Years (Orion Media, 1997)\n*Gold: The Making of Band of Gold and the Sequel Gold (Chameleon Books/André Deutsch, 1997)\n*Emmerdale: Behind the Scenes (Orion Media, 1998)\n*The Peak Practice Companion (with Deborah Hayward, Orion Media,1998)\n*Where the Heart Is (with Deborah Hayward, Orion Media, 1999)\n*Julie Christie (Robert Hale, 2000)\n*In the Name of Justice: The Television Reporting of John Pilger (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001)\n*TV (\"The Good Web Guide\" series, The Good Web Guide, 2001)\n*Which Side Are You On?
