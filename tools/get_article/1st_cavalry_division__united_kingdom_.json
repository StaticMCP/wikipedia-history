During the Second World War it was a first line formation, formed from Yeomanry Regiments. It fought in the Middle East before being converted to the 10th Armoured Division.\nNapoleonic Wars\nDuring the Peninsular War, Wellington organized his cavalry into The Cavalry Division from June 1809 under Major-General Sir William Payne. This performed a purely administrative, rather than tactical, role; the normal tactical headquarters were provided by brigades commanding two, later usually three, regiments. On 3 June 1810, Payne returned home and his second-in-command, Major-General Stapleton Cotton, took command. Cotton was to remain in command thereafter and effectively acted as Wellington's chief of cavalry.\nOn 19 June 1811, the cavalry was reorganized as two divisions and The Cavalry Division was redesignated as 1st Cavalry Division with the formation of the 2nd Cavalry Division. The divisions were once again amalgamated as The Cavalry Division on 21 April 1813 with Cotton (Lieutenant-General from 1 January 1812) still in command.\nSecond Boer War\nThe Cavalry Division was re-raised for service during the Second Boer War.\nFirst World War\nThe 1st Cavalry Division was one of the first divisions of the army to move to France in August 1914, they would remain on the Western Front as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) throughout the war. It participated in most of the major actions where cavalry were used as a mounted mobile force, they would also be used as dismounted troops and effectively serve as infantry.\nOn 11 November 1918, the day of the armistice with Germany, orders were received that the division would lead the advance of the Second Army of the BEF into Germany, by 6 December, having passed through Namur, the division secured the Rhine bridgehead at Cologne.\nOrder of battle in the First World War\n1st Cavalry Brigade\n:2nd Dragoon Guards\n:5th Dragoon Guards\n:11th Hussars\n:1st Signal Troop, Royal Engineers\n:1st Cavalry Brigade Machine Gun Squadron (from February 1916)\n2nd Cavalry Brigade\n:4th Dragoon Guards\n:9th Lancers\n:18th Hussars\n:2nd Signal Troop, Royal Engineers\n:2nd Cavalry Brigade Machine Gun Squadron (from 28 February 1916)\n9th Cavalry Brigade\n9th Cavalry Brigade was formed in France on 14 April 1915 with the 15th Hussars and the 19th Hussars.

It was assigned to Northern Command, and took command of two pre-war First Line Territorial Army cavalry brigades (the 5th and 6th) and the newly formed 4th Cavalry Brigade. It was the only cavalry division in the British Army during the war.\nIt departed the United Kingdom in January 1940, transited across France, and arrived in Palestine on 31 January 1940. It served as a garrison force under British Forces, Palestine and Trans-Jordan.\nIn May 1941, the Divisional Headquarters and elements of the division (notably the 4th Cavalry Brigade), together with a battalion of infantry from the Essex Regiment (the 1st Battalion), a mechanised regiment from the Arab Legion and supporting artillery was reorganised as Habforce for operations in Iraq including the relief of the base at RAF Habbaniya and the occupation of Baghdad. Following this, in July 1941, Habforce was placed under the command of Australian I Corps and was involved in operations against the Vichy French in Syria, advancing from eastern Iraq near the Trans-Jordan border to capture Palmyra and secure the Haditha - Tripoli oil pipeline.\nOn 1 August 1941, the 1st Cavalry Division was converted into the 10th Armoured Division. and 6th Cavalry Brigade into 8th Armoured Brigade}} 10th Armoured Division later fought at the Battles of Alam Halfa and El Alamein.
