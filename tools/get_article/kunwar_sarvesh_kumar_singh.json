His son Kunwar Sushant Singh is currently BJP MLA from Barhapur.\nPolitical life\nHis father, Ram Pal Singh was three term MLA from Thakurdwara and one term MP from Amroha. In 1991, he won his ancestral seat of Thakurdwara as the BJP candidate and remained until 2007 when Vijay Yadav from BSP won Thakurdwara.

He owned many colleges, schools and farms and orchards in  Thakurdwara, Kashipur and Moradabad through his father's trust (Babu Rampal Singh Trust).\nKanth violence incident, 2014\nAfter parliamentary elections in 2014, though he won the Lok Sabha constituency by a difference of 87,504 he entered lost from his own ruling Thakurdwara Vidhan Sabha Seat by difference of 475 votes. Kanth, another nearby Vidhan Sabha seat an incident pertains to the removal of a loudspeaker from the Sant Ravidas temple in Akbarpur Chaderi in Kanth. The temple attracts a large number of Dalit devotees and the loudspeaker, according to locals, had been there for several years. In early June, however, people of the Muslim community had in a written representation demanded that it be removed. The administration did not try to solve the dispute by involving elders of the two communities, and instead on Thursday, 26 June, a police team broke open the lock on its gate, entered into the temple and removed the loudspeaker. According to eyewitnesses, the policemen thrashed men and women who protested, and later arrested about a dozen people including women. The next day (Friday 27 June) a demonstration was held in main Kanth market and the crowd blocked the Moradabad-Hardwar road. The crowd was demanding that the loudspeaker be reinstalled and the arrested people be released. Amid the inaction of the police and administration, some people announced that they would install the loudspeaker themselves, and then the police cracked down on them. In the ensuing fracas several were injured. It is reported that the police went berserk after this, dragged people out of their homes and arrested them. It is said that after 26 June, district and police officials tried to win over a section of the BJP leaders and even the Moradabad MP Kunwar Sarvesh Kumar Singh, to come up with a compromise. However, as this news spread and the hardline Hindu Jagaran Manch took the matter into its own hands. The BJP then jumped into the fray and called for a mahapanchayat on this issue on 4 July. Moradabad MP Kunwar Sarvesh Kumar Singh, Amroha MP Kunwar Singh Tanwar, Sambhal MP Satyapal Saini, Rampur MP Nepal Singh, MLA Sangeet Som and their supporters were briefly detained when they were arriving for the mahapanchayat. Sangeet Som is also an accused in the Muzaffarangar Riots. Moradabad district magistrate Chandrakant was seriously injured Friday when a mob threw stones at policemen after the BJP leaders' arrest. The official was sent to hospital for a serious head and eye injury. BJP supporters fought at Kanth as police carried out lathi charge, lobbed teargas shells and shot blanks in the air to disperse the crowds which had stopped some trains. The district administration was more intent on stopping the mahapanchayat rather than solving the issue, he said. The state BJP has constituted a four-member team that will look into the incident and submit a report to the party leadership. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of Moradabad, Dharamvir Yadav, in an uncharacteristically political statement, on Saturday blamed the BJP for the tense situation in Kanth, and said that BJP MP Kunwar Sarvesh Kumar Singh had wanted to \"polarise the situation ahead of the by-elections to be held in the state.\" He said the BJP's mahapanchayat call had only added to the already volatile situation.\nPersonal life and death\nSingh was born on 22 December 1952 to Raja Rampal Singh.
