It participated in the NCAA's Division III as an ice hockey-only conference and included only women's teams.\nThe formation of the conference was originally announced in late 2014 under the ECAC umbrella, with the conference to be known as the ECAC North Atlantic. The eight founding institutions all had either independent or newly formed women's hockey teams, so no teams had to switch conferences to join the ECAC-NA. In 2015, however, just before the conference's first season commenced, the members announced that the conference would be renamed the Colonial Hockey Conference, dropping the ECAC affiliation. The conference lasted until the 2019-20 season, when the Commonwealth Coast Conference, now known as the Conference of New England, took over operations. At that time, all of the remaining members of the CHC were full members of the CCC.\nFinal Members\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Institution !! Location !! Nickname !! Founded !!
