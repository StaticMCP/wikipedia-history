The Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, won the most seats, but Labour, led by Ramsay MacDonald, and H. H. Asquith's reunited Liberal Party gained enough seats to produce a hung parliament. It is the most recent UK general election in which a third party won over 100 seats (158 for the Liberals) and the most narrow gap (100 seats) between the first and third parties since. The Liberals' percentage of the vote, 28.8%, trailed Labour's by only one percentage point and has not been exceeded by a third party at any general election since.\nMacDonald formed the first Labour government with tacit support from the Liberals. Rather than trying to bring the Liberals back into government, Asquith's motivation for permitting Labour to enter power was that he hoped they would prove to be incompetent and quickly lose support. Being a minority, MacDonald's government only lasted ten months, and another general election was held in October 1924.\nOverview\nIn May 1923, Prime Minister Bonar Law fell ill and resigned on 22 May, after just 209 days in office. He was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stanley Baldwin. The Labour Party had also changed leaders since the previous election, after J. R. Clynes was defeated in a leadership challenge by former leader Ramsay MacDonald.\nHaving won an election just the year before, Baldwin's Conservative Party had a comfortable majority in the House of Commons and could have waited another four years, but the government was concerned and the Conservatives were divided. Baldwin felt the need to receive a mandate from the people, which, if successful, would strengthen his grip on the Conservative Party leadership and allow him to introduce tariff reform and imperial preference as protectionist trade policies over the objections of the free trade elements of his party.\nOxford historian and Conservative MP John Marriott depicts the gloomy national mood:\n}}\nParliament was dissolved on 16 November and the result backfired on Baldwin, who lost a host of seats to Labour and the Liberals, resulting in a hung parliament. A reformation of the Conservative-Liberal coalition which had governed the country from 1918 to 1922 was not practical, as Baldwin had alienated both of the two most prominent Liberals, Asquith and David Lloyd George.\nAftermath\nFaced with the decision of whether to support a minority Conservative or Labour government on an issue-by-issue basis, Asquith ultimately chose to support the Labour government. This decision was influenced by Lloyd George's faction, which was strongly opposed to collaborating with Baldwin, and the belief amongst the Liberals as a whole that Labour's electoral success was largely due to the previous split within the Liberal Party. Asquith anticipated that a Labour government would reveal Labour's policies as impractical, thereby enabling the Liberals to surpass them in the subsequent election. Consequently, the Liberals joined forces with Labour to defeat Baldwin's King's Speech, leading to the fall of his government and allowing Labour to form its first government.\nResults\n|candidates = 10\n|seats      = 6\n|gain       = 2\n|loss       =\n|net        = +2\n|votes      = 107,792\n|votes %    = 0.8\n|seats %    = 1.0\n|plus/minus = -0.1\n}}\n|}\n}}\nVotes summary\n|38.01}}\n|30.68}}\n|29.69}}\n}}\nSeats summary\n|41.95}}\n|31.06}}\n|25.69}}\n}}\nConstituency results\nTransfers of seats\n* All comparisons are with the 1922 election.\n**In some cases the change is due to the MP defecting to the gaining party.
