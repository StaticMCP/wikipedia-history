Dot is probably the most notable smoker on British television as she rarely appears on-screen without a cigarette. The character is so synonymous with smoking that the term \"Dot Cotton syndrome\" is used within the health industry to: \"describe the elderly population who continue to smoke heavily without registering the health problems they are or will soon suffer from, seeing it as their only pleasure left in life\".\nChris Moyles' Difficult Second Book contains a chapter called \"There Is No Carry On in EastEnders\", referring to many things that cannot exist in the EastEnders fictional world, due to actors appearing in both TV shows, including Spandau Ballet (Martin Kemp), Carry On (Barbara Windsor), Grange Hill (Todd Carty and Susan Tully), Hotel Babylon and Red Cap (Tamzin Outhwaite), Jonny Briggs and Star Wars (Leslie Schofield), Lovejoy and Only Fools and Horses (John Bardon), Bergerac, Inspector Morse and Minder (Perry Fenwick), The Sweeney and Eldorado (Derek Martin), Are You Being Served? and ''Dad's Army (Wendy Richard), \"Parklife\" and Quadrophenia (Phil Daniels) and A Touch of Frost (Kyte).\nThe comic book League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' vol 1 #6 included characters named Mitchell and Watts (described as a \"dirty denizen of the East End\") in the Artful Dodger's gang in the late 19th century.\nOn April Fools' Day 2019, TheJournal.ie published a report on Prime Minister Theresa May's scheduled appearance on that night's special live episode of EastEnders, details of which had been leaked by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar overnight. May's purpose was to issue a final plea for unity as Brexit entered a critical stage. The internet publication featured a photograph of May in The Queen Victoria pub, with the caption \"Rehearsal shot of hostile locals witnessing May's arrival\". It even went so far as to compose fake documents to back up its claim, including a draft script said to have been provided by the BBC to highlight the ever-changing difficulties of keeping up with political events as they rapidly unfolded: \"'This is the 416th draft' the source said. 'And her appearance was only confirmed at the start of March. Brexit won't stop f*****g, c*****g changing every two seconds. It's driving the actors mad.'\" A short video clip shows actor Adam Woodyatt (who portrays the character of Ian Beale) being comforted by colleague Steve McFadden (who portrays the character Phil Mitchell), as Woodyatt bursts into tears due to the protracted rehearsals.\nThe preliminary script – which, TheJournal.ie reminded readers, was \"contingent on what the hell happens in Brexit over the course of today\" — had Dot Cotton (played by June Brown) gasping as Theresa May enters the pub. May, having begun her speech, is interrupted by Mick Carter (played by Danny Dyer) who knocks over a pint and a chair in his efforts to have the Prime Minister leave the pub. May departs and perches herself despondently on a park bench, whereupon Kat Slater (played by Jessie Wallace) approaches her with \"Alright love? What's getting you down?\" May tells Slater she has already blamed everyone – the Irish, the Democratic Unionist Party, the European Union — and is at a loss for who is left for her to find fault with now. Slater advises her to be honest. May finds solace in this, thanks Slater, remarks on the chilliness of the night and Slater hands the Prime Minister her leopard print jacket to put on. May returns to the pub and seemingly converts all the customers bar Dot Cotton, who is promptly ejected onto the street.\nReferences"
