General Drastamat Kanayan acknowledged this, and on 16 December began a surprise attack on the town during the night, the Armenians were able to catch the Georgians off guard whilst most of their troops were sleeping which allowed them to storm into the town from numerous positions. The Armenians used grenades to blow up the bridges which prevented the Georgians from escaping as this resulted in an devastation of the entire Georgian garrison in Ayrum, as five hundred Georgians which was their entire Ayrum garrison was either killed or taken prisoner.\nReferences"
