The unit was activated on 3 August 2019. It was previously activated in May 1992 as the 4th Space Communications Squadron, when it took over the mission and personnel of the 4th Satellite Communications Squadron, before being inactivated in March 1996. The squadron's primary mission is to provide mobile Defense Support Program support in case of hostilities.\nMission\nThe squadron provided worldwide missile warning, space launch and detection in the event of an attack against the United States.\nHistory\nThe 4th Space Warning Squadron  was activated on 15 May 1992, when it took over the mobile Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite mission which had been performed since 1983 at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico by the 1025th Satellite Communications Squadron, Mobile and the 4th Satellite Communications Squadron, Mobile.\nThe squadron employed the Air Force's only strategic survivable, mobile ground system to receive early warning missile attack data. The 4th provided survivable and endurable missile warning detection to the National Command Authority and had the ability to survive and operate through all phases of trans/post attack. Unlike fixed units, the 4th was designed to be mobile, and could deploy to any location in the world. In addition, the DSP satellites provided immediate, worldwide missile warning, space launch, and nuclear detonation detection.\nThe squadron mission was transferred to the 137th Space Warning Squadron of the Colorado Air National Guard in Greeley, Colorado in fall 1997.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 4th Space Communications Squadron on 1 May 1992\n: Activated on 15 May 1992\n: Redesignated 4th Space Warning Squadron on 16 October 1992\n: Inactivated c. 30 September 1997\n: Activated on 3 August 2019\nAssignments\n*310th Space Wing, 3 August 2019 - present\n*21st Space Wing, 15 May 1992 – c. 30 September 1997\nStations\n* Buckley Space Force Base, Colorado, 3 August 2019 - present\n* Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, 15 May 1992 – c. 30 September 1997\nCommanders\n*Lt Col Donald P.
