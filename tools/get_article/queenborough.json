It grew as a port near the Thames Estuary at the westward entrance to the Swale where it joins the River Medway. It is in the Sittingbourne and Sheppey parliamentary constituency.\nQueenborough Harbour offers moorings between the Thames and Medway. It is possible to land at Queenborough on any tide and there are boat builders and chandlers in the marina. Admiral Lord Nelson is reputed to have learned many of his seafaring skills in these waters, and also shared a house near the small harbour with his mistress, Lady Hamilton.\nQueenborough today still reflects something of its original 18th-century seafaring history, from which period most of its more prominent buildings survive. The church is the sole surviving feature from the medieval period. The town was first represented by two members of parliament in 1572.\nHistory\nSaxon\nIn Saxon times, the settlement on the site was known as Cyningburh, \"king's borough\".\nThe name Queenborough derives from the Old English cwēnburh and literally means the 'Queen's borough'. The town is named after Queen Philippa, the wife of King Edward III.\nMedieval and Tudor\nA fortress, called Sheppey Castle or Queenborough Castle, was built to guard the passage of ships along the Swale upon the command of King Edward III between 1361 and 1377, during the Hundred Years' War with France. It was built on the site of a much earlier, but smaller castle. Its unusual design – round and symmetrical – was described by historians Howard Colvin and R. Allen Brown as \"exemplifying the principles of cylindrical and concentric fortification carried to their logical conclusion with perfect symmetry\". They also suggest that the design, which bore similarities to Henry VIII's Device Forts of the 16th century, may have been designed to defend against and to make best use of gunpowder artillery. Queenborough was the only true concentric castle built in England. It regained importance in the 16th century under Thomas Cheney, when it is thought to have influenced the construction of nearby Deal Castle and Walmer Castle.\nIn those days north Kent was divided by open waters and marshes stretching inland. The safest navigation to the open sea was then the route from the Thames into the Yantlet Creek (separating the Isle of Grain from the rest of Hoo Peninsula), and thus into the Swale from the Medway estuary, around the leeward side of the Isle of Sheppey into the Wantsum Channel, navigating past the Isle of Thanet to Sandwich and only then into the open waters of the English Channel.  It was thus an easily defensible planned-town centre for the wool trade.\nKing Edward III had the town renamed after his Queen, Philippa of Hainault, and conferred upon it the rights of a free borough, with a governing body of a mayor and two bailiffs. He granted Queenborough a charter in 1366 and two years later bestowed the duties of a royal borough upon it.\nDuring this period, Queenborough, on the Isle of Sheppey, was an important town for the export of wool, a significant crown revenue. In 1368, the Wool Staple was transferred from Canterbury to Queenborough: Sandwich and Queenborough became the two centres in Kent for wool trading.\nThe castle was excavated in 2005 by Channel 4's archaeology television programme Time Team.\nThe town was first represented by two members of parliament in 1572, one of its earlier MPs being the explorer Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1580. Matthias Falconer of Brabant established the first copperas (iron II sulphate) factory in England at Queenborough in 1579.\n17th century\nKing Charles I had the town reincorporated under the title of the \"mayor, jurats, bailiffs and burgesses of Queenborough\", during which time the population was chiefly employed in the local oyster fishery. However the fort having protected the Swale and Medway estuaries for 300&nbsp;years was never in fact to realise its function as a garrison, and recorded no active military history. After being seized by Parliamentarians in 1650, after the Civil War, and being considered unsuitable for repair, being of  \"no practical use\" it was demolished during the interregnum.\nNot long after this, in 1667, the Dutch captured the new Sheerness fort (then under construction) and invaded Queenborough. The occupation lasted only a few days; though the Dutch caused widespread panic, they were unable to maintain their offensive, and withdrew having captured  and burnt numerous other ships in the Thames and Medway. Following this raid on the Medway, much-needed attention was given to the improvement of the naval defences of the Medway, which at length helped strengthen the economy of Queenborough and Sheppey. Some 300&nbsp;years later, in 1967, The Queenborough and Brielle (the Netherlands) twinning project was established.\nWork began on overhauling the parish church in 1690.\n18th century\nView of Queenborough .\nThe parish church overhaul continued through to 1730, and a number of houses added to the growing town during the 18th century. With the general prosperity of the colonial and mercantile trades of the age, Queenborough thrived. Queenborough Guildhall was completed in 1793.\nWith the silting up of the Yantlet creek and the Wantsum channel and improved navigation through the Thames estuary to London, Queenborough began to lose its importance, becoming something of a backwater. Daniel Defoe described it as \"a miserable and dirty fishing town (with) the chief traders ... alehouse keepers and oyster catchers\".\nThe Royal Navy eventually became less prominent on the River Medway as other dockyards developed and ships grew in size, so that they were largely replaced by prison hulks which would frequently dispose of their dead charges on a salt marsh at the mouth of the Swale, which was subsequently to become known as Dead Man's Island, and can still be found as such, on local maps today. The new fort and harbour developments completed at Sheerness by this time further replaced Queenborough by being better positioned at the mouth of the Medway.\n19th century to date\nRecords from between 1815 and 1820 show that the Corporation of Queenborough was in some financial difficulties, owing some £14,500 that it could not hope to pay. It appears that the mayor and other officials had been less than honest in their duties toward the community, with the use of the public money at their disposal. This fraud caused a great financial burden upon the fishers and oyster catchers, who were driven to \"unlawful and riotous assembly\", in protest against unwarranted charges made upon them in the course of their trade. So serious had this deterioration in conditions become, that by the middle of the 19th century the corporation was bankrupt. A leading figure was Thomas Young Greet, who frequently held the office of mayor, and treasurer, and first came to Queenborough in 1814. He and his friends used their positions to cream off the profits of the fisheries. Parliament was called upon to act, vesting by an act of Parliament much of the town's business in the hands of trustees who were able to refinance the economy by selling land, property and the ancient oyster fishery. The oyster trade having been corrupted by smuggling and the bribery of the island's members of parliament, the town lost its franchise in the Reform Act 1832.\nThe economy of Queenborough was boosted significantly by the establishment of a branch line from Sittingbourne by the Sittingbourne and Sheerness Railway (later part of the London, Chatham & Dover Railway), which operated in conjunction with a mail and passenger service by steamer to Vlissingen in the Netherlands. The Swale was bridged when the railway was built in 1860.\nFrom the town's depression in the 1850s there began a process of recovery. New industries came to Queenborough including a glass works and a company engaged in coal washing. Besides these many other small industries developed, including potteries, the  Fertilizer company (which used the old spelling of Sheppey) and the glue works. The Portland cement works opened in 1890, and there is still a considerable trade in timber.\nA borough charter granted in 1885 gave some renewed impetus to the struggling borough council, but it was not until 1937 that the Charity Commissioners were at last able to appoint a borough council, but the town and its fisheries never fully recovered. The present trustees are Swale Borough Council, which incorporated the old borough council in the local government reorganisation of 1974. Queenborough now has a town council, which includes a mayor.\nUnsightly modern sea wall defences have hindered the character of the beaches but were deemed necessary; a large yachting harbour exists, where the pirate radio ship Radio Caroline (in the river Medway 2003–04) anchored for a while. Tourism is today a major feature of the island, with Queenborough enjoying some of the fruits of local investment.\nGovernment\n]]\nQueenborough is in the parliamentary constituency of Sittingbourne and Sheppey. As of July 2024, the constituency's member of parliament is Kevin McKenna of the Labour Party.\nQueenborough is within the Swale local government district and its electoral ward of Queenborough and Halfway. This ward has three of the forty seven seats on Swale Borough Council. As of the 2019 local elections, all three seats are held by the Conservative Party.\nQueenborough continues the traditions of having a town council and a mayor. The town council is made up of eleven elected members, seven from Queenborough and four from Rushenden. The current mayor is Councillor Richard Darby.\nDemography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Queenborough in the 2001 census\n|-\n! !!Queenborough!!Borough of Swale!!England\n|-\n|Total population||3,471||122,801||49,138,831\n|-\n|Foreign born||2.8%||3.6%||9.2%\n|-\n|White||99%||98%||91%\n|-\n|Asian||0.4%||0.7%||4.6%\n|-\n|Black||0.3%||0.3%||2.3%\n|-\n|Christian||78%||76%||72%\n|-\n|Muslim||0.1%||0.4%||3.1%\n|-\n|No religion||15%||15%||15%\n|-\n|Over 65&nbsp;years old||13%||16%||16%\n|-\n|Bachelor's degree or higher||7%||12%||20%\n|}\nAt the 2001 UK census, the parish of Queenborough had a population of 3,471.\nFor every 100 females, there were 94.5 males.
