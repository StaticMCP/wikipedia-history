The first of which was during the Atlanta campaign, the second was during Hood's Tennessee Campaign. The battles were fought in Tilton, Georgia, in Whitfield County, located a few miles south of Dalton, Georgia, near the Conasauga River.\nThe First Battle of Tilton was a skirmish on May 13, 1864. The Confederate side was led by Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler.\nThe Second Battle of Tilton occurred on October 13, 1864, when soldiers of Maj. Gen. Samuel G. French's Division of Lt. Gen. Stewart's Corps of the Confederate Army of Tennessee besieged a military garrison of 300 soldiers of the 17th Iowa Infantry Regiment commanded by Lt. Col. Simpson M. Archer. The blockhouse had been constructed a few months prior to the battle, to guard the Western and Atlantic Railroad. Commanded by Archer, the 17th Iowa Regiment barricaded themselves in the blockhouse and surrendered upon exhausting their ammunition supply.\nA future member of the Iowa General Assembly, Pvt. William Graham Buck, was among those captured at the battle. Union prisoners captured at the battle were sent to Camp Lawton or Camp Sumter in Andersonville.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.dailycitizen.news/news/civil-war-anniversary-capture-of-the-tilton-block-house/article_41fa1606-9ec3-11e4-ab52-5f41c8cdfa0a.html Civil War anniversary: Capture of the Tilton Block House]"
