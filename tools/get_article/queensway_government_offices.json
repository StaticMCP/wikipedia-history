The roof of the Queensway Government Office Building is adorned with a dragon logo, the symbol of Hong Kong; the structure was added in 2002.\nHistory\nThe site of the office building was part of the larger Victoria Barracks site, which was transferred from the British Forces to the Hong Kong Government for redevelopment. The Victoria Barracks Planning Committee proposed building a \"large secretariat building\" in the vicinity of Flagstaff House, but the government instead decided to build a courthouse and the government office building on Queensway.\nContracts to construct the building were signed on 1 August 1983 by Gammon, the contractor, and the government.\nAgencies\n* 1/F - 9/F – Department of Justice\n* 12/F - 15/F – Companies Registry\n* 24/F - 27/F – Legal Aid Department\n* 28/F – Land Registry\n* 36/F – Architectural Services Department\n* 42/F - 45/F – Food and Environmental Hygiene Department\nFormer agencies:\n* Civil Aviation Department (CAD) (46/F) – now located at Hong Kong International Airport\nSee also\n*List of tallest buildings in Hong Kong\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
