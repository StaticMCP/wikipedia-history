His dissertation on the Nahua polity of Tlaxcala (published in 1952 as Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century), a key ally of the Spaniards in the conquest of Mexico, was the first major study of conquest and the early colonial era Nahuas from the indigenous perspective. It remains a model for scholars working on Mesoamerican ethnohistory.\nHe also contributed to the creation of important bibliographic guides to works in Mexican history, such as the Handbook of Latin American Studies and Mesoamerican ethnohistory as well as an index to the journal Hispanic American Historical Review. The culmination of his work on colonial-era Nahuas is The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519–1810 (1964), which \"reordered the research priorities for a generation of colonial historians.\"\nWorks\n*Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century, New Haven: Yale University Press 1952.\n*The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519–1810.
