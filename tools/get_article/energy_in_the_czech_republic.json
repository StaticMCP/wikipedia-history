The Ingolstadt–Kralupy–Litvínov pipeline can bring crude oil from Germany and be connected to the Transalpine Pipeline.\nThe Country has two refineries, owned by Česká rafinérská. The Litvinov refinery needs to be modified to process non-Russian grade oil.\nThe Gazela Pipeline allowed gas to be supplied from other countries by connecting through Germany at Brandov or Rozvadov or through Slovakia via Lanžhot.\nGas usage: 2020 8.8 Bcm, 2021 9.4 Bcm, 2022 7.8 Bcm, 2023 7.1 Bcm.\nIn April 2025 it was reported that the Czech Republic has achieved full independence from Russian oil supplies for the first time in its history, ending over 60 years of reliance. This milestone was made possible by the completion of capacity upgrades to the Transalpine (TAL) pipeline, which transports oil from Italy through Germany to the Czech Republic. The enhanced TAL pipeline now delivers 8 million tonnes of oil annually, sufficient to meet the country's entire demand. Prime Minister Petr Fiala announced the development at the central oil depot in Nelahozeves, emphasizing that the Czech Republic is now fully supplied by non-Russian oil through western routes. Previously, the country received about half of its oil imports via the Druzhba pipeline from Russia. The state-owned pipeline operator MERO completed the TAL expansion at the end of 2024, enabling this significant shift in energy sourcing.\nElectricity\nIn 2022 Electricity production was 78.8 terawatt-hours (TWh), whilst consumption was 60.4 TWh.\n53.60% was generated from fossil fuels, mostly lignite, 40.95% nuclear and 5.46% renewables.\nEnvironment\nIn 2014, the emissions of carbon dioxide were 10.4 tons per capita. The EU average was 7.9 tons per capita. Czech Republic's emissions were comparable to those of Japan or the Netherlands.\nRenewable energy\nIn 2023, the city of Brno is working to modernise its heat generation and distribution infrastructure. Teplárny Brno received a €75 million loan from the European Investment Bank for this modernization. The initiative aims at lowering the country's reliance on oil imports, and consists of a wood chip-fuelled heat and power biomass unit.\nBusiness\nAccording to Forbes list of billionaires (2011) Czech billionaire Zdenek Bakala ($2 B 2011) has made his wealth in coal business. Forbes ranked Zdenek Bakala (Net Worth$1.5 B) as richest Czech in energy business (coal) in 2013.\nBakala is the biggest player on the coal market in Central Europe. He has consolidated Polish mining markets into his company New World Resources.\nOverview\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | Energy in Czech Republic\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" |\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | Capita\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | Prim. energy\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | Production\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | Export\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | Electricity\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | CO2-emission\n|-----\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" |\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | Million\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | TWh\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | TWh\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | TWh\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | TWh\n! style=\"background-color: #cfb;\" | Mt\n|-----\n| align=\"left\" | 2004 || align=\"right\"| 10.2 || align=\"right\" | 530  || align=\"right\" | 398 || align=\"right\" | 136  || align=\"right\" | 63.5 || align=\"right\" | 118.8\n|-----\n| align=\"left\" | 2007 || align=\"right\"| 10.3 || align=\"right\" | 532 || align=\"right\" | 392 || align=\"right\" | 134 || align=\"right\" | 67.1 || align=\"right\" | 122.1\n|-----\n| align=\"left\" | 2008 || align=\"right\"| 10.4  || align=\"right\" | 519 || align=\"right\" | 382 || align=\"right\" | 144|| align=\"right\" | 67.4 || align=\"right\" | 116.8\n|-----\n| align=\"left\" | 2009 || align=\"right\"| 10.5 || align=\"right\" | 488 || align=\"right\" | 363 || align=\"right\" | 132 || align=\"right\" | 64.1 || align=\"right\" | 109.8\n|-----\n| align=\"left\" | 2012 || align=\"right\"| 10.5 || align=\"right\" | 505 || align=\"right\" | 373 || align=\"right\" | 140 || align=\"right\" | 66.0 || align=\"right\" | 112.7\n|-----\n| align=\"left\" | 2012R || align=\"right\"| 10.5 || align=\"right\" | 496 || align=\"right\" |380 || align=\"right\" | 126  || align=\"right\" | 66.3 || align=\"right\" | 107.8\n|-----\n| align=\"left\" | 2013 || align=\"right\"|  10.5  || align=\"right\" | 488 || align=\"right\" | 351 || align=\"right\" |  137 || align=\"right\" | 66.1 || align=\"right\" | 101.1\n|-----\n| align=\"left\" | Change 2004-09 || align=\"right\"| 2.9% || align=\"right\" | -7.8% || align=\"right\" | -8.9% || align=\"right\" | -2.8% || align=\"right\" | 0.9% || align=\"right\" | -7.5%\n|-----\n| align=\"left\" colspan=7 |  Mtoe = 11.63 TWh, Prim. energy includes energy losses that are 2/3 for nuclear power\n2012R = CO2 calculation criteria changed, numbers updated\n|}\nPrimary energy consumption per million people in 2008 was 50 TWh compared to other countries (TWh): Canada 93 (3103 TWh 33.3), USA 87 (26,560 TWh 304.5), UK 40 (2,424 TWh 61.4), Greece 31 TWh (354 TWh 11.24) and Poland 30 (1138 TWh 38.12).\nSee also\n* Energy law\nReferences\nExternal links"
