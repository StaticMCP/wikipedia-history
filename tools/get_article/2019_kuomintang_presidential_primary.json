On 26 November 2018, former Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidential Office and incumbent Taipei City Councillor Lo Chih-chiang became the first candidate who announced his candidacy on Facebook. He later withdrew his candidacy on 7 April 2019.\nOn 25 December 2018, former Kuomintang chairman and 2016 presidential candidate Eric Chu announced that he would run in the 2020 presidential race when he stepped down on 25 December 2018 as Mayor of New Taipei City, becoming the first big-name politician to throw his hat in the ring. It was followed by National Taiwan University professor Chang Ya-chung who announced his candidacy on 7 January 2019.\nIn the December 2018 mayoral elections, the KMT received a massive victory by capturing 15 of 22 municipalities and counties, with former legislator Han Kuo-yu elected as Mayor of Kaohsiung, the deep-green Democratic Progressive Party-held city for the past two decades. The sensations created by Han during the campaign sparked speculations whether he would become the presidential candidate for KMT in 2020. The richest man in Taiwan and the founder and chairman of electronic company Foxconn Terry Gou was also reported to be interested in running in the election as a pan-Blue candidate.\nOn 27 February, the party passed a resolution decided its primary to be based on a 70-30 weighing of public opinion polls and party member votes, although it has not ruled out the possibility of drafting the strongest candidate in an all-out effort to win back power, which was seen to be reserved Han Kuo-yu, the party's best performing candidate in the polls. On 7 March, Wan Jyng-ping announced his candidacy.\nControversies over the primary method continued, as party chairman Wu Den-yih proposed to only allow KMT members to decide the party's presidential candidate which drew criticism, with some questioning whether he aimed to rig the game for himself. Wu later declined to run on 11 April.\nGou runs\nTerry Gou announced his presidential bid by joining the KMT presidential primary on 17 April, citing sea goddess Matsu instructing him to come out and do good for the suffering of the people, and bring peace and prosperity to Taiwan in his dream. As his party membership was frozen after he had not paid the annual fee so a long time, Wu restored Guo's KMT membership by awarding him an honorary member certificate in order to enable him to run in the primary. Guo also stated that he would not accept to be drafted to run.\nHan Kuo-yu, Gou's potential rival, announced on 23 April that he was \"willing to take responsibility\" for the development of Taiwan but was \"unable\" to participate in the party's primary in its current form. He expressed his disapproval of the \"closed-door negotiations\" within the party and called for reform. Han's announcement sparked internal strife between Han supporters and the party authorities. In order to settle the differences, the party adopted a resolution to put in place special guidelines to include all its presidential hopefuls, including Han, in its primary on the next day, and also switch the primary method from 70 to 30 weighing of public opinion polls and party member votes to fully being determined by opinion polls.\nCandidates\nDeclared candidates\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Name\n!Born\n!Current or previous positions\n!Announced\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|-\n| Eric Chu\n|  (age )Taoyuan County, Taiwan\n| Mayor of New Taipei (2016–2018; 2012–2015)\n|\n|\n|-\n| Chang Ya-chung\n|  (age )Taichung City, Taiwan\n| Professor of the National Taiwan University\n|\n|\n|-\n| Chou Hsi-wei\n|  (age )Changhua County, Taiwan\n| Magistrate of Taipei County (2005–2010)\n|\n|\n|-\n| Terry Gou\n|  (age )Taipei County, Taiwan\n| Founder and Chairman of Foxconn\n|\n|\n|-\n| Han Kuo-yu\n|  (age )Taipei County, Taiwan\n| Mayor of Kaohsiung (2018–present)\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nWithdrawn candidates\nThe candidates in this section have withdrawn or suspended their campaigns.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The nationwide opinion poll would be held from 5 to 15 July and the results would be released the next day. After that, the results will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee on 17 July for approval.
