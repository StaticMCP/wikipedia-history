It was designed by Philip A. Robson in the Renaissance style, built by J. Garrett and Son in red brick and was opened as St. Gabriel's Church Training College for women teachers in 1900.\nDuring the First World War, the building was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 1st London General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. After the war it became the Kennington Girls School and later became Charles Edward Brooke Girls' School, named after the \"well-known Anglo-Catholic figure\" and Vicar of St John the Divine, Kennington who had funded the College chapel, which was dedicated in 1903. From 2006 to 2008 it hosted the Charles Edward Brooke Refugee Centre.\nAfter the school closed in 2012, the building fell vacant and was placed on the Heritage at Risk Register. The former chapel was marketed as a home in 2023 for an asking price of £2.95 million.\nReferences"
