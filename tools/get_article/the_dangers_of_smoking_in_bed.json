The collection was first published in Argentina in November 2009. The book was translated to English in 2021 by Megan McDowell.\nThis book has been critically acclaimed and was shortlisted for the 2021 International Booker Prize.\nBackground\nMariana Enriquez, born in 1973, is an Argentine writer and journalist located in Buenos Aires. She is currently the deputy editor of the arts and culture section of Pagina 12. Her published works also include Bajar es lo peor (1995), Cómo desaparacer completamente (2004), Chicos que vuelven (2010), Las cosas que perdimos en el fuego (2016), and Nuestra parte de noche (2019). Her work has been translated into German and English and published around the globe.\nHer literature is rooted in Latin America urban areas, a realistic setting she pulls from her own life. She twists Latin American mythologies, local urban legends and crimes, pagan saints, and local issues in order to integrate culture into her horror stories. Enriquez credits a technique of blurring the realistic and fantastic for the sinister nature of her writing.\nSynopsis of each story\nAngelita Unearthed\nA girl discovers small bones in her backyard, and her grandmother claims they are the bones of Angelita, the grandmother's sister who died as a baby.

One day, the girl takes Angelita to the house where her bones were displaced in order to make peace with her.\nOur Lady of the Quarry\nA group of friends hangs out at a quarry pool every weekend.

Natalia leads the other girls to the bus stop as Silvia's and Diego's screams are heard in the distance.\nThe Cart\nOne afternoon, a very drunk man stumbles into a neighborhood with a cart full of stuff. He terrorizes the neighborhood, and irate neighbors chase the man off. His rotting cart is left behind, and two weeks later, the neighborhood begins to deteriorate.

One day, Mechi finds one of the missing children, who was supposedly seen dead in a video, sitting in a park.

All of the children gather into abandoned houses, and Mechi visits them hoping to get some answers.\nThe Dangers of Smoking in Bed\nPaula wakes up to the smell of smoke outside and discovers that an apartment had caught on fire, killing a woman who had fallen asleep smoking a cigarette. Paula goes back to bed, but she can't sleep. She makes a tent with her covers, puts a lamp under the tent, and criticizes her aging body and the defects that now litter her skin. \"Her body is failing her in more ways that she didn't want to think about.\" She burns holes in the sheets with a cigarette. When she looks at her ceiling from outside the tent, it looks like it's covered with stars, and she admires them.\nBack When We Talked to the Dead\nA group of girls' attempts to use a Ouija board are always unsuccessful, and a spirit tells them that one of the girls doesn't belong.
