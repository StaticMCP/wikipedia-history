Developed by the Government of Canada, the software is multilingual, and includes links to wind energy resource maps.\nThe Wind Data Generator (WDG) is a Wind Energy Software tool capable of running WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model to create a wind atlas and to generate wind data at resolutions of 3&nbsp;km to 10&nbsp;km.\nTurbine design\nSoftware helps design wind turbines. There are several aero-elastic packages that are used in this design process.\nFOCUS6 aids in the design of wind turbines and turbine components such as rotor blades. It was developed by Knowledge Centre Wind turbine Materials and Constructions (WMC) and Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN).\nThe National Wind Technology Center (NWTC), a division of the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), has developed many packages which are used by turbine manufacturers and researchers. NWTC has developed a suite of turbine design and performance prediction codes which rely on Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory. WTPerf uses steady BEM theory to model turbine performance. FAST is a comprehensive aero-elastic simulator which uses unsteady BEM theory to model a turbine as a collection of rigid and flexible bodies in a spatiotemporal field of turbulent flow. Germanischer Lloyd found FAST suitable for \"the calculation of onshore wind turbine loads for design and certification.\" [https://www2.nrel.gov/wind/nwtc/openfast OpenFAST] is an open-source wind turbine simulation tool that was established with the FAST v8 code as its starting point in 2018.\nThe open source software QBlade developed by the wind energy research group of Hermann Föttinger Institute of TU Berlin (Chair of Fluid Dynamics) is a BEM code coupled with the airfoil simulation code XFOIL. It allows the user to develop/import airfoil shapes, simulate them and use them for the design and simulation of wind turbine blades/rotors with the use of steady state BEM theory. The software is built with the Qt framework thus it includes a graphical user interface.\nThe open source software Vortexje, developed by Baayen & Heinz GmbH in Berlin, is an unsteady 3D panel method implementation suitable for dynamic simulation of vertical and horizontal axis wind turbines.  Easily coupled with other simulation environments such as Simulink and Dymola, it is suitable for aerodynamic optimization, fluid-structure interaction problems, and unsteady control system simulation.\nAshes is a software package for analyzing aerodynamic and mechanical forces for onshore and offshore horizontal axis wind turbines. It is based on research done at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; width: 100%;\"\n|+ Turbine design engineering software\n!

[https://furow.es Furow] is a software which offers a lineal flow model and a Computational fluid dynamic model in the same software. WAsP was created at Denmark's Risø National Laboratory.  WAsP uses a potential flow model to predict how wind flows over terrain at a site. Meteodyn WT, Windie, WindSim, WindStation   and the open-source code ZephyTOOLS use computational fluid dynamics instead, which are potentially more accurate, but more computationally intensive.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; width: 100%;\"\n|+ Flow modelling software\n!

The user can usually input wind data, height and roughness contour lines (topography), turbine specifications, background maps, and define environmental restrictions. Processing this information produces the design of a wind farm that maximizes energy production while accounting for restrictions and construction issues. Packages include [https://furow.es/ Furow], Meteodyn WT, openWind, WindFarm, [https://www.dnvgl.com/services/wind-resource-assessment-software-windfarmer-analyst-3766 WindFarmer: Analyst], [https://www.windpro.com WindPRO], [http://windsim.com/ WindSim] and WindStation.  [https://proplanen.info/wakeblaster/ WakeBlaster] is a specialised CFD service for modelling the wind farm wake losses.\nFarm visualization\nWind farm visualization software graphically presents a proposed wind farm, most importantly for the purpose of obtaining building permits. The primary techniques include photomontages, zone-of-visual-impact maps and three-dimensional visualization (perspective views of the landscape often incorporating aerial photography and including turbines and other objects).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; width: 100%;\"\n|+ Farm visualization software\n!

Examples of numerical weather prediction models used for this purpose are the European HiRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model) and the GFS (Global Forecast System) from NOAA. Open-source systems like Anemos, developed through European research initiatives, provide advanced forecasting capabilities for wind power integration into energy grids, while proprietary tools such as WindCast© by WindDeep employ machine learning to enhance prediction accuracy and optimize operational efficiency.\nSee also\n* Power engineering software\nReferences"
