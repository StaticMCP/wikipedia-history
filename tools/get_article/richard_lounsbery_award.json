The award is selected by a seven-member jury representing both the French and the US Academies. The recipient receives a $75,000 prize, funding to visit a lab or research institution in the awarding country, and an invitation to give the Lounsbery Lecture in the awarding country.\nThe Lounsbery Award was established in 1979 by Vera Lounsbery in memory of her husband, Richard Lounsbery, and is funded by the Richard Lounsbery Foundation. Richard and Vera met in Paris after World War I, and the couple divided their time between Paris and New York.\nAward recipients\nSource:\n*2025 [https://www.michaelyartsev.com/ Michael M.

Bassler, for her pioneering discoveries of the universal use of chemical communication among bacteria and the elucidation of structural and regulatory mechanisms controlling bacterial assemblies.\n*2010 Gérard Karsenty, for his work on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation and the remodeling of bone.\n*2009 Cornelia I. Bargmann, for her extraordinarily inventive and successful use of molecular and classical genetics to probe the individual nerve cell basis of behavior in C. elegans.\n*2008 , for his contributions to the understanding the genetic basis of the predisposition to viral and bacterial diseases of childhood, which have important clinical implications for the diagnostic and management of infectious diseases.\n*2007 Xiaodong Wang, for his pioneering biochemical studies on apoptosis, which have elucidated a molecular pathway leading into and out of the mitochondrion and to the nucleus.\n*2006 Catherine Dulac, for her major contributions in the perception and behavioral translation of pheromones in mammals.\n*2005 John Kuriyan, for his critical role in revealing the structural mechanisms underlying processivity in DNA replication and the regulation of tyrosine kinases and their interacting target proteins.\n*2004 Brigitte Kieffer, for her pioneering work on the molecular neurobiology of opioid-controlled behaviors, the results of which have very important implications for the treatment of pain, drug abuse, and emotional disorders.\n*2003 Carol W. Greider, for her pioneering biochemical and genetic studies of telomerase, the enzyme that maintains the ends of chromosomes in eukaryotic cells.\n*2002 Denis Le Bihan, for his work on the invention and development of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of brain diffusion and perfusion. The method he developed permits in vivo mapping of nerve fiber bundles and has multiple applications in both medical pathology and cognitive science fields.\n*2001 Elaine Fuchs, for her fundamental insights into structure and function of cytoskeletal proteins and the relation of these proteins to human genetic diseases.\n*2000 Miroslav Radman, for his contribution to the discovery of the molecular mechanisms implicated in the replication and repair of DNA, in particular, the discovery of a key enzyme of the DNA repair mechanism.\n*1999 Elliot M.
