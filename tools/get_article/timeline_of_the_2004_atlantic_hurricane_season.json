It officially began on June 1, 2004, and ended on November 30, although storm activity continued into December. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipations. The timeline includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included.\nThis season had 16 tropical depressions, of which, 15 became named storms. Of these, 9 strengthened into hurricanes with 6 intensifying into major hurricanes.) or higher on the 5-level Saffir–Simpson wind speed scale are considered major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} The most noteworthy storms for the season were the five named storms that made landfall in the U.S. states of Florida and Alabama, three of them with at least 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) sustained winds (major hurricane strength): Tropical Storm Bonnie, Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. This is the only time in recorded history that four hurricanes affected the U.S. State of Florida although one of the four, Ivan, brought hurricane-force winds to the state without making a landfall there.\nTimeline of storms\nJune\n;June 1\n* The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\nJuly\n;July 31\n*2 p.m. EDT (1800 UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One forms 200 miles (325 km) east of Jacksonville, Florida.\nAugust\n;August 1\n*2 p.m. EDT (1800 UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One strengthens into Tropical Storm Alex.\n;August 3\n*2 a.m. EDT (0600 UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Alex strengthens into Hurricane Alex.\n*8 a.m. EDT (1200 UTC)&nbsp;– Hurricane Alex reaches Category 2 strength.\n*8 a.m. EDT (1200 UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Two forms near the Lesser Antilles, 415 miles (665 km) east of the Lesser Antilles.\n*1 p.m. EDT (1700 UTC)&nbsp;– Hurricane Alex skirts the Outer Banks of North Carolina but does not make landfall.\n;August 4\n*2 p.m. EDT (1800 UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Two degenerates into a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean Sea.\n*8 p.m. EDT (0000 UTC, August 5)&nbsp;– Hurricane Alex reaches Category 3 strength.
