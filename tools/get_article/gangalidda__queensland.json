On 28 August 2009, it was renamed Gangalidda (the Yukulta / Ganggalidda people being one of the two traditional owners of the land in the Doomadgee area, the other being the Waanyi people).\nDemographics\nIn the , Gangalidda had \"no people or a very low population\".\nIn the , Gangalidda had \"no people or a very low population\".\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Gangalidda nor nearby.
