Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises  above the Park Avenue Trail in  laterally. Precipitation runoff from Queen Victoria Rock drains to the nearby Colorado River via Courthouse Wash. This landform's descriptive toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names, and is so named because the feature resembles the profile of Queen Victoria sitting on a chair, although it may look more like ''Whistler's Mother. The first ascent of the summit was made in November 1986 by Charlie Fowler and Dan Grandusky via Dusty Shadows rock-climbing route (III, A-2+). Charlie Fowler and Alison Sheets also climbed the route, Queen For A Day, rated (I, A-2).\nClimate\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Queen Victoria Rock is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone with cold winters and hot summers.
