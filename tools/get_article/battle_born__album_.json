It was released in the United Kingdom on September 17, 2012, by Vertigo Records and in the United States the following day by Island Records. The phrase \"Battle Born\" appears on the state flag of Nevada and is the name of the recording studio owned by the band, where the majority of the album was recorded.\nRecorded following an extended hiatus, the band worked with five producers during the recording of the album: Steve Lillywhite, Damian Taylor, Brendan O'Brien, Stuart Price, and Daniel Lanois.\nBackground and recording\nFollowing the completion of the band's Day & Age World Tour in January 2010, the Killers announced that the band would be entering an extended hiatus. During this time, frontman Brandon Flowers and bassist Mark Stoermer released solo albums, Flamingo (2010) and Another Life (2011), respectively, while drummer Ronnie Vannucci Jr. released a studio album with his side-project, Big Talk, and recorded with Mt. Desolation. Regarding the band's hiatus, Flowers noted, \"Dave needed to see his kid and rest up. That was just how it worked. And so we ended up going off and doing solo things, and spending our time that way, and that was good, too. It was a good experience. It definitely taught us different ways of thinking about music.\"\nIn October 2011, the band ended its hiatus to begin work on a fourth studio album. Initial sessions were strained, with Flowers noting that the band members spent \"about a week just eyeballing each other in a room.\" The composition of the album's first single, \"Runaways\", marked a turning point in their reunion, with Flowers noting: \"That and 'Miss Atomic Bomb' were the backbone of this record. They made me feel we were on the right track.\"\nWorking at their Las Vegas studio, Battle Born, the band worked with producers Steve Lillywhite, Damian Taylor, Brendan O'Brien, Stuart Price, and Daniel Lanois. Initially, the band had wanted to work with just one, but scheduling difficulties led to the need for multiple producers.\nThe album was partially mixed by Alan Moulder, who also worked on the band's first two albums.\nRelease\nOn June 7, 2012, the Killers released a trailer for Battle Born. The track listing was announced on August 16. The album's first single was \"Runaways\", which received its first radio play on July 10. The single was leaked on Tumblr only hours before its official radio preview. Battle Born was released on September 17, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on September 18 in the United States. A week later, on September 25, the album was released as a vinyl disc.\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1Score =\n| rev2 = The A.V.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 64, based on 27 reviews.\nKyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote:\nThe Killers themselves have always gone for the gold, boldly aiming to fill exotic stadiums with full-throated anthems about big ideas. Like the band's previous output, Battle Born only knows how to be epic: Opener \"Flesh and Bone\" begins as a glitchy Soft Cell throwback before rapidly expanding into a glorious fireworks-and-brimstone sermon, while \"Miss Atomic Bomb\" drives into the desert sunset in a convertible fueled by echoey guitars and glistening-eyed nostalgia. These are big songs, determined to deliver photo-finish climaxes every few seconds.\nThe Guardians Kate Mossman gave the album three out of five stars, saying:\nWith stagey soundscapes more Meat Loaf than Springsteen, and lines overloaded with postcard imagery (\"Your star-spangled heart took a train for the coast\"), you struggle to find the energy till the third or fourth listen, when \"Heart of a Girl\" (co-written with Daniel Lanois) and \"From Here on Out\" (which sounds just like the Eagles) reveal themselves to be the sweetest, most sincere explorations of a kind of US rock that will always raise hairs on the necks of those who like this sort of thing.\nAccolades\nBattle Born was voted the second Best Album of 2012 by the readers of Rolling Stone magazine. Fuse's staff listed it as the 23rd Best Album of 2012.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Battle Born on critics' lists and readers' polls\n! scope=\"col\"| Publication\n! scope=\"col\"| Country\n! scope=\"col\"| Accolade\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Rank\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Fuse\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| United States\n| The 40 Best Albums of 2012\n| 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Rolling Stone\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| United States\n| The Best Albums of 2012: Readers' Poll\n| 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\n|}\nCommercial performance\nBattle Born debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 113,000 copies in its opening week. , it had sold 344,158 copies in the United States.
