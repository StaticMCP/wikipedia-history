Sepaessing was a Native American word meaning 'plum tree' and the term Kijl was a Swedish term meaning river or creek. Because of the excavations of the Warner Company, Scotts Creek retains little of its original characteristics. Most of it is contained within Manor Lake and Van Sciver Lake.\nStatistics\nScotts Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System of the U.S. Geological Survey on 2 August 1979 as identification number 1187173, U.S. Department of the Interior Geological Survey I.D. is 02926.\nCourse\nThe current source of Scotts Creek is Van Sciver Lake, flowing south through Manor Lake on to the Delaware River's 124.10 river mile.\nMunicipalities\n*Falls Township\nCrossings and Bridges\n*Pennsbury Memorial Road\n*Bordentown Road\n*Tyburn Road\nSee also\n*List of rivers of Pennsylvania\n*List of rivers of the United States\n*List of Delaware River tributaries\nReferences"
