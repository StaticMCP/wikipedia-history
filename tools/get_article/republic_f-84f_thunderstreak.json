The RF-84F Thunderflash is variant of the F-84F that was designed for photo reconnaissance.\nThe design was originally intended to be a relatively simple upgrade to the F-84 Thunderjet to make it more competitive with the F-86 Sabre, differing largely in the use of a swept-wing and tail. Given the small number of changes, it was assigned the next model letter in the F-84 series, F. The prototypes demonstrated a number of performance and handling issues, which resulted in marginal improvement over the previous versions. Production was repeatedly delayed and another run of the straight-wing Thunderjets were completed as the G models.\nLooking for a clear performance edge compared to the G models, the engine was upgraded to the much more powerful British Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire built in the United States as the Wright J65. The larger engine required the fuselage to be stretched into an oval shape and the air intake to be modified. With these and other changes, the design was finally ready to enter production, but only a fraction of the original production systems could be used and the aircraft was effectively a new design. It finally entered service in November 1954, by which time the Sabre had also undergone many upgrades and the Thunderstreak was relegated to the fighter-bomber role. Its time as a front-line design was brief; it began to be moved to secondary roles as early as 1958.\nF-84Fs were then offered to NATO member countries and other allies, who took them up in large numbers. Operators included the Belgian Air Force, Royal Danish Air Force, French Air Force, West German Air Force, Hellenic Air Force, Italian Air Force, Royal Netherlands Air Force, Royal Norwegian Air Force, Republic of China Air Force, Turkish Air Force, and for a brief period using ex-French examples, the Israeli Air Force.\nDevelopment\nIn 1948, a swept wing version of the F-84 was created with the hope of bringing performance to the level of the F-86. The last production F-84E was fitted with a swept tail, a new wing with 38.5&nbsp;degrees of leading edge sweep and 3.5&nbsp;degrees of anhedral, and a J35-A-25 engine producing 5,300&nbsp;pound-force (23.58&nbsp;kN) of thrust. The aircraft was designated XF-96A. It flew on 3 June 1950 with Oscar P. Haas at the controls. Although the airplane was capable of , the performance gain over the F-84E was considered minor. Nonetheless, it was ordered into production in July 1950 as the F-84F Thunderstreak. The F-84 designation was retained because the fighter was expected to be a low-cost improvement of the straight-wing Thunderjet with over 55&nbsp;percent commonality in tooling.\nIn the meantime, the USAF, hoping for improved high-altitude performance from a more powerful engine, arranged for the British Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engine to be built in the United States as the Wright J65. To accommodate the larger engine, YF-84Fs with a British-built Sapphire as well as production F-84Fs with the J65 had a vertically stretched fuselage, with the air intake attaining an oval cross-section. Production delays with the F-84F forced the USAF to order a number of straight-wing F-84Gs as an interim measure.\nProduction quickly ran into problems. Although tooling commonality with the Thunderjet was supposed to be 55&nbsp;percent, in reality only fifteen percent of tools could be reused. To make matters worse, the F-84F utilized press-forged wing spars and ribs. At the time, only three presses in the United States could manufacture these, and priority was given to the Boeing B-47 Stratojet bomber over the F-84. The YJ65-W-1 engine was considered obsolete and the improved J65-W-3 did not become available until 1954. When the first production F-84F finally flew on 22 November 1952, it differed from the service test aircraft. It had a different canopy which opened up and back instead of sliding to the rear (a unique design, the canopy was mounted on a pair of hydraulic rams and a pivoted lever arm that allowed it to lift up and backwards while remaining almost level with the fuselage, instead of the more common simple hinged canopy), as well as airbrakes on the sides of the fuselage instead of the bottom of the aircraft. The aircraft was considered not ready for operational deployment due to control and stability problems. The first 275 aircraft, equipped with conventional stabilizer-elevator tailplanes, suffered from accelerated stall pitch-up and poor turning ability at combat speeds. Beginning with Block 25, the problem was improved upon by the introduction of a hydraulically powered one-piece stabilator. A number of aircraft were also retrofitted with spoilers for improved high-speed control. As a result, the F-84F was not declared operational until 12 May 1954.\nThunderflash\nThe second YF-84F prototype was completed with wing-root air intakes. These were not adopted for the fighter due to loss of thrust. However, this arrangement permitted placement of cameras in the nose and the design was adopted for the RF-84F Thunderflash reconnaissance version. The first YRF-84F was completed in February 1952. The aircraft retained an armament of four machine guns and could carry up to fifteen cameras. Innovations included computerized controls which adjusted camera settings for light, speed, and altitude, a periscope to give the pilot better visualization of the target, and a voice recorder to let the pilot narrate his observations. Being largely identical to the F-84F, the Thunderflash suffered from the same production delays and engine problems, delaying operational service until March 1954. The aircraft was retired from active duty in 1957, only to be reactivated in 1961, and finally retired from the ANG in 1972.\nSeveral modified Thunderflashes were used in the FICON project.\nDesign\nThe Thunderstreak suffered from the same poor takeoff performance as the straight-wing Thunderjet despite having a more powerful engine. In reality, almost 700&nbsp;pounds-force (3.11&nbsp;kN) or ten percent of total thrust was lost because the J65 was installed at an angle and its jet pipe was not perfectly straight (in addition to the usual thrust losses from the long jet pipe). On a hot day,  of runway were required for takeoff roll. A typical takeoff speed was . Like the Thunderjet, the Thunderstreak excelled at cruise and had predictable handling characteristics within its performance envelope. Like its predecessor, it also suffered from accelerated stall pitch-up and potential resulting separation of wings from the airplane. In addition, spins in the F-84F were practically unrecoverable and ejection was the only recourse below .\nOperational history\nF-84F in the late 1960s]]\n]]\nProject Run In completed operational tests in November 1954 and found the aircraft to be to USAF satisfaction and considerably better than the F-84G. However, ongoing engine failures resulted in the entire fleet being grounded in early 1955. Also, the J65 engine continued to suffer from flameouts when flying through heavy rain or snow. As the result of the problems, the active duty phaseout began almost as soon as the F-84F entered service in 1954, and was completed by 1958. Increased tensions in Germany associated with construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 resulted in reactivation of the F-84F fleet. In 1962, the fleet was grounded due to the corrosion of control rods. A total of 1,800 man hours were expended to bring each aircraft to full operational capacity. Stress corrosion eventually forced the retirement of ANG F-84Fs in 1971.\nOn 9 March 1955, Lt. Col. Robert R. Scott, in a F-84F Thunderstreak, set a three-hour, 44-minute and 53-second record for the  flight from Los Angeles to New York.\nWith the appearance of the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, which used wing-root mounted air intakes of a similar design to those fitted on the RF-84F, the photorecon variant Thunderflash became known as the ''Thud's Mother. The earlier F-84A had been nicknamed the \"Hog\" and the F-84F \"Super Hog,\" the F-105 becoming the \"Ultra Hog\".\nIn what is probably one of the very few air-to-air engagements involving the F-84F, two Turkish Air Force F-84F Thunderstreaks shot down two Iraqi Il-28 Beagle bombers that crossed the Turkish border by mistake during a bombing operation against Iraqi Kurdish insurgents. This engagement took place on 16 August 1962.\nThe F-84F was retired from active service with the USAF in 1964, and replaced by the North American F-100 Super Sabre. The RF-84F was replaced by the RF-101 Voodoo in USAF units, and relegated to duty in the Air National Guard. The last RF-84F Thunderflash retired from the ANG in 1971. Three Hellenic Air Force RF-84Fs that were retired in 1991 were the last operational F-84s.\nVariants\nprototype]]\n;YF-84F: Two swept-wing prototypes of the F-84F, initially designated YF-96.\n;F-84F Thunderstreak: Swept wing version with Wright J65 engine. Tactical Air Command aircraft were equipped with Low-Altitude Bombing System (LABS) for delivering nuclear bombs. 2,711 built, 1,301 went to NATO under Mutual Defense Assistance Program (MDAP).\n;GRF-84F:25 RF-84Fs were converted to be carried, and launched from the bomb bay of a GRB-36F bomber as part of the FICON project. The aircraft were later redesignated RF-84K.\n;RF-84F Thunderflash:Reconnaissance version of the F-84F with intakes relocated to the wing-roots, 715 built.\n;RF-84K Thunderflash (FICON): RF-84F with a retractable probe for hookup with carrier GRB-36Ds and tailplanes with marked anhedral, 25 redesignated from RF-84F.\n;XF-84H: Two F-84Fs were converted into experimental aircraft. Each was fitted with an Allison XT40-A-1 turboprop engine of 5,850&nbsp;shaft horsepower (4,365&nbsp;kW) driving a supersonic propeller. Ground crews dubbed the XF-84H the Thunderscreech'' due to its extreme noise output.\n;YF-84J: Two F-84Fs were converted into YF-84J prototypes with enlarged nose intakes and a deepened fuselages for the General Electric J73 engine; the YF-84J reached Mach&nbsp;1.09 in level flight on 7 April 1954. The project was cancelled due to the excessive cost of converting existent F-84Fs.\nOperators\nF-84F]]\n, Berlin, Germany; note the distinctive Republic-type wing root intakes that led to the RF-84F being called \"Thud's Mother\", due to the use of similar intakes on the later Republic F-105 Thunderchief|alt=]]\nRF-84F]]\n;\n* Belgian Air Force - 197 x F-84F, 34 x RF-84F operated from 1955.\n;\n* Royal Danish Air Force - 23× RF-84F received, in service from 1957 to 1971.\n;\n* French Air Force - 328 F-84Fs and 88 RF-84Fs received from 1955.\n;\n* West German Air Force - 450 F-84Fs and 108 RF-84Fs received.

John H. Kapeles, pilot, assigned to the 27th Fighter Escort Wing, died in the crash. Three civilians died on the ground when the plane crashed onto their homes. The plane had just come off the General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant production line and had been test flown. Eyewitnesses reported that the plane plunged at a high speed toward the ground after the flight had banked toward the west from the east. The three remaining planes returned to Fairfax Municipal Airport.\n* On 9 December 1955, a USAF F-84F on an instrument training flight from RAF Sculthorpe in Norfolk experienced a flameout and the pilot ejected. The aircraft crashed into Lodge Moor Hospital, Sheffield. The crash killed one patient and injured seven others.\n* On 4 April 1957, the USAF Captain Richard W. Higgins died after a low ejection near the Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base. He was flying one of the first F-84Fs of the German Air Force.\n* On 1 August 1960, Captain Finn Erik Andersen of the Royal Norwegian Air Force flying F-84F Thunderflash registration T3-S crashed into the Styggmann peak of Skrimfjella in Southern Norway. The pilot was killed. As of 2023, some wreckage remains on the mountain.\n* On 20 November 1960 a F-84F Thunderstreak of the Royal Netherlands Air Force crashed at 7:50pm into a farm in  between Wjelsryp and Franeker, the Netherlands. The pilot and the family of six people who lived at the farm were all killed. The farm was destroyed and burned down and the livestock was killed.\n* On 14 September 1961, two West German F-84Fs of the West German Air Force crossed into East German airspace due to a navigational error, eventually landing at Berlin Tegel Airport, evading a large number of Soviet fighter aircraft. The event came at a historically difficult time during the Cold War, one month after the construction of the Berlin Wall.\n* On 28 January 1962, the USAF Lieutenant Donald Slack died after striking a  (ASL) mountain in central France in his F-84F of the New Jersey Air National Guard. The book Stranger to the Ground by Richard Bach was dedicated to him.\nAircraft on display\nBelgium\n;F-84F Thunderstreak\n* 52-6584 – FU-197, Balen-Keiheuvel Aerodrome\n* 52-7169 – FU-30, Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels\n* 53-6677 – FU-66, Kleine Brogel Air Base\n* 53-6888 – FU-177, Leopoldsburg/Beverlo Airfield\n;RF-84F Thunderflash\n* 51-1922 – FR-27 Gate Guardian at the Aerodrome Spa-La Sauveniere Airport.\n* 51-1945 – FR28, Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History, Brussels.\nDenmark\n;RF-84F\n* C-581 – Flyvestation Karup Historiske Forening Museet, Karup\n* C-264 – Danish Collection of Vintage Aircraft, Skjern\nFrance\n;F-84F\n* Unknown – Musée de l'air et de l'espace.\n* Tactical number 4-SA - Saint-Léger-sous-Beuvray in Montandé hamlet.\nGermany\n;F-84F Thunderstreak\n* tactical number BF-106 – Luftwaffenmuseum Gatow - Militärhistorisches Museum Flugplatz Berlin-Gatow.\n* tactical number DD-313 – Luftwaffenmuseum Gatow - Militärhistorisches Museum Flugplatz Berlin-Gatow.\n* tactical number DE 254 (s.n.51-1702) – Flugausstellung Peter Junior, Hermeskeil.\n* tactical number BF 105 (s.n.52-6778) – Flugausstellung Peter Junior, Hermeskeil.\n* tactical number DC-101 - behind main gate, inside Büchel AB, Büchel.\n* tactical number DD-113 – at the entrance road towards Memmingen Airport\n;RF-84F Thunderflash\n* tactical number EB-344 – Luftwaffenmuseum Gatow - Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr.\n* tactical number EA 241 (s.n.52-7663) – Flugausstellung Peter Junior, Hermeskeil.\nGreece\n;F-84F Thunderstreak\n* tactical number 26595 - Hellenic Air Force Museum (Μουσείο Πολεμικής Αεροπορίας)\n* tactical number 37050 - Larissa air base\n;RF-84F Thunderflash\n* tactical number 17-011 (s/n 51-17011 - ex-Luftwaffe) - Hellenic Air Force Museum (Μουσείο Πολεμικής Αεροπορίας)\n;F-84F Thunderstreak\n* tactical number unknown - Rentina Agrafon (Ρεντίνα Αγράφων).\nItaly\n;F-84F\n* 53-6892 – Italian Air Force Museum, Vigna di Valle near Rome.\n* D1003 - Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milan\n;RF-84F Thunderflash\n* 52-7458 – Italian Air Force Museum, Vigna di Valle.\n* 52-7456 - private display of P.i.p.&nbsp;Lido, Via Roma Destra, 30016 Venice.\nNetherlands\n;F-84F\n* 52-7174 - P-119, On display in front of the JTAC school in Schaarsbergen.\n* 52-7185 - P-134, in storage at ROCvA Airport College, Hoofddorp\n* 53-6582 - P-229, Stored at Reek; painted as P-312.\n* 53-6584 - P-248, Gate Guard at Volkel Air Base.\n* 53-6600 - P-254, in storage at Nationaal Militair Museum, Soesterberg\n* 53-6604 - P-224, Stored at Reek.\n* 53-6612 - P-226, on display at Nationaal Militair Museum, Soesterberg\n* 53-6726 - P-230, Nose section only; stored at Nationaal Militair Museum, Soesterberg.\n* 53-6742 - P-231, Gate Guard at Eindhoven Air Base.\n* 53-6916 - P-191, Gate Guard at Gilze-Rijen Air Base.\n;RF-84F\n* 51-11253 - TP-19, in storage at Nationaal Militair Museum, Soesterberg\n* 53-7644 - FR31, ex.
