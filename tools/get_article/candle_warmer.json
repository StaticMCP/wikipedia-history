They typically use either a hot plate or an overhead lamp as the heat source and include a stand or tray for the candle jar or wax.  Candle warmers eliminate many fire hazards associated with open-flame candles; however, a 2025 American Chemical Society study indicates that scented wax melts warmed in these devices can still degrade indoor air quality.\nHistory\nEarly accessories called “candle warmers” used a candle’s own flame to warm food or drink; an Art-Deco food warmer designed by Peter Mueller-Munk in 1949 is one example.\nElectrical candle-heating devices appeared by the early 1950s, as shown by a 1952 U.S. patent for a “cover for a candle warmer.”\nThe modern consumer product was popularised in 2001, when  introduced a mug-warmer-style hot plate for jar candles after a candle-related house fire prompted a search for safer fragrance methods.\nIn 2003, Scentsy launched a direct-sales model built around plug-in wax warmers and wickless scented wax, broadening public awareness.\nDecorative candle-lamp warmers became popular in the 2010s; by 2024 the hashtag #CandleWarmer had exceeded 170 million views on TikTok.\nDesign and technology\nHeating mechanisms\n* Plate warmers use an electric resistive element beneath a metal or ceramic plate to heat the candle from below.\n* Lamp warmers position a halogen or incandescent bulb above the candle, melting the top layer of wax while providing ambient light.\n* 2-in-1 models accept either a candle jar on the plate or wax melts in a detachable dish.\nMaterials and safety features\nWarmers employ heat-resistant ceramics or metals and typically carry UL/ETL or CE certification.  Modern units often add auto shut-off timers, dimmers or thermostats, and over-temperature fuses.  Manufacturers warn against using certain vegetable-wax candles on high-heat plates to avoid jar rupture.\nGlobal usage and market\nIndustry analysts valued the candle-warmers segment at roughly US$320 million in 2023 and project it to exceed US$450 million by the early 2030s.  North America accounts for ≈38 % of revenue, followed by Asia–Pacific (~25 %) and Europe (~22 %).  Growth drivers include home-wellness trends and social-media exposure.  Major brands are Candle Warmers Etc., Scentsy, ScentSationals/Rimports, Yankee Candle, and Bath & Body Works.\nAdvantages\n* Fire safety – no open flame drastically reduces ignition risk.\n* No soot or smoke – eliminates combustion by-products.\n* Even fragrance throw – melts a larger wax surface than a flame.\n* Extended candle life – jar candles can emit fragrance for up to five times longer on a warmer.\n* Lower long-term cost – reusable device; inexpensive wax-melt refills.\n* Decor and lighting – lamp styles double as ambient lighting.\nDisadvantages\n* Reduced ambiance – lacks natural flame flicker.\n* Up-front cost – US$10–50 per device.\n* Outlet dependency – requires electricity.\n* Faster fragrance depletion – wax loses scent sooner, leaving unscented residue.\n* Indoor-air VOCs – 2025 ACS study showed wax-melt VOCs forming ultrafine particles comparable to those from burning candles.\nSafety considerations\n* Place warmers on stable, heat-resistant surfaces away from combustibles.\n* Use UL/ETL-certified devices and follow manufacturer instructions.\n* Avoid overheating vegetable-wax candles, which can pressurise and crack jars.\nIndoor air quality\nWhile warmers remove soot and smoke, they do not eliminate all emissions.  A Purdue University study in Environmental Science & Technology Letters found that warming terpene-rich wax melts generated secondary organic aerosol nanoparticles.  Researchers concluded that “flame-free does not mean pollution-free.”\nComparison with traditional candles\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Aspect !! Candle warmer !!
