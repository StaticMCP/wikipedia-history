As Iroki was not revealed to be a greedy tyrant everyone thought, until she discovered Grodi had been poisoning all of her country's food supplies to kill all of her people during Wrath of God incident. She pretended to have descent into villainy, by confiscating all food supplies Grodi poisoned and to save her people, and staged her death, where Kaguragi will come to make amends to return. Unfortunately, Kaguragi was too late to save Iroki from sacrificing herself of eating the poisonous food in her people's steads, just as she set the castle on fire where she was buried. Although Kaguragi was appointed as her successor, he was unable to initiate her order to execute her, and was forced to watch her being killed by Grodi's poison and her corpse being consumed by the castle's flame in horror. Nevertheless, since then, Kaguragi and his family kept Iroki's promise to cover the truth behind her death until Grodi's crime is exposed. As Iroki secretly retained her willpower when Grodi resurrected, but still connected to the Galactinsect necromancer's life force, she provokes Kaguragi's failure to execute her order in the past, allowing him to gain confidence to finish what he start. Thanks to Hymeno's tips that destroying Grodi's scythe makes him mortal, Kaguragi slays the perpetrator and presumably kills him, while Kuroko successfully eradicates food supplies Grodi poisoned and foils his repeated crime.
