It was projected by Zadar architect Ivo Sorić. On 31 May 1990 the church was dedicated. The whole complex consisted of the church, a pastoral center, sacristy and sanitary facilities. A bell tower which was 17 meters high, was also built.\nOn 28 August 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence, the church was mined and damaged by rebel Serbs.\nIn 1998 and 1999 it was rebuilt with a new bell tower, which is 28 meters high.\nReferences"
