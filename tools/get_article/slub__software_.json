The technique is used to retain allocated memory that contains a data object of a certain type for reuse upon subsequent allocations of objects of the same type. It is used in Linux and became the default allocator since 2.6.23.\nSee also\n* Slab allocation (SLAB)\n* SLOB\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [https://lwn.net/Articles/229984/ The SLUB allocator]\n* [https://lwn.net/Articles/229096/ SLUB: The unqueued slab allocator V6]"
