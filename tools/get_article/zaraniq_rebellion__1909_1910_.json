In response, an Ottoman Force advancing from Zabid captured a Zaraniq stronghold nearby Husayniyah, but was ambushed on 23 February near Beit-el-fakih after when it tried to link up with another Ottoman Force to the south. On 7 March, the Ottomans defeated the Zaraniq near Husayniyah, killing 80. Upon receiving reinforcements, the Ottomans renewed the offensive, but the fighting was inconclusive. In February 1910, the Ottomans ambushed a Zaraniq force, killing 750. The Ottomans refused to offer the Zaraniq amnesty until they disarmed; it's unclear if this offer was accepted.\nReferences"
