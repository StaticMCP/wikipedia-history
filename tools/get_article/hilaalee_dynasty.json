It ruled the country from 1388 to 1573. It came under Portuguese power in 1558 and disestablished in 1573 after the Utheemu rebellion against the Portuguese presence. After the disestablishment, an interregnum period started in the history of the Maldives.\nHistory\nThe first king of the Maldivian Hilaalee dynasty was Hassan I of the Maldives and he was proclaimed king in the year 1388 AD.\nHistorians differ on the origin of Hilaalee family. One view holds that Hassan I (Hassan Al-Hilaaly) was the great-grandson of a man named Hilaalee, who migrated from Malabar to Hulhule' island.\nAccording to another view, the dynasty descended from a Somali family who migrated to Hulhule' island.\nSome historical documents reveal that Hilali Kalo Hassan dethroned King Uthman Rasgefaan, who was the ruling King at that time and outcast him and all his ministers. After this Hilai Kalo Hassan started the Hilai Dynasty.\nSee also\n*List of Maldivian monarchs\n*List of Sunni dynasties\nReferences"
