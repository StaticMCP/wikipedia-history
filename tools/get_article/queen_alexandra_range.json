The discovery that multicellular life forms had lived so close to the South Pole was an additional piece of evidence that accompanied the publication (in 1910 and independently in 1912) of the theory of continental drift.\nLocation\nThe Queen Alexandra Range is bounded by the Beardmore Glacier along its southeast edge, which divides it from the Commonwealth Range of the Queen Maud Mountains to the east.\nThe west of the range is bounded by the Antarctic Plateau in the south.\nFurther north it is bounded by the Walcott Névé to the east, which separates the range from the Colbert Hills.\nThe Walcott Névé joins the Law Glacier in the Bowden Névé which feeds the Lennox-King Glacier.\nThis glacier bounds the northwest part of the range, and separates it from the Holland Range to the north.\nThe northern tip of the range extends to the Ross Ice Shelf between the Lennox King Glaciers and Beardmore Glacier.\nMajor glaciers\n*Beardmore Glacier () is of the largest known valley glaciers, over  long, descending the polar plateau and flowing north between the Queen Alexandra Range and Commonwealth Range, to enter the Ross Ice Shelf.\n*Law Glacier () is a glacier about  wide between the south end of the Queen Elizabeth Range and the MacAlpine Hills, gradually descending east-northeast from the polar plateau to Bowden Névé.\n*Bowden Névé  is a névé about  wide, lying southward of Mount Miller between Queen Elizabeth Range and Queen Alexandra Range.\n*Walcott Névé  is a névé, about  in area, bounded by the Marshall Mountains, Lewis Cliff and Mount Sirius.\n*Lennox-King Glacier () is a large valley glacier, about  long, draining Bowden Névé and flowing northeast between the Holland Range and Queen Alexandra Ranges to enter Richards Inlet, Ross Ice Shelf.\nMountains and peaks\nMountains and peaks over  high include:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:1px solid #e7dcc3;\"\n|-\n!

It is easily identifiable by its high, ice-free slope facing Beardmore Glacier.\n*Mount Kirkpatrick (), a lofty, generally ice-free mountain in Queen Alexandra Range  west of Mount Dickerson. At  it is the highest point in the Queen Alexandra Range.\n*Adams Mountains (), a small but well defined group of mountains bounded by the Beardmore Glacier, Berwick Glacier, Moody Glacier and Bingley Glacier.\n*Mount Falla (), a prominent conical mountain,  high, standing  northeast of Mount Stonehouse, between Berwick Glacier and Prebble Glacier.\n*Marshall Mountains (), a group of mountains overlooking Beardmore Glacier. They are bounded on the north by Berwick Glacier, and on the south by Swinford Glacier.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n*"
