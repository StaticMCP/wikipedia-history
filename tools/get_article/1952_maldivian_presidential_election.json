They followed the approval of a new constitution in a referendum in March 1952, which had changed the country's system of governance from being a monarchy to a republic.\nThe result was a victory for Mohamed Amin Didi, who received almost 96% of the vote. Amin Didi subsequently became the country's first President.\nReferences"
