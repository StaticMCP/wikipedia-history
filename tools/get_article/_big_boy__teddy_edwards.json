      "text": "# \"Big Boy\" Teddy Edwards\n\n\"Big Boy\" Teddy Edwards was an American blues musician, from the United States, who recorded 23 songs from 1930 to 1936. Edwards was active in the Chicago area of the United States. There is very little biographical information published on Edwards' life.\nEdwards played the tiple, a ten-stringed instrument, and was the only recorded blues tiple player during the period he was active. Edwards was also proficient on the guitar. Contemporary blues musician Big Bill Broonzy recalled working with Edwards, as well as Edwards working with Papa Charlie Jackson. Prolific session pianist Black Bob also recorded with Edwards on several of his later records. Edwards' song \"Louise\", recorded in 1934, was covered by Broonzy as \"Louise Louise Blues\".\nRecordings\nBetween 1930 and 1936, Edwards recorded 23 songs for the Vocalion, Melotone, Bluebird, Brunswick, and Decca record labels. Edwards was given several pseudonyms by the record companies that issued his recordings; these included \"Teddy Edwards\", \"\"Big Boy\" Teddy Edwards\", and \"Eddy Teddy\". Edwards' 1930 and 1931 records differ from his later output, singing with a simple tiple accompaniment. All of Edwards' sessions after this show him in a band setting with more of a pop music style, being accompanied by Big Bill Broonzy, Black Bob, and others.\n1930\nRecorded July 21, 1930\n* \"Them Things\"\n* \"Family Trouble\"\nRecorded September 19, 1930\n* \"I Ain't Gonna Give You None\"\n* \"Lovin' Blues\"\nRecorded December 12, 1930\n* \"Alcohol Mama\"\n1931\nRecorded February 4, 1931\n* \"Wild Woman Blues\"\n1934\nRecorded June 14, 1934\n* \"Who Did You Give My Barbecue To?\" (Part 1)\n* \"Who Did You Give My Barbecue To?\" (Part 2)\n* \"I'm Gonna Tell My Mama On You\"\n* \"Louise\"\n* \"Love Will Provide For Me\"\n* \"If I Had A Girl Like You\"\nRecorded October 18, 1934\n* \"Good Doing Daddy\" (Take 1)\n* \"Good Doing Daddy\" (Take 2)\n* \"It Was No Dream\"\n* \"Louise\"\n* \"Dancing The Blues Away\"\n* \"Hoodoo Blues\"\n* \"Run Away Blues\"\nRecorded October 24, 1934\n* \"Who Did You Give My Barbecue To?\" (Part 1)\n* \"Who Did You Give My Barbecue To?\" (Part 2)\n1936\nRecorded May 15, 1936\n* \"W.P.A Blues\"\n* \"Louisiana\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.discogs.com/Big-Boy-Teddy-Edwards-1930-1936/release/4825378 Discogs Page]"
