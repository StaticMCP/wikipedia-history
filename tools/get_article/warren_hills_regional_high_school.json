Before the opening of the school, students had attended Washington High School, which was repurposed as the new district's junior high school. An expansion of the high school building was completed in 1992, which included a new library and gym to accommodate the addition of students in ninth grade. A second expansion at the high school during the first decade of the 21st century added more classrooms, office space, gym/weight rooms, and conversion of the original gym to a new library to meet growing enrollment in the district. Recently, the district added an all-purpose athletic field, tennis courts, and practice field on an acquired tract of land on Jackson Valley Road.\nStudent publications\nThe school has two newspapers and a Literary Magazine or \"litmag\" The official school paper The Streak has been publishing for 26 consecutive years and is published four times a year.
