The application features a Task List window for managing tasks and time, a desktop gadget-like stopwatch for controlling the timer, and can produce reports and detect when the user is away. In addition, Grindstone can synchronize time tracking data for multiple users via a paid service called Task Force.\nHistory\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"margin:auto; margin:0 0 0 2em;\"\n|+ Grindstone versions\n|-\n!
