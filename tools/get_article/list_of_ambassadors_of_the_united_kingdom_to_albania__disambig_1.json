The embassy in the capital, Tirana, has existed only since diplomatic relations were re-established in 1991 after a long break.\nHeads of mission\n;Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary\n* 1922–1926: Harry Eyres\n* 1926: William O'Reilly\n* 1926–1928: William Seeds\n* 1928–1936: Sir Robert Hodgson\n* 1936–1939: Sir Andrew Ryan\nSir Andrew Ryan left shortly after the Italian invasion in April 1939.\n; Consul-General\n* 1939–1940: Laurence Grafftey-Smith\n* 1939–1991: No relations due to World War II and Corfu Channel incidents.\n;Ambassador to Italy (also accredited to Albania)\n* 1991–1992: Sir Stephen Egerton\n* 1992–1996: Sir Patrick Fairweather\n;Chargé d'affaires\n* 1992–1993: John Duncan\n* 1993–1995: Stephen Nash\n* 1995–1996: David Slinn\n* 1996: Andrew Tesorière\n;Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary\n*1996–1998: Andrew Tesorière\n*1998–1999: Stephen Nash\n*1999–2001: Peter January\n*2001–2003: David Landsman\n*2003–2006: Richard Jones\n*2006–2009: Fraser Wilson\n*2009–2012: Fiona McIlwham\n*2012–2016: Nicholas Cannon\n*2016–2021: Duncan Norman\n*2021–2024: Alastair King-Smith\n*2024-present: Nick Abbott\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gov.uk/government/world/albania UK and Albania], gov.uk\n*Hanson, Joanna, [https://web.archive.org/web/20081026110511/http://ukinalbania.fco.gov.uk/en/our-office-in-albania/our-embassy/embassy-history/ Full history of the British Presence in Albania], Foreign Office, 10 October 2002 (via archive.org)"
