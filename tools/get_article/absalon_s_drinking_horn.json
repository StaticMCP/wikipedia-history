The incorrect tradition that it has belonged to Bishop Absalon may come from Henrik Tornekrans, its last Catholic abbot. It is first mentioned in the records of the Royal Danish Treasury in 1696. In 1845, it was transferred to the new National Museum of Denmark.\nDescription\nThe horn is from European bison and its length measures 72.2&nbsp;cm with a diameter is 15.5&nbsp;cm. The silver mount of the rim  measures 5&nbsp;cm and is without ornamentation. Below it is an engraved frieze from the beginning of the 16th century with the coat of arms of the Tornekrans. Below the trim mount is also an escutcheon coat of arms from around 1400, depicting an abbot in a stylized garden. There are traces of a now-lost silver mount on the tip of the horn. On a drawing from 1696 of \"Absalons belongings\" (Sorø), it can be seen with the tip fixture still there.\nSee also\n* Oldenburg Horn\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Etting, Vivian: The Story of the Drinking Horn - Drinking Culture in Scandinavia during the Middle Ages'', Syddansk Universitetsforlag, 2013.\nExternal links\n* [https://runeberg.org/dagligt/5/0197.html Source]\n* [https://soroekloster.kw01.net/page/705/absalon Source]"
