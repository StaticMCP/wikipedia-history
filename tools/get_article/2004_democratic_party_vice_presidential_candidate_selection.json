Kerry selected North Carolina Senator John Edwards as his running mate on July 6, 2004. The Kerry–Edwards ticket was ultimately  defeated by the Bush–Cheney ticket in the general election, and Edwards returned to the Senate following the campaign but left politics less than two months later.\nSelection process\nThe vice presidential selection process was led by James Johnson, former chief executive officer of Fannie Mae and Chairman of Walter Mondale's 1984 Presidential Campaign. Kerry, who had been considered by Al Gore in 2000 as a potential running mate, sought to ensure that the selection process was discreet. To evade reporters, Kerry interviewed Edwards at former Secretary of State Madeline Albright's home in Washington D.C. Alyssa Mastromonaco, who would later serve as White House Deputy Chief of Staff under President Barack Obama, organized Kerry's meetings with the candidates.\nReported shortlist\nPundits and those close to the Kerry campaign indicated that candidates narrowed to five potential choices.\nFile:General Wesley Clark 2000.jpg||alt=Retired Army  General and 2004 presidential candidateWesley Clarkfrom Arkansas\nFile:John Edwards, official Senate photo portrait (cropped 3x4 v2).jpg| |alt=Senator and 2004 presidential candidateJohn Edwardsfrom North Carolina(1999–2005)\nFile:Richard Gephardt (cropped).jpg||alt=Representative and 2004 presidential candidateDick Gephardtfrom Missouri(1977–2005)\nFile:BobGrahamCropped.jpg||alt=SenatorBob Grahamfrom Florida(1987–2005)\nFile:Tom Vilsack, official USDA portrait (cropped).jpg||alt=GovernorTom Vilsackfrom Iowa(1999–2007)\nAnnouncement\nThe night before the campaign's announcement of the selection of Edwards, the information was leaked by an airport worker who saw Edwards's name being painted on Kerry's plane. On July 6, the Kerry campaign sent an e-mail message to his supporters at about 8:15&nbsp;a.m. EDT informing them of the choice, and made the formal announcement at 9 a.m. EDT in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nMedia speculation on possible vice presidential candidates\nMembers of Congress\nFile:SenatorBayh (cropped).jpg||alt=SenatorEvan Bayhfrom Indiana(1999–2011)\nFile:Joe Biden, official photo portrait 2-cropped.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Bill Bradley P01255-06 a.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Senator Max Cleland (cropped).jpg||alt=Former SenatorMax Clelandfrom Georgia(1997–2003)\nFile:Hillary Clinton 2004 (cropped).JPG||alt=SenatorHillary Clintonfrom New York(2001–2009)\nFile:James Clyburn, official Congressional Majority Whip photo.jpg||alt=Representative Jim Clyburnfrom South Carolina(1993–present)\nFile:Tom Daschle, official Senate photo.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Richard Durbin official photo (cropped).jpg||alt=SenatorDick Durbinfrom Illinois(1997–present)\nFile:Dianne Feinstein congressional portrait (cropped).jpg|alt=|\nFile:John Glenn Low Res.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Bio hamilton headshot.jpg||alt=Former RepresentativeLee H.
