It was removed in 1991 as part of the decommunisation of Ukraine following independence.\nDescription\nThe monument had a form of a granite pylon with a figure of Vladimir Lenin out of red granite (). In front of the pylon there were four bronze figures of male and female workers, peasant and sailor, each  in height. The whole composition was located on a granite stylobate.\nHistory\nThe Monument of the Great October Revolution was erected in 1977 by Ukrainian communist officials to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution. During the 1990 Revolution on Granite, the monument was used by anti-communist student activists as a shield against a nearby bomb planted in the area. Following Ukrainian independence in 1991 and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the majority of monuments to Lenin were destroyed. This included the Monument of the Great October Revolution being toppled. The destruction of the monument was ordered by the Kyiv City State Administration and the toppled statue was taken to the property of the  privatised \"\"Ukrrestavratsiya\" where its fate was unknown. The pedestal initially remained and was used for mounting advertising boards for a camera shop the following year.\nDesigners\nThe following architects designed and built the monument:\n* Vasyl Borodai, sculptor\n* Ivan Znoba, sculptor\n* Valentyn Znoba, sculptor\n* Oleksandr Malynovsky, architect\n* M.Skybytsky, architect\nGallery\nFile:Destroying of Lenin on the Independence square, Kiev.jpg|Removal of the monument on September 12, 1991, by decision of the Kiev City Council\nFile:October Revolution Square, September 1991.jpg|Maidan Nezalezhnosti in September 1991; the monument is being taken down\nSee also\n* Vladimir Lenin monument, Kyiv\n* Decommunization in Ukraine\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.today/20150501013200/http://www.twirpx.com/topic/4474/ Chronology of the Soviet Union disintegration].\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150501003531/http://www.calendarium.com.ua/v_kieve_demontirovali_monument_v_chest_velikoi_oktyabrskoi_sotsialisticheskoi_revolyutsii_1991 In Kiev took down the Monument commemorating the Great October Socialist Revolution (1991)].
