He was also principal of the Royal Northern College of Music.\nEarly life and education\nHe was born in Sunderland, England, in 1945. He studied composition (with Alan Bush) and piano at the Royal Academy of Music from 1963 to 1967, winning five prizes for composition. Although his works have no opus numbers, he referred to his Oboe Sonata as his Opus 1.\nCareer\nIn 1988, he was nominated for an Ivor Novello award for his title music to BBC Television's Young Musician of the Year programmes, for which he also regularly officiated as a jury member and broadcaster.\nHe was Principal of the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester from 1996 to 2008. There he faced criticism for the appointment of Malcolm Layfield, previously a violin teacher at the College,  to the post of Head of Strings, despite Gregson's knowledge of allegations that Layfield had a history of sexual misconduct against students.\nIn 2008, he retired from academic life to concentrate on his composition.\nHe has since completed orchestral commissions for the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Bournemouth Symphony, the Hallé and the BBC Philharmonic orchestras. In 2014, the North American Brass Band Association honored both Edward Gregson and his brother Bramwell Gregson (best known for his conducting work with the London Citadel Band and Canada's Brassroots, modelled on the Philip Jones brass tentet). Each section's required test piece was composed by Edward Gregson.\nHe continues to sit on a number of Boards relating to music education and the music industry. He is a fellow at the RNCM, as well as at the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music.\nIn October 2024 Gregson was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award at The Ivors Classical Awards. Viola Concerto \"Three Goddesses\" was nominated for Best Large Ensemble Composition.\nPerformances\nHis music has been performed by many orchestras and ensembles worldwide, including in the UK: the London Symphony Orchestra and all the BBC orchestras; in the USA: Detroit, Louisville and Albany (New York); in the Far East: Tokyo Philharmonic and China National Broadcasting Orchestra; and in Europe: orchestras in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Scandinavia.\nA major retrospective of his music was held in Manchester in 2002.\nRecordings\nChandos have released three complete discs of works by Gregson:\n* [http://www.chandos.net/details06.asp?CNumber=CHAN%2010478 Trumpet Concerto, Saxophone Concerto, Concerto for piano and wind]\n* [http://www.chandos.net/details06.asp?CNumber=CHAN%2010105 Blazon, Clarinet Concerto, Violin Concerto, Stepping Out]\n* [http://www.chandos.net/details06.asp?CNumber=CHAN%2010627 Music for Chamber Orchestra, Trombone Concerto, Two Pictures for String Orchestra, 'A Song for Chris' (Cello Concerto)]\nNaxos has recorded the complete piano music including the Piano Sonata in one movement, and the two string quartets.\nSeveral CDs of his music for brass have been recorded by various groups on the Doyen label:\n* Gregson Volume 1 (DOY CD 017) Desford Colliery Caterpillar Band, circa 1992\n**Dances and Arias\n**Concerto for French Horn and Brass Band (w.
