      "text": "# Ancient Journeys\n\nAncient Journeys: A Vision of the New World is an album by German cross-cultural new-age band Cusco, released in 2000. Released three years after the previous album, this one peaked at #2 on the Billboard Top New Age Albums chart.\nThis album continues somewhat in the flavor of Apurimac III, but is dedicated to ancient journeys of adventure and discovery. The musical compositions draw upon ancient rhythms and melodies to evoke imagery of historic kingdoms, transcontinental sea voyages, conquests, and land explorations.\nTrack listing\n# \"Da Gama\" (featuring Ottmar Liebert)\n# \"Conquistadores\"\n# \"Land of the Midnight Sun\"\n# \"Tigris & Euphrates\"\n# \"Byzantium\"\n# \"The Journeys of Marco Polo\"\n# \"The Horsemen of Bulgar\"\n# \"Kublai Khan\"\n# \"The Crusades\"\nAlbum credits\n* Kristian Schultze – Arranger, keyboard, percussion,\n* Manuel Lopez – Acoustic guitar\n* Dan Selene – Executive producer\n* Michael Holm – Arranger, producer, percussion, keyboard\n* Johan Daansen – Guitar\n* David Donnelly – Digital mixing\n* Debra Holland – Percussion\n* Ottmar Liebert – Guitar\n* Klaus Strazicky – Mixing\n* Cusco – Main performer\n* Matt Marshall – Executive producer\n* Biboul Darouiche – Percussion\nReferences"
