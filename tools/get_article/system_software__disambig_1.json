An example of system software is an operating system (OS) such as macOS, Linux, Android, and Windows. A systems administrator (a.k.a. systems programmer) uses system software to analyze, configure, optimize and maintain a computer.\nIn contrast, application software allows a user to do end user tasks such as creating text documents, playing or developing games, creating presentations, listening to music, drawing pictures, or browsing the web. Examples of such software are computational science software, game engines, search engines, industrial automation, and software as a service applications.\nIn the late 1940s, application software was custom-written by computer users to fit their specific hardware and requirements. System software was usually supplied by the manufacturer of the computer hardware and was intended to be used by most or all users of that system.\nMany operating systems come with application software. Such software is not considered system software when it can be uninstalled without affecting the functioning of other software. Examples of such software are games and simple editing tools, or software development toolchains supplied with many Linux distributions. System software can include software development tools like compiler, linker, and debugger.\nSee also\n* IBM mainframe utility programs\n* Nintendo DSi system software\n* Nintendo 3DS system software\n* Nintendo Switch system software\n* PlayStation 3 system software\n* PlayStation 4 system software\n* PlayStation Portable system software\n* PlayStation Vita system software\n* System programming\n* System programming language\n* Wii system software\n* Wii U system software\n* Xbox 360 system software\n* Xbox One system software\nReferences"
