Some American officials described the fall of the dam as a grave concern, because it could release a  wave of water if it was destroyed, threatening towns and cities downstream. Following these recent developments, Kurdish forces, Iraqi forces, and the U.S. Air Force launched a counter-offensive to retake the dam.\nAlso of grave concern was that Mosul Dam was constructed on evaporite rocks of the Miocene Fars (Fatha) Formation, which are water-soluble. As a result, the reservoir behind the dam was not filled to capacity. A continued regimen of pumping concrete grout into potential leaks meant that a long term interruption of remedial works could end in a reduction of structural integrity and disaster.\nEvents\nOn August 16, the U.S. Air Force launched air strikes on IS positions near the dam, destroying some of their equipment. Kurdish forces also launched attacks against IS on the same day, shelling their positions near the dam, and opening up the possibility for a ground attack. A Kurdish commander, Major General Abdelrahman Korini, told AFP that Peshmerga forces had captured the eastern side of the dam and were \"still advancing.\" Rudaw, a Kurdish news organization, said the airstrikes appeared to be the \"heaviest U.S. bombing of militant positions since the start of airstrikes\" against IS last week. At least 11 IS fighters were killed by the airstrikes.\nOn August 17, the fighting continued. Kurdish officials said that peshmerga forces captured three towns near the dam: Tel Skuf, Sharafiya and Batnaya. The U.S.-led coalition had until that day conducted nine airstrikes and destroyed or damaged four armoured personnel carriers, seven armed vehicles, two Humvees and an armoured vehicle. IS militants tried to slow down Kurdish forces with explosive devices, including homemade bombs and land mines.\nOn August 18, Iraqi and Kurdish forces said that they had taken full control of the dam. U.S. President Barack Obama also confirmed that the Mosul Dam was under complete Kurdish and Iraqi control. He also said that the move to recapture the Mosul Dam was a \"major step forward\" in the long-term strategy to defeat the militants. Journalists in the area reported that the fighting had not completely ended.\nOn August 19, the battle ended completely, with an Iraqi-Kurdish victory. BBC reporter Jim Muir, who had visited the dam, said it was \"back in safe hands\" and appeared intact.\nSee also\n*Tishrin Dam offensive\n*Battle of Mosul (2016–2017)\n*Battle of Tabqa\nReferences"
