It airs from early November through late December, covering the U.S Thanksgiving and Christmas season. The first episode premiered on November 9, 2014, and it has become a yearly competition with several spin-off shows, including Spring Baking Championship, Halloween Baking Championship, Kids Baking Championship, Wedding Cake Championship and Summer Baking Championship.\nRounds\nEach episode has two rounds. The first round is the \"Preliminary Heat\" where the bakers must create small pastries centered around a holiday theme.\nThe person who wins the pre-heat gets an advantage going into the next round and aren't told about it until the second round theme is announced. The advantage usually varies.\nThe second round is the \"Main Heat\" where the contestants get more time than the first round to create a larger confection (in size or quantity) that sticks to the holiday theme of the episode. Partway through the main heat, there's often a curveball thrown in that has the bakers adapt or change their plans. The winner of the  \"Main Heat\" advances to the next episode while the baker with the worst dish is eliminated. The 3 bakers remaining will compete in the final \"Main Heat\" challenge.\nHost and judges\nThe show's first three seasons were hosted by Bobby Deen. Jesse Palmer has been host of the program since season four.\nBaker Duff Goldman (Ace of Cakes) and pastry chef Nancy Fuller (Farmhouse Rules) serve as permanent judges of the show. Lorraine Pascale (former UK television chef and model) was a judge for the first six seasons.\nFor season seven, Carla Hall replaced Pascale on the judges' panel, joining Fuller and Goldman.\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season\n!Episodes\n!Season premiere\n!Season finale\n|-\n!1\n|6\n|\n|\n|-\n!2\n|8\n|\n|\n|-\n!3\n|8\n|\n|\n|-\n!4\n|7\n|\n|\n|-\n!5\n|7\n|\n|\n|-\n!6\n|8\n|\n|\n|-\n!7\n|8\n|\n|\n|-\n!8\n|8\n|\n|\n|-\n!9\n|8\n|\n|\n|-\n!10\n|8\n|\n|\n|-\n!11\n|8\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
