      "text": "# 1934 college football rankings\n\nAlabama\n}}\nThe 1934 college football rankings included a poll of leading newspapers conducted by the Associated Press (AP), a poll of 250 sports writers conducted by the committee responsible for awarding the Toledo Cup to the nation's top college football team, and the Boand and Dickinson Systems, mathematical systems operated by William F. Boand and Frank G. Dickinson. The four ranking systems were unanimous in selecting the undefeated Minnesota Golden Gophers as the national champion. Professor Dickinson gave the nod to Minnesota even though one-loss Pittsburgh received a higher mathematical score.\nChampions (by ranking)\nAll major rankings (both contemporary and retroactive) have identified either Alabama or Minnesota to have been the season's champion.\n*AP poll: Minnesota\n*Berryman QPRS: Alabama\n*Billingsley Report: Minnesota\n*Boand System: Minnesota\n*College Football Researchers Association: Minnesota\n*Dickinson System: Minnesota\n*Dunkel System: Alabama\n*Helms Athletic Foundation: Minnesota\n*Houlgate System: Alabama\n*Litkenhous Ratings: Minnesota8\n*National Championship Foundation: Minnesota\n*Poling System: Alabama\n*Toledo Cup: Minnesota\n*Sagarin Ratings Elo chess method: Minnesota\n*Sagarin Ratings Predictor method: Minnesota\n*Williamson System: Alabama\nNote: AP poll, Boand System, Dickinson System, Dunkel System, Houlgate System, Litkenhous Ratings, Toledo Cup, and Williamson System were given contemporarily. All other methods were given retroactively.\nAssociated Press poll\nIn mid-November 1934, the Associated Press published the results of its poll of the country's leading newspapers. The results of the poll were as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Rank\n! Team\n!

The process was overseen by a committee including Westbrook Pegler, Avery Brundage, Gustavus Kirby, Lynn St. John, Wilbur C. Smith, Stewart Edward White, and Theodore Roosevelt Jr. In preliminary polling in December 1934, the results were as follows:\n1. Minnesota (8–0) - 840 points\n2. Alabama (10–0) - 361-1/4 points\n3. Pittsburgh (8–1) -  281 points\n4. Stanford (9–1–1) - 134-1/2 points\n5. Ohio State (7–1) - 62 points\n6. Temple (7–1–2) - 7 points\n7. Colgate (7–1) - 6 points\n8. LSU (7–2–2) - 4 points\n9. Wisconsin (4–4) - 3 points\n10. (tie) Princeton (7–1), Washington (6–1–1) - 1 point each\nIn final polling in January 1935, the results were as follows:\n1. Minnesota - 224 votes\n2. Alabama - 23 votes\nBoand System\nThe Boand System was a mathematical ranking system developed by William F. Boand and sometimes billed as the \"Azzi Ratem\" (as I rate 'em) system. Boand typically updated his rankings after the bowl games, but his post-bowl rankings have not been found. His final pre-bowl rankings released in mid-December 1934 were as follows:\n1. Minnesota - 150 points\n2. Pittsburgh - 147 points\n3. Stanford - 137 points\n3. Alabama - 137 points\n5. Navy - 135 points\n6. Ohio State - 132 points\n6. Rice - 132 points\n8. Temple - 127 points\n9. Colgate - 125 points\n10. Tennessee - 123 points\n11. Columbia - 122 points\n12. Tulane - 121 points\n13. Illinois - 120 points\n13. Texas - 120 points\n15. Notre Dame - 118 points\n15. LSU - 118 points\n17. Washington - 117 points\nDickinson System\nThe Dickinson System was a mathematical rating system devised by University of Illinois economics professor Frank G. Dickinson. For the first time, Professor Dickinson declared a team as national champion even though it did not receive the highest point total in his mathematical calculations. Professor Dickinson justified the departure based on a provision in his \"code\" providing that an undefeated team should be rated higher than a defeated team, regardless of the point standing. Dickinson's final ratings were as follows:\n1. Minnesota (8–0) - 23.51 points\n2. Pittsburgh (8–1) - 24.19 points\n3. Navy (8–1) - 23.00 points\n4. Illinois (7–1) - 22.01 points\n5. Rice (9–1–1) - 21.97 points\n6. Alabama (10–0) - 21.70 points\n7. Columbia (7–1) - 21.67 points\n8. Ohio State (7–1) - 21.51 points\n9. Colgate (7–1) - 21.06 points\n10. Stanford (9–1–1) - 20.34 points\n11. Tulane (10–1) - 20.03 points\nHoulgate System\nThe Houlgate System rankings for 1934 were as follows:\n1. Stanford (9–1–1) - 32.5\n2. Navy (8–1)\n3. Alabama (10–0)\n4. Pittsburgh (8–1)\n5. Minnesota (8–0)\nSee also\n* 1934 College Football All-America Team\nNotes\nReferences"
