The developers were Arthur Pedula and Ralph Solow. Though forgotten today, Pedula was one of Newark's largest developers. The Ivy Hill Apartments were built with federal and city assistance. The City of Newark sold Pedula and Solow the 31 acres for the apartments, and the federal government, through the Federal Housing Administration, provided $17 million in low interest loans to the developers. Newark further facilitated the apartment buildings construction to allow for cheaper reinforced concrete, rather than structural steel. It is also a nuclear fallout shelter. In 1955, the complex was sold to New York real estate investor and manager Henry Moscowitz, owner of the Argo Corporation. The Ivy Hill apartments were originally solidly middle-class. Nearly a fifth of all residents were transplants from New York City and 22% of the residents commuted into the great metropolis. Throughout the years, it became home to an extremely diverse resident base. In 2011, residents from over 40 countries were represented, totaling up to 10,000 residents, with the sense of the complex being like a mini \"United Nations\". Of the 10,000 residents, 1,000 of them are Russian speakers. Due to its walking proximity to Seton Hall University, many undergraduate and graduate students live here too.

Security guards for the complex, including off-duty Newark police officers, gave \"little resistance\" to gang activity, according to one report. Evictions did not seem to matter since gang members returned to the complex to menace residents.}}\nThe complex was described as \"rough\" with an \"atmosphere of fear.\" Criminal gangs either lived or robbed there, sometimes who slipped through apartment doors \"cracked barely open by frightened residents.\" One gang did stickups in elevators and parking lots to extort cash from victims.\nIn March 2018, the city opened the first police precinct in the neighborhood in 100 years, and the situation is improving. The area is much cleaner and tenants are not afraid to go out to the grocery store or anyplace else. Police patrols have been stepped up.\nReferences"
