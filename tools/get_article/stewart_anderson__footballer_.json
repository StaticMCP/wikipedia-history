He spent the 1936 season as playing coach of Oakleigh, in the Victorian Football Association. Cleared to North Melbourne, Anderson kicked 18 goals in 1937, all from his opening five games of the year. It was enough to see him finish as the season's leading goal-kicker for North Melbourne. His tally remains the equal lowest in the club's history to win the goal-kicking award, having been equaled by Cameron Zurhaar during the 2020 season over 80 years later.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
