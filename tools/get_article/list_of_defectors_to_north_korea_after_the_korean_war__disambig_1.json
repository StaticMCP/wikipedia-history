This list documents those defectors—primarily military personnel—who crossed into North Korea during the post-war period, highlighting their backgrounds, motivations, and the political context surrounding their decisions. While some were driven by ideological convictions, others cited personal grievances or sought refuge from legal or disciplinary consequences. Their stories offer a unique lens into Cold War tensions and the psychological aftermath of one of the 20th century's most brutal conflicts.\nProvided below is a comprehensive list of all these defectors:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Image (if applicable)\n!Name\n!Nationality/Allegiance\n!Details\n!Date\n!Civilian/Military\n!Rank (if applicable)\n|-\n|\n|Larry Allen Abashier\n|United States\n|First American soldier to defect after the war; died in North Korea in 1983.\n|May 28, 1962\n|Military\n|Private\n|-\n|\n|James Joseph Dresnok\n|United States\n|Defected to avoid court-martial; became a prominent propaganda actor; died in North Korea in 2016.\n|Aug 15, 1962\n|Military\n|Private First Class\n|-\n|\n|Jerry Wayne Parrish\n|United States\n|Defected due to personal issues; became an English teacher in Pyongyang; died in North Korea in 1998.\n|Dec 6, 1963\n|Military\n|Corporal\n|-\n|\n|Charles Robert Jenkins\n|United States\n|Defected to avoid Vietnam deployment; allowed to leave for Japan in 2004 with his family; died in 2017.\n|Jan 4, 1965\n|Military\n|Sergeant\n|-\n|\n|Roy Chung (Chung Ryeu-sup)\n|Nationality: South Korea\nAllegiance: United States\n|Disappeared from his unit in West Germany and surfaced in North Korea; cause disputed (family claims abduction); died around 2004.\n|June 5, 1979\n|Military\n|Private First Class\n|-\n|\n|Joseph T.
