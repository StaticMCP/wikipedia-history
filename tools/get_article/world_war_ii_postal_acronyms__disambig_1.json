They were usually written on the back of an envelope.\nThe acronyms, possibly including some more recent additions, include:\n* S.W.A.L.K. — Sealed With A Loving Kiss. A variant is S.W.A.K. (\"Sealed With A Kiss\").\n* V.E.N.I.C.E. — Very Excited Now I Caress Everywhere, Venice\n* E.G.Y.P.T. — Eager to Grab/Eagerly Groping/Grasping Your Pretty Tits, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Egypt\n* B.U.R.M.A. — Be Undressed/Upstairs Ready My Angel, Myanmar / Burma\n* R.A.D.I.O. Romance And Delight I Offer (often used with B.U.R.M.A.)\n* S.I.A.M.
