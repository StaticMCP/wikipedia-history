His elder brother Henry John Adeane (1833–1870) also served as a Member of Parliament.

He was promoted to lieutenant in 1858, commander in 1864, and to captain in 1871. He was in command of the screw sloop  during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879, for which he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). In 1885 he was in command of the ironclad battleship .\nHe was promoted to flag rank as a rear-admiral on 1 January 1888, and was Second in Command of the Channel Squadron for a year from September 1891 to September 1892. Promoted to the rank of vice-admiral on 13 May 1893, and to full admiral on 19 March 1898, he was placed on the Retired List at his own request on 7 December 1901.\nIn 1900 he was elected a member of the Westminster Borough Council. He was Chairman of the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society and a Member of the Metropolitan Asylums Board.\nAdeane died at his residence Jacob's Farm, Sedlescombe, East Sussex, on 18 October 1902. He was buried at Babraham, Cambridgeshire.\nFamily\nAdeane married, in 1875, Lady Edith Dalzell (1843–1909), daughter of Harry Dalzell, 10th Earl of Carnwath. They had a son Captain Henry Robert Augustus Adeane (1882–1914), whose son was Michael Adeane, Baron Adeane.\nReferences"
