Others circulate in Scotland only and still others serve smaller areas. National daily newspapers publish every day except Sundays and 25 December. Sunday newspapers may be independent; e.g. The Observer was an independent Sunday newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by The Guardian in 1993, but more commonly, they have the same owners as one of the daily newspapers, usually with a related name (e.g. The Times and The Sunday Times), but are editorially distinct.\nUK newspapers can generally be split into two distinct categories: the more serious and intellectual newspapers, usually referred to as the broadsheets, and sometimes known collectively as the \"quality press\", and others, generally known as tabloids, and collectively as the 'popular press', which have tended to focus more on celebrity coverage and human interest stories rather than political reporting or overseas news. The tabloids in turn have been divided into the more sensationalist mass market titles, or 'red tops', such as The Sun and the Daily Mirror, and the middle-market papers, the Daily Express and the Daily Mail.\nMost of the broadsheets, so called because of their historically larger size, have changed in recent years to a compact format, the same size as the tabloids. The Independent and The Times were the first to do so. The Guardian moved in September 2005 to what is described as a 'Berliner' format, slightly larger than a compact. Its Sunday stablemate The Observer followed suit. Both The Guardian and The Observer now use the tabloid format, having done so since January 2018. Despite these format changes, these newspapers are all still considered 'broadsheets'.\nOther Sunday broadsheets, including The Sunday Times, which tend to have a large amount of supplementary sections, have kept their larger-sized format. The national Sunday titles usually have a different layout and style from their weekday sister papers, and are produced by separate journalistic and editorial staff.\nAll the major UK newspapers currently have websites, some of which provide free access. The Times and The Sunday Times have a paywall requiring payment on a per-day or per-month basis by non-subscribers. The Financial Times business daily also has limited access for non-subscribers. The Independent became available online only upon its last printed edition on 26 March 2016. However, unlike the previously mentioned newspapers, it does not require any payment to access its news content. Instead the newspaper offers extras for those wishing to sign up to a payment subscription, such as crosswords, Sudoku puzzles, weekend supplements and the ability to automatically download each daily edition to read offline. The London Economic is another example of a British digital/online only newspaper; however, unlike The Independent it has never run a print publication. Alongside traditional outlets, newer digital-first publications such as [https://thescone.co.uk/ The Scone] have emerged, offering a satirical take on UK headlines.\nMost towns and cities in the UK have at least one local newspaper, such as the Evening Post in Bristol and The Echo in Cardiff. Local newspapers were listed in advertising guides such as the Mitchell's Press Directories.\nThey are not known nationally for their journalism in the way that (despite much syndication) some city-based newspapers in the USA are (e.g. The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times). An exception to this was the Manchester Guardian, which shortened its name to The Guardian in 1959 and relocated its main operations to London in 1964. The Guardian Media Group produced a Mancunian paper, the Manchester Evening News, until 2010 when along with its other local newspapers in the Greater Manchester area it was sold to Trinity Mirror.\nBroadsheet and former broadsheet newspapers\n:{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!

There are between 50 and 60 Papurau Bro which cover the whole of Wales, plus the Welsh communities of Liverpool and London. Papers are frequently named after local features, connections, crafts, etc., or in dialect (; all imply 'gossip'). The first papur bro (Y Dinesydd) appeared in 1973 in Cardiff, and the following decade saw the establishment of most of the others. Much of the work of producing the papers is done voluntarily (aside from the printing), although financial support is given by Bwrdd yr Iaith (Welsh Language Board). Some of the papers listed may have ceased publication.\n* Y Glorian (The Scales) – Top of the Rhondda valley, Tonpentre, Rhondda\n* Y Glorian – Llangefni, Anglesey\n* Goriad (The Key) – Bangor and Port Dinorwic\n* Yr Hogwr (The Sharpener) – Bridgend area\n* Llafar Bro (Area Speech) – Blaenau Ffestiniog and District, Gwynedd\n* Llais (The Voice) – Tawe valley, Swansea\n* Llais Aeron (The Voice of Aeron) – Aeron valley, Ceredigion\n* Llais Ardudwy (The Voice of Ardudwy) – Ardudwy, Gwynedd\n* Llais Ogwan (The Voice of Ogwen) – Ogwen valley, Bethesda, Gwynedd\n* Llanw Llŷn (The Flow of Llŷn (postcode area)) – Llŷn Peninsula, Pwllheli, Gwynedd\n* Lleu – Dyffryn Nantlle, Caernarfon\n* Y Llien Gwyn (The White Sheet) – Fishguard and District, Pembrokeshire\n* Y Lloffwr (The Gleaner) – Dinefwr area, Carmarthen\n*Nene – Ponciau, Penycae, Johnstown and Rhosllannerchrugog, Wrexham\n* Yr Odyn (The Kiln) – Conwy valley, Llanrwst, Conwy\n* Papur Fama (Moel Famau mountain Paper) – Mold and District, Flintshire\n* Papur Menai (The Menai Paper) – Menai strait east of Penmon, Anglesey\n* Papur Pawb ''(Everybody's Paper)'' – Talybont, Taliesin, Tre'r Ddol, Ceredigion\n* Papur Y Cwm (The Valley Paper) – Gwendraeth valley, Llanelli, Carmarthenshire\n* Y Pentan (The Ingle-nook) – Conwy Valley and estuary\n* Pethe Penllyn (Penllyn Things) – five parishes of Penllyn, Bala, Gwynedd\n* ''Plu'r Gweunydd (Cotton Grass) – Y Foel, Llangadfan, Llanerfyl, Llanfair Caereinion, Adfa, Cefn Coch, Llwydiarth, Llangynyw, Dolanog, Rhiwhiraeth, Pontrobert, Meifod and Welshpool, Powys\n* Y Rhwyd (The Net) – North West Anglesey\n* Seren Hafren (The Star of the Severn) – Severn Valley, Newtown, Powys\n* Tafod-Elai (The Tongue of the Ely) – Taff Ely, Cardiff\n* Tafod Tafwys (The Tongue of the Thames) – for Welsh learners in London\n* Y Tincer (The Tinker) – Mouths of the Glyn, Llangorwen, Tirymynach, Tremeurig and Borth valleys, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion\n* Tua'r Goleuni (Towards the Light) – Rhymney valley, Caerphilly\n* Wilia – Swansea and District\n* Yr Wylan (The Seagull) – Penrhyndeudraeth, Porthmadog, Beddgelert and District, Gwynedd\n* Yr Ysgub (The Wheatsheaf) – Ceiriog, Tanat and Cain valleys, Powys\n}}\nNon-English-language newspapers\nSeveral newspapers in languages other than English are published in Britain, for immigrant and expatriate readers.
