Smith and illustrated by Matt Wuerker. It was published in 2004 by Common Courage Press in Canada. Alternating between text and cartoons, it takes a critical look at George W. Bush's life and first term as president of the United States, portraying it all as a rush to war in Iraq.\nReception\nPublishers Weekly gave the book a negative review. Peter C. Newman, writing for The Globe and Mail,  called it \"a delicious send-up with nothing held back\".\nReferences"
