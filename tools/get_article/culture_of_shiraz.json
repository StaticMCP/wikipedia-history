It contains a former royal mansion, a historical weapons museum, and a Persian garden, all open to the public.]]\nThe culture of Shiraz concerns the arts, music, museums, festivals, many Persian entertainments and sports activities in Shiraz, the capital of Fars province. Shiraz is known as the city of poets, gardens, wine, nightingales and flowers. The crafts of Shiraz consist of inlaid mosaic work of triangular design; silver-ware; carpet-weaving, and the making of the rugs called gilim (Shiraz Kilim), and blankets called Jajim found in the villages and among the tribes.\nAccording to some sources, Shiraz is the heartland of Persian culture.\nThe garden is an important part of Iranian culture. There are many old gardens in Shiraz such as the Eram garden and the Afif abad garden. According to some people, Shiraz \"disputes with Xeres (or Jerez) in Spain the honour of being the birthplace of sherry.\" Shirazi wine originates from the city; however, under the current Islamic regime, alcohol is prohibited except for religious minorities.\nShiraz is proud of being mother land of Hafiz Shirazi, Shiraz is a center for Iranian culture and has produced a number of famous poets. Saadi, a 12th- and 13th-century poet was born in Shiraz. He left his native town at a young age for Baghdad to study Arabic literature and Islamic sciences at Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad. When he reappeared in his native Shiraz he was an elderly man. Shiraz, under Atabak Abubakr Sa'd ibn Zangy (1231–1260) was enjoying an era of relative tranquility. Saadi was not only welcomed to the city but he was highly respected by the ruler and enumerated among the greats of the province. He seems to have spent the rest of his life in Shiraz. Hafiz, another famous poet and mystic was also born in Shiraz. A number of scientists also originate from Shiraz. Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi, a 13th-century astronomer, mathematician, physician, physicist and scientist was from Shiraz. In his The Limit of Accomplishment concerning Knowledge of the Heavens, he also discussed the possibility of heliocentrism.\nCuisine\nand Shirazi salad]]\n]]\nThere are many restaurants and cafes in Shiraz, both modern and classic, serving both Iranian and cosmopolitan cuisine. Shiraz wine is famous both in Iran and in the world. By the ninth century, the city of Shiraz had already established a reputation for producing the finest wine in the world, and was the \"Iran's wine capital\". The export of Shiraz wine by European merchants in the 17th century has been documented. As described by enthusiastic English and French travellers to the region in the 17th to 19th centuries, the wine grown close to the city was of a more dilute character due to irrigation, while the best Shiraz wines were actually grown in terraced vineyards around the village of Khollar. These wines were white and existed in two different styles: dry wines for drinking young, and sweet wines meant for aging. The latter wines were compared to \"an old sherry\" (one of the most prized European wines of the day), and at five years of age were said to have a fine bouquet and nutty flavour. The dry white Shiraz wines (but not the sweet ones) were fermented with significant stem contact, which should have made these wines rather phenolic, i.e., rich in tannins.\nShirazi salad ( sālād shirāzi) is an Iranian salad that originated from and is named after Shiraz. It is a relatively modern dish, dating to sometime after the introduction of the tomato to Iran at the end of the nineteenth century. Its primary ingredients are cucumber, tomato, onion, olive oil, herbal spices and verjuice, although lime juice is sometimes used in its preparation. Shirazi faloodeh (or Paloodeh) () is a special version of Faloodeh from the city of Shiraz, is particularly well-known.\nFestivals and holidays\nIranian festivals\nNowruz\nIran's official New Year begins with Nowruz, an ancient Iranian tradition celebrated annually on the vernal equinox.
