In the attack, two Israelis, a father and his son, residents of Ashdod, were murdered.\nThe attack\nTwo Israelis from Ashdod, Shai Sailas Nigrker, 60, and his son Aviv (Nigrker) Nir, 29, arrived in Huwara on Saturday, August 19, 2023, to service their car. After several hours of repairs, the two were at a car wash on Highway 60 south of Hawara. Around 3:04pm, a Palestinian militant arrived, shot them and ran away.\nAfter the attack, the Palestine Red Crescent Society arrived to provide first aid to the victims who were critically wounded. A Magen David Adom team that arrived at the scene pronounced the two victims dead.\nHundreds of soldiers conducted searches to locate the perpetrator.\nOn August 26, a week after the attack, Hamas claimed responsibility.\nReferences"
