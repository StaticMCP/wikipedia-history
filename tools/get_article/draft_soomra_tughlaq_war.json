One of his generals, Taghi, rebelled against him and fled to lower Sindh, where he was sheltered by the Soomras.\nWith support from the Mongol commander Amir Farghan and the Samma ruler Jam Unar, the Soomras prepared to attack the Tughlaq forces in Sindh.\nThe War\nThe Soomra forces, led by Sultan Hamir bin Dodo IV Soomro, attacked the Tughlaq imperial army from the rear, while the Mongols struck from the front.\nThe combined armies looted and plundered the imperial camp, seized wealth, captured harems, and inflicted heavy losses on the Tughlaq forces.\nAftermath\nThe defeat at Hyderabad severely weakened Tughlaq influence in Sindh. The Soomra alliance with Taghi, the Mongols, and the Sammas ensured that the Delhi Sultanate could not consolidate its power in the region.\nSee also\n* Soomra dynasty\n* Tughlaq dynasty\n* Samma dynasty\n* Taghi (rebel)\nReferences"
