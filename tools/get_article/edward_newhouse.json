      "text": "# Edward Newhouse\n\nEdward Newhouse (November 10, 1911 – November 11, 2002) was a short story author and staff writer for The New Yorker. He was born Ede Ujhazi in Hungary and was married to Dorothy DeLay. Edward wrote proletarian novels in the 1930s, and many short stories about life, and he worked for almost thirty years with the New Yorker. He was a friend of many of the literary giants of the 20th century. His writings from 1929 to 1965 were instructive for both an understanding of the radical mindset and as an example of the late manifestation of American literary realism. He retired from a literary career in the year 1965. He also helped story movies like I Want You and Shadow in the Sky.\nDuring World War II, Newhouse served as a major in the U.S. Army. In 1945, he was one of 16 Army officers and enlisted men singled out as alleged Communists by the House Committee on Military Affairs. General \"Wild Bill\" Donovan came to their defense, citing their loyalty and effectiveness.\nSelected bibliography\nNovels\n*''You Can't Sleep Here (1934)\n*This Is Your Day (1937)\n*The Hollow of the Wave (1950)\n*The Temptation of Roger Heriott (1954)\nShort story collections\n*Anything Can Happen (1941)\n*The Iron Chain (1946)\n*Many Are Called (1951)\nShort stories\nAll stories published in The New Yorker except as noted.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!
