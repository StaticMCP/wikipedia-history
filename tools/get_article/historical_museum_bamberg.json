This is regarded as the birth of the museum. In the following century the museum continuously added new objects to the collection.\nThe museum was located in the Michaelsberg Abbey until 1935. In 1938 it was moved in the Alte Hofhaltung, near the cathedral of Bamberg.\nCollection\nThe Historical Museum Bamberg owns a  fund of historical objects, which range from the prehistory to the current century. Beside a  large art collection and stone sculptures,  there are several handicraft objects,  clocks from the 16th–19th centuries and a wide range of coins from numerous different ages.\nFurthermore, the Historical Museum Bamberg has a  collection of astronomical and mathematical tools, as well as a compilation of nativity scenes exhibited during the Christmas season.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bamberg.de/museum Bamberg City Museum website]"
