The leader of the rebel army, Murat Kuchukov, was wounded, captured, and eventually executed.\nHistory\nIn 1708, the teachings and propaganda of Murat Kuchukov led to an uprising of the North Caucasians against Russia. Raids by the mountaineers on the Russian fortification of Terki began increasing and in February of the same year, having gathered 1,500 to 1,600+ fighters, Kuchukov invaded the city, aiming to break through the Russian border and march to Bashkiria, where he planned to join the Bashkir rebels.\nOn February 12, 1708, the rebels launched an attack on the city. The garrison of the city was poorly equipped and prepared, and its soldiers were outnumbered by the forces of Murat. The attack ended by 4 o'clock in the afternoon and resulted in a major victory for the mountaineers, who established control over most of the city. During the battle and after it, many fortifications and administrative buildings were burned and destroyed. The defenders suffered heavy casualties, with most being either killed or captured. The attackers also captured 10 cannons. However, there were parts of the city which the rebels failed to capture.\nThe Russian side hastily began a counter offensive. Fyodor Apraksin, with a detachment 1,200 strong, together with his ally Ayuka Khan of the Kalmyk Khanate, who commanded an army 3,000 strong, invaded the city and scored a decisive victory over the mountaineers on February 26, which forced the latter to retreat.\nMeanwhile, Murat Kuchukov was captured and brought in front of the tsar, Peter the Great, who sentenced him to death. He was hanged in Kazan the same year.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
