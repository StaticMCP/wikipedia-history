A pre-1.0 CPython user, he was among the group of early adopters who contributed to the detailed design of the language in its early stages.\nHe later created the Timsort algorithm (based on earlier work on the use of \"galloping\" search) which is used in Python since version 2.3 (since version 3.11 using the Powersort merge policy instead of Timsort's original merge policy), as well as in other widely used computing platforms, including the V8 JavaScript engine powering the Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers, as well as Node.js. He has also contributed the doctest and timeit modules to the Python standard library.\nPeters also wrote the Zen of Python, intended as a statement of Python's design philosophy, which was incorporated into the official Python literature as Python Enhancement Proposal 20 and in the Python interpreter as an easter egg. He contributed the [https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/python-cookbook/0596001673/ch17.html chapter on algorithms] to the Python Cookbook. From 2001 to 2014 he was active as a member of the Python Software Foundation's board of directors. Peters was an influential contributor to Python mailing lists. He is also a highly ranked contributor to Stack Overflow, mostly for answers relating to Python.\nPeters' past employers include Kendall Square Research.\nTim Peters was granted the Python Software Foundation's [https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-distinguished-awards/#id4 Distinguished Service Award for 2017].\nSee also\n* History of Python\nReferences/Notes and references\nExternal links\n* [http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/video-index.html#interview-with-tim-peters PyCon 2006 interview with Tim Peters]\n* [https://stackoverflow.com/users/2705542/tim-peters Stack Overflow user page]\n* [http://www.pythonlabs.com/ PythonLabs.com]"
