The so-called Tarlow Redoubt was a fortified position of the Russians, located on a hill. Both sides suffered heavy losses, especially 1st Battalion of 1st Legions Infantry Regiment, commanded by Major Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Soldiers were buried in mass graves: after World War I, all bodies were moved to a parish cemetery, where a military quarter was created. In July 1929, local community of Tarlow funded a monument dedicated to the soldiers of the Legions.\nThe Battle of Tarlow is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \"TARLOW 30 VI – 2 VII 1915\". The inscription was removed after 1945 by Communist authorities, to return in 1990.\nSources\n* Mieczysław Wrzosek, Polski czyn zbrojny podczas pierwszej wojny światowej 1914–1918, Państwowe Wydawnictwo \"Wiedza Powszechna\", Warszawa 1990"
