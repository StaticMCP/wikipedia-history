(stylized in all caps, often subtitled Soundtrack Of Life) was an American privately held audio manufacturer based in Michigan. Founded in 2011 by Scott Hix, Seth Combs, and Kevin Lee, it was sold to HoMedics in late 2015 or early 2016.\nSome of Sol Republic's best-selling products included the Tracks on-ear headphones, whose couplets are interchangeable with the included headband.\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 2010 by Scott Hix, Seth Combs, and Kevin Lee. Lee had worked at Beats Audio, while Hix had been an executive with InFocus. Lee's father, Noel Lee, founded video and audio cable company Monster. The name is an acronym for \"soundtrack of life\". By December 2011, the company had 33 employees split between headquarters in Wilsonville, Oregon, and San Francisco, California. In July 2011, the company received $5.2 million in investment funding, followed by $22 million in July 2012. Sol Republic introduced its DECK portable speaker in August 2013 in partnership with Motorola Mobility; the system was designed to work with the Motorola Moto X.  At that time the company had grown to 85 employees.\nThe company raised another $27 million in March 2014, by which time it was employing 100 people and had its products in 26,000 retail stores. The funding came from Riverwood Capital and Greenoaks Capital Management, and was expected to be used to expand into international markets as well as new product development. Sol Republic's main distribution channels at that time were through Apple, RadioShack, and Best Buy.\nIn 2014, the President of Sol Republic, Scott Hix, gave up his duties to co-founder and CEO Kevin Lee. Hix still owns a major portion of the company and is still considered a co-founder.

They were also purchased by HMDX audio, and had their headquarters relocated to the same location as HMDX. In this merger, many of the styles of Tracks were discontinued, including their college and musician styles, as well as some of their Bluetooth devices, such as the Deck speaker and Tracks Air headphones. They also switched from using custom made and sized boxes for shipping to using generic packaging.\nProducts\nSol Republic manufacturers a variety of audio products, such as headphones, portable speakers, and ear buds. To help in marketing the products, the company has partnered with musicians and DJs such as Calvin Harris, Deadmau5 and Steve Aoki.
