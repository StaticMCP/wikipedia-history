The station now plays six different shows, each of which is hosted by one of the six playable characters. Billy is the star of sitcom \"I'm Grounded\", Angelica heads the soap opera \"Sundaes of Our Lives\", Bryce is the host of \"Mysteries Shmysteries\", 'Sopha Sinfree' runs a talk show named after herself, and Ernie is the host behind \"What's That Smell?\". Not among the playable cast are newshost Mary Carp and her cohost, John.\nGameplay\nClub 3DO: Station Invasion is a game in which kids solve puzzles to gain rating points.\nDevelopment\nDevelopment of Club 3DO: Station Invasion was led by Ed Rotberg, previously a key figure on the classic Atari arcade shooter Battlezone. Station Invasion was conceived as an \"edutainment\" title at the behest of The 3DO Company head Trip Hawkins. As an educational game, Rotberg felt it was \"not as big a success as we would have liked,\" blaming its insufficient content on time and budget restrictions. Rotberg lamented, \"If we had DVD back then, it could have been a whole lot better. And it was done in 8 and a half months. Which is the amazing thing considering all the video and the content it did have in it. The team I had doing that were total champions.\"\n|NGen      =\n|rev1      = 3DO Magazine\n|rev1Score =\n|rev2      = Electronic Games\n|rev2Score = D+\n|rev3      = VideoGames\n|rev3Score = 6/10\n}}\nNext Generation reviewed the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"If you're under eight, it's a scream.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/3do/584505-station-invasion Club 3DO: Station Invasion] at GameFAQs\n* [https://www.mobygames.com/game/club-3do-station-invasion Club 3DO: Station Invasion] at MobyGames"
