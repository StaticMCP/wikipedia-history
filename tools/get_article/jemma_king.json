After leaving school she worked briefly as a fashion model and performed stunt-double work on Police Academy 7 before turning full-time to psychology.\nShe earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and a first-class Honours degree in Business Management at UQ, then completed a PhD in Human Behaviour at the UQ Business School. Her thesis, Emotional intelligence and its effects on biomarkers of workplace stress (2020), examined cortisol responses to cyber-ostracism and laid the foundation for her later applied programmes.\nCareer\nSince 2020 King has held an honorary research fellowship at UQ's School of Psychology, supervising postgraduate projects on stress, sleep and resilience. She has published peer-reviewed work on military populations, including a 2023 Military Medicine study that linked sleep-wake consistency with psychological resilience among U.S. Army soldiers stationed in the Arctic.\nKing developed a pre-deployment \"Performance Optimisation Program\" for military personnel, the programme has since been extended to high-performance sport organisations such as the Australian Olympic swim team. In the private sector she is the director of BioPsychAnalytics, advises McKinsey & Company, and delivers leadership modules for the University of Sydney MBA program and for the Australian Defence College.\nIn 2024, the ABC's Australian Story profiled her friendship with Olympic swimmer Shayna Jack, describing King as a \"human behaviourist\" who helped the athlete rebuild resilience after a high-profile doping case.\nPersonal life\nKing lives in Brisbane and is the mother of three children.\nAwards and recognition\nAt the eighteenth Global Wellness Summit in St Andrews, Scotland, in November 2024, King and Wim Hof received the Bennett Family Award for Collaboration in the Science of Wellness.\nReferences"
