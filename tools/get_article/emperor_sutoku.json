Sutoku was the eldest son of Emperor Toba. Some old texts say he was instead the son of Toba's grandfather, Emperor Shirakawa.\n*Chūgū: Fujiwara no Kiyoko (藤原 聖子) later Kōkamon'in (皇嘉門院), Fujiwara no Tadamichi's daughter\n* Hyounosuke-no-Tsubone (兵衛佐局), Minamoto no Masamune's adopted daughter\n** First son: Imperial  (1140–1162).\n* Mikawa-dono (三河), Minamoto no Morotsune's daughter\n** Fifth Son: Kakue (覚恵; 1151–1184)\n* Karasuma-no-Tsubone (烏丸局)\nEvents of Sutoku's life\n* February 25, 1123 (Hōan 4, 28th day of the 1st month): In the 16th year of Emperor Toba's reign (鳥羽天皇二十五年), he abdicated; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his son, aged 3.\n* Hōan 4, in the 2nd month (1123): Emperor Sutoku is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).\n* 1124 (Tenji 1, 2nd month): Former-Emperor Shirakawa and former-Emperor Toba went in carriages to outside the city where they could all together enjoy contemplating the flowers. Taiken-mon'in (? – August 26, 1145) (formerly Fujiwara no Shōshi), who was Toba's empress and Sutoku's mother, joined the procession along with many other women of the court.  Their cortege was brilliant and colorful.  A great many men of the court in hunting clothes followed the ladies in this parade.  Fujiwara no Tadamichi then followed in a carriage, accompanied by bands of musicians and women who were to sing for the emperors.\n* 1124 (Tenji 1, 10th month): Shirakawa visited Mount Kōya.\n* 1125 (Tenji 2, 10th month): The emperor visited Iwashimizu Shrine and the Kamo Shrines; and afterwards, he also visited the shrines Hirano, Ōharano, Mutsunoo, Kitano, Gion and several others.\n* 1128 (Daiji 3, 3rd month): Taiken-mon'in ordered the construction of Enshō-ji in fulfillment of a sacred vow.  This was one in a series of \"sacred vow temples\" (gogan-ji) built by imperial command following a precedent established by Emperor Shirakawa's Hosshō-ji.\n* 1128 (Daiji 3, 6th month): Fujiwara no Tadamichi is relieved of his responsibilities and duties as sesshō (regent); and simultaneously, Tadamichi is named kampaku.\n* August 17, 1135 (Hōen 1, 7th day of the 7th month): Former-Emperor Shirakawa died at the age of 77.\n* 1141 (Eiji  1, 3rd month): The former emperor Toba accepted the tonsure in becoming a monk at the age of 39.\nIn 1151, Sutoku ordered Waka imperial anthology Shika Wakashū.\nIn 1156, after being defeated by forces loyal to Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the Hōgen Rebellion, he was exiled to Sanuki Province (modern-day Kagawa prefecture on the island of Shikoku).\nEmperor Sutoku's reign lasted for 19 years: 2 years in the nengō Tenji, 5 years in Daiji, 1 year in 'Tenshō, 3 years in Chōshō, 6 years in Hōen, and 1 year in Eiji.\nThe site of Sutoku's grave is settled.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) in Sakaide, Kagawa. He was also enshrined (or sealed away ...) in Shiramine Shrine in Kyoto and Kotohira-gū in Kagawa Prefecture. The former is also associated with the god of football, worshipped by Kuge clan Asukai in times of yore, while the latter enshrined Ō-mono-nushi-no-mikoto, a god known to have restored harmony in Yamato (or blackmailed Emperor Sujin ...) in exchange for worship and nepotism.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Sutoku's mausoleum.  It is formally named Shiramine no misasagi.\nKugyō\nKugyō (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Sutoku's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:\n* Sesshō, Fujiwara no Tadamichi, 1097–1164.\n* Daijō-daijin, Fujiwara no Tadamichi.\n* Sadaijin\n* Udaijin\n* Nadaijin, Fujiwara no Yorinaga, 1120–1156.\n* Dainagon\nEras of Sutoku's reign\nThe years of Sutoku's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.\n* Hōan (1120–1124)\n* Tenji (1124–1126)\n* Daiji (1126–1131)\n* Tenshō (1131–1132)\n* Chōshō (1132–1135)\n* Hōen (1135–1141)\n* Eiji (1141–1142)\nLegends\n]]\nAfter Sutoku's abdication and exile, he devoted himself to monastic life.  He copied numerous scriptures and offered them to the court.  Fearing that the scriptures were cursed, the court refused to accept them. Snubbed, Sutoku was said to have resented the court and, upon his death, became an .  Everything from the subsequent fall in fortune of the Imperial court, the rise of the samurai powers, droughts and internal unrests were blamed on his haunting.\nAlong with Sugawara no Michizane and Taira no Masakado, he is often called one of the “”.\nLiterary works from the Edo period such as  and  and ukiyo-e paintings by Utagawa Yoshitsuya depict Emperor Sutoku as an .\nIn 2023, the heavy metal band Onmyo-Za produced the song , about Emperor Sutoku as a .\nAncestry\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* Goryō\n* Imperial cult\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Shin Heike Monogatari (Taiga Drama), Masakazu Tamura played Emperor Sutoku.\nNotes\n— a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nReferences\n* Brown, Delmer M. and Ichirō Ishida, eds.
