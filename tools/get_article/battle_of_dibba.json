The graves of the fallen can still be seen in the area.\nAl Azd\nWhen the Persian Sasanian Empire waned, the Al Azd kings became the major political force in the Oman peninsula. The Islamic prophet Muhammad sent a messenger, Amr ibn Al As, who passed through Buraimi and presented his letter to the Sasanian governor, who rejected Muhammad's message. Al As went on to present his message at Nizwar to the Al Azdi Ruler, Abd Al-Juland and his brother Jayfar, who ruled the interior of the Oman peninsula. The brothers brought together the elders of the Al Azd tribe, who agreed that they should convert to Islam.\nIn 630 CE, the Al Azd allied with the Julanda and attacked the Sasanian governor Maskan and defeated Maskan's forces at Damsetjerd in Sohar, killing Maskan. Leaving behind all their silver and gold, the overwhelmed Sasanians were expelled from the country. Upon Muhammad's death in 632, Abd travelled to Medina to swear fealty to the Caliph Abu Bakr, who received him with pleasure.\nUprisings\nA series of apostate uprisings took place across Arabia, the suppression of which became known as the Ridda Wars, with a series of commanders dispatched to put down the rebellions. Abu Bakr sent two commanders to Oman, Hudhayfa bin Mihsan Al Ghalfani, a Yemeni Himyarite and Arfajah, an Azdi. These were to support the Julanda kings against any dissident Al Azdis.\nThe leader of the apostates of Oman was Laqit bin Malik Al-Azdi, known as 'the one with the crown', or ''Dhu'l Taj''. A natural rival to the Julanda kings, he forced them into retreat before the army from Medina completed its arduous journey through the Rub Al Khali to reach the Oman peninsula. Meeting up with the Madinan army, the forces of the Julanda were bolstered by tribes from the region who deserted Laqit.\nAn important market town and port, Dibba sustained a busy trade with the Indies and Far East, landing goods from Alexandria and Rome as well as other markets as far afield as China. It was wealthy and arguably influential – Laqit bin Malik was a leader backed by considerable resources.\nBattle\nThe combined force then marched on Dibba, then described as 'a great market and town'. Laqit found early success in the ensuing battle, placing his men's families behind their lines in order to encourage them to fight harder. However, the Medinan army prevailed following the arrival of reinforcements, the Beni Abdul Kais and Beni Najia tribes who had formed part of the Caliph's army but who had been delayed during the long journey from Medina. Contemporary texts put the death toll at 10,000, although this number was frequently used to signify a large battle rather than being taken as an absolute. The town of Dibba was looted and the captives, one fifth of the treasure and the livestock of the town were sent as tribute to Abu Bakr.\nThe Omani commander, Hudhayfah, stayed to consolidate the Muslim hold on the territory of Oman while his fellow commander left to pacify Yemen. A third commander, Ikramah, who had failed in Yamama and been censured by Abu Bakr, was sent back to the Caliph accompanying the spoils in order to redeem himself, a generous gesture by his co-commanders.\nThe phrase 'Day of Dibba' is still used, signifying the defeat of paganism by Islam.\nReferences\nExternal links\n[https://www.thecollector.com/ridda-wars-arabia-wars-explained/ The Ridda Wars Explained]\n[https://madainproject.com/timeline_of_ridda_wars Timeline of Ridda Wars]"
