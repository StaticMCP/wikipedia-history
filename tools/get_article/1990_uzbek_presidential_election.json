The only candidate in the election was the then acting First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist party of the Uzbekistan SSR (as part of the CPSU), the de facto leader of the Republic since June 23 1989 — Islam Abdughaniyevich Karimov. Thus, the first and last presidential elections in the history of the Uzbekistan SSR were held on an uncontested basis. The president of the Republic was elected by newly elected deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbekistan SSR of the 12th (last) convocation. Shukrulla Mirsaidov was elected Vice-President of the Republic.\n]]\nResults\n498 out of 500 deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbekistan SSR took part in the voting. Of these, 491 deputies (98.2%) supported the candidacy of Islam Karimov, and 7 deputies (1.8%) voted against. Two deputies were absent. Thus, Islam Karimov was elected president of the Uzbekistan SSR with an overwhelming number of votes, and on the same day began his new duties, continuing in parallel to hold the post of first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Uzbekistan SSR.\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Candidate\n!Party\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|Islam Karimov||OʻzKP||491||98.2\n|-\n|align=left colspan=2|Against||7||1.8\n|-\n|align=left colspan=2|Invalid/blank votes||-||-\n|-\n|align=left colspan=2|Total||498||100\n|-\n|align=left colspan=2|Registered voters/turnout||500||99.6\n|-\n|colspan=4 align=left|\n|}\nReferences"
