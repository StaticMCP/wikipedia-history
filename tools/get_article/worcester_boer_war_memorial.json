The war memorial commemorates casualties of the Second Boer War from the county of Worcestershire.  It was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1999.\nThe memorial comprises a bronze sculptural group mounted on an octagonal Portland stone plinth and base, standing on three steps.  The front of the plinth bears the inscription: 'IN GRATEFUL / MEMORY OF / THE MEN OF / WORCESTER-/ SHIRE WHO IN / SOUTH AFRICA / GAVE THEIR / LIVES FOR THEIR / COUNTRY. / A.D.1899-1902.\" A further inscription on the stone base quotes from Ecclesiasticus: \"Their bodies are buried in peace; / but their name liveth for evermore. Ecclus XLIV 14\"\nThe bronze sculpture by William Robert Colton depicts a soldier of the Worcestershire Regiment, bare-headed and bare-armed, with a bandolier of bullets, kneeling with a bayonet affixed to his rifle held in a high \"ready\" position, in front of a standing winged female figure (interpreted in various sources as an angel, or a Winged Victory, or a personification of \"Immortality\") with her left hand gripping a sheathed sword girt with a laurel wreath and the right holding an olive branch (or possibly a  palm branch) over the head of the soldier.\nThe memorial was unveiled on 23 September 1908 by General Sir Neville Lyttelton, on a site to the north of Worcester Cathedral.  It stands close to the passing A44.\nFile:In Grateful Memory - geograph.org.uk - 2273693.jpg|The memorial stands on the north side of Worcester Cathedral\nFile:William Colton, South African War Memorial Worcester.jpg|Side view\nSee also\n* Royal Artillery Boer War Memorial\nReferences\n* [https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1389731?section=official-list-entry South African War Memorial], National Heritage List for England, Historic England\n* [https://www.warmemorialsonline.org.uk/memorial/92078 Worcester (Men of Worcestershire South African/Boer War sculpture], War Memorials Online\n* [https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/32254 Men Of Worcestershire South African War], Imperial War Museums\n* [http://www.speel.me.uk/sculptplaces/worcester.htm Statues in Worcester]"
