Taking advantage of the internal dynastic struggles within the Hasmonean Kingdom and the political instability of the Nabataean Kingdom, Tigranes marched south into the Levant with a large Armenian army. The campaign resulted in the temporary submission of both Judea and Nabataea to Armenian influence, marking the furthest southern expansion of the Armenian Empire.\nKingdom of Armenia\n| combatant2    =  Hasmonean Kingdom of Judea   Nabataean Kingdom\n| commander1    =  Tigranes the Great Mithrobarzanes\n| commander2    =  Alexander Jannaeus   Salome Alexandra   Aretas III\n| strength1     = 50,000–70,000 (estimated Armenian army)\n| strength2     = Unknown\n| casualties1   = Unknown\n| casualties2   = >10,000 prisoners\n}}\nBackground\nAt the height of his reign, Tigranes II had established Armenia as a dominant regional empire stretching from the Caucasus to Mesopotamia. With the decline of the Seleucid Empire in Syria and the ongoing civil conflicts in Judea, the southern Levant became an attractive target for expansion. The Nabataeans, who controlled lucrative caravan routes, were also in a vulnerable position due to internal political shifts.\nThe campaign likely formed part of Tigranes’ broader strategy to secure control over the trade networks connecting Mesopotamia, Syria, and Arabia, ensuring Armenia’s dominance over eastern Mediterranean commerce.\nThe Campaign\nTigranes reportedly led an army of 50,000–70,000 men south through Syria, overwhelming local resistance. The Armenian forces entered Judea, where the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus and later Queen Salome Alexandra were forced to submit to Armenian suzerainty.\nMoving further south, Tigranes confronted the Nabataean Kingdom. Although details are scarce, ancient sources suggest a rapid campaign near Petra, after which King Aretas III recognized Armenian overlordship, either through force or diplomacy.\nAftermath\nThe campaign extended Armenian influence into the southern Levant for several years. However, this control proved temporary. The growing pressure from Rome and the resurgence of Parthia would eventually force Tigranes to abandon his southern holdings, including Judea and Nabataea, in the 60s BC.\nNevertheless, the campaign demonstrated the military and political reach of Armenia at its imperial zenith and remains one of the furthest documented expansions of Tigranes’ empire.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Tigranes the Great\n* Hasmonean dynasty\n* Nabataean Kingdom\n* Military Campaigns of Tigranes the Great"
