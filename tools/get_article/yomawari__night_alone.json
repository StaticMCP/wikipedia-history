Stones can be used as thrown items or landmarks, the shovel to dig up specific spots such as sand and money as currency to be used in certain places, such as peace offerings. The heartbeat system is used to alert players if a monster is nearby, making the girl move slower and force her actions to be limited. The only way to hide from the monsters is to evade them after observing their patterns or hide in areas like bushes and wait for them to go away with the heartbeat serving as a de facto radar to locate where the monsters are while relying on sounds to make a judgement call to see if its safe to come out of hiding.\nIn case players need to refresh themselves on what happened the previous nights, they can catch up again by reading the girl's diary.\nPlot\nA young girl takes her dog named Poro out for a walk.
