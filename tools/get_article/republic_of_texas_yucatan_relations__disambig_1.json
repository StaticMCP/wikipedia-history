Relations effectively began in 1841 when Yucatán seceded from Mexico, and ended upon the annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845.\nSecession from Mexico\nTexas and Yucatán, both territories of Mexico, were resistant to the order of the Mexican government and each decided to secede. The two territories' reasons for secession differed, but nonetheless they shared a common goal of independence. Texas seceded first in 1836, and Yucatán seceded in 1841 with help from Texan naval forces.\nDisputes with Mexico\nConflict with Mexico did not end for either republic after independence. The battle on land became minimal but the battle at sea raged on, and the two republics had to strengthen their alliance in order to survive as sovereign nations. The British Empire supplied the Mexican Navy with ironclads, while France supplied Texas and Yucatán with diplomatic support.\nshowing Yucatán and Texas by Flag.]]\nDiplomatic relations\nYucatán had an embassy in Austin, Texas, while Texas had an embassy in Mérida.\nSee also\n*Texas Revolution\n*Republic of Yucatan\n*Republic of Texas\n*Republic of Texas – Mexico relations\n*Secession\n*Naval Battle of Campeche\nReferences"
