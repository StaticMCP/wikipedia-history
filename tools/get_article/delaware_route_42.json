It runs  from DE&nbsp;6 in Blackiston east to DE&nbsp;9 in Leipsic. DE&nbsp;42 passes through rural areas along with the towns of Kenton and Cheswold. The route intersects DE&nbsp;300 in Kenton, runs concurrent with DE&nbsp;15 between Seven Hickories and Moores Corner, and crosses U.S. Route&nbsp;13 (US&nbsp;13) in Cheswold. The road was built as a state highway during the 1920s and 1930s. DE&nbsp;42 was designated by 1936 between Kenton and Leipsic and extended to Blackiston by 1966.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;42 begins at an intersection with DE&nbsp;6 in the community of Blackiston. Northwest of DE&nbsp;6, the road becomes Longridge Road, which changes names to Delaney Maryland Line Road and Clayton Delaney Road before it reaches the Maryland border and becomes Maryland Route&nbsp;330 (MD&nbsp;330). MD&nbsp;330 heads west and, by way of MD&nbsp;313, provides access to US&nbsp;301. From the western terminus, DE&nbsp;42 heads southeast on two-lane undivided Blackiston Road. The route runs through agricultural areas with some woods and homes. The road reaches the town of Kenton, where it becomes Commerce Street. In Kenton, the route crosses an abandoned railroad line and passes residences and a few businesses, intersecting with DE&nbsp;300 in the center of town.\nPast Kenton, DE&nbsp;42 heads to the east-southeast on Seven Hickories Road into farmland with woods and residences, crossing Pinks Branch. In Seven Hickories, the route intersects DE&nbsp;15 and the two routes head east for a concurrency. In Moores Corner, DE&nbsp;15 splits from DE&nbsp;42 by turning southeast on Kenton Road before DE&nbsp;42 continues east and intersects Pearsons Corner Road. The road heads east-northeast and passes to the south of Delaware Airpark. The route enters the town of Cheswold, where it becomes Main Street. The road passes homes and some businesses in the town, crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade. DE&nbsp;42 reaches an intersection with US&nbsp;13 on the eastern edge of Cheswold at Bishops Corner.\nAfter the US&nbsp;13 intersection, the route heads northeast on Fast Landing Road. DE&nbsp;42 passes over the DE&nbsp;1 toll road, where it has ramps for emergency vehicles but no public access. The road runs through farmland with some woodland and homes, curving to the east. Farther east, the route turns southeast into marshland adjacent to the Leipsic River, crossing Dyke Branch. DE&nbsp;42 enters the town of Leipsic, where it heads east into residential areas and ends at DE&nbsp;9. Past the eastern terminus, the road continues east as Second Street.\nDE&nbsp;42 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 7,654&nbsp;vehicles at the eastern border of Cheswold to a low of 536&nbsp;vehicles at the eastern terminus at DE&nbsp;9.\nHistory\nBy 1920, what is now DE&nbsp;42 existed as an unimproved county road. The road was completed as a state highway between Kenton and Lepisic four years later. The route was under construction as a state highway between Blackiston and Kenton by 1932. By 1936, DE&nbsp;42 was assigned to its current alignment between DE&nbsp;300 in Kenton and DE&nbsp;9 in Leipsic and the state highway between Blackiston and Kenton was completed. By 1966, the route was extended to Blackiston.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Western terminus\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=West end of DE&nbsp;15 overlap\n}}\n|notes=East end of DE&nbsp;15 overlap\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-042/ DE&nbsp;42 at AARoads.com]"
