The main reaction was on global financial markets experiencing extreme volatility.\nInternational responses\nEuropean Union\n*President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said that the result \"would not be the beginning of the end of the EU.\" He later added that he does not expect an \"amicable divorce\" but it was never \"a tight love affair anyway.\" He called for urgency on separation, even though the EU has no authority to force the invocation of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, as \"it doesn't make any sense to wait until October to try and negotiate the terms of their departure. I would like to get started immediately.\"\n**President of the European Council Donald Tusk said: \"This is not a moment for hysterical reactions. Today on behalf of the 27 leaders I can say that we are determined to keep our unity as 27. Until the UK formally leaves the EU, EU law will continue to apply to and within the UK, and by this I mean rights, as well as obligations. All the procedures for the withdrawal of the UK from the EU are set out in the treaties. In order to discuss the details, I have offered an informal meeting of the 27 in the margins of the European council next week. I have also proposed we start a wider reflection of the future of our union.\n*President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz said: \"We respect the result. We have clarity for the UK to go its own way. Now is the time for us to behave seriously and responsibly. David Cameron has his responsibilities for his country, we have our responsibilities for the future of the EU. You can see what is happening to sterling on the markets. I don't want the same thing to happen to the euro.\" He added that \"we expect the British government to deliver now.\"\n*The European Central Bank issued a statement which read: \"Following the outcome of the UK referendum, the European Central Bank is closely monitoring financial markets and is in close contact with other central banks. The ECB stands ready to provide additional liquidity, if needed, in euro and foreign currencies. The ECB has prepared for this contingency in close contact with the banks that it supervises and considers that the euro area banking system is resilient in terms of capital and liquidity.\"\n*Leader of the European People's Party and German Christian Social Union MEP Manfred Weber wrote: \"Exit negotiations should be concluded within 2 years at max. There cannot be any special treatment. Leave means leave.\"\n*French Left Party MEP Jean-Luc Mélenchon said: \"This is the end of a world that begins with this Brexit. This teaches a lesson to the whole of Europe; either we change it or we leave it. This is the time for a plan B.\"\n*Independent Irish MEP Luke 'Ming' Flanagan commented: \"[The] Irish government now needs to step up to the plate at [the] European Council...No barriers to trade with our biggest trading partner\" and that the European Union had \"crumbled under its own weight in arrogance.\"\n*Polish MEP Danuta Hubner suggested the potential disuse of English as working language of the European Union:\"We have a regulation where every EU country has the right to notify one official language. The Irish have notified Gaelic and the Maltese have notified Maltese, so you have only the UK notifying English...if you do not have the UK, you do not have English.\" German EU Commissioner Gunther Oettinger added: \"We have a series of member states that speak English, and English is the world language which we all accept;\" he also suggested that if Scotland was to join separately it could apply for English as their primary language.\n*The UK EU commissioner, Jonathan Hill, resigned on 25 June ahead of a vote in the EU parliament initiated by EPP, S&D, ALDE and Greens asking for his removal. He said, \"I don’t believe it is right that I should carry on as the British commissioner as though nothing had happened\". Latvia's Valdis Dombrovskis took over his portfolio (financial stability and services).\n;Member States\n* – Chancellor Christian Kern said: \"I do not fear a domino effect.\" However, he added that \"Europe will lose status and significance in the world because of Britain’s step. The long-term economic effects will also be felt for some time.\"\n**Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said that \"a domino effect on other countries cannot be ruled out.\" Although he added that the EU as a whole would survive.\n**The Freedom Party's (FPÖ) former presidential candidate Norbert Hofer, who lost narrowly in the 2016 Austrian presidential election (before it was annulled), warned Austria could hold an Auxit referendum on EU membership within a year. \"The founding fathers [of the EU] wanted to ensure closer economic cooperation because states that cooperate economically do not wage war against each other. That worked very well until the political union was founded. If a course is set within a year further towards centralisation instead of taking [the EU’s] core values into account, then we must ask Austrians whether they want to be members.\"\n**Leader of the Freedom Party of Austria Heinz-Christian Strache demanded the EU's Juncker should resign \"out of decency and out of respect for a better future for Europe.\"\n* – Prime Minister Charles Michel said that EU member states should meet to \"define priorities and set out a new future for Europe.\"\n* – Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said of potential contagion that \"only Bulgaria, Romania and Greece will remain when the domino effect is set off.\"\n* – President Miloš Zeman said that the result could have an unpleasant influence on the European Union because the United Kingdom will no longer balance French and German influence. He also noted that he was disappointed by the result and that it could worsen the economic conditions in the Czech Republic. Zeman later said that he would hold a referendum about leaving the European Union even though he would like to vote for remain in such a referendum.\n**Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said that the result is \"not the end of the world, nor it is the end of the European Union. He also said Europe should change because the project needs stronger support of citizens. After going for an EU summit, he added: \"We need to reaffirm the benefits of European integration for growth and security in Europe. We need to make the EU ideas more attractive for people. A new plan of relations between the EU and Britain is needed. We should take into account that a lot of Britons want their country to stay in the EU.\" Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Andrej Babiš said the European Union should respect the decision and should not force remaining countries to stronger integration. Foreign Minister Lubomír Zaorálek urged Juncker to resign, saying he was a \"negative symbol\" of federalism that British voters rejected.\n**The ODS issued a statement that read the result was \"the last warning before others will go.\" It also called for change in functioning and strategy of European Union. Leader of the party Petr Fiala said that the Czech Republic \"should reconsider its existence in European Union\" and negotiate new conditions for the country.\n**Eurosceptic parties welcomed the result and called for a similar referendum. The Party of Free Citizens called for similar referendum because \"European Union has changed since 2003 and three million newly eligible citizens could not vote at the time due to their age. Freedom and Direct Democracy stated that it will propose, in parliament, a referendum on the withdrawal of the Czech Republic from the European Union. Senator Ivo Valenta called for a \"Czexit\" and criticised the European Union for bad legislation, bad immigration policy and for having an army of bureaucrats.\n* – Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that the result is \"very sad for Denmark but it will be respected\" and that \"the British referendum does not change the fact that Denmark belongs in the EU. The EU is Denmark's best opportunity to influence the world that we are a part of for better or worse. We can do some things better alone, but we are stronger together. Denmark and the Danish economy are highly dependent on the European community.\"\n**Leader of Danish People's Party Kristian Thulesen Dahl praised the result but added that it's too early for Denmark to have a similar vote. \"It will probably take a few a years, and I believe that Denmark should push that Britain gets the best possible deal, and after that, it will be quite natural to ask the Danish people whether they want to go the way of the British.\"\n* – Minister for Foreign Affairs and the leader of the Finns Party Timo Soini said that \"the nation has had its say\" and that \"any retaliation and whinge is out of the question.\"\n**Teija Tiilikainen, the director of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, stated that \"Brexit seems to have had a strong impact on Finnish attitudes toward the EU,\"\n**Kaj Turunen, a Finns Party Member of Parliament and the chairman of the Parliament of Finland's commerce committee, stated that this was not the time for Finland to leave the Eurozone.\n* – President Francois Hollande said: \"I profoundly regret this decision for the United Kingdom and for Europe, but the choice is theirs and we have to respect it.\" He later said that it \"will be painful for Britain but... as in all divorces, it will be painful for those who stay behind, too.\" Prime Minister Manuel Valls said: \"At stake is the breakup, pure and simple, of the union. Now is the time to invent another Europe.\" Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron accused the U.K. of taking the EU \"hostage\" with a referendum called to solve a domestic political problem of eurosceptics and that \"the failure of the British government [has opened up] the possibility of the crumbling of Europe.\"\n**Les Republicains Mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart said: \"The British must take the consequences of their choice. We are in a strong position to push, to press this request for a review and we are asking the president [Francois Hollande] to bring his weight [to the issue]...there must be an element of division, of sharing.\" Leader for the Paris region Valérie Pécresse wrote: \"It's a thunderbolt. Nobody believed this could happen. I was convinced nobody would choose to undo what we have strived so long to build. We need to rethink Europe. The French must know that the EU protects them. We need a Europe that is more democratic and less bureaucratic.\"\n**Front National leader Marine Le Pen wrote: \"Victory for freedom! As I have been asking for years, now we need to have the same referendum in France and in the countries of the EU.\" She also said: \"I'll be Madame Frexit if the European Union doesn't give us back our monetary, legislative, territorial and budget sovereignty.\" Her niece and party member, Marion Marechal-Le Pen wrote: \"From #Brexit to #Frexit: It's now time to import democracy to our country. The French must have the right to choose!\"\n**France Arise leader Nicolas Dupont-Aignan commented \"For half a century the elites claim to 'build' Europe on the backs of citizens or against them on the grounds they would be unable, intellectually and morally, to adhere to the so-called grand project. But people are not as stupid or as their malicious rulers hope. So they came to understand the real intention of this [so-called] 'Europe' war machine against the countries, democracy and social justice. No offense to many commentators, the people are and always have been stronger than oligarchies, freedom always prevails over the dictatorship.\"\n**Ambassador to the U.S. Gerard Araud wrote: \"Now to the other Members states to save the EU from unravelling which excludes business as usual, especially in Brussels. Reform or die!\"\n* – Chancellor Angela Merkel said, after a meeting with her Austrian counterpart, that Europe should discuss the result \"together and in calm,\" while warning against hectic reactions. She noted the referendum result would be tabled during an EU summit in Brussels the following week. She added that \"today marks a turning point for Europe. It is a turning point for the European unification process.\" She re-iterated her desire to avoid \"ugly negotiations\" and that \"Great Britain needs to say which kind of relationship it imagines having with the EU. [Those talks should be] matter-of-fact [and] shouldn’t drag on forever.\" Further noting: \"Britain will remain a close partner, with which we are linked economically.\"\n**President Frank-Walter Steinmeier characterized the conduct of the Leave campaign, as “irresponsible”.\n**Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel wrote: \"Damn! A bad day for Europe.\" Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier wrote: \"The news from Britain is really sobering. It looks like a sad day for Europe and Britain.\"\n**Ruling Christian Democratic Union MP Norbert Röttgen said the result was the \"biggest catastrophe in the history of European integration.\"\n**Alternative for Germany's Frauke Petry wrote that the result was a warning that \"if the EU does not abandon its quasi-socialist experiment of ever greater integration then the European people will follow the Brits and take back their sovereignty.\"\n* – Prime minister Alexis Tsipras in a televised address to the country argued that \"it was a difficult day for Europe\" and that \"the EU has been dealt a blow.\" He also underlined that the result is respected and estimated that the message had long been sent, as reflected by the rise of euroskepticism in Europe. He further noted that the gap is widening and a \"return to the so-called security of national entrenchment\" will lead to a dead end and that an immediate change of course is necessary to defend against the rise of such movements. He summed it up as a \"negative development\" and that the European migrant crisis was partly to blame for the result.\n**Popular Unity issued a statement that read it was now \"more urgent for leaving the Eurozone and the indisciplined neoliberal EU\" and that \"after the political earthquake of Brexit, Europe and the world can not remain the same.\"\n**New Democracy MP Dora Bakoyannis said: \"The cost of populism emerged today in all its glory. Mr Cameron is bearing great responsibility. It's a hard day for Europe and an even harder day for the UK.\"\n* – The Taoiseach Enda Kenny stated that \"This result clearly has very significant implications for Ireland, as well as for Britain and for the European Union.\"\n**The Green Party described the decision as \"a huge blow to the European Union\" but said that, \"We have to respect their decision, and manage the consequences for Ireland as best as we can.\" Its statement restated a commitment to Europe and said that, \"It is only by sharing sovereignty that we can tackle the biggest issues facing our society. Yesterday's vote is a challenge for every pro-European to consider how we can restore faith in our Union.\"\n**The People Before Profit Alliance welcomed the exit vote and issued a statement that read: \"Over the last two years the EU has been shown for what it is – a prison house for workers that fosters racism, xenophobia and austerity.\"\n* – Prime Minister Viktor Orbán stated that he respects the decision and that \"Brussels should hear the voice of the people.\" He has also emphasised the need to carry out reforms on the structure of the European Union which \"was unable to adequately respond to weighty issues such as the ongoing migrant crisis.\" Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó declared \"a strong Europe is in everyone's interests, but this can only be realised if the EU provides real solutions to major challenges, because Europe cannot be strong if the solutions it provides weaken member states and the European Union.\"\n* – Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said: \"The decision of the British voters must be a wake-up call.\"\n**The Five Star Movement also issued a statement that called for a referendum on membership in the Eurozone.\n**Lega Nord leader Matteo Salvini wrote: \"Hurrah for the courage of free citizens! Heart, brain and pride defeated lies, threats and blackmail. THANK YOU UK, now it's our turn.\" He also called for a referendum on membership in the EU.\n**Brothers of Italy President Giorgia Meloni reacted in saying that \"the vote of British citizens is a vote for freedom and choice to reiterate that the sovereignty belongs to the people and that is not in the availability of business committees and lobbies that today govern European institutions. It is a brave choice that we believe we should follow. The EU can not be reformed because it is rotten from its foundations, it must be completely closed and reopened on diametrically opposite assumptions. We demand the resignation of Mr Juncker and of the entire European Commission and the start of whole new season.\" Commenting on the reaction to the vote by the European Commission, she added: \"Since when do Brussels bureaucrats have the power to declare war to other states? Who decided to now open hostilities against the United Kingdom? These technocrats are on a full power trip, the sooner we get rid of them the better it will be for Europe, the real one.\"\n* – Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said: \"It cannot be ruled out that Brexit leads to a domino effect in Eastern Europe. [It had been a] historic mistake.\" He suspected that a meeting earlier in the year between Cameron and the head of Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) Jaroslaw Kaczynski had a gentleman's agreement on rolling back European integration. \"Both seem do have the same agenda regarding their critical stance toward the EU.\"\n* – Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: \"The dissatisfaction you see in Britain is also present in other countries, including my own. This has to be a stimulus for more reform, more welfare.\" He added: \"First the British have to decide when they want to start the process of leaving.\"\n**MP and Dutch Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders wrote in congratulations of the outcome and that it is \"Time for a Dutch referendum!\"\n* – Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said: \"Brexit is bad news for Britain and Europe. It is a sign the EU concept needs to change.\"\n* – Prime Minister António Costa said that country's economic recovery will survive the result and that it had \"sent a very strong signal\" that many Europeans no longer identified themselves \"with what the EU has become.\" He also invoked the world's \"oldest alliance\" between Portugal and the United Kingdom and said that Portugal will keep strong economic relations with the United Kingdom.\n* – Prime Minister Robert Fico said that Slovakia respects the decision to leave the European Union and further noted that it is not a \"tragedy but a reality\". He also said that the European Union should change its policy because many people are not satisfied with its migration and economic policies. He added that the result would influence the Slovak six-month tenure as president of the European Commission.\n* - Acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo called for joint control over the disputed territory of Gibraltar, which voted overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU. \"It's a complete change of outlook that opens up new possibilities on Gibraltar not seen for a very long time. I hope the formula of co-sovereignty – to be clear, the Spanish flag on the Rock – is much closer than before.\" Gibraltar Chief Minister Fabian Picardo, however, immediately dismissed the remarks, stating that \"there will be no talks, or even talks about talks, about the sovereignty of Gibraltar.\" He also called on Gibraltar's residents \"to ignore these noises.\"\n**The Spanish People's Party issued a statement in regards to the election three days later that, as a result of the U.K. vote, Spain needed \"stability\" in the face of \"radicalism\" and \"populism.\" It was also read as an attack on the Unidos Podemos coalition that vowed to fight for the least well-off. The latter's leader Pablo Iglesias said that Europe had to \"change course. No-one would want to leave Europe if it were fair and united.\"\n** - President of the Generalitat of Catalonia Carles Puigdemont praised the result, while the Catalan National Assembly President Jordi Sànchez i Picanyol called for a referendum to be held in Catalonia to separate from Spain, despite the previous Catalan election being held as a de facto referendum on independence after the Spanish Constitutional Court disallowed a de jure one.\n* – Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said that Sweden will respect the decision of British citizens even though it will be hard for them. However, he added that this was a \"wake-up call\" for the EU and that it must show it can respond to people's expectations. He also called for unity and said negotiations with the UK should be allowed to take time and that it is important to maintain good relations with the UK. A few days later, he said \"Boris Johnson put forward a vision that the UK shall have free access to the EU, but be able to regulate immigration themselves. Sounds like they want the rights, but no obligations. This will not happen. Leaving the union will make a difference.\n**The Left Party issued a statement that called for the country’s government to renegotiate the terms of its adhesion to the EU.\n**Of the Alliance coalition, the Moderate Party leader Anna Kinberg Batra expressed regret at the result and Centre Party leader Annie Lööf called it a \"nightmare.\"\n**Sweden Democrats' leader Jimmie Åkesson said: \"We demand that Sweden immediately starts to renegotiate the (EU) deals we have made and that the Swedish people will be able to speak up about a future EU-membership in a referendum.\"\n;Multilateral\nAfter hosting talks with his counterparts from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg the following day, Germany's Walter-Steinmeier said that \"we now have to open the possibility for dealing with Europe’s future. That is why we jointly say: This process should start as soon as possible.\" France's Jean-Marc Ayrault said: \"We demand that the 27 other member countries also get respect. That’s one of the reasons we came to Berlin today.\" He added: \"There is a certain urgency ... so that we don't have a period of uncertainty, with financial consequences, political consequences.\" Luxembourg's Asselborn's said: \"I believe you can destroy the European Union with referenda. We have to communicate better what the EU has done, and we have to work harder on issues such as migration where we have failed.\" A joint statement also read: \"We now expect the UK government to provide clarity and give effect to this decision as soon as possible.\"\nSupranational bodies\n* Bank for International Settlements (BIS): Chief Economist Claudio Borio said: \"Brexit is one of the possible shocks to the economic outlook, but we emphasize much more the buildup of endogenous problems. It’s very tempting for policy makers to react strongly to market jitters. Given how far away we are from normality, we should be able to see through them. If you have any fiscal space, of the various possible uses, getting the banking system into shape is probably priority number one.\"\n*The G7 was expected to make a statement in regards to whether there is any coordinated intervention to ease monetary policy by global central banks.\n*: Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: \"The UK will remain a strong and committed NATO ally and will continue to play its leading role in our alliance.\"\n*  Commonwealth of Nations: Secretary-General Baroness Patricia Scotland said she remained \"hugely, hugely positive\" and added \"The fact that the United Kingdom made the decision to come out has put this on turbocharge, I believe that now that the UK has made its decision, the Commonwealth will become more pivotally important than it has ever been. Did the Commonwealth want it? I don’t think they did. Will they work incredibly hard to with all its members to derive the new benefits that may be available? Absolutely. Lots of people were really, really frightened about what would happen if the United Kingdom came out of Brexit. You are always more frightened about something before it happens than when it has happened. You have just got to get on with and deal with it\" she told the House of Lords international relations committee.\n*G7: The UK economy is \"resilient\" to the impact of the EU referendum vote, G7 finance ministers and central bank governors have said in a statement. They added they said steps had been taken to \"ensure adequate liquidity and to support the functioning of markets\" and that they were ready to use \"established liquidity instruments to that end. We affirm our assessment that the UK economy and financial sector remain resilient and are confident that the UK authorities are well-positioned to address the consequences of the referendum outcome. We recognize that excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We remain united and continue to maintain our solidarity as G7.\"\n*: Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's spokesperson issued a statement that read \"as the United Kingdom and other EU member states embark on the process of charting a way forward, the secretary general trusts in Europe's well-proven history of pragmatism and common responsibility in the interest of European citizens\" and that \"at the UN, we look forward to continuing our work with the United Kingdom and the European Union - both important partners...the secretary general expects the European Union to continue to be a solid partner for the United Nations on development and humanitarian issues, as well as peace and security, including migration. He also expects that the United Kingdom will continue to exercise its leadership in many areas, including development. He very much hopes that this will continue.\"\n* World Trade Organization: Director-General Roberto Azevêdo wrote: \"The British people have spoken. The WTO stands ready to work with the UK and the EU to assist them in any way we can.\"\n* The European Free Trade Association (EFTA): Which the UK co-founded in 1960, Swiss President Johann Schneider-Ammann said that the U.K.'s return would strengthen the association.\n* Confederation of Indian Industry (CII): President & Co-chairman Forbes Marshall, Naushad Forbes said, \"India-UK relations will sustain with or without Britain’s relationship with the EU and will only thrive and prosper in the years ahead\". He also said that the exit might speed up the India UK Free Trade Agreement. India has been negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with the EU for over nine years. India is the third largest investor in the UK economy. CII President also led a delegation of high profile CEOs to the UK to discuss the post Brexit opportunities and the Free Trade Agreement.\n*International Monetary Fund (IMF): Director Christine Lagarde said \"We urge the authorities in the UK and Europe to work collaboratively to ensure a smooth transition to a new economic relationship between the UK and the EU, including by clarifying the procedures and broad objectives that will guide the process.\"\nSovereign states/entities\n*: Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: \"The impact on Australia immediately, directly, from a legal point of view, will be very limited because it will take some years for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, to negotiate an exit. However, we've seen already large falls on stock markets and there will be a degree of uncertainty for some time.\" He added that this was a \"momentous and historic decision.\" He also insisted \"there is no cause for Australians to be alarmed by these developments\" and that \"it is important to remember that the Australian economy is strong and resilient and has weathered global shocks before and weathered them well.\" On the campaign trail less than a week before an election, he said: \"The upheaval reminds us there are many things in the global economy over which we have no control. Calm heads, steady hands, stable government and a strong economic plan are critical for Australia to withstand any repercussions. Always expect the unexpected. We will need to renegotiate vital trade deals with Britain and Europe.\"\n*: An unnamed spokesperson of the Bahraini government said that it honoured the decision of its \"British ally\" and also stressed its commitment to strengthen relationship between the two countries, as well as with the EU to \"consolidate peace and security in the region.\"\n*: Prime Minister Denis Zvizdic said that Bosnia is determined to join the EU as \"nowhere on this planet people live better.\" The Croat member of the Bosnian presidency, Dragan Covic, who submitted Bosnia's membership application in February, said Britain's vote was just another challenge that will make the bloc stronger.\n*: The Itamaraty Palace issued a statement that read the country remains an EU partner, but that it will work to strengthen relations between Brazil and the United Kingdom. It also read with \"respect\" the outcome of the referendum and trust that this decision will not deter the process of European integration.\n*: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said \"The people of the UK have chosen to leave the EU. The UK and the EU are important strategic partners for Canada with whom we enjoy deep historical ties and common values. We will continue to build relations with both parties as they forge a new relationship...Prime Minister David Cameron indicated today that he will resign by the fall. On behalf of all Canadians, I would like to thank him for being such a close ally and good friend to our country. We wish him well.\"\n*: Just hours after the vote, the Beijing-based Global Times, which often expresses the views of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), said that \"Britons are already showing a losing mind-set. They may become citizens of a nation that prefers to shut itself from the outside world.\" Later the Spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry Hua Chunying said \"A prosperous Europe is in the interests of all parties and China is willing to keep co-operating with Britain and is fully confident in China-EU ties.\"\n*: After meeting with President Juan Manuel Santos, Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Maria Lacouture proposed, on behalf of the Pacific Alliance, to jointly negotiate a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom. She said that \"rather than individual countries negotiating trade deals with the UK, it should renegotiate as a block...the proposal we want to develop is a deal that presents a great opportunity for Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru.\"\n*: Pope Francis said on board the papal flight to Armenia that \"the will expressed by the people...requires a great responsibility on the part of all of us to guarantee the good of the people of the United Kingdom as well as the peaceful coexistence of the entire European continent. This is what I expect.\"\n*: Outgoing President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson welcomed the result as good news for Icelanders and presents an opportunity for Iceland. He commented that “it is now obvious that here in the North Atlantic [there] will be a triangle of nations that all stand outside of the European Union: Greenland, Iceland, Great Britain, Faroe Islands and Norway. This key area in the north will be outside of the influence of the European Union.\" The Presidential candidate Guðni Th. Jóhannesson said on the day after the vote, as well as the day before the Icelandic vote, in the final debate that the result in the U.K. changes \"much for the better for us Icelanders,\" implying the European Economic Area agreement that non-EU members Norway and Iceland have with the EU, could play a more important role with the United Kingdom on board.\n*: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said: \"In this globalised world, volatility and uncertainty are the new norms. This verdict will obviously further contribute to such volatility not least because its full implications for the UK, Europe and the rest of the world are still uncertain.  All countries around the world will have to brace themselves for a period of possible turbulence while being watchful about, and alert to, the referendum's medium term impacts.\" Commerce Secretary Rita Teaotia said: \"My interest will get changed because number of tariff lines (products) will change (now). I will calibrate and the EU will also calibrate. Now they would reassess and we will also be going to reassess.\" She added that recalibration is required as some items of interest to Britain may have to be removed. She further noted: \"Brexit will not impact our trade with the UK. With EU also, nothing directly affects our trade. In long term, we would be interested to see how UK negotiates its exit from EU.\" In regards to a proposed free-trade agreement Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said: \"I would think, they (EU) would need time now to assimilate this outcome. Once they assimilate the outcome, they will only then respond. I will talk to my counterparts.\" She added: \"So the impact of volatility of the currency is something which might have an immediate impact on our exporters. We will however have to keep watching currency based volatility, both in the short and the medium term and also look at the impact on overall trade itself.\" External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said: \"We have seen the results of the British referendum on EU membership reflecting the choice made by the British people on the issue. We value our multifaceted relationships with both the UK and the EU and will strive to further strengthen these ties in the years ahead.\" CII Director-General, Chandrajit Bannerjee said, “With Britain’s departure from the EU, India will have to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with the UK which may be easier to accomplish at a bilateral level... This could well be the best era for our industries to collaborate.”\n* : The Foreign Ministry issued a statement that read: \"The Islamic Republic of Iran, as a democratic state, are  respected to British vote to leave the European Union and considered it as will of the majority of its people in setting its foreign relations. Iran has always called for expansion of relations with European countries based on mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs and the withdrawal of Great Britain from the European Union will not change [the] Islamic Republic's relations with that country.\"\n*: Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu quickly issued a statement following the result of the vote and said that he has been in contact with officials from the Finance Ministry and Bank of Israel to discuss the possible implications of Brexit on Israel. He has concluded that \"there is no direct effect on Israel, apart from the fact that we are part of the global economy\" and described outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron as \"a respected leader and a true friend of Israel and the Jewish people.\" following his resignation.\n*: Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida issued a statement that read the country would closely observe the impact of  developments on Japan and the international community.

Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshige Seko said the government was worried about financial market volatility as a result of the vote as being \"undesirable.\"\n*: The Jordanian Cabinet announced that it would investigate the possible impact of the vote on the Hashemite Kingdom. It has given the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs and Minister of Industry, Trade and Supply Jawad Ananithe task of preparing a comprehensive report on the repercussions of Brexit, especially because Jordan has \"solid relations with the UK on a bilateral level and previously on EU level.\"\n*: Prime Minister Erna Solberg said: \"The referendum in the UK marks a crossroads for European cooperation. Britain's decision pose[s] policy challenges. Europe's leaders must get a grasp on the instability and lack of confidence many voters feel.\" The Centre Party MP Per Olaf Lundteigen also said: \"The Centre Party must work even more powerfully to terminate the EEA agreement and replace it with a trade agreement.\" The No to EU organisation, in a statement, welcomed the result as a \"victory for democracy\" and invited the UK to rejoin EFTA.\n*: President Gjorge Ivanov said that he fears that the European Union may follow the former Yugoslavia’s steps. \"In circumstances of a crisis, countries are becoming selfish, right wing radicals are emerging who are blaming refugees and Muslims and Islamophobia is emerging,\" Ivanov said, adding that the Republic of Macedonia will carefully follow the developments after the referendum, where 52 per cent of the British people voted in favour of leaving the EU. Foreign Minister Nikola Popovski also said that Brexit means a loss for the Balkans and the Republic of Macedonia, because Britain was a great supporter of the process of the enlargement of the Union.\n*: Prime Minister Najib Razak said: \"The UK voters have spoken. As democrats, we must respect the result. We wish our British friends well in the new future they have chosen, Najib also hinted it was \"historic and unprecedented.

Modern democracies have evolved systems of checks and balances to protect the interests of minorities and to avoid making uninformed decisions with catastrophic consequences.\"\nProfessor Michael Dougan of Liverpool University and Jean Monnet Chair of EU Law said \"On virtually every major issue that was raised in this referendum debate Leave’s arguments consisted of at best misrepresentations and at worst outright deception\" and that the Leave campaign was \"criminally irresponsible\"\nKhaled al-Hroub, a senior research fellow at the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Cambridge said: \"In theory, the UK's influence on the EU policies vis-à-vis Arab issues such as Palestine, Syria and Iraq will end - which is not necessarily a bad thing to have.
