NMES also conducts teaching in chemistry and physics on its Waterloo campus, with the Department of Chemistry located at Britannia House on King’s Guy's campus. King’s was the first English university to establish an engineering department in 1838.\nThe faculty is partnered with the Francis Crick Institute, the London Centre for Nanotechnology and the Thomas Young Centre.\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II opened the Bush House complex on the Strand campus on 19 March 2019, which houses the Department of Informatics.\nDepartments and Centres\nThe following departments, centres and institutes can be found in the Faculty of Natural, Mathematical & Engineering Sciences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Unit\n|Type\n|Established\n|Academic Lead\n|-\n|Faculty\n|Faculty\n|Pre-2010\n|Executive Dean\n|-\n|Chemistry\n|Department\n|1831\n|Head of Department\n|-\n|Engineering\n|Department\n|1838\n|Head of Department\n|-\n|Informatics\n|Department\n|1985\n|Head of Department\n|-\n|Mathematics\n|Department\n|1830\n|Head of Department\n|-\n|Physics\n|Department\n|1829\n|Head of Department\n|-\n|Centre for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) London\n|Centre\n|2016\n|Centre Director\n|-\n|Physical Science of Life\n|Centre\n|2021\n|Centre Director\n|-\n|Net Zero\n|Centre\n|2021\n|Centre Director\n|-\n|King’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence\n|Institute\n|2022\n|Institute Director\n|-\n|King's Quantum\n|Centre\n|2024\n|Centre Director\n|}\nTeaching and research quality\n* Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF)\nKing's was awarded a silver rating in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) 2023, with a Gold rating for its graduate employment rates and opportunities.\n* Research Excellence Framework (REF)\nIn REF 2021:, NMES departments were rated\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Department\n!GPA Rank\n!Impact 4*\n!Outputs 4*\n|-\n|Chemistry\n|5th\n|100%\n|56%\n|-\n|Physics\n|28th\n|66%\n|51%\n|-\n|Mathematics\n|13th\n|25%\n|50%\n|-\n|Informatics\n|16th\n|25%\n|25%\n|-\n|Engineering\n|12th\n|75%\n|60%\n|}\n* Knowledge Exchange Framework (KEF)\nIn the 2023 Knowledge Exchange Framework exercise, King's scored in the highest quintile (top 20% of English universities) in four out of seven perspectives and being at or above the average for its cluster in six of seven perspectives .\nLeadership\nThe current Executive Dean is Professor Rachel Bearon, who replaced Professor Mark French in January 2024:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Image\n|Name\n|Role\n|Discipline\n|Tenure\n|-\n|\n|Professor Rachel Bearon\n|Executive Dean\n|Mathematics\n|2024 – 2028\n|-\n|\n|Professor Mark French\n|Interim Executive Dean\n|Computer Engineering\n|2023 (Interim)\n|-\n|\n|Professor Sir Bashir M.
