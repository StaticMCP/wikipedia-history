This place is said to have been touched by the feet of eight Sikh Gurus. The first Guru Nanak Dev came here during his first Udasi. The third Guru Amar Das had a Baoli built at this place.\nHistory\nGurdwara Sri Goindwal Sahib is the first Sikh pilgrimage site established in the 16th century under the supervision of Guru Amar Das. The third Guru Amar Das stayed in Goindwal for 33 years. Here, he built a baoli or a well with 84 steps. The entrance to the baoli is artistically decorated. There is a row of floors depicting scenes from Sikh history. It is said that whoever bathes in the well and recites Japji Sahib, attains Moksha. Goindwal is the place where Guru Amar Das met Guru Ramdas.\nA magnificent Gurdwara has been built alongside the baoli. The Gurdwara is an example of typical Sikh architecture topped with a large golden dome. In addition, it houses the famous community kitchen of Guru Amar Das, the Langar, where free food is served to every visitor. A Sikh historian has recorded that Emperor Akbar also ate at the langar before meeting the Guru. There is another domed entrance, decorated with artwork depicting the life of the great saint - Guru Amar Das.\nGuru Hargobind and Guru Tegh Bahadur's visit\nGuru Hargobind with his family travelled from Chabhal to Goindwal. As they reached Goindwal, Guru Hargobind, his family, and his Sikhs made ablutions in the Baoli Sahib built by Guru Amar Das. Bhai Tegh Bahadur, then barely two, was bathed with the holy water. Ablutions were repeated the following morning before Guru Hargobind left for Kartarpur. The family were left in Goindwal on the persuasion of Baba Sundar, great-grandson of Guru Amar Das. Upon his return to Amritsar, Guru Hargobind recalled the family from Goindwal. Guru Tegh Bahadur also visited Goindwal again in 1664 after first halt during this journey was at Amritsar, followed by halts at Tarn Taran, and Khadur Sahib.\nGallery\nFile:Photograph of Gurdwara Baoli Sahib, Goindwal, circa late 19th or early 20th century.jpg|Photograph of Boali Sahib, Goindwal, circa 1880-1900.\nFile:Photograph of Boali Sahib, Goindwal, circa 1931.jpg|Photograph of Boali Sahib, Goindwal, circa 1931.\nReferences"
