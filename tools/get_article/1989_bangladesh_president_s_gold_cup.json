perceived foul in the penalty box by Imtiaz Sultan Johnny on Huh Ki-tae. When Sen showed a red card to Korean captain Song Ju-seok for his aggressive confrontation, tensions escalated as the players violently pursued the referee once again. The match had to be halted for 11 minutes due to the chaos.\nStatistics\nGoalscorers\nSong Ju-seok\n|2 goals=\n* Madekhi\n* Sheikh Mohammad Aslam\n* Seo Jung-won\n* Kim Sang In\n|1 goals=\n* Mujhid Maleh\n* Rumman Bin Wali Sabbir\n* Masoud\n* Suan Rakha\n* Iqbalur Rahman Iqbal\n* Sang-moon Kim\n* Huyang Choo\n* Ayaz Ahmed\n* C.
