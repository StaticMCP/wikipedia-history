      "text": "# Breaking the Surface\n\nBreaking the Surface is a best-selling book by Greg Louganis, co-written with Eric Marcus published in 1995. The book spent five weeks at number one on the New York Times Best Seller list.\nLouganis chronicles his winning of back-to-back double gold medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics and 1988 Summer Olympics, and his self-doubt and lack of confidence that held him back personally and professionally because of concealing his sexual orientation as a gay athlete. This is about him coming out as an HIV-positive gay man.\nAs a follow-up to the success of the book, Canadian television and film director Steven Hilliard Stern directed Breaking the Surface: The Greg Louganis Story in 1997, starring Mario Lopez as Louganis, with Louganis also appearing in certain scenes of the television film and as narrator. Louganis also produced a video diary called Looking To the Light, which picked up where Breaking the Surface left off.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.louganis.com  Greg Louganis Official website]\n* [http://www.ericmarcus.com Eric Marcus official website]"
