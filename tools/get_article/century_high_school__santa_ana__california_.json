It is one of the smallest campuses in Orange County, built to house 1500 students.\nIt was built in 1989. Its mascot is the Centurion, and the school colors are blue, silver, and green.\nStudent body\nThe school's student body is largely homogeneous and reflects the Latino ethnic makeup of the surrounding community. It is composed of roughly 93% Hispanic, 5% Asian, 2% Caucasian, 0.5% African American, 0.3% other and mixed and includes 7 different languages spoken. Student life can be seen on the morning broadcast that the school produces every day. [http://www.theinsidescoop.tv]\nAcademics\nCentury High School is a comprehensive high school offering a full range of a-g courses necessary for University of California and Cal State acceptance. Within the last two years, CST scores have gone higher than expected and have improved; however, not enough to keep the school off of the state's list of persistently low-performing schools. The challenges faced by students and faculty are almost insurmountable, yet each year students come back to find dedicated and caring faculty who meet these obstacles head on. In 2014, Century received a six-year WASC accreditation, almost unheard of for school the federal government considers to not be meeting its AYP.\nAthletics\nCentury High School athletics include: football, basketball, soccer, Polynesian, tennis, track and field, cross country, volleyball, softball, baseball, wrestling and some smaller branches of physical education such as dance, Pep Squad, NJROTC, colorguard. Century's Pep Squad and Colorguard members are recognized for their achievements in National competition and for their spirit and motivation.\nNotable alumni\n* Hebron Fangupo played defensive tackle for the USC Trojans and BYU Cougars and played in the NFL for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Seattle Seahawks, Kansas City Chiefs, and the Washington\n* Redskins. He is the defensive line coach for Snow College and the Utah Tech Trailblazers (formerly Dixie State.)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://century.sausd.us Century High School website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110920010809/http://www.sausd.us/century Century High School SAUSD Page]"
