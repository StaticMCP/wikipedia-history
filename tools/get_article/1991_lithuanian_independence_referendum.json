Just over 93% of those voting voted in favour of independence, while the number of eligible voters voting \"yes\" was 76.5%, far exceeding the threshold of 50%. Independence was subsequently achieved in August 1991. The independence of the Republic of Lithuania was re-recognized by the United States on 2 September 1991 and by the Soviet Union on 6 September 1991.\nResults\nSee also\n*1991 Latvian independence and democracy referendum\n*1991 Estonian independence referendum\n*1991 Soviet Union referendum\nReferences"
