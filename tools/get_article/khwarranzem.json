      "text": "# Khwarranzem\n\nKhwarranzem (Middle Persian: Xwarranzēm) (also known as Chornanzem, Xwarnanzem) was a 3rd-century Sasanian queen (banbishn), married to Ardashir I or to Shapur I.\nBiography\nThe origins of her name is unknown, the name seems to suggest an Armenian or Georgian background. She is mentioned in Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, where she is holding the title of shahr banbishn (\"Queen of the empire\"). According to the same inscription, she was the mother of a certain Gorazdukht.\nHer husband is the subject of dispute amongst scholars; according to some, she was the wife of Ardashir I (), whilst others suggests that she was the wife of Ardashir's son and successor Shapur I () and the mother of the latter's son and heir Hormizd I (). She may have been the same person as Gurdzad, who is mentioned as the wife of Shapur by the 10th-century historian Hamza al-Isfahani.\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*"
