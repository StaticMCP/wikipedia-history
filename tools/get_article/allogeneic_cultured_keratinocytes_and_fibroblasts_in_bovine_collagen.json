It is the first cell-based product made from allogeneic (cells derived from a donor source that is unrelated to the intended recipient) human cells and bovine collagen approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2012.\nMedical uses\nAllogeneic cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts in bovine collagen is indicated for topical (non-submerged) application to a surgically created vascular wound bed in the treatment of mucogingival conditions in adults.\nHistory\nThe efficacy of allogeneic cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts in bovine collagen (Gintuit) was evaluated in two clinical studies in adults with insufficient gingival tissue. In each of the two studies, Gintuit was associated with an increase of at least 2 mm of gingival tissue in at least 50% of the study subjects. The overall clinical trial safety data for Gintuit included 121 subjects from both studies.\nReferences"
