Started in 2016, the short film awards are a part of WWM's and Filmfare's ongoing transition onto the digital platform. These awards invite first-time as well as professional filmmakers to submit their entries, following which a panel of filmmakers judges and honors them with Filmfare Awards in 6 categories.\nHistory\nThe Filmfare Short Film Awards were instituted by Filmfare in 2016 to recognize and celebrate emerging talent in short filmmaking. The awards aim to provide a prestigious platform for storytellers working in the short film format and are held annually alongside the main Filmfare Awards ceremony.\nThe awards were first announced in December 2016 via a Facebook Live stream, and the inaugural ceremony was held in January 2017 during the 62nd Filmfare Awards in Mumbai. The initiative includes categories like Best Short Film (Fiction), Best Actor (Male & Female), People’s Choice Award, and others.\nJury selection\nThe inaugural Filmfare Short Film Awards were launched in 2016, with the first ceremony held in January 2017. The initiative aimed to spotlight the evolving medium of digital short filmmaking. The jury for the first edition featured some of the most respected voices in Indian cinema: Karan Johar, Vidya Balan, Aanand L. Rai, Kabir Khan, Zoya Akhtar, Gauri Shinde, and Meghna Gulzar.\nThe second edition of the Filmfare Short Film Awards continued the tradition of assembling a jury of celebrated filmmakers.

This screening process is designed to evaluate the technical and narrative quality of each film.\nFollowing this internal review, a shortlist of 30 finalist films is curated. These selected films are then considered for recognition across five award categories.
