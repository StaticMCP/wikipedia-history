It ran on NBC from September 25, 1962, to May 14, 1963.\nAfter NBC cancelled the original series due to low ratings, a later version was made to rename it to Redigo (instead of having a 2nd season), truncated from one-hour episodes to half hour episodes, in black and white instead of color, and again starring Egan as Redigo. That version only ran for a partial season. However, even after NBC cancelled the original series in 1963 due to low ratings, ABC reran the show on Sundays, 7:30-8:30pm, on the partial part of the 1963-64 network television season, on Spring 1964.\nIn the UK the series was shown in the London ITV area (Associated-Rediffusion) under the title Big G, from Jun 12th 1963 to Jan 16th 1964.\nIn 1965 Columbia Pictures released the pilot episode as a film called This Rugged Land outside the US.\nEpisodes\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = 515151\n}}\n}}\nCast\nMain cast\n* Richard Egan as Jim Redigo (both versions 1 and 2)\n* Ryan O'Neal as Tal Gerret (both versions 1 and 2)\n* Terry Moore as Connie Gerret (version 1)\n* Anne Seymour as Lucia Gerret (version 1)\n* Charles Bronson as Moreno (version 2)\n* Warren Vanders as Chuck (version 2)\nGuest stars\nGuest stars who appeared on Empire included:\n*Inger Stevens\n*Philip Abbott\n*Barry Atwater\n*Barbara Bain\n*Roy Barcroft\n*Joanna Barnes\n*Ed Begley\n*Diane Brewster\n*Joyce Bulifant\n*Walter Burke\n*James T.
