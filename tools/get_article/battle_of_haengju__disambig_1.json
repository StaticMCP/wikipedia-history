The Japanese attack failed to overcome the fortress Haengjusanseong.\nBackground\nGwon Yul was stationed at the fortress Haengjusanseong, a wooden stockade on a cliff over the Han River. Haengju posed a threat to Hanseong (modern Seoul and capital of Joseon) due to its proximity, so the Japanese attacked it in March.\nBattle\nThe Japanese attack led by Konishi Yukinaga happened on 14 March 1593 with 30,000 men. They took turns attacking the stockade due to the limited space. The Koreans retaliated with arrows, cannons, and hwacha.\nAfter three attacks, one with siege tower, and one where Ishida Mitsunari was wounded, Ukita Hideie managed to breach the outer defenses and reach the inner wall. However, he was wounded as well and had to fall back.\nIn the last attack Kobayakawa Takakage burned a hole through the fort's log pilings, but the Koreans managed to hold them back long enough for it to be repaired.\nWhen the Koreans had nearly run out of arrows, I Bun arrived with supply ships containing 10,000 more arrows, and they continued to fight on until dusk when the Japanese retreated.\nAftermath\nAside from the defeat, the Japanese situation became even more tenuous after Zha Dashou led a small group of raiders to Hanseong, burning more than 6,500 tons of grain. This left the Japanese with less than a month of provisions.\nAfter several negotiations with Shen Weijing, the Japanese abandoned Hanseong on 17 May 1593. What Li Rusong and Song Yingchang witnessed upon entering the city was a people who \"looked like ghosts.\"\nSee also\n* List of fortresses in Korea\n* Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)\n* Gwon Yul\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* 桑田忠親 [Kuwata, Tadachika], ed., 舊參謀本部編纂, [Kyu Sanbo Honbu], 朝鮮の役 [Chousen no Eki]　(日本の戰史 [Nihon no Senshi] Vol.5), 1965.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/kyonggi/119 Haengju Mountain Fortress]\n*[http://mahan.wonkwang.ac.kr/culture/98fall/road24.htm 행주산성]\n*[http://www.kbs.co.kr/end_program/1tv/sisa/history/vod/1267391_4855.html 역사스페셜 – 승리를 이끈 하이테크 신무기]"
