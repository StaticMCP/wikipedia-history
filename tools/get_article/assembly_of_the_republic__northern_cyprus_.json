It has 50 members, elected for a five-year term by mitigated proportional representation. A party must cross the electoral threshold (5% of the total vote) to be awarded any seats. The parliament is composed of 50 MPs, chosen from six electoral districts, which are coterminous with the districts of Northern Cyprus: Lefkoşa, Gazimağusa, Girne, Güzelyurt, Lefke and İskele.\nIn Northern Cyprus parliamentary elections, voters vote for individual candidates. There are two ways of voting.\n* Voters can vote for a party, which in effect is voting for every MP candidate from that party in that district once. The voter can further prioritize the MPs in this kind of voting.\n* Alternatively, the voter may not choose a party, but vote for candidates from different parties. In this kind of mixed voting, the voter cannot choose more than the number of MPs the district is allotted.\nCurrent composition\nParliamentary elections were last held on 23 January 2022.\nNote: Each voter may cast multiple votes, one for each seat in the parliament. Hence, the vote totals may exceed the number of registered voters.\nLocation\nThe parliament building is located within new [https://kktcb.org/en/ceremony-held-to-officially-open-the-republic-complex-consisting-of-13562 TRNC Republic Complex] , opposite the TRNC Presidency in North Nicosia. The building is a new modern parliamentary building .\nIn 2025 National Assembly of Northern Cyprus relocated from Osmanpaşa Caddesi, North Nicosia to a newly designated administrative Complex. The move aimed to modernize parliamentary facilities in TRNC.\nCouncil of Europe assembly representation\nIn 2004, the Turkish Cypriot community was awarded \"observer status\" in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). Since then, the two Turkish Cypriot representatives to PACE are elected by the Assembly of Northern Cyprus.\n* 2005–2007: CTP Özdil Nami; UBP Huseyin Ozgurgun\n* 27 January 2011: CTP Mehmet Caglar; UBP Ahmet Eti\n* 4 December 2013: CTP Mehmet Caglar; UBP Tahsin Ertugruloglu\nSee also\n* List of speakers of the Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
