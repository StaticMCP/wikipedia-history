In contrast to the hard rock version heard on Sound of the Republic, the Heartattack version is a tekno-metal-hardcore version which is much more listener-friendly than the version found on Sound of the Republic. The  Heartattack version also is part of a collection of demo recordings which secured Raised Fist a recording contract. The Heartattack version is listed on the CD packaging and disc art as simply Time Will Let You Go instead of Time Will Let You Go; All Alone, I Break as seen on Sound of the Republic.\nMusicians\n* Marco Eronen - Guitar\n* Daniel Holmberg - Guitar\n* Matte Modin - Drums\n* Andreas \"Josse\" Johansson - Bass\n* Alexander \"Alle\" Hagman - Vocals\nReferences"
