Altogether 70 galleys were built in the winter of 1533–1534, manned by slave oarsmen, including 2,000 Jews. With this fleet, Barbarossa conducted aggressive raids along the coast of Italy, then conquered Tunis on 16 August 1534, ousting the theretofore local ruler, Muley Hasan,}} who had been subservient to the Spanish  Barbarossa established a strong naval base in Tunis, which could be used for raids in the region, and on nearby Malta.\nCharles V assembled a large army of some 30,000 soldiers, 74 galleys rowed by chained Protestants shipped in from Antwerp, and 300 sailing ships, including the carrack  and the Portuguese galleon São João Baptista (the most powerful ship in the world at the time) to drive the Ottomans from the region. The expense involved for Charles V was considerable, and at 1,000,000 ducats on par with the cost of Charles' campaign against Suleiman on the Danube. Unexpectedly, the funding of the conquest of Tunis came from the galleons sailing in from the New World, in the form of two million gold ducats extracted by Francisco Pizarro for releasing the Inca king Atahualpa, whom he nevertheless executed on 29 August 1533.\nDespite a request by Charles V, Francis I denied French support to the expedition, explaining that he was under a three-year truce with Barbarossa following the 1533 Ottoman embassy to France. Francis I was also in negotiations with Suleiman for a combined attack on Charles V following the 1534 Ottoman embassy. Francis I only agreed to Pope Paul III's request that no fight between Christians occur during the time of the expedition.\nBattle\nHaving sailed from Sardinia at the head of a Catholic coalition protected by a Genoese fleet, Charles V destroyed Barbarossa's fleet on 1 June 1535 and after a costly yet successful siege at La Goletta, captured Tunis. In the action, the Portuguese galleon  distinguished itself by breaking the chains protecting the harbour's entrance, thereafter opening fire on La Goletta. In the ruins, the Spanish found cannonballs with the French fleur-de-lis mark, evidence of the contacts stemming from the Franco-Ottoman alliance.\nThe resulting massacre of the city left an estimated 30,000 dead and 10,000 enslaved. Barbarossa managed to flee to Algiers with a troop of several thousand Ottomans. Muley Hasan was restored to his throne. The stench of the corpses was such that Charles V soon left Tunis and moved his camp to Radès.\nThe siege demonstrated the power of the Habsburg dynasties at the time; Charles V had under his control much of southern Italy, Sicily, Spain, the Americas, Austria, the Netherlands, and lands in Germany. Furthermore, he was Holy Roman Emperor and had  control over much of Germany as well.\nOttoman defeat in Tunis motivated them to enter into a formal alliance with France against the Habsburg Empire. Ambassador Jean de La Forêt was sent to Constantinople, and for the first time was able to become permanent ambassador at the Ottoman court and to negotiate treaties.\nCharles V celebrated a neo-classical triumph \"over the infidel\" first in Sicily and then at Rome on 5 April 1536 in commemoration of his victory at Tunis. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luis Pérez de Vargas, fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defences between 1546 and 1550.\nAftermath\nBarbarossa managed to escape to the harbour of Bône, where a fleet was waiting for him. From there, he sailed to accomplish the Sack of Mahón, where he took 600 slaves and brought them to Algiers.\nThe Ottomans recaptured the city in 1569. Spain captured it again in 1573 under John of Austria, only to lose it again in 1574. Thereafter privateers from Tunis caused discord against Christian shipping. Raiding in the Mediterranean Sea continued until the suppression of the Barbary pirates in the early 19th century.\nA French invasion led to the establishment of French Algeria in 1830, consequently France would create a protectorate over Tunisia in 1881.\nGallery\nFile:Bombardment of La Goletta.jpg|Bombardment of La Goletta\nFile:Attack at La Goletta.jpg|Attack at La Goletta\nFile:Battle of Tunis 1535 Charles V vs Barbarossa.jpg|Battle scene at Tunis, 1535\nFile:Capture of Tunis 1535 liberation of 20000 Christian captives.jpg|Liberation of 20,000 Christian captives\nFile:Charles quint a rades.png|Charles V going to Radès\nFile:Charles V announcing the capture of Tunis to the Pope in 1535.jpg|Charles V announcing the capture of Tunis to Pope Paul III in 1535\nFile:Conquest of Tunis 1535.jpg|Imperial troops in the conquest of Tunis, 1535, Jan Cornelisz Vermeyen\nFile:Conquest of Tunis 1535 bis.jpg|Ottoman troops in the conquest of Tunis, 1535\nFile:Map of Tunis and La Goulette in Tunisia, 1535.jpg|Shows Holy Roman Emperor Charles V capturing Tunis and its port city of La Goulette (also known as Goletta and Halq al-Wadi), in 1535.\nSee also\n* Barbary corsairs\n* Battle of Cape Corvo\n* Battle of Cape Celidonia\n* Algiers expedition (1541)\n* Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n* Allen, Bruce Ware. \"Emperor vs. Pirate Tunis, 1535.\" MHQ: Quarterly Journal of Military History (Winter 2014) 26#2 pp 58–63.\n*\n*\n*\n* La Marina Cántabra.
