Smith Confederate Monument stands on the grounds of the Sebastian County Courthouse at the junction of 6th and Rogers Streets in Fort Smith, Arkansas.  The statue depicts a Confederate Army soldier, standing facing north, holding the upper stock of his rifle, which is grounded.   The sculpture is  in height, and is mounted on a square columnar pedestal over  tall.  The monument was placed in 1903 with funding raised by the local chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy.  An earlier Confederate memorial, placed at Fort Smith National Cemetery, was destroyed by a tornado, and the federal government objected to the placement of this memorial there without alterations to also commemorate the Union dead.  The city granted permission for its placement at its current location.\nThe monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Sebastian County, Arkansas\nReferences"
