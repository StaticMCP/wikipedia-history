He lived in London where he was noticed by Queen Victoria.\nBiography\n]]\nAlfred Chalon was born in Geneva from a father who soon was hired as professor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in England.\nWith his brother John James Chalon (1778–1854), Alfred became an artist. Entered at the Royal Academy in 1797, he joined the Associated Artists in Water-Colours, a group of aquarellists. In the Academy, he was elected an associate (ARA) in 1812, then academician (RA) in 1816.\nKnown for his portraits of the good society of London, he was chosen by Queen Victoria to paint a gift to her mother: Victoria in her State robes going to the House of Lords for her first official act, the prorogation of the Parliament, on 17 July 1837. After this task, Chalon was entitled Portrait Painter in Water Colour to Her Majesty and gained some celebrity. His 1837 portrait was engraved by Samuel Cousins and distributed to the public the day of Victoria's coronation, the 28 June 1838; and the next year Cousins produced a second, smaller, engraving. Then, starting in 1851, the \"Chalon head\" appeared on some British colonies' postage stamps.\nBachelors, the Chalon brothers lived together. In 1860, Alfred died at Campden Hill, in Kensington, London and was buried with his brother in Highgate Cemetery.\nGirl Reading Letter\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://archive.today/20130101014541/http://data4.collectionscanada.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=&s2=&s3=153&l=20&Sect4=AND&Sect1=IMAGE&Sect2=THESOFF&Sect5=BIPHPEN&Sect6=HITOFF&d=BIPH&p=1&u=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/02/02015502_e.html&r=1&f=G Biography], Library and Archives Canada, retrieved 29 December 2007.\n*[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/chalon_alfred.html A E Chalon online] (ArtCyclopedia)\n* [http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/peopList.asp?search=sa&sText=Alfred+Edward+Chalon+ Portraits by Alfred Chalon], National Portrait Gallery of London.\n* Portrait of a beautiful Arvanit girl by Alfred Chalon (in the Albanian Wikipedia)\n* [http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?_IXACTION_=file&_IXFILE_=templates/full/person.html&_IXTRAIL_=Academicians&person=5565 Profile on Royal Academy of Arts Collections]\n* The painting  with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon in The Keepsake, 1833.\n* , a painting of a scene from the opera La muette de Portici by Daniel Auber, engraved by J.
