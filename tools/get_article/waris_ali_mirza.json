He succeeded his father, Wasif Ali Mirza.\nBiography\nWaris Ali was born on 14 November 1901 at Murshidabad as the eldest son of Wasif Ali Mirza by his first wife Sultan Dulhan Faghfur Jahan. Waris Ali's maternal grandfather was Wala Kadir Sayyid Husain Ali Mirza Bahadur.\nWaris Ali ruled for ten years, from 1959 until his death on 20 November 1969 at Calcutta. Although he left three sons and three daughters, there was a long interregnum following his death because of succession dispute caused by his children's disinheritance for a variety of reasons.\nIn August 2014 the Indian Supreme Court ruled that Mohammed Abbas Ali Mirza, a nephew of Waris Ali Mirza, was the fourth Nawab of Murshidabad in August 2014.\nHonours\nThe following are some of the honours received by Waris Ali Mirza:\n* Page of Honour to Queen Empress Mary during her Imperial Tour of India with George V (1911–1912)\n* Delhi Durbar Silver Medal (1911)\n* King George V Silver Jubilee Medal (1935)\n* King George VI Coronation Medal (1937)\nFamily\nWives\nThe following are the wives of Waris Ali Mirza:\n* 'Zeenat un-Nisa Begum' Sahiba (née Moselle Meyer).
