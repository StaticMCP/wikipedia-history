      "text": "# Warm Wave\n\nWarm Wave is an album by Latin jazz vibraphonist Cal Tjader fronting an orchestra arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman recorded in 1964 and released on the Verve label.\nReception\n}}\nThe Allmusic review by Stephen Cook stated, \"If an album ever betrayed Cal Tjader's affinity for former boss George Shearing's ultra-smooth cocktail style, then Warm Wave would be it ... this is less standard Latin lounge Tjader and more an analog to Jackie Gleason's polished easy-listening sound. Tjader's solos are so smooth, in fact, that they practically disappear into Claus Ogerman's opaque arrangements. If you are in the business of collecting classic lounge records, this rates as a good one\".\nTrack listing\n# \"Where Or When\" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) – 2:47\n# \"Violets for Your Furs\" (Matt Dennis, Tom Adair) – 3:02\n# \"People\" (Jule Styne, Bob Merrill) – 2:31\n# \"Poor Butterfly\" (Raymond Hubbell, John Golden) – 2:13\n# \"This Time the Dream's on Me\" (Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer) – 1:57\n# \"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\" (Cole Porter) – 2:44\n# \"I'm Old Fashioned\" (Jerome Kern, Mercer) – 2:28\n# \"The Way You Look Tonight\" (Kern, Dorothy Fields) – 3:05\n# \"Just Friends\" (John Klenner, Sam M.
