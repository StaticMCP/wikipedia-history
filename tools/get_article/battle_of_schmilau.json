The pagan Slavs rose up in rebellion against Henry's attempt to seize power.\nHenry was supported by Duke Magnus of Saxony and a Danish contingent, while the pagans were led by Rochel, a Wagrian prince and pirate from the vicinity of Oldenburg. Henry was victorious in the battle at Schmilau, near Ratzeburg in eastern Holstein. The victory allowed Henry to consolidate the Obotrite realm and establish Liubice as his capital.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\nGeneral references\n*\n\n---\n\n## Battle of schmilau\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Schmilau"
