It was part of the peplum series of silent films featuring the strongman Maciste. The character of Maciste increasingly came to resemble Benito Mussolini, in this case striking Fascistic poses and defending order against criminal and dishonest elements.\nCast\n* Bartolomeo Pagano as Maciste\n* Domenico Gambino as Saetta\n* Franz Sala\n* Elena Sangro\n* Oreste Grandi\n* Augusto Bandini\n* Lola Romanos\n* Gero Zambuto\n* Felice Minotti\n* Armand Pouget\n* Lorenzo Soderini\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Gundle, Stephen.
