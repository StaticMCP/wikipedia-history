Some demonstrators called for the death of Jews and attacked Jews and Jewish-owned property. These actions raised concerns over antisemitism and the safety of Jews in European countries. Similar concerns over antisemitism were raised following protests in other countries.\nDuring a rally in the capital of Belgium's Flemish region one speaker reportedly used a loudspeaker to chant in Arabic \"slaughter the Jews.\" A sign on a Belgian cafe declaring that no Jews were allowed inside was removed by following a complaint.

The time has come for the conflict to be waged everywhere the Zionist supporters fund and condone the war killing machine of Israel\".\nAttacks on synagogues\nSynagogues were targeted by pro-Palestinian protesters.

During an anti-Israel rally in front of a synagogue in Turkey, demonstrators pelted the synagogue with eggs.\nAntisemitism in the media\nDuring the war, newspapers throughout the Arab and Muslim world published cartoons with antisemitic caricatures and themes. A mainstream newspaper in Spain published an op-ed which claimed that Israel's military operation demonstrated why Jews were so frequently expelled throughout history, and that \"what is surprising is they persist. Either they are not good, or someone is poisoning them.\" Colombia's premiere weekly magazine also ran an op-ed which stated that Palestinian land has been occupied \"since three thousand years ago, when Jews arrived there escaping from Egypt with Moses and Joshua, cutting heads and foreskins off of local inhabitants, Amalekites, Amorites, Canaanites, etc., to satisfy, they said, the demands of their bigoted one God who had appointed them his chosen people and had promised them all that foreign land.\" In Australia, The Sydney Morning Herald apologized after running a cartoon which was interpreted as antisemitic. Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull had phoned the Herald's editor to express concern. On 19 July, Turkish daily newspaper Yeni Akit used a picture of Adolf Hitler as the centerpiece for its daily word game, and the phrase \"We long for you\" [Seni arıyoruz] as the answer to the puzzle.\nReaction of world leaders\nUN chief Ban condemned the rise of antisemitism in a published statement, declaring that the conflict in the Middle East must not be used as a pretext for prejudice affecting social peace. The foreign ministers of France (Laurent Fabius), Germany (Frank-Walter Steinmeier) and Italy (Federica Mogherini) condemned antisemitic attacks and protests in a joint statement, saying \"antisemitic rhetoric and hostility against Jews, attacks on people of Jewish belief and synagogues have no place in our societies.\" French president François Hollande declared that fighting antisemitism would be a \"national cause\". A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that the Chancellor \"sharply condemns the flare-up of violence and the antisemitic utterances\" as \"an attack on freedom and tolerance and an attempt to undermine our free democratic order. This is something we can't and won't accept.\"\nHolocaust survivors\nMany Holocaust survivors were among the elderly in Israel who donated money to help IDF soldiers in Gaza, totaling over 100,000 shekels, saying \"It's the least we can do\". Some individuals compared helping the IDF to helping allied soldiers during WWII, with one saying \"Now we must contribute to soldiers that are protecting us. My husband was a pilot, he fought for four years during the war and was seriously wounded. For me, donating is not a mitzva but rather a duty.\" and another saying \"I served as an officer and a military doctor in the Red Army in the Soviet Union. It's the least we can do in this difficult atmosphere of war. As long as there's a continued threat to Israel's existence, we must all pitch in order to protect it.\"\nOther Holocaust survivors both inside and outside of Israel were shocked about the rising anti-Semitism masked as anti-Israel criticism, with one saying \"It's ok not to agree with the Israeli government, like lots of people do over here. But if they are yelling 'kill all Jews' during protests, you haven't learned anything from the past.\" and another saying \"I am deeply worried about the future of my children and grandchildren. Most of the elderly people are afraid. Everybody hates us. We are being surrounded by danger.\"\nNobel laureate Elie Wiesel said Hamas must stop using children as human shields, adding \"Do the two cultures that brought us the Psalms of David and the rich libraries of the Ottoman Empire not share a love of life, of transmitting wisdom and opportunity to their children? And is any of this discernible in the dark future offered by Hamas to Arab children, to be suicide bombers or human shields for rockets? Palestinian parents want a hopeful future for their children, just like Israeli parents do. And both should be joining together in peace.\"\nSee also\n* International reactions to the Gaza war\nReferences\nExternal links"
