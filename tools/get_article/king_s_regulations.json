Originally, a single set of regulations were published in one volume. By the mid 19th century, there were separate editions of the ''Queen's Regulations'' for the Navy and the Army, and there is now one for each of the United Kingdom's armed forces.\nHistory\nThe first issue of what became the ''Queen's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions was issued in 1731 as the Regulations and Instructions Relating to His Majesty's Service at Sea. Numerous further editions have appeared since then, and from the 19th century the title was altered to the Queen's [or King's] Regulations and Admiralty Instructions. Naval editions with this title were published by H.M. Stationery Office as recently as 1959 and 1964.\nIn 1868, Chambers's Encyclopaedia'' noted that the Queen's Regulations for the Navy \"in a great degree regulate matters of finance; whereas, in the army, financial matters are left to the War Office regulations\".\nThe historian of the British Empire Edward Jenks wrote in 1918 that: }}\nIn a legal work of 1907, Sir Frederick Pollock defined the \"King's Regulations and Orders for the Army and Navy\" thus:\nUnder \"King's Regulations and Orders for the Army\", Herbert Mason states\nProhibition of political discussions\nIt has been a matter of discipline since at least the 1844 edition of Wellington that,\nOfficers, Non-commissioned Officers, and Soldiers are forbidden to institute, countenance, or attend Orange-Lodges, or any other Meetings whatever, for Party or Political Purposes, in Barracks, Quarters, Camp, or wheresoever held.\nIn 1889, Sir Garnet Wolseley amended the prohibition to read,\nOfficers, Non-commissioned Officers, and private soldiers are forbidden to institute, or take part in any meetings, demonstrations, or processions for party or political purposes, in barracks, quarters or camps, or their vicinity; and under no circumstances whatever will they do so in uniform.\nCurrent editions\n*''[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a80325fed915d74e33f9053/prelims_QR_RoyalNavy.pdf The Queen's Regulations for the Royal Navy] (1997)\n*[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5d5aaa46e5274a07640aefc7/The_Queen_s_Regulations_for_the_Army_1975.pdf The Queen's Regulations for the Army] (1975)\n*The Queen's Regulations for the Royal Air Force (1999)\nFrequent updates are issued.\nSelected past editions\n;Army\n*[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175033163091;view=1up;seq=7 General Orders and Regulations] (Calvert ed. - Temple Bar, London: C.
