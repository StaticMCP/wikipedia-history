Brown\n\n| birth_place = Wheatland, Wyoming, U.S.\n| death_date =\n| death_place = Soper, Oklahoma, U.S.\n|awards = 1962 RCA World Champion bull rider\n}}\nWarren Granger \"Freckles\" Brown (January 18, 1921 &ndash; March 20, 1987) was a hall of fame American rodeo cowboy from Wheatland, Wyoming. His career spanned from 1937 to 1974, competing in bull riding, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, team roping, and steer wrestling. He was the World Bull Riding Champion in 1962. Brown was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colorado, for bull riding in 1979. He was also inducted into the inaugural class of the Bull Riding Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, in 2015. Brown was most famous for riding Tornado, who had an undefeated record of 220 riders. Brown was also a close friend and mentor of Lane Frost.\nEarly career\nBrown began competitive rodeo in Willcox, Arizona in 1937, at the age of 16. In 1941, he won his first bull riding trophy by riding his horse to Cody, Wyoming, before riding back again.\nWorld War II\nBrown enlisted to join the U.S. army, and undertook basic training in Fort Sill. He studied horseshoeing while stationed at Fort Riley.  He was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and \"did his part by helping to train Chinese paratroopers in secret\". The war ended in the summer of 1945, and Brown \"returned to China to compete in a Red Cross-sponsored event in which U.S. pack mules were used in place of saddle-broncs and barebacks and native cattle were rounded up for bull riding. Brown left China with the all-around title\".\n1962 World Championship\nBrown was injured badly in October 1962 at the rodeo in Portland, Oregon. While riding a bull name \"Black Smoke\" for 8 seconds, the bull flipped Brown, who fell on his head, paralyzing him. The doctor \"pulled on his head and feeling returned to his right side and left foot\". He was operated on and put in traction for 34 days, followed by a plaster cast \"from his waist to the top of his brow for over 2 months\". He had saved enough money to win the Championship. His earnings in 1962 were $18,675. Brown competed in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (formerly the Rodeo Cowboys Association)..During that year he won the World Bull Riding Championship at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) while he was on the sidelines watching.\nTornado, the unrideable bull\nBrown is remembered for riding an \"unrideable\" bull named Tornado in December 1967. The bull, owned by Jim Shoulders, had thrown over 200 riders over a 14-year period before Brown's successful ride, and was considered the ultimate challenge on the bull-riding circuit, but Brown stayed on for the 8 seconds required, in front of 6,000 people. Tornado died in 1972 as unridden by 220 professional riders except for Brown and two others, and was buried on the grounds of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum, near two notable bucking horses, Midnight and Five Minutes Til Midnight. Brown, this ride, and Tornado are all memorialized in Red Steagall's song, \"Freckles Brown\".\nAwards and recognition\n* 1962 West Best Cowboy (World Champion) Award\n* 1972 For the 1971 Film/Television - Western Documentary - \"Rodeo,\" Concepts Unlimited, Inc and Contemporary Films/McGraw Hill; Gaby Monet, Producer; Carroll Ballard, Director; Freckles Brown & Larry Mahan, Actors.
