They exist to maintain standards, protect working ability and support the people using or breeding working dogs. They differ from kennel clubs primarily due to their difference in perspective on preserving and handling working dogs, and are usually run by trainers, farmers and handlers, rather than show exhibitors and pet breeders.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Country\n!Working dog association\n!Information\n!Sources\n|-\n|United States\n|American Herding Breed Association (AHBA)\n|The AHBA was founded in 1986 to facilitate herding trials in a variety of herding breeds.\n|\n|-\n|United States\n|American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA)\n|The ADBA was founded in 1909 and is one of the oldest registries for the American Pit Bull Terrier.
