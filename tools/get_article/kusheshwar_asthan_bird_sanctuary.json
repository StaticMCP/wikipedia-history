The sanctuary is named after the nearby Kusheshwar Asthan temple, a prominent Hindu pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Shiva.\nDescription\nThe sanctuary was officially established in 1994 under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and encompasses approximately  of predominantly waterlogged terrain across 14 villages in Kusheshwar Asthan block.  It lies in the northern Gangetic plains at an average elevation of 49 m above sea level and is sustained by seasonal monsoon rains and overflow from the Kamla River.\nFlora and fauna\nThe sanctuary features shallow wetlands, marshes, and surrounding grasslands with aquatic vegetation such as water hyacinth and local grasses.\nIt serves as the winter refugia for over 15 endangered migratory species—including the Dalmatian Pelican (Pelecanus crispus), Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus), Bar-headed Goose (Anser indicus), and Indian Darter (Anhinga melanogaster)—which arrive from Siberia, Mongolia, Tibet, and Central Asia between October and March.\nResident avifauna include Indian Peafowl (Pavo cristatus), Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea), and the endemic Brahminy Duck (Tadorna ferruginea).\nConservation and management\nIn August 2017, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change issued the final notification declaring a 10&nbsp;km Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) around the sanctuary to regulate developmental activities and protect habitat integrity.  Despite legal safeguards, a 2019 report highlighted rapid shrinkage of wetlands due to agricultural encroachment and water diversion, raising alarms over the sanctuary’s carrying capacity for migratory birds.  Local media also reported ongoing cultivation on sanctuary lands and delays in infrastructure improvements, prompting fresh appeals for stricter enforcement of protection orders.\nSee also\n* Bhoramdev Wildlife Sanctuary\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://egazette.gov.in/WriteReadData/2017/184239.pdf Final ESZ notification—Gazette of India]\n* [https://tourism.gov.in/sites/default/files/2023-04/9%20Compendium%20Book_2021_Low%20%281%29%20%282%29.pdf National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries in India (2021) – Ministry of Tourism]\n* [https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-wasted-wetlands-ring-alarm-bells-for-birds/story-8KvQmWvED9Z2JkfzTvevjM.html Bihar wasted wetlands ring alarm bells for birds – Hindustan Times]\n* [https://www.bhaskar.com/local/bihar/darbhanga/kusheshwar-asthan/news/the-system-is-seeing-birds-here-but-on-paper-it-is-a-bird-sanctuary-133157833.html अभयारण्य में हो रही खेती, पक्षी अब कम आते हैं – Dainik Bhaskar]"
