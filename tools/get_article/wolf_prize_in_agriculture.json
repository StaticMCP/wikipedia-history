      "text": "# Wolf Prize in Agriculture\n\nThe Wolf Prize in Agriculture is awarded annually since 1978 by the Wolf Foundation in Israel. It is one of the six Wolf Prizes, alongside those for chemistry, mathematics, medicine, physics and arts. It is sometimes unofficially called a Nobel Prize in Agriculture.\nLaureates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccccc\"\n! style=\"width:7%\" |Year\n! style=\"width:21%\" | Name\n! style=\"width:18%\" | Nationality\n!
