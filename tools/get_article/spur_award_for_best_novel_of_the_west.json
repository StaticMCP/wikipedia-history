It was introduced for the awards' 1988 iteration, replacing the earlier category of Best Historical Novel.\nFor a period, the Spur Awards included a Best Western Novel category as well as a Best Novel of the West category. John Mort explains the distinction in his book Read the High Country: \"WWA defines Westerns... in market terms. A Western novel is a 'traditional' tale of revenge, rival cattlemen at war, or settlers fighting Indians. Owen Wister's The Virginian is a famous example, as well as Louis L'Amour's Hondo. A 'novel of the West' is what's otherwise known as a historical, where characterizations are based around historical events, and historical personages such as Davy Crockett, George Armstrong Custer, and Crazy Horse become characters.\"\nDuring 2000, the official Spurs Award website defined both categories as \"book-length novels... dependent in whole or in part on settings, characters, conditions, or customs indigenous to the American West or early frontier,\" the distinction being that Best Western Novel was for works \"90,000 words or less\" while Best Novel of the West was for works \"90,000 words or more.\"\nThe category was used for the final time in the 2006 iteration of the Spur Awards. After that, the awards' categorization system was reworked, with the new categories of Best Short Novel and Best Long Novel introduced. This division remained until the 2014 awards, which removed Best Short Novel and Best Long Novel and re-added Best Western Historical Novel, also introducing the new category Best Western Contemporary Novel.\nList of Winners\n1953 – 1987: Best Historical Novel\n* 1953 – The Wheel and the Hearth by Lucia Moore\n* 1954 – Journey by the River by John Prescott\n* 1955 – No Award given\n* 1956 – Generations of Men by John Clinton Hunt\n* 1957 – Silver Mountain by Dan Cushman\n* 1958 – The Fancher Train by Amelia Bean\n* 1959 – The Buffalo Soldiers by John Prebble\n* 1960 – From Where the Sun Now Stands by Will Henry\n* 1961 – The Winter War by William Wister Haines\n* 1962 – Moontrap by Don Berry\n* 1963 – Gates of the Mountains by Will Henry (2)\n* 1964 – Indian Fighter by F.
