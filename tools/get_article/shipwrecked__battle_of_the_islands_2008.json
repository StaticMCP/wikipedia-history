The 2008 series is the sixth series of Shipwrecked, and the third series to use the \"Battle Of The Islands\" format.\nThis series used a different process to determine the winning team. A third secret island known as Hawk Island was revealed to the other two islands in the final week when they returned to evaluate and vote for the team they felt had done a better job of welcoming them back. All the residents of Hawk (save for one) had been exiled from either the Sharks or the Tigers when they lost out to the other person in their new arrival pair.\nThe Game\nShipwrecked is a reality programme in which a number of people from the UK live on one of two islands (Shark Island and Tiger Island) for a period of several months. Each week, new arrivals come to the islands, spend equal time on each island and must decide at the weekly beach party which island they wish to live on for the remainder of the competition. At the end of the series, the island with the most castaways wins, with the winning islanders sharing a cash prize of £100,000. The winning island with 21 members was the Tigers; the Sharks had 14 members.\nFor Shipwrecked 2008, a new twist was introduced. Each week two new arrivals to the competition spend an equal amount of time on each island and make their decision on which island they wish to permanently live on. However, the chosen island could only select one new arrival to keep and make an official Tiger or Shark, with the other new arrival \"sent home\". Contrary to what the islanders believe, the \"rejected\" new arrival is sent to a secret third island hidden away from Shark and Tiger islands. The third island acts as a survival island, whereby those who decide to stay must survive on basic conditions, with no luxuries, no protein (except for the island's wildlife), with no knowledge of the role they would later play in the competition.\nTelevision programmes\nIn addition to the main programme, two companion shows were broadcast for the 2008 series. Shipwrecked: The Third Island followed the week's events on Hawk Island, including the arrival of the newly rejected castaway from Tiger and Shark Islands, and the goings-on on \"Hawk Island\".  Shipwrecked: The Hutcam Diaries supplemented the events of the main programme by focusing on the castaway's daily lives, and tribulations, from the point of view of the islands' hutcam.\nMain Islands\nIn Week One, six castaways (Danny, Faith, Barrie, Katie, James and Lara) set foot on Shark island, who, two days later, were joined by another six castaways (Tom, Carly, Jack, Char, Marvyn and Susan).  Although initially confused by the arrival of more people onto their island, the original islanders and their guests quickly settled into island life.  However, only a matter of days into the competition, Katie, one of the original six, decided to leave the competition to be later replaced by Keris, 26.&nbsp;\nAt the end of the first week, the inaugural beach party was held.  The twelve castaways were instructed to split into two equal sized groups.  The islanders decided to remain in their groups of six based on those whom they arrived with, despite the disapproval of Tom who had wished to remain on the same island as Danny, one of the first six on the island.  The groups later decided which group would be Tigers and which group would become the Sharks, with the first islanders (Barrie, Danny, Faith, James, Keris, and Lara) becoming the Sharks, and the second group of islanders becoming the Tigers (Carly, Char, Jack, Marvyn, Susan and Tom).  However, in a shocking twist, the newly formed tribes were provided with only five tribal necklaces each, revealing the twist that one of the original castaways in each tribe would have to leave the competition, and make the long journey back to the UK.  After much deliberation, both tribes decided to make their decision on whom to send home by randomly picking sticks. In the end, Char and James had to leave, and promptly left the islands, in the belief that they were on their home to the UK...&nbsp;\nfor the last week both tribes are feeling nervous over what will have in store for them after no new arrivals come ashore after the beach party.\nThe next day two boats are spotted by Adam  in the distance with the 13 inhabitants from the secret third island heading towards Tiger Island and Shark Island. The seven girls visit the Shark's first and the six boys go over to Tiger Island.\nThe Sharks entertained the girls to game called donkey derby. Meanwhile, over on Tiger Island the six lads play football. When the new arrivals swap islands, the Tigers are excited to see fellow original Char, as are the Sharks with original James.\nWith the day of the final beach party looming, the new arrivals all discuss the difficulty of making a tough decision on which island they will choose at the final Shipwrecked Beach Party on 20 July.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#1560BD\" align=\"center\"|Sharks\n| rowspan=15 bgcolor=\"#000000\"|\n| colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#FF6600\" align=\"center\"| Tigers\n|-\n!

The third island itself is very different from Tiger and Shark islands. The island is harsher, denser, and surrounded by a hostile reef.\nThe Third Island inhabitants (the self-proclaimed Hawk tribe) were stripped of luxuries and were given minimal rations, with any dietary protein provided by hunting after the island's wildlife, including three pigs and a number of chickens. To assist in their survival, Nick Weston, a survival expert, helped the new arrivals adjust to the tougher conditions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#004F00\" align=\"center\"|Hawks\n|-\n!

Michael also left after spending a day on the third island, after complaining of feeling homesick.  Sarah later left Hawk island after complaining of headaches.&nbsp;\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Arrival Week\n! Week Departed\n! Original Tribe\n!
