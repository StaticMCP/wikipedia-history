It was announced in April 2022 that Apple TV+ had ordered an eight-episode miniseries, with Momoa set to star in and executive produce. Justin Chon was set to direct two episodes of the series that same month. Momoa and Sibbett co-wrote all episodes, with assistance on Hawaiian language dialogue provided by staff of Awaiaulu, an archiving and translation company based in Honolulu. Cultural advisors were appointed in every production department to achieve as high a degree of authenticity as possible, even as far as building war vessels (waʻa) from scratch using real local materials and historical techniques.\nHans Zimmer and James Everingham collaborated with musician Kaumakaiwa Kanakaʻole for the soundtrack that incorporated traditional instruments.\nCasting announcements in October and November revealed that Temuera Morrison, Luciane Buchanan, Te Ao o Hinepehinga, Kaina Makua, Moses Goods, Siua Ikaleʻo, Brandon Finn, James Udom, Mainei Kinimaka, and Te Kohe Tuhaka had joined the cast. Cliff Curtis would join in a recurring role in February 2023. Buchanan had auditioned prior through a long-distance Zoom table reading from Los Angeles with Momoa. Kaina Makua had no prior acting experience and was a taro farmer and canoe racing coach before being recommended by both Momoa and later a cultural advisor to Sibbett.\nFilming for the series began by October 2022 in New Zealand, with Bay of Islands being used to stand in for 18th century Hawaiʻi. Major battle scenes were filmed from middle November to December in the lava fields of Kalapana; filming still continued when Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in more than three decades during this period.\nEpisodes\n|ShortSummary    = Kaʻiana, a war chief of Maui exiled to Kauaʻi, is summoned by the King of Maui, Kahekili, who wants Kaʻiana and his brothers,  Namake and Nāhi, to help him conquer Oʻahu as part of a prophecy predicting the unification of Hawaii. While Kaʻiana is reluctant, Kahekili convinces Kaʻiana by giving him his father’s bones, claiming they were desecrated by Oʻahu warriors trying to steal the bones’ mana to attack Maui.  Kaʻiana invades Oʻahu with a war fleet, but is horrified when he realizes that Kahekili had lied and Oʻahu was not planning to attack Maui. Kahekili executes the young king of O’ahu and has the island’s malae burned. An outraged Kaʻiana plans with his brothers to betray Kahekili.\n|LineColor       = 3A5B82\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Kahekili realizes that Kaʻiana has betrayed him and correctly surmises that they have returned to Maui to collect Heke, the sister to Kaʻiana’s wife Kupuohi. He sends a war party led by his son, Prince Kūpule, to hunt down Kaʻiana and his brothers. After Kaʻiana and his brothers land at Maui, they are separated as they fight off the warriors of Maui. Kaʻiana encounters the noble princess Kaʻahumanu, who is preparing to leave for the island of Hawaiʻi with her father, chief Moku, to escape Kahekili’s rule and cement her betrothal to the chief of Kohala, Kamehameha. Kaʻiana helps Kaʻahumanu dodge Maui patrols and convinces her to allow his family to accompany her to Hawaiʻi. Meanwhile, a shore party from a British ship captained by John Meares is surprised by Maui warriors and in their haste leave behind a sailor named John Young. Kaʻahumanu and Kaʻiana’s family escape to Hawaiʻi along with John Young, while Kaʻiana falls off a cliff while fighting off Kūpule’s warriors and is presumed dead, only to be picked up by Meares, who is heading to Alaska to hunt for furs.\n|LineColor       = 3A5B82\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = A year has passed since Kaʻahumanu and Kaʻiana’s family escaped to Hawaiʻi. On Oʻahu, Kahekili resorts to increasingly brutal methods to suppress holdout chiefs, executing entire families who he deems “impure”. On Hawaiʻi, the dying King Kalaniʻōpuʻu gathers his chiefs at Kaʻū, including his nephew Kamehameha and his son Keōua to discuss the rising threat of Kahekili. Moku arranges for Kaʻahumanu and Kamehameha to be wed and confides to Kaʻahumanu that he believes Kamehameha to be the prophesied king to unite the kingdoms. Meanwhile, Kaʻiana, who has accompanied Meares to Alaska, learns of the power of firearms and becomes friends with Tony, a Black crewmate. Meares docks at Zamboanga in the Spanish East Indies and Kaʻiana tries to buy firearms to help fight Kahekili. He is aided by Vai, a native Hawaiian trader who recognized his distinctive feather cloak. Kaʻiana and Vai pitch a deal to Meares to supply them with firearms in exchange for sandalwood. A treacherous member of Meares’ crew, Marley, sells the location of the Hawaiian islands to American captain Simon Metcalfe and kidnaps Tony into slavery.\n|LineColor       = 3A5B82\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = On Hawaiʻi, King Kalaniʻōpuʻu dies and his son Keōua becomes king, but the late king bestows Kamehameha with the feathered idol of the war god Kū and the power to wage war. Keōua is outraged but Kamehameha refuses to relinquish the idol or the power. Kamehameha, unsure of his next steps, consults Kaʻahumanu, who urges him to trust his own judgement. John Young teaches Kaʻahumanu and others in Kohala to speak English, and also about the Western world. Meanwhile, believing Kaʻiana to be dead, Kaʻiana’s wife Kupuohi and brother Namake grow close in their shared grief and initiate a romantic relationship, to Nāhi and Heke’s chagrin. In Zamboanga, Kaʻiana discovers that Tony has been kidnapped into slavery. He raids the slave market, rescuing Tony, and barely catches Meares leaving port with Vai.\n|LineColor       = 3A5B82\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = On Hawaiʻi, Kamehameha decides to be cautious; against the advice of Moku and his advisors, he does not preemptively attack King Keōua, who continues to resent Kamehameha. Meares’s ship returns to Hawaiʻi, reuniting Kaʻiana with his family, Vai with her son, and John Young with the crew. Kaʻiana rekindles his relationship with Kupuohi, unaware of her romance with Namake. Kaʻiana offers to join Kamehameha’s council of chiefs and provide firearms against Kahekili, but Moku and Kamehameha are unconvinced and suspicious. Kamehameha decides to host a lava sledding race between him, Ka’iana, and his brothers to decide whether the gods wish for him to heed Kaʻiana’s counsel. Kaʻiana wins, and Kamehameha accepts Kaʻiana’s offer of an alliance.

Prince Kūpule grows uneasy with his father Kahekili’s increasingly erratic and bloodthirsty behavior. His friend and lover Lima urges him to take the throne to preserve Maui.

Kaʻiana, wary of the men, especially Marley who tried to sell Tony into slavery in Zamboanga, counsels Kamehameha to kill them, but he refuses. Kaʻiana and Tony decide to try to kill Marley themselves on Metcalfe’s ship but are stopped by Kamehameha, who orders Metcalfe to leave in peace. Kaʻiana and his family quarrel over Kamehameha’s decision. Metcalfe, angry at being denied the sandalwood, opens fire on a village, killing and maiming hundreds of Hawaiians, and throws Marley overboard.\n|LineColor       = 3A5B82\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Kaʻiana berates Kamehameha for not killing Metcalfe and his men, and decides to return to his exile in Kauaʻi. Before Kaʻiana leaves for Kauaʻi, Nāhi and Heke, who are now in a relationship, visit a sacred niu grove and find King Keōua and Maui warriors under ʻŌpūnui ravaging it. Keōua kills Nāhi, forcing Heke to watch. ʻŌpūnui rapes Heke before sending her back with Keōua's message.

Kupuohi convinces Kamehameha to accept Kaʻiana’s guns, calling them the \"Voice of Kū.\" Kamehameha and Kaʻahumanu convince Kaʻiana to stay, as Kamehameha accepts the inevitability of bloodshed with Keōua and Kahekili.

Meanwhile, Namake confesses to Kaʻiana his relationship with Kupuohi before Kaʻiana’s return, with Kaʻiana forgiving Namake. Before the battle, Kamehameha prays to the idol of Kū, proclaims Kaʻiana a chief of Hawaiʻi, and elevates Queen Kaʻahumanu to be one of his formal advisors. At a lava plain near a volcano, Kamehameha’s army meets Keōua’s army combined with ʻŌpūnui’s detachment of Maui warriors in a pitched battle. During the ritualized taunting before the battle, Kaʻiana goads ʻŌpūnui into ordering an attack, which is cut down by musket fire. A fierce melee ensues as the volcano erupts, wiping out a large portion of Keōua’s army. ʻŌpūnui is killed by Heke in revenge for Nāhi’s death and her own rape, and Keōua is killed by a blast from the erupting volcano.
