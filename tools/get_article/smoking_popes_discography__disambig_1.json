With drummer Dave Martens they released their debut EP Inoculator through local Chicago label Radius Records. Martens was then replaced by Mike Felumlee and the band released the EPs Break Up (1992) and 2 (1993) themselves. Josh and Matt's brother Eli Caterer then joined on second guitar and the band signed to local label Johann's Face Records, releasing their debut album Get Fired in 1993.\nThe band's second album, Born to Quit, was released in 1994 through Johann's Face. Smoking Popes then signed to major label Capitol Records, who re-released Born to Quit in the summer of 1995. It became their only release to chart, reaching #37 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart, partly on the strength of the single \"Need You Around\" which reached #35 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Destination Failure followed in 1997. They next recorded an album of cover songs titled ''The Party's Over'', but Capitol rejected it and the band broke up in December 1998.\nFollowing Smoking Popes' breakup Josh and Eli Caterer and Mike Felumlee performed together in Duvall. Felumlee also founded Double Zero Records and released several albums of previously recorded Smoking Popes material: the compilation 1991–1998 appeared in 1999, followed by Live in 2000 and a release of the Capitol-rejected ''The Party's Over'' in 2001.\nIn November 2005 Smoking Popes, with drummer Rob Kellenberger, reunited to play Chicago's Flower 15 festival. The performance was recorded and released as the CD/DVD package At Metro through Victory Records in February 2006. Ryan Chavez drummed on the band's fifth studio album, Stay Down, released in 2008 through Curb Appeal Records. Neil Hennessy of fellow Chicago punk rock band The Lawrence Arms became Smoking Popes' permanent drummer prior to the album's release. In February 2010 Asian Man Records released the compilation album ''It's Been a Long Day''. The band's sixth studio album, This Is Only a Test, was released March 15, 2011 through Asian Man.\nStudio albums\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Year\n!rowspan=\"3\"|Album details\n!Peak chart positions\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" align=\"center\"|US\n|-\n!Heatseekers\n|-\n|1993\n|Get Fired\n* Released: 1993\n* Label: Johann's Face (JFR011)\n* Formats: LP, CD\n|align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n|1994\n|Born to Quit\n* Released: 1994\n* Label: Johann's Face\n* Formats: CD\n|align=\"center\"| 37\n|-\n|1997\n|Destination Failure\n* Released: August 26, 1997\n* Label: Capitol (CDP724383821723)\n* Formats: CD\n|align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n|2001\n|''The Party's Over\n* Released: 2001\n* Label: Double Zero (DZ0012)\n* Formats: CD\n|align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n|2008\n|Stay Down\n* Released: August 5, 2008\n* Label: Curb Appeal\n* Formats: CD\n|align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n|2011\n|This Is Only a Test\n* Released: March 15, 2011\n* Label: Asian Man\n* Formats: CD\n|align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n|2018\n|Into the Agony\n* Released: October 12, 2018\n* Label: Asian Man\n* Formats: LP, Digital\n|align=\"center\"| —\n|-\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart.\n|}\nLive albums\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Album details\n|-\n|2000\n|Live\n* Released: April 25, 2000\n* Label: Double Zero (DZ0003)\n* Formats: CD\n|-\n|2006\n|At Metro\n* Released: February 28, 2006\n* Label: Victory (VR295)\n* Formats: CD/DVD\n|-\n|}\nCompilation albums\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Album details\n|-\n|1999\n|1991–1998\n* Released: August 17, 1999\n* Label: Double Zero (DZ001)\n* Format: CD\n|-\n|2010\n|It's Been a Long Day\n* Released: February 16, 2010\n* Label: Asian Man (AMR0192)\n* Format: CD\n|-\n|}\nEPs\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Album details\n|-\n|1991\n|Inoculator\n* Released: 1991\n* Label: Radius\n* Format: EP\n|-\n|1992\n|Break Up\n* Released: 1992\n* Label: none\n* Format: EP\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1993\n|2\n* Released: 1993\n* Label: none\n* Format: EP\n|-\n|Smoking Popes / Groovy Love Vibes''\n* Released: 1993\n* Label: Johann's Face (JFR009)\n* Format: EP\n|-\n|1997\n|Egg Nog\n* Released: 1997\n* Label: Capitol (7PRO-11335/11336)\n* Format: 7\"\n|-\n|2012\n|Complete Control Recording Sessions\n* Released: May 22, 2012\n* Label: Side One Dummy (SD1488-7)\n* Format: 7\", download\n|-\n|}\nI Egg Nog is a promotional holiday release limited to 1,500 copies.
