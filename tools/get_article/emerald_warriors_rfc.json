They play in the Leinster Metro League Division 10 and 7 and are members of the International Gay Rugby Association and Board. They are the reigning bronze final champions since Union Cup Madrid 2017. The Warriors are Ireland's first primarily gay rugby team although it is open to anyone with an interest in playing rugby and includes heterosexual members.\nHistory\nEmerald Warriors RFC was formed in August 2003 by Richie Whyte to provide gay and bisexual men the opportunity to play rugby in Ireland and internationally and to create links with similar teams and organisations in the UK, Europe and America. The team began playing in 2004 and took part in the Bingham Cup, often referred to as the 'Gay World Cup' that year, representing Ireland. They competed again in 2006 and went on to host the event in 2008, in Dublin City University's sports complex with endorsement from the IRFU. The event was deemed a success for rugby in general, for bringing gay rugby in Ireland to a new level of organisation and popularity by The Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (GLEN). They entered the Leinster Metro Junior league in 2007. They also competed in the Union Cup a biennial European, non-professional, gay rugby union tournament in London 2009, Amsterdam 2011 and Bristol 2013.\nAchievements\n*The International Gay Rugby (IGR) Union Cup, Oslo, 2025 – Overall Winners\n*The Bingham Cup, Ottawa, 2022 – Bingham Plate winners.\n*The Union Cup, Madrid, 2017 – Bronze final winners.\n*The Hadrian Cup, Newcastle, 2017 – Overall winners.\n*The Union Cup, Newcastle, 2017 – Bronze Plate.\n*The Bingham Cup, Minneapolis 2010 - Bingham Shield.\n*The Union Cup, Copenhagen, 2007 – 7s Champions.\nCrest and colours\nThe club colours are green, white and blue.

The documentary, which was directed by Tom Maguire, was also screened at GAZE: The Dublin International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival in 2007.\nMention in court ruling\nThe club was mentioned in a 2009 Irish Supreme Court judgment on Portmarnock Golf Club when ruling on equality legislation regarding whether the club could prohibit women from joining. It ruled there is no prohibition on the establishment of clubs or associations whose membership is limited to persons of a particular gender and made a specific reference to the Emerald Warriors recognising that rugby is not a \"need\" of gay men.\nOther events\nThe Emerald Warriors hosted the Mark Bingham Memorial Cup in 2008 and will host the Union Cup in 2019. The team and its members have also taken part in events such as the Dublin Pride Parade and Mr Gay Ireland, with club member Barry Meegan who was asked by his teammates to represent the club, winning the competition in 2007 and raising money for HIV and AIDS related charities based in Dublin in the process.\nSee also\n* Ulster Titans\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcM8pgavu6E Bingham Cup 2008 – SF Fog v Emerald Warriors]"
