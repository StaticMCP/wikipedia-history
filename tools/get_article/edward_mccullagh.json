In 1948, he won a by-election in Mid Tyrone and was elected to the Parliament of Northern Ireland for the Nationalist Party. His chief interests in Parliament were farming and rural issues.\nMcCullagh held his seat at the 1949 general election, then worked with the Nationalist MPs Cahir Healy and Joe Connellan and the independent Republican Charles McGleenan in lobbying for admission to the Dáil, as elected representatives of territory it claimed.  A motion from Con Lehane proposing this was rejected.\nMcCullagh lost his seat to the Anti-Partition candidate Liam Kelly at the 1953 general election.\nHe died in 1986.\nReferences"
