A few months later, at a public meeting held near Rabaul on October 16th, 1968, he was elected as President of the Melanesian Independence Party, who pledged to work constitutionally towards independence for New Guinea islands. The Front was also active in Bougainville.\nThe Front has adopted the frangipani as emblem to represent New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, the Admiralty Islands, and other islands within the region. It submitted candidates for all of thirteen islands' electorates to the House of Assembly, and called for an independence referendum. It envisioned the creation of a new country called Melanesia which was to become a member of the United Nations, and the British Commonwealth with the governor based in Rabaul.\nThe party was opposed by The United Niugini Political Party and the United Islands Progress Society (later merged into the Islands Political Society), which reaffirmed the necessity of the Territory's unity, and by the Anglican Church of Australia. By 1969, the Party was dissolved.\nReferences"
