The first COVID-19 death in the UK occurred on 5 March 2020; 18 days later, the death toll reached 335. In response, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the UK would go into a full lockdown, with new restrictions on gathering socially with people from different households. As the pandemic continued, the rules for socialising evolved: on 16 September, the government introduced a new \"rule of six\" in England, whereby groups of more than six people were banned from meeting, and, the following month, Johnson unveiled new \"three-tier\" regulations, with London being placed in the \"medium\" tier&nbsp;1 restrictions. Lockdown rules in England continued in some form until 19 July 2021, at which point almost all of them were lifted.\nDespite these new regulations, social gatherings continued to take place in Downing Street and Whitehall \"most Fridays\", including some that were attended by the Prime Minister. In May, a cheese and wine party and a bring your own beer (BYOB) event were held in the Downing Street garden. On Johnson's 56th birthday in June, a surprise party was thrown for him in the Cabinet Office, with a second party in his flat later that evening. In December, various Christmas parties were thrown, including one in the Downing Street Press Office on 18 December that involved a Secret Santa and an awards ceremony. Two leaving dos were held on 16 April 2021, the eve of the funeral of Prince Philip.\nNews articles about these events began to appear in late 2021, with the majority of them published by Pippa Crerar, the political editor of the Daily Mirror, and Paul Brand, UK editor of ITV News. The story was first broken under Crerar's byline on 30 November 2021, with details of three parties. Seven days later, a video showing the Press Secretary Allegra Stratton joking about the Christmas party in the Downing Street Press Office was broadcast by ITV News. Speaking in Parliament the following day, Johnson said that he was sickened and furious to see the clip, but that \"the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times\".\nAs details of the parties continued to be revealed in news stories throughout 2021 and 2022, investigations into them were announced. In December 2021, an inquiry led by the civil servant Sue Gray was started. Gray's completed report, published in May 2022, criticised the senior leadership at both Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, and said that they must bear responsibility for \"failures of leadership and judgment\". In January 2022, a criminal investigation into breaches of lockdown rules at Downing Street was launched by the Metropolitan Police. As a result of the operation, 126 fixed penalty notices were issued, including one to Johnson for attending his surprise birthday party, making him the first serving prime minister to be found to have broken the law. Johnson subsequently resigned as prime minister on 7 July 2022, and as a member of parliament (MP) the following year.\nLockdown parties\n2020\n*30 January: Two Chinese nationals staying at a hotel in York fall ill with the 2019 novel coronavirus and become its first cases in the UK.\n*5 March: A woman in her 70s becomes the first person in the UK to die from COVID-19.\n*23 March: With the UK death toll having reached 335, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces in a televised address that the UK will go into a full lockdown.

Johnson decries the committee's conclusions as \"deranged\".\n*17 June: The Daily Mirror publishes the first Partygate video clip, showing Conservative aides drinking, dancing and laughing at Bailey's Christmas party on 14 December 2020.\n*19 June:\n**BBC News publishes the invitation to Bailey's Christmas party and reveals that it was formally called a \"Jingle and Mingle\" party. Bailey apologises \"unreservedly\" for the party.\n**In the House of Commons, MPs vote by 354 to 7 to endorse the committee's findings that Johnson committed five contempts of Parliament. This includes a revocation of Johnson's privilege to access Parliament.\n*4 July: The Metropolitan Police announce that they will reopen the investigation into Bailey's Christmas party, but that they and Thames Valley Police will not investigate the allegations of rule-breaking in Chequers, citing \"further clarification\" on Johnson's diary entries.\n*13 October: The police announce that they have referred an additional 24 FPNs to the ACRO for Bailey's Christmas party.\nAftermath\nThe Partygate scandal is remembered as having contributed to the decline of Johnson's premiership and his standing as a politician. An opinion poll by the market research firm YouGov on 13 February 2022 revealed that 70% of respondents regarded Johnson as performing badly as prime minister, compared with 25% who felt that he was doing well. In the three months after the Partygate story was broken, Johnson's approval ratings dropped by almost 15 percentage points. His assertion on 8 December 2021 that \"the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times\" was pivotal in the committee's finding that he had misled Parliament, and was described by Archie Mitchell of The Independent as \"the 12 words that sparked Boris Johnson's downfall\". Anger over the scandal also led to a decline in political trust – in June 2024, the British Social Attitudes Survey revealed that 79% of the public were dissatisfied with the way that the UK was governed, with Partygate cited amongst the causes.\nOn 4 July 2024, the first general election since the Partygate story broke was held. The Labour Party, led by Starmer, won a total of 411 seats, giving them a landslide majority of 174 in the House of Commons. The Conservatives, led by Sunak, won 121 seats on a vote share of 23.7%, the party's worst result at a general election in its history. In a report surveying opinion after the election, the research agency More in Common and University College London found that 49% of the public felt that the Partygate scandal was one of the Conservatives' biggest mistakes since 2019, second only to 54% naming mismanagement of the National Health Service.\n}}\nExternal links\nSimilar timelines\n*[https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/23828909.partygate-timeline-events-including-investigations/ \"UK 'partygate': A timeline of Boris Johnson's lockdown scandals\"] at The Argus\n*[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-59952395 \"Partygate: A timeline of the lockdown parties\"] at BBC News\n*[https://www.bigissue.com/news/politics/number-10-christmas-downing-street-party-explained/ \"The Downing Street Christmas party explained: A timeline of the scandal\"] at The Big Issue\n*[https://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/23828909.partygate-timeline-events-including-investigations/ \"Partygate timeline of events, including investigations\"] at the Enfield Independent\n*[https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/partygate-timeline-downing-street-parties-boris-johnson-lockdown-sue-gray-b970616.html \"Partygate – full timeline of the Downing Street scandal\"] at the Evening Standard\n*[https://www.ft.com/content/42238323-5303-4037-b9b1-8ebeaf95b7f7 \"Timeline of UK government social gatherings held during Covid\"] at the Financial Times\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2022/jan/14/how-no-10s-alleged-parties-took-place-as-uk-covid-death-toll-rose-interactive \"How No 10's alleged parties took place as UK Covid death toll rose\"] at The Guardian\n*[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-partygate-timeline-inquiry-b2353754.html \"Timeline of lockdown gatherings as Boris Johnson faces new claim he broke Covid rules\"] at The Independent\n*[https://theweek.com/news/politics/955416/timeline-downing-street-lockdown-party-scandal#section-15-december-2021 \"A timeline of the Partygate scandal\"] at The Week"
