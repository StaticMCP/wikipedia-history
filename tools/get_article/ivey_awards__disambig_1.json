Established in 2004, the non-nomination based awards served to recognize outstanding achievements within the past theater season in direction, performance, design, etc. The awards were founded by Scott Mayer and administered by a panel of local theater professionals and theater patrons. The Iveys ceased in 2018 due to lack of funding.\nThe Iveys were held each year in September at the historic State Theater, in the theater district of Minneapolis.\nAbout the Award Ceremony\nThe IVEY awards were created in 2004  in an effort to acknowledge the ever-growing Twin Cities theater community, while providing theater professionals and theater-goers an \"annual celebration and recognition ceremony,\" honoring the previous year's theater season and theatrical accomplishments. The evening of entertainment and awards consists of performances from the past year of theater (ranging from musical theater, dance, scenes), award presentation, and lifetime achievement recognition. Typically, the award presenters, entertainment and hosts are local theater professionals and celebrities. However, the occasional nationally known celebrity, having recent local theatrical experience, has hosted the event and/or presented an award.\nDetails of the IVEY Awards\nBecause of the celebratory nature of the IVEY awards, there is not a pre-determined number of awards nor pre-existing categories. Furthermore, the awards are not meant to be a competition, thus there are no nominees.\nHowever, there are three general categories included in the recognition ceremony:\n* Awards for lifetimes achievement and an emerging artist(determined by representatives of all theater organizations participating in the project)\n* Awards for theater highlights (determined by a group of over 100 volunteer evaluators and the theater-going public)\n* Recognition for work in the areas of production, design, direction, performance, and special citations (determined by the group of volunteer evaluators and theater-going public)\nEligibility\nNote: all information taken from IVEY Theater Eligibility Requirements\nOrganizations that elect to participate in the project and be considered for Ivey Awards recognition must represent themselves as a professional theater organization.\nProfessional theater organizations that wish to participate or be considered for an award must:\n* Be registered in the State of Minnesota as a 501(c)(3) organization or a for-profit business.\n* Have been producing work and in existence for at least one year.\n* Compensate their artists and staff on a regular basis.\n* Be based in and produce in the Twin Cities’ seven county metropolitan area.\n* Provide between six and ten complimentary tickets for each production to be evaluated that are valid for performance dates selected by the assigned evaluators.\nAll work eligible for an award must:\n* Be produced by an eligible theater organization.\n* Be scripted.\n* Have a run of at least ten days or over two weekends.\nThe awards will not cover touring theater or college and university theater.\nRecognition Evaluation Process\nThe process of evaluation was developed to include many theater perspectives. The opinions of a group of 100 evaluators, who represent many aspects of the theater audience (theater professionals [actors, directors, designers], general theater-goers, donors, etc.), attend performances and evaluate certain aspects of each performance. These opinions are collected and further evaluated by the IVEY Award panel, and awards are then decided upon.\nFurthermore, all opinions from any audience member can contribute to the evaluation process by submittal to the IVEY Award panel, via the official website.\nAwards and recipients\n|Nathan Christopher\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2006\n|Christiana Clark\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2007\n|Kate Sutton-Johnson\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2008\n|Matthew Amendt\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2009\n|Emily Gonyou Halaas\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2010\n|Kalere Payton\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2011\n|Anna Sundberg\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2012\n|Isabel Nelson\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2013\n|Ricardo Vázquez\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2014\n|Tyler Michaels\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2015\n|Mikell Sapp\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2016\n|Trevor Bowen\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2017\n|Meghan Kreidler\n|}\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Ivey Lifetime Achievement Award\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" |Recipient\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2005\n|Lou Bellamy\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2006\n|Jack Reuler\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2007\n|Sheila Livingston\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2008\n|Don Stolz\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2009\n|Dudley Riggs\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2010\n|Wendy Lehr\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2011\n|Bain Boehlke\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2012\n|Rick Shiomi\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2013\n|Jeffrey Hatcher\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|2014\n|Michael Robins\n|-\n|Bonnie Morris\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2015\n|Joe Dowling\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2016\n|Graydon Royce\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"|2017\n|Michelle Hensley\n|}\n-->\n2005\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2005 Ivey Awards (September 26, 2005)\n|Honor\n|Recipients\n|Producing theater, if applicable\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" |Productions\n| The Miser\n|Theatre de la Jeune Lune\n|-\n| Death of a Salesman\n| Guthrie Theater\n|-\n|La Bohème\n|Theater Latté Da\n|-\n|A Year with Frog and Toad\n|Children's Theatre Company\n|-\n|PSST!\n|Off-Leash Area\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" |Artists\n| colspan=\"2\" |Joe Chvala\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Marcus Dilliard\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Steve Hendrickson\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Helen Huang\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Kimberly Joy Morgan\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Stacia Rice\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\"|Emerging Artist Award\n| colspan=\"2\"|Nathan Christopher\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\"|Lifetime Achievement Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Lou Bellamy\n|}\n2006\nProductions\n* Sez She, emotional impact—Illusion Theater\n* The Talk: An Intercourse of Coming of Age, unique concept -- Youth Performance Company\n* I Am Anne Frank, direction (Ben Krywoscz) and musical direction (Mindy Eschedor) -- Nautilus Music Theater\nIndividuals\n* Gerry Giouard, choreography -- Crimes and Whispers, Off Leash Area\n* Barry Kornhauser, playwriting -- Reeling, Children's Theatre Company\n* Jim Lichtsheidl, creation -- Knock, Theatre Latte Da\n* Joel Sass, set design -- Last of the Boys, Jungle Theater\nActor Honorees\n* Bradley Greenwald -- I Am My Own Wife, Jungle Theater\n* Dean Holt -- Reeling, Children's Theatre Company\nEmerging Artist Award\nChristiana Clark, performer\nLifetime Achievement Award\nJack Reuler, Artistic Director\n2007\nProductions\n* Don Giovanni, musical direction and performances—Theatre de la Jeune Lune\n* Love, Janis, musical direction and performances -- Ordway Center for the Performing Arts\n* Messy Utopia, innovative concept and idea -- Mixed Blood Theatre\nIndividual Honorees\n* John Arnone, scenic design -- Private Lives, Guthrie Theater\n* Michael Matthew Ferrell, choreography—Disney's High School Musical, Children's Theatre Company\n* Mike Hallenbeck, sound design -- Kid-Simple and Hunger, Emigrant Theater\nActor Honorees\n* Thomas W.
