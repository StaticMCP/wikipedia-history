Incumbent president Ilham Aliyev, who has held office since 2003, won a fifth consecutive term with over 92% of the vote, defeating his closest runner-up Zahid Oruj, who obtained just 2% of the vote.\nOriginally planned for October 2025, President Aliyev called for a snap election in December 2023 following the victorious Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh. This offensive led to the end of the Republic of Artsakh, which was an Armenian-led breakaway state, and Azerbaijan gaining full control over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. The election is informally known as the \"Victory Election\" () due to the successful military operation. It marks the third snap election in Azerbaijan's history and the first to be held in winter season.\nThe election took place in an authoritarian context where the opposition and independent media were noted to be repressed. The two main opposition parties, Musavat and Popular Front, announced that they would not field candidates for the election and urged voters to stay home, citing the undemocratic nature of the election. Furthermore, several candidates featured on the ballot had previously expressed public admiration for Aliyev, resulting in the absence of opposition contenders amidst the crackdown on independent media and journalists.\nIn addition to the aftermath of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and its future implications, the election campaign unfolded against a backdrop of broader geopolitical tensions in the region. This included competition between regional powers and efforts to assert Azerbaijan's influence in the South Caucasus. Domestic issues such as economic stagnation, rising social inequalities, and concerns about democratic governance were also prominent themes in the election discourse. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe highlighted concerns such as \"secrecy of the vote, absence of measures against multiple voting, and signs of ballot stuffing,\" prompting doubts about the integrity of the ballot counting and reporting process. Observers noted that although election preparations were executed efficiently and competently, genuine pluralism was lacking, with critical viewpoints consistently suppressed.\nBackground\nThe previous 2018 presidential election was held months ahead of schedule which saw the re-election of long-time authoritarian president Ilham Aliyev, in power since 2003, securing a fourth consecutive term in office after obtaining 86% of the vote. The election was boycotted by the Azerbaijani opposition and criticized for its conduct and early schedule amid allegations of irregularities and electoral fraud.\nPresident Aliyev's fourth presidential term was initially embarked by a series of socioeconomic reforms, where he issued decrees addressing burdensome credit loans, providing compensation to the families of military veterans, and increasing student stipends, as well as issuing mass pardons to several political prisoners. He also made an effort attempt at diversifying the oil-dependent Azerbaijani economy. In late 2019, the National Assembly dissolved itself, which triggered the February 2020 parliamentary election, with the move being viewed as Aliyev's possible preparation for an order of succession, where he would eventually hand over presidency to his wife, First Vice President Mehriban Aliyeva, as a way to ensure the Aliyev family's dynastic rule over Azerbaijan. The parliamentary election campaign, initially offering a glimmer of political change, nevertheless saw Aliyev's ruling New Azerbaijan Party retaining a majority of deputy seats. From 2020, Aliyev endured the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in Azerbaijan, where a series of controversial anti-lockdown laws were introduced that allowed for the Azerbaijani government to crackdown on political opposition and silence anti-government critics over the country's response to the pandemic, which Aliyev referred to as a \"fifth column\" attempting to \"destroy Azerbaijan\". The Azerbaijani government also introduced a series of anti-crisis packages that were aimed at relieving the economic impact caused by the coronavirus pandemic, to which the emergency aid was later criticized for allegedly having citizens struggling to obtain it.\nNagorno-Karabakh and the 2023 Azerbaijani offensive\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh region has served as an epicenter of the decades-long conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Since 1994 much of Nagorno-Karabakh, internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, was de-facto under control by the ethnic Armenian-led breakaway state Republic of Artsakh, with periods of occurring border skirmishes occurring in the 2010s. In July 2020, border clashes took place between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces, sparking massive pro-war protests in Azerbaijan which became increasingly grew following the deaths of military officers Polad Hashimov and Ilgar Mirzayev. The demonstrations in Baku, leading to the storming of the Parliament building and clashes with the security forces, had profound impact on Azerbaijan's foreign policy as its believed to have been one of the causing factors that led to the following outbreak of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in September 2020. The war lasted for approximately 44 days and resulted in an Azerbaijani victory, reclaiming control of the newly-captured territories and Armenian-occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh in the aftermath of November 2020 ceasefire agreement signed by Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia.\nPost-war stability within the Nagorno-Karabakh region was relatively short-lived, as the Armenia–Azerbaijan border crisis began in 2021. From December 2022, Azerbaijan enforced a blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh, sparking a humanitarian crisis in Artsakh as the region grappled with the shortages of medication, food and fuel. In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military offensive into Nagorno-Karabakh which lasted for a day, leading to the immediate surrender of the remaining Artsakhi forces, which effectively ended the existence of the Republic of Artsakh and resulted in the mass exodus of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians.\nCalling for snap election\nArticle 178 of the Election Code of Azerbaijan stipulates that the presidential election must be held every third Wednesday of October of the last year of the President’s term of office. The 2016 constitutional referendum previously extended the presidential term from five to seven years, with Aliyev being subsequently re-elected for a seven-year term in 2018 following the amendments to the Constitution of Azerbaijan, thus making the presidential election originally set to take place on 15 October 2025.\nArticle 101 §1 of the Constitution of Azerbaijan allows for the President to legally call a snap election. In accordance with Article 179 §2 of the Election Code of Azerbaijan, the date of the presidential elections shall be determined within a week of the call by the Central Election Commission (CEC). The election must be on a Wednesday and be conducted within a 3 month period after the date determination by the CEC. On 7 December 2023, President Ilham Aliyev signed a decree in setting Wednesday, 7 February 2024, as a date for an early presidential election to be held. In addition, the election day in Azerbaijan would be a public holiday.\nGiven without the official explanation for Aliyev's decision, it was speculated by Mehmood Ul Hassan Khan during an interview with Azernews that the original election date for autumn 2025 would have coincided with the already scheduled parliamentary elections for that same timeframe, which might could have potentially caused \"a bit of distress\" among Azerbaijani voters and that a snap election for president in February 2024 would look \"more convenient from a time perspective.\" Other analysts suggested the reasoning factor behind an early presidential election was due to Aliyev's attempt to take advantage of his high popularity following Azerbaijani's successful seizure of Nagorno-Karabakh. The timing of election was also noted by Associated Press to have coincided ahead of the 2024 Russian presidential election, for which the alleged reason was due to attempts by Aliyev to minimize Russia's influence on the Azerbaijani election. Opposition leader Ali Karimli assessed that a snap presidential election indicated Aliyev's desire to hold polls \"in isolation from the democratic world\" and fear of a change in the current \"minimal political competition\", where he speculated that Aliyev wanted to secure another seven-year presidential term before a potential Russian defeat in the Russo-Ukrainian War which could according to his theory \"upend the regional geopolitical situation to authoritarians' disfavor.\" Musavat party chairman Arif Hajili criticized the announcement of a snap presidential election, stating that holding an early vote hinders political competition and that it is problematic for the election campaign. In a following subsequent statement, the Musavat party claimed that the election date in winter will lead to a low voter turnout, accusing Azerbaijani authorities of turning the presidential election into \"a formal procedure\".\nElectoral system\nThe President of Azerbaijan is elected for a seven-year term from universal, direct and equal suffrage with a personal and secret ballot. Using the two-round system; if no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the first round, a run-off vote is held between the top two candidates who garnered the most votes in the first round. Under a case of the war, the presidential term must be extended until the end of military operation, for which the decision on this matter must be adopted by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the basis of the application of the state body organizing elections (referendum).\nTimetable\nThe Central Election Commission (CEC) on 9 December 2023 approved the official calendar plan for the 2024 election as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Key Dates\n|-\n!Date\n!Event\n|-\n|9 December 2023\n|Nomination process of candidates begin.\n|-\n|19 December 2023 – 8 January 2024, 18:00 UTC+4\n|Collecting signatures in support of presidential nominees.\n|-\n|15 January–6 February 2024, 08:00 UTC+4\n|Pre-election campaigning.\n|-\n|28 January 2024\n|Deadline for the accreditation of election observers.\n|-\n|2 February 2024\n|Deadline for the submission of applications for election observation in the premises of electoral precinct to the district election commission.\n|-\n|7 February 2024\n|Election day, voting held from 08:00 to 19:00 UTC+4.\n|-\n|Evening, 7 February 2024\n|Publication of the information about the election results in the protocols of precinct and district election commissions.\n|-\n|By 19:00 UTC+4, 8 February 2024\n|Precinct election commissions submit the first copies of the protocols on the results of the elections to the district election commissions.\n|-\n|9 February 2024\n|Deadline for district election commissions requiring to submit the first copies of protocols on the results of voting in the district to the CEC, for which after all protocols received from the districts the CEC must immediately announce the primary generalized election results.\n|-\n|17 February 2024\n|Deadline for the Constitutional Court to verify and approve the election results.\n|}\nCandidates\nA citizen of the Republic of Azerbaijan, who has lived permanently in the territory of the Azerbaijan for more than 10 years, has the right to participate in elections, has not been convicted of a serious crime, has no obligations to other states, has a higher education, and does not have dual citizenship can be elected as President.\nRegistered\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"width:20%;\" |Candidate name and age,political party\n!Political office(s)\n! style=\"width:48%;\" |Details\n!Registration date\n|-\n||Ilham Aliyev()New Azerbaijan Party\n|\n| style=\"background-color:;\" |\n|President of Azerbaijan(2003–present)Chairman of the New Azerbaijan Party(2005–present)Prime Minister of Azerbaijan(2003)\n|The New Azerbaijan Party submitted the documents on the presidential nomination of Ilham Aliyev to the CEC on 17 December 2023.\n|30 December 2023\n|-\n|Fuad Aliyev()Independent\n|\n| style=\"background-color:;\" |\n|Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of Azerbaijan(2001–2023)\n|Previously a candidate in the 2008 presidential election.\n|3 January 2024\n|-\n|Zahid Oruj()Independent\n|\n| style=\"background-color:;\" |\n|Member of the National Assembly(2003–present)\n|A pro-Aliyev member of parliament.
