Multiple regions of the mech could be switched, including the arms, legs and handheld weaponry. Such parts were gained (or lost) by inflicting damage upon enemies, which would cause various parts to disembark and be wielded by the player. Additionally, by using commands, the players could use an option called a \"Team-up Change\" which initiated a powerful attack used in tandem, and could also further vary the customization of weapons by using a main and sub-weapon.\nGameplay follows a mission-like structure, with seven in total. Each stage consists of the game giving the player prerequisites such as a time-limit to eliminate enemies, a set amount of ammunition for weapons, and destroying a varying number of enemies. Each stage ended with a boss character, and the game provided a competent replay value with the customization options.\nPlot\nIn the year 2281, the United Earth Government and the Principalities of Raia signed a ceasefire treaty, ending a war that lasted for half a century.
