Following the splitting away of twenty of its former districts in 2013, it now covers an area of 2,763.02&nbsp;km2 and had a population of 192,663 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2024 was 204,106 (comprising 105,435 males and 98,671 females). The administrative centre (regency seat) is presently at the town of Manokwari, which is also the capital of the province.\nUnder proposals approved by the Indonesian Parliament in 2013, the town of Manokwari - comprising the districts (kecamatan) of West Manokwari and East Manokwari - was intended to be split off from the regency to form a separate independent city, but the proposal has subsequently remained under consideration with a decision deferred by the Indonesian Government (which has held a moratorium on the formation of new regencies and cities).\nAdministration\nAt the 2010 Census, Manokwari Regency comprised 29 districts (kecamatan) with an area of 34,970&nbsp;km2 and a 2010 Census population of 187,726, but in 2013 two new regencies  - South Manokwari Regency (Manokwari Selatan) with six districts, and Arfak Mountains Regency (Pegunungan Arfak) with ten districts - were created from parts of the Manokwari Regency, while the most westerly four districts (Kebar, Amberbaken, Mubrani and Senopi, which were the largest in area of the remaining districts, although sparsely populated) were removed from Manokwari Regency and added to the Tambrauw Regency.\nThe residual area of Manokwari Regency thus comprised nine districts, listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2024. The table also includes the location of the district centres, the number of administrative villages in each district (totaling 164 rural kampung and 9 urban kelurahan), and its postal code.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
