In the two-member constituencies, plurality block voting was used -- electors could cast two valid votes but were allowed to \"plump\".\nKey dates\nThis was the first Queensland general election to be conducted on a single day. In the past, due to problems of distance and communications, it was not possible to hold the elections on a single day.\nResults\n| house = Legislative Assembly\n| series = Queensland state election\n| back = 1899\n| forward = 1904\n| enrolled = 108,548\n| total_votes = 100,644\n| turnout % = 78.88%\n| turnout chg =\n| informal = 803\n| informal % =\n| informal chg =\n}}\n|}\nSee also\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1902–1904\nReferences"
