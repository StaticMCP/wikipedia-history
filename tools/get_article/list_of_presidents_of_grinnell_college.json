      "text": "# List of presidents of Grinnell College\n\nThe following is a list of presidents of Grinnell College, a private liberal arts college in Grinnell, Iowa, United States.\nSince the college's founding in 1846, Grinnell College has had thirteen presidents and seven temporary acting presidents. A college president is responsible for all aspects of the institution's internal and external affairs, including administrative and academic decision-making.\nWhile Iowa College, later renamed Grinnell College, did not have a president for the first years of its existence, after the Civil War, the trustees chose fellow trustee George Frederic Magoun to lead the institution as it matured. From his inauguration in 1865, Magoun served 19 years, the second-longest presidential tenure in the college's history.\nThe current Grinnell College president is Anne F. Harris, who replaced president Raynard S. Kington to become the 14th president of the College on July 14, 2020.\nPresidents of the College\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of presidents of Grinnell College\n!No.\n! Name\n! Picture!! Years !!
