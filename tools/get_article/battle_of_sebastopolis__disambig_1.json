The battle ended the peace that had existed between the two powers since 680.\nJustinian II sought to restore the glory of the Roman Empire under Justinian I by pursuing aggressive military campaigns that reversed his father's peaceful policies. Early on, he broke a treaty with the Bulgarians and attacked Slavic tribes near Thessaloniki, many of which were transferred to the depopulated Opsician Theme, granting them land and recruiting them to form a new elite military corps. Justinian II also undermined a treaty with the Umayyad caliphate under Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan over tribute payments, breaking the treaty. His Slavic military corps fought the Umayyads at Sebastopolis but deserted en masse, resulting in a Byzantine defeat. Following this, Justinian II harshly punished the surviving troops and their families.\nBackground\nEarly in his reign, Justinian II had the ambition to restore the lands of the former Roman Empire, as Emperor Justinian I did. To accomplish this goal, he aggressively sought combat by undoing measures that brought the peace and prosperity established by his father. Early on, he broke a peace with the Bulgarians and immediately attacked slavic tribes that had established near Thessaloniki. In 688/9, Justinian II forcibly transplanted Slavic populations from the Balkans and settled them in the Opsician Theme, which was depopulated from Arab attacks under Justinian's father reign. He granted them military land grants, and from them, he recruited a special military corps, allegedly 30,000 strong, which was called in \"the chosen people\" (). In about 690, Neboulos was placed as the corps' commander ().\nJustinian II was bound by a treaty with the caliphate that granted him tribute in gold coins. However, he devised a way to undermine it. He introduced new coins featuring his portrait on one side and that of Christ on the other. Abd al-Malik made similar coins but omitted Christ's image, making them slightly lighter. Justinian then refused the tribute, claiming that the coins were not equivalent. When Abd al-Malik offered to increase the amount to meet the agreed value, Justinian II declared the treaty broken and began preparations for war.\nBattle\nIn 692/3, after the corps' training had been completed, they were employed en masse by Justinian II in a major campaign against the Umayyads under the  of the Anatolics, Leontios.\nThe long preparation by Justinian II, gave sufficient time for the caliphate to raise their own army and invaded Byzantium before Justinian's army invaded the caliphate's territories. The Byzantines engaged the Arabs near Sebastopolis, in the middle of Armeniac Theme, and initially had the upper hand. The Umayyads, incensed at the breaking of the treaty, used copies of its texts in the place of a flag. However, Neboulos, with the bulk (some 20,000) of his men, deserted the Byzantine lines and went over to the Arabs, allegedly bribed by the Arab commander, Muhammad ibn Marwan. The actions of Neboulos ensured the defeat of the Byzantines.\nAftermath\nJustinian II's defeat deprived him of a viable army to continue his military campaigns, and the rupture of the treaty with the caliphate enabled the Arabs to launch new raids against Byzantine territories.\nSources report how thereafter Justinian II blamed Leontios for the defeat and imprisoned him. He took his revenge on the remaining Slavs. He disbanded the corps, and killed or sold into slavery many of its men, as well as killed the families of the deserters at Leukete near the gulf of Nicomedia. Much of this extermination took place 694/5; some scholars dispute this account. Neboulos and his men, on the other hand, were settled by the Umayyads in Syria, and were employed in subsequent Arab forays into Byzantine-held Asia Minor. Douglas Whalin contends that the story of Neboulos illustrates the challenges the Byzantine Empire faced in depending on foederati (foreign tribe allies bounded by a treaty) when they were not sufficiently Romanized.\nSee also\n*\nNotes\n}}\nFootnotes\nSources\nPrimary\n*  820 | url =  | ref =  }}\nSecondary\n*\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
