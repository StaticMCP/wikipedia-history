Many of these games have started to disappear due to urbanisation, the advent of computer games, and the neglect of cultural institutions.\nHistory\nSome of the traditional Iranian games were demonstrated at the 1974 Asian Games hosted by Iran as a way of demonstrating the ability for traditional Persian culture to coexist with modern Western culture.\nTraditional games\nZu (Compares with Kabaddi, of Indian origin)\nZu/Zou is similar to the better-known version of the game Kabaddi of India, and has a history going back thousands of years in the country. In this version, the attacker starts with hawling \"zou\" (see above reference) the entire time performing the mission without breathing until gets back to the base. Another contrast is there is no 30 second rule in Zu.\nHaft sang\nChoub bazi\nMartial arts\nPahlavani\nBoard games\nShatranj\nNard\nCard games\nBaas-o-Beyt\nPasur\nShelem\nGanjifa\nAs-Nas\nAnimal events\nChovgan\nSee also\n* Traditional games of South Asia\nNotes\nReferences"
