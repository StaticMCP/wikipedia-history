The band's lineup—consisting of lead vocalist Till Lindemann, lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, and keyboardist Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz—has remained unchanged throughout their history. They were one of the first bands to emerge within the Neue Deutsche Härte genre, with their debut album leading the music press to coin the term, and their style of music has generally had a positive reception from music critics. Commercially, the band have been very successful, earning many No. 1 albums as well as gold and platinum certifications in countries around the world. Their grand live performances, which often feature pyrotechnics, have played a part in their popularity growth. Despite success, the band have been subject to some controversies, with their overall image and certain songs in specific having been subject to criticism. Rammstein have won several awards and honors and been nominated for two Grammy Awards.\nGrammy Awards\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 1999\n| \"Du hast\"\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Best Metal Performance\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2006\n| \"Mein Teil\"\n|\n|-\n|}\nBerlin Music Video Awards\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 2022\n| Zeit\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Best Concept\n|\n|-\n|}\nEcho Awards\n* Best video of the year for \"Engel\" in 1998.\n* Best German artist exporting best abroad in 1999.\n* Best German Artist 2002.\n* Best Rock / Alternative / Metal Artist in 2005.\n* Best German Live Artist 2005.\n* Best Rock / Alternative / Metal Artist in 2006.\n* Best German Rock / Alternative / Metal Artist in 2010.\n* Best German video for the music video \"Ich tu dir weh\" in 2011.\n* Best German artist exporting best abroad in 2012.\n* Best Rock / Alternative Artist in 2012.\nKerrang!
