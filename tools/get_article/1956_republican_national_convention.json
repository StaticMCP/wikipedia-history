U.S. Senator William F. Knowland was temporary chairman and former speaker of the House Joseph W. Martin Jr. served as permanent chairman. It renominated President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Vice President Richard M. Nixon as the party's candidates for the 1956 presidential election.\nOn August 23, 1956, singer Nat King Cole spoke at the Republican Convention.\nConvention scheduling\n(the first Republican to be elected president) and featuring a commemoration of the centennial of the party's first presidential convention in (held in 1856)]]\n(the main venue of the convention)]]\nThe 1956 Republican convention was held after that year's Democratic National Convention. This was unusual, as since 1864, in every election but 1888, Democrats had held their convention second. It has become an informal tradition that the party holding the White House (which, accordingly, in 1956 had been the Republican Party) hosts their convention second, but it is unclear when this tradition began (Democrats had held the White House and held their conventions second between 1936 and 1952, but it is unclear whether they scheduled their conventions second in these years because of their White House incumbency, or whether they scheduled them second because it was traditional that Democratic National Conventions had been held after the Republican National Convention).\nPresidential nomination\nPresidential candidates\nFile:Eisenhower official cropped.png|PresidentDwight D.

By the time of the convention, a unanimous renomination for Nixon was expected until one renegade delegate, former Democratic Congressman and perennial candidate Terry Carpenter, decided to place in nomination for Vice President a man named Joe Smith, from Carpenter's own Terrytown, Nebraska. When asked who Joe Smith was at the 1956 convention, Carpenter mysteriously replied, \"Oh, he is a symbol of an open convention, in that sense of the word.\" It was eventually revealed that there was no such man, and that his nomination was a protest against the perceived political theater of the closed 1956 Republican National Convention. Carpenter ultimately did cast his one dissenting vote for Vice President for Joe Smith.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Vice Presidential Balloting\n|-\n!Candidate||1st\n|-\n!Nixon\n|style=\"background:#fbb;\"|1,322\n|-\n!Smith\n|style=\"background:#fdd;\"|1\n|}\nVice Presidential Balloting / 3rd Day of Convention (August 22, 1956)\nFile:1956RepublicanVicePresidentialNomination1stBallot.png|1stVice Presidential Ballot\nSee also\n* History of the United States Republican Party\n* List of Republican National Conventions\n* 1956 Democratic National Convention\n* 1956 United States presidential election\n* United States presidential nominating convention\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25838 Republican Party platform of 1956] at The American Presidency Project\n* [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=10583 Eisenhower nomination acceptance speech for President at RNC] (transcript) at The American Presidency Project\n*[http://politicalgraveyard.com/parties/R/1956/index.html http://politicalgraveyard.com]\n*[https://archive.org/details/1956-08-20_Republican_Convention Universal newsreel footage of the convention]\n*[https://archive.org/details/1956-08-23_Its_Ike_and_Nixon Universal newsreel footage of the convention]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekt8YKTpbqY Video of Nixon nomination acceptance speech for Vice President and Eisenhower nomination acceptance speech for President at RNC from C-SPAN (via YouTube)]\n*[http://convert2mp3.net/en/index.php?p=tags&id=youtube_LPCTsfYahfg&key=nolVY67yPSbg Audio of Eisenhower nomination acceptance speech for President at RNC]"
