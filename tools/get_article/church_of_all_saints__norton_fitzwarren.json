It is located in the deanery of Taunton, within the diocese of Bath and Wells. It is a Grade II* listed building.\nUsage\nThe church is part of the Church of England, and forms a United Benefice with the Church of St John, Staplegrove. The two churches share the same rector, The Reverend Paul Irving, and are within the deanery of Taunton, within the diocese of Bath and Wells.\nHistory and architecture\nThe church originally dates from around the late 13th or early 14th century, but underwent two periods of restoration in the mid 19th century, during which the porch and chancel were rebuilt, and a vestry was added. The church is built of North Curry sandstone, with hamstone dressing and a slate roof. It has a western crenellated tower which has set-back buttresses. At each of the three stages of the tower, it has gargoyles on the corner edges. A clock, and empty niche for a statue are featured on the southern face of the tower. The tower includes 19th century stained glass. The arcade is of octagonal piers topped with plain capitals. The church was classified as a Grade II* listed building in February 1955.\nThe church features an early 16th-century 3/5 bay rood screen, of the Devon style, which originally spanned across the entire nave and aisle, but is now split. The lower section of the screen depicts the story of the Dragon of Norton Camp. The south west corner of the graveyard is believed to have been a burial site for gypsies.\nSee also\n* List of ecclesiastical parishes in the Diocese of Bath and Wells\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002907/http://www.stjohnswithallsaints.btck.co.uk/ Official website]"
