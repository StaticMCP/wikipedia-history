      "text": "# 1880 New South Wales colonial election\n\nThe 1880 New South Wales colonial election was held between 17 November and 2 December 1880. This election was for all of the 108 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in 43 single-member constituencies, 25 2-member constituencies, one 3-member constituency and three 4-member constituencies, all with a first past the post system. Suffrage was limited to adult white males. The previous parliament of New South Wales was dissolved on 9 November 1880 by the Governor, Lord Augustus Loftus, on the advice of the Premier, Sir Henry Parkes.\nThere was no recognisable party structure at this election; instead the government was determined by a loose, shifting factional system.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
