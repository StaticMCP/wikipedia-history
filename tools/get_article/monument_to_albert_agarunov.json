The project to create the monument was approved by the Ministry of Culture of Azerbaijan in April 2019. Teachers of the State Academy of Arts of Azerbaijan - Rahib Garayev and Zamik Rzayev worked on the creation of the monument.\nThe monument to Albert Agarunov was unveiled on November 15, 2019, in the Narimanov district of Baku.\nRepresentatives of the Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan, Deputy defense Minister Kerim Veliyev, Chairman of the Mountain Jews Community in Azerbaijan Milikh Evdaev, head of the US Commission on international religious freedom Johnny Moore, several rabbis from Latin America, Europe and the United States, senators from Western states of America, etc. took part in the event dedicated to the opening of the monument.\nEvery year, on Agarunov's birthday, April 25, there are various events held to commemorate him.\nComposition\nThe process of creating the monument lasted six months. At first, the model of the sculpture was made of clay, then of plaster, and bronze. The rock part was made of concrete.\nThe monument itself is a sculpture of Albert Agarunov on a tank.\nThe monument to Albert Agarunov is the second monument dedicated to the Azerbaijani tank man, after the monument to the Hero of the Soviet Union, General of tank forces Hazi Aslanov.\nGallery\nAlbert Aqarunovun heykəli (1).jpg\nAlbert Aqarunovun heykəli (2).jpg\nAlbert Aqarunovun heykəli (4).jpg\nAlbert Aqarunovun heykəli (5).jpg\nSee also\n* Albert Agarunov\n* History of the Jews in Azerbaijan\nReferences"
