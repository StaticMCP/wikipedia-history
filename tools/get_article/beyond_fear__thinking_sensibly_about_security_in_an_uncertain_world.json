      "text": "# Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World\n\nBeyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World is a non-fiction book by Bruce Schneier, published in 2003. The book grew out of an Atlantic Monthly article by Charles Mann. Beyond Fear presents a five-step process for evaluating the value of a countermeasure against security attacks. The book is divided into three parts. Part one of Beyond Fear introduces the idea that all security involves \"trade-offs\". Part two: \"How Security Works\", explains key principles in security such as Attackers, Defenders, Identification, Authentication, and Authorization. Part three: \"The Game of Security\" ties all the issues together and offers suggestions on how to form a coherent security policy.\nExternal links\n* Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.\n\n---\n\n## Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly about Security in an Uncertain World\n\n#REDIRECT Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World"
