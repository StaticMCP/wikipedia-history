He served as first Borough President of Brooklyn, and later as New York City Comptroller.\nLife\nGrout was born on October 27, 1861, in New York City, the son of Edward Grout and Fanny Marshall. His paternal grandfather was assemblyman Paul Grout, and he was a descendant of Jonathan Grout.\nGrout studied at Colgate University, graduating from there in 1884. After he graduated, he studied law in the office of Stewart L. Woodford. He was admitted to the bar in 1885 and stayed in Woodford's firm for the next seven years. He then formed a partnership with future New York City mayor William Jay Gaynor under the name Gaynor, Grout & De Fere. When Gaynor became a judge a year later, the firm became Grout, De Fere & Mayer. Almet Francis Jenks later joined the firm.\nGrout served as a private in the 23rd Regiment of the New York National Guard from 1887 to 1892. In 1894, he was appointed judge advocate, with the rank of major, of the Second Brigade.\nIn 1895, Grout was the Democratic candidate for Mayor of Brooklyn, but he lost to Charles A. Schieren. A prominent advocate for the City of Greater New York, he was elected the first Borough President of Brooklyn, serving from 1897 to 1901. He was elected New York City Comptroller in 1901, serving until 1905. He was a delegate to the 1904 Democratic National Convention.\nGrout was president of the Brooklyn bank. When the bank closed in 1911, he was indicted on the charge he swore to a false report on the bank's financial condition. Three and a half years later, he was found guilty after a nine-week trial and sentenced to a year in prison. He was released on bail and the Appellate Division ordered a new trial. The indictment was then dismissed by the district attorney. He then returned to law, practicing law with his brother Paul on 115 Broadway. In 1924, he moved to Greens Farms, Connecticut, and was admitted to the Connecticut state bar.\nIn 1899, Grout married Ida L. Loeschigk. They had two children, Jonathan (judge of the Fairfield town court) and Catherine. He was a member of the Montauk Club and the New York County Lawyers Association. He was a trustee of Colgate University since 1895.\nGrout died at his home in Greens Farms on November 9, 1931. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/grossi-grout.html#817.84.29 The Political Graveyard]\n*"
