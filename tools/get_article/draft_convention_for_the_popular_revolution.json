It is based in the eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mainly operating in the Ituri province, which borders Uganda.\nThe CPR was officially founded on 31 March 2025, when its leader and convicted war criminal Thomas Lubanga announced its creation. The Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC) began counterinsurgency operations against the group in mid-April 2025.\nBackground\nIn the aftermath of the First Congo War, during which numerous rebel groups sought to overthrow the Mobutu regime, rebel leader Laurent-Désiré Kabila was installed as the new President of the DRC on 17 May 1997. Lasting instability, however, set the stage for the further instability which erupted in late 1998 as the Second Congo War.\nLasting eastern conflicts\nAlthough the Second Congo War formally resolved in 2003, the eastern regions of the DRC have continued to be plagued by instability. This includes the activities by armed groups like the Mai-Mai and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). However, conflict largely broke back out between 2012 and 2013 in the form of the March 23 rebellion, during which political mutineers formed the March 23 Movement (M23), whose armed rebel troops rehashed disputes from the Second Congo War. Though the rebellion ultimately failed, it launched the eastern region into further instability which later sparked M23 hostilities to resume in 2022.\nHistory\nThomas Lubanga\nEarly life and rebel affiliations\nThomas Lubanga was born to parents Mathias Njabu and Rosalie Nyango on 29 December 1960 in the town of Djiba, located in the Ituri province of the DRC. He is of the Bantu Hema-Gegere ethnic group, who have been caught in the crossfire of the colonially-fueled Ituri conflict. In his early life, Lubanga graduated from the University of Kisangani with an undergraduate degree in psychology. In the 1990s, Lubanga became an active member of Etienne Tshisekedi’s Union for Democracy and Social Progress party. He was reportedly a trader in Bunia's main market before politician John Tibasima asked him to join the city's delegation while Adèle Lotsove was still its governor.\nSecond Congo War and Rally for Congolese Democracy\nThe Rwanda-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) political party and then rebel group, with the help of both Rwandan and Ugandan troops, helped keep Ituri fairly peaceful during the first couple years of the Second Congo War. However, Uganda, which occupied eastern regions of the DRC at the time, exploited ethnic tensions between the Hema and Lendu ethnic groups for monetary gain, particularly through arms sales. In May 1999, the RCD's primary supporter since its inception, former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, died. With little backing remaining, then president and founder of the RCD, Wamba dia Wamba, established a separate faction of the group, called the RCD-Kisangani/Movement for Liberation (RCD-K/ML) in the city of Kisangani, the capital of the Orientale Province over political and leadership disputes. The Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) indicated a preference for the Hemathe primarily reasons being that they sold the largest number of arms to them and appointed Hema politican Lotsove as the governor of the Kibali-Ituri province in June 1999, which Ugandan Commander of Operations in the Congo, Brigadier James Kazin, created in the combination of the Ituri and Haut-Uélé districts. This, combined with long-standing land disputes, prompted many Hema and Lendu militias to formeach launching offensive and defensive campaigns against one another. This plunged the region in combat soon after, with heavy fighting persisting through the entire second half of 1999 onwards.\ngroups in the Second Congo War.]]\nBetween 21 and 27 June 1999, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Organization of African Unity (OAU), and the United Nations (UN) met in Lusaka, Zambia to draft a ceasefire agreement aimed at ending the Second Congo War. Foreign and Defense Ministers of countries intending to be party to the agreement met from 29 June to 7 July. What resulted was the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement, signed on 10 July 1999. Its terms included deployment of UN peacekeeping forces for monitoring purposes on agreement compliance and the establishment of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programs for armed groups, of which the former was also tasked with monitoring, among other topics. The RCD, as the primary rebel group in the region, requested it should also be able to sign the agreement. But with the group split, there was a dispute over who should sign. Only after months of pressure from Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, and at Nyerere's invitation, did the RCD factions finally meet on 22 July 1999, eventually signing on 31 August 1999. Despite the Agreement being signed by major armed actors, fighting continued in many areas, particularly in mineral- and commodity-rich eastern regions like Ituri. Ethnic tensions which had only deepened over the course of the war further fueled the failure of many aspects of the ceasefire agreement.\nWamba would migrate the group's headquarters to Bunia and establish the Commission for Security and Peace in Djugu territory in October 1999 after the outbreak of fighting in Kisangani two months prior. However, as the landscape in Ituri got murkier, power struggles quickly followed. Wamba, who was a former history professor at the University of Dar es Salaam, struggled to remain at the top of the RCD-K/ML's ranks as more aggressive individuals sought power to capitalize on the growing conflict in late 1999. This internal leadership power struggle, armed skirmishes with the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), and political tensions with Uganda, pushed the group into factionalism. Mbusa Nyamwisi, a then high-ranking commander within the RCD-K/ML, with support of Hema businessman Tibasima Ateenye, looked to oust Wamba, prompting Wamba to more heavily rely on the Lendu. Soon after, Hema commanders within the RCD-K/ML's military wing, the Popular Congolese Army (APC), launched a mutiny based on a perception of Wamba being pro-Lendu, forming the Leopard Mobile Force (CMF). Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni intervened on the ensuing violence by deploying UPDF reinforcements. The Hema community in the region promptly deployed a four-person delegation against the deployment, of which Lubanga was one. It succeeded, and the delegation, accompanied by high-ranking Ugandan officials, helped facilitate the surrender of the CMF.\nCreation of the Union of Congolese Patriots\ncontinue here\nInternational Criminal Court arrest and release\nWas convicted of recruiting child soldiers, an internationally recognized war crime by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2012, but was released and appointment as an peacemaking task force emissary in Ituri by Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi in 2020. In 2022, he was captured by a rebel group for approximately 2 months, after which he sought refuge in Kampala, Uganda.\nFounding of the CPR\nLubanga's exile in Kampala\nIn 2022, he was captured by a rebel group for approximately 2 months, after which he sought refuge in Kampala, Uganda.\nIn 2024, UN experts accused Lubanga of arming elements of local Ituri militias, including some from the March 23 Movement (M23).\nLubanga attempted to run for the Congolese National Assembly in 2023, but was barred from running due to his ICC conviction.\nFormation of the CPR, motives, and criticisms\nLubanga publicly announced the formation of the CPR on 25 March 2025 during a press conference in Kampala, Uganda. He claimed that the CPR would have both a political and military wing. In an interview with The Africa Report, Lubanga said that he \"could not stand by with [his] arms folded\" and, thus, formed the group as \"the current crisis stems first of all from the poor quality of leaders who cannot carry out their core duties.\" During the Kampala conference, Lubanga accused Congolese authorities of \"turning a blind eye\" to massacres at the hands of Cooperative for the Development of Congo (CODECO) and the ADF. Declaring a desire to \"take back the destiny of [the] Ituri province,\" Lubanga also blamed provincial authorities of dehumanizing the local population, corruption, embezzlement, and impunity. He stated the group was willing to wage in \"legal\" armed conflict with intention to overthrow the regional government and take control of Ituri after multiple unfruitful talks with Félix Tshisekedi. Lubanga denied support coming from Ugandan authorities amid claims by the UN.\nLubanga appointed Charles Kakani and Ibrahim Tabani as his assistant deputies, Jokaba Lambi as the provincial deputy, Wedhunga Nyara as the finance officer, Erick Kahigwa as the foreign relations diplomat, David Unyertho as the group's spokesperson, and Doctor Tungulo as the military leaders. The group's military wing was formally titled the Forces for the Popular Revolution (FPR). Lubanga stated that CPR had armed positions in three areas in Ituri at the time of its founding.\nFARDC's spokesperson claimed that CRP was \"in collusion with the M23 to destabilize\" Ituri. Similarly, Yves Kahwa Panga, a former warlord and head of the Bahema Banyawagi chiefdom, called it a \"political scam\" aimed at destabilizing the region. Other sources underscored the threat of the CPR in light of M23 advances and growing ADF activity.\nOperations\nAlthough it is unclear when CPR launched its first attacks, Lubanga confirmed that the group had not launched any military operations prior to its founding. Nevertheless, it engaged in fighting soon after its founding.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal Links"
