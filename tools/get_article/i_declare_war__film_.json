Wilson was frustrated by the process the script was going through until he read through it and was reminded of what it was like to be the characters: \"It was the experience I had growing up, the experience even Lewin had growing up, the experience Jason had growing up. There wasn’t much else to talk about or worry about at that point\".\nRelease\nThe film made its US premiere at ActionFest on April 15, 2012, winning Best Picture.\nIt made its Canadian premiere at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival as its Official Selection on September 6, 2012.

Annlee Ellingson of the Los Angeles Times gave it 3 out of 5 stars, praising it for its charm and ending with \"The performances may be slightly uneven across the cast of a dozen distinct personalities (plus a dog), but overall the effect works because, after all, they're just playacting … right?\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  – Samaritan Entertainment\n*  – Drafthouse Films\n*\n*\n*\n*"
