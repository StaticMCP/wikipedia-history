It is a body of constables attested under section 79 of the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847 (as incorporated by Portland Harbour Revision Order 1997). The Port Police staff the main entrance to the port 24 hours a day, year-round.\nPresent day\nIn February 2018, four new constables were sworn in. In July 2020, the Port Police agreed a memorandum of understanding with the local police force, Dorset Police. This will involve the sharing of assets, improving communication and allowing the collation of information.\nDuties\nThe Port Police guard the main entrance to the port, 24 hours a day, all-year-round.\nThe Port Police are responsible for ensuring the security and safety of the port and its tenants, employees, users and visitors as well as the international ships visiting the port.\nThe Port of Portland has its own byelaws (Portland Port General Byelaws 2018) and these are enforced by the Port Police.\nPowers\nAll Port Police officers are sworn in as \"special constables\" under Section 79 of the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847 (HDPCA).\nThe act uses the term 'special constable'; at the time this act was passed 'special constable' meant any constable who was not a member of a territorial police force.\nAs a result, officers have the full powers of a constable on \"any land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land\".\nUniform\nPortland Port Police officers wear a typical UK Port Police uniform.\n*Black t-shirt or white shirt & black tie\n*Black trousers\n*Black jacket with police markings and rank slide\n*Black boots\n*Custodian helmet (males) with Portland Port Police helmet badge.\n*Peaked cap with black and white checquered cap band and capbadge.\nAll officers have a \"warrant card\" which is used to identify their authority as constables.\nRank structure\nThe rank structure of the Portland Port Police force is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Rank Structure of the Portland Port Police\n|-\n!
