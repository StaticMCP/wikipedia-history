It is named after King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.\nOverview\nThe King Fahd Islamic Cultural Center became the largest mosque in Latin America, after President Carlos Menem's 1995 grant of  of municipal land in the Palermo section of Buenos Aires, following a state visit to Saudi Arabia.\nInaugurated in 2000, the mosque and cultural center was constructed as a gift from the Saudi government on land donated by the Argentine government. Designed by Saudi architect, Zuhair Fayez in the Arabic style, the building includes prayer halls with capacities for 1,200 men and 400 women. The cultural center hosts a primary and secondary school, as well as a divinities school and a dormitory for 50 students.\nDue to its location, it is also known as La mezquita de Palermo.\nApart from religious activities, the Center also organises sporting and social events such as football and cricket matches (for men exclusively), and Arabic language classes, all of them are free and open to public.\nGallery\nMezquita Centro Cultural Islámico Rey Fahd Buenos Aires 01.JPG|Center main front facade\nMezquita Centro Cultural Islámico Rey Fahd Buenos Aires 12.JPG|Main prayer hall inside mosque\nMezquita Centro Cultural Islámico Rey Fahd Buenos Aires 13.JPG|Main prayer hall inside mosque\nMezquita Centro Cultural Islámico Rey Fahd Buenos Aires 14.JPG|Place where the Imam stands when prayers\nMezquita Centro Cultural Islámico Rey Fahd Buenos Aires 03.JPG|View from road\nMezquita Centro Cultural Islámico Rey Fahd Buenos Aires 07.JPG|A courtyard inside the complex\nMezquita Centro Cultural Islámico Rey Fahd Buenos Aires 05.JPG|\nMezquita Centro Cultural Islámico Rey Fahd Buenos Aires 10.JPG|\nMezquita Centro Cultural Islámico Rey Fahd Buenos Aires 17.JPG|\nMezquita Centro Cultural Islámico Rey Fahd Buenos Aires 19.JPG|\nCentro_Cultural_Islámico_Rey_Fahd,_Buenos_Aires.jpg|\nSee also\n}}\n* Islam in Argentina\n* List of mosques in Argentina\n* List of things named after Saudi kings\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
