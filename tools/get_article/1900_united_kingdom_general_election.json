Also referred to as the Khaki Election (the first of several elections to bear this sobriquet), it was held at a time when it was widely believed that the Second Boer War had effectively been won (though in fact it was to continue for another two years).\nThe Conservative Party, led by Lord Salisbury with their Liberal Unionist allies, secured a large majority of 134 seats, despite having received only 5.6% more votes than Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Liberals. This was largely owing to the Conservatives winning 163 seats that were uncontested by others. The Labour Representation Committee, later to become the Labour Party, participated in a general election for the first time. However, it had only been in existence for a few months; as a result, Keir Hardie and Richard Bell were the only LRC Members of Parliament elected in 1900.\nThis was the first occasion when Winston Churchill was elected to the House of Commons. He had stood in the same seat, Oldham, at a by-election held the previous year, but had lost. It was also the final general election of the Victorian era, as well as the last one where the leader of either of the two largest parties (and by extension, the incumbent Prime Minister) sat in the House of Lords rather than the House of Commons.\nResults\n|}\n}}\nVoting summary\n|50.22}}\n|45.07}}\n|1.77}}\n|1.29}}\n}}\nSeats summary\n|60.00}}\n|27.31}}\n|11.34}}\n|0.30}}\n}}\nSee also\n*List of MPs elected in the 1900 United Kingdom general election\n*Parliamentary franchise in the United Kingdom 1885–1918\n*1900 United Kingdom general election in Ireland\n*1900 United Kingdom general election in Scotland\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.spartacus-educational.com/politics.htm Spartacus: Political Parties and Election Results]\n*[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/geresults.html United Kingdom election results—summary results 1885–1979]\nManifestos\n*[http://www.conservativemanifesto.com/1900/1900-conservative-manifesto.shtml 1900 Conservative manifesto]\n*[http://labourmanifesto.com/1900/1900-labour-manifesto.shtml 1900 Labour manifesto]\n*[http://www.libdemmanifesto.com/1900/1900-liberal-manifesto.shtml 1900 Liberal manifesto]"
