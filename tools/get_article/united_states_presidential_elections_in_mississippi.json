      "text": "# United States presidential elections in Mississippi\n\n| voted_winning = 29\n| voted_losing = 21\n}}\nFollowing is a table of the United States presidential elections in Mississippi, in chronological order by year. Since its admission to statehood in 1817, Mississippi has participated in every U.S. presidential election except the election of 1864, during the American Civil War, when the state had seceded to join the Confederacy, and the election of 1868, when the state was undergoing Reconstruction.\nA socially conservative Deep South state, Mississippi was dominated by the Democratic Party for most of its history, voting almost exclusively Democratic from the founding of the party in the 1820s until the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Since the 1980s, the state has become heavily Republican, like most of the south.\nNotably, Mississippi has also almost always voted for the same presidential candidate as neighboring Alabama. In more than two hundred years of presidential elections, they have supported the same candidate in all but one; the election of 1840, when Mississippi voted for William Henry Harrison and Alabama for Martin Van Buren (in 1868, only Alabama participated, as Mississippi had not yet been readmitted to the Union).\nWinners of the state are in bold. The shading refers to the state winner, and not the national winner.\nElections from 1864 to present\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become president, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!
