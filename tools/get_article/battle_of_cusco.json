As the Spanish army approached Cusco, Pizarro sent his brother Juan Pizarro and Hernando de Soto ahead with forty men. The advance guard fought a pitched battle with Incan troops in front of the city, securing a victory. The Incan army, under the command of Quizquiz, withdrew during the night.\nThe next day, November 15, 1533, Pizarro entered Cusco, accompanied by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a young Inca prince who had survived the massacre that Quizquiz had perpetrated against the nobility in Cusco. The Spanish plundered Cusco, finding much gold and silver. Manco was crowned as Sapa Inca and helped Pizarro drive Quizquiz back to the North.\nTwo years later, Quizquiz was killed by his own followers, leaving the Inca Empire without a leader, since his only equal commander, Chalkuchimac, had been burned in captivity by the Spanish. Three years later, Manco Inca Yupanqui fled from Cusco and tried to recapture the city with some 100,000 Incas, but ultimately failed after a ten-month siege.\nReferences"
