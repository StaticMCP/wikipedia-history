F. Warhurst (born 17 February 1963) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Norwood Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) and the Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is referred to as Tom Warhurst Jr. to distinguish him from his father, Tom Warhurst Sr., although the latter was born Hubert Thomas Warhurst.\nWarhurst had already played over 200 SANFL games when he was signed by Adelaide for their debut season in 1991. He had previously been twice recruited by VFL clubs, but on each occasion decided to stay at Norwood. A three time South Australian representative, Warhurst was a member of Norwood's 1982 and 1984 premiership teams.\nHe took part in Adelaide's first AFL game, against Hawthorn at Football Park, where he kept key forward Dermott Brereton goal-less in a convincing win for the club. The 28-year-old played again the following round, in a loss to Carlton, but did not make any further appearance for Adelaide. It was also his last season of senior football as he needed a knee reconstruction at the year's end.\nHis father, Tom and his brother, John, were also Norwood footballers but are better known for their other careers. His father was a leading tennis player and his brother is a noted academic and republican activist.\nReferences"
