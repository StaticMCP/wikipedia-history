It premiered on Channel 5 on 8 January 2016. It is hosted by Mel B and Professor Green. The concept was introduced on the American chat show Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, in which celebrities battle each other with lip sync performances. It has been used as a recurring segment on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon before being developed as a separate show.\nProduction\nWhizz Kid Entertainment, producers of the series, announced that the first series would consist of eight episodes. However, upon broadcast, only six episodes were shown, with two episodes, Daisy Lowe vs Matt Richardson and Chris Ramsey vs Aston Merrygold, remaining unaired. On 7 November 2016 Channel 5 confirmed that a second series, comprising six episodes, plus an additional Christmas Special, had been ordered and would broadcast from January 2017.\nDespite this, only four episodes aired, with episodes Robert Webb vs Sally Phillips and Joey Essex vs Louie Spence going unaired. In March 2018, the third run of episodes was broadcast by Channel 5; however, despite some listings referring to them as a third series, the four-episode run consisted of the four unaired episodes from the first two series.\nSeries overview\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Originally aired\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\" | Series average(millions)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | First aired\n! scope=\"col\" | Last aired\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9AF8C4;\" |\n| 1\n| 8\n|\n|\n| 1.83\n|-\n| style=\"background:#DBE9F3;\" |\n| CS\n| 1\n| colspan=\"2\"|\n|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#DBE9F3;\" |\n| 2\n| 6\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nEpisodes\n:''Winners are listed in bold\nSeries 1 (2016)\n|episodes   =\n| Viewers = 2.36\n| ShortSummary =\nDixon:\"Shutdown\" by Skepta\"Bad Blood\" by Taylor Swift\nWalliams:\"Work It\" by Missy Elliott\"Hello\" by Adele\n| LineColor = 9AF8C4\n}}\n| Viewers = 2.35\n| ShortSummary =\nManford:\"Forget You\" by CeeLo Green \"Let It Go\" by Idina Menzel\nKeegan:\"Wannabe\" by Spice Girls\"Sex on Fire\" by Kings of Leon\n| LineColor = 9AF8C4\n}}\n| Viewers = 1.95\n| ShortSummary =\nHound:\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\" by Jennifer Holliday \"Boom!
