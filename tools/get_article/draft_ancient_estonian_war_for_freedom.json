The conflict occurred within the broader context of the Livonian Crusade, part of the Papal-sanctioned Northern Crusades, as Christian powers sought to conquer and convert the indigenous pagan populations of the eastern Baltic.\nThe war lasted from approximately 1206 or 1208 until 1227, culminating in the conquest of the last Estonian strongholds and the incorporation of Estonian territories into crusader-controlled domains. The principal contemporary source for these events is the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia.\nBackground\nThe Christianization of the eastern Baltic region, including the areas of present-day Latvia and Estonia, began in the 1180s as part of the broader Northern Crusades initiated by the [[Catholic Church]. By the end of the 1190s, missionary activity in Livonia had intensified and taken the form of a military crusade, sanctioned by the Pope. In 1201, the city of Riga was founded by Bishop Albert of Buxhoeveden, becoming the administrative and military center of the newly established Bishopric of Riga.\nTo support the expanding campaign, Albert enlisted crusaders mainly from the Holy Roman Empire and founded the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in 1202, a military order created to secure territorial gains and convert the local population. With the Livonians forcibly baptized and brought under bishopric control by 1206, the crusade began to shift its focus toward the Estonian tribes to the north, setting the stage for a prolonged period of military conflict and resistance that would last until 1227.\nReferences"
