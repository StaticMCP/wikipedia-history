Norse sagas recorded a battle at Hringmaraheiðr; Old English Hringmere-hǣð, modern name Ringmere Heath.\nThe Anglo-Saxon chronicle records that the English were routed by the flight of Thurcytel \"Mare's head\", and only the men of Cambridgeshire stood to fight.\nJohn of Worcester records that the Danes defeated the English. Over a three-month period the Danes wasted East Anglia, burning Thetford and Cambridge.\nIn his Víkingarvísur, the poet Sigvat records the victory of Saint Olaf, fighting alongside Thorkell the Tall:\n: ''Yet again Óláfr caused a sword-assembly [BATTLE] to be held for the seventh time in Ulfcytel's land, as I recount the tale. The offspring of Ælla [= Englishmen] stood over all Ringmere Heath; there was slaying of the army there, where the guardian of Haraldr's inheritance [= Óláfr] caused exertion.''\nReferences"
