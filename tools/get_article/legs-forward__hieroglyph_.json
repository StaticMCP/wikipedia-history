      "text": "# Legs-forward (hieroglyph)\n\nThe Walking Legs-forward is an ancient Egyptian language hieroglyph of the concept of action, part of \"going and returning\". Walking Legs-returning is the other half.\nThe phonetic value of the hieroglyph is iw, and it means \"to come\". It is also used as a determinative in word formation.\nLanguage usage of Walking Legs-forward\nIn passages written by the pharaoh, or in stories, coming and going is common. Examples are travels to foreign lands, or visitors from other lands. Another example is the coming-and-goings to ceremonial religious sites, or festivals. Another example might be discussions about the need for workers to travel to the quarries or mines.\nRosetta Stone usage\nThough not appearing in the Rosetta Stone, (or the lost beginning half used from the Nubayrah Stele), the twin concept with the \"Walking Legs-returning\" shows how either can be interchanged. And besides Ptolemy V whose name uses the returning walking feet as Ptolemy, illustrious-(\"pr (hieroglyph)-r-feet\"=Epiphany), eucharistos, one good example is shown from line 18, (Nubayrah Stele):\n:He (pharaoh) took care to behold to make 'to go'-(with \"returning feet\"), infantry, cavalry, and ships, to drive back (or, against), those who came-(\"returning feet\"-correct usage) to fight against Egypt...\nThe word 'depart'\nThe going in-and-coming out ideas are complex and interchangeable, as can be shown by the word \"depart\": it uses the Walking Legs-returning hieroglyph.\nSee also\n*Gardiner's Sign List#D.
