The entire selection process lasts 2 months, and its ultimate goal is to recognize the best Graduate of that year nationwide (one for each Scientific discipline).\nUniversity Award\nThe Extraordinary Award () is conferred to the best student of each Graduate School. It can be requested by a graduate student who attained the highest overall graduation grade (“Outstanding”), which can be earned by a maximum of 1 of each 100 students. The Dean invites the 1% top students to a series of three exams, typically one per week. The First Exam is written, and consists of a number of questions related to any subject studied during the last 4–5 years. The Second Exam is oral, in which the student is challenged on a subject of his election. The Third Exam consists of the defense of an original work in the format of a Graduation Thesis.\nCandidates are given marks on each exam, and the overall winner in a discipline is then awarded the Extraordinary Award by the University. The student is recognized in the Graduate Diploma as winner of the Award.\nRegional Award\nAmong the winners of the University Award within a Region, the Regional Government elects the student with the best marks and curriculum. Since these candidate students are already winners of University Awards, thus with the highest possible marks, the Government typically selects the student with most relevant publications in Scientific journals.\nResults are published by the beginning of January, in order to give time to universities to submit their candidates.\nThere is one winner per Region (there are 17 Regions in Spain) and discipline (typically about 20). The student is recognized in the Graduate Diploma as winner of the Award, a medal is also awarded with a sum of money. The names of the winners are published in the “Official Bulletin” of the Region, in the form of a Ministerial Decree.\nNational Graduation Award\nThe National Graduation Award for Higher University Education (in Spanish, “Premio Nacional Fin de Carrera”) has a long tradition in Spain’s Academic history. Some of the most renowned politicians and scientists of Spain won this award, thanks to which attracted the attention and support required to consolidate their careers.\nThe candidates are selected among the winners of Extraordinary Graduation Award. The Ministry of Science reviews the publications, academic works, curriculum, marks and other documentation submitted by the candidate for space of approximately one year.\nBeing the most prestigious academic award, it is conferred once a year by Spain’s Minister of Science to the Graduate student with the best Academic marks over the 5 years studies, granting one award per discipline for all Spain.\nThe names of the winners are made public by Ministerial Decree through Spain’s Official Bulletin (B.O.E.), where all laws must be published. A special Diploma is handed in a solemn ceremony presided by the Minister of Science. A sum of money is also paid. Finally, the recipient is honored by including a mention of the Award in the Graduate Diploma.\nSee also\n* Grading\n* History of education in Spain\n* List of oldest universities in continuous operation\n* University of Santiago de Compostela\nExternal links\n*[https://boe.es/boe/dias/1999/08/13/pdfs/A30104-30114.pdf List of Winners of the National Graduation Award 1999]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090503141938/http://becas.universia.net/ES/reportaje/41/premios-fin-carrera-universitaria.html Article on Academic Awards in Spain]\nReferences"
