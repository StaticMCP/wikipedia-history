The city was taken by the Muslim Rashidun forces after a siege.\nBattle\nThe battle ended the siege by Maja'a bin Masud's troops of the former city of Bishapur, known to the Arabs as Sabur.  In c. 643 Uthman ibn Abi al-As arrived at Bishapur with reinforcements from Basra and besieged the fortified town for several weeks before the town was forced to surrender. He then made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of the city. Further waves of reinforcements arrived under Sariyah bin Zuinem, then followed by forces under Suhail bin Adi, and lastly Asim bin Amr arrived in the region to completely pacify Kerman.\nSubsequent events\nIn 644, al-'Ala' ibn al-Hadrami, the Rashidun governor of Bahrain, once again attacked Fars, reaching as far as Estakhr, until he was repelled by the governor (marzban) of Fars, Shahrak..

A Persian convert to Islam, Hormuz ibn Hayyan al-'Abdi, was shortly sent by Uthman ibn Abi al-'As to attack a fortress known as Senez on the coast of Fars. After the accession of Uthman ibn Affan as the new Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate on 11 November 644, the inhabitants of Bishapur, under the leadership of Shahrak's brother, declared independence, but were defeated.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*"
