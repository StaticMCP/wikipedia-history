It was opened to the public in 1987.\nThe park contains 16 reconstructed dwellings, including a Mesolithic camp, a Neolithic farmstead, a portal dolmen, a cyst grave, a stone circle, a medieval ringfort, a monastic site, crannóg, and a Viking harbour. It covers  of parkland, estuary trails, and wetland forest. It is a nonprofit organisation and all of its receipts from admissions, restaurant, and shop sales go back into the maintenance of the park.\nCourses and events\nThe park runs a selection of courses throughout the year ranging from blacksmithing and wood carving, to stone masonry and mounted combat. One of the goals of the park is to bring traditional skills back into the public. The Trials of Tuan are a set of activities for children. The park also offers guided tours led by costumed guides, as well as audio guides or self-guided options. The guided tour lasts about one and a half hours and ends at the reconstructed Viking harbour.\nCarrig\nAmong the sites in the park is an archaeological excavation at one of the first Norman fortifications in Ireland, on the hill of Carrig, overlooking the river Slaney. The park partnered with the IAFS (Irish Archaeology Field School) to excavate and research the site of the fortification. The site contains ringwork, burnt wooden structures, and a later stone castle. A town grew around the castle and existed until the 1300s.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/heritagepark Heritage park's Youtube channel]"
