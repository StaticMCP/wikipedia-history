As a result of the battle, the Ghaznavids were defeated.\nWhen the Ghaznavid sultan Mahmhud returned from India he blamed his general Subashi for events that had occurred during his absence. He ordered Subashi to march against the Seljuks with his army and wage a battle against them.\nSubashi marched against the Seljuks. Once the Seljuks had heard of his advance they decided to confront the Ghaznavid army. The two armies met in a day long fight at Sarakhs during which the Tughril Beg and Chaghri Beg inflicted a major defeat against the Ghaznavid general Subashi. The Seljuks captured a large amount of booty and captives. This victory gave the Seljuks complete control over Khorasan.\nReferences"
