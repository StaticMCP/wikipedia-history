Stewart was born in Powhatan County, Virginia to free Negro parents who were of mixed ancestry; a mix of white, black, and Indian (specifically Saponi and possibly Chickahominy and/or Accomac).\nSee also\n* John McKendree Springer — Pioneer missionary in Africa\nReferences\nhttp://www.bu.edu/missiology/missionary-biography/r-s/stewart-john-1786-1823/"
