On the Tribe of Heart website for the 2009 film, there is no apparent mention of the 2004 movie.\nThe 2004 film tells the story of how the farmers create an animal sanctuary farm called \"Farm Sanctuary\" where they rescue injured animals, half dead, abandoned, and rejected by the farm industry for not being productive. A few examples are a cow with mastitis or newborn chicks unfit for production.\nIt has won awards such as the Festival Theme Award of the Ojai Film Festival in 2004, with music by Moby. Images of exploitations are shown during the film. According to the primatologist Jane Goodall, \"Peaceable Kingdom is a piece of art\".\nThe documentary's producers, James LaVeck and Jenny Stein, have created a website called HumaneMyth.org that explores whether animals can be used humanely for food, advocating that it is generally not possible to do so.\nSee also\n* Animal rights\n*List of vegan and plant-based media\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.farmsanctuary.org/ Farm Sanctuary]\n* [http://www.tribeofheart.org/index.htm Tribe of Heart]\n*"
