By 1675, the Gonja established a paramount chief, called the Yagbongwura, to control the kingdom. The Ngbanya dynasty has controlled this position from its founding to the present day, with only two brief interregnums.  The current Yagbongwura, Bikunuto Jewu Soale I, has held his position since 2023. The Gonja kingdom was originally divided into sections overseen by male siblings of Sumaila Ndewura Jakpa including their children and grandchildren.\nSee also\n* Gonja people\n* List of rulers of the Northern state of Gonja\nReferences"
