Intermittent conflict at sea, however, continued.\nFor two days in late November of 1782 Commodore Zedechiah Whaley of the Maryland militia  had been waging an indecisive battle during a campaign against British barges of war that had been harassing the shores and farms of Chesapeake Bay.  Desperate for a victory, he sought aid from the Virginia peninsular town of Onancock, sailing Onancock Creek on November 28, 1782, and appealing to Lt. Colonel John Cropper.  Cropper rounded up 25 local men in support, who boarded Whaley's flagship, Protector, and continued his siege upon the British flotilla.\nThree of four of Whaley's barges turned back under heavy British fire, leaving the Protector alone to press the fight against six British craft.  Vastly outnumbered, its crew suffered heavy losses during a climactic action on November 30 in Kedges Strait among Smith and South Marsh islands in Maryland and Tangier Island in Virginia off of Tangier Sound. Twenty-five of its 65 men were killed or wounded, 29 captured, and only 11 escaped.  Whaley's surrender ended the last naval action of the Revolution.\nLegacy\nThe battle of Kedges Strait is recognized by a Virginia highways historical marker near the village of Onancoke, and remains the subject of both academic research and limited guided tours.  In 2016 the  Captain John Smoot Chapter of the Maryland Society Sons of the American Revolution conducted a boat tour of the battle area, and the Maryland Maritime Archeology Program presented a lecture in 2017.\nSee also\n* Battle of Valcour Island - a conflict of barges of war on Lake Champlain that yielded cannons vital to the Colonial cause at the Battle of Bunker Hill\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.markerhistory.com/tag/battle-of-kedges-strait/  Battle of Kedges Strait Virginia Historical Marker, Marker History.com]\n* [https://www.mdssar.org/sites/default/files/archives/3VP_SAR_Annual_Report_April_2017_Rev-D.pdf Maryland Society Sons of the American Revolution Semiannual Meeting Minutes 10-2016]\n* [https://katedolan.com/tag/battle-of-kedges-strait/ Jane's Island is Worth Looking For, K.D.
