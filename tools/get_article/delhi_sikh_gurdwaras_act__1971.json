      "text": "# Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1971\n\nThe Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act of 1971 is an Indian legislation modeled after the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, which determines the management of Sikh places of worship within Delhi Union Territory.\nImpact\nThe 1971 act, more stringent than the 1925 act, required that any Sikhs voting for the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee be baptized Sikhs (amritdhari). It was inspired from the 'Delhi Sikh Gurudwara and Religious Endowments Bill' proposed by Sir Sobha Singh, who was the brainchild of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee. The legislation thus excluded from voting those Sikhs with shorn hair, and the Sahajdhari, persons who generally follow the Sikh lifestyle but are not initiated into the religion.\nReferences"
