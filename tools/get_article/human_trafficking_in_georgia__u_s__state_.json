Human trafficking includes \"the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons by means of threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power, or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.\"\nHistory\n|thumb]]\nHuman trafficking in the form of slavery is known to have been practiced by the original or earliest-known inhabitants of the future colony and state of Georgia, for centuries prior to European colonization. During the colonial era, the practice of Indian slavery in Georgia soon became surpassed by industrial-scale plantation slavery.  While slavery technically became illegal in Georgia after the ratification of the 13th Amendment, slavery continued to thrive legally under the peonage system and aggressive penal labor.\nLaws\nGeorgia law OCGA 16-5-46 prohibits the trafficking of persons for labor or sexual servitude with a more severe penalty for trafficking minors.\nOn April 2, 2015, a new law passed called the SB8 and SR7. Under this law convicted traffickers will register as sex offenders and pay into a state fund called New Safe Harbor to help victims of sex trafficking with physical, mental health, education, job training and legal help.\nHB 200 law went into effect on July 1, 2011. The law is harsher when it involves minors and can be up to a twenty-year prison sentence and a $100,000 fine. Another major step is that the age of consent, which is sixteen, or lack of knowledge of the victim's age is no longer a valid defense.\nSex trafficking in Atlanta\nAtlanta is a major transportation hub for trafficking young girls from southern countries and is one of the fourteen U.S. cities with the highest levels of child sex trafficking.\nIn 2007, the sex trade generated $290 million (~$}} in ) in Atlanta.

In the study, human trafficking is defined in the section: \"Background on the Prevalence of Human Trafficking in the United States\" as  \"any sex act in exchange for which anything of value is given to or received by any person (e.g., prostitution).\" (pg. 7).\nCraigslist is a major medium for the advertisement for sex and the site is known to get three times as many hits as other sites.\n\"The same ready access to commercial air and ground routes that draws businesses and travelers to Atlanta also entices criminals engaged in human trafficking.\" There are numerous events and conventions in Atlanta that bring many people to the city which also exemplifies the issue.\nOrganizations\nOut Of Darkness is an organization that is against sex trafficking which is located in Atlanta Georgia; Out of Darkness falls under the section 501(c) (3).
