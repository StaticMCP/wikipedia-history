These wars saw the Kingdom of Bagratid Armenia and, later, the Zakarid principalities resist Arab incursions with support from the Kingdom of Georgia.\nBagratid–Arab Conflicts (855–c. 1020)\nBackground\nAfter the weakening of the Abbasid Caliphate's control over the South Caucasus, the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia consolidated power. Arab tribal raids continued throughout the region, threatening Armenian sovereignty.\nMajor Campaigns and Battles\n- **855–860:** Early skirmishes between Bagratid forces and Arab tribal groups in the Ararat plain.\n- **890s:** King Smbat I leads campaigns against Arab incursions near Ani.\n- **Early 10th century:** Combined forces of the Bagratid Kingdom and the Kingdom of Georgia repel multiple Arab raids.\nKey Commanders\nBagratid Kingdom and Georgian Allies:\n-  King Ashot I of Armenia (reigned 885–890)\n-  King Smbat I of Armenia (reigned 890–914)\n-  King Ashot II of Armenia (reigned 914–929)\n-  Georgian princes providing auxiliary support\nArab Tribal Forces:\n-  Muhammad Ibn Bashir Al Qaly (Garin)\n-  Bashir (Sevanavank)\n-  Local Arab emirs and tribal leaders (names not consistently documented)\nZakarid–Arab Conflicts (c. 1190–1200)\nBackground\nBy the late 12th century, the Zakarid-Mkhargrdzeli family controlled large territories in northern Armenia under Georgian suzerainty. They continued the resistance against Arab tribes seeking plunder and territorial control.\nMajor Campaigns and Battles\n- **1190–1200:** Zakarid forces under Zakare and Ivane Mkhargrdzeli engage Arab raiders in the Lori and Tavush regions.\n- Skirmishes near Vanadzor and along trade routes to Ani.\nKey Commanders\nZakarid Armenia and Georgian Allies:\n-  Zakare Mkhargrdzeli\n-  Ivane Mkhargrdzeli\n-  Georgian King David IV (support during early Zakarid campaigns)\n-  Local Armenian nobles allied with the Zakarids\nArab Tribal Forces:\n-  Arab tribal chieftains (specific names largely unknown)\n- Various mercenary and tribal groups operating independently in Armenia\nOutcome\nThe Zakarids successfully stabilized northern Armenia under Georgian suzerainty and significantly reduced Arab incursions. This period laid the foundation for Armenian-Georgian cooperation against external threats in the region.\nReferences\n* Suny, Ronald Grigor. The Making of the Georgian Nation.
