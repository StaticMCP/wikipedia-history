The environmental statement for the onshore works was submitted as part of the Lincs Wind Farm application.\nThe wind farm planning consent application was submitted in December 2008. The proposed 500&nbsp;MW wind farm was to be located approximately  north of the north Norfolk coast, and  off the Lincolnshire coast, and covered an area of approximately  in water depths ranging from .
