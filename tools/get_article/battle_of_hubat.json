This was the first encounter between Ahmed's forces with Abyssinians. Ahmed was known as Emir during this battle as he was yet to be given the title Imam.\nBattle\nUpon hearing that a rebel named Ahmed Ibrahim was in a power struggle with the Adal leaders, the Emperor of Ethiopia Dawit II sent his general Degelhan to\nconfront him. The Abyssinian campaign originally seemed successful as large amounts of women and children of Adal were captured by Degelhan including\nthe mother of Ahmed's commander Abu Bakr Qatin. Meanwhile Emir Ahmed had laid a trap in Hubat, splitting his unit into three, he waited for the Abyssinians to enter the region after sacking Harar and ambushed them. The remaining Abyssinian army who were not killed fled in panic, thus Ahmed's troops won decisively and were able to recover stolen booty.\nAftermath\nIn the course of Adal's subsequent invasion of Ethiopia, Degelhan's insights gained from this conflict prompted him to alert Emperor Dawit II regarding the peril posed by the Malassay elite forces, emphasizing that the imperial troops were inadequately prepared to confront them.\nReferences"
