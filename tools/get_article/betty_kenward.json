The Kemp-Welch family were 'solid county Warwickshire stock', appearing in Burke's Landed Gentry. Her brother was the cricketer George Kemp-Welch who married the eldest daughter of Stanley Baldwin.\nShe married Captain Peter Trayton Kenward of the 14th/20th King's Hussars, employed in his family's brewing business, at St Margaret's, Westminster, in 1932, and adopted his name. They divorced in 1942, leaving her with a nine-year-old son. To pay his fees at Winchester School, she worked as a dame (house matron) at Eton College. Captain Kenward remarried, to Patricia (1918–1957), daughter of Bolton Meredith Eyres-Monsell, 1st Viscount Monsell, in 1947, and in 1958 to Bridget Catherine Elizabeth Tucker (1928–2015).\nHer Tatler column was originally called \"On and Off Duty in Town and Country\", becoming \"Jennifer's Diary\" in 1945. She took it to Queen (from 1970 Harpers & Queen) in 1959. She retired in 1991, when she was aged 84. Her obituary in  The Daily Telegraph described her as \"insufferably snobbish and crotchety\", recounting her ferocious treatment of her assistants (many of whom resigned in tears), her propensity for long-running feuds (including, particularly, with Margaret, Duchess of Argyll), and her persistent snubbing of Tatlers social editor, Peter Townend.\nShe appeared as a castaway on the BBC Radio programme Desert Island Discs on 14 December 1974.\nShe was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1986. Her autobiography, ''Jennifer's Memoirs: Eighty-Five Years of Fun and Functions'', was published in 1992.\nShe died on 24 January 2001 in London.\nBibliography\n*\nReferences"
