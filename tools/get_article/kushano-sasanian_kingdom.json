The Sasanian Empire captured the provinces of Sogdia, Bactria and Gandhara from the declining Kushan Empire following a series of wars in 225 CE. The local Sasanian governors then went on to take the title of Kushanshah (KΟÞANΟ ÞAΟ or Koshano Shao in the Bactrian language) or \"King of the Kushans\", and to mint coins. They are sometimes considered as forming a \"sub-kingdom\" inside the Sasanian Empire.\nThis administration continued until 360–370, when the Kushano-Sasanians lost much of their domains to the invading Kidarites; the remainder was incorporated into the Sasanian Empire proper. Later, the Kidarites were in turn displaced by the Hephthalites.\nThe Kushanshahs are mainly known through their coins. Their coins were minted at Kabul, Balkh, Herat, and Merv, attesting the extent of their realm.\nA rebellion of Hormizd I Kushanshah (277–286 CE), who issued coins with the title Kushan-shahanshah (\"King of kings of the Kushans\"), seems to have occurred against contemporary emperor Bahram II (276–293 CE) of the Sasanian Empire, but failed.\nHistory\n(c. 277-286 CE) in Kushan style.]]\nThe Sassanids, shortly after victory over the Parthians, extended their dominion into Bactria during the reign of Ardashir I around 230 CE, then further to the eastern parts of their empire in western Pakistan during the reign of his son Shapur I (240–270). Thus the Kushans lost their western territory (including Bactria and Gandhara) to the rule of Sassanid nobles named Kushanshahs or \"Kings of the Kushans\". The farthest extent of the Kushano-Sasanians to the east appears to have been Gandhara, and they apparently did not cross the Indus River, since almost none of their coinage has been found in the city of Taxila just beyond the Indus.\nThe Kushano-Sasanians under Hormizd I Kushanshah seem to have led a rebellion against contemporary emperor Bahram II (276-293 CE) of the Sasanian Empire, but failed. According to the Panegyrici Latini (3rd-4th century CE), there was a rebellion of a certain Ormis (Ormisdas) against his brother Bahram II, and Ormis was supported by the people of Saccis (Sakastan). Hormizd I Kushanshah issued coins with the title Kushanshahanshah (\"King of kings of the Kushans\"), probably in defiance of imperial Sasanian rule.\nAround 325, Shapur II was directly in charge of the southern part of the territory, while in the north the Kushanshahs maintained their rule. Important finds of Sasanian coinage beyond the Indus in the city of Taxila only start with the reigns of Shapur II (r.309-379) and Shapur III (r.383-388), suggesting that the expansion of Sasanian control beyond the Indus was the result of the wars of Shapur II \"with the Chionites and Kushans\" in 350-358 as described by Ammianus Marcellinus. They probably maintained control until the rise of the Kidarites under their ruler Kidara.\nThe decline of the Kushans and their defeat by the Kushano-Sasanians and the Sasanians, was followed by the rise of the Kidarites and then the Hephthalites (Alchon Huns) who in turn conquered Bactria and Gandhara and went as far as central India. They were later followed by Turk Shahi and then the Hindu Shahi, until the arrival of Muslims to north-western parts of India.\nReligious influences\n(circa 350-365 CE) in Kushan style.\nObv: Bahram with characteristic headdress.\nRev: Shiva with Nandi in Kushan style.]]\nCoins depicting Shiva and Nandi have been discovered, indicating a strong influence of Hinduism.\nThe prophet Mani (210–276), founder of Manichaeism, followed the Sasanian expansion to the east, which exposed him to the thriving Buddhist culture of Gandhara. He is said to have visited Bamiyan, where several religious paintings are attributed to him, and is believed to have lived and taught for some time. He is also related to have sailed to the Indus Valley area (now in Pakistan) in 240 or 241 and converted a Buddhist king, the Turan Shah of India.\nOn that occasion, various Buddhist influences seem to have permeated Manichaeism: \"Buddhist influences were significant in the formation of Mani's religious thought. The transmigration of souls became a Manichaean belief, and the quadripartite structure of the Manichaean community, divided between male and female monks (the 'elect') and lay follower (the 'hearers') who supported them, appears to be based on that of the Buddhist sangha\".\nThe cult of Mithra also flourished and Mithra was regarded as a divine protector of Kushano-Sasanian rulers.\nCoinage\nThe Kushano-Sassanids created an extensive coinage with legend in Brahmi, Pahlavi or Bactrian, sometimes inspired from Kushan coinage, and sometimes more clearly Sassanid.\nThe obverse of the coin usually depicts the ruler with elaborate headdress and on the reverse either a fire temple or Shiva with Nandi.\nFile:KUSHANO-SASANIANS Ardashir I Kushanshah Circa AD 230-250.jpg|Kushano-Sasanian ruler Ardashir I Kushanshah, circa 230-250 CE.

Plates seemingly belonging to the art of the Kushano-Sasanians have also been found in Northern Wei tombs in China, such as a plate depicting a boar hunt found in the 504 CE tomb of Feng Hetu.\nMain Kushano-Sassanid rulers\nThe following Kushanshahs were:\n* Ardashir I Kushanshah (230–245)\n* Peroz I Kushanshah (245–275)\n* Hormizd I Kushanshah (275–300)\n* Hormizd II Kushanshah (300–303)\n* Peroz II Kushanshah (303–330)\n* Varahran Kushanshah (330–365)\nSee also\n* Indo-Parthian\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050828050211/http://grifterrec.com/coins/kushanshah/kushanshah.html Coins of the Kushano-Sassanids]"
