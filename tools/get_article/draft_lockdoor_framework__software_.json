Created by French cybersecurity engineer Sofiane Hamlaoui in 2019, it provides a curated collection of security tools organized by testing phases along with educational resources.\nFeatures\nThe framework distinguishes itself through several key characteristics:\n* Curated tool selection: Focuses on most frequently used penetration testing tools rather than exhaustive collections\n* Educational integration: Includes cheatsheets, methodology guides, and report templates\n* Multi-platform support: Available for Linux distributions and via Docker containers\n* Automated processes: Simplifies tool installation and updates\nTool Categories\nThe framework organizes tools into logical categories:\n* Information gathering (21 tools)\n* Web hacking (15 tools)\n* Privilege escalation (15 tools)\n* Reverse engineering (15 tools)\n* Exploitation (6 tools)\n* Shells (4 tools)\n* Password attacks (4 tools)\n* Encryption/Decryption (2 tools)\n* Social engineering (1 tool)\nDevelopment\nVersion History\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Version\n! Release Date\n! Key Features\n|-\n| 0.6\n| September 2019\n| Initial release with 13 information gathering tools\n|-\n| 1.0 Beta\n| September 2019\n| Expanded to 21 information gathering tools, 15 web hacking tools\n|-\n| 2.2.3\n| March 2020\n| Added privilege escalation scripts\n|-\n| 2.2.4\n| August 2020\n| Improved Docker support\n|-\n| 2.3\n| 2021\n| Production-ready release\n|-\n| 2.4\n| 2024\n| Production-ready release + Auto deployment\n|}\nArchitecture\nThe framework is built primarily in Python with supporting shell scripts. Key architectural components include:\n* Configuration files stored at ~/.config/lockdoor/lockdoor.conf\n* Automatic tool updating capabilities\n* Docker container support\n* Continuous integration pipelines\nComparison with Other Frameworks\nUnlike comprehensive distributions like Kali Linux, Lockdoor Framework emphasizes:\n* Selective tool inclusion based on professional usage\n* Integrated learning resources\n* Simplified deployment options\n* Community-driven development model\nReception\nThe framework has been:\n* Featured on cybersecurity platforms including KitPloit\n* Adopted by security professionals and students\n* Starred over 1,500 times on GitHub\n* Forked nearly 300 times for community modifications\nSee Also\n* Penetration test\n* Kali Linux\n* Metasploit Project\n* Open-source intelligence\nExternal Links\n*\nReferences"
