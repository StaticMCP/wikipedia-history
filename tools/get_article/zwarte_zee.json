It was also the first tug powered by diesel engines as opposed to steam-powered engines.\nDesigned to be able to quickly help ships during an emergency, the Zwarte Zee had a substantial high speed for a tug at . The ship's maiden voyage was held on 3 October 1933 with Princess Juliana as one of the passengers on board.\nService history\nSecond World War\nWhen the Second World War broke out for the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, the Zwarte Zee was requisitioned by the Royal Netherlands Navy. Zwarte Zee was tasked with evacuating the unfinished destroyers  and Philips van Almonde from Vlissingen to The Downs in England. However, Philips van Almonde was unable to launch from its stocks and was scuttled on the slipway instead, leaving Zwarte Zee with just the Isaac Sweers to be towed.\nOn 20 August 1940 the Zwarte Zee was hit during a bombing raid on Falmouth causing it to capsize. The ship was salvaged and towed to a dry dock where it was repaired. Zwarte Zee would also be painted over in full grey naval colors and receive some anti-air armament to defend from future air attacks. During the repairs, one sailor became entangled in a steel cable during the salvage operation and lost his life.\nFrom February 1941 until the end of the war, Zwarte Zee served in the Rescue Tug Section of the British Admiralty with the pennant number W 163. In this role, the ship rescued over  of shipping. During the war, the tug frequently visited American ports. Inspired by the size and power of the design, the V4-M-A1 tugboat design was based on Zwarte Zee. These tugboats were all managed by the Moran Towing and Transportation Corporation, which after the war attempted to break the Dutch dominance in ocean towing.\nPostwar\nIn 1945, the Zwarte Zee returned to Smit. In 1948, the ship was partially rebuilt, with modifications made to the stern. On 31 December 1951, the ship was severely damaged in a collision with the Danish vessel Bjørn Clausen and had to be towed to Saint-Nazaire. On 11 January, the Zwarte Zee arrived at Rotterdam, where it was repaired.\nIn 1961, the ship was renamed Zwarte Zee III, as a new Zwarte Zee, the fourth of this name, had entered service. In early 1962, it was renamed again, this time to Ierse Zee. On 27 October 1966, the ship was towed by the tugs Kinderdijk and Kijkduin to N.V. Frank Rijsdijk's Industrial Enterprises in Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht to be scrapped. During this \"farewell voyage,\" the ship was slowly sailed along the Nieuwe Maas through the port of Rotterdam, allowing many people along the shore to watch the ship's transit.\nReferences"
