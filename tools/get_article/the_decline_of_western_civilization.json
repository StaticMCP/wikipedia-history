The movie is about the Los Angeles punk rock scene and was directed by Penelope Spheeris. In 1981, the Los Angeles Police Department chief Daryl Gates wrote a letter demanding the film not be shown again in the city.\nThe film is the opening act of a trilogy by Spheeris, depicting music scenes in Los Angeles in the late 20th century. The second film, The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years (1988), covers the Los Angeles heavy metal scene of 1987–1988. The third film, The Decline of Western Civilization Part III (1998), chronicles the gutter punk lifestyle of homeless teenagers in the late 1990s.\nIn 2016, The Decline of Western Civilization was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nEtymology\nThe film's title is possibly a reference to music critic Lester Bangs' 1970 two-part review of the Stooges' album Fun House, for Creem magazine, where Bangs quotes a friend who had said the popularity of the Stooges signaled \"the decline of Western civilization\". Another possibility is that the title refers to Darby Crash's reading of Oswald Spengler's Der Untergang des Abendlandes (The Decline of the West). In We Got the Neutron Bomb, an oral history of the L.A. punk rock scene collected by Marc Spitz, Claude Bessy, aka Kickboy, claims that he came up with the title.\nPlot\nFeaturing concert footage of Los Angeles punk bands and interviews both with band members, the publishers of Slash fanzine, and with the punks who made up their audience, the film offers a look into a subculture that was largely ignored by the rock music press of the time.\nThe promotional poster for The Decline, and the record cover of the soundtrack album, featured a close-up frame of Germs singer Darby Crash lying on stage with his eyes closed. Crash died from a heroin-induced suicide before the film was released. The poster was designed before his death.\nBands included are Black Flag, Germs, X, Alice Bag Band, the Circle Jerks, Catholic Discipline, and Fear. The Germs' performance was replicated in the 2007 Darby Crash biopic What We Do Is Secret.\nPerformances\n* Alice Bag Band (Alice Bag, Craig Lee, Rob Ritter, Terry Graham)\n** \"Gluttony\"\n** \"Prowlers in the Night\"\n* Black Flag (Ron Reyes, Greg Ginn, Chuck Dukowski, Robo)\n** \"Depression\"\n** \"Revenge\"\n** \"White Minority\"\n* Circle Jerks (Keith Morris, Greg Hetson, Roger Rogerson, Lucky Lehrer)\n** \"Back Against the Wall\"\n** \"Beverly Hills\"\n** \"I Just Want Some Skank\"\n** \"Red Tape\"\n** \"Wasted\"\n* Catholic Discipline (Claude Bessy, Phranc, Robert Lopez, Rick Jaffe, Craig Lee)\n** \"Barbee Doll Lust\"\n** \"Underground Babylon\"\n* Fear (Lee Ving, Philo Cramer, Derf Scratch, Spit Stix)\n** \"Beef Bologna\"\n** \"I Don't Care About You\"\n** \"I Love Livin' in the City\"\n** \"Let's Have a War\"\n** \"Fear Anthem\"\n* Germs (Darby Crash, Pat Smear, Lorna Doom, Don Bolles)\n** \"Manimal\"\n** \"Shutdown\"\n** \"Richie Dagger's Crime\"\n* X (Exene Cervenka, Billy Zoom, John Doe, D.
