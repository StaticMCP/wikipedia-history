Since 2003, they have used the name That Fucking Tank.\nThey have performed in the UK and Europe with other bands that play their style of music including Yourcodenameis:milo, Lightning Bolt, Oxes, Melt Banana and Don Caballero.\nIn 2008, the duo played Reading and Leeds Festivals.\nIn November 2013, the band played a UK-wide tour with Foals. A nod to their connection with Foals' former band The Edmund Fitzgerald which emerged from the same scene and era.\nThe band have released four albums through independent record labels of the north of England.\nObscene Baby Auction\nThe members of That Fucking Tank along with Giles Bailey and Graham Pilling started their own record label, Obscene Baby Auction, in 2001; its first incarnation running until 2007. It has released EPs and albums by That Fucking Tank, Kill Yourself, Bilge Pump and others.\nRelated bands\nThe band's two members are notable musicians outside of their music in That Fucking Tank. Andy Abbott performs with Leeds supergroup (featuring members of Hookworms and Mucky Sailor) Nope, Elizabeth (solo improvisation / noise / acoustic) and Brass (with members of Shield Your Eyes and Spy vs Spy). James (Jimmy) Islip performs in punk band The Magnificent and has solo acoustic singer/songwriter act.  Islip also played on Chuck Ragan's Revival Tour in 2011 and 2012. Between 2000 and 2006 Abbott and Islip played with Giles Bailey in the trio Kill Yourself.\nPhilosophy\nThat Fucking Tank are long-term advocates of the DIY ethos in music.\nMusical style\nThat Fucking Tank are also known for their unusual equipment, set-up and style, among them the use of the Baritone guitar.\nIn 2012, Clash described their second album as a pounding and relentless mixture of punk, metal and acid house. A year later, Drowned in Sound described them as \"... Britain’s answer to US noise rock duos like Hella and Lightning Bolt\".\nAlthough they act through anti-commercial channels, their records have been reviewed by national music press, such as the NME, The Skinny, and The Quietus.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n*Making a Meal for Beethoven on Old Baby Sex Scene compilation – Obscene Baby Auction (2004)\n*The Day Of Death By Bono Adrenaline Shock – Jealous Records (2006)\n*Owl End on Stench of Muscle compilation (2008)\n*Tanknology – Gringo Records (2009)\n*NWONWOBH split 10-inch – Brew Records (2011)\n*TFT – Gringo Records CD, vinyl self-release on Obscene Baby Auction Records (2012)\n*A Document Of The Last Set – Gringo Records, Vinyl/MP3 (2013)\nSingles and EPs\n* Document of the First Set EP – Jealous Records (2004)\n* Andrew and James on split 7-inch with Grabba Grabba Tape – Gssh Gssh/OBA (2005)\n*Red by King Crimson split 7-inch with Monster Killed by Laser – Run of the Mill Records (2005)\n*Awesome Magnet (with Giles Bailey) picture disc 7-inch with Euro tour DVD – On the Bone Records (2007)\nReferences"
