In his rookie season, Stewart led the Jaguars in rushing with 525 yards and had two rushing touchdowns. He led the team again in 1996 with 723 yards and eight touchdowns. He finished the 1997 season with 555 yards and eight touchdowns, however he finished second on the team that year in rushing yards behind teammate Natrone Means. Stewart still holds the franchise record for the most points in a single game (30) and for the most rushing touchdowns in a game (5). Both these records were obtained on October 12, 1997, in a 38-21 Week 7 win over the Philadelphia Eagles. The Jaguars drafted Fred Taylor as their new franchise back in 1998 and, as a result, Stewart only rushed for 217 yards and two touchdowns. Due to injuries to Taylor in 1999, Stewart once again led the team with 931 rushing yards and had a career-high 13 touchdowns.\nStewart finished his Jaguars career rushing 765 times for 2,951 yards and 33 touchdowns. Stewart also played in six playoff games, including two AFC Championships, rushing 31 total times for 162 yards and two touchdowns.\nDetroit Lions\nStewart became a free agent and signed with the Detroit Lions prior to the 2000 season. In his first year playing for the Lions, Stewart rushed for a career-high 1,184 yards and 10 touchdowns. In 2001, he rushed for 685 yards and one touchdown. During the 2002 season, he had another 1,000-plus yard season (1,021) and four touchdowns. He rushed for a career-high 172 yards in a 23-20 Week 7 victory over the Chicago Bears. He was, however, injured late in 2002 with a severe shoulder injury and did not play in 2003, ending his career. According to Coy Wire, Stewart's injury occurred because of a bounty system established by then Buffalo Bills head coach Gregg Williams. Wire stated: \"I shattered James Stewart's shoulder and he never played again. I was showered with praise for that. It's a shame that's how it was. Now I see how wrong that was.\"\nStewart finished his time with the Lions rushing 713 times for 2,890 yards and 15 touchdowns. In his career, he rushed for a total of 1,478 times for 5,841 yards and 48 touchdowns.\nNFL career statistics\nRegular season\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! colspan=\"2\"| Games\n! colspan=\"5\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"5\"| Receiving\n! colspan=\"2\"| Fumbles\n|-\n!
