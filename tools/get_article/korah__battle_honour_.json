On June 10, 1776, Col Parker sent a demand that the guns be surrendered and, when this demand was refused, the British attacked. In a brief, but bloody, engagement, Mabub Khan's troops were defeated and the guns captured.\nThe award was made to the 1st and 10th Regiments of Bengal Native Infantry.\nSee also\n*Battle honours of the British and Imperial Armies\nReferences"
