It was a merger of the Caterham Urban District with the similar North Downs civil parish of Warlingham to the east and more rural and entirely hilltop civil parish of Woldingham from Godstone Rural District to the south-east.\nIn 1933 the Urban District absorbed the narrow majority, the entirely hilltop segment, of Chaldon to the west from defunct Reigate Rural District, in so doing, the contributor parish shedding  to the parish of Bletchingley and  to Coulsdon to the south and north respectively.\nAn urban and suburban area of equal contribution between the two merged areas finally became a later civil parish after the area's abolition, Whyteleafe which had already its own railway station and church; it was throughout the district's duration identifiable as a village.\nAbolition\nCaterham and Warlingham was abolished in 1974 due to the Local Government Act 1972 to form the north-west of the Tandridge (district) which is the easternmost part of the county and covers a much larger area, shown in red in the inset map and in grey and yellow in the main section of map.\nReferences"
