These are organised by World Athletics and include track and field, cross country running, road running, and racewalking.\nThe first athletes awarded World Athlete of the Year in 1988 were Americans, namely sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner and track and field athlete Carl Lewis.\nJamaican sprinter Usain Bolt is the only athlete to win the World Athlete of the Year Awards six times. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva and Morocco's middle-distance runner Hicham El Guerrouj have won the main award three times. Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis has also won the award three times including the inaugural World Athlete of the Year (Men's Field) award in 2023 after World Athletics Awards changed from crowning a sole male and female winner to issuing awards across six categories. American track and field athlete Marion Jones, sprinter Sanya Richards-Ross representing the US, Carl Lewis and other American sprinter Michael Johnson, Ethiopia's long-distance runner Kenenisa Bekele, Kenya's long-distance runner Eliud Kipchoge and Venezuela's triple-jumper Yulima Rojas have won the award twice each.\nThe Rising Star of the Year award was inaugurated in 1998, when Great Britain's sprinter Christian Malcolm was awarded. The first woman to be voted was 400 m and 400 m H specialist, Jana Pittman of Australia, in 2000.\nEthiopian long-distance runner Kenenisa Bekele was the first to receive Rising Star award followed by Athlete of the Year trophy in 2003 and 2004 respectively. The other athletes to achieve the feat were Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, American sprinter Allyson Felix, Belgian heptathlete Nafissatou Thiam, Venezuelan triple jumper Yulimar Rojas, American hurdler and sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levron, Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis, and Norwegian hurdler Karsten Warholm. Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt and American sprinter Erriyon Knighton are the only two athletes to be crowned Rising Star twice.\nChanges to awards system\nIn 2003, the International Fair Play Committee (CIFP) first collaborated with World Athletics to look for moments that epitomise fair play during biennial World Athletics Championships with a view to recognising one athlete or moment with the CIFP Fair Play award. In earlier years of the award,  the nomination pool included track & filed athletes who had then retired but had made a lasting name for themselves both as competitors as well as in their daily lives. In 2023, the partnership expanded the nomination period for award consideration beyond just the World Athletics Championships to include all World Athletics Series events and Continental Tour series events throughout the course of the year to enrich the pool of eligible athletes and potential nominations.\nIn 2009, on the recommendation of IAAF Press Commission, the IAAF World Journalist Award was created  to mark outstanding lifetime contributions in the field of athletics journalism.  Germany's Gustav Schwenk was the first recipient of this award. The award was last given out in 2015.\nIn 2015, World Athletics (then IAAF) together with their sponsor Adidas launched the Golden Shoe award to recognise the Best Performer of the IAAF World Championships, Beijing 2015. The award went to Almaz Ayana (ETH). 2015 was the singular year the Golden Shoe Award was presented by Adidas. Following the doping crisis sweeping the sport and implicating World Athletics directly, Adidas decided to terminate their sponsorship deal with World Athletics three years earlier ending in 2016 instead of 2019.\nIn 2020, three new awards were created amongst the eight given out at the annual World Athletics Awards ceremony to commemorate the challenges faced by athletes, event organisers and their support groups in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The new honours were namely Covid inspiration award, athletes community award and member federations award.\nIn 2023, the World Athlete of the Year awards for men and women were expanded into three event categories: track, field, and out of stadium.\nIn 2024, World Athletics further revamped the World Athletics Awards system.  Besides the three separate World Athlete of the Year awards for each gender, there will also be men's and women's awards for an \"overall World Athlete of the Year\". Two finalists in each of the three category will progress to be considered for the overall World Athlete of the Year awards.\nThe system for selecting the winner for 2024 had also changed. As before, a three-way voting process with votes from the World Athletics Council (50%), World Athletics Family (25%) and the public via social media (25%) determined the finalists. However, a final round of voting cast by fans of the sport decided the overall World Athlete of the Year once the finalists had been established.\nLetsile Tebogo and Sifan Hassan were the first men's and women's recipients of this overall winner awards in 2024. Each of them won two awards. Besides the overall award, they won the Athlete of the Year award for their event category too: Tebego was voted the Men's Track Athlete of the Year and Hassan was the winner of the Women's Out of Stadium Athlete of the Year award.\nAnnual awards\nAs of 2024, the World Athletics Awards included the World Athlete of the Year awards, Rising Star awards, Coaching Achievement Award, Woman of the Year, Photograph of the Year, Member Federation Award, President's Award  and CIFP Fair Play award. The CIFP Fair Play award, previously a biennial award given out after each World Athletics Championships, became an annual award after the expansion of nomination period in 2023.\nOccasional awards\nAwards that were given out on occasion when there are deserving nominees included the Lifetime Achievement awards (various types including those for athletes & coaches), Inspiration awards, World Athletics City award, Distinguished Career awards and Master Athlete of the Year awards.\nPast awards\nPast awards that had been discontinued  included Performance of the Year awards, World Journalist awards and Journalist Lifetime Achievement award.\nSpecial awards\nSpecial awards were given out in the past to honor the outstanding achievements of an athlete and/or to commemorate a special milestone in the history of the sport. These included the historic Athlete of the 20th Century awards (1999), an award to mark 80 Years of Women Athletes at the Olympic Games (2008) and the Special Olympic awards given out after the Beijing Games (2008).\nAthlete of the Year winners\nhas won the World Athlete of the Year award three times in 2001–2003.]]\nwas World Athlete of the Year in 2004, 2005 and 2008, the most wins in the
