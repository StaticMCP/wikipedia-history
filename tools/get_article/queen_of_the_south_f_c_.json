The club plays in , the third tier of Scottish football. They are traditionally nicknamed the Doonhamers but are more usually referred to as Queens or QOS. Their home ground is Palmerston Park.\nThe club won the Division B Championship in 1950–51, the Second Division Championship in 2001–02 and 2012–13, and the Scottish Challenge Cup in 2002–03 and 2012–13. Queens led Scotland's top division until New Year in the 1953–54 season: their highest finish in Scotland's top division was fourth in 1933–34. The club reached their first major cup final in 2008 when they reached the final of the Scottish Cup, where they were runners-up to Rangers. The club's current manager is Peter Murphy.\nHistory\nStadium\nPalmerston Park is located on Terregles Street in Dumfries. The club has played there since 1919. South of Scotland League club Heston Rovers have shared Palmerston since 2013. The stadium has a capacity of  of which 3,377 are seats.\nSupporters and culture\nRobbie Neilson, the former manager of Hearts, said about Queens from his loan period at the club in 2002: \"It's a well-run club and a real family club with a good spirit about the place.\"\nMarc Horne wrote in The Scotsman following Queens appearance in the 2008 Scottish Cup Final: \"In the Palmerston Park club's songbook, it is clear there is no room for songs which feature religion, violent vendettas or centuries-old battles that took place in other lands.\"\nIn the 2008 UEFA Cup qualifying trip to Denmark Queen of the South fans were hailed as \"a great credit both to their club and to Scotland\" by Danish police. About 850 supporters of the Dumfries club travelled to Denmark to watch the UEFA Cup clash with FC Nordsjælland. Even though their team was eliminated, local police said their behaviour was impressive. Inspector Rune Hamann said: \"It was a pleasure hosting such a visit by Queen of the South whose supporters were extremely well behaved and a great credit both to their club and to Scotland. Copenhagen was particularly busy in the build up to and after the match with a carnival, party atmosphere being evident. I look forward to welcoming Queen of the South and their terrific supporters back in Denmark in the future.\"\nChief Inspector Mickey Collins from Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary said the fans were a \"pleasure to work along with\". He added: \"Despite the huge numbers of supporters who travelled to Denmark there were no arrests, incidents or issues of any concern. Great praise should be passed on to those fortunate enough to be at the match\".\nA notable Queen of the South supporter is the DJ and producer Calvin Harris, who grew up in Dumfries. He considered writing a song to celebrate the team reaching the 2008 Scottish Cup Final, but the idea was scrapped due to the time constraints of recording his 2009 album Ready for the Weekend.\nBill Drummond, musician, producer, and former member of The KLF, is a supporter as well due to their proximity to his hometown of Newton Stewart.\nMascot\nThe club mascot is 'Dougie Doonhamer', a human-sized border collie dog. The character has been played for many years by local supermarket worker Brian Harkness.\nOn 25 August 2017, Dougie Doonhamer won the Ladbrokes SPFL mascot race at Hamilton Park, having been runner-up the previous year.\nOn 31 August 2018, Dougie Doonhamer won the Ladbrokes SPFL mascot race at Hamilton Park for the second consecutive year.\nBiblical references\nQueen of the South are often humorously cited as the only league club in the United Kingdom to be mentioned in the Bible. Luke 11:31 states \"The Queen of the South shall rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them...\" Queen of the South is similarly quoted under Matthew 12:42. In the biblical quote the \"Queen of the South\" is considered to be the Queen of Sheba. In 2005, the issue was investigated by The Guardian website in their series \"The Knowledge\", which also found full references to Arsenal, Bury and Reading, as well as partial references to \"hearts\", \"wolves\", \"forest\", \"hammer\", \"spurs\" and \"man's field\".\nHonours\nNational League Competitions\nDivision 2 – Champions 1950–51, 2001–02, 2012–13; Runners-up 1932–33, 1961–62, 1974–75, 1980–81, 1985–86\nDivision 3 – Runners-up 1924–25\nNational Cup Competitions\nScottish League Challenge Cup – Winners 2002–03, 2012–13; Runners-up 1997–98, 2010–11\nScottish Qualifying Cup – Winners 1923–24\nScottish Cup – Runners-up 2007–08\nB.P.
