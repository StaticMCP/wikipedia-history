The aim is to connect researchers and policy makers on topics linked to scientific research in order to promote evidence-based policy making. After the launch Jean-Claude Juncker declared: \"Innovation and new scientific discoveries are improving people's lives and making our economy more competitive. Science should be open and freed from its traditional ivory tower; to be discussed, submitted to critique and fed with new perspectives. That's why I warmly welcome efforts such as the REIsearch initiative to inspire fresh ideas about how to solve some of our society's most pressing problems\".\nIn the first three years of activity REIsearch has focused on specific subject areas such as [https://www.eismd.eu/media-campaign-on-chronic-diseases/ Chronic Diseases], in collaboration with European Commission's DG Sante, [https://www.eismd.eu/reisearchs-media-campaign-on-the-next-generation-internet-report/ Next Generation Internet] and [https://www.eismd.eu/media-campaign-on-digital-skills-analysis-and-results/ Digital Skills], in collaboration with DG Connect, reaching hundreds of thousands of European citizens with its media campaigns and surveys.\nAI4People\nIn 2018 the Institute have launched AI4People the first multi-stakeholder forum in Europe to shape the debate on AI Ethics in the European Union and prompt European institutions to act quickly to stem future AI risks.
