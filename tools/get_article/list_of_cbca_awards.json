The awards have grown and now there are five categories in the Book of the Year Awards and numerous other awards presented annually by the National Office and CBCA branches in each State and Territory.\nThe winner of the inaugural award received a flower, \"a camellia\". In more recent times the awards have been funded through Government grants (1966–1988), and lately by individual and corporation donations and sponsorships. The CBCA decided in 1995 to establish an Award Foundation to secure the funding for these awards for the future.\nChildren’s Book Council of Australia Book of the Year Awards\nFive award categories are selected annually. They are:\n* CBCA Book of the Year: Older Readers — for readers in their secondary years of schooling\n* CBCA Book of the Year: Younger Readers — for readers from the middle to upper primary years\n* CBCA Book of the Year: Early Childhood — for children who are at pre-reading or early stages of reading\n* CBCA Book of the Year: Picture Book — for outstanding books of the Picture Book genre\n* Children's Book of the Year Award: New Illustrator – for new talent in the field of Australian children's book illustration\n* Eve Pownall Award for Information Books — for books that document factual material\nOther CBCA Awards\n* Dame Annabelle Rankin Award – presented for distinguished services to children’s literature in Queensland.\n* Nan Chauncy Award – a national biennial award presented to recognise a person’s outstanding contribution to the field of children’s literature in Australia.\n* Crichton Award for Children's Book Illustration (1988–2018), now the Children's Book of the Year Award: New Illustrator\n*Leila St John Award – for services to children’s literature in Victoria.\n* Lady Cutler Award – presented for distinguished services to children's literature in NSW.\nAustralian Children's Choice Awards\nThe CBCA Book of the Year awards are a literary award.
