It was developed in November 1974, with the first aircraft delivered in September 1977. It is a pressurized, 8–9 passenger turbine development of the Cessna 404 Titan. The ICAO designator as used in flight plans is C441.\nDevelopment\nThe original design from 1972 for this aircraft was known as the Model 435 and was to be powered by Continental GTSIO-520X engines with three-bladed propellers. By 1975, the designed evolved into the turboprop-powered Model 441. It was certified by the FAA on August 19, 1977.  The high aspect ratio wings use bonded construction techniques.\nCessna renamed the Model 441 the Conquest II in 1983.\n1984 models starting with constructor number 195 used lighter-weight, four-bladed McCauley propellers.\nA 441 with Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-112 turboprops was flown in 1986, but did not enter production. Cessna built 362 of the aircraft between 1977 and 1986.\nA smaller aircraft was marketed as the Cessna 425 Conquest I, itself a turbine development of the Cessna 421.\nIn September 2007, Cessna limited the Conquest II to 22,500 hours of air time through a Supplemental Inspection Document. This makes it effectively mandatory for US air carriers but only advisory for private operators.\nPerformance\nThe Cessna 441 cruises at  true airspeed while burning  of fuel per hour at flight level 290. The aircraft's maximum range is  at  TAS and /h at FL350.\nWith six to nine seats, its  basic operating weight (BOW) allows a  payload at full fuel, but MTOW can be increased by  with aftermarket modifications.\nUpgrades\nMost 441s currently in service have been upgraded to TPE331-10 engines and four-bladed propellers (if not originally equipped). The -10 engine increases climb performance, service ceiling, and TBO, while four-blade propellers increase climb rate, cruise speed, and ground clearance, while reducing cabin noise.\nOperators\nin Perth, Australia]]\nThe Conquest II is operated by corporate owners, air charter operators and previously by the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia. Examples of the type have been exported to many countries including Austria, Australia, Canada, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Mexico, Norway, Peru, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\nBy May 2019, 290 aircraft remained in service, at a $.75-.9M value down from $1-1.9M in 2011.\nSpecifications (Conquest II)\n|prime units?=imp\n|genhide=\n|crew=1 or 2 pilots\n|capacity=8–10 passengers\n|length m=\n|length ft=39\n|length in=0\n|span m=\n|span ft=49\n|span in=4\n|height m=\n|height ft=13\n|height in=2\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=253.6\n|airfoil=NACA 23018 at root, NACA 23019 at tip\n|aspect ratio=9.6:1\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=5682\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=9850\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=2\n|eng1 name= Garrett TPE331-10-403S\n|eng1 type=turboprops\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 shp=636\n|power original=\n|more power=\n|prop blade number=4\n|prop name=McCauley|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=340\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=at 16,000 ft (4,875 m)\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=298\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=at 35,000 ft (10,700 m)\n|stall speed kmh=139\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=flaps and gear down\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|minimum control speed kmh=\n|minimum control speed mph=\n|minimum control speed kts=\n|range km=\n|range miles=2525\n|range nmi=\n|range note=at 35,000 ft (10,700 m)\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=35000\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=2435\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading=\n|more performance=\n|power/mass=\n|avionics=\n* Cessna 1000A Integrated Flight Control System\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?aircraft_genericsearch=Cessna%20441%20Conquest%2FConquest%20II&distinct_entry=true Airliners.net - Photographs]\n* [http://www.airliners.net/info/stats.main?id=156 Airliners.net - Cessna Conquest]"
