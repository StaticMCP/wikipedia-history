Ken Howard stated in The White Shadow season 1 DVD commentary that, after seeing a re-run of Fire Sale, he immediately phoned Bruce Paltrow and said he wanted Stewart for a role as one of his basketball players. Howard wanted at least one \"player\" taller than himself for the \"team.\"\nStewart, who is 6'8\" tall, later reprised the role of Warren Coolidge in another Paltrow-directed series, St. Elsewhere. The explanation was that Coolidge had to give up basketball because of an injury while in his sophomore year at Boston College. Due to his injury, he lost his scholarship, dropped out and became an orderly at St. Eligius Hospital.\nToday, Stewart is a grandfather of eight living in Riverside County, California. He still occasionally reads for acting roles. He is divorced with four children.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110521102737/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/1340964-warren-coolidge King of Carver Cool wears No. 7 in TV Greats Countdown]"
