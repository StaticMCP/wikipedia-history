It was the second election during the Brazilian military government, with Artur da Costa e Silva as the sole candidate. Costa e Silva was elected with 294 votes from the ruling National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA).\nBackground\nPresidential elections had been scheduled for 3 October 1965. However, nine days after the Congress declared vacancy of the Presidency, the Castelo Branco government published on 27 October 1965 Institutional Act no. 2 which, among its attributions, defined that the next President would be chosen by the National Congress and with a maximum of two candidates. Therefore, Castelo Branco, who was supposed to govern temporarily until 31 January 1966, extended his term until 15 March 1967, when the new president would replace him.\nThere had been five pre-candidacies for the election scheduled for 1964: former president Juscelino Kubitschek with slogan \"JK-65, the time of agriculture\" (), governor of Guanabara Carlos Lacerda, former governor of Rio Grande do Sul Leonel Brizola, former president Jânio Quadros and then-governor of Pernambuco Miguel Arraes. All candidacies were aborted and the election never occurred.\nFollowing various cessations of political rights, politicians including Kubitschek, Lacerda, Quadros and Adhemar de Barros were proscribed after allegations of conspiracy and corruption. Once again, the National Congress of Brazil elected the president. The vice-presidential candidacy was linked with the candidacy of the presidency. Only two political parties were legal at the time. However, the opposition party did not put forward a candidate.\nResults\nReferences"
