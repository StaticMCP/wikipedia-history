It was released on April 3, 2007, through RCA Nashville. This album is the first in McBride's career in which she has both co-written songs and been involved in the production single-handedly. This album produced three chart singles for McBride on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart with \"Anyway\" at #5, \"How I Feel\" at #15, and \"For These Times\" at #35. The album was certified Gold by the\nRIAA.\nContent\nWaking Up Laughing is the first album of McBride's career in which she co-wrote any of the material. McBride wrote the lead-off single \"Anyway\" with Brad and Brett Warren of The Warren Brothers. This song reached #5 on the Hot Country Songs charts in early 2007, becoming McBride's first Top 10 country hit in three years. The Warren Brothers and McBride also co-wrote \"How I Feel\", the second single, with Chris Lindsey and Aimee Mayo.\n\"For These Times\" was inspired by former Republican senator Rick Santorum, who was defeated in 2006, and his daughter. When his daughter began to cry at his loss, the cameras focused on her, inspiring Leslie Satcher to write the song. It was also inspired by her Pastor, who stated \"For these times in which we live, you are going to need this book.\" referring to the Bible. The song received a 2009 Grammy nomination.\n\"Cry Cry ('Til the Sun Shines)\" was covered by former Trick Pony lead vocalist Heidi Newfield on her debut solo album, What Am I Waiting For, from which it was released as a single in November 2008.\nTrack listing\n| length1         = 3:43\n| title2          = Cry Cry ('Til the Sun Shines)\n| writer2         =\n| length2         = 3:06\n| title3          = Tryin' to Find a Reason\n| writer3         =\n| length3         = 3:26\n| title4          = For These Times\n| writer4         = Leslie Satcher\n| length4         = 4:16\n| title5          = Anyway\n| writer5         =\n| length5         = 4:40\n| title6          = How I Feel\n| writer6         =\n| length6         = 3:48\n| title7          = I'll Still Be Me\n| writer7         =\n| length7         = 3:49\n| title8          = Beautiful Again\n| writer8         =\n| length8         = 2:56\n| title9          = Everybody Does\n| writer9         =\n| length9         = 3:27\n| title10         = House of a Thousand Dreams\n| writer10        =\n| length10        = 3:53\n| title11         = Love Land\n| writer11        =\n| length11        = 3:56\n| title12         = Blue Bayou\n| note12          = iTunes pre-order bonus track\n| writer12        =\n| length12        = 4:05\n|total_length = 41:03\n}}\nPersonnel\n* Martina McBride – lead vocals, harmony vocals(2, 8, 9)\n* Steve Nathan – acoustic piano (1, 4, 7, 10, 11), Hammond B3 organ (1, 4, 6, 8, 9), synthesizers (10, 11)\n* Reese Wynans – Hammond B3 organ (2, 3)\n* Tim Lauer – synthesizers (3), accordion (8, 10), pump organ (10)\n* Gordon Mote – acoustic piano (5)\n* B.
