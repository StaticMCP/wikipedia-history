The fortress is referred to as \"Xincheng\" (新城; literally: \"new city/fortress\") in historical sources.\nThe battle\nIn 233, the Wu emperor Sun Quan led an army across the Yangtze River to attack Xincheng. However, as the fortress was located very inland, Sun Quan's forces remained on their ships for more than 20 days. Man Chong, the Wei general defending Xincheng, secretly sent 6,000 infantry and cavalry to wait in ambush near the river. When Sun Quan's forces set foot on land, they were suddenly attacked by the Wei army lying in ambush. Hundreds of Wu soldiers were killed while others drowned in the river as they attempted to flee. Sun Quan ordered a retreat after his defeat. He later sent Quan Cong to attack Lu'an, but Quan was unsuccessful and withdrew as well.\nReferences\n* Chen, Shou (3rd century).
