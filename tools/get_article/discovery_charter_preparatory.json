In 2003, the school added the 10th grade, with 11th grade added in 2004 and 12th grade in 2005. Since 2015, DP moved to a new site in Sylmar, California.\nOn May 29, 2020, Citibank lent the school $350,000 to $1 million.\nCurriculum\nDiscovery Charter's curriculum is dedicated to college preparation and follows the Common Core standards.
