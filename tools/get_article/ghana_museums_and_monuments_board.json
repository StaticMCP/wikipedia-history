It was founded on 5 March 1957, soon after Ghana became independent, by a merger of the National Museum and the Monuments and Relics Commission by Ordinance 20.\nHistory\nThe origins of the GMMB can be traced back to the establishment of an ethnographic museum at Achimota College (now the Achimota School) in 1929. Following the establishment of the University of Ghana (then known as the University of the Gold Coast) in 1948, the museum was transferred to the university's archaeology department.\nIn 1952, the British colonial government established an \"Interim Council of the National Museum of the Gold Coast\". The council later merged with the Monuments and Relics Commission to create the modern GMMB.\nProjects\nMuseum of the Nzema Culture and History\nIn 1989 the GMMB signed an agreement with the Italian Ethnological Mission to Ghana (IEMG) which had been reformed under the leadership of Italo Signorini after a period of almost fifteen years of inactivity.\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\nExternal links\n*"
