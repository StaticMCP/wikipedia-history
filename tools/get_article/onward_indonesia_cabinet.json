ministers. The most notable addition to the cabinet was businessman Sandiaga Uno. His admission into the cabinet following his former running mate in the 2019 presidential election Prabowo Subianto, made it the first time in Indonesia's history that all former contestants of a single presidential election were in the same cabinet. The new ministers were sworn in on 23 December 2020. Five deputy ministers were also appointed, three of them to new deputy minister positions.\nSecond reshuffle\nOn 30 March 2021, the president proposed to the People's Representative Council changes to the structure of his cabinet, seeking to merge the Ministry of Research and Technology and the Ministry of Education and Culture into a single ministry named the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. He also proposed a new ministry, the Ministry of Investment to be spun off from the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs, but remaining under the latter's coordination, while the National Research and Innovation Agency would be separated as a new non-ministerial agency. On 9 April 2021, the People's Representative Council approved the changes. On 13 April 2021, presidential spokesman Ali Mochtar Ngabalin said the second reshuffle would take place in the second week of April. However, the reshuffle was announced on 28 April 2021. Unusually, it not only reshuffled some ministers, but also disbanded a ministerial institution during the mid-term.\nThird reshuffle\nSince the National Mandate Party joined the government coalition on 25 August 2021, there has been controversy over a potential third cabinet reshuffle to allow the party to join the cabinet. On 23 September 2021, the party stated to be ready to take place and contributing together with the government in the cabinet. It was said that the third reshuffle will take place between the end of September 2021 and early October 2021; however, the deadline passed and no reshuffle took place. On 25 October 2021, President Spokesperson Fadjroel Rachman was appointed as Indonesian Ambassador to Kazakhstan, leaving his post vacant. The position was then filled by Joko Widodo himself.\nOn 17 November 2021, the question of the third reshuffle arose again. However, sources from unnamed president officials revealed that the future reshuffle was not because of issues regarding minister performance, but due to replacement after several ministers contracted COVID-19 and became physically disabled, severely limiting their ability to serve in their positions. Since the end of 2020, Joko Widodo opened many deputy minister posts in many ministries, however, the positions are yet to be filled. This includes the Deputy Minister post at Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, adding to the long list of vacant deputy minister posts created in his presidency. On 18 November 2021, the People's Consultative Assembly formally requested Joko Widodo to conduct a reshuffle as fast as possible due to the large number of vacant deputy minister positions.\nOn 8 March 2022, a question of the third reshuffle arose again. This time there was a rumor that National Mandate Party will gain a position in the cabinet and the reshuffle will be done in late March 2022. The rumor was quickly dispelled by Zulkifli Hasan, the party leader himself. In fact, the third reshuffle realized on 10 March 2022. In the third reshuffle, Bambang Susantono was inaugurated as the Head of Nusantara Capital City Authority, and Dhony Rahajoe was inaugurated as the Deputy Head of Nusantara Capital City Authority.\nFourth reshuffle\nOn 15 June 2022, the fourth reshuffle occurred. In this reshuffle, 2 ministers reshuffled, and 3 deputy ministers were set up. A Deputy minister post, Deputy Minister of Public Works and Housing is vacated. The reshuffle marked as the first time an Indonesian cabinet is reshuffled four times since the era of the National Unity Cabinet under Wahid's administration.\nFifth reshuffle\nOn 24 June 2022, Tjahjo Kumolo reported contracted unknown illness and replaced by Mahfud MD as ad interim Minister of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform. He died after being hospitalized at Abdi Waluyo Hospital in Jakarta on 1 July 2022. Potential fifth reshuffle will be announced later after mourning period. Fifth reshuffle likely done after 15 July 2022, coincidentally at the day with the end of mourning period and Tito Karnavian limit of ad interim. On 15 July, Mahfud MD appointed as acting Minister of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform. On 7 September 2022, Abdullah Azwar Anas become Minister of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform in the fifth reshuffle.\nSixth reshuffle\nNasdem Party declared Joko Widodo's political rival, Anies Baswedan, as a presidential candidate on October 3, 2022. As the result, pro-Joko Widodo side voiced and promoted the reshuffle and expelled Nasdem Party from the cabinet. On 23 December 2022, Joko Widodo announced he will reshuffle his cabinet, although not giving much detail which minister that will be reshuffled. The Executive Office of the President of the Republic of Indonesia confirmed that the reshuffle will be realized in January 2023, but it never happened until the time past.\nZainuddin Amali expressed his intention to step down his position as Minister of Youth and Sport Affairs after being elected as Indonesian Football Association vice president. His intention finally realized and Joko Widodo accepted his resignation on 13 March 2023. On 16 March 2023, Zainuddin Amali stepped down from the minister position and replaced with Muhadjir Effendy as acting minister. The sixth reshuffle took place 3 April 2023. In this occasion, Dito Ariotedjo of Golkar Party, appointed as replacement of Zainuddin Amali. He was the first Indonesian millennial appointed as the minister.\nSeventh reshuffle\nOn 17 May 2023, Minister of Communication and Information Technology Johnny G. Plate arrested due to corruption, leaving potential seventh reshuffle opened. On 19 May 2023, Mahfud MD appointed as acting minister. On 17 July 2023, Joko Widodo reshuffled his cabinet. In this reshuffle, he placed Budi Arie Setiadi placed as the new minister of Communication and Information Technology. He also placed other deputy ministers as well.\nEighth reshuffle\nOn 3 August 2023, Amarulla Octavian, appointed as the Deputy Chairman of National Research and Innovation Agency.\nNinth reshuffle\nPotential ninth reshuffle currently opened after several ministers suspected to be involved in legal cases. In same time, on 2 October 2023, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono met Joko Widodo, further opening speculation of incoming reshuffle.\nNasdem Party confirmed that Syahrul Yasin Limpo resigned as Minister of Agriculture on 5 October 2023 over corruption case. Istana Negara also confirmed the incoming reshuffle will be happened. On 6 October 2023, Arief Prasetyo Adi appointed as acting Minister of Agriculture. On 25 October 2023, Amran Sulaiman, Minister of Agriculture of Joko Widodo's previous administration recalled from his retirement and assumed the post again.\nTenth reshuffle\nOn 21 February 2024, Joko Widodo reshuffled his cabinet. In this occasion, Hadi Tjahjanto became Coordinating Minister of Political, Legal, and Security Affairs replacing Mahfud MD and Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono became Minister of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning/Head of National Land Agency replacing Hadi Tjahjanto.\nJoko Widodo said that he might reshuffle his cabinet again despite only having 8 months remaining in his presidency.\nThe tenth reshuffle further cemented Joko Widodo's political position in his remaining period of his presidency, with almost all parties in legislature except Prosperous Justice Party currently on his administration side. With the joining of Democratic Party to Joko Widodo side, for the first time since its formation, Democratic Party joined a PDI-P backed government. The joining of Democratic Party also showed Joko Widodo's separation from PDI-P's power and influence.\nEleventh reshuffle\nEleventh reshuffle happened on 18 July 2024. In this reshuffle, Deputy Ministers for Agriculture, Investment, and Finance were appointed. In this reshuffle, Thomas Djiwandono become Second Deputy Minister of Finance. Sudaryono become Deputy Minister of Agriculture replacing Harvick Hasnul Qolbi. Yuliot Tanjung become Deputy Minister of Investment.\nIn unusual move, Thomas Djiwandono, Prabowo's nephew and member of Prabowo's Presidential Transitional Team made into Deputy Minister of Finance. This is for the first time in Indonesia history, a part of transitional team of future administration entering outgoing administration for transitional purpose.\nTwelfth reshuffle\nOn 15 August 2024, Joko Widodo signed formation of two of Prabowo's future cabinet-level agencies, Presidential Communication Office (subsuming previous Presidential Spokesperson office and strategic communication section of Executive Office of the President of the Republic of Indonesia)  and National Nutrition Agency to facilitate Prabowo's free lunch program.\nOn 19 August 2024, Joko Widodo reshuffled the cabinet. More members of Prabowo's Presidential Transitional Team joined his cabinet. In this reshuffle, the Minister of Law and Human Rights, Minister of Investment, and Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources were replaced. A Deputy Minister, Second Deputy Minister of Communication and Information Technology, added. Two chiefs of future cabinet-level agencies of Prabowo, the Presidential Communication Office and National Nutrition Agency, were also appointed, activating them even before his administration started.\nThirteenth reshuffle\nOn 11 September 2024, Saifullah Yusuf replaced Tri Rismaharini as Minister of Social Affairs.\nSee also\n* Politics of Indonesia\nReferences"
