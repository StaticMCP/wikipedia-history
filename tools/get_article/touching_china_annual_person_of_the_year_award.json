The media and online platforms circulated criticisms such as \"He touched the Chinese people but couldn't touch CCTV?\" and \"It's easy to touch China, but hard to touch the judges.\" Notably, the article \"Bai Fangli, Why Did You Touch China?\"  gained widespread attention and was heavily shared online. In 2012, during the Touching China award, CCTV paid special tribute to Bai Fangli, referring to people like him, who were moving but had not received recognition, as \"the Bai Fanglis.\"\n* In early December 2010, Chen Baocheng, a journalist from Southern Metropolis Daily, posted on Weibo, claiming that the online voting for candidates, which started on December 1, showed signs of administrative manipulation, with certain candidates receiving a sudden surge in votes and an unusually concentrated distribution of votes in certain areas.\n* In 2020, China Digital Times reported that some netizens expressed their dissatisfaction with the exclusion of Dr. Li Wenliang from the Touching China Top 10. Many believed that Li Wenliang was the true \"Touching China\" figure for his early warnings about the COVID-19 outbreak and his subsequent death.\nReferences\n* Liu Shuwei\n* Zhang Ruimin\n* Zhang
