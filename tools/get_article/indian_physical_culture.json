Buddhist universities such as Nalanda taught various forms of physical culture, such as swimming and archery, with Buddha himself having been well-acquainted with martial activities prior to his enlightenment. Gurukulas focused significantly on physical education alongside academics, with Hindu epics such as the Ramayana often depicting kings marrying off their daughters to men who excelled in athletic events.\nA variety of ball games and war-training activities were present in ancient India, with both men and women participating. The traditional Indian physical culture generally used little to no equipment. Ayurvedic medical treatises such as the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita emphasized exercise as a way of avoiding conditions such as diabetes, and prescribed exercise in accordance with the seasons. Some specialist communities were known for their acrobatic performances, such as dancing on bamboo.\nHunting for recreation was common through Indian history, and was partaken in by royals; it was done for a variety of reasons, such as proving manliness, for religious purposes, or simply for thrill-seeking purposes. The emphasis on hunting coincided with an overall view of the forest as being an area to be conquered and used by the state, which resulted in conflict between kingdoms and forest-dwellers. Though Hindu scriptures warned against excessive hunting of animals, by the end of the colonial era, some animal species had been hunted to extinction, such as cheetahs. Other exercises done with animals included provoking intoxicated elephants for the purpose of building strength by maneuvering around them and escaping their wrath.\nMedieval era\nWrestling was common in Mughal India, with even the loser of a wrestling bout being awarded some money in order to avoid discouragement. Pehlwani emerged as a fusion of Persian and native Indian wrestling traditions during this time.\nColonial era\nwas a famous colonial-era strongman who helped counter British accusations of effeminacy among Indian men.]]\nDuring the colonial era, Indians felt emasculated by the British,  who had disarmed and demilitarized Indian society throughout the 19th century. The poverty and starvation of the era reduced Indians' ability to participate in physical exercise. Bengalis became particularly involved in seeking to combat British stereotypes of effeteness by pursuing physical culture and martial arts, with organizations such as the Hindu Mela contributing.\nInfluences from Western physical culture became prevalent in India, as mediated through influences from groups such as the YMCA, as Indians sought to benefit from the scientific nature and European nationalistic vigor present in Western schools of thought surrounding physical culture at the time. The British sought to impose their standards of physical discipline onto Indians, while discouraging traditional Indian games and negatively depicting Indian physiques. The British also used hunting as a way to establish imperial dominance and protect Indians from attacks by wild animals.\nIndians used victory in sport as a method of proving themselves against the colonizer. Indians also sought to standardize and revitalize their native physical culture during this time period, with institutions such as the akharas and vyayamshalas playing a role.\nContemporary era\nCricket, a British sport introduced into India during the colonial era, has emerged as a major aspect of modern-day India, with success in World Cups and the emergence of the Indian Premier League influencing society.\nIn 2023, cricket star MS Dhoni invested in a company called Tagda Raho (transl. \"stay strong\"), which is seeking to revive traditional Indian workouts and which has received significant interest from different groups in the cricket world.\nRelationship with various movements\nHindu nationalism\nThe Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has encouraged loyalty to India as a Hindu country in its followers through the practice of traditional Indian physical culture.\nMilitancy\nIn the colonial era, gyms and other physical culture institutions helped freedom fighters build their strength towards anti-colonial resistance. In the modern era, some communal violence has been linked to Hindu movements that use physical culture to become more organized and strong.\nInfluence on the world\nYoga and Indian clubs are among the most globally widespread elements of physical culture originating from India.\nCombat sports\nArchery\nWrestling\nPhysical exercises\nDand\nBaithak\nA baithak, also known as a Hindu squat or a deep knee bend on toes, is performed without additional weight and body weight placed on the forefeet and toes with the heels raised throughout; during the movement, the knees track far past the toes. The baithak was a staple exercise of ancient Indian wrestlers. It was also used by Bruce Lee in his training regime. It may also be performed with the hands resting on an upturned club or the back of a chair.\nYoga\nExercise equipment\nGada\nIndian club\nSee also\n* Sport in South Asia\nNotes\n: \"Many westerners see yoga as a variation on the modern concern for health and fitness and a means of overcoming the stresses and strains of modern day living. Most of what passes for yoga in this context, however, bears little relation to traditional practices, institutionalised as they were within established traditions or lienages (sampradaya) of teacher (guru) and pupil (śiṣya), structured according to hierarchical and initiatory stages of development and bound up with an ascetic lifestyle and world-view very different from the concerns of the modern western urbanite.\"}}\n, , ), which defines yoga as aiming to control (yoke) and still the mind (samadhi), recognizing (jnana) or isolating (kaivalya) the Purusha, the primordial witness-consciousness, from Prakriti, matter and mind (, ). Another classical definition (, , ), informed by the Bhagavad Gita  and Vedanta , describes the pupose of yoga as the union of the individual self (jivatman) with the higher Self (paramatman), Brahman, or God (Shiva).}}\n}}\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\nFurther reading\n*\n* [https://combatsportsedupl.publisherspanel.com/api/files/view/10545.pdf Kalaripayatt, kushti and the Indian warfare]"
