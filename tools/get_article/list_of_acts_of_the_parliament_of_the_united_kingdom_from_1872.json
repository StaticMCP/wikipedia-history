For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title.  Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n35 & 36 Vict.\nThe fourth session of the 20th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 6 February 1872 until 10 August 1872.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Bank of Ireland Charter Act 1872|public|5|23-04-1872|archived=n|An Act to amend the Charter under which the Bank of Ireland is incorporated.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  so far as respects a Vacancy in the office of Commissioner of Church Temporalities in Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n| or the Kidnapping Act 1872|public|19|27-06-1872|archived=n|An Act for the Prevention and Punishment of Criminal Outrages upon Natives of the Islands in the Pacific Ocean.}}\n|\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  or the Drainage and Improvement of Lands Amendment (Ireland) Act 1872|public|31|18-07-1872|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the several Acts relating to the Drainage and Improvement of Lands in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  so far as relates to the Purchase by Tenants of their holdings.}}\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Shortened Services Act 1872|public|35|18-07-1872|archived=n|An Act for the Amendment of the Act of Uniformity. }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Naturalisation Act 1872|public|39|25-07-1872|archived=n|An Act for amending the Law in certain cases in relation to Naturalization.}}\n| |note4= }}\n|  and 1871. }}\n|\n|  in respect of certain Provisional Orders.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  and on the Little Basses Rock, in the colony of Ceylon.}}\n|\n| or the Debtors (Ireland) Act 1872|public|57|06-08-1872|archived=n|An Act for the Abolition of Imprisonment for Debt in Ireland, and for the Punishment of fraudulent Debtors, and for other purposes relating thereto.}}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n| or the Corrupt Practice (Municipal Elections) Act 1872|public|60|06-08-1872|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for the better prevention of Corrupt Practices at Municipal Elections, and for establishing a Tribunal for the trial of the validity of such Elections.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n| or the Military Manoeuvres Act 1872|public|64|10-08-1872|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for making provision for facilitating the Manœuvres of Troops to be assembled during the ensuing Autumn.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Military Forces Localisation Act 1872|public|68|10-08-1872|archived=n|An Act to make provision for defraying the Expenses of Building Barracks and otherwise providing for the Localization of the Military Forces.}}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  to facilitate arrangements for the Relief of Turnpike Trusts.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| |note4= }}\n| or the Attorneys and Solicitors Act (1860) Amendment Act 1872|public|81|10-08-1872|archived=n|An Act to amend the Attorneys and Solicitors Act, 1860, by extending to Members of the Faculty of Advocates in Scotland the privileges conferred therein on Writers to the Signet, Solicitors before the Supreme Courts, and Procurators before the Sheriff Courts.}}\n|\n|  to Officers and Clerks of Telegraph Companies who are entitled to Annuities.|note4= }}\n| or the Appointment of Revising Barristers Act 1872|public|84|10-08-1872|archived=n|An Act to amend the Law relating to the appointment of Revising Barristers.}}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  providing Superannuation Allowances to Officers of Unions in Ireland.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n| or the Statute Law Revision (No. 2) Act 1872|public|97|10-08-1872|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for promoting the Revision of the Statute Law by repealing certain Enactments which have ceased to be in force or have become unnecessary.|note4= }}\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to Greshernish and Lynn Deeps.|po1=Greshernish Fishery Order 1872|\n|po2=Lynn Deeps Fishery Order 1872|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  to authorise agreements with the Cork, Blackrock, and Passage Railway Company and the Cork Harbour Commissioners;
