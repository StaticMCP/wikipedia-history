Although the trade periodicals like Film Daily and BoxOffice (magazine) occasionally listed the two-reel “Warner Specials” (actually Technicolor Specials and Broadway Brevities) as “featurettes”, the term usually applied to Warner shorts lasting a full half hour or longer.\nOverview\nA decade earlier, the studio cut down a Technicolor documentary, Pledge to Bataan, initially shown at 54 minutes in 1943, and released it as a 20 minute Technicolor Special on February 3, 1945. At the time, theater exhibitors preferred receiving their short films packaged by series.\nBy the 1950s, however, the success of Walt Disney and others with such series as the True-Life Adventures made the “extra length” short subject fashionable as a double bill presentation. The terms varied according to references, with a longer than usual Deep Adventure occasionally labeled a feature.\nTwo titles hosted by Jack Webb of Dragnet (series) fame, 24 Hour Alert and The John Glenn Story, were Academy Award nominees.\nAlso between 1958 and 1961, Warner Brothers produced four of The Bell Laboratory Science Series for television, but utilizing longtime short film director/writer Owen Crump.\nList of titles\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Title!!Major credits!!Running time!!Release, copyright or review date!!Notes\n|-\n|Black Fury || Ted & Vincent Saizis (directors); music: Howard Jackson & William Lava; narrators: John Brown & Marvin Miller || 32 minutes || September 9, 1953 ||  Profile of David Da Lie, naturalist and vet in Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia.\n|-\n|Production Report by Jack Warner || || 25 minutes || March 1955 || Technically a promotional\n|-\n|You in Italy || || about 40 minutes  || June 1955 || Made for the U.S. Signal Corps\n|-\n|24 Hour Alert || Mark VII co-production, Cedric Francis (producer); Robert Leeds (director); music: William Lava; hosted by Jack Webb & Art Balinger || 31 minutes || December 22, 1955 || Profiles jet operations with the US Air Force.
