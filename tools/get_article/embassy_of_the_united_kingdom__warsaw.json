It is located on Kawalerii street in the Ujazdów district. The current British Ambassador to Poland is Dame Melinda Simmons.\nHistory\nThe current embassy building on Kawalerii Street was built between 2008 and 2009, designed by Tony Fretton and cost £27m to construct. It is located next door to the Spanish and Dutch Embassies.\nDuring the interwar period (1918–1939), the embassy was located in the Branicki Palace. From 1945 until 2008, the embassy was located in the Wielopolski Palace at Ujazdów Avenue 15. The embassy building was designed by Jozef Huss and built c. 1875 as the home for Polish aristocrats. The building was relatively undamaged during World War II and therefore was acquired by the British government in 1945 to house the British Embassy; previously it had been used as the Estonian Embassy.\nGallery\nFile:Ns13DSC 0975.JPG|Embassy building used from 1925–1945\nFile:Roz1DSC 0999.JPG|Embassy building used from 1945–2008\nFile:Kawalerii Street in Warsaw DSC 1557.JPG|Embassy building used since 2008\nSee also\n*Poland–United Kingdom relations\n*List of diplomatic missions in Poland\n*List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Poland\nReferences"
