Situated outside Chattiwind Gate on Tarn Taran Road in Amritsar, the shrine marks the site where the last rites of Baba Deep Singh, the Jathedar of the first Damdami Taksal of the Sikhs, were performed.\nSignificance\nThis Gurdwara commemorates the unparalleled martyrdom of Baba Deep Singh Ji, a revered Sikh scholar and martyr, who fought bravely against Afghan forces to liberate the sanctity of Golden Temple (Sri Harmandir Sahib) in 1757. Despite sustaining mortal wounds, he continued to fight until reaching the precincts of the holy shrine, symbolizing unwavering faith and courage.\nConstruction\nThis Gurdwara was first built as a memorial by Jassa Singh Ramgarhia in memory of the sacrifice of Baba Deep Singh Ji.\nLater, in the 1920s, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) took over the management and developed the site into the Gurdwara complex visible in the present day.\nReferences"
