The manhua was illustrated by Lee Chi Ching and was released in 14 volumes between 1991 and 1999 by Culturecom Limited. It was also the first Hong Kong manhua to be published in cooperation with Japanese publishers.\nThree Kingdoms was followed by a sequel, Three Kingdoms: The Last Chapter (), also known as Sangokushi: Kanketsuhen in Japanese."
