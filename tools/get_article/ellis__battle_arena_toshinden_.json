Working with character designer Miho Furukawa, he then followed with developing certain character archetypes to provide a variety of physiques to the game, such as the \"big man\", the \"guru\", and the \"lolita\". As development progressed others added their own elements, such as programmers adding unique animations to characters to give them more visible personality, while one core person was assigned to each character to assist with the planning stage.\nThe character designs were finalized and drawn by Tsukasa Kotobuki, who also provided input on the development process. The game's publisher Takara initially sought to have Masami Obari for this role, but he was unable to due to obligations on another project and suggested Kotobuki instead. According to Battle Arena Toshinden URA director Norihiro Hayasaka, with the original game there was a noticeable discrepancy between the Kotobuki's artwork and the character models themselves, particularly in how he drew the female characters as slender with large breasts. Hayasaka pushed for the models to be closer to Kotobuki's art in terms of silhouette as a result, but also keep sharp edges to retain a style unique for Toshinden.\nDesign\nEllis stands 155 cm (5 ft 1 in) tall and has measurements of 82-54-80 cm (32-21-31 in).\nEarly designs for the character featured her with what the developers described as a more \"sexy\" and \"adult\" look, with her earliest designs featuring her having an exposed midsection and large breasts emphasized by a sash around them. In an interview with the staff of Famitsu, Kotobuki stated there were some disagreements between himself and the other developers regarding the character's outfit: he felt it should be a leotard with frills, while they wanted Ellis' outfit to consist of oversized clothing. The two combined their ideas, and as a result while her body is covered, the material on her legs and arms are rendered semi-transparent.\nAppearances\nEllis is a young woman introduced in the 1995 fighting game Battle Arena Toshinden, and is the deuteragonist of the series alongside fellow character Eiji Shinjo. Though her nationality is Turkish, she is of Japanese descent, and was taken in by a traveling circus troupe as a young orphan.\nShe additionally appears in Puzzle Arena Toshinden. Outside of video games, Ellis also appears in the two audio-only CD dramas that act as continuations of the game's story, and an OVA series based on the franchise. An additional, more comedic chapter titled 主役は誰なんだ編 (lit. \"Who is the Lead Role?\") was also released on cassette tape. In print media, anthology comic collections by various authors featuring the character were compiled in two separate books, one for the first and the other for the second game.\nIn English, her original voice actor for Toshinden and its remake Toshinden Remix was uncredited, while Lisa Ortiz voiced her appearance in the OVA. In Japanese, she has been voiced by Yōko Teppōzuka for most appearances, with Kyōko Hikami voicing her for the audio dramas and OVA. Meanwhile, a live action actress was used Battle Arena Toshinden 2s opening sequence and commercials related to the game. These appearances were performed by Japanese singer Asami Higashi, who additionally performed the character's image song for Takara.\nPromotion and merchandise\nTakara released a soundtrack for the first game Toshinden Retake & Remix which featured an additional track of Ellis' voice actress reading answering machine messages in character left for the listener. Meanwhile, models representing Ellis and fellow character Sofia were featured at promotional events for the game's release. For the OVA's release, several screening events were held across Japan, with Kyōko Hikami appearing in costume as Ellis. Hikami also sung as the character for the OVA's opening song, \"Cheer Up! Fly Away!\", which was later released as a standalone CD.\nFor merchandise of the character, Takara released two dolls, one in her default outfit and another in a Japanese schoolgirl uniform. Another doll was released in 1997, based off her appearance in Battle Arena Toshinden 2. Takara Amusement also produced smaller plush doll was produced for claw machines in Japan, as well as two varieties of character-themed clocks.\nCritical reception\nEllis was well received upon debut, particularly in Japan, with Takara game development head Nakano Takayuki stating that while they were displeased with Toshindens quality, the response to the character had been tremendous. She has been cited as a frequent subject of fan works, particularly cosplay, with a store in Japan selling replicas of her costume alongside those of other characters. In 1997, Japanese cosplay troupe 1999Quest released a fan-made VHS of actress Keiko Koyo dressed as the character fighting nondescript enemies, mimicking the character's moves. The PlayStation Magazine meanwhile ran a monthly section named \"Ellis's Private Room\", which discussed the character and encouraged readers to send fan art and cosplay.\nThe staff of Dengeki Online stated it would not be an exaggeration to consider her one of the most representative female heroines of the PlayStation console's earliest days. They additionally praised the transparent outfits of her outfit, something they had not seen in a game prior and was \"expressed beautifully in polygons\". Hayakawa Kiichiro of Magmix shared similar sentiments, expressing that her appearance in the game alone had caused him to buy a PlayStation when it was released. Others voiced similar praise, with Famitsu citing her outfit in the game one of the most surprising elements to see during the PlayStation's debut, while the staff of the Japanese Sega Saturn Magazine emphasized they had fallen in love with the design particularly in how it appeared in a black color scheme. Play magazine stated that while the transparent outfits helped cement her as a part of video game history, \"we remember her best because she was just so darn cute.\"\nVirtual Idol magazine ran a six page article examining and comparing Ellis and Sofia. The staff felt that their appeal arose from both how the Toshinden franchise had expanded their characters through supplemental media, but also how their 3D models made them viewable from every angle. They further appreciated how the two were polar opposites, praising how Ellis acted like a motherly figure for her troupe, something very unlike youth in Japan. Her outfits also received praised in how they reflected her character, feeling that the darker colors gave her a more mature air. Additional praise was given to how her outfit reflected her role as a member of a traveling circus troupe, and stated while the frills on her outfit could be seen as childish, other elements such as the transparent ones gave her a more adult appearance.\nAdditional praise went to the character's voice. Magmixs Kiichiro described her as \"the sort of character that makes cute noises\", and found Teppōzuka's voice work particularly memorable in this regard.  The staff of Famitsu went further to emphasize that her voice and youthful appearance worked well with Teppōzuka's portrayal, which they felt \"shot through the hearts of otakus\". Additional praise went to Kotobuki's design for her, finding his artwork captivating and that it made her particularly cute.\nReferences"
