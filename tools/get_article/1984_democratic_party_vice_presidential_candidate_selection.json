Former Vice President Walter Mondale won the 1984 Democratic nomination for president of the United States, and chose New York Representative Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate. Ferraro was the first woman to be a part of a national ticket for a major party. Mondale chose Ferraro in hopes of energizing the base and winning the votes of women, but also because he viewed her as a solid legislator who had won the approval of Speaker Tip O'Neill. If elected, she would have been the first female vice president but the feat would later be accomplished by Kamala Harris in 2020. The Mondale–Ferraro ticket ultimately lost to the Reagan–Bush ticket. Until 2024, this was the last time the Democratic vice presidential nominee was neither the incumbent vice president nor a senator.\nSpeculation\nOn December 10, 1983, the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus endorsed Mondale for president and Jesse Jackson for vice president.\nGeorge McGovern supported selecting Gary Hart as the vice presidential nominee.\nCecil Andrus, the co-chair of Mondale's presidential campaign, stated that he should pick a woman to serve as his running mate. He suggested Pat Schroeder, Geraldine Ferraro and Dianne Feinstein.\nSelection\nJohn R. Reilly, an attorney and a senior adviser to Mondale, managed the search for a running mate. Mondale seriously considered Hart, but Mondale refused to consider a second rival, Jesse Jackson, on the grounds that the differences between their policies were too great.\nMondale conducted interviews with Feinstein and Lloyd Bentsen. The National Organization for Women demanded that a woman be selected.\nFinalists\nFile:Tom Bradley (9501733131) (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Henry Cisneros (P15195).jpg|\nFile:Dianne Feinstein in her office, 1979 (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Geraldine Ferraro campaigning at Ft.
