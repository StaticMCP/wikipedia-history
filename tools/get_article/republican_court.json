It centered around social gatherings at the home of George and Martha Washington in Philadelphia, and more broadly among the various social elite of the city. As an informal political association, it provided an important avenue for women to participate in discourse on political philosophy and matters of state.\nThe political climate at the time was later memorialized by Rufus Wilmot Griswold in his work, The Republican Court or American Society in the Days of Washington, published in 1855.\nSee also\n* Political culture of the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://librarycompany.org/women/republicancourt/intro.htm Women of the Republican Court], from the Library Company of Philadelphia"
