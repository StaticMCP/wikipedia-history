At the time, the Colorado Party was the only legally permitted party. Alfredo Stroessner, who had led the coup, ran as the Colorado candidate in a special election for the remainder of Chávez' term, and was elected unopposed.\nThis was the first of Stroessner's eight consecutive election victories.\nResults\nReferences"
