They were endorsed by Samuel Train Dutton (1849–1919) for their numerous contributions in the promotion of peace. Henceforth, other couples began getting nominated for the prestigious Swedish prize whether jointly or separately in their respective fields. Aside from the following couples with verified nominations from the Nobel Committee, there are also other couples purportedly endorsed and whose nominations are yet to be verified since the archives are revealed 50 years after, among them are Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci-Şahin (for Medicine), John Q. Trojanowski and Virginia Man-Yee Lee (for Medicine), Patrick S. Moore and Yuan Chang-Moore (for Medicine), John Kappler and Philippa Marrack-Kappler (for Medicine), Jerome Karle}} and Isabella Lugoski Karle (for Chemistry), Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky-Pevear (for Literature), Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt (for Literature), Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates (for Peace), Amory Lovins and Hunter Sheldon-Lovins (for Peace), Ivan Suvanjieff and Dawn Engle-Suvanjieff (for Peace), and Søren Johansen and Katarina Juselius-Johansen (for Economics).\nNominees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Husband\n!colspan=\"2\"|Wife\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Motivation\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year(s) Nominated\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Sources\n|-\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!Portrait\n!Name\n|- id=\"Physiology or Medicine\"\n|colspan=7 align=center style=\"background:lightgray;white-space:nowrap\" | Physiology or Medicine\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Oskar Vogt (1870–1959)\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Cécile Vogt-Mugnier (1875–1962)\n|\"for their work concerning the anatomy and genetics of the brain (the architectonics of the cerebral cortex, cortex localization, function of corpus striatum, cerebral cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitectonics, diseases of the striatum system, aging of glial cells and their changes in schizophrenia).\"\n|1922, 1923, 1926, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1950, 1951, 1953\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|George Frederick Dick (1881–1967)\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Gladys Rowena Henry-Dick (1881–1963)\n|\"for their work on scarlet fever (the etiology, identification of scarlet fever streptococci by neutralization of the toxin with specific antitoxin, passive immunization and treatment with antitoxin, toxin test for susceptibility and active immunization).\"\n|1925, 1926, 1927, 1928, 1935\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Edward Mellanby (1884–1955)\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|May Tweedy-Mellanby (1882–1978)\n|\"for their work on the relation of dietary deficiencies to human diseases (rickets and the nervous conditions produced by lack of vitamin A, and dental structure and dental diseases).\"\n|1939\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|David Tillerson Smith (1898–1981)\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Susan Gower-Smith (1897–1983)\n|\"for their work on the use of nicotinic acid in the pellagra therapy.\"\n|1939\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|George Van Siclen Smith (1900–1984)\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Olive Watkins Smith (1901–1983)\n|\"for their investigation of a possible hormonal cause of toxemia of pregnancy.\n|1940\n|\n|- id=\"Physics\"\n|colspan=7 align=center style=\"background:lightgray;white-space:nowrap\" | Physics\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Geoffrey Ronald Burbidge (1925–2010)\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Margaret Peachey-Burbidge (1919–2020)\n|\"for their fundamental theory on stellar nucleosynthesis that most heavier chemical elements were formed through stellar evolution.\"\n|1964\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Pierre Connes (1928–2019)\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Janine Roux-Connes (b. 1934)\n|\"for their development of the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy method.\"\n|1970\n|\n|- id=\"Chemistry\"\n|colspan=7 align=center style=\"background:lightgray;white-space:nowrap\" | Chemistry\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Walter Noddack (1893–1960)\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Ida Tacke-Noddack (1896–1978)\n|\"for their discovery of the chemical elements technetium and rhenium.\"\n|1933, 1935, 1937\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Jacques Tréfouël (1897–1977)\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Thérèse Broyer-Tréfouël (1892–1978)\n|\"for their research on sulfanilamide, a novel class of antibiotic drug.\"\n|1950\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Bernard Pullman (1919–1996)\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Alberte Bucher-Pullman (1920–2011)\n|\"for their contributions to the application of quantum chemistry to predicting the carcinogenic properties of aromatic hydrocarbons.\"\n|1963, 1965, 1968, 1969\n|\n|- id=\"Literature\"\n|colspan=7 align=center style=\"background:lightgray;white-space:nowrap\" | Literature\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Jean Paul Sartre}} (1905–1980)\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Simone de Beauvoir (1908–1986)\n|align=\"center\"|J.
