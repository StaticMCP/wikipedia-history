Many mid- and high-rise apartment buildings which were built between 1900 and 1939 in New York and surrounding areas are considered \"pre-war\" and known for their spaciousness, hardwood flooring, detailing, and, in some cases, fireplaces. Quite often they are luxury rentals or co-op apartments.\nExamples\n*620 Park Avenue\n*655 Park Avenue\n*740 Park Avenue\n*834 Fifth Avenue\n*The Beresford\n*444 East 58th Street\nSee also\n*Antebellum architecture\nReferences"
