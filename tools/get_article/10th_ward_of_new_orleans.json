The 10th Ward is one of the 17 wards of New Orleans. The ward is one of the city's Uptown wards, formerly the old Faubourg Lafayette annexed by New Orleans in the 1850s.\nBoundaries\nThe 10th Ward stretches back from the Mississippi River to St. Charles Avenue, across which is the 3rd Ward. The lower boundary is Calliope Street, across which is the 1st Ward of New Orleans (better known as warehouse district). The upper boundary is Jackson Avenue, across which lies the 11th Ward.\nCityscape and landmarks\nNear the river the ward includes part of the Lower Garden District and the former location of America's first experiment with large-scale public housing, started here in 1937, when, as part of the New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the loan to commence construction of the former St. Thomas Housing Project. Further back from the Mississippi River, the Ward includes the Faubourg Lafayette neighborhood, part of Central City; this area includes the Oretha Castle Haley commercial district.\nResidents\nThe 10th Ward has been home to such notables as jazz musicians Buddy Bolden and George Brunies\nHistory\nIn 1718, the City of New Orleans was established.  Faubourg Lafayette is one of the first of many neighborhoods of New Orleans, Faubourg is the French word for a subdivision. Faubourg Lafayette was originally the Panis Plantation land before subdivision and eventually becoming part of the City of Lafayette, a subdivision of Jefferson Parish. The area was united by an act of legislation between the City of Lafayette and the City of New Orleans prior to being classified as a subdivision of New Orleans. Many other neighborhoods like Faubourg Nuns, originally the Ursulines Nuns Plantation, subdivided in 1810 by Barthelemy Lafon, and in 1818 the subdiviaion of Faubourg Delassize were also to become a part of the City of Lafayette (not to be confused with the city of Lafayette in Lafayette Parish Louisiana) prior to this consolidation. Eventually the cities of Carrollton and Jefferson would be annexed by the city of New Orleans.\nIn 1818, Faubourg Lafayette was bought as a neighborhood and became a subdivision in 1824. In its newborn years as a city, it was cut into blocks and squares by John Poultney. Poultney acquired this neighborhood from Madame Rousseau, who like Samuel Herman bought his neighborhood from the heirs of Valery Delaissize. Both of these neighborhoods started as plantations, but the new owners decided to downsize them in order to make more living space available for the growing population.\nIn 1796,  Bertrand Gravier helped enlarge Faubourg by including Phillipa St., which is now called Poydres Street. Years later, in 1897, when Gravier died, his brother, Jean Gravier, was appointed to be the new owner of this prosperous estate. He continued in his brother's footsteps by further extending the Faubourg to Circus Street, which is currently known as Rampart Street. As Jean Gravier continued to expand the Faubourg region, he included land that was located near Poydras St., and land approximately 40 feet in width, for a canal.  In addition, to these expansions, Jean Gravier also designated a tract for a basin that linked to Canal St. During this time, the basin was an uninhabited district of land  which was allocated for the community. He later called this Basin “Place Gravier”.\nJean Gravier didn't realize that the canal and Place Gravier would become the basis of a dispute between the City of New Orleans and the Carrollton Railroad Company. At this time, the Carrollton Railroad company possessed the canal, the basin, and asserted ownership of segments of Place Gravier.  The dispute between the City of New Orleans, and the railroad company concluded when the Supreme Court of the Territory of Orleans announced a judgement in support of Jean Gravier, on May 23, 1805.\nLater in 1841, the Louisiana Supreme Court, pronounced that the Canal and Basin were property of to the Railroad Company. However, years later in 1876, the Supreme Court altered their judgement and decided that the “Place Gravier” would be owned by the City of New Orleans and be a location for the general public. In 1897, the City of New Orleans took legal action against Philip Werlien for possession of this basin. This location was declared to be public property as stated by the judgment the Supreme Court announced in 1841. The City of New Orleans won the lawsuit against Werlien and the Supreme Court of the state of Louisiana. Werlein took the litigation to the Supreme Court of the United States and it rendered a judgment in support of him. The Supreme Court of the United States reasoned that the City of New Orleans had lost ownership of Place Gravier. Philip Werlien was able to obtain possession of this disputed property, which is now the site of the Hotel de Sotoe.\nFaubourg Lafayette is distinctive in its perimeters because of its unique history from vast contributors. Faubourg Lafayette is part of the upper section of New Orleans. The perimeters of Faubourg Lafayette are Saint Charles Street, Calliope Street, Jackson Avenue, and Simon Bolivar Avenue. This area is known for its diverse mixture of businesses, personal homes, schools, and many main attractions for tourist.\nReferences"
