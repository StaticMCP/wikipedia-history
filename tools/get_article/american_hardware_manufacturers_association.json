After years of dwindling membership, the AHMA dissolved in 2017.\nAny international firm or corporation engaged in the manufacture or marketing of products for the hardware channel was eligible to become a non-voting associate member. Manufacturers' agents and industry trade publications could also join as non-voting associate members.\nAHMA served the hardlines industry in many ways, including cost savings and educational programs. The association provided industry conferences, events and workshops; legislative representation in Washington; domestic and international marketing support; technology initiatives; cost-saving programs; targeted publications; networking opportunities; and many other industry-directed services.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ahma.ORG Official AHMA website]\n* [https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20100106457 AMERICAN HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION vs. REED ELSEVIER, INC.]"
