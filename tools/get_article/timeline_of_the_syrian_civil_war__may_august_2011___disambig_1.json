Security forces had reportedly withdrawn from the city, situated on the Iraqi border. Additionally, five protesters were injured in the town of Zabadani on the border with Lebanon after security forces fired on protesters. Thirty thousand protesters were rumoured to be in the town of Rastan, chanting anti-Assad slogans.

Human Rights Watch – who called on the government to investigate the case – stated that a Syrian researcher with their organisation had spoken to a relative who asserted that the boy had been taken into custody on 29 April during an anti-government march. A month later, his body was returned to the family for burial, allegedly riddled with bullets; his kneecaps, jaw, and neck broken; and his genitals mutilated. Various media sources pointed to a Facebook page in honor of the boy, as well as Twitter and blog posts from activists, in suggesting that the story emerging about the boy had reinvigorated calls for protest and \"could galvanize the country's troubled protest movement\", drawing comparisons with Khaled Saeed in the Egyptian Revolution. Significant protests followed in Hama, Darayya, and, for the first time, Aleppo, with thousands chanting Hamza's name. A doctor invited to appear on pro-government television station al-Dunya claimed that the injuries were not consistent with torture and could have been faked.

Tens of thousands protested in other cities as well, the Kurdish Northeast, Daraa, the Syrian coast, Aleppo and Homs. The Syrian army was sent into the central area of Damascus where they conducted arrests and prevented anyone from rallying. A total of 8 people were killed by the Syrian army most of them in Aleppo on Friday.\n23 July\nMany demonstrations took place in front of Syrian embassies abroad to denounce the suppression of peaceful protesters by the authorities.\n26 July\nAs protests continued, the Syrian army raided the Damascus suburb of Kanakir with tanks, killing 8 civilians. The security forces arrested at least 250 people, all in an attempt to subdue opposition in Damascus before Ramadan occurs, when the protests are expected to intensify further.\n28 July\nSecurity forces swept through Damascus's neighborhoods again, killing four people and conducting mass arrests. Activists called for mass Friday protests under the name of \"Your Silence is Killing Us\" in an attempt to encourage the silent majority of Syria's population to take sides with the anti-Assad demonstrators.\n29 July – \"Friday of 'Your Silence Is Killing Us'\"\nMassive protests ensued as security forces unleashed expansive crackdowns. 20 protesters were killed throughout Syria, most notably in Deir ez-Zor, where the government tried to stop mass gatherings. The Syrian army was sent into the city with tanks and fired on protesters with live ammunition, while Daraa and Latakia also witnessed protester deaths. Other places where protesting occurred included Hama, Homs, Qamishli, and Aleppo. The Syrian army conducted mass arrests in the capital, Damascus. The Syrian army's brutal response was one of heaviest since June. A colonel in the Syrian Army claimed he had defected to the opposition along with \"hundreds\" of other military personnel in the city of Deir ez-Zor, and called his group the Free Syrian Army. The largest protest of the uprising occurred on this day in Hama's Asi Square, with nearly 1 million participating,\n31 July\nOn what appeared to be the bloodiest day of the uprising to date, at least 136 were killed across the country as Syrian tanks, snipers, and troops stormed Deir ez-Zor, Hama, Harak, and Abu Kamal. The crackdown was an apparent effort to halt the momentum of the protest movement before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The Syrian government claimed its military actions were in response to armed gangs attacking buildings and forcing people to protest, allegations rejected by protesters and American diplomats inside the country.\nAugust 2011\n3 August\nFollowing increased violence in the preceding days, the United Nations Security Council for the first time condemned the human rights violations against the Syrian protesters. 45 people were killed in Hama on 3 August.\n4 August\nAssad issued a decree authorizing the formation of multiple political parties in Syria, as well as election reforms aimed at pleasing protesters. Even as he did this, the Hama crackdown intensified, leaving now over 200 dead in Hama since 31 July. Hama is now enduring a widespread power outage as well as a blockade of basic food and medical supplies. The Syrian opposition intends for another Friday of mass protests dubbed \"The Friday of God is with Us\".\n5 August – \"Friday of 'God is With Us'\"\nMass protests occurred for Friday protests, including 30,000 in Deir Ezzour. Hama was totally suppressed, making it difficult for people to rally there. Citizens in Qamishli, Aleppo, Deraa, Homs, suburban and central Damascus went out to protest in solidarity with Hama. 24 civilians were killed by security forces, including 5 in Damascus.\n6 August\nThe Syrian army entered Homs and Deir Ezzour with tanks in an attempt to stop people from rallying. Turkey said it would send its foreign minister to Damascus to present the Turkish government's demands for an end to the crackdown, while the Gulf Co-operation Council condemned the violence in a joint statement by GCC member states. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also condemned the violence.\n7 August\nOver 70 people were killed in Syria, according to local human rights groups. Over 50 were killed in Deir Ezzour alone. Dozens were arrested, and use of mortars and tanks to shell neighborhoods was also reported. The Arab League condemned the actions of the Syrian government for the first time.\n8 August\nJust after midnight, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia gave a televised address condemning the Syrian government over the crackdown. The king also said Saudi Arabia was recalling its ambassador to Syria. He warned Assad to enact major reforms or else Syria \"will be pulled down into the depths of turmoil and loss\". Kuwait and later Bahrain also recalled their ambassadors and said a GCC summit would be held soon to determine a unified course of action for responding to the events in Syria. A mother and her two children were killed in Deir ez-Zor by Syrian troops storming the city during the predawn adhān, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The attack on Deir ez-Zor reportedly continued until noon. Soldiers also entered Maarat an-Numan in northern Syria from the east and quickly cordoned off the city, preventing anyone from entering or exiting, a local opposition committee said in a statement. Seven people attending a funeral in Daraa were also reported killed when security forces attacked the procession, leaving dozens more injured. The deadly incident prompted late-night protests in the city, with demonstrators saying they held police responsible for the violence. The head of the Arab Organization for Human Rights claimed 24 people were killed throughout the country during the day, while UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Oscar Fernandez-Taranco said 87 civilians were killed by Syrian forces. The online group Anonymous defaced the Syrian Ministry of Defense website with a message urging members of the Syrian Army to defect and expressing solidarity with the protesters. President Assad sacked Defense Minister Ali Habib Mahmud and replaced him with General Dawoud Rajiha, the Syrian Army's chief of staff, due to Ali Habib Mahmud's declining health.\n9 August\nAn opposition group reported Syrian forces were attacking Sarmin, a town in Idlib Governorate, at dawn from three sides, conducting raids and arresting residents. Tanks were said to be deployed in and around Idlib, the provincial capital. The siege of Deir ez-Zor continued, with tank shelling reported in the al-Hawiqa district, and at least 15 deaths were reported in the city, along with two more elsewhere in Idlib Governorate. There were also sketchy reports of military operations near Al-Bu-Kamal, close to the Iraqi border. Five were reported killed in Hama, including two children from the same family. Syrian troops also assaulted Binnish in an apparent reprisal for large-scale \"night rallies after Ramadan prayers\", according to a local resident, leaving four villagers reported dead.\nOpposition websites claimed that former Syrian defense minister Ali Habib Mahmud was found dead in his home. A spokesman for the Syrian government initially claimed he had died of \"a disease\", while the opposition accused the Syrian government of executing him. According to the opposition, Ali Habib started refusing to send in the army into cities because he feared increasing defections, and for that he was killed. However, he appeared on Syrian state TV hours after his supposed death to deny that he was fired or killed, saying he resigned due to illness.\nTurkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu met with President Bashar al-Assad for over two hours and spoke with other Syrian officials for four more hours in total before departing Syria without making a statement. Assad reportedly told Davutoğlu during the meeting that his government \"will not relent in pursuing the terrorist groups in order to protect the stability of the country and the security of the citizens\" but said he was still committed to making reforms. Upon returning to Turkey, Davutoğlu said his government will continue relations with Damascus, but said he had urged Assad to take \"concrete steps\" to end the violence without answering whether Assad had agreed to do so. Meanwhile, Egypt sharply criticized the Syrian government for promising reforms while continuing violence, with Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr calling such reforms \"of no use\". Amr demanded an end to the crackdown and said Assad and the Syrian populace should engage in a comprehensive national dialogue.\nIn a retaliatory cyberattack for the hacking of the Ministry of Defence website, a website set up by Anonymous was hacked by supporters of the Syrian government, who placed photos of burned bodies and a message claiming the victims were Syrian soldiers and civilians killed by members of the Muslim Brotherhood on the page.\n10 August\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed one dead and 13 wounded by army operations, backed by one dozen armoured vehicles, in the northwestern towns of Sarmin and Taftanaz. Meanwhile, the military appeared to conclude the siege of Hama, withdrawing 40 APCs loaded with cheering soldiers from the city centre, according to a journalist on a government-organised tour. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan lauded the withdrawal and media access, both of which Davutoğlu had urged the previous day, as \"a sign that our initiative is producing results\". However, later in the day the Syrian government decided to put tanks back into Hama, and canceled the withdrawal. The government also announced its withdrawal from Ariha. Seventeen people were killed and 20 more injured by Syrian troops in Homs after the army opened fire on protesters, activists told the Agence France-Presse by telephone.\nSyrian Ambassador to the United Nations Bashar Jaafari compared the situation in Syria to the ongoing English riots and said that just as in the United Kingdom and other countries, the Syrian government was democratically elected and not a \"regime\". The UK's representative sharply rebuked Jaafari's argument, saying, \"In Syria, you have a situation where thousands of unarmed civilians are being attacked and many of them killed. That comparison made by the Syrian ambassador is ludicrous.\"\nIn a step The New York Times deemed previously unthinkable, 41 former Ba'ath and current government officials announced an initiative for political transition, and urged an end to the military crackdown on protestors. They were led by Mohammed Salman, a former minister of information with intimate ties to the Assads.\n11 August\nA resident of Saraqeb, a town near the Turkish border, reported that over 60 vehicles, about 14 of which were reportedly tanks or APCs, entered the town. According to the report, Syrian soldiers began firing randomly and detaining residents en masse. The opposition Local Coordination Committees corroborated the report. In Qusayr in Homs Governorate, eleven people were reported killed as the army stormed the town. Two more residents of Hama were killed, according to Avaaz. The town of al-Musayfrah in Daraa governorate was the site of military operations at dawn. The army also shelled at least two neighbourhoods in Deir ez-Zour, Avaaz reported.\nMore mass Friday protests are planned by the Syrian opposition, this time under the title \"Friday of 'We will not bow except for God'\".\n12 August – \"Friday of 'We Won't Kneel Except to God'\"\nMass protests continued as twenty-three people were reportedly killed by Syrian forces across the country, including five in Saqba and Douma, suburbs of Damascus, when security forces fired on protesters shortly before Friday prayers. Troops killed protesters in Daraa, Deir ez-Zour, Idlib, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and elsewhere, according to activists. They also allegedly fired on demonstrators in the Midan district of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees reported from Aleppo that shabiha, or plainclothes pro-government militiamen, beat and stabbed dozens of people at a hundreds-strong protest in Syria's largest city. A similar scene played out in Zabadani, residents claimed, where shooting at a local mosque was also reported. Despite a security clampdown on the city of Homs, close to 20,000 people reportedly protested there after prayers.\n13 August\nThe Syrian army entered Latakia with more than 20 tanks and APCs and killed at least two civilians, according to activists. Activists in Deir ez-Zour also said a child was killed by a sniper. The Hürriyet Daily News, a Turkish daily, reported that a senior Turkish government official speaking on the condition of anonymity said a military intervention in Syria led by Turkey was an option. The report suggested Ankara is nervous over sectarian tension in Syria inflaming an already unstable situation in neighboring Iraq, which also experienced protests as part of the Arab Spring revolutionary wave. The LCC also reported a death in Qusayr, a death in Daraya, and a death in Hama.\n14 August\nThe LCC said that even as the army's artillery assault continued, the Syrian Navy was firing on Latakia with gunboats off the Mediterranean coast, killing at least 28, according to the Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union. Eight more civilians were killed elsewhere in the country, bringing the day's death toll to a minimum of 36, human rights activists and pro-democracy campaigners said. Syrian state news claimed two police and six armed criminals were killed in Latakia.\n15 August\nFour to six more civilians were reportedly killed in Latakia as the siege dragged on. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu demanded that the Syrian government's violent crackdown end \"immediately and without conditions or excuses ... [or] there would be nothing more to discuss about steps that would be taken\". In Houleh, an elderly man was shot dead by a sniper as the army began operations in the town, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed. Germany called on the European Union to take stronger action against the Assad administration by strengthening sanctions. A Palestinian refugee camp was among the targets of the shelling, residents, activists, and the UNRWA reported, drawing sharp condemnation from the Palestine Liberation Organization, among other groups. Twelve people were killed in Homs after post-iftar protests, Al Jazeera reported citing unnamed sources.\n16 August\nAvaaz said it could confirm nine people in Latakia were killed during the day, Al Jazeera reported. Residents reported looting by shabiha in the al-Ramel neighborhood, where the Palestinian refugee camp is situated, as well as clearing of dead bodies, bullet casings, and other signs of shooting, and said thousands of people were trying to flee but many were being detained or forced to remain in the city. One resident said he feared his neighborhood would be razed to the ground. The Turkish government denied it had plans to create a border buffer zone, but said it was drafting plans for its next course of action if the crackdown continued. Nighttime protests were held in Homs, Albu Kamal, and several suburbs of Damascus, among other places in Syria, in defiance of the security operations.\n17 August\nThe Syrian government claimed it withdrew from Latakia and Deir ez-Zor, but Davutoğlu disputed this, saying Syrian troops remained in Deir ez-Zor and other centres of protest. He again reiterated Turkey's stance that \"the bloodshed has to stop\" and warned that \"Turkey can naturally not remain indifferent\" if the crackdown continued. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan compared the situation to the civil war in Libya and vented his frustration with the Syrian government, saying, \"I've sent my foreign minister, and personally got in touch many times, the last of them three days ago on the phone. In spite of all this, civilians are still getting killed.\" The post-revolutionary interim government of Tunisia withdrew its ambassador from Damascus for \"consultations\". The United Nations reported that in a phone conversation with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Assad claimed that all police and military operations against protesters had stopped. Despite Assad's assertion, activists reported between 9 and 16 deaths of protesters in Homs and said most of the shooting took place after evening prayers. Al Arabiya reported that \"thousands\" protested in a central square (Saadallah al-Jabiri square) of Aleppo, the city's largest demonstration to date, as well as various neighbourhoods of the city, before security forces attacked the people gathered there.\n18 August\nThe governments of Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States all called for Assad to resign for the first time.

The LCC reported continuing arrests and army activities in Deir ez-Zor, but did not report shooting. In a report documenting the uprising up until 14 July, the United Nations found that the Syrian government may have committed crimes against humanity and had practiced such tactics as summary execution, torture, use of indiscriminate force against civilians, and arbitrary arrests.\nNew massive protests are planned for Friday, this time under the title Friday of Beginnings of Victory.\n19 August – \"Friday of Beginnings of Victory\"\nAt least 23 people were allegedly killed across Syria, with 15 killed in Daraa Governorate, two killed in Douma and Harasta, and six killed in Homs. Six of the dead were killed when security forces stormed a village mosque in Inkhil, opposition activists claimed. About 6,000 people in Qadam, a Damascus suburb, reportedly chanted for President Assad to be tried at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Security forces attempted to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, but when this failed, they opened fire with live ammunition, wounding at least five, activists and witnesses claimed. Lady Catherine Ashton, the European Union's head of foreign affairs, said the EU was making preparations for an embargo on Syrian oil. The Russian government dissented from the tougher stance adopted by the EU and many Western countries, with leading figures saying Assad \"needs more time\" to deliver on promised reforms.\n20 August\nThe death toll from the previous day rose to 34, and the Syrian army renewed a siege on Homs with army tanks, firing at the local population to keep them from rallying.\n21 August\nIn a media interview, Assad claimed he wanted to pursue reforms and pursue \"terrorists\".

Shortly after its departure, security forces reportedly opened fire on demonstrators in the city, leaving at least four dead, Human Rights Watch said.\n23 August\nIn Istanbul, Turkey, the National Council of Syria was announced to \"represent the concerns and demands of the Syrian people\". In Geneva, Switzerland, the United Nations Human Rights Council voted to condemn the Syrian government over its response to the uprising. At least 12 were killed in Idlib, Hama, and Homs governorates, the Arab Organization for Human Rights claimed.\n24 August\nDespite the National Council's stated purpose in uniting all Syrian opposition groups, a Syrian Turkmen opposition activist complained that his community was marginalised and said he and other Syrian Turks were not invited to the council's formation, and then were accorded only observer status upon attending. A European Union official said the EU would likely place an embargo on Syrian oil within ten days. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that a woman was tortured to death in western Syria, while Al Jazeera reported that three civilians died amid raids in Homs, one protester was killed by snipers overnight in Nessieb, and five people were killed in an agricultural area outside Hama.

The identity of his attackers was unclear, with some attributing the beating to Syrian security forces. Some reports said both his hands were broken as a \"warning\" to dissuade him from drawing. Residents near Latakia and in Deir ez-Zor said they heard gunfire near their homes, the head of the Arab Organization for Human Rights claimed. The LCC said tanks again shelled Deir ez-Zor throughout the day, and at least 118 tanks were reported to be in Shuhail to the city's immediate southeast. The state-controlled Syrian Arab News Agency reported eight soldiers, including an army officer, were ambushed and killed in two separate attacks by \"armed terrorist groups\" in Homs Governorate the previous afternoon. The report said at least seven soldiers were wounded in one of the attacks when \"terrorists\" shot at a military bus in Talbisah. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad offered a measured criticism of the Syrian government for the first time, calling for a national dialogue in a televised interview and saying, \"When there is a problem between the people and their leaders, they must sit down together to reach a solution, away from violence.\" The Syrian opposition prepared to launch new Friday mass protests, this time dubbed under the name '\"Friday of Patience and Steadfastness'\".\n26 August – \"Friday of Patience and Steadfastness\"\nOn the last Friday of Ramadan, thousands protested in several Syrian cities, including Damascus, Deir ez-Zor, Deraa, Douma, Hama, Homs, and towns in Idlib Governorate, and security forces responded to many anti-government rallies with live fire and tear gas. 8 protesters were killed overnight when security forces attacked street demonstrations, activists said.

Multiple witnesses reported that a mosque was stormed in Kafarsouseh, a Damascus suburb, and thousands protested there against the government, though a crowd of government supporters turned out to chant slogans in support of Assad. Several protesters, as well as the mosque's 80-year-old imam, were reportedly injured. Security forces used live fire and tear gas against demonstrators in a square adjacent to the mosque, wounding at least five. Hundreds more protested in Moadamiya, another suburb, and in the Damascene neighbourhood of Tijana. A planned protest in Abaseen Square was largely thwarted, though about 60 protesters managed to march into the square before being dispersed. More protesters from Douma marched toward central Damascus, though protesters in the suburb of Saqba met live fire from security forces, leaving at least one dead, activists claimed.

Two protesters were killed in Latakia and Qusayr, activists said.\n28 August\nLondon-based daily As-Sharq al-Awsat reported that Mohammad Rahhal, the leader of the LCC's Revolutionary Council, said the council had concluded that \"what we are being subjected to today is a global conspiracy that can only be faced by an armed uprising\". He said the council was now working to distribute weapons to protesters in order to combat the government's security crackdown. He criticised the international response to the Syrian uprising, saying, \"Confronting this monster [the Syrian government] now requires arms, especially after it has become clear to everyone that the world only supports the Syrian uprising through speeches.\" He predicted the protest movement \"will turn violent very soon\". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported five protesters were killed, including two who succumbed to mortal injuries from the previous day, and at least nine more were wounded.
