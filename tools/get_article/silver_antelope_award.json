Since 2022 award has been presented for service to a Council Service Territory.\nRecipients must be a registered adult member of Scouting America. Scouters may be nominated and selected for their efforts in the Council Service Territory or for service to the territory through a national committee. The award is approved and issued by the National Court of Honor.\nAward\nThe award consists of a silver antelope suspended from a white and orange ribbon worn around the neck. Recipients may wear the corresponding square knot, with a white strand over an orange strand, on the Scouting America uniform.\nHistory\nThe award was created in 1942 and first issued in 1943.  An orange-white-orange ribbon bar was used for informal uniform wear until 1946, when ribbon bars were replaced by the current square knot insignia. Using the United States Military as the model, silver awards are the highest awards in Scouting America.\nFrom 1942 to 2021, the Silver Antelope recognized service within one of the geographical regions of Scouting America. Beginning in 2022, after the administrative reorganization of Scouting America, it is presented for service in a Council Service Territory.\nFrom the first awards in 1943 through 2025, there have been only 3,329 recipients of the Silver Antelope. Famous recipients include General William C. Westmoreland (1969), Ernie Banks (1969), Philip M. Condit, CEO of Boeing (2007), Ross Perot (1974), Admiral Arleigh Burke (1964), Sanford McDonnell, CEO of McDonnell Douglas (1983), and several state governors.\nSee also\n* List of recipients of the Silver Antelope Award\nReferences"
