In February 1952 a new 3rd Destroyer Squadron was activated. The Admiralty controlled global deployment until 1964, when that department was abolished and replaced by the Navy Department, Ministry of Defence. Geographic commands usually consisted of fleets, squadrons, flotillas, and single ships. In 1954, major re-structuring of the navy was undertaken, leading to downsizing of administrative requirements.  Warships were then rotated between the various fleets and stations. From 1954 until 1971, many naval commands were abolished or amalgamated into larger commands. In November 1971, nearly all British naval forces were brought under the command of a single fleet at Northwood Headquarters. under the control of Commander-in-Chief Fleet. In 2012 that post was abolished and replaced by the Fleet Commander, who administered the fleet from Navy Command Headquarters in Portsmouth, Hampshire.\nOrganizational changes\nNote: Command structure organizational changes took place within Royal Navy post war period the term Flotilla was previously applied to a tactical unit until 1951 which led to the creation of three specific Flag Officers, Flotillas responsible for the Eastern, Home and Mediterranean fleets the existing destroyer flotillas were re-organized now as administrative squadrons.\nOperational history\nDeployments included:\n* Assigned to Mediterranean Fleet - (1952-1956)\n* Assigned to Home Fleet - (1956-1958)\n* Assigned to First Flotilla, Fleet (1980- 1995)\n* Assigned to the Fleet - (1996-2002)\nNotes:Revived as 3rd Far East Destroyer Squadron, (January 1967-January 1972)\nComposition\nIncluded:\n, Mediterranean Fleet 1952\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Saintes (Leader)\n* HMS Armada\n* HMS Gravelines\n* HMS Vigo\n, Mediterranean Fleet 1953\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Saintes (Leader)\n* HMS Armada\n* HMS Gravelines\n* HMS Vigo - (July 1953)\n*  - (July 1953)\n* HMS St. Kitts - (November 1953)\n, Mediterranean Fleet 1954\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Saintes (Leader)\n*\n* HMS St. Kitts\n, Mediterranean Fleet 1954-1956\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Saintes (Leader)\n* HMS Armada (Leader)\n* HMS Barfleur\n* HMS St. Kitts\n, Home Fleet 1956\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Armada (Leader)\n* HMS Barfleur\n* HMS St. Kitts\n, Home Fleet 1957\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Armada (Leader)\n* HMS Barfleur\n* HMS St. Kitts\n, Home Fleet 1958\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Armada (Leader)\n* HMS Barfleur\n*\n, First Flotilla, Fleet 1980-1995\n3rd Destroyer Squadron, Portsmouth & Rosyth\n*  (Leader)\n*  (Leader)\n*  (Leader)\n*  - (Leader)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n, The Fleet 1996\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Liverpool - (Leader)\n* HMS Birmingham - (December 1999)\n* HMS Glasgow\n* HMS Nottingham\n* HMS York\n* HMS Edinburgh\n, The Fleet 1997\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Liverpool - (Leader)\n* HMS Birmingham - (December 1999)\n* HMS Glasgow\n* HMS Nottingham\n* HMS York\n* HMS Edinburgh\n, The Fleet 1998\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Liverpool - (Leader)\n* HMS Birmingham - (December 1999)\n* HMS Glasgow\n* HMS Nottingham\n* HMS York\n* HMS Edinburgh\n, The Fleet 1999\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Liverpool - (Leader)\n* HMS Birmingham - (December 1999)\n* HMS Glasgow\n* HMS Nottingham\n* HMS York\n* HMS Edinburgh\n, The Fleet 2000\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Edinburgh - (Leader)\n* HMS Glasgow\n* HMS Liverpool - (Lead ship)\n* HMS Nottingham\n* HMS York\n, The Fleet 2001-2002\n3rd Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Edinburgh - (Leader)\n* HMS Glasgow\n* HMS Liverpool\n* HMS Nottingham\n* HMS York\nSquadron commander\nIncluded:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
