The alliance founding members bring together Europe's civil society organisations, historic cities and villages, museums, heritage professionals and volunteers, (private) owners of collections of artefacts, historic buildings and cultural landscapes, educators, town planners, etc. The \"European Heritage Alliance 3.3\" thus represents a very large constituency composed of tens of millions of Europe's citizens. Europa Nostra is acting as facilitator of the alliance.\nThe name of this alliance refers to the article 3.3. of the consolidated version of the Lisbon Treaty of the European Union which stipulates that ''\"[The Union] shall respect its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, and shall ensure that Europe's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced.\"''\nIt contributed to the preparation of the European Commission communication \"Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe\" published in July 2014.\nMembers\nThe members of the European Heritage Alliance 3.3 are:\n#\n# [http://www.accr-europe.org/ ACCR] (Association des Centres Culturels de Rencontres)\n# [http://www.aeerpa.eu/ AEERPA] (European Association of Architectural Heritage Restoration Companies)\n# [https://web.archive.org/web/20131222202228/http://www.ancbs.org/cms/index.php/en ANCBS] (Association of National Committees of the Blue Shield)\n# [http://www.civilscape.eu/civilscape/content/en/articles/index-teaser.php CIVILSCAPE] (CIVILSCAPE – we are the landscape people!)\n# E.C.C.O.
