      "text": "# USBC Queens\n\nThe USBC Queens is an annual ten-pin bowling event for amateur and professional female bowlers, sanctioned by the United States Bowling Congress. The event is one of four women's professional majors since the PWBA tour returned in 2015 and the female equivalent of the USBC Masters, now one of the four majors on the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour.\nThe format for the USBC Queens tournament is similar to the USBC Masters.  All entrants bowl 15 games of qualifying over three days. The top 63 qualifiers plus the previous year's champion are then seeded for match play. Match play consists of three-game, total-pinfall matches in a double-elimination format. First-time losers during the match play rounds are not eliminated, but are instead placed into an elimination bracket, where they must survive all subsequent three-game matches to have a chance at making the championship finals. The last five remaining players with either one or zero match play losses are seeded for the televised finals, which is a single-game stepladder format.\nUSBC Queens history\nThe USBC Queens made its debut in 1961, as a companion to the Women's International Bowling Congress (WIBC) National Tournament. It was known as the WIBC Queens from 1961–2004, until the WIBC became a part of the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) on January 1, 2005. The tournament is part of the World Bowling Tour, annually attracting a field of hundreds of the top bowlers from around the world.\nTen bowlers have won at least two USBC Queens titles, with only two winning three times: Millie Ignizio (Martorella) (1967, 1970, 1971) and Wendy Macpherson (1988, 2000, 2003).  Both bowlers are now in the USBC Hall of Fame.\nUSBC Queens champions\n2025 Event\nThe 2025 USBC Queens tournament was held May 14–20 at Suncoast Hotel & Casino Bowling Center in Las Vegas. The tournament had 198 total entries and a $325,250 prize fund, with a $60,000 top prize. A five-player stepladder format was used for the live televised finals on May 20. Top seed Josie Barnes defeated reigning PWBA Player of the Year Sin Li Jane, 211–198, in her lone finals match, to capture her fifth PWBA Tour title and second major.\nFinal Standings:\n1.
