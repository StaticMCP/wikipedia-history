Located on the corner of State and Congress Street, it honors poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was born in Portland in 1807.  The intersection built around the monument is known as Longfellow Square.\nDescription\nThe Henry Wadsworth Longellow Monument occupies a triangular plaza formed at the southeast corner of Congress and State Streets in central Portland.  The southeast side of the plaza is occupied by One Longfellow Square.  The monument consists of a bronze statue of Longfellow, as seen late in his life, in a seated position, which is mounted on a granite pedestal.  The pedestal is about  in height, and has carved tablets on two sides, decorated with swags and garlands that frame the name \"LONGFELLOW\".  Above these is a frieze band of anthemion and vines, with a cornice above that.  The bronze statue is about  in height, with Longfellow seated in a chair whose arms end in lion's heads, and a stack of books underneath.  Longfellow wears an overcoat, and a cape is draped over his lap and one shoulder.  One hand holds a manuscript, while the other is propped on the chair back, while Longfellow gazes at passersby.\nHistory\nFranklin Simmons began the design and construction of the monument in 1885, three years after the poet's death, with a pedestal designed by Francis H. Fassett. The monument was unveiled on September 29, 1888.  The monument is considered to be one of Simmons' major commissions. The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in April 1990.\nGallery\nFile:Longfellow_Square,_Portland,_ME.jpg|Longfellow Square on a postcard in 1906.\nFile:LongfellowMonument2.jpg|The Longfellow Monument in December 2010.\nFile:LongfellowMonument3.jpg|The Longfellow Monument in December 2010.\nFile:Longfellow Square, Portland Maine.jpg|Longfellow Square illuminated for the 2018 holiday season.
