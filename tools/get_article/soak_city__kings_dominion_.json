Tickets are included with admission to the main park.\nHistory\nWhen the park debuted in 1992, it was originally named Hurricane Reef. In 1999, the water park was expanded and renamed WaterWorks and many of the attractions received new names. It has two sections, the Northside, formerly known as Hurricane Reef, and the Southside, which is the newer section of WaterWorks. The water parks at Kings Island and Carowinds were also known as WaterWorks for a period of time before being renamed Boomerang Bay.\nIn 2015, Kings Dominion announced that WaterWorks would undergo a major expansion and be renamed Soak City, a name that has been used for other Cedar Fair water parks. The expansion included a new slide complex called Hurricane Heights featuring three unique slides, a new children's area called Splash Island, and the removal of the Shoot the Curl speed slides.\nTornado, a ProSlide Tornado slide, was removed at the start of the 2018 season. For the 2020 season, Soak City was scheduled to be expanded with the addition of Coconut Shores, a new sub-area located on the former site of Big Wave Bay. The opening of Coconut Shores was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The area features Lighthouse Landing, a multi-story water play structure, and Sand Dune Lagoon, a children's wave pool.\nSlides and attractions\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 74%\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"115\" | Name\n!Year opened\n!Description\n!Height Requirement\n!Rating\n|-\n| Aqua Blast\n| 2015\n| An enclosed tube slide featuring four intense 360-degree loops across 450 feet of slide before being dropped into a splash pool.
