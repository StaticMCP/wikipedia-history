It was recovered from the Issyk kurgan, which was examined by a team of archaeologists from the Kazakhstan Institute of History, Ethnography and Archaeology headed by Kimal Akishev.\nIt is thought to have belonged to the Scythians or Sakas. The Golden Cataphract Warrior is thought to be a Saka prince or princess around the age of 18, since he dates to the 4th century BC and the region where the kurgan was found was ruled by the Sakas in the 4th century BC. The armor was exhibited in Ankara for 2 weeks in 2019 and then moved back to Kazakhstan. Today, it is exhibited in the National Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*"
