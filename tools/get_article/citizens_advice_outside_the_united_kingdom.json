CAB Spain asks for voluntary donations through their website for anyone who wishes to support them with funding. All advice by telephone, email, Facebook or at the legal clinics is free.

CAB Spain, is however, not affiliated in any way with CAB in the UK, which is a registered UK charity and therefore totally free, unlike CAB Spain which does not receive any funding so self-funding.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.facebook.com/groups/citizensinspain/ CAB Spain Facebook page]\n*[https://cabwa.com.au/ CAB Western Australia]\n*[https://www.cab.org.nz/ CAB New Zealand]\n*[https://youth.cab.org.nz/ CAB Youth Tool Kete]"
