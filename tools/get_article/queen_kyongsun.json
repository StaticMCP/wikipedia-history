She was posthumously honoured as Queen Kyŏng () at first.\nBiography\nLady Pak was born in 1268 as the daughter of a Yuan dynasty's Cheonho (), Pak Kwang, Internal Prince Anbyeon () who was a son of Pak T'ong (). She later married Yi Chun with the couple having 5 sons and 2 daughters. After her death, instead of remarrying, her husband took Lady Cho (), the daughter of Cho Yanggi (), as a concubine.\nOn July 28, 1392, her grandson, Yi Sŏnggye established the new dynasty, the Joseon Dynasty. As the grandmother of the king, Lady Pak was given royal title of Kyŏngbi () and later on April 22, 1411, her great-grandson, Taejong of Joseon, gave her a posthumous name Queen Kyŏngsun (). Her tomb was located in Sulleung, Heungnam-si, South Hamgyeong Province.\nFamily\n* Father - Pak Kwang (; 1240–?)\n* Husband - Yi Ch'un, Tojo of Joseon (; 1265–1342)\n* Issue\n** Daughter - Princess Munhye (; 1283–?)\n** Daughter - Princess Munsuk (; 1285–?)\n** Son - Yi Chahŭng, Grand Prince Wanch'ang (; 1287–?)\n** Son - Yi Py'ŏng, Grand Prince Wancheon (; 1311-?)\n** Son - Yi Chach'un, Hwanjo of Joseon (; 1313 – 3 May 1360)\n** Son - Yi Chasŏn, Grand Prince Wanwon (; 1317–1356)\n** Son - Yi Chong, Grand Prince Wanseong (; 1320–1385)\nReferences"
