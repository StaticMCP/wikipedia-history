The first competitive winner was Italy, for Federico Fellini's La Strada, which received a further nomination for Best Original Screenplay.\nThis was the first year (and last until 1967) in which all Best Picture nominees were in color, and all were large-scale epics: The King and I, Giant, The Ten Commandments (the highest-grossing film of the year), Friendly Persuasion, and the winner, Around the World in 80 Days. This established a trend toward blockbusters and colorful spectaculars in the category, with The Bridge on the River Kwai, Gigi, and Ben-Hur following as Best Picture winners.\nThe Best Original Story category was noteworthy this year for several reasons. The winner, Robert Rich (for The Brave One) was in fact a pseudonym of Dalton Trumbo, who was blacklisted at the time and thus unable to receive credit under his own name. Edward Bernds and Elwood Ullman withdrew their names from consideration for their work on High Society, as the nomination had been intended for the musical starring Grace Kelly, while Bernds and Ullman had instead written a Bowery Boys film of the same name the year before. The nomination was a double mistake, as High Society (1956) was based on the play and film The Philadelphia Story and did not qualify as an original story.\nJames Dean became the only actor to receive a second posthumous nomination for acting. Ingrid Bergman was not present to collect her award for Best Actress: Cary Grant accepted on her behalf. Bergman, who was doing a play in Paris, praised her own victory, saying that the Oscar is \"the most wished-for award by all movie artists because it comes from your co-workers\". She later listed the nominees for Best Director via the same pre-recorded segment, while the winner was announced by host Jerry Lewis.\nDirector John Ford's classic western The Searchers, widely seen as one of the best American films of all time, failed to receive a single nomination.\nThis was the second time since the introduction of the Supporting Actor and Actress awards that Best Picture, Best Director, and all four acting Oscars were given to different films. This would not happen again until the 78th Academy Awards. Around the World in 80 Days became the sixth film to win Best Picture without any acting nominations and the most recent to win Best Picture without winning Best Director or any acting nominations. It was also the last film to win Best Picture without winning Best Director or any of the acting categories until Chariots of Fire in 1981.\nStephen Bosustow became the only producer in Academy history to receive every nomination in a category (Short Subjects-Cartoons).\nWinners and nominees\nAwards\nNominees were announced on February 18, 1957.
