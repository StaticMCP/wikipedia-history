It is awarded annually for \"the most accessible and innovative development or application of computer technology to enhance research in the life sciences at the molecular level\".\nThe prize was established by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) in memory of Warren Lyford DeLano, an American bioinformatician. DeLano developed the PyMOL open source molecular viewer software and was an advocate for the increased adoption of open source practices in the sciences. DeLano died unexpectedly in 2009.\nLaureates include the Nobel Prize winner Michael Levitt, who was given the Delano Award in 2013 for his work in computational bioscience, and Helen M. Berman, former Director of the Protein Data Bank, who was given the DeLano Award for her leadership in standardizing protein structural data, leading to such developments as AlphaFold.\nLaureates\n*2026 - Roland Dunbrack\n*2025 - Rohit Pappu\n*2024 - Eytan Ruppin\n*2023 - no award\n*2022 - Tatyana Sharpee\n*2021 - no award\n*2020 - Yang Zhang\n*2019 - Brian Kuhlman\n*2018 - Chris Sander\n*2017 - Brian K.
