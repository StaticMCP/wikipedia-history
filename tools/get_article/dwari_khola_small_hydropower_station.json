The flow from Dwari River is used to generate 3.75 MW electricity. The gross head is 450.40 m and design flow is 1.58 m3/s. The intake is located 3&nbsp;km upstream of the confluence of the Dwari Khola and Lohore Khola and the powerhouse 300 meters downstream from the confluence.\nThe plant is owned and developed by Bhugol Energy Development Company Pvt Ltd, an IPP of Nepal.
