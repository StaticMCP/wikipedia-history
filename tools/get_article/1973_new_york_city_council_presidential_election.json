Democratic incumbent Sanford Garelik initially did not run for re-election, choosing instead to run for mayor in the Democratic Party primary. After dropping out of the mayoral primary and running for re-election, Garelik was defeated in the Democratic primary by Paul O'Dwyer.\nIn the general election, O'Dwyer defeated Thomas F. Galvin and Simeon Golar by a wide margin.\nDemocratic primary\nCandidates\n*Anthony G. DiFalco, Assemblyman from Manhattan\n*Sanford Garelik, incumbent City Council President since 1970\n*Paul O'Dwyer, former City Councilman from Manhattan at-large and candidate for U.S. Senate in 1968 and 1970\nResults\n}}\nGarelik dropped out of the mayoral race at the filing deadline on April 12, filing instead for re-election as Council President.\nBecause O'Dwyer received more than forty percent of the vote, a runoff was not necessary. Nevertheless, Garelik asserted that \"irregularities\", including the misplacement of voter identification cards, had marred the election and called for a recount. In light of these claims, Garelik said, “it was almost a miracle I did as well as I did.” He pledged to contest the general election as an independent in the event that the recount did not succeed in forcing a runoff.\nO'Dwyer, who had lost races for city and statewide offices in 1965, 1968 and 1970, suggested Garelik was not \"accustomed\" to losing.\nGeneral election\nCandidates\n* Thomas F. Galvin, architect, real estate developer, and former chair of the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals (Republican and Conservative)\n* Simeon Golar, former chair of the New York City Housing Authority and aide to mayor John Lindsay (Liberal)\n* Paul O'Dwyer, former City Councilman from Manhattan at-large and candidate for U.S. Senate in 1968 and 1970 (Democratic)\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
