Captaining the side was long serving hooker Max Krilich. The club competed in the New South Wales Rugby Football League's 1978 Premiership season and played its home games at the 27,000 capacity Brookvale Oval.\nLadder\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

A Steve Rogers penalty squared it at 11-all but he then missed a desperate late field-goal attempt and at full-time the scores remained locked. For the second consecutive season the weary Grand Finalists were required to play a mid-week rematch three days later (the NSWRFL were forced to play the replay on the Tuesday and not the following weekend due to the upcoming 1978 Kangaroo tour, with the Australian team due to leave that weekend for their tour. The drawn GF also forced the Australian Rugby League to hold off on naming the touring squad until after the GF replay with as many as 12 players from Manly and Cronulla in contention to be selected).\n----\nGrand Final Replay\n| score      = 16 – 0\n| report     =\n| team2      =  Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks\n| points1    = Tries:  Russel Gartner (2)  Graham Eadie  Goals:  Graham Eadie (3/8)  Field Goals:  Graham Eadie (1)\n| points2    = Tries:    Goals:\n| stadium    = Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney\n| attendance = 33,552\n| referee    = Greg Hartley\n| manofmatch = Graham Eadie\n}}\n{| width=92%\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|FB ||1||Graham Eadie\n|-\n|LW ||2||Tom Mooney\n|-\n|CE ||3||Russel Gartner\n|-\n|CE ||4||Stephen Knight\n|-\n|RW ||5||Simon Booth\n|-\n|FE ||6||Alan Thompson\n|-\n|HB ||7||Steve Martin\n|-\n|LK ||8||Ian Martin\n|-\n|SR ||9||Terry Randall\n|-\n|SR ||10||Bruce Walker\n|-\n|PR ||11||John Harvey\n|-\n|HK ||12||Max Krilich (c)\n|-\n|PR ||13||Ian Thomson\n|-\n|colspan=3|Substitutions:\n|-\n|IC ||14||Ray Branighan\n|-\n|IC ||15||Wayne Springall\n|-\n|colspan=3|Coach:\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"| Frank Stanton\n|}\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"|\n|-\n|FB ||1||Rick Bourke\n|-\n|LW ||2||Chris Gardner\n|-\n|CE ||3||Steve Rogers (c)\n|-\n|CE ||4||Dave Chamberlin\n|-\n|RW ||5||Steve Edmonds\n|-\n|FE ||6||Martin Raftery\n|-\n|HB ||7||Steve Hansard\n|-\n|LK ||8||John Glossop\n|-\n|SR ||9||Eric Archer\n|-\n|SR ||10||Steve Kneen\n|-\n|PR ||11||Peter Ryan\n|-\n|HK ||12||Rowland Beckett\n|-\n|PR ||13||Paul Khan\n|-\n|colspan=3|Substitutions:\n|-\n|IC ||14||\n|-\n|IC ||15||\n|-\n|colspan=3|Coach:\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"| Norm Provan\n|}\n|}\nThe Tuesday rematch in front of 33,552 was Manly's sixth game in twenty-four days. It was the second Grand Final in a row to end up going into a mid-week replay with the 1977 Grand Final between St George and Parramatta also needing a re-match to decide the Premiers after the original game had been a 9-all draw.\nIn the first half Cronulla had no answer to Graham Eadie's blind-side bursts. His display completely routed the hapless Sharks and Manly went to the break holding a 15-0 lead thanks to a try by Eadie in the scoreboard corner, one he set up for centre Russel Gartner in the same corner, and another 65 metre effort by Gartner after a sweeping backline movement saw him run into open space and easily outpace the Sharks defence to score in front of the Sheridan Stand.\nThe only points in the second half came from a field goal by Eadie.\nIn the replay, as throughout their extraordinary finals campaign, Manly were inspired by the leadership of captain Max Krilich and coach Frank Stanton, their iron-man Terry Randall who had required numerous pain killing injections before every game of the finals just to be able take the field in what Frank Stanton called sheer mind over matter, their cool five eighth Alan Thompson and classy fullback and Man of the Match Graham Eadie.\nAs of the 2016 NRL Grand Final, no player since Eadie has scored the combination of a try, a goal and a field-goal in a Grand Final.\nThe refereeing of Greg \"Hollywood\" Hartley in the replay and throughout the 1978 Finals series attracted criticism from coaches Roy Masters (Western Suburbs), Jack Gibson (South Sydney) and Terry Fearnley (Parramatta), all of whom appealed to the NSWRFL to prohibit Hartley from refereeing their clubs' matches the following season.\nPlayer statistics\nNote: Games and (sub) show total games played, e.g. 1 (1) is 2 games played.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!Player !!
