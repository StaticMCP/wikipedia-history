Story, Screen-play, direction and produced by Ayyappa P. Sharma under Jyothi Movie Makers, the film features P. Sai Kumar and Soundarya in lead roles. The film won the prestigious Sarojini Devi Award for a Film on National Integration at the Andhra Pradesh State Nandi Awards 1998 which was received by Ayyppa P. Sharma as Producer and Director.\nPlot\nEshwar Alla is a socially impactful film that revolves around Kranthi, an orphan raised with strong values of humanism and secularism. Set in a peaceful mixed-community colony of Hindus and Muslims, the story takes a sharp turn when a group of self-serving political leaders deliberately incite communal riots between the two communities. Their hidden agenda is to evict the residents and illegally seize the land for personal gain.\nAmidst the rising tensions, Kranthi stands as a lone warrior, trying to stop the spread of hatred and violence. He brings to light the manipulations of these politicians and appeals to the people’s conscience, reminding them of their shared humanity beyond religion.\nThrough courage, sacrifice, and relentless effort, Kranthi inspires unity among the residents, ultimately thwarting the conspirators' plans and restoring peace in the colony. The film delivers a powerful message on national integration, portraying the idea that \"God is one – whether called Eshwar or Alla\", and emphasizes living beyond religious and caste boundaries.\nCast\nTechnicians\n* Story, Screen Play, Producer and Director: Ayyappa P.
