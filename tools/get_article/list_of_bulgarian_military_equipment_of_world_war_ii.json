Most of these mortars (380 by the end of World War I) were handed over to the Allied Control Commission after the war with 40 officially remaining as allowed weapons of the much reduced Bulgarian army by the Neuilly treaty. These \"Erhardt\" mortars were obsolete by mid-30s, so one of the first delivery priorities for the Bulgarian army in the years before World War 2 was to obtain modern mortars.\n* 8 cm Granatwerfer 34 (Germany) - 320 (or 254 by other sources) were ordered in 1936 from Germany (in addition 120 were ordered in 1938). Unlike the later mortars, officially known in the Bulgarian army as \"M34\", these are named \"Rheinmetall M36\". The total deliveries of these \"Rheinmetall\" mortars are estimated at 480, of the \"M34\" at 1400. 196 of these arrived in 1937, 160 more in 1938–1939, 160 in the first half of 1940, 1400 in 1943. There were 479 \"Rheinmetall\" and 1006 \"M34\" by 01.01.1944, 366 and 1229 respectively on 01.01.1945 and 387 and 1165 respectively on 01.01.1946\n* Brandt Mle 27/31 (France) - Bulgaria negotiated unsuccessfully in 1936 with France for a contract for supply of 60 Brandt mortars in 1936. Later in 1942-1944 up to 812 former French army 8.14 cm GrW 278(f) were delivered from Germany. 518 were available on 01.01.1944, 380 on 01.01.1945 and 328 on 01.01.1946.\n* 5 cm Granatwerfer 36 (Germany) - 812 delivered in 1943 794 available on 01.01.1944, 669 (698 by other sources) by 01.01.1945, 529 by 01.01.1946\nThe Bulgarian army had 367 mortars on 01.12.1939. This was increased to 479 on 15.04.1940. By 01.09.1944 the availability was increased to 2198 80&nbsp;mm mortars and 800 50&nbsp;mm mortars. On 01.01.1945 the army had 1465 (1595 by other sources) M34 and Rheinmetalls, 380 Brandts and 698 50mm M36. Soviet equipment arrived in 1945 - 278 82mm 82-BM-37 and 90 120mm 120-PM-43 mortar\nThe Bulgarian partisans also had a few mortars - 9 by 09.1944\nField and Mountain artillery\nField Guns\nThe Bulgarian divisional artillery in World War 2 still retained quick-firing 75mm field pieces of pre-World War I origin that were coming of diverse sources:\n* Schneider-Canet 75&nbsp;mm field gun Mod. 1904 (France) - 324 ordered for the Bulgarian army in 1906 and delivered until 1909. This was the main gun of the divisional artillery regiments in the Balkan wars and in the World War I.\n* Schneider-Canet 75&nbsp;mm field gun Mod. 1907 (France) - former Serbian army guns, about 180 captured in 1915. Also 9 more of this type were captured from the French army on the Salonika front in 1916.\n* Schneider-Canet 75&nbsp;mm field gun Mod. 1908 (France) - former Greek army guns, 8 captured in 1916\n* Krupp 75&nbsp;mm field gun Mod. 1904 and Mod. 1908 (Germany) - former Romanian army guns, about 115 captured in 1916-1917\n* Krupp 75mm field gun Mod. 1904, Mod. 1908, Mod. 1910 and Mod. 1913 (Germany)- former Turkish army guns, about 140-150 captured from the Ottoman Empire in 1912–1913, then 20-25 from the Serbian army in 1915 and 30-35 from the Greek army in 1916 (also former Turkish guns).\nUsually in the Bulgarian Army documents this motley of Schnedier and Krupp 75&nbsp;mm guns is simply listed as 75мм полски оръдия (\"75mm field guns\") or 75мм возими оръдия (\"75mm horse-drawn guns\"), which makes it difficult to differentiate between the models listed above. It is known that during the World War I until 09.1918 340 of the above-mentioned guns were put out of action (but most were repaired or replaced) and 40 more captured by the Entente forces. 707 75mm field guns were available in 09.1918 just before the Allied Offensive with the number dropping to 487 at 01.01.1919. 248 were officially listed as captured in September 1918 by the Entente forces. Then a number of guns were destroyed by the Allied Control Commission after the war as per the Neuilly treaty restrictions, but some were retained as officially permitted weapons and quite a lot were hidden and later retaken into service. Thus on 01.12.1939 the Bulgarian army still had 412 of these 75&nbsp;mm guns. At the end of 1942 there were 276 75mm \"Schneider\" and 215 75mm \"Krupp\" in the Bulgarian army. In 05.1943 there were 394 75mm field guns, in 08.1944 - 474 75mm field guns and in 01.1945 - 421.\nThere were a number of modernization efforts in 1930-1940s carried out in Bulgaria of these 75mm field guns which involved:\n# Stanchev and Dobrev Gun Carriage (СД-34) - in 1934-1935 the artillery Engineer Colonel Dimitar Stanchev (Deputy Head of the State Military Factory) and the artillery technician Gocho Dobrev (Head of the Artillery Workshop at the State Military Factory) developed a project for modernizing the gun carriage of the 75mm Krupp field guns (in 1939 Dobrev and another technician Stoyan Minkov developed a similar proposal for the 75mm Schneider field guns). The idea was to use the gun carriage of the 10.5 cm leFH 16 as a model and to implement it on the 75&nbsp;mm guns in the Bulgarian army via replacement at the State Military Factory in Kazanlak. This modernization, carried out gradually from 1936 onwards, allowed to increase the maximum elevation of the guns from 26 to 40-45 degrees and thus to increase the range from 6 to 11&nbsp;km. Initially this modernization created problems with the equilibrators and the hydraulic recoil mechanisms - the absorbers and the recuperators. As these were not replaced in the initial modernized carriages and were estimated for lower degrees, when gun elevation was used at 40-45 degrees with the new carriage, the recoil needed to be finalized by hand. The equilibrators problem was fixed by the artillery engineer Captain Ivan Stefanov along with the artillery technician Chushkov in 1936, but the Recoil mechanisms was finally fixed after trials only in 1942-1943 by a group of artillery engineers (captain Petar Ivanov and Captain Ivan Kisyov) led by Ivan Stefanov.\n# Converting to towed carriage for motor traction - in 1936 a group of artillery technicians led by Lazar Velitchkov developed special towed carriages for towing 75&nbsp;mm guns with speeds to up to 40&nbsp;km/h by the then available trucks \"Steyr\" and \"Morris Commercial\"\n# Replacing the worn gun barrels - in 1936-1937 the Artillery Engineer Captain Ivan Stefanov developed a project for the replacement of the barrels of the 75mm field guns, which were in bad condition. After detailed studies and negotiations with Krupp and Rheinmetall in Germany, this project was approved and equipment for a new workshop in the State Military Factory in Kazanlak was acquired in order to allow the replacement of the gun barrels in 1938–1940. In 1936-1944 approximately 400 guns were modernized in the factory with new gun carriages, barrels, equilibrators and recoil mechanisms\nEach Bulgarian Divisional Artillery Regiment had 1-2 artillery battalions with 12-24 75mm field guns (3-6 batteries) during the World War II.\n* 7.7 cm FK 16 (Germany) - 20 were received during World War I (18 survived the war). 14 were still in use on 01.12.1939. 16 were available on 15.04.1940. Somewhere in the 1943-1944 these were withdrawn from service.\n* 9cm Feldkanone C/80 (Germany) - 10 of these 19th century not-quick firing guns were still in service on 01.12.1939, but were retired in late 1940.\n* Canon de 75 mle GP III (Belgium, Germany) - 32 horse-traction ones were acquired in 1942 from Germany from the former Belgium army stocks. Unlike the former Belgian 105&nbsp;mm howitzers also obtained at that time, that saw wide use with the Bulgarian artillery, virtually nothing is known about the use of these guns. 2 surviving examples are still listed in 1947 as \"7.5 см возими оръдия белгийски\" in the army inventory lists of old guns, discontinued from service.\nMountain Guns and Howitzers\nThe Bulgarian army had 189 75mm mountain guns on 01.12.1939, including:\n* Canon de 75 mm Modèle 1907 Schneider-Canet (France) - these pre-WWI quick-firing mountain guns (and the captured variations from other armies in the Balkans in 1912–1917) were being replaced by the Skoda mountain guns during World War I and later by other modern mountain guns, but a small number of these were retained at least until 08.1944.\n* Krupp 75&nbsp;mm mountain gun Mod. 1904 (Germany) - these pre-WWI quick-firing mountain guns (and the captured variations from other armies in the Balkans in 1912–1917) were being replaced by the Skoda mountain guns during World War I and later by other modern mountain guns, but a small number of these were retained at least until 08.1944.\n48 of the old Schneider and Krupp quick firing mountain guns were still in service in 08.1944\n223 75mm mountain guns were available on 15.04.1940.\n* Skoda 75 mm Model 15 (Austria-Hungary) - 144 of these mountain guns were received during World War I. 36 were lost until 09.1918, including 4 that were captured. 47 more were lost during the September 1918 retreat, captured by the Entente forces. The remaining guns were retained during the interwar period and served in World War II. 104 were available in 08.1944 and 94 in 01.1945\n* Bofors 75 mm Model 1936 (Sweden, Germany) - in 1936 48 of these guns were ordered from Krupp in Germany and 56 arrived in 1938. 40 more arrived in 1940. 8 more arrived in 1942. 104 were available in 08.1944, 71 in 01.1945. Bulgarian designation was \"Krupp-Bofors Mod. 1936\" or just \"Bofors\".\nIn 05.1943 there were 200 mountain guns in the Bulgarian army.\n* 7.5 cm Gebirgsgeschütz 36 (Germany) - 90 were supposed to be supplied in 1944 under the Barbara supply programme from Germany, but only 20 were delivered before Bulgaria switched sides. Bulgarian designation was \"75mm D/19 Mod. 1936\"\nEach Bulgarian Divisional Artillery Regiment had 1 artillery battalion with 12 75mm mountain guns (3 batteries) during the World War II. There were also separate artillery battalions (4 batteries with 16 guns in total) on army level (4 in total)\n* 10.5 cm Gebirgshaubitze L/12 (Germany) - 16 delivered from Germany during World War I. 14 survived the war and were still available during World War II with the Bulgarian army.\nField Howitzers\nDuring World War I Germany supplied 172 of the following models of 105&nbsp;mm field howitzers:\n* 10.5 cm Feldhaubitze 98/09 (Germany) - supplied from Germany during World War I. Bulgarian designation is \t105-мм возима гаубица Д-12 “Круп” обр. 98/09.\n* 10.5 cm leFH 16 (Germany) and 10.5cm lFH Krupp (Germany) - supplied from Germany during World War I.

Bulgarian designation is 105мм гаубица Д/22 \"Белгийска\".\nEach Bulgarian Divisional Artillery Regiment had 1-2 artillery battalions with 12-24 105mm or 120mm field howitzers (3-6 batteries) during the World War II. The Army level (Heavy) Artillery Regiments (4 in total) also had 2 battalions with 24 105&nbsp;mm howitzers, as well as 1 battalion in the Motorized Artillery Regiment that was directly subordinated to the Bulgarian High Command. The Army level regiments and the HQ Arty Regiment were using the most modern howitzers available and capable of motorized traction, as these 5 regiments were fully motorized, unlike the divisional artillery regiments, which were (apart from the one in the Armoured Brigade and the one in the Cavalry Division) entirely horse-drawn.\nHeavy Artillery\n* 10.5cm Belagerungskanone L/30 (Germany) - 18 captured in 1913 from Turkey at Edirne, 12 available at the Bulgaria's entry into the World War I. 12 survived the war Bulgarian designation is 105мм (10.5см) скорострелно оръдие Д-30 “Круп”.\n* 10 cm K 14 (Germany) - 16 transferred from Germany during World War I. 11 or 12 survived the war.

In 1935-1937 these were modernized by creating a special towed carriage for motor traction - in 1936 a group of artillery technicians led by Marin Aleksandrov developed special towed carriages from second hand rear axis of discarded trucks \"Benz\" and \"Renault\" from WWI for towing by Pavesi tractors. Projects for replacing the worn barrels, modernizing the springs and the recoil mechanisms, etc. were also developed, but there is no data that these have been actually carried out.\n* 10 cm schwere Kanone 18 (Germany) - In June 1939 Bulgaria ordered 18 of these guns from Germany. 34 were received in 1940. Further 36 of the L/52 calibre were to be supplied under the Barbara programme, but by 06.1944 none have been delivered. Nevertheless, some more must have been supplied, as army inventory lists 46 in 08.1944 and 44 in 01.1945.

All were motorized, with the army ones having 4 battalions (usually 2 of 105&nbsp;mm and 2 of 150&nbsp;mm) and an ATG battery and the High Command one 5 battalions.\nCoastal Artillery\nIn 12.1939 Bulgaria had 2 battalions of coastal artillery (defending the Black sea ports of Varna and Burgas respectively) with 28 old guns, including:\n* Canon de 100 mm Modèle 1891 (France) - 4 of these pre-WWI naval guns were bought from France in 1900 for the Bulgarian torpedo gunboat Nadezhda, but were mostly used as coastal guns. Still in use in World War II. In 1939 these were modernized by increasing the elevation from 12 to 40 degrees and thus the range has been increased to 16&nbsp;km. Bulgarian designation is 100мм оръдие Д/50 “Шнайдер”.\n* 107 mm gun M1910 (Russia) - 4 of these captured heavy field guns were assigned to the coastal artillery of Burgas during World War I and survived until World War II.

The ships could not be over 100t, and should be only lightly armed. Submarines and naval aviation were prohibited. Thus in 1920 the Navy was transformed into a Sea Trade Police Service and River Trade Police Service, both under the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Labour. The Sea Police Service was based in Varna and had:\n* 3, later 4 of 97-ton Drazki-class torpedo boats (France) - \"Drazki, \"Hrabri\", \"Strogi\" and from 1924 \"Smeli\" (taken out of seabed and repaired). The original 6 torpedo boats (armament 2 47&nbsp;mm guns, 3 450&nbsp;mm torpedo tubes, 26 knots) dated from the early 20th century and formed the mainstay of the Bulgarian Navy during the Balkan wars and World War I. In 1916 \"Shumni\" was lost to a Russian mine. After the war the French confiscated the remaining boats and \"Letyashti\" and \"Smeli\" were wrecked by them in the Black sea. In 1920 the remaining boats were returned to Bulgaria, but the torpedo tubes were removed. In 1923-1924 the ships got minesweeper equipment and were employed as minesweepers. In 1924 the torpedo tubes of the sunk \"Letyashti\" were taken out of the sea and secret retraining of the crew for use of torpedoes began anew. In 1934-1937 the 4 torpedo boats underwent modernization - the torpedo tubes were mounted again and the artillery changed to 2 semi-automatic 3.7 cm SK C/30 Rheinmetall guns, 2 MG 08 machine-guns were added as air defense weapons(until 1942 when the original 47mm QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns were returned and as air defense weapons MG-34 were mounted on the boats, instead of the old MG 08 plus a deep charges rack and а 70-cm rangefinder). \"Drazki\" was damaged in an explosion in Varna on 15.10.1942. \"Smeli\" capsized on 19.05.1943 while transferring from Burgas to Varna. During the World War II the old torpedo-boats were used in convoy defense and coastal patrols.\n*  (Russia)  - Former 19th century steamer, acquired in 1906 as a Royal Yacht, converted in 1912 as a minesweeper (105t, 11 knots, 12 mines). At the end of World War I given to the Varna Port Authority, then transferred to the Sea Police Service. Modernized in 1924. In the 30s transferred to Danube as a hydrographic survey ship, then back to Varna again as a hydrographic and training vessel during World War II. During the war it was armed with two small calibre guns and a machine gun.\n* Lilija (ship) - Former names - \"Heraklea\" and \"Konduktor Dokuzanov\". German built WWI type minesweeper boat, delivered in 1917 (16 tons, 8 knots, 2 MGs). Refitted in 1930. Used until World War II, when it was decommissioned during the war.\n* Vyara (ship) and Balik - former names Kapitan-Leytenant Minkov and Minyor. Austrian-built WWI type minesweeper boats, delivered in 1917 (14 tons, 9 knots, 2 MGs). Refitted in 1930. Used in World War II, when Vyara was decommissioned and Balik survived the war.\n* Nessebar (ship) and Emona (ship) - Russia built WWI type minesweeper boats, delivered in 1918 (18 tons, 8 knots, 1 MG). Refitted in 1930. Used in World War II.\nIn 1921 the Bulgarian government bought from France the following ships:\n* SC-1-class submarine chaser (USA)- two of these (former French \"Chasseurs\" C 27 and C 80, former US SC-314 and SC-385) were acquired without their anti-sub gear and renamed \"Belomoretz\"and \"Chernomoretz\". These were initially based in Varna and used as minesweepers, but in 1928 these got transferred to the Danube as patrol boats and were rearmed with 1 47&nbsp;mm gun and 2 MGs. In 1941 the two ships returned to Varna and were rearmed again as sub chasers with 1 37mm, 1 20mm and depth charges and were used in convoy service.\n* Motor Launch (Canada) - four of these ex-French Canadian built motor-launches (\"Vedettes\") were acquired and renamed \"Minyor\", \"Vzriv\", \"Kapitan Minkov\" and \"Konduktor Dokuzanov\". In 1921-1924 these were used as minesweepers at Varna, then three were transferred to Danube river in 1925-1928 as patrol ships (armed with 2 MGs each). By 1934 two of the ships (\"Minyor\" and \"Konduktor Dokuzanov\") were wrecked and decommissioned and used as spare parts and only \"Vzriv\" and \"Kapitan Minkov\" participated as patrol and minewsweeper ships on the Danube in World War II.\nThe Navy in the interwar period also had some auxiliary ships, like:\n*  (Russia) - sail training vessel. Former Russian/Soviet schooner Utrish. Arrived in Varna in 1925 with immigrants from Russia and confiscated by the Bulgarian government. Transferred to the Navy in 1931 as a training ship and received 2 65&nbsp;mm guns (former Bulgarian torpedo gunboat Nadezhda guns). In 1936 also received the diesel engine \"Bolinder\" taken from the sunken U-boat UB-45. In 1942 also received 2 20mm Oerlikon guns. It had a displacement of 240 tons, speed of 7 knots, a crew of 14 and 30 trainees. Survived the World War II as a training ship (and in 1944-45 as a base ship for the minesweeper boats).\n* On the Black Sea - the small sail training vessel Strela (built 1886, 28 tons, used as a training vessel until 1941) and the steam boat Kaliakria (built 1898, 60 tons, 7 knots, used as a base for the Navy Divers Command until the late 30s)\n* On the Danube - a dozen small unarmed patrol boats.\nIn 1938 with the official lifting of the Neuilly treaty restrictions, Bulgaria begun to slowly modernize its navy. It acquired:\n* E-boat (Germany)- in 1938 a contract for 5 modified German S2 boats was concluded with the Lürssen. The torpedo boats had a displacement of 63 tons, speed of 34 knots, crew of 19-23 men and armament of 2 torpedo tubes, 1 20&nbsp;mm Rheinmetal gun and 2 MG-34, 8 depth charges, 4 mines and minesweeper equipment each. Two boats were delivered to Varna in April and July 1939 (No 1 and No 2 respectively). No 3 was confiscated temporarily by Germany at the outbreak of World War II, received more powerful engines (speed 37 knots) and was returned to Bulgaria only in July 1941. The remaining two boats were never built. The three torpedo boats were captured by the Soviet Navy in 09.1944, but were returned to Bulgaria in 04.1945\n* Motor torpedo boat (Netherlands) - instead of the remaining undelivered Lürssen Germany offered in 1942 to deliver 4 captured Dutch TM torpedo boats (38 tons, 40 knots, 14 men, 2 x 20&nbsp;mm HS804 guns, 2 - 533mm torpedo tubes, 8 Depth Charges). Eventually TM-52, TM-53, TM-68 and TM-69 were delivered by the end of 1942 and renamed No4 to No7 in the Bulgarian Navy. In 09.1944 these were captured as trophies by the Soviet Navy, but later No 4 and No 5 were returned to Bulgaria.\nIn 1939 Bulgaria also ordered three small U-boat from Germany (413tons, 16/8.5 knots, 5 533mm torpedo tubes) and even paid them in advance in 1942, but never received these.\nBulgaria was also capable of building small boats and the Navy received in the 1940s:\n* MCK minesweepers (Bulgaria) - called Project 501 and МЧК (миночистачен катер) - Minesweeper boats designed after the small boat \"Vyara\" gifted to Boris III from Italy in 1934. These had a displacement of 25 tons, 8 men, 10 knots, 1 Mg-34, minesweeping equipment. 6 were built until 09.1944, No 1 was lost in fire in 1944, 4 more until 07.1945 and 3 more after 1945. No 2 to No 6 were taken as trophies by the Soviet Navy, but returned to Bulgaria in 08.1945.\n* Maritza class minesweepers (Bulgaria) - 4 of these were built in Kavala on the Aegean sea in 1943 and were the biggest ships of the miniature Bulgarian Aegean Fleet in 1941–1944. These had a displacement of 23 tons, speed of 8 knots and an armament of 1 MG-34 and mine sweeping equipment. The names of the minesweepers were \"Maritza\", \"Mesta\", \"Struma\" and \"Vardar\". Four more were laid down in 1944, but were not finished and in September 1944 all were handed over to the Greek EAM forces.\nIn 1942-1944 Bulgaria also produced for the Germany the following ships:\n*  (Bulgaria/Germany) - 19 (newer source estimates 35 plus another 10 were captured incomplete by the Soviets in 09.1944) were produced in Bulgaria for Germany on the Black Sea.\n* Marinefährprahm (Bulgaria/Germany) - 99 (newer source estimates 91) were produced in Bulgaria for Germany on the Black Sea. In late August 1944 F128A, F176A, F405C, F575C2, F571C2M, F851D, F852D, F900D, F904DM and F907DM were transferred to the Bulgarian Navy, but served there only for a few days, as the Soviet Navy acquired these as war booty in September 1944\nAlso as auxiliary ships, the Bulgarian Navy used:\n* Dunav (ship) (Yugoslavia/Bulgaria) - former Yugoslav barges \"Vukovar\" and \"Baya\" were acquired in 1941 from Germany and then converted in Varna as minelayers \"Dunav\" and \"Svistov\". These barges had a displacement of 544tons, speed of 8 knots and could carry up to 50 mines. Used both on the Danube and in the Black sea as minelayers.\n*The Danube flotilla received 2 new boats from the Austrian company DSDG in 1942 - Motor I and Motor II, as well as one boat locally built in Varna - \"Inzh. Minchev\" which were used as minesweepers\n*Granichar (Germany/Yugoslavia) - two ex-Yugoslav German built motor boats were used on the Lake Ochrid by the Bulgarian Navy as patrol boats in 1944. Their Yugoslav names were Strazh and Granichar. These were 30 ton boats, capable of 20 knots and armed with 1 20&nbsp;mm gun, 1 Heavy Machine Gun and 2 Light Machine Guns.\n* FL boat (Germany)- three of these (FL. B404, FL. B425, FL. B584) search and rescue boats were transferred to the Bulgarian Navy in late August 1944, but were captured as trophies by the Soviet Navy in September 1944.\n* Vasil Levski (ship)- mobilized river tugs were used as minesweepers on the Danube in 1944–1945. Known vessels include \"Vasil Levski\", \"Hristo Botev\", \"Tsibar\", \"Iskar\" and \"Kiril Popov\".\nAircraft\nThe Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine forbade Bulgaria to have a military aviation and what military aviation equipment existed in Bulgaria was almost totally destroyed by the Allies in 1920. Some aircraft and equipment were hidden by the Bulgarian authorities and later reused, and successive Bulgarian governments managed to keep and expand the existing cadre of pilots and technicians by creating a civil aviation and a nascent aviation industry in the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s, but it is safe to say that by the mid-1930s, Bulgaria had in practice no military aviation. The existing mixture of planes had very little military value and almost no armament (leftover machine guns and bombs from World War I) was present even to arm those.\nBulgaria started to rearm openly in the field of aviation in 1936, although the Neuilly treaty military restrictions were only officially lifted in 1938. Of the countries approached to supply planes, only two actually agreed - Germany and Poland. Thus the Bulgarian aviation in World War II was a mixture of German (and later ex-Czech or ex-French) and Polish planes, supplemented by the local aviation industry, which managed to produce trainers and army cooperation planes.\nFighters\n* Heinkel He 51 biplanes (Germany) - 12 were bought in 1936 and delivered at the end of the year. These were the first real fighter planes in Bulgarian service since World War I. Bulgarian designation - \"Сокол\" (Falcon). Used as fighters in 1937–1940, then as fighter trainers in 1940–1946, when the last one was scrapped. One was lost in an incident in 04.1939.\n* Arado Ar 65 biplanes (Germany) - 12 were gifted by Goering to Boris III in 05.1937. Bulgarian designation - \"Орел\" (Eagle). Used as fighters in 1937–1939, then in 08.1939 assigned as fighter-trainers. One was lost in an incident, in 1939, the remainder were gradually retired during the war with the last one in 1946.\n* PZL P.24B (Poland) - 12 (some sources claim 14, but 12 are delivered) were bought in 1936 and delivered in 1937. Bulgarian designation - \"Ястреб\" (Kestrel). Used as fighters in 1937–1941, then were relegated as fighter-trainers. One was lost in an incident in 06.1938. The last remaining ones were destroyed in the Allied bombing raids on the Karlovo airfield in 06.1944. There were also negotiations in 1938-1939 for obtaining further P.24s (12 to 26 P-24J?), but the German invasion cancelled this order.\n* Avia B-534 (Czechoslovakia) - 60 bought from Germany from its Czech trophies in 1939 and arrived in Bulgaria in 10.1939. 6 more were acquired as spare parts in 1939 (5 were eventually restored to flying condition) and 12 more were ordered and delivered in 1940. Thus 78 planes were bought in total (6 as spare parts) and delivered and 77 served in Bulgaria as fighters in 1939–1943. Bulgarian designation - \"Доган\" (Hunting Falcon). Several were lost in incidents and by the end of 1941 - 73 were available for duty. During 1943 these were gradually retired as fighters and 56 were eventually deemed fit to be transferred to a ground attack role in the 2 Orlyak (Air Group) of the 2nd Ground Assault Air Regiment. 6 were assigned in 1944 with the 1st Occupation Corps in Serbia at Nis. One was destroyed by Partisans ground fire in 03.1944, the remainder by US air raids on the Nis airfield in 08–09.1944. At least 5 Avia B-534 were also destroyed on the ground on Karlovo and Graf Ignatievo airfields by Allied straffing raids in 06.1944.
