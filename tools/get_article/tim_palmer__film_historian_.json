He holds a bachelor's degree (with honors) in film and literature from the University of Warwick, a master's degree in film and television studies from the University of Warwick, and a PhD in communication arts (film track) from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\nHis primary research areas include contemporary French cinema and women in the French film industry. His first monograph, Brutal Intimacy: Analyzing Contemporary French Cinema (Wesleyan University Press, 2011), introduced the idea of the contemporary French film industry as an ecosystem, considering how it intersects with le jeune cinéma français, first-time directors, cinéma du corps (a more materials-based interrogation of the New French Extremity), pop-art cinema, female authorship, cinephilia, and La Fémis. His second monograph, Irreversible (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), is a textual and formal analysis of Gaspar Noé's infamous 2002 rape and revenge film Irréversible.\nHe has also published articles and co-edited (with Charlie Michael) a volume on French cinema, Directory of World Cinema: France (University of Chicago Press/Intellect, 2013), exploring such topics as: Paule Delsol, Liliane de Kermadec, Marina de Van, Valérie Donzelli, Jean-Paul Civeyrac, Jean-Pierre Melville, Mia Hansen-Løve, Philippe Grandrieux, Claire Denis, Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, La France, Jean Dujardin, Bruno Dumont, Water Lilies, Catherine Breillat, Marjane Satrapi, and Céline Sciamma.\nPalmer is founding co-editor-in-chief of the journal Film Matters—written and peer reviewed by undergraduate students—which has been profiled nationally by The Chronicle of Higher Education and the podcast Aca-Media, as well as various local publications.\nHe has been consulted by the Los Angeles Times for articles on Frank Capra Jr. and Catherine Deneuve, and has been interviewed by The Chronicle of Higher Education, Film International, Film Matters, as well as WHQR and UNCW.\nHis work has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies.\nStarting in 2023, Palmer served as chair of the film studies department at his previous employer, the University of North Carolina Wilmington; while in post there, he was recognized as a \"top player\" in Wilmington's film industry.\nIn 2025, Palmer relocated to the University of Utah as professor and chair of the Film & Media Arts department.\nPublications\nBooks\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSelect articles\n* \"Enraged to Live: Reviving Liliane de Kermadec’s Aloïse,” French Screen Studies 25.3 (2025), pp. 199-219\n* \"Sun and Shadow: Musidora’s Self-Curated Stardom in Periodicals and the Archive,\" Journal of Modern Periodical Studies 14:2 (2024), pp. 252-273\n* \"[https://maifeminism.com/entropic-creativity-agnes-vardas-early-publications-and-frances-post-war-film-ecosystem/ Entropic Creativity: Agnès Varda’s Early Publications and France’s Postwar Film Ecosystem],\" MAI: Feminism and Visual Culture 12 (November 2023)\n* \"Beside Du côté de la côte: Agnès Varda’s Early Applied Cinephilia,\" Short Film Studies 12:1 (2022), pp. 81-95\n* \"[https://www.sensesofcinema.com/2022/the-natural-models-of-lucile-hadzihalilovic/de-natura-the-child-centric-cinema-of-lucile-hadzihalilovic/ De Natura: The Child-Centric Cinema of Lucile Hadžihalilović],\" Senses of Cinema (2022)\n* \"[https://www.screenstudies.com/article?docid=b-9781350970687&tocid=b-9781350970687-003 The French New Wave: Insurrection Generation],\" Bloomsbury Screen Studies (2022)\n* \"Frontier Poetry: New Adventures in Contemporary French Horror Cinema,\" Modern & Contemporary France 30:1 (2022), pp. 1-17\n* \"[https://www.sensesofcinema.com/2022/the-natural-models-of-lucile-hadzihalilovic/outside-in-lucile-hadzihalilovic-and-gaspar-noes-les-cinemas-de-la-zone/ Outside In: Lucile Hadžihalilović and Gaspar Noé’s Les Cinémas de la Zone],\" Senses of Cinema (2022)\n* \"Remembrance of Things to Come: Nicole Vedrès, Paris 1900, and the Postwar French Essay Film,\" French Screen Studies 21.2 (2021), pp. 123-145\n* \"Horrible Histories of Cinema: Parisian Archival Encounters at the Fondation Jérôme Seydoux-Pathé,\" The Moving Image 18.2 (2019), pp. 155-167\n* \"[https://flmtqtest.squarespace.com/all/in-bed-with-contemporary-french-cinema-victoria In Bed with Contemporary French Cinema: Justine Triet’s Victoria],\" Filmatique (2018)\n* \"Memories of Media: An Interview with Carine Tardieu,\" The Moving Image 17.1 (2018), pp. 142-150\n* \"Drift: Paula Delsol Inside and Outside the French New Wave,\" Studies in French Cinema 17:2 (2017), pp. 144-164\n* \"Valérie Donzelli’s La Guerre est declarée: War and Peace in the Contemporary French Cinema Ecosystem,\" Modern & Contemporary France 25:1 (2017), pp. 31-47\n* \"[https://mediacommons.org/fieldguide/question/what-elements-do-you-believe-motivate-reaction-fan-culture-and-how-do-they-relate-recent--6 Guilty Pleasures/Innocent Pleasures: Porous Texts and Utopian Entertainment],\" In Media Res (December 2016)\n* \"[https://mediacommons.org/imr/2014/04/28/irreversible-climactic-sequences-flight-abstract-rapture Irreversible: The Climactic Sequence’s Flight to Abstract Rapture],\" In Media Res (April-May 2014)\n* \"Rites of Passing: Conceptual Nihilism in Jean Paul Civeyrac’s Des filles en noir,\" Cinephile 8.2 (2013), pp. 8-15\n* \"Melodramas of the Everyday: An Interview with Julie Lopes-Curval,\" The French Review 86:3 (2013), pp. 94-104\n* \"Crashing the Millionaires’ Club: Popular Women’s Cinema in Twenty-First Century France,\" Studies in French Cinema 12:3 (2012), pp. 201-214\n* \"Don’t Look Back: An Interview with Marina de Van,\" The French Review 83:5 (2010), pp. 96-103\n* \"Contemporary French Feminine Cinema and Lucile Hadzihalilovic’s Innocence,\" The French Review 83:2 (2009), pp. 38-49\n* \"Les Enfants terribles: An Interview with Françoise Marie,\" Film International 34 (2008), pp. 94-98\n* \"Paris, City of Shadows: French Crime Cinema Before the New Wave,\" New Review of Film and Television Studies 6:2 (2008), pp. 113-131\n* \"An Amateur of Quality: Postwar French Cinema and Jean-Pierre Melville’s Le Silence de la mer,” Journal of Film and Video 59:4 (2007), pp. 3-19\n* \"Under Your Skin: Marina de Van and the Contemporary French Cinéma du corps,” Studies in French Cinema 6:3 (2006), pp. 171-181\n* \"Style and Sensation in the Contemporary French Cinema of the Body,\" Journal of Film and Video 58:3 (2006), pp. 22-32\n* \"Side of the Angels: Dalton Trumbo, the Hollywood Trade Press, and the Blacklist,\" Cinema Journal 44:4 (2005), pp. 57-74\n* \"Jean-Pierre Melville and 1970s French Film Style,\" Studies in French Cinema 2:3 (2003), pp. 135-145\nSelect book chapters\n* \"Marginal/Minimal: Robert Bresson, Céline Sciamma, and Applied Cinephilia,\" Coming to Terms with Robert Bresson, Jonathan Hourigan, ed.
