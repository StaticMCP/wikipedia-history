In the , Pinjarra Hills had a population of 771 people.\nGeography\nPinjarra Hills is  by road south-west of the Brisbane central business district on the northern bank of the Brisbane River.\nMost of the land between Pullenvale Road and the river () is the University of Queensland's Pinjarra Hills campus. The campus is a  research facility.\nApart from the university camps, the suburb is rural residential.\nMoggill Road is the main road route through the suburb. Mount Crosby Road enters from the southwest.\nHistory\nThe suburb was named after Pinjarra Road which travels through the suburb. However, the origin of the road name is unknown.\nIn the 1860s Patrick Mayne purchased the land now owned by the University of Queensland. Following the death of Patrick Mayne, it was inherited by his son William. In 1922 William's death resulted in his siblings Dr James O'Neil Mayne and his sister Miss Mary Emelia Mayne inheriting the land. In 1923 the Mayne siblings gave the land to the University of Queensland to enhance the teaching of agriculture. It was known as the Moggill Farm. However, circa 2000 when the university began to plan the relocation of its agriculture and veterinary disciplines to its new Gatton campus which had its own farm, the role of the Moggill Road became unclear. Rumours circulated that the university tended to sell the land for housing which attracted considerable protest. In 2008 the university denied having such plans, suggesting that the rumours arose from the idea being used as a student exercise in a master class, but did not disclose its plans for the site.\nIn 1945, the Kenmore Tuberculosis Sanatorium officially opened at 2603 Moggill Road, having been constructed from 1943 to August 1944. After World War II, it was converted into a repatriation hospital. It closed on  24 April 1994 and was later demolished and replaced in 1998 with the Fairview War Veterans’ Home.\nDemographics\nIn the , the population of Pinjarra Hills was 664, 54.5% female and 45.5% male.
