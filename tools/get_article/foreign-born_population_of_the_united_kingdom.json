In the period January to December 2017, there were groups from 25 foreign countries that were estimated to consist of at least 100,000 individuals residing in the UK (people born in Poland, India, Pakistan, Romania, Ireland, Germany, Bangladesh, Italy, South Africa, China, Nigeria, Lithuania, France, Spain, the United States, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Portugal, Australia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, Ghana, Latvia and Somalia).\nThe foreign-born population increased from about 5.3 million in 2004 to nearly 9.3 million in 2018. In the decade leading up to 2018, the number of non-EU migrants outnumbered EU migrants while the number of EU migrants increased more rapidly. EU citizens were noted to be less likely to become British citizens than non-EU migrants.\nSize of the foreign-born population\nAt the time of the UK census conducted in April 2001, 8.3 per cent of the country's population were foreign-born. This was substantially less than that of major immigration countries such as Australia (23 per cent), Canada (19.3 per cent) and the USA (12.3 per cent). In 2005, the foreign-born population was estimated at 9.1 per cent, compared to a European Union average of 8.6 per cent. The 2011 census recorded 7,337,139 foreign-born residents in England, corresponding to 13.8 per cent of the population. The foreign-born population of Wales was recorded as 167,871 (5.5 per cent), Scotland's as 369,284 (7 per cent) and Northern Ireland's as 119,186 (6.6 per cent), making the total foreign-born population of the UK 7,993,480. Figures for each census since 1951 are given in the table below.\nA 2010 estimate for the whole of the UK showed that 4.76 million people (7.7 per cent) were born outside the EU and 2.24 million (3.6 per cent) were born in another EU member state.\nThe Office for National Statistics produces annual estimates of the size of the UK population by country of birth, based on the Annual Population Survey. The estimates for 2018 showed that 9.3 million people (14 per cent of the usual resident population) were born abroad.\nAccording to the 2021–2022 United Kingdom censuses the foreign-born population was 10.7 million or 16% of the total United Kingdom, a 34% increase over the 2011 census.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Interviews conducted by Al Jazeera suggested that Brexit may have been a more significant push factor than the pandemic. Subsequent analysis of the impact of the pandemic on population statistics generated by the Labour Force Survey (LFS) suggests that \"LFS-based estimates are likely to significantly overstate the change in the non-UK national population\". Payroll data shows that the number of EU workers fell by 7 per cent between October–December 2019 and October–December 2020.\nAccording to the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford:\n}}\nPopulation structure\nFile:Foreign born population pyramid in 1971 in Great Britain.svg|1971 (Great Britain)\nFile:Foreign born population pyramid in 1981 in Great Britain.svg|1981 (Great Britain)\nFile:Foreign born population pyramid in 1991 in England and Wales.svg|1991\nFile:Foreign born population pyramid in 2001 in England and Wales.svg|2001\nFile:Foreign born population pyramid in 2011 in England and Wales.svg|2011\nFile:Foreign born population pyramid in 2021 in England and Wales by 5 year age structure.svg|2021\nYear of arrival\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+Year of arrival into England and Wales\n|-\n!Year\n!Total number\n!Proportional make&nbsp;up\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\" data-sort-value=\"1900\"|before 1951\n|74,538\n|1%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|1951 to 1960\n|233,840\n|2%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|1961 to 1970\n|540,232\n|5%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|1971 to 1980\n|554,640\n|5%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|1981 to 1990\n|580,298\n|6%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|1991 to 2000\n|1,089,094\n|11%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|2001 to 2010\n|2,696,364\n|27%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|2011 to 2013\n|879,515\n|8.8%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|2014 to 2016\n|1,255,036\n|12.5%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|2017 to 2019\n|1,434,823\n|14.3%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|2020 to 2021\n|679,592\n|6.8%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left\"|2011 to 2021\n|4,248,966\n|42%\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!Total\n!style=\"text-align:right\"|10,017,972\n!style=\"text-align:right\"|100%\n|}\nCountries of origin\nThe table below lists the places of birth of UK residents according to the 2001 Census, as reported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The table also lists population estimates of the foreign-born population for the top 60 foreign countries of birth in the period January 2010 to December 2010, published by the Office for National Statistics.\nIn 2001, the five most common foreign countries of birth were Ireland, India, Pakistan, Germany and the United States respectively. In 2010, the most common foreign countries of birth were India, Poland (up from 18th in 2001), Pakistan, Ireland and Germany, respectively. While those born in Germany constitute one of the UK's largest foreign-born groups, many are British nationals who were born in Germany to British military personnel based there. The United States dropped to eighth place behind South Africa and Bangladesh, despite growth in the size of the U.S.-born population.\nThe period between 2001 and 2010 saw significant change in the UK's foreign-born population. In particular, the 2004 and 2007 enlargements of the European Union have led to mass migration from Poland, Bulgaria, Latvia, Romania, Slovakia and Lithuania. The number of Poland-born people resident in the UK increased from 60,711 in 2001 to an estimated 532,000 in the year to December 2010, whilst the population born in Lithuania increased from 4,363 to an estimated 87,000. The most significant decrease in a foreign-born population resident in the UK between 2001 and 2010 is in the number of those originating from Ireland. Whilst 533,901 people born in Ireland were resident in the UK in 2001, this is estimated to have declined to 405,000 by 2010.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Country of birth\n!

Census, revealing the number of people included in the census who were born outside the British Isles, where they lived, and comparing this information against the 1991 Census. The results were made available on the BBC website. Note that this data refers to Great Britain only, rather than the whole of the UK, because of the lack of digital boundaries in the census data for Northern Ireland.\nSee also\n*Modern immigration to the United Kingdom\n*MigrationWatch UK\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051110120728/http://www.ippr.org/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=308 Beyond Black and White: Mapping new immigrant communities]\n*[https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/born_abroad/html/overview.stm Born Abroad: An immigration map of Britain]"
