A column of Myanmar Army troops was dispatched by the Northwestern Command to reinforce Ku Taw. On the way there, the column raided several villages, burned 19 houses, and killed both civilians and resistance forces. The casualties of these actions include an elderly man from Katoe village, a civilian from Kywe Thay Chaung, and two People's Defense Team members in Yatkyay village. During the September 20 battle in Ku Taw, two resistance fighters died and other were injured due to airstrikes by the Myanmar Air Force.\nBattle\nOn Monday, September 30, the column of junta troops withdrew from Ku Taw to return to Budalin town. While on the way to Budalin, the column was surrounded and ambushed by resistance forces between the villages of Sipaw and Kywe Thay Chaung. Since the junta troops were out in the open while the resistance fighters fired from cover and concealment, they were overwhelmed despite air and artillery support and suffered many casualties before surrendering. Some of the junta troops were recently conscripted recruits, which contributed to the speed at which surrender was declared. Among the captured soldiers were two captains.\nAftermath and importance\nA spokesman for 96 Soldiers stated that “This is the first time a junta column was badly beaten in southern Anyar [central Myanmar]”.\nThe Myanmar Air Force began to conduct reprisal bombings in Budalin township on October 2. Two people were killed after the bombings of a school, Buddhist religious building, and a clinic in Maung Htaung village. 10,000 people have become displaced and are fleeing their villages for fear of airstrikes. Many have gone into the woods or larger towns.\nThe bodies of killed Myanmar Army soldiers were buried on October 2.\nLater in the month of October, the troops of the Northwestern Command and allied militias would maraud through Budalin Township committing atrocities as retaliation for the defeat. The most shocking incident was the massacre in Si Par village on October 17, which coincided with Thadingyut. Six villagers were killed by junta soldiers, dismembered, and their body parts hung on a fence as a display. The soldiers involved in the slaughter also burned down 300 homes. About 25 villagers were killed from October 10 to October 20, and scores of others were arrested. 50,000 people fled Budalin during these events.\nReferences"
