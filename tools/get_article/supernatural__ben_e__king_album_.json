Released in 1975, it marked King's transition to the main Atlantic Records label after time on subsidiary labels. The single \"Supernatural Thing\" brought him a return to chart success, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Soul Singles and peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. The title track and other tracks on the album featured King singing in a higher key as second tenor, rather than his usual baritone.\nTrack listing\n| length4 = 4:17\n| title5 = Extra Extra\n| writer5 = Dees\n| length5 = 3:48\n}}\n| length7 = 3:35\n| title8 = Do You Wanna Do a Thing\n| writer8 =\n| length8 = 4:24\n| title9 = Imagination\n| writer9 =\n| length9 = 3:38\n| title10 = What Do You Want Me To Do\n| writer10 = Lou Courtney\n| length10 = 3:17\n}}\nPersonnel\n*Ben E.
