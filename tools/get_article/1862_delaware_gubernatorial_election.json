Incumbent Democratic Governor William Burton was unable to seek re-election. Samuel Jefferson ran to succeed him as the Democratic nominee, and he faced National Union candidate William Cannon, the former State Treasurer. Cannon narrowly defeated Jefferson, and in so doing, was the last Republican-affiliated candidate to be elected Governor until 1894.\nGeneral election\nResults\nReferences\nBibliography\n* }}\n*\n*\n* Delaware House Journal, 69th General Assembly, 1st Reg.
