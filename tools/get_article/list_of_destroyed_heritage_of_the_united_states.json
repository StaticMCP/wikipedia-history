The year of demolition is marked in parentheses.\nThis is a list of cultural-heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed accidentally, deliberately, or by a natural disaster, sorted by state. Only those buildings and structures which fulfill Wikipedia's standards of notability should be included. The simplest test of this is whether the building or structure has its own article page.\nCultural heritage can be subdivided into two main types—tangible and intangible heritage. The former includes built heritage such as religious buildings, museums, monuments, and archaeological sites, as well as movable heritage such as works of art and manuscripts. Intangible cultural heritage includes customs, music, fashion and other traditions within a particular culture. This article mainly deals with the destruction of built heritage; the destruction of movable collectable heritage is dealt with in art destruction, whilst the destruction of movable industrial heritage remains almost totally ignored.\nAlabama\n* David Rinehart Anthony House\n* Augusta Sledge House (circa 2010)\n* Birmingham Terminal Station (1969)\n* Cedar Haven (2000s)\n* Daniel Payne College\nCalifornia\n* International Savings & Exchange Bank Building (1954): Demolished by the city government of Los Angeles.\n* MGM Silent and Early Sound Film Archive (1965): A fire in one of the studio's archival vaults destroyed the only copies of hundreds of silent and early sound era MGM films.\n* Richfield Tower (1969): Demolished to clear site for City National Plaza.\n* Samuel and Luella Maslon House (2002) Demolished for unknown reasons.\n* Andrew McNally House (2025): historic house destroyed during the 2025 California wildfires.\n* Bunny Museum (2025): novelty museum destroyed during the 2025 California wildfires.\n* Zane Grey Estate (2025): house of Canadian author Zane Grey destroyed during the 2025 California wildfires.\n* Gen.
