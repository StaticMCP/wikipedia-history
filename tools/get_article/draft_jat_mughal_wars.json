The largely agricultural Jat communities around Mathura–Agra and Bharatpur resisted heavy taxation and restrictive edicts (e.g. the reimposition of the jizya tax and bans on Hindu customs) imposed by Aurangzeb. In 1669, Jat peasants led by the Zamindar Gokula of Tilpat rebelled against the Mughal faujdar of Mathura, killing the Mughal-appointed official and provoking a harsh response. The ensuing Battle of Tilpat (1669) was a fierce three-day siege: Mughal forces eventually overwhelmed the Jats, reportedly inflicting around 4,000 Mughal and 5,000 Jat casualties, and capturing about 7,000 including Gokula. Gokula himself was taken prisoner and executed in Agra in 1670.\nAfter Gokula’s defeat, his cousin Raja Ram of Sinsini (r. 1670–1688) continued the struggle. Rajaram reorganised the Jat forces, adopting guerrilla tactics against Mughal detachments. Rajaram is famed for avenging Gokula’s death by desecrating the tomb of Emperor Akbar at Agra, symbolically challenging Mughal legitimacy. Under Rajaram the Jats won several small victories; Mughal chroniclers note that even the formidable Nawab Bahadur Khan (faujdar of Mathura) was defeated by Rajaram’s forces in one engagement. However, by 1690–1691 the Mughal central government struck back decisively. Aurangzeb enlisted his Rajput vassals – notably Raja Bishan Singh of Amber (Jaipur) – to crush the insurgency. In late 1689–January 1690 a lengthy siege of Rajaram’s fortified village at Sinsini was conducted by Mughal forces under Bishan Singh. After months of blockade, the Mughals tunnelled under the walls and exploded mines, breaching the fort. About 1,500 Jat defenders were reported killed and the survivors scattered; the remaining garrison was executed.  In May 1691 Bishan Singh also surprised the nearby stronghold of Sogar, slaughtering those who resisted. In the aftermath Rajaram and his brother Churaman nominally submitted to the Mughals , and the provinces briefly returned to quiet.\nReferences"
