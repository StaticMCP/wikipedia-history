It serves Mexican-style ice pops (paletas) and calls itself a paleteria.\nDescription\nIce Queen is a Chicana- and Indigenous-owned vegan paleteria and dessert shop at 11th and Harrison Street in southeast Portland's Hosford-Abernethy neighborhood, near Ladd's Addition. The shop's logo was designed by Tyler Alexander of the local advertising agency Kamp Grizzly.\nMenu\nIn addition to vegan paletas, Ice Queen offers vegan soft serve, chocolate-covered bananas, and cotton candy. Among paleta varieties are \"oatchata\" (horchata with oat milk base) and watermelon Tajín seasoning. Other paleta bases include avocado, coconut, and juice. The Lime All Yours comes with a small bottle of Tajin chile flakes, the Partners N' Cream has a soy milk base and cookies, and the She's in Parties has birthday cake and sprinkles. Other paleta varieties have included \"fresa\" (with Oregon strawberry), fudge, toasted coconut, and Tamal de Chocolate (masa ice cream with a Mexican chocolate filling). There have also been seasonal and holiday specials, such as the Halloween-themed varieties for October such as the pumpkin pie-flavored Shut Your Pie Hole and float made with chamoy.\nIce Queen's soft serve Thiccflurries (variants of the McFlurry by McDonald's) have an oat and soy milk base and are available in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl. Toppings such as cookie, marshmallow, sprinkles, and strawberry sauce are also vegan. Among predetermined Thiccflurries are cookies and cream and the Fruity Flurry, which has strawberry sauce, smarties dust, watermelon-flavored Sour Patch Kids, and a cherry. The Secret Admirer has a cherry chocolate base with cherries and chocolate chips, and the S'mores has a chocolate shell, graham crackers, and marshmallows.\nAs a pop-up, Ice Queen offered ice cream floats with Jarritos, creamsicles with Cheetos dust, and ice cream bars like the Apple Bottom, which has caramel and peanut butter, and the Mangonada with chamoy and mango.\nHistory\nOwner Rebecca Smith began making paletas and launched Ice Queen in 2018. In July 2020, following a series of pop-ups, Smith moved to a storefront with a walk-up window on Stark Street in southeast Portland, in a space that previously housed the tattoo shop Scapegoat. Smith moved to a brick and mortar shop on October 14, 2022. Ice Queen's products were also available at 45 local grocery store and markets at the time.\nReception\nMeira Gebel and Emily Harris included the business in Axios Portland 2023 overview of the city's best popsicles.
