Under the reorganisation, the area surrounding the cities of Bath and Bristol was formed into a new county of \"Avon\", named after the river that runs through the area. The county was divided into six districts, one of which was formed from the areas of Kingswood and Mangotsfield urban districts with Warmley Rural District, all within the administrative county of Gloucestershire. On 20 May 1987 the district was granted borough status.\nFollowing a review by the Local Government Commission for England, both the county of Avon and Borough of Kingswood were abolished on 1 April 1996. Kingswood was merged with the neighbouring Northavon district to form the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire.\nSee also\n*Kingswood Borough Council elections\nReferences"
