She started her career as a model and won the title of Femina Miss India Universe 1979 and represented India at Miss Universe 1979 pageant..\nEarly life and education\n'']]\nSwaroop was born to Bachu Sampat, an actor associated with Gujarati theatre, and Mrudula Sampat, a surgical oncologist. She belongs to a Bhatia family.\nDuring her college days, apart from studying sciences, she would act in theatre plays, such as a Gujarati adaptation of Peter Shaffer's Equus, during which she'd eventually meet her future husband Paresh Rawal.\nYears later, after becoming a mother and temporarily stopping her acting career, Swaroop obtained a PhD. in Education from the University of Worcester. She did her doctoral thesis on using drama to enhance life skills in children with learning disabilities. In 2010, she released a book on the subject, Learning Disabilities in a Nutshell: Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, Dyscalculia, Dyspraxia, which had a foreword by actor Aamir Khan, who had touched upon similar themes in his 2007 movie Taare Zameen Par.\nActing career\nSwaroop Sampat became successful with the hugely popular TV comedy show Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi, where she played the role of Shafi Inamdar's wife. She had reportedly rejected another important serial on television at that time because she found the script of Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi very touching and was sure that it connected well with common people and showed their day-to-day activities and living with simplicity. It is a decision she is happy about as the serial turned out to be an all-time hit. She  also appeared in the Kamal Haasan-Reena Roy starrer Karishma.\nSwaroop modelled for Shringar, a kumkum company. She teaches acting to disabled children.\nOther pursuits\nShe is a trainer, travelling across India to conduct workshops for teachers to impart this knowledge for the benefit of children.\nShe was selected by the then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi to head an educational program for children.\nShe was selected as one of the top 10 Global finalists for the Global Teacher Prize conducted by Varkey Foundation, amongst 10,000 nominations from 179 countries worldwide.\nPersonal life\nSwaroop is married to actor Paresh Rawal. She directs and acts in plays starring her husband. They have two sons, Aniruddh and Aditya.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Film\n!
