The club, based on Long Island, is best remembered for playing in the 1902 World Series of Football, played at Madison Square Garden. During the Series, the club played the Knickerbocker Athletic Club in a hard fought 11–6 loss and was eliminated from the competition.\nThe team claimed to be the \"New York Independent Football Champions\" in 1900 and 1901. Over the span of its history, the team's name changed several times. In 1933, the club took to the field as the Whitestone American Legion, while a year later they were called the Columbia Dems. After a 4-year hiatus, they finally fielded one final team, called the simply the Warlows.\nWarlow Athletic Club in 1900\nReferences"
