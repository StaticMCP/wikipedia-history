The Dutch planned to attack Pamaton. After that, they countered the attack on Martapura by Hidayatullah and also captured the fort on Martapura which was used by Banjar forces.\nBattles\nThe Banjarmasin had come to Pamaton Mountain where they were welcomed by the native people on the mountain and planned to attack Dutch, but the plan was leaked to Dutch and the Dutch prepared to attack them instead.\nThe attack occurred on the fort of Pamaton, where the Dutch had many soldiers and weapons to attack. But the attack failed, and many commanders were killed or wounded. This attack resulted in a loss for the Dutch and a Banjarmasin victory.\nReferences"
