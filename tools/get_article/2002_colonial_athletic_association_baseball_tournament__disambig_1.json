The event determined the champion of the Colonial Athletic Association for the 2002 season.  Sixth-seeded  won the tournament for the first time and earned the CAA's automatic bid to the 2002 NCAA Division I baseball tournament.  For the first time, the conference named an All-Tournament Team rather than simply a Most Outstanding Player.\nEntering the event, former member East Carolina had won the most championships, with seven.  Among active members, Old Dominion led with three titles while George Mason had won twice and William & Mary won once.\nFormat and seeding\nThe CAA's two division winners received the top two seeds and a first round bye, as determined by division record.  James Madison and William & Mary both finished with 9–3 records in their divisions.  The next four teams, regardless of division, were selected and seeded by conference winning percentage.  They played a double-elimination tournament.  This resulted in William & Mary receiving a higher seed than three teams in their own division who finished with higher conference winning percentages.\n{|\n|\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|+ American Division\n|-\n| || colspan=4 align=center| Div ||colspan=4 align=center| Overall\n|-\n!
