Irwin, a recipient of the Medal of Honor, at Fort Sheridan near Chicago. It was patterned after other American military societies such as the Society of the Cincinnati, the Aztec Club of 1847 and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Its primary purpose is to provide fellowship to is members and preserve the history of the Indian Wars.\nObjects\nAccording to its constitution the objects of the OIWUS are to\nMembership\nMembership originally consisted of veteran officers (termed Original Companions) and their male descendants (termed Hereditary Companions). Over the first fifty years of the Order's existence its membership included 300 Original Companions, 275 Hereditary Companions and 75 Junior Companions. In time, the Original Companions died out and the only members were hereditary companions. More recently, membership was expanded to include descendants of soldiers who served in wars with Native Americans dating back to the early 1600s.\nCurrently, Hereditary Companions can be either (1) the direct lineal or collateral descendants of Original Companions of the Order, or (2) Commissioned Officers of the United States Armed Forces, who are direct lineal descendants of honorably discharged enlisted men who had the qualifications requisite for eligibility for membership as Original Companions, save that of having been commissioned.\nMembership may also be considered for gentlemen who are lineally descended from persons, of any rank, who engaged in combat against Native Americans serving in a military unit under the British Crown, prior to June 14, 1776. Membership is by invitation only.\nCompanions\n*Lieutenant General Nelson A.
