The ward elects 3 councillors to Bassetlaw District Council using the first past the post electoral system, with each councillor serving a four-year term in office. The number of registered voters in the ward is 5,842 as of 2019.\nIt consists of the southern area of the Gateford estate in Worksop and the villages of Rhodesia and Shireoaks.\nThe ward was created in 1979 following a review of ward boundaries in Bassetlaw by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. A subsequent review of electoral arrangements in 2002 resulted in minor changes to the boundaries of the ward, although the number of councillors remained the same.\nCouncillors\n|frame=yes|frame-width=360|frame-height=310|text=Interactive map of ward boundaries.}}\nThe ward elects 3 councillors every four years.
