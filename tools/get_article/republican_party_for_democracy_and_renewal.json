Formerly known as the Democratic and Social Republican Party, (, PRDS) the party changed its identity and adjusted its political stance after the 2005 coup. Formerly very supportive of President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya and his policies, after the August 2005 coup, the party denounced Taya's policies and the mid-2006 Israeli military campaign in Lebanon.\nIn the 2001 parliamentary elections, the party won 64 out of 81 seats.\nSidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar, one of the bloc's members, was nominated as Prime Minister a few days after the 2005 coup.\nThe now-PRDR won seven seats in the November–December 2006 parliamentary election and in the 21 January and 4 February 2007 Senate elections, three out of 56 seats.\n, the PRDR is part of the Mithaq El Wihda coalition and is led by Sidi Mohamed Ould Mohamed Vall.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Party candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Result\n|-\n|1992\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya\n|345,583\n|62.7%\n|Elected\n|-\n|1997\n|801,190\n|90.9%\n|Elected\n|-\n|2003\n|438,915\n|67%\n|Elected\n|}\nNational Assembly elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Party leader\n! colspan=\"2\" |Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Result\n|-\n|1992\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya\n| colspan=\"2\" |301,349\n|67.7%\n|\n}}\n| 67\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1996\n|352,482\n|\n|67.6%\n|\n}}\n| 3\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|285,623\n|\n|57.0%\n|\n}}\n| 6\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|}}\n| 57\n| 4th\n|\n|-\n|2013\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Sidi Mohamed Ould Mohamed Vall\n| colspan=\"2\" |27,619\n|4.6%\n|}}\n| 4\n| 14th\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2018\n|National PR seats\n|5,533\n|0.79%\n| rowspan=\"2\" |}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 25th\n| rowspan=\"2\"\n|-\n|Women's seats\n|8,315\n|1.20%\n|}\nSenate elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Result\n|-\n|2007\n|231\n|6.46%\n|}}\n| 3\n| 4th\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.prdr.mr/ Official web site]\n* [http://www.angolapress-angop.ao/noticia-e.asp?ID=456722/ PRDR Condemns Israel]"
