Art historian Adam Hardy refers to the temple as Kattesvara and classifies it as a \"close to mainstream\" Western Chalukya architecture (also called Later or Kalyani Chalukya), with the tower over the shrine being a later day re-construction. The basic material used for the original construction is soapstone.\nAccording to art historian Ajay Sinha, an old Kannada inscription (c. 1057) at the temple calls it Bhimesvara-Demesvara. The inscription gives information about the genealogy of the Chalukya dynasty and refers to Vikramaditya VI as a kumara (prince). Another old Kannada inscription (c. 1108) from the rule of Vikramaditya VI gives further details about the consecration of the temple by Udayaditya under the orders of Demarasa. A third poetic Kannada inscription (c. 1212) on the premises belongs to the rule of Hoysala King Veera Ballala II. The temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India.\nTemple plan\nThe temple is two shrined (dvikuta, though only one shrine has a superstructure or shikhara), each with a sanctum (garbhagriha) and a vestibule (antarala) that connects to a common four pillared closed hall (navaranga or sabhamantapa, lit meaning \"gathering hall\"). In the original plan, a large \"main hall\" (mukhamantapa) existed, connecting the closed hall to the outside of the temple, form the southern direction. Outside the main temple complex, an open hall (called nandimantapa) containing a sculpture of Nandi (the bull, a companion of the god Shiva) has been converted into a shrine.\nThe decorativeness of the outer walls of the main shrine and its closed hall exemplify Chalukyan art. Projections and recesses with niches have been created and used skillfully to accommodate pilasters whose niches contains Hindu deities in relief, depicting the gods Indra, Shiva, his consort Parvati, Lakshmi and others.  The doorway to the vestibule has artistic carvings of dvarapalas (door keepers), the goddess of love Rati, and god of love Manmatha. The door lintel (lalata) has an image of Gajalakshmi (Lakshmi flanked by elephants on either side). The eaves over the door has fine images of the Hindu deities Brahma, Keshava (a form of Vishnu) and Shiva. According to Sinha, the exuberance of sculptural articulation seen here is actually a southern Karnataka Hoysala influence on Chalukyan architecture.\nSee also\n* Kalleshvara Temple, Ambali\n* Kalleshvara Temple, Bagali\nNotes\nGallery\nFile:Open mantapa (hall) in Kalleshvara temple at Hire Hadagali.JPG|Navaranga (closed mantapa or hall) facing a shrine in Kalleshwara temple, Hire Hadagali\nFile:Shrine and tower (vimana) of Kalleshvara temple at Hire Hadagali.JPG|Vesara tower in Kalleshwara temple at Hire Hadagali\nFile:Profile of shrine and porch in Kalleshvara temple at Hire Hadagali.JPG|Profile of shrine, and porch with decorative half pillar in Kalleshwara temple, Hire Hadagali\nFile:Shrine wall relief in Kalleshvara temple at Hire Hadagali.JPG|Shrine wall relief carvings in Kalleshwara temple, Hire Hadagali\nFile:Ganesh sculpture in Kalleshvara temple at Hire Hadagali.JPG|A sculpture of Hindu deity Ganesha in Kalleshwara temple, Hire Hadagali\nFile:Old Kannada inscription (c.1108) in Kalleshvara temple at Hire Hadagali.jpg|Old Kannada inscription dated 1108 A.D. from the rule of Vikramaditya VI gives details about the construction of the temple\nFile:Old Kannada inscription (1212 AD) in Kalleshvara temple at Hire Hadagali.jpg|Old Kannada inscription (1212 A.D) of Hoysala King Veera Ballala II at Kalleshvara temple\nFile:Nandimantapa (bull's hall) in Kalleshvara temple at Hire Hadagali.JPG|Nandimantapa (hall for Nandi the bull) in Kalleshvara temple at Hire Hadagali\nReferences\n*\n*Gerard Foekema, A Complete Guide to Hoysala Temples, Abhinav, 1996\n*Adam Hardy, Indian Temple Architecture: Form and Transformation : the Karṇāṭa Drāviḍa Tradition, 7th to 13th Centuries, Abhinav, 1995, New Delhi, .\n* Ajay J Sinha, Imagining architects: creativity in the religious monuments of India, University of Delaware Press, 2000, Cranbury, New Jersey,"
