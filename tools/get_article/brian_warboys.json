Amongst IT professionals it was deemed superior to IBM equivalents.\nUniversity of Manchester\nAs Professor of Software Engineering, Warboys researches the development of techniques which enable the dynamic evolution (the ability to change s/w whilst it is executing) of the  design of very large systems.  He was the founder and principal of the Informatics Process Group (IPG) in the School of Computer Science. IPG was established in 1991 to advance the application of Process Modelling in the context of the organization. Between 1997 and 2002 he led the EPSRC funded Compliant Systems Architecture (CSA) projects.\nWithin Europe he has headed the Manchester operating system team on the ESPRIT-funded EDS project, and the IPG's involvement in the ESPRIT Basic Research Activity PROMOTER on software process modelling and technology.\nIn 2001 he led the IPG's involvement in the Framework IV Basic Research Action PIE, process instance evolution, and later the Archware project. in which he was also joint technical coordinator.\nRecognition\nHe was appointed the first ICL Fellow in 1984.\nReferences"
