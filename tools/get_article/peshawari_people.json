The dialect of Hindko spoken in the Peshawari households is known as the Peshori Hindko, or simply Peshori, which also serves as the standardised literary dialect of the Hindko language.\nPeshoris have inhabited Peshawar for thousands of years, and formed majority in the city until the 1960s. Today they are a minority ethnic group mostly confined to the historic Walled City (Androon Shehr), owing to the rural-to-urban migration of rural Pashtuns into the city, linguistic shift to Pashto and Urdu as well as the influx of Afghan refugees following the Soviet-Afghan War, among other factors. They constitute 5.5% of the urban population of Peshawar, or around 105,000 people (this number only reflects the fraction of total city population that speaks Hindko as first language, thus neglecting a significant fragment of Peshoris, especially youth members - which has shifted to Urdu as the primary tongue, leading to an overall underestimation), according to the 2023 Census of Pakistan.\nCulture\nSimilar to the widely recognised Pashtunwali tradition or tribal code of honour of Pashtuns, the Peshoris adhere to an urban cultural code known as Peshoritop (Hindko: پشوری پن), which encapsulates their distinct identity and social practices. This code, rooted in the traditions of Peshawar, emphasises four key principles:\n#Storytelling\n#Hospitality\n#Self-esteem\n#Hyper-social Community Structure\nDiaspora\nNotable people\n* Putras Bukhari\n* Dilip Kumar\n* Ismail Gulgee\n* Farigh Bukhari\n* Shah Rukh Khan\n* Dr. Sayed Amjad Hussain\n* Syed Shafaat Ali\n* Z.
