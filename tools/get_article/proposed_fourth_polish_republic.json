However, the concept of a fourth republic has failed to gain any traction since the mid-2000s and PiS has since sidelined this policy.\n2005 Polish Parliamentary Election\nDuring the 2005 Polish Parliamentary election, the term \"Fourth Polish Republic\" was used by several parties, including the Civic Platform (PO), Polish People's Party (PSL), the League of Polish Families (LPR), and, most notably, Law and Justice (PiS).\nDefinition and implementation of the Fourth Republic as a Concept\nAccording to PiS, the current Third Polish Republic is a post-communist creation whose very foundations must be changed to create a truly democratic state free of its past. For the constitution of the new Fourth Polish Republic, PiS made a draft which outlined several points including:\n* Defining moral and national traditions as forming the axiological foundation of the constitution\n* An Invocatio Dei\n* A clear idea of the nation-state, derived from ideas of \"independence\" and \"democracy\" in contrast with \"enslavement\" and \"communism\"\n* Defining the clear concept of the goals of the state as serving the common good of the citizenry.\n* Placing the family as a fundament of social life and it's rights under the special protection of law.\n* Insurance of the primacy of Polish constitutional law over International law.\n* Specification of the place of individual authorities, especially executive centers, in the Polish legal system.\n* A clear division of competences in administrative order.\n* A clear concept of state control over all spheres of public life.\nPoliticians from other parties have criticized PiS for their proposal, citing it as a violation of the principles of Democracy and Secularism. Criticism which supporters of PiS claimed was a result of an initiative by the political establishment to maintain power for their own interests.\nDuring Jarosław Kaczyński's tenure as prime minister from 2006-2007, a fourth republic was not declared or implemented in any meaningful way despite the party's campaign heavily focusing on it.\nConcept of a Fourth Polish Republic Post-2000s\nAside from a brief resurgence in discussion during the 2015 Polish parliamentary election, the concept of a 4th polish republic has largely faded from the public conscience of Poland as a genuine political movement.\n“IV RP”, along with its derivative, “V RP” (Fifth Polish Republic), has also been used by critics to satirize the concept of unnecessary constitutional changes made for arbitrary reasons.\nSee also\n* 2015 Polish presidential election\n* 2015 Polish parliamentary election\n* Proposed French Sixth Republic\nReferences\n# [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4754079.stm Polish nationalism resurgent from the BBC]\n# [https://web.archive.org/web/20070716132651/http://www.pis.org.pl/doc.php?d=unit&id=7 the project of constitution IV RP made by Prawo i Sprawiedliwość] (document in polish)"
