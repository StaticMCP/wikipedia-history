He served as the chief technical editor for Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet standardisation, and was recognized by the IEEE as an \"Outstanding Contributor\" to the IEEE P802.3z Gigabit Task Force.\nJohnson earned his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (1978), Masters of Electrical Engineering (1979), and PhD (1982) from Rice University. His dissertation was titled The design of DFT algorithms.\nArea of contribution\nJohnson has significantly raised awareness of analog effects at work in high speed digital electronic systems.\nIn modern digital systems, it is common for digital designs to be subject to analog effects, even if they operate at a relatively low clock frequency.  Circuits operating at lower clock rates can behave as high speed digital systems if there is sufficient high frequency content in the signal edges (when transitioning between digital logic levels) relative to the distance traveled across a printed circuit board.  As a result of improvements in semiconductor process, faster edge rates of even \"low technology\" electronic components can be sufficient to make the system effectively high speed and thus subject to havoc caused by unanticipated analog effects.\nA good example is his illustration of the matrix of rising edges that result from different combinations of skin-effect and dielectric loss which illustrates PCB design problems one encounters at microwave frequencies.\nJohnson was also active in the development of two Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards that govern Ethernet, IEEE 802.3 Fast Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 Gigabit Ethernet.\nBooks and publications\nJohnson has written three books:\n* High-Speed Digital Design: A Handbook of Black Magic (1993),\n* Fast Ethernet: Dawn of a New Network (1995),\n* High-Speed Signal Propagation: Advanced Black Magic (2003),\nJohnson also ran a monthly column at EDN (magazine) entitled Signal Integrity, which was later moved to a  [http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/4238443/Signal-Integrity blog] format.\nHe signed off with his last post \"[http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/signal-integrity/4417372/Seek-inspiration- Seek inspiration]\" on 24 June 2013.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.sigcon.com/ Signal Consulting Inc.] — Howard Johnson's website\n* [http://www.theamphour.com/the-amp-hour-77-winsome-waveform-wizardry/ Dr Howard Johnson on The Amp Hour Podcast] (10 January 2012)\n* [https://archive.today/20121223143758/http://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/HSDEWiki Howard Johnson's (former) High Speed Digital Design courses at the University of Oxford]"
