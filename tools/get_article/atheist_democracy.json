Its ideology includes secularism, atheism, and anti-clericalism.\nAmong the main goals, it campaigns for the abolition of the Lateran Treaty between Italy and the Vatican City.\nThe party was founded by Carla Corsetti in 2009; , Corsetti is the current secretary;  others members of the secretariat are Ciro Verrati, Ivan Visentini, Rosaria Gabriele, Cai Bravi.\nThe party requires all candidates for public office to give proof of debaptism (sbattezzo in Italian). In Italy, many newborn receive baptism; debaptism is a formal procedure to declare oneself no longer part of the Catholic Church.\nWidely renowned astrophysicist and scientific communicator Margherita Hack was a member of Atheist Democracy; in 2013 she also ran unsuccessfully for the Italian parliament with the party.\nMarco Dimitri also ran for office in 2013 with AD; being Satanist, his move drew some criticism.\nIn 2018, Atheist Democracy entered the Power to the People! coalition, also inserting the abolition of Lateran Treaty in the shared political program; this affiliation was interrupted in May 2021.\nOn 1 July 2022, Atheist Democracy, together with far-left parties and organizations (Confederation of the Italian Left, Inventing the Future, The Future City, Italian Communist Party, CARC Party and Italian Marxist-Leninist Party), became part of the \"Popular Unity\" coordination, with the aim of elaborating and implementing common and shared initiatives and proposals.\nElection results\n{|class=wikitable style=\"width:50%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n|colspan=7|Chamber of Deputies\n|-\n!width=13%|Election year\n!width=16%|Votes\n!width=6%|%\n!width=1%|Seats\n!width=8%|+/−\n!width=18%|Leader\n|-\n!2013\n|556\n|0.00\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2018\n|colspan=2|In Power to the People\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n{|class=wikitable style=\"width:50%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n|colspan=7|Senate of the Republic\n|-\n!width=13%|Election year\n!width=16%|Votes\n!width=6%|%\n!width=1%|Seats\n!width=8%|+/−\n!width=18%|Leader\n|-\n!2013\n|–\n|–\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2018\n|colspan=2|In Power to the People\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.democrazia-atea.it Democrazia Atea]"
