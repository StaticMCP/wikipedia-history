While covering much of the same ground as Rhino's Have a Nice Day series, it includes more R&B, funk, soul and disco from the period. It also has several tracks from iconic artists of the era, making this set less of an obscure semi-hits collection than the iconic Have a Nice Day series.\nThe first copies of Have a Nice Decade released are covered with an iconic shag rug carpeting incorporating the iconic colors, textures and icons that have since become icons of the decade. Some of the tracks include sound clips of the decade, which follow a short silence at the end of the song (but which are still part of the track). The clip is a reference to the title of the next song in the running order. The clips are described below inline with the track it follows, with links to appropriate articles for the events described.\nTwo additional installments were made in this series, covering the 1980s and the 1990s.\nTrack listing\nDisc one\n# Edison Lighthouse: \"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\" – 2:53\n# Shocking Blue: \"Venus\" – 3:06\n# Lynn Anderson: \"Rose Garden\" – 3:27 ''Sound clip (begins at 2:47): Patty Hearst's abduction by, and expression of the aims of, the Symbionese Liberation Army\n# The Guess Who: \"American Woman\" – 3:53\n# Sugarloaf: \"Green-Eyed Lady\" – 3:40\n# The Ides of March: \"Vehicle\" – 2:56\n# George Baker Selection: \"Little Green Bag\" – 3:24 Sound clip (begins at 3:16): Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell saying to ground control, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"\n# The Blues Image: \"Ride Captain Ride\" – 3:09\n# Norman Greenbaum: \"Spirit in the Sky\" – 4:02\n# Murray Head: \"Superstar\" – 4:22 Sound clip (begins at 4:03): John Dean, former counsel to President Richard Nixon, testifying before the Watergate Committee''\n# Chairmen of the Board: \"Give Me Just a Little More Time\" – 2:41\n# The Delfonics: \"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)\" – 3:23\n# Five Stairsteps: \"O-o-h Child\" – 3:16\n# The Jackson 5: \"ABC\" – 2:43\n# Freda Payne: \"Band of Gold\" – 2:55\n# James Taylor: \"Fire and Rain\" – 3:54 Sound clip (begins at 3:22): Interview with a member of the Lakota nation during the Wounded Knee Incident\n# The Raiders: \"Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)\" – 3:27 Sound clip (begins at 2:53): Description of the \"Jesus People\" of southern California\n# Ocean: \"Put Your Hand in the Hand\" – 2:57\n# Brewer & Shipley: \"One Toke Over the Line\" – 3:21\n# Five Man Electrical Band: \"Signs\" – 3:27\n# Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds: \"Don't Pull Your Love\" – 2:43\n# Lobo: \"Me and You and a Dog Named Boo\" – 2:57\n# Cat Stevens: \"Wild World\" – 3:20\n# Three Dog Night: \"Joy to the World\" – 3:15\nDisc two\n# Isaac Hayes: \"Theme from Shaft\" – 3:17\n# Sly and the Family Stone: \"Family Affair\" – 3:06\n# The Dramatics: \"Whatcha See Is Watchcha Get\" – 3:33\n# Cornelius Brothers and Sister Rose: \"Treat Her Like a Lady\" – 2:46\n# The Chi-Lites: \"Have You Seen Her\" – 4:49\n# Honey Cone: \"Want Ads\" – 2:47\n# Al Green: \"Let's Stay Together\" – 3:18\n# Lee Michaels: \"Do You Know What I Mean\" – 3:14\n# Rod Stewart: \"Maggie May\" – 5:19 Sound clip (begins at 5:10): Bobby Riggs spouting male-chauvinist views before his celebrated tennis challenge match with Billie Jean King (which he lost)\n# Jean Knight: \"Mr. Big Stuff\" – 2:30\n# Daddy Dewdrop: \"Chick-A-Boom (Don't Ya Jes' Love It)\" – 2:51\n# Melanie: \"Brand New Key\" – 2:26\n# Coven: \"One Tin Soldier (The Legend of Billy Jack)\" – 3:38 ''Sound clip (begins at 3:21): Eyewitness account of the Ohio National Guard's shooting of students at Kent State''\n# Alice Cooper: \"School's Out\" – 3:30\n# Hot Butter: \"Popcorn\" – 2:33\n# Apollo 100: \"Joy\" – 2:46\n# Helen Reddy: \"I Am Woman\" – 3:16\n# America: \"A Horse with No Name\" – 3:50\n# The Staple Singers: \"I'll Take You There\" – 3:23 ''Sound clip (begins at 3:15): Vice President Spiro Agnew condemning the 'nattering nabobs of negativism,' in a speech written by William Safire\n# The Main Ingredient: \"Everybody Plays the Fool\" – 3:39 Sound clip (begins at 3:19): John Chancellor (NBC News) reports the disappearance of former Teamsters' Union chairman Jimmy Hoffa''\n# Joe Tex: \"I Gotcha\" – 2:29\n# The Spinners: \"I'll Be Around\" – 3:12\n# Bill Withers: \"Lean on Me\" – 3:42\n# Godspell: \"Day By Day\" – 3:14\nDisc three\n# Gilbert O'Sullivan: \"Alone Again (Naturally)\"  – 3:39\n# Climax: \"Precious and Few\"  – 2:47\n# Looking Glass: \"Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)\" – 3:05\n# King Harvest: \"Dancing in the Moonlight\" – 2:51\n# Gallery: \"Nice to Be with You\" – 2:38\n# Sammy Davis, Jr. with The Mike Curb Congregation: \"The Candy Man\" – 3:10\n# Wayne Newton: \"Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast\" – 3:24\n# Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen: \"Hot Rod Lincoln\" – 2:44\n# Gary Glitter: \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" – 3:02\n# Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show: \"The Cover of Rolling Stone\" – 2:54\n# Carly Simon: \"You're So Vain\" – 4:20\n# Billy Paul: \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" – 4:47\n# Curtis Mayfield: \"Freddie's Dead (Theme from Superfly)\" – 3:27 ''Sound clip (begins at 3:17): President Richard Nixon announcing 'peace with honor' as the results of the American agreement to withdrawal from Vietnam, reached at the Paris Peace Accords.\n# Maureen McGovern: \"The Morning After\" – 2:23\n# The Isley Brothers: \"That Lady (Pt. 1)\" – 3:49 Sound clip (begins at 3:20): Elizabeth Ray on the imminent marriage of her former employer, Rep.
