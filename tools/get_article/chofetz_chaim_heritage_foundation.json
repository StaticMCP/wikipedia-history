The foundation is dedicated to spreading the teachings of Rabbi Israel Meir Kagan, known as the Chofetz Chaim (  \"Seeker of Life\" in Hebrew) and is based on his work of Jewish ethics of the same name. Kagan’s work deals with the prohibitions of gossip, slander and defamation, which are known as Lashon Hara in Jewish law (Halakha).\nIts Shmiras Halashon programs are in various Orthodox Jewish high schools, primarily those attended by girls.\nSee also\n* Chofetz Chaim (disambiguation).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070825205050/http://www.chofetzchaimusa.org/ Chofetz Chaim Heritage Foundation]"
