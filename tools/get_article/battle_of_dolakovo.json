The clash took place in the village of Dolakovo in the North Caucasus and reflected local resistance to White forces advancing through the region.\nIn early February 1919, General Denikin launched an offensive against Western Ingushetia, deploying the best units of his army — the 3rd Army Corps under the command of V.P. Lyakhov. On 1 February, after capturing Nalchik, a division led by A. Shkuro began advancing toward Vladikavkaz. On 2 February, the Plastun battalions of the Kuban Cossack division, commanded by General A. Geiman, approached the villages of Dolakovo and Kantyshevo.\nBackground\nThe Whites' goal was to encircle Vladikavkaz, defeat the Bolshevik forces and then break through to Grozny. In this regard, the Ingush were given an ultimatum to allow troops to pass through their territory. The deadline for fulfilling these demands was very short - until 10 am the next day. The Whites' offensive, however, met with a decisive rebuff. On February 4, 1919, G.K. Ordzhonikidze convened a congress of the Ingush people in Bazorkino (in the Uvarov estate), which gathered more than 10 thousand participants.\nThe White Guards' ultimatum was rejected, and the congress delegates expressed their readiness to fight the White Guards to the end. At the suggestion of Musa Sautiyev (Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of Ingushetia), the congress elected a Defense Committee of 11 people, which included A. Gorchkhanov, Yu. Albogachiyev, I. Zyazikov, M. Sautiyev, A. Goygov, Kh. Ortskhanov, I. Malsagov, M. Uzhakhov, O. Malsagov, Bogatyrev Takhir-mullah\nwithout a fight. In this regard, Ingush officers who had fought on the side of the White Guards arrived in Dolakovo and once again presented the villagers with a demand to let the White units through. It is known from field materials that Colonel Beksultan Ismailovich Kotiev (Byatyrkhan) of the Tsarist army also took part in the negotiations with the elders. Convincing his fellow countrymen, he insisted: \"that the Ingush will not be able to withstand Denikin's well-armed troops.\" However, they did not listen to him. Then a member of the Revolutionary Committee, Yusup Albogachiev, spoke, calling on the villagers not to trust the White officers. He read out a leaflet addressed to the Cossacks and Ossetians and signed by A. Shkuro, which said that they needed to unite in the fight against the Ingush: \"... Rise up, all of you, as one man, against the villainous Ingush, join us and fulfill your duty to your ancestors and descendants...»Of course, it was a policy of pitting peoples against each other to achieve the necessary political goals.\nIn turn, the command of the White units expected to pass through Ingushetia\nAs a result, the Ingush decided to die in battle with weapons in their hands, but not to let the Whites through to Vladikavkaz and Grozny. Several more times, parliamentarians from the Whites arrived.\nBattle\nin his yard. From field materials it is known that during the Dolakov battle 13 people were burned by Denikin's forces.\nDetachments from all the villages of flat Ingushetia rushed to help the Dolakovites. Zaam Islamovich Yandiev and Khizir Idigovich Ortskhanov were among the first to come to the aid of the Dolakovites with their detachments. The detachment from the village of Gamurzievo was led by Ayup Dautievich Ganiev: \"wounded in the head, he remained at the forefront at the head of his detachment\". Many brave men fought in Ganiev's detachment, among them were: Uma Malsagov, Yarmak Vyshegurov and Sait Oziev (died), poet and writer Salman Oziev, Baysultan Tsoroev and others. For the courage and bravery shown in these battles, 24-year-old Ayup Ganiev was awarded a certificate. The Altievskaya hundred was led by Musa Elmurzaevich Malsagov.\nSome of the fighters of his detachment are also known: Khosbot-mullah, Sagov Mokhmad Tovbot-Khadzhievich, professor Doshloko Dokhovich Malsagov.\nA detachment of residents of the village of Surkhokhi also repelled the attack of Denikin's forces. The names of some of them are known: Mutsolgov Idris Chukievich (died), Tumgoev Solsa Astamirovich (died), Tochiev Magomet Shovkhalovich (died), Dakiev A1darzka (died), Dakiev Salman (died), Malsagov Elmurza (died)\nAbout 30 people from the village of Ekazhevo took part in the Dolakovskoye battle. Having put on white shrouds, they declared gazavat (gozot) in the Ekazhevskaya mosque and advanced to help the Dolakovites.\nReferences\nSources\n* Severo-Kavkazskij front // Vechernee vremya (Rostov-na-Donu). – 13 May 1919 – № 268\n* 4.
