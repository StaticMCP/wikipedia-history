Lin Shuqin tries to convince the grandfather of one of her students Xiao Zhenzhen, who is also an elderly scholar from Qing era, to flees the city but he refuses, stressing out that the city was the important capital of China for centuries and dismissed the Japanese military as a nothing more than mere pirates. Soon the city has fallen to the Japanese military, and the Chinese garrison surrendered, of which the surrendered soldiers were later massacred en masse. The Japanese military now begins their reign of terror and death upon the ruined city and it's inhabitants.
