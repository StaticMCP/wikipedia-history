The ceremonies were presided over by Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw, George Segal, Goldie Hawn, and Gene Kelly.\nMiloš Forman's ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest made a \"clean sweep\" of the five major categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adapted). It was the second of three films to date to do so, following It Happened One Night in 1934 and preceding The Silence of the Lambs in 1991.\n20-year-old French actress Isabelle Adjani received her first nomination for Best Actress this year, becoming the youngest nominee that category, breaking the record set by 22-year-old Elizabeth Hartman in 1965. Her record would be surpassed by 13-year-old Keisha Castle-Hughes in 2004, and again in 2013 by nine-year old Quvenzhané Wallis, the current record. Adjani also co-presented the award for Best Film Editing.\nAt 80, George Burns became the oldest acting winner, as well as the last person born in the nineteenth century to receive an acting award. His record stood until Jessica Tandy won Best Actress in 1989; Burns was later succeeded as the oldest Best Supporting Actor winner by Christopher Plummer, who won in 2012 for Beginners at the age of 82.\nJaws won all its nominations except Best Picture, the last film to do so until Traffic. As of the 94th Academy Awards, Amarcord'', nominated for Best Director, is the last film to be nominated for Academy Awards in separate years (having won the award for Best Foreign Language Film the year before).\nThis ceremony marked the return of Oscar telecasts to ABC, which carried the event from 1961 until NBC held the rights for a 5-year period beginning in 1971. (ABC has maintained Oscar TV rights to this day.) NBC's coverage of the NCAA Division I basketball championship aired the same night as the ceremony, and while Adjani unsealed the envelope for Best Film Editing, co-presenter Elliott Gould jokingly announced the winner as \"Indiana, 86-68\" (the title game's outcome in Philadelphia).\nWinners and nominees\nNominees were announced on February 17, 1976. Winners are listed first, highlighted in boldface and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Picture\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Directing\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest – Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz, producers'\n**Barry Lyndon – Stanley Kubrick, producer\n**Dog Day Afternoon – Martin Bregman and Martin Elfand, producers\n**Jaws – Richard D.
