The team was created in 2017 and had its first season in 2018. The club competes in the RFL Women's Super League which the team won during its first season.\nThe team plays its home games at Robin Park Arena, Wigan which doubles as the elite performance facility for many of the Wigan club's teams.\nThe team are the current holders of the Womens Challenge Cup, the RFL Women's Nines, (winning the tournament on 28 July 2024 at Craven Park, Hull, and again in 2025), the League Leaders Shield, and the Women's Super League\nIn 2023, England international Vicky Molyneux became the first female inductee into the club's Hall of Fame.\nHistory\nWigan Warriors women's team was established in October 2017 ahead of the 2018 RFL Women's Super League. The team won the league championship in their inaugural season beating Leeds Rhinos 18–16 in the Grand Final at the Manchester Regional Arena. At the end of the 2023 season, vice-captain Vicky Molyneux became the first female player to enter the Wigan Warriors Hall of Fame. The team played their first match at the DW Stadium during the opening game of the 2024 Super League in a 18–4 victory over Barrow Raiders. Midway through the 2024 season, the club moved their training base to Edge Hall Road which had been redeveloped into an elite women's training facility by Wigan Warriors and Wigan Athletic. In May 2025, The Guardian praised the club for establishing itself as regular challenges amongst the traditional top three of St Helens, Leeds, and York, described it as a \"watershed moment\" for the women's game. The club finished the 2025 season as treble winners following a 2025 Super League Grand Final victory over St Helens, after beating them in the Challenge Cup final earlier in the year, and lifting the League Leaders' Shield. They did so as an amateur side, with the aforementioned \"traditional top three\" having become semi-professional in the last few years.\nTeams\nWigan Warriors Women are one of 11 teams operated by Wigan Warriors, the others are:\n*Women's academy (under 19s)\n*Men's first team\n*Men's Reserves\n*Men's Academy (under 18s)\n*Men's Scholarship (under 16s)\n*College development squad (men and women aged 16–18)\n*Physical disability\n*Learning disability\n*Wheelchair (mixed)\n*Wheelchair A (wheelchair reserve team)\n*Touch Rugby\nPlayers\n|list1b=\n|list1c=\n|list1d=\n|list1e=\n|list1f=\n|list1g=\n|list1h=\n|list1i=\n|list1j=\n|list1k=\n|list1l=\n|list1m=\n|list2a=  (vc)\n|list2b=\n|list2c=\n|list2d=\n|list2e=\n|list2f=\n|list2g=\n|list2h=\n|list2i=\n|list2j=\n|list2k=\n|list2m=\n|legend1=\n|legend2=\n|legend3=\n|captain=\n|coach= Denis Betts\n}}\nSeasons\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|Season\n!colspan=\"9\" scope=\"col\"|League\n!rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|Play-offs\n!rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|ChallengeCup\n!rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|9s\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Division\n!scope=\"col\"|P\n!scope=\"col\"|W\n!scope=\"col\"|D\n!scope=\"col\"|L\n!scope=\"col\"|F\n!scope=\"col\"|A\n!scope=\"col\"|Pts\n!scope=\"col\"|Pos\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2018\n|Super League\n|12||9||1||2||324||128||19\n|style=\"background-color:#DDD\"|2nd\n|style=\"background-color:#FE2\" |Won in Grand Final\n|SF\n|rowspan=\"4\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2019\n|Super League\n|14||6||1||7||328||224||13\n|4th\n|Lost in semi-final\n|QF\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2020\n|Super League\n|colspan=\"10\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2021\n|Super League\n|11||5||0||6||254||186||10\n|5th\n|\n|QF\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2022\n|Super League\n|8||2||0||6||104||313||4\n|4th\n|Lost in semi-final\n|QF\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2023\n|Super League\n|10||3||1||6||116||250||7\n|4th\n|Lost in semi-final\n|SF\n|style=\"background-color:#DDD\"|RU\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2024\n|Super League\n|14||9||0||5||532||144||18\n|4th\n|Lost in semi-final\n|SF\n|style=\"background-color:#FE2\" |W\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2025\n|Super League\n|14||12||1||1||752||120||25\n|\n|style=\"background-color:#FE2\"|Won in Grand Final\n|style=\"background-color:#FE2\" |W\n|style=\"background-color:#FE2\" |W\n|}\nHonours\nLeagues\n*Women's Super League\n*:Grand Final\n*::Winners (2): 2018, 2025\n*:League Leader's Shield\n*::Winners (1): 2025\n*::Runners-up (1): 2018\nCups\n*Women's Challenge Cup\n*:Winners (1): 2025\n*RFL Women's Nines\n*:Winners (2): 2024, 2025\n*:Runners-up (1): 2023\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://wiganwarriors.com/ Wigan Warriors]"
