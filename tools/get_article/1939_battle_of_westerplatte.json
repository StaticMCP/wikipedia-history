It portrays the Battle of Westerplatte between the Polish Army and Nazi German forces at the start of World War II in 1939. The film focuses on the conflict between Westerplatte commander Henryk Sucharski (Michał Żebrowski) and his deputy Franciszek Dąbrowski (Robert Żołędziewski).\nCast\n* Michał Żebrowski − as Major Henryk Sucharski\n* Robert Żołędziewski − as Capt.

One critic described it as a \"hymn to the heroism of the defenders of Westerplatte.'\"\nPossibly in an attempt to deflect the negative criticism, which the title word \"Tajemnica\" (Secret), implying as it does that the film makes revelations and runs against the long-held perception of the battle as an heroic Polish defence, publicity posters omitting the word were produced and at least three other versions of the title have been used. These range from the non-committal \"1939 Westerplatzer Battlefield\" and \"1939 Battle of Westerplatte\" to another version that unambiguously addresses the issue, \"Heroes of Westerplatte 1939\".\nReferences"
