Colonel Karl Wilkman was directly ordered by C.G Mannerheim to capture Lempäälä with a route through Kangasala to blockade and encircle Tampere. Kangasala was captured on 22 March and following a short battle, Lempäälä was captured by the White forces. The Reds in Lempäälä consisted of local poorly trained militia and some Helsinki Red Guardsmen, who quickly fell to the vastly outnumbering White forces around 25 March.\nRed Counterattack\nFollowing their defeat, Eino Rahja gathered a group of around 2,000 men from Southern Finland and St. Petersburg and started an attack to break the encirclement of Tampere. There was a severe focus of the fighting in Lempäälä on the isthmus between Lake Vanajavesi and Lake Pyhäjärvi, and the Reds initially managed on pushing back the White forces and there was a hope of breaking the encirclement in Tampere. The two last reserve battalions within the Lempäälä area were ordered to counterattack, scything the Reds ability to relieve Tampere. When the news of Tampere's fall to the Whites reached the Lempäälä Red Guard, they stopped their offensive towards Tampere and started a attritional war. However, on the 24th of April, the Red Guard in Lempäälä was ordered to retreat.\nCasualties\nAccording to War Victims of Finland 1914–1922, which is a database published by the National Archives of Finland, around 194 Whites fell in total in the battle, and around 43 of them being at Vesilahti, including two Swedish volunteers. Around 249 Reds fell in total in the battle, around 61 of them being at Vesilahti.\nSee also\n* Battle of Helsinki\n* Battle of Tampere\nReferences"
