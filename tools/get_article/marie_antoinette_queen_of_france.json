The film stars Michèle Morgan and Richard Todd. It was nominated for the Palme d'Or (Jean Delannoy) at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.\nThe film was shot in England and French versions. Richard Todd says Nancy Mitford wrote the English language script.\nIt was shot at the Billancourt Studios in Paris. The film's sets were designed by the art director René Renoux. Todd recalled \"Delannois’ style of direction bothered me. He was most meticulous and had worked out every move and gesture himself prior to rehearsal. This I found inhibiting: I didn’t always feel it natural to move exactly where and when he had done, or to gesticulate as he had in his very Gallic and excitable way. I know that Michéle frequently had the same difficulty; most often we played the scenes our own way in the English version, but tried to follow his instructions in the French one. He was a renowned director and a patient, charming man, but not easy for me to work with.\"\nCast\n*Michèle Morgan as Marie-Antoinette\n*Richard Todd as le comte Axel de Fersen\n*Jacques Morel as Louis XVI\n*Aimé Clariond as Louis XV\n*Jeanne Boitel as Mme Campan\n*Guy Tréjan as La Fayette\n*Marina Berti as a comtesse de Polignac\n* Marcelle Arnold as \tMme.
