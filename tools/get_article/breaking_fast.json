It was to be based on director Mike Mosallam's 2015 short film of the same name, which had screened at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Amin El Gamal, Patrick Sabongui, Christopher J. Hanke, Brian Dare, Aline Elasmar and Veronica Cartwright were also announced as cast members.\nMosallam decided to write the movie after a conversation with fellow screenwriter Michael Lannan, during which he realized there were no characters in movies or television who represented him. He also intended for the movie to be a homage to classic romantic comedies, saying he envisioned the kind of movie that would star actress Julia Roberts \"if, in fact, she was a gay, Muslim, Arab man living in West Hollywood, California.”\nIn March 2020, the film made its debut at California’s Cinequest Film & Creativity Festival. It had subsequent digital screenings at other festivals such as Toronto’s Inside Out Film Festival and San Francisco’s Frameline. In August 2020, it was reported that Vertical Entertainment had acquired the North American distribution rights to the movie.\nIn December 2020, the official trailer was released.
