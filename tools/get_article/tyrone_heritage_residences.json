Although the house was not built until 1912, City of Edmonton Commissioner Arthur G. Harrison resided on that piece of land from 1903 until 1919. Alberta's third Premier Charles Stewart purchased the home in 1920. The home gradually started to be converted into suites beginning in 1927. The building was renamed Tyrone Apartments in 1934.\nArchitecture\nTyrone Place is three storeys in height and features oak hardwood floors throughout the building. Tyrone Place was designed by Canadian architect David Hardie, who is known for having designed a number of other significant buildings in Edmonton such as Sacred Heart Church of the First Peoples, Hilltop House, the Hecla Block and the Armstrong Block. The Alberta Register of Historic Places has stated that \"prior to the Hecla Apartments, Hardie had designed the J.C. McDougall Residence (1912) on 103 Street, the Tyrone Apartments on 99 Avenue and The Armstrong Block (1912) on 104 Street.\"\nNotable residents\nHomeowners\nBeyond its architectural significance, a number of notable individuals resided at Tyrone Place.
