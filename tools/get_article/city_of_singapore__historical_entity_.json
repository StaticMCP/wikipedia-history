Before 1951, the City Council was known as the Municipal Commission, and the area was referred to as the Town of Singapore. Singapore was formally accorded city status by the United Kingdom in 1951.\nThe remainder of the crown colony outside the city was administered by the Singapore Rural Board. The city functioned as the capital of Singapore until its abolishment in 1965. Today, the Central Area, which sits in the south-eastern corner of Singapore, mostly corresponds with what was once the City of Singapore, and the usage of \"Singapore\" now refers to all of the territories under the Republic of Singapore as a city-state.\nHistory\nCreation and subsequent elections\nIn the 1948 and 1951 general elections in Singapore, constituencies were drawn along the boundary of the Municipal Commission and the Rural Board, each area was subdivided into a number of constituencies.\nThe municipality was then conferred with city status by a royal charter from King George VI on 22 September 1951, when Singapore was then a Crown colony. The original Municipal Commission was therefore renamed as the City Council, and the Municipal Building was renamed City Hall.\nBetween the 1957 election and the phasing out of the city, Ong Eng Guan of the People's Action Party (PAP) was the mayor as the leader of the largest party within the City Council. Ong went on to become Minister of National Development under Lee Kuan Yew's premiership.\nDissolution\nAfter the PAP gained power following the 1959 general election and formed the first government after self-government was granted to the Crown colony, the city was phased out, with powers transferred to statutory boards.\nIn 1965, upon Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia, the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965 provided the following clause which empowered the President to abolish the City Council and the Rural Board, with the powers of the local authorities assumed by the Government.\nSee also\n* British overseas cities\n* City status in the United Kingdom\n* George Town, Penang\n* Victoria, Hong Kong\n* List of cities in Malaysia\nNotes\nReferences"
