The MVP was selected by sports writers, broadcasters, coaches, and managers. For most of the NBL's existence, despite the large amount of players and teams alike that played in the league throughout its existence, only two players won the vast majority (66.7%) of the NBL's MVP awards while the NBL existed: Leroy Edwards of the Oshkosh All-Stars from 1938–1940 and Bobby McDermott of the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons from 1942–1946. The only other players to win the MVP award even just once for the NBL were Ben Stephens of the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots, Bob Davies of the Rochester Royals, George Mikan of the Minneapolis Lakers, and Don Otten of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks.\nAs of 2025, among the winners were three future Basketball Hall of Famers: Bob Davies (1970), Bobby McDermott (1988), and George Mikan (1950).\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"| *\n| Inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"|\n| Denotes player whose team won championship that year\n|-\n| Player (X)\n| Denotes the number of times the player had been named MVP at that time\n|-\n| Team (X)\n| Denotes the number of times a player from this team had won at that time\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
