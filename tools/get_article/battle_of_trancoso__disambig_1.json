The city of Viseu was pillaged and burned, but when the Castilians were returning to Castile with their plundered loot and the prisoners they had taken, a Portuguese army met them, dismounted and assumed a defensive formation. The Castilians exhausted themselves in attack but ended up being utterly routed, with very high casualties among their ranks, and with six of their seven captains killed. The Portuguese released all those taken captive by the Castilians and recovered all the pillage taken from their towns.\nSee also\n*History of Portugal\n*House of Avis\n*Nuno Álvares Pereira\n*Hundred Years War\n*Battle of Trancoso (1140)\nNotes\nReferences\n*Jean Froissart, Sainte-Palaye (Jean-Baptiste de La Curne, M. de La Curne de), Chronicles of England, France, Spain, and the adjoining countries,: from the latter part of the reign of Edward II. to the coronation of Henry IV.
