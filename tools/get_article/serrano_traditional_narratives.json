These relationships are particularly evident in the sharing of the distinctive Southern California Creation Myth.\nExamples of Serrano Narratives\nAmerican anthropologist and folklorist Ruth Benedict published 17 myths narrated by Rosa Morongo in the Journal of American Folklore, including the Serrano creation myth.\nSources for Serrano narratives\n* Benedict, Ruth. 1926. \"Serrano Tales\".
