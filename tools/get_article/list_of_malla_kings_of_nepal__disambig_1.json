The Mallas, starting from Aridev Malla in 1201, ruled the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding region which was known as Nepal or Nepal Mandala and the citizens were known as Nepa:mi (in Newari) at that time. In the late 15th century, the Kathmandu Valley was divided into four kingdoms of Bhaktapur (Bhadgaon), Kathmandu (Kantipur), Patan (Lalitpur), and Banepa. The division led to weakening of the dynasty resulted by numerous conflicts among the rulers.\nThe Malla dynasty came to an end in 1769 when Prithvi Narayan Shah of Gorkha invaded the valley, thus inaugurating the Shah dynasty of Nepal.\nMalla rulers of the Kathmandu valley\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Reign\n!Notes\n|-\n|Arideva Malla\n|1201–1216\n|First Malla king.
