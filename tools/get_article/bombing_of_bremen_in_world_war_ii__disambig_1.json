These included the shipyards of Vulkan, AG Weser and Atlas Werke, the Valentin submarine pens, oil refineries and the aircraft works of Focke-Wulf.\nEarly RAF raids on Bremen beginning in May 1940 had sought out these industrial and military targets but the efforts proved costly and, given limited navigation and target-location capabilities, impractical.\nFrom September 1941 the RAF switched to night-time \"area bombing\". In the spring of 1942 new directives from Bomber Command under Air Marshal Arthur Harris formalised the change of strategy. Drawing lessons from the German Blitz on Britain, Bomber Command concluded that rather than being \"collateral damage\", broader bombing raids which also destroyed residential districts served the legitimate purpose of weakening enemy morale.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of area bombing, Bomber Command sought to overwhelm city defences with \"1,000 bomber\" raids. The first of these mounted against Bremen was on 25 June 1942. Six hundred houses were destroyed but civil defence measures kept civilian casualties to 88. Flak and Luftwaffe fighters were able to shoot down 49 RAF bombers. Subsequent attacks were carried out by fewer but improved aircraft, and as Bremen's air-defence depleted (fighter aircraft were redeployed to the eastern front), these caused significantly more damage.\nAt the beginning of 1943, the daytime targeting of industrial and military  facilities returned with the arrival over Bremen of the 8th US Air Force. In the first year, the \"Mighty Eighth\" suffered considerable losses. The German authorities began to evacuate industrial facilities from the city as a precaution.\nOn 8 October 1943, the British began a new wave of heavy night attacks. The heaviest air raid of the entire war hit the city on the night of August 18–19, 1944. In just 34 minutes 274 aircraft dropped 1,120 tons of bombs over the densely built-up west of the city killing 1,059 people, destroying 8,248 residential buildings, and leaving 50,000 homeless.\nThe last Allied air raid hit Bremen on April 22, 1945. Advancing behind a ground barrage, the British 3rd Infantry Division under General Lashmer Whistler entered the city in late April 1945.\nIn just over five years, the Allies carried out a total of 173 air raids on Bremen, dropping 5,513 tons of explosive devices, and killing more than 4,000 residents. In addition to the city center, almost 65,000 houses and apartments were destroyed, corresponding to around 62 percent of the city's residential accommodation. The west of Bremen with the districts of Walle and Gröpelingen was particularly hard hit.\nThe primary military formation tasked with the defense of Bremen's air space was the 8th Flak Division.\nTargets\n* Atlas Werke shipbuilding company\n* Bremen-Oslebshausen railway station\n* Bremer Vulkan shipyard\n* DeSchiMAG (AG Weser) shipyard\n* Focke-Wulf aircraft factory\n* Borgward motor transport plants\n* Korff AG oil refinery\n* Norddeutsche Hütte AG steel mill\n* Valentin submarine pens, - protective shelters built for building U-boats\nIn June 1942, Bremen was the target for the RAF's third \"thousand bomber raid\".\nTimeline\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Bombing of Bremen during World War II\n|-\n!style= width=20%         | Date\n!style=                 | Air force\n!style=class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n|\n|RAF12px\n|24 Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers attacked Bremen oil installations.\n|-\n|\n|RAF\n|No. 15 Squadron RAF used converted Vickers Wellingtons for the first time to bomb the dockyards at Bremen\n|-\n|1941-01-011-2, 2–3, 3–4 January 1941\n|RAF\n|141 aircraft bombed the aircraft factory in the south of the city.

Some of the aircraft attacking alternative targets reached Hamburg, which reports 11 fires and casualties of 5 dead and 12 injured. 3 Wellingtons were lost and one Short Stirling crashed England after being fired at and damaged by a British convoy.\n|-\n|\n|RAF\n|During the Bremen raid, Wing Commander Ken Wallis experimented with marker flares later used by Pathfinder Forces (PFF).\n|-\n|1942-04-088-9 April 1942\n|RAF\n|Following a Hamburg raid, Bremen reports a load of incendiaries dropped very accurately on the Bremer Vulkan shipyard where 4 U-boats and several surrounding buildings were damaged by fire.\n|-\n|1942-06-043-4 June 1942\n|RAF\n|170 aircraft attacked on the first large raid to Bremen since October 1941. 11 aircraft - 4 Wellingtons, 2 Handley Page Halifaxes, 2 Avro Lancasters, 2 Stirlings, 1 Avro Manchester - lost.  Bremen recorded this as a heavy attack, the results of which exceeded all previous raids. Housing areas were heavily hit with 6 streets affected by serious fires. Damage to the U-boat construction yards (Valentin submarine pens) and the Focke-Wulf factory is described as 'of no importance' but there were hits in the harbour area which damaged a pier, some warehouses and the destroyer Z25. 83 people dead, 29 seriously and 229 slightly injured (Bremen's third heaviest casualty toll in the war).\n|-\n|1942-06-2625-26 June 1942 (Operation&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;II)\n|RAF\n|Using every available aircraft in RAF Bomber Command and some of other commands, a thousand-bomber raid was mounted against Bremen. 1,067 aircraft (472 Wellingtons, 124 Halifaxes, 96 Lancasters, 69 Stirlings, 51 Blenheims, 50 Handley Page Hampdens, 50 Whitleys, 24 Douglas Bostons, 20 Manchesters and de Havilland Mosquitos), 102 Lockheed Hudsons and Wellingtons of RAF Coastal Command, and 5 RAF Army Cooperation Command.  Those of No. 5 Group RAF - 142 aircraftbombed the Focke-Wulf factory; 20 Blenheims were allocated to the AG Weser shipyard; the RAF Coastal Command aircraft were to bomb the DeSchiMAG shipyard; all other aircraft were to carry out an area attack on the \"town and docks\".  The limited success was entirely due to the use of GEE, which enabled the leading crews to start marker fires through the cloud cover.  696 Bomber Command aircraft were able to claim attacks on Bremen.  572 houses were completely destroyed and 6,108 damaged. 85 people were killed, 497 injured and 2,378 bombed out. At the Focke-Wulf factory, an assembly shop was completely flattened, 6 buildings were seriously damaged and 11 buildings lightly so. The Atlas Werke, the Bremer Vulkan shipyard, the Norddeutsche Hütte, the Korff refinery, and two large dockside warehouses were also damaged.  48 Bomber Command aircraft were lost (a new record 5% of those dispatched), including 4 which came down in the sea near England from which all but 2 crew members were rescued.  This time, the heaviest casualties were suffered by the OTUs of No. 91 Group RAF, which lost 23 of the 198 Whitleys and Wellingtons provided by that group, a loss of 11.6 per cent. 5 of the 102 Coastal Command aircraft were also lost.\n|-\n|1942-06-2829-30 June 1942\n|RAF\n|144 aircraft - 55 Wellingtons, 39 Halifaxes, 26 Stirlings, 24 Lancasters. 9 aircraft - 4 Wellingtons, 2 Halifaxes, 2 Lancasters, 1 Stirling - lost.  119 aircraft bombed blindly through cloud after obtaining GEE fixes. Bremen records that two of the large firms hit in the recent Thousand raid - the Atlas Werke and the Korff refinery - were damaged again, as well as several smaller firms and dockside warehouses. A hospital and an unrecorded number of houses were also hit. Seven people were killed and eighty injured.\n|-\n|\n|\n|Bremen was added to the USAAF target list.\n|-\n|1943-04-1717 April 1943\n|VIII\n|Mission Number 52: 115 B-17s were dispatched on the Eighth Air Force's largest mission to that date.  63-15-17 Luftwaffe aircraft claimed; 15 B-17s downed by fighters, 1 by flak, 39 damaged; 2 killed in action, 4 wounded in action and 159 missing in action.
