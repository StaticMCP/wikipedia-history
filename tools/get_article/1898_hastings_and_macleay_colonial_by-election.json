Justice William Owen was subsequently appointed to conduct a Royal Commission into allegations concerning Young's conduct during the by-election, The major allegation was that the effect of Young's statements was that as Secretary for Public Works he would favour Smith more than Barton in dealing with the requirements of the electorate. Justice Owen found Young had not abused the powers of his office, however rebuked him for a \"grave indiscretion\" in the way he spoke.\nSee also\n*Electoral results for the district of Hastings and Macleay\n*List of New South Wales state by-elections\nReferences"
