Expedition medicine provides the physical and psychological wellbeing of expedition members before, during, and after an expedition. Expedition medicine may be practiced in support of commercial, non-governmental organizations, and government expeditions. Some medical governing bodies consider expedition medicine as a field within wilderness medicine, whilst others considered it be a separate discipline.\non his 1910 Antarctic expedition]]\nprovided medical training and equipment to the Lewis and Clark Expedition]]\nHistory\nAncient Era\nThis field of expedition medicine has ancient origins and has been practised almost since the advent of medicine and expeditions. Many ancient civilizations embedded medical staff with military units.\nMedieval Era\nAs expedition and merchant crews grew during the later medieval era, barber surgeons and other medical staff were added to the crew complement.\nAge of Discovery\nDuring the Age of Discovery, expedition medicine planning became more integral to explorers on land and sea, especially in the prevention of scurvy. Many explorers traveled with surgeons as part of their crew. Cristopher Columbus's crew included barber surgeons to include Diego Álvarez Chanca. A Genoese barber-surgeon traveled with John Cabot on his 1497 voyage to the coast of North America. Three barber surgeons traveled with the Magellan expedition and one, Hernando de Bustamante, was part of the crew of 18 Castilians who returned on the Victoria, the first ship to successfully circumnavigate the world. David Samwell, a Welsh surgeon, traveled with James Cook on his third and final voyage aboard the HMS Resolution.\nModern Era\nBenjamin Rush provided medical training and equipment to the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\nDr. Mackay, Edgeworth David, and Douglas Mawson at the South Magnetic Pole on 16&nbsp;January 1909]]\nDuring the period of American settlement in the early 19th century, expeditionary medicine preparedness and support became standard concerns for wagon trains.\nIn the late 19th century, the influence of notable medical practitioners like Friedrich von Esmarch and members of the Venerable Order of Saint John pushing for every adult man and woman to be taught the basics of first aid eventually led to institutionalized first-aid courses and standard first-aid kits in the military and eventually in other medically austere locations.\nDuring the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, spanning from 1895 to 1922, at least eighteen expeditions ventured to the icy continent. These arduous journeys typically lasted between eighteen and thirty months, and the majority included one or two doctors within their ranks. Each of the expeditions led by Ernest Shackleton included two surgeons. Seizo Miisho was the expedition medicine physician and crew member of the Japanese Antarctic Expedition of 1910–12. Dr. Alistair Mackay, the assistant surgeon on the British Antarctic Expedition of 1907–1909, is known for being the first person (along with Douglas Mawson and Edgeworth David) to reach the South Magnetic Pole on 16 January 1909.\nMichael Phelps Ward was the expedition doctor on the 1953 first ascent of Mount Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary.\nModern advances, such as the use of remote physiological monitoring devices, have allowed expedition medicine providers to monitor and treat medical situations quickly.\nSee also\n* Wilderness Medicine\n* History of Medicine\n* Battlefield medicine\nReferences\nExternal links"
