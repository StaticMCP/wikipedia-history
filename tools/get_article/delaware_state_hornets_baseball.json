The team competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I and is a member of the Northeast Conference (NEC). Through the 2022 season, the Hornets had competed in the school's full-time home of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), but after that season, the MEAC merged its baseball league into that of the NEC. Delaware State and the three other MEAC members that sponsored baseball became NEC associate members in that sport.\nHead coaches\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n|-\n| 1957–1959\n| Bennie J.
