It trains people with lived experience of homelessness to become walking tour guides in their home cities. Operating across locations such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, York, Cardiff, and most recently Aberdeen, the enterprise provides visitors with immersive tours shaped by personal stories and local heritage. Each guide independently develops a tour theme - from crime and punishment to music history or activism - bringing empathy, fresh perspectives, and untold narratives to visitors looking to explore or rediscover the city, helping guests to see what others don't. Simultaneously, the program fosters confidence, transferable skills, paid employment, and social reintegration for its guides, challenging stigma and reimagining tourism as a platform for dignity and human connection.  The mission of the social enterprise is doing tourism different to create a positive social impact on people, places and community, encouraging people to take diverse and often unheard stories home with them.\nReferences\nwww.invisible-cities.org\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@invisible.cities www.tiktok.com]/@invisible.cities\nwww.instagram.com/invisiblecitiestours\nhttps://www.aberdeenlive.news/news/aberdeen-news/aberdeen-mum-left-homeless-months-10425687\nhttps://royalfoundation.com/prince-william-visits-homewards-aberdeen-to-unveil-new-housing-and-employment-initiatives-to-tackle-homelessness/\nhttps://www.bigissue.com/news/housing/prince-william-homelessness-homewards-aberdeen-invisible-cities/\nhttps://news.sky.com/story/people-who-have-experienced-homelessness-become-walking-tour-guides-as-rough-sleeping-crisis-gets-worse-13276446\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cgk7nz2ynj2o\nhttps://www.smh.com.au/traveller/inspiration/how-an-edinburgh-walking-tour-helps-the-homeless-20241121-p5ksfy.html\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/best-of-the-world-2024-travelers-of-the-year"
