The ward currently forms part of the Croydon Central parliamentary constituency, except for a small area near West Croydon station which is part of the Croydon North constituency. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 16,569.\nThe ward returns three councillors every four years. Fairfield contains Croydon town centre, with its retail and office core. Until 2018, it also contained Park Hill and the Whitgift Estate to the east which is mostly 20th century housing bordering Lloyd Park. These became a separate Park Hill and Whitgift ward in 2018, leading to the Fairfield ward having a radically different character to before. Also found in the ward are Ruskin House, the headquarters of the Croydon Labour Party, and the Fairfield Halls concert hall and arts centre. The Vanguard Way passes along the Fairfield Path.\nconstituency (orange) and the London Borough of Croydon (yellow)]]\nList of Councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election\n!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!
