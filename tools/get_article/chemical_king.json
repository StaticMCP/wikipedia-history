Prior to his debut, Chemical King was mentioned in \"The Adult Legion\" story in Adventure Comics #354 (1967), where his future self is stated to have sacrificed himself to prevent World War VII.

He is a metahuman with the ability to act as a human catalyst and manipulate the speed of chemical reactions.\nIn Chemical King's debut in Adventure Comics #371 (1968), he is a student at the Legion Academy and works undercover to infiltrate the Legion of Super-Villains. In the following issue, Adventure Comics #372, Chemical King graduates from the Legion Academy alongside Timber Wolf and joins the Legion proper.\nChemical King is killed in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #228 (1977) while stopping Deregon, an agent of the Dark Circle, from starting World War VII, facing the same fate as his Adult Legion counterpart.\nPost Zero Hour\nCondo Arlik is resurrected following the 1994 storyline Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!, which reboots the Legion's continuity. He is depicted as a civilian reporter. According to The Definitive Guide to The Characters of the DC Universe (2004), he is in a same-sex relationship with Lyle Norg, the Invisible Kid.\nPost-Infinite Crisis\nThe events of the Infinite Crisis miniseries restore an analogue of the pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths Legion to continuity.

Chemical Kid, whose father used genetic modification to grant him the same abilities as Chemical King. The elder Jamik is later forced to give the same modification to a female criminal named Queega Semk to cover his illegal gambling debts. Semk, now calling herself Alchemical Girl, attempts to force further accommodations out of Jamik, only to be beaten and captured by Chemical Kid and his fellow Academy trainees; Semk's genetic modification is removed by Academy trainee Glorith.

He can speed up or slow down any chemical reaction; for example, he can cause iron to rapidly rust or burst into flames from rapid oxidation. His powers can affect the chemical reactions in the human body, rendering an opponent unconscious from shock, but take several seconds and can only focus on a single opponent at a time. Late in his career, Chemical King displayed the ability to change the rate of energy reactions, causing batteries to lose power and force fields to decay,\nIn other media\n* Chemical King makes a cameo appearance in the Legion of Super Heroes (2006) episode \"Dark Victory\".\n* Chemical King appears in Legion of Super-Heroes (2023), voiced by Eric Lopez.
