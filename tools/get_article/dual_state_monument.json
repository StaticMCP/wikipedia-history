The monument was built in 1931 to mark the centennial of the establishment of the Arkansas-Louisiana state line. It also marks the birthplace of Arkansas governor George Washington Donaghey, who commissioned the monument after his retirement. The monument features Art Deco bas-relief carvings on its east and west sides. The east side features popular modes of transportation in 1831, including a steamboat, stagecoach, and covered wagon. The west side displays a locomotive, automobile, and airplane to represent the modes of transportation common in 1931. The monument was the first Art Deco-inspired sculpture erected in Arkansas.\nThe monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 11, 2000.\nSee also\n* International Boundary Marker: monument on the Louisiana-Texas border\n* OKKAMO Tri-State Marker: monument on the Arkansas-Missouri-Oklahoma tripoint\n* United States Highway 61 Arch: monument on the Arkansas-Missouri border\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Union County, Arkansas\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Union Parish, Louisiana\nReferences"
