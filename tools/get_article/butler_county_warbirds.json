Originally based at the Butler County Regional Airport, after 11 years, the group moved to and opened a museum in the 1938 City Hangar at the Middletown Regional Airport in Middletown, Ohio. The organization's facility is located in the National Aviation Heritage Area and is adjacent to the site of the Aeronca Aircraft factory. Butler County Warbirds is also part of the Aviation Trail.\nThe organization began raising funds to purchase a North American AT-6 Texan in October 2022. Plans call for the profits from rides sold in the airplane to go to an aviation scholarship for women.\nExhibits\nTheir facility inside the 1938 City Hangar includes a  artifact display which houses over 1,800 artifacts from the American Civil War to present day, with a bulk of the collection being from World War II. The display includes an interior recreation of a Nissen hut complete with an officer's bar.\nCollection\n* Aeronca L-3E Grasshopper\n* Fairchild PT-19\n* Fairchild XUC-86A\n* Grumman American AA-5\nPrograms\nThe organization offers rides in three of its aircraft.
