It was bestowed to the participants of the First Franco-Dahomean War (1890) and of the Second Franco-Dahomean War (1892–1894) in order to commemorate their feats of arms.\nIn 1892, France decided to send an expeditionary force of 1,801 Europeans and 1,769 natives under the command of Marine Infantry Colonel Alfred Dodds in response to the harassment of the kingdom of Porto-Novo under its protectorate and its trading posts on the coast of Dahomey by the troops of Behanzin, the king of Abomey.\nThe troops taking part in this expedition, which lasted five months, defeated the 12,000 warrior strong army (including the 2000 women strong Corps of amazons) of Behanzin at Dogba.  France thus reconquered the kingdom of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) and placed at its head, Toffa as the king of Porto-Novo.  King Behanzin was captured in 1893 and deported to Martinique then to Algiers where he died in 1906.\nThe Law of 24 November 1892 instituted the Commemorative Medal of the Dahomey Expedition for award to the officers, sailors and soldiers who took part in this campaign.\nAward statute\nThe Dahomey Expedition commemorative medal was awarded by the President of France on propositions by the minister responsible for the service in which the recipient served.  It was awarded to all officers, sailors and soldiers who served in the Dahomey campaigns.\nAll recipients were to adhere to the code of conduct as set under the Grand chancellor of the Legion of honour.\nPosthumous awards were made to the widow or parents of the recipient.\nNo request for the medal may be made fore service rendered after 5 February 1894.\nThe crews of the following vessels of the French Navy were eligible for the award of the Dahomey Expedition commemorative medal:\n*AMBRE (1 January to 1 March 1894)\n*BRANDON (1 January to 12 February 1894)\n*ÉMERAUDE (1 January to 1 March 1894)\n*MARMET (1 January to 1 March 1894)\n*MÉSANGE (1 January to 1 March 1894)\n*ONYX (1 January to 1 March 1894)\n*OPALE (1 January to 1 March 1894)\n*SEGOND (1 January to 11 February 1894)\n*TOPAZE (1 January to 1 March 1894)\nAward description\nThe Dahomey Expedition commemorative medal was a 30&nbsp;mm in diameter silver medal, its design was from Jean-Baptiste Daniel-Dupuis.
