Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it currently elects four Councillors.\nThe ward's territory lies to the east of the city centre, with the Firth of Forth providing its eastern boundary and Holyrood Park occupying most of its western half. As its name suggests, it covers the communities of Craigentinny and Duddingston, as well as Jock's Lodge, Lochend, Meadowbank, Meadowfield, Mountcastle, Northfield, Piershill, Restalrig and Willowbrae. Originally returning three members, a minor boundary change in 2017 saw the loss of Abbeyhill, Dumbiedykes and Durham neighbourhoods to three other adjoining wards; however the population increased slightly due to the addition of streets south of Restalrig Railway Path (including two tower blocks) and housebuilding in other areas, and due to this an additional councillor was allocated. In 2019, the ward had a population of 29,927.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Gary J Peacock(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Stefan Tymkewycz(SNP)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ewan Aitken(Labour)\n!colspan=2; rowspan=2|3 seats\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Alex Lunn(Labour)\n|rowspan=4|Joan Griffiths(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Alex Staniforth(Greens)\n|rowspan=1|Ian Campbell(SNP)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|John McLellan(Conservative)\n|-\n!2020\n|rowspan=1|Ethan Young(SNP)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Danny Aston(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Ian Whyte(Conservative)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2020 by-election\nOn 21 February 2020, SNP councillor Ian Campbell stood down for health reasons.
