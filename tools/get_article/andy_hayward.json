He turned professional at the age of 24, joining Rotherham United from Frickley Athletic in 1994. He played 120 league games in four seasons before leaving the club in 1998. Whilst at Rotherham he was a part of the team that won the 1996 Football League Trophy Final. While at Rotherham he was lauded for his volleying ability and was considered the best in this regard within the lower leagues of English Professional Football. He has since played for numerous teams in non-league football.\nHe signed for Hednesford Town, and had a brief loan spell with Doncaster Rovers. He then moved on to Barrow in February 1999, and helped the club secure survival in the Football Conference league when he scored the opening goal in a 2–1 win against Kidderminster Harriers on the last day of the season. He returned to his old club Frickley Athletic, before being signed by Bradford Park Avenue in September 2000 for a club record fee. He stayed there for several seasons before moving on to Stalybridge Celtic in March 2004. He stayed there until the summer of 2005, scoring 16 goals in 46 appearances.\nHe went on to play for Ossett Town, playing 53 times and scoring 32 goals, and North Ferriby United. He returned for a third spell at Frickley Athletic, this time as a player-assistant manager before joining Garforth Town.\nHe last played for Royston Railway in the Barnsley Sunday league football and works as a PE instructor at Evolve Academy, a pupil referral unit in Wakefield.\nHayward currently manages his local Sunday League club Royston FC. His greatest managerial accomplishment to date is winning the Wakefield and District Premier Division Cup in a thrilling 1-0 victory over Beechwood WMC in the 2024/24 season.\nHonours\nRotherham United\n*Football League Trophy: 1995–96\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120327064906/http://www.doncasterrovers.co.uk/players/GtoJ/Hayward,Andy.htm Profile] at doncasterrovers.co.uk"
