The royalist army did not press their advantage and did not pursue, and while retreating to the South, they had another encounter which they lost at Suipacha.\nThe successful advance of the Primera Junta's troops continued to the North of Upper Peru and on June 20, 1811, they met again near the Desaguadero River where battle ensued.\nBattle progress\nOn the morning of June 19, the revolutionary army had placed their troops in Guaqui, Caza and Machaca and built a temporary bridge over the Desaguadero River moving 1,200 troops across. The aim was to distract Goyeneche's troops on their front and right flank while surrounding the royalists on their rear through the lines established by this new bridge.\nGeneral Goyeneche decided to do a direct attack with his full force. At three in the morning of June 20, he ordered colonels Juan Ramírez and Pablo Astete, lieutenant colonels Luis Astete and Mariano Lechuga (with 350 cavalry and four cannons) to attack Caza, near the road to Machaca and communication to Guaqui, while he marched towards Guaqui with colonels Francisco Picoaga and Fermín Piérola commanding 300 cavalry, 40 guardsmen and 6 pieces of artillery.\nAt dawn the heights on the hills the royalist troops needed to take were already teeming with revolutionary troops, cavalry and fusiliers who started shooting the Spaniards along with grenades and slingshots. The royalists responded, and within a few hours, made the revolutionaries retreat.\nWhen the independentist troops heard of Goyeneche's advance towards Guaqui, Castelli, Balcarce and Montes de Oca left the town with 15 artillery pieces and 2,000 men and took a strong position on the road to Guaqui between a small lake and the hills behind.\nGoyeneche ordered an advance under enemy fire while colonel Picoaga's battalion covered them with return fire. The independentist troops, recognizing General Goyeneche, directed their fire towards him, and he ordered one of his aides to transmit the order to attack with his right flank, also covering the road with Piérola's battalion and detached three companies to advance on the front while he and the rest of his troops attacked through the left.\nThe Argentine cavalry tried to stop the push but was overrun and fled, along with the whole rebel army towards Guaqui. Goyeneche ordered pursuit and subsequently captured the town. Colonel Ramírez soon after sent a messenger informing them of victory at Caza.\nThe battle ended with the Argentine troops in full retreat, with more than 1,000 men lost and abandoning most of their artillery. In full run they took refuge in Potosí and later on farther south in Jujuy.\nConsequences\nAt the same time, on June 20, 1811, a revolution that was previously prepared, started in Peru. Their leader Francisco Antonio de Zela had agreed with the Argentine troops that while he started the revolution in Tacna, the Argentine army would advance towards Peru to initiate the liberation campaign on that country, but the defeat at Huaqui stopped the plans on Peruvian territory.\nThe bad impression that this defeat caused in Buenos Aires, where they had lost their guns, resulted in González Balcarce and Castelli being relieved of their commands and court-martialed. The defeat also caused a cease-fire in the siege at Montevideo due to the concern in Buenos Aires of being attacked from two fronts at the same time.\nThe independentist's defeat at Huaqui was of such magnitude that the weakness created in the north after the battle forced them to name General Belgrano to take control of the Army of the North and try to re-establish discipline, train the troops and wait for new armament. It forced him to take extreme measures and mobilize Northern Argentina's population in Jujuy Province towards the south before the imminent Spanish offensive. This episode is known in history as the Jujuy Exodus (Spanish:Éxodo Jujeño).\nSee also\n* Battle of Sipe-Sipe\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Díaz Venteo, Fernando.
