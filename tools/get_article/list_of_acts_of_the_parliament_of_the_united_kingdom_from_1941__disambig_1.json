For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n4 & 5 Geo. 6\nContinuing the sixth session of the 37th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 21 November 1940 until 11 November 1941.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 4 & 5 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  until the year nineteen hundred and forty-one.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  and 1940, or the Aliens Restriction Act, 1914, to be removed to and detained in the Isle of Man.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and substitute other provisions for the provisions of paragraph 1 of the Second Schedule to that Act.|note4= }}\n|  to be exercised with respect to certain bodies incorporated by Royal Charter.|note4= }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1940, and the Possession of Mortgaged Land (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1939; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and to make provision for the stabilisation of Supplementary Exchequer Grants, and the continuance of schemes as to health services, during the term of such extension; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  and the Essential Buildings and Plant (Repair of War Damage) Act, 1939. }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  relating to payments in respect of war damage under Part I of that Act to damage occurring after the thirty-first day of August, nineteen hundred and forty-one.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  to prohibit certain advertisements relating to medical matters, and to amend the law relating to medicines.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and to make provision for the stabilisation of Supplementary Exchequer Grants under the said Act; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  as amended by the Local Elections and Register of Electors (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1940, and to make certain amendments of those Acts, including amendments modifying the qualifications of common councilmen of the City of London and the persons entitled to vote at elections of aldermen and common councilmen in the said City and postponing the preparation of ward lists in the said City.|note4= }}\n-\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n|po1=Shipley Order 1940|Provisional Order altering and partially repealing certain local Acts and Provisional Orders.}}\n|\n|  to amend that Act and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to Greenock Port and Harbours.|note4=|po1=Greenock Port and Harbours Order 1941|Provisional Order to authorise the Trustees of the Port and Harbours of Greenock to create a fund for meeting expenditure upon works of repair renewal and maintenance deferred owing to war conditions to authorise the Trustees to levy rates on seaplanes floating docks and similar craft and for other purposes.}}\n| |po1=Land Drainage (Benwick Internal Drainage District) Order 1941|River Great Ouse Catchment Board.}}\n|  with regard to the period within which the consent of a local authority to the continuance of the running of omnibuses under that Act within their district should be obtained to provide that a consent given in accordance with the provisions of this Act shall be deemed to have been given in accordance with and for the purposes of the said Act to make such further provisions as may be incidental to the matters aforesaid and for other purposes.}}\n-\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  and 1924.|note4=|po1=Saint John Baptist Chapel Great Haywood Order|po1short=n|\n|po2=Baptist Church Higham Hill Road Walthamstow and the Tabernacle Greenleaf Road Walthamstow Order|po2short=n|\n|po3=The Saint Leonard Stowell Order|po3short=n|}}\n|\n|\n}}\n5 & 6 Geo. 6\nThe seventh session of the 37th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 12 November 1941 until 10 November 1942.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 5 & 6 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n}}\nSee also\n*List of acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom\nReferences"
