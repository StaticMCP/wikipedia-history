The line led from Bad Ragaz at 520 m to Wartenstein (part of Pfäfers) at 747 m. It was built in 1892 for tourists in the resort Ragaz to access the viewpoint and restaurant at Wartenstein. The line with a length of 790 m had a difference of elevation of 206 m at a maximum incline of 30%. The single-track line with a passing loop used water counterbalancing.\nThe funicular was owned and operated by Actien-Gesellschaft Drahtseilbahn Ragaz-Wartenstein.\nThe line was closed in 1964.\nFrom 2018 to 2022, the association Förderverein Wartensteinbahn attempted to rebuild the funicular. A project with an estimated cost of 9.5 million CHF was developed. The pandemic and a change of ownership of the hotel at the upper station led to the cancellation of the project.\nRemains of tunnels, viaducts, the passing loop are still visible. The lower station was converted into a residential building.\nDrahtseilbahn Ragaz-Wartenstein 1892.jpg|share certificate issued 1892 of Actien-Gesellschaft Drahtseilbahn Ragaz-Wartenstein\nRagaz–Wartenstein Talstation.JPG|lower station (2016)\nBad Ragaz - St. Niklausen Tunnel (6283839559).jpg|St. Niklausen Tunnel (2016)\nPfäfers - Wartenstein Tunnel (26642745393).jpg|Wartenstein Tunnel (2016)\nRagaz–Wartenstein Brücke ow.JPG|viaduct (2013)\nReferences"
