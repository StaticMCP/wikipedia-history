It is also known as the Wolkberg dwarf chameleon, after the Wolkberg range.\nDescription\nThey can be distinguished from their relatives in the genus by their bright colouration, with reds and oranges. They are highly territorial and relatively aggressive towards one another.\nVarieties and relatives\nIn 2003, an ecological impact study near the village of Roossenekal, conducted by BSc Honours students (Centre for Wildlife Management at University of Pretoria) found a new variety of this dwarf chameleon. DNA research from samples collected by R.P. Zoer at the Transvaal Museum (Pretoria) revealed that it is a new variety from the Sekhukhuneland region (Bradypodion transvaalense var. sekhukhunii). A related species found in Ngome Forest, KwaZulu-Natal, is known as the Ngome dwarf chameleon (B. ngomeense).\nReferences\n* Tolley, K. and Burger, M. 2007.
