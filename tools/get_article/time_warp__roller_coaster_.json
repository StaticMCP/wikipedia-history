Manufactured by Zamperla, the ride opened to the public on 2 May 2004. Following Cedar Fair's (merged with Six Flags in July 2024 under the Six Flags name) removal of themes based on Paramount IP from its parks, including Kings Island and Kings Dominion, Time Warp became the last attraction at a Six Flags park to be themed to the Tomb Raider franchise.\nRide description\nThe ride commenced by loading passengers into a four-person car and rotating the cars facing the ground. The vehicles proceed with a horizontal lift and got pushed forward so that they engage with the rotating lift mechanism. The vehicles ascended into a spiral lift that gave riders a 360-degree view of their surroundings.\nOnce vehicles reached the top, they dived down and accelerated before making a quick turn to the left and into the first in-line twist. The ride then turned to the right and into the first set of block brakes that slow the vehicles, before making a small dip downward and another right turn into the second in-line twist. After a quick turn to the left, the vehicles passed into the second set of brakes and then made another diving left turn. There were a few quick turns before the vehicles return to the station. Once the riders were lowered to the standing position, the restraints were unlocked and vehicles were unloaded.\nThe ride drew criticism for several reasons. The restraint system was described as uncomfortable and prone to causing \"headbanging.\" The transitions between the in-line twists, the turns, and the dives have all were criticized as rough. The ride's low capacity due to the complexity of the full body restraint design and the four-passenger trains have were sources of criticism.\nThe ride was abruptly removed from the park's app in February 2025 without explanation. On March 13, 2025, Canada’s Wonderland announced Time Warp was being retired.\nThe ride was quickly demolished and scrapped in late March 2025.\n, the entrance arch and station remain.\nTheme\nThe roller coaster was originally themed to the 2003 Paramount Pictures film Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.\nWhen the ride opened in 2004, the ride's entrance queue featured theming and special effects to resemble an ancient tomb. The entrance sign was mounted on bamboo sticks and stone columns with propane torches. Next to the entrance was a tent that resembled Lara Croft's base with two motorcycles. Beyond the entrance were Chinese stone soldiers akin to the Terracotta Army, as well as a stone wall with images resembling deities found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu artworks. The queue and exit were guided by rope fences. Audio of bat sounds looped while riders waited in the station.\nThe ride area was filled with a rumbling sound that got louder to entice riders. As this happened, flame torches would enlarge. At night, the station's floodlights turned red.\nSince its opening and with the name change after the Cedar Fair takeover, much of the theming has been removed, including the tent and propane torches. The Chinese soldiers inside the queue have been removed, but the stone mural was still present up until the ride's closure in 2024. The rope in the queue lines were replaced by wooden planks.\nSee also\n*Flying roller coaster\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
