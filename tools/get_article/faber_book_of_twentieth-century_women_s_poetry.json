Sixty-four writers born between 1869 (Charlotte Mew) and 1945 (Selima Hill) are represented. Adcock organizes the anthology chronologically according to the birth of each contributor. The poets are mainly from the UK or the US, with several others from Australia (4), Canada (4), Ireland (2), and New Zealand (4), as may be discovered from the appended biographical sketches. Two hundred and twenty-five (225) complete poems or excerpts of longer poems comprise the collection. In the introduction, Adcock argues that there is \"no particular tradition\" to distinguish women's poetry from that of men. She writes, \"What is different about poetry by women, of course, is not its nature but the fact that until recently it has been undervalued and to some extent neglected.\"\nPoets included (in alphabetical order)\nFleur Adcock – Margaret Atwood – Margaret Avison – Elizabeth Bartlett – Patricia Beer – Frances Bellerby – Connie Bensley – Mary Ursula Bethell – Elizabeth Bishop – Louise Bogan – Eavan Boland – Gwendolyn Brooks – Eiléan Ni Chuilleanáin – Amy Clampitt – Gillian Clarke – Jane Cooper – Wendy Cope – Frances Cornford – Elizabeth Daryush – Rosemary Dobson – Freda Downie – Lauris Edmond – U.
