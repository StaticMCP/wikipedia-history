They were cancelled from 2016 onwards to save costs.\nHistory\nSince 1947, The National Union of Students (NUS) have run a student journalism competition of some kind. In 1978, The Guardian joined forces with the NUS for the inaugural NUS/Guardian Student Media Awards.\nIn the early years the competition was modest. Only a handful of categories - for Best Paper, Best Magazine, Best Photographer and Best Journalist existed - along with awards for student radio.\nDuring the 1990s, the individual print categories began to rise exponentially, and today include Reporter, Feature writer, Critic, Sports writer, Diversity writer, Travel writer and Columnist. Meanwhile, the broadcast categories were dropped after the judges consistently reported insufficient quality to yield a shortlist. Other categories added included Publication Design and Website.\nSmall Budget Publication was also added, but it has now been replaced by Student Broadcaster.\nSince 1999, The Guardian and the NUS have run separate student journalism awards. The Guardian's are now simply called the Guardian Student Media Awards. The NUS meanwhile, launched the National Student Journalism Awards, which have been sponsored by The Independent (1999-2002), The Daily Mirror (2003-2005), The Press Association (2006- 2015) and Citizen Training (2016-)\nFormat\nThe Awards are launched in July each year, with a closing date at the beginning of September. Typically students are required to send their best three articles from the past academic year to be critiqued by a panel of senior national journalists. In early November, a shortlist of five entrants per category is printed in Media section of the newspaper. The winners and runners-up in each category, along with an overall student reporter of the year, are announced at a London ceremony at the beginning of December.\nAs of the 2014 awards, submissions were invited in the following categories:\n*A Student publication\n*B Student website\n*C Student reporter\n*D Student feature writer\n*E Student columnist\n*F Student critic\n*G Student photographer\n*H Student digital journalist\n*I Student broadcast journalist\nPrevious winners\nPublication of the Year\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-align: center\"\n|-\n!
