He is the immediate past executive director of Uganda Virus Research Institute.\nCareer\nMbidde began working at the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) in May 1974. In the early 1980s, plans were made for Mbidde to begin leading efforts at the UCI alongside his predecessor, Charles Olweny. However, in 1982, Olweny suddenly left Uganda, went into exile and joined the World Health Organization in Zambia. Mbidde took over as director without a formal handover of leadership. From 1982 through 2004, Mbidde was the sole oncologist in the only cancer center in Uganda. He served as the executive director of the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) until 2004.\nSee also\n* Uganda Cancer Institute\n* Makerere University School of Medicine\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.uvri.go.ug/ Website of Uganda Virus Institute]"
