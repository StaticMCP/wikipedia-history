To elect thirty-five of its thirty-seven pledged delegates, the state was divided into twenty-nine delegate districts based on population and Hubert Humphrey's performance in the state in 1968, which would each nominate a delegate. These twenty-nine delegates would then elect six at-large delegates. Of the twenty-nine delegates elected in May, twenty-three of them were on Wallace's official slate. This victory gave pro-Wallace delegates the ability to determine the six remaining at-large delegates. Six delegates elected from districts and the two ex-officio delegates were considered to be party loyalists. No runoff was needed as all delegates attained more than 50% of votes cast.\nAt the convention, all twenty-three district delegates pledged to Wallace voted for him, as well as one at-large delegate. Nine delegates, all of whom were Black, voted for nominee George McGovern. Five of the Black McGovern delegates were appointed at-large by the Wallace district delegate majority in order to meet the convention's racial diversity quota, as the Wallace district delegation was entirely White. U.S. Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington state and former Governor Terry Sanford of Governor of North Carolina received one vote each, and U.S. Representative Wilbur Mills from Arkansas's 2nd received two.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable tpl-blanktable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Alabama Democratic presidential primary, 1972\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Candidate\n!scope=\"col\" | Votes\n!scope=\"col\" | Percentage\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | George Wallace slate\n| 356,822\n| 61.17%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | \"Regulars\"/\"Loyalists\"\n| 123,346\n| 21.14%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Other Wallace-aligned\n| 16,816\n| 2.88%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Hubert Humphrey\n| 1,863\n| 0.32%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | George McGovern\n| 2,585\n| 0.44%\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Henry M.
