Carter, the Crusaders compiled an 4–6–1 record. Leo Carlin, Ed Kutschke and Tom Patton were the team captains.\nThe Crusaders were briefly ranked in the national top 20, claiming No. 20 in the poll released Oct. 8. They fell out of the rankings after that week, and were not ranked at season's end.\nThis would be Holy Cross' final year as an independent, before joining the Colonial League. Colgate was the only future league football opponent on the Crusaders' 1985 schedule. The league was later renamed Patriot League, and continues to be Holy Cross' home conference as of 2025.\nHoly Cross played its home games at Fitton Field on the college campus in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n| September 21 | @ | UMass\n| Alumni Stadium | Hadley, MA | L 3 27\n| 13,814 |\n| September 28 |   | Delaware\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 22 6\n| 16,111 |\n| October 5 | @ | Dartmouth\n| Memorial Field | Hanover, NH | W 17 14\n| 3,100 |\n| October 12 | @ | Yale\n| Yale Bowl | New Haven, CT | L 15 19\n| 22,439 |\n| October 19 | @ | Connecticut\n| Memorial Stadium | Storrs, CT | L 2 22\n| 5,677 |\n| October 26 |   | Brown^\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | T 20 20\n| 15,461 |\n| November 2 | @ | Army\n| Michie Stadium | West Point, NY | L 12 34\n| 40,236 |\n| November 9 |   | Harvard\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 20 28\n| 14,697 |\n| November 16 |   | Boston University\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 30 9\n| |\n| November 23 | @ | Boston College\n| Alumni Stadium | Chestnut Hill, MA |L 7 38\n| 32,000 |\n}}\nReferences"
