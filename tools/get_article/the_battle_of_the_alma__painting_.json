      "text": "# The Battle of the Alma (painting)\n\nThe Battle of the Alma (French: 'La bataille de l'Alma') is an oil on canvas history painting by the French artist Eugène Lami, from 1855.\nHistory and description\nIt depicts a battle scene from the Crimean War. The Battle of the Alma was fought on 20 September 1854 when an Allied force of British, French and Ottoman troops advancing on Sevastopol defeated a Russian attempt to block them at the River Alma. The French commander Marshal Saint-Arnaud can be seen with his staff. Highland Soldiers of the British Army are on the left of the painting with Zouaves of the French Army on the right. The work was produced while the war was still being fought and was considered the only unambiguous French victory during the campaign so far which meant the regime of Napoleon III placed great emphasis on it. Other prominent French artists Horace Vernet and Hippolyte Bellangé also received commissions to paint the battle.\nThe painting featured at the Salon of 1855, held that year as part of the Exposition Universelle and was acquired by the French government for five thousand francs. It is now in the collection of the Palace of Versailles, having previously been at the Musée du Luxembourg and the Louvre.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Lemoisne, Paul-André.
