In this battle Odia forces led by prince Hamvira Deva under king Gajapati Kapilendra Deva crushed a massive army of Bahmani Muslim forces led by Humayun Shah. The battle ended with Odia victory and thus Devarkonda became a vassal state of Gajapati Empire.\nBattle\nThe Velama chief of Devarakonda (in the present-day Telangana region), Gajaravo Tippa, requested Kapilendra Deva for help against the Bahmani Sultanate. The Velama chiefs of Telangana had angered the Bahmanis by supporting Vijayanagar, their archenemy, in a war against them and the Bahmanis severely devastated the Velama territory.\nIn 1458, a battle ensued at Devarakonda in which the Orissan army advanced upon them, while the Velamas launched an attack from within the fort. Trapped between these two forces, the Bahmani army suffered a crushing defeat. Their baggage, elephants, and horses were seized as spoils. The Muslim forces were chased for a distance of approximately three jarsakhs, with nearly six to seven thousand cavalry soldiers killed. Many others succumbed to thirst while crossing the arid deserts. Subsequently, he took control of the Khammam Fort and placed the governor of Rajahmundry and his cousin, Raghudeva Narendra Mohapatra, in charge.\nAftermath\nAs a result of this battle Odia forces came out as victorious and Telangana region became a feudal state of the Gajapati empire with the Velama chiefs as the vassal rulers. The victory over the Bahmani Sultanate forces at Devarakonda in 1458 CE enabled Kapilendra Deva to assume the title of Kalavargeśvara which meant the Lord of Kalaburagi.\nIn 1460, an inscription at Warangal fort tells of Hamivradeva Kumara Mahapatra capturing it, being Kapilesvara Maharaya's son.\nKapilendra ruled most of Telangana. He knew the Bahmanis wouldn't accept losing territory and wanted to weaken them forever.\nAccording to Ferishta, this battle happened around 1459. The Bahmanis didn't try to take Telangana while Kapilendra lived. Muslim historians had to explain why the Bahmani army was defeated and why Humayun Shah failed to restore its honor.\nHumayun Shah died in 1461. His eight-year-old son Nizam Shah succeeded him, ruling from 1461 to 1463.\nSee also\n*Gajapati Empire\n*Vijayanagara Empire\n*Kapilendra Deva\n*Deva Raya II\n*Bahamani Sultanate\nReferences\nSources\n*"
