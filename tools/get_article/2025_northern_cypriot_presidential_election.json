Incumbent president Ersin Tatar was defeated by Tufan Erhürman of the Republican Turkish Party (CTP), who received 63% of the vote.\nBackground\nEconomic crisis\nIn 2022, Northern Cyprus was affected by the devaluation of the Turkish lira as a result of the Turkish economic crisis. The increase in exchange rates increased import costs and fuelled inflation. In particular, food inflation reached 99%, reaching the highest level since the 1990s. The Russian invasion of Ukraine also negatively affected the TRNC by increasing energy and commodity prices.\nThe high level of inflation has seriously reduced the purchasing power of the people, making it difficult to access basic necessities. Economic pressures have also affected family structure; an increase in divorce rates has been observed.\nThe government sought economic support through financial protocols signed with Turkey. However, opinions differ on the effectiveness of these protocols.\n2025 protests\nIn 2025, there was a wide public outcry after middle school student İkra Şimşek was not allowed into school because she was wearing a headscarf. Following this incident, the government published a regulation in the Official Gazette on 8 April 2025, on the grounds that it would eliminate a legal gap regarding the headscarf, and put it into effect. Although this decision was considered by some as a guarantee of individual freedoms, concerns that the principle of secularism was being eroded triggered social opposition.\nThe beginning of the protests was announced at a press conference held on 4 April, led by the Cyprus Turkish Teachers' Union (KTÖS) and the Cyprus Turkish Secondary Education Teachers' Union (KTOEÖS). At this meeting, it was emphasized that they would not remain silent against political interventions targeting secular education and social structure, and it was announced that a large-scale action would be held with the participation of nearly 40 organizations.\nThe participation of the children of the founding leaders of Northern Cyprus, Fazıl Küçük and Rauf Denktaş, in the protests revealed that the defense of secularism was not limited to left-wing groups, but also found a response in nationalist circles that are sensitive about historical identity and independence. The slogan \"Cyprus will stay secular\" came to the fore during the protests.\nElectoral system\nPresidential elections are held directly with universal suffrage and by secret ballot. Every citizen over the age of 18 has the right to vote. Presidential elections are held every 5 years. The minimum age for the presidency is set at 35. In the TRNC, a candidate participating in the election must receive an absolute majority of the valid votes cast to be elected president. If none of the candidates receive an absolute majority, the election is renewed after 7 days between the two candidates who receive the most votes and the candidate who receives the most votes is elected as the new president.\nCandidates\nNational Unity Party\nOn 2 June 2025 the Democrat Party and the Rebirth Party held an event called \"Common Sense Consensus\" to support President Ersin Tatar's second-term candidacy. These three parties stated that they would partner for the next presidential election.\nThe statement emphasized the importance of Turkish Cypriots defending their sovereignty in the face of the Greek Cypriot side's uncompromising stance and stated that Tatar's two-state solution policy reflects the will of the people. In his speech, President Tatar expressed his determination to promote the TRNC internationally and the need to strengthen the understanding of national unity.\nTatar also had the support of the Turkish government.\nRepublican Turkish Party\nOn 6 April 2025 the Republican Turkish Party Assembly unanimously voted for Chairman Tufan Erhürman as its presidential candidate. This decision was later approved by the party congress. Erhürman received support not only within the party but also from independent members of parliament. He announced his candidacy on social media, emphasizing a presidential approach that would represent the integrity of the people.\nMehmet Harmancı, the strongest potential candidate for the Communal Democracy Party, called for his party to not field a candidate in the elections and support CTP candidate Tufan Erhürman.\nMünür Rahvancıoğlu said that Independence Path might not field a candidate if only Erhürman and Tatar compete but in the end, the party refused to endorse him. İzzet İzcan of the United Cyprus Party avoided endorsing Erhürman directly but stated that they \"support candidates who advocate for peace against those who uphold the status quo\" and acknowledged the common views with Erhürman.\nCyprus Socialist Party\nThe party's Central Committee released a written statement announcing its decision to run its own candidate in the elections. During the nomination process, Osman Zorba, a member of the party's Central Committee, was selected as the presidential candidate, and the candidacy was announced to the public.\nIndependent candidates\nMehmet Hasgüler and Arif Salih Kırdağ announced that they would participate in the elections as independent candidates. Although it was claimed that Serdar Denktaş would also be a candidate due to a statement he made on July 18, 2024, he did not announce his candidacy.\nOn October 18, the Supreme Election Council (YSK) announced that Hüseyin Gürlek applied to the Supreme Election Council and announced his withdrawal from the presidential candidacy. In accordance with the Election and Referendum Law, the name of the withdrawn candidate continued to appear on the ballot. Hüseyin Gürlek announced he withdrew in favor of Ersin Tatar.\nConfirmed\nThe final candidate list announced by the YSK is as follows:\n* İbrahim Yazıcı – Independent\n* Osman Zorba – Cyprus Socialist Party\n* Ersin Tatar – Independent\n* Arif Salih Kırdağ – Independent\n* Mehmet Hasgüler – Independent\n* Tufan Erhürman – Republican Turkish Party\n* Ahmet Boran – Independent\n* Hüseyin Gürlek – Independent\nCampaign\nTatar supported the continued division of Cyprus into two separate states while Erhurman supported a resumption of negotiations with Greek Cypriots towards a binational Cypriot federation and criticized Tatar's hardline stance for isolating the Turkish Cypriot community internationally.\nOpinion polls\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; line-height:14px;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:115px;\" |Fieldwork date\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:115px;\" |Polling firm\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Sample size\n! style=\"width:4em;\" |Erhürman\n! style=\"width:4em;\" |Siber\n! style=\"width:4em;\" |Tatar\n! style=\"width:4em;\" |Özersay\n! style=\"width:4em;\" |Manavoğlu\n! style=\"width:4em;\" |Harmancı\n! style=\"width:4em;\" |Denktaş\n! style=\"width:4em;\" |Arıklı\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:4em;\" |Others\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:4em;\" |Lead\n|-\n! style=\"background:#008000; width:40px;\" |\n! style=\"background:#008000; width:40px;\" |\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0; width:40px;\" |\n! style=\"background:#EB1512; width:40px;\" |\n! style=\"background:#EB1512; width:40px;\" |\n! style=\"background:#0000CD; width:40px;\" |\n! style=\"background:#DC241F; width:40px;\" |\n! style=\"background:#00CCFF; width:40px;\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Election results\n! 141,615\n! style=\"background:#65EA82\" | 62.76\n! –\n! 35.81\n!–\n!–\n!–\n!–\n!–\n! 1.43\n! style=\"background:#008000; color:white;\" | 26.95\n|-\n|4 Oct\n|[https://cyprus-mail.com/2025/10/04/turkish-cypriot-poll-puts-tatar-ahead-as-pollsters-diverge-ahead-of-election?utm_source=chatgpt.com Public Global]\n|1,516\n|47.90\n|–\n| style=\"background:#DDDDDD\" |51.20\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|0.90\n| style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" |3.30\n|-\n|2 Oct\n|[https://cyprus-mail.com/2025/10/02/erhurman-leads-by-10-per-cent-in-latest-turkish-cypriot-election-poll?utm_source=chatgpt.com CMIRS]\n|500\n| style=\"background:#65EA82\" |50.40\n|–\n|40.60\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|9.00\n| style=\"background:#008000; color:white;\" |9.80\n|-\n|Sep–Oct\n|[https://cyprus-mail.com/2025/09/12/erhurman-leads-tatar-in-latest-turkish-cypriot-election-poll?utm_source=chatgpt.com GENAR]\n|~200\n|40.01\n|–\n| style=\"background:#DDDDDD\" |41.80\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|18.10\n| style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" |1.79\n|-\n|August\n|[https://bugunkibris.com/2025/09/11/anketten-degisim-cikti-erhurman-tatara-fark-atti/ CMIRS]\n|500\n| style=\"background:#65EA82\" |51.63\n|–\n|46.64\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|1.74\n| style=\"background:#008000; color:white;\" |4.99\n|-\n|April\n|[https://cyprus-mail.com/2025/04/14/tatar-overtakes-erhurman-in-turkish-cypriot-election-polling?utm_source=chatgpt.com CMIRS]\n|500\n|33.80\n|–\n| style=\"background:#DDDDDD\" |35.10\n|6.60\n|–\n|5.80\n|4.50\n|6.20\n|8.00\n| style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" |1.30\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |4 April\n! colspan=\"10\" |Anti-government protests broke out across TRNC.\n|-\n|8–21 Mar\n|[https://www.dijigazete.net/genarin-kktc-anketinin-sonuclari-tatar-yuzde-379-erhurman-yuzde-36 GENAR]\n|200\n|36.00\n|–\n| style=\"background:#DDDDDD\" |37.90\n|6.80\n|–\n|7.00\n|4.60\n|7.10\n|0.60\n| style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" |1.90\n|-\n|March\n|[https://bugunkibris.com/2025/04/14/cmirs-mart-2025-anketi-erken-secim-senaryosunda-ctp-az-farkla-onde/ CMIRS]\n|500\n|33.83\n|2.34\n| style=\"background:#DDDDDD\" |35.11\n|6.60\n|1.91\n|5.74\n|4.47\n|6.17\n|3.93\n| style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" |1.28\n|-\n! colspan=\"13\" |2025\n|-\n|December\n|[https://www.kibrispostasi.com/c35-KIBRIS_HABERLERI/n547127-cmirs-anketi-ctp-liderligini-korudu CMIRS]\n|500\n| style=\"background:#65EA82\" |34.56\n|2.59\n|29.81\n|7.99\n|4.54\n|8.21\n|2.16\n|5.18\n|4.96\n| style=\"background:#008000; color:white;\" |4.75\n|-\n|September\n|[https://bugunkibris.com/2024/10/16/cmirs-eylul-2024-anketi-siyasi-partilerde-ctp-cumhurbaskanliginda-erhurman-one-cikti/ CMIRS]\n|500\n| style=\"background:#65EA82\" |38.08\n|2.34\n|37.02\n|3.19\n|2.77\n|9.36\n|1.91\n|3.19\n|2.14\n| style=\"background:#008000; color:white;\" |1.06\n|-\n|June\n|[https://www.kibrispostasi.com/c35-KIBRIS_HABERLERI/n526418-cmirs-anketi-ctp-ve-tufan-erhurman-secmenlerin-yuzde-30dan-fazlasinin-tercihi CMIRS]\n|500\n| style=\"background:#65EA82\" |36.21\n|2.27\n|29.83\n|7.61\n|3.08\n|7.82\n|5.14\n|4.73\n|3.31\n| style=\"background:#008000; color:white;\" |6.38\n|-\n! colspan=\"13\" |2024\n|}\nResults\nThe turnout was 64.87% of registered voters.
