Its purpose is recognition and support of the nation's war veterans and victims, and directing national policy about war memorials and remembrances.\nThe current agency is the successor to the veteran's organisation first set up in 1916 during the First World War. It underwent several mergers with related veterans and war victims organisations. Its charter was expanded to include victims of terrorist incidents following the November 2015 Paris attacks.\nHistory\nThe first office to be created was the National Office of Disabled and Discharged War Veterans created by ministerial decree on 2 March 1916, during the First World War. At the outset the latter was an interagency autonomous public institution managed by a board of directors. The law of 2 July 1917 established the  which in France is a minor person, such as an orphan, under the care and responsibility of the French state.}} and that of 19 December 1926 created the National Soldiers Office. During the years 1933 and 1934, successive mergers of the three organisations created the National Office of Veterans, Disabled, War Victims, and Wards of the Nation. In 1946 this organisation took over the management of social services of the Ministry of Prisoners, Deportees and Refugees and was renamed the National Office of Veterans and Victims of War. Since 1991, it also handles assistance to victims of terrorism.\nGoals and responsibilities\nMemorial to French soldiers lost at Charleroi ]]\nThe Office has three goalsː\n* Recognition on behalf of the Nation towards people affected by the war. It allocates recognition of their status and to the entitlements that go along with it via local services, id cards, and documents.\n* Social action, as expressed by administrative assistance, by implementation of the status of Ward of the Nation by financing the cost of professional retraining, and by assistance for French citizens living abroad.\n* Operation of the policy of memorials and historical preservation developed by the Armed Forces.
