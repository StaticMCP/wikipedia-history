The song features British Nigerian rapper Tinie Tempah. The song was released as a single on 27 January 2013 and later peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart.\nMusic video\nA lyric video to accompany the release of \"Drinking from the Bottle\" was first released onto YouTube on 2 December 2012 at a total length of four minutes and one second. The official video was uploaded to Harris's YouTube's account on 21 December, after being filmed in the first week of December 2012.\nThe video opens with actor Brad Dourif, as The Devil, speaking to his friend \"Patrick\" (Vader Vader) lead singer, Pat-Ric (McCaffery) Nasty, who is dressed as a wizard), talking about how he had sex with Joan of Arc in 1430, just a few months before her burning at the stake. The rest of the video features Harris and Tempah in a dark room with scantily-clad women, with Harris sitting inside a car and Tempah outside it. There are also scenes of drinking, drugs, violence, arson, sex, twerking and nudity, as well as Harris and Tempah meeting up with the devil. The video was accompanied by a parental advisory explicit content sign for extremely sexually explicit content and some strong language.\nCritical reception\nRobert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars and wrote, \"With lyrics about necking booze from buckets with sparklers, name-checking Rihanna, the Kardashians and, erm, Danny DeVito as well as a ravey breakdown that you could set your watch to, they've ticked all the necessary boxes for an easy chart hit. 'I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow,' he continues, prompting our weary response: 'Go on then, one last time won't hurt us... right?'.\"\nLive performances\nHarris and Tempah gave their first live performance of \"Drinking from the Bottle\" on The Jonathan Ross Show on 3 November 2012.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Lead vocals&nbsp;– Patrick Okogwu\n* Guest vocals&nbsp;– Calvin Harris, Tinie Tempah\n* Producers&nbsp;– Calvin Harris, James F.
