CommonGround Software supports shared-decision making in behavioral health. It brings the voice of the individual to the center of the care team. In this way, the team can focus on \"what matters to you\" rather than \"what's the matter with you?\"\nPeople diagnosed with mental health disorders are often faced with complex treatment options. Shared decision making can be useful when medical evidence does not suggest a clearly optimal treatment path. The program makes use of shared decision making to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of consultations, and has led to higher levels of satisfaction among clients.\nHistory\nCommonGround was first implemented by Patricia Deegan in 2006 in conjunction with the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services.\nProviders can license the software for a monthly and yearly fee, which varies according to the number of users.\nAward and nomination\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150724212412/http://www.scattergoodfoundation.org/2013-award Winner of the 2013 Innovation Award] of the Scattergood Foundation\n* [http://web.archive.org/web/20210505130335/https://www.changemakers.com/empower-patient/entries/commonground-shared-decision-making Finalist at the \"Patients  Choices  Empowerment\" competition] of Ashoka Changemakers\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://web.archive.org/web/20170218115426/https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/shared-decisionmaking-tools-plus-peer-support-lead-more-efficient-and-effective-mental CommonGround innovation profile] at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality"
