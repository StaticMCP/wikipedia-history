She began working at the West London Hospital in Maida Vale and at Pembury in Kent, helping traumatised men to speak.\nShe left the West End Hospital school in 1935 to spend time in South Africa. When she returned to London in the late 1930s she was unable to resume her old post and took steps to set up a different course in conjunction with a former student, Amy Swallow. Ward was instrumental in setting up the London hospitals school of speech therapy (later called the Kingdon-Ward school of speech therapy), which was founded in 1942 in Cavendish Square.\nShe was a founder fellow of the College of Speech Therapists now the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. She wrote several books on the subject of speech therapy, as well as poems for children and poems specifically for use in teaching aspects of speech. Her 1941 work on stammering was the first major text on the subject in the British literature and was one of the earliest works on any topic in the field. She was one of the first authorities to recognise that there are different types and causes of stammering and she maintained that therapists should adapt their approach accordingly.\nPersonal life\nWinifred was the sister of Francis Kingdon Ward and was also known as Winifred Kingdon-Ward by association. She died in the St Charles Hospital, Kensington, London, on 26 January 1979.\nSelect publications\n*1941. Stammering: a Contribution to the Study of its Problems and Treatment.\n*1954.
