Cane tramways pass through the south of the locality to transport the harvested sugarcane to the Pioneer sugar mill.\nHistory\nIn 1881, the success of sugarcane growing in the Burdekin district and the navigability of Barratta Creek from the Coral Sea via Bowling Green Bay resulted in a proposal to establish a town and a port along Barratta Creek. In 1885, the Queensland Government had surveyed a town site called Noondoo and offered over 100 town lots for sale. On 25 September 1897, the town's name was changed to Baratta by notification in the Queensland Government Gazette and then to Barratta (two \"r\"s) on 21 March 1902. Barratta is believed to be an Aboriginal name for the chain of lagoons in the area. However, no port was established and the town did not develop. The town remains officially in existence, but, as at 2024, is being used as grazing land.\nIn February 1918, extensive flooding in the region affected Barratta Creek with over  of water flowing over the railway bridge crossing the creek.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Barratta had a population of 69 people.\nIn the , the locality of Barratta had a population of 85 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Barratta.
