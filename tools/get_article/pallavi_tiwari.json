Her research considers the development of computer algorithms to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of disease. She was elected Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors.\nEarly life and education\nTiwari is from India. She said that her parents always encouraged her to study science, and valued higher education. She attended the Kendriya Vidyalaya high school, and moved to the Shri Govindram Seksaria Institute of Technology and Science for undergraduate studies. She became inspired by biomedical engineering whilst she was at college, developing wearable technologies to help people with visible impairments. She moved to Rutgers University for her doctoral research, where she worked with a surgeon to analyze human error in surgery.\nResearch and career\nAt Case Western Reserve University, Tiwari built machine learning algorithms that could accelerate the diagnosis of disease from medical images. In particular, Tiwari creates artificial intelligence tools to assess magnetic resonance imaging data and determine whether body tissue contains malignancies. At Case Western, she served as Director of the Brain Image Computing (BrIC) Laboratory.\nTiwari joined the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2022, where she was made co-director of the UW Carbone Cancer Center.\nAwards and honors\n* 2018 Crain's Business Cleveland Forty Under 40\n* 2020 Johnson & Johnson Women in STEM2D Scholars Award\n* 2021 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine\n* 2023 Elected Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors\nSelected publications\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
