At his death in 2015 he held the record for the youngest ever recipient of the  award.\nAccording to  The Daily Telegraph, Davis aged 16 was already used to climbing bomb damaged and dangerous buildings in post World War II London.  He was walking near Borough High Street in Southwark when he saw a group of people screaming  at a toddler leaning out of an open 6th floor window 80 feet above street level.  No one had gone into the building and the child was clearly in imminent danger so Davis ran up the stairs and attempted entry to the flat. When this proved impossible he made climbed onto the roof of the building before making a perilous 10 foot drop onto the back balcony.  His story made headlines and the Bishop of Southwark  presented  his medal on 30 May  1949.  He was also awarded the Carnegie Hero Fund Trust bronze medal though he was always extremely reticent about discussing his deed.\nNotes"
