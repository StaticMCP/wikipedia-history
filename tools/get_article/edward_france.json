He was the nephew of William France Snr and older brother of William France Jnr, both of whom were cabinetmakers to the Royal Household. He was born in 1748 and died in 1777. He was made a Freeman of Lancaster in 1773–74.\nEarly career\nEdward France was born in 1748 in Lancaster, the son of cabinetmaker John France. He worked with his Uncle, William Snr, as an apprentice from 1766 until 1768 and continued working for him until his Uncle died.\nIt is also recorded that Edward France & Co, Upholders of London were paid £12 12s on 3 July 1766 by the Duke of Portland for work done at Burlington House.\nRoyal warrant\nAlthough the Royal Family favoured awarding the royal warrant to succeeding generations of a tradesman's family, this did not happen after the death of Edward's uncle William in 1773. As John (Edward's father) was not an upholsterer and Edward, at twenty four, too young to take on the appointment of what was one of the largest suppliers of goods to the Royal Household, William Farnborough was appointed in William's stead.\nAt this time Edward was working out of 101 St Martin's Lane, Charing Cross, London as an Upholsterer and Cabinet Maker when he was admitted as a Freeman of Lancaster, 1773–74, when stated 'of Westminster'.\nUnfortunately, John France did not survive his brother for long, dying in 1775. His two sons Edward and William succeeded to the business.\nEven then it is Edward France's name alone that is recorded c 1775, as supplying furniture for the state rooms at Erddig Park, Clwyd.\nHowever Edward's brother William Jnr subsequently went into partnership with Samuel Beckwith, to form 'France & Beckwith', as Edward France had died in 1777.\nThe name of the firm appears in the Royal Household bills until the end of the century, and their trade card \"France and Beckwith Upholsterers and Cabinet makers to His Majesty, no 101 St Martin’s Lane\", is dated 1803.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.burlingtonhouse.org Burlington House]\n* [https://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/smirkesydney/3c.html The Victorian Web]\n* [http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/erddig Erddig Hall – National Trust]\n* [http://www.hevac-heritage.org/items_of_interest/heating/national_trust_properties/erddig_hall/erddig_hall.htm Erddig Hall, Wrexham]\n* [http://www.friendsofkenwood.org.uk/pdffolder/Friends%20Donor%20leaflet.pdf Friends of Kenwood Newsletter1 - Original Window Seat]\n* [https://www.friendsofkenwood.org.uk/what-we-funded.html Friends of Kenwood Newsletter2 - Restored Window Seat]"
