It was part of the Palace Group- a company associated with film and video distribution- and was itself notable for the Barbarian and Cauldron series of games for 8-bit home computer platforms, in particular the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. Palace caused some controversy with its advertisements in computer magazines, particularly for Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax which featured Page Three girl Maria Whittaker as a scantily clad female warrior.\nPalace's developers included artist Steve Brown and musician Richard Joseph.\nIn 1991, the Palace Group sold Palace Software to Titus France.\nNotable releases\n*The Evil Dead (1984)\n*Cauldron (video game) (1985)\n*Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back (1986)\n*The Sacred Armour of Antiriad (1986)\n*Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior (1987)\n*Stifflip & Co.
