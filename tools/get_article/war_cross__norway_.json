It is awarded for extraordinary brave actions or extraordinary leadership during combat. A recipient deemed worthy of additional citations will receive up to an additional two swords on the medal ribbon in addition to the \"standard\" single sword. Additional citations are rare: Gunnar Sønsteby is the only person to have received the War Cross with three swords (more appropriately known as \"War Cross with sword and two swords\").\nHistory\nThe medal was established on 23 May 1941 by royal resolution of King Haakon VII, who was in London with the government in exile due to the German occupation of Norway. At that time, \"royal\" awards were made (to members of the British Royal family for example) and awards could be made for meritorious activities not associated with combat (extraordinary achievements or contributions for Norway's cause and war effort): these were made without the sword. The statutes were amended on 18 May 1945, restricting awards to the actions of military personnel in combat situations, thus all subsequent decorations would to be \"with sword\". At the same time, Haakon VII's Freedom Cross was established to replace the War Cross for civilian achievements.\nAwards of the War Cross ceased in 1949, but on 26 June 2009 the statutes were again revised to permit awards for actions after 1945.\nIn 2022, the Norwegian Armed Forces commissioned Marcus Paus to write a major work to tell the stories of the War Cross recipients. The Armed Forces said the idea is that the work will be a major \"identity-building and unifying\" work for the armed forces.\nRecipients\nSince its inception, the War Cross has been awarded to 126 non-Norwegians. These awards were mostly for actions during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940.\nThe number of recipients from various nations:\n*66 France (mostly French Foreign Legion and Chasseurs Alpins).\n*42 UK (including a gracious award to their Majesties, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, King Haakon's host and hostess \"for the duration\").\n*13 Poland (the Polish Independent Highland Brigade).\n* 2 US.\n* 1 Denmark (but serving with the Royal Norwegian Air Force).\n* 1 Greece (a \"courtesy award\" to his kinsman George II, King of the Hellenes).\n* 1 Canada (serving with the Royal Engineers).\nCanadian recipient\nGazetted 11 August 1942 while serving with the British Army:\n*Lt (temp Capt) Harry FitzGibbon Boswell, Royal Engineers (RE) (later Col & OBE)\nNorwegian recipients\n*Gunnar Sønsteby (with three swords) for his work as a Norwegian resistance fighter during World War II.\n*Lieutenant Max Manus (with two swords) for his work as a Norwegian resistance fighter during World War II.\n*Leif Larsen (with two swords).\n*Oluf Reed-Olsen for his work as a Norwegian resistance fighter during World War II.\n*Erik Gjems-Onstad for his work as a Norwegian resistance fighter during World War II.\n*Hugo Munthe-Kaas for his efforts in Operation Upsilon III during World War II.\n*Colonel Birger Eriksen for his command of the Oscarsborg Fortress in the Battle of Drøbak Sound.\n*Captain Martin Linge (with one sword) for his command of the Norwegian Independent Company 1\n*Boy Rist for outstanding efforts during the execution of special missions, as Leader for Polar Bear 1, Narvik.\n*Eiliv Austlid was awarded the citation on 2 October 2009, for actions in April 1940, settling a case that had been discussed in the press for some time. The new award raised the total number of persons awarded The War Cross to 275 and the total number of awards, which includes seven French military colours, to 282. It has been revealed that at least one soldier is being considered for the award after action with the International Security Assistance Force in the Afghanistan war.\n*Lieutenant Commander Trond André Bolle was awarded the War Cross with Sword (posthumously) on 21 January 2011. The decision was announced by the Minister of Defence, Grete Faremo, shortly after the cabinet session the same day. Lt. Cmdr. Bolle receives the award for his actions and behaviour during his command of the Norwegian Special Operations Force Task Group II in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan's Helmand province from October 2005 to February 2006. According to the Minister of Defence, Lt. Cmdr Bolle performed \"above and beyond the call of duty\" on numerous occasions during this period, his leadership was described as \"exemplary\". Lieutenant Commander Trond André Bolle was killed in action on 27 June 2010, in an IED incident in Afghanistan's Faryab province. Three other soldiers, Christian Lian, Simen Tokle and Andreas Eldjarn were also killed in the incident, which happened on the road between Khwaja Gawhar (35.92n, 64.2875E) and Almar Bazar (35.846N, 64.53e).
