This Thangal was constructed by Velandi Vathiyar of Agastheeswaram who was a friend of Sakadevan Citar, one among the five disciples of Vaikundar. He earned his name Vathiyar because he conducted platform-school to educate poor children. He along with other devotees, with carol songs, carries Ayya in a cradle to Agastheeswaram from Chettikudiyiruppu.\nThere Ayya blessed many people guilt-conscience who were once tried to scare and chase Vaikundar who was then on his '' 'Desa-sanjara'  (travel from place to place). He also redeemed them using Patham and Namam. Then he laid stone for the second Thangal. Then a structure was raised there with palm-leaves and Ukappadippu and Ucchippadippu was conducted regularly. A man named  'Sukkirar'  accepted that he will be in charge of lighting the lamp daily. So it was also called Sukkirar pathi.\nSee also\n* Pathi\n* Nizhal Thangal\n* Worship centers of Ayyavazhi\nReferences\n* K. Amalan, Ayya Vaikundar Punitha Varlaru, Akilam Pathippakam, 2000.\n* G.
