      "text": "# Beetle Monuments\n\n}}\nThe Beetle Monuments (Polish: Pomniki chrząszcza) are two similar monuments in Szczebrzeszyn, Poland, statues of an amphomorphic beetle wearing a dinner suit and a top hat, and playing on a fiddle.\nThe monuments allude to the Polish tongue twister poem Chrząszcz by Jan Brzechwa, which the town is widely associated with among the Poles. Its first line reads: W Szczebrzeszynie chrząszcz brzmi w trzcinie (translation: In Szczebrzeszyn a beetle buzzes in the reeds).\nIn fact, the statues present an insect from the orthoptera order (grasshopper or a cricket), rather than a beetle, a subject of a trick question at the game show Milionerzy (a Polish version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?) .\nFirst monument\nIn September 2002, at Klukowskiego Street in Szczebrzeszyn, at the foot of the Castle Hill, a statue was unveiled of an amphomorphic beetle playing on a fiddle. It is made from linden wood and placed on a stone pedestal. It has a height of 3 m and width of 1 m. It was created by students of the Zamość Liceum of Arts under the supervision of professor Zygmunt Jarmuł. It is located near the  Street by the source of a spring flowing to the nearby Wieprz river.\nSecond monument\nSince wood is a perishable material, the city of Szczebrzeszyn commissioned Zygmunt Jarmuł to create a more durable statue of a beetle. It was unveiled by the Szczebrzeszyn  ratusz (town hall)  at the market square (part of the Kościuszko Square) on 23 July 2011. It consists of a bronze statue of an anthropomorphic beetle wearing a dinner suit and a top hat, and playing on a fiddle. It has a height of about 2 m. It was 70% funded by the EU through the initiative \"Z kulturalną wizytą w chrząszczowym grodzie\" (\"On a cultural visit to the beetle town\").\nReferences"
