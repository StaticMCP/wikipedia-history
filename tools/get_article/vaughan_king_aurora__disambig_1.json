It was subsequently renamed \"Vaughan—King—Aurora\".\nIt existed only for the 1997 and 2000 elections.\nIt was abolished in 2004, as ridings in York Region were redistributed due to its fast-growing population. The riding was redistributed into Newmarket—Aurora, Oak Ridges—Markham, and Vaughan ridings.\nProvincial riding\nThe provincial riding of Vaughan—King—Aurora was created before the 1999 election when Ontario provincial electoral districts were redefined to be the same as the federal districts. Municipalities in this riding were previously in parts of York Centre (Vaughan) and York—Mackenzie (Newmarket, Aurora, King) ridings.\nThe riding was last held by Greg Sorbara, representing the Ontario Liberal Party in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Sorbara served as the Minister of Finance for the Cabinet of Ontario from 2003 to 2005, and from 2006 to 2007.\nIn 2007 the riding was abolished to match the boundaries of the federal ridings. The riding was redistributed into Newmarket—Aurora, Oak Ridges—Markham, and Vaughan ridings.\nMembers of Parliament\nThis riding has elected the following members of Parliament:\nFederal election results\n|-\n|Liberal\n|Maurizio Bevilacqua\n|align=\"right\"| 33,502\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Lara Coombs\n|align=\"right\"| 8,591\n|New Democratic\n| Robert Navarretta\n|align=\"right\"| 2,250\n|Independent\n|Andrew James\n|align=\"right\"|524\n|-\n|Liberal\n|Maurizio Bevilacqua\n|align=\"right\"|38,208\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Menotti Mazzuca\n|align=\"right\"| 6,551\n|New Democratic\n|Octavia Beckles\n|align=\"right\"|1,938\n|No affiliation\n|Lesley Arden Knight\n|align=\"right\"|384\nProvincial election results\nSee also\n* List of Canadian electoral districts\n* Historical federal electoral districts of Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/HFER/hfer.asp?Language=E&Search=Det&rid=1078 Library of Parliament: Vaughan-King-Aurora federal riding information]\n* [http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/members/members_all_detail.do?locale=en&ID=90 Legislative Assembly of Ontario - Greg Sorbara]\n* Elections Ontario  [https://web.archive.org/web/20040903131507/http://www.electionsontario.on.ca/results/1999_results/stat_summary.jsp?e_code=37&rec=0&flag=E&layout=G 1999 results] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070618145225/http://www.electionsontario.on.ca/results/2003_results/stat_summary.jsp?e_code=38&rec=0&flag=E&layout=G 2003 results]\n* [http://www.cbc.ca/ontariovotes2003/riding/092/ CBC: Ontario Votes 2003 - Vaughan-King-Aurora Riding Profile]"
