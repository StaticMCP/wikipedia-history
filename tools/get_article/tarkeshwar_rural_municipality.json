The headquarters of Tarkeshwor Gaupalika is located in Dangsing.\nAs it is located on the banks of the Trishuli River and has an on-site observation of the China-Nepal Railway from here, there is a good chance of prosperity if the opportunity is used properly.\nIt also has a high chance of tourist potential due to its historical, cultural and natural heritages, such as Taruka's Bull fighting, Dhiki-Jato Chulo and other site to make a name for itself in the National and International arena.\nThe Gaupalika is divided into 6 Wards.The total area of this Gaupalika is 72.62 square kilometer and the total population is 15,719   as per the 2011 Nepal census.\nEtymology\nThe Gaupalika is named as Tarakeshwor because of the Lord Shiva Temple located at Taruka which is known as Tarakeshwar.\nBoundaries\n*East: Bidur Municipality\n*West: Nilkantha Municipality(Dhading District)\n*North: Myagang Rural Municipality\n*South: Belkotgadhi Municipality\nGallery\nFile:ViewfromDhikijatochuli.jpg|The view from Dhiki-Jato Chuli\nFile:Dhikijatochuli.jpg| Dhiki-Jato Chuli\nFile:Jatoofnuwakot.jpg| Jato of Dhiki-Jato Chuli\nFile:Bullfight in Taruka.JPG|Bullfight in Taruka\nFile:Khadkabhanjyang.jpg| View of Khadga Bhanjyang from Tarkeshwar-6\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.un.org.np/maps/district-maps/central/Nuwakot.pdf UN map of the municipalities of Nuwakot District]"
