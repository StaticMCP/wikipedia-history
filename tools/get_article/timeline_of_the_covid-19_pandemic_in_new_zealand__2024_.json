As of 7 January, there were 355 COVID-19 patients in hospital and six in intensive care.\nOn 15 January, 324 COVID-19 patients were hospitalised with six being in intensive care.\nOn 23 January, 343 patients were in hospital while the seven-day rolling average was 995.\nOn 26 January, the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) reported that COVID-19 wastewater figures had declined over the past two weeks leading up to 21 January. During the first week of January, COVID-19 wastewater figures had averaged 8.46 million genome copies per person per day (GC/p/d). By 21 January, this had declined to 3.76 million GC/p/d.\nOn 29 January, 258 cases were reported in hospital.\nOn 31 January, Health Minister Dr Shane Reti extended the Government's provision of free COVID-19 rapid antigen tests to late June 2024.\nFebruary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2| Cases\n! colspan=2 | Reinfections\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

In 2021, New Zealand and Barbados were the only two countries with negative excess mortality. University of Otago epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker attributed the country's negative excess mortality rate to its elimination strategy during that period, which kept Covid numbers down until vaccines became widely available. In 2022, the death toll rose by 10.2% compared with the previous year due to the relaxation of pandemic restrictions and the concurrent outbreak of the Omicron variant. By 2024, nearly 6,000 New Zealanders had died with COVID-19.\nOn 23 April, there were 167 cases reported in hospital as of midnight 21 April. The seven-day rolling average was 340 per day.
