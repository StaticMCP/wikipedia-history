It was last contested in 2018, with Anthony Perruzza elected councillor for the 2018–2022 term.\nHistory\nToronto municipal ward boundaries were significantly modified in 2018, passing through three models (44-ward, 47-ward, and 25-ward). Ultimately, for the purposes of administering the 2018 election, the 25-ward structure was used and later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2021.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the City of Toronto engaged in a ward boundary review evaluating the city's previous 44-ward model.\nBased on this, and in preparation for the 2018 municipal election, the City of Toronto added 3 new wards to  create a 47-ward model.  This model was in effect at the opening of the 2018 municipal election.\nThe 2018 Toronto municipal election ran from May 1, 2018, to October 22, 2018, and while underway the provincial government introduced the Better Local Government Act, 2018, S.O. 2018, c. 11 - Bill 5. The act was assented to on August 14, 2018.\nThe immediate effect of this act was to eliminate all previous ward models, and replace them with a 25-ward model designed to align with the provincial and federal ridings boundaries in effect at that time.\nThe timing of the boundary change was controversial, and the City of Toronto sued the province contesting the provisions' constitutionality. In the absence of an injunction, and with the pending threat of the province invoking the notwithstanding clause which would defeat any constitutional challenge, the election continued under the 25-ward model.\nThe nomination period originally scheduled to close on July 27, 2018, was extended to September 14, 2018. This allowed new candidates to run, and existing candidates to either withdraw or to reassign their candidacy to a different constituency.\nIn a judgment rendered October 1, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of the provisions, and the 25-ward model remained in effect for the 2022 Toronto municipal election.\nThe current ward is an amalgamation of the old Ward 7 York West (western section), the old Ward 8 York West (eastern section).\n2018 municipal election\nWard 7 Humber River—Black Creek was first contested during the 2018 municipal election. Ward-8 incumbent Anthony Perruzza, ran against Ward 11 incumbent-Giorgio Mammoliti, and six other candidates. Perruzza was ultimately elected with 36.80 per cent of the vote.\nGeography\nHumber River—Black Creek is part of the North York community council.\nWard 7 is bound on the west by the Humber River, and on the east by Keele Street. The northern boundary is Steeles Avenue (the city limit), and the southern boundary is Grandravine Drive, Black Creek, Sheppard Avenue, Jane Street and Highway 401.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council term\n! colspan=\"2\" | Member\n|-\n!Ward 7 York West\n!Ward 8 York West\n|-\n| 2000–2003\n| rowspan=\"5\" | Giorgio Mammoliti\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Peter Li Preti\n|-\n| 2003–2006\n|-\n| 2006–2010\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Anthony Perruzza\n|-\n| 2010–2014\n|-\n| 2014–2018\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |Ward 7 Humber River—Black Creek\n|-\n|2018–2022\n| colspan=\"2\" |Anthony Perruzza\n|}\nElection results\n2022 Toronto Municipal Election\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#ddf; width:200px;\" |Candidate\n! style=\"background:#ddf; width:50px;\" |Vote\n! style=\"background:#ddf; width:30px;\" |%\n|-\n|Anthony Perruzza (X)\n|8,707\n|61.30\n|-\n|Christopher Mammoliti\n|3,215\n|22.63\n|-\n|Amanda Coombs\n|2,282\n|16.07\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |2018 Toronto municipal election, Ward 7 Humber River—Black Creek\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#ddf; width:150px;\" |Candidate\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#ddf;\" |Votes\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#ddf;\" |Vote share\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Anthony Perruzza\n| align=\"right\" |8,336\n| align=\"right\" |36.80%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Giorgio Mammoliti\n| align=\"right\" |5,625\n| align=\"right\" |24.83%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Deanna Sgro\n| align=\"right\" |4,512\n| align=\"right\" |19.92%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Tiffany Ford\n| align=\"right\" |3,187\n| align=\"right\" |14.07%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Amanda Coombs\n| align=\"right\" |445\n| align=\"right\" |1.96%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Winston La Rose\n| align=\"right\" |247\n| align=\"right\" |1.09%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Kerry-Ann Thomas\n| align=\"right\" |153\n| align=\"right\" |0.68%\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Kristy-Ann Charles\n| align=\"right\" |147\n| align=\"right\" |0.65%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Total\n! align=\"right\" |22,652\n! align=\"right\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |Source: City of Toronto\n|}\nSee also\n* Municipal elections in Canada\n* Municipal government of Toronto\n* List of Toronto municipal elections\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/council/members-of-council/councillor-ward-7/ Councillor's webpage]"
