The battle showed that the wagenburg could not be used successfully by just any army. It took an army that knew how to use the wagons to make them successful. This battle ended the Fourth Crusade of the Hussite Wars, and for four years no further crusades were made. This would allow the Hussites to go on their \"beautiful rides\" into Hungary, Saxony, Bavaria and Silesia.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://bellum.cz/en/battle-of-tachov.html Bellum.cz – \"Battle of Tachov 3rd – 4th August 1427\"]"
