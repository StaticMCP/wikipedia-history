He served in the United States Army Air Forces as a fighter pilot during World War II, and he became an ace with 14 aerial victories, including 5 in a single day.\nEarly life and career\nEdward O. McComas was born on June 25, 1919, in Winfield, Kansas. McComas graduated from Winfield High School in 1937 and attended Southwestern College and the University of Kansas. In 1940, he enlisted in the Army Air Forces as a flying cadet, receiving a commission as a second lieutenant in 1941.\nWorld War II\nIn October 1943, Major McComas was made the commanding officer of the 118th Fighter Squadron, 23rd Fighter Group, Fourteenth Air Force. The previous commanding officer was killed in a flying accident. In January 1944, his squadron traveled to the China Burma India Theater. Initially based in India, the squadron moved to an airfield in China in June.\nOn September 29, 1944, McComas' P-51 Mustang was shot down and he was forced to bail out over China behind enemy lines. McComas, who had seriously injured his back earlier in his life, reinjured his back during this incident. However, he was rescued by Chinese Nationalist guerillas and was safely returned to his squadron.\nLieutenant Colonel McComas claimed his first aerial victory on October 16, 1944. He claimed a second victory on November 20, and then two more on December 5. On December 19, McComas claimed his fifth and sixth kills, officially becoming a flying ace. He claimed victories seven and eight two days later.\nOn December 23, McComas and his wingman were flying a reconnaissance mission of a Japanese airfield near Canton, China. While approaching the airfield, McComas engaged and shot down an enemy plane. At the airfield, Japanese pilots scrambled to their planes and began taking off in order to confront the two Americans. He attacked the airstrip and downed two planes just after they took off. He returned for a second pass and started to engage two more Japanese planes that had just taken off. While trying to evade McComas' guns, the two enemy planes collided and crashed. McComas was credited with shooting down five Japanese planes that day, thus making him the only pilot in the China-Burma-India Theater to achieve ace in a day status.\nThe next day, McComas claimed his 14th and final aerial victory of the war, making him one of the top aces of the Fourteenth Air Force. On Christmas Day, the commanding general of the 14th Air Force, Claire Chennault, presented McComas a brand new P-51 Mustang.\nMcComas was relieved of his command of 118th Fighter Squadron in January 1945 as his back pain became more severe. He returned to the United States and spent several months in military hospitals.\nPost-war career\nFrom 1946 to 1947, McComas was stationed in Germany. In 1949, he was promoted to colonel upon graduating from a course at the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.\nMcComas flew several dozen combat missions at the start of the Korean War in 1950. He was appointed as commander of the 8th Fighter-Bomber Group in May 1951, flying F-80 Shooting Stars during the war. In July 1951, he was evacuated to the United States due to recurring back problems. He had multiple surgeries performed on his back over the next few years while he was assigned to the Pentagon.\nOn June 22, 1954, Edward O. McComas committed suicide with a firearm in his home in Alexandria, Virginia. He was buried at Highland Cemetery in his hometown.\nAwards and decorations\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|United States Air Force Senior Pilot Badge\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|Silver Star\n|-\n|Legion of Meritwith bronze oak leaf cluster\n|Distinguished Flying Crosswith bronze oak leaf cluster\n|Purple Heart\n|-\n|Air Medalwith bronze oak leaf cluster\n|Air Force Presidential Unit Citation\n|American Defense Service Medal\n|-\n|American Campaign Medal\n|Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medalwith three bronze campaign stars\n|World War II Victory Medal\n|-\n|National Defense Service Medal\n|Korean Service Medal\n|Air Force Longevity Service Awardwith two bronze oak leaf clusters\n|-\n|Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation\n|United Nations Korea Medal\n|Republic of Korea War Service Medal\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
