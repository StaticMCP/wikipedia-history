On 8 December a large army under Pedro Fajardo de Zúñiga y Requesens headed for Barcelona, passing through Cambrils.\nHere, a small force of Catalan rebels attempted to ambush this much larger force, before withdrawing into the town and attempting to defend it. After several days of bombardment and heavy fighting the Spanish captured the town.\nWhen the defenders tried to surrender, some 700 of them were massacred. The three leaders were quickly tried and executed on the garrote. The next day, more people were hanged and the city was sacked.\nThe Spanish army then continued in the direction of Barcelona, taking Tarragona on 24 December. Later this army was decisively defeated in the Battle of Montjuïc on 23 January.\nReferences"
