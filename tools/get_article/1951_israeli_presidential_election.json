Despite his poor health, Weizmann stood again, and there were no opposing candidates. Although Weizmann was the only person to stand, a vote was still held. The result was 85 votes for, 11 against and three blank ballots. 21 MKs did not vote.\nHe was sworn in for his second term at his home in Rehovot on 25 November.\nWeizmann died a year later, and an early election was held to choose the country's second president.\nResults\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/activity/pages/presvotes.aspx Previous Presidential Elections] Knesset"
