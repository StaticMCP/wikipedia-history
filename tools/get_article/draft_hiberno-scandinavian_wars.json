They started with the first Viking raid in Ireland in 795, and ended with the death of Magnus III of Norway in 1103.\nViking raids and battles in Ireland\n795 to 840\nIn the year 795, Vikings attacked Rathlin Island. According to the Annals of Ulster, they burned down the island's buildings and sacked its church.\nThe Vikings would continue to commit nondescript raids from then forward.\n840 to 902\nIn roughly 840, the Vikings seized territory on Ireland's west coast, and established a Longphort, in what is now Dublin. This marked a crucial moment in Irish history, as it was at this point the Vikings stopped simply raiding Ireland, but conquering and settling in it, founding Norse-Gaelic kingdoms.\nFrom the 860s, a number of Irish revolts against the Vikings sprung up. In 902, the Vikings were expelled from the island.\n917 to 1014\nAfter returning from their expulsion, the Vikings took power once again. They would then start to engage the Irish in battles, such as Islandbridge in 919, Sulcoit in 968, Cathair Cuan in 977, Tara in 980, Glenmama in 999, and Clontarf in 1014.\nThe Battle of Clontarf led by the High King of Ireland, Brian Boru was the last major battle between the Irish and the Vikings. It resulted in victory for the Irish, and caused Viking power in Ireland to diminish severely. Viking figures such as Sigurd the stout and Brodir of Man died here.\nMagnus Barefoot's Campaigns\nDescription\nMagnus Olafsson, also known as Magnus Barefoot, was the King of Norway from 1093 to 1103. From 1098 until his death, he reestablished Norwegian control in former Viking-ruled places, such as The Isle of man, The Hebrides, and Dublin. He is considered by some to be the last true Viking king, though that title is usually given to Harald Sigurdsson.\nActivity in Ireland\naround the year 1100, Magnus sailed for Ireland, taking Dublin shortly after. In 1102, he made an alliance with the king of Munster and High King of Ireland, Muirchertach Ua Briain, by arranging a marriage between Muirchertach's daughter and Magnus' son.\nDeath\nOn the 24th of August 1103, Magnus was foraging for food in Ulster, when suddenly, He was killed by an Ulaid ambush. His death marked the end of the Hiberno-Scandinavian Wars, as it would be the last time any Norseman attempted to invade Ireland. He is buried in Downpatrick, County Down.\nReferences"
