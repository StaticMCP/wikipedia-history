It is located in Newark.  Rutgers, founded in 1766 in New Brunswick, is the eighth oldest college in the United States and a member of the Association of American Universities.  In 1945, the state legislature voted to make Rutgers University, then a private liberal arts college, into the state university and the following year merged the school with the former University of Newark (1936–1946), which became the Rutgers–Newark campus.  Rutgers also incorporated the College of South Jersey and South Jersey Law School, in Camden, as a constituent campus of the university and renamed it Rutgers–Camden in 1950.\nRutgers–Newark offers undergraduate (bachelors) and graduate (masters, doctoral) programs to more than 12,000 students. It is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\". It also offers cross-registration with the  New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) which borders its campus.  The campus is located on 38 acres in Newark's University Heights section.  The university host seven degree-granting undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, including the School of Public Affairs and Administration, Rutgers Business School (which has another campus in New Brunswick) and Rutgers Law School (which has another campus in Camden), and several research institutes, including the Institute of Jazz Studies.  According to U.S. News & World Report, Rutgers–Newark is the most diverse national university in the United States.\nHistory\nThe roots of Rutgers–Newark date back to 1908 when the New Jersey Law School first opened its doors. That law school, along with four other educational institutions in Newark—Dana College (founded in 1927), Newark Institute of Arts and Sciences (founded in 1909), Seth Boyden School of Business (founded 1929), and Mercer Beasley School of Law (founded 1926)—would form a series of alliances over the following four three decades, resulting in a final merger as the University of Newark in 1936.\nIn 1946, a decade later, the University of Newark was absorbed into Rutgers University after a vote by the New Jersey State Legislature, thus transforming into Rutgers–Newark.\nOrganization and governance\nLeadership\nAs a constituent unit of Rutgers University, ultimate authority for Rutgers–Newark rests with the central administration of the university, including its president and governing boards.\nHowever, the campus has its own chief executive (Nancy Cantor). Up until 2008, the chief executive was known as the provost, but then-president Richard L. McCormick changed the title of the chief executive to chancellor.\nConstituent colleges and professional schools\nRutgers–Newark is located on a campus of 38 acres in Newark's University Heights neighborhood.  This neighborhood is within blocks of the commercial center of the city and located near mass transit (bus, rail, and light rail stations).  The campus consists of seven degree-granting undergraduate, graduate and professional schools, including: Newark College of Arts and Sciences, University College, School of Criminal Justice, Graduate School-Newark, School of Public Affairs and Administration, Rutgers Business School-Newark and New Brunswick, and Rutgers Law School (Newark campus).\nThe Newark College of Arts and Sciences (NCAS) enrolls more than 60 percent of the undergraduates at Rutgers University in Newark and is the largest school on campus. With majors in almost 40 fields offering BA, BS, and BFA degrees.\nUniversity College–Newark offers undergraduate programs that cater to non-traditional or part-time adult students who have obligations during the day and attend class in the evening or on Saturday.\nRutgers–Newark offers MA, MS, MFA, and Ph.D. degrees.\nThe School of Public Affairs and Administration offers masters and doctoral degrees in public administration (MPA, Ph.D.).\nFounded in 1929, Rutgers Business School–Newark and New Brunswick offers undergraduate and graduate business programs on the Newark and New Brunswick campuses. Accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International, Rutgers Business School awards B.S., Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) (including international executive and executive MBAs), and doctoral degrees in management.\nThe School of Criminal Justice is a national and international center for scholarly research on all aspects of policing, delinquency, crime, and criminal justice administration. The school also provides educational programs that fulfill public service obligations by helping to address the needs of criminal justice agencies within the city, state, nation, and world.\nThe Rutgers Law School (Newark campus) is the oldest law school in New Jersey.\nAcademics and research\nRankings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |University rankings\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |National\n|-\n!Times/WSJ\n|198\n|-\n!U.S. News & World Report[https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rutgers-newark-2631 ]\n|75\n|-\n!Washington Monthly[https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017college-guide?ranking=2017-rankings-national-universities ]\n|42\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |National Program Rankings[https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/rutgers-university-newark-186399/overall-rankings ]\n|-\n!Program\n!Ranking\n|-\n|Biological Sciences\n|121\n|-\n|Business\n|44\n|-\n|Chemistry\n|81\n|-\n|Criminology\n|9\n|-\n|Law\n|74\n|-\n|Mathematics\n|74\n|-\n|Nursing: Master's\n|20\n|-\n|Psychology\n|81\n|-\n|Public Affairs\n|33\n|-\n|Public Management and Leadership\n|13\n|-\n|Supply Chain / Logistics\n|6\n|-\n|Urban Policy\n|10\n|}\n, Rutgers–Newark enrolls more than 12,000 students (more than 7,500 undergraduate, more than 3,500 graduate).
