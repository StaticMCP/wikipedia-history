The ADR government included representatives of all political parties which were members of the coalition.\nThe Alliance for Democracy and Reforms had three Prime Ministers. The activity of the second government of Ion Ciubuc (May 22, 1998 – February 1, 1999), the acting government of Serafim Urechean (February 5–17, 1999), and the government of Ion Sturza (February 19–November 9, 1999) were marked by chronic political instability, which prevented a coherent reform program. Foreign policy was marked by a duality of belonging to the CIS and steps towards a rapprochement with Western Europe.\nThe Christian Democratic Popular Front (PPCD) voted with the Communist Party (PCRM) for the dismissal of the Alliance government on November 9, 1999. Disagreements that appeared within the Alliance for Democracy and Reforms (ADR), caused to some degree by displeasure with seat distributions, led to its disintegration and an overwhelming Party of Communists (PCRM) victory at the 2001 parliamentary election.\nIn the next decade, the Party of Communists (PCRM) used very successfully the incoherent activity of the Alliance for Democracy and Reforms (ADR) for discrediting any form of political coalition formed without them. Their constant criticism of the future Alliance For European Integration (AIE) is a good example.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/63/164.html Governments Take Hard Hits to Qualify for World Bank Loans]"
