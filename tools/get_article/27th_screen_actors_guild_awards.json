The ceremony was broadcast on both TNT and TBS at 9:00&nbsp;P.M. EST / 6:00&nbsp;P.M. PST, airing for one hour rather than the usual two. The nominees were announced by Lily Collins and Daveed Diggs on February 4, 2021 via Instagram Live.\nAdditionally, the shortened one-hour show was pre-recorded. The winners were informed of their wins a few days before the telecast and the acceptance speeches were also pre-taped. These changes were a COVID-era decision in order to protect the guild's nominees and presenters.\nMichael Keaton made history by becoming the first person in SAG history to win three awards for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, winning this year for The Trial of the Chicago 7. In 2015 and 2016, he was part of the winning ensembles for Birdman (2014) and Spotlight (2015), respectively.\nChadwick Boseman tied Jamie Foxx and Maggie Smith in the record for most nominations in a single ceremony with four: Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role for Da 5 Bloods, and as part of the ensembles of both films for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. Boseman ultimately won for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, making history as the first actor to win the category posthumously; his widow, Taylor Simone Ledward, accepted the award.\nThe ceremony also marked the first time that all four individual film acting categories were won by people of color.\nWinners and nominees\n* Note: Winners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Key\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|Indicates a posthumous nomination\n|}\n{| class=wikitable style=font-size:100%\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Chadwick Boseman  – ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom as Levee Green'\n** Riz Ahmed – Sound of Metal as Ruben Stone\n** Anthony Hopkins – The Father as Anthony\n** Gary Oldman – Mank as Herman J.
