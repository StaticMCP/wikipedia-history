In 1965, the rear engined Viking VK43 was introduced. Later the VK49, VK55 and VK57 versions were released.\nFollowing the closure of Albion's Scotstoun plant in October 1980, production was transferred to Leyland with the chassis relaunched as the Leyland Super Viking. Production ceased in 1984.\nOperators\nAlthough some were sold in the United Kingdom, notably to the Scottish Bus Group, the majority were sold overseas including to Barbados and Kowloon Motor Bus in Hong Kong, Fok Lei (now Transmac) in Macau, and SBS in Singapore. The Albion Viking was bought in numbers in Australia. In the 1960s, it was popular with operators of Safari Tours.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.busaustralia.com/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=search&search=Viking Bus Australia gallery]"
