Tamás Sulyok was elected with two-third majority.\nBackground\nOn 10 February 2024 President Katalin Novák announced her resignation (effective upon approval by Parliament) over the controversial pardon of a vice principal of a foster home in Bicske, who tried to cover up the principal's crimes when the latter was charged for child molestation. The vice principal's pardon became known to the public on 2 February 2024, after which protests demanding Novák's resignation took place.\nThe opposition alliance United for Hungary called for the direct election of the President of the Republic in their manifesto for the 2022 parliamentary election, which would require amending or replacing the current constitution. On 25 February, opposition parties held a rally in Budapest calling for direct presidential elections.\nOn 26 February the National Assembly formally accepted Novák's resignation, leading to the termination of her mandate.\nElectoral system\nUnder the current Constitution of Hungary adopted by the Fidesz–KDNP government coalition in 2011, the President of the Republic is elected via secret ballot by the National Assembly, no sooner than sixty but no later than thirty days before expiry of the mandate (five years) of the previous office-holder, or if their mandate terminated prematurely, within thirty days of the termination. The constitution authorizes the Speaker of the National Assembly to set the date for the election.\nA presidential candidate needs the written nomination of at least one-fifth of the Members of Parliament (thus 40 MPs), who may not nominate more than one candidate. In the first round of the election, a two-thirds majority of all incumbent MPs is required to elect the president. If this condition is not fulfilled, a second round is held between the two candidates who received the highest and second highest numbers of votes in the first round. (Since 1990, there have been no more than two candidates in any presidential election.) A simple majority of the voting MPs is then sufficient. If only one candidate is nominated, the assembly votes on whether to confirm or reject their election to the presidency, with each MP being allowed to vote either for or against, but not to cast their vote for an alternative candidate.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Hungarian presidential election, 2024.\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Candidate\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Nominating Party\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Votes\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | %\n|-\n| In favor of Tamás Sulyok\n| Independent (Fidesz–KDNP)\n| 134\n| 67.67%\n|-\n| Against Sulyok\n| –\n| 5\n| 2.53%\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Didn't vote\n| 52\n| 26.26%\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Blank and invalid votes\n| 7\n| 3.54%\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Total votes\n! 146\n! 73.74%\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Total seats\n! 198\n! 100%\n|}\nReferences"
