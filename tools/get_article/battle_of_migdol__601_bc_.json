Yet, there was still Egyptian influence in the Southern Levant area close to Egypt. Therefore, a Babylonian campaign against Egypt itself was needed to end Egyptian intervention and strengthen Babylonian control in the Southern Levant and to invade Egypt itself.\nBattle\nThe battle took place in the last days of 601 BC. Nebuchadnezzar advanced into the sinai to invade Egypt and was met by Necho and his forces. a fierce battle broke out near the fortress of Migdol where both sides had many casualties. the Babylonians withdrew and were pursued by Necho who captured Gaza. Nebuchadnezzar stayed home the next year to rebuild his forces.\nReferences"
