The main leaders of the party were Ramón Otero Pedrayo, Xaquín Lorenzo Fernández, Florentino López Cuevillas and Vicente Risco.\nHistory\nThe PNRO had 24 local branches (the largest was the city of Ourense, with 70 members). The main goal of the party was participating in the elections to the Constituent Cortes of 1931, in coalition with the Galician Republican Federation and the Radical Socialist Republican Party. Ramón Otero Pedrayo was elected MP with 35,443 votes, but Vicente Risco, with 19,615 votes, failed. The PNRO was one of the parties that participated in the creation of Partido Galeguista in December 1931.\nNotes\nFurther reading\n* Beramendi, X.G. and Núñez Seixas, X.M.
