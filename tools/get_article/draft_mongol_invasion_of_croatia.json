The campaign ended in a successful for the Mongols.\nPrelude\nThe campaign was part of the larger Mongol invasion of Europe, which saw Mongol forces sweeping through Eastern and Central Europe in pursuit of King Béla IV of Hungary. The Mongols, led by Batu Khan and his generals, had already achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Mohi in April 1241, effectively crushing the Hungarian army. Following this success, they continued their advance westward, targeting Croatia and its capital, Zagreb.\nInvasion\nAfter the fall of Hungary, the Mongols pursued King Béla IV, who had fled to Croatia in search of refuge. In December 1241, Mongol forces, under the command of Kadan, a son of Ögedei Khan, launched an assault on Zagreb. At that time, Zagreb was a developing medieval city consisting of two main settlements: the fortified Upper Town (Gradec) and the ecclesiastical center of Kaptol.\nThe Attack on Zagreb\nThe Mongols quickly overran and destroyed Kaptol, burning down the Cathedral of St. Stephen and causing widespread devastation. However, the citizens of Gradec were better prepared and retreated behind fortified walls, resisting Mongol attacks. The natural defenses of the Medvednica mountain range further complicated the Mongol siege efforts. Despite their military prowess, the Mongols found it difficult to breach the fortified Upper Town, leading them to abandon their direct assault.\nAftermath\nAlthough the Mongols failed to fully conquer Zagreb, their raid inflicted significant destruction, particularly on Kaptol. Many settlements in the surrounding region were devastated, and the local population suffered heavy casualties. However, the raid on Zagreb was short-lived, as the Mongols soon withdrew due to news of the death of Great Khan Ögedei in December 1241. This event forced Batu Khan and his generals to abandon their campaign in Central Europe and return to Mongolia to participate in the succession process.\nFollowing the Mongol withdrawal, Zagreb and other affected regions took steps to strengthen their defenses. King Béla IV, recognizing the importance of fortified cities, granted Gradec the status of a royal free city in 1242. This allowed the citizens to build stronger fortifications, ensuring better protection against future invasions.\nSources\n*Pow, Stephen.
