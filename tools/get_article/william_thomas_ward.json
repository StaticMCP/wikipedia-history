Ward was born in Amelia County, Virginia, one of the many children of William Ward Jr. and Sally W. Elmore. His parents migrated with their extended family to Kentucky to settle on lands granted his maternal grandfather Thomas Elmore, due to his service in the American Revolutionary War. His maternal great uncle was John Archer Elmore. Ward attended common schools and then St. Mary's College near Lebanon, Kentucky. Ward studied law and was admitted to the bar, beginning practice in Greensburg, Kentucky.\nWard served in the Mexican–American War as a major of the 4th Kentucky Volunteers from 1847 to 1848. In 1850, Ward served as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was elected to represent the Kentucky 4th Congressional District to U.S. Congress as a member of the Whig Party, serving in the House of Representatives 32nd Congress (March 4, 1851 – March 3, 1853).  He did not stand for renomination in 1852.\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War, Ward was commissioned as a brigadier general in the Union Army, serving throughout the war.  Ward led a brigade in XX Corps during the early stages of the Atlanta campaign. After MG Daniel Butterfield went on leave, Ward commanded third division XX Corps for the remainder of the campaign including conspicuous service at the battle of Peachtree Creek. He also led it in Sherman's March to the Sea and the Carolinas campaign.\nAfter the war was over, he returned to the private practice of law in Louisville, Kentucky, partnering with his son Ossian T. Ward.\nWard died in 1878 and was buried in the Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.\nSee also\n* List of American Civil War generals (Union)\nReferences\n:This article incorporates text in the public domain from the U.S. Government.\nRetrieved on 2007-05-23"
