Until 1924, all British stamps depicted only the portrait of the reigning monarch, with the exception of the \"high value\" stamps (also known as the \"Sea Horses\" design) issued in 1913, which were twice the size of normal stamps with added pictorial design.\nIn 1924, the first \"commemorative\" stamp was issued for the British Empire Exhibition. There were then occasional issues over the next thirty years, when the frequency of new issues became more regular. From the mid-1960s, in most years, six to nine sets of commemorative stamps have been issued every year. PHQ cards, postcard-sized reproductions of commemorative stamps, have also been issued to accompany every new set of stamps since the mid-1970s.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ British commemorative stamps issued between 1980 and 1989\n|-\n!
