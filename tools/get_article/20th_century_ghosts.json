As part of his job he has read and rejected many thousands of derivative stories, and he has become jaded by the process. When he reads the strangely disturbing story \"Buttonboy\" by Peter Kilrue, he regains his passion for his work. The plot concerns his search for the elusive Kilrue in an attempt to procure \"Buttonboy\" for the anthology.\n20th Century Ghost\nThe Rosebud Theatre is an old style movie palace, haunted by the semi-legendary spirit of a young woman. The girl died during a screening of The Wizard of Oz, appears infrequently throughout the twentieth century, and occasionally starts conversations with a select few moviegoers. The story is told by Alec Sheldon, the theatre owner, who worries about his approaching mortality and what will happen to the Rosebud after he retires.\nPop Art\nThis story was originally published in 2001 in an anthology titled With Signs & Wonders'' by Invisible Cities Press. In 2007, Subterranean Press produced a limited edition chapbook of \"Pop Art\" limited to 150 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies. These books were only available through the publishers website.\nThe plot concerns the friendship of two socially outcast boys: the narrator, who has a dysfunctional home life, and his only friend, a human boy made of inflatable plastic who has loving and supportive flesh-and-blood parents. Christopher Golden called it one of the best short stories in years.\nYou Will Hear the Locust Sing\nThe story of a boy who wakes up one morning to find that he has become a giant, human-sized insect.\nAbraham's Boys\nAbraham Van Helsing, living in America following the events of Dracula, tries to teach his sons about vampires.\nBetter Than Home\nStory about a troubled boy whose father manages a baseball team.\nThe Black Phone\n13-year-old Finney is kidnapped by a man named the Grabber. Trapped in a basement room, the boy's only hope may lie in a mysterious disconnected black phone hanging on the basement wall. The phone rings at night with the whispers of the kidnapper's previous (and now dead) victims. In 2021, this short story was adapted into a film of the same title by Scott Derrickson, with Ethan Hawke as the Grabber and Mason Thames as Finney. The film received a sequel in 2025 written and directed by Derrickson, based on an original idea by Joe Hill.\nIn The Rundown\nA video store clerk comes upon a grisly scene on a weedy dirt lane.\nThe Cape\nSeven-year-old Eric learns that he can fly (well, sort of) while wearing his blue cape. After suffering a terrible injury he thinks the cape is lost, only to find the cape again years later.\nLast Breath\nThe story concerns Dr. Allinger, an old man who runs a \"Museum of Silence\" which contains the last breaths of various people, some being famous figures such as Edgar Allan Poe.\nThe Widow's Breakfast\nDuring the Great Depression, a drifter encounters a widow whose offer of food and fresh clothing may be too good to be true.\nBobby Conroy Comes Back from The Dead\nA failed comedian meets his now-married ex-girlfriend during the filming of Dawn of the Dead.\nMy Father's Mask\nThirteen-year-old Jack's parents take him on an unexpected trip to their cabin on Big Cat Lake. Along the way they play a game made up by Jack's mother in which they are being chased by the \"playing card people\". At the cabin Jack finds various masks, which he is told must be worn to disguise themselves from the playing card people. Jack grows weary of the game, but soon he finds that it may not be a game at all.\nAdaptations\n* Pop Art (2008), short film directed by Amanda Boyle, based on the short story \"Pop Art\"\n* ''Abraham's Boys'' (2009), short film directed by Dorothy Street, based on the short story \"Abraham's Boys\"\n* The Black Phone (2021), film directed by Scott Derrickson, based on the short story The Black Phone\n* ''Abraham's Boys'' (2025), film directed by Natasha Kermani, based on the short story \"Abraham's Boys\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://joehillfiction.com/ Joe Hill's official web site]\n* [http://www.pspublishing.co.uk/ PS Publishing official web site] — Original U.K. publisher of 20th Century Ghosts\n**[https://web.archive.org/web/20081004181043/http://store.pspublishing.co.uk/acatalog/20th_century_ghosts_sc.html Archived entry for 20th Century Ghosts]\n* [http://www.harpercollins.com/imprints/index.aspx?imprintid=518003 William Morrow official web site] — U.S. published of 20th Century Ghosts\n**[http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061147975/20th_Century_Ghosts/index.aspx Entry for 20th Century Ghosts]\n**"
