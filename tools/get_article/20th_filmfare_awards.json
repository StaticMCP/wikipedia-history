Despite being highly favored to win the award, she controversially lost the award to Hema Malini who won her first and only award in the category for her comic dual role in the comedy-drama Seeta Aur Geeta.\nPran, who won Best Supporting Actor for Be-Imaan refused to accept the award, on the grounds that the Best Music Director award should have gone to Ghulam Mohammed for Pakeezah, and not Shankar-Jaikishan for Be-Imaan.\nMain Awards\n— Best Actor winner for Be-Imaan]]\n— Best Actress winner for Seeta Aur Geeta]]\n— Best Supporting Actor winner for Be-Imaan]]\n— Best Supporting Actress winner for Hare Rama Hare Krishna]]\n— Best Comic Actor winner for Bawarchi]]\n— Best Playback singer winner for \"Dum Maro Dum\" (Hare Rama Hare Krishna)]]\nBest Film\n' Be-Imaan '\n*Anubhav\n*Pakeezah\nBest Director\n' Sohanlal Kanwar – Be-Imaan '\n*Kamal Amrohi – Pakeezah\n*Manoj Kumar – Shor\nBest Actor\n' Manoj Kumar – Be-Imaan '\n*Rajesh Khanna – Amar Prem\n*Rajesh Khanna – Dushmun\nBest Actress\n' Hema Malini – Seeta Aur Geeta '\n*Meena Kumari – Pakeezah\n*Raakhee – Aankhon Aankhon Mein\nBest Supporting Actor\n' Pran – Be-Imaan '\n*Premnath – Shor\nBest Supporting Actress\n' Zeenat Aman – Hare Rama Hare Krishna '\n*Bindu – Dastaan\n*Nazima – Be-Imaan\nBest Comic Actor\n' Paintal – Bawarchi '\n*Jagdeep – Bhai Ho To Aisa\n*Mehmood – Bombay To Goa\nBest Story\n' Anubhav – Basu Chatterjee '\n*Shor – Manoj Kumar\nBest Screenplay\n' Amar Prem – Arabinda Mukhopadhyay\nBest Dialogue\nAmar Prem – Ramesh Pant\nBest Music Director\nBe-Imaan – Shankar–Jaikishan '\n*Amar Prem – R.

Filmfare, however, defended their decision by stating that according to their rules, posthumous awards were not allowed then; Filmfare editor B. K. Karanjia said both Ghulam Mohammad (the music director of Pakeezah) and Josef Wirsching (cinematographer) lost for the same reason.\nYears later, in an interview, veteran actress Rakhee Gulzar revealed that initially she was offered the award for Best actress which she declined, as she considered her performance to be mediocre as earlier, she was devoid of the award for her performance in Sharmilee.\nBiggest Winners\n* Be-Imaan – 7/8\n* Amar Prem – 3/8\n* Seeta Aur Geeta – 2/2\n* Hare Rama Hare Krishna – 2/2\n*Shor – 1/7\n*Pakeezah – 1/5\nSee also\n* 22nd Filmfare Awards\n* 21st Filmfare Awards\n* Filmfare Awards\nReferences\n* https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000245/1973/"
