On September 24 they made their Base Camp at 15,500 feet at the junction of the Raktavarn and Thelu glaciers. Camps I at 17,500 feet and camp II at 18,200 feet were established on September 26 and 28. On September 29 Chowdhury, Samarenda N. Dhar, Ranjan K. Mondai, Robin Banerjee, Amitava Majundar, Sherpas Mingma and Pasang Tsering and high-altitude porter Dawa reached the summit of Koteswar.  A team from west Bengal while claiming the first ascent of Sudarshan Parbat mistakenly climbed Koteshwar according to J C Nanavati of Indian Mountaineering Foundation (IMF). \"In 1972? a Calcutta based group claimed a mistaken first ascent of this peak. They had climbed only Koteshwar - 2000 ft lower\".\nGlaciers and rivers\nKoteshwar lies in between two glaciers. On the eastern side lies Swetvarn Glacier and on the western side lies Thelu Glacier. Both these glaciers join Raktavarn Glacier on the south. Finally Raktvarn drains itself at Gangotri Glacier near Gomukh and from there emerges as the Bhagirathi River one of the main tributaries of river Ganga. River Bhagirathi later joins Alaknanda River at Dev Pryag and becomes Ganga there after.\nNeighboring peaks\nNeighboring peaks of Koteshwar:\n* Sri Kailash:\n* Chirbas Parbat\n* Matri\n* Sudarshan Parbat\n* Kalidhang\n* Yogeshwar:\n* Thelu:\nSee also\n* List of Himalayan peaks of Uttarakhand\nReferences"
