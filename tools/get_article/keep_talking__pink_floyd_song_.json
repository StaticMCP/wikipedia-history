This same commercial was sampled again in \"Talkin' Hawkin'\" from Pink Floyd's final studio album, The Endless River. Gilmour chose to use the speech after nearly crying to the commercial, which he described as \"the most powerful piece of television advertising that I've ever seen in my life.\" The song also makes use of the talk box guitar effect.\nRelease\nThe song was the first to be sent to radio stations from the album in the United States in March 1994. It was the group's third #1 hit on the Album Rock Tracks chart (a chart published by Billboard magazine which measures radio play in the United States, and is not a measure of record sales), staying atop for six weeks.\nThe song was included on the 2001 compilation, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd.\nLive\nThe song was performed every night during the 1994 The Division Bell Tour and live versions, taken from different shows, were included in both the album Pulse and the video of the same name.\nThe song was sampled by Wiz Khalifa on the title track of his 2009 mixtape Burn After Rolling.\nQuotes\n, retrieved 28 July 2010}}\nPersonnel\n;Pink Floyd\n*David Gilmour – lead vocals, guitar, talk box, EBow\n*Richard Wright – Hammond organ, synthesizer\n*Nick Mason – drums, percussion\n;Additional musicians\n*Gary Wallis – programming\n*Jon Carin – programming, additional keyboards\n*Guy Pratt – bass guitar\n*Sam Brown – backing vocals\n*Durga McBroom – backing vocals\n*Carol Kenyon – backing vocals\n*Jackie Sheridan – backing vocals\n*Rebecca Leigh-White – backing vocals\n*Stephen Hawking – computer voice, sampled\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1994)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Canada\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|-\n|\n|-\n|US Billboard Album Rock Tracks\n|align=center|1\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1994)\n!Position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM)\n|align=\"center\"|64\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
