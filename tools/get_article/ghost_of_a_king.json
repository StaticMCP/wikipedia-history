This album cements The Gray Havens' status as one of the most promising indie darling acts of 2016.\" Christopher Smith, reviewing the album at Jesus Freak Hideout, describes, \"Where Fire & Stone was only more rewarding with more listens, Ghost of a King leaves a stronger initial impression but doesn't quite have the 'masterpiece' quality of Fire & Stone. But even landing just shy of that album is a tremendous accomplishment.\" Rating the album five stars for The Christian Manifesto, writes, \"This is just a perfect album.\" Michael Weaver, indicating in a review by Jesus Freak Hideout, says, \"The Radfords have certainly proven that they know what they are doing and always leave you wanting just a little more.\"\nTrack listing\nReferences"
