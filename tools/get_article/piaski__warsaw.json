It was located near the village of Buraków. In 1892, the barracks of the Imperial Russian Army had been built in the area. The complex consisted of around 120 wooden and brick buildings. It also the included military training area.\nOn 8 April 1916, the area was incorporated into the city of Warsaw. After the year 1918, Młociny B had been renamed to Piaski. The name translates in Polish to sands and was a reference to the sandy dunes characteristic to the area.\nFollowing the declaration of independence by the Second Polish Republic, the barracks and the surrounding military infrastructure began being used by the Polish Armed Forces. In the 1930s, in the area was also placed a railway training centre, to train railway workers. Some historians suspect, that the training centre was a cover for the secret operations of the Second Department of Polish General Staff, an intelligence agency of Polish Armed Forces.\nDuring the Second World War, while under the German occupation, in the area was located the training centre of Abwehr, the military intelligence of Wehrmacht, and later also the military hospital, mainly for the soldiers injured at the Eastern Front. Following the end of the war, until October 1949, in the area was located Soviet prisoner-of-war camp. In 1949, it housed almost 300 prisoners-of-war.\napartment building, located at 101 Broniewskiego Street in Piaski, between 1974 and 1975.]]\nIn the 1970s, Piaski began being developed as a residential neighbourhood. Between 1970 and 1973, the multifamily residential apartment buildings were built around the Broniewskiego Street.\nIn 2002, 4 Niedzielskiego Street was built the Church of St. Christopher, a Roman Catholic parish church.\nOverview\nPiaski is a residential neighbourhood, mostly consisting of the apartment buildings.\nAt 4 Niedzielskiego Street is located the Catholic St. Christopher Church.\nLocation and administrative boundaries\nPiaski is located within the southeastern portion of the district of Bielany, in the city of Warsaw, Poland.
