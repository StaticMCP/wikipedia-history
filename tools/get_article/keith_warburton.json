He was a member of Brighton's sole premiership team in 1948, and kicked three goals in the Grand Final; and, he was the Association's leading goalkicker in 1949, kicking 101 goals. Altogether, Warburton played 90 games for Brighton, and kicked 317 goals.\nWarburton moved to the Carlton Football Club in the Victorian Football League, and made his debut in Round 1 of the 1951 season. He received a heavy knock during a game in 1952 and was rushed to hospital after collapsing at a dance after the game. He was eventually forced to retire in 1955 due to ongoing problems as a result of that knock.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.blueseum.org/tiki-index.php?page=Keith+Warburton Keith Warburton] at [http://www.blueseum.org Blueseum]"
