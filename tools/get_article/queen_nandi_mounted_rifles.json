The formation of the regiment would entail the amalgamation of four Volunteer Units; Royal D'urban Rangers (1854), Victoria Mounted Rifles (1862), Alexander Mounted Rifles (1865) and Durban Mounted Rifles (1873).\nAnglo-Boer War\nThe regiment was re-activated in Durban during February and March 1901 for service in the South African War. It was originally called the 2nd Natal Volunteer Composite Regiment but the name was soon changed to Natal Mounted Infantry. The unit was armed and equipped by the Natal Volunteer Department and horsed by the Imperial Remount Department. The first depot was at Dundee, but, on the unit changing its name, this was transferred to Newcastle.\nWorld War I\nAt the outbreak of World War I, the regiment became the 3rd Mounted Rifles and was attached to the 8th Mounted Brigade with the Central Force in the German South West African Campaign. On 1 July 1913 the Regiment was re-amalgamated with the Border Mounted Rifles, renamed the 3rd Mounted Rifles (Natal Mounted Rifles) and transferred to the Active Citizen Force of the Union Defence Force.\nWorld War II\nIn 1932 the Regiment's name was simplified to The Natal Mounted Rifles and in 1934 it was converted to infantry. The regiment was mounted for 80 years until July 1934 when horses were entirely dispensed with and NMR converted to a machine-gun unit. In January 1934 the regiment was re-mustered as an armoured reconnaissance regiment of the  6th South African Armoured Division.\nIn addition to the campaigns in which its various constituent units fought in before the Regiment's formation, the Natal Mounted Rifles served in the Second Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902), the Zulu Rebellion (1906–1907), World War I (specifically in South-West Africa from 1914 to 1915), World War II (See 1st SA Infantry Division and South Africa's post-war internal conflicts and the South African Border War).\nPost World War II\nBorder War\nPost 1994\nSince the 1994 Democratic Elections, the NMR has undergone several training exercises and continues to recruit members into its ranks. It boasts a Regimental Pipe Band and is affiliated to The King's Own Hussars.\nName change\nIn August 2019, 52 Reserve Force units had their names changed to reflect the diverse military history of South Africa. The Natal Mounted Rifles became the Queen Nandi Mounted Rifles, and have 3 years to design and implement new regimental insignia.\nRegimental\nSymbols\nRegimental mottos:\n* 1913|event=Just and frank}}\n* Present|event=Rough but ready}}\nPrevious dress insignia\nAlliances\n*  – affiliated 9 April 1930 to The Queen's Royal Hussars (The Queen's Own and Royal Irish)\n* Glenwood Boys High School affiliated to NMR on 17 February 1936\n* South African School of Armour affiliated to NMR on 21 March 1997\n* Durban Metro Police Equestrian Unit affiliated to NMR on 25 March 2000\n* South African Air Force No.15 (Helicopter) Squadron, Durban, affiliated to NMR\nBattle honours\n* South Africa 1879\n* South Africa 1899–1902\n** Defence of Ladysmith\n* Natal 1906\n* South-West Africa 1914–1915\n** Gibeon\n* East Africa 1940–1941\n** Dadaba\n* Western Desert 1941–1943\n* Gazala\n* Springbok Road\n* Paliano\n* Bir Temrad\n** Best Post\n** Alamein Defence\n** El Alamein\n* Italy 1944–1945\n** The Tiber\n** Celleno\n** Florence\n** The Greve\n** Gothic Line\n** Po Valley\n* El Yibo (The first action of the NMR in World War II 16–18 January 1940)\n* South African Border War 1975–1976\nLeadership\n|to-date=1901}}\n|to-date=n.d.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
