The temple plays a unique role in the history of Hindu religion, art, and architecture.\nReligious significance\nThe Shaiva saint Appar's sister Thilakavathiyar was living in Thiruvathigai during her later years and devoted her lifetime service to Shiva. Afflicted by a painful illness, Appar, who was originally called Dharmasenar and was then a staunch follower of Jainism, prayed for relief at this temple where his sister served. By the divine grace of Shiva, he was cured. He embraced Shaivism from then and started canonizing various temples with his verses. The ruling Pallava king namely Kadava punished Appar in various ways and finally dropped him in a lime kiln. He was subsequently cast on the waters of sea, where he started floating and was pushed ashore in Thirupathipuliyur. It is believed that some of his best songs were sung at this time in praise of the presiding deities at Padaleeswarar temple and Veerateneeswarar temple. Influenced by the greatness of the poet, the king himself converted from Jainism to Shaivism.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
