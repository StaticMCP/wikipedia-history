He played college basketball for the Oregon Ducks and the Indiana Hoosiers.\nEarly life and high school career\nKel’el Ware was born on April 20, 2004, in North Little Rock, Arkansas, and attended North Little Rock High School from 2018 to 2022. As a junior, he averaged 16.2 points, 9.1 rebounds and 4.1 blocks per game. As a senior, Ware averaged 20.3 points, 12 rebounds and 5.7 blocks per game. He also played in the Jordan Brand Classic, Nike Hoop Summit and the 2022 McDonald's All-American Boys Game during his senior year.\nRecruiting\nWare was a consensus five-star recruit and one of the top players in the 2022 class, according to major recruiting services. On August 9, 2021, he committed to playing college basketball for Oregon over offers from Arkansas, Auburn, Baylor, Illinois, Kansas, Memphis, Texas A&M and Texas Tech. Ware was also offered a two-year contract for $900,000 from Overtime Elite, but he declined the offer and maintained his commitment to Oregon.\nCollege career\nWare entered his freshman season at Oregon as the Ducks' second center. He also entered the season as a potential first-round selection in the 2023 NBA draft. After averaging 26 minutes played, 10.3 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks over the first nine games of the season, Ware saw a decline in playing time due to what Oregon's coaching staff believed to be an inconsistent work ethic. He ultimately averaged 6.6 points and 4.1 rebounds per game on the season. At the end of the season, Ware entered the NCAA transfer portal.\nWare ultimately transferred to Indiana. He started at center in the Hoosiers' season-opener against Florida Gulf Coast and recorded the first double-double of his college career with 13 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, three blocks and two steals as Indiana won 69–63. Ware set a new career high with 22 points scored while also grabbing 12 rebounds on November 16, 2023, in a 89–80 victory over Wright State. He re-set his career high in scoring with 28 points in a 89–76 win over Harvard. After the season, Ware declared for the 2024 NBA draft, forgoing his remaining college eligibility.\nProfessional career\nMiami Heat / Sioux Falls Skyforce (2024–present)\nWare was selected with the 15th overall pick by the Miami Heat in the 2024 NBA draft and on July 2, 2024, he signed with the Heat.\nWare made his NBA debut on October 23, 2024, in a 116–97 loss to the Orlando Magic.\nOn January 23, 2025, Ware scored 20+ points in 3 straight games in games against the Spurs, Trail Blazers and the Bucks which earned him the Rookie of the Month award.\nOn April 19, 2025, Ware helped the Heat beat the Atlanta Hawks in the Play-In Tournament, and he made his Playoffs debut in a 121-100 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 20, 2025.\nNational team career\nWare played for the United States under-18 basketball team at the 2022 FIBA Under-18 Americas Championship. He was named to the All-Tournament team after averaging 15.7 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks as the United States won the gold medal.\nPersonal life\nWare is the son of Tamika and Cedrick Spaight (stepfather). He has two brothers, Javarus Ware and Kashis Spaight and two sisters, Dyamyn Ware and Jazzmyn Spaight.\nHis mother named him after Superman’s Kryptonian name, Kal-El.\nCareer statistics\nNBA\nRegular season\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Miami\n| 64 || 36 || 22.2 || .554 || .315 || .687 || 7.4 || .9 || .6 || 1.1 || 9.3\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career\n| 64 || 36 || 22.2 || .554 || .315 || .687 || 7.4 || .9 || .6 || 1.1 || 9.3\nPlayoffs\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|2025\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Miami\n| 4 || 4 || 18.3 || .444 || .273 ||  || 4.8 || 1.0 || .3 || .5 || 4.8\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|Career\n| 4 || 4 || 18.3 || .444 || .273 ||  || 4.8 || 1.0 || .3 || .5 || 4.8\nCollege\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2022–23\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oregon\n| 35 || 4 || 15.8 || .457 || .273 || .712 || 4.1 || .5 || .4 || 1.3 || 6.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2023–24\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Indiana\n| 30 || 30 || 32.2 || .586 || .425 || .634 || 9.9 || 1.5 || .6 || 1.9 || 15.9\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career\n| 65 || 34 || 23.3 || .538 || .337 || .660 || 6.7 || 1.0 || .5 || 1.6 || 10.9\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://iuhoosiers.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/kel-el-ware/17643 Indiana Hoosiers bio]\n*[https://goducks.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/kel-el-ware/12398 Oregon Ducks bio]\n*[https://www.usab.com/players/kelel-ware USA Basketball bio]"
