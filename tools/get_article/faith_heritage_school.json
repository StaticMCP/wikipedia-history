As of the 2003–2004 school year, its total enrollment was 557, with a student-to-teacher ratio of 14.3, according to NCES figures provided by the United States Department of Education. Figures reported by Syracuse's Post-Standard indicate that the school's enrollment for the 2006–2007 school year was down to 375 and that its executive director, Jeff Shaver,  was spearheading an effort to increase enrollment, improve the school's financial aid offerings, and raise donations to fill the nearly 20% expected gap between tuition and expenditures in the school's $2.1 million budget.\nReferences"
