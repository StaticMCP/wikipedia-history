The monument was created by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Grandi and inaugurated in 1895 to commemorate the Five Days of Milan, a rebellion of 18–22 March 1848 which caused the Austrian army to withdraw from Milan. In this site, once rose the Porta Vittoria (formerly Porta Tosa), the eastern gate in the Medieval Spanish Walls of Milan, whose capture by the rebellion prompted the Austrians to abandon the city.\nCommission of Monument\nTemporary monuments had been dedicated in 1848 to honor those who died during the recent events of 1848, but these soon were removed by the authorities after the restitution of Hapsburg rule. In 1862, the local Academy of Fine Arts sponsored a contest for a monument to decorate the town gate at this spot, but this effort failed to lead to construction. In 1872–73, a number of public subscriptions were started to fund monuments celebrating events related to 1848 and 1860 that lead to an Italian kingdom.\nIn 1879, two decades after the union of Lombardy to the Kingdom of Italy, with the funds collected from this    plan the city of Milan sponsored a competition to erect a memorial to the events of the Cinque Giornate. Nearly 100 projects were submitted, and a project by Luca Beltrami was selected in 1880, however, it was not approved by the Commune, and a second contest was held, this time requesting designs for a triumphal arch. The assigned funds were for 500 thousand Lire. Eighty-two proposals were submitted, and the design by Grandi was selected, even though it did not meet the specified request. With a sketch of his proposal, Grandi indicated that he:\nGrandi thirteen years, longer than expected, to complete the work. It proved a challenge to the foundries to work a bronze monument of this size. He established a studio near the monument's location. The monument was finally inaugurated in March 1895; the sculptor had passes away a few days before.\nDescription of monument\nThe monument is in a small park surrounded by busy traffic of cars and  trolleys. Protected by a low fence, and standing atop a low stone plinth consisting of a rise of stairs made with reddish Swedish granite. Atop the stone at the base is a swirl of Statuary, consisting mostly of women, an eagle and a lion. The statues are allegories of different days of the rebellion. Atop rises a 23 meter obelisk, inscribed with the names of nearly 100 martyrs, crowned by a stellate pinnacle. The work was considered novel and unconventional. In 1900, Rollins Willard criticized the work as\n0332 - Milano - Giuseppe Grandi (1843-1894) - Monumento alle 5 giornate, (1895) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto.jpg|Day 1: Ringing the bell to call the city to arms\n0338 - Milano - Giuseppe Grandi (1843-1894) - Monumento alle 5 giornate, (1895) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto.jpg|Day 2: Sorrow cries for the martyrs\n0344 - Milano - Giuseppe Grandi (1843-1894) - Monumento alle 5 giornate, (1895) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto.jpg|Day 3: Call to the barricades\n0345 - Milano - Giuseppe Grandi (1843-1894) - Monumento alle 5 giornate, (1895) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto.jpg|Day 4 and 5: Fame (on the right above) lifts Victory upward (upper left with legs dangling and blowing a trumpet)\n0364 - Milano - Giuseppe Grandi (1843-1894) - Monumento alle 5 giornate, (1895) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto.jpg|Lion among the debris of the barricades, representing the defense\n0368 - Milano - Giuseppe Grandi (1843-1894) - Monumento alle 5 giornate, (1895) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto.jpg|Eagle of victory\nReferences\n*Derived from Italian Wikipedia entry"
