The peak is situated in Chugach National Forest,  northeast of Bear Glacier,  south-southeast of Marathon Mountain, and  southwest of Seward, Alaska. The peak's local name was reported in 1951 by the U.S. Geological Survey. The months May and June offer the most favorable weather for viewing the mountain. In fair weather, the Harding Icefield can be seen from the summit.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Bear Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from the north slope of the mountain drains into Lowell Creek, and the south side drains into Spruce Creek, and both creeks empty into Resurrection Bay.\nGallery\nSeward Coastline, Bear Mountain.jpg|Southeast aspect of Bear Mountain\nSee also\n}}\n*List of mountain peaks of Alaska\n*Geology of Alaska\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Bear Mountain [https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=60.0810&lon=-149.4974#.X9cvmXqSmUk Weather Forecast]"
