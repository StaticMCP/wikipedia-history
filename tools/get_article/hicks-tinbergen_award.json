Until 2002, the journal of the EEA was the European Economic Review, which was subsequently replaced by the Journal of the European Economic Association. The Hicks-Tinbergen Award is generally awarded at the EEA's Annual Congress, after a committee of three economists has selected the winner among the nominations submitted by EEA members.\nPast Recipients\nA complete list of the past recipients of the Hicks-Tinbergen Award can be found on the website of the EEA.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
