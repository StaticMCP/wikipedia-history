First held in 2004, the ceremony is produced by C31 Melbourne, and is broadcast by terrestrial community television stations (colloquially known as Channel 31) across Australia.\nNominations are accepted from producers, presenters and other volunteers within the sector for programming produced within the eligibility period of each ceremony. Entries are judged entirely by a panel decided by the event organisers; previously, the Viewers' Choice Award allowed for Channel 31 viewers to nominate their favourite programs in a given year.\nBetween 2004 and 2010 the awards were held annually – first at RMIT University's Storey Hall, and later at the Deakin Edge at Federation Square. In 2014, the awards were revived to honour 20 years of community television in Brisbane and Melbourne, and were held again in 2019 to honour 25 years of C31 Melbourne.\nOriginal run\n2004\n2005\n*
