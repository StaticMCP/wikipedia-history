      "text": "# Red Sea (Warhorse album)\n\n}}\nRed Sea is the second and last album by English hard rock band  Warhorse. The band is most known for its bass player, who was the original bassist of Deep Purple (\"Mark 1\") from 1968 to 1969 for the first three albums.\nBackground\nThe CD reissue on the Angel Air label has six previously unreleased bonus tracks, including a live version of \"Ritual\" (from the first Warhorse album) and five demos all written by bassist Simper which did not appear on any record before.\nRichtie Unterberger claims, the album was \"basically more of the same prog rock-proto metal\". Except the song Confident But Wrong being  more mainstream rock sounding or the soul based I (Who Have Nothing). Singer Ashley Holts performance was not praised as he was \"tending to hit more annoying high notes\". Back in Time was mentioned for its \"unconscious models for the kind of singing\" which was parodied by Spinal Tap.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Warhorse, except where noted.\n#Red Sea 4:20\n#Back in Time 7:49\n#Confident But Wrong 4:46\n#Feeling Better 5:33\n#Sybilla 5:33\n#Mouthpiece (instrumental) 8:43\n#I (Who Have Nothing) (Carlo Donida / Jerry Leiber / Mike Stoller) 5:16\nCD re-issue tracks\n#Bad Time (Nick Simper) 4:40\n#She Was My Friend (Simper) 4:55\n#Gypsy Dancer (Simper) 4:08\n#House of Dolls (Simper) 4:19\n#Standing Right Behind You 4:35\nPersonnel\n* Ashley Holt – vocals\n* Pete Parks – guitar\n* Nick Simper – bass\n* Frank Wilson – keyboards, organ, piano\n* Mac Poole – drums\nAdditional personnel\n* Peter Parks – acoustic guitar\nProduction\n* Warhorse & Ian Kimmet - Producers\n* Rick Breach – photography, sleeve art, sleeve design\n* Dave Stock – engineer\n* Phillip Walker – liner notes\n* Nick Watson – remastering (CD reissue)\nReferences"
