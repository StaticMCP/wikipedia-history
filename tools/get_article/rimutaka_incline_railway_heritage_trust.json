The locomotive was involved in a washout accident on 16 July 1956 and plummeted 50 feet, while hauling a full load of freight from Wanganui to New Plymouth. Both crew survived. Too expensive to recover it remained in situ built into the embankment at Hāwera. The engine lay undisturbed until November 2001, when it was purchased for $1 by the Hooterville Heritage Trust, and in 2002 salvage work began after 46 years underground. The raised wreck minus tender was taken to Waitara. In 2007, The Taranaki Flyer Society Inc. was formed and AB745 was transported to its new home at the old railway goods shed at Stratford, where it was being restored. Lack of funds and the loss of the Stratford old railway goods shed led to the Society asking for expressions of interest in the locomotive. The Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust's proposal was accepted and it was moved to Maymorn in October 2013.\nTwo replica NZR H class \"Fell\" locomotives will be commissioned by the Trust to operate the incline section of their line for stage 3 of the project.\nWagons\nThe Trust has acquired 13 YC-class ballast wagons and 2 Q-class coal hopper wagons, currently located at their Maymorn site, and plans to use them in the construction of its line and for ongoing track maintenance.\nCarriages\nThe Trust's fleet includes five NZR 56-foot carriages and one NZR 50-foot carriage.  These vehicles will be restored after the rail vehicle shed is completed.\nMaymorn station\nA heritage-themed station based on the Troup-era Waimate station has been proposed for the Maymorn site. It was hoped to have this building completed by 2015, but this has not occurred.\nTrack\nTwo tracks have been laid east of the rail vehicle shed which are currently being used for vehicle storage.  Tracks are also being laid in the rail vehicle shed as part of the construction of the shed's floor and inspection pits.\nTwo potential routes have been identified to connect the Trust's operation at the Maymorn site to the original railway formation.\nRolling Stock\nNZR steam locomotives\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Key:\n|bgcolor=#F5D26C|In service\n|bgcolor=#89E579|In service, Mainline Certified\n|bgcolor=#f4a460|Under overhaul/restoration/repair\n|bgcolor=#DED7B6|Stored\n|bgcolor=#B7A4EB|Static display\n|bgcolor=#cecece|Scrapped\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
