Despite being under British protection, the Nizam received no support from Governor General John Shore, who adhered to a policy of non-intervention.\nThis strained relations between the Nizam and the British. Notably, this battle marked the last instance of all Maratha chiefs uniting under the leadership of Parshuram Bhau Patwardhan. The Maratha army included a vast force of cavalry, gunners, bowmen, artillery, and infantry.\nThe Nizam’s forces, commanded by Assud Ally and supported by French commander Michel Raymond, faced the Maratha troops led by Parshuram Bhau, Scindia, and Holkar. The Nizam fielded 17,000 infantry and cavalry, while the Marathas deployed 83,000 cavalry, 38,000 infantry, and 192 cannons. Early in the battle, Lal Khan, a Pathan commander in the Nizam's army, injured Parshuram Bhau but was later killed by Hari Pant. The Nizam's infantry, under Raymond, launched an attack on the Marathas, but Jivabadada Kerkar, leading Scindia’s forces, countered effectively, forcing the Hyderabad troops to retreat to the fort of Kharda.\nThe Marathas laid siege to the fort, cutting off the Nizam's supply lines. The siege, lasting 17 to 22 days, caused extreme hardships for the Nizam’s troops and animals, with many resorting to eating tamarind leaves. Conditions in the Nizam’s camp were dire, with water reportedly selling for a rupee per cup.\nUnder immense pressure, the Nizam sought negotiations, which concluded in April 1795. As part of the terms, the Nizam agreed to dismiss his minister, Azeem-ul-Omrah, who had insulted the Peshwa. This decisive Maratha victory not only showcased their military strength but also strained the relationship between the Nizam and the British, ultimately altering the region’s political dynamics.\nTreaty of Kharda\nThe treaty of Kharda banned cow slaughter in the Deccan. Nizam of Hyderabad after the Nizam was defeated in battle and forced to pay a large indemnity and cede territory to the Maratha Empire, including Daulatabad, Aurangabad, and Sholapur.\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*"
