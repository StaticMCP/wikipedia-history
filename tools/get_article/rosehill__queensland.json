In the , Rosehill had a population of 134 people.\nGeography\nThe Condamine River forms the south-western and southern boundary of the locality.\nThe South Western railway line enters the locality from the south-east (Warwick) and exits to the north-west (Toolburra). The Warwick Allora Road (also known locally as Rosehill Road) enters the locality from the south-east (Warwick), immediately parallel and south of the railway line. Within Rosehilll, the road crosses the railway line and runs north of it, but then resumes an immediately parallel course with the railway line but to north, exiting with the railway to Toolburra.\nWithin the locality, the terrain to the south of the railway line is flatter land with access to the river, while the terrain to the north has more hills. This is reflected in the land use which is mostly crop-growing south of the railway line and grazing on native vegetation to the north.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from the former Rosehill railway station (previously known as Lyndhurst Road, then Lyndhurst, and renamed to Rosehill in September 1885). The name refers to a local big hill covered in rosemary bush. The station was established by 1876. It had closed by 1951, despite the protests of local farmers. The station was at on the southern side of the Warwick Allora Road (approx ).\nRosehill Provisional School opened circa 1890 but closed circa 1899.

It closed permanently on 31 December 1966. It was on the northern side of Warwick Allora Road ().\nDemographics\nIn the , Rosehill had a population of 126 people.\nIn the , Rosehill had a population of 134 people.\nEconomy\nThere are two homesteads in the area:\n* Rosehill  ()\n* Lyndhurst ()\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Rosehill.
