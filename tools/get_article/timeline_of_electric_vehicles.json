It initially drew current from the rails, with overhead wire being installed in 1883.\n1882\n* The trolleybus dates back to 29 April 1882, when Dr. Ernst Werner Siemens demonstrated his \"Elektromote\" in a Berlin suburb. This experiment continued until 13 June 1882.\n* Anthony Reckenzaun designs the first significant electric launch driven by storage batteries, and names the boat Electricity.\n1883\n* Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram, Vienna, Austria, first electric tram powered by overhead wire.\n1884\n* Thomas Parker&nbsp;built an electric car in&nbsp;Wolverhampton&nbsp;using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries.\n1888\n* 8 September: Peral, the first successful submarine to be entirely powered by electric batteries and the first fully military-capable submarine, is launched.\n20th century\n1970s\n1973\n* 23 October: first crewed free flight by an electrically powered aeroplane, the MB-E1 (9 minutes)\n1974\n* AstroFlight Sunrise makes maiden flight, first aircraft to fly on solar power.\n1979\n* The Mauro Solar Riser becomes the first crewed aircraft to fly on solar power.\n1990s\n1996\n* December: Launch of the limited production General Motors EV1\n1997\n* Toyota RAV4 EV becomes first plug-in electric production SUV. Leases are mostly restricted to governments and businesses in California.\n* Toyota Prius becomes the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle.\n1998\n* Launch of Nissan Altra EV, becoming the first highway legal electric car to use lithium-ion batteries\n21st century\n2000s\n2003\n* first certificate of airworthiness for an electric powered aircraft was granted to the Lange Antares 20E.\n2008\n* Tesla Roadster becomes the first highway legal, serial production, all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells, and the first production all-electric car with a range of more than  per charge.\n2009\n* July: Launch of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, the first modern highway legal series production electric car\n2010s\n2010\n* 8 July: Solar Impulse 1 achieves the world's first manned 26-hour solar-powered flight, as well as the longest and highest ever flown by a manned solar-powered aircraft.\n* December: Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Volt deliveries began\n2011\n* The Nissan Leaf passed the Mitsubishi i MiEV as the world's all-time best selling all-electric car\n* Taurus Electro G2 becomes the first two-seat electric aircraft to have achieved series production.\n2012\n* June:\n** Solar Impulse 1 achieves first intercontinental flight by a solar aircraft, flying from Madrid, Spain to Rabat, Morocco.\n** Launch of the Tesla Model S\n2014\n* March: 1% of all cars in use in Norway are plug-ins\n* first production-model all-electric school bus was delivered to the Kings Canyon Unified School District in California's San Joaquin Valley\n2015\n* 3 July: Solar Impulse 2 lands in Hawaii on 3 July, setting new records for the world's longest solar-powered flight both by time (117 hours, 52 minutes) and distance (7,212&nbsp;km; 4,481&nbsp;mi). The flight's duration was also a record for longest solo flight, by time, for any aircraft.\n* September: Cumulative global plug-in sales passed 1&nbsp;million units.\n2016\n* June 20-23: Solar Impulse 2 makes the first non-stop solar-powered transatlantic flight\n* July: Solar Impulse 2 lands in Abu Dhabi, completing circumnavigation of the world\n* November: Global all-electric car/van sales passed 1&nbsp;million.\n* December:\n** Cumulative global plug-in sales passed 2&nbsp;million units\n** 5% of passenger cars on Norwegian roads are plug-ins\n2017\n* Early: 1&nbsp;millionth domestic new energy car sold in China\n* July: Launch of the Tesla Model 3\n* November: Cumulative global plug-in sales passed 3&nbsp;million units\n* December:\n** Annual global sales passed the 1&nbsp;million unit mark\n** 5% of all cars in use in Norway are all-electric.\n** Annual global market share passed 1% for the first time\n2018\n* First half: 1&nbsp;millionth plug-in electric car sold in Europe\n* September:\n** 1&nbsp;millionth plug-in electric car sold in the U.S.\n** 2&nbsp;millionth new energy vehicle sold in China (includes heavy-duty commercial vehicles)\n* October: 10% of passenger cars on Norwegian roads are plug-ins\n* November: 500,000th plug-in car sold in California\n* December:\n** Annual global sales passed the 2&nbsp;million unit mark\n** Tesla Model 3 becomes first plug-in to exceed 100,000 sales in a single year\n2019\n* December: One out of two new passenger cars registered in Norway in 2019 was a plug-in electric car\n2020s\n2020\n* Early: The Tesla Model 3 surpassed the Nissan Leaf as the world's best selling plug-in electric car in history\n* March:\n** The Tesla Model 3 is the first electric car to sell more than 500,000 units since inception.\n** Tesla, Inc. becomes the first auto manufacturer to produce 1&nbsp;million electric cars\n* April: 10% of all cars on the road in Norway are all-electric\n* June: the Velis Electro variant of the two-seat Pipistrel Virus was the first electric aircraft to secure type certification, from the EASA\n* December:\n** Nissan Leaf global sales reached 500,000 units.\n** Cumulative global plug-in car sales passed the 10&nbsp;million unit milestone\n** The Norwegian plug-in car segment achieved a record annual market share of 74.7% of new car sales.\n** Over 15% of all cars on Norwegian roads are plug-in electric.\n2021\n* September: Rivian R1T becomes the first plug-in electric production pickup truck.\n2022\n* May: Cumulative global plug-in car sales passed the 20 million unit milestone\n2023\n* January: EV cars surpass 10% in global market share\n* May: Tesla Model Y becomes the world's best selling vehicle\n2025\n* June: Kyle Clark, the founder and CEO of the Burlington, Vermont-based company BETA Technologies, piloted the Alia CX300 to the John F.
