      "text": "# Matthew Yang King\n\nMatt Yang King is an American actor. He appears in the Netflix series Avatar: The Last Airbender as Appa and Momo, in Pixar's Elemental and the Netflix series Not Quite Narwhal, as well as Riverdale, Powers, 24, Strong Medicine, and Numbers. He created the short films The World of Steam, The Duelist and has provided voiceover work for numerous television shows, video games, and commercials including Love, Death & Robots, Studio Ghibli's 25th Anniversary English dub of Only Yesterday with Daisy Ridley, the World of Warcraft franchise, Cyberpunk 2077, G.I. Joe: Renegades, Transformers: Robots in Disguise, Fortnite, Supah Ninjas, and Marvel Heroes.\nEarly life\nKing studied acting at New York University Tisch School of the Arts and lived in New York until 1998, when he left to tour the United States with the musical Titanic, playing Quartermaster Robert Hichens and Bandsman Bricoux. The tour began in Los Angeles.\nCareer\nVoice acting\nKing has provided numerous voices for television, film, and video games, from the voice of the Host in \"The Witness\" and Liang and Renshu in \"Good Hunting\". His work includes Father and Kozou in Studio Ghibli's Only Yesterday, Illidan Stormrage in the World of Warcraft franchise, The Persuader in Bruce Timm's Justice League vs The Fatal Five, The Atom in Injustice 2, Eian in Batman Ninja, and the voices of Splinter and Shredder in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT). King is the voice of Apple in numerous television ads and also voiced both Liu Kang and Fujin in Mortal Kombat 11 and also voiced Kung Lao in the animated film Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms.\nAdditionally, King was one of the creators and hosts of the long-running podcast, GeeksOn, with Aaron Hendricks, Donald Marshall, and Peter Gamble Robinson.\nFilm and television\nKing has had recurring roles on Riverdale, Numbers, 24, and Strong Medicine. He starred opposite Danny Huston in the Bernard Rose film The Kreutzer Sonata, which also features King playing the violin.\nStage\nKing's stage credits include the first Broadway touring production of Titanic: The Musical, East West Players' Yankee Dawg You Die as Bradley with Sab Shimono and The Tempest as Caliban with fellow NYU Tisch alumnus Daniel Dae Kim, and an NAACP award-winning hip-hop version of The Two Gentlemen of Verona called ''2G's'' at Los Angeles' Sacred Fools Theater.\nWriting\nFrustrated with playing stereotypically Asian roles in the early-mid 2000s, King began writing to create roles for minority actors \"that people felt they could wrap their brains around that were about being ethnic...[and] racism.\" The Harrowing, his script with Peter Gamble featuring an African-American man as the lead in a horror film is in development.\nCrowdfunding projects\nIn 2017, King collaborated with cartoonist Ellipsis Stephens and fellow producers Phil LaMarr and Danielle Stephens to bring Stephen's webcomic, Goblins, to life as an animated series. The Goblins Animated campaign on Indiegogo was to produce a five-minute long mega-trailer/pilot that could be used to garner more interest in the project. King himself voices one of the characters, Fumbles. Notable voice actors make up the rest of the cast, including Phil LaMarr as Complains of Names, Billy West as Minmax, Maurice LaMarche as Forgath, Jim Cummings as Thaco, Tara Strong as Saves a Fox, Matthew Mercer as Big Ears, Jennifer Hale as Kin, and Steve Blum as Kore. The mega-trailer is currently under production.\nIn 2012, King created a Kickstarter project for his steampunk webseries called The World of Steam. Written, directed, and produced by King, the show is set in a Twilight Zone-type steampunk universe and featured Scott Folsom, Gail Folsom, Gina Torres, Mido Hamada, Karl E. Landler, Julian Curtis, Robin Atkin Downes, and King himself as the host, Mr. Liang. At the time, the series was the highest-grossing webseries ever on Kickstarter. The first episode, The Clockwork Heart, was released as a webisode in 2013 and contains music by composer Bear McCreary. The remainder of the series is still in the works and is being developed for television.\nSteampunk work\nAfter the creation of the World of Steam webseries in 2012, King was seen as a leader in the Steampunk creative community. As a result, he was invited to serve as one of the three judges on the first-ever network Steampunk-themed reality show, Game Show Network's ''Steampunk'd in 2015. King cites his Steampunk influces as H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, H.P. Lovecraft, K.W. Jeter, Robert Howard, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and China Mieville, among others. He collaborated with Scott and Gail Folsom from the League of STEAM on the pilot episode for the World of Steam, \"The Clockwork Heart,\" and was cited in the 2016 book, Like Clockwork: Steampunk Pasts, Presents, and Futures, edited by Rachel A. Bowser and Brian Croxall. His Love, Death and Robots episode, \"Good Hunting,\" is Asian-inspired Steampunk. King has appeared at various Steampunk conventions as a presenter and judge, and is currently collaborating with Cheyenne Wright of Girl Genius on a new Steampunk project called The Cabinet of Curiosities.\nConvention appearances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Date\n!Convention\n!Location\n!Activity\n!Notes\n|-\n|2009\n|VCON 34\n|Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n|Guest of Honor: GeeksOn podcast\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Midwest Media Expo (M2X)\n|Detroit, Michigan\n|Panel host/panelist: The World of Steam\n|Inaugural year for this convention\n|-\n|2018\n|Clockwork Alchemy\n|Burlingame, California\n|Speaker and presenter\n|\n|}\nFilmography\nLive action roles\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|2001\n|Crossing Jordan\n|Dr. Yeung\n|Episode: \"Blue Christmas\"\n|-\n|2001\n|ER\n|Rick\n|Episode: \"Four Corners\"\n|-\n|2002\n|MDs\n|2nd Year Student\n|Episode: \"Time of Death\"\n|-\n|2002\n|The West Wing''\n|Staffer\n|Episode: \"Hartsfield's Landing\"\n|-\n|2002\n|Friends\n|The Student\n|Episode: \"The One Where Joey Dates Rachel\"\n|-\n|2003\n|Threat Matrix\n|Broker #2\n|Episode: \"Pilot\"\n|-\n|2003\n|The Even Stevens Movie\n|Scott\n|TV movie\n|-\n|2003\n|Frasier\n|Thad\n|Episode: \"Daphne Does Dinner\"\n|-\n|2003–2006\n|Strong Medicine\n|Dr. Matt Linn / First Year / First Year Medical Student\n|27 episodes\n|-\n|2004\n|''It's All Relative\n|Matthew\n|Episode: \"Our Sauce, It Is a Beauty\"\n|-\n|2005\n|The New Partridge Family\n|Benjamin\n|TV movie\n|-\n|2005\n|CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\n|Yak #2\n|Episode: \"Snakes\"\n|-\n|2005–2010\n|Numbers\n|Matt Li / Technician / Crime Scene Tech / Tech / FBI Tech Agent / FBI Computer Tech #1 / FBI Tech Agent #2\n|14 episodes\n|-\n|2007\n|CSI: NY''\n|Kim Wey\n|Episodes: \"Child's Play\"\n|-\n|2008\n|Eli Stone\n|Tommy Woo\n|2 episodes\n|-\n|2009\n|Washington Field\n|SA Mark Chen\n|TV movie\n|-\n|2009\n|Bones\n|Dr. Marcus Scheer\n|Episode: \"The Cinderella in the Cardboard\"\n|-\n|2010\n|Hub Exclusive: G.I.
