After two albums on Capitol Records—Ready to Strike (November 9, 1985) and Thrill of a Lifetime (1986)—and the independent release King Kobra III in 1988, Appice decided to dissolve the band and join guitarist John Sykes for his Blue Murder project in 1989.\nA new King Kobra emerged in 2010 with Carmine Appice on drums, Paul Shortino taking over vocal duties, Mick Sweda on guitar, David Henzerling (a.k.a. David Michael-Philips) on guitar, and Johnny Rod on bass. This lineup released the self-titled album King Kobra in 2011 on Frontiers Records and another album in 2013, titled King Kobra II.\nThe band went on hiatus following the release of their 2013 album, largely due to the other commitments of the individual band members, They played live gigs again in 2016 without Mick Sweda.\nOn July 18, 2023, the band announced their new album, We Are Warriors, will be released on August 11. The title track was also released as a single. The line up features new guitarists Carlos Cavazo and Rowan Robertson, formerly of Quiet Riot and Dio respectively.\nOriginal King Kobra vocalist Marcie Free died on October 23, 2025.\nBand
