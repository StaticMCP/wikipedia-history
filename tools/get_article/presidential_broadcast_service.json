AM), Radyo Pilipinas – Sports Radio (918 KHz. AM), Radyo Pilipinas – Radyo Magasin (1278 KHz. AM), Republika (87.5&nbsp;MHz. FM) and The Capital (104.3), as well as international shortwave station Radyo Pilipinas World Service. PBS, along with its television network counterparts People's Television Network, Radio Philippines Network and Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation, which forms the media arm of the PCO.\nAs one of the attached agencies of the OPS, the PBS-BBS receives funding from the General Appropriations Act (Annual National Budget) and sales from blocktimers and advertisers, among others.\nHistory\nCommonwealth and Third Republic\nOn May 8, 1933, the United States-sponsored Insular Government established and operated radio station DZFM (then KZSO, later KZFM) in the Philippines on the frequency of 710 kilohertz with a power of 10,000 watts through the United States Information Service. In September 1946, two months after the restoration of Philippine independence thru the Treaty of Manila, KZFM was turned over to the Philippine government. With the transfer was born the Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS), the second broadcasting organization after Manila Broadcasting Company (now MBC Media Group).\nKZFM first operated under the Department of Foreign Affairs until it was transferred to the Radio Broadcasting Board (RBB), created by President Manuel Quezon on September 3, 1937. In 1947, an International Telecommunications Conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey, assigned the initial letters DU-DZ to replace K as the callsign prefixes for all radio stations in the Philippines. On January 1, 1952, the RBB was abolished to give way to the establishment of the Philippine Information Council (PIC) which assumed the function of the RBB, including the operation of DZFM. On July 1, 1952, after the PIC was abolished, DZFM and the Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS) operated under the Office of the President. In 1959, they were both placed under the newly created Department of Public Information (DPI).\nYears hence, the PBS acquired 13 more radio stations, one TV station it time-shared with two other organizations, and changed its name to Bureau of Broadcast Services. September 13 is marked as the anniversary of the PBS.\nIn the 1960s, PBS' radio network expanded to the key provinces with DZEQ in Baguio, DYMR in Cebu City, DYCI in Iloilo City, DXRP in Davao City and DZMQ in Dagupan.\nMartial law period\nAt the same time that the BBS creating its network, another government organization was building up its broadcast capability to rival, or in some instances, complement, that of the BBS. The National Media Production Center (NMPC) had acquired the facilities of Voice of America in Malolos, Bulacan, in 1965 and steadily brought the old complex up to standards by a steady overhaul, fine-tuning, and outright replacement of outmoded equipment and machines. The NMPC operated the Voice of the Philippines (VOP), on both medium wave (920&nbsp;kHz) and shortwave (9.81&nbsp;MHz) transmissions. In 1975, the NMPC obtained DZRB-FM. With this new station and some provincial stations that came under its wings earlier, the NMPC was a network and effectively covered a wide range of the Philippine listenership.\nIn the 1970s, public broadcasting in the Philippines was thus represented by the BBS and the NMPC and catered to the educational and cultural needs of its audiences while endeavoring to keep it entertained with fare from indigenous material. Public service features were the keystone of its programs.\nDuring the final months of Martial Law, both the BB and the NMPC were brought under one administrative roof in 1980 when the Office of Media Affairs was created to provide a loose union for both networks within the Broadcast Plaza along Bohol (now Sgt. Esguerra) Avenue in Diliman, Quezon City. It was not an ideal situation, since, as there had been no clear guidelines on the proper implementation of their respective operational strategies, the BB and the NMPC often squabbled, to the detriment of public broadcasting goals. Unification had created more problems for the OMA to overcome.\nFifth Republic (since 1986)\nAfter the People Power Revolution, the Office of Media Affairs was abolished, followed by both the NMPC and the BB. Under Executive Order No. 297, on the basis of the OMA, President Corazon Aquino reestablished the Bureau of Broadcast Services (BBS) and reinstated PBS as the network under the Office of the Press Secretary's control, which led to the formation of a national radio service based on the stations in which both the NMPC and BBS had, with the PBS hosting two national AM stations and a national FM station in Manila and a number of provincial owned-and-operated and affiliate stations in the country's administrative regions.\nDuring the last months of the Aquino administration, PBS along with its TV counterpart, People's Television Network transferred its offices from ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center complex to PIA/Media Center Building in Visayas Avenue, Quezon City, Metro Manila, on January 22, 1992.\nOn January 2, 1995, PBS relaunched its flagship station (DZFM) as Radyo ng Bayan.\nDuring the first years in the administration of President Benigno Aquino III, the PBS-BBS was transferred to the newly created Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO), after the OPS was abolished.\nIn the beginning of 2017, PBS relaunched its FM radio service with the relaunch of FM2 and the debut of FM1 as well, forming the basis of the national FM radio division under the agency, which was later reinforced by the launch of FM1 Davao, the first state-owned regional FM radio station serving Metro Davao.\nOn June 5, 2017, as part of the network's 70th anniversary, PBS relaunched its flagship brand Radyo ng Bayan as Radyo Pilipinas. Three months later, on September 18, sports station DZSR merged its programming with infotainment/cultural station DZRM and became Radyo Pilipinas Dos.\nOn July 16, 2018, PBS-BBS and G Sat signed a Memorandum of agreement allowing PBS-BBS to add its channels to its G Sat radio channel lineup.\nIn October 2019, China donated over PHP130&nbsp;million worth of radio broadcast equipment to the PCOO's Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS). The donation includes live broadcast room equipment, FM broadcast transmitter equipment, and medium wave transmitter equipment. The Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) will soon begin the rehabilitation of at least 14 (10 AM and four FM station) PBS Radyo Pilipinas stations nationwide. In 2021, the PBS welcomed a new network into the ranks – Radio Kidlat, a community radio network owned and operated by provincial electric cooperatives.\nDuring his first State of the Nation Address, President Rodrigo Duterte announced that Congress would pass a proposed law merging the PBS with its TV counterpart, People's Television Network to form the People's Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), which serves a unified broadcasting entity of the republic encompassing radio, television, print and online media.\nOn April 10, 2023, DZRM officially rebranded as Radyo Pilipinas Tres which will serve as the country's public service station that aims to give information for disaster preparedness, bulletins and updates, and information dissemination.\nUnder Executive Order No. 16 series of 2023 (Reorganizing the Presidential Communications Office) issued in February 2023, the Philippine Broadcasting Service was renamed as the Presidential Broadcast Service – Bureau of Broadcast Services.\nPlatforms\nRadyo Pilipinas\nRadyo Pilipinas – Radyo Publiko (formerly known as Radyo ng Bayan), the flagship AM radio station of PBS-BBS, is situated at 738&nbsp;kHz on the AM band in Metro Manila with a power of 50&nbsp;kW, and a network of over 32 local/regional stations in the provinces. The station broadcasts on weekdays from 4 a.m. to 10 p.m. and weekends from 6 a.m. to 10&nbsp;pm. As the government's flagship radio station, it serves as a medium of development communication, a conduit between the government and the people, aiming to mobilize all sectors of society towards development and nationalism. Live, up-to-the-minute government news, live coverages of press conferences, as well as relevant information from different government sectors are featured here on this station.\nRadyo Pilipinas – Sports Radio (formerly known as Radyo Pilipinas Dos or RP2 Sports) is situated at 918&nbsp;kHz on the AM band with a power of 50&nbsp;kW. The station operates daily from 5 a.m. to 8&nbsp;pm. Sports Radio mainly airs sports talk programming and a few non-sports content such as morning simulcasts of Radyo Pilipinas and music-oriented shows every weekend. Since 2023, the coverage of live PBA games are also broadcast here.\nRadyo Pilipinas – Radyo Magasin (formerly known as Radyo Pilipinas Tres or RP3 Alert) is situated at 1278&nbsp;kHz on the AM band with a power of 10&nbsp;kW. The station operates daily from 5 a.m. to 7&nbsp;pm. Radyo Magasin mainly airs general information, culture-oriented programming and music-oriented shows every weekend. On October 5, 2020, PBS resumed the broadcast operations of DZRM, then the latter will also serve as disaster preparedness and information dissemination station aiming for the public to be prepared for any natural calamities.\nRadyo Pilipinas World Service is the network's official external radio station broadcasting on both shortwave and internet streaming, which caters to the Overseas Filipino Workers and Filipino communities around the world. The station operates daily from 11:30&nbsp;p.m. to noon PST (15:30–04:00 UTC). RP World Service main programming consists of 2–3 hours of broadcast in Filipino and English languages, and is transmitted via shortwave through the facilities of Voice of America in Tinang, Tarlac.\nThe current station manager of Radyo Pilipinas is Alan Allanigue, while the current station managers of Sports Radio, Radyo Magasin and World Service are Cecille Quimlat, Marinela Tecson and Rey Sampang.\nFM division\nIn 2016, radio veteran Rizal \"Sonny B\" Aportadera, Jr. was appointed by then-PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar as the Director General of the Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS). Aportadera spearheaded the establishment of its FM networks: Republika ni Juan and The Capital (formerly known as FM1 and FM2).\nRepublika is PBS' music station, focused on the music from year 2000 to current hits and the local music. The station is situated at 87.5&nbsp;MHz in Metro Manila and 87.9&nbsp;MHz in Davao City, and is planning to expand in major cities in the country including: Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, Bacolod, Iloilo, Baguio, Bohol, Boracay, General Santos, Laoag, Butuan and Zamboanga.\nThe Capital is PBS' music station focused on adult contemporary music from the 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000s. It is situated at 104.3&nbsp;MHz in Metro Manila, and is recognized as the number one niche radio station in the A/B/C market based on Nielsen Ratings.\nBoth Republika and The Capital are currently managed by station manager Cheryll Ayuste.\nNew Media Unit\n, the FM division's stations are becoming more and more active in the social media spaces. In line with this, the New Media Unit was formed headed by Deputy Director General Joan Marie Sy-Domingo. The New Media Unit is the in-house graphic design and social media marketing group for Republ1ka FM1 and Capital FM2. They are the dynamic group responsible for consistently and constantly releasing relevant and engaging social media content.\nThe New Media Unit is also the group that produces the Republikast shows aired on Republ1ka FM1's social media channels on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. The shows are Fresh 1, Juan On 1 and FM1 Spotlight published weekly. There is also FM1 Spotlight: Livecast Edition broadcast live on Facebook and YouTube. Its schedule varies according to artists' availability.\nAt the beginning of imposed community quarantines due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the New Media Unit were engaged in delivering and posting relevant content to inform its audience of minimum health standards and other government announcements in relation to the quarantines and other health protocols.\nPBS stations\nThe following is a list of radio stations owned and affiliated by PBS.\nRadyo Pilipinas\nLuzon\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!
