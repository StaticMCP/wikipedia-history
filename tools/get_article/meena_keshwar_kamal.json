Despite the Saur Revolution and women's rights being placed high on the Democratic Republic's agenda, Kamal felt that there was no vast changes of women's deprivation in Afghanistan. In 1979 she campaigned against the government, and organized meetings in schools to mobilize support against it, and in 1981, she launched a bilingual feminist magazine, Payam-e-Zan (Women's Message). She also founded Watan Schools to aid refugee children and their mothers, offering both hospitalization and the teaching of practical skills.\nAt the end of 1981, by invitation of the French Government, Meena represented the Afghan resistance movement at the French Socialist Party Congress. The Soviet delegation at the Congress, headed by Boris Ponamaryev, left the hall as participants cheered when Meena started waving a victory sign. She would eventually move and base her RAWA organization in Quetta, Pakistan, in opposition to the Afghan Marxist government.\nPersonal life\nKamal was married, in 1976, to Afghanistan Liberation Organization leader Faiz Ahmad, who was murdered in Peshawar, Pakistan, by agents of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar on 12 November 1986. Meena was murdered less than 3 months afterwards. They had three children, whose whereabouts are unknown.\nAssassination\nKamal was assassinated in Quetta, Pakistan on 4 February 1987. Reports vary as to who the assassins were, but are believed to have been agents of the Afghan Intelligence Service KHAD, the Afghan secret police. In May 2002, two men were hanged in Pakistan after being convicted of Kamal's murder.\nLegacy\nA special issue of Time magazine on 13 November 2006, included Meena among \"60 Asian Heroes\" and wrote: \"Although she was only 30 when she died, Meena had already planted the seeds of an Afghan women's rights movement based on the power of knowledge.\"\nRAWA says of her \"Meena gave 12 years of her short but brilliant life to struggle for her homeland and her people. She had a strong belief that despite the darkness of illiteracy, ignorance of fundamentalism, and corruption and decadence of sell outs imposed on our women under the name of freedom and equality, finally that half of population will be awaken  and cross the path towards freedom, democracy and women's rights. The enemy was rightly shivering with fear by the love and respect that Meena was creating within the hearts of our people. They knew that within the fire of her fights all the enemies of freedom, democracy and women would be turned to ashes.\"\nAn enduring quote from Meena states:\nSee also\n*Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan\n*Taliban treatment of women\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rawa.org/meena.html RAWA's biography of Meena]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070112202432/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/in_meena.html Meena, an inspiration (Time Magazine, November 13, 2006)]\n*[http://www.rawa.org/album.htm More photos]\n*[http://www.rawa.org/ill.htm Full text of Meena's Poem \"I'll Never Return\"]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230232/http://www.rawa.us/rawasongs/mp3s/korean.mp3 A song by Korean singer Hae Kyoung Ahn based on Meena's above poem]\n*[http://www.geocities.com/comrade_meena A Biography]"
