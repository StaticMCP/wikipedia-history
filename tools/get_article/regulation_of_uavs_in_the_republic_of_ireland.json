An appendix contained an application form to apply to operate a UAS. The only previous legislation had been the \"Irish Aviation Authority (Rockets and Small Aircraft) Order, 2000\".\nThe IAA policy is that unmanned aerial systems may not be flown without the operator receiving a specific permission from the IAA. Where such a craft is to be used for commercial work, the operator must apply for an aerial work permission from the IAA. Flying UAS outside the direct, unaided line of sight of the operator is not allowed for safety reasons. It is not permitted to use vision-enhancing systems, such as first-person view.\nOn 15 November 2012, the Irish Aviation Authority introduced a requirement that remotely piloted aircraft needed to be registered to comply with Statutory Instrument 634 or 2005 \"Nationality and Registration of Aircraft\" Order.\nOn 12 July 2014, the Irish Times reported that the Irish Aviation Authority had issued permits to 22 operators to use UAVs in the Republic, as opposed to 14 the year before. The IAA said each permit issued by the IAA contained the stated reason the operator was using the UAV but that it could not release details of those who were licensed because of data protection legislation.\nNew regulations, including a registry of UAVs over 1&nbsp;kg (35&nbsp;oz) were introduced in December 2015.\nSmall Unmanned Aircraft (Drones) and Rockets Order Statutory Instrument 563 of 2015\nThis statutory instrument prohibits UAVs from flying\n* in a manner that is a hazard to another flying aircraft\n* in a manner that endangers life or property\n* within a prohibited area, a restricted area, or controlled airspace, without prior permission.\n* further than  from the operator, more than  from the ground, or out of line of sight\n* within  of an active aerodrome\n* within  of any person, structure or vessel, not under the operators' control\n* within  of a group of 12 or more people, not under the operators' control\nThe operator of a UAV of between  shall not allow it to fly without taking a course approved by the IAA.\nThe operator of a UAV of between  shall not allow it to fly without permission from the IAA.\nA rocket may not be flown without supplying information to and receiving permission from the IAA.The operator of a UAV of between  shall not allow it to fly without taking a course approved by the IAA.\nThe order applies to:\n* UAVs of less than\n* unmanned rockets of more than  fuelled mass and more than  of propellant\nThe order does not apply to:\n* fireworks launched under 400&nbsp;ft altitude unless launched near an aerodrome\n* to a rocket of  or less propellant or slow-burning propellant made of paper, wood or frangible plastic that isn't operated in a manner hazardous to people, property or aircraft\n* to UAVs of less than 1&nbsp;kg (35&nbsp;oz) without fuel or made of wood, paper or frangible plastic that is flown below 15m (50') altitude that isn't operated in a manner hazardous to people, property or aircraft\nThe instrument revokes the Irish Aviation Authority (Rockets and Small Aircraft) Order 2000, (S.I. No. 25 of 2000).\nSee also\n*Fireworks policy in the Republic of Ireland\nReferences"
