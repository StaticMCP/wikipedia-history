It was released on February 16, 2024, through Atlantic Records. His first studio album of original material in nearly nine years, following Everything Is 4 (2015), and it marks the longest gap between studio albums. It features collaborations with Michael Bublé, YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Gucci Mane, Quavo, Lay Bankz, Tesher, Robinson, the late Mikaben, David Guetta, Alexandra Shipp, and Nuka, alongside guest appearances from Nicki Minaj, Ty Dolla Sign, French Montana, Adam Levine, Dido, and Meghan Trainor. It serves as a follow-up to his EP 2Sides (Side 1) (2019), and is his first project not released through longtime labels Beluga Heights and Warner, which he left in 2020 due to creative differences.\nCritical reception\nMaura Johnston of Rolling Stone described Derulo as an \"audacious, occasionally ridiculous Pop-R&B smoothie\" on the record, but concluded that \"on a 27-song album, they can't all be hits\".\nTrack listing\n| extra1 =\n| length1 = 1:34\n| title2 = Spicy Margarita\n| note2 = with Michael Bublé\n| writer2 =\n| extra2 =\n| length2 = 2:34\n| title3 = Mad Love\n| note3 = with YoungBoy Never Broke Again\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 =\n| length3 = 3:30\n| title4 = U + I\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 =\n| length4 = 2:59\n| title5 = Lie to Me\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 = Payami\n| length5 = 3:21\n| title6 = Favorite Song\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 =\n| length6 = 2:36\n| title7 = POV\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 =\n| length7 = 3:44\n| title8 = Last Night\n| note8 = with Gucci Mane and Quavo\n| writer8 =\n| extra8 =\n| length8 = 2:22\n| title9 = Take You Dancing\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 =\n| length9 = 3:10\n| title10 = Don't Go Nowhere\n| writer10 =\n| extra10 =\n| length10 = 2:46\n| title11 = Proximity\n| writer11 =\n| extra11 =\n| length11 = 3:21\n| title12 = Limbo\n| note12 = with Lay Bankz\n| writer12 =\n| extra12 =\n| length12 = 2:22\n| title13 = Jalebi Baby\n| note13 = with Tesher\n| writer13 =\n| extra13 = Tesher\n| length13 = 2:49\n| title14 = Comatose\n| writer14 =\n| extra14 =\n| length14 = 2:44\n| title15 = Slow Low\n| writer15 =\n| extra15 =\n| length15 = 3:04\n| title16 = Swalla\n| note16 = featuring Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla Sign\n| writer16 =\n| extra16 = Ricky Reed\n| length16 = 3:36\n| title17 = Tip Toe\n| note17 = featuring French Montana\n| writer17 =\n| extra17 =\n| length17 = 3:07\n| title18 = Lifestyle\n| note18 = featuring Adam Levine\n| writer18 =\n| extra18 = Rice N' Peas\n| length18 = 2:33\n| title19 = When Love Sucks\n| note19 = featuring Dido\n| writer19 =\n| extra19 = Pink Slip\n| length19 = 2:49\n| title20 = Save the Last Dance\n| writer20 =\n| extra20 = Payami\n| length20 = 3:33\n| title21 = Ayo Girl\n| note21 = Haitian Konpa remix; with Robinson and Mikaben\n| writer21 =\n| extra21 = Larry LeTwins\n| length21 = 2:14\n| title22 = Down\n| note22 = with David Guetta\n| writer22 =\n| extra22 =\n| length22 = 2:09\n| title23 = So Many Hearts\n| writer23 =\n| extra23 = Goldstein\n| length23 = 2:33\n| title24 = Hands on Me\n| note24 = featuring Meghan Trainor\n| writer24 =\n| extra24 =\n| length24 = 3:03\n| title25 = Underwater\n| note25 = with Alexandra Shipp\n| writer25 =\n| extra25 =\n| length25 = 4:13\n| title26 = Love Not War (The Tampa Beat)\n| note26 = with Nuka\n| writer26 =\n| extra26 = Nuka\n| length26 = 3:11\n| title27 = Acapulco\n| writer27 =\n| extra27 =\n| length27 = 2:19\n| total_length = 78:16\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Nu King\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
