The battle was fought between United States troops under the command of General Stephen Kearny, and the Californio forces under the command of General Andres Pico on December 6, 1846.\nThe Native Sons of the Golden West were instrumental in raising money, preserving and ultimately creating the park which was then given to the state of California. It is now a California State Park as well as a California Historical Landmark. The  park is next to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, at San Pasqual Valley Road, south of Escondido, California, on Highway 78 in San Diego County.\nThe park is open only on weekends, and features a visitor center with displays about the cultural history of the San Pasqual Valley, exhibits, and a movie about the battle. Living history presentations are held at the park, with volunteers from the San Pasqual Battlefield Volunteer Association.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=655 San Pasqual Battlefield State Historic Park] – official site\n* [https://www.spbva.org/ San Pasqual Battlefield Volunteer Association]"
