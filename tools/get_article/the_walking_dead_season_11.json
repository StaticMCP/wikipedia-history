The eleventh season was officially announced on September 9, 2020, as the final season with Angela Kang serving as showrunner. In July 2020, AMC announced that season 11 would not premiere in October 2020 as planned due to production delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2014, executive producer David Alpert said that the comics have given them enough ideas for Rick Grimes and company over the next seven years. \"I happen to love working from source material, specifically because we have a pretty good idea of what season 10 is gonna be,\" Alpert said. He continued by saying: \"We know where seasons 11 and 12 [will be]... we have benchmarks and milestones for those seasons if we're lucky enough to get there.\" In September 2018, AMC CEO Josh Sapan further clarified Alpert's statement, saying the network plan on continuing The Walking Dead as a franchise for another 10 years, including new films and television series based on the original comic book series.\nAMC confirmed in September 2020 that the series would conclude with the eleventh season, covering 24 episodes over a two-year broadcast period, at the same time as announcing a spinoff series involving the characters Daryl and Carol, set to start airing in 2023. In April 2022, the project was retooled to be entirely Daryl-focused, and McBride departed the project. The series is set and to be filmed in Europe in mid-2022, which would make it logistically untenable for McBride.\nFilming\nIn March 2020, it was reported that pre-production had been halted and that filming would be delayed three to four weeks also due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming for the final season began in February 2021 and was completed in March 2022. The series moved from shooting on 16 mm film to digital beginning with the six bonus episodes from season 10. This change was prompted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and safety precautions with there being fewer \"touch points\" with digital than film. Showrunner Angela Kang stated they would use post-production techniques to maintain the look of the series. During filming in March 2022, Norman Reedus suffered from a concussion on set, which pushed back filming of the show's final episode.\nCasting\nIn October 2019, Lauren Cohan was confirmed to be returning to the series as Maggie, after being absent since early in the ninth season. Cohan officially returned to the series near the end of the tenth season. In July 2020, Margot Bingham was confirmed to reprise her role as Stephanie for this season; she previously appeared in season 10 in a voice-only role. In March 2021, it was announced that Michael James Shaw had been cast in the series regular role of Mercer. In April 2021, Jacob Young was cast as Deaver, a member of the Reapers. In September 2021, Jeffrey Dean Morgan's 11-year-old son, Gus Morgan, made a cameo appearance in the fifth episode as a featured walker.\nRelease\nThe final season, titled \"The Final Season Trilogy\", premiered on August 22, 2021, on AMC and contains 24 episodes that split into three eight-episode airing blocks, with the series concluded on November 20, 2022. It also premiered a week early on August 15, 2021, on AMC+ and each episode of the season was made available a week before its broadcast date, excluding the final episode. In the UK and Ireland, the season debuted on August 23, 2021, on Disney+ via its Star hub. The first nine episodes were all released on Disney+ in Denmark via Star on February 21, 2022.\nReception\nCritical response\nThe eleventh season of The Walking Dead has received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds a score of 80% with an average rating of 7 out of 10, based on 237 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"While the sense of finality is diminished by the promise of even more spinoffs, The Walking Deads eleventh conclusion is a solid enough conclusion to an epic tale of zombies that never had a clear offramp to begin with.\" Paul Dailly of TV Fanatic gave the first two episodes 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling the episodes \"dark, filled with stakes and nail-biting moments\". Writing for Forbes, Erik Kain gave the two-part premiere a positive review and considered them \"a pretty damn impressive introduction to Season 11\" and that they have him \"excited for what's to come\". In contrast, Kirsten Acuna of Insider wrote a slightly less positive review, stating that the episodes are \"decent\" and \"satisfying, but it doesn't feel like a big-budget premiere\" that she was hoping for.\nRatings\n| title2   = Acheron: Part II\n| date2    = August 29, 2021\n| rs2      = 0.5\n| viewers2 = 1.99\n| dvr2     = n/a\n| dvrv2    = n/a\n| total2   = n/a\n| totalv2  = n/a\n| title3   = Hunted\n| date3    = September 5, 2021\n| rs3      = 0.5\n| viewers3 = 1.87\n| dvr3     = n/a\n| dvrv3    = n/a\n| total3   = n/a\n| totalv3  = n/a\n| title4   = Rendition\n| date4    = September 12, 2021\n| rs4      = 0.5\n| viewers4 = 1.88\n| dvr4     = n/a\n| dvrv4    = n/a\n| total4   = n/a\n| totalv4  = n/a\n| title5   = Out of the Ashes\n| date5    = September 19, 2021\n| rs5      = 0.5\n| viewers5 = 1.91\n| dvr5     = n/a\n| dvrv5    = n/a\n| total5   = n/a\n| totalv5  = n/a\n| title6   = On the Inside\n| date6    = September 26, 2021\n| rs6      = 0.4\n| viewers6 = 1.78\n| dvr6     = n/a\n| dvrv6    = n/a\n| total6   = n/a\n| totalv6  = n/a\n| title7   = Promises Broken\n| date7    = October 3, 2021\n| rs7      = 0.5\n| viewers7 = 1.89\n| dvr7     = n/a\n| dvrv7    = n/a\n| total7   = n/a\n| totalv7  = n/a\n| title8   = For Blood\n| date8    = October 10, 2021\n| rs8      = 0.5\n| viewers8 = 1.91\n| dvr8     = n/a\n| dvrv8    = n/a\n| total8   = n/a\n| totalv8  = n/a\n| title9   = No Other Way\n| date9    = February 20, 2022\n| rs9      = 0.5\n| viewers9 = 1.76\n| dvr9     = n/a\n| dvrv9    = n/a\n| total9   = n/a\n| totalv9  = n/a\n| title10   = New Haunts\n| date10    = February 27, 2022\n| rs10      = 0.4\n| viewers10 = 1.60\n| dvr10     = n/a\n| dvrv10    = n/a\n| total10   = n/a\n| totalv10  = n/a\n| title11   = Rogue Element\n| date11    = March 6, 2022\n| rs11      = 0.4\n| viewers11 = 1.67\n| dvr11     = n/a\n| dvrv11    = n/a\n| total11   = n/a\n| totalv11  = n/a\n| title12   = The Lucky Ones\n| date12    = March 13, 2022\n| rs12      = 0.4\n| viewers12 = 1.58\n| dvr12     = n/a\n| dvrv12    = n/a\n| total12   = n/a\n| totalv12  = n/a\n| title13   = Warlords\n| date13    = March 20, 2022\n| rs13      = 0.5\n| viewers13 = 1.79\n| dvr13     = n/a\n| dvrv13    = n/a\n| total13   = n/a\n| totalv13  = n/a\n| title14   = The Rotten Core\n| date14    = March 27, 2022\n| rs14      = 0.4\n| viewers14 = 1.55\n| dvr14     = n/a\n| dvrv14    = n/a\n| total14   = n/a\n| totalv14  = n/a\n| title15   = Trust\n| date15    = April 3, 2022\n| rs15      = 0.4\n| viewers15 = 1.67\n| dvr15     = 0.4\n| dvrv15    = 1.03\n| total15   = 0.8\n| totalv15  = 2.70\n| title16   = Acts of God\n| date16    = April 10, 2022\n| rs16      = 0.4\n| viewers16 = 1.61\n| dvr16     = 0.3\n| dvrv16    = 1.05\n| total16   = 0.7\n| totalv16  = 2.66\n| title17   = Lockdown\n| date17    = October 2, 2022\n| rs17      = 0.3\n| viewers17 = 1.19\n| dvr17     = 0.2\n| dvrv17    = 0.96\n| total17   = 0.5\n| totalv17  = 2.15\n| title18   = A New Deal\n| date18    = October 9, 2022\n| rs18      = 0.3\n| viewers18 = 1.35\n| dvr18     = 0.3\n| dvrv18    = 0.89\n| total18   = 0.6\n| totalv18  = 2.24\n| title19   = Variant\n| date19    = October 16, 2022\n| rs19      = 0.3\n| viewers19 = 1.36\n| dvr19     = 0.3\n| dvrv19    = 0.99\n| total19   = 0.6\n| totalv19  = 2.35\n| title20   = What's Been Lost\n| date20    = October 23, 2022\n| rs20      = 0.3\n| viewers20 = 1.36\n| dvr20     = 0.3\n| dvrv20    = 0.92\n| total20   = 0.6\n| totalv20  = 2.28\n| title21   = Outpost 22\n| date21    = October 30, 2022\n| rs21      = 0.3\n| viewers21 = 1.50\n| dvr21     = n/a\n| dvrv21    = n/a\n| total21   = n/a\n| totalv21  = n/a\n| title22   = Faith\n| date22    = November 6, 2022\n| rs22      = 0.3\n| viewers22 = 1.39\n| dvr22     = n/a\n| dvrv22    = n/a\n| total22   = n/a\n| totalv22  = n/a\n| title23   = Family\n| date23    = November 13, 2022\n| rs23      = 0.3\n| viewers23 = 1.47\n| dvr23     = n/a\n| dvrv23    = n/a\n| total23   = n/a\n| totalv23  = n/a\n| title24   = Rest in Peace\n| date24    = November 20, 2022\n| rs24      = 0.7\n| viewers24 = 2.27\n| dvr24     = n/a\n| dvrv24    = n/a\n| total24   = n/a\n| totalv24  = n/a\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
