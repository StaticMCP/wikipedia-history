Produced by Sunrise and distributed by Showgate, the three-part film is a compilation of the television series, but with differences in storylines that serves as a separate continuity. The voice cast from the television series reprised their roles for the three-part film. The first film,  \"Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion Episode I: The Awakening Path\"|group=lower-alpha}} was released on October 21, 2017. The second film,  \"Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion Episode II: The Rebellion Path\"|group=lower-alpha}} was released on February 10, 2018. The third film,  \"Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion Episode III: The Imperial Path\"|group=lower-alpha}} was released on May 26, 2018.\nA sequel film, Code Geass Lelouch of the Re;surrection, was released in 2019, followed by a sequel four-part film, Code Geass: Rozé of the Recapture released in 2024.\nPlot\nCode Geass season 1|Code Geass season 2Code Geass R2}}\nThe three-part film largely covers the events of the main anime series. Initiation compiles Season 1, Episodes 1-17; Transgression covers Season 1, Episodes 18-25 and Season 2, Episodes   1-16; and Glorification covers Season 2, Episodes 17-25.\nAside from a few bonus scenes and cut plot points, by far the most significant change is the fate of Shirley Fenette. In this alternate continuity, Shirley’s father is never killed during the Battle of Narita, thus avoiding the chain of events that ultimately results in her own death. Instead, Shirley survives through the rest of the story, with plot details adjusted to be consistent with how they occur in the original continuity in spite of Shirley’s survival.\nIn a post-credits scene at the end of Glorification, C.C. is shown riding on horseback towards a ceremony at Jeremiah Gottwald’s orange farm that he and Shirley are hosting. The tracks from the hay cart she rode on at the end of the original series are shown on the road she is traveling on.\nVoice cast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Character !!
