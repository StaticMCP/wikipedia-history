In 2019, it was reported that it was listed as the second most popular attraction within the Rockhampton Region, with a 4.5 star rating on Tripadvisor.\nThe Rockhampton Heritage Village has also become a regular venue for local events.  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, market days were held every two months at the attraction.  Annual events such as the Rockhampton Cultural Festival, the Rockhampton Emergency Services Day and the Halloween Spooktacular are also held on the site. The venue also hosted the city's annual Carols by Candlelight event in 2012 during the temporary closure of the Rockhampton Music Bowl.\nFollowing the 2013 floods in Central Queensland associated with ex-Tropical Cyclone Oswald, a free concert was held for the local community at the Rockhampton Heritage Village featuring performers such as Ella Hooper and Beccy Cole.\nIn 2016, the venue was used as a filming location for We Were Tomorrow, an Australian science fiction program starring Gyton Grantley and Johnny Brady.\nA new showroom to store and display the Rockhampton Heritage Village's collection of historic vehicles including vintage cars, motorbikes and fire engines was opened in 2017.\nThe attraction is generally well supported by the local Rockhampton community. However, in 2020 a local media commentator questioned whether the Rockhampton Heritage Village was a financial burden for the council and suggested ways on how to attract more visitors throughout the year to help cover costs.  This included proposing the attraction become 100% carbon neutral, recycling its waste, growing organic fruit and vegetables on site, hosting market stalls that only sell environmentally-friendly goods and renewing a working relationship with the nearby Dreamtime Cultural Centre.\nAfter being temporarily closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruptive roadworks associated with the Rockhampton Northern Access Project which saw the Bruce Highway duplicated through Parkhurst, the Rockhampton Heritage Village re-opened in July 2021 with a lowered general admission fee of $5.\nLocal events soon returned to the venue following its reopening such as the Rockhampton Cultural Festival and the Rockhampton Heritage Village Christmas Fair.\nBuildings\nSome of the buildings at the Rockhampton Heritage Village include:\nInformation Centre: Serving as the main entrance to the venue, the tourist information centre also doubles as a gift shop and also houses the Hall of Clocks, an extensive display of vintage clocks dating back to 1630.
