As a result of long fighting, after two unsuccessful assaults and bloody positional battles, the Russians occupied the village. The fighting around the city led to its complete destruction.\nBattle\nIn Spring 1995, during the First Chechen War, many of the significant cities and areas had been captured by the Russian army, leaving Bamut as one of the last Chechen-controlled areas in the lowlands. On 10 March 1995, fierce battles began for the village of Bamut. Several attacks on the village by the Russian army had already failed, leaving the tanks and armored vehicles to litter in the streets. The core defense of the village was made up of fighters primarily from the village and surrounding areas most notably under the command of Khizir Khachukaev. \"The approaches to the village and its main streets were mined with anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. Some of the firing points were covered with reinforced concrete.\" In April, the Russians again tried to storm the village and the heights, due to poor coordination and weak artillery training, the assault failed, federal troops lost 18 people in the village and 10 on lysaya mountain.\nA pause in the hostilities was achieved in July 1995 as a result of the events in Budyonnovsk. Chechen fighters tried to carry out local offensives against Russian positions in April 1996, they lost 10 people in these battles, and the Russians lost 8. On 24 May 1996, the Russian army finally gained control of Bamut and the height 444.4 — \"Bald Mountain\". Ruslan Khaikhoroev's detachment defending Bamut broke out of the Russian encirclement, taking advantage of the twilight and the thickening fog. Although the Chechen troops were defeated, they only lost 350 people, several tanks and several mortars. Despite this, due to the long resistance of the smaller garrison, a legend about the \"fortress of Bamut\" arose around the city, which was perceived by Chechen society as a symbol of independence.\nIn works of art\n*\"Бамут\" - a song by Musa Nasagaev.\n*\"Бамут\" - a song by Timur Mutsurayev.\n*\"Я убит под Бамутом\" - a song written by Russian soldiers of the military unit 5598 26 BON in 1996.\nReferences\nNotes"
