It opened in August 2001 as the newest high school in the DeKalb County School System, and was named after the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.\nIts boundary includes a portion of Stonecrest.\nDevelopment\nThe school was opened to alleviate overcrowding in surrounding middle schools.  It originally included only grades 6-7 and 9-10.  Tenth grade students came from Lithonia and Southwest DeKalb High Schools to relieve crowding and also due to the rezoning of DeKalb County. The following year, after a protest by the high school students, the school dropped the sixth and seventh graders and added eighth grade.  It became a pure high school with grades 9-12 in the 2003-2004 school year.\nMLK's current principal is Harvey.\nFeeder school\nSalem Middle School is the middle school feeder to MLK.\nInternational Baccalaureate Diploma\nMLK implemented the International Baccalaureate Diploma program during the 2004-2005 school year.\nNotable alumni\n* Felicia Brown-Edwards, professional sprinter\n* Mack Brown, professional football player (Minnesota Vikings)\n* Kevin Byard, professional football player (Chicago Bears)\n* Crime Mob, southern rap group\n* Roland Rivers III, former college football player (Slippery Rock)\n* Cedric Hunter, professional baseball player (San Diego Padres)\nExternal links\n* [http://mlkinghs.dekalb.k12.ga.us/ Martin Luther King Jr. High School homepage]\n* [http://martinlutherkingathletics.com/ MLK Athletics page]\nReferences"
