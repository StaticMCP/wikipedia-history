The award, which was first presented in 2009, and again in 2011, is handed out at the discretion of the academy.\nWinners\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Recipient(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Production\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2009(51st)\n| Sam Doust, Meena Tharmarajah and Astrid Scott\n| Gallipoli: The First Day\n|}\nSee also\n*AACTA Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.aacta.org The Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Official website]"
