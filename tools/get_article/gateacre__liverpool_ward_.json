The Gateacre ward was created as a single-member ward from the north-eastern third of the former Woolton ward, small sections of the former Childwall and Belle Vale wards. The ward boundaries follow the North Liverpool Extension Line, Herdman Close, Gorsewood Road, Belle Vale Road, Gateacre Brow, Rose Brow, Woolton Road, around Childwall Woods, Childwall Lane, and Score Lane.}}\n§Kris Brown was a re-standing councillor for Woolton ward.\nReferences"
