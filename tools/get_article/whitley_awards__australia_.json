They commemorate Gilbert Whitley, an eminent Australian ichthyologist, and are presented for outstanding publications, either printed or electronic, that contain new information about the fauna of the Australasian region.\nFor a publication to receive a Whitley Award it must either make a significant contribution of new information, present a new synthesis of existing information, or present existing information in a more acceptable form.  All texts must contain a significant proportion of information that relates directly to Australasian zoology.  Moreover, all submissions must have been published within 18 months of the awards entry date.\nA presentation ceremony is held each year in September at the Australian Museum in Sydney when the authors and publishers of the winning titles receive their awards.\nAwards\nCertificates of Commendation may be awarded to publications judged as the best in various categories including, but not limited to, illustrated publications, textbooks, field guides, reference works, historical zoology, periodicals, handbooks, children’s publications, CD-ROMs, limited editions and videos.\nWhitley Medal\nThe Whitley Medal may be awarded to a publication deemed to be of superior quality that makes a landmark contribution to the understanding, content or dissemination of zoological knowledge.  The Whitley Medal is the top award in zoological publishing in Australia and is not necessarily awarded every year, though sometimes more than one medal may be awarded.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Whitley Medal Winners: 2000 to 2024\n!Year\n!Title\n!Author\n!Publisher\n|-\n|2024\n|Mammals of the South-west Pacific\n|Tyrone Lavery and Tim Flannery\n|CSIRO Publishing\n|-\n|2023\n|Prehistoric Australasia\n|Michael Archer, Suzanne Hand, John Long, Trevor Worthy and Peter Schouten (illustrator)\n|CSIRO Publishing\n|-\n|2022\n|Australian Deserts: Ecology and Landscapes\n|Steve Morton\n|CSIRO Publishing\n|-\n|2020\n|Hawkmoths of Australia: Identification, Biology and Distribution\n| Maxwell Moulds, James Tuttle and David Lane\n|CSIRO Publishing\n|-\n|2019\n|Zobi and the Zoox: A Story of Coral Bleaching\n| Ailsa Wild, Aviva Reed, Briony Barr & Gregory Crocetti\n|CSIRO Publishing\n|-\n|2018\n|Australian Echinoderms: Biology, Ecology and Evolution\n| Maria Byrne & Timothy O’Hara\n|CSIRO Publishing\n|-\n|2017\n|The Australian Bird Guide\n| Peter Menkhorst, Danny Rogers, Rohan Clarke, Jeff Davies, Peter Marsack & Kim Franklin\n|CSIRO Publishing\n|-\n|2016\n|Handbook of the Mammals of the World - Volume 5 Monotremes and MarsupialsThe Fishes of New Zealand Volumes 1-4\n|Don E.
