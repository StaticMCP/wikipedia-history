It can store notes, images and media, URLs, web pages, and passwords. Yojimbo can also encrypt any of its contents and store the password in the Keychain. It is Bare Bones' second Cocoa application.\nYojimbo can store almost any type of file. Users can \"throw\" as much information into the software as they want. One can tag items or organize them into folders. Yojimbo can organize files by file type; for example, all of the .docx and .pdf files are automatically sorted into a \"Documents\" folder, and all the .jpg or .svg files are put into an \"Images\" folder.\nHistory\nYojimbo was first released on January 23, 2006. At the time, Bare Bones called it \"a completely new information organizer\". The current list of versions released by Bare Bones are:\n* Yojimbo 1.1\n* Yojimbo 1.3\n* Yojimbo 1.5\n* Yojimbo 2.0\n* Yojimbo 2.1\n* Yojimbo 2.2\n* Yojimbo 3 and new iPad version\n* Yojimbo 4\n* Yojimbo 4.5\nIn 2007, another developer, Adrian Ross, created Webjimbo, a web interface through which users can access their Yojimbo libraries.\nLike other developers, Bare Bones Software faced difficulties adding iCloud sync due to early limitations in Apple's service. Tech reporter Christophe Laporte criticized Yojimbo's transition to iCloud as bungled, and expressed frustration at the lack of updates to the app.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/ Yojimbo homepage]"
