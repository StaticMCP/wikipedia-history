It was inspired by the economic reforms of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and was one of the many revolutions of 1989. It was led mostly by young demonstrators who rallied at Sükhbaatar Square, in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar. The main organisers of the demonstrations included Sanjaasürengiin Zorig, Erdeniin Bat-Üül, Davaadorjiin Ganbold, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, and Bat-Erdeniin Batbayar.\nAlthough one-party rule in Mongolia officially ended with the adoption of a new constitution on 12 February 1992, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) remained in power until it was voted out in favour of the Democratic Union Coalition in the 1996 parliamentary election. However, the country had already begun transitioning to a market economy by 1991, with the creation of the stock market and the Government Privatization Committee.\nBackground\nMongolia was previously a vassal state to the Qing dynasty. Starting with the pro-independence movements in 1911 against the colonisation policy of the late Qing dynasty, the country claimed its independence in 1921 with the help of the Soviet Union, after White Russian and Chinese forces had been expelled. However, the country was highly influenced by the Soviet Union, and would eventually become a one-party, socialist state by 1924. The Mongolian People's Party that played a crucial role in achieving independence from the Qing Dynasty would be renamed to the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) due to pressure from the Soviet Union.\nOver the following decades, Mongolia would become highly aligned with the Soviet Union and considered its \"satellite state\". Various extreme measures were taken to establish the Mongolian communist state including the persecution and purges of democratic leaders, lamas, and intellectuals. The massive transformations in the country included a complete ban of religious practices and the destruction of 700 monasteries, but also the construction of Mongolia's largest cities, the establishment of major industries, and the education of the masses. The Mongolian People's Republic was led by Marshal Khorloogiin Choibalsan from 1939 to 1952, followed by Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal who served as the leader of the state from 1952 to 1984, both of whom were regarded to be highly agreeable with the Soviet Union's increasing involvement in Mongolia.\nAfter the resignation of Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal in 1984, inspired by Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet Union, the new leadership under Jambyn Batmönkh implemented economic reforms but failed to appeal to those who, in late 1989, wanted broader changes.\nFrom protests to politburo resignation\nThe revolution of 1990 was primarily driven by young people who wanted a change in the country. One of the most critical groups that pushed for change was the Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU), a group of intellectuals influenced by revolutions in Eastern Europe. Concepts such as glasnost, freedom of speech and economic liberties that the intellectuals were exposed to abroad inspired the initial discussions that would lead to the revolution. The Mongolian Democratic Union was formed by the end of 1989. Many now-prominent figures such as Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj along with Dari-Sukhbaatar and Chimediin Enkhee were members of the union and would eventually come be known as the Thirteen Leaders of Mongolia's Democratic Revolution. Members of the Union and anyone associated with the movement had to be secretive to ensure their security. Members that were known to be associated with the organisation were laid off on the basis of \"engaging in conduct inconsistent with communist and socialist ideology\".\nin 1989]]\nOn the morning of 10 December 1989, the first open pro-democracy public demonstration occurred in front of the Youth Cultural Center in Ulaanbaatar where the creation of the Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU) was announced.\nThe protesters demanded a multi-party system, free elections with universal suffrage, the replacement of a centrally planned economy with a market economy, private property, re-organization of the government, and protection of human rights, particularly freedom of religion. The protesters injected a nationalist element into the protests by using traditional Mongolian script—which most Mongolians could not read—as a symbolic repudiation of the political system that had imposed the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet.\nDemonstrations drastically increased by late December when the news of Garry Kasparov's interview with Playboy broke. The interview suggested that the Soviet Union might sell Mongolia to China in order to raise money. On 2 January 1990, the MDU began distributing leaflets calling for a democratic revolution.\nOn 14 January 1990, the protesters, having grown from three hundred to a few thousand, met on the square in front of the Lenin Museum. A demonstration on Sükhbaatar Square on 21 January (in weather of −30°C) followed. Protesters carried banners alluding to Chinggis Khaan, rehabilitating a figure which the socialist school curriculums had outright banned. They also celebrated Daramyn Tömör-Ochir, a politician who was purged from the MPRP in 1962 as part of the MPRP's efforts to suppress the commemoration of the 800th anniversary of Genghis Khan's birth. The protestors carried a modified Flag of Mongolia, which distinctly lacked the star representing the country's socialist beliefs; this flag would eventually become the official flag after the revolution.\nIn subsequent months, activists continued to organise demonstrations, rallies, protests, and hunger strikes, as well as teachers' and workers' strikes. Activists had growing support from Mongolians, both in the capital and the countryside, and the MDU's activities led to other calls for democracy all over the country. The demonstrations expanded to thousands in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, and to other major cities, such as Erdenet and Darkhan, as well as to provincial centers like Mörön. Large-scale demonstrations were followed by the creation of the first opposition parties of Mongolia.\nAfter numerous demonstrations of thousands in both the capital city and provincial centers, on 4 March 1990, the MDU and three other reform organisations held a joint outdoor mass meeting, inviting the government to attend. The government sent no representative to what became a demonstration of over 100,000 people demanding democratic change. On 7 March 1990, in Sükhbaatar Square, the MDU initially started a hunger strike of ten, urging the current government to resign. The hunger strike escalated as thousands gathered to join the strike, declaring that the strike would not end until the resignation of the current government.\nand Chairman of the  People's Great Khural Jambyn Batmönkh]]\nThe situation was tense. Behind the scenes within the Politburo, there were serious discussions about cracking down on the protestors. Eventually, a decree was written, awaiting approval from the Chairman of the MPRP, Jambyn Batmönkh, that would effectively repress the protests. Batmönkh outwardly opposed the decree, maintaining that they must \"under no circumstances resort to using violence\" (). Those who were present there later recalled that Batmönkh said, \"I will never sign this. We few Mongols have not yet come to the point that we will make each other's noses bleed,\" smacked the table, and left the room.\" On 9 March or 15 March 1990, the Politburo was replaced, and on 21 March 1990, Batmönkh announced his resignation.\nElbegdorj announced the news of the Politburo resignation to the hunger strikers and to people who had gathered on Sükhbaatar Square at 10:00 pm. The hunger strike stopped. The MPRP Politburo's resignation paved the way for the first multi-party elections in Mongolia. The new government announced Mongolia's first free parliamentary elections, which were to be held in July.\nAftermath\n, who was murdered by unknown assassins in 1998]]\nFollowing the Politburo's resignation, Mongolia's first free, multi-party elections for a bicameral parliament were held on 29 June 1990. In the 1990 parliamentary elections, parties ran for 430 seats in the People's Great Khural. Opposition parties were not able to nominate enough candidates. The opposition Mongolian Democratic Party nominated 346 candidates for the 430 seats in the People's Great Khural (upper house). The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) won 357 seats in the People's Great Khural and 31 out of 53 seats in the newly established Little Khural as well. The MPRP enjoyed a strong position in the countryside.\nNonetheless, the new MPRP government under Dashiin Byambasüren shared power with the opposition parties, and implemented constitutional and economic reforms. As these reforms coincided with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which had until 1990 provided significant economic aid to Mongolia's state budget, the country did experience harsh economic problems: enterprises closed down, inflation rose, and basic food had to be rationed for a time. Foreign trade broke down, economic and technical aid from the former socialist countries ended, and domestic economy was struggling with privatisation. A thriving black market arose in Ulaanbaatar by 1988 to accommodate the needs of the populace.\nThe People's Great Khural (upper house) first met on 3 September 1990 and elected a president (MPRP), vice-president (MSDP), prime minister (MPRP), and 50 members to the Little Khural (lower house) according to proportional representation. The vice-president was also chairman of the Little Khural. In November 1991, the People's Great Khural began discussion on a new constitution, which entered into force on 12 February 1992. In addition to establishing Mongolia as an independent, sovereign republic and guaranteeing a number of rights and freedoms, the new constitution restructured the legislative branch of government, creating a unicameral legislature, the State Great Khural.\n, the first president of Mongolia, ratifying the 1992 Constitution on 13 January 1992]]\nThe constitution was amended in 1992. The first election major win for the Democratic opposition was the presidential election of 1993, when the nominee of the Mongolian Social Democratic Party (MSDP) and the Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP), incumbent Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, won by 59.89% of the total vote.\nThe Democratic Union Coalition, co-led by MNDP chairman Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, for the first time succeeded in winning parliamentary majority in the 1996 parliamentary elections. The Democratic Party has been part of three coalition governments with the former ruling MPRP in 2004–2008 and in 2008–2012 respectively; and with the Civil Will-Green Party and new MPRP from 2012 and on.\nIn the 2009 Mongolian presidential election, the Democratic Party candidate, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj — one of the democratic revolution leaders — defeated the MPRP candidate, incumbent president Nambaryn Enkhbayar. Following this victory, in the 2012 parliamentary elections, the Democratic Party won again. In the 2012 local elections of the capital city, provinces and districts, the Democratic Party won for the first time in the country's history. In the 2013 Mongolian presidential election, the Democratic Party candidate, incumbent President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, won. Thus, the Democratic Party that stemmed from the Democratic Union — that is, the pro-democracy activists — was in control of Mongolia's presidency, parliament and government between 2013 and 2016, when it was defeated at the parliamentary elections.\nSee also\n* Mongolian Revolution of 1911\n* Mongolian Revolution of 1921\n* Revolutions of 1989\nNotes\nReferences"
