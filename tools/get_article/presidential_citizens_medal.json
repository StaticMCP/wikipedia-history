It is the second-highest civilian award in the United States and is second only to the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Established by executive order on November 13, 1969, by President Richard Nixon, it recognizes an individual \"who has performed exemplary deeds or services for his or her country or fellow citizens.\" Only United States citizens are eligible for the medal, which may be awarded posthumously.\nThe medal is a disc of gilt and enamel, based on the seal of the president of the United States, with the eagle surrounded by a wreath of leaves. The medal is suspended on a ribbon, dark blue with a light blue central stripe and white edge stripes. Despite being a civilian award, it may be worn on some military uniforms.\nRecipients\npresents the Presidential Citizens Medal to D.C.
