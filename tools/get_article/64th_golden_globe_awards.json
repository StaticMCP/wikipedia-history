R. Knight, stating, \"No, I did not call him a faggot\", while executive producer Shonda Rhimes and other cast members looked on. Katherine Heigl publicly condemned Washington for his remarks, intensifying tensions on set and contributing to a strained atmosphere. This eventually led to Washington's exit from the show, as the on-set environment became untenable.\nSee also\n* 79th Academy Awards\n* 27th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 58th Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 59th Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 60th British Academy Film Awards\n* 61st Tony Awards\n* 2006 in film\n* 2006 in American television\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
