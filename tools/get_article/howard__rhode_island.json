The Rhode Island State Prison, designed by prison reformer John Haviland was first built in 1878, and is a stark and imposing gothic structure built of granite block.  Over the last several decades, numerous other institutional buildings for incarcerated criminals and the intellectually disabled were constructed.\nToday, Howard encompasses an area of almost one square mile. Its numerous prison buildings house over 2,000 male and female prisoners as well as several hundred mental health patients.\nSee also\n*List of prisons in Rhode Island\nReferences\n*[http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss231sg1.htm RI Historical Society Howard Prison records]\nExternal links\n* [http://www.doc.ri.gov/ Rhode Island Department of Corrections]\n* [https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.74.4.635?journalCode=ajp THE RECEIVING UNIT OF THE STATE HOSPITAL AT HOWARD, RHODE ISLAND]"
