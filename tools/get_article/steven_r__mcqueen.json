McQueen, is an American actor, best known for his role as Jeremy Gilbert in The CW fantasy supernatural drama The Vampire Diaries from 2009 to 2015 and in 2017, and its spin-off Legacies in 2018.  He also starred as Jimmy Borrelli in the NBC dramas Chicago Fire from 2015 to 2016 and Chicago P.D. in 2016, part of the One Chicago franchise.\nEarly life\nMcQueen was born in Los Angeles on July 13, 1988, to Stacey (), a humanitarian and former actress, and Chad McQueen, a race car driver and former actor. His paternal grandparents are actor Steve McQueen and Filipino actress Neile Adams.  His stepfather, Luc Robitaille, is a Hockey Hall of Fame-honored professional ice hockey executive and former player. McQueen is the oldest of four children with a half-brother, Chase, and a half-sister, Madison, from his father's remarriage and a half-brother, Jesse Robitaille, from his mother's remarriage. His stage name is \"Steven R. McQueen\", the \"R\" referring to his stepfather's surname Robitaille. McQueen described his relationship with his father and his stepfather in an interview with the New York Post, \"My stepdad has been more like a biological dad in my life. I'm pretty close with my biological dad, but I think of him more like an uncle. It's a good relationship.\"\nIn his mid-teens, McQueen moved around from city to city with his parents, including living in Detroit and being home-schooled until his graduation.  It was while living in Detroit that he started watching movies, including those of his grandfather, \"From there, my passion for it slowly unfolded. I went to a couple of classes and I grew to love it.\"  Eventually, he packed his bags, moved back to Los Angeles and started taking acting classes.\nCareer\n20052008: The beginning of an acting career\nMcQueen made his television debut in September 2005 at the age of 17, appearing as a guest star in an episode of the short-lived CBS science fiction drama Threshold.  He subsequently guest-starred on a number of other CBS television series including Numb3rs, Without a Trace and CSI: Miami.  One of the more notable roles since his debut was a recurring role as Kyle Hunter for seven episodes of the fourth and final season of The WB drama Everwood from 2005 to 2006.  His character is a teenage piano prodigy and moody loner struggling to navigate his sexuality, the coming out storyline attempting to shine a light on the struggles young people face and to show that they are not alone.  Whilst McQueen co-starred in a short film, Club Soda in 2006, it was in January 2008 that he made his feature film debut in the Disney Channel Original Movie Minutemen, where he played the villainous role of Derek Beaugard.  In an interview, McQueen was asked if portraying a mean character in the film was challenging and he replied, \"You know, it was actually really fun because I'm not really that mean in real life. It's all just pretend and really fun.\"\n2009–2015: The Vampire Diaries, modelling work and his inspiration\nIn 2009, McQueen was cast as Jeremy Gilbert in The CW's television adaptation of L. J. Smith's The Vampire Diaries novels and starred for the first six seasons until 2015.  Gilbert was written to have left Mystic Falls for art school when it was announced that the sixth season would be McQueen's last.  His performance in the drama earned him a nomination for the Choice TV Male Scene Stealer Award in the 2013 Teen Choice Awards.  McQueen made a special appearance in 2017 in the series finale to reprise his role by helping out at the Salvatore Boarding School for the Young and Gifted, and once more in 2018 as a special guest star in his role as Jeremy Gilbert in The Vampire Diaries' spin-off Legacies.  Besides being a vampire hunter on-screen, McQueen starred in a loose remake of the 1978 horror film Piranha, titled Piranha 3D in 2010, with an ensemble cast including Elisabeth Shue, Adam Scott, Jerry O'Connell, among others.  He played a socially awkward kid who fell in love with a girl two years his senior.\nAway from the small screen, McQueen joined fellow actors Christa B. Allen, Colton Haynes and Debby Ryan as a fashion model for the American lifestyle retailer Abercrombie & Fitch in their Spring 2014 \"The Making of a Star\" advertising campaign. In both the video and print, he explained his inspiration of following his grandfather's footsteps to become an actor, saying, \"As a kid growing up in Detroit I longed to be a Superhero. Later on I started watching movies my grandpa (Steve McQueen) did, and I saw what an impact they made on the world. That's when I said, 'Hey, I want to do that too'.\"\n2015–2020: Chicago Fire and other projects\nTen years since his acting debut, McQueen joined the cast of the NBC drama Chicago Fire, in the premiere of the fourth season as Jimmy Borrelli in 2015, a new candidate assigned to Firehouse 51. McQueen was credited as a recurring cast member for the first six episodes and was added to the main cast from the seventh episode. In addition, he also guest-starred in the crossover episodes of Chicago P.D. in 2016, as part of the One Chicago franchise created by Dick Wolf. At the beginning of Season 5, Borrelli took matters into his own hands during a fire call and suffered a career-ending injury. McQueen's run on the show ended in the second episode of the fifth season in October 2016.\nIn 2018, in addition to being a special guest star in The CW's fantasy drama Legacies, McQueen co-starred in a short film, The Take Off, that had its world premiere at the 2018 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.  He also starred in a television film for Hallmark Original Movies, Home by Spring, and ended the year off by starring as the U.S. Medal of Honor recipient, awarded posthumously, Joseph Vittori in an episode of Netflix's anthology documentary series Medal of Honor.\nIn 2020, McQueen starred alongside the lead actor Neal McDonough and co-star Casper Van Dien in a Western television film for INSP, The Warrant.  He explained how he got involved in the film, \"Neal's been a family friend for a long time so he called me and we had a conversation about it and he said it was gonna be a Western and we'd get to shoot some guns and have a good time...\"\nPersonal life and philanthropy\nMcQueen announced his engagement to model Alexandra Silva on Instagram on January 25, 2018, with a black and white photo and the quote \"She said yes\", but they called off their engagement in May 2018.\nSince 2014, McQueen has been a supporter of the Thirst Project, a nonprofit organization whose aim is to bring safe drinking water to communities around the world where it is not immediately available.  He lends his support by attending at their annual fundraising event, the Annual Thirst Gala, as well as travelling to the Kingdom of Eswatini to help to construct water installations. He also supports TECHO and Echoes of Hope, a nonprofit organization founded by his parents Stacia and Luc Robitaille, to help at-risk and emancipated foster youth succeed and reach their full potential.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Club Soda\n| The Kid\n| Short film\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Piranha 3D\n| Jake Forester\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|}\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Threshold\n| Jordan Peters\n| Episode: \"Blood of the Children\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | –2006\n| Everwood\n| Kyle Hunter\n| Recurring role; 7 episodes\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" scope=\"row\" |\n| Minutemen\n| Derek Beaugard\n| Television film for Disney Channel Original Movie\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| Numb3rs\n| Craig Ezra\n| Episode: \"Atomic No. 33\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| Without a Trace\n| Will Duncan\n| Episode: \"True/False\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| CSI: Miami\n| Keith Walsh\n| Episode: \"Gone Baby Gone\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | –2015, 2017\n| The Vampire Diaries\n| Jeremy Gilbert\n| Main role (season 1–6); special appearance (season 8) episode: \"I Was Feeling Epic\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | –2016\n| Chicago Fire\n| Rowspan=2|Jimmy Borrelli\n| Main role (seasons 4–5)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| Chicago P.D.\n| Guest role (season 3)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" scope=\"row\" |\n| Home by Spring\n| Wayne Hancock\n| Television film for Hallmark Original Movie\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| Legacies\n| Jeremy Gilbert\n| Episode: \"We're Being Punked, Pedro\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n| Medal of Honor\n| Joseph Vittori\n| Episode: \"Joseph Vittori\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| The Warrant\n| Cal Breaker\n| Television film for INSP\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|}\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominated work\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2006\n| Beverly Hills Film Festival\n| Best Male Performance\n| Club Soda\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| Teen Choice Awards\n| Choice TV: Male Scene Stealer\n| The Vampire Diaries\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
