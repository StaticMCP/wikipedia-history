Established in 1980, it is granted annually by the Ministry of Culture and Sport to recognize the meritorious work of contemporary plastic artists. It is given for works or actions published in the prior year which contribute to the enrichment of Spain's cultural heritage. Despite being developed by an administrative body, the selection of the award's winners is intended to be a true reflection of the values and feelings of society. It is endowed with a prize of 30,000 euros.\nCandidates for the award are presented by the members of a jury, or by entities related to the pertinent artistic or cultural activities, through reasoned proposals addressed to the Minister of Culture or to the jurors themselves.\nIn 2010 the artist Santiago Sierra rejected the award, claiming his independence from a state which shows \"contempt for the mandate to work for the common good\".\nWinners\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!
