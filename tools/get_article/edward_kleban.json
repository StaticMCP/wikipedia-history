Kleban was born in the Bronx, New York City, in 1939 and graduated from New York's High School of Music & Art and Columbia University, where he attended with future playwright Terrence McNally.\nKleban is best known as lyricist of the Broadway hit A Chorus Line. He and composer Marvin Hamlisch won the 1976 Tony Award for Best Original Score, and he shared the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1976 with Hamlisch and three other contributors to the musical. The one-woman Phyllis Newman show, The Madwoman of Central Park West (1979), featured a few tunes with his lyrics.\nFor several years, he worked at Columbia Records, where he produced albums by performers as diverse as Igor Stravinsky and Percy Faith, and the albums for the Off-Broadway musicals Now Is The Time For All Good Men and Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris.\nHe was a teacher for many years at the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop.\nDeath\nKleban died of complications from throat cancer, aged 48, on December 28, 1987 at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York.\nKleban Foundation\nIn his will, Kleban established the Kleban Foundation, which grants the annual Kleban Prize in Musical Theatre.

Their attempts failed and the rights reverted to Kleban's longtime companion, librettist Linda Kline. Kline sought someone who did not know or work with Kleban, but who would learn about him through the material. She admired previous work of Lonny Price and sought him as a collaborator.\nAfter six years of work, with Price and Kline as co-authors, Price directed and played the role of Ed in A Class Act, a musical biography of Kleban with a score consisting of songs he wrote for numerous unproduced musicals. After a two-month run at the Manhattan Theatre Club, it transferred to the Ambassador Theatre on March 10, 2001 and ran for three additional months.  Almost 14 years after his death, Kleban earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Original Score and Drama Desk nominations for Outstanding Music and Outstanding Lyrics.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322225709/http://www.edwardkleban.com/ EdwardKleban.com]\n*\n*\n* [http://www.nypl.org/archives/4460 Edward Kleban papers, 1960-1986], held by the Billy Rose Theatre Division, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts\n}}"
