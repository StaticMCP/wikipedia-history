The Oregon primary was a closed primary and awarded 58 delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of whom 47 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nVice president Al Gore won the primary with 84% of the vote and 47 delegates, while perennial candidate Lyndon LaRouche Jr. received 10%, missing the 15% threshold to be eligible for delegates, which the Democratic National Committee had announced he'd be barred from receiving anyways.\nProcedure\nVoting took place until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. local time. Candidates had to meet a threshold of 15% at the congressional district or statewide level to be considered viable. The 47 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the primary results. Of these, between 6 and 7 were allocated to each of the state's five congressional districts and another 6 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 10 at-large delegates.\nThe delegation also included 13 unpledged PLEO delegates: 4 members of the Democratic National Committee, 5 members of Congress (One senator, Ron Wyden, and four representatives, David Wu, Earl Blumenauer, Peter DeFazio, and Darlene Hooley), the governor John Kitzhaber, and 1 add-on.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Lyndon LaRouche Jr.\nThere was also an uncommitted option.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 Oregon Democratic presidential primary\n!
