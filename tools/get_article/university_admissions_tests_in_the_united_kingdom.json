Most applicants to universities in the UK take national examinations such as A-levels or Scottish Highers. Separate admissions tests are used by a small number of universities for specific subjects (particularly law, mathematics and medicine, and courses at Oxford and Cambridge), many of these administered by Cambridge University's Admissions Testing Service.\nEnglish Literature Admissions Test\nHistory Aptitude Test\nThe History Aptitude Test (HAT) is a standardized test used as part of the admissions process to Oxford University for undergraduates applying to read history, or a subject including history, for example English with history.\nThe one-hour test is currently only employed by Oxford University, though other universities are considering adopting a similar examination as part of admissions.\nModern and Medieval Languages Test\nThe Modern and Medieval Languages Test (MML) is a university admissions test used in the United Kingdom.

Launched in 2006 as the UK Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT), it was renamed in 2019 following the launch of the test in Australia and New Zealand as a replacement for the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT).\nIn the UK, the UCAT was one of two main admissions tests used for medical, dental and other health-related courses, the other being the BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT). Following the BMAT's cancellation from 2024 onwards, all ex-BMAT universities have moved to using the UCAT for their undergraduate medical courses, including Oxford and Cambridge.\nIn 2025, the UK version of the test had 41,354 test takers whilst the ANZ version had 16,950.\nReferences"
