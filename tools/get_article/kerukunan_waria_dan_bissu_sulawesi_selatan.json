In 2017, their regular Sports and Arts Week, which was planned to be held in Soppeng, was forcibly disbanded by the local police due to a lack of permission from the Ministry of Religious Affairs. This situation was also caused by the rejection of a local religious organization called Forum Umat Islam Soppeng, which reported it to the Soppeng Regency Regional People's Representative Council. The organization regarded this disbandment as a limitation of freedom of expression. Next year, the event was held once again in Dua Boccoe, but it was disbanded and became the last time it was held.\nWorks\nThe organization is helding research project called \"Project Budaya Bone\" as partnership with researcher from Bone since 2022.\nReferensi"
