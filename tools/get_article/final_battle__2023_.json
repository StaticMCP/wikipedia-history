First held in 2002, it is traditionally ROH's last show in the calendar year. It is widely regarded as Ring of Honor's premiere flagship event, similar to WWE's WrestleMania. On October 18, 2023, ROH announced that Final Battle would be held at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas on December 15 and would air exclusively on HonorClub.\nStorylines\nThe event featured professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portray villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines will be produced on ROH's weekly series ROH Honor Club TV exclusively on their streaming service Honor Club, on television programs of sister promotion All Elite Wrestling including Dynamite, Rampage, and Collision, and via promotional videos on both the ROH and AEW YouTube channels.\nOn the November 8 episode of Dynamite, Samoa Joe vacated the ROH World Television Championship in order to challenge for the AEW World Championship. On the following ROH Honor Club TV episode, president Tony Khan announced that qualifying matches would take place over the next several weeks for the Survival of the Fittest elimination match that will take place at Final Battle on December 15, with the winner of that match becoming the new Television champion. The first two men to qualify were Dalton Castle and Komander, who defeated Evil Uno and Gringo Loco respectively. Kyle Fletcher, Lee Moriarty and Lee Johnson later qualified by beating Gravity, Josh Woods and Tracy Williams respectively. On the December 14 episode of ROH Wrestling, Tony Khan announced that the sixth and final competitor in the Survival of the Fittest elimination match would be revealed at Final Battle.\nOn the December 2 episode of AEW Collision, interviewer Lexy Nair asked Keith Lee who he was referring to on the past week's Collision when Lee mentioning wanting to face \"him\". As Lee was about to speak, Shane Taylor walked up and said that their tag team match on last year's Final Battle, where Lee teamed up with Swerve Strickland to defeat Taylor and JD Griffey, didn't solve anything. Taylor then challenged Lee to a match for Final Battle, which Lee accepted.\nIn weeks leading to Final Battle, \"Smart\" Mark Sterling scouted Ethan Page as a potential client, but Page turned down the invitation. Page went on a winning streak of five matches in a row. His next match was against Tony Nese, which he lost due to Sterling's interference. On the rematch, Sterling was ejected from ringside and Page won the match. For the rubber match, Sterling demanded he be allowed at ringside, and management agreed under the condition that Sterling will be handcuffed to the ring post. The official contract signing took place on the December 7 episode of ROH Wrestling. where Sterling told Page that the match would be an \"I Quit\" match. Nese and Page then signed the contract and Sterling then threw powder into Page's eyes with Nese tossing Page through a table. The match was then made official for Final Battle.\nOn the December 7 episode of ROH Wrestling, Bryan Danielson recalled that at the 2003 Final Battle event, he faced the late Jay Briscoe in his only match against him. Danielson then said that at last year's Final Battle, Jay had his final match, in which he teamed with his brother Mark Briscoe, against FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood) in a Dog Collar match. Danielson then challenged Mark and FTR to face Blackpool Combat Club (Danielson, Claudio Castagnoli, and Jon Moxley) in a Jay Briscoe Memorial Fight Without Honor, which was made official.\nIn weeks leading up to Final Battle, Athena became the mentor of Billie Starkz and Lexy Nair, with Starkz and Nair becoming her 'minions'. On the November 23 episode of ROH Honor Club TV, Starkz and Athena lost to Ronda Rousey and Marina Shafir. On the following episode of ROH Wrestling, Starkz defeated Shafir in a one-on-one match, with Starkz proceeded to attack Shafir after the match. Athena and Nair come out and feigned announcing that Starkz had graduated from 'minion training'. Athena then announced that only Nair was the valedictorian. Starkz then got upset and attacked Athena. Starkz then met Tony Khan backstage and requested a championship match with Athena, which Khan accepted. The match was then made for Final Battle.\nEvent\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Commentators\n|Ian Riccaboni\n|-\n|Caprice Coleman\n|-\n|Ring announcer\n|Bobby Cruise\n|-\n|Backstage interviewer\n|Lexy Nair\n|}\nZero-Hour\nThere were four matches that took place on the Zero-Hour pre-show.

Picking the best match on this show would be difficult because it had so many different kinds of performances. It had everything from high-flying luchadors to 300-poundpowerhouses ramming into each other like animals. It had technical clinics, bloody violence and anything else you could ask for at a PPV. When the good outweighs the bad by as much as it did on Friday night, it's hard to have any complaints\".\nMike Malkasian of Wrestling Headlines gave the overall show a 9/10, stating \"that the pay-per-view was fantastic from top to bottom. It singlehandedly rekindled my interest in ROH. The only issue was that it dragged to long\"\nPhil Wheat of Nerdly gave the show a 3.5 out of 5, stating that \"No matter what you think about this iteration of Ring of Honor, you can't deny that Tony Khan can put together a decent PPV – as he does for every pay-per-view, no matter the brand – and this year's Final Battle was no exception. My only issue is that the show should have had a decent runtime\".\nCoby Galenzoski of Wrestling Republix gave the show a 4 out of 5, stating that \"ROH Final Battle 2023 provided a very entertaining show from top to bottom. The opener was successful in starting the show successfully before the rest of the card followed suit. Ultimately this is a show that if you cut the fluff it's by far a better show. This is not meant to take credit away as this would have been a solid final PPV of the year if Worlds End didn't exist\".\nWrestling journalist Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter rated the following matches: the Valkyrie-Allure match 1 star, the Von Erichs vs Outrunners bout 1.25 stars, the Keith vs Cartwheel match 3.25 stars, Garcia vs Christian 3.5 stars, the AAA Mega Championship match 4.5 stars, the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team titles match 3.75 stars, the \"I Quit\" match 4.25 stars, the Rose-VertVixen match 0.75 stars (the lowest rated match on the card), the Survival of the Fittest and the Fight Without Honor 4.75 stars (the highest rated matches on the card), the ROH Pure title match 3.5 stars, the Lee-Taylor bout 2.5 stars, the Proving Ground match 2.5 stars, and the ROH Women's title match 4.25 stars.\nResults\n|time2  = 6:52\n|note2  = pre\n|match3 = Bryan Keith defeated Jack Cartwheel by pinfall\n|stip3  = Survival of the Fittest Qualifier\n|time3  = 7:55\n|note3  = pre\n|match4 = Daniel Garcia defeated Blake Christian by submission\n|stip4  = Singles match\n|time4  = 12:15\n|note4  = pre\n|match5 = El Hijo del Vikingo (c) defeated Black Taurus by pinfall\n|stip5  = Singles match for the AAA Mega Championship\n|time5  = 16:30\n|match6 = The Mogul Embassy (Bishop Kaun, Toa Liona and Brian Cage) (c) (with Prince Nana) defeated TMDK (Kosei Fujita, Bad Dude Tito and Shane Haste) by pinfall\n|stip6  = Six-man tag team match for the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship\n|time6  = 12:05\n|match7 = Ethan Page defeated Tony Nese (with \"Smart\" Mark Sterling)\n|stip7  = \"I Quit\" match\n|time7  = 20:05\n|match8 = Nyla Rose defeated VertVixen by pinfall\n|stip8  = Singles match\n|time8  = 2:40\n|match9 = Kyle Fletcher defeated Komander, Bryan Keith, Lee Moriarty, Dalton Castle, and Lee Johnson\n|stip9  = Survival of the Fittest Finals for the vacant ROH World Television Championship\n|time9  = 25:55\n|match10 = Wheeler Yuta (c) defeated Tom Lawlor by pinfall\n|stip10  = Pure wrestling rules match for the ROH Pure Championship\n|time10  = 13:10\n|match11 = Keith Lee defeated Shane Taylor by pinfall\n|stip11  = Singles match\n|time11  = 14:40\n|match12 = Dem Top Guys (FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood) and Mark Briscoe) defeated Blackpool Combat Club (Bryan Danielson, Jon Moxley, and Claudio Castagnoli) by pinfall\n|stip12  = Jay Briscoe Memorial Fight Without Honor\n|time12  = 29:35\n|match13 = Eddie Kingston defeated Anthony Henry by submission\n|stip13  = Proving Ground match\n|time13  = 5:45\n|match14 = Athena (c) defeated Billie Starkz by submission\n|stip14  = Singles match for the ROH Women's World Championship\n|time14  = 28:30\n}}\nVacant ROH World Television Championship Survival of the Fittest elimination match\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Eliminated\n!Wrestler\n!Eliminated by\n!Method\n!Time\n|-\n|\n|Lee Johnson\n|rowspan=2|Lee Moriarty\n|Submitted to the Border City Stretch\n|8:46\n|-\n|\n|Dalton Castle\n|Pinned after The Fang\n|11:20\n|-\n|\n|Lee Moriarty\n|Bryan Keith\n|Pinned after the Emerald Tiger Driver\n|15:38\n|-\n|\n|Bryan Keith\n|rowspan=2|Kyle Fletcher\n|rowspan=2|Pinned after the Grimstone\n|16:52\n|-\n|\n|Komander\n|rowspan=2|25:54\n|-\n|\n|Kyle Fletcher\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|}\nNotes\nSee also\n* 2023 in professional wrestling\n* List of Ring of Honor pay-per-view events\nReferences"
