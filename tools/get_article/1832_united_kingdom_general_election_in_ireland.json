The Association, led by Daniel O'Connell, aimed to repeal the 1800 Acts of Union and restore Ireland to the status enjoyed after the reforms of 1782, while maintaining Catholic emancipation.\nThis was the first election following the Representation of the People (Ireland) Act 1832 and the Parliamentary Boundaries (Ireland) Act 1832, which saw an increase in the Irish representation from 100 to 105 MPs.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=2 |Party\n!
