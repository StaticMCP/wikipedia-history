It replaced the Electoral district of Burke. Flinders, along with parts of Burke, was incorporated into the new seat of Carpentaria in the 1931 redistribution, effective in 1932. It was abolished in a redistribution in 1991, effective 1992. Most of its territory became part of Charters Towers, while the western portion, including Cloncurry, became part of Mount Isa. The last sitting member for Flinders was Bob Katter, who had held it since December 1974.\nMembers for Flinders\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\"|First incarnation (1888–1932)\n|-\n|\n| Louis Goldring\n|\n| 1888–1893\n|-\n|  |\n| Charles McDonald\n| Labour\n| 1893–1901\n|-\n|  |\n| Peter Airey\n| Labour\n| 1901–1907\n|-\n|  |\n| John May\n| Labor\n| 1907–1917\n|-\n|  |\n| John Mullan\n| Labor\n| 1918–1932\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\"|Second incarnation (1950–1992)\n|-\n|  |\n| Ernest Riordan\n| Labor\n| 1950–1954\n|-\n|  |\n| Frank Forde\n| Labor\n| 1955–1957\n|-\n|  |\n| Bill Longeran\n| Country\n| 1957–1974\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Bob Katter\n| National\n| 1974–1992\n|-\n|}\nElection results\nSee also\n* Electoral districts of Queensland\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly by year\n* :Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly by name\nReferences"
