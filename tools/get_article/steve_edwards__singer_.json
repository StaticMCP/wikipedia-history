He has collaborated with several house music producers.\nBiography\nDuring the 1990s, Edwards lent his collaborative efforts to British deep house musician Charles Webster, the most notable being \"Future Love\", a track released by Presence, one of Webster's pseudonyms. He started appearing as a featured artist on tracks by the Problem Kids.\nHowever, Edwards' first mainstream breakthrough was Cassius' \"The Sound of Violence\".  The track, in which he shares credits with the French duo, went to number one on Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2002. This was followed up in 2003 by \"Falling Star\", a minor club hit produced by Starchaser. In 2005 Steve Edwards' collaboration with Swedish producer Axwell brought him fame once again on a Latin-flavoured house hit \"Watch The Sunrise\". The track reached #3 on the UK Dance Singles Chart, as well as BBC Radio 1 Dance Chart.\nIn 2006, he returned to radioplay, after writing and providing vocals for Bob Sinclar's \"World, Hold On\". In this summer he also participated in Festivalbar 2006, an important music festival around the Italian squares.\nIn September 2006, Edwards released the single \"Thru The Night\". This was the first time he was credited as main artist, instead of featured artist. \"Thru The Night\" was produced and written together with fellow Sheffield resident, producer/guitarist Martin Smith - a long-standing collaborator with Steve Edwards. Together they have remixed and produced music for Bob Sinclar and many others. Steve has also co-produced the tracks \"Fate\" (with Starchaser) and \"Walls of Science\" (for singer Beth Wild). In February 2015 Melbourne duo, L'Tric, released their debut single titled \"This Feeling\" where Steve Edwards sang lead vocals.\nEdwards is currently lead singer in the Sheffield-based band Lords of Flatbush along with Andy Nicholson (ex-Arctic Monkeys), Louis Carnall (Milburn), Phil Jones and Nic Burke.\nDiscography\nSingles\nAs lead artist\n*2006 \"Thru the Night\" (co-written and produced by Martin Smith)\n*2006 \"DYOT (Do Your Own Thing)\" (with DabHands, as DabHands & Steve Edwards)\nAs featured artist\n*1999 Problem Kids – \"I Will Lead\"\n*2001 Problem Kids – \"S'alright\"\n*2001 Million Dollar Orchestra – \"It Takes Heart\"\n*2002 Reset – \"An Afternoon with Steve Edwards\"\n*2002 M Factor – \"Mother\"\n*2002 Cassius – \"The Sound of Violence\"\n*2002 X-Press 2 – \"Call That Love\"\n*2002 Guiro − \"Put Your Hands Together\"\n*2003 Hollway & Eastwick − \"Downtime\"\n*2003 Starchaser − \"Falling Star\"\n*2003 Robbie Rivera − \"I Want More\"\n*2004 D.
