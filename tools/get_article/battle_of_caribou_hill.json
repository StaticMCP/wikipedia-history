When the Ottoman soldiers came to their positions, they were met with rifle fire from Donnelly's men. At the same time, the rest of the Newfoundland Regiment was sent to the nearby knoll where they encountered an Ottoman patrol. After a firefight, the Ottoman patrol was driven off. The hill was then captured by the Newfoundlanders.\nAftermath and Legacy\nThe Battle of Caribou Hill was the first battle honor earned by the Newfoundland Regiment during the Gallipoli campaign. After the battle, the ridge was named \"Caribou Hill\" in honor of the Newfoundland Regiment. For his actions during the battle, James Donnelly was awarded the Military Cross while Sargent W.M. Green and Private R.E. Hynes received the Distinguished Conduct Medal and Lance Corporal F. Snow received the Military Medal. In 2018, Turkey granted the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador permission to install a monument to commemorate the Newfoundland Regiment and their actions during the battle. The monument, known as the Gallipoli Newfoundland Memorial was unveiled in September 2022. It is located near the Hill 10 Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery.\nReferences"
