      "text": "# Succession rights in the United Kingdom (housing law)\n\nSuccession rights in the United Kingdom is an area of housing law concerning the ability to pass on their tenancy when they die something known as a succession.\nCouncil properties\nA council house can only have one succession unless a tenancy document grants more. If an inherited council house is too large for an individual's needs, then a tenant can also be evicted for under-occupation, although the council would have to provide suitable alternative accommodation. The right of succession was granted by the Housing Act 1985. The Localism Act 2011 amended the succession rights of tenancies created after this date and limits them to the spouse or partner of the deceased.\nHousing association properties\nWhether or not a housing association tenant has a right to succession depends upon the type of tenancy they hold, be it an assured tenancy, an assured shorthold tenancy or a secure tenancy.\nHousing and Planning Bill\nThe Housing and Planning Bill proposes that secure council tenancies will be replaced by tenancies lasting between two and five years. Under the proposals family members will not inherit a lifetime tenancy.\nSee also\n*Under-occupation penalty\n*Assignment (housing law)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/social_housing/transfers_and_exchanges/can_you_inherit_a_council_tenancy Shelter - Can you inherit a council tenancy?]"
