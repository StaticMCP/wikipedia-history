Like other ratites, it is a flightless bird.\nAppearance\nThe Stewart Island tokoeka is the largest type of southern brown kiwi.  It has red-brown feathers that resemble fur.  It has small wings and a long, curved bill. The nostrils are at the end of the bill, not at the top near the rest of its face.  Experts think the kiwi can smell very well.\nHabitat and family\nAbout 20,000 Stewart Island tokoeka live on Stewart Island.  Unlike other kiwis, they are diurnal rather than active only at night.\nUnlike other kiwis, the Stewart Island tokoeka is not solitary, instead living in family groups.  The chicks remain with their parents for up to seven years, during which they take turns incubating their parents' younger eggs.  Scientists believe this assistance by older siblings may be why kiwi parents sometimes have two clutches each year. This kiwi also goes onto the beach to look for food, which most other kiwis do not do.\nThreats\nInvasive mustelids, such as stoats, never established themselves on Stewart Island to the same extent as in the rest of New Zealand. However, there are feral cats on Stewart Island, and they can be very large.\nReferences"
