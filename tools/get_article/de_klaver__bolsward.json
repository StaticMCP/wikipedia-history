The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 9860.\nHistory\nDe Klaver was built in 1802. It drained an area of . Of this area,  belonged to the mill owner,  belonged to an orphanage and the remainder was divided amongst numerous other owners. The mill was in use until 1966. In that year a steel Archimedes' screw replaced the existing one. This was driven by a tractor. Restoration took place over the winter of 1980–81. The restored mill was opened on 10 June 1981. It was sold in that year to  Stichting De Fryske Mole (English:Frisian Mills Foundation) for ƒ1.\nDescription\nDe Klaver is what the Dutch describe as a \"spinnekopmolen\" (English: Spider mill). It is a small hollow post mill winded by a winch. The four Common sails, which have a span of , are carried in a wooden windshaft. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 33 pegs. This drives the wallower (17 pegs) at the top of the upright shaft, which passed through the main post. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the crown wheel (32 pegs) drives the Archimedes' screw via a gear wheel with 31 pegs. The Archimedes' screw has an axle diameter of 275 millimetres (10¾ in) and is  diameter overall. It is inclined at an angle of 27½°. Each revolution of the screw lifts  of water.\nPublic access\nDe Klaver is open to the public by appointment.\nReferences"
