It consists of two interlocking components: one located on the mantle (often fibrous) and the other on the funnel (often cartilaginous). The apparatus may permit some anterior–posterior displacement or prevent movement altogether.\nFunction\nVariability\nFunnel component\nSix major forms of the funnel locking apparatus are recognised among teuthids (lazy-T shape, inverted-T shape, straight shape, triangular shape, oval with tragus and/or antitragus, and oval shape) and several more are found in the sepioids (including the boomerang shape and keyhole shape).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=33% | Shape of funnel locking apparatus\n!width=33% | Species\n!width=33% | Family\n|-\n|\n| Idioteuthis cordiformis\n| Mastigoteuthidae\n|-\n|\n| Magnapinna talismani\n| Magnapinnidae\n|-\n|\n| Mastigoteuthis flammea\n| Mastigoteuthidae\n|-\n|\n| Mastigoteuthis glaukopis\n| Mastigoteuthidae\n|-\n|\n| Mastigoteuthis grimaldii\n| Mastigoteuthidae\n|-\n|\n| Mastigoteuthis magna\n| Mastigoteuthidae\n|}\nMantle component\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=33% | Shape of mantle locking apparatus\n!width=33% | Species\n!width=33% | Family\n|-\n|\n| Mastigoteuthis grimaldii''\n| Mastigoteuthidae\n|}\nReferences"
