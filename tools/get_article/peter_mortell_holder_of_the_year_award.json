At the time, Mortell was a punter in his senior year at Minnesota. During his career at Minnesota, Mortell handled all punting and holding duties over three seasons. Mortell's career includes 203 punts with an average of  per punt, currently ranking him first in team history. Off the field, Mortell (as well as other specialists at Minnesota and around the Big Ten) was known for his sense of humor, which manifested in the award's parodist nature. The comedic nature of the award garnered national attention and his joking acceptance video was included by ESPN in their yearly award show for more serious college football position awards.\nWinners\nEach year's finalists and winner is selected by the award's Foundation, which is run by Mortell. For the winner, a foundation is set up to help raise money for a charity of his choosing. As the inaugural winner, Mortell raised approximately $30,000 for the University of Minnesota Children's Hospital. Additionally, each winner records a comedic acceptance video which is shown during ESPN's award show.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:60px\"|Year\n!style=\"width:150px\"|Winner\n!style=\"width:60px\"|Class\n!style=\"width:50px\"|Position\n!style=\"width:100px\"|Team\n!style=\"width:130px\"|Charity\n!style=\"width:40px\"|References\n|-\n|2015\n|Peter Mortell\n|Senior\n|P/H\n|Minnesota\n|Univ. of Minnesota Children's Hospital\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Garrett Moores\n|Junior\n|QB/H\n|Michigan\n|VA of Ann Arbor\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Connor McGinnis\n|Sophomore\n|QB/H\n|Oklahoma\n|Fields & Futures Foundation (OKC)\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Mac Loudermilk\n|RS Senior\n|P/H\n|UCF\n|St. Jude Children's Research Hospital\n|[http://ucfknights.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=34100&ATCLID=211783166 Loudermilk Named Holder of the Year – UCF Athletics]\n|-\n|2019\n|Preston Brady\n|Junior\n|LS/H\n|Memphis\n|St. Jude Children's Research Hospital\n|[https://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR;jsessionid=00000000.app20013a?px=1999040&fr_id=120688&pg=personal&NONCE_TOKEN=F7D6BABDAF4098EC01A7C4EAF02438F3 Mortell to Memphis - Preston Brady Holder of the Year - Events for St. Jude]\n|-\n|2020\n|Spencer Jones\n|RS Senior\n|WR/H\n|Oklahoma\n|Boys & Girls Club of Norman\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|Reid Bauer\n|RS Junior\n|P/H\n|Arkansas\n|Boys & Girls Club of Northwest Arkansas\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Noah White\n|Senior\n|H\n|Louisiana Tech\n|Project 319\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
