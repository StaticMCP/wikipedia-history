However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nSecond Air Force and Air Technical Service Command\n* Casper Army Air Field, Casper, Wyoming\n: 331st Bombardment Group (Heavy), 15 September 1942-1 April 1944\n: 351st Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron (Second AF), 15 September 1942-1 April 1944\n: 211th Army Air Force Base Unit (Second AF), 1 April 1944-7 March 1945\n: 4188th Army Air Force Base Unit (ATSC), 7 March 1945-1 October 1946\n: Now: Natrona County International Airport\n* Cheyenne Municipal Airport, Cheyenne, Wyoming\n: Joint Use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Now: Cheyenne Regional Airport and  Cheyenne Air National Guard Base\n* NOTE: During World War II,  F. E. Warren Air Force Base was Fort Francis E. Warren, a United States Army facility.  It became a United States Air Force base in 1947, however the only conventional airfield ever located at present-day F. E. Warren AFB during the war was a single dirt strip used for light fixed-wing aircraft.  No aircraft were ever assigned to the facility during World War II.   When reconstructed as a USAF strategic missile base in the 1950s, F. E. Warren AFB did not include a runway for jet aircraft, relying instead on nearby Cheyenne Air National Guard Base.  F. E. Warren AFB does have a heliport and associated flight light for assigned USAF helicopters in support of missile site security and missile combat crew movements.\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
