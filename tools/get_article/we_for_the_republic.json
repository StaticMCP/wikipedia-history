However, the Grand and General Council instead elected Alessandro Rossi of DEMOS - Solidary Democracy and Milena Gasperoni of the Party of Socialists and Democrats, with the support of the opposition and the PSD, who opposed Fabbri's nomination. This defeat for the majority precipitated a government crisis and led to the calling of early elections. During these elections, We for the Republic appeared divided and effectively ceased to exist. The newly created Reformist Alliance allied with the PDCS, while the Party of Socialists and Democrats and the Socialist Party announced an electoral agreement with Libera San Marino.\nElectoral history\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n|+Grand and General Council\n|-\n!
