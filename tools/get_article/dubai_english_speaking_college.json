It takes its name from its sister school, Dubai English Speaking School, which is the oldest British school in Dubai. Originally located at the Oud Metha site of their sister school, DESC relocated to the Academic City in February 2007, where its facilities were officially opened by the Duchess of Cornwall and Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein.\nIn 2011, Andrew Gibbs was appointed the new headteacher of the school, with the college doubling in size during that time. In 2014 he was appointed the first principal of DESSC (DESS and DESC), with Chris Vizzard (previously the Deputy Headteacher) becoming the new headteacher at DESC.\nCampus\nThe main Dubai English Speaking College is split into nine separate buildings. The campus also contains 4 pitches, 2 swimming pools, and 4 netball courts. The newest addition to DESC is a sixth form centre.\nFour of the buildings are house buildings - each of the four houses (Desert, Earth, Sky and Coast) is taught in a separate building. The mathematics department is located in the Desert house block, Earth Block contains science labs, art, DT an Food and Nutrition, Sky Block has English inside, and coast has MFL.The other four buildings comprise one for the reception and the arts department, the auditorium, one for the canteen and the admissions office.\nThe sixth form is located on its own campus that offers a range from A-levels to B-tech. The Sixth form center has its own gym, dinner area, zen garden and study areas.\nOut of the 4 pitches, 1 is a football pitch, named the \"Astro\" pitch; the second pitch is designed for Rugby, and the other two are standard grass football pitches.\nCurriculum\nThe school offers secondary school courses for students starting from Year 7 (also known as Grade 6) - Key Stage 3, and leading up to the 2 year GCSE course starting in Year 10 (Key Stage 4). The students then proceed onto the AS and A2 (A Level) qualifications offered for Year 12 and 13 (Key Stage 5), and the school now offer the alternative qualification BTEC.\nDuring KS3, the students study a general set of subjects.\nAs KS4 starts, students get the option of choosing their subjects. Some of the GCSE choices are compulsory, including:\n* English Language and Literature\n* Mathematics\n* Science (a combination of Physics, Biology and Chemistry)\n* Modern Foreign Language (French or Spanish or Arabic)\n* 1 Humanities subject (Business Studies, Economics, Geography, History or Psychology)\n* 1 Technology subject (Computer Science, ICT, Design Technology, Media Studies, Music Technology)\n* 1 Subject of choice (Islamic Students have to take Islamic Studies instead of either this or the technology subject)\nFor the last option, the subjects offered include Art, Drama, Music and G.R.O.W/L.I.F.E (a developmental program, aimed at developing skills for future life).\nKey Stage 5: Students are allowed to either continue with the subjects they have taken during GCSE, and take them at the AS and A Level, or choose a new set of subjects, which isn't recommended. The expectations are to study four AS subjects in year 12, and then choose three of the subjects to study at A level in year 13 (It is possible to take more if one wishes).\nThe National Curriculum for England has undergone major changes. Previously, students took their AS level exams in year 12, and A Level exams in year 13, with both of the exam grades counting towards the final grade in year 13. However, this has changed - only the final exams in year 13 will count towards the A level grade. At DESC, the only two subjects where the AS level examinations will still count towards the grade (50% of the grade) are the Mathematics and Further Mathematics courses.\nExtracurricular activities\nGeneral activities\nA wide range of extracurricular activities is offered, with clubs including a robotics club, multiple ecology-related activities, and several clubs aimed at the development of leadership skills (such as an enterprise club).\nDuke of Edinburgh International Award\nThe International Award (sometimes known as the Duke of Edinburgh Award) is an international youth awards programme, founded in the UK.

Dubai English Speaking College allows students from Year 10 up to Year 13 to participate in all three awards (Bronze, Silver and Gold).\nSports\nDubai English Speaking College maintains Basketball, Football, Netball, Rounders, Rugby Sevens and Rugby Union teams.
