The Wartell administration developed and administered two successful five-year strategic plans.  His administration's most noteworthy accomplishments include expanding the number of degree and certificate options at the undergraduate and graduate levels; overseeing the addition of more than  to the campus property; making IPFW the first regional campus in Indiana to construct student housing; instituting the Centers of Excellence; securing a number of endowed or named professorships and top-level student scholarships; and arranging numerous public/private partnerships with organizations such as Parkview Health Systems, the Fort Wayne Center for Learning, the Northeast Indiana Innovation Center, and PBS39 WFWA-DT.\nUnder Wartell, the university pursued its most aggressive building construction efforts in its history. His leadership was responsible for the construction of Parking Garage 2, the Science Building, the PLEX indoor soccer building and the Hefner Soccer Fields (12 outdoor soccer fields), the Willis Family Bridge between the main campus and the residential campus, IPFW Student Housing on the Waterfield Campus (stages I–III), the Rhinehart Music Center, the Holiday Inn at IPFW and the Coliseum, the Ron Venderly Family Bridge spanning the St. Joseph River between the Main Campus and West Campus, the Medical Education Center, and the Student Services Complex.\nAlso during Wartell's tenure, IPFW's endowment and level of public and private funding significantly increased to previously unprecedented levels. The endowment rose from $3 million to $56 million.  In support of various projects, Wartell raised more than $100 million from external sources.  The Wartell administration also ushered its 16 men's and women's sports into NCAA Division I athletic competition, and membership in The Summit League conference.\nWartell was forced to leave IPFW in 2012 in accordance with Purdue University's mandatory retirement age policy. In a lawsuit settled in early 2015, Wartell said that this policy had not been enforced before and that he was the victim of gender discrimination and a breach of contract.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.uni.edu/presidential-search/sites/default/files/wartell.cv_.pdf Wartell biography]\nReferences"
