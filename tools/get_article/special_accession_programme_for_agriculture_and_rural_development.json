In 2007 the program was completely replaced by the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA).\nThe programme which came under the remit of the EU Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development was part of the Agenda 2000 programme for increased pre-accession assistance in 2000–2006. Until the fifth enlargement of the EU in 2004, its overall budget was 560 million euros (2003).\nLater, SAPARD funding was available only to Bulgaria, Romania, and Croatia. After Bulgaria and Romania's entry into the EU, Croatia benefited from a specially designed Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), which built on the programme support from Phare, ISPA and SAPARD, it received in 2005–2006.\nSee also\n*Directorate-General for Enlargement (European Commission)\nExternal links\n* [https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/enlargement-policy/glossary/sapard_en SAPARD website]"
