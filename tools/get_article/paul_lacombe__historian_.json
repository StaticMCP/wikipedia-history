Refusing an approach to history based on the mere narration of great dates and great men, he invented the concept of 'history of events' (''l'histoire evenementielle'') and insisted on the need for the historian to make strict selections of evidence and to establish a hierarchy among facts. He also laid the foundations of a history which brings social and economic factors to the forefront of investigation. He is, therefore, a precursor to the idea of Fernand Braudel and the Annales school that history needs to be studied in 'the long time' (longue durée). He also championed the idea of the history of Homo faber as \"man has at all times been to a great extent a workman.\"\nBibliography\n* Arms and Armour in Antiquity and the Middle Ages: also a descriptive notice of modern weapons; translated from the French of M.P.
