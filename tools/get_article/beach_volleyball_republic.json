(BVR) is an organization aimed at the development of beach volleyball in the Philippines. It was formed in June 2015.\nHistory\nCo-founded by former volleybelle, Ateneo Lady Eagles, and current professional players Charo Soriano, Gretchen Ho, Fille Cainglet-Cayetano, Dzi Gervacio and Bea Tan. BVR organized beach volleyball tournaments in different beaches and public places in the Philippines. They also organized grassroots development programs for the young and aspiring players, in addition to the professional circuit tours thru the Beach Royals program. The first legs were held at the SM Sands By the Bay court on June 20 and July 11, 2015.\nIn December 2015, BVR made its 4-hour live telecast debut in ABS-CBN Sports and Action with 16 women's teams competing. In 2016, BVR forged a partnership agreement with ABS-CBN Sports for a 4 part magazine show and the live airing of the semifinals and finals of the program's events like the Boracay leg of the BVR on Tour on April 27–28. In June 2016, the BVR officially attempted to get  support from the Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas (LVPI), the country's volleyball NSA, through its LVPI-sanctioned BVR Invitationals, where international teams competed in a three-day event successfully held at Anguib Beach, Santa Ana, Cagayan.\nIn November 2020, the BVR was reportedly considered turning into a professional league. This is due government regulations at that time where they only allowed professional leagues to hold games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in February 2021, the league organizers forego going pro.\nKing and Queen of the Sands\nThe BVR's first tournament was the Queen of Sands tournament on June 20, 2015. The format used for the women's beach volleyball tournament allowed for players to compete with and against different players each game instead of having the same partner throughout the tournament. The top four individual players with the most points figuring in the final. Fiola Mae Caballos of Central Philippine University is the winner of the inaugural tournament. A second tournament, the King and Queen of the Sands was held in July 2015. The tournament featured both men and women.\nChristmas Open\nThe 2015 Beach Volleyball Republic Christmas Open was held in the SM Sands By the Bay on December 19–20, 2015. The tournament involved 10 teams, which were split into two pools which competed in a single round-robin elimination format. A draw was held before the tournament proper to determine the placings of the teams and the schedule. The top two teams advanced to a cross-over semifinals round, and the winners of the semifinals matches moved on to the finals. The winner of the open received 100,000 thousand pesos cash prize. Live telecast of the semifinals and finals matches was aired via ABS-CBN Sports+Action.\n;Participating teams\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; line-height:16px; width:auto;\"\n|-\n!
