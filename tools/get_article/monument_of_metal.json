Inside the courtyard can be seen tiny silhouettes of people, which helps give the actual monument its scale. The concept was taken from an original painting done by drummer, Robb Reiner, the only real difference being that the album cover features a very warm cloud laced sky where the original featured a clear blue sky. The original artwork can be seen hanging in Reiner's basement on the 2008 rock documentary Anvil! The Story of Anvil.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Lips – vocals & guitar (all tracks)\n* Robb Reiner – drums (all tracks)\n* Ivan Hurd – guitar (tracks 8, 13, 15, 16)\n* Glenn Gyorffy – bass (tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19)\n* Dave \"Squirrely\" Allison – guitar (tracks 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 18)\n* Ian \"Dix\" Dickson – bass (tracks 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18)\n* Sebastian Marino – guitar (track 10)\nReferences"
