The Washington Times called it the \"'Dirtiest ever' race for RNC chairman.\"\nPre-campaign\nOn November 11, 2008, Jeff Burton launched a political draft website to encourage Steele to run for Republican National Committee Chairman. The website allowed visitors to sign a draft petition and received over 6,000 signatures.\nIn the months leading up to the election, discussions within the Republican Party highlighted the need for a leader who could revitalize the party after significant losses in the 2008 elections. Michael Steele, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and a prominent figure in the party, began to gain attention as a potential candidate. Steele's reputation as a moderate Republican with strong communication skills made him a compelling choice for those seeking to broaden the party's appeal.\nSimultaneously, other candidates began positioning themselves for the chairmanship, including South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Katon Dawson and Michigan GOP Chairman Saul Anuzis.\nCampaign\nKaton Dawson announced his official bid on November 24, 2008. Dawson was one of two candidates to earn votes on each of the six votes taken; he lost the final ballot to winner Michael Steele, 91–77.\nOn November 24, 2008, Steele launched his own campaign website, and confirmed his intention to run on Hannity and Colmes. Steele, seen as an early frontrunner, rejected the idea that the color of his skin had anything to do with his chances at becoming RNC chair, saying, \"I am a Republican who happens to be African-American.\"\nChip Saltsman was the first candidate to release a specific plan regarding the future of the party, which can be viewed at Our Plan for Republican Victory. In his bid for the RNC Chairmanship, Saltsman had been endorsed by: former Republican presidential candidate Governor Mike Huckabee, former United States Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, Tennessee Lt. Governor Ron Ramsey, and Tennessee House Majority Leader Jason Mumpower.\nUSA Today reported that, \"half of the candidates to lead the Republican National Committee (RNC) are Southerners: current Chairman Mike Duncan of Kentucky, South Carolina Chairman Katon Dawson and former Tennessee chairman Chip Saltsman. Former Ohio secretary of State Ken Blackwell and former Maryland lieutenant governor Michael Steele are black. Saul Anuzis, the Michigan GOP chairman, is a Harley-Davidson rider, an ex-union member and the son of an autoworker.\n\"Barack the Magic Negro\" controversy\nFor Christmas 2008, Chip Saltsman sent members of the Republican National Committee a music CD of 41 songs that included one entitled \"Barack the Magic Negro\" set to the tune of \"Puff, the Magic Dragon\".  The origin of the song was the title a Los Angeles Times column, written by David Ehrenstein in March 2007 that criticized the reception that Obama, a long shot candidate at the time, was getting in white America; Ehrenstein described the image of Obama in white America as that of a Magical Negro, a stereotypical gentle black man who helps white people, often used in movies created by white people. Rush Limbaugh commented on the column the day it published, and interpreted it as criticizing Obama himself, called the column an example of \"the racism of the left,\" and sang the words, \"Barack the Magic Negro\", to the tune of \"Puff the Magic Dragon.\"  Shortly after that Paul Shanklin recorded a song about Barack the Magic Negro set to that same tune, which Limbaugh played numerous times throughout the 2008 presidential election season. This is the song that Saltsman included on his CD.  Saltsman's campaign imploded as a result of the controversy caused by the CD, and he withdrew from the race.\nVoting\nThe election was decided in late January after six rounds of voting, with Steele elected chairman by a majority vote of the 168 committee members.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidate\n! scope=\"col\" | Round 1\n! scope=\"col\" | Round 2\n! scope=\"col\" | Round 3\n! scope=\"col\" | Round 4\n! scope=\"col\" | Round 5\n! scope=\"col\" | Round 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| 46\n| style=\"background:cornflowerblue;\"|48\n| style=\"background:cornflowerblue;\"|51\n| 60\n| style=\"background:cornflowerblue;\"| 79\n| style=\"background:limegreen;\"| 91\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| 28\n| 29\n| 34\n| style=\"background:cornflowerblue;\"| 62\n| 69\n| 77\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| 22\n| 24\n| 24\n| 31\n| 20\n|style=\"background:lightgrey; text-align:center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| 20\n| 19\n| 15\n| 15\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:lightgrey; text-align:center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| style=\"background:cornflowerblue;\"| 52\n| style=\"background:cornflowerblue;\"| 48\n| 44\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:lightgrey; text-align:center\"|\n|}\n: Candidate won that round of voting\n: Candidate withdrew\n: Candidate won RNC Chairmanship\nAfter the third round of balloting Duncan dropped out of contention without endorsing a candidate. Ken Blackwell, the only other African-American candidate, dropped out after the fourth ballot and endorsed Steele, though Blackwell had been the most socially conservative of the candidates and Steele had been accused of not being \"sufficiently conservative.\"  Steele picked up Blackwell's votes. After the fifth round, Steele held a ten-vote lead over Katon Dawson, with 79 votes, and Saul Anuzis dropped out.\nThe sixth round\nThe final push that led to Steele's win was from the eight voters from the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Virgin Islands, who switched to Steele after Anuzis dropped out. Steele won the chairmanship of the RNC in the sixth round, with 91 votes to Dawson's 77.\nSee also\n* 2009 Democratic National Committee chairmanship election\nReferences"
