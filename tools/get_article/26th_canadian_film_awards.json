The ceremony was hosted by radio personality Peter Gzowski.\nThe CFAs were expanded into a week-long event in Niagara-on-the-Lake which included all-day screenings, a National Film Board of Canada retrospective, and daily 'Meet the Filmmakers' programs.\nDue to the Quebec boycott crisis which protested the treatment of films from Quebec at the 25th Canadian Film Awards in 1973, and the resulting cancellation of the awards in 1974, the 1975 awards covered films released in both 1974 and 1975. Accordingly, the Canadian Film Awards committee revived the Film of the Year category, which had not been used since 1970, so that it could name separate Best Picture winners for both 1974 and 1975. In all other categories, however, separate winners were not named for the two years. There were 300 films in competition but French-Canadian filmmakers did not participate.\nWinners\nFilms\n*Film of the Year (1974): The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz — International Cinemedia Centre, John Kemeny, Ted Kotcheff director\n*Film of the Year (1975): Les ordres (Orders) — Productions Prisma, Bernard Lalonde, Claude Godbout and Guy Dufaux producers\n*Feature Film: Les ordres (Orders) — Productions Prisma, Bernard Lalonde, Claude Godbout and Guy Dufaux producers, Michel Brault director\n*Theatrical Documentary: Janis — Crawley Films, F.
