The film is based on the Norwegian fairy tale The White Bear, King Valemon.\nPlot\nThe land of the far north is ruled by a wise king who has three daughters, one of whom shall one day rule over his kingdom of Winterland. The two older daughters lack depth and understanding, but the youngest is good hearted and kind. She is also uncommonly brave. Unfortunately for the king, she has always desired to live in a land with flowers.\nFar to the south, young prince Valemon becomes king, but a powerful and evil witch queen wants to rule the world together with him. The new king does not want great power and has no intention of marrying the witch, so the witch curses the young king by turning him into a polar bear by day, and marks that he has seven years to find someone to fall in love with him. If anyone sees his human face before the seven years are over, he will have to marry the witch.\nThe bear travels north and enters Winterland. There he meets the young princess, who has her father's gift of being able to speak to animals. She asks the bear why he is so angry, and learns that he is not a bear, but is really the king of Summerland, cursed to look as he does. When she sees the flowers of Summerland reflected in his eyes, she is filled with compassion for the young king and agrees to go to Summerland with him as his wife.\nAfter their arrival, the witch sets about trying to harm the young couple, but is thwarted by the king's mother, who has some mastery of magic as well. Every time the couple has a child, the witch arrives to harm them, but the child disappears into safety before the witch can strike. However, while the children are safe, the princess does not know what has happened to them. She soon falls into despair. Hearing of this, her father sends her a special gift, and asks her to visit him. Her father's love restores her, however, her older sisters convince her to light a candle while her husband sleeps to see what his human face looks like. As soon as she does so, the witch appears and takes Valemon to be hers.\nOvercome with guilt, the princess sets out to free him. Along the way, she meets with the queen mother and her three children, all of whom give the princess gifts: scissors that create things out of thin air, boots that climb walls, and a special rug that, if clapped, can make food appear out of thin air.\nThe princess arrives in the witch's kingdom where Valemon is held in a castle. Disguised as a boy, she creates a wedding dress for the witch, while Valemon pretends to be afflicted by an evil potion the witch gave him that he had secretly spilled. The princess sneaks into the witch's lab. A host of other evil guests arrive at the wedding party, where the princess switches their wine for the potion while Valemon is unaffected. With the demise of the witch, her slaves are freed, and the pair reunites with their children and meets with the king of the Winterland.\nCast\n* Jack Fjeldstad as the King of the Winterland\n* Maria Bonnevie as Princess\n* Tobias Hoesl as King Valemon\n** Steve Kratz as Valemon's voice (Swedish)\n** David Forman as King Valemon's Polar Bear form (puppeteer)\n* Monica Nordquist as King Valemon's Mother\n* Anna-Lotta Larsson as Witch\n* Helge Jordal as the Devil\n* Marika Enstad as the Oldest Princess\n* Kristin Mack as the Middle Princess\n* Espen Skjønberg as the narrator\nProduction and release\nThe story was adapted from the Norwegian folktales East of the Sun and West of the Moon and the fairy tale The White Bear, King Valemon, both from the collection of tales gathered by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Engebretsen Moe.
