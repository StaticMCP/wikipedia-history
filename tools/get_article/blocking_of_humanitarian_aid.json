      "text": "# Blocking of humanitarian aid\n\nBlocking of humanitarian aid can result in several ways. It can be imposed on a region by foreign governments or non-state actors, but it can also result from the lack of consent for assistance by the host nation. Blocking of humanitarian aid to intentionally cause destruction of part or all of a population can amount to the crime against humanity of extermination. If, however, the humanitarian aid (e.g., medical supplies, food, clothing) is systematically diverted for military use by enemy combatants during war, then allowing the passage of humanitarian aid is not required, as explained in Article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. There are different interpretations of how the requirement of proportionality should determine the extent to which a siege to block such aid can legally be carried out.\nReferences"
