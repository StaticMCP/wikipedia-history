Maharaj, who saw it as a way of earning money for cash starved football associations in Fiji. This was the first time that a football competition in Fiji was sponsored by businesses. The competition has been held every year except 1987, when restrictions placed by the military government on organised competitions on Sunday led to all soccer competitions in Fiji being abandoned.\nTeams\nThe 8 teams from 2019 Fiji Premier League play the Battle of The Giants.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
