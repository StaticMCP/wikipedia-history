In Greek mythology, the god Poseidon was credited with the creation of horses.]]\nElements of Greek mythology appear many times in culture, including pop culture. The Greek myths spread beyond the Hellenistic world when adopted into the culture of ancient Rome, and Western cultural movements have frequently incorporated them ever since, particularly since the Renaissance. Mythological elements feature in Renaissance art and in English poems, as well as in film and in other literature, and in songs and commercials.  Along with the Bible and the classics-saturated works of Shakespeare, the myths of Greece and Rome have been the major \"touchstone\" in Western culture for the past 500 years.\nElements appropriated or incorporated include the gods of varying stature, humans, demigods, Titans, giants, monsters, nymphs, and famed locations. Their use can range from a brief allusion to the use of an actual Greek character as a character in a work. Many types of creatures—such as centaurs and nymphs—are used as a generic type rather than individuated characters out of myth.\nUse by governments and public institutions\non one face and Zeus on the other,  210 AC]]\nRoman conquerors of the Hellenic East allowed the incorporation of existing Greek mythological figures such as Zeus into their coinage in places like Phrygia, in order to \"augment the fame\" of the locality, while \"creating a stronger civil identity\" without \"advertising\" the imposition of Roman culture.\nIn the twenty-first century CE, the initial Greek 2-Euro coin featured the myth of Zeus and Europa and sought to connect the new Europe to the ancient culture of Greece.  the European Central Bank had plans to incorporate Greek mythological figures into the designs used on its bank notes.\nIn 1795 the American colonial revolutionary Thomas Greenleaf titled his New York newspaper The Argus\nafter the mythological watchman; Greenleaf adopted the slogan \"We Guard the Rights of Man\".\nThe figure of Pegasus appears frequently on stamps, particularly on those used for air mail.

The poet John Milton used figures from classical mythology to \"further Christianity: to teach a Christian moral or illustrate a Christian virtue.\" Euphrosyne, Hymen and Hebe appear in his ''L'Allegro''.

Riordan created the character when trying to help his son, who has ADHD and dyslexia, get interested in reading. In the stories, Percy's learning disabilities are a result of his heritage, thus Riordan used Greek mythology \"as it has always been used: to explain something that is difficult to understand.\" Riordan continues exploring Classical mythology in his subsequent series The Heroes of Olympus and The Trials of Apollo, the latter told from the perspective of the titular god. Following the conclusion of The Trials of Apollo, Riordan began working on standalone books in the series with the first being The Sun and the Star taking place from the perspectives Nico di Angelo and Will Solace who were recurring characters in the Percy Jackson series as well as the ongoing trilogy currently consisting Percy Jackson and the Chalice of the Gods and Percy Jackson and the Wrath of the Triple Goddess which takes place between The Heroes of Olympus and The Trials of Apollo.\nIn comics and graphic novels\n* In the opera within Girl Genius, the Heterodyne daughter who falls in love with the Storm King is Euphrosynia.\n* The Amazon queen Hippolyta was used as the mother of Wonder Woman in DC Comics.\n* In 2016 the French philosopher Luc Ferry launched the comic book series La Sagesse des mythes (The Wisdom of the Myths), which retells the Greek myths in a popular form but informed by modern scholarship.\n* Fabrizio Dori's comic books Il dio vagabondo (2018) and Il figlio di Pan (2023) are about a satyr who searches for the Greek gods in the modern world.\n* Some manga and anime have been influenced by Greek mythology to create their own one.

Cherubini's Médée takes the story which had been portrayed in many version on the French stage as a melodrama, and instead portrays Medea as a tragic heroine who deserves the audiences' sympathy.\n*Bob Dylan's 2020 song \"Mother of Muses\" is studded with references to Greek mythology.\n* \"The End\" by The Doors : Oedipus\n* Epic: The Musical by Jorge Rivera-Herrans is a fully sung-through musical adaptation (in the form of a series of concept albums) telling the story of Homer's Odyssey.\nRejection of use\nDuring the Middle Ages, writers disdained the use of \"pagan\" influences such as Greek mythology which were seen to be a \"slight to Christianity.\" From a current cultural perspective, the Greek Orthodox metropolitan Agustinos Kantiotis has denounced the use of Greek mythology such as the use of Hermes on a postage stamp and the incorporation of images from Greek mythology into universities' logos and buildings.\nerected in 2024 in the sea of the Mexican tourist town of Progreso, Yucatán offended the local Mayan people who called for its removal as their faith has their own god of the water Chaac and so the Poseidon statue was according to them, culturally insensitive]]\nWithin the cultures of Latin America, beginning in the nineteenth century, the inspiration for culture has been dominated by elements from the Native American cultural myths, rather than those of the Greco-Roman inspiration. In 2024, a 10 foot tall statue of Greek god of the sea Poseidon was erected in the sea near the beach in the tourist town of Progreso, Yucatán in Mexico. The statue depicted Poseidon rising from the sea, standing on a rock, with his trident in his right hand and a crown on his head as Greek mythology considers him \"king of the sea\". The presence of the statue there was opposed by the \"Indigenous Strategic Litigation\" group and its leader the lawyer Carlos Morales filed a legal complaint claiming that the Poseidon statue disrespects local Mayan beliefs which has their own god of the water called \"Chaac\". With regards the Poseidon statue, Morales stated the complaint that \"Poseidon is a figure entirely foreign to our Maya culture\" and besides that, the statue also appears to violate Mexican environmental law as the statue was erected directly into the sea.\nGreek women poets of the modern era; such as Maria Polydouri, Pavlina Pamboudi, Myrtiotissa, Melissanthi and Rita Boumi-Pappa; rarely use mythological references, which Christopher Robinson attributes to the \"problem of gender roles, both inside and outside the myths.\"\nMartin Winter says that the idea that many commentaries about the widespread use of Greek myths throughout Western culture does not take into account the vast difference between what a modern viewer takes from the story and what it would have meant to an ancient Greek.\nSee also\n* Greek mythology retelling\n* Achilles#in modern literature and arts\n* Ares in popular culture\n*Apollo#Modern reception\n* Centaurs in popular culture\n* Classical mythology in culture\n* Circe in popular culture\n* Cultural depictions of Medusa and Gorgons\n* Hades in popular culture\n* Harpy#Harpies in popular culture\n* Hephaestus in popular culture\n* Hercules in popular culture\n* Iphigenia#A modern viewpoint\n* Iris (mythology)#Fictional adaptations\n* Jason in popular culture\n* Maenad#References in modern culture\n* Morpheus (mythology)#Appearances\n* Muses in popular culture\n* Pan in popular culture\n* Paris (mythology)#Later treatments\n* Pegasus in popular culture\n* Persephone in popular culture\n* Philoctetes#Modern depictions\n* Proteus in popular culture\n* Titans in popular culture\nReferences\nCitations"
