The ceremony took place on May 1, 2016,  at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites in Los Angeles, California.\nThe drama pre-nominees were announced on January 27, 2016, and the standard nominations were announced on March 24, 2016, during an episode of The Talk for a second year in a row. The 43rd Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony, for extended Daytime Emmy categories, was held on April 29, 2016, with the venue also being the Westin Bonaventure Hotel. On March 24, 2016, the NATAS announced that despite the success of the previous year's ceremony on Pop, that the 2016 ceremony will forgo a traditional television broadcast for the second time citing \"the current climate for awards shows\". The 2014 ceremony also forwent a traditional television broadcast due to a lack of a suitable broadcast partner in time for the ceremony. On April 6, 2016, it was announced that the Lifetime Achievement Award would be presented to Sonia Manzano.\nSubmission change\nIn addition to multiple changes for Creative Arts categories, the Academy announced a submission change for the 43rd Daytime Emmy Awards. For the Blue Ribbon Judging round, performers from the six Drama performer categories can now submit up to 20 minutes of appearances from any two episodes from the 2015 calendar year, rather than from one single episode as had been done for several previous years. Thirty-minute programs have the option of using material from up to four episodes, specifically from two sets of two consecutive episodes.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger.\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner ]]\n, Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Game Show Host winner]]\n, Outstanding Informative Talk Show Host winner]]\n, Lifetime Achievement Award honoree]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"37%\" | Category\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"50%\" | Winners and nominees\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Outstanding Drama Series\n|\n* 'General Hospital '\n** The Bold and the Beautiful\n** Days of Our Lives\n** The Young and the Restless\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"width=50%\"|Outstanding Game Show\n|\n* 'The Price Is Right '\n** Jeopardy!\n** ''Let's Make A Deal\n** Monopoly Millionaires' Club\n** Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Outstanding Morning Program\n|\n*CBS Sunday Morning\n** CBS This Morning\n** Good Morning America\n** The Today Show\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Outstanding Morning Program in Spanish\n|\n* Café CNN\n** Un Nuevo Día\n** ¡Despierta América!\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Outstanding Talk Show/Informative\n|\n* The Chew\n** The Dr. Oz Show\n** Larry King Now\n** The Doctors\n** The Kitchen\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Outstanding Talk Show/Entertainment\n|\n* 'The Talk '\n** The Ellen DeGeneres Show\n** The Real\n** The View\n** The Wendy Williams Show\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Outstanding Entertainment News Program\n|\n* 'Extra '\n** Access Hollywood\n** Entertainment Tonight\n** The Insider\n** TMZ\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Entertainment Program in Spanish\n|\n* SuperLatina with Gaby Natale\n** Clix\n** Destinos\n** Fuerza En Movimiento\n** Vive la salud con la Dra.
