Post's grave is at lower right.]]\nThis list of battles fought in Colorado is an incomplete list of military and other armed confrontations that have occurred within the boundaries of the modern U.S. State of Colorado since European contact. The region was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain from 1535 to 1682, New France from 1682 to 1762, Kingdom of Spain from 1762 to 1800, French First Republic 1800 to 1803, and part of the United States of America 1803&ndash;present (boundaries were disputed by Spain).  The southern portion of Colorado was considered by Spain as part of its northern territories.  Large portions of Colorado were subsequently under the administrative control of Mexico from 1800 to 1835, and the Republic of Texas from 1836 to 1846.  Full administrative control of Colorado was established on February 2, 1848 with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which ended the Mexican–American War.\nThe Plains Indian Wars directly affected the region during westward expansion. By the end of the Nineteenth Century, Colorado became a focal point of labor violence and the Coal Wars, with instances of large-scale armed conflict between workers, private detectives, and state soldiers and police stretching into the 1920s.\nBattles\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name!!Date!!Location!!War!!Campaign!!Dead!!Belligerents\n|-\n|Sand Creek Massacre\n|November 29, 1864\n|near modern Eads\n|Colorado War\n|\n|187\n|United States of America vs Cheyenne & Arapaho\n|-\n|Battle of Julesburg\n|January 7, 1865\n|near modern Julesburg\n|Colorado War\n|\n|14\n|United States of America & civilian volunteers vs Cheyenne, Arapaho, & Lakota Sioux\n|-\n|American Ranch massacre\n|January 14, 1865\n|near modern Sterling\n|Colorado War\n|\n|10\n|United States of America vs Cheyenne & Sioux\n|-\n|Battle of Beecher Island\n|September 17–19, 1868\n|modern Yuma County\n|Comanche Campaign\n|\n|41\n|United States of America vs Arapaho, Cheyenne & Lakota Sioux\n|-\n|Battle of Summit Springs\n|July 11, 1869\n|near modern Sterling\n|Comanche Campaign\n|\n|~35\n|United States of America vs Arapaho, Cheyenne & Sioux\n|-\n|Meeker Massacre\n|September 29, 1879\n|White River Indian Agency, near modern Meeker\n|\n|\n|11\n|White River Ute vs United States civilians\n|-\n|Battle of Milk Creek\n|September 29 - October 25, 1879\n|near modern Meeker\n|Ute Wars\n|White River War\n|32-50\n|White River Ute vs United States of America\n|-\n|Battle of Berwind Canyon\n|October 24, 1913\n|Berwind\n|Coal Wars\n|Colorado Coalfield War\n|1\n|Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency, & Colorado National Guard vs United Mine Workers of America\n|-\n|Ludlow Massacre\n|April 20, 1914\n|Ludlow\n|Coal Wars\n|Colorado Coalfield War\n|23-29\n|Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, Colorado National Guard, & Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency vs United Mine Workers of America\n|-\n|Battle of Walsenburg\n|April 28–29, 1914\n|Walsenburg\n|Coal Wars\n|Colorado Coalfield War\n|3+\n|United Mine Workers of America-aligned strikers vs Colorado National Guard\n|-\n|Battle of Forbes\n|April 30, 1914\n|Forbes\n|Coal Wars\n|Colorado Coalfield War\n|12+\n|United Mine Workers of America and other armed strikers vs Rocky Mountain Fuel Company mine guards and streakbreakers\n|-\n|Columbine Mine massacre\n|November 21, 1927\n|Serene\n|Coal Wars\n|\n|6\n|Rocky Mountain Fuel Company, Colorado Mounted Rangers & Colorado National Guard vs United Mine Workers of America-aligned strikers\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*Plains Indians Wars\n*Bibliography of Colorado\n*Geography of Colorado\n*History of Colorado\n*Index of Colorado-related articles\n*List of Colorado-related lists\n*Outline of Colorado\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"
