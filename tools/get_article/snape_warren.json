It is part of the Sandlings Special Protection Area under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds, and in the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\nThis site on sandy soils is an example of the lowland heath of eastern England, which has greatly declined since the 1940s. The heath, which is dominated by ling, is interspersed with areas of acid grassland, where the most common grasses are common bent and sheep's fescue.\nFootpaths from Snape go through the site.\nReferences"
