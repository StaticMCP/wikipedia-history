The ship was the largest such steamboat when she was completed in 1976 by the Delta Queen Steamboat Company at Jeffboat in Indiana and was a seven-deck recreation of a classic Mississippi riverboat. Mississippi Queen was commissioned by a charter airline, Overseas National Airways (ONA), which owned the Delta Queen at the time. Construction, which started in 1973, was overseen by the brother of the ONA CEO. However, by the time of the first voyage in 1976, the Delta Queen Steamboat Company had been sold to the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York.\nShe was later owned by the Majestic America Line. The Mississippi Queen had 206 state rooms for a capacity of 412 guests and a crew of 157. It was 116 meters (382&nbsp;ft) long, 21 meters (68&nbsp;ft) wide, and displaced 3,709 metric tonnes (3,364 tons).\nThe Mississippi Queen was a genuine stern paddlewheeler with a wheel that measured 6.7 meters (22&nbsp;ft) in diameter by 11 meters (36&nbsp;ft) wide and weighed 77 metric tonnes (70 tons). The steamboat also featured a 44 whistle steam calliope, which was the largest on the Mississippi River system.\nThe Mississippi Queen was laid up in New Orleans at Perry Street Wharf after being gutted, initially for renovation. Instead, however, the steamboat was sold for scrap in May 2009. She was towed for the last time to Morgan City, Louisiana, in March 2011 to be cut down.\nIn popular culture\nA steamboat called the Mississippi Queen was used in the 1982 episode \"Cap'n Spanky's Showboat\" in the animated television series The Little Rascals.\nThe song 'Evangeline' written by Robbie Robertson & performed by The Band and Emmylou Harris references the boat - \"Evangeline, Evangeline, curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen\"\nSee also\n*Delta Queen\n*American Queen\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.steamboats.com/museum/mississippiqueen.html Mississippi Queen Tribute Site]"
