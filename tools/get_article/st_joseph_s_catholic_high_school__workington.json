It has also acquired a specialism in Business and Enterprise, and more recently, embarked on a Leading Edge programme in Drama...\nPreviously a voluntary aided school administered by Cumbria County Council, in September 2021 St Joseph's Catholic High School converted to academy status. It is now sponsored by the Mater Christi Multi Academy Trust, and continues to be under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lancaster.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
