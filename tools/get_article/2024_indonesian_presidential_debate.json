Five debates between presidential and vice-presidential pairings was place throughout the campaign season in compliance with the Indonesian electoral law of 2017. While all three pairs of candidates will participate together in each debate, the KPU has planned three debates for presidential candidates and two for vice presidential candidates for the 2024 elections. In contrast, during the 2019 election campaign, there were two special debates for presidential candidates, one for the vice president, and two for presidential-vice-presidential couples. This format modification was seen advantageous for some pairings, and it became a topic of discussion among the public and the success teams of candidate pairs.\nCompared to the debates held throughout the 2019 election campaign, the format of each debate's segments has not altered much. The discussion will be broken up into six sections, with a total duration of around 120 minutes. Following the presentation of the candidate couples' mission and vision in the first segment, there will follow two question and answer sessions aimed at refining the vision and mission through prepared panelist questions. The presidential candidates exchange questions and answers in the following two segments, and the sixth section concludes with a closing statement.\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; width:100%;\"\n!No.\n!Day and Date\n!Location\n!Theme\n!Panelist(s)\n!Moderator(s)\n!Broadcaster (Official)\n! colspan=\"6\" |Debate Participant(s)\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" rowspan=\"2\" |  Participant(s)      Nonparticipant(s)\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#193282;\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#c8ebff;\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#DB2016;\" |\n|-\n!Anies Baswedan\n!Muhaimin Iskandar\n!Prabowo Subianto\n!Gibran Rakabuming\n!Ganjar Pranowo\n!Mahfud MD\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |1\n|Tueasday, December 12, 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |Ardianto WijayaValerina Daniel\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |2\n|Friday, December 22, 2023\n|}}\n|\n|\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |Alfito DeannovaLiviana Cherlisa\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |3\n|Sunday, January 7, 2024\n|}}\n|\n|\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |Anisha DasukiAriyo Ardi\n|||}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |4\n|Sunday, January 21, 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |Retno PinastiZilvia Iskandar\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |5\n|Sunday, February 4, 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |Andromeda MercuryDwi Anggia\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nBroadcasting (via television)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; width:100%;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |No.\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Day and date\n! colspan=\"2\" |Broadcaster (Television)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Ref\n|-\n!Official\n!Live\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |1\n|Tuesday, December 12, 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |2\n|Friday, Desember 22, 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |3\n|Sunday, January 7, 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |4\n|Sunday, January 21, 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |5\n|Sunday, February 4, 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nFirst debate\n|duration      = 150 minutes\n|venue         = KPU RI Official, Jakarta\n|location      =\n|participants  =\n|footage       = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNO0YS846kU KPU RI][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P09lD1aZfM4 TVRI][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmigYdOyxIU RRI]\n|moderator     = Ardianto WijayaValerina Daniel\n|transcript    = [https://twitter.com/afaizn/status/1734613144788672868/history Transkrip.id][https://meemo.prosa.ai/reports/debatcapres-20231212 Meemo]\n|fact_checking =[https://www.cnnindonesia.com/laporanmendalam/nasional/20231212/cekfakta-debat-1-pemilu-2024/index.php CNN Indonesia][https://tirto.id/menelusuri-pernyataan-pernyataan-capres-di-debat-perdana-gTji Tirto.id]\n|website       =\n}}\nOn December 12, 2023, the first debate between presidential candidates was held at the KPU RI Office in Jakarta.

Ganjar also launched an attack on Prabowo when he asked about the free meal program for stunting in children, Ganjar replied that he did not agree. He explained that the prevention of stunting for stunted children was considered too late and should not allow excessive feeding of children to cause obesity. Prabowo responded again to Ganjar's statement that what he was asking was exactly what Ganjar had said. However, Ganjar again replied that Prabowo corrected his own question. Because the fifth debate was the last debate, the closing statements of the candidates were usually only 2 minutes, in this fifth debate each presidential candidate was given 4 minutes for closing statements.\nNotes\nReferences"
