The awards are named in memory of the British actor Ian Charleson, and are run by the Sunday Times newspaper and the National Theatre. The awards were established in 1990 after Charleson's death, and have been awarded annually since then. Sunday Times theatre critic John Peter (1938–2020) initiated the creation of the awards, particularly in memory of Charleson's extraordinary Hamlet, which he had performed shortly before his death. Recipients receive a cash prize, as do runners-up and third-place winners.\nThe awards' current definition of a classical play is one written before 1918. The awards for the previous year's performances are presented in the spring of the following year. The winners for 2024 were announced 31 May 2025, and first prize went to Francesca Amewudah-Rivers.\nBackground and description\nThe Sunday Times chief drama critic John Peter saw and reviewed Ian Charleson's extraordinary Hamlet at the National Theatre in late 1989. Unbeknownst to the audience, Charleson performed it during the last weeks of his life while he was seriously ill with AIDS, and died in January 1990 at the age of 40 eight weeks after his final performance. In November 1990, in memory of Charleson's fine performance, Peter established the annual Ian Charleson Award, to recognize and reward the best classical stage performance by an actor under age 30. The awards are jointly sponsored by The Sunday Times and the National Theatre, where they are held.\nUpon founding the awards, Peter noted:\nThe first annual Ian Charleson Award was presented in January 1991. The awards initially defined a classic play as one written prior to 1900; by the awards for 1992 this parameter had been extended to plays written by 1904, the year of Chekhov's death; this cut-off was extended to 1918 at the awards for 2008. The awards are presented at a friendly, low-key private luncheon at one of the restaurants at the National Theatre. There is no filming and no outside press, and there are no acceptance speeches; the awards are attended however by Britain's theatre royalty, who take great interest in preserving the foundations of their profession. Guests of honour have included Alec Guinness, Paul Scofield, Ian McKellen, and Prince Charles.\nRecipients receive a cash prize, as do runners-up and third-place winners. All shortlist nominees who are not cash-prize recipients receive a \"commendation\". Winners and commendees receive a plaque signed by the judges, who usually number four (a theatre critic, an actor, a casting director, and an artistic director) and until the awards for 2016 always included John Peter.\nThe awards for the previous year's performances are presented the following year, generally in the spring. The prize money is as follows: 1st prize £5,000; 2nd prize £1,500 (sometimes £2,000 or £2,500); and 3rd prize £500.\n1990s\n1990\nFirst prize\n*Ian Hughes, for Torquato Tasso in Torquato Tasso (Actors
