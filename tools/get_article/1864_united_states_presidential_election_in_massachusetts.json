Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMassachusetts voted for the National Union candidate, incumbent Republican president Abraham Lincoln and his running mate Andrew Johnson. They defeated the Democratic candidate, George B. McClellan and his running mate George H. Pendleton. Lincoln won the state by a margin of 44.44%.\nAlthough Lincoln ran under the National Union banner, this is the best Republican performance in Massachusetts as of the 2024 election. With 72.22% of the popular vote, Lincoln's performance in Massachusetts made it his third best performance in the 1864 election after Kansas and neighboring Vermont.\nThis is the last election in which the city of Roxbury voted in a presidential election, as it was annexed by the city of Boston in 1868.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1864 United States presidential election in Massachusetts\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | National Union\n| Abraham Lincoln (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 126,742\n| align=\"right\" | 72.22%\n| align=\"right\" | 12\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| George B.
