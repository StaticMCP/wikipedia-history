Redzone Pictures and adult video producer Phil Black organised the awards in an attempt to promote the adult film industry in the UK.\nThe inaugural awards show was held on 17 November 2006 at the Hammersmith Palais, London and was hosted by adult film performer and director Ben Dover. There were around thirty award categories, honouring performance, production, and technical achievements in film, television, and the Internet. Notable award nominees included the TV series The Secret Diary of a Call Girl, starring Billie Piper, which was nominated for \"Best Soft Core Production\" at the 29 November 2007 Awards.\nThe 2008 awards were the last to be held, with one commentator, in 2013, attributing the award's demise to insufficient financial backing or bad planning and promotion.\n2006 winners\nPerformers:\n* BGAFD Best Actress Award 2006 -
