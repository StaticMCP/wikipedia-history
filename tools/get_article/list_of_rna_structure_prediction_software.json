ERD\n| Evolutionary RNA Design ([https://archive.today/20141014170648/http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/01/08/bioinformatics.btu001.abstract ERD]) can be used to design RNA sequences that fold into a given target structure. Any RNA secondary structure contains different structural components, each having a different length. Therefore, in the first step, the RNA subsequences (pools) corresponding to different components with different lengths are reconstructed. Using these pools, ERD reconstructs an initial RNA sequence which is compatible with the given target structure. Then ERD uses an evolutionary algorithm to improve the quality of the subsequences corresponding to the components. The major contributions of ERD are using the natural RNA sequences, a different method to evaluate the sequences in each population, and a different hierarchical decomposition of the target structure into smaller substructures. || [http://mostafa.ut.ac.ir/corna/erd-cons/ Web Server] [http://mostafa.ut.ac.ir/corna/erd-cons/Download.php Source Code]  ||\n|-\n! antaRNA\n| Uses an underlying ant colony foraging heuristic terrain modeling to solve the inverse folding problem. The designed RNA sequences show high compliance to input structural and sequence constraints. Most prominently, also the GC value of the designed sequence can be regulated with high precision. GC value distribution sampling of solution sets is possible and sequence domain specific definition of multiple GC values within one entity. Due to the flexible evaluation of the intermediate sequences using underlying programs such as RNAfold, pKiss, or also HotKnots and IPKnot, RNA secondary nested structures and also pseudoknot structures of H- and K-type are feasible to solve with this approach.||[http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/AntaRNA/ Web Server] [http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/antaRNA/ Source Code]||\n|-\n! || Dual state design ||  ||\n|-\n! switch.pl\n| The ViennaRNA Package provides a Perl script to design RNA sequences that can adopt two states.
