Incumbent president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih was seeking re-election, after defeating the-then Speaker of the People's Majlis Mohamed Nasheed in the Maldivian Democratic Party primaries. People's National Congress candidate and Malé mayor Mohamed Muizzu won the election with 54% of the votes, defeating Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and becoming President-elect of the Maldives. It was the fourth consecutive election in which a Maldivian president failed to win reelection, the last to do so having been Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ran unopposed, in 2003.\nBackground\nFormer president Abdulla Yameen of the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM) had announced his candidacy for president, but due to his sentencing in 2018 to 11 years in prison for corruption and money laundering due to his connection to the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation scandal he is ineligible to appear on the ballot. PPM's vice president Mohamed Muizzu purportedly ran on his behalf as a nominee of the PNC, which he also joined before the election. Abdulla Yameen opted to support Muizzu's candidacy after previously calling for a boycott of the election.\nFormer Minister of Defence and National Security, Mohamed Nazim of the Maldives National Party announced his candidacy for president. The Jumhooree Party announced that they will put forth candidates as well. Ilyas Labeeb of the newly formed The Democrats nominated himself as a candidate for president. Independents Ahmed Faris Maumoon, son of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Umar Naseer and Hassan Zameel also announced their candidacies for president. This presidential election had the most recorded candidates since the first direct contested election in 2008, where six candidates participated.\nAs no candidate received over 50% of the vote in the first round, the top two finishers, Muizzu and incumbent Solih, moved on to a runoff.\nElectoral system\nThe Maldives has a presidential system of government where the president is both the head of state and government. The president is elected via direct-vote every five years and can only be elected for a maximum of two terms, which is the limit allowed by the constitution. The law and constitution of the Maldives grants its citizens the right to vote and run for public office at the age of 18.\nIn the elections, the candidate who receives a majority (more than 50%) of the valid votes cast is elected president. If no candidate receives an outright majority, the election then proceeds to a runoff (or second round), which are mandated to be held no less than 21 days following the initial election day between the two front runners. The candidate who receives the majority of the vote is then elected president. The official results are announced by the Elections Commission and published in the government gazette within seven days of the voting day of the presidential elections.\nCandidates\nMaldivian Democratic Party\nThe Maldivian Democratic Party held primary elections to choose its presidential candidate on 28 January 2023. Nasheed accused Solih of trying to rig the presidential primary. The Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party, Fayyaz Ismail, defended the primaries, reiterating that they will be held in accordance with the party constitution.\n* Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, incumbent president and leader of Maldivian Democratic Party.\n* Mohamed Nasheed, the-then Speaker of the People's Majlis, former Maldivian president, former president of Maldivian Democratic Party and leader of Democrats.\n}}\nProgressive Congress Coalition\nNominated by the Progressive Party of Maldives and People's National Congress.\n* Abdulla Yameen, former president and leader of Progressive Party of Maldives.\nHowever, since the Maldivian Criminal Court sentenced former president Yameen to 11 years in prison, Yameen was disqualified from running the presidential election.\nNominated by People's National Congress's as a 'Backup' candidacy.\n* Mohamed Muizzu, the-then Mayor of Malé and former Minister of Housing and Infrastructure.\nPNC's president Abdul Raheem said that he would withdraw the candidacy if the Maldivian Supreme Court allowed Yameen to compete in the upcoming elections, which ended up not happening.\nThe Democrats\nNominated by The Democrats, a newly formed political party from the rapidly unfolding power struggle between two pivotal figures in the Maldivian Democratic Party — incumbent president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and former president Mohamed Nasheed.\n* Ilyas Labeeb, Hulhudhoo 19th Parliament Member (MP) of the People's Majlis.\nJumhooree Party\nFinalized by Jumhooree Party's council meeting.\n* Qasim Ibrahim, former Speaker of the People's Majlis and leader of Jumhooree Party.\nMaldives National Party\nNominated by Maldives National Party.\n* Mohamed Nazim, former Minister of Defence and National Security and leader of Maldives National Party.\nAhmed Faris Maumoon (independent candidate)\nNominated by himself as an independent candidate.\n* Ahmed Faris Maumoon, MP for Dhiggaru constituency and the son of former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.\nUmar Naseer (independent candidate)\nNominated himself as an independent candidate.\n* Umar Naseer, former Minister of Home Affairs.\nHassan Zameel (independent candidate)\nNominated himself as an independent candidate.\n* Hassan Zameel, former Deputy Minister of Defense.\nCampaign\nA key campaign topic was the Maldives' position with respect to China and India. The incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih campaigned on an \"India-first\" policy, aiming to strengthen ties with the Maldives' geographical and cultural neighbour. On the opposite side, Mohamed Muizzu, adopting the slogan \"India out\", called for Indian military personnel stationed on the archipelago to leave, while campaigning for closer relations with China. This kept in line with the policies of former president Abdulla Yameen, founder of the People's National Congress, under whom the Maldives joined China's Belt and Road Initiative.\nMuizzu also campaigned on freeing Yameen, at the time serving an 11-year prison sentence for bribery and money laundering, pushing for the former president to be transferred to house arrest. Jailed on the same island where he arrested several of his political opponents, Yameen had requested to be moved home for health reasons two weeks prior to the election's second round.\nSecond round\nMuizzu won 46% of the votes in the first round, compared to 39% for Solih. Media sources attributed this result to rivalry between President Solih and former President Mohamed Nasheed, whose chosen candidate Ilyas Labeeb won 7%. As neither Muizzu nor Solih received an absolute majority of the votes cast, a second round was scheduled for 30 September.\nUmar Naseer and Ahmed Faris Maumoon did not endorse either candidate for the runoff. Mohamed Nazim endorsed Muizzu. While Qasim Ibrahim asked his supporters to vote as they pleased, his running mate Ameen Ibrahim and his party secretariat endorsed Solih.\nResults\nReactions\n* – Incumbent president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih conceded defeat, congratulating his opponent for his victory, as well as the Maldivian people for participating in a peaceful and democratic process.\n* – US.
