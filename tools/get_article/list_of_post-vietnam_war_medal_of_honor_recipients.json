The recipients must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States.\nSince the April 1975 end of American presence in Vietnam, the United States military has been involved in a number of conflicts and peacekeeping activities, including actions in the invasion of Grenada, Lebanese Civil War, invasion of Panama, the Yugoslav Wars, the Somali Civil War and elsewhere. Following the September 11 attacks, the United States entered into a War on Terror against militant Islamists, the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War.\nThe Medal of Honor has been awarded to 30 U.S. servicemen for actions since Vietnam, seventeen to living recipients.\nThe first post-Vietnam Medal of Honor recipients were two Delta Force snipers, MSG Gary Gordon and SFC Randy Shughart, who volunteered to defend a downed helicopter pilot in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia; the medals were awarded posthumously.\nRecipients\nSomali Civil War\nThe Battle of Mogadishu or for Somalis Ma-alinti Rangers (\"The Day of the Rangers\") was a battle that was part of Operation Gothic Serpent that was fought on October 3 and 4, 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia, by forces of the United States supported by UNOSOM II against Somali militia fighters loyal to warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The battle is also referred to as the First Battle of Mogadishu to distinguish it from the Second Battle of Mogadishu in 2006. The Medals were awarded to two Delta Force operators, both snipers, who volunteered to attempt to save the pilot of one of the downed UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, despite facing hundreds, possibly thousands of rebels around the crash site.\nindicates that the Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\"\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n!

It was the beginning of the War on Terrorism. The stated purpose of the invasion was to capture Osama bin Laden, destroy al-Qaeda, and remove the Taliban regime which had provided support and safe harbor to al-Qaeda.\nSince 2001, 20 U.S. servicemen have received the Medal of Honor for actions in Afghanistan, five of them posthumously.\nindicates that the Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\"\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n!
