The fleet set sail in August 1398, and successfully reached Dellys, which was sacked, killing around 1,000 villagers.\nAfter attacking the North African Coast, the expedition then headed towards Avignon to try to relive Pope Benedict XIII from a siege led by Geoffrey Boucicaut who was opposed to the Avignon Pope. However, the fleet could not cross the Rhône due to low water levels and directly provide aid, though they did manage to grant a three-month truce for the besieged.\nAftermath\nKing Martin managed to negotiate the release of the captured Aragonese in exchange for releasing 300 Tlmeceni prisoners captured during the raid on Tedelis. The following year, Martin ordered a repeat of the campaign, this time, directed at Bona.\nReferences"
