Government Road, also known as \"Douglas Highway\" or the \"Old Military Road\", had served as a main route in the community. It is two miles from Interstate 35.\nHistory\nThe community of Wareham originally had access to the Great Northern Railway line; with the former rail right-of-way still being used by electrical transmission lines.\nThe Kettle River and a stage-coach road built by the military were also in the vicinity.  After old Highway 61 was improved by the 1940s, running through nearby Friesland, Wareham then became a ghost town.\nIn the present day, a camp is located where the community had once existed; with access to the river.\nReferences"
