It was originally planned for April 4 together with three other primaries, but was moved twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Louisiana primary was a closed primary, with the state awarding 60 delegates, of which 54 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nPresumptive nominee and former vice president Joe Biden won nearly 80% of the vote and all delegates, while senator Bernie Sanders only took little more than 7% and 12 other mainly withdrawn candidates that had formally remained on the ballot made up the rest.\nProcedure\nLouisiana was initially planned to be one of four states holding primaries on Saturday, April 4, 2020, the other three being Alaska, Hawaii and Wyoming. On June 20, 2019, governor John Bel Edwards had signed a bill consolidating the presidential primary with municipal and ward elections on the same date, shifting the primary date from the first Saturday in March to the first Saturday in April.\nOn March 13, 2020, secretary of state Kyle Ardoin chose to postpone the state's primaries until June 20 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  On April 14, the primary was further delayed another three weeks to July 11. These delays would have resulted in Louisiana losing half of its delegates, as the primary date was \"past a June 9 deadline set by the Democratic National Committee\", but there was no penalty as the 2020 Democratic National Convention was rescheduled to August.\nVoting was expected to take place throughout the state from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 54 pledged delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 3 and 8 were allocated to each of the state's 6 congressional districts, and another 7 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 12 at-large delegates. Originally planned with 50 delegates, the final number included a 10% bonus of 4 additional delegates on the 32 district and 11 at-large delegates by the Democratic National Committee.\nFollowing the primary, district-level delegates were elected through post-primary congressional district caucuses featuring mail-in balloting. The Democratic state central committee then had to vote on the 12 at-large and 7 pledged PLEO delegates to send to the Democratic National Convention and also conducted this by mail until 8 June. The delegation also included 6 unpledged PLEO delegates: 4 members of the Democratic National Committee, a sole representative from Congress in Cedric Richmond, and the governor John Bel Edwards.\nCandidates\nThe following individuals appeared on the ballot:\nRunning\n*Joe Biden\n*Steve Burke\n*Robby Wells\nWithdrawn\n*Michael Bennet\n*Michael Bloomberg\n*Pete Buttigieg\n*John Delaney\n*Tulsi Gabbard\n*Amy Klobuchar\n*Deval Patrick\n*Bernie Sanders\n*Tom Steyer\n*Elizabeth Warren\n*Andrew Yang\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2020 Louisiana Democratic presidential primary\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Candidate\n!
