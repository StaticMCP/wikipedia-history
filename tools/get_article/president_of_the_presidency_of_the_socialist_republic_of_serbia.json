On 21 February 1974 a new federal Constitution was adopted which reaffirmed the collective federal presidency chaired by the president of the presidency. The constituent republics adopted the same system in new constitutions of their own.\nList of presidents\n|League of Communists of Yugoslavia|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Socialist Party of Serbia|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
