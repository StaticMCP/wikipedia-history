For the majority of the dynasty's history, the Imperial Guards were divided into three groups: the Guard Corps, the Vanguard, and the Imperial Bodyguard.\nThe original Imperial Guards units were mostly destroyed by foreign troops during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. During the late Qing military reform in the following decade, the Qing government established a new imperial guard formation as a regular military unit, the size of a division, and its training was overseen by Yuan Shikai's Beiyang Army.\nThe Qing imperial guards also practiced Shuai Jiao, a form of jacket wrestling.\nGuard Corps\nThe Guard Corps (Manchu: bayara; ) was assigned to protect the imperial palace. Soldiers from the Manchu and Mongol banners would be admitted to serve in the unit. The Guard corps was about ten times the size of the Vanguard and Imperial Bodyguards, and was the largest formation of the Imperial Guards.\nVanguard\nThe Vanguard (Manchu: gabsihiyan; ) corps was assigned to march ahead of the emperor when he left the palace. Soldiers from the Manchu and Mongol banners could join. The Vanguard consisted of about 1500 men.\nImperial Bodyguard\nThe Imperial Bodyguard (Manchu: hiya; ) corps was assigned to protect the emperor at all times. Only Manchu bannermen could join, and most members came from the upper three banners. Like the Vanguard, the Imperial Bodyguard consisted of about 1500 men.\nSee also\n*Peking Field Force\n*Firearm Battalion\n*Manchukuo Imperial Guards\n*Imperial Guards (Tang dynasty)\n*Shuai jiao\n*Wu Chien-ch'uan\n*Wu Quanyou\n*Yang Luchan\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*"
