In the , Eubenangee had a population of 247 people.\nGeography\nThe larger northern part of the locality () is in Cairns Region with the smaller southern part () in the Cassowary Coast Region. The western part of the locality is very low-lying undeveloped wetland (approx 10 metres above sea level) and forms part of the Eubenangee Swamp National Park. In contrast the north-eastern part of the locality is mountainous undeveloped land rising to Mount Arthur (470 metres above sea level), part of being in the Ella Bay National Park. The developed land is mostly on the fringes of the Eubenangee Swamp National Park; it is mostly used for crop farming with sugarcane predominating.\nEubenangee is a watershed with the northern part of the locality draining towards the Russell River (which enters the Coral Sea between Deeral and East Russell) and the southern part of the locality draining towards the North Johnstone River (which having merged with the South Johnstone River into the Johnstone River enters the Coral Sea between Flying Fish Point and Coquette Point).\nThe Bruce Highway and North Coast railway passes through the south-east of the locality with the Waugh railway station serving the area. A cane tramway passes through the locality to take harvested sugarcane to the local sugar mills.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from the railway station name assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on 15 August 1918. In turn the railway station took its name from the extensive Eubenangee Swamp.\nEubenangee Provisional School opened in September 1921. In 1927 it became Eubenangee State School. It closed in 1971.\nDemographics\nIn the , the population of Eubenangee was 242 people.\nIn the , Eubenangee had a population of 247 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Eubenangee.
