The expedition started 13 March 2013, and marked the first time a Canadian astronaut – Colonel Chris Hadfield – was in command of the station. Expedition 35 was also only the second time an ISS crew is led by neither a NASA astronaut, nor a Roscosmos cosmonaut, after Expedition 21 in 2009, when ESA astronaut Frank De Winne was in command. The expedition lasted two months.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Positions\n!First Part(March 2013)\n!Second Part(March 2013 to May 2013)\n|-\n!Commander\n|colspan=2 align=center| Chris Hadfield, CSAThird and last spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 1\n|colspan=2 align=center| Thomas Marshburn, NASASecond spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 2\n|colspan=2 align=center| Roman Romanenko, RSASecond and last spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 3\n|\n|align=center| Christopher Cassidy, NASASecond spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 4\n|\n|align=center| Pavel Vinogradov, RSAThird spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 5\n|\n|align=center| Aleksandr Misurkin, RSAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n|}\n;Source:\nNASA\nMission highlights\nThe mission generated considerable media attention and turned Commander Chris Hadfield into a minor celebrity. The expedition made extensive use of social media, and several videos uploaded to YouTube have generated millions of hits.  In particular, Hadfield was involved in the \"first music video recorded in space\", a rendition of David Bowie's 1969 song \"Space Oddity\". Hadfield was also involved in the revealing of the Bank of Canada's new $5 note, part of the Frontier Series of polymer bills released in 2013. The revealing occurred via video on the ISS.\nDuring Expedition 35, the SpaceX CRS-2 mission successfully delivered supplies to the station and returned some cargo from space.  This was the second of SpaceX's contracted cargo flights to the ISS and the first to use the unpressurized trunk section.\nOn 11 May 11, 2013, Christopher Cassidy and Thomas Marshburn performed an unplanned spacewalk to replace a pump controller box suspected to be the source of an ammonia coolant leak.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/index.html NASA's Space Station Expeditions page]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo An edited version of Chris Hadfield's Space Oddity music video]"
