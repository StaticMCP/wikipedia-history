It covers the communities of Splott and Tremorfa (which was created  from the northeastern part of Splott in 2016).\nDescription\nThe Splott ward is bordered to the north by the Penylan and Rumney wards, to the northwest by Adamsdown, to the southwest by the Butetown ward. To the southeast is the Severn Estuary.\nThe Splott ward elected two councillors to Cardiff Council in 1995 and has elected three councillors since 1999. It has been represented by the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. In May 2012 all three seats were won by a new team of Labour councillors, after a bitter campaign where the Liberal Democrats making a complaint to the police that Labour candidate, Luke Holland, had given a misleading address on his notice of poll.\nSplott councillor Huw Thomas became leader of the Labour-controlled Cardiff Council in May 2017. Lord Jack Brooks, who became leader of South Glamorgan County Council, was a Splott councillor during the 80s and 90s.\nCardiff's first ethnic minority councillor, Manuel Delgado, was elected for Labour in the Splott ward in May 1967. Of Cape Verdean heritage, Delgado is also claimed as the first black councillor in Wales. He also became Cardiff's first black magistrate in 1969.\nCounty councillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | Representation 1995 &ndash; date\n|-\n|-\n! valign=\"top\" | Election\n|\n! align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;Lib Dem&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n| 2017\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 3\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | -\n|-\n| 2012\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 3\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | -\n|-\n| 2008\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 1\n|-\n| 2004\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 1\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2\n|-\n| 1999\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 3\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | -\n|-\n| 1995\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2\n|\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | -\n|-\n|}\nCardiff County Borough Council\nPrior to 1890 the Splott area was covered by the East ward of Cardiff. In July 1890, following the creation of Cardiff County Borough Council, Splott was the name of one of the ten new electoral wards created in the county borough. Each of the three councillors took turns to stand for re-election, on a three-yearly cycle.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
