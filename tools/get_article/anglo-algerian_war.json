The war happened when the English navy destroyed some Algerian privateers near Bougie in 1672; the Algerian Diwan responded by capturing sailors and ships between 1674 and 1676. In 1677, Algiers declared war on England.\nThe Algerians began capturing English ships in the Channel. The English admiral, John Narborough, began blockading Algiers. Several Algerian and English ships engaged in pitched battles in the western Mediterranean Sea. The English Admiral, Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington, succeeded Narborough in the Mediterranean. Several English ships were captured by the Algerians during the war. Notable smaller ones were HMS  Robert of Dartmouth with 6 crews on October 29, 1677, and HMS Speedwell with 5 crews in September 1679. The Algerian also captured large ones, including HMS Phoenix and its 49 crew. The English ships HMS William and HMS Samuel were blown up during a battle with Algerians. 25 were killed and 21 were captured in June 1679.\nThe Algerians have captured 153 ships (some higher estimates go to 500) and between 1,850 and 3,000 Englishmen. The war ended in 1682 with a treaty between both nations. The ransom for the sailors cost £100 each and the important passengers £1,000, which was added to their cargo and vessels. This whole ransom cost the English between £500,000 and £800,000. The English also agreed to pay subsidies and promised their ships to carry formal passes, which the Algerians agreed to and respected.\nReferences\nSources\n* Adrian Tinniswood (2010), Pirates of Barbary, Corsairs, Conquests and Captivity in the Seventeenth-Century Mediterranean.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/Pirates_of_Barbary/IBSVMivndEQC?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Pirates+of+Barbary:+Corsairs,+Conquests+and+Captivity+in+the+Seventeenth-century+Mediterranean+153+ships&pg=PT237&printsec=frontcover]\n* Bernard Capp (2022), British Slaves and Barbary Corsairs, 1580-1750.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/British_Slaves_and_Barbary_Corsairs_1580/tLVoEAAAQBAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=153+British+ships+1682&pg=PA17&printsec=frontcover]\n* Linda Colley (2007), Captives, Britain, Empire, and the World, 1600-1850.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/Captives/G3pGviSiUlMC?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=1,850+seamen+1682+captured&pg=PA53&printsec=frontcover]"
