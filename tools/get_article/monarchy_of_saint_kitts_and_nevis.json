The current monarch of Saint Kitts and Nevis, since , is . As sovereign, he is the personal embodiment of the Crown of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Although the person of the sovereign is equally shared with 14 other independent countries within the Commonwealth of Nations, each country's monarchy is separate and legally distinct. As a result, the current monarch is officially titled  of Saint Christopher and Nevis and, in this capacity, he and other members of the royal family undertake public and private functions domestically and abroad as representatives of Saint Kitts and Nevis. However, the  is the only member of the royal family with any constitutional role.\nAll executive authority is vested in the monarch, and royal assent is required for the National Assembly of Saint Kitts and Nevis to enact laws and for letters patent and Orders in Council to have legal effect. Most of the powers are exercised by the elected members of parliament, the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from amongst them, and the judges and justices of the peace. Other powers vested in the monarch, such as dismissal of a prime minister, are significant but are treated only as reserve powers and as an important security part of the role of the monarchy.\nThe Crown today primarily functions as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power. While some powers are exercisable only by the sovereign, most of the monarch's operational and ceremonial duties are exercised by his representative, the governor-general of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nOrigins\nSir Thomas Warner arrived from England in 1623, and established the first successful English colony in the West Indies at Old Road on the west coast. The French first arrived on the island in 1625 and established a colony in 1627 under Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc. Divided during the 17th century between French and English colonists, Saint Kitts was given to Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht of April 1713 and remained in British possession despite the capture of Brimstone Hill in 1782 by the French. The island was restored to Britain by the Peace of Paris treaty signed in 1783.\nNevis was settled by the English in 1628 and soon became one of the most prosperous of the Antilles. Although it suffered from French and Spanish attacks in the 17th and 18th centuries, it maintained a sound economic position until the mid-19th century.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, along with Anguilla, were federated in 1882. After a brief period as part of the West Indies Federation, the islands became an associated state with full internal autonomy in 1967. Both Nevis and Anguilla were unhappy at St Kitts's domination of the federation, with Anguilla unilaterally declaring independence in 1967. After unsuccessful negotiations, the Anguilla Act of July 1971 placed Anguilla directly under British control. In 1976, Anguilla was granted a constitution, and its union with Saint Kitts and Nevis was formally severed in 1980.\nA constitutional conference was held in London in 1982. In spite of disagreement over special provisions for Nevis, Saint Kitts and Nevis achieved full independence on 19 September 1983, as an independent realm within the Commonwealth, with Queen Elizabeth II as the head of state and Queen of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nPrincess Margaret represented the Queen at the independence celebrations. She was greeted with a 21-gun salute at Golden Rock airport, and a crowd of thousands cheered the Princess. Following the flag-raising ceremony after midnight, the Princess read a message from her sister, the Queen, and formally handed over the constitutional volumes to the Prime-Minister designate, Kennedy Simmonds.\nThe Crown of Saint Kitts and Nevis and its aspects\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is one of fifteen independent nations, known as Commonwealth realms, which shares its sovereign with other monarchies in the Commonwealth of Nations, with the monarch's relationship with Saint Kitts and Nevis completely independent from his position as monarch of any other realm. Despite sharing the same person as their respective monarch, each of the Commonwealth realms — including Saint Kitts and Nevis — is sovereign and independent of the others. The monarch is represented by a viceroy—the governor-general of Saint Kitts and Nevis—in the country.\nat Buckingham Palace, 2023]]\nSince the independence of Saint Kitts and Nevis in 1983, the pan-national Crown has had both a shared and a separate character and the sovereign's role as monarch of Saint Kitts and Nevis is distinct to their position as monarch of any other realm, including the United Kingdom. The monarchy thus ceased to be an exclusively British institution and in Saint Kitts and Nevis became a national, or \"domesticated\" establishment.\nThis division is illustrated in a number of ways: The sovereign, for example, holds a unique title in relation to Saint Kitts and Nevis and, when he is acting in public specifically as a representative of the country, he uses, where possible, symbols of Saint Kitts and Nevis, including the country's national flag, unique royal symbols, and the like. Also, only Saint Kitts and Nevis government ministers can advise the sovereign on matters of the country.\nIn Saint Kitts and Nevis, the legal personality of the State is referred to as \"His Majesty in right of Saint Christopher and Nevis\", or the \"Crown in right of the Government of Saint Christopher and Nevis\".\nTitle\nIn Saint Christopher and Nevis, the monarch's style is: Charles the Third, by the Grace of God, King of Saint Christopher and Nevis and of His other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth.\nOath of allegiance\nAs the embodiment of the state, the monarch is the locus of oaths of Allegiance. This is done in reciprocation to the sovereign's Coronation Oath, wherein they promise to govern the peoples of their realms, \"according to their respective laws and customs\".\nThe oath of allegiance in Saint Kitts and Nevis is:\nSuccession\n, is the current heir apparent to the throne of Saint Kitts and Nevis]]\nSuccession is by absolute primogeniture governed by the provisions of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, as well as the Act of Settlement, 1701, and the Bill of Rights, 1689. This legislation limits the succession to the natural (i.e. non-adopted), legitimate descendants of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and stipulates that the monarch cannot be a Roman Catholic, and must be in communion with the Church of England upon ascending the throne.\nThough these constitutional laws, as they apply to Saint Kitts and Nevis, still lie within the control of the British parliament, both the United Kingdom and Saint Kitts and Nevis cannot change the rules of succession without the unanimous consent of the other realms, unless explicitly leaving the shared monarchy relationship; a situation that applies identically in all the other realms, and which has been likened to a treaty amongst these countries. Saint Kitts and Nevis last indicated its consent to alteration to the line of succession in 2013, when the National Assembly passed the Succession to the Crown Act, which signified the legislature's acceptance to the British Parliament's Succession to the Crown Act 2013.\nUpon a demise of the Crown (the death or abdication of a sovereign), it is customary for the accession of the new monarch to be proclaimed by the governor-general in the capital, Basseterre, after the accession. Regardless of any proclamations, the late sovereign's heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without any need for confirmation or further ceremony. An appropriate period of mourning also follows, during which flags across the country are flown at half-mast to honour the late monarch.\nFederal constitutional role\nThe Constitution of Saint Kitts and Nevis gives Saint Kitts and Nevis a parliamentary system of government under a federal constitutional monarchy, wherein the role of the monarch and governor-general is both legal and practical, but not political. The Crown is regarded as a corporation, in which several parts share the authority of the whole, with the sovereign as the person at the centre of the constitutional construct, meaning all powers of state are constitutionally reposed in the monarch. The government of Saint Kitts and Nevis is also thus formally referred to as ''His Majesty's Government of Saint Christopher and Nevis''.\nMost of the monarch's domestic duties are performed by the governor-general, appointed by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nExecutive\n, Basseterre, the official residence of the governor-general]]\nOne of the main duties of the Crown is to appoint a prime minister, who thereafter heads the cabinet and advises the monarch or governor-general on how to execute their executive powers over all aspects of government operations and foreign affairs. The monarch's, and thereby the viceroy's role is almost entirely symbolic and cultural, acting as a symbol of the legal authority under which all governments and agencies operate, while the Cabinet directs the use of the Royal Prerogative, which includes the privilege to declare war, maintain the King's peace, and direct the actions of the Saint Kitts and Nevis Defence Force, as well as to summon and prorogue parliament and call elections. However, it is important to note that the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of the ministers, though it might have sometimes appeared that way, and the constitution allows the governor-general to unilaterally use these powers in relation to the dismissal of a prime minister, dissolution of parliament, and removal of a judge in exceptional, constitutional crisis situations.\nThere are also a few duties which are specifically performed by the monarch, such as appointing the governor-general.\nThe governor-general, to maintain the stability of the government of Saint Kitts and Nevis, appoints as prime minister the individual most likely to maintain the support of the National of Assembly. The governor-general additionally appoints a Cabinet, at the direction of the prime minister. The monarch is informed by his viceroy of the acceptance of the resignation of a prime minister and the swearing-in of a new prime minister and other members of the ministry, and he remains fully briefed through regular communications from his Saint Kitts and Nevis ministers.\nForeign affairs\nwith US Ambassador Larry Leon Palmer, 2013]]\nThe Royal Prerogative further extends to foreign affairs: the governor-general ratifies treaties, alliances, and international agreements. As with other uses of the Royal Prerogative, no parliamentary approval is required. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of Saint Kitts and Nevis; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The governor-general, on behalf of the monarch, also accredits Saint Kitts and Nevis High Commissioners and ambassadors and receives diplomats from foreign states. In addition, the issuance of passports falls under the Royal Prerogative and, as such, all Saint Kitts and Nevis passports are issued in the governor-general's name, the monarch's representative in Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nParliament\nThe sovereign, along with the National Assembly, is one of the two components of the Parliament of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nParliament meets only by royal summons and no bill becomes law without Royal Assent. Further, the constitution outlines that the governor-general alone is responsible for appointing senators. One-third of all senatorial appointments are made by the governor-general on the advice of the leader of the opposition, and others on the advice of prime minister. The viceroy additionally summons, prorogues, and dissolves parliament; after the latter, the writs for a general election are usually dropped by the governor-general at Government House, Basseterre.\nThe new parliamentary session is marked by the Opening of the National Assembly, during which the monarch or governor-general reads the Speech from the Throne.\nAll laws in Saint Kitts and Nevis are enacted only with the viceroy's granting of Royal Assent in the monarch's name. Thus, bills begin with the phrase: \"Be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the National Assembly of Saint Christopher Nevis and by the authority of the same as follows\". The Royal Assent, and proclamation, are required for all acts of parliament, usually granted or withheld by the governor-general, with the Public Seal of Saint Christopher and Nevis.\nCourts\nThe Sovereign is deemed the \"fount of justice,\" and is responsible for rendering justice for all subjects. The Sovereign does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead, judicial functions are performed in his or her name. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, criminal offences are legally deemed to be offences against the sovereign, and proceedings for indictable offences are brought in the sovereign's name in the form of The King [or Queen] versus [Name]. Hence, the common law holds that the sovereign \"can do no wrong\"; the monarch cannot be prosecuted in his or her own courts for criminal offences.\nThe highest court of appeal for Saint Kitts and Nevis is the Judicial Committee of the King's Privy Council.\nThe governor-general, on behalf of the monarch of Saint Kitts and Nevis, can also grant immunity from prosecution, exercise the royal prerogative of mercy, and pardon offences against the Crown, either before, during, or after a trial. The exercise of the 'Prerogative of mercy' to grant a pardon and the commutation of prison sentences is described in section 66 of the Constitution.\nMonarchy in Nevis\nBy the arrangements of the constitution of the federation, the monarchy of Saint Kitts and Nevis operates separately on the island of Nevis, and the Crown within the jurisdiction of Nevis is referred to as the Crown in right of the Nevis Island Administration.\nThe governor-general appoints a deputy governor-general for Nevis, who performs the functions of the vice-regal office on the island. As representative of the monarch, the deputy governor-general resides at Government House south of Charlestown, Nevis.\nThe monarch and the Nevis Island Assembly constitute the Nevis Island Legislature. One-third of the nominated members of the Assembly are appointed by the governor-general in accordance with the advice of the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, and others are appointed by the governor-general in accordance with the advice of the premier of Nevis. All bills passed by the Nevis Island Assembly require Royal assent. The governor-general is also responsible for dissolving the Assembly on the advice of the premier.\nThe governor-general, to maintain the stability of the Nevis Island Administration, appoints as premier the individual most likely to maintain the support of the majority of the elected members of the Nevis Island Assembly. The governor-general also appoints other members of the Administration from among the members of the Assembly, acting in accordance with the advice of the premier.\nThe function of the Nevis Island Administration is to advise the governor-general in the government of the island of Nevis. The Administration is collectively responsible to the Assembly for any advice given to the governor-general.\nCultural role\nThe Crown and Honours\nWithin the Commonwealth realms, the monarch is deemed the fount of honour. Similarly, the monarch, as Sovereign of Saint Kitts and Nevis, confers awards and honours in Saint Kitts and Nevis in his name. Most of them are often awarded on the advice of \"His Majesty's Saint Christopher and Nevis Ministers\".\nThrough the passage of the National Honours Act in 1998, Saint Kitts and Nevis established three classes of award: the Order of National Hero, the Star of Merit and the Medal of Honour. In 2005, another class of award was added, namely the Order of St Christopher and Nevis. All these honours and awards form part of \"The Order of Honour, Decorations and Medals\", which consists of the governor-general as President, and the secretary to the governor-general as Secretary of the Order. The National Awards Committee is responsible for submitting nominations for the candidates to the office of the prime minister, which then forwards the recommendations to the governor-general. Investitures are conducted by the governor-general at Government House.\nThe Crown and the Defence Force\nThe Crown sits at the pinnacle of the Saint Kitts and Nevis Defence Force. St Edward's Crown appears on Saint Kitts and Nevis Defence Force badges and rank insignia, which illustrates the monarchy as the locus of authority. As representative of the sovereign, the governor-general acts as commander-in-chief of the Defence Force.\nThe power to grant commissions in the Defence Force is vested in the monarch, and is exercised on the monarch's behalf by the governor-general.\nThe Crown and the Police Force\nThe national police force of Saint Kitts and Nevis is known as \"The Royal St Christopher and Nevis Police Force\".\nThe St. Edward's Crown appears on the Police's badges and rank insignia, which illustrates the monarchy as the locus of authority.\nEvery member of the Royal St Christopher and Nevis Police Force has to swear allegiance to the monarch of Saint Kitts and Nevis, on taking office. Under The Police Act, 2002, the oath of allegiance, is:\nRoyal symbols\nThe main symbol of the monarchy of Saint Kitts and Nevis is the sovereign himself. Thus, framed portraits of him are displayed in public buildings and government offices. The monarch also appears on commemorative stamps of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\nA crown is also used to illustrate the monarchy as the locus of authority, appearing on defence and police force, postal workers, prison officers rank insignia.\nGod Save The King is the royal anthem of Sanit Kitts and Nevis.\nUnder the Saint Christopher and Nevis Citizenship Act, new citizens of the country have swear allegiance to the monarch, and his heirs and successors.\nFlag of the Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis.svg|The flag of governor-general of Saint Kitts and Nevis featuring the St Edward's Crown\nRoyal St Christopher and Nevis Police Force emblem.svg|The emblem of Royal St Christopher and Nevis Police Force featuring the Crown\nSaint Kitts and Nevis Defence Force insignia.svg|The emblem of Saint Kitts and Nevis Defence Force featuring the Tudor Crown\nSaint Kitts and Nevis stamp type B2.jpg|Saint Kitts and Nevis meter stamp displaying St Edward's Crown\nRoyal visits\n| salign=right| source=Charles, Prince of Wales, 2019}}\n20th century\nPrincess Margaret visited Saint Kitts in February 1955.\nQueen Elizabeth II and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, visited Saint Kitts and Nevis in 1966. During their visit on 22 February, the Queen held an investiture at Government House attended by about 50 guests. Afterwards, the Queen and the Duke attended a reception, where about 700 people were present. Later, they watched a fireworks display from Basseterre Water Front. At Government House in Nevis, Chief Minister C A Paul Southwell presented a large relief map of Nevis to the Queen. Prince Charles visited in June 1973 to open the newly-restored Prince of Wales Bastion at the Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park.\nPrincess Margaret visited in September 1983 to represent the Queen at the independence celebrations.

They also visited Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park and the children's ward of the JNF Hospital and the Children's Home before attending a state dinner and fireworks display at Port Zante.\n| salign=right| source=Prince Henry of Wales, 2016}}\nPrince Harry visited in 2016, the year of the Queen's 90th birthday. The Prince arrived on 23 November, and was welcomed by a military parade at Port Zante, and later attended a youth rally at Brimstone Hill Fortress. Here, the Prince also unveiled a Saint Kitts and Nevis dedication to the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy. Prince Harry then travelled by boat to Charlestown Pier on the neighbouring island of Nevis, where he visited a local turtle conservation initiative on Lovers Beach. In the evening, the Prince returned to Saint Kitts to attend a reception hosted by the governor-general at Government House.\nThe Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited Saint Kitts and Nevis in 2019. They arrived in Basseterre on 21 March, and met local residents. At the National Museum, they learnt more about the history of Saint Kitts and Nevis and signed a scroll to mark the Royal visit and the building's 125th anniversary. The Prince and the Duchess then travelled to the island of Nevis by boat, and received a welcome from masquerade dancers. At the Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park, the Prince learnt more about the area and see the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy. The Duchess visited Hermitage Plantation House, where she met local women, and viewed an arts and craft display. In the evening, the couple attended a reception hosted by the governor-general. During a speech, the Prince of Wales announced the creation of The Prince of Wales's Commonwealth Scholarships to mark the 70th anniversary of the modern Commonwealth and in recognition of his birthday.\nDebate\nIn September 2022, Prime Minister Terrance Drew said that his government had \"set our eyes on transitioning into a republic\", and in May 2023, Drew suggested that Saint Kitts and Nevis was \"not totally free\" whilst Charles III is the head of state. Drew said that he would begin a public consultation on becoming a republic and supported reparations for slavery.\nA 2023 opinion poll found that 52% supported keeping the monarchy whilst 45% preferred Saint Kitts and Nevis to become a republic.\nList of Saint Kitts and Nevis monarchs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Regnal name(Birth–Death)\n! colspan=2   | Reign over Saint Kitts and Nevis\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Full name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Consort\n! rowspan=\"2\" | House\n|-\n!Start\n!End\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Elizabeth II(1926–2022)\n|19 September 1983\n|8 September 2022\n|Elizabeth Alexandra Mary\n|Philip Mountbatten\n|Windsor\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |Governors-general: Sir Clement Arrindell, Sir Cuthbert Sebastian, Sir Edmund Lawrence, Sir Tapley SeatonPrime ministers: Kennedy Simmonds, Denzil Douglas, Timothy Harris, Terrance Drew\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Charles III(b. 1948)\n|8 September 2022\n|present\n|Charles Philip Arthur George\n|Camilla Shand\n|Windsor\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |Governors-general: Sir Tapley Seaton, Dame Marcella LiburdPrime ministers: Terrance Drew\n|}\nSee also\n* Lists of office-holders\n* List of prime ministers of Elizabeth II\n* List of prime ministers of Charles III\n* List of Commonwealth visits made by Elizabeth II\n* Monarchies in the Americas\n* List of monarchies\nReferences\n}}"
