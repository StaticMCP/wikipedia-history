Qalawun informed al-Kawrani of the importance of this campaign. The Mamluk army moved towards Makuria divided into 3 parts, led by al-Kawrano, Izz al-Din Aidmar, and Sanjar al-Masruri.\nThe Battle\nWhen the Mamluks reached the first border of Makuria, all Makurian forces withdrew from it. The Makurian forces kept retreating until the Mamluk army reached Dongola, the Makurian capital. There, a violent battle took place between the Mamluks and the Makurians, which ended in a Mamluk victory. King Samamun of Makuria fled to the far south of Nubia, and the Mamluks  appointed his nephew as governor of Makuria under the suzerainty of the Mamluk Sultanate. A garrison was left in Dongola to preserve Mamluk rule.\nReferences"
