For the purpose of this list, India is defined as the area contained roughly within the natural boundaries of the Himalayas to the north, the Hindu Kush and Suleiman ranges to the northwest, the Bay of Bengal to the east, the Arabian Sea to the west, and the Indian Ocean to the south.\nThese historical regions were current in different time periods – from ancient to medieval and early modern eras – and may often overlap. Political boundaries have shifted significantly over the centuries, so usually a historical region cannot be assigned to any single modern state or administrative boundary.
