Since this abuse had spread to the Greeks, Innocent IV strictly forbade it in his letter to the bishop of Tusculum: \"Women should not dare to serve at the altar; they should be altogether refused this ministry.\" We too have forbidden this practice in the same words in Our oft-repeated constitution Etsi Pastoralis, sect. 6, no. 21.\"\n* Late 18th century: John Wesley allowed women to preach within his Methodist movement.\n19th century\n* 19th century: Women's mosques, called nusi, and female imams have existed since the 19th century in China and continue today.\n* 19th century: Hannah Rachel Verbermacher, also known as the Maiden of Ludmir (Ludmirer Moyd), became the only female Rebbe in the history of the Hasidic movement; she lived in Ukraine and Israel.\n* Early 19th century: In the United States, in contrast with almost every other organized denomination, the Society of Friends (Quakers) has allowed women to serve as ministers since the early 19th century.\n* 1807: The Primitive Methodist Church in Britain first allowed female ministers.\n* 1810: The Christian Connection Church, an early relative of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the United Church of Christ, ordained women as early as 1810.\n* 1815:\n* Clarissa Danforth was ordained in New England.

The UUA became the first large denomination to have a majority of female ministers.\n* 1865: The Salvation Army was founded, which in the English Methodist tradition always ordained both men and women.

Since then two more denominations have joined the union: The Reformed Churches of Christ (1982) and the Congregational Church of Scotland (2000).

Kaplan held the first public celebration of a bat mitzvah in the United States, for his daughter Judith, on March 18, 1922, at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, his synagogue in New York City. Judith Kaplan recited the preliminary blessing, read a portion of that week's Torah portion in Hebrew and English, and then intoned the closing blessing. Kaplan, who at that time claimed to be an Orthodox rabbi, joined Conservative Judaism and then became the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, influenced Jews from all branches of non-Orthodox Judaism, through his position at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. At the time, most Orthodox rabbis strongly rejected the idea of a bat mitzvah ceremony.\n* The Annual Conference of the Church of the Brethren granted women the right to be licensed into the ministry, but not to be ordained with the same status as men.\n* The Presbyterian General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America allowed women to be deaconesses.\n* 1923:\n* The Foursquare Church is an Evangelical Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1923 by preacher Aimee Semple McPherson.\n* The First World Congress of Jewish Women was held in Vienna, Austria, in May 1923.

The ostensible reason for the prohibition was to maintain peace and harmony in the home.

She was born in Hong Kong, and was ordained in Guandong province in unoccupied China on January 25, 1944, on account of a severe shortage of priests due to World War II. When the war ended, she was forced to relinquish her priesthood, yet she was reinstated as a priest later in 1971 in Hong Kong. \"When Hong Kong ordained two further women priests in 1971 (Joyce Bennett and Jane Hwang), Florence Li Tim-Oi was officially recognised as a priest by the diocese.\" She later moved to Toronto, Canada, and assisted as a priest there from 1983 onwards.\n* 1945:  Kitamura Sayo founded the \"dancing religion\", Tenshō Kōtai Jingūkyō.\n* 1946: The new Silverman siddur (of Conservative Judaism) changed the traditional words of thanking God for \"not making me a woman\", instead using words thanking God for \"making me a free person.\"\n* 1947:\n* The Lutheran Protestant Church started to ordain women as priests.\n* The Czechoslovak Hussite Church started to ordain women.\n* 1948: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark started to ordain women.\n* 1949:\n* The Old Catholic Church (in the U.S.) started to ordain women.\n* Women were allowed to preach in the Church of Scotland from 1949.\n* Eleanora Figaro became the first black woman to receive the papal honor Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice.\n* Élisabeth Schmidt became the first woman to be ordained as a pastor of the Reformed Church of France.\nLate 20th century\n1950s\n* 1950: In August 1950, amidst the success of Dianetics, Hubbard held a demonstration in Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience including many reporters and photographers as \"the world's first Clear.\" However, despite Hubbard's claim that she had \"full and perfect recall of every moment of her life\", Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie.  Hubbard explained Bianca's failure to display her promised powers of recall to the audience by saying that he had used the word \"now\" in calling her to the stage, and thus inadvertently froze her in \"present time,\" which blocked her abilities. Later, in the late 1950s, Hubbard would claim that several people had reached the state of Clear by the time he presented Bianca as the world's first; these others, Hubbard said, he had successfully cleared in the late 1940s while working incognito in Hollywood posing as a swami. In 1966, Hubbard declared South African Scientologist John McMaster to be the first true Clear. McMaster left the Sea Org in November 1969, expressing continuing belief in the Scientology techniques, but disapproval of the way Scientology was managed.\n* 1951: From 1951 until 1953, Paula Ackerman served as Temple Beth Israel's spiritual leader.

It is not about the sister of Saint Martha, nor about the sinful woman whose sins the Lord forgave ().\" Elsewhere it said of the Roman liturgy of 22 July that \"it will make mention neither of Mary of Bethany nor of the sinful woman of Luke 7:36–50, but only of Mary Magdalene, the first person to whom Christ appeared after his resurrection\".\n* 1969: Rosamund Essex became the first woman to be licensed as a Reader in the Church of England.\n1970s\n* 1970:\n* Mate Mahadevi was installed as a jagadguru (spiritual head of the Indian Lingayat community), the first time a woman had been placed in that position.\n* The Northern Province of the Moravian Church approved women for ordination in 1970 at the Provincial Synod, but it was not until 1975 that Mary Matz became the first female minister within the Moravian Church.\n* In 1963 the Second Vatican Council requested a revision of the rite of the consecration of virgins that was found in the Roman Pontifical; the revised Rite was approved by Pope Paul VI and published in 1970.

On January 1, 1988 the Lutheran Church in America, the American Lutheran Church, and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches merged to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which continues to ordain women. (The first woman ordained by the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, Janith Otte, was ordained in 1977.)\n* According to statements made in 1995 and later, the underground Catholic bishop Felix Maria Davídek, who was a friend of her family, secretly ordained Ludmila Javorová on December 28, 1970. Historians Fiala and Hanuš conclude that these women he ordained (there were about five, Javorová being the only publicly known) found very few specific sacerdotal tasks in Davídek's group, and conclude from this that their ordinations can therefore be considered as only a \"symbolical act and a precedent\".\n* 1971:\n* Venerable Voramai, also called Ta Tao Fa Tzu, became the first fully ordained Thai woman in the Mahayana lineage in Taiwan and turned her family home into a monastery.\n* Joyce Bennett and Jane Hwang were the first regularly ordained priests in the Anglican Church in Hong Kong.\n* 1972:\n* Freda Smith became the first female minister to be ordained by the Metropolitan Community Church.\n* Sally Priesand became America's first female rabbi ordained by a rabbinical seminary, and the second formally ordained female rabbi in Jewish history, after Regina Jonas.\n* Elizabeth Bailey became the first virgin to be consecrated in England since the 3rd century.\n* 1973:\n* Freda Smith became the first woman elected to the Metropolitan Community Church's board of elders in 1973, at the fourth general conference in Atlanta, when the board was expanded from four members to seven.\n* Emma Sommers Richards became the first Mennonite woman to be ordained as a pastor of a Mennonite congregation (Lombard Mennonite Church in Illinois).\n* The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism voted to count women and men equally as members of a minyan.\n* 1974:\n* The Methodist Church in the United Kingdom started to ordain women again (after a lapse of ordinations).\n* Sandy Eisenberg Sasso became the first female rabbi to be ordained in Reconstructionist Judaism.\n* Katie Cannon was ordained on April 24, 1974, in Shelby, North Carolina, by the Catawba Presbytery, in the Synod of Catawba, becoming the first African-American woman to be ordained in the United Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).\n* On July 29, 1974, Bishops Daniel Corrigan, Robert L. DeWitt, and Edward R. Welles of the Episcopal Church of the U.S., with Bishop Antonio Ramos of Costa Rica, ordained eleven women as priests in a ceremony that was widely considered \"irregular\" because the women lacked \"recommendation from the standing committee,\" a canonical prerequisite for ordination. The \"Philadelphia Eleven\", as they became known, were Merrill Bittner, Alison Cheek, Alla Bozarth (Campell), Emily C. Hewitt, Carter Heyward, Suzanne R.

Because of this collective undertaking, the Fine responsum holds that Conservative women are eligible to serve as agents and decision-makers for others.  The responsum also holds that traditionally-minded communities and individual women can opt out without being regarded by the Conservative movement as sinning.  By adopting this responsum, the CJLS found itself in a position to provide a considered Jewish-law justification for its egalitarian practices, without having to rely on potentially unconvincing arguments, undermine the religious importance of community and clergy, ask individual women intrusive questions, repudiate the halakhic tradition, or label women following traditional practices as sinners.\n* 2003:\n* Ayya Sudhamma Bhikkhuni became the first American-born woman to gain bhikkhuni ordination in the Theravada school in Sri Lanka.\n* Sarah Schechter became the first female rabbi in the U.S. Air Force.\n* Sandra Kochmann, born in Paraguay, became the first female rabbi in Brazil.\n* Born in Canada and educated in England, Nancy Morris became Scotland's first female rabbi in 2003.\n* Rabbi Janet Marder was named the first female president of the Reform Movement's Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) on March 26, 2003, making her the first woman to lead a major rabbinical organization and the first woman to lead any major Jewish co-ed religious organization in the United States.\n* On February 28, 2003, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, formerly known as Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, became the first Thai woman to receive full ordination as a Theravada nun.
