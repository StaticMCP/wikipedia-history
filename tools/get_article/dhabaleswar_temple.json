It is situated at a distance of 27&nbsp;km from the city of Cuttack, Odisha, India, on the riverine island of Lord Dhabaleshwar. The temple, located on an island on River Mahanadi, is embellished with stone carvings that date back to the early 10th and 11th century. The serene ambiance, in which the temple is situated, inspires spiritual feeling among one and all.\nMythical Origin\nThe name Dhabaleswar (Dhabala or White + Eeswar or God) is attributed to a miracle performed by Lord Shiva. Once a thief stole a black bull calf from a village and fled to a Shiva temple. He hid himself with the calf in the sanctum while the angry crowd waited outside the temple. The crowd could clearly hear the calf calling out. The thief prayed fervently to Lord Shiva to deliver him from the crowd. Taking pity on him, the Lord appeared as a Sanyassin before the crowd and asked them the cause of their agitation On being told that they suspected the thief of hiding in the sanctum along with the black calf, the sanyassin brought the calf outside to dispel their doubts. The calf turned out to be white, seeing which the crowd let the thief go. The sanyassin disappeared  and the thief realized who had come to his aid. He confessed and apologized to the crowd. He took a vow to spend the rest of his life in the service of the Lord. The act of turning a black calf to white caused Lord Shiva to be also known as Dhabaleswara.\nPresent Temple\nThe temple structure was constructed during the rule of Somavamshi dynasty by King Yayati Keshari.The present day temple was renovated and repaired by rulers of the Athgarh State.\nReaching the Temple\nThe temple can be reached by bus via Chowdwar, Nuapatana, Mancheshwar.\nIt can also be reached via Bidanasi through boating on river Mahanadi during previous days but now a bridge has been made by odisha govt.\nOdisha's first ever foot hanging bridge is connecting the exotic island with mancheswar which is the major way to reach the temple.\nBeing situated on an island, the temple can be reached by boats leaving from ferries in or near Cuttack.
