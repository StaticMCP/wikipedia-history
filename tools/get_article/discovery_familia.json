Discovery. It launched on November 1, 2007, after Discovery Communications merged its pre-existing Spanish-language channels, Discovery Kids en Español and Discovery Viajar y Vivir (Travel & Living) into one channel space. Both networks launched together on June 30, 2005.\nProgramming for preschoolers airs from 6:00 a.m to 11:00 a.m Eastern Time, while the rest of the schedule is devoted to family-oriented programming dubbed from the American Discovery networks or natively in Spanish from its sister networks worldwide.\n, approximately 5.8 million American households (or 5% of households with television) receive Discovery Familia.\nSee also\n* Discovery Kids (Latin America)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
