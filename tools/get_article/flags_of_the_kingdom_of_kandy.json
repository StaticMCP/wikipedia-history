The kingdom succeeded from the Kotte Kingdom in around 1469, continued the use of the heraldic emblems of Kotte.\nRoyal Flags\nThe royal family and their flags took pre-eminence over all.\nSri Rajadhi Rajasinha (1782-1798)\nFile:NG-1985-7-1-8 Sinhalese officers and Kandyan ambassadors.jpg|An earlier version of the Royal Standard carried by the envoys of the king to the Dutch Governor in 1785\nSri Vikrama Rajasinha (1798-1815)\nThe flag of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha (1798–1815), the only flag of a Sri Lankan monarch so far known to be in existence. A fragment of a manuscript on flags in the library of the Malwathu Maha Viharaya records: \"The Sinhalese royal standard: a banner bearing the device of a lion holding a sword in its right paw. This was the flag of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, (1798-1815) who became the Sinhalese King.\" This flag was lost when it had been picked up from the battle ground at Hanwella Fort in 1803 by British Capt. William Pollock when Sri Vikrama Rajasinha and his forces had to retreat during the Battle of Hanwella of the First Kandyan War.\nThis flag was rediscovered in 1908 by E. W. Perera, along with two other Sinhalese flags, at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London. At the time Perera found the flag, he had to repair it and prepare a sketch for publication as it was already in a very bad state of preservation and unsuitable for photography. In 1916 E. W. Perera reproduces a sketch of the flag, without colours, in plate No. 100 in his well-known monograph, Sinhalese Banners and Standards published in 1916.\n|author = Edward W.

Panawatta identified it as the civil standard of the Kandyan kings, a flag that continued to be used during the reign of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. He also clarified that this flag is distinct from the Sinhalese Royal Flag, which serves as the basis for the modern national flag of Sri Lanka, now modified with the addition of two stripes.\nFile:Photograph of the flag of the Kandyan Kingdom.jpg|Photograph of the Royal Standard of the Kandyan kings\nDisavani flags\nThe Kandyan kingdom was divided into 21 provinces, 12 Disavanis and 9 Ratas. Ratas were smaller administrative divisions in close proximity to the central government and governed by a Rate Mahatmaya, while Disavanis were larger, further away and governed by a Dissava (governor), acting as a representative of the king. Each disavani and rata was divided into Korales and the Korales in turn were divided into Pattu (singular, pattuva). Each pattuva consisted of a large number of villages which varied in extant and composition.\nEach Disavani was entitled to have a distinct flag and each Disava was preceded by his particular flag while he was travelling in his disavani symbolizing their power and authority. Rate Mahatmaya had vastly lessor power and authority including that of not having the right to a flag.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"width:110px;\"|Flag!! style=\"width:100px;\"|Date!! style=\"width:250px;\"|Use!! style=\"width:500px;\"|Description\n|-\n| colspan=4 align=center|Maha Disavani\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of the Satara Korales || Ira Handa Maha Kodiya (Sun and Moon Flag)Sun, moon and stars, on a white field\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of the Sat Korales || Siṇhayâ Maha Kodiya (Lion Flag)\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of Uva || Haṇsayâ Maha Kodiya (Swan Flag)\n|-\n|    || - 19th Century || Flag of Sabaragamuwa || Kaha Paṭa Redi Maha Kodiya (Yellow Silk Flag) Muthudal Maha Kodiya (Golden-Pearl Flag)\n|-\n| colspan=4 align=center|Sulu Disavani\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of Matale || Sudu Maha Kodiya (White Flag)\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of the Tun Korales || Bhéruṇḍaya Pakshiya Maha Kodiya (Flag)A Bhéruṇḍa (double headed eagle), a spread eagle\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of Valapane || Mayura Maha Kodiya (Peacock Flag)\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of Udapalata || Neḷum-mal Maha Kodiya (Lotus Flag)\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of Nuvarakalaviya || Gajasiṇha Maha Kodiya (Gajasimha Flag)\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of Vellassa || Kotiyá Maha Kodiya (Tiger/Leopard Flag)\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of Bintanna || Girawá Maha Kodiya (Parrot Flag)\n|-\n|  || - 19th Century || Flag of Tamankaduva || Valahá Maha Kodiya (Bear Flag)\n|}\nOther flags\nOther offices of the Kandyan Government also had their own flags as well as hereditary clans and castes.
