But as \"a poet, a gentle satirist and a humorist of the highest order, he achieved notability\" in his short life for a series of newspaper published poems.\nRise to fame\nKing billed himself as \"Ben King, the Sweet Singer of St. Joe\", and first came to prominence for a concert given during the World's Columbian Exposition. Introduced to the Press Club of Chicago, he was quickly picked up by Read, who invited King to tour with him, reading his poetry with piano accompaniment.\nDeath\nKing died of an undisclosed illness while on a speaking tour at Bowling Green, Kentucky, April 8, 1894. As he had become a favorite of the Press Club of Chicago, that organization published a posthumous collection of his works titled ''Ben King's Verse'' in 1894, comparing him with Thomas Hood, a then-famous English humorist and poet. For the next quarter century, the book reputedly outsold any other single volume of verses in Michigan.\nKing was buried in the St. Joseph City, Michigan Cemetery.  A monument later erected in Lake Bluff Park, Berrien County, Michigan in 1924 features a bronze bust of King created by Chicago sculptor Leonard Crunelle. On the granite monument base are lines from his poem \"The River St. Joe\":\nWhere the bumblebee sips and the clover's in bloom,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;and the zephyr's come laden with peachblow perfume.\nWhere the thistle-down pauses in search of the rose\n&nbsp;&nbsp;and the myrtle and woodbine and wild ivy grows;\nOh, give me the spot that I once used to know\n&nbsp;&nbsp;by the side of the placid old River St. Joe!\nPersonal life\nHe was married November 27, 1883 to Aseneth Belle Latham, of St. Joseph, Michigan, and the couple had two children, Bennett Latham King and Spencer P. King, aged nine and five, respectively, at the time of his death.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://theotherpages.org/poems/poem-kl.html#bking Index entry for Ben King at Poets' Corner]"
