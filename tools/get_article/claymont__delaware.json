As of the 2020 U.S. census, the population of Claymont was 9,895.\nHistory\nThe community now known as Claymont started on the banks of Naamans Creek where it empties into the Delaware River. This once rich ecosystem has been occupied steadily since before 1200 A.D. and has undergone numerous cultural and economic changes, most of which are still evident in the architecture and living patterns of the community today. The first residents were aboriginal Indians of the Middle Woodland period (1100-1600 B.C.). Evidence of these early dwellers has been found along both sides of Naamans Creek.\nThe Dutch colonists named the creek and settlement after the Chief of the Lenape Indians who occupied the region. The settlement grew rapidly from the 17th century through the 20th century, first with gristmills, farms, and related ancillary industries, and later with lumber mills, a steel mill, and a chemical plant.\nIn 1681, John Grubb purchased a one-third interest in a  tract of the Brandywine Hundred, which came to be known as Grubb's Landing.\nSitting strategically along the Delaware River, Claymont has been a two-way thoroughfare for travel to and from Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., since colonial days.\nDuring the colonial period, the town served as a stop along the King's Highway or Philadelphia Pike. The town became a site for intersections and connections with Interstate 95, Interstate 495, US 13 (Governor Printz Boulevard), and US 13 Bus. Philadelphia Pike has long been a thoroughfare for travel between Philadelphia (20 miles to the north) and Washington, D.C. (100 miles to the south).\nIn 1838, the newly constructed Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad built a station in Claymont.

Clemson, pastor of the Episcopal church, relocated here with his family from their plantation, Claymont Court, in Charles Town, West Virginia.\nClaymont, with its diverse population, has continued to maintain a strong sense of community.

In 2017, plans were announced for the redevelopment of the former 450-acre Claymont Steel site.
