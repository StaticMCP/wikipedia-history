King and Urban Prep have received international attention for the fact that since the school's first graduating class in 2010, 100% of its graduates have been accepted into a four-year college or university.\nPersonal life\nKing was born in Chicago, attended St. Ignatius College Prep and completed his bachelors and Juris Doctor degrees at Georgetown University. While at the Georgetown University Law Center, King became involved working as a teacher at a nearby Catholic high school, and eventually he determined to pursue teaching as a full-time career. King is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. In 2010, he was named one of People Magazine′s Heroes of the Year. He holds doctoral degrees honoris causa from Adler University and Dominican University.\nProfessional career\nAfter completing law school, King was named President of Hales Franciscan High School in Chicago, an all-male, predominately African-American school on the city's South Side. While at Hales, King appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, an interview in which Oprah characterized him as an \"Angel\". During King's five-year tenure as President of Hales, 100 percent of the school's graduates were admitted to college.\nTwo years after departing Hales, King founded a network of all-male public high schools, Urban Prep Academies, in order to address Chicago’s woefully low rate of college graduation for black males. Under King's leadership, Urban Prep Academies received charters from the Chicago Board of Education to open three high schools in neighborhoods throughout the city. For his work with Urban Prep Academies, King is recognized as a national leader on education reform. In addition to his management of Urban Prep, King has taught courses on the subjects of urban education and philanthropy at Northwestern University, written for the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, The Chronicle of Higher Education, ''Crain's Chicago Business, Huffington Post, and The New York Times and lectured to groups across the United States.

The honor was given to coincide with the school's announcement that 100% of the first graduating class had been accepted to a 4-year college or university.
