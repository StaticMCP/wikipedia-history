Burbridge's expedition against Saltville, Union General George Stoneman reassembled a force to destroy the saltworks there.  Stoneman's force included Burbridge's Division and a brigade under Brigadier General Alvan C. Gillem.\nAfter defeating a Confederate force at Marion, Virginia on the December 17–18, Stoneman's expedition advanced to Saltville.  General John C. Breckinridge had 500 men at Saltville under Colonel Robert Preston.  Another brigade of cavalry was en route under General Basil W. Duke.  General Gillem led the Union advance and attacked first.  Burbridge joined the fight shortly after and the two Federal columns overwhelmed the town's defenses.  Colonel Preston ordered a retreat, and Stoneman's troops entered the town and destroyed the saltworks, accomplishing the objective of the Union raid.\nBattlefield preservation\nThe Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved  of the Saltville battlefields.\nGallery\nSaltville_II_Battlefield_Virginia.jpg|Map of battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program.\nSee also\n*Saltville Battlefields Historic District\n*First Battle of Saltville\n*Salt in the American Civil War\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070714074550/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/va082.htm CWSAC Saltville]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108221650/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/VirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/Sailors%20Creek%20to%20Saltville%20II.pdf CWSAC Report Update]\nExternal links\n*[http://thomaslegion.net/thebattlesofsaltville.html Battles of Saltville]"
