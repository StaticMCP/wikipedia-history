He reinstated Raimal Rathore as the Rao of Idar and defeated the Gujarat forces under the command of Nizam Khan. Rana Sanga drove the army of Muzaffar II deep into Gujarat and chased them up to Ahmedabad. The Sultan of Gujarat was forced to flee to Muhammadabad. After a series of successful military campaigns Sanga successfully captured Northern Gujarat.\nBackground\nThe growing power of Mewar was seen as a threat by the Sultan of Gujarat. They had previously had disputes due to the succession of the state of Idar. In 1519 the two claimants of Idar, Raimal and Bharmal both sought the support of Sanga and Muzaffar II, leading to the invasion of Idar by the Gujarat forces, who were supporting Bharmal.\nBattle\nUpon knowing of the invasion, Rana Sanga immediately came to the support of Raimal Rathore and started with 40,000 cavalry from Chittorgarh. He first went towards Sirohi whose ruler paid necessary tribute to the Maharana. When Sultan of Gujarat came to know about the developments happened above. He tried to send reinforcements but he was stopped by his nobles who were anxious of Mubariz-ul-Mulk, then holding Idar for Gujarat Sultanate. Next, Maharana's army reached Dungarpur whose ruler also accompanied him. Mubariz-ul-Mulk wrote letter to Sultan asking for counterattack and also informing him about the present situation. However, nobles mis-interpreted the fact and stopped Sultan from taking necessary action. Then a battle was fought in Idar where the Sultans forces were defeated by the Maharana. Idar was captured and forces of Marwar and Vagad under their respective Kings Rao Ganga Rathore and Biramdeva Medatiya with 7000 and 6,000 cavalry each joined him. Gujarat army were pushed back as far as Ahmedabad which was put to siege and looted. Mewari army plundered and captured Vadnagar and also attacked Visalnagar which also submitted to Maharana.\nAftermath\nThe north of Gujarat was successfully absorbed into the Kingdom of Mewar after the invasion. This defeat led to the alliance between the sultanates of Gujarat, Malwa and Delhi against Mewar. The two Sultans of Malwa and Gujarat led their forces to Mandsaur where they failed to take the fort and were forced to retreat. The sultan of Delhi tried to annex Ajmer but was defeated at Ranthambore by Sanga.\nReferences"
