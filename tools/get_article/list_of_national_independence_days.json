Many countries commemorate their independence from a colonial empire.\nNot all countries mark independence as a national holiday. Many, such as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, New Zealand, Ireland, Luxembourg, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, and Turkey mark other dates of significance.\nList\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+List of independence days of countries around the world\n!Country\n!Name of holiday\n!Date of holiday\n!Year of event\n!Independence from\n!class=unsortable|Event commemorated and notes\n|- id=A\n|rowspan=2|\n|Independence Day\n|\n|1919\n|\n|Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 or Treaty of Rawalpindi, an armistice between the United Kingdom and Afghanistan during the Third Anglo-Afghan War.\n|-\n|Liberation Day\n|\n|1989\n|\n|Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n|-\n|\n|Independence Day\n|\n|1912\n|\n|Albanian Declaration of Independence.
