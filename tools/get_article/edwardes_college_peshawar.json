The college, affiliated with the University of Peshawar, has about 3,000 students in Sciences, Arts and Humanities, Business Administration, Higher National Diploma, and Computer Sciences.\nThe college's undergraduate and graduate degree programs lead to the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.), 4 year BS Programme in English and Computer Science, Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) and 5 years LLB degrees awarded through the University of Peshawar Edwardes also offers an A-Level program and the Faculty of Arts (F.A.) and Faculty of Science (F.Sc.) certificates through the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Higher National Diploma (H.N.D.) BS English program in business and information technology offers the option of a third year in an institution in the U.K., U.S.A. or Australia.\nOriginally a co-educational college, it became a boys-only college in the 1930s. Edwardes has become co-educational again since 2000 with about 200 female students and 15 women among its faculty members, with the number of women anticipated to increase. The college has a vital community life, which includes freedom of worship for all faiths, sporting events, a debating society, drama productions, and student publications. Up to 1974 the institution was run by as organisation affiliated with the Church Mission Society. However, following Nationalisation Reforms of 1974 it was handed over to the Board of Governors headed by NWFP Governor. A ruling of the Peshawar High Court dated 14 November 2019 dismissed the plea of the Principal  challenging the nationalisation of the college.\nHistory\nafter whom college was named.]]\nThe Church Missionary Society established the Church Mission College in 1900 as an outgrowth of Edwardes High School, which had been founded in 1855 by the society as the first institution of western-style schooling in the northwest frontier region of what was British India. For many years the college was the only institution of higher education in the northwest frontier. Sir Herbert Edwardes was a British colonial administrator and commander whose name the college later adopted.\nThe first major college building, now known as the Old Hall, was built in 1910 in a Moghul style that was replicated in a number of the college's later buildings. Edwardes College was visited three times by the founder of the nation, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, by Mahatma Gandhi, and the previous Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. In its early years Edwardes awarded degrees through the University of Punjab; since 1952 its degrees have been awarded through the University of Peshawar.\nHostel\nEdwardes has hostel accommodation for about 200 male students.\nThe main hostel is composed of four halls;\n1.
