It is the largest community in King township, with 2,730 dwellings and a population of 8,396 as of the 2021 Canadian census.\nHistory\nIn 1836, a settlement styled Springhill was established in King. With the arrival of the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron railway in 1853, the settlement began to expand. In 1890, the reeve of King township (James Whiting Crossley) incorporated King City by merging the hamlets of Springhill, Kinghorn, Laskay, and Eversley.\nGeography\nKing City is characterized by rolling hills and clustered temperate forests in the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests ecoregion. Numerous kettle lakes and ponds dot the area. Creeks and streams from King City, the surrounding area, and as far west as Bolton and as far east as Stouffville are the origin for the East Humber River.\nSituated entirely on the southern slope of the central portion of the Oak Ridges Moraine and its watershed, numerous disputes about planning and development have occurred municipally, such as installation of a sewerage system connecting the community to the Durham-York Sewage System in the 2000s.\nNumerous stables and other farms have been established on the  of land area occupied by the township.\nEcology\nEastern Hemlock foliage and cone\nThe provincially significant King-Vaughan Wetland Complex consists of 23 individual wetlands (83% swamp, 17% marsh). It is composed of clay, loam and silt soils on a site that is palustrine (69%) or isolated (31%). Vegetation found on this wetland includes tall shrubs (34%), deciduous trees (28%), dead trees and shrubs (19%), and narrow-leaved emergents (12%); additionally, robust emergents and free-floating plants are found in small agglomerations.\nKing Forest is a 60-hectare forest with steep valleys containing the narrow flood plain of the East Humber River. The valley walls are of dry-mesic nature, supporting Eastern White Cedar, Eastern Hemlock and Sugar Maple. It is a regenerating forest containing 85 ground-cover species. The flood plain consists primarily of Eastern White Cedar, Sugar Maple and some White Ash, though 26 species do thrive in the area.\nThe King City Wetland Complex contains eight wetlands (77% swamp, 23% marsh) over 49 hectares. It is a palustrine formation  composed 70% of clay, loam or silt soils, and 30% organic soils. It has varied vegetation, including tall shrubs (40%), deciduous trees (37%), robust emergents (14%), narrow-leaved emergents (4%) and submergent vegetation (4%).\nAlso, the King-Vaughan Forest straddles King City and portions of Vaughan. It is similar to the King Forest, composed of forest areas on steep valley walls containing the flood plain of the Humber River. The dominant species on the valley walls are Sugar Maple and Eastern Hemlock, which are strongly regenerative in the forest. On the flood plain, a greater variety of species may be observed. Immature stands of Manitoba Maple and Eastern White Cedar, poplars and American Elm can be found here, as can an extensive Hawthorn scrubland.\nClimate\nKing City has a continental climate moderated by the Great Lakes and influenced by warm, moist air masses from the south, and cold, dry air from the north. The Oak Ridges Moraine affects levels of precipitation: as an air mass arrives from Lake Ontario and reaches the elevated ground surface of the moraine, it rises causing precipitation.\n|date=February 2012\n}}\nPolitics\nKing City does not have its own municipal government; it is represented municipally on King Township council by two councillors, in Wards 1 and 5. Ward 1 covers King City east of Keele Street, and includes the communities of Eversley, Snowball and Temperanceville. Ward 5 includes the western part of King City to Highway 400.\nSewage system\nKing City was historically served by septic systems. In 2001, York Region took away control of planning for King Township's sewage collection system. The Township's council at the time opposed the installation of a sewage system in King City, and brought the issue to court. Changes to the Regional Municipalities Act in 2001 resulted in regional control of sewer and water systems by regional government. The municipal government has authority to plan and manage the local collection system. The 2003 municipal elections resulted in a council favourable to installation of a sewage system in the town and its connection to the York-Durham Sewage System. The Township subsequently applied for project provincial and federal construction grants.\nProponents of the link cited health concerns about the septic systems in the community, and the occasional spill, as reasons to link to the Durham-York system. Opponents stated that the health issues of the septic systems were embellished, and that the link would result in poorly controlled growth in the community, and hence urban sprawl.\nThe King City Sanitary Servicing Project began construction in early 2005, jointly funded by King Township and York Region. A by-law was passed in April 2005 that made it mandatory for residents to connect to the new sewer system. Installation of the near $50 million project was funded through tax receipts, which included system linkage for public facilities such as municipal offices and the library. This cost included only the provision of a sewerage connection at the property line. In addition, homeowners are required to install piping from the home to the sewerage connection at their expense. Decommissioning and infilling septic tanks is also mandatory.\nInstallation of the wastewater system was followed by numerous applications for development of residential subdivisions. By 2012, there were at least eight subdivision developments under construction and two expansions within King City, which are expected to add 690 detached houses, 299 townhouses, and a 134-unit four-storey condominium complex, as well as expanding the York Region Seniors Housing centre by 40 units.\nTraffic\nThrough traffic on King Road has become a concern in the past decade, as the number of heavy vehicles has increased significantly. Notably, dump trucks serving new subdivision construction sites in nearby Oak Ridges use King Road to reach Highway 400. Delivery trucks destined for Aurora and Richmond Hill also make use of King Road as a bypass.\nThe Township borders on Peel Region, which has promoted the extension of Highway 427 from its current terminus at Highway 7 north to the Bradford Bypass. This extension would border the Township, raising concerns about noise pollution in the rural area.\nLifestyle and culture\nCulture\nKing City has been a filming location for at least ten movies/TV shows:\n* The CBC TV show, The Forest Rangers, had some scenes filmed on Mary Lake near the shrine.\n* The 1972 film, ''Mahoney's Estate, used the downtown section of King City in a major scene\n* The 1972 Canadian TV show, Almost Home, used the downtown as well.\n* The 1976 movie, Death Weekend, was filmed mainly at Eaton Hall.\n* The Gate (1987) was filmed and set at a house located in King Heights subdivision\n* To Die For (1995) had a number of scenes filmed at King City Secondary School.\n* Golden Will: The Silken Laumann Story'' (1996, TV) was entirely filmed in King City.\n* Walt Disney's Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004) also had some scenes filmed during a three-day period in July 2003 at King City Secondary School.\n* A History of Violence (2005) had its final scene filmed at the historic Eaton Hall in King City, and a baseball scene filmed in Pottageville.\n* Billy Madison (1995) had some scenes filmed at the gates to Mary Lake Shrine just north of King City.\nKing City is also the location of Shift an outdoor sculpture by Richard Serra built between 1970 and 1972. The sculpture was commissioned by Roger Davidson, and is being considered for protection under the Ontario Heritage Act by the Township of King Heritage Committee. The work is located on land just south of the village, for which the township has received development proposals by its owner Great Gulf Group.\nEducation\nThe Seneca College King Campus is located in King City; it is the only post-secondary education facility in King Township, and one of its major employers.\nLike the rest of Ontario, King City has access to two public education systems: the regional boards are the York Catholic District School Board and the York Region District School Board.\nKing City Secondary School is a public school that serves students from all King Township.

Protestants make up 41%\nof the population, whereas Roman Catholics represent 39% of residents. Both of these religions outnumber the remaining faiths in practice within King City, namely those who identify themselves as Christian Orthodox (1%), Muslim (0.5%), Jewish (0.5%), Hindu (0.5%), or Sikh (0.5%). Approximately 17% of the population has no religious affiliation.\nKing City is home to five churches and a shrine:\n* Sacred Heart Church is a Roman Catholic institution.\n* King City United Church is affiliated with the United Church of Canada, which is the largest Protestant-denominated church in Canada.\n* St. Andrews Presbyterian Church operates within the Presbyterian Church of Canada, another Protestant-denominated church.\n* All Saints, King City is an Anglican church affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada, the third major Protestant-denominated religious branch in Canada.\n* King Bible Church is affiliated with the Associated Gospel Churches of Canada.\n* The Shrine of Our Lady of Grace is a Marian shrine at Mary Lake, an Augustinian Monastery located on the northern edge of King City; it is also referred to as Mary Lake Shrine.\nRecreation\nThe King City Community Centre and King City Arena host numerous activities, such as youth hockey league matches and yoga classes. They also host many community events throughout the year, and some public King Township meetings.\nLeagues for girls and boys hockey, tennis, soccer, and baseball exist, and a number of clubs provide other avenues for kids to enjoy and learn.\nKing City Memorial Park, next to the arena, has two baseball fields, several soccer fields, two children's playgrounds, and four tennis courts (two with lighting). An open, covered area is used for public events and picnics.\nA portion of the extensive Oak Ridges Trail passes through King City. The community is creating its own trail network, the King City Trail; the two networks are currently not connected.\nPrivate recreation facilities include St. Edmunds Sparkling Cricket Club cricket facility operated by the Maple Leaf Cricket Club, and two golf clubs: King's Riding Golf Club and King Valley Golf Club.\nResidents are within a ten-minute commute to recreation in other communities.
