The awards are administered by Women in Film and Television New Zealand, the national chapter of Women in Film and Television International, and have been awarded since 2004.\nThe awards were initially made in four categories; additional categories have been added and as of 2022 the awards are made in 11 categories. The awards were also initially presented annually and are now presented biennially. No awards were made in 2012.\nNominations are invited from the public. A panel selects finalists in each category, who are invited to an awards ceremony in Auckland where the recipients are announced.\nAward ceremonies and recipients\n2022\nThe awards ceremony was held on 8 July at ASB Waterfront Theatre, Auckland.
