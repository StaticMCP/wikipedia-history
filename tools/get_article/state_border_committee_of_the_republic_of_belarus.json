Its armed paramilitary force is known as the Border Guard Service, carrying out committee orders and policy.  The primary tasks of the State Border Committee include: border policy and enhancing border security.\nThe service covers the borders with Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.\nHistory\nThe State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus traces its history back to the troops that oversaw the border with the German Empire in 1918 and the formal creation of the Soviet Border Troops in the same year.\nIn 1939, a border with Germany was established, but the previous Polish-Soviet border was not liquidated. Upon the German invasion of the Soviet Union, approximately 16,000 of the 20,000 border troops became casualties in the first days of the war. The service was essentially recreated from scratch in 1944.\nOn September 20, 1991, the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus passed legislation subordinating the border troops to itself, effectively creating a national service. Most of the legislation governing the service was adopted by August 1993. From 1994 to 1997, the first border units were formed and deployed, and agreements were made with neighboring countries to facilitate cooperation between their respective border troops. On January 11, 1997, President Alexander Lukashenko signed a decree renaming the General Directorate to the State Committee of the Border Troops.\nOn September 18, 2020, the committee announced it had tightened border security with Poland and Lithuania, calling up reserves to patrol the borders although Poland and Lithuania said their borders with Belarus remained open.\nAfter the start of the Belarus–EU border crisis, the leadership of the State Border Committee, including its chairman Lappo, was included in the sanctions lists of the European Union, the United States and Canada on December 2, 2021. Switzerland joined the EU sanctions on December 20.\nStructure\nThe Border Service of Belarus controls 11 territorial units, the Border Guard Institute, and a Military Hospital:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Unit\n!Founded\n!Notes\n|-\n|Brest Border Group\n|1944\n|Named after Felix Dzerzhinsky\n|-\n|Lida Border Group\n|1997\n|\n|-\n|Smorgon Border Group\n|1992\n|\n|-\n|Grodno Border Group\n|1944\n|\n|-\n|Gomel Border Group\n|1997\n|\n|-\n|Pinsk Border Detachment\n|1993\n|\n|-\n|Polotsk Border Detachment\n|1992\n|\n|-\n|Mozyr Border Detachment\n|2014\n|\n|-\n|Border Control Detachment \"Minsk\"\n|1945\n|It serves Minsk National Airport\n|-\n|Logistics Support Group\n|1938\n|\n|-\n|Communications and Support Group\n|2014\n|\n|-\n|Border Guard Service Institute\n|1993\n|\n|-\n|Border Guard Military Hospital\n|1994\n|\n|}\nLeadership\nChairmen\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Chief of the General Directorate of Border Troops\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Leader\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Rank\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term of office\n|-\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n|Evgeny Bocharov\n|Stanislav Shushkevich\nAlexander Lukashenko\n|Lieutenant general\n|February 19, 1992\n|August 30, 1994\n|-\n|Vasily Morkovkin\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Alexander Lukashenko\n||Major general\n|September 26, 1994\n|September 4, 1996\n|-\n|Alexander Pavlovsky\n|Lieutenant general\n|September 4, 1996\n|January 13, 1997\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Chairman of the State Committee of the Border Troops\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Leader\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Rank\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term of office\n|-\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n|Alexander Pavlovsky\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Alexander Lukashenko\n|Lieutenant general\n|January 13, 1997\n|April 10, 2007\n|-\n|Igor Rachkovsky\n|Major general\n|April 10, 2007\n|September 27, 2007\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Chairman of the State Border Committee\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Leader\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Rank\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term of office\n|-\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n|Igor Rachkovsky\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Alexander Lukashenko\n|Major general\n|September 27, 2007\n|July 31, 2012\n|-\n|Alexander Boechko\n|Colonel\n|August 2, 2012\n|November 2, 2013\n|-\n|Leonid Maltsev\n|Colonel general\n|November 2, 2013\n|December 27, 2016\n|-\n|Anatoly Lappo\n|Lieutenant general\n|December 29, 2016\n|May 30, 2023\n|-\n|Konstantin Molostov\n|Major general\n|May 30, 2023\n|Incumbent\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;text-align:left;font-size:80%\"|Source: State Border Committee of the Republic of Belarus\n|}\nFirst Deputy Chairman\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Rank\n! colspan=\"2\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Notes\n|-\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n|Alexander Popov\n|rowspan=\"4\" |Major general\n|October 31, 1994\n|July 14, 1996\n|Died in the line of duty\n|-\n|Evgeny Kovalev\n|September 24, 1996\n|June 9, 2006\n|\n|-\n|Vadim Zaitsev\n|April 10, 2007\n|July 15, 2008\n|\n|-\n|Andrey Gorulko\n|August 29, 2008\n|August 2, 2012\n|\n|-\n|Alexey Zagorodniy\n|Colonel\n|August 2, 2012\n|April 9, 2013\n|\n|-\n|Igor Butkevich\n|Major general\n|April 12, 2013\n|August 21, 2024\n|\n|-\n|Andrei Filatov\n|Colonel\n|August 21, 2024\n|Incumbent\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Visa policy of Belarus\nReferences"
