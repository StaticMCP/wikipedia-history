It was the parliament of the first parliamentary republic in the Caucasus Region of Central Asia. It parliament was established on December 7, 1918 when Azerbaijan declared independence away from the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. The parliament disbanded in April of 1920 after the Red Army took control of Baku.\nHistory\nAzerbaijani National Council\nOn May 28, 1918, the Azerbaijani Muslim faction of the Transcaucasian Seym declared itself to be the Azerbaijani National Council., the governing body of the new Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.  This was the first parliament in the history of Azerbaijan.  As stated in the Declaration of Independence, \"Until the convening of the Constituent Assembly, Azerbaijan is headed by the National Council elected by the people and the Provisional Government, which is responsible to the National Council.\" On September 17, 1918, three months after the formation of Fatali Khan Khoyski's cabinet, the government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic moved to Baku.  Fatali khan Khoyski began preparations for the convening of the Constituent Assembly. . At his suggestion, the National Council undertook to convene the Constituent Assembly.\nOn November 19, 1918,  the National Council decreed all nationalities in Azerbaijan should be represented in parliament.   At that time, the country had a population of 2,750,000. Of these, 1,900,000 were Azerbaijani Muslims, 500,000 were Armenians, and 230,000 were Russians.\nThe 120 seats in the new parliament were to be apportioned among all the ethnic and political groups.\n* Azerbaijan Muslims - 80\n* Armenians - 21,\n* Russians - 10\nOut of 21 Armenian representatives, eight were to be elected from Ganja, eight from Shusha and five from Baku. The 10 Russian representatives were given to the Russian National Council, -1 to the German National Organization, -1 to the Jewish National Council, 1 to the Georgian Committee and -1 to the Polish Committee. The Council also provided for the sending of three representatives by the Baku Trade Union Council and two representatives by the Baku Industry and Trade. Members of parliament had parliamentary immunity.\nThe Council also decided to include 44 Turkish Muslim representatives elected to the All-Russian Constituent Assembly in late 1917  in the new parliament. The remaining 36 Muslim deputies and representatives of other nationalities had to be re-elected. The formation of the new Parliament was to be completed on December 3, 1918.\nOn November 29, 1918, signed by Rasulzade the application was published. The appeal stated:\nOpening of parliament\n220x220px\nOn December 7, 1918, at one o'clock in the afternoon, the Azerbaijani Parliament opened in the building of Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev's former girls' school on Nikolayev Street . Chairman of the National Council of Azerbaijan Mohammad Amin Rasulzadeh delivered a congratulatory speech.At the suggestion of the Musavat faction, Alimardan bey Topchubashov was elected chairman of the parliament, and Dr. Hasan bey Agayev was elected his first deputy. As Topchubashov was at the Paris Peace Conference,  Agayev headed the activities of the parliament.\nAt the first session of parliament, the resignation of the Khoyski government was accepted and F. Khoisky was called to form a new government. On December 26, 1918, F. Khoisky addressed the parliament with his program and submitted his new government for approval. The parliament adopted the government's program and expressed confidence in the new government.\nRussian and Armenian boycotts\nNone of Russian delegates to Parliament attended the opening session of parliament.  The Baku Russian National Council, controlling the Russian delegates, declared that the Parliament had no moral right to speak on behalf of the Russian population in Azerbaijan. They tried to prove that Azerbaijan had violated the idea of a \"united and indivisible Russia\" in declaring its independence. Allegedly, the participation of the Russian National Council in the Parliament and the Government would mean \"recognition of the fact of separation of Azerbaijan from Russia\", which facilitated the recognition of Azerbaijan in the international arena. However, not all Russians in Azerbaijan supported the Russian boycott of Parliament. The Russian-Slavic Society in Baku appealed to Rasulzade to allow the representatives of this society to \"enter the Parliament\" in order to participate in \"general state-building\" in Azerbaijan.The Armenians delegates boycotted the opening session and other sessions for the next two months. Finally, they decided to participate. They create two factions in parliament - the Armenian and the Dashnaktsutyun. It was said that the Armenians only wanted to use parliament to promote their goal of a Greater Armenia. In the meantime, existence of 11 factions and groups in Parliament created a fractured legislature. For example, the Socialist Bloc of Parliament, under the guise of \"protecting the interests of the poor\", regularly promoted the annexation of Azerbaijan by the Soviet Union.  They later succeeded in opening a diplomatic mission in Moscow, and finally advocated the intervention of the Red Army in Azerbaijan..\nAdoption of laws\nMore than 270 bills were submitted to the parliament, about 230 of which were adopted.\nThere were 11 commissions in the parliament: Finance and Budget, Legislative Proposals, Central Commission for Elections to the Constituent Assembly, Mandate, Military, Agrarian Issues: Commissions on Inquiries, Command and Control on the Use of the Country's Productive Forces, Editorial and Labor Commissions.\nThe activities of the Parliament were governed by a charter specially prepared for this purpose - the \"Instruction (instruction) of the Parliament of Azerbaijan.\"\nRasulzade assessed the activity of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as follows:\nThe end of the Parliament\nOn the night of April 26-27, 1920, units from the  11th Red Army crossed into Azerbaijan and laid siege to Baku. Baku was also besieged by Soviet units from the Caspian Sea. The next morning, armed groups of communists seized important facilities both inside and outside the city.\nA delegation of communists acting on behalf of the Soviets issued an ultimatum to hand over power to the Azerbaijani Parliament.  This delegation represented the Central Committee of the Azerbaijani Communist (Bolshevik) Party and Baku bureau of the Caucasus Committee of the Russian Communist (Bolsheviks). Mammad Hasan Hajinski, who had close ties with the Azerbaijani Bolsheviks, held talks with the Communists.\nThe ultimatum and the results of the commission's negotiations were discussed at the final session of parliament chaired by Mammad Yusif Jafarov. The meeting started at 20.45 on April 27 and lasted until 23.25. During the session, Rasulzade asked to open  the doors of the Parliament to the general public.  In his speech, Rasulzadeh said:\nHajinski told parliament that if they did not transfer power to the communists tonight, the local communist party would call in the Red  Army. The Communists also warned that all the political parties would be banned.  Hajinski also said that the Communists refused to consider any proposals from parliament and warned the members about the consequences.. At the end of his speech, Hajinski called on the members of Parliament to make the only right decision in the current situation \"for the salvation of the nation\".\nSamad agha Agamalioglu, Gara bey Garabeyov, Aslan bey Safikurdski, Rasulzade and Sultanmajid Ganizade expressed their support for the transfer of power to the Communists only under certain conditions. The Parliament decided by a majority vote to hand over power on the following terms:\n* The full independence of Azerbaijan, ruled by the Soviet government, is preserved;\n* The government formed by the Communist Party of Azerbaijan will be a temporary body;\n* The final form of government of Azerbaijan shall be determined by the supreme legislative body of Azerbaijan in the person of the Soviets of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies, independent of any external pressure;\n* All government employees remain in office, but those in positions of responsibility are replaced;\n* The newly formed Provisional Communist Government guarantees the inviolability of the life and property of members of Parliament and Government;\n* Measures will be taken to prevent the Red Army from entering Baku by battle;\n* The new government will take decisive measures at its disposal against all foreign forces seeking to undermine Azerbaijan's independence, no matter where it takes place.\nElections\nIs the stenographic record of the Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan reports that the elections will be hidden and Muslim Majlis-Məbusana the parliament members, in addition to the 44 people who are part of the National Council elected 36 new members.  The proportion of members to be involved was as follows:\nFrom the Armenian minority population - 21 members: 8 from Ganja Armenian Population Committee, 8 from Shusha Armenian Population Committee, 5 from Baku Armenian Population Committee;\n* - from the Russian population from the Russian National Council in Baku - 10;\n* - Organizational-nationality of the German population - 1;\n* - Jewish National Council - 1;\n* - from the Georgian committee - 1;\n* - from the Polish Committee - 1;\n* - Baku Trade Union Council - 3;\n* - Jointly with Baku Soviet Congress and Trade and Industrial Societies - 2.\nGovernments of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic\nFirst cabinet: 28 May 1918 – 17 June 1918\n* The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Interior - Fatali khan Khoyski (neutral).\n* Military Minister - Khosrov Pasha bey Sultanov (Musavat).\n* Minister of Foreign Affairs - Mammadhasan Hajinski (Musavat).\n* Minister of Finance and Public Education - Nasib bey Yusifbeyli (Musavat).\n* Minister of Justice - Khalil bey Khasmammadov (Musavat).\n* Minister of Trade and Industry - Mammad Yusif Jafarov (neutral, then - Musavat).\n* Minister of Agriculture and Labor - Akbar aga Sheikhulislamov (Hummat).\n* Minister of Roads, Post and Telegraph - Khudadat bey Malik-Aslanov (neutral).\n* State Inspector - Jamo bey Hajinski (socialist).\nSecond cabinet: 17 June 1918 – 07 December 1918\n* Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Justice - Fatali khan Khoyski (neutral).\n* Minister of Foreign Affairs - Mammadhasan Hajinski (Musavat).\n* Minister of Public Education and Religious Affairs - Nasib bey Yusifbeyli (Musavat).\n* Minister of Internal Affairs - Behbud khan Javanshir (neutral).\n* Minister of Agriculture - Khosrov Pasha bey Sultanov (Musavat).\n* Minister of Health and Social Welfare - Khudadat bey Rafibeyli (neutral).\n* Minister of Roads - Khudadat bey Malik-Aslanov (neutral).\n* Minister of Trade and Industry, Minister of Food - Aga Ashurov (neutral).\n* Minister of Finance - Abdulali bey Amirjanov (neutral).\n* Minister without portfolio - Alimardan bey Topchubashov (neutral).\n* Minister without portfolio - Musa bey Rafiyev (Musavat).\n* Minister without portfolio - Khalil bey Khasmammadov (Musavat).\nCabinet changes 6 June 1918\n* Chairman of the Council of Ministers - Fatali khan Khoyski (neutral).\n* Minister of Trade, Industry and Internal Affairs - Behbud khan Javanshir (neutral).\n* Minister of Foreign Affairs - Alimardan bey Topchubashov (neutral).\n* Minister of Finance - Mammadhasan Hajinski (Musavat).\n* Minister of Public Education - Nasib bey Yusifbeyli (Musavat).\n* Minister of Roads - Khalil bey Khasmammadov (neutral).\n* Minister of Agriculture - Khosrov Pasha bey Sultanov (Musavat).\n* Minister of Public Health - Khudadat bey Rafibeyli (neutral).\n* Minister of Post and Telegraph - Aga Ashurov (neutral).\n* Minister of Social Security and Religious Affairs - Musa bey Rafiyev (Musavat).\n* Commissioner for Military Affairs - Ismail khan Ziyadkhanov (neutral).\n* State Inspector - Abdulali bey Amirjanov (neutral).\nThird Cabinet: 26 December 1918 – 14 March 1919\n* Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs - Fatali khan Khoyski (neutral).\n* Minister of Internal Affairs - Khalil bey Khasmammadov (Musavat).\n* Minister of Finance - I.
