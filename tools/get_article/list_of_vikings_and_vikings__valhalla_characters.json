      "text": "# List of Vikings and Vikings: Valhalla characters\n\nVikings is a historical drama television series written and created by Michael Hirst for the television channel History. Filmed in Ireland, it premiered on 3 March 2013 in Canada, concluding on December 30, 2020. A standalone sequel series, Vikings: Valhalla, written and created by Jeb Stuart for Netflix, premiered on February 25, 2022, concluding on July 11, 2024.\nVikings is inspired by the sagas of Viking Ragnar Lothbrok, one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of England and France, while Vikings: Valhalla, set 100 years later, chronicles the beginning of the end of the Viking Age and the adventures of Leif Erikson, his sister Freydís Eiríksdóttir and Harald Sigurdsson. The broad historical narrative of both series are based on real events, with some of the principal characters representing real figures from history and/or legend.\nVikings portrays Ragnar as a former farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes king, with the support of his family and fellow warriors: his brother Rollo, his son Björn Ironside, and his wives—the shieldmaiden Lagertha and the princess Aslaug. Vikings: Valhalla portrays Leif and Freydís as immigrants from Greenland to Norway, who are respectively pulled into the Viking campaign to conquer Great Britain and the growing religious divide between Christians and Pagans. The Seer (portrayed by John Kavanagh) is the only character to appear in both series, having appeared in at least one episode of every season.\nMain characters\nThe following is a list of series regulars who have appeared in one or more of the six seasons of Vikings or the three seasons of Vikings: Valhalla.

Harald's men beg Bjorn for help, and Bjorn repays his debt. When Olaf tries to have Bjorn elected as over-king of Norway, Harald defeats Bjorn in the election, but Harald's men fail to kill Bjorn. Olaf refuses to recognise Harald, so Harald has him put away and sends warriors to secure his borders.\nBased on the historical Harald Fairhair.\nHalfdan the Black\n* Played by Jasper Pääkkönen (seasons 4–6)\nHarald's violent younger brother. He hates Christians and tries to kill as many as possible. He grows tired of living in his brother's shadow and of Harald's war with other Norsemen, and joins Bjorn's expedition to the Mediterranean.
