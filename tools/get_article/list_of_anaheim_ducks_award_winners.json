Twenty All-Star Games have been held since the Ducks entered the league in 1993, with at least one player chosen to represent the Ducks in each year except 2004. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 when it was replaced by the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off.\nScott Niedermayer was selected to play in three NHL All-Star games with the Ducks.\n* Selected by fan vote\n* Selected as one of four \"last men in\" by fan vote\n* All-Star Game Most Valuable Player\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Anaheim Ducks players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Game\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 45th\n|1994\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 46th\n|1996\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| 47th\n|rowspan=\"3\" |1997\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 48th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1998\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 49th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1999\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 50th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2000\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 51st\n|2001\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 52nd\n|2002\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 53rd\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2003\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 54th\n|2004\n|No Ducks selected\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 55th\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2007\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 56th\n|rowspan=\"4\" |2008\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 57th\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2009\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 58th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2011\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 59th\n|2012\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 60th\n|2015\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 61st\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2016\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 62nd\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2017\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 63rd\n|2018\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 64th\n|2019\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 65th\n|2020\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 66th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2022\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|#\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 67th\n|2023\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 68th\n|2024\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nCareer achievements\nHockey Hall of Fame\nHockey Hall of Famer Jari Kurri played one season with Anaheim.\nThe following is a list of Anaheim Ducks who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Anaheim Ducks inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame\n! scope=\"col\" |Individual\n! scope=\"col\" |Category\n! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted\n! scope=\"col\" |Years with Ducks in category\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2015\n|2003–2005\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2017\n|1995–2003\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2001\n|1996–1997\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2013\n|2005–2010\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2012\n|2002–2003\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2015\n|2006–2009\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2017\n|1996–2001, 2005–2014\n|\n|}\nLester Patrick Trophy\nThe Lester Patrick Trophy has been presented by the National Hockey League and USA Hockey since 1966 to honor a recipient's contribution to ice hockey in the United States.
