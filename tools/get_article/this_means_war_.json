It was released in 1987.\nIn this album, the band started to refine their movement into a more hard rock/arena rock sound, still retaining keyboard synthesizers to back the driving guitar work. This album also signaled the beginning of a military motif present in the song lyrics that the band would carry through several of their following albums.\nTrack listing\n| length2         = 4:06\n| title3          = Get on Your Knees and Fight Like a Man\n| writer3         =\n| length3         = 4:33\n| title4          = I Am Available\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 4:27\n| title5          = Kenaniah\n| writer5         =\n| note5           = lyrics: Bob Hartman, Danny Kingen, and John Lawry\n| length5         = 3:44\n| title6          = You Are My Rock\n| writer6         =\n| length6         = 4:20\n| title7          = The Water Is Alive\n| writer7         =\n| length7         = 3:48\n| title8          = Don't Let Your Heart Be Hardened\n| writer8         =\n| length8         = 3:43\n| title9          = Dead Reckoning\n| writer9         =\n| length9         = 3:24\n| title10         = All the King's Horses\n| writer10        =\n| length10        = 4:16\n| total_length    = 39:56\n}}\nAwards\n* Nominated for Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance in 1987.\n* Won the Netherlands's Contemporary Christian album of the year in 1988.\nPersonnel\nPetra\n* Bob Hartman – lead guitars, additional programming, arrangements\n* John Schlitt – lead vocals, background vocals\n* John Lawry – keyboards, computer programming, background vocals\n* Mark Kelly – bass guitar, background vocals\n* Louie Weaver – drums, additional programming\nAdditional musicians\n* John Elefante – additional programming, background vocals, arrangements\n* Tim Heintz – additional programming\n* Dino Elefante – arrangements\n* Tom Hrbacek and Los Alamitos High School Marching Drummers – percussion on \"This Means War\"\nProduction\n* John Elefante – producer, engineer, mixing at Pakaderm Studio, Los Alamitos, California\n* Dino Elefante – producer, engineer, mixing\n* Mike Mireau – engineer\n* Steve Hall – mastering at Future Disc, Los Angeles\n* Dave Rogers – art direction, design\n* Chris Hopkins – illustration\nReferences"
