As part of the opening ceremonies, there was a celebratory function held on a nearby hill (now within Summerholm) where the Governor's wife Lady Bowen planted a tree, leading to its name Lady Bowen Hill.\nSummer Hill Provisional School opened on 2 September 1889 with 13 students under teacher Miss M. Hanley. On 1 January 1909, it became Summer Hill State School. It was on a  site at 61 Summerholm Road (). In 1911, the school committee wanted to have the school relocated to a more central localition as the population of the district had moved further to the north.

In 1944, it was renamed Summerholm State School. It closed circa 1955. It was at 51 Summerholm Road (), approximately  north of the school's previous location. As at July 2023, the school building is still extant, but has been converted into a house.\nDemographics\nIn the , Summerholm had a population of 639 people.\nIn the , Summerholm had a population of 646 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Summerholm.
