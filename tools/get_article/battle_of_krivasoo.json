It is considered one of the last engagements of the conflict before a ceasefire was called in early January 1920.\nFighting around Krivasoo began in the wake of the retreat of the Northwestern Army after it failed to take the city of Petrograd. The 7th and 15th Soviet Armies, advancing behind collapsing White Russian forces, began their attack as they approached the fortified positions at the state border near Narva. The first clashes took place on Luga River on 16 November, starting the conclusive battles with 120,000 Soviets facing 40,000 Estonians. After repeated attacks, the 7th Red Army managed to achieve some limited success. At the end of November, the situation on the front calmed, as the Soviets needed to replenish their forces. In order to pressure Estonia in the peace talks, intensive Soviet attacks restarted on 7 December. On 16 December, the situation became critical as forward units of the 15th Red Army crossed the Narva River. The next day, an Estonian counterattack pushed the Soviets back. The Estonian high command actively reinforced the 1st Division at Narva during the battles, sending in the headquarters of the 3rd Division. General Tõnisson became commander of the Viru Front. After suffering 35,000 casualties in heavy battles, the Red Army was completely exhausted by the end of December. By this time, negotiations with Bolshevik representatives brokered a ceasefire between the Red Army and the Estonian forces.\nReferences"
