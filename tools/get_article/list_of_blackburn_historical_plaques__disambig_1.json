Later, Blackburn Local History Society agreed to take on responsibility of managing the local scheme and worked with Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council to add additional plaques as part of a local heritage festival in 2014. A number of the blue plaques have since gone missing, though some have been replaced by granite plaques to make them less appealing to metal thieves.\nThe British Film Institute placed two plaques in Blackburn as part of the Centenary of Cinema celebration in 1996.\nIn addition to these, other plaques have been placed that do not belong to any organised scheme.\nLocations of plaques\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! width=\"14%\"| Subject\n! width=\"10%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n! width=\"26%\"| Location\n! width=\"50%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Plaque text\n|-\n| Plug Plot Riots\n|\n| BBC Radio Lancashire, Darwen Street, Blackburn\n|\n|-\n|Jack Walker\n|\n|Randal Street, Blackburn Note - The original blue plaque was placed in May 2001, but stolen in February 2014.
