Results with regard to the total vote, the percentage of the vote won and the number of seats allocated to each party are presented in the tables below. On 31 March 1933, the sitting Bürgerschaft was dissolved by the Nazi-controlled central government and reconstituted to reflect the distribution of seats in the national Reichstag. The Bürgerschaft subsequently was formally abolished as a result of the \"Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich\" of 30 January 1934 which replaced the German federal system with a unitary state.\n1919\nThe 1919 Bremen state election was held on 9 March 1919 to elect the 200 members of the Bremen National Assembly.\n}}\n1920\nThe 1920 Bremen state election was held on 6 June 1920 to elect the 120 members of the Bürgerschaft.\n}}\n1921\nThe 1921 Bremen state election was held on 20 February 1921 to elect the 120 members of the Bürgerschaft.\n}}\n1923\nThe 1923 Bremen state election was held on 18 November 1923 to elect the 120 members of the Bürgerschaft.\n}}\n1924\nThe 1924 Bremen state election was held on 7 December 1924 to elect the 120 members of the Bürgerschaft.\n}}\n1927\nThe 1927 Bremen state election was held on 13 November 1927 to elect the 120 members of the Bürgerschaft.\n}}\n1930\nThe 1930 Bremen state election was held on 30 November 1930 to elect the 80 members of the Bürgerschaft.\n}}\nReferences"
