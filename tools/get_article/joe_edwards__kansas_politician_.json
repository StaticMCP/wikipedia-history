He faced no opposition in the primary election and won the general election with 49% of the vote (defeating both Democrat Sammy Flaherty, with 19% of the vote, and independent candidate Daniel Thimesch, with 32%).\nIn the 2014 primary, Edwards lost to challenger John R. Whitmer. He died before his term expired, and Whitmer was appointed to replace him.\nReferences"
