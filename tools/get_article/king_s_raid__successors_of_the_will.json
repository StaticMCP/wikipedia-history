It is produced by Sunrise Beyond and aired from October 2020 to March 2021.\nPlot\nA hundred years ago, King Kyle defeated the Demon King Angmund, leading to an age of peace for the kingdom of Orberia. Now, the fate of the apprentice knight Kasel takes a turn when word arrives of demons appearing in his region. Klaus, a fellow trainee who is like his older brother, goes off to investigate and never returns. The Great Sage Dominicus sends Kasel, along with a team of trusted allies, to find his friend and to seek out a sealed holy sword that can save the land.\nCharacters\n;Riheet\n:|Zeno Robinson}}\n: A dark elf belonging to the mercenary faction \"Black Edge\". He gets hired by Councilor Moriham of Orvelia to investigate demonic activity near the royal city, but he and the Black Edge are secretly plotting to betray him and take control of Orbellia as revenge for the discrimination dark elves have endured.\n: When the Black Edge are sent to investigate Gallua Plains in search for demonic activity, the whole squad except for Riheet are killed by the dark wizard Malduk, causing Riheet to end his allegiance to the Orvelian army and, on the advice of Maria, to search for the magic sword created by Illya, King Kyle's half-sister. He later discovers that he is a distant descendant from Illya and that she never created a fake sword, but rather, a techno-magical device that would protect its wielder from the Dark Lord's power and she was villainized in death by corrupt nobles as discrimination against dark elves.\n: Realizing that he has nothing left to lose, he joins Scarlet in her fight to obtain the holy sword Eia and kill Malduk, a goal he barely achieves after reaching the World Tree. During the final battle with Angmund, Riheet gives the device created by Illya to Kasel, who barely manages to defeat Angmund and save his father. With the Dark Lord defeated, Scarlet offers a title of nobility to Riheet, who instead requests to reveal the truth about Illya to his fellow dark elves, hoping to promote true peace between them and Orvelia.\n;Ripine\n:\n: Riheet's younger sister and second-in-command of the \"Black Edge\". Utterly devoted to her brother's, Ripine will do whatever it takes to help him achieve his goals, even if that means killing members of her own group. She barely survives a direct confrontation against Malduk and only reunites with her brother after Angmund's forces have been defeated.\n;Kasel\n:\n:A recruit training to become a Guardian-Knight of Orvelia. Despite his lack of discipline, he is determined to protect the people he cares about. Upon hearing that his friend Kasel was last seen fighting demons in the King's forest, he rushes out to save him. His journey leads him to Dominicus, who reveals that Kasel is the son of the legendary King Kyle and the only one who can stop the resurrection of the Dark Lord Angmund by finding the Eia, the sword that defeated Angmund a hundred years ago.\n: As time passes, Kasel becomes capable of using the holy power manifested by Eia, but this power causes Kasel to doubt his own ability to protect the people he cares about. He considers completing his journey alone in a well-intentioned attempt to protect his friends, but Frey convinces him to let his friends join him.\n: Although he is shocked by the revelation that his father has become Angmund's physical vessel, Kasel becomes committed to save him. During the final battle, he obtains both Eia and a pendant created by Illya and combines them both to save his father, allowing his soul to rest in peace. With the crisis over, Kasel finally becomes an official Guardian-Knight but instead of remaining stationed on Orvelia, he chooses to go on another journey with his friends.\n;Frey\n:\n: A priestess for the Holy Church of Orvelia. She knows Kasel and Clause since childhood and has come to care deeply for them. Upon learning that Kasel might die in his fight against the Dark Lord, Frey begins fearing for his life and it isn't until Kasel himself comforts her that she truly decides to stay by his side. During the final battle with Angmund, Frey finally admits she is in love with Kasel, a motivation that allows Kasel to defeat the Dark Lord. With the battle over, she once again chooses to accompany Kasel and his friends on another adventure.\n;Cleo\n:\n: A young sorceress specializing in fire magic, trained by Dominicus. She has been described as having a lot of potential but lacking discipline. Her magic improves significantly throughout her journey, and she gets advice from various people to continue to support her friends in any way she can. Once Angmund is defeated, she once again chooses to join Kasel in another adventure.\n;Roi\n:\n: Formerly a member of the mercenary group \"Flugel\", Roi was the sole survivor when his teammates were turned into undead. He was rescued by Dominicus, who allowed him to stay at the Tower of the Sage in exchange for Roi extended his services to Dominicus later.

With the defeat of Angmund, he again chooses to join Kasel on another adventure.\n;Clause\n:\n: A veteran Guardian-Knight of Orvelia. He has known Kasel and Frey since childhood. He is presumed missing-in-action, prompting Kasel and Frey to attempt to save him.

However, when Kasel's mother was killed by demons, Dominicus would seek out Kasel and reveal his origins to him.\n;Malduk\n:\n: A dark wizard and former servant of the Dark Lord Angmond. He joins forces with Maria to resurrect his master. He used to be a sorcerer for the human kingdom of Grey, but his obsession with necromancy led him to raise the dying king as an undead, an action that caused Malduk to be exiled. Bitter, he pledged allegiance to Angmond and dedicated himself to the Dark Lord's resurrection. In his campaign, he slaughters the entire \"Black Edge\", causing Riheet, the lone survivor, to swear vengeance against him. He later attempts to steal the holy sword Eia from the World tree, only to be killed by Riheet.\n;Kyle\n:\n: The legendary king who saved the world from the Dark Lord Angmund a hundred years before the events of the series. He was the younger adoptive brother of the dark elf Illya and wielder of the holy sword Eia, granted to him by Lua, goddess of light, as the only weapon that could destroy Angmund. However, during his fight with Angmund, the Holy Sword lost its power and Angmund corrupted Kyle's mind and took control of his body to resurrect himself a hundred years later. To ensure the survival of his bloodline, Dominicus cast a spell that placed Kyle's wife in a deep sleep. When she awakened, she gave birth to Kyle's only child, Kasel.\n: Angmund is later restored to life using Kyle's body and attempts to kill Kasel, who uses both Eia and a techno-magical device created by Illya to destroy Angmund's armor and free his father. Kyle reveals that his own power was insufficient to destroy Angmund, which is why he begged Lua, the goddess of light, to give Eia to his son, hoping that he would succeed where Kyle himself failed. Kyle's soul departs for the afterlife, but not before expressing love for his son.\n;Maria\n:\n: A former saintist dedicated to the worship of Lua, the goddess of light. She had known Kyle since he was a prince and supported the efforts of Illya to create magical equipment that would protect Kyle from the Dark Lord's power. Unfortunately, during the Battle of Gallua Plains, Kyle was corrupted by the Dark Lord's power and trapped in the same dimensional rift the Dark Lord was, while Illya was killed by demons while trying to help Kyle. Believing that the goddess Lua had abandoned her friends in their time of greatest need, Maria renounced her loyalty to Lua and became devoted to Leia, the goddess of darkness. Once Kyle is resurrected as the holder of the Dark Lord's soul, however, Maria begins conspiring against the Angmund and helping Kasel in the very slim hope of saving Kyle. During the final battle, she buys enough time for Kasel to use Eia and the pendant created by Illya to destroy Angmund's armor and save his father. In Kyle's final moments, she realizes that Kyle willingly sacrificed his life to protect Eia and pass it on to his son, hoping that Kasel would succeed where Kyle failed. After Kyle dies, Maria leaves for parts unknown, taking all her sins with her.\n;Scarlet\n:\n: Princess of Orvelia and commander-in-chief of Orvelia's Guardian-Knights. She formally requests assistance from the Black Edge to fight the demon army threatening Orvelia and attempts to establish a good relationship with the Black Edge's leader, Riheet. She is horrified upon learning that Orvelia secret oppressed dark elfkind and that, as revenge, Riheet wanted to take over Orvelia and oppress its citizens as retribution.\n: Choosing to atone for her kingdom's sins, she asks for Riheet's help in finding the holy sword Eia and safeguarding it from the Dark Lord. After Angmund is defeated, Scarlet offers Riheet a title of nobility, a decision that Riheet puts on hold, as he embarks on his own attempt to promote peace between Orvelia and dark elves.\n;Demia\n:\n: An elite Guardian-Knight of Orvelia.

With the Dark Lord finally defeated, Lorraine continues her watch over the forest of Elladora, with Pavel at her side.\n;Selene\n:\n: Princess of the elves and a talented archer. She distrusts humans but is forced to allow Kasel and his friends across her forest to reach her master, Lorraine.

With the night of the Dark Lord's return fast approaching, Pavel brings Kasel's group to the World Tree, the holiest place in the planet, so they can awaken the Holy Sword Eia.\nMeanwhile, Malduk and Maria begin their ritual to summon the Dark Lord back into the realm of the living, only to find that their spell has summoned Kyle instead.\n| LineColor           = 800080\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Maria initially believes that Kyle was summoned from the dimensional rift Angmund was trapped it, only for Kyle to reveal himself to Angmund in disguise.\nMeanwhile, Scarlet and Riheet reach the Tower of the Sage. While Riheet investigates Illya's laboratory, Dominicus reveals to Scarlett that Kasel and his friends are searching for the Holy Sword Eia and that Kasel is the biological son of King Kyle, hidden from the rest of the world to ensure the survival of Kyle's bloodline should Kyle himself fall in battle. Riheet searches for the fake Holy Sword created by Illya, only to discover that no such sword exists. Illya was, in fact, working on special equipment that would protect its intended wearer, Kyle, from the Dark Lord's magic. When Illya died, however, the nobility of Orvelia branded her a heretic and made up the story of Illya creating a sword as an insult to the goddess Lua to remove Kyle's bloodline and seize power for themselves. Dominicus confirms the story and admits he tried to reveal the truth, but nobody was convinced. Even the dark elves, who were exiled because of the false accusations thrown at Illya, became convinced that she was guilty. Riheet also discovers that he himself is a descendant of Illya and that his pendant is the finished version of the protective equipment Illya had been working on her whole life. Realizing he has nothing left to lose, Riheet agrees to help Scarlet find Kasel.\n| LineColor           = 800080\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Pavel guides Kasel and his friends back to the forest of Elladora as part of the path towards the World Tree.

Lorraine and Selene find the injured Pavel and attempt to nurse back to health using the life force of the forest, while Kasel informs them that Angmund has been resurrected. Maria attempts to speak to Kasel about Kyle, but Lorraine informs Kasel and his friends that Maria used to be a saintist devoted to the worship of Lua, until some undisclosed event caused her to worship Leia, the goddess of darkness, instead.\n| LineColor           = 800080\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Maria tells Kasel and his friends about her old life as a saintist and a friend of Kyle. She knew him back when he was a prince and was there when she met Arlette, Kasel's mother. She was initially a devoted servant of the goddess Lua and supported the efforts of Illya to create magical equipment that would protect Kyle from the Dark Lord's power. Unfortunately, during the Battle of Gallua Plains, Kyle was corrupted by the Dark Lord's power and trapped in the same dimensional rift the Dark Lord was, while Illya was killed by demons while trying to help Kyle. Believing that the goddess Lua had abandoned her friends in their time of greatest need, Maria renounced her loyalty to Lua and became devoted to Leia, the goddess of darkness.\nMaria departs from the forest of Elladora, but not before revealing that Kyle has become a vessel for the Dark Lord's soul, which means that Kasel might have to kill his own father to save the world. However, Kasel believes he can save his father from darkness. Pavel recovers from his injuries but admits that, in his current state, he won't be able to reach the World Tree, forcing him to undo the final seal on the Holy Sword. The group, with Selene joining them, departs to the World Tree.\n| LineColor           = 800080\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = As Scarlet prepares to travel to the World Tree, she writes a letter to chancellor Behl about what happened during the expedition to Gallua Plains.

Malduk attempts to take Eia from Riheet, but Scarlet distract Malduk long enough for Riheet to decapitate him. Unfortunately, Angmund takes Eia from Riheet, just as Kasel and his friends arrive at the World Tree.\n| LineColor           = 800080\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = The final battle begins as Kasel and his friends separate Angmund from Eia. Unfortunately, Eia was actually restraining Angmund's power and without the holy sword, Angmund can fully unleash his power on the heroes. Kasel barely grabs Eia, just in time for Riheet to give him the pendant created by Illya. The pendant creates an armor that protects Kasel from Angmund's dark power and with the full power of Eia, Kasel frees Kyle from Angmund's armor and allows his soul to depart to the afterlife.\nWith the battle over, demonic activity has decreased significantly. Scarlet offers Riheet a noble title as an attempt to promote peaceful relations between Orvelia and the dark elves, but Riheet requests some time before he can make his decision. He first needs to educate his fellow dark elves about Illya's actions, hoping that, in time, this will improve relations between Orvelia and the dark elves. Before leaving Orvelia, however, he gives the pendant to Kasel.\nAs Riheet reunites with Ripine, who barely survived Malduk's attack, Kasel and Frey reunite with Cleo and Roi, ready to begin another adventure together.\n| LineColor           = 800080\n}}\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.anime-kings-raid.com/ Anime Official website]"
