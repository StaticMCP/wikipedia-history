The elections may be held earlier under exceptional circumstances if the presidency falls vacant before then. The incumbent president, Emmanuel Macron, is term-limited and cannot seek a third consecutive term in office. However, he has hinted the possibility of running in the 2032 elections, which would make him eligible.\nElectoral system\nThe president of the French Republic is elected to a five-year term under the two-round system as stipulated in Article 7 of the French Constitution. If no candidate secures an absolute majority (50% + 1) of votes in the first round, including blank and void ballots, a second round is held two weeks later between the two candidates who received the most votes. Per the constitution, the first round of the presidential election must be held between 20 and 35 days before the conclusion of the president's current five-year term. Emmanuel Macron's second term, which began on 14 May 2022, is scheduled to end on 13 May 2027, meaning that the first round of the presidential election is scheduled to be held between 8 and 23 April 2027.\nTo be listed on the first-round ballot, candidates must secure 500 signatures (often referred to as ) from national or local elected officials from at least 30 different departments or overseas collectivities, with no more than a tenth of these signatories from any single department. According to the Article 6 of the French constitution, the president cannot \"exercise more than two consecutive periods in office\".\nDeclared candidates\nHorizons\n* Édouard Philippe, Prime Minister of France (2017–2020); Mayor of Le Havre (2010–2017; 2020–present); Deputy for Seine-Maritime's 7th constituency (2012–2017)\nÉdouard Philippe à Châlons-en-Champagne en 2023.
