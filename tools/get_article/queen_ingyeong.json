She was given the names, and was known as Kim Ok-hye () or Kim Jin-ok (김진옥; 金盡玉).\nHer father was Kim Man-gi and her mother was member of the Cheongju Han clan. Kim Jang-saeng was her great-great grandfather and Kim Jib was her great-granduncle through her father. She was a second cousin twice removed of Queen Inseon as well as a second cousin once removed of Queen Hyosun.\nShe was married at the age of 9 to Hyeonjong's only son, Crown Prince Myeongbo, entitling her as crown princess consort (왕세자빈, wangsejabin). With her husband, they were also 4th cousins as they shared King Seonjo as their great-great-great-grandfather.

In 1679, the Queen gave birth to another daughter but she died prematurely a day later. In the summer of 1680, she had been pregnant, but due to an incident she had a miscarriage.\nOn 8 December 1680, age 19, she showed signs of smallpox and later died on December 16 in Gyeongdeok Palace (now known as Gyeonghui Palace).
