Scholars frequently render the name as Hann to clearly distinguish it from China's later Han dynasty. It was located in central China (modern-day Shanxi and Henan) in a region south and east of Luoyang, the capital of the Eastern Zhou. It was ruled by aristocrats of the Ji (姬) family ancestral temple who rose to power as a ministerial family in the state of Jin, and whose power eventually eclipsed that of the Jin ruling house. The partition of Jin which resulted in the states of Han, Wei, and Zhao, marked the beginning of the Warring States period.\nThe state of Han was small and located in a mountainous and unprofitable region. Its territory directly blocked the passage of the state of Qin into the North China Plain.. Although Han had attempted to reform its governance (notably under Chancellor Shen Buhai who improved state administration and strengthened its military ability) these reforms were not enough to defend itself and it was the first of the seven warring states to be conquered by Qin in 230 BC.\nA Qin invasion of Han's Shangdang Commandery in 260 BC resulted in the Battle of Changping, claimed to be the bloodiest battle of the Warring States period where up to 400,000 soldiers died.\nHistory\nFounding\nAccording to chapter 45 of the Records of the Grand Historian, the royal family of Han was a cadet branch of the royal family of the state of Jin. The founder of the Han clan Wuzi of Han was the uncle of Duke Wu of Jin.\nMembers of the family became ministers in the powerful state of Jin and were granted Hanyuan (modern Hancheng in Shaanxi).\nSpring and Autumn period\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period, members of the Han family slowly gained more and more influence and power within Jin. In 453 BC, Jing of Han, along with Wen of Wei and Lie of Zhao partitioned Jin among themselves. In Chinese history, this Partition of Jin is the event which marks the end of the Spring and Autumn period and the beginning of the Warring States. Subsequently, Han was an independent polity. King Weilie eventually recognized the new states in 403 BC and elevated the rulers to }} (hou, \"marquess\").\nWarring States Period\nIn 375 Han defeated the neighboring state of Zheng (founded in 806 by the Zhou dynasty). Han conquered and annexed Zheng, thus expanding its territory. Han also moved its capital there, and assimilated Zheng's heritage. This included that of the young politician Shen Buhai (400-337).\nHan's highest point occurred under the rule of Marquess Xi. Xi appointed Shen Buhai as his chancellor and implemented his Legalist policies. These reforms improved state administration and strengthened its military capability. Under King Xuanhui ( 332–312 BC), Han declared itself an independent kingdom.\nHowever, Han was disadvantaged in the competition of the Warring States period because Jin's partition had left it surrounded on all sides by strong states: Chu to the south, Qi to the east, Qin to the west, and Wei to the north. Han was then the smallest of the seven states and was without any easy way to further expand its own territory and resources, It was bullied militarily by its more powerful neighbors.\nDefeat\nDuring its steady decline, Han eventually lost the power to defend its territory and had to request military assistance from other states. The contest between Wei and Qi over control of Han resulted in the Battle of Maling, which established Qi as the pre-eminent state in the east. In 260 BC, Qin's invasion of Han led to Zhao intervention and the Battle of Changping.\nDuring the late years of the era, in an attempt to drain Qin's resources in an expensive public works project, the state of Han sent the civil engineer Zheng Guo to Qin to persuade them to build a canal. The scheme, while expensive, backfired spectacularly when it was eventually completed: the irrigation abilities of the new Zhengguo Canal far outweighed its cost and gave Qin the agricultural and economic means to dominate the other six states. Han was the first to fall, in 230 BC.\nIn 226 BC, former nobility of the Han launched a failed rebellion in former capital Xinzheng, and King An, the last king of Han, was put to death the same year.\nHan Xin was made a \"Prince\" or \"King of Han\" () by Liu Bang after the establishment of the Han dynasty (). He was removed to Taiyuan Commandery and the territory of the kingdom of Dai, where he defected to the Xiongnu and led raids against the Han Dynasty until his death.\nCulture and society\nBefore the state of Qin unified China in 221 BC, each region had their own unique customs and culture, although they were all dominated by an upper class that shared a largely common culture. In the Yu Gong (Tribute of Yu), a section of the Book of Documents which was most likely composed in the 4th century BC, the author describes a China that is divided into nine regions, each with its own distinctive peoples and products. The core theme of this section is that these nine regions are unified into one state by the travels of the eponymous sage-emperor, Yu the Great, and by sending each region's unique goods to the capital as tribute. Other texts also discussed these regional variations in culture and physical environments.\nOne of these texts was Wuzi (The Book of Master Wu) which was a Warring States military treatise written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the other states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were linked to the physical environment and territory they live in.\nIn the Han Feizi\nChapter 19 of the Han Feizi recalls Qin's conquest of Ye from the Zhao, dated to 236bc. The chapter says: \"To-day, Han, being a small state, is relying upon big powers. Her sovereign, paying little attention to the law, takes every word from Qin. The above-mentioned small states, having relied upon Wey, Ch`i, Ching, and Wu for support, went to ruin one after another. Thus reliance on others is not sufficient to extend the native soil.\" Seemingly written from the context of the late Han state, the chapter might have preceded its fall in 230bc, or either Zhao and Wei if the latter had only yet ceded territory.\nRulers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=180 | Title\n! width=180 | Name\n! width=180 | Reign\n! width=180 | Alternative Title(s)\n|- align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Pre-State sovereigns\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Wuzi韓武子\n| Hán Wàn韓萬\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Qiubo韓賕伯\n| unknown\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Dingbo韓定伯\n| Hán Jiǎn韓簡\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Ziyu韓子輿\n| Hán Yú韓輿\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Xianzi韓獻子\n| Hán Jué韓厥\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Xuanzi韓宣子\n| Hán Qǐ韓起\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Zhenzi韓貞子\n| Hán Xū韓須\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Jianzi韓簡子\n| Hán Bùxìn韓不信\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Zhuangzi韓莊子\n| Hán Gēng韓庚\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Kangzi韓康子\n| Hán Hǔ韓虎\n|\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Wuzi韓武子\n| Hán Qǐzhāng韓啓章\n| 424 BC – 409 BC\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |State sovereigns\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Marquess Jing韓景侯\n| Hán Qián韓虔\n| 408 BC – 400 BC\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Marquess Lie韓烈侯\n| Hán Qǔ韓取\n| 399 BC – 387 BC\n| Marquess Wu ()\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Marquess Wen韓文侯\n| unknown\n| 386 BC – 377 BC\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Marquess Ai韓哀侯\n| unknown\n| 376 BC – 374 BC\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Marquess Gong韓共侯\n| Hán Ruòshān韓若山\n| 374 BC – 363 BC\n| Marquess Zhuang ()Marquess Yi ()\n|- align=\"center\"\n| Marquess Xi韓厘侯\n| Hán Wǔ韓武\n| 362 BC – 333 BC\n| Marquess Zhao ()\n|- align=\"center\"\n| King Xuanhui韓宣惠王\n| unknown\n| 332 BC – 312 BC\n| King Xuan ()Marquess Wei (), before 323 BC\n|- align=\"center\"\n| King Xiang韓襄王\n| Jì Cāng姬倉\n| 311 BC – 296 BC\n| King Xiang'ai ()King Daoxiang ()\n|- align=\"center\"\n| King Xi韓釐王\n| Hán Jiù韓咎\n| 295 BC – 273 BC\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| King Huanhui韓桓惠王\n| unknown\n| 272 BC – 239 BC\n|\n|- align=\"center\"\n| King An 韓王安\n| Hán Ān韓安\n| 238 BC – 230 BC\n|\n|}\nRulers family tree\nFamous people\n* Han Fei, a Legalist philosopher\n* Zhang Liang, a major figure in the early Han dynasty\n* Zheng Guo, the hydraulic engineer who designed the Zhengguo Canal for Qin\nHan in astronomy\nHan is represented by the star 35 Capricorni in the \"Twelve States\" asterism, part of the \"Girl\" lunar mansion in the \"Black Turtle\" symbol.
