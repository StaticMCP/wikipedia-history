If two members of parliament have been in office for the same length of time, age is decisive. Before a change to the standing rules in 2017, the position was held by the oldest member. He or she shall preside over the Bundestag, whenever the whole Presidium of the Bundestag (president and vice presidents) is vacant or incapacitated. This is usually the case during the opening session of each legislative term, over which the President by right of age presides until a President of the Bundestag has been elected and accepted the election. For this purpose, he is authorized to appoint temporary secretaries, who remain in office until the election of regular secretaries in a later session. Apart from the opening session, he or she shall also preside over the Bundestag at any given time, if both the President and all Vice Presidents are incapable of attending. This has only happened once so far: On 18 April 1958 President of the Bundestag Eugen Gerstenmaier had to give up the chairmanship of the session without one of the Vice Presidents being present at the time. Kurt Pohle, the fifteenth oldest and oldest member present at the time, took over the chairmanship for a short time until Vice President Carlo Schmid arrived and replaced him.\nAhead of the 2017 election, with the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany likely to enter Bundestag, the party's Lower Saxony state list included Wilhelm von Gottberg, who would have become the president by right of age due to being the oldest member. However, due to his Holocaust denial comments, the rules were changed to prevent him from serving in the role, so that instead it would be held by the longest-serving member.\nIt is common practice for the President by right of age to give the first speech of the new legislative period, in which he outlines what he considers to be important tasks for Parliament in the coming years.\nThere have been cases in which the longest-serving or oldest MP has declined to hold the position: Konrad Adenauer, for example, who was the oldest member of the Bundestag for many years, set the precedent of a sitting chancellor renouncing the dignity. In this case, according to standing rules, he is replaced by the MP who has served the second longest time (previously: the next oldest).\nList of Presidents by right of age of the Bundestag\nThe office of President by right of age exists on a case-by-case basis. De jure, it is not held permanently by a specific person, but its holder is determined ad hoc. The following overview shows those Members of the Bundestag who, at a given point in the Bundestag's history, were or would have been entitled to claim the dignity in case of need, if present at the time. If another Member had to assume this function in a specific case, this is explained in the notes column.\n{|class=\"wikitable col9left\" style=\"text-align:center;border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n!#\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!Member of the Bundestag(since 2017)\n!Term of office\n!Time in office\n!Parliamentary Group\n!Legislative periods\n!Notes\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:; color:white;\" | 1\n| 80px\n| Paul Löbe(1875–1967)\n|\n| 7 September 1949–7 September 1953\n|\n| SPD\n| 1st\n| Coincidentally, the last President of the Reichstag (Weimar Republic) before Nazi rule.\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:; color:white;\" | 2\n| 80px\n| Konrad Adenauer(1876–1967)\n|\n| 6 October 1953–19 April 1967\n|\n| CDU/CSU\n| 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th\n| During the 2nd, 3rd and 4th legislative periods, Adenauer refrained from presiding due to his position as chancellor. In each case, the function was assumed by the next oldest member of parliament present: In the opening sessions of the 2nd and 3rd Bundestag this was Marie Elisabeth Lüders (FDP, 1878–1966); on 18 April 1958, for some minutes, the entire presidium was unavailable to chair the session and Kurt Pohle (SPD, 1899-1961) took over the chair.

Of these, eleven have actually presided over the Bundestag in their capacity as president by right of age, while seven have never had the opportunity to do so. Six times, another Member presided over the Bundestag as a substitute for the oldest/longest-serving member.\nOverall, the president by right of age (or a substitute) has had to preside over the Bundestag a total of 22 times; in 21 cases, this was at the beginning of the opening session of the legislative term when the presidency was still vacant. Only once, the president by right of age had to step in in a later session, when the entire Presidium was unable to attend.\n{|class=wikitable\n|+List of members by number of opening sessions presided over\n!No. of sessions!!3!!2!!1\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Members\n|valign=top|\n* Willy Brandt (10th, 11th, 12th)\n|valign=top|\n* Marie Elisabeth Lüders (2nd, 3rd)\n* Ludwig Erhard (7th, 8th)\n* Otto Schily (15th, 16th)\n* Heinz Riesenhuber (17th, 18th)\n|valign=top|\n* Paul Löbe (1st)\n* Robert Pferdmenges (4th)\n* Konrad Adenauer (5th)\n* William Borm (6th)\n* Herbert Wehner (9th)\n* Stefan Heym (13th)\n* Fred Gebhardt (14th)\n* Hermann Otto Solms (19th)\n* Wolfgang Schäuble (20th)\n* Gregor Gysi (21st)\n|-\n!(1)!!(4)!!(9)\n|}\nOne member presided during a session within the legislative term due to the incapacitation of the entire Presidium:\n* Kurt Pohle (3rd; 18 April 1958)\nSee also\n* Father of the House\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btgo_1980/BJNR012380980.html Standing rules of the German Bundestag]"
