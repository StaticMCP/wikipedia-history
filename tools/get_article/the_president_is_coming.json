In the end only two are left Kapil and Maya. Kapil is caught cheating in the final round and Maya is selected. However, with a bizarre turn of events she is not the one who shakes the hand.\nCast\n*Konkona Sen Sharma as Maya Roy\n*Shernaz Patel as Samantha Patel\n*Shivani Tanksale as Ritu Johnson\n*Anand Tiwari as Kapil Dev\n*Namit Das as Ramesh S.\n*Vivek Gomber as Rohit Seth\n*Satchit Puranik as Ajay Karlekar\n*Ira Dubey as Archana Kapoor\n*Imran Rasheed as Mohammed Aslam (Security guard)\n*Manish Acharya\n*Faezeh Jalali as Nun\nSoundtrack\nGoldspot did the soundtrack, featuring the songs \"Paper Boats\", \"Under the House\", and \"Haath Mein Le Lenge\".

Recommended for the multiplex junta.\" The Times of India gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, concluding, \"The film has a raw look and lacks finesse when it comes to production values. But there is a delightful tongue-in-cheek tenor running through it, which makes you overlook the unpolished feel and the loose editing.\" Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN described it as \"... an enjoyable film that pushes the boundaries of conventional storytelling. Don't miss this film or you'll regret it.\"\nAdarsh stated, \"Director Kunaal Roy Kapur knows what he's talking and for a first-timer, makes a remarkable debut.\" Nikhat Kazmi from The Times of India wrote, \"Performance-wise, it's the uptight and complex-ridden Ms. Konkona who walks away with laurels and laughs even as the film takes a healthy snigger at the desi self.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
