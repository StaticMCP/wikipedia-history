Additionally, 10 SWS provides surveillance, tracking and space object identification for the United States Space Command Space Surveillance Network (SSN).\nHistory\nThe unit was originally the acquisition radar portion of the United States' only operational anti-ballistic missile system, known as SAFEGUARD. Due to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT II), components of the SAFEGUARD complex, with the exception of the PARCS radar at Cavalier Space Force Station, were deactivated in February 1976.\nThe forerunner of the present day 10th SWS began passing tactical warning and attack assessment data to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colo., in January 1977. In December 1979 the unit was transferred from Aerospace Defense Command to Strategic Air Command.\nThe unit, as it exists today, joined Air Force Space Command in 1983 as Detachment 5, 1st Space Wing. On 10 July 1986, the unit was re-designated as the 10th Missile Warning Squadron, and was activated on 1 August 1986. It was renamed the 10th Space Warning Squadron on May 15, 1992, when the 1st Space Wing and 3d Space Support Wing were inactivated and the 21st Space Wing was activated. On 24 July 2020, with the establishment of Space Delta 4, the 21st Space Wing and all of its subordinates were fully integrated into the United States Space Force.\nPrevious Designations\n*10th Space Warning Squadron (15 May 1992–Present)\n*10th Missile Warning Squadron (10 July 1986 – 15 May 1992)\n*Detachment 5, 1st Space Wing (1983-10 July 1986)\nAssignments\nMajor Command\n*Space Operations Command (24 July 2020-Present)\n*Air Force Space Command (10 July 1983–24 July 2020)\n*Strategic Air Command (1979–1983)\n*Aerospace Defense Command (??-1979)\nNumbered Air Force\n*14th Air Force (??-24 July 2020)\nWing/Group\n*Mission Delta 4 (24 July 2020-Present)\n*21st Space Wing (15 May 1992–24 July 2020)\n*1st Space Wing (1983-15 May 1992)\nList of commanders\n*Lt Col Donald T.
