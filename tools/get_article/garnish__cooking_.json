In many cases, it may give added or contrasting flavor.  Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart. This is in contrast to a condiment, a prepared sauce added to another food item primarily for its flavor. A food item which is served with garnish may be described as being garni, the French term for \"garnished.\"\nThe difference between garnish and decoration, is garnish is edible.  For example, plastic grass for sushi presentation is considered a decoration, not a garnish.\nOverview\nA garnish makes food or drink items more visually appealing. They may, for example, enhance their color, such as when paprika is sprinkled on a salmon salad. They may provide a color contrast, for example when chives are sprinkled on potatoes. They may make a cocktail more visually appealing, such as when a Mai Tai is topped with any number of tropical fruit pieces. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an entrée could be topped with a sauce, as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.\nA garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish. Examples include a banana split sundae with cherries on top or buffalo wings served with celery stick garnish and blue cheese dressing.\nList of garnishes\nFoods and entree\nGarnishes for foods and entrees include:\nused as garnish for the vegan Penne]]\n* Amandine – a culinary term indicating a garnish of almonds\n* Bawang goreng – crisp fried shallot, a common garnish in Indonesian cuisine\n*Carrot\n* Caviar\n* Sun dried tomato\n* Celery\n* Chives\n* Chili pepper – julienne, rings or decoratively sliced\n** Chili threads\n* Cilantro – coriander leaves\n* Crouton\n* Cucumber – julienne, rings or decoratively sliced\n* Duxelles\n* Egg garnish\n* Fried onion – used as a garnish on steaks and other foods\n* Gremolata\n* Lemon basil\n* Radish\n* Manchette\n* Microgreens – young vegetable greens that are used both as a visual and flavor component, ingredient and garnish\n* Mint\n* Nuts\n* Ginger\n* Parsley\n* Persillade\n* Sautéed mushrooms – used on steaks and other foods\n* Edible seaweed – such as shredded nori sheet, used to garnish foods such as soups, entrees and sashimi\n* Sesame seeds\n* Walnut\nDesserts and sweets\nGarnishes for desserts and sweets include:\n]]\n* Caramel\n* Chocolate (shaved or curled)\n* Cocoa powder\n* Flaked coconut\n*\n*\n*  (raspberry coulis, for example)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Nuts\n** Walnut pieces and candied walnuts\n* Wedding cake topper\n* Whipped cream\nBeverages\nGarnishes for beverages include:\n]]\nCoffee-based drinks may have:\n* Cinnamon sticks or ground powder\n* Cocoa powder\nSavory drinks such as Bloody Mary may have:\n* Carrot sticks\n* Celery stalks (usually with leaves attached)\n* Pepper\n* Salt, coarse (applied to the rim of glasses)\nEggnog may have:\n*Nutmeg, grated\nVarious fruits are used:\n* Cherries\n* Lemon slice, twist, or wedge\n* Lime slice, twist, or wedge\n* Orange slice, twist, or wedge\n* Pineapple slice or wedge\n*\n*  wedge\n*\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n** Sugar, granulated or powdered\nGarnishes according to cuisine traditions\nFrench garnishes\nClassic French garnishes include\nFor soups:\ns]]\n* Brunoise  – one to three mm diced vegetables\n* Chiffonade – finely shredded lettuce or sorrel stewed in butter\n* Croutes – small pieces of halved French bread buttered and oven dried\n* Coulis – (a thicker soup) drizzled decoratively\n* Croutons – small pieces of bread (typically cubes) fried in butter or other oil\n* Julienne – thinly sliced vegetables\n* Pasta (tapioca, sago, salep) etc.\n* Pluches – a whole leaf spray of herbs, without the central stalk (traditionally chervil)\n* Profiterolles – puff pastry stuffed with purée\n* Royale – a small decoratively shaped piece of egg custard (in German this is called an Eierstich)\n* Threaded eggs\nFor relevés and entrées:\n* Croquettes\n* Potatoes (pommes dauphine, Duchess potatoes or Marquis)\n* Duxelles – fried onion, mushrooms and herbs\n* Matignon – minced carrots, onions, and celeries with ham stewed in butter and Madeira\n* Mirepoix – similar to Matignon but diced (cf. minced) with or without ham (or with bacon substituted for the ham)\n* Polonaise – Polish-style garnish with melted butter, bread crumbs, chopped boiled egg, lemon juice and herbs over cooked vegetables\n* Salpicon – a variety of other diced meats or vegetables\n* Fritters\nIndonesian garnishes\nrice cone, garnished with decoratively sliced chili pepper and cucumber.]]\n* Bawang goreng – crisp fried shallot, a common garnish in Indonesian cuisine\n* Young carrot leaf\n* Celery – locally known as daun seledri used as topping for soups or rice congee\n* Chili pepper – sliced decoratively\n* Cilantro\n* Cucumber – sliced decoratively\n* Flaked coconut – grated coconut flesh, usually used in traditional kue sweet dessert snacks;
