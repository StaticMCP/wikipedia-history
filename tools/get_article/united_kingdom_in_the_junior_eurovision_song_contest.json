ITV, a member organisation of the United Kingdom Independent Broadcasting (UKIB) participated from 2003 to . It used a national selection format, broadcasting a show entitled Junior Eurovision Song Contest: The British Final, for its participation at the contests. Its first entry at the 2003 contest was \"My Song For The World\" by Tom Morley, which finished in third place out of sixteen participating entries, achieving a score of one hundred and eighteen points. ITV withdrew from competing after the , but the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) participated in  and  instead. The BBC withdrew from the 2024 contest.\nHistory\nThe United Kingdom is one of the sixteen countries to have made its debut at the inaugural Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2003, which took place on 15 November 2003 at the Forum in Copenhagen, Denmark. Child-singer, Tom Morley, was the first participant to represent the United Kingdom with the song \"My Song For The World\", which finished in third place out of sixteen participating entries, achieving a score of one hundred and eighteen points. Morley and Cory Spedding () sang both for the peace in the world and Joni Fuller () described her feelings. The country's best result at the contest was placing second in 2004 with the song \"The Best is Yet to Come\". The remaining British entrant finished in fourteenth position in 2005.\nIn 2003, the contest was broadcast live on the main channel ITV1, however the broadcaster decided to relegate it and the national final to digital channel ITV2 for the next two years due to poor viewing figures that year, before their complete withdrawal in . A delayed broadcast, consisting of highlights, was aired the following afternoon on the main channel in 2004 and 2005. The inaugural contest, broadcast live on ITV1, averaged 5 million viewers. 1.9 million watched the 2004 contest on delay on ITV1 (221,000 watched the live coverage on ITV2). In 2005, the contest was watched by 700,000 viewers on ITV1 (down 63.16% compared with 2004 viewing figures), with 171,000 watching live on ITV2 (down 22.62% compared with 2004).\nThe  contest originally should have been organised by Carlton Television for ITV in Manchester. In May 2003, it was confirmed that the UK would take part in Copenhagen and host the next edition. ITV then announced in May 2004 that due to financial and scheduling reasons, the contest would in fact not take place in the United Kingdom after all. In August 2004, it was reported that Granada Television, who would have co-produced the show with Carlton, had decided to pull out of the deal claiming that the original allocated budget of  to produce the contest was too small. The EBU reportedly offered a further  of funding to produce the contest, but ITV stated that it would have cost almost  to do so, and they asked the EBU to find a new host broadcaster. It is also thought that another factor to their decision was the previous years' audience ratings for ITV which were below the expected amount.\nRadio broadcasts\nOn 21 November 2013, it was revealed that Edinburgh-based 98.8 Castle FM (a non EBU member) would broadcast the  live to listeners in Scotland. The broadcasting rights had been offered by the EBU to its members, however when no-one in the UK took up the offer, Castle FM – previously known as Leith FM – moved in. The commentators were Ewan Spence and Luke Fisher.\nIt was announced on 16 October 2014 that the  contest would be broadcast on a radio station across the United Kingdom. Five local radio stations broadcast the contest, one in England (103 The Eye, delayed) and Wales (Oystermouth Radio), and three in Scotland (K107 in Kirkcaldy, Radio Six International in Glasgow and Shore Radio in Edinburgh). Cotswold FM, Fun Kids, Oystermouth Radio, Radio Six International and Shore Radio transmitted the  contest live with commentary again provided by Ewan Spence.\nOn 9 November 2016, Radio Six International announced that they would broadcast the  contest live. Ewan Spence, Lisa-Jayne Lewis, Sharleen Wright and Ben Robertson provided the commentary for the radio stations Radio Six International, Fun Kids and 103 The Eye.\nWelsh debut\nThe Welsh broadcaster Sianel Pedwar Cymru (S4C) had shown interest in participating for the UK in , hoping to share the Welsh language with a wider audience. Before the digital switchover, the contest would therefore be a bilingual broadcast that would be broadcast in Wales on analogue, and on S4C Digidol in the rest of the UK. In the end, S4C chose not to broadcast the contest. S4C announced on 9 May 2018 that they would debut at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018 to be held in Minsk, Belarus. However, S4C withdrew from the contest in , citing the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason for their withdrawal, and have not returned to the contest since.\nIt was also reported that Scottish broadcaster BBC Alba had also been in talks with the EBU to enable Scotland to participate in , having previously debuted in Eurovision Choir in . However, on 29 June 2019, BBC Alba announced that they would not debut in 2020.\nUK return\nIn July 2020, it was reported that the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) were considering participation in the upcoming contest in Warsaw. The UK did not appear on the official list of participants as released by the EBU on 8 September 2020. At a Junior Eurovision press event in May 2021, the EBU stated that they were working to bring the United Kingdom back to the contest, possibly for the 2021 edition. However, once again the United Kingdom did not appear on the final list of participants for the 2021 contest which took place in Paris. On 17 December 2021, at a press conference between France Télévisions and the executive supervisor of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest Martin Österdahl, Österdahl stated that he was positive about talks between the European Broadcasting Union and the BBC about a potential return of the UK to the contest in the future. On 11 January 2022, it was speculated that the BBC were looking to return to the contest in 2023, the year marking the 20th anniversary of the first contest.\nOn 25 August 2022, it was confirmed that the United Kingdom would return to the contest in , with the BBC replacing ITV as the country's broadcaster. The BBC internally selected Freya Skye to represent the United Kingdom with the song \"Lose My Head\" after an audition process held by the broadcaster. The British return proved successful, with Skye placing fifth with 146 points, winning the online vote. In 2023, the BBC continued the internal process, selecting girl group Stand Uniqu3 to represent the United Kingdom in Nice, France with the song \"Back To Life\". At the contest, the UK improved on the fifth place position, placing fourth overall with 160 points, the best result for the United Kingdom since 2004.\nSecond withdrawal\nDespite two top-5 placings in  and , on 21 June 2024, the BBC announced that the United Kingdom would withdraw from the  contest. According to an article posted by The Euro Trip Podcast on the same day, a spokesperson from the BBC stated the following, \"We sometimes have to make difficult decisions and the BBC will not participate in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest this year. We would like to thank the artists and creative teams who represented the UK for the last two years.\" It has also been suggested that low viewership of the junior contest in the UK, which moved from BBC One to BBC Two in 2023, could also be a reason that supported the country's withdrawal in 2024.\nParticipation overview\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Table key\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#CCC;\" | 2\n| Second place\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#C96;\" | 3\n| Third place\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+ }}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist\n! scope=\"col\" | Song\n! scope=\"col\" | Language\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Place\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Points\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| Tom Morley\n| \"My Song for the World\"\n| English\n| style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#C96;\" | 3\n| style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#C96;\" | 118\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| Cory Spedding\n| \"The Best Is Yet to Come\"\n| English\n| style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#CCC;\" | 2\n| style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#CCC;\" | 140\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| Joni Fuller\n| \"How Does It Feel?\"\n| English\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 14\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 28\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| Freya Skye\n| \"Lose My Head\"\n| English\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 146\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| Stand Uniqu3\n| \"Back to Life\"\n| English\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 160\n|}\nRelated Involvement\nHeads of delegation\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Head of delegation\n!\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|–\n|Lee Smithurst\n|}}\n|}\nCommentators and spokespersons\nThe contests are broadcast online worldwide through the official Junior Eurovision Song Contest website junioreurovision.tv and YouTube.

From 2013 to 2020, the contest was broadcast by various non-participating radio stations. From 2022, the BBC broadcast the contest simultaneously on CBBC and BBC One, whilst in 2023, the BBC moved the contest to BBC Two in a simultaneous broadcast with CBBC.
