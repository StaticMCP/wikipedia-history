On 1 January 2001, it was amalgamated with the Prince's Life Regiment.\nHistory\nAfter the siege and storming of Copenhagen, on 16 October 1659, King Frederick III honored the regiment with the name \"Queen's Life Regiment\" for the regiment's courage.\nThe regiment was in foreign war service (mostly British) around 1700. It participated in the Great Nordic War and in the 1864 campaign, when it participated with particular energy and contempt for death in the defense of Dybøl on 18 April 1864. It was almost wiped out.\nOn 1 November 1961 the Field Lord's Regiment of Foot was merged into the Queen's Life Regiment.\nOn October 25, 1994 a tank platoon from the regiment's 3rd Tank Squadron/1st Battalion conducted Operation Amanda as part of UNPROFOR.\nStructure\n*  1st battalion (I/DRLR), raised in 1961 and disbanded in 2000.
