Conversions of multi-engine World War II warplanes into business aircraft were popular at the time, and Howard came to prefer Lockheed designs, as he found heavy transports such as the C-47 to be too slow and light bombers such as the Douglas A-26 lacking in interior space.\nWhile the Howard 500 bears a strong resemblance to the Lodestar and Ventura, it is a substantially new design with a completely new fuselage designed from the outset for pressurization, unlike those of its Lockheed forebears. The only major components taken directly from the Lockheeds were the outer wing panels (from surplus Venturas) and undercarriage (from PV-2 Harpoons). Howard purchased wing and fuselage jigs from Lockheed to use as patterns for jigs for the new aircraft, while the wings were designed wet. The pressurization system maintained a differential of  which was greater than any other prop or turboprop executive aircraft on the market at the time and maintained a sea level cabin pressure at up to . The 500 is a luxurious aircraft with a spacious cabin, ample baggage capacity, a large door situated close to the ground for easy entry, and an onboard toilet.\nThe engine chosen was a new, higher-power and lighter-weight version of the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 that had been developed for the Douglas DC-6. Propeller hubs were taken from F4U Corsairs, four-blade propellers and spinners from DC-7s. The Howard 500 could accommodate 10 to 14 passengers with a large window for each. Increased fuel tankage over the PV-2 Ventura gave a maximum range with full reserves of . Maximum cruising speed was  at .\nThe prototype flew in September 1959, and type certification was achieved on February 20, 1963. However, by the mid 1960s, turboprops and business jets with tricycle landing gear were being introduced by major manufacturers; while the Howard 500 compared favorably with these aircraft in terms of speed and range, it was an anachronistic taildragger with piston engines, resulting in limited sales.\nTwenty-two Howard 500s were produced initially, with a further eight being converted from earlier PV-2s to virtually the same standard.\nOperators\nCommercial firms operating the aircraft included: Republic Steel, Green Construction of Indiana, Nello L. Teer Company, KF Airlines, Pacific Petroleums of Canada, Northern Natural Gas Company and U.S. Metal Refining Company.\nSurviving aircraft\nOf the 17 examples built to the full Howard 500 standard, two restored aircraft remained flying in 2019: aircraft registration N500HP (serial number 500-105,) and N500LN, both owned by TP Aero and based in Anoka, Minnesota.\nSpecifications\n|eng1 number=2\n|eng1 name=Pratt & Whitney R-2800-CB17\n|eng1 type=eighteen-cylinder two-row radial engines\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=2500\n|prop blade number=4\n|prop name=Hamilton-Standard 24E60-7037A-50 propellers\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=410\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=at sea level\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=350\n|cruise speed note=at  (econ.cruise)\n|stall speed mph=103\n|never exceed speed mph=450\n|range km=\n|range miles=2600\n|range nmi=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=35000\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=2550\n|more performance=*Takeoff distance to 50 ft (15 m):\n*Landing distance from 50 ft (15 m):\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://howard500.com/ N500HP web site]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080504024917/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/m.zoeller/H500.htm Howard 500 on Lockheed Twins site]\n* [http://www.flightsimonline.com/howard500/ The Howard 500 Project] - Development of Howard 500 model for Microsoft Flight Simulator, with extensive detail, photographs, and movies of real aircraft.\n* [http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-11-12/rare-vintage-bizliner-hits-market Rare Vintage Bizliner Hits The Market]"
