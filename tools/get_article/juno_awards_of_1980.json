The only live performance of the night was two songs in a row from Gordon Lightfoot, \"On the High Seas\" and \"If You Need Me\" (both from his recent Dream Street Rose album), which were quickly added to fill up air time when Paul Anka was unexpectedly absent to receive his \"Canadian Music Hall of Fame\" award.\nThe biggest winner of the night was Anne Murray with four awards including the Album and Single of the Year awards.  Murray was once again absent from the award show, this time due to the recent death of her father.\nThe band Trooper received an unusual nomination for two of their songs in the same category for \"Composer of the Year\", although technically the songs were from two different albums both charting at the time.\nThe last award of the show was \"Male Vocalist of the Year\" presented by ambassador Ken Taylor to the winner Burton Cummings.\nNominees and winners\nFemale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Anne Murray\nOther nominees:\n*Carroll Baker\n*Claudja Barry\n*Lisa Dal Bello\n*Joni Mitchell\nMale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Burton Cummings\nOther nominees:\n*Bruce Cockburn\n*Murray McLauchlan\n*Gino Vannelli\n*Neil Young\nMost Promising Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: France Joli\nOther nominees:\n*Alma Faye Brooks\n*Nana McLean\n*Karen Silver\n*Laura Vinson\nMost Promising Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Walter Rossi\nOther nominees:\n*Bryan Adams\n*Gary Fjellgaard\n*Freddie James\n*Richard Stepp\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: Trooper\nOther nominees:\n*April Wine\n*Max Webster\n*Prism\n*Rush\nMost Promising Group of the Year\nWinner: Streetheart\nOther nominees:\n*FM\n*The Minglewood Band\n*The Raes\n*Teaze\nComposer of the Year\nWinner: Frank Mills, \"Peter Piper\" by Frank Mills\nOther nominees:\n*Tony Green, \"Everybody Get Up and Boogie\" by Freddie James\n*Brian Smith, Ra McGuire, \"The Boys in the Bright White Sportscar\" by Trooper\n*Brian Smith, Ra McGuire, \"3 Dressed Up as a 9\" by Trooper\n*Gino Soccio, \"Dancer\" by Gino Soccio\nCountry Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Anne Murray\nOther nominees:\n*Carroll Baker\n*Marie Bottrell\n*Glory-Anne Carriere\n*Iris Larratt\nCountry Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Murray McLauchlan\nOther nominees:\n*Wilf Carter\n*Eddie Eastman\n*Ray Griff\n*Ronnie Prophet\nCountry Group or Duo of the Year\nWinner: The Good Brothers\nOther nominees:\n*Carlton Showband\n*The Emeralds\n*Family Brown\n*The Mercey Brothers\nFolk Artist of the Year\nWinner: Bruce Cockburn\nOther nominees:\n*Murray McLauchlan\n*Gordon Lightfoot\n*Joni Mitchell\n*Valdy\nInstrumental Artist of the Year\nWinner: Frank Mills\nOther nominees:\n*Liona Boyd\n*André Gagnon\n*Hagood Hardy\n*Gino Soccio\nProducer of the Year\nWinner: Bruce Fairbairn, Armageddon by Prism\nOther nominees:\n*Bob Gallo, Night Music by Hellfield\n*Paul Gross, Images at Twilight by Saga\n*Andre Perry, I Want You by Wilson Pickett\n*Domenic Troiano, Fret Fever by Domenic Troiano\nRecording Engineer of the Year\nWinner: David Greene, Concerto for Contemporary Violin by Paul Hoffert\nOther nominees:\n*Nick Blagona, \"Say Hello\" by April Wine, \"Under My Thumb\", Streetheart\n*Andrew Hermant, \"The Birdwalk\" by Hagood Hardy, Riel Soundtrack by Bill McCauley\n*Paul Page, \"Hold on I'm Comin'\" by Karen Silver\n*Mark Wright, \"Let Go the Line\" and \"Paradise Skies\" by Max Webster\nCanadian Music Hall of Fame\nWinner: Paul Anka\nNominated and winning albums\nAlbum of the Year\nWinner: Anne Murray, New Kind of Feeling\nOther nominees:\n*Armageddon, Prism\n*Flying Colors, Trooper\n*Hemispheres, Rush\n*Hot Shots, Trooper\nBest Album Graphics\nWinner: Rodney Bowes, Cigarettes by The Wives\nOther nominees:\n*Rodney Bowes, Good-Bye LA by Bob Segarini\n*Heather Cooper, Hoffert: Concerto for Contemporary Violin/Stravinsky by Paul Hoffert\n*Dave Elliot, Private Eye (self-titled)\n*Paul Hodgson, Rendezvous by CANO\nBest Children's Album\nWinner: Sharon, Lois & Bram, Smorgasbord\nOther nominees:\n*Chickery Chick, Sandra Beech\n*Going Bananas, All the Performers of the Mariposa in the Schools Program\n*I Lost My Pet Lizard, Brenda and Paul Hoffert\n*Mr. Dressup, For a Song, Ernie Coombs\nBest Classical Album of the Year\nWinner: The Crown of Ariadne, Judy Loman, R.
