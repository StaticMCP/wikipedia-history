Troops of the 8th Division were stationed in the Southern regions of the Orange Free State in order to cover Lord Roberts' advance on Transvaal, and to prevent the Orange Free State from falling back under Boer control. The British attempted to storm Biddulphsberg-kopje, which was defended by Boers of the Senekal Commando, however were unable to due to a fire that spread in the grass, forcing a retreat.\nReferences"
