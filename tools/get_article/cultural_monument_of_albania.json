Cultural monuments are usually under state protection as they are evidence of the history of human development, for the preservation of which there is a public interest.\nDefinition\nLaw nr.9048, dated 04.07.2003, titled \"For Cultural Heritage\" describes a cultural monument as an object or building with historical-cultural value that is protected by the state.\nCultural monuments are classified into two categories:\nCategory I\nCultural Monuments of the first category are buildings of significant value and importance for cultural heritage. They are preserved in the balance of their architectural and technical components. The volume composition, the architectural treatment of the external and internal views, as well as the planimetric and functional solution of these monuments cannot be changed.  New buildings near them must respect the distances of the protected surrounding space.\nCategory II\nCultural monuments of the second category are buildings of significant value, mainly in their external appearance. They are preserved in their volume and appearance.\nBoth categories are declared as such by the Ministry of Culture.\nSee also\n* Cultural heritage of Albania\n* List of Religious Cultural Monuments of Albania\nReferences"
