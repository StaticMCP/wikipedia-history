It was selected as the French entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.\nPlot\nAs Allied armies approach Paris in the summer of 1944, the occupying Germans arrest Robert, a writer and resister. His distraught wife Marguerite, also a writer and in the same resistance network, is approached by a French collaborator working for the Gestapo, who says he may be able to give information on her husband's fate. In return, he explicitly wants information on the influential resister Morland and implicitly would like an affair. After consulting Dionys, the head of the network who is also Marguerite's lover, she agrees to play along with the collaborator. They meet frequently, and he plies her with scarce food and wine, but she yields him no information or sex. He does however confirm that Robert has been deported to a concentration camp in Germany.\nOnce Paris is liberated and the Gestapo gone, the emphasis of the resisters switches to the fate of their captured members and support of their families. As Allied armies start liberating the concentration camps in the spring of 1945, information begins to trickle back on who is still alive and who is dead. Marguerite goes through agonies of waiting, torn between hope and despair, until it is confirmed that Robert is in Dachau and close to death. Dionys and Morland obtain a vehicle and papers to bring him back to Paris. When he is fit to work and travel, Marguerite takes him for a holiday in Italy but then divorces him.\nCast\n* Mélanie Thierry as Marguerite Duras\n* Emmanuel Bourdieu as Robert Antelme\n* Benoît Magimel as the fictional Pierre Rabier\n* Benjamin Biolay as Dionys Mascolo\n* Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet as Morland\nReception\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.
