His television script writing work includes Monarch of the Glen, Holby City, Love Bytes, Down to Earth, Casualty, As If, Peak Practice, and the 1987 film, Two of Us, for the BBC's Scene series.\nIn 1976, Stewart co-wrote his first musical, Shoot Up at Elbow Creek. He also wrote The Little Match Girl, based on Hans Christian Andersen's short story, for Richmond's Orange Tree Theatre, which contained the song \"Mistletoe and Wine.\" HTV assisted in the production of the play for television in 1986.\nHaving worked extensively in music, writing for, among others, the jazz-rock outfit Swegas, Consortium and Cliff Richard, and producing artists including Jeff Baker, Stewart continues to work as a lyricist, currently with the American blues musician, Johnny Mars.\nStewart is a member of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), the Writers' Guild of Great Britain, the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors and PRS for Music (formerly the Performing Rights Society).\nIn October 2022, Stewart was featured alongside Roger Tonge in an interview for BBC One's Kids TV: The Surprising Story (airdate 26 October 2022). They discussed their film Two Of Us (1987), which was written for the ''BBC Two's Scenes series, intended for use in schools. Stewart and Tonge spoke about letters they received in response to their film and the newspaper headlines. As Thatcher’s government was in power at the time of the release of Two Of Us, scenes from the film were removed and banned due to Thatcher’s laws.
