Designed by Miquel Blay, it consists of a bronze bust of Álvaro Figueroa Torres put on top of a pedestal, with other sculptural items around.\nHistory and description\nThe monument was an initiative of the teachers' associations in the province of Guadalajara, in appreciation for the 1901 Royal Decree promoted by Romanones which made possible the inclusion of the teachers' salaries and other expenses within the State's budget. The design was awarded to Miquel Blay.\nThe monument was unveiled on 16 October 1913, during a ceremony in which  (Minister of Public Instruction), the Mayor of Guadalajara and  (Mayor of Madrid), intervened as speakers, also attended by the likes of  (Director of the Geographic Institute) and  (Under-Secretary of Public Instruction).\nIt was erected when Romanones was still alive, in Guadalajara, the electoral district where Romanones had built his strongest political client networks.\nBesides the bronze bust of Romanones topping off the monument, the sculptural ensemble also displays a teacher (Wisdom) and a student (Learning). The latter is depicted collecting the 1901 royal decree from the hands of Romanones.\nWhen commented about the inauguration, Romanones (serving as prime minister at the time) reportedly threatened with removing his statue stating as follows: \"Well then, I will go there with my guards one morning and I will remove it. I think the effigy already belongs to me, just as a photograph belongs to the person being photographed\".\nThe monument underwent a restoration in 2013, consisting of its cleaning as well as the sealing of cracks and holes in the bronze pieces.\nReferences"
