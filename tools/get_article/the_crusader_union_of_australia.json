It has three main areas, CRU Camps, which includes: CRU Holiday Camps, CRU Study Camps and CRU Day Camps, Summit Educational Camps (including the  Ian Holt Memorial Fellowship Program) and Schools Ministry (made up of CRU School Groups and CRU Resources). CRU's frontline ministries are supported by two campsites (CRU Galston Gorge Camp & Conference Centre and CRU Lake Mac Camp & Conference Centre), and a Training Division. The Training Division is a Registered Training Organisation (NTIS No. 90717) offering training in ‘Apply First Aid’ (formerly Senior First Aid).\nHistory\nCrusaders was founded in 1930 in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia by Howard Guinness, a man keen to strengthen Christian work among school students in independent schools. He saw voluntary groups as a key to achieving this. The first Crusader Camp was held over Easter 1930, and by September the organisational structure of the Crusader Union was established.\nThe Crusader Union consulted with the British Crusaders, with the aim of adopting a modified version of their logo and constitution. However the British Crusaders objected to affiliation due to the distances between Australia and England, and remarked that Australian schools “did not correspond in rank” to theirs. Though the logo adopted by the Boys Division in 1933 and the logo used by the British Crusaders are nearly identical, with the adoption of the Southern Cross and location of the knightly helmet being the only differences between the two.\nIn 1934 CRU was founded in Western Australia.\nThe Crusader Women's Fellowship, began at Roseville Park in 1939.\nBy 1952 CRU had forty branches operating in Victoria and had begun work on a permanent campsite at Toolangi. By 1954 the Crusader Union had 150 branches across the entirety of Australia and New Zealand, however, in 1955 CRU merged with Scripture Union in all states except for New South Wales. During the 1960s CRU became a Registered Company Limited by Guarantee to meet legal requirements. Initially established in Sydney's CBD, the office relocated to Strathfield in 1988, then Eastwood in 1993. In 1964 CRU held Study Camps for high school students for the first time. By 2018 over 441 Sydney School Students would attend these camps annually.\nThe Crusader Union of NSW became the Crusader Union of Australia on 23 May 1990 and the Crusader ‘eagle’ logo was introduced in 1997. In 2002 the CRU Camp brand would be trademarked.\nIn 2019 the 'eagle' logo was phased out and replaced with the current stylised letters.\nAfter thirty-four years as C.E.O. Gary Hill stood down in November 2025 and was replaced by Nick Hood.\nCampsites\nin the background.]]\nThe first camps run by the Crusader Union were on rented land. Due to the condition of these campsites being outside the control of the Crusader Union, in 1943 the decision was made to purchase their own sites. Four such sites would be purchased in Galston Gorge, Lake Macquarie, and along the Colo River in New South Wales and in Toolangi in Victoria. The Galston Gorge and Lake Macquarie sites continue to operate today.\nLake Mac\nThe CRU site in Lake Macquarie, known today as CRU Lake Mac, was the first site acquired by the Crusader Union of NSW. Leslie Parr had expressed interested in using his land on the shore of Lake Macquarie as a site for a youth group. He donated his land to the Crusader Union of NSW on March 4, 1946. At that time the land was bushland, and was not connected to any roadways. In 1957 the ‘Hilltop’ Hall was constructed at CRU Lake Mac, and construction of six ‘Timber Tent’ cabins begun in 1968, an additional 4 would be built in June 1970. That same year hot water was first supplied to the campsite. By 1973 the need for a redevelopment of the site was recognised and an architect was brought in to redesign the site, but such plans were not able to be completed at the time. In 1993 a rock climbing and abseiling tower was constructed at the site.\nIn 2019 CRU began a $25 million refurbishment of the Lake Macquarie campsite, increasing the capacity of the site from 120 to 380 and constructing two new Climbing Towers. In 2024 a 147 metre long zipline was constructed at the Lake Macquarie site, and was opened by Dan Repacholi.\nToday the site hosts school and church camps as well as family groups. As of 2020 the site injected around $620,000 into the local economy every year.\nGalston Gorge\nIn the early 1950s Paul White mortgaged his home to buy land for the Crusader Union of NSW in Galston for £600. The land at Galston was prepared by 1955, however Cumberland County Council regulations initially prohibited the construction on the site, and so construction of the first two cabins started in September 1957. Dining facilities were not completed until 1960, and in that same year ‘Petter’ Cabin was constructed. In June 1966 electricity was provided to the site after the construction of telephone poles and solar system. Water was provided to the site in 1967. By 1970 the site could accommodate 90 people.\nIn 2000 the Galston Gorge site was used by SOCOG to house drivers and staff from the Olympic Roads & Traffic Authority. In 2003 redevelopment begun at the Galston Gorge Campsite, this development was completed in 2010. The campsite now hosts up to 220 people at a time.\nColo River\nThe Crusader Union of New South Wales had run multiple canoeing camps along the Colo River until 1968 when the site which CRU had rented for those camps was sold to the Polish Boy Scouts. CRU then purchased their own campsite along the Colo River later in that year. The new site was five and a half acres in size with 60m of shoreline along the river. The first camp there was held in January 1969, and in mid-1969 the original Lake Macquarie site's kitchen was moved to Colo River. The vast majority of construction on the Colo site was undertaken by a team of forty-three volunteers. The Colo River Site was prone to flooding, and eventually the site would be sold in the mid-1980s.\nToolangi\nThe Crusader Union of Victoria owned a 15 acre campsite along Campbell's Creek in Toolangi, Victoria. The site included a mess hall, kitchen, store room, and three sleeping huts. In 1955 the campsite was transferred to the Scripture Union.\nSchools ministry\nSix full-time staff and four ministry associates address over 100,000 students each year in 185 independent schools across NSW and the ACT. There are also Christian groups across Australia using CRU resources.
