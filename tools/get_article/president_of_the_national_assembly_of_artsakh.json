From January 1992 to December 1994, until Robert Kocharyan was elected as the president of Artsakh, the chairman was de facto the head of state of the republic.\nFollowing an Azerbaijani offensive on 19 September 2023, Artsakh agreed to dissolve itself by 1 January 2024, as de jure. In December 2023, this decision was subsequently declared not valid by the Artsakh president.\nThe speaker is Davit Ishkhanyan of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation.\nList of presidents of the National Assembly\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Name\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Political party\n|-\n|\n|Leonard Petrosyan\n|12 September 1991\n|8 January 1992\n|Independent\n|-\n|\n|Artur Mkrtchyan\n|8 January 1992\n|14 April 1992\n|Independent\n|-\n|\n|Georgi Petrosian (acting)\n|15 April 1992\n|14 June 1993\n|Independent\n|-\n|\n|\n|14 June 1993\n|March 1996\n|Independent\n|-\n|\n|Arthur Tovmasyan\n|March 1996\n|2 December 1997\n|Independent\n|-\n|\n|Oleg Yesayan\n|2 December 1997\n|1 July 2005\n|Independent\n|-\n|\n|Ashot Ghulian\n|1 July 2005\n|21 May 2020\n|Democratic\n|-\n|\n|Arthur Tovmasyan\n|21 May 2020\n|29 July 2023\n|Free Motherland\n|-\n|\n|Davit Ishkhanyan\n|7 August 2023\n|\n|Armenian Revolutionary Federation\n|}\nSee also\n*National Assembly (Artsakh)\n*Politics of Artsakh\n*President of Artsakh\n*President of the National Assembly of Armenia\n*Prime Minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic\n*State Minister of Artsakh\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nkrusa.org/country_profile/national_assembly.shtml] Office of the Republic of Artsakh"
