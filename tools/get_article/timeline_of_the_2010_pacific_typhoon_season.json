Most of the tropical cyclones forming between May and November. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator between 100°E and the International Date Line. Tropical storms that form in the entire Western Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Tropical depressions that form in this basin are given a number with a \"W\" suffix by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center. In addition, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones (including tropical depressions) that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility. These names, however, are not in common use outside of the Philippines.\nDuring the season, 32 systems were designated as Tropical Depressions by either, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), or other National Meteorological and Hydrological Services such as the China Meteorological Administration and the Hong Kong Observatory. As they run the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for the Western Pacific, the JMA assigns names to Tropical Depressions should they intensify into a tropical storm. PAGASA also assign local names to tropical depressions which form within their area of responsibility; however, these names are not in common use outside of PAGASA's area of responsibility. In this season, 11 systems entered or formed in the Philippine area of responsibility, which only two of them directly made landfall over the Philippines.\nOverall, there were only 14 named storms which developed during the season, which makes it the lowest on record. This is due to the La Niña, which was last occurred during 1998. The first half of the season was extremely quiet with only four tropical depressions forming, which one of the only made it to tropical storm strength.\nFor convenience of following systems monitored my multiple agencies, all systems are listed with an unofficial \"Storm ID\" which is derived from the total number of tropical cyclones monitored during the year.\nTimeline of events\nImageSize = width:1030 height:250\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/2010 till:01/01/2011\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/2010\nColors     =\nid:canvas value:gray(0.88)\nid:GP     value:red\nid:TD     value:rgb(0.43,0.76,0.92)    legend:Tropical_Depression_=_≤62_km/h_(≤39_mph)\nid:TS     value:rgb(0.3,1,1)    legend:Tropical_Storm_=_62–88_km/h_(39–54_mph)\nid:ST     value:rgb(0.75,1,0.75)        legend:Severe_Tropical_Storm_=_89–117_km/h_(55–72_mph)\nid:STY    value:rgb(1,0.85,0.55)    legend:Typhoon_=_118–156_km/h_(73–96_mph)\nid:VSTY   value:rgb(1,0.45,0.54)    legend:Very_Strong_Typhoon_=_157–193_km/h_(97–119_mph)\nid:VITY   value:rgb(0.55,0.46,0.90)    legend:Violent_Typhoon_=_≥194_km/h_(≥120_mph)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbarset:Hurricane\nbar:month\nPlotData=\nbarset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\nfrom:18/01/2010 till:20/01/2010 color:TD text:\"01W\"\nfrom:22/03/2010 till:26/03/2010 color:TS text:\"Omais\"\nfrom:26/04/2010 till:26/04/2010 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:11/07/2010 till:18/07/2010 color:STY text:\"Conson\"\nfrom:17/07/2010 till:23/07/2010 color:STY text:\"Chanthu\"\nfrom:18/07/2010 till:20/07/2010 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:23/07/2010 till:24/07/2010 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:26/07/2010 till:28/07/2010 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:03/08/2010 till:05/08/2010 color:TS text:\"Domeng\"\nfrom:06/08/2010 till:12/08/2010 color:ST text:\"Dianmu\"\nbarset:break\nfrom:21/08/2010 till:25/08/2010 color:TS text:\"Mindulle\nfrom:26/08/2010 till:28/08/2010 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:27/08/2010 till:04/09/2010 color:ST text:\"Lionrock\"\nfrom:28/08/2010 till:03/09/2010 color:STY text:\"Kompasu\"\nfrom:29/08/2010 till:31/08/2010 color:TS text:\"Namtheun\"\nfrom:30/08/2010 till:31/08/2010 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:01/09/2010 till:10/09/2010 color:ST text:\"Malou\"\nfrom:06/09/2010 till:11/09/2010 color:ST text:\"Meranti\"\nfrom:14/09/2010 till:22/09/2010 color:VSTY text:\"Fanapi\"\nfrom:20/09/2010 till:25/09/2010 color:VSTY text:\"Malakas\"\nbarset:break\nfrom:05/10/2010 till:10/10/2010 color:TD text:\"14W\"\nfrom:07/10/2010 till:08/10/2010 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:12/10/2010 till:24/10/2010 color:VITY text:\"Megi\"\nfrom:20/10/2010 till:31/10/2010 color:VSTY text:\"Chaba\"\nfrom:20/10/2010 till:28/10/2010 color:TD text:\"17W\"\nfrom:03/11/2010 till:04/11/2010 color:TD text:\"TD\"\nfrom:12/11/2010 till:14/11/2010 color:TD text:\"18W\"\nfrom:12/12/2010 till:13/12/2010 color:TD text:\"19W\"\nfrom:19/12/2010 till:20/12/2010 color:TD text:\"Omeka\"\nbarset:break\nbar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\nfrom:01/01/2010 till:01/02/2010 text:January\nfrom:01/02/2010 till:01/03/2010 text:February\nfrom:01/03/2010 till:01/04/2010 text:March\nfrom:01/04/2010 till:01/05/2010 text:April\nfrom:01/05/2010 till:01/06/2010 text:May\nfrom:01/06/2010 till:01/07/2010 text:June\nfrom:01/07/2010 till:01/08/2010 text:July\nfrom:01/08/2010 till:01/09/2010 text:August\nfrom:01/09/2010 till:01/10/2010 text:September\nfrom:01/10/2010 till:01/11/2010 text:October\nfrom:01/11/2010 till:01/12/2010 text:November\nfrom:01/12/2010 till:01/01/2011 text:December\nJanuary\n;January&nbsp;18\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC at A tropical depression develops 765&nbsp;km (465&nbsp;mi) southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC at Tropical Depression 01W develops 760&nbsp;km (460&nbsp;mi) southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\n;January&nbsp;19\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC at Tropical Depression 01W reaches its peak strength with winds of 55&nbsp;km/h (35&nbsp;km/h).\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC at The tropical depression attains its lowest pressure of 1006 hPa (mbar;
