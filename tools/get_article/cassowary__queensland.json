The Captain Cook Highway forms a short northern boundary. A cane tramway carries harvested sugarcane to the sugar mill at Mossman.\nHistory\nThe locality presumably takes its name from the large Australian flightless bird, the cassowary, which is found in the northern tropics of Queensland.\nCassowary State School opened on 3 February 1913.
