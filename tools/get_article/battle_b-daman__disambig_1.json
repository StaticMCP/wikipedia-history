He and his friends use the sport of B-Daman to fight the Shadow Alliance (who wants to take over the world). This show takes place in the B-Da World, a Post-Apocalyptic wasteland where its inhabitants are humans, anthropomorphic animals, and robots. Using the legendary B-Daman, Yamato enters the Winners tournament organized by a group (the JBA in the Japanese version and the IBA (International B-Daman Association) in English version) to become the B-Da Champion. However, he also ends up in fights against the Shadow Alliance.\nSeason 2 (Fire Spirits)\nAfter the defeat of the Shadow Alliance, Yamato is in search of special B-DaBalls called Strike Shots, which originated from shooting stars. After a fight with the mysterious Haja and obtaining his Strike Shot, the Drive Shot, Yamato then met Gunnos, a rookie B-Da Player. He got his own Strike Shot to participate in the Winners Tournament along with Yamato's old friends and rivals. But little did they know, a terrible evil is about to put the B-Da World in peril once more.\nCharacters\nMain cast\n*\n:\n:: Introduced in season one, 11-year-old Yamato is the main character. Raised by cats until the age of 5, his foster mother did not allow him to own a B-Daman until Cobalt Blade appeared to him one fateful night. Cobalt Blade, supposedly the best B-Daman ever made. But it gets heavily damaged by Cain McDonnell, one of Yamato's enemies. Following its near destruction, Cobalt Blade is rebuilt as Cobalt Saber, the first B-Daman to use the newly developed Blaster Core (also known as Delta core) system by Armada. This new system allowed the very core of the B-Daman to be modified. Yamato's special attack is Cobalt Power Blast, a powerful attack that utilizes the friction of the battlefield. Yamato somehow looks like a cat. He is most likely named after the powerful Japanese battleship Yamato. In the second season of the anime and second half of the manga, Yamato's Strike Shot is the Drive Shot for his new B-Daman called Cobalt Saber Fire, which would later be upgraded to Cobalt Blaster with the Cartridge system and the Stealth Drive Shot until the final episode in which Cobalt Blaster transformed into Cobalt Blaster Drive Cannon with the R.C. system and the Legend Drive Shot. In the manga, Yamato already begun with having a B-Daman named Cobalt Sword which would be upgraded to Cobalt Blade.\n*\n:\n:: He is Yamato's friend and is a tough guy.

His Strike Shot is the Speed Shot.\n*\n:\n:: Bull has three personalities: The calm and naive side, the confident side and the wild side that appears when he presents his B-Daman. This dark side remains until the end of a B-DaBattle and can enter a berserker state where he's practically invincible. He uses the B-Daman, Helio Breaker which later gets destroyed and he decides to be a B-Daman mechanic. Later on, he creates Helio Berserker and Helio Flyer which is either from the Delta Core or the Roller Core. Bull started appearing in season 1. He is 11&nbsp;years old. In season one, Bull met a girl. She only likes Bull's hyper-form and when she learnt that the 'calm' Bull is the true Bull, she lost interest in him. She later goes on to like the calm, full of snot, true Bull. In Season 2, Bull meets up with Akyulus and eventually befriends the silent boy. Bull is the first ever friend of Akyulus. Nearing the start of the second Winners Tournament, he makes a decision to be a full-time B-Da Mechanic, vowing to make Revolver Hades, the best B-Daman ever so that Akyulus could use it to defeat Yamato.\n*\n:\n:: He is Yamato's fellow friend under Armada. He has a Scottish accent and uses the B-Daman, Wing Ninja which was later recreated into Wing Sword and Wing Eagle. Terry started appearing in season 1. He is 10&nbsp;years old. In Season 2, Terry and Joe decide to enter the Winners Tournament together but along the way, Terry finds a Strike Shot, Random Shot. Joe deems that Terry will not improve with him along so he leaves, only to find Terry following him, not wanting him to go. However, Haja hears of this Strike Shot and attacks Terry for it. The two enter into battle and Haja pretends to admit defeat. Falling for his trick, Haja snatches the Strike Shot from Terry and he shoots. It is originally aimed towards Terry but Joe steps in to protect his brother/pupil. Terry has his blaster destroyed and then gets a new one named HudoFudoMaru and his Strike Shot is the Split Shot.\n*\n:\n:: Yamato's foster mother, she adopted him at the age of five. She is 22&nbsp;years old. She runs a restaurant called Mie's Café, later on changed to Mie's Cat Cafe. For she is just only one to run her Cafe, she asked Liena, Armada and all the others to help her run her Café. Then one day, she's suddenly somewhat feared by Armada because Armada always escapes his chores. And when he does that, Mie is getting almost furious. She thought that was the way in making Armada responsible!\n*\n:\n:: Gray's sister who was captured by the Shadow Alliance, made into a tough B-DaBattler and Ababa had her impersonate Sigma. She always wants to be at her brother's side. She took a small liking to Enjyu. She had the B-Daman, Garnet Wind which was first made for control, but had rapid fire added in its Zero 2 version. The rapid fire was added due to the new core, the Roller Core. The Roller Core had an added magazine head. The magazine head allowed you to hold 3 B-DaBalls instead of 2. The Roller Core as added to Li Yong Fa's B-Daman, King Rekuso.\n* Armada\n:\n:: Yamato's giant cat mentor, the legendary B-Daman master.

He also created the Cartridge system with Bears in the 2nd season as well as the Metal system in season 3.\n* Tommi\n:: Tommi is the black cat that follows Yamato. Marda B's good side uses him later on in the series to speak to Yamato and his friends.\n* B-DaMage\n:\n:: The series narrator, B-DaMage is an omnipotent being who along with her three cats, the Meowmigos (who corrects B-DaMage's mistakes) serves to explain about the world that the story takes places in, the characters, and the rules of B-Daman. She is called \"B-Damajin\" in the Japanese version.\n* Meowmigos\n:\n:: The Mewomigos are the companions of the B-DaMage.\n* Big Cheese\n:\n:: Little is known about this mouse except that he appears in segments with the B'DaMage and the Meowmigos.\nShadow Alliance\nThe Shadow Alliance (called simply \"Shadow\" in Japan) are the main antagonists of Season One with goals of B-DaWorld Domination. Some members of the Shadow Alliance have a 3rd eye which is the symbol of the Shadow Alliance and is a sign that the character is under Marda B.'s control. There are two incarnations of the group: There was the original and the Neo Shadow Alliance. The members of this group are as following:\n* Marda B.\n:\n:: Marda B. is the main villain of the 1st season who established the Shadow Alliance and Neo Shadow Alliance. Marda B. was a mysterious being who was the greatest B-DaPlayer. He was the first B-DaMaster. He was a good person, but also very competitive. When he asked for an eternal life to remain undefeated forever, he was punished by being turned into a spirit. His competitive side separated from him and became an evil spirit wanting to conquer the B-DaWorld. The good side came to live in a statue that guarded powerful B-DaBalls carrying his own essence, which became known as the B-Energy, the only thing that can defeat the evil Marda B. When Ababa had been depowered by Marda B. after being exposed as a criminal, he started the Neo Shadow Alliance, where all of the members he sent to, attack Yamato and the gang who were innocent B-DaPlayers under his control (with the exception of Enjyu, Biarce, Cain, and Joshua who joined on their own free will). Marda B.'s evil form seems to be one giant flaming eye (which is very similar in appearance to the eye of Sauron from Lord of the Rings) that always seemed to be floating in the sky. In episode 51, Marda B. fuses with Biarce to form, Marda Biarce, and reveals his plot: He sent the Shadow Alliance after Cobalt Blade, sent the Neo Shadow Alliance to collect B-DaSpirits. and even created Biarce, just so he could culminate his plan to conquer the B-DaWorld by having the ultimate B-DaBattle with Yamato. At the end of the final episode of season 1, his full good form is revealed a seemingly huge gray cat wearing in a white topki.\n* Ababa\n:\n:: An evil cat who worked for Marda B with the ability to brainwash people. He even managed to brainwash Bull. Ababa was the leader of the Shadow Alliance, which consisted of major characters like Gray, Enjyu, Wen, and Li. When depowered by Marda B, he is turned back into his original form, a purple cat with long hair. He makes a small cameo with the rest of the crowd, after Yamato and his friends return from defeating the Neo Shadow Alliance.\n*\n:\n:: Enjyu used to be a talented kid who wished to improve his skills more as a B-Daman player. His father, however wanted him to take a dive on each of his battles so his dad could pay for their rent. Before each battle, Enjyu's opponents would pay him to lose the match, making them look skilled and Enjyu, an amateur. Fed up of his life, Enjyu joined the Junior B-Daman Tournament. There he was disqualified after unfairly being accused of cheating due to his refusal to repeat his past life. After being betrayed by his only \"friend\", Enjyu took out his anger on his father in a B-DaBattle. As soon as the battle commenced, Enjyu's personality and hair changed from blue to red. The reason of why his hair changed color is uncertain. After the battle, Enjyu joined the Shadow Alliance where he later received Lightning Kahn (Bloody Kaiser in the original version), the brother of Cobalt Blade, as his new B-Daman. Later in the series, Lightning Kahn was upgraded to Blazing Kahn by Marda B. and later in season 2 is upgraded once more into Variable Kaiser (Hasbro never released a Cartridge System version, so the name remains unchanged), in order to defeat Yamato in the finals. However, instead of defeating him, Enjyu saved Yamato's life and quickly be-friended him. He later rejoined the Neo Shadow Alliance so that he could have fought Marda B. to avenge his new \"friends\". At the end of season 1, Marda B. brainwashes Enjyu, and Terry used his part of the B-Energy to set him free, but Enjyu wasn't happy about that. He was angry because he felt as if Terry wasted his B-Energy, which he could use to save the world, to save him. Although, Terry reasoned that he was his friend and he figured out, with the help of Joe, that it was the morally correct choice. The name is romanized as Enjyu in the English versions and Enju in the Japanese websites. In Fire Spirits, he obtained his own Strike Shot called the Black Drive Shot from a boy that live at the icy mountain.\n*\n:\n:: He is the older of the Yong Fa brothers. He joined the Shadow Alliance at a young age to become a stronger B-DaPlayer. Wen is often blunt and stubborn but also open-hearted and loyal to those he cares about. He and Li first appeared to fight Yamato in a B-DaBattle following Battle Crow's defeat. He uses the B-Daman, Bakuso which was later upgraded to King Bakuso by Bull, then finally to Suiseiryu by Bears and Armada. He changed his ways and left the Shadow Alliance after Yamato helped him in a battle against Enjyu. After Wen left, he continued to help Yamato and the gang, often under Armada's direction. He sometimes wore a mask and cape. When his younger brother, Li Yong Fa, joined the Neo Shadow Alliance to infiltrate Neo Shadow Alliance, he traveled with Yamato and his friends. Unfortunately, Li was not accepted into the alliance, and was made a puppet to Marda B. He eventually fought Li and brought him back to normal. The brothers have not separated since. His Strike Shot is the Metal Spike Shot.\n* '|リー・ユンファ|Rii Yonfa''}}\n:\n:: The younger brother of Wen, he uses seal papers as his calling card. He uses the B-Daman, Rekuso which was later upgraded to King Rekuso, then to Ryuseiryu by Armada and Bears. Li and Wen first appeared to fight Yamato in a B-DaBattle following Battle Crow's defeat. He and his older brother have been helping Yamato after they left the Shadow Alliance. Later in the series, Enjyu begged Li to help him defeat Marda B. Like Enjyu, Li pretended to work for the Neo Shadow Alliance in order to find Marda B.'s weakness. But certain members did not trust Li's loyalties towards the Neo Shadow Alliance so Marda B. claimed Li's mind, giving Li the third eye and erasing all his past memories. Later, Wen tried to save his brother through a B-Dabattle. Luckily, Wen won and returned Li to his normal self.\n* Battle Crow\n:\n:: A crow-type birdman.

He managed to do that by having Joshua fake a kidnapping of Marilyn, but Cobalt Blade was rebuilt into Cobalt Saber. Cain sent Joshua and the other Super Five Field Guardians to put an end to the construction of Cobalt Saber but they failed when they were fended off by Yamato's friends. Cain later joined the Neo Shadow Alliance with Joshua where he sported a different outfit. In the final battle against the Neo Shadow Alliance, he was defeated by Gray.

Despite being hotheaded, sarcastic and limited experience, he possesses amazing skill. His first B-Daman was a rapid-fire B-Daman named Gun Breaker which was a remake of Helio Breaker from Season 1. He enters the Winners Tournament for his village as he promises them that when he left that he would go and win. After encountering Yamato, he tags along and becomes part of the regular rivalry between the two. While he is rude and obnoxious to Yamato, he is extremely polite towards others such as Terry & Joe, even bowing down to them because he thinks they are 'cool and smart,' and he saved a village from bandits using his new B-Daman, Break Ogre and his Strike Shot, the Metal Shot. He is in love with a girl named Kiko, and dislikes the daughter of the highest man in their village.\nAkyulus\n* (アキュラス)\nLittle is known about this boy. He has said that he is the last survivor of a clan who knows the secret of a special B-Daman move. His B-Daman was Revolver Hades. He is befriended by Bull, and slowly begins to accept him as a companion and friend. Bull then vows to make Revolver Hades, even better than Cobalt Saber Fire, in order to help Akyulus win the tournament. In the qualifying rounds of the 2nd Winners Tournament, Akyulus is Division 2 and the contestants had to navigate through a series of difficult obstacles to shoot their B-DaBall into the final hole - a B-Daman version of golf. Akyulus is the first to finish, using Revolver Hades' special spin control abilities, making him the first to qualify. In the quarter-finals, the 10 contestants that made it through, are regrouped into Set A and B. Akyulus is grouped into Set A where the five contestants enter a pyramid to face three challenges. They would have to hit a hovering blue ball to pass a challenge and that would transport them to a higher level and eventually out of the pyramid. Akyulus and Enjyu are the victors of this challenge and they come out together so the first to emerge is unknown. In the semi-finals, there are only four contestants left, Yamato, Gunnos, Enjyu and Akyulas. Enjyu and Akyulas face off in a game where they must defend their goal with their B-Daman while attempting to shoot their own B-DaBalls into the opponent's goal. Each player had to score ten goals before they would be declared the winner. Akyulas easily defeats Enjyu, but not before Enjyu finally uses all his strength to score one goal - tarnishing Akyulas' perfect 10–0 to 10–1. Akyulas is said to be a legendary battler from the spirits above. In the Winners Tournament that he joined, he battled last against Yamato. And thanks to that battle, he regained some of his memories, his past. And some of that past is bad. He remembered that 100 years ago, his village was destroyed by the evil side, causing his peaceful village into complete chaos. And, as being a Legendary B-DaPlayer, he also has the power to create Strike Shots. But, when he does that, he loses some of his energy. Thanks to this ability, he attracted the attention of Beadeus and was captured, later forced to create the Ultimate Gadeaum shot. Afterwards, he was released into a dark underground dungeon where Yamato found him. However, due to the creation of the Gadeaum shot, he lost his will and became an uncontrollable, demonic fighter. Also, the Revolver Hades had been upgraded to Gatling Hades sometime during his capture, and he used it to battle and nearly defeat Yamato. However, Yamato managed to rescue him by attacking and disabling Gatling Hades with the Stealth Drive Shot, which was the proof of his and Yamato's friendship. He later on decided to be with Yamato and the gang because Beadeus had already announced to the people of the whole B-DaWorld that Yamato's side and Beadeus's side will fight. In the beginning, Yamato thought that the battle was too easy. Until he found out that the evil sealed by Akyulas's ancestors had been awakened because of the Ultimate Gadeaum Shot that Akyulas had made. Galdezer has now been fully awakened. Now because of the creature's escape, he battled alongside Yamato to defeat Galdezer. He befriends Yamato, Terry, Gray, Gunnos, and all the others later on. Now, in the final battle, it's up to Yamato to succeed. Akyulas thought about Yamato and the Ultimate Gadeaum Shot. He thought that the Strike Shot was so powerful so he thought he should make another Strike Shot that would defeat it. Shin tried to warn him that when he created another Strike Shot, it will cost him his life. He said that he would never create a Strike Shot anymore and would live a happy and peaceful life with Yamato for the rest of their lives. But when he sleeps, he dreamed about Yamato being beaten by Galdezer. He then decided to disobey Shin and create the Ultimate Drive Shot. During the next day, he didn't appear to support his newfound friend, but when Yamato was almost beaten, he then appeared and gave Yamato the Legend Drive Shot. Shin now then knew that he had created another Strike Shot when he told Yamato to use it.\nShin\n* (シン)\nHe is a talking wolf who travels with Akyulas - seems to speak for Akyulas too. He's the one who first talked to Bull when they met. He sometimes annoys Bull, because Bull calls him a lot of names, like \"spot\", \"doggie\" and a lot of other names. He's like the secretary and speaker of Akyulas. He's the one who explained to Yamato and the gang, the past of Akyulas. Ironically, the last time Bull talked to him, Bull finally called him Shin, but he too reacted to the use of his own name as another insult coming from Bull.\nHaja/Scorpious\n*\nHe is a scorpion-haired B-DaPlayer. Obsessed with entering tournament, he took the Random Shot from Terry and defeated Joe.  After losing in the Winners Tournament, he also tried to sabotage the tournament, but was stopped by Terry.  Haja eventually lost to Terry in the spider match. Fortunately for him, he was able to recover, thanks to Beadeus and his servants.  His mission is supposed to be stopping Yamato and his friends from rescuing Akyulas, but Haja disobeys his \"master\". He then destroys Beadeus's spy machines. He later \"hires\" Jinbee to be his loyal servant. Yamato and his friends were unsure of where he ended up to after he tried to stop him again.
