In 2006, he ran a 4.23-second 40-yard dash, which set the school record for a wide receiver. That season, he was considered one of the top rookies in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and earned first-team freshman All-America from the Sporting News and Rivals.com.

As the first wide receiver selected, he was picked earlier than most projections, and before Michael Crabtree and Jeremy Maclin, who most analysts thought would precede Heyward-Bey. At the 2009 NFL Combine, he recorded a 40-yard dash time of 4.30 seconds.\nDuring organized team activities following the draft, Heyward-Bey practiced early but was plagued by multiple hamstring injuries. On July 30, 2009, the Oakland Raiders agreed to terms on a five-year deal with Heyward-Bey worth $23.5 million. As a rookie, Heyward-Bey started 11 games, catching nine passes for 124 yards and one touchdown while rushing twice for 19 yards. He averaged 11.3 yards per reception in 2009.\n2010\nin 2010.]]\nIn 2010, Heyward-Bey started 14 of the 15 games in which he played. He had 26 receptions for 366 yards and one touchdown. On September 19 against the St. Louis Rams, Heyward-Bey had a career-high six receptions. Vittorio Tafur of the San Francisco Chronicle highlighted Heyward-Bey's performance in the game as a marked improvement from the preseason. On October 31, in a 33–3 victory over the Seattle Seahawks, Heyward-Bey made a career-long 69-yard touchdown reception from Jason Campbell, part of a career-high of 105 receiving yards.\n2011\nOn October 2, 2011, in the Raiders' 31–19 loss to the New England Patriots, Heyward-Bey had four receptions for 115 yards, including a 58-yard reception. Over the next three games, he would compile receiving totals of 99 (October 9 against the Houston Texans), 82 (October 16 against the Cleveland Browns), and 89 (October 23 against the Kansas City Chiefs) yards. On December 18, 2011, in a 28–27 loss to the Detroit Lions, Heyward-Bey had eight receptions for 155 yards, both new career-highs, and the most single-game receiving yards for the Raiders since Jerry Rice in 2003. On December 24, the Raiders beat the Kansas City Chiefs 16–13 in overtime after Heyward-Bey caught a 53-yard pass from Carson Palmer during overtime to set up Sebastian Janikowski's winning field goal. Heyward-Bey had a total of four receptions for 70 yards in the game. On January 1, during a loss to the San Diego Chargers, Heyward-Bey caught nine passes for 130 yards and a touchdown.\n2012\nOn September 23, 2012, in the fourth quarter of a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Heyward-Bey was left unconscious after a hit in the endzone by the Steelers' Ryan Mundy. Heyward-Bey was motionless in the endzone for more than 10 minutes before being placed in an ambulance to the Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley. Heyward-Bey was released from the hospital the next day. Mundy would be later fined for the hit. Overall, in the 2012 season, he had 41 receptions for 606 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns.\nHeyward-Bey was released by the Raiders on March 13, 2013.\nIndianapolis Colts\nHeyward-Bey signed a one-year deal worth up to $3 million with the Indianapolis Colts on April 1, 2013. Heyward-Bey finished the 2013 season with 29 receptions for 309 yards and a touchdown.\nPittsburgh Steelers\n2014\nOn April 2, 2014, Heyward-Bey signed a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nHe entered his first training camp with the Steelers competing with Lance Moore, Derek Moye, Martavis Bryant, and Justin Brown for the third wide receiver position. He was named the fifth receiver on the depth chart to begin the regular season.\nAs the fifth receiver, he appeared in all 16 games but caught only three passes for 33 yards and played predominantly on special teams.\nAgainst the Ravens in the Steelers' Wild Card Round playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Heyward-Bey made one reception for six yards, marking the first postseason catch of his career.\n2015\nThe Steelers re-signed Heyward-Bey to a one-year contract on March 26, 2015.\nFollowing the release of Lance Moore on March 2 and the four-game suspension of Martavis Bryant on August 31, Heyward-Bey became the Steelers' third receiver behind Antonio Brown and Markus Wheaton to begin the 2015 season.\nIn the regular season opener against the New England Patriots, Heyward-Bey caught four passes for 58 yards, including a reception of 43 yards. The following week against the San Francisco 49ers, Heyward-Bey again caught four passes, this time for 77 yards and one touchdown, marking his highest receiving yardage total since December 6, 2012.\nHeyward-Bey finished the 2015 regular season with 21 receptions for 314 yards and two touchdowns. In the Divisional Round against the Denver Broncos, he made two receptions for 64 yards.\n2016\nOn March 8, 2016, the Steelers re-signed Heyward-Bey on a three-year, $3.8 million contract.\nHe entered training camp competing to be the second or third wide receiver on the Steelers' depth chart, with Martavis Bryant suspended for the entire 2016 season. Heyward-Bey was named the fourth receiver behind Antonio Brown, Markus Wheaton, and Sammie Coates.\nAgainst the Miami Dolphins in Week 6, he carried the ball on a reverse for a 60-yard touchdown for both his longest career rushing attempt and first career rushing touchdown.\nHowever, in Week 9 against the Baltimore Ravens, he sustained a foot and ankle injury which sidelined him for the next six games. He returned for the Steelers' Week 16 rematch against the Ravens, though he did not make any receptions. In Week 17 against the Cleveland Browns, Heyward-Bey caught one pass for 46 yards for his longest reception of the season. This brought his 2016 regular season total to six receptions for 114 yards and two touchdowns.\nIn the Steelers' opening round playoff game against the Miami Dolphins, Heyward-Bey caught one pass for 10 yards in the Wild Card Round win.\n2017\nHeyward-Bey entered training camp in  facing stiff competition for the backup wide receiver position from JuJu Smith-Schuster, Cobi Hamilton, Eli Rogers, Sammie Coates, and Justin Hunter. He was initially named the fourth wide receiver behind Antonio Brown, Martavis Bryant, and Rogers, but was passed on the depth chart by Smith-Schuster early in the season.\nHeyward-Bey got his first touch of the season on offense in Week 4 against the Baltimore Ravens, carrying the ball on a reverse for three yards. He earned his first passing target and reception in Week 7 against the Cincinnati Bengals on a fake punt when he and teammate Robert Golden connected for 44 yards.\nIn Week 17 against the Cleveland Browns, Heyward-Bey scored a 29-yard rushing touchdown on a reverse.\nHeyward-Bey finished the 2017 season with two receptions for 47 yards. In addition, he contributed on special teams.\n2018\nHeyward-Bey appeared in 14 games for the Steelers in 2018, making two starts. He finished the season with one reception for 9 yards and played a role in special teams. The Steelers elected not to re-sign Heyward-Bey following the 2018 season.\nPersonal life\nHeyward-Bey's mother, Vivian, a certified accountant, has helped him save much of his career earnings, despite the majority of it having been his rookie deal in 2007.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.umterps.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=29700&ATCLID=207383441 Maryland Terrapins bio]\n*"
