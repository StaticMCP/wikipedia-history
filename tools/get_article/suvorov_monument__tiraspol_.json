According to the director of the Tiraspol United Museum Alla Melnichuk, this monument is considered one of the best artistic monuments to Suvorov in the territory of the former USSR.\nHistory\nThe monument was erected in 1979. Sculptors were Vladimir and Valentin Artamonov, while the architects were Y. Druzhinin and Y. Chistyakov. It is located on a small hill on Suvorov Square, the main square of the Transnistrian capital. The monument was awarded the Yevgeny Vuchetich Gold Medal.\nAlexander Suvorov is considered the founder of Tiraspol, since it was on his instructions that the Tiraspol fortress was laid on the left bank of the Dniester in 1792 as part of the organization of the Dniester line.\nIn 2013, it was planned to restore the outer coating of the monument to Alexander Suvorov, which suffered after cleaning from dust and other pollution. A few years ago, a major overhaul of the pedestal was carried out, on which cracks were found.\nMonument on symbols, banknotes and postage stamps\nThe Monument to Suvorov is one of the famous symbols of the city of Tiraspol and the whole of Transnistria.\nThe monument is depicted on the first banknotes of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 rubles of 1993, 5000 rubles of 1995, 500.000 rubles of 1997 release.\nIn 1997, a postage stamp of the PMR depicted the Monument to Suvorov with the literal denomination \"A\" and \"B\".\nIn 2013, a new postage stamp of Transnistria called the \"Monument to Suvorov in Tiraspol\" was issued with the letter denominations \"A\" and \"U\".\nReferences"
