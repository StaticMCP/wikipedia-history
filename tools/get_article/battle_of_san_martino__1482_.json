The battle was fought in swirling mists and, owing to their superior tactics, went the way of the Venetians.\nAfter the Battle of Solferino fought nearby in 1859, also sometimes known as the Battle of San Martino, the village of San Martino was renamed San Martino della Battaglia. Nowadays it is a frazione of the comune of Desenzano del Garda.\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060517214612/http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/se/~luv20009/SanMartinoReport.html Battle of San Martino 1482]"
