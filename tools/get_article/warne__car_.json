The car was launched in 1912 fitted with a JAP, V twin air-cooled engine of 964&nbsp;cc with an RAC horsepower rating of 8&nbsp;hp. but by the 1913 Olympia show the company had swapped to using F. E. Baker Ltd Precision 50 degree V-twin engines of 964cc. One model had the air cooled version of the engine, and the other used the water-cooled version.\nIn the original car the drive was to the rear wheels by belts, but the water-cooled version for 1913 had a 3-speed with reverse gearbox, the air-cooled version retaining the belt system. The suspension used half elliptic leaf springs all round.\nThe engine size increased to 1070&nbsp;cc in 1915.\nIt originally cost £99. The 1914 models with Precision engines were £120 for the air-cooled version and £130 for the water-cooled version. The air-cooled version was given a conventional appearance by fitting a dummy radiator.\nIn mid 1913 six cars a week were being made.\nSee also\n* List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom\nReferences"
