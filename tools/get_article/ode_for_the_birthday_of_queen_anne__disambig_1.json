It was probably composed during January 1713 for a performance on 6 February 1713, although there is no record of the performance having actually taken place. Other catalogues of Handel's music have referred to the work as HG xlvi A; and HHA i/6.\nOverview\nThe cantata celebrates Queen Anne's birthday, and the accomplishment of the Treaty of Utrecht (negotiated by the Tory ministry of Anne in 1712) to end the War of the Spanish Succession. It is scored for 3 solo voices, choir and chamber orchestra.\nQueen Anne was said by the Duke of Manchester to be \"too careless or too busy to listen to her own band, and had no thought of hearing and paying new players however great their genius or vast their skill.\" Nevertheless, and whether or not she ever heard this ode for her birthday, she granted Handel a \"pension\" (subsidy for living expenses) of two hundred pounds a year, for life.\nStructure\n]]\n, author of the text of \"Eternal Source of Light Divine\"]]\nEach of the seven stanzas of the ode concludes with the following words sung by the chorus:\n: The day that gave great Anna birth,\n: ''Who fix'd a lasting peace on Earth''.\n* (Alto solo with solo trumpet over sustained strings)\n:Eternal source of light divine\n:With double warmth thy beams display\n:And with distinguish'd glory shine\n:To add a lustre to this day.\n*(Alto solo, then chorus with orchestra)\n:The day that gave great Anna birth\n:Who fix'd a lasting peace on earth.\n*(Soprano solo, then chorus with orchestra)\n:Let all the winged race with joy\n:Their wonted homage sweetly pay\n:Whilst towr'ing in the azure sky\n:They celebrate this happy day.\n:The day that gave great Anna birth\n:Who fix'd a lasting peace on earth.\n*(Alto solo, then alto and soprano solo with chorus and orchestra)\n:Let flocks and herds their fear forget\n:Lions and wolves refuse their prey\n:And all in friendly consort meet\n:Made glad by this propitious day.\n:The day that gave great Anna birth\n:Who fix'd a lasting peace on earth.\n*(Bass and alto duet, then chorus with orchestra. The ground bass of this movement with octave leaps was reused by Handel in his \"Concerto a due cori\".)\n:Let rolling streams their gladness show\n:With gentle murmurs whilst they play\n:And in their wild meanders flow\n:Rejoicing in this blessed day.\n:The day that gave great Anna birth\n:Who fix'd a lasting peace on earth.\n* (Soprano and alto duet with solo oboe and orchestra)\n:Kind Health descends on downy wings\n:Angels conduct her on the way.\n:T'our glorious Queen new life she brings\n:And swells our joys upon this day.\n* (Alto and soprano, then chorus with orchestra)\n:The day that gave great Anna birth\n:Who fix'd a lasting peace on earth.\n* (Bass solo, then chorus with orchestra)\n:Let envy then conceal her head\n:And blasted faction glide away.\n:No more her hissing tongues we'll dread\n:Secure in this auspicious day.\n:The day that gave great Anna birth\n:Who fix'd a lasting peace on earth.\n* (Alto solo then chorus with echo effects, solo trumpet and orchestra)\n:United nations shall combine\n:To distant climes their sound convey\n:That Anna's actions are divine\n:And this the most important day!\n:The day that gave great Anna birth\n:Who fix'd a lasting peace on earth.\nNotable performances\nOn 23 August 2007, Kate Royal performed the aria \"Eternal source of light divine\" at the Proms.\nOn 19 May 2018, Elin Manahan Thomas performed the aria \"Eternal source of light divine\" as the bridal entry music for the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, accompanied by the event's orchestra and with David Blackadder playing the trumpet obbligato.\nSelected recordings\n*Alfred Deller (countertenor), Mary Thomas (soprano), Maurice Bevan (bass), Deller Consort, Oriana Concert Choir, Vienna Symphony Chamber Orchestra, Alfred Deller (conductor).
