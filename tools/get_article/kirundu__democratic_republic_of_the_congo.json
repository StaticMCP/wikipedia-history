It is on the right bank of the Lualaba River, upstream from Ubundu.\nIn the late nineteenth century the town was capital of a slaving state headed by Kibonge, from the Comoro Islands, who was joined by a young Arab named Said ben Adeb who had been expelled from Nyangwe after his father died.\nIn 1893 the Congo Free State officer Louis Napoléon Chaltin defeated the Swahili/Arab forces at Kirundu and expelled them from the Stanley Falls region.\nReferences"
