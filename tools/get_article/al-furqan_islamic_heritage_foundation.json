Since then it has published many works in the field of Islamic manuscripts, primary among them is the World Survey of Islamic Manuscripts, which catalogues manuscripts in over one hundred countries, and has been described as \"a pioneering work which includes hitherto unknown collections.\"\nTo support its research, al-Furqan established a reference library, which has over 10,000 volumes.\nReferences"
