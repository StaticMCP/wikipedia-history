In 2010, it was banned, making it the first instance of a political party being abolished for its ideology in the modern history of Czechia. Its representatives, including Vandas, subsequently shifted their membership to the Workers' Party of Social Justice (), founded in 2004.\nThe decision of the Supreme Administrative Court is a very important message for the entire Czech society. It is a message stating that the Czech Republic does not tolerate extremism. – Martin Pecina, Minister of the Interior of the Czech Republic\nElection results\nEuropean Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!
