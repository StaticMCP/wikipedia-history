It depicts a view from the castle at Kronborg on the island of Zealand across the Sound towards the Swedish coast in Scania. A key strategic stronghold in the Baltic Region, its importance is emphasised by the soldiers on duty and the prominent Danish flag. Two maids are also in the foreground, drying laundry. In the background a number of ships are visible in the Sound.\nEckersberg was one of the pioneers of the Golden Age of Danish Art.\nToday the painting is in the collection of the National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen, having been acquired in 1913.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Boime, Albert.
