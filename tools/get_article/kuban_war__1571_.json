Ivan the Terrible supported Temroqwa's goal to extend his power inside Circassia and to unify the lands of Circassians under his reign. Temroqwa established a fort in Mozdok that enabled the Circassian and Russian forces to perform joint training. Ossetian and Ingushetian lands, as well as the Turkic people, became subjects of the Kabardian raising power. Temroqwa's expansion extended towards the Georgian kingdoms in the south.\nIn 1571, the Tatars swept and burned Moscow. During their retreat, as revenge for having relations with Russia, Tatar forces marched towards northwestern Circassia in 1571.\nTemroqwa, against the advice of his counsellors, launched a counterattack. A battle took place on the banks of the Kuban where Temroqwa was killed and two of his sons, Mashoqwa and Bulat-Djery, were captured.\nReferences"
