The spacecraft was constructed by Mitsubishi Electric, and is the second of two similar satellites to be based on the DS-2000 bus.\nLaunch\nHimawari 9 was launched on 2 November 2016, 06:20:00 UTC, atop a H-IIA rocket flying from the Yoshinobu Launch Complex Pad 1 at the Tanegashima Space Center, and by 11 November 2016 it reached to the geostationary point at 140.7 degrees East.  After initial function tests, it was put on standby until 05:00 UTC by 13 December 2022, when it succeeded Himawari 8.\nThe launch was scheduled initially on 1 November 2016, but postponed for one day due to forecasted inclement weather.\nAt launch, the mass of the satellite is about . It has a design life of 15 years with 8 years of operational life. Power is supplied by a single gallium arsenide solar panel, which provides up to 2.6 kilowatts of power. The main instrument aboard Himawari 9 is a 16 channel multispectral imager to capture visible light and infrared images of the Asian-Pacific region.\nAs part of an outreach project organized by the Young Astronauts Club Japan the launch also carried manga artwork drawn by Chūya Koyama, author of the Space Brothers manga.\nGallery\nHimawari-9 full-disc 2017-01-24 0240Z.jpg|The first true-color image from Himawari 9\nHimawari 9 2022-12-14 0230Z.png|The first full disk true-color image from Himawari 9 since being operational\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.data.jma.go.jp/mscweb/en/index.html Meteorological Satellite Center of JMA]\n*[http://www.asahi.com/special/rocket/himawari/ Himawari 9 3D model] from Asahi Shinbun"
