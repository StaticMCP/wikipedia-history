It joined the Union for Change alliance, which won six seats in the 1994 general elections, although MUD did not receive any of the seats.\nThe Union for Change was reduced to three seats in the 1999–2000 general elections, and lost them all in the 2004 parliamentary elections, after which the MUD became inactive.\nReferences"
