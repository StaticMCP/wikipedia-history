The latter started in 1941, but for various reasons it only ended six years later in 1947, thus making it the longest tournament in the history of football.\n1940 FEF President Cup (Second Division)\n1941–47 FEF President Cup (First Division)\nFinal\nSilva\n|goals2 =\n|stadium = Metropolitano\n|location = Madrid\n|attendance =\n|referee = Iturralde\n}}\nOther tournaments\nThere are other tournaments, which were held between the 1930s and 1940s, with a similar name, Copa Presidente, but from the federations of the regional areas to which they belonged, such as the Copa Presidente Federación Castellana (1940–41 and 1943–44), or the Copa Presidente Federación Vasca, but they have nothing to do with this tournament and are competitions with a different format and of a regional character.\nSee also\n*Copa Federación Centro\n*Copa de los Campeones de España\n*Copa Eva Duarte\nReferences"
