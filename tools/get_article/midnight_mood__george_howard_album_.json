The album reached No. 5 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Albums chart and No. 7 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart.\nCritical reception\n}}\nAlex Henderson of AllMusic gave the album a 3 out of 5 star rating. Henderson exclaimed \"For George Howard, Midnight Mood is business as usual, and not in a good sense...From the vacuous, knee-jerk elevator music of \"Still in Love\" and \"Within Your Eyes\" to a robotic cover of D'Angelo's R&B hit \"Smooth,\" Howard sees to it that every note is in place and is careful to avoid any type of spontaneity. \"\nReferences"
