He was appointed to the Kansas House of Representatives in 1975, to fill out the remainder of the term for a seat left vacant by the resignation of George Van Bebber.\nGordon served in the Kansas House until 1982, when the death of John E. Chandler left the 1st senate district open. Gordon was appointed to that seat and won re-election in his own right in 1984. He was succeeded in the Senate by Don Sallee.\nReferences"
