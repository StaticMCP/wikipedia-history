She attended the local Academy of Fine Arts starting in 1924. Afterwards she worked at Metz & Co, where she met a fabric designer hired by the company, Sonia Delaunay, and became influenced by Delaunay's style.\nShe moved to Paris in 1929, where she studied at Académie de la Grande Chaumière and met emigre painters such as Mondrian and Georges Vantongerloo. She was interested in Goethe's Theory of Colours and like Mondrian studied Theosophy, following the spiritualist Rudolf Steiner. In 1930, she published her artistic manifesto, Aperçus et pen-sées sur la peinture abstraite (Insights and Thoughts on Abstract Painting), where she laid out her ideas for the moral, and spiritual role of abstract art (“Abstract art immerses one in an atmosphere of joy and tranquility.”)\nShe married the painter Francis Nicolas in 1942, and adopted his last name as part of a new masculine pseudonym, believing that critics didn't take women artists seriously.\nUpon establishing Société Réalités Nouvelles in 1946, Warb joined it and took part in Salon des Réalités Nouvelles yearly. She also joined Groupe Espace, took part in group exhibitions of abstract art and had two solo exhibitions, in 1947 and 1954.\nShe died in 1957 of cancer, and the critic Michel Seuphor wrote in his obituary that “(She was) seeking to introduce spirituality into geometric form“. After death, she had a solo retrospective of her works in Galerie Maria de Beyrie in 1974. Her works are held in the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, the Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles.\nReferences"
