She often played dowagers or spinsters in numerous Hollywood movies of the 1930s and 1940s, mostly in minor roles.\nLife and career\nEdwards started her acting career as a stage actress, she was described in 1916 by a newspaper article as a leading actress \"very popular with West End theatre-goers\".\nShe eventually settled in the United States and appeared in six Broadway plays between 1919 and 1931, primarily in comedies like The Merry Malones by George M. Cohan. Among her first movies was the New York-filmed 1929 musical Glorifying the American Girl (1929), where she portrayed the mercenary mother of the character played by lead actress Mary Eaton. She came to Hollywood in the mid-1930s where she appeared in about 190 films until her retirement 1951, mostly in uncredited, small character roles. Edwards died in Hollywood in 1965, aged 83.\nEdwards seemed older than she was and often portrayed a \"kindly grandmother, imperious dowager, hardy pioneer wife, ill-tempered teacher and strict governess\". She remains perhaps best-known to modern audiences as the imperious mother of Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) in Frank Capra's film classic ''It's a Wonderful Life'' (1946) who tries to keep her daughter away from George Bailey. Edwards also played a customer in Ernst Lubitsch's The Shop Around the Corner (1940) with James Stewart. She also appeared in another Christmas classic, ''The Bishop's Wife'' (1947) with Cary Grant, and as the wife of a doctor on the train in Hitchcock's  thriller Shadow of a Doubt (1943). Edwards sometimes also portrayed more substantial roles, for instance in the Charlie Chan movie Charlie Chan in the Secret Service (1944).\nPartial filmography\n* Glorifying the American Girl (1929) - Mrs. Hughes\n* Wayward (1932) - Nurse (uncredited)\n* American Madness (1932) - Gossip on Phone (uncredited)\n* Smarty (1934) - Mrs. Crosby's Mother (uncredited)\n* Side Streets (1934) - Second Customer (uncredited)\n* The World Accuses (1934) - Lucille Weymouth\n* Sweepstake Annie (1935) - Friend of Mrs. Foster (uncredited)\n* Shadow of Doubt (1935) - Dowager in Taxi (uncredited)\n* Ruggles of Red Gap (1935) - Mrs. Myron Carey (uncredited)\n* People Will Talk (1935) - Martie Beemish\n* Man on the Flying Trapeze (1935) - Motorcar Owner (uncredited)\n* Welcome Home (1935) - Mrs. Edwards\n* Anna Karenina (1935) - Wife - Second Couple (uncredited)\n* The Dark Angel (1935) - Josephine Bidley (uncredited)\n* I Live My Life (1935) - Professor Douglas (uncredited)\n* Two-Fisted (1935) - Abigail Adams\n* ''It's in the Air (1935) - Old Maid (uncredited)\n* Stars Over Broadway (1935) - Woman Dancing with Fat Man (uncredited)\n* One Way Ticket (1935) - Miss Aldridge (uncredited)\n* Miss Pacific Fleet (1935) - Woman with Mrs. Freytag in Snuggle-Up Inn (uncredited)\n* Dangerous Intrigue (1936) - Superintendent of Nurses (uncredited)\n* The Walking Dead (1936) - Female Doctor - Guest at Party (uncredited)\n* Colleen (1936) - First Society Woman (uncredited)\n* The Great Ziegfeld (1936) - Wardrobe Woman (uncredited)\n* Moonlight Murder (1936) - Autograph Seeker (uncredited)\n* The Golden Arrow (1936) - Mrs. Meyers\n* Early to Bed (1936) - Miss Barton (uncredited)\n* Palm Springs (1936) - Miss Pinchon\n* My American Wife (1936) - Townswoman (uncredited)\n* Two-Fisted Gentleman'' (1936) - Mrs. O'Shea\n* The General Died at Dawn (1936) - American's Companion (uncredited)\n* Stage Struck (1936) - Schoolteacher at Aquarium (uncredited)\n* Theodora Goes Wild (1936) - Mrs. Moffat (uncredited)\n* ''We're on the Jury (1937) - Miss Evelyn Bottomley\n* Maytime (1937) - Minor Role (uncredited)\n* The Jones Family in Big Business (1937) - Miss Collins - School Principal (uncredited)\n* Public Wedding (1937) - Mrs. J.P.
