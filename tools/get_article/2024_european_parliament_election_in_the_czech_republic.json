This was the fifth parliamentary election since the Czech Republic's EU accession in 2004, and the first to take place after Brexit.\nElectoral system\nThe 21 members were elected through semi-open list proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency with seats allocated through D'Hondt method and a 5% electoral threshold for both single parties and coalitions of two or more parties.\nBoth Czech and EU citizens were entitled to vote in the European election in Czech Republic provided they had a permanent or temporary residence in the country at least 45 days prior to the elections. In addition, those eligible to vote had to be 18 years old by the second election day at the latest. Voter registration was required only for non-Czech EU citizens residing in Czech Republic, while Czech citizens were automatically registered in their place of residence. Citizens abroad were not able to vote by post or in Czech diplomatic missions, but may have been eligible to vote in another EU member country.\nBackground and previous election\nThe previous elections to the European Parliament were held in the Czech Republic on 24–25 May 2019. Voter turnout was 28.72%. The parties and candidates elected were:\n*ANO 2011: 21.18% of votes and 6 seats (Dita Charanzová, Martina Dlabajová, Martin Hlaváček, Radka Maxová, Ondřej Knotek and Ondřej Kovařík)\n*ODS: 14.54% of votes and 4 seats (Jan Zahradil, Alexandr Vondra, Evžen Tošenovský and Veronika Vrecionová)\n*Pirates: 13.95% of votes and 3 seats (Marcel Kolaja, Markéta Gregorová and Mikuláš Peksa),\n*STAN-TOP 09 joint list: 11.65% of votes and 3 seats (Luděk Niedermayer, Jiří Pospíšil and Stanislav Polčák),\n*SPD: 9.14% of votes and 2 seats (Hynek Blaško and Ivan David),\n*KDU-ČSL: 7.24% of votes and 2 seats (Tomáš Zdechovský and Michaela Šojdrová),\n*KSČM: 6.94% of votes and 1 seat (Kateřina Konečná).\nIn October 2020, Radka Maxová resigned from ANO, and in March 2021, she started cooperating as a non-party member with the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD), which had not won any seats in the previous election. In September 2022, Hynek Blaško resigned from SPD and now sits in the EP as an independent.\nIn June 2022, the only STAN MEP, Stanislav Polčák, announced he was suspending his membership in the party, following allegations that he was a member of corruption group led by his party colleague Petr Hlubuček. A year later, Polčák resumed his membership after the Czech police decided not to charge him with any criminal offence.\nOutgoing delegation\nThe table shows the detailed composition of the Czech seats at the European Parliament as of 25 January 2024.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|EP Group\n!Seats\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Seats\n!MEPs\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Renew Europe\n|rowspan=\"2\"|}}\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|ANO 2011\n|align=center|3\n|\n|-\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|Independents\n|align=center|2\n|\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\" rowspan=\"3\"|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|European People's Party\n|rowspan=\"3\"|}}\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|TOP 09\n|align=center|2\n|\n|-\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|KDU-ČSL\n|align=center|2\n|\n|-\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|Mayors and Independents\n|align=center|1\n|\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|European Conservatives and Reformists\n|}}\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|Civic Democratic Party\n|align=center|4\n|\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Greens–European Free Alliance\n|}}\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|Czech Pirate Party\n|align=center|3\n|\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats\n|}}\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|Independents\n|align=center|1\n|\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Identity and Democracy\n|}}\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|Freedom and Direct Democracy\n|align=center|1\n|\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|The Left in the European Parliament – GUE/NGL\n|}}\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia\n|align=center|1\n|\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\"|\n|Non-Inscrits\n|}}\n| style=\"color:inherit;background:;\"|\n|Independents\n|align=center|1\n|\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"\n|colspan=5 align=left |Total\n|align=center|21\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" | Source: [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/it/home European Parliament]\n|}\nRunning parties\nThe following parties and coalitions running in the European elections were represented in the Chamber of Deputies or in the European Parliament in time of the election:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

According to reports, the ODS and TOP 09 memberships would prefer to run independently, while ODS leader and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala favours a joint candidacy as SPOLU. A combined list under the SPOLU banner is problematic due to the fact that ODS is part of the European Conservatives and Reformists EP grouping, while KDU-ČSL and TOP 09 are part of the European People's Party. Sitting MEP and ODS' 2019 electoral leader Jan Zahradil was reported to be problematic for KDU-ČSL and TOP 09, as well as many ODS members such as MP Eva Decroix. On 5 June 2023, Zahradil announced that he would not run in the election. Alexandr Vondra has also been speculated as a potential lead candidate for ODS or SPOLU as whole.\nOn 18 May 2023, members of KDU-ČSL voted in a membership referendum in favor of running independently. On 20 May 2023, KDU-ČSL decided at its nomination conference that its lead candidate for the 2024 elections will be current MEP Tomáš Zdechovský. Other candidates will include: František Talíř, the 1st Deputy Governor of the South Bohemian Region; MEP Michaela Šojdrová; Ondřej Mikmek, mayor of Slatinice in Olomouc; senator and twice presidential candidate Pavel Fischer; and MP Hayato Okamura. A decision over whether KDU-ČSL will run independently or as part of the SPOLU alliance will be made by September 2023.\nOn 30 October 2023, ODS, TOP 09 and KDU-ČSL announced that they will contest the election on a joint list.\nCzech Pirate Party\nThe Czech Pirate Party launched primaries for its election list on 30 May 2023. All incumbent MEPs (Mikuláš Peksa, Markéta Gregorová and Marcel Kolaja) announced their intention to run for the position of electoral leader. Former MP Mikuláš Ferjenčík also announced his candidacy, and received the endorsements of Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Lipavský and former Mayor of Prague Zdeněk Hřib. 2019 electoral leader Marcel Kolaja soon criticised Ferjenčík, stating that the leader should be a respected politician. The fifth candidate is Jana Kolaříková, chair of the South Bohemian branch of the party.\nANO\nMP and former government minister Klára Dostálová is speculated to become the lead candidate for ANO 2011. 2019 electoral leader Dita Charanzová was reportedly undecided whether to run again. Party leader Andrej Babiš was also reported to be considering his own candidacy.\nSTAN\nLeader of Mayors and Independents (STAN) Vít Rakušan suggested Jan Farský as his party's electoral leader.\nČSSD\nFormer Czech Prime Minister Jiří Paroubek has announced his intention to run in the election with his Nespokojení (Dissatisfied) movement, with the aim of connecting parties on the left of the political spectrum.\nSEN21+Volt\nIn October 2023, Volt and SEN21 announced that they would be standing in the European elections with a joint list. The head of their joint list is Lenka Koenigsmark.\nPRO 2022\nOn 8 April 2024, ice hockey coach and former professional player Vladimír Růžička announced his candidacy for PRO 2022.\nCampaign\nThe official campaign began on 26 January 2024, when Czech president Petr Pavel announced the official date of the election. From that date, no party or coalition can spend more than 50 million crowns on campaign promotion and must create a transparent bank account within five days.\nParties\nANO\nANO 2011 started its campaign in Zlín, where party leader Andrej Babiš and election list lead candidate Klára Dostálová presented the party's priorities: Czech sovereignty, European self-reliance, and cutting back the European Green Deal. The party also said it wants to curb illegal immigration, lessen the EU's impact on daily life, and will oppose the adoption of the Euro. ANO stated that its goal is to win at least six seats.\nThe party announced its slogan as \"Česko, pro tebe všecko\" (English: \"Czechia, everything for you\"), accompanied by pictures of Babiš and Dostálová with Czech flags painted on their cheeks. ODS bought the web domain of the slogan, and placed there a manipulated version of the graphic, featuring the slogan changed to \"Rusko, pro tebe všecko” (English: \"Russia, everything for you\") and Russian flags instead. President Petr Pavel subsequently criticized both sides for the conduct of their campaigns, calling them \"unfair and dangerous\".\nSPOLU\nSPOLU launched its campaign in Prague, in the café of Činoherní klub, where the Civic Forum was founded around 30 years earlier. The launch was led by the leaders of the constituent parties - Petr Fiala, Markéta Pekarová Adamová and Marian Jurečka - as well as the list leader, ODS MEP Alexandr Vondra.\nThe alliance restated that it was an umbrella movement for conservatives, economic liberals and Christian democrats. As its slogan, it chose \"Bezpečná Evropa, silnější Česko\" (English: \"Safe Europe, stronger Czechia\") and framed the election as a \"clash between democratic parties and one-man projects\". Vondra said that the alliance's goal is to win the election.\nVondra said Spolu would push for modifications of the European Green Deal. As lead priorities he named defense and security, handling of immigration into Europe, and \"kickstarting the European economy\". He also said that wanted to replicate the \"great Danish immigration model\" and ease regulations concerning the manufacture of heavy weapons.\nSTAN\nMayors and Independents launched their campaign before all other parties, with their leader Vít Rakušan starting a series of \"Debates without censorship\" in January, where he visited less-developed regions, mostly in the former Sudetenland, to answer questions from the local public. Some experts criticized these events, accusing Rakušan of using low-income people to gain popularity. Others praised Rakušan for creating opportunities for dialogue.\nWhile the early debates were not a formal part of the European election campaign, they were financed from STAN's EP election funds from the beginning. In April, Rakušan passed the debates to the leaders of STAN's candidate list, Jan Farský and Danuše Nerudová. The debates also moved to larger cities like Brno.\nAs STAN's priorities, Nerudová mentioned fighting climate change, lowering the minimum voting age to 16, making the EU more accessible for young people, and preventing illegal migration. She also said they want to focus on lowering economical inequality between regions, help Europe’s competitiveness and lowering bureaucracy.\nPirates\nThe Pirates launched their campaign on the last day of April, stating that they intend to focus on digitalization, improving quality of life, and fighting corruption and tax havens. The also mentioned support for abortion rights and LGBTQ+ rights, as well as lowering the inequality between EU regions. The party also proposed \"fixing\" the European Green Deal. As their goal, the party stated that it wants to win three to four seats.\nBoth party leader Ivan Bartoš and list leader Marcel Kolaja criticised the political regimes in Hungary and Slovakia, calling their prime ministers \"merchants of fear\" who \"push society towards the east\". They also criticised some Czech parties, like ODS, for keeping ties with parties within the ECR faction.\nSPD and Tricolour\nSPD began its campaign as a series of meetings with voters and supporters, at which the party presented its candidates and manifesto. The meetings were intended to gain traction for a planned demonstration on Prague's Wenceslas Square, however, only about 1,000 people attended, far less than similar demonstrations in the two previous years. During the speech of SPD leader Tomio Okamura at the demonstration, opponents threw eggs at him, and were subsequently arrested.\nThe leaders of the two parties said their goal was to attract dissatisfied ODS voters, arguing that ODS had abandoned its Eurosceptic policies and switched to support for the Green Deal, EU migration pact and euro adoption. SPD said they want to attract voters by focusing on an economic issues, and by giving the lead spot to economist and former Svobodní MEP Petr Mach.\nMEPs not standing for re-election\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Party\n!Date announced\n!Source\n|-\n|Jan Zahradil\n|Civic Democratic Party (ECR)\n|5 June 2023\n|\n|-\n|Radka Maxová\n|Independent (S&D)\n|31 October 2023\n|\n|-\n|Stanislav Polčák\n|Mayors and Independents (EPP)\n|3 January 2024\n|\n|-\n|Evžen Tošenovský\n|Civic Democratic Party (ECR)\n|5 April 2024\n|\n|}\nResults\n|party12=Alliance for the Independence of the Czech Republic|votes12=14910|seats12=0|sc12=0\n|party13=Democratic Party of Greens – For Animal Rights|votes13=12448|seats13=0|sc13=0\n|party14=|votes14= 10767 |seats14=0|sc14=New|color14=#0101A1\n|party15=SEN 21 and Volt|votes15=9955|seats15=0|sc15=New\n|party16=Czech Sovereignty of Social Democracy|votes16=7579|seats16=0|sc16=0\n|party17=Czech Republic in First Place!|votes17=6897|seats17=0|sc17=New\n|party18=|votes18=6759|seats18=0|sc18=New|color18=#4D4D4D\n|party19=|votes19=6541|seats19=0|sc19=New\n|party20=|votes20=6479|seats20=0|sc20=New|color20=#4FC554\n|party21=Hlas|votes21=6328|seats21=0|sc21=0\n|party22=Club of Committed Non-Party Members|votes22=4561|seats22=0|sc22=0\n|party23=FOR CZEXIT|votes23=3912|seats23=0|sc23=0\n|party24=Right Bloc|votes24=3392|seats24=0|sc24=0\n|party25=Swiss Democracy and |votes25=2559|seats25=0|sc25=New\n|party26=Urza.cz|votes26=2426|seats26=0|sc26=New\n|party27=The Left|votes27=2296|seats27=0|sc27=New\n|party28=|votes28=2036|seats28=0|sc28=New|color28=#D1A2A2\n|party29=|votes29=1563|seats29=0|sc29=New|color29=#CB5B5C\n|party30=|votes30=1067|seats30=0|sc3O=New|color30=#0C7E98\n|invalid=24339\n|total_sc=0\n|electorate=8212628\n|source=[https://www.volby.cz/pls/ep2024/ep?xjazyk=CZ]}}\nEuropean groups\nFollowing the election, ANO 2011 left ALDE and the Renew Europe group, and subsequently co-founded Patriots for Europe.
