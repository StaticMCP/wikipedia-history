R. R. Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings, may have taken inspiration from the ferry here for the Bucklebury Ferry over the Brandywine river in his book, as it was still operational when Tolkien visited nearby Stonyhurst College.\nSee also\n*Grade I listed buildings in Lancashire\n*Listed buildings in Billington and Langho\nReferences"
