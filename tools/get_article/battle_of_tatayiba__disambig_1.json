The Brazilians, outnumbering the Paraguayans nearly 3 to 2, were victorious.\nA trap was set by the Brazilian cavalry in order to stop the daily sorties by Lt. Col. Caballero's Paraguayan cavalry. Hiding their main force in the woods, a few Brazilians lured the Paraguayan cavalry on a three-mile chase. The Paraguayans were surrounded at Tatayibá, with only a few making it back to Humaitá. Caballero was promoted to colonel and a medal ordered for his survivors.\nReferences"
