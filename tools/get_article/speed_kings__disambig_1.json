IGN said, \"We wouldn't exactly crown Acclaim's motorcycle racer as videogame royalty.\" Eurogamer complained that the textures were \"bland and blurry\" and the scenery leaves no \"lasting impression\". But the bikes and riders are \"suitably detailed\" and \"the crashes look sufficiently bone-shattering.\" Eurogamer said it \"isn't a terrible game - it's just that it's so easily ignored.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
