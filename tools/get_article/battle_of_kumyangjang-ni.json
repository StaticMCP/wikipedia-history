The conflict is also referred to as the Battle of Geumyangjang-ri and Hill 151 as of it initiation upon Hill 151.\nBackground\nThe Turkish Brigade, mobilized to Korea as a reservation force primarily commanded by the United Nations, initiated combat against the PVA forces in skirmishes referred to as the Battle of Kunu-ri due to the destruction of the II Corps at Wawon on 28 November 1950.\nOperation Thunderbolt\nThe United Nations Army initiated an offensive between January 25 and February 20, 1951, with Operation \"Thunderbolt\". In accordance to the order received on January 6, 1951 on offensive reconnaissance (Armed Recon.), the 2nd Battalion of the Turkish Brigade was requested to annex Geumyangjan-ri and the Hill 151 around Geumyangjang-ri occupied by the PVA forces.\nBattle\nAfter remaining within reserve for 20 days in Cheonan on January 6, 1951, the Turkish Brigade units mobilized from Cheonan on January 24 and established an attack to annex a partition of the defensive mobilizations of the PVA forces. They engaged in conflict with the 447th and 448th Regiments of the 150th Division of the PVA forces defending the vicinity. Initially, the Chinese infantries had received the advantage as of to their hilltop defensive mobilization, however were unable to maintain their superiority in weaponry. While the Chinese had low hand grenade supply, the Turkish Brigade possessed more. One of the reasons for this was the support of the US with weapons and ammunition. Furthermore, with CAS opportunities and frequent tank offensives from the US troops, the Turkish infantries made rapid progress.\nDuring the initial stages of the battle, the Chinese, already in position, established an effective barrage. However, the Turkish 1st Battalion, previously positioned, advanced toward the Chinese positions unseen and occupied them by utilizing hand grenades. As the Chinese struggled to recuperate the positions in this area, the Turkish 2nd Battalion annexed Hill 151, utilizing a bayonet charge. The regimental assault group easily annexed the town of Geumyangjang-ri on January 27, 1951.\nAftermath\nThis victory both moralized the infantries and aided in the hopes of success in opposition with the Chinese. While the authority of the Eighth Army had already coordinated plans for retreat and even evacuation, this victory provided him with the opportunity to order and coordinate an offensive. Turkish infantries suffered 12 deaths and 31 wounded. Chinese infantries would suffer 474 deaths and 23 prisoners. However, historian Clay Blair reports that US investigations only about 154 Chinese fatalities on the hill, most of them killed by artillery offensives under Barth's authority preceding the Turkish offensive.\nSee also\n*Military history of China\n*Military history of Turkey\n*Military history of the United States\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110628202710/http://www.korean-war.com/turkey.html Turkish Brigade]"
