During the war the Netherlands was largely pro-Boer, and some 2000 Dutch volunteers traveled to South Africa to fight for the two Boer republics. This support from the Dutch was due to the relationship between the Dutch and the Afrikaners (also called the Boers) who were mostly descended from the former Dutch colonists in South Africa.\nDuring and after the Second Boer War  a number of monuments were erected in the Netherlands to commemorate this war.\nThe following list is not complete.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:3em;\" |Monument\n! style=\"width:3em;\" |Year of Construction\n! style=\"width:16em;\" |Depicted person/In honour of\n! style=\"width:15em;\" |Place\n! style=\"width:20em;\" |Comment\n|-\n|                                                                              }}\n|1899–present\n|Places where a district, neighbourhood, or streets are named after a person from the Orange Free State or the South African Republic.\n|Found throughout the Netherlands\n|Since 1899, there are streets throughout the Netherlands which are named after Afrikaners from the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. This is the result not only of widespread Dutch support for the Boer cause, but also from the visit and travels of presidents Paul Kruger (in 1900–01), Martinus Theunis Steyn (in 1903), and the generals Louis Botha, Koos de la Rey, and Christiaan de Wet (all in 1903) as well as general and later prime minister of the Union of South Africa, Jan Smuts, in 1948.\n|-\n|\n| 1900\n| De Transvaalsche Boer (The Transvaal Boer)\nSouth African Republic\n| Gasthuismolensteeg 20\nAmsterdam\n| In 1900 the building on Gasthuismolensteeg was renovated and the cigar shop De Transvaalsche Boer (The Transvaal Boer) was established there. A small statue of the Transvaal Boer by Johann Zeitz was also added there in commemoration of the war.\n|-\n|\n| 1901\n| Portraits of four Boer leaders\nOrange Free State\nSouth African Republic\n| Blekerssingel\nGouda\n| On the residences the Wapen van Amsterdam there are four portraits of different leaders of the two Boer republics. Depicted are Marthinus Theunis Steyn (president of the Orange Free State), Piet Retief (a Voortrekker leader), Paul Kruger (president of the South African Republic) and Petrus Jacobus Joubert (general). The fifth portrait is not a Boer leader, but rather an advocate that assisted the former owner of the building in a civil procedure. These portraits hang above the windows and door of the three houses. The sculptures were made by Christiaan Petrus Clemens (1842–88).\n|-\n|\n| 1901\n| Plaque to commemorate Herman Coster\nSouth African Republic\n| Academiegebouw\nLeiden\n| At the entrance of the Academiegebouw of the Leiden University there is a plaque in commemoration of Leiden alumni Herman Coster who died in the Battle of Elandslaagte in 1899. Coster was a state's advocate of the South African Republic between 1895 and 1897.\n|-\n|\n| 1921\n| Christiaan de Wet\nGeneral\nSeventh and last president\nOrange Free State\n| Otterlose Zand\nHoge Veluwe National Park\n| On the plinth other Boer soldiers are also depicted.
