It is tentatively scheduled for the fixed election date of October 4, 2027, but may be held earlier under certain circumstances.\nElection date\nPEI's fixed election date law, passed in 2008, requires a general election to be held on the first Monday in October of the fourth calendar year following the previous general election. However, the law does not override the constitutional powers of the province's lieutenant governor to dissolve the Legislature and hold new elections at any time. Under the principles of responsible government, the lieutenant governor only calls elections on the advice of the premier or in response to the failure of a confidence vote in the Legislature. Thus it generally remains the premier's prerogative to call elections early, and premiers are often criticized for doing so for political advantage. Of PEI's four general elections held since the fixed date was passed into law, only one has been held on the fixed date; the other three were called early.\nTimeline\nMembership changes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=7|Membership changes in the 67th Assembly\n|-\n!\n!Date\n!Name\n!District\n!Party\n!Reason\n|April 3, 2023\n|colspan=2|See List of Members\n|Election day of the 2023 Prince Edward Island general election\n|November 11, 2023\n|Jamie Fox\n|Borden-Kinkora\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Resigned to run for Malpeque seat, in the 2025 federal election\n|February 7, 2024\n|Matt MacFarlane\n|Borden-Kinkora\n|Green\n|Won by-election\n|-\n|February 11, 2025\n|Natalie Jameson\n|Charlottetown-Hillsborough Park\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Resigned to run for Charlottetown seat, in the 2025 federal election\n|-\n|February 21, 2025\n|Dennis King\n|Brackley-Hunter River\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Resigned; later appointed Ambassador to Ireland\n|-\n|August 12, 2025\n|Carolyn Simpson\n|Charlottetown-Hillsborough Park\n|Liberal\n|Won by-election\n|-\n|August 12, 2025\n|Kent Dollar\n|Brackley-Hunter River\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Won by-election\n|October 3, 2025\n|Steven Myers\n|Georgetown-Pownal\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Resigned\n|}\n2023\n*April 3: General election held.
