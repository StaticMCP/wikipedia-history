The Portuguese fleet consisted of 80 ships and 2,300 soldiers. After sacking Suakin, the governor detached 16 light oarvessels and 250 picked men. The aim was to attack Suez but the attack was a failure as the heavy defence as well as the opposition of Davud Pasha and the Ottoman artillery forced the Portuguese to retreat. A few retreating Portuguese forces which landed at Massawa would be ambushed by the Adal Sultanate at the Battle of Massawa in the same year.\nFor the duration of the 1541 Suez campaign, the Portuguese remained within the Red Sea for seven months, never being confronted by the Ottoman navy, while Muslim trade was paralysed.\nSee also\n*Battle of Suakin (1541)\n*Battle of El Tor\n*Attack on Jeddah (1541)\nReferences"
