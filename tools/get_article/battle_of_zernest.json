In 1690 he launched another campaign. The Sultan gave him command of a 16,000-men (mostly Ottomans, Tatars, and some Kurucs) army with which he penetrated into Transylvania. He was later joined by Wallachian Voivode Constantin Brâncoveanu with a few thousand troops.\nBrâncoveanu was the true master-mind of the campaign and managed to pass the Ottoman army through the Carpathians on barely known mountain-passes and so bypassing the Bran Pass which was defended and fortified by the Imperial army. Donat Heissler was as such forced to give battle near the city of Zărnești.\nIn the battle fought near this city, the combined Ottoman army decisively defeated the united Habsburg–Transylvanian army and captured Donat Heissler. Transylvanian count Mihály Teleki was killed in action.\nAftermath\nFollowing this victory, a Diet called in Kereszténysziget elected Imre Thököly Prince of Transylvania. Nevertheless, he could only maintain his position against the Habsburg armies with the utmost difficulty. In 1691 he quit Transylvania altogether.\nThough Imre Thököly's reign was short-lived, it forced the Imperial army to move troops from Serbia to take back Transylvania, as from Transylvania, Hungary and the Imperial supply and communication lines could have been attacked. This movement of troops made it possible for the Ottomans to push the Holy League's army back across the Danube and even recapture the Banat. As a result, a stable front was made on the Danube river and on the Carpathian Mountains.\nSources\n* [http://enciclopediaromaniei.ro/wiki/B%C4%83t%C4%83lia_de_la_Z%C4%83rne%C5%9Fti-Tohani_(11/21_august_1690) Enciclopedia Romaniei]\n* [https://xn--tudorduic-transsylvanica-3xc.ro/istorie-transilvania/11-21-august-1690-batalia-de-la-zarnesti-tohani-zernyesti-csata-schlacht-bei-zernescht/ Tudor Duică: Transsylvanica]"
