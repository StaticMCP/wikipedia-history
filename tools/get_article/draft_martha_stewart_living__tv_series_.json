It debuted as a weekly half-hour syndicated program in September 1993. Intended to complement the magazine Martha Stewart Living, the program featured Stewart as host of each episode where she presented segments on things such as cooking, gardening, craft making and decorating.  It expanded to weekdays in 1997, became a full hour-long program in 1999 (with a 30-minute weekend edition) and went on hiatus in autumn of 2004 following Stewart's stock trading case and conviction.\nThe show was distributed by Group W Productions from 1993 to 1995, Eyemark Entertainment from 1995 to 2000 following the CBS-Westinghouse merger, then King World Productions from 2000 to 2004 following CBS' merger with King World. It was succeeded by The Martha Stewart Show after Stewart's release from prison in 2005 and ran until it was cancelled in 2012.\nIn 2004, the program won its fifth Daytime Emmy Award for best service show.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*http://marthamoments.blogspot.com/2007/04/martha-stewart-sold-her-longtime.html"
