On 31 January 1987, the town was created to encompass the whole of the urbanised area around the Whitsunday Coast, replacing the separate towns of Airlie (within the locality of Airlie Beach), Cannonvale (within the locality of the same name) and Shutehaven (within the locality of Shute Harbour) in addition to the locality of Jubilee (now Jubilee Pocket).\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Whitsunday. The nearest government primary school is Cannonvale State School in Cannonvale to the west. The nearest government secondary school is Proserpine State High School in Proserpine to the south-west.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://gisservices.information.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/directories/historicalscans/cad_scans/cad-map-town-whitsunday-sh1-1981.jpg Town map (western part, around Cannonvale)]\n* [https://gisservices.information.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/directories/historicalscans/cad_scans/cad-map-town-whitsunday-sh2-1980.jpg Town map (centre part, around Airlie Beach)]\n* [https://gisservices.information.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/directories/historicalscans/cad_scans/cad-map-town-whitsunday-sh3-1982.jpg Town map (eastern part, around Shute Harbour)]"
