These ceremonies were in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada during the weekend ending 18 April 2010. Primary ceremonies were held at the Mile One Centre and at Prince Edward Plaza on George Street. This also marks the first time to not feature a host.\nApril Wine was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, Bryan Adams received the Allan Waters Humanitarian Award for his part in numerous charitable concerts and campaigns during his career. Ross Reynolds, an original board member of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and former head of Universal Music Canada received the Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award.\nCARAS, the association responsible for the awards, awarded the 2010 ceremonies to the Newfoundland and Labrador capital based on a bid which included government support commitments totalling $1.5 million (), half funded by the province, $250,000 from the St. John's municipal government and the remainder from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.\nEvents\nPreliminary award-related events, known as Juno Week, began on 12 April 2010 with a launch event at the Confederation Building. Activities during this time included concerts such as JunoFest and the Juno Cup charity hockey game.\nOn 17 April, the Juno Fan Fare event featured artist interviews, prizes and opportunities for the public to meet musicians. However, some artists such as Alexisonfire were unable to attend when fog conditions that weekend delayed air travel into St. John's. The fog delays also cancelled some concerts the previous evening, and disrupted rehearsals for the main Sunday broadcast.\nAlso on that Saturday, winners in 32 Juno categories were announced at a special gala dinner at the St. John's Convention Centre. On the following day, prior to the main awards broadcast, a Songwriters' Circle concert was hosted by Dallas Green then broadcast on CBC Radio 2.\nPrimary ceremony\nThe primary awards ceremony on 18 April 2010 was telecast by CTV from Mile One Centre and from an outdoor venue on George Street, featuring multiple hosts and presenters.\nClassified began the proceedings with \"Oh... Canada\" from the George Street venue. Bryan Adams could not attend in person due to the air travel disruption from the Icelandic ash cloud incident; he therefore received his Allan Waters Humanitarian Award via satellite.\nOther artists performing at the ceremonies broadcast were Justin Bieber, Billy Talent, Blue Rodeo, Michael Bublé, Drake, Great Lake Swimmers, K'naan with Young Artists for Haiti, Metric and Johnny Reid.\nAward presenters and personalities included:\n* Musicians Barenaked Ladies, Jully Black, Jarvis Church, Terri Clark, Alex Cuba, Amelia Curran, deadmau5, Lights, Damhnait Doyle, Danny Fernandes, Great Big Sea, Dallas Green, Hedley, Carly Rae Jepsen, Shiloh, Stereos, Kim Stockwood, The Trews, Nikki Yanofsky\n* Barry Stock (Three Days Grace), hosted April Wine's induction to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame\n* Alexandre Bilodeau and Jon Montgomery (2010 Winter Olympics gold medallists)\n* Television personalities Luther Brown (judge, So You Think You Can Dance Canada), Leah Miller (eTalk), Seamus O'Regan (Canada AM)\n* James Moore (Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages)\nThe following seven categories were awarded during the main broadcast:\n* Album of the Year\n* Fan Choice Award\n* Group of the Year\n* New Artist of the Year\n* Rap Recording of the Year\n* Single of the Year\n* Songwriter of the Year\nRebroadcasts of the Juno Awards telecast were scheduled for A, Bravo!, MuchMore, Star! in late April.\nChanges to nomination categories for 2010\nChanges were made to the following award categories for this year's nominations:\n* Country Album of the Year – formerly known as Country Recording of the Year, this category is now limited to complete albums and single songs may no longer be nominated.\n* Music DVD of the Year and Vocal Jazz Album of the Year – voting on these categories is now fully conducted by appointed juries, with the winners no longer voted by the overall CARAS membership.\n* Pop Album of the Year and Rock Album of the Year – nominees for these categories are now determined according to an equal weighting of sales figures and jury vote.
