James W. Fannin and the Mexican Army commanded by Mexican General Jose de Urrea. Eventually surrounded and outnumbered, Fannin surrendered to the Mexican Army. He and his troops were executed several days later at nearby Presidio La Bahia.\nFannin Battleground State Historic Site is located east of Goliad in Goliad County, Texas. The citizens of Goliad County donated the 14-acre battleground to the State of Texas around 1913. The state originally named it Fannin State Park. The site is currently operated by the Texas Historical Commission and features a stone obelisk, interpretive exhibit, group pavilion, and picnic area.\nSee also\n*List of Texas state historic sites\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Goliad County, Texas\n*Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks in Goliad County\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.visitfanninbattleground.com Fannin Battleground State Historic Site website]"
