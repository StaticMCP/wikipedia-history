The campaign aimed to secure the northern frontiers.\nQarachil is also referred to as Kumaon\nBackground\nSultan Muhammad bin Tughluq launched the Qarachil Expedition to stabilize the northern borders of the Delhi Sultanate and suppress rebellions in the region>. The area, identified with parts of modern-day Kumaon  and Garhwal in Uttarakhand, was strategically significant due to its rugged terrain and its position as a frontier zone.\nThe campaign\nThe expedition, led by Khusrau Malik, was one of the largest undertaken by the Delhi Sultanate, with an estimated strength of 80,000 to 100,000 troops. Initially, the army advanced successfully through Sambhal and captured key territories, including Jidya. However, the campaign soon turned disastrous:\n* Fierce resistance by Kumaoni forces: The local rulers and their troops employed guerrilla tactics, ambushing the sultanate's forces in the dense forests and rugged mountains. The Himalayan warriors, well-acquainted with the terrain, inflicted heavy casualties on the invaders.\n* Strategic disruption: Kumaoni forces targeted supply lines and logistical routes, starving the sultanate’s army of essential resources.\n* Adverse weather and plague: Heavy rains and freezing conditions in the mountains compounded the difficulties. The harsh climate caused widespread illness, including an outbreak of plague that devastated the sultanate’s troops.\n* Logistical failures: The sultanate forces were unprepared for the extended campaign in such remote terrain. Their reliance on traditional supply lines proved to be a significant vulnerability.\nAftermath\nThe failure of the Qarachil Expedition had far-reaching consequences:\n* Military losses: A significant portion of the sultanate’s forces were lost, weakening its military.\n* Economic strain: The expedition’s cost exacerbated financial pressures on the empire.\n* Forced currency: After expedition Tuglaq launched brass and copper currency\n* Political repercussions: Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq’s credibility was damaged, and dissent grew within his administration.\nReferences\nNotes"
