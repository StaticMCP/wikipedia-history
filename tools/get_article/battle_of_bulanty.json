In the battle, the Kazakhs inflicted a heavy defeat on the Dzungar Khanate's army.\nThe works of outstanding Kazakh zhyrau, such as Umbetey, Aktamberdy, Tattikar, Kozha-Bergen, Bukhara, Kotesh-Akyn, etc., tell about the heroism of the batyrs in battles. They not only witnessed, but also actively participated in heroic battles, passing on their exploits to descendants.\nBackground\nIn 1723, the Dzungars invaded the Middle and Senior Juz, thus starting a new war. During the invasion, the Dzungars captured Turkestan, Tashkent, and Khujand. Destroying peaceful population on their way, these events became known as «». By 1726, the Khans of all three juzes united and organized an All-Kazakh . Ablukhair, Abilmambet, Sameke, Zholbars, Barak and Kazakh batyrs joined forces against Dzungar aggression.\nBattle\nIn 1728, in the foothills of Ulytau, in the Kara-siyr area near the Bulanta river, the Kazakh militia won the first major victory in the long struggle against the Dzungarian Khanate. Detachments of Kyrgyz and Karakalpaks took the side of the militia. The total number of the combined forces was about 60 thousand people. The place of the battle has been preserved forever in the national memory and received the historical name \"Kalmak kyrylgan\" (the place of death of the Kalmyks). According to approximate data, up to 10 thousand Dzungarian warriors were destroyed. The invaluable significance of the victory on the Bulanta River was that the morale of the people was noticeably strengthened. The myth of the invincibility of the Dzungarian hordes was dispelled. The Kazakh militia cheered up. The victory over the enemy caused an explosion of general jubilation and enthusiasm. She strengthened the desire to further unite the people in the face of a formidable danger. The victory of the people's militia at Bulanta was of far-reaching strategic importance. This major victory was the key to success in the upcoming Anyrakay battle.\nIt is noteworthy that the batyrs fought and defended the entire territory of Kazakhstan. During the years of confrontation with the invaders, the people did not divide into zhuzes, tribes and .\nRamifications\nSuch a great victory did not end the Kazakh-Dzungar war of 1723—1730, the next major battle was the Battle of Añyraqai, in which the Kazakh Polochens again inflicted a crushing defeat on the Dzungars. As a result of the war, the Kazakhs won in 1730.\nMeaning\nThe liberation war has become international. Together with the Kazakhs, the Karakalpaks and Kyrgyz fought shoulder to shoulder.\nEven the brutal defeats failed to break the will and spirit of the people. The great heroism, dedication and willingness to sacrifice of the people helped not only to withstand, but also to make a decisive contribution to the victory over foreign invaders.\nAn important role in the organization of armed resistance was played by warriors from various Kazakh clans, tribes and zhuzes: Kabanbai, Bogenbay, Nauryzbay, Raiymbek, Zhasy-bay, Eset, Malaysary, Bayan, Olzhabay, Kozha-beregen, Bolek, Sanyryk, Tailak, Zhabay, Berdykozha, and many others. They were at the head of independent Kazakh detachments and boldly led the militias into battle.\nWomen took an active part in the battles with the Dzungars. Among the participants of the war were Aitolkyn, the daughter of Sultan Abylai, Yesenbike, the daughter of Karasai batyr, Aibike, the daughter of Bulanbai batyr and others. For example, Gaukhar batyr, the wife of Karakerei Kabanbai batyr, commanded a reconnaissance detachment and took part in all important battles. Later, as a mother, she sent her eldest daughter Nazim to the war.\nAs a result of the unification of all three Kazakh zhuzes, the Kazakhs defeated the Dzungars in 1728 and 1730, thereby defending their independence. But the threat of new invasions by the Dzungarian Khanate was not eliminated.\nReferences"
