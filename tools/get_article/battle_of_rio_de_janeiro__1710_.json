The raid was a complete failure; its commander, Jean-François Duclerc, and more than 600 men were captured.  French anger over the Portuguese failure to properly hold, release, or exchange the prisoners contributed to a second, successful raid, the following year.\nDuclerc was killed while in Portuguese captivity on 18 March 1711; his killers (and their reason for killing him) are unknown.\nReferences\n*Boxer, Charles Ralph.
