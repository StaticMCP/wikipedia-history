Also known as Bacon Switch, the site was once a thriving railroad switch point in the late 19th century. The site between Delmar and Laurel, Delaware had a number of small stores. It was named after the Bacon family, who started a farm there, before expanding into the sawmill and basket making business.  Parents Thomas and Amelia Bacon, had five sons: Frank, Albert, Thomas, William and Harry. The son Thomas designed a collapsible egg carrier in 1884 that was granted a US Patent, number 299715 [https://patents.google.com/patent/US299715].  The egg carrier was used to ship eggs to Philadelphia, where it would be collapsed and returned to the farmer.  Thomas Bacon Jr. died in 1939.\nReferences"
