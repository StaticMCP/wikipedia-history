It was released in 1998 and introduced a more polished output that focuses on keyboard-driven symphonic black metal. The EP would often be compared to many similar symphonic black metal groups at the time, especially Dimmu Borgir.\nTrack listing\n#\"Intro-Preludium\" - 02:01\n#\"Where Darkness Cannot Reach\" - 03:30\n#\"Symphony of Moonlight\" - 02:19\n#\"Eternal Emperor\" - 04:31\n#\"The Final Battle\" - 05:40\nReferences"
