His running mate is former governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin. Lula was elected in 2002 for the first term and re-elected in 2006 for the second term and is a candidate for tri-election for the third term, after his successors, former president Dilma Rousseff, having been elected in 2010 for the first term and re-elected in 2014 for the second term and former mayor of São Paulo, Fernando Haddad, having been defeated in 2018.\nPre-candidacy\nOn 20 May 2021, in an interview to French magazine Paris Match, Lula confirmed that he was pre-candidate for the next year elections.\nThe Workers' Party national committee, on 13 April 2022, approved the nomination of former governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin (PSB) for Vice President. The ticket was officialized on 7 May, in a coalition formed by the Brazil of Hope Federation (formed by Workers' Party, Communist Party of Brazil and Green Party), Brazilian Socialist Party, Solidarity and PSOL REDE Federation. With the withdrawal of André Janones on 4 August, the ticket received official support of Avante and Agir.\nCandidacy for President\nThe Workers' Party approved on 21 July 2022 the candidacy of former President Lula in the party's national convention. Lula ran for President for the sixth time, his third term and the first candidate for President as member of a partisan federation. This modality of alliance was created in 2021.\nPolitical positions\nAbortion\nOn 4 April 2022, having said \"madam can get an abortion in Paris, go to Berlin, look for a good clinic\", and openly defended that \"'it should be made a public health issue and everyone has the right\". In a letter to Brazilian evangelicals, Lula stated that he is \"personally against abortion,\" but that abortion policy \"is not an issue to be decided by the President of the Republic, but by Congress\".\nEducation\nOn 21 October 2022, Lula promised the return of the government funding for private university students.\nEnvironment\nIn his first days of government, Lula will seek to convene an international climate conference in Brazil with other global leaders, to regain trust in the face of global public and political opinion, and to present his new plans for the protection of the Amazon rainforest, as the return of the Amazon Fund, of approximately $3&nbsp;billion reais together with Germany and Norway.\nForeign policy\nOn 29 October 2022, in an article written for the French newspaper Le Monde, Lula said that Brazil will return to its leading role in the international stage, especially in the fields of the environment and renewable energies, Lula will also continue to claim a permanent seat for Brazil in the UN Security Council. In his government program, Lula reinforced the return of cooperation with the nations of Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa, in addition to strengthening the relationship with Mercosur, Unasur, Celac and the BRICS.\nHe will also seek to formalize a Brazil-European Union strategic partnership, to serve as a counterweight to a \"possible new cold war\" between the United States and China.\nHealth\nOn 17 October 2022, Lula promised to reinforce the budget of the Ministry of Health and the Brazilian Unified Health System, known as SUS, in addition to reduce to zero the queues for consultations and exams, affected by the pressure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.\nInfrastructure\nOn 10 September 2022, Lula promised the return of the Growth Acceleration Program, better
