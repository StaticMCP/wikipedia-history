It was sponsored by the long-running (since 1971) Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society (KaCSFFS, pronounced kax-fuss). ConQuesT was the oldest such fan convention of its type in Missouri and in the U. S. central states region. It was first established using the name Mid-America Con in June 1972. After that, the next nine KaCSFFS-sponsored conventions were named BYOB-Cons (the final \"B\" in the name having additional and alternate science fictional meanings beyond the traditional meanings.) In 1980 KaCSFFS adopted the permanent name ConQuesT (sometimes abbreviated CQT) for the convention.\nThe convention's purpose was to celebrate science fiction, fantasy, and horror \"in all its various forms\", but with a nod toward the literary side of these closely related genres. For some years its programming had been built around a different yearly theme.\nConventions\n1970s\n*Mid-America Con – Held June, 16-18, 1972 at the downtown Hotel Continental, and featured author guests of honor Philip José Farmer and James E.
