The award also extends to private citizens who have been killed or seriously injured while aiding a Texas peace officer, firefighter, or emergency medical first responder in the line of duty. The award is typically handed out by the Governor of Texas in Austin, Texas on September 11 each year.\nThe Star of Texas Awards were established in 2003, and have been presented to more than 712 killed or injured Texas First Responders.\nQualifications\nAccording to the State of Texas, eligibility for consideration for the Star of Texas Awards is contingent upon the critical incident occurring between September 1, 2003, and June 13 of the same year the awards ceremony takes place. An individual is eligible to receive multiple Star of Texas Awards, provided that each award is in recognition of a different incident.\nEvery year, the Governor appoints an advisory committee for each of the three first responder categories: Law Enforcement, Firefighter, and Emergency Medical. These committees are responsible for evaluating award nominations to ensure they adhere to the statutory criteria established for the awards. The careful scrutiny by these committees guarantees that only those who meet the high standards of the award are considered for recognition.\nLicense Plate\nAwardee's are also granted the option of purchasing a Star of Texas Award Specialty License Plate. The license plate reads \"STAR OF TEXAS\" on the center bottom of the plate and has the Star of Texas Award on the left side of the License Plate.\nNotable Honorees\n*2023: Sr. Cpl.
