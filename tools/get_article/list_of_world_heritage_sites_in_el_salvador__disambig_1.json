Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. El Salvador accepted the convention on October 8, 1991, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2024, El Salvador has  only one World Heritage Site, Joya de Cerén, which was inscribed in 1993.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (department)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Joya de Cerén Archaeological Site\n|\n|La Libertad Department\n|iii, iv (cultural)\n|1993\n|Joya de Cerén was a pre-Hispanic farming community that, like Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy, was buried under an eruption of the Laguna Caldera volcano c. AD 600. Because of the exceptional condition of the remains, they provide an insight into the daily lives of the Central American populations who worked the land at that time.\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , El Salvador has listed six properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (department)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Gulf of Fonseca\n|\n|La Unión Department\n| align=\"center\" |1992\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Cara Sucia / El Imposible\n|\n|Ahuachapán Department\n| align=\"center\" |1992\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Chalchuapa\n|\n|Santa Ana Department\n| align=\"center\" |1992\n|ii, iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Ciudad Vieja / La Bermuda\n|\n|Cuscatlán Department\n| align=\"center\" |1992\n|(cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Lake Güija\n|\n|Santa Ana Department\n| align=\"center\" |1992\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Cacaopera\n|\n|Morazán Department\n| align=\"center\" |1992\n|iii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
