This prompted British Colonel John Maitland  to send a force to recapture the island and secure it from further attack. Maitland sent Major George Browne with 126 men, comprising two companies of the British 32nd Regiment, a detachment of the Canadian St. Thomas Volunteer Cavalry, and a small band of First Nations warriors to cut off the invaders.\nBattle\nOn March 3, 1838, Browne's force intercepted the Hunter Patriots on the ice off the south western shore of the island and defeated them in a sharp fight. The British and Canadian casualties were 5 killed (4 from the 32nd Regiment and 1 Canadian cavalryman) and 25 wounded. On the Patriot side, Hoadley, his second-in-command, Captain Van Rensselaer, and 11 rank and file were killed by enemy fire; in addition to 1 man who drowned when he fell through the ice. 18 Patriots were wounded and a further 11 were captured, some of whom were also badly wounded.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184501/http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques_DEF/Plaque_Essex34.html \"The Battle of Pelee Island 1838]\n* : A veteran of the battle"
