It is endemic to Palau. The natural habitat of this species is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.  It was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the Micronesian kingfisher.\nThis is a brilliantly colored, medium-sized kingfisher. Adults are characterized by white underparts with long black eyestripes, while juveniles are cinnamon below. They have large laterally-flattened bills and dark legs. Kingfishers defend permanent territories as breeding pairs and family groups. Both sexes care for young, and some offspring remain with parents for extended periods.\nLittle has been published about the status of rusty-capped kingfisher populations, although the US Fish and Wildlife Service has bird survey data for the region.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Fry, C.H., K.
