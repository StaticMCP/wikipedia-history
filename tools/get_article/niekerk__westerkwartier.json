It had a population of around 1,365 in 2021.\nHistory\nThe village was first mentioned in 1392 as to der Nyerkerke, and means \"new church\". Nie- (\"new\") has been added to distinguish between Oldekerk. Niekerk is a road village which developed on a sandy ridge in a raised bog. During the Late Middle Ages, it started to overshadow neighbouring Oldekerk.\nThe Reformed church dates from around 1200. The tower was added in the 13th century. Between 1964 and 1967, it was restored, the plaster was removed and nave was returned to its original shape.\nNiekerk was home to 440 people in 1840. It used to be part of the municipality of Oldekerk. In 1990, it became part of Grootegast and was merged into Westerkwartier in 2019.\nGallery\nFile:Niekerk - gemeentehuis Oldekerk.jpg|Former town hall\nFile:Niekerk - verenigingsgebouw.jpg|House in Niekerk\nFile:Niekerk- haventje met voormalig gemaal.jpg|Harbour with former pumping station\nFile:Niekerk - hoofdmeesterswoning Welgelegen.jpg|School master's house\nReferences\nExternal links"
