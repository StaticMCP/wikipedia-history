There is also a Consulate-General in San Francisco. The focus of the consulate is on British investment in the area (the UK is the largest foreign investor in California), as well as assisting British expatriates and tourists in the area.\nList of consuls-general of the United Kingdom to Los Angeles\n* 1943–1945: Eric Arthur Cleugh\n* 1945: Henry Livingston\n* 1945–1947: John Carvell\n* 1948–1954: Sir Robert Hadow\n* 1954–1957: Sir Michael Gillett\n* 1957–1959: Riversdale Stone\n* 1959–1964: Sir Herbert Gamble\n* 1964–1965: Peter Dalton\n* 1966–1974: Albert Franklin\n* 1974–1981: Thomas Aston\n* 1981–1984: George Finlayson\n* 1985–1989: Donald Ballentyne\n* 1989–1992: Reginald Holloway\n* 1992–1997: Merrick Baker-Bates\n* 1997–2001: Paul Dimond\n* 2001–2005: Peter Hunt\n* 2005–2009: Robert Peirce\n* 2009–2013: Dame Barbara Hay\n* 2013–: Chris O'Connor\n* 2017–2020: Michael Howells\n* 2020–2024: Emily Cloke\n* 2024–present: Paul J. G. Rennie\nHistory\nDuring the nineteenth century, the British Consulate established deep and extensive ties along the West Coast. Much of the history of Los Angeles is a history of British innovators, from Charlie Chaplin to Raymond Chandler to the architect John Parkinson. Hawaii's first European visitor was Captain James Cook, who died on the Big Island: the Union Jack is part of its state flag, testifying to old British connections there. The post was upgraded from a Consulate to a Consulate-General in 1943.\nResidence\nSet in Hancock Park at 450 South June Street, the residence was designed by Los Angeles architect Wallace Neff, and completed in 1928. It has been the home of successive British consuls-general since the British Government purchased it in 1957. The residence is used for many events, all for the purpose of enriching and developing the multifarious connections between Britain and Los Angeles in business, politics, education, culture, science and many other fields of endeavour. The consul general welcomes several thousand guests to the residence every year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://ukinusa.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/other-locations/la/ British Consulate-General in Los Angeles]"
