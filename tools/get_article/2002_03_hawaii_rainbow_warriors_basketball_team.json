The Rainbow Warriors, led by head coach, Riley Wallace, played their home games at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, as members of the Western Athletic Conference. Hawaii finished in a tie for 6th in the WAC during the regular season and won one game in the WAC tournament before falling in the semifinals to Tulsa.\nHawaii failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament, but was selected to participate in the NIT, earning a postseason bid for a school-record third consecutive season. In the NIT, the Rainbow Warriors won their first game, but were eliminated in the second round of the tournament by , 70–58.\nRoster\n)\n|asst_coach=\n* Bob Nash ()\n* Jackson Wheeler ()\n* Bob Burke
