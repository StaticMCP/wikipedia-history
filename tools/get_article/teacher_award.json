There are numerous countries and organisations that give out awards.\nUnited States\nThe National Teacher of the Year program began in the United States in 1952 as a project by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO).  The winning teacher is chosen by a selection committee from all the state schools around the country.  They are then introduced to the American public in a ceremony, before being given a year away from classroom work in order to travel the country as a spokesperson for the profession.\nThe DisneyHand Teacher Awards are given out annually to a wide range of teachers, who receive US$10,000 and participate in the awards gala.
