Shortly after, they advanced to San Isidro. They faced logistical problems and bad weather, forcing Lawton to stop. On May 11, they continued. His plan was to march to San Isidro, the new capital of the rebellion government, to battle the insurgents by using a local river to flank the troops of General Antonio Luna. To aid the campaign, gunboats were sent to Calumpit up a river.\nMay 16 skirmish\nOrders were issued for the 22nd Infantry Regiment to join the 16th Infantry Regiment to join the presumed movement on May 17. General Lawton left San Miguel, Bulacan on four o'clock for the front. He sent the 3rd Infantry Regiment from San Miguel to make a demonstration against the Biak-na-Bato, but no enemy was discovered there. Communication was established in San Miguel and the skirmish commenced. A large group of troops were organized; the 22nd Regiment were located on the left of the road while the 1st North Dakota regiment, 13th Minnesota Regiment, and the 2nd Oregon Regiment were placed in the right. The command advanced to the town. Within  of the settlement, the regiments opened fire. The 1st North Dakota regiment charged across a burning bridge under heavy fire and caused 600 of the opposition to retreat. One casualty was noted in the United States' side while numerous soldiers were injured. The Filipino revolutionary forces, meanwhile, had a heavier loss of 15 casualties, 20 wounded, and three prisoners. The insurgents fled toward Gapan, located approximately  east of San Isidro. One battalion each from the Oregon and Minnesota regiments were sent to Gapan while another column followed from San Miguel, Bulacan. The troops from San Isidro and the column from San Miguel were sent to their respective locations shortly after. The insurgents fled towards Tarlac, the new revolutionary capital.\nBattle and aftermath\nThe 22nd Infantry and the 1st North Dakota Regiment were brought to the front and deployed. Four guns were brought up to support the movement. After a while, it was found that the only insurgents were found in front of the Oregon and North Dakota regiments, leading to a fight which was maintained for half an hour. Due to this, the enemy retreated and the town of San Isidro, Nueva Ecija was captured by the American forces. Due to this, the town was evacuated, and the 13th Minnesota Regiment eventually went to Baliwag; Lawson continued south to Pampanga. On May 30, Lawton returned to Manila.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*  |via=Calhoun}}"
