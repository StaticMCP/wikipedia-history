Axis and Allies Naval Miniatures gameplay is associated with Axis & Allies Miniatures, a World War 2 land battles game also made by Avalon Hill, but the two games are very different. Players take command of miniatures that are 1/1800 scale and represent fleets of individual warships, submarines, and squadrons of Aircraft.\nReleases\nStarters\n* War at Sea Starter Set: Released on March 16, 2007; It includes 9 randomized units, 2 double-sided battle maps, 6 island cards, and 8 six-sided dice.\n* War at Sea Starter (Revised): Released on March 16, 2010; It includes 8 non-random miniatures, 2 double-sided battle maps, 4 six-sided dice and a new rule book.\nSeries\n* War at Sea: Set of 64 models, released on March 16, 2007. It features ships, submarines and aircraft from the UK, US, France, Australia, Germany, Italy and Japan.\n* Task Force: Set of 60 models, released on July 25, 2008. Added Canadian and Dutch warships.\n* Flank Speed: Set of 40 models, released on September 1, 2009.

Introduces a new Bismarck, LST, , , shore batteries, Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and .\nRules\nWar at Sea uses fairly simple rules. The players can get quickly familiarized with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070217103511/http://www.wizards.com/AvalonHill/rules/AAMWBS_QuickRlbk_EN.zip Quick Start Guide] and then continue with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071023223155/http://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/AAMWBS_Rlbk.zip Advanced Rules].\nThe advanced rules have been periodically updated, beginning in July 2007, with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081207071150/http://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/War_at_Sea_Clarifications.pdf Clarifications Document]. The update introduces new concepts (such as ASW harassment and strafing penalties) not present in the original rules. Since at least one unit of the Task Force expansion set directly refers to these new rules, they are implicitly considered as part of the core ruleset, despite only having been published online to date.\nThere are some companies and blog sites that offer other ideas for Battles, advanced rules and tactics as well.\nErrata\nAn official FAQ for the Task Force set can be found online.[https://web.archive.org/web/20081215130025/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/aam/ah20080724c]. It addresses errata such as misprints and ambiguously worded rules for the Task Force expansion. Further errata are contained in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081207071150/http://www.wizards.com/avalonhill/rules/War_at_Sea_Clarifications.pdf Clarifications Document]. Only additional unacknowledged errata are listed here:\n* The correct name of the Dutch submarine is HNLMS Zwaardvisch, not Zvaardvisch.\n* The Focke-Wulf Fw 200 reconnaissance plane was nicknamed \"Condor\", not \"Kondor\".\n* In the War at Sea base set and the Flank Speed expansion, the colors of the Italian roundel were inverted. The roundel in Task Force was correct. (This error is partially acknowledged in the Clarifications Document.)\n* In the expansion Flank Speed, the set checklist lists  as part of the Soviet forces, but the actual ship included in the set is .  Both are  heavy cruisers of the same series and are considered sister ships.\n* The  miniature is actually the .  Yamashiro should have the third turret pointing towards the stern.  Fusōs third turret points toward the bow.\n* The  miniature is actually that of her modernized sister ship , and not the unmodernized HMS Repulse.\n* Some  miniatures have the island installed backwards.\n* Some  miniatures have no island installed.\nUnits (through Surface Action)\nRAAF 1942-1945  Australia\n**  (Fleet Command;
