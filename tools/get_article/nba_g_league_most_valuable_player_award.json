      "text": "# NBA G League Most Valuable Player Award\n\nThe NBA G League Most Valuable Player (MVP) is an annual NBA G League award given since the league's inaugural season to the best performing player of the regular season. The league's head coaches determine the award by voting and it is usually presented to the honoree during the G-League playoffs.\nNo player has been named the MVP more than once, and only one international player has won the award. Ansu Sesay was the inaugural winner while playing for the Greenville Groove. By position, guards have won the award with 12 winners, followed by forwards with eight. Only one center has won, Courtney Sims in 2008–09.\nWinners\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#CFECEC;\" |\n|Denotes the year co-MVPs were named.\n|}\nwon the league's first award in 2002.]]\nwon the award in 2003 while playing for the Fayetteville Patriots.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
