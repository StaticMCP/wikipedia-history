The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nOther prominent filmmakers submitted include Bo Widerberg and Jan Troell, both who have had three of their films nominated.\nBergman's Scenes from a Marriage was ineligible in 1974 due to previously aired on Swedish television, led to debate about the eligibility by American filmmakers. According to Robert Osborne, the country did not enter in 1975 as a protest. In 1978, however, the country did not submit his film Autumn Sonata and made no entry.\nThe 1988 winner Pelle the Conqueror was a Swedish-Danish co-production, but was submitted by Denmark.\nIn 2002 there was a bit of controversy as Sweden's submission Lilja 4-ever had most of its dialogue in Russian and not Swedish. Eventually it was accepted as eligible, but did not receive a nomination.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Sweden for review by the Academy for the award by year.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
