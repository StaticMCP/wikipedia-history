      "text": "# Empire Wrestling Federation\n\nThe Empire Wrestling Federation (EWF) is an independent wrestling promotion based in Covina, California. It is owned and operated by Jesse Hernandez. The EWF is also tied to Hernandez's wrestling school, The School Of Hard Knocks. The EWF is the longest running promotion in Southern California, running continuously from 1996. The EWF is a former affiliate of the National Wrestling Alliance.\nHistory\nEWF was founded in 1996 by Bill Anderson and Jesse Hernandez.  The promotion's name comes from the Inland Empire, the popular name of the area surrounding San Bernardino.\nIt saw its first show in May 1996 at the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino as Bobby Bradley defeated Tom \"Zuma\" Howard to become the first EWF Heavyweight Champion. In 1999, Bill Anderson left the EWF and formed his own promotion and wrestling school, the International Wrestling Council in Riverside, California. In June 1996, a tribute to Superstar Billy Graham was held.\nSeveral EWF wrestlers from the past have gone on to national fame, including Rico Constantino, Awesome Kong, Louie Spicolli, Frankie Kazarian, Christopher Daniels, Shelly Martinez and Melina Perez. In 1997, Chris Jericho and Lee Marshall of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) mentioned EWF on WCW broadcasts and Marshall attended a show in Hemet, California. Other pro wrestling stars have made appearance at EWF shows including Mando Guerrero, Peter Maivia, Ludvig Borga, The Honky Tonk Man, Tony Atlas and Tom Brandi. Many EWF wrestlers appear as jobbers on World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) broadcasts, and at the 1999 Royal Rumble the orderlies sent to apprehend Kane were performed by the EWF roster, including then owners Bill Anderson and Jesse Hernandez.\nThey held their 20th Anniversary Extravaganza at the EWF Arena in Covina, Ca on May 6, 2016.\nSchool of Hard Knocks\nThe EWF School of Hard Knocks is owned and operated by Jesse Hernandez and is currently located at the American Sports University, 399 North \"D\" Street in San Bernardino, CA. The School of Hard Knocks became the Official Training Facility of the National Wrestling Alliance in 2007 and has trained countless students from such countries as Canada, France, Australia, India, Great Britain, Russia, Mexico and others, in addition to those students who come to the school from all regions of the United States. The EWF's School of Hard Knocks has sent several wrestlers to prominent promotions across the globe including Melina, Rico Constantino, Frankie Kazarian, Awesome Kong, Rocky Romero, Ricky Reyes, Alex Koslov and Shelly Martinez. The School of Hard Knocks also has served as the training area for Chris Jericho, Layla, Eve Torres, Rhaka Khan, Lena Yada and others, who looked to brush up on their in-ring skills. The school and some of its students are set to be promoted in the upcoming reality show, \"Slam School\".\nCurrent champions\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=98% style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Championship:\n!Current champion(s):\n!Won From:\n!Location:\n|-\n|EWF Heavyweight Championship\n|Trailer King\n|Highlander\n|Banning, CA\n|-\n|EWF American Championship\n|\"Mexi Macho #1\" Tio Chulo\n|Big Bull\n|Banning, CA\n|-\n|EWF Tag Team Championship\n|IRod and Erny Valencia\n|Heartless Kings (J2 Mattioli & Jeremiah Fresh)\n|Banning, CA\n|}\nDefunct championships\nThe EWF Cruiserweight Championship was introduced in 2004 and was won by Liger Rivera in a 4-Way match.
