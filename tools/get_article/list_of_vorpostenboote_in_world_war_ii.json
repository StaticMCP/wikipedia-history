Many vorpostenboote also served in other roles, such as sperrbrecher (mine clearance) and weather ships. During World War II, the Vorpostenboote were organized into several surface flotillas which were in turn attached to various German ports. Over 30 Vorpostenflotillas were established to operate off the German, Channel, Baltic and Scandinavian coasts.\n1 Vorpostenflotille\n1 Vorpostenflotille was active in the western Baltic from 1 October 1939 to 1 October 1940, when it was redesignated 3 Sperrbrecherflotille.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Ship\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Armament\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Displacement\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Propulsion\n! colspan=\"3\" |Service\n|-\n!Launched\n!Commissioned\n!Fate\n|-\n|V 101 Schwan\n|\n|, .\n|Compound steam engine, single screw propeller.\n|1938.\n|1 October 1939.\n|Later served as Sperrbrecher 31 and Sperrbrecher 131.
