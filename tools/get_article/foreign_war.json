The war took place in 346 BC.\nKnossos wanted to strengthen their hegemony of Crete, but received opposition from the Lyttians. In response Knossos employed foreign mercenaries under the former Phocian leader Phalaikos. In 346, Knossos declared war against Lyttos.  Phalaikos, who was given command of the forces of Knossos and of the mercenaries, was about to seize Lyttos when the Lyttians asked the Spartans for help.  The Spartans, under King Archidamus, rushed to help the Lyttians. The Spartans came in time to save Lyttos and defeat Phalaikos.  Phalaikos then turned against Kydonia.  This decision proved fatal for Phalaikos who was slain in the siege and his army was destroyed.\nThis war proved to be a turning point in Cretan history since it was the first time foreign forces had come to Crete and interfered in Cretan affairs.\nSources\n* Theocharis Detorakis, (1994).
