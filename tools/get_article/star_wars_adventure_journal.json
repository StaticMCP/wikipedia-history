These books are crammed full of great short stories, Star Wars RPG adventures, great adventure hooks, interesting non-player characters, new ships and equipment, thoughtful source articles, solitaire adventures, interviews, and more.\"\nAndrew Rilstone reviewed The Best of the Star Wars Adventure Journal for Arcane magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. Rilstone comments that \"If you like the writing of Zahn and Tyers, then this book is probably worth having for the fiction; but if it's roleplaying material you are after, there are better things to spend your credits on.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* -(this article is derived from Wookieepedia's)"
