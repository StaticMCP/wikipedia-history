The team currently compete in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league system.\nThe club was founded as Christchurch Rangers in 1882 and took up their current name after merging with St Judes Institute four years later, near the Queen's Park and Kensal areas. Having won the West London League in 1898–99, QPR joined the Southern and Western leagues where they won titles in both. It was during this period that the club reached the final of the FA Charity Shield twice in 1908 and 1912. QPR were elected to the Football League in 1920. The club played in the Third Division South until winning promotion as champions in 1947–48. The club was relegated in 1952, but slowly rebuilt under the stewardship of Alec Stock which culminated in winning the Third Division title and also their only major trophy to date, the League Cup in the 1966–67 season. Promoted from the Second Division in 1967–68, they were relegated after one season in the First Division. QPR won promotion again in 1972–73 and then narrowly missed out winning the English league title in 1975–76, finishing only one point behind champions Liverpool. Relegated in 1979, they reached the FA Cup final as a second-tier club in 1982, losing to Tottenham Hotspur after a replay.\nQPR won another Second Division title in 1982–83 and were beaten finalists in the 1986 League Cup final. They remained in the top-flight for thirteen years, becoming founder members of the Premier League in 1992, before being relegated in 1996. Relegated again in 2001, they secured promotion from the third tier at the end of the 2003–04 campaign. QPR won promotion as winners of the Championship in 2010–11, although they were relegated from the Premier League after two seasons. They won an immediate promotion via the play-offs in 2014 but were relegated again the following season and have remained in the Championship since that time.\nAfter a nomadic early existence, QPR have played home matches at Loftus Road since 1917, apart from two brief spells at the White City Stadium. They share rivalries with various other clubs; most notably they contest the West London derby against Chelsea.\nHistory\nEarly history (1882 - 1920s)\nThe club was formed in 1886, when a team known as St Jude's (formed in 1884) merged with Christchurch Rangers (formed in 1882). The resulting team were called Queen's Park Rangers and their official formation date is considered to be 1882, which is the original founding date of Christchurch Rangers. The club's name came from the fact that most of the players came from the Queen's Park area of West London. St Jude's Institute on Ilbert Street W10 is still in use as a community hall and in July 2011 club icon Stan Bowles unveiled a plaque celebrating its place in QPR history.\n1882: QPR was founded as Queens Park Rangers by a group of schoolboys from the area of Queen's Park in North-West London. The club initially played in local leagues and was part of the amateur football movement.\nQPR became a professional team in 1889. The club was elected into the Southern Football League in 1899. In 1899–1900 they put themselves on the map after qualifying for the first round proper of the FA Cup by beating Wolverhampton Wanderers on their own ground 1–0. The Guardian said \"the hitherto unknown Queens Park Rangers, a team hailing from the north-west suburbs of London...upset all calculations.\"\nAt this time the club's core support, as indicated by its marketing area, was an area of West London, to the west of the A5 Road (Roman Watling Street), in and around the former Boroughs of Paddington and Willesden. As London extended further west, the club's following grew along with it.\nThey first won the Southern Football League in 1907–08. As Southern League champions that year, they played in the first ever Charity Shield match, against the Football League champions Manchester United. The club lost 4–0 in a replay after the first game had finished 1–1. Both games were played at Stamford Bridge. QPR were Southern League champions for a second time in 1911-12.\nRise to Prominence (1920s - 1960s)\nThe club joined the Football League in 1920, when the Third Division was formed, mainly with Southern League clubs. When the Third Division was split into North and South the following season, QPR, like most of the former Southern League clubs that had joined the Football League to form the Third Division, were in the Third Division (South).\nQPR played their home games in nearly 20 different stadia - a league record - before permanently settling at Loftus Road in 1917; although the team would briefly attempt to attract larger crowds by playing at the White City Stadium for two short spells: 1931 to 1933, and the 1962–63 season.\nThe club were promoted as champions of Division 3 South in the 1947–48 season. Dave Mangnall was the manager as the club participated in four seasons of the Second Division, being relegated in 1951–52. Tony Ingham was signed from Leeds United and went on to make the most-ever league appearances for QPR (519). Arguably the club's greatest ever manager, Alec Stock, arrived prior to the start of the 1959–60 season. The 1960–61 season saw QPR achieve their biggest win to date: 9–2 vs Tranmere Rovers in a Division 3 match. In time, Stock, together with Jim Gregory who arrived as chairman in the mid-1960s, helped to achieve a total transformation of the club and its surroundings.\nIn 1966–67, QPR won the Division Three championship and became the first Third Division club to win the League Cup, on Saturday, 4 March 1967, beating West Bromwich Albion 3–2, after coming back from a two-goal deficit, securing the clubs first and only major trophy. It was also the first League Cup final to be held at Wembley Stadium. After winning promotion in 1968 to the top flight for the first time in their history, Rangers were relegated after just one season and spent the next four years in Division Two.\nThe Golden Era (1970s)\nTerry Venables joined from Spurs at the beginning of the 1969–70 season and Rodney Marsh was sold to Manchester City. During this time, new QPR heroes emerged including Phil Parkes, Don Givens, Dave Thomas and Stan Bowles. These new signings were in addition to home-grown talent such as Dave Clement, Ian Gillard, Mick Leach and Gerry Francis.\nIn 1972 QPR were promoted to Division One (the top tier of English football), under manager Jim Gregory.\nIn 1974, Dave Sexton joined as manager and in 1975–76 led QPR to the runners-up spot in the First Division, missing out on the championship by only one point, with a squad containing seven England internationals and internationals from the home nations. After completing their 42-game season, QPR sat at the top of the league, one point ahead of Liverpool who went on to defeat Wolverhampton Wanderers to clinch the title. Wolves were relegated to the Second Division that same season. The late 1970s also saw some cup success with Rangers reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup and in their first entry into European football reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup losing to AEK Athens on penalties. Following Sexton's departure in 1977 the club eventually slipped into the Second Division in 1979.\nPromotions, Relegations and two cup finals (1980s)\nIn 1980 Terry Venables took over as manager and in 1981 the club installed an artificial turf pitch. In 1982 QPR, still playing in the Second Division, reached the FA Cup final for the only time in the club's history, facing holders Tottenham Hotspur. Tottenham won 1–0 in a replay. The following season QPR went on to win the Second Division championship and returned to English football's top division. After a respectable fifth-place finish, and UEFA Cup qualification, the following year, Venables departed to become manager of Barcelona. In 1988 the club had a new chairman, 24-year-old Richard Thompson. Over the next seven years, various managers came and went at Loftus Road and the club spent many seasons finishing mid-table and avoiding relegation. The most successful season during this period was the 1987–88 season in which QPR finished fifth, although missing out on a UEFA Cup campaign due to the ban on English clubs in European competition as a result of the Heysel Stadium disaster. They were also runners-up in the 1986 League Cup, losing to Oxford United.\nThe Premier League Years and Relegation (1990s)\nGerry Francis, a key player in the 1970s QPR side who had proved himself as a successful manager with Bristol Rovers, was appointed manager in the summer of 1991. In his first season in charge they finished mid-table in the league and in the 1992–93 season were founder members of the inaugural Premier League, finishing fifth, as top London club. Francis oversaw one of QPR's most famous victories, the 4–1 win at Old Trafford in front of live TV on New Year's Day 1992. Midway through the 1994–95 season Francis resigned and very quickly became manager of Tottenham Hotspur and Ray Wilkins was installed as player-manager. Wilkins led QPR to an eighth-place finish in the Premiership. In July 1995 the club's top goalscorer, Les Ferdinand, was sold for a club record fee of £6&nbsp;million to Newcastle United.\nQPR struggled throughout the following season and were relegated at the end of the 1995–96 season. QPR then competed in Division 1 until 2001 under a succession of managers including club legend Gerry Francis who was reappointed for a second spell finishing mainly mid-table and towards the bottom half of the division.\nRelegation, promotion, financial struggles and the arrival of Bernie & Flavio (2000s)\nAfter several years of struggle in the second tier, QPR became embroiled in financial and boardroom controversy. Although the club had floated on the Alternative Investment Market in 1991, in 2001 it entered administration (receivership). A period of financial hardship followed and the club left administration after receiving a £10m high-interest emergency loan which continued to burden the club. The 00–01 season proved to be a disaster and Francis resigned in early 2001. Former Rangers midfielder Ian Holloway was appointed manager but failed to prevent the club from being relegated to the third division at the end of the season, the first time since the 1960s.\nAfter relegation Holloway assembled a team featuring several QPR fans in the squad including Kevin Gallen, Marc Bircham and Richard Langley alongside other key players such as Danny Shittu, Gareth Ainsworth and Clarke Carlisle. In their second season in the third tier, the club reached the play-off final in Cardiff, losing 0–1 to Cardiff City in extra time. The following season QPR put their playoff heartache behind them and returned to Division 1 after as runners-up, with a famous 3–1 win away at Hillsborough in front of 7000 travelling Rangers fans.\nRangers struggled for consistent form over the next two campaigns before Holloway was suspended amidst rumours of his impending departure for Leicester City. A poor series of results and lack of progress at the club saw Holloway's successors Gary Waddock and later John Gregory – both former players – fail to hold on to the manager job.\nScandals involving the directors, shareholders and others emerged in 2005–06 season and included allegations of blackmail and threats of violence against the club's chairman Gianni Paladini. In an unrelated incident, QPR were further rocked by the murder of youth team player Kiyan Prince on 18 May 2006 and, in August 2007, the death of teenager and promising first-team player Ray Jones in a car crash.\nRangers continued to face mounting financial pressure, in the September 2007 it was announced that the club had been bought by wealthy Formula One businessmen Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone (see Ownership and finances below). John Gregory's reign as manager came to an end in October 2007 after a string of poor results left QPR at the bottom of the Championship and he was replaced by Luigi De Canio until the end of the 2007–08 season. Further investment followed in early 2008 as the club looked to push for promotion to the Premier League within four years, on the back of greater financial stability. On 14 May 2008, Iain Dowie was announced as the manager to begin the campaign to return Rangers to the top flight. However, on 24 October 2008, Dowie was sacked after just 15 games in charge of the club.\nOn 19 November 2008, QPR named former Portugal midfielder Paulo Sousa as their new first team coach. However, on 9 April 2009, his contract was terminated after he allegedly divulged confidential information without authority. On the same day as Sousa's sacking, player/coach Gareth Ainsworth was appointed as player/caretaker manager for a second time. In June 2009 Jim Magilton was named as new manager of QPR. Despite leading QPR to a good start to the 2009–10 season, a loss of form combined with an alleged head-butting incident with Hungarian midfielder Ákos Buzsáky saw the club further embroiled in controversy. Magilton left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009, along with his assistant John Gorman. They were replaced by Paul Hart and Mick Harford on the next day.\nPromotions to the Premier League and Relegations from it (2010s)\nLess than a month and only five games after becoming manager at QPR, Paul Hart parted with the club on 14 January 2010; the reasons for his leaving the club were unstated.\nOn 1 March 2010, experienced Championship manager Neil Warnock joined Queens Park Rangers as manager on a three-and-a-half-year deal after agreeing compensation with Crystal Palace. After comfortably helping the club avoid relegation in the 10–11 season, Warnock assembled a squad consisting mainly of Championship veterans such as Shaun Derry, Clint Hill, Paddy Kenny with previous on loan playmaker Adel Taarabt being given a central role in the team and given the captains armband.\nOn 30 April 2011, QPR secured promotion to the Premier League by winning the Championship with a 2–0 win over Watford. A subsequent FA investigation involving QPR's acquisition of Alejandro Faurlín threatened to deduct points from the side and put their promotion into jeopardy. The investigation concluded on 7 May 2011, with QPR found to be at fault in two of the seven charges, and received an £875,000 fine. However, there were no points deducted by the FA, and QPR's promotion to the Premier League was secured.\nAfter the club was promoted Eccleston and Briatore sold their shared to Malaysian billionaire and Air Asia owner Tony Fernandes whose arrival sparked a deadline day spending spree to strengthen the QPR squad.\nIn January 2012, Fernandes sacked Warnock and appointed Mark Hughes as team manager. Following a tough start to his Loftus Road career and after a run of five straight home wins, Hughes and QPR escaped relegation despite a dramatic 3–2 defeat at Manchester City on the last day of the season.\nOn 23 November 2012, Mark Hughes was sacked after a poor start to the 2012–13 season, having amassed only four points in 12 games and with the club languishing at the bottom of the Premier League despite significant financial investment in new players in the 11 months of Hughes' tenure. A day later, Harry Redknapp was confirmed as the new manager. On 28 April 2013, in a 0–0 draw against fellow relegation rivals Reading, and with three games of the season to play, QPR were relegated from the Premier League down to the Championship after two seasons in the top flight.\nDuring the 13–14 season, QPR finished fourth in the Championship, and qualified for the play-offs where they defeated Wigan Athletic in the semi-finals. In the final against favourites Derby County on 24 May 2014, QPR won 1–0 with a goal scored by Bobby Zamora in the 90th minute to return to the Premier League at the first time of asking.\nFollowing promotion back to the Premier League, QPR endured a difficult 14-15 season. Harry Redknapp resigned in February after poor results and mutual frustration with the board. He was replaced by Chris Ramsey. The club finished the season in last place, amassing only 30 points, and were relegated back to the Championship after only one season. After a poor start to the following season, Ramsey was sacked in November 2015 and former manager Neil Warnock returned in interim charge. On 4 December 2015, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was appointed the club's new manager on a rolling contract. Hasselbaink was sacked on 5 November 2016, just 11 months after being in charge. Then six days later QPR reappointed Ian Holloway who was in charge ten years previously. Holloway's second spell saw him focus on bringing through young players to replace some of the aging players in the squad on big wages. Holloway gave debuts to youth team players Eberechi Eze and Ilias Chair and made other youngers like Darnell Furlong, Ryan Manning and Bright Osayi-Samuel key members of the team. Results on the pitch were inconsistent under Holloway and the club finished lower midtable in both seasons of his second spell. Holloway left the club at the end of the 2017–18 season.\nOn 17 May 2018, QPR appointed former England manager Steve McClaren as manager. Despite a promising first half of the season in which the team sat as high as eighth by Christmas, results quickly tailed off following the turn of the year and McClaren was sacked in April 2019 after a 2–1 loss to Bolton.\nOn 8 May 2019, former Rangers & Brentford manager Mark Warburton was appointed as McClaren's successor on a two-year deal.\nRebuilding Phase (2020s)\nThe club continued to build on its development of young talent, with a focus on producing more homegrown players and challenged for promotion in each of Warburton's three seasons in charge however failed to make the play-offs in any of these seasons. Warburton's contract was not renewed after the 2021–22 season in which a disappointing end to the season saw Rangers drop out of the play-offs where they had spent the majority of the season and finishing 11th..\nAhead of the 2022–23 season, former Aston Villa assistant manager and Rangers first-team coach Michael Beale was appointed as manager on a three-year deal on 1 June 2022. A fortnight after pledging his loyalty to the club Beale was approached by Scottish club Rangers who appointed him manager in November 2022. On 11 December 2022, former Blackpool manager and Aston Villa assistant Neil Critchley was named QPR manager after signing a -year deal. However, after a dismal run of form and dropping to 20th in the EFL Championship, Neil Critchley was sacked after just 46 days in charge, leaving with the lowest win percentage of any manager in their history, winning one match from twelve. He was replaced by former player Gareth Ainsworth, signing from Wycombe Wanderers.\nAfter a poor start to the 2023–24 season, Gareth Ainsworth was sacked with the club in 23rd  place in the Championship, before being replaced by Martí Cifuentes. Despite spending much of the season in the relegation zone Cifuentes turned the teams fortunes around guiding them to Championship survival with a 4–0 home win over promotion contenders Leeds United. In April 2025, Cifuentes was placed on Gardening Leave and Kevin Betsy and Xavi Calm took charge of the final game of the season. Cifuentes parted way with the club in June 2025 and was replaced by Julien Stéphan.\nKits\n]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! style=\"color:#fff;background:#0055a5\" |Period\n! style=\"color:#fff;background:#0055a5\" |Kit manufacturer\n! style=\"color:#fff;background:#0055a5\" |Shirt sponsor\n|-\n|1974–1975\n|Admiral\n| rowspan=\"3\" |None\n|-\n|1975–1976\n|Umbro\n|-\n|1976–1983\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Adidas\n|-\n|1983–1986\n|Guinness\n|-\n|1986–1987\n|Blue*Star\n|-\n|1987–1989\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Holland and Fly KLM\n|-\n|1989–1990\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Influence\n|-\n|1990 Aug&nbsp;– 1990 Dec\n|Influence Leisure\n|-\n|1990 Dec&nbsp;– 1991\n|Holland and Fly KLM\n|-\n|1991–1992\n|Brooks\n|Brooks\n|-\n|1992–1993\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Clubhouse\n|Classic FM\n|-\n|1993–1994\n|CSF\n|-\n|1994–1995\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Compaq\n|-\n|1995–1996\n| rowspan=\"2\" |View From\n|-\n|1996–1997\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ericsson\n|-\n|1997–2001\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Le Coq Sportif\n|-\n|2001–2003\n|JD Sports\n|-\n|2003–2006\n|Binatone\n|-\n|2006–2008\n|Cargiant.co.uk\n|-\n|2008–2011\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Lotto\n|GulfAir.com\n|-\n|2011–2012\n|Malaysia Airlines (home) and AirAsia (away and third)\n|-\n|2012–2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" |AirAsia\n|-\n|2014–2016\n|Nike\n|-\n|2016–2017\n|Dryworld\n|Smarkets\n|-\n|2017–2020\n| rowspan=\"7\" |Erreà\n|Royal Panda\n|-\n|2020\n|BetUK.com\n|-\n|2020–2021\n|Football Index\n|-\n|2021\n|Senate Bespoke\n|-\n|2021\n||Ashville Holdings\n|-\n|2022–2024\n||Convivia\n|-\n|2024–\n||CopyBet\n|-\n|}\nGrounds\nQueens Park Rangers have led a somewhat nomadic existence in their history. The several grounds used prior to 1886 are unknown but were probably in the Queen's Park area of London (the first being ''The Queen's Park'' itself). Thereafter, the club played at 15 different locations in west London and north-west London, but since joining the Football League in 1920, they have only played at two grounds: Loftus Road (briefly known as Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium between 2019 and 2022) and White City Stadium.\nhas been QPR's stadium for the majority of their history]]\n}}\n*Welford Fields (1886–1888)\n*London Scottish Ground (1888–1889)\n*Home Farm (1888–1889)\n*Kensal Green (1888–1889)\n*Gun Club (1888–1889)\n*Wormwood Scrubs (1888–1889)\n*Kilburn Cricket Ground (1888–1889)\n*Barn Elms (1891)\n*Kensal Rise Athletic Ground (1899–1901)\n*Latimer Road (1901–1902)\n*Kensal Rise Athletic Ground (1902–1904)\n*Royal Agricultural Society showgrounds (1904–1907)\n*Park Royal Ground (1907–1917)\n*Loftus Road (1917–1931)\n*White City Stadium (1931–1933)\n*Loftus Road (1933–1962)\n*White City Stadium (1962–1963)\n*Loftus Road (1963&nbsp;–present)\nThere were plans to build a new 40,000-seater stadium called New Queens Park; however, plans have been shelved with the club looking to build a stadium on the site of the Linford Christie Stadium with 30,000 seats. The club have argued this would bring a huge financial boost to the local area, but their plans were met with some initial scepticism by Hammersmith & Fulham Council.\nQPR have also been involved in a long-running legal battle to build a training ground at Warren Farm in Southall. In November 2018, Supreme Court judges rejected the final appeal from local objectors against the proposals, paving the way for the redevelopment of the site to begin. However the club formally abandoned plans for a training ground at Warren Farm on 6 May 2020 replacing it with a plan to develop the site into a community sports centre as the club signed a non-disclosure agreement with an unknown party regarding the freehold of another site. It was announced on 6 July that the club formally secured the freehold of the Heston Sports Ground from Imperial College, with the intention of developing the site into a training ground for the club, with discussions ongoing between the club and Hounslow Council.\nOn 31 March 2021, the club obtained planning permission for the redevelopment of Heston Sports Ground into a state of the art training ground, subject to a referral to the Secretary of State. The club received formal support from the Secretary of State on 27 September 2021 along with final planning permission from Hounslow Council being granted, with formal construction beginning on 1 October 2021. The Club aims to move into the £20m facility, (with £6.75m being raised through a bond scheme), by the start of the 2022–23 season, with the final competition date being the 2023–24 season.\nIn June 2019, the club gifted the stadium naming rights to The Kiyan Prince Foundation, a local charity set up by the father of Kiyan Prince. Prince was a former QPR youth player who was fatally stabbed in 2006. On 25 May 2022, the club announced that the stadium name would revert to Loftus Road ahead of the 2022–23 season.\nSupporters and rivalries\nQPR have a modest but loyal fanbase who come from across west London and the home counties. The club have supporters clubs across the world, including the Republic of Ireland, the US, Australia, Norway, and Sierra Leone. The club's longest running fanzine is ''A Kick Up The R's'', which has been published every month since August 1987 and is sold at both home and away matches.\nQPR have long-standing rivalries with several other clubs due to the club's location in West London.

Following lengthy negotiations in December 2004, Wright agreed to sell his remaining 15% stake; 50% of the money paid to him was given back to QPR, which was significant amount of cash to the club.\nAfter a number of years of financial difficulties which included a period in financial administration, QPR was bought by Formula One tycoons and multi-millionaires Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore in a £14&nbsp;million takeover in August 2007. In spending £690,000 to acquire a 69% majority stake in the club from a Monaco-based consortium led by Italian football agent, Antonio Caliendo, Ecclestone spent £150,000 on his 15%, while Briatore bought 54% for £540,000 through a British Virgin Islands registered company, Sarita Capital. In addition, Briatore and Ecclestone were believed to have promised £5&nbsp;million in convertible loan facilities to help buy players and have covered £13&nbsp;million of debt, in a total commitment to the club of around £20&nbsp;million. At the time of purchase, the remaining 31% of shareholders turned down the offer of 1p a share.\nOn 20 December 2007, it was announced that the family of billionaire Lakshmi Mittal had purchased a 20% shareholding in the club from Flavio Briatore. The purchase price of the 20% stake was just £200,000. As part of the investment Lakshmi Mittal's son-in-law Amit Bhatia took a place on the board of directors. While Gianni Paladini remained chairman of the football club, Alejandro Agag, as chairman of QPR Holdings (the parent company) was the de facto chairman, until he was replaced by Flavio Briatore in early February 2008. Agag moved into the role of managing director, supported by a deputy managing director, Ali Russell, who moved from Hearts in the Scottish Premier League.\nDespite QPR's perilous financial condition in 2007–08, the combined personal wealth of the club's new owners – which included the then world's eighth richest man, Lakshmi Mittal – sparked speculation that QPR would receive significant further investment from their new benefactors, drawing parallels with their wealthy West London neighbours Chelsea and Fulham. However, no significant further funds were made available to the club other than those injected as part of the purchase of its share capital, and much of the subsequent player transfer activity involved loan acquisitions or free transfers. Indeed, it was reported in January 2008 that the investors had not discharged the £10&nbsp;million loan from ABC Corporation – secured on the club's stadium – together with its £1&nbsp;million annual interest burden—despite the club's prospective annual turnover of between £10&nbsp;million and £15&nbsp;million. Furthermore, around £2&nbsp;million was still owed to former director and major shareholder, Antonio Caliendo, who waived £4.5&nbsp;million of loans when Briatore and Ecclestone bought the club. It was expected that the ABC loan would be discharged in June 2008 on its maturity and that the debt owed to Caliendo would be paid off \"in early 2008\" in line with a funding strategy which Ecclestone publicly stated would not result in the wealthy owners simply bankrolling the club. In fact, the ABC loan was discharged on or around 31 July 2008.\nMittal's investment is thought to be primarily motivated by his son-in-law's interests and it was assumed that Mittal himself would remain a silent investor while Briatore, Ecclestone and Bhatia worked together to implement the strategy of slowly building the club up ahead of a push for promotion to the Premier League in 2009. The new owners also pledged to refurbish Loftus Road and use their experience in Formula One to increase sponsorship revenues. On 25 March 2008, QPR confirmed that, from the 2008–09 season and for five seasons, their kits would be supplied by Lotto Sport Italia as part of a number of new partnerships formed by Flavio Briatore. The investment potential of the club's new backers resulted in a number of wildly speculative storylines in the football press throughout the 2007–08 season, including rumoured signings of former World Player of the Year winners Luís Figo and Zinedine Zidane, the latter as a possible manager.\nIn May 2008, billionaire Vijay Mallya was linked with buying into the club, as part of the Ecclestone, Briatore and Mittal consortium. Following the termination of the club's sponsorship deals with Car Giant, Le Coq Sportif and Sellotape at the end of the 2007–08 season, in early July 2008 it was expected to be announced that Gulf Air would be the new shirt sponsors for three years. Further sponsorship packages were also announced, including Abbey Financial Services and Lotto Sport Italia. On 12 September 2011, Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia announced sponsorship of QPR's shirts for the two seasons, with the sponsorship costing some £6.2 million.\nwas the chairman of Queens Park Rangers]]\nFlavio Briatore's future as QPR chairman came into question in September 2009 after he left the Renault F1 team in the midst of race fixing allegations. The Football League board discussed the matter on 8 October 2009 and declared that they would be awaiting a response from Briatore to various questions before commenting further. Meanwhile, the club continued to make losses (£18.8m in 2008–09 and £13.7m 2009–10). Briatore sold his 62% share to Ecclestone in December 2010, with the Italian possibly retaining a right of first refusal should Ecclestone sell, and initially stepped back from the day-to-day running of the business in favour of Amit Bhatia and Ishan Saksena, the company chairman and managing director respectively. However, his involvement gradually returned, and conflicts between Briatore on the one hand and Bhatia and Saksena on the other resulted in both Bhatia and Saksena leaving QPR in May 2011.\nOn 18 August 2011, Malaysian businessman Tony Fernandes was unveiled as the majority shareholder after having bought out Ecclestone's 66 per cent stake in the club for a rumoured fee of around £35&nbsp;million, while the Mittal Family retained their 33% stake. Amit Bhatia was restored to his position as vice-chairman. Phillip Beard was announced as the new chief executive of the club and Gianni Paladini removed as club chairman. Briatore and Ecclestone were no longer involved with the club, with no board representation or other financial ties. Bhatia also explained in the takeover announcement that the loan, representing the refinanced ABC Corporation debt secured using the stadium as collateral, had now been \"bought off\" by the new regime – that is, refinanced by new debt. It is thought that the current debt is represented by a shareholder loan to the club and is non-interest-bearing. Despite the club's fortunes in attracting investors, it continues to be mired in controversy from previous ownership regimes and has been subject to proceedings from former investors Dunga and Antonio Caliendo.\nOn 15 August 2018, Bhatia took over as chairman of the club. On 10 July 2023, Fernandes announced that he is disposing all of his shares in the club to focus on rebuilding his airline business.\nHonours\nNote: the leagues and divisions of English football have changed somewhat over time, so here they are grouped into their relative levels on the English football league system at the time they were won to allow easy comparison of the achievement\nSource:\nLeague\n*First Division (level 1)\n**Runners-up: 1975–76\n*Second Division / Championship (level 2)\n**Champions: 1982–83, 2010–11\n**2nd place promotion: 1967–68, 1972–73\n**Play-off winners: 2014\n*Third Division South / Third Division / Second Division (level 3)\n**Champions: 1947–48, 1966–67\n**2nd place promotion: 2003–04\n*Southern League\n**Champions: 1907–08, 1911–12\n*Western League\n**Champions: 1905–06\nCup\n*FA Cup\n**Runners-up: 1981–82\n*League Cup\n**Winners: 1966–67\n**Runners-up: 1985–86\n*FA Charity Shield\n**Runners-up: 1908, 1912\nMinor\n* Division Three South (North Region): 1945–46\n* Wartime League South B: 1939–40\n* West London Challenge Cup runners-up: 1890–91\n* West London Observer Cup: 1891–92, 1892–93\n* London Cup: 1895\n*London Challenge Cup\n**Winners: 1932–33, 1938–39, 1955–56, 1965–66\n* Southern Charity Cup: 1913\n* Copa De Ibiza: 2005\n* Trofeo Bortolotti: 2011\n* Dryworld Cup: 2016\nSee also\n* Football in London\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
