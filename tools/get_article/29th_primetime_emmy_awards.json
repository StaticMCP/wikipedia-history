It was hosted by Angie Dickinson and Robert Blake.\nThe top shows of the night were Mary Tyler Moore, which, in its final season, won its third consecutive Outstanding Comedy Series Award, it also became the first comedy series to gain eleven major nominations (since broken). Upstairs, Downstairs, also in its final season, won its third Outstanding Drama Series Award in four years (it competed as a miniseries in 1976, and won that category too). But the overwhelming champion of the ceremony was the miniseries Roots.\nRoots set several milestones and broke multiple records during the night. It became the first show to receive at least twenty major nominations (21). Adding its nominations in Creative Arts categories, its total expands to 37. Both records still stand for all shows. It was the first show to gain every nomination in an acting category. Its thirteen acting nominations tied the record set the previous year by Rich Man, Poor Man. Roots became the first miniseries, and second show overall, along with All in the Family in 1972, to win six of seven major categories. All but one of Roots eight episodes were nominated for major awards (Part VII).\nOther distinctions included Mary Kay Place winning a Major Acting award for a TV show (Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) that had no major network, only broadcast in Syndication - the first time this rare feat has occurred. Also, with actress Rita Moreno's win for her guest appearance on The Muppet Show, she became the third person after Richard Rodgers and Helen Hayes to achieve all four major entertainment awards (EGOT).\nWith this ceremony, the Primetime Emmys began a long residency at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium that would continue until 1997.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'The Mary Tyler Moore Show (CBS)'\n** All in the Family (CBS)\n** Barney Miller (ABC)\n** The Bob Newhart Show (CBS)\n** M*A*S*H (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Upstairs, Downstairs (PBS)'\n** Baretta (ABC)\n** Columbo (NBC)\n** Family (ABC)\n** Police Story (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Van Dyke and Company (NBC)'\n** The Carol Burnett Show (CBS)\n** Evening at Pops (PBS)\n** The Muppet Show (Syndicated)\n** Saturday Night (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'The Barry Manilow Special (ABC)'\n** Neil Diamond: Love at the Greek (NBC)\n** The Shirley MacLaine Special: Where Do We Go from Here?
