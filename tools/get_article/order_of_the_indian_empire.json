The Order includes members of three classes:\n#Knight Grand Commander (GCIE)\n#Knight Commander (KCIE)\n#Companion (CIE)\nAppointments terminated after 1947, the year that British India became the independent Union of India and Dominion of Pakistan. With the death of the last surviving knight, the Maharaja Meghrajji III of Dhrangadhra, the order became dormant in 2010.\nThe motto of the Order is Imperatricis auspiciis, (Latin for \"Under the auspices of the Empress\"), a reference to Queen Victoria, the first Empress of India. The Order is the junior British order of chivalry associated with the British Indian Empire; the senior one is The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India.\nHistory\nThe British founded the Order in 1878 to reward British and native officials who served in British India. The Order originally had only one class (Companion), but expanded to comprise two classes in 1887. The British authorities intended the Order of the Indian Empire as a less exclusive version of the Order of the Star of India (founded in 1861); consequently, many more appointments were made to the former than to the latter.\nOn 15 February 1887, the Order of the Indian Empire formally became \"The Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire\" and was divided into two classes: knights commander and companions, with the following as knights commander, listed up to 1906\n*Maharaja Harendra Kishore Singh Bahadur (1884)\n*Dietrich Brandis (1887)\n*Alexander Meadows Rendel\n*Donald Campbell Macnabb\n*George Birdwood\n*Surgeon-General Benjamin Simpson\n*Albert James Leppoc Cappel\n*Donald Mackenzie Wallace\n*Alfred Woodley Croft\n*Bradford Leslie\n*Jaswantsinghji Fatehsinghji, Thakur Sahib of Limri\n*William Gerald Seymour Vesey-Fitzgerald\n*Charles Arthur Turner (1888)\n*Edwin Arnold\n*Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock\n*Raymond West\n*Guilford Lindsey Molesworth\n*Frederick Russell Hogg\n*Sirdar Nauroz Khan, of Kharan\n*Rajagopala Krishna Yachendra of Venkatagiri\n*Henry Mortimer Durand (1889)\n*Arthur George Macpherson\n*William Markby\n*H.

Seven knights grand commander were created, namely:\n*The Prince of Wales\n*The Duke of Edinburgh\n*The Duke of Connaught and Strathearn\n*The Duke of Cambridge\n*Lord Reay, Governor of Bombay\n*Lord Connemara, Governor of Madras\n*General Sir Frederick Sleigh Roberts (promoted from a Knight Commander)\nAlso from 1897, 3 honorary knights commander were made.\nIncluding Léon Émile Clément-Thomas (1897), Col. Sir Eduardo Augusto Rodriques Galhardo (Jan 1901) and Sir Hussien Kuli Khan, Mokhber-ed-Dowlet (June 1902).\nEmperor Gojong of Korea was made an honorary Knight Grand Commander on 17 December 1900.\nCeasement\nAppointments to both the Order of the Star of India and the Order of the Indian Empire ceased after 14 August 1947. As the last Grand Master of the orders, the Earl Mountbatten of Burma was also the last known individual to have publicly worn the stars of a Knight Grand Commander of both orders, during the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations in 1977. There are no living members of the order.\n* The last Grand Master of the Order was Rear Admiral The 1st Viscount Mountbatten of Burma (later promoted and created Admiral of the Fleet The 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma; 1900–1979), the last Viceroy of India. Lord Mountbatten was killed in an IRA bombing in County Sligo on 27 August 1979.\n*The last surviving GCIE, Maharaja Sri Sir Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma (1912–1991), the Maharaja of Travancore, died on 19 July 1991 in Trivandrum.\n*The last surviving KCIE, Maharaja Sri Sir Mayurdwajsinhji Meghrajsinhji III Maharaja of Dhrangadhra (1923–2010), the Maharaja of Dhrangadhra-Halvad, died at Dhrangadhra on 1 August 2010.\n*The last surviving CIE, Sir Ian Dixon Scott (1909–2002), died on 3 March 2002.\nThe fictional characters Purun Dass, invented by Rudyard Kipling, and Harry Paget Flashman, invented by George MacDonald Fraser, were KCIEs; Kipling's engineer Findlayson in ''The Day's Work (1908) aspires to the CIE.\nComposition\nThe British sovereign serves as Sovereign of the Order. The grand master held the next-most senior rank; the position was held, ex officio'', by the viceroy of India. Members of the first class were titled \"Knight Grand Commander\" rather than \"Knight Grand Cross\" so as not to offend the non-Christian Indians appointed to the order.\nAt the time of foundation in 1878 the order had only one class, that of Companion, with no quota imposed. In 1886, the Order was divided into the two classes of knights commander (50 at any given time) and companions (no quota). The following year the class of Knight Grand Commander (25 at any given time) was added; the composition of the other two classes remained the same. The statute also provided that it was \"competent for Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors, at Her or their pleasure, to appoint any Princes of the Blood Royal, being descendants of His late Majesty King George the First, as Extra Knights Grand Commander\".\nBy Letters Patent of 2 Aug 1886, the number of knights commander was increased to 82, while commanders were limited to 20 nominations per year (40 for 1903 only). Membership was expanded by letters patent of 10 June 1897, which permitted up to 32 knights grand commander. A special statute of 21 October 1902 permitted up to 92 knights commander, but continued to limit the number of nominations of commanders to 20 in any successive year. On 21 December 1911, in connection with the Delhi Durbar, the limits were increased to 40 knights grand commander, 120 knights commander, and 40 nominations of companions in any successive year.\nBritish officials and soldiers were eligible for appointment, as were rulers of Indian Princely States. Generally, the rulers of the more important states were appointed knights grand commander of the Order of the Star of India, rather than of the Order of the Indian Empire. Women, save the princely rulers, were ineligible for appointment to the order. Female princely rulers were admitted as \"knights\" rather than as \"dames\" or \"ladies\". Other Asian and Middle Eastern rulers were also appointed as well.\nVestments and accoutrements\n's badge]]\nMembers of the order wore elaborate costumes on important ceremonial occasions:\n* The mantle, worn only by knights grand commander, comprised dark blue satin lined with white silk. On the left side was a representation of the star (see photo at right).\n* The collar, also worn only by knights grand commander, was made of gold. It was composed of alternating golden elephants, Indian roses and peacocks.\nAt less important occasions, simpler insignia were used:\n*The star, worn only by knights grand commander and knights commander, had ten points, including rays of gold and silver for knights grand commander, and of plain silver for knights commander. In the centre was an image of Victoria surrounded by a dark blue ring with the motto and surmounted by a crown.\n*The badge was worn by knights grand commander on a dark blue riband, or sash, passing from the right shoulder to the left hip, and by knights commander and companions from a dark blue ribbon around the neck. It included a five-petalled crown-surmounted red flower, with the image of Victoria surrounded by a dark blue ring with the motto at the centre.\nThe insignia of most other British chivalric orders incorporate a cross; the Order of the Indian Empire does not, in deference to India's non-Christian tradition.\nPrecedence and privileges\nMembers of all classes of the order were assigned positions in the order of precedence. Wives of members of all classes also featured on the order of precedence, as did sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of knights grand commander and knights commander. (See order of precedence in England and Wales for the exact positions.)\nKnights grand commander used the post-nominal \"GCIE\", knights commander \"KCIE\", and companions \"CIE.\" Knights grand commander and knights commander were entitled to the prefix \"Sir\". Wives of knights grand commander and knights commander could prefix \"Lady\" to their surnames. Such forms were not used by peers and Indian princes, except when the names of the former were written out in their fullest forms.\nKnights grand commander were also entitled to receive heraldic supporters, and could encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a circle bearing the motto) and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. Knights commander and companions were permitted to display the circlet, but not the collar, surrounding their arms. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar or circlet.\nNotable appointees\nof Gondal GCSI, GCIE, in a 1911 photograph, during his visit to London for the coronation of King George V.
