The clash occurred during Abu-l-Khair's hunt in the vicinity of Afrasiab.\n| date        = 1509 – 1510\n| result      = Kazakh victory\n| territory   =\n| combatant1  =  Kazakh Khanate\n| combatant2  =  Khanate of Bukhara\n| commander1  =  Abu-l-khayr Khan\n| commander2  =  Sheibani Khan\n| strength1   = 80,000\n| strength2   = 60,000\n| casualties1 = Unknown\n| casualties2 = 48,000\n}}\nBackground\nDuring a period of political instability in Central Asia, the struggle for power between nomadic and sedentary states intensified. One of the key rivalries was between the Kazakh Khan Abu-l-Khair and the Uzbek ruler Muhammad Shaybani Khan.\nAt the time of the events, Muhammad Shaybani Khan sought to strengthen his position in the region by controlling the strategically important cities of Samarkand and Bukhara. Learning that Abu-l-Khair Khan and his 80,000-strong army were hunting in the vicinity of Afrasiyab, Shaybani Khan decided to seize the opportunity and launch a surprise attack.\nGathering a force of 60,000 warriors, he marched from Samarkand toward the hunting grounds. His goal was to catch the enemy off guard and deliver a decisive blow. However, the Kazakh warriors, alerted by the sound of karnays (war horns), quickly organized their defenses. In the ensuing battle, the steppe army inflicted heavy losses on the Uzbek forces, forcing Shaybani Khan to retreat.\nBelieving that the Kazakh forces would advance on Samarkand and Bukhara, Shaybani Khan preemptively plundered Samarkand and withdrew to Bukhara. However, news of Abu-l-Khair Khan's injury altered the course of events—Shaybani Khan returned to Samarkand and retained control of the city.\nThese events became part of the ongoing conflict between the Uzbeks and Kazakhs, shaping the future of the region.\nCourse of the war\nMuhammad Shaibani Khan, having learned of the enemy’s location, gathered a 60,000-strong army and launched a surprise attack. His army approached the hunting grounds stealthily, hoping to take the Kazakhs by surprise. However, the approach of the army was noticed, and Abu-l-Khair-khan promptly gave the order to fight.\n80 thousand Kazakh warriors, despite the surprise factor, immediately organized a defense. At the signal of the khan, they released a hail of arrows at the advancing enemy. Massive bow fire inflicted heavy losses on the Uzbek army - 40 thousand people were killed. Realizing the failure, Shaibani Khan was forced to retreat.\nDuring the pursuit, the Kazakhs finished off another 8 thousand Uzbek warriors, finally dispersing their forces.\nAftermath\nThe battle ended in a Kazakh victory, inflicting heavy losses on the Uzbek forces. However, due to Abu-l-Khair Khan’s injury, the Kazakhs could not advance further. This allowed Muhammad Shaybani Khan to retain control over Samarkand and regroup. The battle highlighted the strength of the Kazakh army but did not lead to a decisive shift in regional power.\nReferences\n* E-HISTORY (04.08.2013) https://e-history.kz/ru/projects/show/23177 (In Russian)\n* Isin A.I.
