His right to the title was contested by his cousin Mary, Lady Fane, who claimed to be heir general of her father, the 6th Baron. The dispute continued many years.\nHe married Katherine Brome, with whom he had the following children:\n*Edward Nevill, 8th Baron Bergavenny ( – 1622)\n*Francis Nevill\n*George Nevill\n*Henry Nevill\n*Margaret Nevill\n*Grisel Nevill, married Sir Henry Poole\n*Mary Nevill\nHe later married Grisold Hughes.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.thepeerage.com/p1424.htm#i14237 thepeerage.com page (number and title differ)]"
