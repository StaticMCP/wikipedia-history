In 1953 she was expecting her first child, a daughter. Her first daughter arrived earlier than she expected as she was waiting for a Western doctor and her mother to travel to Thimphu to help with the delivery. The previous Queen, Ashi Phuntsho Choden, her maid, and the Bhutanese doctor Phenchun helped to deliver her daughter.\nHer children with the Third Druk Gyalpo were:\n* Princess (Druk Gyalsem) Sonam Choden Wangchuck (born 1953)\n* Princess (Druk Gyalsem) Dechen Wangmo Wangchuck (born 1954)\n* King (Druk Gyalpo) Jigme Singye Wangchuck (born 1955)\n* Princess (Druk Gyalsem) Pema Lhaden Wangchuck (born 1959)\n* Princess (Druk Gyalsem) Kesang Wangmo Wangchuck (born 1961)\nRoyal duties\nOn 22 April 1972, she was appointed regent when her husband was ill. She has also been a patron of annual prayers conducted for the well-being and security of the King, country, and the people. She provides subsistence allowance to about 500 monks and tshampas (lay monks) in various monasteries in Bumthang, Dokar Phurdrub Gompa and Euto Gompa in Paro, Nyala Gompa in Trongsa and Jangsa Gompa in Kalimpong, India. She also has a keen interest in preserving the unique art, architecture and cultural heritage of Bhutan and in promoting research and scholarship on the kingdom. She often visits religious places in Bhutan and India.\nIn commemoration of the Royal Grandmother's 87th birth anniversary, a book titled \"The Heart of a Sacred Kingdom, Her Majesty the Royal Grandmother Ashi Kesang Choden Wangchuck: A Lifetime of Service to the People and Kingdom of Bhutan\" was published on Sunday 21 May 2017.\nAncestry\nReferences\nNotes"
