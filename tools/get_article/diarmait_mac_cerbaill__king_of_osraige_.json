He appears to have been militarily active after the death of his father.  In 891, he won a victory over the Eóganachta of Munster with the men of Leinster.  Diarmait succeeded his uncle Riagan mac Dúnlainge to the throne of Osraige.  He was deposed in 905 and his brother Cellach was put in his stead.  After Cellach's death in 908, he returned to the kingship by his cousin Flann Sinna the high king, and ruled for another twenty years, reposing in 928.\nHe is remembered in the Banshenchas thus: \"The mother of Diarmait son of Cerball, hero of the brilliant Ossorians, and of Tadg son of perfect Concobar (noble, wealthy, destructive and impetuous) was the daughter in of brown poetical Mael Sechlaind of the main-line of famous Mael Ruanaid.\"\nSee also\n*Diarmait mac Cerbaill\n*Kingdom of Ossory\n*Kings of Osraige\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.fitzpatricksociety.com Fitzpatrick - Mac Giolla Phádraig Clan Society]"
