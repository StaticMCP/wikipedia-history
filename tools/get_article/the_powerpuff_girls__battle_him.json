It was released on February 23, 2001.\nGameplay\nIn The Powerpuff Girls: Battle Him, players take control of Bubbles, the sweet and gentle member of the Powerpuff Girls, as she embarks on a solo mission to rescue the citizens of Townsville from the clutches of the villainous HIM. The game unfolds across multiple side-scrolling platform shooter stages, where Bubbles must fly, punch, kick, and shoot her way through various enemies. To aid her quest, Bubbles can collect power-ups that enhance her flying abilities and unlock special attacks.

She can also summon her fellow Powerpuff Girls using color-coded hotlines found throughout the levels. Players can gather a variety of collectibles, including: Sugars and spices for extra continues; Keys to unlock doors; Candy hearts to boost health; Trading cards (12 unique ones per game) that can be saved, viewed, and exchanged via the Game Link accessory.
