She served as British Ambassador to Denmark from 1976 to 1983 and British Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva from 1983 to 1985. Having retired from her diplomatic career, she was President of Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge from 1985 to 1994.\nCareer\nAnne Marion Warburton was educated at Barnard College, Columbia University, and Somerville College, Oxford. She worked at the London office of the Economic Cooperation Administration (1949–1952), at the NATO Secretariat, then located in Paris (1952–1954) and for Lazard Brothers in London (1955–1957). In 1958, she entered the Diplomatic Service in Branch A (the senior branch) and, after two years at the Foreign Office, was posted to the UK Mission to the United Nations at New York City (1959–1962) during which she was promoted to First Secretary. She served at the British embassy at Bonn (1962–1965) and then in the newly created Diplomatic Service Administration Office in London (1965–1967). She then moved back to the Foreign Office, which became the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 1968, until 1970 when she was posted as Counsellor to the UK's Geneva Mission to the United Nations. After a further period at the FCO as head of the Guidance and Information Policy Department (1975–1976), she was appointed British Ambassador to Denmark in April 1976 and remained there until 1983.\nWarburton was the first female British ambassador. Although Barbara Salt had been appointed ambassador-designate to Israel in 1962, she was unable to proceed to Tel Aviv because of a serious illness and so did not take up the post. Eleanor Emery was British High Commissioner to Botswana from 1973 to 1977, corresponding to an ambassador but within the Commonwealth.\nAfter leaving Denmark, Warburton was ambassador and UK permanent representative to the United Nations and other international organisations in Geneva (1983–1985). She was deputy leader of the UK delegation to the third UN World Conference on Women at Nairobi in July 1985, which closed the United Nations Decade for Women. She retired from the Diplomatic Service and was president of Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge (1985–1994). Concurrently, she was a member of the Equal Opportunities Commission (1986–1988), of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (1994–1997), and of the Council of the University of East Anglia.\nWarburton led a European Community investigative mission into the treatment of Muslim women in the former Yugoslavia, which reported in January 1993.\nShe died on 4 June 2015 at her home near Eye, Suffolk, and is buried in the nearby churchyard of St Mary's in Thornham Parva.\nPublications\n* Paying for NATO : how common finance can help the defence of the West (with John B.
