The Club's services include operating the national travel call center, dispatching roadside motorist assistance, and facilitating vehicular travel for tourists in Iran and Iranians going abroad, including issuing International Driving Permits (IDPs).\nHistory\nTACI was established in 1935 following the approval of the National Assembly of Iran on December 24, 1934. TACI continued its establishment bypassing the official and registration stages in 1938. Iran's membership in the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) was registered in the name of the Tourism and Automobile Club in 1952.\nAfter the Islamic Revolution, with the approval of the bill in the Supreme Council of the Revolution on November 24, 1979, the Imperial Touring Club and Automobile Club was renamed to the Touring and Automobile Club of the Islamic Republic of Iran. During the years 1983 to 1993, TACI became a subset of the Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization, becoming separated from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. In 2019, the Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts, and Tourism Organization was converted into the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts.\nTACI was appointed as the exclusive organization responsible for issuing International Driving Permits (IDPs), issuing and guaranteeing Carnets de Passages in Douane (CPDs), and issuing Registration Certificates and Registration Number Plates for Iranians who travel abroad with their own vehicles.\nTACI’s Roadside Assistance Services were established in 1968 with the aim of providing relief services for Iranian and foreign tourists. Over time, TACI developed its activities by providing relief services through its provincial representatives. TACI’s roadside assistance rescuers were deployed in the cities and roads throughout the county.\nCEOs\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |CEO\n| colspan=\"2\" |Management Period\n|-\n|From\n|To\n|-\n|Mohammad Hossein Soufi\n|October, 2021\n|Present\n|-\n|Hossein Arbabi\n|November, 2019\n|October, 2021\n|-\n|Ramin Afshari\n|October, 2017\n|November, 2019\n|-\n|Morteza Haji\n|January, 2017\n|October, 2017\n|-\n|Ebrahim Rezaei Babadi\n|December, 2015\n|January, 2017\n|-\n|Abolghasem Iraji\n|December, 2013\n|December, 2015\n|-\n|Hamidreza Safi Khani\n|April, 2013\n|December, 2013\n|-\n|Majid Abolfathi\n|August, 2012\n|April, 2013\n|-\n|Hossein Jafari Daranjani\n|January, 2012\n|August, 2012\n|-\n|Hamed Dehghanan\n|June, 2011\n|January, 2012\n|-\n|Fariborz Ensafi\n|June, 2010\n|June, 2011\n|-\n|Ali Asghar Parhizkar\n|June, 2009\n|June, 2010\n|-\n|Seyed Mohammadreza Taghizadeh\n|September, 2007\n|June, 2009\n|-\n|Hossein Moein Zad\n|May, 2007\n|September, 2007\n|-\n|Hojjat Asadi\n|October, 2006\n|May, 2007\n|-\n|Hamid Mohammadi\n|December, 2002\n|October, 2006\n|-\n|Saeed Owhadi\n|October, 1996\n|December, 2002\n|-\n|Mohammad Sadegh Farhadian\n|October, 1995\n|October, 1996\n|-\n|Mohammad Ashghari\n|May, 1995\n|October, 1995\n|-\n|Mohammad Ali Yavari\n|January, 1983\n|May, 1995\n|-\n|Ghias-odin Alaie\n|February, 1982\n|January, 1983\n|-\n|Mir Abdolhamid Adabi\n|January 1980\n|February, 1982\n|-\n|Ahmad Matin-Daftari\n| rowspan=\"3\" |December, 1969\n| rowspan=\"3\" |January, 1980\n|-\n|Mohammad Ali Bouzari\n|-\n|Abbas Masoudi\n|-\n|Mahmoud Djam\n|January, 1936\n|December, 1969\n|}\nSubsidiaries\n* Iranian Educational Institute\n* Aras Travel Agency\n* Zagros Investment and Tourism Institute\n* Zagros International Hotel\nReferences"
