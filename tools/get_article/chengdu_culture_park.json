It covers 71,326 m2 with greenery, a lake, large stones, statues, a teahouse, and towers.\nIn the early 1950s, the city government created an avenue on paddy fields near Qingyang Temple to exhibit and trade flowers. Following the eighth flower exhibition, the avenue was converted into the Qingyang Temple Garden, with surrounding walls. In 1966, the park was renamed by the city government as the Chengdu Culture Park.\nFeatures at the park include the Relief Art Wall, the Shi’er Qiao Martyrs’ Tombs, and the Zhiji Rock and Octagonal Pavilion.\nSee also\n* Tianfu Art Park, Chengdu\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n!-- in particular -->"
