The party's leaders are all traditional chiefs.\nAt its launch, the party promised to reduce unemployment by 70%, double pensions and provide free tertiary education.\nControversy\nParty leader Bryce Mthimkhulu, who describes himself as King Mthimkhulu III and king of the amaHlubi nation in KwaZulu-Natal, was warned by then president Jacob Zuma in 2016 to stop using the term, and was taken to court by the government (which lost the case).\nElection results\nThe party contested the 2019 general election at the national level, and provincial level in the Free State, Kwazulu-Natal and Limpopo, failing to win any seats.\nNational elections\n|-\n!
