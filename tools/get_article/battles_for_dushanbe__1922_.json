In November 1921, he was sent to Central Asia to help suppress the Basmachi Revolt, but after his arrival, he defected to the Basmachi side.\nHis aim was to unite the various Basmachi groups and create a great Pan-Turkic Empire at the expense of the Bolsheviks. After a number of successful military operations he managed to establish himself as the rebels' supreme commander, and turned their disorganized forces into a small but well-drilled army.\nOne of his first and biggest actions was besieging Dushanbe. After 3 months, it resulted in a Basmachi victory despite heavy casualties on both sides.\nRecapture by Bolshevik troops\nBasmachi Movement\n| combatant2        =  Soviet Bukhara RSFSR\n}}\nThe Soviets were shocked by the capture of Dushanbe. Due to this, the Bolshevik leadership decided to allocate over 1.5 million rubles for the transportation of thousands of Soviet soldiers to Bukhara. The resistance movement was already widespread in Turkestan, posing a real threat to Soviet power, which had initially been maintained through severe repressive measures. This was when the Soviets ended the repression of Islam.\nGeneral Nikolai Kakurin was appointed as commander to recapture Dushanbe. Enver's militia was outnumbered and faced a well-equipped army. His attempts to centralize the guerillas to a functioning army angred some other functions, particularly Ibrahim Bek, who was an unreliable ally and did not want to obey him which soon would cause a split between Basmachi Movement.\nLokai valley battle\nAfter the first defeats, a significant part of the Basmachi broke away from Enver Pasha. To make things worst, Ibrahim Bek attacked Enver Pasha's troops from two sides in the Lokai Valley, in June 1922, inflicting significant damage on them. Seeing his defeat, Enver Pasha tried to flee to Afghanistan.\nChagan battle\nOn 4 August 1922, the remnants of Enver Pasha's forces were discovered near the village of Chagan, 25 km from the city of Baljuvon. The 8th Cavalry Brigade of the Red Army under the command of Yakov Melkumov immediately moved there. In the ensuing battle, the Basmachi detachment was completely destroyed, and Enver Pasha himself was killed when he tried a last ditch effort of cavalry charge against enemy lines. After this, the uprising was quickly suppressed, although other Basmachi units remained active in Tajikistan until 1931.\nReferences"
