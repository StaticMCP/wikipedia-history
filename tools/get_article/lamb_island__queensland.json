In the , the locality of Lamb Island had a population of 504 people.\nGeography\nThe island is in the southern part of Moreton Bay between the Queensland mainland and North Stradbroke Island. It is within the Moreton Bay Marine Park. The elevation ranges from  above sea level. The land use on the island is predominantly residential.\nOffshore from the south-east side of Lamb Island is a Protection and Conservation park zone which is home to protected species of marine life including dugong, dolphins and leatherback turtles.\nHistory\nLamb Island has a rich history of food production dating back to the early 1900s. The island consisted of numerous small farms which supplied produce to the mainland Brisbane market. Due to the unique micro climate created by the islands geographic location, its extremely fertile volcanic soil and the pure sand aquifers that run beneath it, the farmers were able to supply superior produce to the mainland market earlier than their mainland competitors. There were several boats (including the well known historic vessels \"Roo\" and \"Amazon\") which travelled from the upper reaches of the Brisbane river out to the island to transport the produce. The Roo would also transport supplies from Brisbane for the island's residents and weekend trippers who would visit the island. One of the well known attractions was Peggy Saunders' garden parties. Peggy Saunders was the wife of one of the original farmers and was well known for her beautiful garden which was located on the Western waterfront of the island.\nIn the late 1970s, Lamb Island, like much of South East Queensland, was developed into small residential allotments. The majority of the original farm land was subdivided with only a handful of small farming lots remaining. The island has remained largely undeveloped with the majority of the small residential lots being left as vacant land. Residential development has been limited largely due to transport costs of materials for building.  The small lot sub division is, to some degree, being undone, as a result of the Redland City Council's 2020 initiative to promote land buy buy back by residents who own neighboring lots to those held by the Council.  Additionally, due to the low price of land preceding 2020, it was not uncommon for resident land owners to buy multiple adjoining lots to increase lot sizes.\nIn recent years, with the popularity and resurgence of organic food, the island is gaining a reputation for its unique micro climate and organically grown produce. In addition to commercial organic growing ventures on the island, there are a number of small community garden groups engaged in organic food and ornamental plant production together with a local artisan industry with an emphasis on Permaculture values.\nThe Island has a very active incorporated residents' association (LIRA - Lamb Island Resident's Association) which is regularly engaged in community improvement projects which have included native tree planting, heritage site restoration/maintenance and general facility upgrades.\nDemographics\nIn the , Lamb Island had a population of 427 people, 50.4% female and 49.6% male.
