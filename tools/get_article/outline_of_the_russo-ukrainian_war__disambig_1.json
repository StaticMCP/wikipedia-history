Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Ukrainian Crimea and supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas war. The first eight years of conflict included naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in a major escalation of the conflict.\nOverview of articles\nTop-level overview articles\n*Russo-Ukrainian war\n;Major overview subdivisions\n*Prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n*Russian invasion of Ukraine\n*Russo-Ukrainian war (2022–present)\n*War in Donbas\n*Russian annexation of Crimea\n*Ukrainian resistance in Russian-occupied Ukraine\nTimelines\n*Timeline of the Russian annexation of Crimea\n*Timeline of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine\n*Timeline of the war in Donbas\n**2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022\n*Timeline of the Russo-Ukrainian war (2022–present):\n**Early 2021  – 23 February 2022: Prelude\n**24 February – 7 April 2022: Initial invasion\n**8 April – 28 August 2022: Southeastern front\n**29 August – 11 November 2022: 2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives\n**12 November 2022 – 7 June 2023: Second stalemate\n**8 June 2023 – 31 August 2023: 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\n**1 September 2023 – 30 November 2023: 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\n**1 December 2023 – 31 March 2024: 2023–2024 winter campaigns\n**1 April 2024 – 31 July 2024: 2024 spring and summer campaigns\n**1 August 2024 – 31 December 2024: 2024 summer–autumn offensives\n**1 January 2025 – 31 May 2025: 2025 winter and spring offensives\n**1 June 2025 – 31 August 2025: 2025 summer offensives\n**1 September 2025 – present: 2025 autumn–winter offensives\nYears in Russia\n*2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025\nYears in Ukraine\n*2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025\nSubjects\nAn alphabetical list of subjects related to the war.
