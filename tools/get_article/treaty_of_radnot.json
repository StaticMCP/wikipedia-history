      "text": "# Treaty of Radnot\n\nTreaty of Radnot was a treaty signed during the Second Northern War in Radnot in Transylvania (now Iernut in Romania) on 6 December 1656. Faced with strongly successful Polish resistance to the Swedish invasion, King Charles X suggested that his adversary be partitioned among Sweden and its allies. The treaty divided the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth between the signing parties.\nAccording to the treaty:\n* Charles X Gustav of Sweden was to receive Royal Prussia, Kujawy, northern Masovia, Samogitia, Courland and Inflanty.\n* Bogusław Radziwiłł was to receive the Nowogródek Voivodeship.\n* Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg was to receive Greater Poland.\n* Bohdan Khmelnytsky was to receive south-eastern parts of the Kingdom of Poland (territories between Batoh and Novhorod-Siverskyi).\n* George II Rákóczi was to receive southern Polish territories, mostly Lesser Poland (including Kraków).\nOne of the main results of the treaty was that George II Rákóczi invaded the Commonwealth in January 1657. The changing geopolitical situation prevented the treaty from ever being fully implemented as the Commonwealth recovered and repulsed the invaders. The treaty is seen as a precursor to the 18th-century partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nReferences\n*Robert I.
