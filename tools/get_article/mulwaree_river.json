The river descends  over its  course.\nTributaries include Bongaralaby Creek and Crisps Creek.\nThe Mulwaree and its associated wetlands are important breeding grounds and drought refuge for Australian birds. These wetlands are listed on the directory of Important Wetlands of Australia.\nSee also\n}}\n* Lake Bathurst (New South Wales)\n* Lake George (New South Wales)\n* List of rivers of New South Wales (L–Z)\n* List of rivers of Australia\n* Rivers of New South Wales\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
