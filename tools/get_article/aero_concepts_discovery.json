The aircraft is supplied as a kit for amateur construction.\nDesign and development\nThe Discovery is a three lifting surface aircraft that features a cantilever mid-wing, a twin boom high tail, a canard surface, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.\nThe aircraft is made from composites. Its  span wing employs a NASA NLF-0215 airfoil and has an area of . The canard uses the same airfoil, while the tailplane uses a NASA 63218. The aircraft's recommended engine power range is  and standard engines used include the  Lycoming O-360 four-stroke powerplant. Construction time from the supplied kit is 1200 hours.\nThe company plans to develop the design into a light-sport aircraft, a jet-powered version and four-seat variant as well.\nOperational history\nBy the end of 2011 three examples had been reported as completed and flown.\nSpecifications (Discovery)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Lycoming O-360\n|eng1 type=four cylinder, air-cooled, four stroke aircraft engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=180\n|prop blade number=\n|prop name=\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=225\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=58\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=650\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=2300\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate ms=\n|sink rate ftmin=\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=13.0\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
