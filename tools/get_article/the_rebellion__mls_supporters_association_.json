The main intent of The Rebellion is to organize, unite, strengthen, and increase support for the New England Revolution. The group is an 501c7 organization. The Rebellion's goal is to support the Revolution at every match by “cheering, singing, ranting, raving, and screaming\" for the Revolution in order to create a loud and intimidating atmosphere at Gillette Stadium. The group hosts watch parties for away matches at several New England restaurants and bars.\nAdditionally the group hosts tailgates in Gillette's lot 3B prior to each home match.\nThe Fort\nThe majority of Rebellion members sit in the North Stands of the stadium (Sections 141, 142, and 143 of Gillette Stadium) in an area dubbed \"The Fort\". The Fort is a general admission section and draws its name from the revolutionary theme which runs through the team and independent supporters' associations. The Fort is open to all supporters of the New England Revolution who want to support their team by singing, chanting, shouting, standing, waving flags, and doing so in the company of other like-minded fans. The other Revolution supporters' group, The Midnight Riders, also stand in The Fort. Chants are led by a \"capo\", an individual standing with their back to the game who conducts the supporters groups.\nHistory\nFormed in 2010, The Rebellion takes its name from the unique role New England played in the rebellion that led to the American Revolution, and a desire to cause a rebellion in New England soccer culture.\nIn 2017, members of the Rebellion collaborated with Big D and the Kids Table to record a song that would be played at Revolution matches.\nIn 2020 The Rebellion launched a fundraising campaign titled \"Rebels for a Cause\" that raised north of $7,000 for COVID-19 economic relief. The effort was originally focused on the group's official supporter's bar The Brass Monkey but was then extended towards others in the group seeking relief.\nIn 2022, The Rebellion formed a partnership with former radio show turned podcast Revolution Recap, a weekly podcast discussing recent New England Revolution news, signings and matches, with an occasional interview of current and former players. Previous guests include Jay Heaps, Christina Unkel, Shalrie Joseph, Jeff Larentowicz, Henry Kessler, and DeJuan Jones.\nThe Supporter's Cup\nSince 2018, The Rebellion have participated in an 11v11, one-off soccer match against the Revolution's other largest supporter's group, The Midnight Riders. The event is aimed at raising funds through ticket sales, attendance, and merchandise sales. A portion of profits are donated to the preferred charities of both groups.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Past Matches\n|-\n! Year !! Winning team !! Score !! Losing team !!

Working with the Obama administration, Sullivan was hired as executive director of Marriage Equality Rhode Island, a 501(c)(4) organization. He actively worked to support full marriage equality instead of a \"discriminatory\" civil unions bill.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Past Winners:\n|-\n! Years !!
