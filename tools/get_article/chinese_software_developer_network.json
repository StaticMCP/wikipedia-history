CSDN provides Web forums, blog hosting, IT news, and other services. CSDN has about 10 million registered users and is the largest developer community in China.\nServices offered\n* Web forums with a ranking system and similar topics\n* Blog hosting [http://blog.csdn.net], with 69,484 bloggers at April 7, 2005\n* Document Center [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408030019/http://dev.csdn.net/], a selection of blog articles\n* IT News [https://web.archive.org/web/20050406215414/http://www.csdn.net/news/]\n* IT job hunting [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408034818/http://www.csdn.net/job/] and training [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408032836/http://training.csdn.net/] services\n* Online bookmark service [http://www.365key.com]\nWeb Forum\nThe CSDN community website is where Chinese software programmers seek advice. A poster describes a problem, posts it in the forum with a price in CSDN points, and then waits for replies. On some popular boards, a poster will get a response in a few hours, if not minutes. Most replies are short but enough to point out the mistake and give possible solutions. Some posts include code and may grow to several pages. The majority of posts are written in Simplified Chinese, although Traditional Chinese and English posts are not uncommon. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LZFHzZd7TSYC&dq=csdn+china&pg=RA10-PA1003].\nTopics are mainly IT related and focused on programming, but political and life topics are also active. The forums were closed for two weeks in June 2004. This was likely for political reasons, because many political words, such as the names of political leaders and organizations, have been banned in posts since then. However, political discussions with intentional misspellings are still active.\nBlog\nThe site hosts many IT blogs, but the large number of bloggers makes the server slow. In December 2005, Baidu rated CSDN as one of the top Chinese blog service providers.[http://english.people.com.cn/200512/20/eng20051220_229546.html]\nCollaboration with Microsoft\nCSDN started cooperation with Microsoft in 2002, and several Microsoft technical support staff have provided their support in CSDN forums since then. CSDN is also a major source of Chinese Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals.\nCriticism\nSome people have complained about the CPU-consuming XML page format of the web forum. Others have complained about its unfriendly interface in browsers other than Internet Explorer. Nevertheless, the website receives 1.3 million hits every day, according to Alexa[http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&range=1y&size=medium&compare_sites=&y=r&url=community.csdn.net#top] .\nUser information leakage\nIn December 2011, the information of 6,000,000 CSDN users was reported to be leaked[https://web.archive.org/web/20181003220835/https://www.rcesecurity.com/2011/12/china-software-developer-network-csdn-leaked-6-million-user-data/]. This serious security problem was caused by storing user's passwords in clear text without any hashing/encryption in the CSDN database.\nSee also\n* Software industry in China\n* China Software Industry Association\nExternal links\n* [http://www.csdn.net/ Official website] of Bailian Midami Digital Technology Co., Ltd.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050305141319/http://www.palmsource.com/press/2003/120803_csdn.html PalmSource and CSDN Launch New Online Forum for Chinese Developer Community]\n* [https://www.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9310.2005.00418.x Sources of knowledge acquisition for Chinese software engineers]"
