Pay in London voluntary hospitals was between 6 shillings and 9s 6d a week, with some board and lodging. Outside London, pay was much lower.  Few nurses were described as educated.  Facilities in hospitals were poor, though some began to provide meals for nurses. The designation sister arose from the ministry of religious sisters, who were recruited separately from nurses and were more respectable, honest and conscientiously devoted to the welfare of patients (which often brought them into conflict with the hospital authorities). Matrons, whose work was largely administrative, were even more so. The Nursing Sisters of St John the Divine (est. 1848) and the All Saints Sisters of the Poor (1851) provided the nursing staff for several of London's largest teaching hospitals, including King's College, Charing Cross and University College Hospitals until close to the end of the century.\nNursing in the Poor Law infirmaries was largely carried out by able-bodied paupers, who were not paid. In 1866 there were a total of 53 nurses employed in the 11 metropolitan workhouses, at an average annual salary of £20 18s (equivalent to 8 shillings per week).\nFlorence Nightingale\nFlorence Nightingale\nFlorence Nightingale (12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910) was an English social reformer, statistician and is seen by many as the founder of modern nursing. Nightingale came to prominence while serving as a manager and trainer of nurses during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers at Constantinople. She significantly reduced death rates by improving hygiene and living standards. In 1860, she laid the foundation of professional nursing with the establishment of her nursing school at St Thomas' Hospital in London. It was the first secular nursing school in the world and led to the development of formalised nurse-training in the UK.\nOther women involved in nursing in the Crimea were Betsi Cadwaladr and Mary Seacole.\n1858–1900\nDevelopments in nurse education\nIn 1881 Eva Luckes, Matron of The London Hospital established the first two year training scheme in London. She instituted a series of lectures by herself, a surgeon and a physician. In 1884 she introduced the precursor to Sister -Tutors, and selected two of her most trusted and skilled hospital sisters to give probationers extra tuition. Before this the nurses home Sisters at St Thomas's Hospital used to lecture probationers from the Nightingale School. In 1895 Luckes introduced the first Preliminary Training School for Nurses in England similar to that established by Rebecca Strong at Glasgow Infirmary in 1893. This became the blueprint  for nurses education following the Nurses Registration Act of 1919.\n1850–1870\n* 1858  state registration of the medical professions began, prompting calls for a similar system for nursing\n* 1859 Notes on Nursing by Florence Nightingale was published\n* 1860 Nightingale School of Nursing established at St Thomas' Hospital in London\n1870–1900\n* 1879 Workhouse Infirmary Nursing Association was created\n* 1881 Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps (QARANC) was formed\n* 1886 The Hospital (journal) (1886-1924) was launched\n* 1887 British Hospitals Association established the first UK register of trained nurses for those who could show that they had worked for at least a year in a hospital or an infirmary and had been trained in the duties of a nurse.\n* 1887 Queen's Nursing Institute (QNI) was created\n* 1887 Royal British Nurses' Association (RBNA) was created by Ethel Gordon Fenwick. It campaigned for the establishment of a register of nurses. It wanted the training to last three years with national standards. They set up a voluntary register in opposition to that of the British Hospitals Association. Princess Helena, one of Queen Victoria's daughters played a central role in sponsoring and legitimizing the profession. Helena had a firm interest in nursing, and was the first President of the British Nurses' Association.\n* 1888 Nursing Record a nursing journal, was created\n* 1889 Queen's Nursing Institute Scotland (QNIS) was formed\n* 1894 Matrons' Council for Great Britain and Ireland was established\n* 1897 National Association of Workhouse Masters and Matrons was created.\nMilitary nursing\nNightingale laid the foundations of professional nursing with the principles summarised in the book Notes on Nursing. Her highly publicised exposure of the abysmal care afforded sick and wounded soldiers energized reformers. In 1860 Queen Victoria ordered a hospital to be built to train Army nurses and surgeons. The Royal Victoria Hospital opened in 1863 at Netley and admitted and cared for military patients. Nurses were formally appointed to Military General Hospitals from 1866.\nThe Army Nursing Service (ANS) oversaw the work of the nurses starting in 1881. These military nurses were sent overseas beginning with the First Boer War (often called Zulu War) from 1879 to 1881. They were also dispatched to serve during the Egyptian Campaign in 1882 and the Sudan War of 1883 to 1884. During the Sudan War members of the Army Nursing Service nursed in hospital ships on the Nile as well as the Citadel in Cairo. Almost 2000 nurses served during the second Boer War, the Anglo-Boer War of 1899 to 1902, alongside nurses who were part of the colonial armies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand. They served in tented field hospitals. 23 Army Nursing sisters from Britain lost their lives from disease outbreaks.\nPrincess Helena was also President of the Army Nursing Service. Following Queen Victoria's death, Queen Alexandra took over the presidency, but Helena retained presidency of the Army Nursing Reserve.\n20th century\n1900–1914\nThe pressure for state registration grew throughout the 1890s and continued in the pre-War period, but was undermined by disagreements within the profession over the desired form and purpose of the regulatory system.  There were six failed attempts between 1904 and 1918, the British parliament passed the bill allowing formal nurse registration. A government committee reported in 1904 setting out a detailed and persuasive case for registration. However, the government sat on the report and took no action. Over the next decade, a number of Private Member's Bills to establish regulation were introduced but all failed to achieve significant support in Parliament.\nIn 1901 there were 3,170 paid nurses employed in workhouses, with about 2,000 probationers - about one nurse for 20 patients. In total there were about 63,500 female nurses and 5,700 male nurses in England and Wales, working both in institutions and, the majority, in patients homes. The men were almost entirely mental nurses and were not admitted to nurse training schools. Nurses in workhouses were paid about £17 a year. Hospital nurses in 1902 were paid around £19 a year, but the cost of maintenance, laundry, uniforms and accommodation which were provided was around £30 a year. In domiciliary work two guineas a week with meals provided was normal pay, and the work was easier. In hospitals 12-hour days were normal.\n* In March 1902, Queen Alexandra’s Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS) was established, named after Queen Alexandra, who became its President.\n* 1902 Midwives Act was passed, introducing state regulation of Midwives, prompting calls for a similar system for nurses\n* 1904 a House of Commons Select committee was established to consider the registration of nurses, but no action was forthcoming\n* 1905 Nursing Times (journal) was launched\n* 1907 First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY) was created.  Confusingly their main roles were not as nurses but as ambulance drivers and as the organisers and administrators of hospital and casualty clearing stations for the Belgian and French armies.\n* 1908 the Fever Nurses Association was created\n* 1908 the National Council of Nurses was formed.\n* 1909 Voluntary Aid Detachment Nurses (VADs) was formed\n1914-1920\nFirst World War\nBy the beginning of the First World War in 1914, military nursing still had only a small role for women in Britain; 10,500 nurses enrolled in Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS) and the Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service. These services dated to 1902 and 1918, and enjoyed royal sponsorship. There also were 74,000 Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurses who had been enrolled by the Red Cross. The ranks that were created for the new nursing services were Matron-in-Chief, Principal Matron, Sister and Staff Nurses. Women joined steadily throughout the War. At the end of 1914, there were 2,223 regular and reserve members of the QAIMNS and when the war ended there were 10,404 trained nurses in the QAIMNS.\nThe First World War provided the final impetus to the establishment of nursing regulation, partly because of the specific contribution made by nurses to the war effort and also as a reflection of the increased contribution of women more generally in society. The College of Nursing (later the Royal College of Nursing) was established in 1916 and three years later persuaded a backbench Member of Parliament (MP), Major Richard Barnett, to introduce a private members bill to establish a regulatory system.\nThe bill was finally passed in December 1919 and separate Nurses Registration Acts were passed for England/Wales, Scotland and Ireland, which was still part of the United Kingdom at the time. These acts established the General Nursing Council for England and Wales and the other bodies which survived intact until the legislative changes in 1979 which were to create the UKCC and the National Boards of Nursing. Ethel Gordon Fenwick was the first nurse on the English register.\n*1914-1918 the First World War had a significant impact on the professionalisation of nursing (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918),\n*1916 College of Nursing was founded by Arthur Stanley (politician) Sarah Ann Swift Rachael Cox-Davies and Sidney Browne. they established a third voluntary register of nurses in addition to those of the British Hospitals Association and the Royal British Nurses' Association.  All three lobbied for the Nurses Registration Act\n* 1915 National Association of Masters and Matrons of Poor Law Institutions was created\n* 1917 Cavell Nurses' Trust was created\n* 1918 The National Asylum Workers' Union organised strikes at Prestwich Hospital, Whittingham Hospital and Bodmin Hospital . It threatened to organise strikes in all the London asylums in support of a 48-hour week in 1919.\n* 1919 the Association of Hospital Matrons was created\n* 1919 the Professional Union of Trained Nurses (PUTN) was created.\n* December 1919 the Nurses Registration Act 1919 was passed, the General Nursing Council (GNC) was created, and the Ministry of Health established The RBNA gradually went into decline following the Nurses Registration Act 1919; meanwhile the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), and the RBNA lost membership and dominance.\n1920s\nIn the 1921 Census 111,501 women and 11,000 men declared that they were nurses. The registration regime stopped the very small hospitals from offering training. The first national examination was in 1925. About 40% of the candidates failed.\nThe Labour Party produced its first draft policy statement on the profession in 1926, advocating a 48-hour week, the separation of training schools from hospitals and advocating that the profession should be organised on Trade Union lines.\n* 1921 Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service (PMRAFNS) was created\n* 1922 The State Register of Nurses was first published by the General Nursing Council\n* 1926 British College of Nurses (BCN) was created\n* 1928 Florence Nightingale Fellowship (FNF) was created\n1930s\nIn the 1931 Census 138,670 women and 15,000 men declared that they were nurses. 88% of the women were single, 5% married and 7% widowed or divorced.\nIn 1930 nurses in the voluntary hospitals worked 117 hours a fortnight in London and 119 in the provinces. In 1936 the London County Council introduced a standard 54 hour week for nurses and in 1938 moved to a 96-hour fortnight.\nIn 1937 the Trades Union Congress adopted a \"Nurses’ Charter\", demanding a  96-hour fortnight, improvement of the amenities of nurses’ homes and arguing that nurses should be able to live out. At that time the average nurse was working 104 hours per fortnight.\n* 1934 Florence Nightingale Foundation was formed\n* In 1935 county councils began training courses for assistant nurses to care for the chronic sick\n* 1937 Society of Registered Male Nurses was created\n* 1937 National Nurses Association was created\n* 1938 Association of British Paediatric Nurses was created\n* 1939 Royal College of Nursing incorporates 'royal' to its name\n*1939 the Ministry of Health and Board of Education published the Athlone Report, an Interim Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Nursing Services – which focused on nursing recruitment, retention and skills.\n1940s\n*  1941-1949 The RCN's Horder Committee (1941-1949) sat in response to the 1939 Athlone Report, published four reports.\n*  October 1941 Nurses Salaries Committee was established with Lord Rushcliffe as chair.\n*  Nurses Act 1943 was passed.  It directed the General Nursing Council to regulate state enrolled nurses (until 1961 called 'Assistant Nurses') with two years' training instead of the three years' required for Registered nurses.  The Act set out the formation, maintenance and publication of the roll and to establish conditions of admission to and removal from the roll. Unlike the Register of Nurses, the Roll included male and female assistant nurses on one list.\n*  1943 Nurses Salaries Committee or Rushcliffe Report published two reports.  It was the first official body to fix salary scales and conditions for nursing in England.\n* 1947 the Ministry of Health, Department of Health for Scotland, and Ministry of Labour and National Service (Wood Committee) published its Report of the Working Party on the Recruitment and Training of Nurses\n* By 1949 there were about 1300 registered male nurses; numbers of male nurses increased as demobilised service men with medical experience join the profession.\n* 1948 The National Health Service (NHS) was launched.\n* Whitley Councils established for nursing.  Pay for student nurses was set at £200 with a deduction of £100, and for staff nurses £315, rising by increments to £415 with a deduction of £120 for board and lodging.\n* 1948 Marie Curie Nurses formed\n* 1949 the Queen Alexandra’s Imperial Military Nursing Service became a corps in the British Army and was renamed as the '''Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps'''.\nSecond World War 1939-45\nThe armed forces estimated at the beginning of the war that they needed 5000 trained nurses. Up to 67,000 were thought to be needed to care for the expected air-raid casualties. This was more than the number of trained nurses in employment. A Civil Nursing Reserve was set up - 7000 trained nurses, 3000 assistant nurses and also nursing auxiliaries. The auxiliaries were given fifty hours training in hospital before they started work. After protests it was agreed that they should not do domestic work. 6,200 from the Civil Nursing Reserve were working in hospitals in June 1940.\nThe Ministry of Health guaranteed a salary of £40 to nursing students in training, about double what voluntary hospitals were paying before the war.\nDuring the war nurses belonged to Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS), as they had during World War I. (Nurses belonging to the QAIMNS are informally called \"QA\"s.) Members of the Army Nursing Service served in every overseas British military campaign during World War II, as well as at military hospitals in Britain. At the beginning of World War II, nurses held officer status with equivalent rank, but were not commissioned officers. In 1941, emergency commissions and a rank structure were created, conforming with the structure used in the rest of the British Army. Nurses were given rank badges and were now able to be promoted to ranks from Lieutenant through to Brigadier. Nurses were exposed to all dangers during the War, and some were captured and became prisoners of war.Two hundred and thirty-six nurses died as a consequence of the war. Five nurses who trained at the Royal Victoria Hospital Belfast, N. Ireland died in service. Ruth Hannah Dickson had served in WW1. She re-joined the QA/Rs in Singapore having been a missionary in China. The evacuation ship she was aboard was hit by a Japanese U-boat as it left Singapore. She survived the attack to be taken Prisoner of War and died in a concentration camp in 1944. Ellen Lowry and Ida Nelson were nursing with the Colonial Service in Singapore. Their ship was also attacked leaving Singapore and they drowned. Doreen Pedlow QA was aboard a ship leaving Singapore when it too was hit. Doreen drifted for three days on a raft before she died. Beatrice Dowling was serving with the Naval Nursing Service in Singapore when she too died at sea. TheirIne 5 names are on the Roll of Honour in Westminster Abbey. At the outbreak of WW2 there were 640 nurses attached to QAIMNS. By the end of the war this number had risen through the recruitment of reservists to 12,000.\n1950s\n* 1950 Queen Alexandra’s Imperial Military Nursing Service trained nurses.\n* Large influx of Commonwealth entrants into British nurse training, in particular Caribbean, African and Irish\n* Introduction of tranquillisers transforms mental health nursing.\n* Male nurses join the main nursing register in 1951.\n* 2nd Lt. Nurse Abbie Sweetwine of 494th Medical Group of the United States Air Force ran triage at the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash based on her military field experience. The success of the team's response is credited with inspiring the development of the use of paramedics in Britain.\n* University of Edinburgh ran the first course for clinical nurse teachers.\n* The Mental Health Act 1959 abolishes the legal separation of psychiatric hospitals, allowing those patients to be admitted to any hospital.\n* By 1959 most hospital nurses were working an 88-hour fortnight.\n1960s\nThe availability of sterile supplies brought an end to washing and sterilisation of equipment such as dressings and syringes. Edinburgh initiated the first degree in nursing. Charlotte Bentley of the \"National Association of State Enrolled Assistant Nurses\" worked with Irene Ward who was a member of parliament for Tynemouth and a private member's bill, the \"Nurses (Amendment) Act, 1961\", passed through parliament to remove the demeaning \"assistant\" from the State Enrolled Nurse's job title.\n* In 1960 the University of Edinburgh was the 1st UK higher education institution to offer a pre-registration bachelor’s degree in nursing\n* In 1961 it was considered that the use of the term 'Assistant Nurse' was hindering recruitment and the Enrolled Nurses Rules Approval Instrument SI 1961/1519 changed the name to State Enrolled Nurse and the Roll of Assistant Nurses became the Roll of Nurses\n* The Nursing Homes Act 1963 brings registration and greater control by local authorities.\n* 1964 Daphne Steele becomes the first Black British matron.\n* 1964 The RCN published its Platt Report 1964 on the Reform of Nursing Education.\n* The Nurses Act 1964 gave the General Nursing Council the authority to regulate state enrolled nurses for mental health nurses and learning disability nurses by creating two additional rolls.\n* 1966 the Salmon Report on Senior Nursing Staff Structure called for reform to nurse grading, initiating the end of matrons.\n* 1967 Nurse Dame Cicely Saunders set up the first hospice.\n* Termination of pregnancy becomes legal under the Abortion Act 1967.\n* In 1969 the University of Manchester offered an integrated degree programme in nursing, health visiting, district nursing and midwifery\n* 1969 the government published the Mayston Report on Management Structure in Local Authority Nursing Services.\n1970s\nThe 1972 Briggs Report of the Committee on Nursing in the United Kingdom reviewed the role of nurses and midwives in hospitals and in community care. It made recommendations on education, training, and professional regulation  . The report was accepted in 1974, but recommendations from the Briggs Report were not implemented until 1979 when it formed the basis of the Midwives and Health Visitors Act (1979).\nDegrees in Nursing became more widely offered through universities and polytechnics which combined higher level study and practical clinical ward based training. Newcastle Polytechnic, Leeds Polytechnic, Manchester University, London University and Liverpool University were the first. Each course was different. All led to SRN - State Registration in addition to a Degree (either B.Sc or B.A). Some also included additional certifications such as: Certificate in Obstetrics (Newcastle), Certificate in Health Visiting (Liverpool). Student nurses on these courses were unpaid, but may have been eligible for mandatory/ concessionary student grants. Unlike traditional hospital training courses which took 3yrs, a Nursing Degree course lasted between 4 and 4.5 yrs.\n* 1972 the Briggs Parliamentary Report was published.\n* 1974 the Halsbury Report was published by the government's independent Committee of Inquiry into the Pay and Related Conditions of Service of Nurses and Midwives;  the government implemented its recommendations for an average 33% pay rise for nurses.\n* Manchester University appoints the first professor of nursing.\n* 1977 Royal College of Nursing (RCN) registers as a trade union.\n* The Nursing Process establishes an ethos based on assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation.\n* Reform of shift patterns begins\n1980s\nIn 1983, the UKCC was set up. Its core functions were to maintain a register of UK nurses, midwives and health visitors, provide guidance to registrants, and handle professional misconduct complaints.  At the same time, National Boards were created for each of the UK countries.  Their main functions were to monitor the quality of nursing and midwifery education courses, and to maintain the training records of students on these courses.\nThis structure survived with minor modifications until April 2002, when the UKCC ceased to exist and its functions were taken over by a new Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). The English National Board was also abolished and its quality assurance function was taken on board by the NMC. The other National Boards were also abolished, but new bodies were created in each country to take over their functions, for example, NES in Scotland.\n* Mass meetings are held over pay, the state of the NHS, clinical grading and the abolition of the enrolled nurse.\n* 1982 Primary Health Care (magazine) was launched - aimed at community health nurses\n* 1983 the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) became the profession's new regulatory body..\n* 1985 the RCN published its Judge Report on Nursing Education\n* 1986 the government published the Cumberlege Report 1986 'Neighbourhood nursing: a focus for care' which recommended that community nurses be permitted to prescribe from a restricted list of treatments.\n* 1987 Nursing Standard launched\n* 1989 Nursing Children and Young People (journal) launched as Paediatric Nursing\n1990s\n* Reforms to training under Project 2000 begin to be implemented.\n* Post-registration education introduced.\n* Nurse-led helpline NHS Direct founded\n* 1992 men were allowed to join the Queen Alexandra’s Imperial Military Nursing Service\n* 1994 Nursing Management (journal) launched\n* 1996 British Journal of Community Nursing launched\n* 1997 Journal of Child Health Care launched\n* 1998 Evidence-Based Nursing (journal) launched\n* 1998 Learning Disability Practice (journal) launched\n* 19980 Mental Health Practice (journal) launched\n21st century\n2000s\n* Health care reforms set out in [http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4002960&chk=07GL5R The NHS Plan] .\n* Agenda for Change paves the way for a new pay structure for nurses.\n* Nurse employers inspected for staff-friendly policies under [http://www.dh.gov.uk/PolicyAndGuidance/HumanResourcesAndTraining/ModelEmployer/ImprovingWorkingLives/fs/en Improving Working Lives] and Investors in People.\n* By 2001, nearly half of the newly registered nurses were immigrants, especially from the Philippines, India, South Africa, Australia and Nigeria, as compared to 10% in 1990,\n* 2002 Nursing and Midwifery Council replaced the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC).\n* 2003 Gastrointestinal Nursing journal launched\n* In 2005 nurse numbers reached 397,500 – an all-time high.\n* In 2005 the NMC register, with its 15 sub-parts, was revised to just three parts: nurses, midwives and specialist community public health nurses.\n* Nursing students are given supernumerary status throughout their three years of training.\n* 2006 383,000 qualified nurses and midwives were employed by the NHS, a 24% gain over 1997.\n* 2006 British Journal of Cardiac Nursing launched\n* In 2008 the NMC decided that the minimum academic level for all pre-registration nursing education would in future be a bachelor’s degree.
