The problem with this system became obvious the first year, since Karl Struss and Charles Rosher were nominated for their work together on Sunrise. Still, three other films shot individually by either Rosher or Struss were also listed as part of the nomination. In the second year, 1929, there were no nominations at all, although the Academy has a list of unofficial titles that were under consideration by the Board of Judges. In the third year, 1930, films, not cinematographers, were nominated, and the final award did not show the cinematographer's name.\nFinally, for the 1931 awards, the modern system in which individuals are nominated for a single film was adopted in all profession-related categories. From 1939 to 1966 with the exception of 1957, there were also separate awards for color and black-and-white cinematography. After ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), the most recent black-and-white films to win since then are Schindler's List (1993), Roma (2018) and Mank (2020).\nFloyd Crosby won the award for Tabu in 1931, which was the last silent film to win in this category. Hal Mohr won the only write-in Academy Award ever, in 1935 for A Midsummer Night's Dream. Mohr was also the first person to win for both black-and-white and color cinematography.\nNo winners are lost, although some of the earliest nominees (and of the unofficial nominees of 1928–29) are lost, including The Devil Dancer (1927), The Magic Flame (1927), and 4 Devils (1928). The Right to Love (1930) is incomplete, and Sadie Thompson (1927) is incomplete and partially reconstructed with stills.\nDavid Lean holds the record for the director with the most films that won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the Oscars with five wins out of six nominations for Great Expectations, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, and Ryan's Daughter.\nThe first nominees shot primarily on digital video were The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Slumdog Millionaire in 2009, with Slumdog Millionaire being the first winner. The following year, Avatar was the first nominee and winner to be shot entirely on digital video.\nIn January 2017, Bradford Young became the first African-American cinematographer to be nominated for an Academy Award, for his work on Arrival.\nIn 2018, Rachel Morrison became the first woman to receive a nomination. Prior to that, it had been the last non-acting Academy Award category to never nominate a woman.\nIn 2019, Alfonso Cuarón became the first winner of this category to have also served as director on the film, for Roma''. This followed a public dispute between Cuarón and the Academy over the Academy's plan to shorten the Oscars broadcast by relegating four awards, including cinematography, to the commercial breaks in the show. Cuarón objected by saying, \"In the history of cinema, masterpieces have existed without sound, without color, without a story, without actors and without music. No single film has ever existed without cinematography ...\"\nSuperlatives\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:250px;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:250px;\"| Superlative\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:350px;\"| Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=2|Most awards\n| Leon Shamroy\n| rowspan=2|4 awards\n| 1942\n| Awards resulted from 18 nominations.\n|-\n| Joseph Ruttenberg\n| 1958\n| Awards resulted from 10 nominations.\n|-\n| rowspan=2|Most nominations\n| Leon Shamroy\n| rowspan=2|18 nominations\n| 1965\n| Nominations resulted in 4 awards.\n|-\n| Charles Lang\n| 1972\n| Nominations resulted in 1 award.\n|-\n| Most consecutive awards\n| Emmanuel Lubezki\n| 3 consecutive awards\n| 2013, 2014, 2015\n| Awards resulted from 8 nominations.\n|-\n| Oldest winner\n| Conrad L.
