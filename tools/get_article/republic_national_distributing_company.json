In 2019, its revenue was US $11 billion.\nHistory\nDistribution Tier\nThe Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution repealing prohibition led to the creation of a three-tier state-based system of beverage alcohol regulation consisting of the product supplier, distributors who are licensed by the state, and the retail seller.  Individual states are provided with the right to control how alcohol is distributed within their own borders.\nCompany Evolution\nThe earliest predecessor company of RNDC traces its roots back to a single distributorship founded in 1898 in Pensacola, Florida.  RNDC was created on May 1, 2007, following the successful merger of the former Republic Beverage Company and National Distributing Company.  Both companies were successful, privately owned liquor wholesalers that possessed complementary characteristics, making them a perfect fit for a large scale merger.  Acquisitions have included Julius Schepps Co. in Texas, N. Goldring, Inc. in Florida, and Best Brands of Oklahoma. It completed an acquisition of Young's Market Company in November, 2022, including Alaska, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.\nRNDC Today\nCompany Locations\nThe Company distributes products within its specific markets for a wide variety of beverage alcohol suppliers ranging in size from local and regional producers to national and multinational corporations.  RNDC operates a total of 42 U.S. office and warehouse locations across 34 states and the District of Columbia.\nCompany Statistics and Rankings\nRNDC is a privately held company.  In 2010, the company was ranked 71st on Forbes' list of America's largest privately held companies. By 2021, the company had risen to be ranked 25th on the Forbes’ list.\nWithdrawal from California\nRNDC abruptly left the California market with a complete layoff of employees effective September 2, 2025.\nControversy\nRNDC partner Chris Carlos, member of the  RNDC board was escorted out of an Atlanta Hawks game in 2021 after loud comments to LeBron James that James described as \"out of bounds\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rndc-usa.com Republic National Distributing Company website]\n*[https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/list/ Forbes America's Largest Private Companies website]"
