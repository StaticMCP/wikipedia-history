In addition, part of the Battle of the Frontiers was also fought in Lorraine.\nMemorials of Morhange, Moselle\nMonument to the 15th Army Corps in Vergaville French Military Cemetery\nIn the French Military Cemetery at Vergaville is a monument dedicated to the 15th Army Corps. It depicts within an arch, a Lorraine woman holding in her arms a dying soldier.  The monument was organised by public subscription on the initiative of the parents of some of the victims of the fighting in the Morhange area in August 1914.  It is the work of the sculptor Petit and was designed by the architect Pialat from Uzès, whose son was killed at Dieuze. The inauguration took place on 22 August 1926.  The cemetery at Vergaville, which is 4 kilometres north of Dieuze, contains the bodies of soldiers killed in the 19 to 20 August fighting.\nMonument at Bidestroff\nThis memorial is dedicated to the men of the 15th Army Corps, part of the 29th Division, and to 1,204 French soldiers who lost their lives in the fighting at Morhange.  The monument is located between Bidestroff and Vergaville. The men of the 15th mainly came from Provence and were the victims of a particularly heavy artillery bombardment, when caught on the high ground at Bidestroff, which left 1,204 dead on the battlefield.\nIt was in 1935 and on the initiative of the parish priest and the Bidestroff mayor, that a committee was set up which led to the monument being erected.  Most of the funds were collected from veterans in Toulon, and the Strasbourg sculptor Valentin Jaeg was commissioned to carry out the sculptural work involved.  The monument is 12.5 metres high and at the top is the figure of the Archangel St Michael who raises his arms to heaven. St Michael is the patron saint of Bidestroff.\nAt the base there are groups of crosses on each of the monument's four faces, each inscribed with the name of one of the units of the 15th Army Corps. These surround the Cross of Christ. The inscriptions on the monument read  and\nFrench Military Cemetery at Riche\nThe Riche French Military Cemetery lies midway between Morhange to the north and Riche to the south.\nThere is a monument located in the Riche Military Cemetery that remembers the men who fell fighting at Morhange. Riche lies just to the south of Morhange.\nThe inscription reads\nAt the side of the cemetery is a small chapel dating back to 1928. This has been roped off from the public owing to falling masonry. This is a pity as there are some magnificent stained glass windows in the chapel, of which four tell the history of the 20th Infantry Division.\nThe cemetery contains the remains of 2,574 French soldiers, with 1,088 individual graves and two ossuaries containing the remains of 1,486 men. 577 of these were not identified. Most of those buried were killed in the fighting at Morhange. This particular cemetery contains the grave of the son of General Joseph Curières de Castelnau, who was killed on 20 August 1914. There are also 158 Russian graves of a later war period and a Russian mass grave with an unknown number of Russian soldiers buried in it.\nMemorial to the Battle of Morhange\nThis simple obelisk in granite remembers the soldiers who died in the battle of Morhange.  Erected in the inter-war years, it was destroyed by the Germans during their occupation in the Second World War and rebuilt in 1964.  Near to the obelisk there is a mounted map showing the field of battle so that one can visualise the events of the two days of the battle. The monument was inaugurated on 20 August 1921 and has a height of 10 metres.  It carries the simple inscription\nFranco-German in Frémery\nThis comprises two ossuaries, one for German soldiers and the other for French soldiers.

All the men involved were killed nearby on 20 August 1914.\nThe German War Cemetery at Morhange\nThis cemetery holds the remains of 4,753 German soldiers. 1,965 soldiers have individual graves and there are two ossuaries containing the remains of 2,788 soldiers, of whom 72 men are unknown.  The German War Cemetery of Morhange was created by the German military administration in August 1914, during the Battle of Morhange as part of the existing German garrison cemetery. After the war, the French military authorities exhumed the French war dead and took them to their own cemetery and the bodies of German soldiers were collected from many other locations in the area and re-buried in this cemetery. The soldiers buried here were fighting in the area during the period of 20 to 23 August 1914 and early September.  Later additions to the cemetery were the bodies of men who had fallen during the trench fighting in the years 1915-1918 or who died of their wounds in the nearby military hospitals. The majority of the soldiers buried here belonged to military units from Bavaria but there were also soldiers from Thuringia, Brandenburg, Alsace, Lorraine, Silesia, West Prussia, Hesse-Cassel, Mecklenburg and Schleswig-Holstein and Hanover and Brunswick.\nIn Lorraine there are also German Military Cemeteries at Bouillonville holding the remains of 1,368 soldiers, at Fey where 2,006 soldiers are buried with 500 unidentified.  There is also a German cemetery at Thiaucourt with the remains of 11,685 soldiers.  2,980 of these are in an ossuary; 2,645 could not be identified.

The inscription reads - 2,344 men were to die in captivity and the inscription adds a thank you to the kindness of the people of Alsace and Lorraine.\nAlso in Dieuze there is a memorial to those French soldiers who were killed fighting in Romania. The sculptural work here is by Remus Botar Botarro and the monument was inaugurated on 9 November 1998.\nMonuments linked to the Battle of the Grande Couronné in Meurthe et Moselle\nThe Military Cemetery at Courbesseaux\nCourbesseaux in Meurthe-et-Moselle was the scene of fighting on 25 August 1914, and was totally destroyed during the war.  The military cemetery here holds the bodies of 2,679 soldiers, many of whom had died at Grand-Couronné. 1,703 of the dead could not be identified and their remains lie in 2 ossuaries.  There are two monuments in the cemetery.  One by Eugène Gatelet was erected in 1924 and shows a young peasant laying a wreath on the tomb of a soldier and in 1964 a simple monument was erected in memory of Edouard de Castelnau,\nThe memorial to the 11th Division at Léomont\nThe most south-easterly point of the Grande Couronné was at Léomont, where the ground rises to 377 metres giving excellent views over the surrounding countryside. It was an important hill to hold to protect Nancy. Fierce fighting took place here in 1914 between the French 11th Division and German units from Bavaria. Indeed, on the night of 25 to 26 August 1914 the area changed hands 8 times. The 11th Infantry Division, consisting of the 26th, 37th, 69th and 79th Infantry Regiments as well as gunners from the 8th and sappers from the 20th, was known as the \"Iron Division\". The citation on the monument reads\nApart from their efforts at Léomont, the 11th had fought at Lunéville and Friscati and had played an important role in protecting Nancy. The original monument, erected in 1922, was destroyed by the Germans in 1940 and reconstructed in 1950. It depicts a soldier mounting guard and protecting Nancy. The original sculpture was the work of Gaston Broquet and when the monument was rebuilt the sculptor, J. Sinapi, faithfully copied Broquet's original work.\nWar memorial at Samogneux\nThe war memorial here features a sculpture by Gaston Broquet which depicts a terrified young soldier trying to put his gas mask on.  The work is entitled \"L'alerte aux gaz\"\nSamogneux was involved in the Battle of Verdun and the French Infantry Regiments 112th, 173rd, 126th and 335th fought there.\nThe monument at Ste Geneviève\nSainte-Geneviève is located in Meurthe-et-Moselle, south of Pont-a-Mousson and east of Nomeny and is in the area known as the Grand Couronné, where most of the 2nd French Army found themselves after the Battle of the Trouée.  The latter had been the Germans' first attempt to break the French line after the encounters at Morhange and Sarrebourg, and they now decided to mount two major attacks on the French. One was aimed at Saint-Dié and resulted in the Battle of the Haute Meurthe, and the second was aimed at taking Nancy and led to the Battle of Grand Couronné. One of the monuments dedicated to the memory of this battle is at Ste Geneviève and is known as the \"Monument du Grand Couronné\".  The monument stands on the heights of the Côte de Ste Geneviève and it was here that the French stationed their 59th Reserve Division. The monument is inscribed\nMarin was an influential local politician and the leader of the \"National Republican Party\" of Meurthe-et-Moselle, the President of the General Council of Nomeny and from 1934 to 1952 he was Chairman of the General Council of Meurthe-et-Moselle.  The monument is somewhat worn and at each end of a curved wall are depictions of Joan of Arc and St Genevieve.\nCroix des Carmes and the Bois-le-Prêtre\nThis monument is in the Bois-le-Prêtre near Montaumont, not far from Pont-à-Mousson in Meurthe-et-Moselle.  Between September 1914 and July 1915 there was fierce and bloody fighting here between the French 73rd and 128th Infantry Division (known as the \" Wolves of Bois-le-Prêtre\") and the German 121st Infantry Division; a wooden cross was erected by the French soldiers and called the \"Croix des Carmes\".  This cross was subsequently moved to the French War cemetery at Pétant for protection.\nIn 1923, the soldiers who had fought at Bois-le-Prêtre raised funds to replace the original cross with this monument. The sculptural work is by Emile Just Bachelet.  His composition involves a large cross whose transverse is supported by two soldiers.  One wears the uniform worn by the French in 1914 and the other the standard uniform worn at the war's end.  The original cross has been bedded into the monument and Bachelet's maquette is held in the Musée de l'École de Nancy.\nRaymond Poincaré attended the inauguration, which took place on 23 September 1923.  The stained glass artist Jacques Grüber depicted the inauguration in 1924 on a window in the church of Saint-Gorgon in Fey-en-Haye nearby.\nThe Military Cemetery at Champenoux\nThis cemetery at Champenoux in Meurthe-et-Moselle was created in 1919; it holds the remains of many of the victims of the Grand-Couronné battle. Three ossuaries hold 2,862 bodies, of whom 1,261 could not be identified.  In the cemetery there is a granite monument with a bronze relief by Eugène Gatelet. It was erected by Souvenir Français in 1921 and is dedicated to \"aux héros du Grand-Couronné\". Gatelet also worked on the monument to General Édouard de Castelnau located in the French Military Cemetery at Courbesseaux\nOther monuments, memorials and cemeteries in Meurthe et Moselle\nThe French cemetery at Saulcy-sur-Meurthe\nThe cemetery was created in 1921 and brought in bodies originally and provisionally buried in graves in the Col du Bonhomme, the Col de la Schlucht, Gérardmer, Mandray, Le Valtin and la Croix-aux-Mines. The cemetery holds the remains of 2,565 French soldiers of whom 1,174 are buried in two ossuaries. It has been claimed that the body of the soldier buried in Paris in the tomb of the unknown soldier came from grave 1405 in the Saulcy-sur-Meurthe cemetery.\nNomeny\nNomeny was occupied by the Germans on 20 August 1914. The village was plundered, burned down and some 55 women, children, and elderly people slaughtered. The Governor of Metz, General von Oven had ordered the destruction of Nomeny as a reprisal for the French attack in front of Morhange. German soldiers had been fired on by so-called \"Francs-tireurs.\" The names of 63 people who were killed are listed on the monument as well as 12 people who were badly injured. Similar events took place in Badonviller, Bréménil, Blâmont and Gerbéviller. Nomeny and nearby Brionne were to see fierce fighting on 20 August 1914 and there is a monument dedicated to the memory of the soldiers of the 59th Reserve and the 277th, 325th and 314th French Infantry who fell fighting to the north of the Grand Couronne and the River Seille and who as stated on the memorial\nIn Brionne there were it seems other more sinister events\nThe war memorial in the Cimetière Sud in Nancy\nThe large cemetery located in the south of Nancy has a memorial dedicated to all those soldiers who fell in the 1914-1918 war.
