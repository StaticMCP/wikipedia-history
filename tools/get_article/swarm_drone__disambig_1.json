Military swarms are capable of surveillance and attack missions.\nIndia\nFollowing a three-year-long competition organised by the Indian Air Force, at least two companies are expected to receive formal contracts for surveillance, attack and electronic warfare drones. The ‘swarm architecture’ award went to NewSpace Research & Technologies, run by former IAF officer Sameer Joshi. NewSpace also won a US$15 million swarm drone order from the Indian Army.\nThe ‘communication architecture’ award went to a Delhi Technology University team incubated Flaire Unmanned Systems in a tie-up with Adani Defence, and the ‘drone architecture’ award went to Dhaksha Unmanned Systems. For designing the swarm drones for the Indian Army, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited is supporting NewSpace Research and Technologies in development of the swarm drones.\nDuring an event in Jhansi in November 2021, DRDO showcased the armed swarm technology with minimal human efforts. The drones are operable at high-altitudes, rough-weather conditions and can fly at a speed of 100&nbsp;km/h and has ability to strike multiple drones at the target.\nFor promoting drone development, the Indian Air Force also launched a three-year long competition in 2018, named, Mehar Baba Swarm Drone Competition that was open for distinct organizations.\nIsrael\nSwarm drones have also been used by the Israel Defense Forces multiple times including against Iranian forces and to find rocket launchers situated in Gaza City (allegedly).\nReferences"
