      "text": "# Danilo culture\n\nDanilo culture () was a Neolithic culture of the Dalmatian coast of Croatia and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, dating to 4700-3900&nbsp;BC.\nThe major archaeological site of the culture is at Danilo polje, near today's Danilo, Croatia. The fertile oval valley between two karst ridges was cultivated for millennia due to its quality soil, whose clayey composition allows water to be retained in the lower layers.\nThe Danilo dig site consists of large numbers of pits and post holes whose associated material has been subdivided typologically into five phases.\nThere are two associated pottery styles, painted in black and broad red bands on buff ware, and incised on dark burnished ware, belong in the Middle Neolithic. The geometric designs suggest connections with contemporary wares in Italy, particularly Ripoli and Serra D'Alto. There was also a long blade and tanged point stone industry closely related to fishing.\nGallery\nFile:Zivotinjski riton.jpg|Ceramic rhyton\nFile:Klececi riton.jpg|Ceramic rhyton\nFile:Danilo1a.jpg|Rhyton\nFile:Danilo 2a.jpg|Ceramic dish\nSee also\n* Impressed Ware\n* Kakanj culture\nReferences\nSources\n*"
