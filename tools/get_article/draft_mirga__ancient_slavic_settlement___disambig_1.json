Some also speak of a spatial extension over Eichelberg to Mockersdorf. Geographically, the high plateau slopes steeply to the south. There, the villages of Zettlitz, Schmierhütte and Seitenthal are located. The terrain is also very steep to the northwest. Access to the north and east was blocked by a marshland characterized by the Haidenaab. This meant that the site was easy to defend. In addition, numerous sources of drinking water such as the Neuhauser Quellen near Zettlitz, the small stream in the so-called Miega-Graben, the Hubbach and the Preißacher Mühlbach ensured the water supply and thus greatly facilitated settlement.\nToday, many names of local geographical features still remind of this, for example a section of forest also bears the name Miega Apart from countless boulders, there are no obvious remains of this settlement to be found.\nHistory\nMir in some slavic languages means “peasant community, communal field, communal assembly, masonry or dry stone wall, but also universe, world and peace, peaceful, at peace”\nMedieval burial sites were discovered in Barbaraberg in 1972 by chance, which were archeologically investigated afterwards from 1992 until 1995. 297 individuals were able to be identified in 161 graves; some of them buried in wooden coffins and others in bodybags. Almost all of the female corpses were given typical jewelery of the slavic culture of the 9th/10th century, such as S-bow rings.The site of the graves of the Carolingian and Ottonian periods are protected under german law\nFindings\nTime and again, small horseshoes and square coins are found \"on the Mirga\" (preposition used by locals).\nMany coins and cuffs from the 20th century, especially from the Nazi era, can also be found by using metal detectors.\nReferences"
