      "text": "# ROH/NJPW War of the Worlds\n\nThe War of the Worlds was a series of professional wrestling events, produced every year since 2014 by professional wrestling promotions Ring of Honor (ROH) and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). The War of the Worlds events are shown on the online streaming services of both promotions, Honor Club and NJPW World.\nHistory\nThe two promotions announced a partnership in February 2014, which led to the first War of the Worlds event taking place at the Hammerstein Ballroom, in New York City, the following May. The event then became a series of events, with two in 2015, three in 2016, and four since 2017. The events have visited numerous cities and metropolitan areas around the U.S. and Canada, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Detroit, Toronto, Boston and Chicago.\nIn 2017, as a one-off, ROH and NJPW partnered with Revolution Pro Wrestling (RPW) and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) to promote a War of the Worlds tour in the United Kingdom, named War of the Worlds UK.\nDates and venues\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!\n!Event\n!Date\n!City\n!Venue\n!Main event\n!Ref\n|-\n|\n|War of the Worlds (2014)\n|May 17, 2014\n|New York City, New York\n|Hammerstein Ballroom\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2|War of the Worlds (2015)\n|May 12, 2015\n|rowspan=2|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|rowspan=2|2300 Arena\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 13, 2015\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=3|War of the Worlds (2016)\n|May 9, 2016\n|Dearborn, Michigan\n|Ford Community & Performing Arts Center\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 11, 2016\n|Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n|Ted Reeve Arena\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 14, 2016\n|New York City, New York\n|Terminal 5\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=4|War of the Worlds (2017)\n|May 7, 2017\n|Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n|Ted Reeve Arena\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 10, 2017\n|Dearborn, Michigan\n|Ford Community & Performing Arts Center\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 12, 2017\n|New York City, New York\n|Hammerstein Ballroom\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 14, 2017\n|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|2300 Arena\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=3|War of the Worlds UK\n|August 18, 2017\n|London, England\n|York Hall\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|August 19, 2017\n|Liverpool, England\n|Liverpool Olympia\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|August 20, 2017\n|Edinburgh, Scotland\n|Edinburgh Corn Exchange\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=4|War of the Worlds Tour\n|May 9, 2018\n|Lowell, Massachusetts\n|Lowell Memorial Auditorium\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 11, 2018\n|Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n|Ted Reeve Arena\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 12, 2018\n|Royal Oak, Michigan\n|Royal Oak Music Theatre\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 13, 2018\n|Villa Park, Illinois\n|Odeum Expo Center\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=4|War of the Worlds (2019)\n|May 8, 2019\n|Buffalo, New York\n|Buffalo RiverWorks\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 9, 2019\n|Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n|Ted Reeve Arena\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 11, 2019\n|Grand Rapids, Michigan\n|The DeltaPlex\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|May 12, 2019\n|Villa Park, Illinois\n|Odeum Expo Center\n|\n|\n|-\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"|}}\n|}\nSee also\n*Global Wars\n*Honor Rising: Japan\n*G1 Special in USA\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.njpw.co.jp/ Official New Japan Pro-Wrestling website]\n*[http://www.rohwrestling.com/ Official Ring of Honor website]"
