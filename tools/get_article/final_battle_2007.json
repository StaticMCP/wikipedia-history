It occurred on December 30, 2007, from the Manhattan Center in New York City.\nIt was the fifth annual event in the Final Battle chronology, with the first in 2002.\nBackground\nFinal Battle featured nine professional wrestling matches involving wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or heroes in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match.\nOne of the show's two main events featured Nigel McGuinness defending the ROH World Championship in a Four Way Fray against Bryan Danielson, Chris Hero and Takeshi Morishima. However, the night before, McGuinness was severely injured in his defense against Austin Aries. During the match, Aries dove from the ring, smashing Nigel's face on the edge of the guard rail, resulting in a concussion, a broken nose and a gash about his eye that needed 15 stitches. As a result, Aries was added to the Four Way Fray, with the winner getting a shot at the ROH World Championship at the Sixth Anniversary Show.\nResults\n|times =\n|hide =\n|note1 = dark\n|match1 = Bobby Dempsey defeated Mitch Franklin\n|stip1 = Singles match\n|match2 = The Vulture Squad (Jigsaw and Ruckus) defeated Bobby Fish and Matt Cross\n|stip2 = Tag team match\n|time2 = 8:01\n|match3 = Larry Sweeney (with Sweet n' Sour Inc.) defeated Claudio Castagnoli\n|stip3 = Singles match\n|time3 = 2:29\n|match4 = Jack Evans (with Julius Smokes) defeated Necro Butcher\n|stip4 = No Disqualification match\n|time4 = 11:15\n|match5 = Naomichi Marufuji defeated Davey Richards\n|stip5 = Singles match\n|time5 = 15:13\n|match6 = The Hangmen 3 (Adam Pearce, B.
