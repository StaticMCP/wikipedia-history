He is absconding and takes refuge in the house of Maheswari. Manickam and Maheswari fall in love. Manickam's father Dharmalingam demands a large dowry from Maheswari's mother, Kanthimathi, who somehow manages to give the amount. However, Dharmalingam learns that Kanthimathi is ridiculed by the villagers as a woman of loose moral character. So, he sends back Maheswari to her home. Manickam is helpless because he depends on his father for everything. Kanthimathi kills herself. Maheswari starts looking for a means to earn a living and she comes across Mayathevan, the leader of a gang of robbers who is wanted by the East India Company. She is employed by him as chief assistant. Mayathevan renames Maheswari as Rani Rangamma. Though she lives like a queen, her heart yearns for Manickam. In the meantime, at the insistence of his father, Manickam has married another woman. What happens to Maheswari forms the rest of the story.\nCast\n* Savitri as Maheswari\n* Gemini Ganesan as Manickam\n* K. A.
