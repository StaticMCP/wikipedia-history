The combined Muscovite–Suzdalian army was led by Moscow Governor Dmitry Mikhailovich Bobrok Volynsky, and Dmitry of Suzdal's sons Vasily and . Volga Bulgaria, which was at the time an  of the Golden Horde (who had converted to Islam in 1313), was ruled by emir Hassan Khan (in Rus' chronicles Assan) and Horde protégé Muhammad Sultan (Sultan Mahmat).\nBackground\nIn 1364, ongoing raids perpetrated by the Mongol-Tatars on Nizhny Novgorod land forced Prince Dmitry Konstantinovich of Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal to ally with and seek assistance from Dmitri Ivanovich of Moscow. Certain outposts for these raids served the Bulgar Ulus.\nCampaign\nDuring the campaign, many villages in Volga Bulgaria were burned and large numbers were slaughtered.\nOn March 16, the Muscovite–Suzdalian army invaded Volga Bulgaria, leading Hasan Khan to mount a defense. The Bulgars rode camels at this time. The city walls were breached by Muscovite–Suzdalian fire-power. However, according to the chronicler, Muscovite–Suzdalian forces were also under heavy assault and faced significant opposition. Once the walls were breached, the Bulgar army forces were quickly defeated. Many Bulgars fled into the city and hid behind the walls. Hasan Khan ordered a 5,000 ruble payment (2,000 to soldiers and 3,000 to princes and magistrates) to end the attack.\nReferences"
