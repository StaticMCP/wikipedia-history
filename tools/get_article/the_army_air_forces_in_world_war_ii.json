      "text": "# The Army Air Forces in World War II\n\nThe Army Air Forces in World War II is a seven-volume work describing the actions of the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC), and from June 1941 the United States Army Air Forces (AAF) that succeeded it, between January 1939 and August 1945. It was published between 1948 and 1958 by the University of Chicago Press under the auspices of the Office of Air Force History.  The series editors were Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate.\nBackground\nIn June 1942, the Chief of the Air Staff directed that an historian be appointed to record the military operations of the USAAC. In July a similar position was created to provide an administrative history. Both efforts were placed in the Historical Division of the Office of the Assistant Chief of Air Staff, Intelligence. The officer in charge, Colonel Clanton W. Williams of the University of Alabama, held a succession of titles which culminated in AAF historian editors Craven and Cate equate his duties to those of a university dean.\nWilliams directed the recruitment and placement of historians in the Air Staff and at unit headquarters worldwide.  The Air Staff and he determined that,\nMost were not professional military men but academics who were already serving in the AAF. Of necessity, their focus during the war was \"selection and collection of materials\" though they were often involved in producing action reports and unit history monographs. The Historical Office determined that the final effort,\nFurthermore, the office decided that the seven-volume format listed below was both necessary and appropriate for a thorough treatment of the subject.\nPost-war\nAfter V-J Day the Historical Office was moved from Intelligence to be a special staff office.  The Historical Office approached Craven and Cate to oversee the history project. Craven, then a Lieutenant Colonel in the AAF, was on leave from the faculty of New York University. Cate, then a Major, had come to the AAF from the University of Chicago. They agreed on the condition that they would be given a free hand in editorial decisions and access to all pertinent materials, a requirement which they state \"has been lived up to in letter and in spirit\". The University of Chicago agreed with similar conditions to sponsor and publish the work.\nThe seven volumes are in effect a collection of essays. Craven and Cate recruited 32 authors to write chapters or whole sections and also wrote several chapters themselves. Most of the authors had served in the AAF during the war and had returned to their college and university faculties after it. A few were professional officers with academic training.  Craven and Cate note that \"they have written as present scholars rather than as former Air Corps officers\".\nThough the series has the appearance of an official history, Craven and Cate emphasize that is \"not an official report in the ordinary sense of that termone to which the Air Staff necessarily subscribes in all its details and final conclusions\".\nContents\nThe seven volumes and their publication dates are:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nA companion volume, Combat Chronology 1941–1945,  was compiled by Kit C.
