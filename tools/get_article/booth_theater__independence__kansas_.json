The redesigned theater was the first in Independence to be designed specifically for use as a movie theater. The Boller Brothers, an architectural firm known for their theater designs, designed the theater in a mixture of the Spanish Renaissance and Italian Renaissance Revival styles. The theater showed films until its closure in 1980.\nThe theater was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/18761 Cinema Treasure: Booth Theater]"
