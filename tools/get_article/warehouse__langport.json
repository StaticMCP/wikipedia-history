It has clay plain tile roofs with hipped ends. It was built by the Parrett Navigation Company, a trading Company owned by Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot, on the banks of the River Parrett. When the river became unnavigable the buildings usefulness waned and was eventually abandoned.\nThe Somerset Trust for Sustainable Development, now the Ecos Trust, purchased the site, designated as a brown field site, in February 2003, and worked with Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust (SBPT), English Heritage and local councils to redevelop it into a craft, heritage learning and small business centre, with the surrounding land being used for an eco-friendly housing development.\nIt is a grade II listed building.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sbpt.info/restoration7.htm The Warehouse, Great Bow Yard, Langport, Frome from Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust]"
