      "text": "# Visa policy of the United Kingdom\n\nThe visa policy of the United Kingdom is the policy by which His Majesty's Government determines visa requirements for visitors to the United Kingdom and those seeking to work, study or reside there. The visa policy of the UK also applies to the Crown dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man, which each operate their own immigration enforcement and have separate work permit systems. The visa policy does not apply to any of the British Overseas Territories, who generally apply their own visa policies.\nAnyone who does not have right of abode in the United Kingdom (British citizens and some Commonwealth citizens, but not some categories of British national) requires leave (permission) to enter the UK. \"Visa nationals\" must always obtain entry clearance by obtaining a visa in advance of travelling to the UK, and \"non-visa nationals\" may travel as a visitor to the UK for up to six months without a visa. Since April 2025, all non-visa nationals must apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA).\nVisas are also required to live, study and work in the UK as a foreign national. Some EU, EEA and Swiss citizens who lived in the UK prior to Brexit are exempt under the EU Settlement Scheme, and long-term foreign residents can apply for indefinite leave to remain, which is approximate to permanent residency in other countries.\nThe UK maintains the Common Travel Area (CTA) with the Republic of Ireland and the Crown Dependencies. This means that most citizens of Ireland are exempt from the requirement to hold a visa, residence permit or travel authorisation to enter, study and work in the UK or the Crown Dependencies, and vice versa. The CTA does not apply to those who are not British or Irish citizens, so other citizens must have the correct permission to enter the UK when crossing the border.\nVisa policy map\nVisa exemption\nThe following persons can enter the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man without a visa:\nAs of right\n{|style=\" border-radius:1em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.5em rgba(0,0,0,0.75); background-color: white; border: 1px solid white; padding: 5px;\"\n|\n*  British nationals:\n** British citizens\n** British subjects with the right of abode in the United Kingdom\n*  Irish citizens}}\n* Holders of a certificate of entitlement\n|}\nBritish nationals without right of abode\nBritish nationals who are not British citizens may visit the United Kingdom for up to 6 months:\n{|style=\" border-radius:1em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.5em rgba(0,0,0,0.75); background-color: white; border: 1px solid white; padding: 5px;\"\n|colspan=2|\n*  British nationals:\n** British Nationals (Overseas)\n** British Overseas Territories citizens\n** British Overseas citizens\n** British protected persons\n** British subjects without the right of abode in the United Kingdom\n|-\n|colspan=2|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:100%;\"|Rules for non-visa nationals\n|-\n|\n* they must not work for UK clients or in the UK jobs market during their stay in the UK (although study is permitted as a 'student visitor'), with limited exceptions for authorised Permitted Paid Engagements, supported by a registered Certificate of Sponsorship, of up to one month.

Those who entered using the now-defunct Iris Recognition Immigration System (2004–2013) also did not receive a stamp.\nUK Border Force officers can grant leave to enter via fax, email, or orally, including by telephone, for non-visa nationals visiting for up to 6 months. This does not apply when leave has been conferred by another Common Travel Area official.\nIn some cases, such as certain general aviation flights, travellers may be 'remotely cleared' without inspection, receiving no passport stamp.\nTravellers arriving directly from the Republic of Ireland are not routinely checked by the UK Border Force. Under the Immigration (Control of Entry through Republic of Ireland) Order 1972, non-visa nationals are automatically granted 'deemed leave' for 6 months, without the right to work, and without receiving a passport stamp.\nSimilarly, travel between the UK and the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man involves no routine immigration checks, and no passport stamp is issued. Leave to enter from these Crown Dependencies applies equally in the UK. Travellers arriving in the Crown Dependencies directly from the Republic of Ireland are similarly exempt from routine checks and automatically receive deemed leave for 6 months, with no right to work.\nSince 2 April 2025, all visitors who do not need a visa have needed an Electronic Travel Authorisation to travel to the UK.\nElectronic travel authorisation (ETA)\nThe UK implemented the Electronic Travel Authorisation system, from November 2023.\nCitizens of the following countries may obtain an ETA valid for travel in the UK for up to 6 months.\n{|style=\" border-radius:1em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.5em rgba(0,0,0,0.75); background-color: white; border: 1px solid white; padding: 5px;\"\n|colspan=3|\n*  European Union member states (except Ireland)}}\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*.

Since 27 November 2024, ETA applications have been opened for non-visa nationalities outside the European Union, who needed an ETA for any travel to the UK on or after 8 January 2025. This requirement was extended to EU nationals later with applications starting from 5 March and an ETA being mandatory from 2 April. There is a £16 fee for applying and an application can take up to three business days to be processed, though most should be approved or denied within a few hours. If approved, the ETA is valid for stays up to six months for a duration of two years or, if shorter, the date of the holder's passport expiring.\nSince 20 May 2019, citizens from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States generally do not receive a stamp, whether using ePassport gates or a staffed desk. However, three categories of these nationals must receive a stamp: those entering for a permitted paid engagement, those with a Tier 5 Certificate of Sponsorship (up to 3 months), or those otherwise required to visit a staffed desk.\nBritish-Irish Visa Scheme (BIVS)\nCitizens of the following countries may travel to the UK without a visa if they hold a valid Irish visa endorsed with BIVS:\n*\n*\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:100%;\"|Rules for Irish visa holders\n|-\n| To be eligible for visa-free travel, applicants for Irish visas must apply at a UK/Irish visa application centre in India or China (including Hong Kong and Macau), and first clear immigration in Ireland before arriving in the UK.\nHolders of BIVS visas issued by Ireland are only allowed to travel directly from Ireland to the UK and not from other countries, unless transiting in the UK on their ways to Ireland. The length of stay in the UK is no longer than the remaining period of validity of the person's current permission to remain in Ireland. A UK transit visa is not required if the person is transiting through the UK to Ireland by air and arrives in Ireland no later than 23:59 on the day after his or her arrival in the UK.\nThe scheme might be expanded for all visa requiring nationals in the future.\n|-\n|}\nUkraine scheme\n*\nCitizens of Ukraine (and their family members of any nationality) who have a family member or sponsor in the UK may apply online for permission to enter and remain in the UK. If approved, they may travel to the UK with such permission letter instead of a visa.\nNon-ordinary passports\nIn addition to all other visa exempt countries, holders of diplomatic, official, service and special passports of the following countries and territories do not require a visa for tourism, business and official purposes for a Indefinite Period Of Stay (unless otherwise stated) under Diplomatic Visa Waiver (DVW) scheme.\nIn 2024, it was announced that Diplomatic Visa Arrangement (DVA) visitor visas will be introduced to replace DVWs. DVAs will be required from the following countries’ specified passport holders by 11 March 2025:\n{|style=\" border-radius:1em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.5em rgba(0,0,0,0.75); background-color: white; border: 1px solid white; padding: 5px;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|\n*D SPA\n*D\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*D O S\n*D\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*D\n*D\n|}\nD -

airside transit and landside transit. The Transit Without Visa facility for visa requiring nationals was abolished, effective 1 December 2014, and replaced with United Kingdom Transit Rules. Notwithstanding the lists below, in general, even persons from 'Direct Airside transit visa-exempt nationalities' require a transit visa if transiting though the UK to other parts of the Common Travel Area including Ireland.\nWith the introduction of the Electronic Travel Authorisation system, everyone, unless exempt from needing an ETA, will need an ETA even if in transit, which includes those not leaving the aircraft and proceeding by the same flight. (see list of countries needing an ETA above)\n;Airside transit\n* Available only at London Heathrow Airport and Manchester Airport\n* Available only to passengers arriving and departing by air to an international destination (non-stop) other than Ireland on the same day.\n* Available only to passengers not leaving the airside zone of the airport and not passing through immigration control.\n* Concerns passengers who would normally require a visitor visa to enter the United Kingdom but who hold a Direct Airside Transit visa, a passport of an airside transit visa-exempt country, or an airside transit visa exemption document, or a direct airside transit ETA.\n;Landside transit\n* Available only to passengers arriving and departing by air by 23:59 the next day who require passing through immigration control and leaving the airport building only for transit purposes.\n* Concerns passengers who would normally require a visitor visa to enter the United Kingdom but who hold a Visitor in Transit visa, landside transit ETA, or a landside visa exemption document.\n;Airside transit visa-exempt citizens\n{|style=\" border-radius:1em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.5em rgba(0,0,0,0.75); background-color: white; border: 1px solid white; padding: 5px; margin-bottom:10px;\"\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n|-\n|colspan=4|\n* Stateless persons holding UN Convention 1954 travel documents and refugees whose original nationality is exempt.\n|}\n;Airside transit visa exemption documents\nThe exemption applies where travellers:\n* arrive and depart by air, and\n* the onward flight must be confirmed, and must depart the same day, and\n* have proper documentation for their destination (including a visa for the destination country if necessary), and\n* fulfil any one of the below conditions:\n# have a valid visa for Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the US, whether or not travelling to or from those countries, or\n# have a valid Australian or New Zealand residence visa; or\n# have a valid Canadian permanent resident card issued on or after 28 June 2002; or\n# have a valid uniform format residence permit issued by an EEA state under Council Regulation (EC) number 1030/2002; or\n# have a valid Irish biometric visa endorsed BC or BC BIVS; or\n# have a valid uniform format category D visa for entry to a state in the European Economic Area (EEA); or\n# have a valid US I-551 permanent resident card issued on or after 21 April 1998; or\n# have an expired I-551 permanent resident card issued on or after 21 April 1998, accompanied by an I-797 extension letter; or\n# have a standalone US Immigration Form 155A/155B attached to an envelope; or\n# have a valid Schengen Approved destination Scheme (ADS) group tourism visa where the holder is travelling to the country that issued it or holds a valid airline ticket from the Schengen area, provided the holder can demonstrate they entered there no more than 30 days previously on the basis of a valid Schengen ADS visa;\nE-visas or e-residence permits are not acceptable for airside transit unless the airline is able to verify it with the issuing country. Nationals of Syria who are holders of US B1/B2 visas are not visa-exempt.\n;Visitor in Transit visa exemption documents\nThe exemption applies where travellers:\n* arrive and depart by air, and\n* the onward flight must be confirmed, and must depart by 23:59 the following day, and\n* have proper documentation for their destination (including the correct visa or exemption document for the destination country ), and\n* fulfil any one of the below conditions:\n# have a valid entry visa for Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the US, and a valid airline ticket for travel via the UK, as part of a reasonable journey to or from one of those countries, or\n# have a valid airline ticket for travel via the UK as part of a reasonable journey from Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the US, if they are transiting the UK no more than 6 months after the date when they last entered Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the US with a valid entry visa for that country; or\n# have a valid Australian or New Zealand residence visa; or\n# have a valid Canadian permanent resident card issued on or after 28 June 2002; or\n# have a valid uniform format residence permit issued by an EEA state under Council Regulation (EC) number 1030/2002; or\n# have a valid Irish biometric visa endorsed BC or BC BIVS and be travelling to Ireland; or\n# be travelling from Ireland and it is less than three months since given permission to stay in Ireland by the Irish immigration official with a valid Irish biometric visa, or\n# have a valid uniform format category D visa for entry to a state in the European Economic Area (EEA); or\n# have a valid US I-551 permanent resident card issued on or after 21 April 1998; or\n# have an expired I-551 permanent resident card issued on or after 21 April 1998, accompanied by an I-797 extension letter; or\n# have a standalone US Immigration Form 155A/155B attached to an envelope;\nE-Visas such as those regularly issued by Australia or e-residence permits are not acceptable for landside transit.\nObtaining an entry visa\nVisitors entering the UK, the Channel Islands and/or the Isle of Man who do not qualify for one of the visa exemptions listed above have to apply for a visa in advance through the UK Visas and Immigration at a visa application centre.\nAll visitors must apply by registering an online account (except citizens of North Korea who must apply in person at the British Embassy), fill in the application form, pay the fee and attend an appointment at a visa application centre.\nA visitor's visa for a single stay or multiple stays of up to 6 months costs £115. A multiple-entry visitor's visa valid for 2 years costs £432, 5 years £771, and 10 years £963. Mainland Chinese citizens can, for certain common forms of travel, obtain a 2-year, multiple-entry visitor's visa at a cost of £115. Being a digital nomad is explicitly allowed on a standard visitor visa as long as the clients or employer are not based in the UK and there is no access to the UK jobs market.\nFamily members of EU, EEA and Swiss citizens who are not covered by one of the visa exemptions above can apply for an EEA Family Permit free of charge (instead of a visa).\nApplicants for most UK visas, including visitor visas and EEA Family Permits, must submit biometric identifiers (fingerprints and a digital facial image). Exemptions from biometrics apply to diplomats, foreign officials, Commonwealth Forces, those transferring a visa vignette to a new passport, and travelers going directly to the Channel Islands or Gibraltar without passing through the UK or Isle of Man. Children must be accompanied when providing biometrics, which may be shared with foreign governments and are destroyed 10 years after capture.\nMost visa applications are decided within 3 weeks.\nApplicants resident in the following countries and territories who wish to enter the UK for 6 months or more are required to be tested for tuberculosis as part of the visa application process:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*'\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*'\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}\nAfter a person has successfully obtained a UK visa, if they subsequently obtain a new passport, but the UK visa in their old passport still has remaining validity, they are not required to have the UK visa vignette affixed in the old passport transferred to the new passport, but must be able to present both the new and old passports at passport control when entering the UK.\nIf a person who has successfully obtained a UK visa subsequently loses the passport in which the visa vignette is affixed (or if it is stolen), they have to pay the original visa fee in full again and may be required to show that their circumstances have not changed when applying for a replacement visa. However, a new 'confirmation of acceptance for studies' (CAS)/'certificate of sponsorship' (COS) is not required when applying for a replacement Tier 4/Tier 2 visa.\nVisa types\nThese are correct .\nVisitor visas\n* Standard Visitor visa\n* Marriage Visitor visa\n* Permitted Paid Engagement visa\n* Parent of a Tier 4 child visa\n* Visa to pass through the UK in transit\n** Direct Airside Transit visa\n** Visitor in Transit visa\nWork visas\n:\n* British National (Overseas) visa\n* Charity Worker visa (Temporary Work)\n* Creative Worker visa (Temporary Work)\n* Exempt vignette\n* Frontier Worker permit\n* Global Talent visa\n* Government Authorised Exchange visa (Temporary Work)\n* Graduate Trainee visa (Global Business Mobility)\n* Graduate visa\n* Health and Care Worker visa\n* High Potential Individual (HPI) visa\n* Innovator Founder visa (formerly Innovator visa)\n* International Agreement visa (Temporary Work)\n* International Sportsperson visa\n* Minister of Religion visa (T2)\n* Overseas Domestic Worker visa\n* Religious Worker visa (Temporary Work)\n* Representative of an Overseas Business visa\n* Scale-up Worker visa\n* Seasonal Worker visa (Temporary Work)\n* Secondment Worker visa (Global Business Mobility)\n* Senior or Specialist Worker visa (Global Business Mobility)\n* Service providers from Switzerland visa\n* Service Supplier visa (Global Business Mobility)\n* Skilled Worker visa\n* UK Ancestry visa\n* UK Expansion Worker visa (Global Business Mobility)\n* Youth Mobility Scheme visa\nClosed for new applications:\n* Entrepreneur visa (Tier 1)\n* Investor visa (Tier 1)\n* Start-up visa\n* Turkish Businessperson visa\n* Turkish Worker visa\nStudent visas\n* Short-term study visa\n* Tier 4 visa\n** General\n** Child\nHistory\nBy early 1917, all aliens (i.e. persons who were not British subjects) were required to obtain visas from a British consul before embarking for the United Kingdom. Visa requirements would then be maintained for aliens under the peacetime regime of immigration control retained after 1918.\nVisas were mutually abolished between the UK and France in July 1921, although this did not apply to French overseas territories or the rest of the British Empire.\nVisa fee reduction between the UK and the United States had been discussed as early as 1925. They were mutually reduced by 80 per cent on 1 April 1937; by February 1938, such fees had already been abolished between the US and most European countries, but American citizens continued being required visas for entry into the UK until 1948.\nPost-World War II\nMembers of the British Empire had been considered British subjects before the war and did not generally need visas; this did not apply to mandated territories such as South West Africa or Western Samoa, whose residents did need visas but were eligible to stay indefinitely. As dominions became more independent and adopted their own nationality laws, however, visa restrictions started to be applied.\nThe abolition of visa requirements was increased in post-war era as part of a policy to make travel freer and easier; by 1949 visa requirements had been abolished in 20 countries.\nAlthough waiving visas or visa charges for United States citizens was discussed as early as 1930, such visas would remain until 1948, when the UK abolished such visas and the US waived visa fees and doubled visa lengths for UK citizens, albeit stopping short at full visa abolition due to domestic considerations; MP Phil Piratin was denied a visa.\nModern history\nIn March 2007, the Home Office announced that it would carry out its first Visa Waiver Test to review the list of countries and territories outside the European Union, European Economic Area and Switzerland whose nationals are exempt from holding a visa for the UK.\nAfter carrying out the review, in July 2008, Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, and David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary, announced to Parliament that the results of the test showed a 'strong case' for introducing visa regimes for 11 countries (Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Lesotho, Malaysia, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela) having taken into account the following factors (including the extent to which they were being addressed by the countries' authorities):\n* Passport security and integrity\n* The degree of co-operation over deportation or removal of the countries' nationals from the UK\n* Levels of illegal working in the UK and other immigration abuse (such as fraudulent asylum claims)\n* Levels of crime and terrorism risk posed to the UK\nFollowing the July 2008 announcement, the UK Government entered into a 6-month period of 'detailed dialogue' with the governments of the 11 countries 'to examine how risks can be reduced in a way that obviates the need for a visa regime to be introduced'. In order to maintain visa-free access to the UK, the 11 countries had to 'demonstrate a genuine commitment to put into effect credible and realistic plans, with clear timetables, to reduce the risks to the UK, and begin real implementation of these plans by the end of the dialogue period'.\nOn 9 January 2009, the new visa rules announced required citizens of Bolivia, Lesotho, South Africa and Swaziland to obtain a visa, and only Venezuelan nationals travelling on biometric passports with an electronic chip issued since 2007 could continue to enter the UK without a visa. The existing visa-free status for citizens of Botswana, Brazil, Malaysia, Mauritius, Namibia and Trinidad and Tobago was maintained.\nStarting from 3 March 2009, a transitional regime was put in place until 30 June 2009 for South African citizens - those who held a valid South African passport and had previously entered the UK lawfully using that passport could continue to enter the UK without a visa, whilst all other South African citizens were required to apply for a visa. On the same day, Taiwan citizens were able to enter the UK without a visa. On 18 May 2009, Bolivian citizens were no longer able to enter the UK without a visa and Venezuelan citizens were required to present a biometric passport to enter the UK without a visa. On 1 July 2009, all South African citizens were required to apply for a visa to enter the UK. On the same day, citizens of Lesotho and Swaziland were required to apply for a visa to enter the UK.\nOn 30 March 2010, Alan Johnson, the Home Secretary, and David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary, announced to Parliament that, having carried out a review of visa regimes in relation to Eastern Caribbean countries, 5 countries (Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis and St Vincent and the Grenadines) would have their visa-free status maintained. At the same time, the UK Government would enter a six-month period of 'detailed dialogue' with the governments of 2 countries (Dominica and St Lucia), who would have to 'demonstrate a genuine commitment to put into effect credible and realistic plans, with clear timetables, to reduce the risks to the UK, and begin implementing these plans by the end of the dialogue period' to maintain their visa-free status. On 2 March 2011, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, announced to Parliament that the governments of Dominica and St Lucia 'have made concrete improvements to the immigration, border control and identity systems which would not have happened without the test', and so the visa-free status for the 2 countries would be maintained.\nOn 13 June 2011, new Immigration Rules were laid before Parliament that came into force on 4 July 2011 introducing a new streamlined application procedure (waiving the normal requirements to provide documentary evidence of maintenance and qualifications at the time of application) for some non-visa nationals from 'low-risk countries' who wish to study in the UK for more than 6 months and apply for Tier 4 entry clearance. The following 15 countries and territories were categorised as 'low-risk' and included in 'Appendix H' of the Immigration Rules: Argentina, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago and the United States. Although the announcement did not relate to a Visa Waiver Test per se, it showed that the UK Border Agency considers some countries and territories in the list of visa-free nationalities to be lower risk than others. In particular, Trinidad and Tobago, which was considered to be a high-risk country from a visa regime perspective in 2008 when the Visa Waiver Test was carried out, was now viewed by the UK Border Agency as a low-risk country. On 5 September 2012, two more countries (Botswana and Malaysia) were added to the list of 'low-risk' nationalities for the purpose of Tier 4 entry clearance applications, i.e. 'Appendix H', (taking effect on 1 October 2012), whilst on 6 September 2013, Barbados was also added to 'Appendix H' (taking effect on 1 October 2013). Again, although the announcement did not relate to a Visa Waiver Test per se, it showed that Botswana, Malaysia and Barbados (countries which were considered to be a high-risk countries from a visa regime perspective when the Visa Waiver Test was carried out in 2008 in the case of Botswana and Malaysia, and in 2010 in the case of Barbados) were now viewed by the UK Border Agency as low-risk countries.\nIn March 2013, it was revealed that Theresa May, the Home Secretary, was considering removing Brazil from the list of visa-exempt nationalities due to concerns about illegal immigration, since Brazil was fifth in the top 10 of illegal immigrant nationalities in the UK according to Home Office figures for 2011, and was the only country on the list for which short-term visitors do not need a visa. However, the UK Government later decided to retain the visa exemption for Brazilian citizens, a decision which was seen as attempting to develop closer trading links with Brazil.\nOn 1 January 2014, an electronic visa waiver (EVW) scheme was introduced, enabling citizens of Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates who have obtained an EVW authorisation online to visit and / or study in the UK for up to 6 months without a visa; with Kuwait added to the EVW scheme during February 2016.\nAfter 'assessing countries against a list of risk and compliance criteria', the UK Government added Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE to 'Appendix H' (the list of 'low-risk' nationalities for the purpose of Tier 4 student visa applications) at various periods between 2014 and 2018 but according to the Cambridge Education Group, Oman was to be removed from this Appendix. However, it doesn't seem like this may have occurred.\nThese 2 changes reflect the UK Government's view that Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE should now be regarded as low-risk countries from a visa regime perspective and it is possible that, in future, nationals of these four countries will be classified as non-visa nationals (enabling them to visit and/or study in the UK without a visa for up to 6 months without having to obtain an EVW authorisation online every time they wish to enter the UK).\nOn 13 March 2014, the UK Government announced that, with effect from 5 May 2014, Venezuelan citizens (including those with biometric passports) would require a visa to enter the UK.\nIn January 2020, British ambassador to Ukraine announced that there would be no visa-free arrangements for Ukrainian citizens.\nOn April 9, 2020, the Home Office issued a new immigration rule imposing visa restriction on low-skilled people workers with effect from January 2021. The restriction introduced a new point-based immigration system, allotting points for certain skills, salaries, qualification and shortage occupations. Any worker with points falling below the given threshold will be restricted from applying for UK work visa, as per the new immigration rule. Free Movement, a UK-based website updating, commenting, training and advising on immigration and asylum laws, claims that nurses, hospital porters, cleaners, postal workers, etc., are to be worst affected by the new immigration law.\nIn February 2021, the UK's new visa scheme stated that Hong Kong residents with a British National (Overseas) passport can stay in the UK for five years and get full citizenship.\nIn May 2022, a new visa scheme was offered to graduates from the world's top 50 universities, giving them a two year long work visa with the opportunity to prolong it if they meet certain requirements.\nFrom 4 August 2022, police registration is no longer required.\nReciprocity\nOf the countries and territories whose citizens are granted a visa-free stay for up to 6 months in the UK:\n* The following fully reciprocate, granting British citizens a visa-free stay for up to 6 months: Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Canada, Grenada, Hong Kong, Macao, Mexico, Monaco, New Zealand, Panama, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, Vatican City.
