The ceremonies were presided over by Carol Burnett, Michael Caine, Charlton Heston, and Rock Hudson.\nThe ceremony was marked by Marlon Brando's boycott of the Oscars, and his sending of Sacheen Littlefeather to explain why he could not show up to collect his Best Actor award for The Godfather; and by Charlie Chaplin's only competitive Oscar win, for Best Original Dramatic Score for his 20-year-old film Limelight, which was eligible because it did not screen in Los Angeles until 1972. Prior to this ceremony, Chaplin had received 2 Academy Honorary Awards: in 1972 for his lifetime of work; and in 1929 (after having revoked his nominations for Best Director, Actor, and Writing (Original), thereby presenting him with a special award celebrating his multifaceted achievements).\nWith eight wins for Cabaret, adapted from the Broadway stage musical by Bob Fosse, the film set a record for most Oscar prizes without winning Best Picture. Best Picture winner The Godfather received three Academy Awards.\nThis year was the first time that two African American women received nominations for Best Actress: Cicely Tyson and Diana Ross. Minnelli accepted her Oscar despite a slight scrape she had incurred while riding a motorcycle. Ross was criticized for running a promotional ad campaign demanding that she win the Best Actress Oscar. Meanwhile, Edward G. Robinson, who died two months before the ceremony, became the second actor to receive his honorary Oscar posthumously, after Douglas Fairbanks (d. 1939) in 1940.\nThis was also the first year when all Oscar winners were brought on stage at the end of the ceremony. The show drew a television audience of  viewers.\nWinners and nominees\nAwards\nNominees were announced on February 12, 1973. Winners are listed first in boldface.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Picture\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Directing\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'The Godfather&nbsp;– Albert S.

This was reduced to 10 nominations (tied with Cabaret'' for the most) after a new vote by the academy's music branch, following a controversy over whether Nino Rota's score for The Godfather was eligible for the nomination it received. For the re-balloting, members of the music branch chose from six films: The Godfather and the five films that had been on the shortlist for best original dramatic score but did not get nominated. John Addison's score for Sleuth won this new vote, and thus replaced Rota's score on the official list of nominees. The controversy arose, according to Academy President Daniel Taradash, because the love theme in The Godfather had previously been used by Rota in Fortunella, an Italian movie from several years earlier. Pacino also did not attend the ceremony; he was allegedly insulted at being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, when he had more screen time than his co-star and Best Actor-winner Brando, and thus should have received the nomination for Best Actor. Pacino denies this, saying in his memoir, Sonny Boy, that he was \"scared\" of his sudden fame and never heard the rumor until much later in his life.\nThe nominations in the category of Best Original Song were not announced in February with the rest of the nominations, reportedly because of \"a mixup in balloting\". It was later reported that the academy had been considering whether Curtis Mayfield's song \"Freddie's Dead\" from the film Super Fly should be eligible. The song was ruled ineligible for a nomination because its lyrics were not sung in the film. (The song was released as a single with lyrics, but the version in the film was an instrumental.) Academy governor John Green was quoted as saying: \"Times have changed. In the old days, Hollywood made 30 or 40 musicals a year, and there were plenty of songs to choose from. Now there are hardly any, and most of the eligible songs are themes. Both the lyric and the music must be heard on the sound track to be eligible.\"\nSacheen Littlefeather's appearance\nholding Marlon Brando's statement at the 45th Academy Awards]]\nSacheen Littlefeather was an American actress, model, and activist of Native American civil rights who Marlon Brando chose to represent him at the ceremony. Littlefeather took the stage and spoke on Brando's behalf as a form of protest, representing Native Americans.\nThe audience in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was divided between applause and jeers. \"I was distressed that people should have booed and whistled and stomped, even though perhaps it was directed at myself,\" Brando later told Dick Cavett. \"They should have at least had the courtesy to listen to her.\" Her appearance prompted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to rule out future proxy acceptance of Academy Awards. (Oscars for winners unable, or unwilling, to accept in person are now accepted in their behalf by the presenters.)\nBoth Sacheen Littlefeather and Marty Pasetta, who directed the Academy Awards telecast, claimed that John Wayne had to be restrained by six security guards to prevent him from assaulting Littlefeather. The story was later refuted as having \"never happened\" by film historian Farran Nehme. She characterised Pasetta's account as \"getting more exciting each time it was told\".\nPresenters and performers\nThe following individuals, listed in order of appearance, presented awards or performed musical numbers.\nNotably, Charlton Heston was late for his role presenting the voting rules, reportedly due to a flat tire. Clint Eastwood, who was slated to present for Best Picture, was asked to fill in. Heston's written dialogue leaned heavily on his role in the movie The Ten Commandments, leading Eastwood to quip, \"Come on, flip the card, man. This isn't my bag.\" Eastwood also famously said on filling in at the last minute, \"...They pick the guy who hasn't said but three lines in 12 movies to substitute for him [Heston]\". Heston arrived part of the way through the bit, allowing Eastwood to escape.\nPresenters\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name !!
