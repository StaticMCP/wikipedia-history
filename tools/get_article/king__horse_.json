Originally named Buttons by his breeder, he was renamed King when he was registered with the AQHA as number 234. He was a bay stallion, bred by Manuel Benavides Volpe of Laredo, Texas, and owned at the time of registration by Jess L. Hankins of Rocksprings, Texas. The AQHA gave his sire as Zantanon by Little Joe by Traveler and his dam as Jabalina by Strait Horse by Yellow Jacket by Little Rondo (Bunton Horse). His second dam was a mare by Traveler, making him linebred to Traveler.\nCareer\nVolpe sold Buttons/King to Charles Alexander of Laredo as a weanling for $150. Later, Byrne James of Encinal, Texas, bought King from Alexander for $325. It was James' wife that changed the horse's name from Buttons to King. James broke King and used him for roping and other ranch work, but when James joined the New York Giants organization to play baseball, King was sold to Win DuBose of Uvalde, Texas, for $550. However, eventually DuBose sold King to Jess Hankins of Rocksprings, Texas, on July 5, 1937, for the sum of $800.\nBreeding record\nKing was the sire of many famous Quarter Horses including Brown King H, Martha King, Royal King, King's Pistol, Gay Widow, Black Gold King, Power Command, Poco Bueno, Continental King, and LH Quarter Moon. Two of his sons were inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame, those being Poco Bueno and Royal King. His daughter Taboo was the dam of Joe Cody, another member of the AQHA Hall of Fame.\nDeath and honors\nKing died on March 24, 1958, of heart failure.\nKing was inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 1989.\nPedigree\nSee also\n* List of historical horses\nNotes\nReferences\n* [http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/king6 All Breed Pedigree Database Pedigree of King] retrieved on June 22, 2007\n* [https://www.aqha.com/hall-of-fame AQHA Hall of Fame] accessed on September 1, 2017\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130619194225/http://www.qhd.com/horse/stallion.asp?id=4514 King at Quarter Horse Directory]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160808083534/http://www.foundationhorses.com/horses/kingped.aspx King at Foundation Horses]\n* [http://www.horsesonly.com/pedpower/legends/king.htm King at Quarter Horse Legends]"
