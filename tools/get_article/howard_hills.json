They were plotted from air photos taken from Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions aircraft in 1956, and named by the Antarctic Names Committee of Australia after W.E. Howard, a member of the crew of the Discovery during the British Australian New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition, 1929–31.\n}}"
