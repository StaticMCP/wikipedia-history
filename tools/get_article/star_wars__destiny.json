Its final, 10th expansion was published in 2020.\nThe game also marked Fantasy Flight Games' return to making collectible card games, deviating from its focus on Living Card Games since 2008.\nMechanics\nUnlike many other card games, Star Wars: Destiny incorporated dice into its play.\nSets\nAwakenings\nReleased on December 4, 2016\nThe premiere set for the game included characters such as Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia Organa.\nSpirit of the Rebellion\nReleased on May 14, 2017\nThe first expansion to the game provided many new options, including making discard, or mill, strategies viable, as well as boosting damage outputs.

In an [https://clips.twitch.tv/LaconicTenuousFiddleheadsRitzMitz August 30, 2019 Reddit AMA], FFG employee Andrew Navarro announced that Covert Missions would be delayed until Q1 of 2020.\nShortly after the announcement that Star Wars: Destiny had been cancelled, FFG announced that Covert Missions would be released January 17, 2020 as the final expansion. However, that never came to pass as FFG preferred to do a worldwide release for the first time ever. Before FFG had a chance to announce their updated release date, Alliance Distributing revealed March 6, 2020 to be the official date, later confirmed by an employee of FFG on Facebook.\nWild Horizons\nAfter the announcement that Star Wars: Destiny was cancelled in January 2020, FFG did announce that a 10th and final set, Wild Horizons, was made and ready to go. However, due to the cancellation of the game, Wild Horizons would not be released in the traditional format. Instead, FFG decided that in summer of 2020, they would release it through an organized play kit under the title of Echoes of Destiny. Essentially, it would allow for players to earn 1 of each card and die for the set as prizes in tournament play.\nDue to COVID-19 and the associated pandemic and worldwide quarantine rules which came shortly after this announcement, Echoes of Destiny never came to pass. In December 2020, FFG ultimately announced that Wild Horizons would never be released in any format, causing much speculation on the existence of this set to begin with, and leading to even more speculation on the truth of FFG's previous words.\nImmediately after this announcement, an anonymous benefactor through various channels released a PDF file with all of the cards for Wild Horizons, albeit in an earlier, playtest version, and not what would be considered the final product. Regardless, fans were able to see the set that would have been, including the new mechanics, and an all new card color, Green, reserved for creatures and beasts within the Star Wars universe.\nOrganized play\nStar Wars: Destiny maintained a dedicated tournament circuit from its inception to its dissolution. Officially sanctioned prizes direct from FFG were a part of the game in every tournament format, from release parties, local store tournaments, and on up through large-scale events.\nKeeping with traditional Fantasy Flight Games tournament structures, Star Wars: Destiny has held World, Continental, National, Regional, and local (store) Championships, with varying levels of prize support and exclusivity. For 2019, many of these were rebranded. Regionals are now Primes, for instance, and Nationals are Grands, allowing for more high-level tournaments in a single nation. Despite changing the names and dates of these types of tournaments, they have all remained a large part of the game, with many valuable prizes available at each.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the world championship, originally scheduled for the beginning of May, was postponed indefinitely. In December 2020, FFG announced there would be no World's for that year, nor any future official organized play events.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+World Champions\n!Year\n!Champion\n!Runner-up\n|-\n|2017\n|Daniel Weiser\n|Nick Obee\n|-\n|2018\n|Edwin Chen\n|Mads Utzon\n|-\n|2019\n|Andrew Rothermel\n|David Broberg\n|}\nCancellation\nStar Wars: Destiny was cancelled by its publisher on 14 January 2020. In December of 2020, FFG announced that they would no longer have anything to do with the game at all.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-destiny/ Star Wars: Destiny Official Page]\n*\n*"
