She first appeared in ''Lloyd's Register in 1798 with J. Burke, master, Callahan, owner, and trade Cork—Martinique. Admiral Kingsmill, Burk, master, was sailing from Jamaica to London when the French privateer  captured her in April 1799.\nCourageaux also captured three other vessels that month: , Mary, and Fanny. Courageaux sent her prizes into Passages; the captains were returned to Poole.
