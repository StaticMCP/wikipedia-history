He was well known for displays of strength and in the greatest feats of strength section of the 2001 edition of Guinness Book of Records, Grant Edwards was picked out for special mention for his feat of single-handedly pulling a 201-ton steam locomotive a distance of 36.8 metres along a railroad track at Thirlmere, NSW, Australia, on 4 April 1996. The 1999 win in Australia's Strongest Man led to an invitation to the prestigious World's Strongest Man in 1999. Drawn in the same group as Magnus Samuelsson, Edwards was directly matched up against the Swede in the log lift, losing 10 lifts to 2. Magnus won the group and Edwards failed to progress to the final. Edwards also pulled the 386 Tall Ship 'Bounty' in Sydney Harbour a distance of 25 metres on 3 April 1996. as well as a 220-ton steam locomotive for charity in Canberra in 1997.

He regularly appeared on Nine's Wide World of Sports, Channel Seven's Sportsworld and ESPN.\nEdwards was also a Highland Games competitor. One of his notable achievements was winning the Scottish heavy throws contest at the 1997 Rosneath and Clynder Highland Games. He totalled 30 points to defeat Robert McKee (US) and Ivo Degelling (Netherlands) who finished second equal with 27 points.\nPrior to competing in strength events Edwards represented Australia in Track and Field in the shot put and hammer throw at Seoul Junior Open South Korea 1982 gaining a bronze medal. He would later be selected in the Australian University Team for Track and Field in 1996 in the same events.

He was also one of the original Australians to secure an American Football scholarship at the University of Hawaii in 1982.\nOutside of his strongman and sporting career, Edwards pursued a career within the Australian police.
