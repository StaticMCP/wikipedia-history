In some constituencies, they have formed an alliance with the Radical Party of the Left.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!Logo\n!Abbr.\n!Ideology\n!Position\n!Leader(s)\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:\"|\n|Republican and Socialist Left\n|\n|GRS\n|Socialism, eco-socialism\n|Centre-left to left-wing\n|Emmanuel MaurelBastien Faudot\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:\"|\n|Citizen and Republican Movement\n|\n|MRC\n|Left-wing Gaullism, souverainism, soft Euroscepticism, dirigisme\n|Left-wing\n|Jean-Luc Laurent\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#510C76\"|\n|'''L'Engagement'''\n|\n|L'E\n|\n|Centre-left to left-wing\n|Arnaud Montebourg\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FEAE53\"|\n|The Radicals of the Left\n|\n|LRDG\n|Radicalism\n|\n|Stéphane Saint-AndréIsabelle Amaglio-Térisse\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#C30706\"|\n|New Socialist Left\n|\n|NGS\n|\n|\n|Liêm Hoang-Ngoc\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#79B241\"|\n|Popular Ecology\n|\n|EP\n|Political ecology\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#BD1945\"|\n|The Socialists\n|\n|LS\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n2022 legislative elections\nThe coalition declared to its foundation that it wants to work on the dynamics of rallying on the left. On 2 May a joint letter is sent to La France insoumise to begin negotiations to integrate the New Ecologic and Social People's Union (NUPES); this request went unanswered.\nOn 20 May the coalition announced that it would present candidates in more than a hundred constituencies for the 2022 French legislative election. They include alliances with the Radical Party of the Left, which internally rejected integration into NUPES, and with dissidents from the Socialist Party. Their representatives present themselves as the candidates of the \"secular and republican\" left between Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Luc Mélenchon.\nElection results\nEuropean Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
