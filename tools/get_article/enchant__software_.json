Enchant wraps a common set of functionality present in a variety of existing products/libraries, and exposes a stable API/ABI for doing so. Where a library doesn't implement some specific functionality, Enchant will emulate it.\nEnchant is capable of having multiple backends loaded at once. As of January 2021 it has support for 7 backends:\n* Hunspell (spell checker used by LibreOffice, Firefox and Google Chrome)\n* [https://nuspell.github.io/ Nuspell] (modern spell checker compatible with Hunspell dictionaries)\n* Aspell (intends to replace Ispell)\n* [http://hspell.ivrix.org.il/ Hspell] (Hebrew)\n* [https://voikko.puimula.org/ Voikko] (Finnish)\n* [https://code.google.com/archive/p/zemberek/ Zemberek] (Turkish)\n* AppleSpell (macOS)\nGNOME LaTeX and gedit rely on the gspell library, which uses Enchant.\nEnchant is currently licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), with an additional permission notice saying that any plugin backend can be loaded and used by Enchant. This ensures that it can use the native spell checkers on various platforms (Mac OS X, Microsoft Office, Amazon Kindle, etc.), and users can use their favorite third-party product to do the job.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://rrthomas.github.io/enchant/ Project homepage]\n* [https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/ PyEnchant] - Python bindings for Enchant"
