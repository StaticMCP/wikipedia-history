The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January&nbsp;30 and evaluated it as a pandemic on March&nbsp;11, 2020. The first case in the United States was reported in Snohomish County, Washington, on January&nbsp;20, and the Trump administration declared a public health emergency on January&nbsp;31, 2020.\nThe initial spread of COVID-19 in Texas may have begun prior to the first contemporaneously confirmed case, very likely as early as September 2019 in Houston. In January, February, and March&nbsp;2020, 1,473&nbsp;more Texans died compared to the January–March average for 2014–2019. While the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) attributed 41 of these deaths to COVID-19, USA Today reported that doctors believed additional COVID-19 deaths may not have been accounted for due to limited testing early in the pandemic. In one specific case, Bastrop County judge Paul Pape reported symptoms starting February&nbsp;9. The infection risk of COVID-19 in Texas was initially expected to be low in mid-January, with risks limited to travelers recently returning from China. KWKT-TV in Waco reported that the virus was \"no cause of concern in Central Texas\" according to local doctors amid the ongoing flu season. On January&nbsp;23, a student at Texas A&M University was isolated and monitored by the Brazos County Health District after returning from Wuhan, China, and presenting with a respiratory illness; at the time, there was only one known case of COVID-19 in the United States. They were the first person in Texas contemporaneously identified as potentially contracting SARS-CoV-2. Medical supply stores in the Brazos Valley experienced medical mask shortages as demand increased in response to the first suspected case. Over the next four days, Texas health officials identified another three suspected cases of COVID-19 meeting testing criteria, including a student at Baylor University; all four tested negative for the virus after samples were delivered to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, leaving no confirmed cases in Texas.\nThe Tarrant County Health Department activated its operations center on January&nbsp;24. Paramedics in the Metroplex increased usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and adjusted their screening procedures for respiratory illnesses. Hospital protocols were updated to isolate patients presenting to emergency rooms with COVID-19 symptoms and with recent travel to Wuhan. While the CDC did not initially designate Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to carry out \"enhanced screening\" of passengers for COVID-19, the airport began coordinating with local hospitals and health departments in late-January. The CDC later implemented COVID-19 screenings at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, and El Paso International Airport, with screenings beginning \"on a rolling basis\" according to Nancy Messonnier of the CDC. These locations were designated as three of twenty CDC Quarantine Stations across the U.S. due to their frequent use as points of arrival for international travelers. The Allied Pilots Association, a labor union representing pilots serving American Airlines, sued American Airlines on January&nbsp;30 through Dallas County to end all flights to China; the airline acquiesced on February&nbsp;4. On February&nbsp;3, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security named Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport as one of 11&nbsp;airports receiving rerouted flights from China. Health workers from the CDC were dispatched to the airport to screen passengers for COVID-19 symptoms. Screenings were also expanded to border crossings between the U.S. and Mexico at El Paso.\nTexas A&M University suspended all undergraduate travel to China on January&nbsp;28 and allowed only essential travel to China for faculty, staff, and graduate students. Baylor University and the University of Texas also temporarily banned university-sponsored travel to China with the exception of essential travel. Two people in the Dallas area were monitored for possible contraction of COVID-19 on January&nbsp;31. Another patient was reported as a possible carrier in Beaumont on February&nbsp;5, and six were being monitored in Austin. Some residents in San Antonio began 14-day self-quarantines. Local health departments, hospitals, and schools in Texas continued to revise their COVID-19 protocols through February. Stocks of N95 masks at clinics in Central Texas were low due to high demand as the pandemic escalated.\nEvacuee quarantines and cases\nAs part of COVID-19 evacuations of American nationals in China, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHS) and U.S. Department of Defense agreed on February&nbsp;1 to house at least 250&nbsp;evacuees for up to a month at Joint Base San Antonio–Lackland (JBSA-Lackland) near San Antonio as one of four reception centers across the country. JBSA–Lackland was chosen due to its large housing capacity, available space, and proximity to medical facilities in San Antonio. The evacuees were flown to U.S. bases on chartered flights operated out by the U.S. Air Force, with the first flight landing in San Antonio on February&nbsp;5. On February&nbsp;13, the CDC confirmed one of the individuals quarantined at JBSA-Lackland contracted COVID-19, representing the 15th confirmed case in the U.S. They were among 91&nbsp;people on a flight arriving at JBSA–Lackland on February&nbsp;7. After an outbreak of COVID-19 impacted the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February, the U.S. State Department arranged for two charter flights to evacuate U.S. nationals to two U.S. locations, including JBSA–Lackland. Fourteen of the evacuees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after being initially asymptomatic, of which seven landed in JBSA–Lackland before being transferred to the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska. On February&nbsp;21, the CDC announced that another two individuals tested positive for the virus among Diamond Princess evacuees quarantined at JBSA–Lackland, bringing the San Antonio and statewide case total to three. By February&nbsp;24, the case total in Texas rose to six, all of whom were quarantined at JBSA–Lackland; a total of 11&nbsp;people at the base were later confirmed as infected, with 9 from the cruise ship and 2 from Wuhan.\nEvacuees quarantining at JBSA–Lackland were sent to the Texas Center for Infectious Disease in San Antonio, with 22&nbsp;beds at the hospital reserved for suspected COVID-19 patients and those presenting with \"mild symptoms.\" By February&nbsp;19, JBSA–Lackland was supporting the quarantines of 234&nbsp;people, with 144 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and 91 from Hubei Province. Nelson Wolff, the Bexar County Judge, criticized the movement of evacuees to hospitals before definitive diagnoses in a letter sent to U.S. Representative Chip Roy. Bexar County Commissioner Tommy Calvert also criticized the decision to move patients out of JBSA–Lackland, stating that the move created \"additional vectors for the virus to spread into the civilian population.\" On February&nbsp;20, the evacuees from Hubei Province at the base were released after showing no symptoms for 14&nbsp;days. Despite two earlier negative tests for the virus, one person had a \"weakly positive\" test after their release from JBSA–Lackland and were moved back to the facility for quarantine on March&nbsp;1 following 12&nbsp;hours out of quarantine. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, San Antonio mayor Ron Nirenberg and U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro criticized the CDC's release of the patient; Castro asked the U.S. House of Representatives to investigate CDC patient treatment protocols, with similar requests from U.S. Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett. The release prompted Nirenberg to declare a public health emergency for San Antonio on March&nbsp;2. A federal judge denied an injunction filed by the city of San Antonio against the CDC \"demanding more rigorous testing\" before releasing asymptomatic individuals at JBSA–Lackland. The CDC modified their quarantine protocol in the aftermath of the incident to require \"two sequential negative tests within 24&nbsp;hours\" prior to releasing quarantined individuals.\nTimeline\nEarly origins\nThe initial origin of community spread in Texas remains unclear, but numerous anecdotal accounts by those later confirmed have included onset dates as early as December 28 in Point Venture, and retrospective analyses have found unexplained statistical increases in deaths during this time. Testing capacity across the state remained extremely limited until after the first recorded cases were announced.\nMarch 2020\nMarch&nbsp;2: Research from Austin Public Health found 68&nbsp;COVID-19 patients in Central Texas began reporting symptoms dating back to this time. San Antonio Mayor Nirenberg issues a public health emergency after an individual positive for the virus is mistakenly released from quarantine at JBSA–Lackland.\nMarch&nbsp;4: The DSHS reports a presumptive positive test result for COVID-19 from a resident of Fort Bend County in the Houston area. A man in his 70s, he is the first known positive case of the disease in Texas outside of those evacuated from Wuhan and the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The patient had recently traveled to Egypt and was hospitalized. DSHS commissioner John Hellerstedt calls the confirmation a \"significant development\" but that \"the immediate risk to most Texans is low.\"\nMarch&nbsp;5: At least eight cumulative cases, including both positive and presumptive positive cases, are identified in the Houston area. The cases involve individuals in the counties of Fort Bend and Harris counties. All individuals with confirmed cases were part of a group that traveled to Egypt in February, including the first confirmed case in Fort Bend County. The travel group rode aboard the Nile River cruise ship MS A’sara. Additional individuals are also investigated as possible carriers in the Houston area in connection with the Egypt trip. The state announces six public health laboratories within its Laboratory Response Network are capable of testing for COVID-19.\nMarch&nbsp;6: Mayor Steve Adler of Austin declares a local disaster and cancels South by Southwest for the first time in its history.\nMarch&nbsp;8: JBSA–Lackland receives around 100&nbsp;evacuees from the cruise ship Grand Princess following a localized outbreak on board.

A resident in his 30s of Frisco in Collin County, a suburb of Dallas, receives a presumptive positive test for the virus after recently traveling to Silicon Valley in California; he is the first case identified in the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area. His wife and 3-year-old child later contracted the disease, with the latter among the youngest confirmed to have the virus in the U.S.\nMarch&nbsp;10: The first two presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 are reported in Dallas County, composed of a 77-year-old frequent traveler and a close contact. Tarrant County also reports its first presumptive positive case, involving a recent traveler to a conference in Kentucky in late February. Abbott and the Texas Department of Insurance request health insurers and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) to waive COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment costs.\nMarch&nbsp;11: Local health officials report a positive test for COVID-19 in Montgomery County; they are identified as the first possible case of community spread—not directly related to travel or known contact with positive travelers—in Texas and in the Houston area. The patient's attendance of a barbecue at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo on February&nbsp;28 is reported as a possible but unconfirmed source of the virus. The city of Houston orders the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo to close after announcing an emergency health declaration. Lakewood Church suspends public services within the church and moves its services online. Montgomery Independent School District in the Houston area and Alvarado Independent School District in the Dallas area become the first two public school districts in Texas to temporarily close classes over COVID-19, affecting approximately 12,400&nbsp;students across 17&nbsp;schools.\nMarch&nbsp;12: After traveling to Barcelona and Paris between March&nbsp;4–10, a 29-year-old-man becomes the first reported case of COVID-19 in Bell County. Five people test positive for the virus in Dallas County, with one without recent travel history; the individual is the first case of community spread in North Texas, prompting a local disaster declaration for Dallas County.\nMarch&nbsp;13: San Antonio reports its first positive case of COVID-19 with an individual not associated with the quarantining evacuees at JBSA–Lackland. Mayor Nirenberg declares a public health emergency and limits gatherings of more than 500&nbsp;people for one week. The first three cases of COVID-19 are also identified in the Austin area. University of Texas President Gregory L. Fenves announces that his wife is among the positive cases following a trip to New York City for a university function with alumni and students. A man in his 40s with recent domestic travel is identified as the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the El Paso area. Abbott declares a state of disaster for all counties in Texas, invoking emergency powers for his administration, and orders state employees to remote work. Day cares, nursing homes, and prisons are asked to limit visitations. The state's first mobile testing center for COVID-19 opens in San Antonio. Colleges and universities throughout the state extend their spring breaks with some transitioning to online instruction, including Baylor University, the University of Houston, the University of North Texas, the University of Texas at Austin, Texas State University, and Texas Tech University. School districts also announce temporary suspensions of classes statewide.\nMarch&nbsp;14: Between March&nbsp;14–19, some students from the University of Texas at Austin take a trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, for spring break; on March&nbsp;27, a student has a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 after returning from Cabo San Lucas. A contact tracing investigation conducted by the COVID-19 Center at the University of Texas Health Austin concludes on April&nbsp;5, with viral tests on 231&nbsp;students. Among the sample, 60 of the 183 travelers to Cabo San Lucas test positive for the virus.

An outbreak begins at the Denton State Supported Living Center in Denton, with the number of positive test results increasing to 55&nbsp;residents and 67&nbsp;employees of facility by May&nbsp;21. The DSHS declares a public health disaster, marking the first such declaration since 1901. DSHS Director Hellerstedt issues the disaster declaration as the disease \"has created an immediate threat, poses a high risk of death to a large number of people and creates a substantial risk of public exposure because of the disease's method of transmission and evidence that there is community spread in Texas.\" Abbott issues four executive orders to ban gatherings of more than 10&nbsp;people; discourage eating and drinking at bars, food courts, restaurants, and visiting gyms (and close bars and restaurant dining rooms); proscribe visitation of nursing homes, retirement centers, and long-term care facilities with exception of providing critical care; and temporarily close all Texas schools.

An executive order issued by Abbott mandates visitors flying to Texas from Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and New Orleans, Louisiana, to self-quarantine for 14&nbsp;days. Modelling from a team of researchers at the University of Texas at Austin was presented to the government of Austin. The model projected epidemiological outcomes of school closures and varying degrees of social distancing compliance out to August&nbsp;17, starting with a basic reproduction number of 2.2, an average incubation period of 7.1&nbsp;days, a doubling time of 4&nbsp;days, and the initial prevalence of COVID-19 in the region. It indicated that healthcare capacity of the Greater Austin metropolitan area would be exceeded if \"extensive social distancing measures\" were not implemented. The simulation estimated 87,501&nbsp;cumulative hospitalizations and 10,908&nbsp;cumulative deaths in the absence of social distancing measures or school closures, compared to 3,254&nbsp;cumulative hospitalizations and 267&nbsp;cumulative deaths with both school closures and 90&nbsp;percent social distance compliance; of the four social distancing scenarios modeled, only the 90&nbsp;percent compliance scenario indicated hospitalizations within capacity through August&nbsp;17.\nMarch&nbsp;27: Three brigades from the Texas National Guard are deployed to assist drive-through COVID-19 testing sites.

The total death toll before July was 2,481.\nSeptember 23: By September 23, college towns in Texas have become new hot spots. Cases rose among students as university administrators struggled with how to keep infections from spreading beyond the university. The spread is believed to be driven by off-campus parties. Texas Tech parties have been posted to social media and are under investigation by university officials. The school has reported over 1,400 COVID cases. Other metrics like daily hospitalizations have been decreasing but some counties report a \"mild uptick\" since students have returned to campus.\nOctober 2020\nOctober 29: Larger hospitals in Lubbock, Amarillo and El Paso did not have space available to accept transfers of seriously ill Covid patients from rural areas.\nNovember 2020\nNovember 10: El Paso had 1,076 hospitalized cases, which occupied half of all patient beds in the city.

A two-week partial lockdown order, set to expire on the 11th, had been met with mayoral opposition and inconsistent enforcement, and had not reduced hospitalizations.\nNovember 21: According to Texas Department of State Health Services the number of new infections began to exceed 12,000 per day. Fatalities have also increased. In spite of common-sense expectations, infection and death rates are already substantially higher in rural counties, and the difference with main metro areas is increasing. For instance, counties Hale, Lamb and Hockey (north and west of Lubbock) recorded together 164 fatalities, which is very close to 163 in Williamson (north part of Austin metro). However, the population in Williamson county is about 590,000, which is much higher than the roughly 72,000 population for those three counties combined (Hale, Lamb, Hockey).\nNovember 25: The number of daily-added new infections for the first time became higher than 15 thousand, after exceeding 14 thousand just yesterday, on November 24.\nNovember 26: Returning to the shown for November 21 comparison between rural and metro areas: according to Texas DSHS in 5 days between November 21 and 26 the mentioned three counties added 18 death cases, while Williamson county added only 2, and this calculates as roughly 50-fold difference in the current death rate per capita.\nJanuary 2021\nJanuary 1: December became the first month with more than six thousand COVID-related fatalities according to accumulated data from the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS).\nJanuary 7: A confirmed case of a new, more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom was reported in Texas. The patient is resident of Harris County with no travel history.\nJanuary 12: As reported by Texas DSHS, the number of COVID-related fatalities exceeded 30 thousand, and is above 1/1000 amount total population. The fatalities (and likely infection spread) continue to be very different between metro and rural areas. While major metro counties, like Harris and Dallas, have fatality around 1/1200, less populated areas show substantially higher death rate. For instance, Lamb county has recently exceeded 0.5% (1/200) fatality rate, and on the date is already well above one fatality per 180 population.\nJanuary 13: For the first time Texas DSHS reported more than 400 new daily fatalities.\nJanuary 23: Texas DSHS states via press release that 332,750 COVID-19 vaccine doses will be distributed to 212 healthcare providers. An additional 216,350 doses have been ordered in advance to provide the public who received the first vaccine, the required second dose.\nJanuary 24: Texas Tribune reports 34,322 COVID-19 related fatalities have occurred in Texas.\nJanuary 25: Texas Department of State Health Services data shows that 265,786 people have been fully vaccinated. The CDC states the 7-day moving average of fatalities is 326.\nJanuary 28: A new highest fatality record, 471, was added by Texas DSHS on the day, after previous highest addition of 467 on January 27. However, with accelerating vaccinations of the most vulnerable populations this may hopefully become the last such \"record.\"\nJanuary 31: In January (in 31 days) Texas DSHS reported 9,054 COVID-19 related fatalities. It is 1.5 times more than the previous highest number recorded just in the previous month, December 2020.\nFebruary 2021\nFebruary 3: Texas DSHS reports 13,181 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and 418 newly reported fatalities. The rates of confirmed cases and hospitalizations has gone down. In January 2021, the state reached over 2 million cases of COVID-19 according to the Texas Tribune.\nFebruary 5: Texas DSHS reported 2,140 COVID-related fatalities during last 7 days. This is lower as compared to 2,281 in the 7 days proceeding this  week (the highest number), and even lower than 2,257 in 7 days earlier. The decline may be a result of vaccination. However, vaccination per capita in Texas is proceeding slower than the average within the USA, and substantially lower than in all four states bordering Texas according tо U.S. CDC.\nFebruary 11–14: A severe winter weather storm brought ice and snow conditions to much of the state creating delays in many people's ability to go out and receive the COVID-19 vaccination. On February 12, Governor Greg Abbott declared the storm a disaster and stated that the freezing temperatures and rain could pose severe threats to property, livestock, and lives.\nFebruary 15: With the intense cold and ice much of Texas lost power critically impacting the health care centers storing vaccines in freezers. Harris county delivered 5,410 doses of the vaccination to organizations they could safely travel to via frozen and icy roads.\nFebruary 16: Texas DSHS reports 2,981 new coronavirus infections. The Texas Tribune states that overall vaccine doses have increased during the last week citing that 4.1% of Texans have now received both doses of the vaccine to become fully vaccinated. The numbers of new cases of coronavirus infection, hospitalizations, and average new deaths credited to the Sars-CoV-2 disease have decreased in Texas. USA Today reports that the 400,000 vials of vaccine Texas was meant to receive this week will be delayed due to poor road conditions until February 17. The weather is causing many vaccination drives across the state in large cities and rural ones to cease operating as it's unsafe for the public to travel.\nMarch 2021\nMarch 1: Texas DSHS reported 6456 covid-related fatalities during a short (28 days) month of February. It is the second highest number, after the previous month, January. Average daily fatalities in February became 231 after 292 in January, this is 21% decrease. However, Texas begins March with a rather small (smaller than the US average) decrease in fatalities.\nMarch 11: Total number of covid-related fatalities, as reported by Texas DSHS, became higher than 45 thousand. The fatalities rate displays a clear lowering, as the last 5 thousand were added in 27 days, while previous 5 thousand were accumulated in 16 days.\nMarch 17: With a potential \"spring wave\" of infection approaching, vaccination continues In Texas. Texas is still somewhat below average USA vaccination rate, and according to US CDC per 100 of population Texas administered 30.5 dosed as compare to 34.2 in the USA.\nMarch 24: While a decrease of covid-related fatalities is becoming obvious as compare to numbers from January, Texas is displaying a somewhat worse results in comparison with the average progress in the USA. Thus, according to US CDC, in the last two weeks Texas recorded 1861 fatalities, which from US total of 14121 will represent 13.1%, and this is substantially higher than the Texas fraction in US population. The main reason is likely the rate of vaccination being slower than US average, resulting in additional deaths of 500 Texans in the last two weeks.\nAugust 2021\nAugust 10: Due to low vaccination prevalence in some Texas population, the coronavirus infections and related deaths are quickly increasing again. According to data from Texas Department of State Health Services (see COVID-19 pandemic in Texas) the registered number of weekly covid-related deaths became near 400 for the last week (after being near 150 just a month ago). This death rate corresponds to infection rates at already increased level 2-3 weeks ago, because the death cases are increasing with a delay as compare to infection rates. During the last week the infection rate increases by about a factor of three from that level. Thus, in 2-3 weeks the weekly death rate will pass 1000 or even approach 1500.\nAugust 11: For the first time after April 2, Texas DSHS again reported more than 100 covid-related daily fatalities in the state\nAugust 25: According to Texas DPHS usual daily number of covid-related fatalities per weekday began to exceed 200, and continues to grow. Weekly fatalities exceeded 1000, for first time after the first half of Match. The fatalities growth indicates that the level of 2000 per week is achievable in two or three weeks. Most likely Texas will come to the first place in the number of covid-related fatalities amount all states, as it continues to be the highest in the current daily fatalities and has the lowest vaccination prevalence among large states.\nSeptember 2021\nSeptember 1: Texas DSHS reported 320 covid-related fatalities, more than in any day in the previous 6 months, and the number accumulated in the last 7 days has arrived to 1500.\nSeptember 15: Texas DSHS reported more than 2000 covid-related fatalities during last 7 days. A level of unreported fatalities is likely increasing in many areas.\nReferences"
