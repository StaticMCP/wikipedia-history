      "text": "# Thornel Schwartz\n\nThornel Schwartz Jr., or Thornal Schwartz Jr. (May 29, 1927 in Philadelphia – December 30, 1977 in Philadelphia) was an American jazz guitarist. He played electric guitar on the recordings of many Philadelphia jazz musicians, especially electronic organ players.\nSchwartz is known as Thornel on recording titles and in standard jazz reference works, but Gary W. Kennedy of The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz notes that Schwartz spelled his own and his father's name \"Thornal\" on his social security application. Schwartz attended the Landis Institute for piano, but became known as a jazz guitarist starting in the 1950s. He was Freddie Cole's guitarist early in the decade, then worked with Jimmy Smith and Johnny Hammond Smith later in the decade. In the 1960s he recorded with Larry Young (musician), Jimmy Forrest, Charles Earland, Byrdie Green, Sylvia Syms and extensively with Jimmy McGriff, and in the 1970s with Groove Holmes.\nDiscography\nAs leader\n* Soul Cookin (Argo, 1962) -with Bill Leslie\nAs sideman\nWith Jimmy McGriff'\n* Christmastime (Jell, 1965)\n* ''Where the Action's At!
