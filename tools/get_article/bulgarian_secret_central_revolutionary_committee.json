The original purpose of the committee was to gain autonomy for  the region of Macedonia  (Western Rumelia), but in perspective, the formation of a Balkan federation. According to Ivan Andonov, the committee was established to resolve the Macedonian Question by the initiative of the revolutionary Spiro Kostov, who inspired both, Andonov and Zahari Stoyanov toward  revolutionary activity for the liberation of the Macedonian Bulgarians. However, BSCRC played an important role in the organization of the  Unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia.\nSee also\n* Secret society\nReferences"
