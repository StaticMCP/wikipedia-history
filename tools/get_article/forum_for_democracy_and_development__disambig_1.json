In the 2001 general elections it nominated Christon Tembo as its presidential candidate; Tembo finished third in a field of eleven candidates with 13% of the vote. In the National Assembly elections the party received 16% of the vote, winning 12 seats. Three FDD politicians were later invited by President Levy Mwanawasa to serve in a 'unity cabinet', and they were expelled from the party for accepting the invitation.\nIn 2005 the FDD chose Edith Nawakwi, a former MMD minister, as its president. However, in 2006 the government de-registered the FDD on the grounds that it had failed to submit an annual report. The FDD subsequently joined the United Democratic Alliance, which put forward United Party for National Development leader Hakainde Hichilema as its presidential candidate for the 2006 general elections. Hilchema finished third with 25% of the vote, whilst the UDA won 24 seats in the National Assembly, down from the combined 74 the alliance's member parties had won in 2001.\nThe FDD did not nominate a candidate for the 2008 presidential by-election, but put forward Nawakwi for the 2011 general elections. She received 0.2% of the vote, finishing seventh out of the nine candidates. The party won a single seat in the National Assembly, Chifumu Banda in Chasefu. Nawakwi ran for the presidency again in the 2015 presidential by-election, finishing third with 0.9% of the vote.\nFrom 2016 to 2021, the FDD held one seat in the National Assembly, in Chiengi. The party did not win any seats in the 2021 general election.\nIn January 2025, the FDD decided to join the Tonse Alliance, an alliance of political parties.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Party candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Result\n|-\n|2001\n|Christon Tembo\n|228,861\n|13.17%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2006\n|Supported Hakainde Hichilema (UDA)\n|693,772\n|25.32%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2011\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Edith Nawakwi\n|6,833\n|0.24%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2015\n|15,321\n|0.92%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2016\n|24,149\n|0.65%\n|Lost\n|}\nNational Assembly elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Party leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Outcome\n|-\n|2001\n|Christon Tembo\n|272,817\n|15.58%\n|\n| 12\n| 3rd\n|\n|-\n|2006\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Edith Nawakwi\n|610,608\n|22.51%\n|\n| 14\n| 3rd\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|20,243\n|0.75%\n|\n| 25\n| 5th\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|79,489\n|2.17%\n|\n|\n| 4th\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|4,006\n|0.08%\n|\n| 1\n| 8th\n|\n|}\nReferences"
