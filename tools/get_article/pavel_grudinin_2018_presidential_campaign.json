The main reasons for criticism is that Grudinin is a businessman, that he is representative of the \"bourgeois class\" which Communism is ideologically opposed to, and that Pavel Grudinin previously was a member of United Russia.\nGrudinin faced overwhelming criticism from the Russian state media as his campaign was proving to be more successful than other challengers to the sitting President, as indicated by an Electoral Preference Poll, conducted by VCIOM Research Center three weeks before the results of the election, where Grudinin was placed firmly as a distant runner-up to Putin. Primarily, the media focused on his foreign monetary assets not being disclosed to the public, which, given his already established reputation as a wealthy businessman, hinted at the fraudulent nature of his Communist beliefs and ideology. Some segments directly accused him of lying and trying to hide his assets from the nation. Research undertaken by the Communist Party indicated that 80% of all TV coverage of Grudinin was negative.\nCommenting on the nomination of Pavel Grudinin, the leader of the party of Communists of Russia, Maxim Suraykin, who also intends to participate in the elections, said:\nSergey Mironov, leader of the social democratic party A Just Russia (which did not nominate any candidate for election, but supported Vladimir Putin) also criticized the nomination of Grudinin:\nForeign Bank accounts\nThe reason for the criticism of Pavel Grudinin was the existence of his foreign accounts which he has not specified when submitting documents to the CEC for participation in election. Namely, 5 accounts in an Austrian Bank, one of which was 14,390,000 rubles, and securities for a total value of 7.5 billion rubles. However, when applying for registration as a candidate, he pointed out that these accounts have already been closed.\nHowever, this caused criticism Grudinina. So, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, commenting on the reports said the Communists finally turned in the direction of capitalism, as nominee on presidential election candidate–billionaire.\nChairman of the Board of deputies of Leninsky District of Moscow Oblast Valery Ventsal sent a letter to Prosecutor General Yury Chaika, asking to check the availability of the foreign accounts of the candidate in presidents of the Russian Federation Pavel Grudinin, when he ran for Moscow Oblast Duma and the District Council of Deputies. Ventsal asks \"to undertake a review in relation to Mr. P.Grudinin the fact that he had accounts in foreign banks at the time of the election campaigns in the Moscow Oblast Duma in 2016, and in 2017, to representative bodies of local self-government of urban and rural settlements of the Leninsky municipal district\". He also requests to check on the fact of provision by Grudinin to the tax office information about the presence of his accounts and other assets in foreign banks, and in the case of any, verification of payment of the accounts of taxes in the budget of Russia.\nThe Communist party explained that Grudinin in foreign accounts opened in the period from January to December 2017 for the treatment of relatives, was 37 million roubles, not 7.5 billion, as previously reported by some media.\nOn 2 February, CEC reported that Pavel Grudinin has 4 outstanding accounts with foreign banks, which were not informed by the Federal Tax Service: 2 accounts in Austria and 2 in Switzerland. Because of what Grudinin was summoned to the Central Election Commission. At the same time, according to the Deputy Chairman of the CEC Nikolay Bulaev, these are problems that are not unsolvable, and Pavel Grudinin said that he has no problems with Bank accounts.\nOn 12 February, Nikolay Bulaev said that the still not resolved issues with the 2 accounts in Swiss banks. Accordin to article 37 of the Federal Law on Elections of the President of the Russian Federation, stating that \"candidates must submit a written notice to that do not have accounts, store cash funds and valuables in foreign banks located outside the Russian Federation, does not possess or use foreign financial instruments\". According to Nikolai Bulaev, Pavel Grudinin on 8 January 2018, presented such a document to the CEC, as well as another document, which was written on 4 February. But due to the fact that there are contradictions between the documents submitted by Pavel Grudinin and the information provided by the Federal tax service, the CEC may re-apply to the Federal Tax Service on issues related to Pavel Grudinin's accounts. At the same time, the Chairman of the Central election Commission Ella Pamfilova called on Pavel Grudinin to independently provide the CEC with information on the closure of all its foreign accounts.  According to her, this issue is \"extremely unpleasant\", as Pavel Grudinin's opponents in this regard demand to cancel the decision on its registration and to withdraw his candidacy from election, and Grudinin's supporters accuse the CEC of excessive severity to him.\nOn 5 March, it became known that at the request of the Russian Federal Tax Service, the Swiss authorities reported 11 more Grudinin accounts in Swiss banks, one of which was opened in the form of precious metals, namely gold. After the appearance of information about these accounts, the CEC announced the holding of a special meeting on March 7, to address the issue of the revealed facts of false information filed by Grudinin during the registration of the candidate. Initially it was assumed that it was to withdraw from the election. However, at the meeting the CEC decided not to remove Grudinin, but at the same time, to add information about established facts of unreliability of data on accounts on the special information poster devoted to the candidate. Each candidate has such posters, they should be hung at polling stations on the election day, they contain information about the candidate, including information about the money.\nReal estate in Spain\nOn 2 February, appeared in the media information about the acquisition of family Pavel Grudinina home in Spain. According to media reports, the property was purchased in the fall of 2017, it is located in the city of Salou, on the Mediterranean coast, the total area of the property is more than 200 square meters, and the cost is €781,614.\nThe head a press-services of Communist party Alexander Yushchenko, commenting on these posts said that neither Pavel Grudinin, nor his spouse or his minor children do not own any house in Spain. However, later, Grudinin admitted that the property in Spain belongs to his children. Commenting on this, he said, \"\"every presidential candidate has children, everyone has some property. You think I'm gonna be in charge of my kids, what to do, who to marry? They are adults, they do business, they have a good income, but I have nothing to do.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011045/http://grudininkprf.ru/ Pavel Grudinin presidential campaign website]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/kprfnews Pavel Grudinin presidential campaign Facebook]\n*[https://twitter.com/Grudininkprf Pavel Grudinin presidential campaign Twitter]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/user/CommunistPartyRF Pavel Grudinin presidential campaign YouTube]"
