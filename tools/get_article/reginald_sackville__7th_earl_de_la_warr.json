He was the brother of George West, Viscount Cantelupe, Charles Sackville-West, 6th Earl De La Warr, Elizabeth Russell, Duchess of Bedford, Mortimer Sackville-West, 1st Baron Sackville, and Lionel Sackville-West, 2nd Baron Sackville. Born Reginald West, he assumed in 1843 by Royal licence the additional surname of Sackville, and (by royal licence) on 24 April 1871 the surname of Sackville only.\nPublic life\nSackville succeeded his mother as Baron Buckhurst in 1870 according to a special remainder in the letters patent (the intention was that the barony of Buckhurst should always be separate from the earldom of De La Warr). Three years later he succeeded in the earldom after his elder brother Charles died by suicide. His younger brother Mortimer then claimed the barony of Buckhurst. However, Mortimer's claim was rejected by the House of Lords. Lord De La Warr was an active member of the House of Lords.\nFamily\nLord De La Warr married Constance Mary Elizabeth Baillie-Cochrane, daughter of Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington, in 1867. They had several children, including Lady Edeline Sackville, wife of Lord Strickland. Lord De La Warr died in January 1896, aged 78, and was succeeded in the earldom by his only surviving son, Gilbert. The Countess De la Warr married as her second husband Reverend Paul Williams Wyatt in 1902. She died in July 1929, aged 83.\nLord De La Warr, alongside his successor the 8th Earl, played a significant role in the development of Bexhill-on-Sea, contributing to its transformation from a small rural village into a growing seaside resort.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
