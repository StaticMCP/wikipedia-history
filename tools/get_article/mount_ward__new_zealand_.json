Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains west to the Landsborough River, and east to the Hopkins River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises  above Thomson Stream in two kilometres, and  above the Hopkins Valley in four kilometres. The nearest higher peak is Mount McKerrow, 12 kilometres to the northeast.\nClimbing\nThe first ascent of the summit was made in January 1934 by Selwyn Grave, E.A. Hogg, and Edgar Williams.\nClimbing routes with the first ascents:\n* East Ridge – Selwyn Grave, E.A. Hogg, Edgar Williams – (1934)\n* South Face – Jim Dawson, Christopher Johnson, Scott Russell – (1934)\n* North Face (descent) – Jim Dawson, Christopher Johnson, Scott Russell – (1934)\n* North West Chimney – Norman Hardie, Jim McFarlane – (1948)\n* South East Face – Rob Blackburne, Ross Cullen – (1981)\n* West Buttress – Stu Allan, Kevin Boekholt, Don Bogie, Kim Logan, Dave Walsh – (1985)\n* Great Dane – Kynan Bazely, Paul Hersey – (2004)\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Ward is located in a marine west coast (Cfb) climate zone, with a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) at the summit. Prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountains, where the air is forced upward by the mountains (orographic lift), causing moisture to fall in the form of rain or snow. This climate supports the Ward, Foster, Elcho, and Baker glaciers on the slopes of the peak. The months of December through February offer the most favourable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.\nGallery\nSee also\n* List of mountains of New Zealand by height\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Mount Ward: [https://peakvisor.com/peak/mount-ward-sslropjg.html weather]\n* Mount Ward: [https://climbnz.org.nz/nz/si/ohau-landsborough/main-divide/mt-ward New Zealand Alpine Club]"
