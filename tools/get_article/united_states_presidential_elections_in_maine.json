      "text": "# United States presidential elections in Maine\n\nFollowing is a table of United States presidential elections in Maine, ordered by year. Since its admission to statehood in 1820, Maine has participated in every U.S. presidential election. Prior to 1820, much of the territory currently comprising the state of Maine was part of the state of Massachusetts, and citizens residing in that area have thus been able to participate in every U.S. election.\nSince 1972, Maine awards two electoral votes based on the statewide vote, and one vote for each of the two congressional districts. However, it is rare that this results in a split vote. It has done so three times, in 2016, 2020, and 2024. The only other state to allow for split electoral college votes is Nebraska.\nWinners of the state are in bold. The shading refers to the state winner, and not the national winner.\nElections from 1864 to present\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1st congressional district\n|-\n|\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 2nd congressional district\n|-\n|\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

The result of the election, with the victory of an opponent of slavery, was considered a threat by southern states seeking to use the federal government to enforce their pro-slavery laws in northern states among other factors. Soon after this election, eleven states seceded and the American Civil War began.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become president, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!
