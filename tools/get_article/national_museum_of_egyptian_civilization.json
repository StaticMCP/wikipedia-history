The museum displays a collection of 50,000 artifacts, presenting the Egyptian civilization from prehistoric times to the Modern era.\nBackground\nThe permanent collection is divided into two separate regions; one chronological and the other is thematic. The chronological areas are the following: Archaic, Pharaonic, Greco-Roman, Coptic, Medieval, Islamic, modern and contemporary. The thematic areas are the following: Dawn of Civilization, The Nile, Writing, State and Society, Material Culture, Beliefs and Thinking and the Gallery of Royal Mummies. UNESCO provided technical help to the museum.\nThe collections will be taken from other Egyptian museums such as the Egyptian Museum, the Coptic Museum, the Museum of Islamic Art, the Manial Palace and Museum in Cairo, and the Royal Jewelry Museum in Alexandria.\nMuseum halls\nMain gallery\nThe main gallery helps visitors obtain an integrated idea of the Egyptian civilization and its most important achievements from prehistoric times to the modern era, in addition to the traditional culture that modern Egyptians have inherited. This gallery includes Nazlet Khater Skeleton, the Tent of Purification, the coffin of Sennedjem, the Nilos Statue, Minbar Aboubakr Ibn Mizhar, and the Al Falaha Statue, among other pieces.\nMummies Hall\nThe Royal Mummies’ Hall is designed to display the mummies of the ancient monarchs of Egypt. The design aims to give the visitor the feeling of strolling down the Valley of the Kings, where most of these mummies were originally resting. The hall includes 20 royal mummies, 18 kings, and 2 queens, from the 17th to the 20th dynasties.\nList of mummies from 17th and 18th dynasties:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Dynasty\n!Role/Notable Facts\n|-\n|Seqenenre Tao\n|17th Dynasty\n|Known for resisting the Hyksos.\n|-\n|Ahmose-Nefertari\n|18th Dynasty\n|Founder of the 18th Dynasty, wife of Ahmose I.\n|-\n|Amenhotep I\n|18th Dynasty\n|Son of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari, second ruler.\n|-\n|Meritamun\n|18th Dynasty\n|Possible sister-wife of Amenhotep I.\n|-\n|Thutmose I\n|18th Dynasty\n|Expanded Egypt’s borders significantly.\n|-\n|Thutmose II\n|18th Dynasty\n|Son of Thutmose I, husband of Hatshepsut.\n|-\n|Hatshepsut\n|18th Dynasty\n|Famous female pharaoh who assumed the throne.\n|-\n|Thutmose III\n|18th Dynasty\n|Renowned as Egypt’s greatest conqueror.\n|-\n|Amenhotep II\n|18th Dynasty\n|Son of Thutmose III, known for military campaigns.\n|-\n|Thutmose IV\n|18th Dynasty\n|Known for the Dream Stele at the Great Sphinx.\n|-\n|Amenhotep III\n|18th Dynasty\n|Brought Egypt to its peak of artistic and cultural power.\n|-\n|Queen Tiye\n|18th Dynasty\n|Great royal wife of Amenhotep III, influential in court.\n|}\nList of mummies from 19th and 20th dynasties:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Dynasty\n!Role/Notable Facts\n|-\n|Seti I\n|19th Dynasty\n|Known for restoring Egypt’s glory after unrest.\n|-\n|Ramesses II\n|19th Dynasty\n|Known as “Ramesses the Great,” ruled for over 60 years.\n|-\n|Merenptah\n|19th Dynasty\n|Son of Ramesses II, fought the Sea Peoples.\n|-\n|Seti II\n|19th Dynasty\n|Faced internal conflicts during his reign.\n|-\n|Siptah\n|19th Dynasty\n|Young pharaoh, possibly ruled under regency.\n|-\n|Ramesses III\n|20th Dynasty\n|Defended Egypt from invasions by the Sea Peoples.\n|-\n|Ramesses IV\n|20th Dynasty\n|Continued temple constructions but faced economic issues.\n|-\n|Ramesses V\n|20th Dynasty\n|Short reign, known from the Wilbour Papyrus.\n|-\n|Ramesses VI\n|20th Dynasty\n|Faced challenges in maintaining Egypt’s stability.\n|-\n|Ramesses IX\n|20th Dynasty\n|Last significant ruler of the 20th Dynasty.\n|}\nTextile Hall\nThe Egyptian Textile Gallery contains a collection that comprises approximately 600 artifacts.\nDye House\nThis ancient dye house dates back to at least the first century of the Fatimid period.
