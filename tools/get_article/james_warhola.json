From 1977 to 1980 he studied at the Art Students League of New York with Jack Faragasso, then privately with Michael Aviano.\nCareer\nWarhola briefly worked for his uncle Andy Warhol at Interview magazine but left that job to become a science fiction illustrator, at which his uncle expressed his disgust in his diary.\nAs a science fiction illustrator in the early 1980s, Warhola did cover art for more than 300 books. Warhola is also one of Mad's \"Usual Gang of Idiots,\" illustrating articles and covers for Mad.\nWarhola has been a fantasy gamer and has done cover art for role-playing games and magazines like Different Worlds.\n''Uncle Andy's: A Faabbbulous Visit with Andy Warhol (Putnam, 2003)\nHe wrote and illustrated Uncle Andy's: A Faabbbulous Visit with Andy Warhol (Putnam, 2003) about his uncle. The book garnered much attention with a feature article in The New York Times and interviews on television and NPR. The publisher offered this description:\n}}\nHorn Book commented, \"In his debut as a writer, James Warhola uses a conversational style and childlike precision to describe one particular visit in 1962, when Warhol had recently made the transition from illustrator to fine artist. The watercolor illustrations are full of details.\" Uncle Andy's was also reviewed by Marianne Saccardi in School Library Journal:\nIn 2009 a spin-off book titled Uncle Andy's Cats'' was published. This told the story of how Andy Warhol's two cats had twenty five kittens and how he resolved the situation when he realized he had too many cats.\nWarhola has worked for several major publishing houses, among them Warner Books and Prentice Hall. He serves as a consultant to the Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art in Medzilaborce, Slovakia, near the Warhola ancestral village of Miková.\nPersonal life\nWarhola, his wife Mary Carroll, and their daughter, Oonagh Warhola, live in Tivoli, New York.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://madcoversite.com/ugoi-james_warhola.html Complete list of Warhola's work for Mad]\n*[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1269357 NPR: James Warhola (May 20, 2003)]\n*\n* [http://radio.cz/en/section/special/warhol-kept-home-and-work-worlds-separate-and-wouldnt-speak-carpathian-outside-family-recalls-nephew-james-warhola Interview with Radio Prague on 1-1-2015]"
