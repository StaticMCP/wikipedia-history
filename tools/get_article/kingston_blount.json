The village is a spring line settlement at the foot of the Chiltern Hills escarpment. The ancient pre-Roman Ridgeway and Icknield Way pass through the parish. The Ridgeway is now a National Trail.\nHistory\nThe Church of England parish church of Saint John was designed by Aston Webb and built in 1877. It is red brick, has the nave and chancel under a single roof and a small south aisle. The building is now a redundant church.  Cop Court is an early 18th-century house built around the remains of an earlier, probably 16th-century one. On the south side is a medieval bastion from an even earlier building on the site.\nEconomy and amenities\nThe village had one public house, The Cherry Tree.  There is a large playing field where the village's main events are held. Kingston Blount has a Point-to-point course.  Kingston Crossing Halt railway station served the village with connections to Princes Risborough until its closure.\nC.J.
