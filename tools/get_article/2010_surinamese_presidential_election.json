If the National Assembly of Suriname twice failed to elect a new president with a two-thirds majority, the election would go to the People's Assembly of Suriname, composed of members of parliament, district and provincial councils, where a simple majority would have sufficed.\nA first vote was expected on 8 July 2010, but only procedural issues were discussed at the meeting; the election was set for 19 July 2010 on the following day.\nShortly before the election, former dictator Dési Bouterse succeeded in establishing a coalition with the A Combinatie and the People's Alliance, giving him the votes required for the presidential election. As expected, he gained 36 votes against Chan Santokhi's 13 votes; he was sworn in on 12 August 2010.\nReferences"
