Located almost entirely in Kent County, it is part of the Dover, Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,961 at the 2020 census.\nHistory\nWhen the Delaware Railroad built its line south from Bear, Delaware and through Kent County in 1855, there was a fight over where to run it in relation to Smyrna. Some wanted the rail line to run on the east side of town and others on the west. Farmers located about 1.5 miles to the west of Smyrna were able to entice the Delaware to build there and the stop became known as \"Smyrna Station\".\nIn 1861 the state at first planned to, but then later decided not to, change the name of Smyrna Station to Clayton in honor of John M. Clayton who was a supporter of the railroad. Despite the failure to change the name by law, people began to call it Clayton, Delaware.\nIn 1867, when the railroad connection between Smyrna Station and Smyrna was built, the state changed the name of the town to Smyrna Junction. The name never caught on, and the town's newspaper was named the Clayton Herald in the same year.\nIn 1874 the Kent County Rail Road built an extension of their line from Massey's Crossroads to Clayton, tunning the town into both a north-south rail stop and an east-west one.\nThe town was incorporated as Clayton on April 15, 1887.\nByrd's AME Church, the Clayton Railroad Station, Enoch Jones House, and St. Joseph's Industrial School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGeography\nClayton is located at  (39.2906671, –75.6343727).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.
