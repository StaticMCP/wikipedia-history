The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Albums chart and No. 32 on the Billboard Top R&B Albums chart.\nPersonal was executively produced by Carl Griffin along with Dave Grusin. Artists such as Lenny Castro and George Duke appear on the album.\nCritical reception\n}}\nJohnathan Widran of AllMusic, in a 3 out of 5 star review, said \"After eight albums, the late soprano saxophonist George Howard found a comfortable and solid if slightly predictable niche in the intensifying realm of instrumental R&B. On Love & Understanding, his first original GRP outing (after a re-release of 1985's Dancing in the Sun), he sticks to the basic funk and romance formulas which made him one of the most consistent suppliers of sweet and nasty improvisational soul over the previous half decade.\"\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
