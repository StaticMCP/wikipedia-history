His father was an alderman and served as mayor of Southampton in 1601-2. Between 1603 and 1614 Major served terms as constable, steward, bailiff and sheriff of Southampton, before becoming an alderman in 1615. He served as mayor in 1615-16. In 1622 he purchased the manor of Allington close to Southampton for £900;.\nIn 1628 he was chosen to serve in parliament alongside his business partner George Gallop. He died 21 February 1629, shortly before the session was terminated. By his will he left £200 for the founding of an almshouse in Southampton.\nBy 1599 Major had married Anne (d.1646), daughter of John Searle of Cossam, Carisbrooke, I.o.W., a yeoman. Her brother John Searle (1569-1622) sat for Newport, I.o.W in 1614. On his death without a direct heir Searle left a substantial bequest to their son Richard.\nReferences"
