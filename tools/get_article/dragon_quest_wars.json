It is part of the Dragon Quest series and supports up to three other players in multiplayer.\nGameplay\nDragon Quest Wars allows up to four players to battle one another with four monster units each on a four-sided battlefield made up a squares. Battles during the game are limited to five to ten turns. Players move units by touching and dragging them using the DS stylus. Commands are issued to units also by touching and dragging them onto a unit from the bottom of the screen. These commands are color-coded and include red (physical attacks), green (recovery), blue (defence), and yellow (magic). Each monster unit has between one and three hearts. These hearts deplete as monsters are attacked, and when they reach 0, the monster walks off the field. A player can win a battle either when all enemy units are defeated or if one of their units crosses into an enemy's base. Dragon Quest Wars also features \"survival matches\", which require the player to set all of their moves within a time limit before the battle begins. The game has six playable units: Slimes, Hammerhood, Dracky, Golem, Chimera, and Healslime. All are recurring monsters in the Dragon Quest series.\nDevelopment\nDragon Quest Wars was developed by Intelligent Systems as part of a collaboration between Nintendo and Square Enix for Intelligent Systems to design six video games for Square Enix on the DSiWare service.
