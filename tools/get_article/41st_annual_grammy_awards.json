Lauryn Hill led the ceremony with a record-breaking 10 nominations, becoming the first woman to achieve this milestone in a single night. During the event, she made history as the first woman to win five Grammy Awards in one night, the first artist to sweep the R&B field, and the first female rapper to win Best New Artist. Her critically acclaimed album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill became the first hip-hop album to win Album of the Year. Hill's then unprecedented sweep of the Grammys is widely regarded as one of the most significant moments in hip hop history.\nThe ceremony was widely dubbed as the \"Grammy Year of Women\", because all of the nominees for Album of the Year were female artists including Madonna, Shania Twain, Sheryl Crow and Garbage (with Shirley Manson as the lead singer). Songwriters James Horner and Will Jennings won Song of the Year for Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\", while Dion herself took home Record of the Year for the same song.\nMadonna who opened the show with a performance of \"Nothing Really Matters\", won three awards, while the Dixie Chicks, Vince Gill, Alanis Morissette, Stevie Wonder and Shania Twain each took home two awards.\nRicky Martin's performance of \"La Copa De La Vida\" (\"The Cup of Life\") was considered a highlight of the night, symbolizing the rapid rise of Latin pop on the global stage.\nPerformers\n* Celine Dion & Andrea Bocelli - The Prayer\n* Madonna - Nothing Really Matters\n* Shania Twain - Man!
