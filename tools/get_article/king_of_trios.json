The tournament was a different take on the Tag World Grand Prix event that the promotion was known for annually promoting; in King of Trios, instead of tag teams, there were trios that competed in six-man tag team matches to see who would advance. The tournament served as the promotion's premier event, similar to what WrestleMania is for the WWE.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Winner\n|-\n|2007 || Jigsaw, Mike Quackenbush and Shane Storm\n|-\n|2008 || Los Luchadores de Mexico(Incognito, Lince Dorado and El Pantera)\n|-\n|2009 || F.I.S.T.(Chuck Taylor, Gran Akuma and Icarus)\n|-\n|2010 || Bruderschaft des Kreuzes(Ares, Claudio Castagnoli and Tursas)\n|-\n|2011 || The Colony(Fire Ant, Green Ant [I] and Soldier Ant)\n|-\n|2012 || The Spectral Envoy(Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black)\n|-\n|2014 || The Devastation Corporation(Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster)\n|-\n|2015 || Team AAA(Aero Star, Drago and Fénix)\n|-\n|2016 || Team Sendai Girls(Cassandra Miyagi, Dash Chisako and Meiko Satomura)\n|-\n|2017 || House Strong Style(Pete Dunne, Trent Seven and Tyler Bate)\n|-\n|2018 || The ResistANTce(Fire Ant, Green Ant [II] and Thief Ant)\n|-\n|2019 || The Crucible(Lance Steel, Ophidian & Princess Kimber Lee)\n|}\n2007\n, Shane Storm and Jigsaw, the 2007 King of Trios]]\nAll in all, sixteen trios competed in the tournament, making for a total of forty-eight competitors.

Team Delicioso was originally scheduled to consist of Cassandro, El Hijo del Ice Cream and Ice Cream, Jr., but Cassandro was forced to withdraw from the tournament, after breaking his leg at Ring of Honor's The Big Bang! pay-per-view on April 3. He announced on a blog on Chikara's official website that he had hand-picked his replacement as opposed to letting it be decided by a random draw. On April 9 Curry Man was revealed as the replacement. Originally Team Mexico (Jorge \"Skayde\" Rivera, Turbo and Valiente) was scheduled to enter the tournament, but on April 22 the company announced that both Valiente and Turbo were off the event and that as a result they were severing all ties with Rivera, who was in charge of bringing the two to the event and who reportedly tried to hold the company up for more money, despite failing to deliver Valiente and Turbo, who had already taken bookings elsewhere for the weekend.
