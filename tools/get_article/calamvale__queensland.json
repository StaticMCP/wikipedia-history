The Calam family built their homestead on a hill at the top of Calam Road near Beaudesert Road. The area was known as Calamvale long before it was officially listed as a suburb in 1972. In 1984, the Calams sold the homestead to the McGuire family, who built the Calamvale Hotel on the land. Urbanisation took place in the early 1990s, and development took place in several stages.\nCalamvale State School opened on 11 May 1955. In January 2002, a secondary school component was added to the existing primary school to create Calamvale Community College.\nIn 1977 the Anglican Church of the Holy Spirit began with a small congregation meeting at the library of the Algester State School. In 1979 land was purchased in Algester Road and a kit home was built for a rectory with the first service being conducted on 21 October 1979 with the first baptist being conducted on 4 November 1979. In 1980 St Alban's Anglican Church at Acacia Ridge was decommissioned and the church building relocated to the Algester Road site to be used as a parish hall. The Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, John Grindrod, laid the foundation stone for the new church building on 4 July 1981 with the first service being held in the church on 9 August 1981 with its official dedication on 18 October conducted again by Grindrod. All debts having been paid, Archbishop Peter Hollingworth consecrated the new church on 29 May 1993.\nCalamvale Special School opened on 29 January 1985.\nWisdom College was established on 27 April 2011 as a non-denominational private school seeking to provide education to develop critical thinking with social responsibility and moral values.\nDemographics\nIn the , Calamvale had a population of 17,124 people, 51% female and 49% male.

It is in Zone 2 of the Translink zoning scheme.\nGolden Pond wetlands\nAn eco-friendly feature of Calamvale is the Golden Pond Wetlands attached to Calamvale Creek.\nA natural creek (part of a longer channel known as Scrubby Creek, but locally known as Calamvale Creek) and a riparian wetland run through the lower part of Calamvale. In the late 1990s, two constructed wetlands relying on storm water runoff were built upstream of the creek on each side of Golden Avenue. They are known as the Golden Pond wetlands.\nThe wetlands and creek, collectively called the Golden Pond wetland system, provide a small wildfowl habitat and a storm water treatment train designed to improve the quality of storm water runoff as it progresses down the creek.\nTreatment train\nThe treatment train is made up of several parts, and purifies water as it flows through each part.\nAn upstream storm water drainage channel runs into a sediment basin, which collects the heaviest sediments and allows better-quality water to flow into Wetland 1. Water flows through a gross pollutant trap into Wetland 2, which was originally a small farm dam on the south side of the Golden Avenue road bridge. Overflow water from Wetland 2 runs into a natural riparian wetland fringed with melaleucas, and this runs into a natural creek with small lagoons.\nWildlife\nThe Calamvale wetlands and creek provide a home and a retreat for ducks, egrets, cormorants, spoonbills, herons, water dragons, turtles, eels, and a large number of other wildfowl and animals.\nWater quality\nEnvironmental engineers from Brisbane's Griffith University have conducted numerous studies on water quality at the creek and wetlands, and have presented papers at conferences internationally on the design and effectiveness of the treatment train.\nNotable people\nActor Russell Dykstra grew up in the suburb, frequently entertaining commuters on the local 141 bus with his self-styled pantomimes while taking the long commute into St Laurence's College in South Brisbane as a schoolboy from 1979 to 1981.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*"
