In the , Mitchelton had a population of 9,244 people.\nGeography\nThe suburb is located  by road from the Brisbane GPO. Mitchelton is part of the northwestern suburbs. It is a growing suburb with many Queenslander style houses and leafy streets. The area is quite hilly and most of the suburb is on a north-facing slope.\nHistory\nMitchelton is an area with a long history. Mitchelton's name comes from one particular family of the first settlers in the area. The Mitchell family emigrated from England in the 1850s. Nicholas Mitchell purchased an estate he named \"Mitchelton\" by 1875. This area was first subdivided in the 1890s.\nSt Matthews Church of England was built from 1867 to 1869. The church and its cemetery are at 35 Church Road (). It was designed by Charles Tiffin.\nOn 4 October 1913, Arthur Blackwood sold a large portion of land known as the Oxford Park Estate between Samford Road and Kedron Brook. It was a subdivision of 300 suburban allotments (mostly 32 perches) and 8 larger farm allotments on St Helens Road fronting Kedron Brook. The estate created Blackwood Street and University Road (the northern part of which is now Pascoe Road). One of the advertised benefits of the estate were its  proximity to the proposed Groveley railway station on the Ferny Grove railway line. The estate gave its name to the Oxford Park railway station, despite the railway station being to the west of the estate, which resulted in land near that railway station being commonly known as Oxford Park (although that land never formed part of the Oxford Park subdivision).\nGrovely State School opened on 9 October 1916. It was renamed Mitchelton State School in 1923. (It is not to be confused with the present day Grovely State School in Keperra, which opened in 1956).\nIn June 1922, the third section of Grovely Lodge Estate, consisting of149 residential sites and 4 large blocks, was advertised by Cameron Bros Auctioneers. The estate was described as 5 minutes walk to both Mitchelton railway station and state school.\nThe first section of Mitchelton View Estate was offered for sale in 1926 by B.F. Caniffe. In May 1933, B.F. Caniffe auctioned 50 suburban blocks, the third section of the Mitchelton View Estate. The subdivision was bounded by Gizerah Street, Taylors Road, Frasers Road and Mashobra Street. However, the bidding did not reach the reserve price and the blocks were not sold.\nIn 1930 the Sisters of the Good Shepherd established the Good Shepherd Home for girls with special needs or those deemed to be \"uncontrollable\" in their own homes; these girls worked in the home's commercial laundry. The home was closed in late 1974 due to changes in community and government expectations about institutionalised care of children.\nin January 1949 the Sisters of the Good Samaritan opened Our Lady of Dolours Catholic School at the request of James Duhig, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, with 69 students and two sisters as teachers.\nMitchelton Infants State School opened on 29 January 1952; it closed 1 January 1986.\nMitchelton State High School opened on 31 January 1956.\nAll Souls' Anglican church was dedicated on 26 March 1961 by Archbishop Halse and consecrated on 9 March 1975 by Archbishop Arnott. Its closure was approved circa 1986. It was located at 10 Tel El Kebir Street on the corner of Heliopolis Parade (). As at 2020, the building is used as a child care centre.\nMt Maria College was established in Mitchelton in 1979 by amalgamating Years 11 and 12 of Marcellin College (a Catholic boys school in Enoggera) with St Benedict's College (a Catholic girls school in Wilston). It occupied the former Good Shepherd Home.\nMitchelton State Special School opened on 17 May 1971.\nThe current Mitchelton Public Library opened in 1983 and had a major refurbishment in 2013.\nDemographics\nIn the , Mitchelton had a population of 8,559 people, 52.3% female and 47.7% male.
