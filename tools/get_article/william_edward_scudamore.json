His popular devotional manual Steps to the Altar reached its sixty-seventh edition in 1887, and was used extensively in North America and on the Indian subcontinent in addition to in Great Britain.\nScudamore was a nephew of the eminent physician of gout Sir Charles Scudamore. Educated initially in Belgium, he matriculated at St. John's College, Cambridge in 1831, where he received the degrees of B.A. (1835) and M.A. (1838). He was admitted as a fellow of the college on March 14, 1837. Scudamore was active in the organization of women's religious life in the Church of England, serving as chaplain to a church institution for women first at Shipmeadow in Suffolk and then at Ditchingham in Norfolk where he was rector of St. Mary's Church. This became the Community of All Hallows, whose Ditchingham convent closed in April 2018.\nA moderate Anglo-Catholic, Scudamore entered into public controversy with the English Church Union over church calendar revision, wafer-bread, and non-communicating attendance at the Holy Communion.\nBibliography\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=mlwXAAAAYAAJ Manual of Devotions for Confirmation and First Communion] (1848)\n*[https://archive.org/details/anessayonoffice00scudgoog An Essay on the Office of the Intellect in Religion with Especial Reference to the Evidences of a Revelation, and the Proof of Christian Doctrine] (1849)\n*[https://archive.org/details/letterstoaseced00scudgoog Letters to a Seceder from the Church of England to the Communion of Rome] (1851)\n*[https://archive.org/details/stepstoaltarmanu00scud_0 Steps to the Altar: A Manual of Devotions for the Blessed Eucharist] (1853) (74 editions)\n*''[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6gLixV_Ax8C The Abiding Holiness of God's House: A Sermon] (1855)\n*[https://archive.org/details/communionoflaity00scud The Communion of the Laity: An Essay, Chiefly Historical, on the Rule and Practice of the Church with Respect to the Reception of the Consecrated Elements, at the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist] (1855)\n*[https://archive.org/details/englandromediscu00scudiala England and Rome: A Discussion of the Principal Doctrines and Passages of History in Common Debate between the Members of the Two Communions] (1855)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=dZ_pmFGVFIcC The Working of the Good Leaven in the People and Church of England: A Sermon Preached at the Anniversary of the New Church at Sotherton, on S.
