During the Second World War, British Somaliland was invaded by Italian troops, but the British eventually regained control of it.  After the war, British Somaliland remained a British protectorate, but it was decided that British Somaliland and the Trust Territory of Somaliland (formerly Italian Somaliland) would be united as a single independent state after a prolonged transition period.\nMuhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal salutes the flag.]]\nand the Government of Somaliland in connexion with the Attainment of Independence by Somaliland]]\nOn 26 June 1960, British Somaliland gained independence as the State of Somaliland.  On 1 July, the country united with the former Italian Somaliland to become the Somali Republic. The anniversaries of both events are now celebrated as public holidays in Somaliland and Somalia.\nOn 18 May 1991, a revived Republic of Somaliland \"reaffirmed\" sovereignty over State of Somaliland from the Somali Democratic Republic. Since 1991, Somaliland has been a self-declared sovereign state that is recognised as an autonomous independent region of Somalia by the international community.  Its government regards its territory as the successor state to the State of Somaliland, and seeks full international recognition as the Republic of Somaliland.\nReferences"
