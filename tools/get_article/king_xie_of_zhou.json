At the same time, Ji Han (), Duke of Guo (), conspired with the Quanrong to elevate Ji Yuchen to the Zhou throne. Thus began a period when there existed two parallel Zhou kings, a stalemate brought to an end in 750 BCE when Marquis Wen of Jin killed King Xie of Zhou.\nDocumented sources\nAccording to the Zuo Zhuan:\n:As far as King You was concerned, heaven had no pity for him, he was muddle-headed and not up to the job, having used criminal means to obtain the throne. King Xie violated the Mandate of Heaven, the vassal states usurped his power and he moved his capital to Jiaru (}}).\nThe Xinian Annals (), which were among the recently unearthed Tsinghua Bamboo Slips, gives King Xie's posthumous name as King Hui of Xie () and records him as a younger brother of King You of Zhou.\nOrigin of the name\nTang dynasty (618–907 CE) scholar Kong Yingda noted that the Bamboo Annals contained the words \"Han, Duke of Guo, enthroned Yuchen at Xie\" inferring that Xie was a place name. A further scroll in the Bamboo Annals records that Xie was a place although its location is unknown. However, according to Kong Yingda other parts of the Bamboo Annals contradict this suggestion.\nThe New Book of Tang links Xie with Feng (), Qi () and Li () which were parts of the ancient province known as Yong Province (), thus adding weight to the theory that Xie was a location.\nNotes\nReferences"
