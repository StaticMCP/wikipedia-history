Brown's undergraduate and graduate programs in archaeology are organized through the institute.\nHistory\nThe Joukowsky Institute was established in 2004, with an eight–figure gift from Artemis Joukowsky and Martha Sharp Joukowsky. Artemis had previously served as the university's Chancellor while Martha was professor emerita of Old World Archaeology and Art.\nThe Institute continued and expanded the activities of Brown's former Center for Old World Archaeology and Art (COWAA), which Sharp Joukowsky directed until her retirement in 2004. COWAA was founded in 1978 by R. Ross Holloway, professor of classics and Rudolf Winkes, historian of ancient Roman art. Martha Sharp Joukowsky joined the faculty soon after its establishment and expanded the center's scope to include the Middle East.\nIn 2006, Susan E. Alcock began as the institute's inaugural director Peter van Dommelen succeeded Alcock, becoming Director of the Institute in July 2015. The current director, Andrew Scherer, has been Director of the Institute since July 2023.\nThe institute began in 70 Waterman St, a facility renovated for use with funding from the Joukowskys in 1981. Beginning in 2006, Rhode Island Hall, on Brown's Main Green was extensively renovated for use by the institute. Led by Anmahian Winton Architects, the renovation cost a total of $12 million; the building opened in September 2009.\nThe Joukowsky Institute holds its own collection of several thousand archeological objects, independent from the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology. Among these items are a numismatic collection and materials excavated by Brown archeologists at Petra in Jordan. In November and December 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Institute held a series of online lectures themed around epidemics and pandemics in Antiquity.\ndescribing excavations by Brown researchers]]\nCore faculty\nAndrew Scherer is director of the institute, having succeeded Peter van Dommelen in 2023.
