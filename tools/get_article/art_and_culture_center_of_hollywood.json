Its permanent collection includes artwork from Pablo Picasso, Georgia O'Keeffe and David Hockney.\nThe ACCH is the third oldest arts nonprofit in Broward County.\nHistory\nThe Hollywood Art and Culture Center of Hollywood was founded in 1975. It was originally based in a small community space on 1301 S. Drive in Hollywood Beach. The grand opening took place in the same year as the 50th anniversary for the City of Hollywood.\nIn 1992, the Center moved to the recently renovated Kagey Home, which had been built in 1924. In 1999, the Center took on the management for the City of Hollywood of the 500-seat Hollywood Central Performing Arts Center (HCPAC) in the separate location of the downtown district of the city.\nIn 2020, the Center launched the Open Dialogues film series \"to promote acceptance and inclusion in our community through documentary film shorts and other programming\".\nRecent exhibitions history\nExploding the Lotus (2008)\nA multimedia exhibit created by artists from the culture of the Indian Subcontinent. The curators of the show were Jane Hart, curator of exhibitions for the center, and New York-based Jaishri Abichandani.\nTM Sisters: Ideal Tonight (2009)\nThe exhibit was created by Tasha and Monica López De Victoria (TM Sisters) The New Times newspaper described the show as:Indeed, their art practically bleeds Miami. It's filled with pastels, dulcet tones that rip from page and screen with spiritual vibrancy. Sharp lines abound, distorting images, or collecting in electric zig-zags that bolt around purposefully. They're pieces that would look as much at home on an album cover for some electro-pop band as they do on the walls of a gallery — which isn't to say they simply languish in pop appeal.\nArt is Supposed to Hypnotize You or Something (2010)\nThe exhibit was created by Wayne Wright. Former curator Jane Hart had coordinated the NEA funding for the show.\nThe Art of the Brick (2012)\nThe Art of the Brick was traveling exhibition of unique applications of Lego bricks as sculptures by Nathan Sawaya. An Art and Culture had taken place in 2012.\nGallery\nFile:Art Of The Brick exhibition in Singapore 2024 55.jpg|Examples of the Art of the Brick by Sawaya.\nFile:Art Of The Brick exhibition in Singapore 2024 53.jpg|Art of The Brick exhibition in Singapore (2024).\nFile:Jaishri Abichandani.jpg|Jaishri Abichandani was one of the curators for \"Exploding the Lotus\".\nHollywood Art and Culture Center - Kagey Home\nJack Kagey was a Sales Manager at Joseph W. Young's Hollywood Land and Water Company during the 1920’s Real Estate Boom. Kagey and his 11-man team sold $426,260 in properties in just 10 weeks. First prize was a choice of a car or $5,000. Kagey took the money since he already owned two cars. He then used the money to build his home, the Kagey Home, which is now the main property in the cultural center. The home of his employer, the Joseph Wesley Young House, was designed by Rubush & Hunter. Kagey had the same architect firm design his house as well. In 1992, the building was renovated and became the home of ACCH . The official groundbreaking for the 5,400-square-foot art education wing addition to the building took place April 30, 2024.\nFile:Hollywood FL JW Young House01.jpg|The Joseph Wesley Young House in Hollywood, Florida.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://artandculturecenter.org/more History of the Hollywood Art and Culture Center]\n*[http://www.artandculturecenter.org/kagey-mansion-history History of the Kagey Mansion]\n*"
