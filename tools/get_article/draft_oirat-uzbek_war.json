It put a heavy blow to the Uzbek Khanate, this defeat severely weakened Abu’l-Khayr's authority over the Uzbek tribal confederation, triggering internal unrest that eventually contributed to the formation of the Kazakh Khanate in the following decade.\nBackground\nIn the mid-15th century, Central Asia was dominated by a shifting balance of nomadic confederations and post-Timurid successor states. The Oirats, a powerful Western Mongol confederation, had emerged as a dominant force on the eastern steppes following the decline of the Yuan dynasty. Under leaders such as Esen Taishi, the Oirats extended their influence across Dzungaria, the Altai region, and parts of Moghulistan. After Esen's death in 1455, Oirat power remained significant in the east, and their raids frequently reached into Central Asia's settled frontiers.\nAt the same time, the Uzbeks, a loose confederation of Turkic and Mongol tribes were united under the leadership of Abu’l-Khayr Khan (r. 1428–1468), founder of what is often termed the Abu’l-Khayrid Uzbek Khanate. Abu’l-Khayr's realm stretched from the Tobol and Irtysh rivers in the north to the Syr Darya basin in the south, incorporating much of the steppe between the Aral Sea and the Kazakh uplands. His power was based on alliances among steppe tribes such as the Shibanids, Manghits, and others descended from the Golden Horde.\nDespite his initial successes, Abu’l-Khayr faced opposition from both internal tribal factions and external rivals. His consolidation of power alienated parts of the Uzbek nobility and provoked tension with the neighboring Moghul Khanate of Eastern Turkestan, ruled by the Dughlat-linked Chaghatayid khans. Moreover, his expansion into the Syr Darya oasis cities, such as Sighnaq, Sauran, and Yasi brought the Uzbeks into direct conflict with the Oirats and their allies, who sought control over the same trade routes linking the steppe to Transoxiana.\nCampaign\nIn 1457, following years of instability among the Uzbeks, the Oirat Mongols launched a westward campaign from the eastern steppe regions. The Oirats were then under the leadership of Amasanjī Taishi (also spelled Amasanji or Amisanji), one of the successors of Esen Taishi, who had consolidated Oirat power after the collapse of the Northern Yuan. The invasion was part of a series of Oirat incursions into Central Asia and Moghulistan that sought to dominate key trade and pasture zones along the Syr Darya.\nTarbaghatai & Tengeri Campaign, Battle of Kokpekty, Ili River (1457)\nAt the time, Abu’l-Khayr Khan's Uzbek state was suffering from internal divisions. Several tribal leaders, notably Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan, had broken away, weakening Abu’l-Khayr's control over the confederation. In 1457, The Oirat advance took advantage of this political turmoil. Mobilizing a large cavalry force, Amasanjī Taishi invaded the Tarbagatai, and Fought at Kokpekty with targeting Abu’l-Khayr Khan's strongholds. Later they mobilized to Tengeri mountains and Defeated the Uzbek army on Ili River.\nSyr Darya Campaign\nLater by traditional history, though mostly likely undocumented, they campaigned on Zhetysu & Balkhash areas and defeated several Princes or Nobles on Shu River. Later, They invaded the Syr Darya basin, striking Uzbek-held territories centered around Sighnaq, a key fortress and administrative center.\nThe confrontation between the Oirat and Uzbek forces occurred near Kok-Kashan (or possibly Sighnaq, according to some accounts). Abu’l-Khayr hastily gathered his\nforces to repel the invasion, but his army—composed of loosely united tribal contingents—was unprepared for the disciplined and heavily armed Oirat cavalry. The resulting battle ended in a decisive Oirat victory, with much of the Uzbek force annihilated or scattered. Several prominent Uzbek nobles and tribal leaders were killed in battle, and others were captured. The Oirats plundered the Syr Darya region, devastating its settlements and pastures. Abu’l-Khayr himself barely escaped, retreating northward into the steppe. The defeat severely weakened his authority, causing a collapse in morale among his subjects and accelerating the fragmentation of the Uzbek realm.\nFollowing the victory, Amasanjī Taishi did not attempt to permanently occupy Uzbek lands. Instead, the Oirats withdrew eastward after securing tribute and demonstrating their supremacy. However, the repercussions of the campaign were long-lasting: the Uzbeks lost control over several Syr Darya towns, and their defeat indirectly facilitated the rise of the Kazakh Khanate under Janibek and Kerei soon afterward.\nAftermath\nThe Oirat victory in 1457 had significant political consequences for the Uzbek Khanate, though it did not result in permanent territorial changes. Abu’l-Khayr Khan's forces were decisively defeated near Sighnaq, and many tribal leaders and nobles were killed or captured. This loss weakened Abu’l-Khayr's authority, exacerbating existing divisions among the Uzbek tribal confederation.\nThe defeat also encouraged disaffected Uzbek leaders to break away from Abu’l-Khayr's rule. Most notably, the Kerei and Janibek clans, dissatisfied with his leadership, migrated to the Kazakh steppe, where they later established the Kazakh Khanate around the 1460s. This event marked a major fragmentation of the Abu’l-Khayrid Uzbek polity and reshaped the political landscape of the Central Asian steppe.\nDespite their victory, the Oirats did not permanently occupy Uzbek lands. They withdrew eastward after raiding the Syr Darya region, having demonstrated their military supremacy and secured short-term tribute. The campaign reinforced the Oirat reputation as a dominant steppe power, while signaling the limits of Abu’l-Khayr's expansionist ambitions.\nOverall, the 1457 campaign altered the balance of power in Central Asia, weakening the Uzbek Khanate and contributing indirectly to the rise of new political entities such as the Kazakh Khanate, while the Oirats maintained their influence in Dzungaria and the eastern steppes.\nSee also\n* Abu’l-Khayr Khan\n* Oirat Confederation\n* Kazakh Khanate\n* Sighnaq\n* Central Asian Steppe\n* Kazakh War of Independence\nReferences"
