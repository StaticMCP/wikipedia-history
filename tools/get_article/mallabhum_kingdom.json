The Malla Rajas ruled over the vast territory in the south-western part of present West Bengal and a part of southeastern Jharkhand.\nExtent\nFrom around 7th century CE until the advent of British rule, the history of Bankura district is identical with the rise and fall of the Hindu Rajas of Bishnupur.\nAdministration\nMahals\nAccording to Bhattacharjee, Tarun Dev (1982) During the Malla period, society was primarily organised around the village. The tax collectors were known as Gumasta, with their assistants called Aat Pahari or Paik. The village headman, responsible for overseeing the community, was referred to as the Mukhiya or Mandal, and was considered the protector of the village.\nThe Malla kings maintained several service groups, and due to a shortage of money, they often compensated these groups with land rather than salaries. This land was of two types: Panchaki jamin, which had a small tax, and Bepanchaki jamin, which was exempt from tax. The lands were named based on the services provided, such as.\n1. Senapati Mahal: Land for the head of the soldiers.\n2. Mahalbera Mahal: Land for the sentries.\n3. Chharidar Mahal: Land for the bodyguards.\n4. Jungle Mahal\nAccording to LSS O’Malley: }}\nThe Bishnupur Raj maintained a distinct Jungle Mahal, which consisted solely of forested areas, where forest resources were regularly harvested and sold.\n5. Ghatwals Mahal\nThe ghatwals were a ‘quasi military body of men employed by the Rajas of Bishnupur’ who\nwere posted as guards at various strategic Ghats or passes in hills and uplands. They also did\npolice duties and acted as peacekeepers. Rent-free lands given to the ghatwals by the Rajas\nfrom time to time came to be known as Ghatwali lands. Though at the time of the Permanent\nSettlement (between 1791 and 1802) the area of lands held by ghatwals was not known later\nsurveys of 1854-56 and 1879-1887 estimated the area of the ghatwali land in the Bishnupur\nEstate to be about 170,000 acres\nBishnupur and His Alliance with the Mughals\nIn the late 16th century, Bir Hambir, the ruler of Bishnupur, allied with Mughal general Man Singh during Akbar's campaign against Qutlu Khan Lohani, the Afghan ruler of North Orissa. Despite being ignored by Jagat Singh, Man Singh's son, Bir Hambir bravely rescued him from an Afghan ambush, solidifying his alliance with the Mughals. This act highlighted Bir Hambir's courage, strategic brilliance, and enduring legacy as a wise leader.\nDecline Under British Rule\nGreat Bishnupur famine of 1770\nAround 1770-71, as the \"great famine\" swept through the region, the South Western Highlands of Bengal had transformed into a land of the dead.\nAccording to W.W. Hunter, the situation was summed up in his famous Annals of Rural Bengal:\nThe greatest threat to the Company was depopulation, which, despite the famine, led them to continually pressure the local rulers—the now-weakened Rajas of Bishnupur (referred to as Bishenpore by Hunter). In Bishnupur, hundreds of villages were completely abandoned, and even in the larger towns, fewer than one-fourth of the houses remained occupied. Purnia and Bishnupur were the two districts in Bengal that suffered the most from the famine. In 1772, Warren Hastings estimated that by that time, one-third of the population had perished.\nBishnupur 1823, the capital of the Malla rulers of Bengal,drawing by Charles D'Oyly]]\nRebellion at Bishnupur (1788-1809)\nBetween 1788 and 1809, the Chuars and Paiks of the Bishnupur and Midnapore parganas revolted against the British East India Company under the leadership of Madhav Singha Dev.\nList of Malla kings\nMalla's started their own calendar that is Malla era (Mallabda). It is told that Malla era started from Indra Dwadasi day in the year 102 Bengali calendar of the month Bhadro (August- September).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header-multi\"\n!Sl.
