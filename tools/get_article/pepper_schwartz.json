She is the author or co-author of numerous books, magazines, and website columns, and is a television personality on the subject of sexuality.\nSchwartz is notable for her work in the 1970s and early 1980s that culminated in the book American Couples: Money-Work-Sex, which was co-written with Philip Blumstein and surveyed lesbian couples, gay male couples and heterosexual couples.\nSchwartz also serves as the Love & Relationship Expert & Ambassador for AARP and writes the column The Naked Truth.\nBiography\nSchwartz was born in Chicago, Illinois, into a Jewish home, the daughter of Gertrude and her husband, Julius J. Schwartz, an attorney.\nShe received a BA and an MA from the coeducational Washington University in St. Louis and came to Yale University as a graduate student in sociology in 1968, the year before Yale admitted female undergraduates receiving an MA and PhD in sociology in 1974. While a graduate student there, she co-authored with Janet Lever the 1971 book Women at Yale, documenting the first year of co-education at that university.\nSchwartz wrote the column \"Sex and Health\" for Glamour magazine for seven years. She has appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Dateline, and Dr. Phil, as well as on programs for the cable television network Lifetime; she currently airs as one of the relationship “experts” on the reality television show Married at First Sight. She was the 2005 president of the Pacific Sociological Association, helped create the dating website Perfectmatch.com, and is a sexuality adviser for WebMD.\nSchwartz is a past president and fellow of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality and a charter member of the International Academy of Sex Research. The book jacket for her 2007 publication Prime: Adventures and Advice on Sex, Love, and the Sensual Years described her living \"in Washington State, being single after a 23 year marriage, and having two children in college\".\nResearch by Schwartz and others surveying lesbian sexuality has generated debates because the surveys stated that lesbian couples in long-term relationships have less sex than their heterosexual or gay male counterparts. The phenomenon was labeled \"lesbian bed death\". One factor in this debate concerns how \"sex\" acts were defined in surveys.\nWorks\n*Sex and the Yale Student, with Richard Feller, Elaine Fox, and Dr. Philip Sarrel (The Committee on Human Sexuality, Yale University, 1970)\n*The Student Guide to Sex on Campus, by the Student Committee on Human Sexuality at Yale, edited by Richard Feller, Elaine Fox, and Pepper Schwartz (Signet Books, 1971)\n*Women at Yale: Liberating a College Campus, with Janet Lever (Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1971)\n*American Couples, with Philip Blumstein (William Morrow, 1983)\n**American Couples: Money-Work-Sex, with Philip Blumstein (Pocket Books, 1985) ,\n*Gender in Intimate Relationships: A Micro-Structural Approach, with Barbara J.
