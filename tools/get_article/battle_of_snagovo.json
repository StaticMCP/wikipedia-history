The clashes took place at and near the village of Snagovo and in areas northwest of Zvornik as the 28th Division column attempted to break through VRS lines and reach government-held territory around Tuzla.\nBackground\nIn the aftermath of the fall of Srebrenica on 11 July 1995, approximately 12,000 soldiers and civilians primarily members and affiliates of the ARBiH 28th Division attempted a mass escape westward toward Tuzla. The column, exhausted and mixed with unarmed civilians, nevertheless included experienced veterans who had previously fought throughout 1992 and 1993. Initially, VRS commanders underestimated the size and combat capability of the escaping column, but by 13 July the Main Staff and Drina Corps recognized the threat and ordered that \"all available able-bodied manpower\" be used to destroy the column.\nThe Battle\nOn 14 July, near the small village of Snagovo southwest of Zvornik, elements of the VRS launched ambushes against the lead elements of the 28th Division. The attacks began with intense mortar bombardment and continued with small-arms engagements. Despite severe exhaustion, hunger, and deprivation after days of marching through forests under constant threat of ambush, Bosnian forces rallied and engaged in a prolonged fight. Survivors later described how many soldiers could barely stand from fatigue, yet still pressed forward with determination. For several hours the ARBiH troops fought to clear the ambush and, against all odds, disengaged in good order under the cover of heavy rain and night, allowing the column to continue its movement. By 15 July the column approached the final VRS defensive positions near the Muslim-held villages of Međeđa and Nezuk and the Serb-held Baljkovica Hill (the frontline trenches commonly referred to as the \"Sapna Thumb\"). Lieutenant Colonel Vinko Pandurević, commander of the 1st Zvornik Brigade, attempted to redeploy his best troops to stop the breakout, but they were not yet in position. In a decisive action, Major Ejup Golić selected roughly 120 of his best fighters and led a direct charge that overwhelmed the VRS 4th Infantry Battalion, destroying its headquarters and capturing several heavy weapons, including a Praga self-propelled anti-aircraft gun and two self-propelled artillery pieces.\nRescue operation and corridor to Tuzla\nConcurrently, commanders of the ARBiH 2nd Corps debated and ultimately authorized a last-minute operation to assist the fleeing column. Units from Brigadier Salih Malkić's 24th Division including the 242nd Zvornik Muslim Light Brigade, the 243rd Podrinje Mountain Brigade, elements of the 245th and 246th Mountain Brigades, the 241st Spreča Muslim Light Brigade, and specialized sabotage elements  launched an offensive from areas around Dugi Dio and Gaj to widen contact with the civilians. At dawn on 16 July, 24th Division troops made contact with the 28th Division lead elements; within two hours a narrow escape corridor had been opened. During this period the VRS had proposed a five-day local ceasefire beginning at 1300 on 16 July, and VRS reports indicate the Zvornik Brigade had sustained heavy casualties in the fighting. The temporary pause allowed approximately 4,500 soldiers and civilians from the 28th Division column to pass through into friendly lines. Small-scale infiltration missions after the corridor was pinned off recovered additional survivors (roughly 700 more), bringing the total number of known survivors to less than half of those who originally departed Srebrenica.\nReferences"
