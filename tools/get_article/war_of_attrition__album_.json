According to the album booklet, the album's lyrics were written solely by guitarist Mike Kimball. This album was praised by original fans due to its return to traditional Dying Fetus form but was also criticized for its poor production in comparison to other releases. It was also their first self-produced album in nine years.\nFormer co-vocalist Vince Matthews and former drummer Eric Seyanga departed in 2005 to form the band Covenance. Gallagher once again found a new member, drummer Duane Timlin. With this line-up, Gallagher promised to record what he called \"our most brutal album yet\".\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*John Gallagher –  guitars, vocals\n*Mike Kimball – guitars\n*Sean Beasley – bass guitar, vocals\n*Duane Timlin – drums\nReferences"
