These awards have been issued since 2017. From 2005 to 2013, MLB honored a single relief pitcher across both leagues with the Delivery Man of the Month Award during each month of the regular season.\nAwards by month\nMLB previously introduced a Reliever of the Year Award in 2014, awarded to one reliever in the American League and one in the National League. In 2017, MLB added a monthly award, also given to one reliever in each league, for each month of the regular season. The award was sponsored by The Hartford, a Connecticut-based investment and insurance company, from inception through the 2020 season.\nThe most Reliever of the Month awards won by a single player is ten by Edwin Díaz. He is followed by Josh Hader (8), Emmanuel Clase (7), Liam Hendriks (4), Aroldis Chapman (4), and Raisel Iglesias (4).\nThe table below lists monthly winners; a number in parentheses indicates the number of instances of winning the award for players who have previously won.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Year\n!rowspan=2|Month\n!colspan=2|American League\n!colspan=2|National League\n!rowspan=2 class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n!Player\n!Team\n!Player\n!Team\n|-\n| rowspan=6|2017 ||  ||  || Cleveland Indians ||  || Colorado Rockies ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Boston Red Sox ||   || Colorado Rockies ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Toronto Blue Jays ||  || Los Angeles Dodgers ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Seattle Mariners ||  || San Diego Padres ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Tampa Bay Rays ||  || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n|  ||  || New York Yankees ||  || Washington Nationals ||\n|-\n| rowspan=6|2018 ||  ||   || Seattle Mariners ||  || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Oakland Athletics ||   || San Diego Padres ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Seattle Mariners ||  || Miami Marlins ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Seattle Mariners ||  || Pittsburgh Pirates ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Seattle Mariners ||  || Philadelphia Phillies ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Oakland Athletics ||   || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n| rowspan=6|2019 ||  ||  || Detroit Tigers ||  || San Diego Padres ||\n|-\n|  ||   || New York Yankees ||   || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Oakland Athletics ||   || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n|  ||  || New York Yankees ||  || New York Mets ||\n|-\n|  ||   || New York Yankees ||   || Pittsburgh Pirates ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Boston Red Sox ||  || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n| rowspan=2|2020 ||  ||   || Oakland Athletics ||   || Los Angeles Dodgers ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Los Angeles Angels ||  || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n| rowspan=6|2021 ||  ||  || Boston Red Sox ||  || San Diego Padres ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Chicago White Sox ||  || Chicago Cubs ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Oakland Athletics ||   || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Los Angeles Angels ||  || San Francisco Giants ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Cleveland Indians ||   || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Chicago White Sox ||  || San Francisco Giants ||\n|-\n| rowspan=6|2022 ||  ||  || Toronto Blue Jays ||   || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n|  ||  || New York Yankees ||  || Pittsburgh Pirates ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Cleveland Guardians ||   || New York Mets ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Toronto Blue Jays ||   || New York Mets ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Cleveland Guardians ||   || New York Mets ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Cleveland Guardians ||   || San Francisco Giants ||\n|-\n| rowspan=6|2023 ||  ||  || Baltimore Orioles ||   || San Diego Padres ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Detroit Tigers ||   || San Francisco Giants ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Baltimore Orioles  ||   || Philadelphia Phillies ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Baltimore Orioles ||  || Milwaukee Brewers ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Seattle Mariners ||   || Atlanta Braves ||\n|-\n|  ||   || New York Yankees ||  || Miami Marlins ||\n|-\n| rowspan=6|2024 ||  ||  || Oakland Athletics ||  || St. Louis Cardinals ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Cleveland Guardians ||  || San Diego Padres ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Los Angeles Angels ||   || St. Louis Cardinals ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Cleveland Guardians ||   || Miami Marlins/San Diego Padres ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Houston Astros||   || Atlanta Braves ||\n|-\n|  ||   || Cleveland Guardians ||   || St. Louis Cardinals ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |2025 ||  ||   || Seattle Mariners ||   || San Diego Padres ||\n|-\n| ||  || Minnesota Twins ||   || New York Mets ||\n|-\n| ||   || Houston Astros ||   || Pittsburgh Pirates ||\n|-\n| ||   || Los Angeles Angels ||   || New York Mets ||\n|-\n| ||   || Boston Red Sox ||   || Atlanta Braves ||\n|-\n| ||  || Cleveland Guardians ||   || San Diego Padres ||\n|}\nSee also\n*Baseball awards\n*List of MLB awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mlb-relievers-of-the-month.shtml List of winners] at Baseball-Reference.com\n*[https://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/reliever_of_the_month_award.shtml List of winners] at Baseball Almanac"
