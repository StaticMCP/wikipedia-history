Notable industries include manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, health care and social assistance, accommodation and food services. Manufacturing, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHistoric_family_farms_of_Licking_County%2C_Ohio#Content_added agriculture], and services prove to be the major sectors of Licking County's industry.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing is one of the largest industry sectors in Licking County.

However, in the past many other successful manufacturing companies have come to a close, such as Longaberger, Fyrepel, Meritor plant in Heath, and E.T. Rugg.

Weiant Greenhouses was another local company that grew lettuce. It covered five acres of glass structures, becoming one of the largest greenhouses in Ohio and providing vegetables to three nearby states during its time.

While modern farmers have multiple advantages such as better agricultural equipment, pesticides and fertilizers, many have encountered challenges due to an increase in the cost of producing crops and raising livestock, and a declining payout as well.\nServices\nThe service industry, as a whole, has provided jobs for more than 30% of the employed population in Licking County.

Opioids, which encompass a variety of drugs, are often used for pain relief. However, when opioids are taken in large doses, they can be fatal. Synthetic varieties of opioids, such as fentanyl, have been listed as one of the main contributors to the ongoing crisis. Evidence indicates that the opioid and overdose crises in Licking County have been affected by unemployment in the region, economic inequalities, and local, state, and federal responses to the crises. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, one director of a residential treatment center attributed isolation to the rise in overdose deaths across Licking County. Others have attributed the rise in overdose deaths to a rise in fentanyl and its analogues in the drug supply.\nStatistics\nSince 2001, unintentional drug overdose deaths in Licking County have increased. Between 2001 and 2010, the number of unintentional overdose fatalities per year ranged from four to 24. From 2011 to 2020, annual overdose deaths ranged from 13 to 47 per year. In 2022, 58 people died in Licking County due to unintetional drug overdoses.  Licking County Memorial Health Systems found out that when focusing on fentanyl related deaths, the number increased by over 1000% between 2014 and 2018, from 2 to 21 deaths. The Licking County Health Department reported that fentanyl played a role in nearly three quarters of overdose deaths in 2020 and 2021.\nOverdose Mapping\nIn 2020, the Licking County Health Department introduced a new overdose mapping system that began tracking fatal and nonfatal overdose cases in the region. The system was designed, in part, to identify surges in overdoses that could then allow for more efficient and effective distribution of naloxone, a drug that reverses opioid overdose. It is possible that the recent increases in overdoses throughout Licking County may be the result of more overdoses being reported across the county as a result of overdose mapping.\nDemographics\nIn 2021, of the 47 opioid related death, the primary group affected was white males between the ages 25-44. Annual data from the Licking County overdose fatality review illustrates 72% of overdoses in 2021 were male, while the remaining 28% were female. The most affected age range was 35-44 years old, with 15 deaths, followed closely by those aged 25-34, with 14 deaths. Additionally, 94% of deaths in 2021 were White/Caucasian and 6% were Black/African American. Regarding the level of education of those affected, 59.6% were high school graduates or had a GED, while 17% did not graduate high school. Additionally, 12.8% had a college education without a degree, and 8.5% held a college undergraduate degree.\nRefusal of Syringe Services Program\nSyringe services programs (SSPs) offer drug users clean injection equipment and often other services, like referrals to treatment facilities, access to naloxone, and screenings for disease. Evidence indicates that SSPs help prevent the spread of disease, increase the likelihood that drug users will enter treatment, and decrease overdose deaths. Unsanitary syringe use has been a cause for the Hepatitis-C cases in the County. Despite these facts, in 2019, the Licking County Health Department unanimously voted against implementing a syringe exchange program in the county, and in 2024 it indicated that it was not willing to revisit its decision. Various organizations have taken issue with the Health Department's, decision, such as Licking County's branch of OhioCAN.\nResources available\nVarious programs have emerged in Licking County to address the opioid and overdose crises.The Licking County Linkages Program helps individuals recovering from substance addiction by providing health care. In addition, their goals also revolve around reducing stigmas surrounding substance abuse as well as informing the general public of the dangers of drug consumption. Other services throughout Licking County include disposal of unwanted pills which can be done at several police stations within the county.\nCommunities\nMap of Licking County, Ohio with Municipal and Township Labels\nCities\n* Heath\n* Johnstown\n* New Albany\n* Newark (county seat)\n* Pataskala\n* Reynoldsburg\nVillages\n* Alexandria\n* Buckeye Lake\n* Granville\n* Gratiot\n* Hanover\n* Hartford\n* Hebron\n* Kirkersville\n* St. Louisville\n* Utica\nTownships\n* Bennington\n* Bowling Green\n* Burlington\n* Eden\n* Etna\n* Fallsbury\n* Franklin\n* Granville\n* Hanover\n* Harrison\n* Hartford\n* Hopewell\n* Jersey\n* Liberty\n* Licking\n* Madison\n* Mary Ann\n* McKean\n* Monroe\n* Newark\n* Newton\n* Perry\n* St. Albans\n* Union\n* Washington\nCensus-designated places\n* Beechwood Trails\n* Brownsville\n* Etna\n* Granville South\n* Harbor Hills\n* Jacksontown\n* Jersey\n* Marne\nUnincorporated communities\n* Amsterdam\n* Appleton\n* Ben\n* Boston\n* Chatham\n* Columbia Center\n* Fleatown\n* Fredonia\n* Homer\n* Linnville\n* Lloyd Corners\n* Locust Grove\n* Luray\n* New Way\n* Outville\n* Perryton\n* Rain Rock\n* Toboso\n* Union Station\n* Wagram\n* Welsh Hills\n* Wilkins Run\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Licking County, Ohio\nReferences\nhttps://www.littleriverpublishing.com/home\nFurther reading\n* Thomas William Lewis, History of Southeastern Ohio and the Muskingum Valley, 1788-1928.
