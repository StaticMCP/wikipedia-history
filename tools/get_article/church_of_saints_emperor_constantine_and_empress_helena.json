The construction works were funded by the locals and supervised by Miloš Obrenović. In 1836, the construction works were finished. The first restoration of the church was in the 1850s, and an artist from the time period, Dimitrije Posniković, painted it in 1862. Authentic iconostasis were saved and remain today.\nGallery\nFile:Deo gradskog centra Ivanjice 15.jpg|''Church's porta\nFile:Ivanjica crkva 6002 01.jpg|Church from nearby park\nFile:Ivanjica crkva nocu - panoramio.jpg|Church at night''\nReferences"
