Lee. During the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, Union forces captured Fort Harrison from the Confederates on September 30. This prompted Lee to order an offensive on the right flank of the Union forces, which were under the command of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, on October 7.\nOpposing forces\nUnion\nConfederate\nBattle\nThe Union defensive lines, commanded by Brig. Gen. August V. Kautz and Maj. Gen. David B. Birney, were positioned along the length of New Market Road, with further Union cavalry defending Darbytown Road.\nThe initial Confederate attack, commanded by Maj. Gens. Robert Hoke and Charles W. Field, was successful in dislodging the Union Cavalry from Darbytown Road. The cavalry forces routed from the field, the confederates then attacked the Union defensive lines on the New Market Road. During this attack, the Confederate Texas Brigade's commander Brig. Gen. John Gregg was killed, and the attack was repulsed. The engagement resulted with a Confederate withdrawal to Richmond and thus Union victory.\nReferences\n* Kennedy, Frances H., ed., The Civil War Battlefield Guide, 2nd ed., Houghton Mifflin Co., 1998, .\n* [https://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2009/02/mary-gregg.html John Gregg's wife], Mary Francis Garth\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111117000216/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/Battles/va077.htm National Park Service battle summary]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20161010152111/https://www.nps.gov/abpp/cwsii/VirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/Darbytown%20to%20Deep%20Bottom%20I.pdf CWSAC Report Update and Resurvey:Individual Battlefield Profiles]\nNotes"
