Developed by the University of Queensland, the program's goal is to promote the ability to recognize and work with sounds in spoken language. It aims to create and strengthen awareness of the relationship between phonological awareness skills and reading and writing. The program was adapted from Auditory Discrimination in Depth (Lindamood & Lindamood, 1975), which is known as the Lindamood Phoneme Sequencing (LiPS) Program.\nIntervention description\nThe PAL introduces identification, segmentation, blending, and manipulation of speech sounds in syllables. It does not encourage reading using the whole-word approach, but instead teaches children to break written words up into individual graphemes and match letters with their corresponding phonemes before reassembling the phonemes back into words to read.\nThe manual, colored blocks, letter tiles, record sheets, a file or folder, and suitable reinforcement (stickers, stamps etc.) are required materials. Therapy should be delivered by a suitably qualified speech therapist.\nKey skills taught\nDeveloping an awareness of linguistic terms: This checks a child's understanding of literacy terminology used and teaches the child how to talk about language (metalinguistic skills).\nSound–symbol association: Determines a child's knowledge of how letters and sounds correspond, and that there can be several representations of each sound.\nBlock representation of consonant or vowel sequences: This component facilitates the child's ability to segment words into individual phonemes through developing auditory analysis skills. A single block represents an individual sound, and a row of blocks represent a string of sounds; so that the number of blocks directly correlates to the number of sounds in the sequence.\nBlock representation of syllables: Once the child understands that syllables consist of sounds, they then have to count the number of sounds, the order and distinguish between phonetic features. N.b. all block representation tasks deal only with non-words; this is to prevent the child from using pre-learned spelling patterns to respond to the tasks.\nReading and spelling non-words: This builds on previously learnt skills by using block representation to read and spell non-words. The child is encouraged to employ metalinguistic knowledge to describe changes.\nReading and spelling real words: Children learn to transfer the aforementioned foundation skills to simple or regular real words, which do not require specific spelling rules.\nComponents of therapy\nEach level consists of subsections of teaching, auditory analysis, decoding and encoding. Children progress from non-words to real words within each level, prior to commencing the next level. The design of the program ensures that the child is not exposed to more difficult tasks before acquiring the necessary skills at preceding levels.\nLevel 1 &ndash; Simple words\nThe focus of this level is to provide the ability to decode and encode CVC syllables, before applying this skill in reading and spelling. This incorporates the learning of long and short vowels in addition to consonants. Words used at this level have consistent grapheme-phoneme correspondences (GPCs).\nLevel 2 &ndash; Complex words\nConsonant clusters are introduced, in addition to application of specific rules. This includes the introduction of the soft C, the soft G, and the silent E, which may change its preceding vowel into its \"long\" vowel sound.\nLevel 3 &ndash; Multisyllabic words\nThis level builds on the previously learned abilities of segmenting and manipulating sounds by transferring these skills to syllables within multisyllabic words. It also provides specific teaching on how to break words up into syllables and the introduction of grammatical morphemes.\nAlternative interventions\n* Reading Freedom Remedial Reading Program (Calder, 1992)\n* Sounds Abound.
