Created by Tina Fey, the television series has won and been nominated for a variety of different awards during its seven season run. It received 114 Emmy Awards nominations, with 10 Emmy Award nominations for its first season alone, and a further 17 Emmy Award nominations in its second season. The show won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for its first three seasons and was nominated every year it was eligible.\nLead actress Tina Fey has been nominated for awards 27 times for her role as Liz Lemon, the head writer of the fictional television show TGS with Tracy Jordan. Fey has also been nominated eight times for her writing skills. Lead actor Alec Baldwin has been nominated 27 times for his portrayal of NBC television executive Jack Donaghy. Through its run, 30 Rock was nominated for 270 different awards, winning 68.\nDuring its run, 30 Rock was nominated for seventeen and won six Golden Globe Awards. The first award was won by Alec Baldwin in 2007, for his role of Jack Donaghy. Tina Fey won a Golden Globe for her role of Liz Lemon in 2008. In 2009, 30 Rock won all Golden Globe Awards it was nominated for, sweeping the musical or comedy television series awards for both acting and the series as a whole.\nFor the show's 2007 episodes, 30 Rock received a Peabody Award at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards. Upon announcing the award, the Peabody Board commended the show for being \"not only a great workplace comedy in the tradition of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, complete with fresh, indelible secondary characters, but also a sly, gleeful satire of corporate media, especially the network that airs it.\"\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!
