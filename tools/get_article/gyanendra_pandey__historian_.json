Racism, because that is a way of keeping subordinated and marginalized groups – sometimes called minorities – \"in their place;\" and because the assumption of the right to rule, property and 'culture' leads to the segregation and subordination of those without privileged access to these, and to their denigration, castigation and even expulsion at times when they are seen as challenging the existing order of caste and race, Black and White.\"\nSelect publications\nBooks\n* .
