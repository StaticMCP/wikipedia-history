The final was played at the Nissan Stadium, in Yokohama, Kanagawa. The stadium returned to host an Emperor's Cup final for the first time since 2014.\nThe 2022 Emperor's Cup followed a different pattern to the previous three editions of the tournament, being restored to its old, usual format, which was applied for the last time in the 2018 Emperor's Cup. It features 88 teams, representing the prefectural football associations, the J1 League, and the J2 League. Honda FC was awarded a seeded entry as the JFA's annually specially designated amateur club, in order to turn the quantity of teams in the First Round to an even number.\nUrawa Red Diamonds were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Thespakusatsu Gunma in the third round. Ventforet Kofu won their first major title over Sanfrecce Hiroshima and qualified for the 2023–24 AFC Champions League group stage.\nQualifying rounds\nAs only J1 and J2 League clubs qualify directly for the First Round, the other Emperor's Cup candidate teams (exception being made to the JFA-seeded teams), have to undergo a prefectural qualification, with regulaments and schedules varying from one association to another. In total, there are 47 prefectural cup qualifications, with the winners of each prefectural cup earning their right to play in the First Round of the Emperor's Cup. This year, a total of 2,342 teams played in the aforementioned prefectural qualifications. The following boxes shows each result of the 47 prefectural finals of the '''2022 Emperor's Cup Prefectural Qualification Cup.\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Ningineer Stadium\n|location   = Matsuyama\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Takamatsu City Eastern Sports Park\n|location   = Takamatsu\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\n|score      = cancelled\n|report     = http://jfa.jp/news/00029530/\n|team2      = J-Lease FC'\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Showa Denko Dome Oita\n|location   = Ōita\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\nParticipating clubs\nIn parentheses: the amount of times each team qualified for the Emperor's Cup (appearance in the 2022 Emperor's Cup included)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#d6e2b3; text-align:center;\"\n|   2022 J1 Leagueall clubs join in the second round\n|   2022 J2 Leagueall clubs join in the second round\n|   Amateur Best Teamjoin in the first round\n|  colspan=\"2\" | 47 prefectural tournament winnersall clubs join in the first round\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* Avispa Fukuoka (30)\n* Cerezo Osaka (53)\n* Consadole Sapporo (41)\n* Gamba Osaka (42)\n* Júbilo Iwata (45)\n* Kashima Antlers (38)\n* Kashiwa Reysol (54)\n* Kawasaki Frontale (39)\n* Kyoto Sanga FC (39)\n* Nagoya Grampus (45)\n* Sagan Tosu (30)\n* Sanfrecce Hiroshima (70)\n* Shimizu S-Pulse (30)\n* Shonan Bellmare (50)\n* FC Tokyo (28)\n* Urawa Red Diamonds (57)\n* Vissel Kobe (36)\n* Yokohama F.
