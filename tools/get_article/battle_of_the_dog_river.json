The Crusaders were led by Baldwin of Boulogne, who had been the Count of Edessa while the Turks were led by Duqaq of Damascus. The Crusaders were victorious and Baldwin was able to travel to Jerusalem unopposed in order to be crowned as the next King of Jerusalem.\nBackground\nAfter the death of Godfrey of Bouillon, the barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem invited his brother Baldwin, Count of Edessa, to assume the lordship of the Kingdom, Baldwin made preparations for the dangerous journey in order to assume the kingship. To finance his journey to Jerusalem, he seized gold and silver from his subjects. He appointed his relative, Baldwin of Le Bourcq, his successor in the county, Le Bourcq swore fealty to him. About 200 knights and 500 foot-soldiers accompanied Baldwin when he left Edessa on the 2nd October 1100.\nBattle\nThe battle was fought between the forces of Baldwin of Edessa and Turks sent by Duqaq of Damascus, who had planned to cut the latter's forces off and trap them in the narrow passage on the public road which was next to the sea. Baldwin had been warned beforehand by the qadi of Tripoli and was thus able to rout the Damascene force, successfully staging a heavy cavalry charge after a feigned retreat had lured the Turks off the high ground.\nAftermath\nAfter the victory Baldwin was able to travel safely towards Jerusalem, as the Turks who had blockaded the road had been either scattered or were killed or captured during the battle. Once Baldwin had arrived he was ceremoniously accompanied by the people of the city to the Holy Sepulchre. Baldwin was then crowned as the next King of Jerusalem. This ceremony would take place in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem on Christmas Day.\nReferences"
