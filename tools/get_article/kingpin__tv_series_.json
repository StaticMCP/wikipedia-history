The series detailed a Mexican drug trafficker named Miguel Cadena (Yancey Arias) and his family life. Low ratings and the network's discomfort with airing a show with a drug trafficker protagonist resulted in the show's cancellation. Commercials on NBC featured the song \"Más\" by the Mexican band Kinky, which also featured in the series.\nCast\n* Yancey Arias as Miguel Cadena\n* Sheryl Lee as Marlene McDillon Cadena\n* Rubén Carbajal as Joey Cadena\n* Bobby Cannavale as Chato Cadena\n* Angela Alvarado Rosa as Delia Flores\n* Brian Benben as Dr. Heywood Klein\n* Shay Roundtree as Junie Gatling\n* Neko Parham as Shawn Williams\n* Elpidia Carrillo as Lupita\n* Eduardo Palomo as Capt.
