The game has players taking on the mafia in 1931 New York City by gunning down mobsters one by one.\nVersions of the game were released for the Family Computer (1987) and MSX (1988) as  Acclaim advertised a release for the Nintendo Entertainment System in Western regions, but the console version remained exclusive to Japan.\nSeibu Kaihatsu eventually released a follow-up game, Dead Angle.\nGameplay\nThe game is set in 1931 New York City where the player controls a young FBI agent who is out to avenge his family members, who were killed in a gang shootout. Over a period of several months, he targets mobsters, culminating with the mafia boss.\nPlayers use a joystick to move a crosshair around the screen to aim and shoot at mobsters one at a time. They lurk around various areas, including on the street and in windows. An arrow appears that helps direct players to the location of the next mobster onscreen. Players have a set amount of time to find and shoot each enemy; if time is running out, a speech bubble appears counting down the last few seconds on the timer. When the timer reaches zero, the player is shot and the screen pans to the location of the enemy. A defend button is available as a last resort to avoid being shot. Players can replenish their ammo by shooting hidden ammunition boxes and get bonus points by shooting at gold bars.\nLevels are cleared after a set number of mobsters are eliminated. In the game's final level, the player has only one opportunity to assassinate the mob boss as he walks in front of windows in a building. After the final level is completed, the game loops back to the beginning.\nThe Famicom version is largely the same. The player's progress can be restored any time in the Famicom version by using a password system of four numbers and/or letters.\nReception\nIn Japan, Game Machine listed Empire City: 1931 on their August 1, 1986 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.\nA review by Clare Edgeley in Computer and Video Games said the game was \"fast moving, with lots of action\" and called it an \"unusual and addictive game\" that was  \"bound to be a winner\".\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
