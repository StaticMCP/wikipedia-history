The deputy secretary becomes acting secretary of agriculture in the event of the Secretary's resignation, death, or other inability to fulfill the duties of the position. The deputy secretary performs whatever duties are prescribed to him or her by the secretary of agriculture. The deputy secretary of agriculture is paid at level II of the Executive Schedule.\nThe position of deputy secretary of agriculture was originally called the under secretary of agriculture, until the title was changed in 1976.  Previous deputy secretaries by recency include Chuck Conner (September 2005–January 2009), Jim Moseley  (August 2001 – April 2005), Richard Rominger (May 1993 – January 2001), Ann Veneman (1991–1993), and Jack Parnell (1989–1991). On July 13, 2017, President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate Stephen Censky, the CEO of the American Soybean Association, as deputy secretary. Censky was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on October 3, 2017, and served until November, 2020. Jewel H. Bronaugh previously served as the senate-confirmed Deputy Secretary from her confirmation on May 13, 2021 until her departure in March 2023. She was the first African-American to serve as deputy secretary. Xochitl Torres Small was nominated by Joe Biden in February 2023, and served as the deputy secretary from July 2023 to January 20, 2025. In December 2020, President Trump announced that he would nominate Stephen Vaden to the role.\nTwo deputy secretaries have gone on to head the Department of Agriculture, Ann Veneman and Richard Lyng.\nList of deputy secretaries of agriculture\ndenotes Acting Deputy Secretary\n; Parties\n|Democratic|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (7)\n|Republican|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (8)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:right; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!State of residence\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!colspan=2 |President(s)\n|-\n!style=\"background: ;\" |\n|\n|John Coyle White\n|Texas\n|1977\n|December 1977\n|style=\"background: ;\" |\n|rowspan=2|Jimmy Carter\n|-\n!style=\"background: ;\" |\n|\n|Jim Williams\n|Florida\n|1979\n|January 20, 1981\n|style=\"background: ;\" |\n|-\n!style=\"background: ;\" |\n|\n|Richard Edmund Lyng\n|California\n|1981\n|January 1985\n|style=\"background: ;\" |\n|rowspan=3|Ronald Reagan\n|-\n!style=\"background: ;\" |\n|\n|John R.
