It stars Jon Hall and Christine Larsen. The story is based on events during the War of 1812 and the Battle of Tippecanoe, but contains historical inaccuracies, mainly in that Tecumseh is depicted as siding with the Americans and not the British.\nPlot\nIn the Indiana Territory of the early 19th century, conflict arises between the United States and Great Britain over territory and boundaries. Each side endeavors to gain the support of the Shawnee Indian tribes in the area. Governor William Henry Harrison enlists the aid of Steve Ruddell, whose friendship with the Shawnee chief Tecumseh goes back to childhood.\nTecumseh's leadership of the Shawnee is contested by his brother Tenskwatawa, known as The Prophet, who sides with the British. Tecumseh, who grew up as a childhood playmate of Steve and of Laura McGregor, loves Steve as a brother and hopes to marry Laura. But Laura is in love with Steve. Laura's father, Shayne McGregor, secretly leads local support for the British against the Americans, even though it risks the life and love of his daughter. Everything comes to a head at the Battle of Tippecanoe.\nCast\n* Jon Hall as Steve Ruddell\n* Christine Larson as Laura MacGregor\n* Jay Silverheels as Tecumseh\n* Michael Ansara as Tenskwatawa, \"The Prophet\"\n* Harry Cording as Shayne MacGregor\n* James Seay as Gov.
