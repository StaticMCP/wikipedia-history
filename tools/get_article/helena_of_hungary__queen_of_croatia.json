They had a son named Radovan, who died in his late teens or early twenties, and daughters named Claudia and Vinica.\nHelen had excellent family connections, being an aunt to Irene, the mother of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos.\nHelen was very popular with the Croats, and they often called her Jelena Lijepa (\"Helen the Beautiful\"). She is thought to have been an influential consort.\nUpon the death of Zvonimir, Helen was said to have been quietly plotting the inheritance of the Croatian Crown for her brother, the King of Hungary. This situation caused a decade of war and instability in the kingdom, resulting in the personal union of Croatia and Hungary that lasted until 1918. Helen died around 1091.\nExternal links\n*[http://members.tripod.com/royalcroatia/zvonimir.htm Dmitar Zvonimir and Helen]\n|-\nNotes"
