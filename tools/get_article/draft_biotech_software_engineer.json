These engineers design, develop, and maintain software systems that enable research, diagnostics, and production in biotechnology fields such as genomics, proteomics, drug discovery, and bioprocess automation.\nCore responsibilities and subroles\nBiotech software engineers bridge the gap between laboratory science and computational infrastructure. Common subroles include:\n;Bioinformatics software engineer\n:Develops pipelines and algorithms for DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, genome assembly, variant calling, and annotation; works with formats such as FASTQ, BAM/CRAM, and VCF; and builds reproducible workflows.\n;Bioprocess automation engineer\n:Designs control, monitoring, and data integration software for fermentation and cell-culture processes; integrates sensors, historians, and MES/LIMS; implements traceability and compliance (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11, GxP).\n;AI/ML engineer in biotechnology\n:Builds predictive models for target discovery, molecular docking, ADMET, image analysis, and omics integration; develops data pipelines and model serving infrastructure.\n;Simulation and modeling engineer\n:Creates software for molecular dynamics, protein folding, and systems/synthetic biology models; accelerates workloads on GPUs and HPC clusters.\n;BioAI software engineer\n:Applies foundation models and modern AI to biological sequences, structures, images, and text. Typical focus areas include protein/RNA language models, structure prediction, generative design (proteins, antibodies, small molecules), multimodal omics integration, and LLM tooling for lab workflows.\nCompetencies and technologies by subrole\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
