He failed to play a single game in that campaign. However, he did feature heavily in the club's youth team for that season, even coming on in the 58' against Gold Coast United during the A-League National Youth League Grand Final on 20 March 2010.\nSince leaving Perth, Fondyke has been trialling in Scotland with Scottish Premier League club St.Mirren, as well as newly promoted First Division side Ayr United, in the hope he will be signed for the upcoming 2010–11 Season.\nA-League career statistics\n(Correct as of 21 March 2011)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"2\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Finals\n!colspan=\"2\"|Asia\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\"|Perth Glory\n|2009–10\n|0||0||0||0||–||–||0||0\n|-\n|2010–11\n|14||0||–||–||–||–||14||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!14!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0\n!14!!0\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110217024302/http://perthglory.com.au/default.aspx?s=aleague_profile&pid=1715&tid=1 Perth Glory profile]"
