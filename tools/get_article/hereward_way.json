Stations towards the centre of the path are located at Shippea Hill and Ely.\nThe footpath runs through Stamford, Peterborough, March, Ely and Brandon. It also goes through Thetford Forest. It links two other long-distance footpaths: the Viking Way in the west and Peddars Way in the east.\nIn August 2006, the Hereward Way between Wansford and Southorpe near Peterborough was diverted under a Peterborough City Council improvement plan. The re-routing was complete with the Peterborough Local Access Forum and means that walkers do not pass alongside the A47.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.go4awalk.com/userpics/sharahiggins27.php Go 4 a walk]\n*[http://www.britishwalks.org/walks/2002/207.php British walks]\n*[http://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Hereward+Way LDWA]"
