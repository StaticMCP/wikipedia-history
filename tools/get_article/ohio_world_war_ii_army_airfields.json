However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC)) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nArmy Air Force Training Command\n* Bricker APT, Bowling Green\n: Contract Primary Flying Instruction\n: Now: Wood County Airport\n* Lockbourne AAB, Columbus\n: 374th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Lockbourne Air Force Base (1948-1974)\n: Was: Rickenbacker Air Force Base (1974-1980)\n: Now:  Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base (1980-Present)\n: Also: Rickenbacker International Airport  (1994-Pres)\n: Eastern Flight Training Center\n:: Kenton County Airport, Covington, Kentucky\n:: Sub-base of Lockbourne AAB\n:: Now: Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport\nAir Transport Command\n* Lunken APT, Cincinnati\n: Joint use USAAF–Navy–Civil airfield\n: Now: Cincinnati Municipal Lunken Airport\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Cleveland MAP, Cleveland\n: Aircraft assembly and modification facilities\n: Now: Cleveland Hopkins International Airport\n* Patterson Field AAF, Fairborn\n: 478th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Merged 1948 with Wright Field AAF\n* Wright Field, AAF, Dayton\n: Merged 1948 with Patterson Field\n: Now:  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (1948-Pres)\n:* Dayton AAF, Dayton\n:: Sub-base of Wright Field AAF\n:: Joint use USAAF/Navy/Civil Airfield\n:: Now: Dayton International Airport\n:* Clinton County AAF, Wilmington, Ohio\n:: Sub-base of Wright Field AAF\n:: Glider Training\n:: Was: Clinton County Air Force Base (1947-1972)\n:: Now: Airborne Airpark\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
