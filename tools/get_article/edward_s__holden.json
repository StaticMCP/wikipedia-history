From 1862 to 1866, he attended Washington University in St. Louis, where he obtained a B.S. degree.  He later trained at West Point in the class of 1870.\nCareer\nIn 1873 he became professor of mathematics at the US Naval Observatory, where he made a favorable impression on Simon Newcomb. On August 28, 1877, a few days after Asaph Hall discovered the moons of Mars Deimos and Phobos,  he claimed to have found a third satellite of Mars. Further analysis showed large mistakes in his observations.\nHe was director of Washburn Observatory at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1881 to 1885. He was elected a member of both the American National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1885. He discovered a total of 22 NGC objects during his work at Washburn Observatory.\nHolden was president of the University of California from 1885 until 1888, and the first director of the Lick Observatory from 1888 until the end of 1897. He resigned as a result of internal dissent over his management among his subordinates. While at the Lick Observatory, he was the founder of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and its first president (1889–1891). He also became a member of the American Philosophical Society. Holden was awarded five honorary degrees: an M.A. degree from Washington University in 1879,\nan LL.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1886, an LL.D. from Columbia University in 1887, a Sc.D. from the University of the Pacific in 1896 and a Litt.D. from Fordham College in 1910.\nIn 1901, Holden became the librarian of the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he remained until his death. He was buried at the West Point Cemetery on March 18, 1914.\nWorks\nHe wrote many books on popular science (and on other subjects, such as flags and heraldry), including science books intended for children, for example:\n*\n* On the Mughal Emperors.\n* Real Things In Nature. A Reading Book of Science for American Boys and Girls, 1916.\nLegacy\nHolden was a founding member of the Cosmos Club.\nThe asteroid 872 Holda, the crater Holden on the Moon and the crater Holden on Mars are all named in his honor.\nFamily\nHis cousin George Phillips Bond was director of Harvard College Observatory. His grandson, also named Edward Singleton Holden, was a well known inventor with numerous patents to his name. He is credited with designing the rolled stainless steel gauge present in most modern fire extinguishers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/overview/presidents/#holden University of California Presidents' biographies]\n* [http://www.astrosociety.org/about/history.html ASP: Centennial History of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific] at www.astrosociety.org Bracher, Katherine: The Centennial History of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (Mercury Magazine, Sept/Oct 1989)\n* [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1984JHA....15...81O Osterbrock, Donald E., The Rise and Fall of Edward S.
