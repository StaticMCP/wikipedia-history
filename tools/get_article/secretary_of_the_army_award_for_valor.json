The equivalent military decoration for this award is the Soldier's Medal.\nCriteria\nTo qualify for this award, an individual must have demonstrated exceptional courage or made significant sacrifices involving heroism or bravery. The act performed must be voluntary and go beyond the normal call of duty. It can be recognized if it is associated with an Army employee or activity, or if the Army benefits in some manner from the act. The award is reserved for acknowledging singular acts of heroism or bravery and is not conferred for participation in conflicts with an armed enemy. The situation must have entailed personal risk or danger and a voluntary willingness to put one's life in jeopardy. Awards are not granted solely for saving a life.\nAppearance\nThe medal  is gold in color and  in diameter. The obverse depicts a five pointed star on top of a laurel wreath.  At the top of the medal is inscribed \"VALOR\".  The reverse of the medal has a small laurel wreath under a rectangular plate for engraving the recipient's name. The words “AWARDED TO” are inscribed above and parallel to the name plate.  Below the plate are the words “FOR EXHIBITING BRAVERY”.  The medal is suspended from a ribbon , in width in red. In the center of the ribbon are five stripes of blue, separated by four stripes of white, the center blue stripe being wider than the others. This award has a neck drape or neck ribbon, similar to that of the Medal of Honor, and therefore is worn by the recipient in formal attire around the neck as the Medal of Honor. These are two of the four U.S. awards that are authorized a neck ribbon, the other ones being the commander-degree Legion of Merit and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nKnown recipients\n* James P.
