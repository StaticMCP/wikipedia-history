It shows an amazonomachy, i.e. a mythological battle between the ancient Greeks and the Amazons, a nation of all-female warriors.\nThe work by Rubens shows his huge admiration for Leonardo da Vinci's Battle of Anghiari, of which he owned a copy which he had touched up. It is in the collection of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.\nThis painting was formerly in the collection of Cornelis van der Geest and can be seen in two paintings of his art gallery in the 1630s by Willem van Haecht.\nFile:Willem van Haecht (II) - Apelles painting Campaspe - 2.jpg|Apelles painting Campaspe, 1630\nFile:Willem van Haecht - The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest, 1628.jpg|The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest, 1628\nNotes"
