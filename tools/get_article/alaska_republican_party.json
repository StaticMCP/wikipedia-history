Republican presidential nominees have won Alaska in recent elections; the last and only Democrat to carry Alaska was Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.\nHistory\nwas the first Governor of the District of Alaska (1884 to 1885).]]\nThe Alaska Republican Party originates from Alaska's first district governor. Once Alaska was granted the status of United States District civilian leadership could be appointed by the current president of the United States. President Chester A. Arthur appointed Alaska's first territorial governor. He was a Republican named John Henry Kinkead.\nMartha Ried of Petersberg was the Chair of the Republican Party of Alaska.\nAlaska Republicans as a party organization can trace their origin to Alaska's first legislature in 1913.\nAfter Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski voted to impeach Donald Trump over his role in inciting a pro-Trump mob to attack the U.S. Capitol, the Alaska Republican Party censured her, called for her resignation, and endorsed challenger Kelly Tshibaka against her in the Republican primary in 2022.\nOrganization\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
