In 1885, her mystery novel The House on the Marsh (1884) was turned into a play, in which she played the lead. However, Augustus Moore later complained that he had done most of the work of writing the play, but had not been credited, while Charles Percy claimed the plot had been stolen from him.\nIn 1887, at St Pancras, Warden married George Edward James, an actor. She continued to write novels, but she gave up her acting career. One of her sisters also became a writer, adopting the name Gertrude Warden.\nWith her husband, Warden had two sons, Godfrey Warden James, born at St Pancras in 1888, and Rupert Warden, born at Ramsgate in 1893; and two daughters, Leslie Gertrude, born in London in 1890, and Olivia Mary, born in Ramsgate, Kent, in 1891.\nShe lived in Kent for many years, at Ramsgate and later Sandgate.\nFlorence Warden became a writer of stories for The Gentlewoman, a new magazine established in 1890, and on 15 December 1891 The Times reported that the Christmas number had\nIn 1911, Warden, her husband, and her two daughters were living together in three rooms in Maida Vale, when G. E. James was described as an actor, Warden as a writer, and their daughters as music students. Her attempts to reignite her career as a playwright were unsuccessful.\nIn 1920, The House on the Marsh was turned into a silent movie, The House on the Marsh.\nAfter her death in 1929, Warden was buried as Florence James in the Brompton Cemetery.\nChildren\nWarden’s son Godfrey Warden James (1888–1963), was educated at Oxford, trained as a barrister, worked as a schoolmaster and tutor and as an Administrative Officer in Sierre Leone, and was also a novelist, using the name Adam Broome. When he died in 1963, he was living at Woking and left a modest estate valued at £5,342, .\nWarden's son Rupert Warden James (1893-1965) was a sea cadet at the Thames Nautical Training College (HMS Worcester) in the 1911 census.
