NFL Network analyst and NBC commentator Mike Mayock considered him the best football player in the draft.

The Titans finished with a league-worst 2–14 record. Despite this, Pro Football Focus rated him positively in six consecutive games beginning with the Week 11 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
