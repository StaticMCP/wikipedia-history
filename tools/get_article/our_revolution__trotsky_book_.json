      "text": "# Our Revolution (Trotsky book)\n\nOur Revolution () is a book by Leon Trotsky, published in 1906. Its final article, \"Results and Prospects\" (), became the most important and famous part of the work. In the book, Trotsky completed formation of his concept of \"permanent revolution\" and \"the law of uneven and combined development\". It blamed the failure of the 1905 Russian Revolution on the inability of the bourgeoisie to lead a liberal democratic revolution, and as such indicated the beginning of Trotsky's ideological shift from the Mensheviks to the Bolsheviks.\nReferences\nLiterature\n* Knei-Paz B.
