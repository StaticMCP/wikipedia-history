Previously, he played college basketball with the Butler Bulldogs. He helped lead the 2009–10 and 2010–11 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball teams to the championship game of the NCAA tournament.\nHe is a three-time Academic All-American and the 2011 Men's Basketball Academic All-America of the Year as well as the 2009 Horizon League Men's Basketball Player of the Year. He was a 2009 All-American honorable mention by the Associated Press.  He was the 2010 and 2011 Horizon League men's basketball tournament MVP as well as a four-time Horizon League men's basketball tournament All-Tournament selection. He won the 2011 Lou Henson Award as well as the 2010 & 2011 Elite 88 Awards. He is the Horizon League record-holder for career free throws made and attempted.\nHigh school\nThe 6' 8\" Howard finished his high school career as the leading scorer and rebounder in Connersville history. As a senior in 2006–07, he averaged 23.6 points and 14.4 rebounds per game after averaging 19.1 points and 10.6 rebounds as a junior. He led the state of Indiana in rebounding as a high school senior in 2006–07 while playing for Connersville High School. Howard ranked second in the state in blocked shots as a junior. Howard is regarded as the first top-100 recruit in the history of Butler.\nCollege career\nAs a freshman, Howard was the Horizon League newcomer of the year. That year, he was prominent in the 2007–08 Bulldogs's first round victory in the  2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament over South Alabama.  As a junior, he helped the 2009–10 Bulldogs make it to the championship game of the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In February of the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, Howard was hit by an elbow that caused extensive bleeding on his face. In the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, he scored a tipin as time expired to give Butler a 60–58 victory over Old Dominion in their second-round game.  Then in the third round, he made the winning free throw with 0.8 seconds left to clinch a 71–70 victory over the number-one seeded Pittsburgh Panthers.  Although Howard made only 5 three point shots in his first three seasons, as a senior he developed an outside shot, making over 40% on over 100 attempts.\nHe earned Academic All-American selection in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and was named the 2011 Men's Basketball Academic All-America of the Year as well as the 2009 Horizon League Men's Basketball Player of the Year. He was a 2009 All-American honorable mention by the Associated Press.  By helping Butler earn consecutive trips to the final four, Howard earned consecutive Elite 88 Awards in 2010 and 2011. He was also one of ten finalists for the 2011 men's basketball Lowe's Senior CLASS Award.\nIn 2010, he was chosen as \"honorable mention\" in a list of the smartest athletes in sports by Sporting News.\nDuring the 2010 Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament he earned the MVP Award.  Then, during the 2011 Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament he repeated as MVP and became the first person to become a four-time Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament All-Tournament selection. He won the 2011 Lou Henson Award as the mid-major player of the year. Howard was the 2007–8 Horizon League Newcomer of the Year. He was a second team All-Horizon League selection that year and first team selection the following three seasons. He was a Horizon League All-Defensive Team selection as a sophomore and a senior. He holds the Horizon League records for most free throws made and attempted (both league only and all games). He led the Horizon League in field goal percentage as a sophomore with a 55.0 average.\nCollege statistics\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2007–08\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Butler\n| 34 || 25 || 24.5 || .583 || .000 ||.780 ||  5.50 || 0.85 || 0.71 || 1.09 || 12.26\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2008–09\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Butler\n| 32 || 32 || 28.2 || .550 || .222 || .773 || 6.75 || 1.12 || 0.78 || 1.50 || 14.84\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2009–10\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Butler\n| 38 || 38 || 25.2 || .479 || .273 || .784 || 5.16 || 0.79 || 0.58 || 0.61 || 11.50\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2010–11\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Butler\n| 37 || 37 || 31.0 || .471 || .398 || .792 || 7.76 || 1.43 || 1.14 || 0.62 || 16.43\nSource: [https://basketball.realgm.com/player/Matt-Howard/Summary/15393]\nProfessional career\nOn July 28, 2011, Howard signed with Olympiacos of the Greek League.

Howard's teammate Shelvin Mack told Reilly that Howard had six pairs of new shoes in his locker, but refused to wear them, preferring to stay with what Mack described as \"ratty old ones\". Howard also habitually rode a rusted-out bicycle to Butler's 6:00 am practices, regardless of the weather; during one 2011 ice storm, the handlebars bent under him while he was riding, causing him to fall onto the ice. He would say about this incident, \"I fixed it. Just poured some WD-40 in there and bent them back. It's a little risky to ride, I guess, but I can't see buying a new one.\" He also has a habit of spoonerism with people's names; for example, he routinely calls Mack \"Melvin Shack\".\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.euroleague.net/competition/players/showplayer?pcode=003416&clubcode=OLY&seasoncode=e2011 Euroleague.net profile]\n*[http://www.lnb.fr/fr/Pro-A/200006/Joueurs/A55632/Matt-Howard French League profile]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160404041940/http://esake.gr/main/index.php?pl=12&lng=en&pfpar=cGxheWVyaWQ9MTk5OA== Greek Basket League profile]\n*[http://www.eurobasket.com/player.asp?Cntry=GRE&PlayerID=135391 Eurobasket.com profile]\n*[http://butlersports.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/howard_matt00.html Howard's Official Bio] from Butler University"
