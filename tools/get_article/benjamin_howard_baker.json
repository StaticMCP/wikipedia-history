He played for the \"Amateurs\" in the 1925 FA Charity Shield. He was also an international-level water polo goalkeeper. Baker initially played as a defender and took the keeper position after his ankle was damaged in a naval mine sweeping operation during World War I.\nIn tennis singles, doubles and mixed doubles, Baker competed in the 1929 Northern Qualifying Tournament for Wimbledon without making the main draw in any event and won the 1932 Welsh Covered Courts tennis competition.\nIndividually, Baker held British records in the high jump (1.95 m, from 1921 to 1946) and triple jump. Baker became the National high jump champion for the first time after winning the AAA Championships title at the 1910 AAA Championships. He would go on to be the British champion from 1910 through to 1921, by virtue of either winning the AAA title or being the best placed British athlete in the event. His outright successes came in 1910, 1912, 1913, 1919, 1920 and 1921.\nBaker competed in jump events at the 1912 and 1920 Olympic Games and finished in 6–11th places. At the Northern Counties Championships he won the high jump (1911–14, 1919–21), 120 yd hurdles (1921) and discus throw (1920); he also won the long jump at the 1920 Northern Olympic Trials. After retiring from sports, Baker joined the family firm that produces soap and chemicals and became a renowned businessman in the Liverpool area.\nAlthough Baker was sometimes known as Benjamin Howard-Baker (such as in 'Play Up Corinth - A history of the Corinthian Football Club') his baptism record at St Margaret, Anfield on 28 March 1892 shows his Christian names as 'Benjamin Howard', and his surname as 'Baker'. His father had the same name.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080514092221/http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=48 England profile]\n*[http://www.evertonfc.com/stats/?mode=player_details&player_id=332 Everton Football Club profile]\n*[http://stamford-bridge.com/player.php?id=19&surname=Baker&firstname=Benjamin%20Howard Chelsea Football Club profile]\n*"
