Rovers finished fourth in the First Division in 1901–02, with Swarbrick playing 15 league games. He then joined Brentford, a club struggling in the Southern League, before signing with Grimsby Town of the Football League Second Division. He played 67 league games for the \"Mariners\", scoring 12 goals, before moving on to Oldham Athletic in 1907. He played for Oldham in 1907–08, their first Football League campaign, in which they posted a third-place finish, just two points behind the promotion places. He scored twice in four league games for Oldham before moving on to Southport Central, a return to Brentford and then Stoke. He made three appearances in the Birmingham & District League for the \"Potters\" in 1910–11. After leaving the Victoria Ground he joined rivals Port Vale, and was a regular in the Central League side that lifted the Staffordshire Senior Cup in 1912. In 1912 he transferred to Swansea Town.\nStyle of play\nSwarbrick was a talented and pacey dribbler.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA CupWelsh Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Blackburn Rovers||1901–02||First Division||2||0||0||0||2||0\n|-\n|1902–03||First Division||13||0||1||0||14||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!15!!0!!1!!0!!16!!0\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Brentford\n|1903–04\n|Southern League First Division\n|9\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|9\n|1\n|-\n|1904–05\n|Southern League First Division\n|10\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|12\n|0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!19!!1!!2!!0!!21!!1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Grimsby Town||1905–06||Second Division||33||4||1||0||34||4\n|-\n|1906–07||Second Division||34||8||2||0||36||8\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!67!!18!!3!!0!!70!!12\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Oldham Athletic||1907–08||Second Division||3||2||0||0||3||2\n|-\n|1908–09||Second Division||1||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!4!!2!!0!!0!!4!!2\n|-\n|Southport Central||1909–10||Lancashire Combination Division One||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|Stoke||1910–11||Birmingham & District League / Southern League Second Division||3||0||0||0||3||0\n|-\n|Port Vale||1911–12||Central League||22||3||0||0||22||3\n|-\n|Swansea Town||1912–13||Southern League Second Division\n|22||0||9||2||31||2\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!152!!18!!15!!4!!167!!22\n|}\nHonours\nPort Vale\n*Staffordshire Senior Cup: 1912\nReferences"
