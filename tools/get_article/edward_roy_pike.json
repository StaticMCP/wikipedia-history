He later performed some of the first experiments in photon statistics, leading to a new field of statistical optical spectroscopy.  Commercial exploitation has achieved worldwide sales of ‘Malvern’ photon-correlation equipment.\nHe was a Fellow of the Royal Society,  Clerk Maxwell Professor of Theoretical Physics at King's College, London, U.K and a recipient of the MacRobert Award for engineering innovation among many other acknowledgements of his work.\nLife and career\nRoy Pike was born in Perth, Australia on 4 December 1929, his parents having emigrated there a few years earlier. They returned to the U.K two years later, to Oxford, where he later attended  Southfield Grammar School.\nHe joined the Royals Corps of Signals in 1948, to fulfil his National Service and served as General Montgomery’s Radio Engineer in SHAPE Headquarters in Fontainebleau, France.\nHe then went to University College Cardiff, in Wales, where he gained B.Sc degrees in both Mathematics and Physics. He remained at Cardiff to obtain his Ph.D. in X-ray diffraction.\nOn gaining his Ph.D. He took up a Fulbright Scholarship to become a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Boston, U.S.A.\nAfter his return to the U.K in 1960, he joined the Ministry of Defence (M.O.D) as a Scientific Officer in the theoretical physics group at the Royal Radar Establishment (later Royal Signals and Radar Establishment ) in Malvern, Worcestershire, U.K. It was at Malvern that Pike and his group developed the new field of statistical optical spectroscopy.\nStatistical optical spectroscopy refers to the application of statistical and computational methods to interpret and analyse data from various optical spectroscopy techniques, including photon correlation spectroscopy, in which single particles of light from a laser are detected after being scattered from very small particles. This enables the measurement of the size of the particles, or the speed at which they are moving. His research ranged from measurements of wind tunnel supersonic velocities, molecular parameters of colloids, proteins and viruses and sound waves in liquid helium to super-resolving optical microscopy.\nThe photon correlation techniques developed have been commercialised and enables automated, non-destructive analysis for applications such as material identification, medical diagnostics, and food authentication.\nIn 1986 he retired from the M.O.D to take up the chair of Clerk Maxwell Professor of Theoretical Physics at King's College, London, U.K.\nAt King’s he tackled the more general cases of inverse problems (of which photon correlation is an application), working on speech acoustics and antenna theory.\nHe continued his work at King’s until his retirement in 2019. Pike died on July 24, 2025, at the age of 95.\nPublications\nHe was co-author with Sarben Sarkar of The Quantum Theory of Radiation (Clarendon Press, 1995).\nHe was editor or joint editor of the following:\n* Photon Correlation and Light Beating Spectroscopy (joint editor, 1974)\n* High Power Gas Lasers (editor, 1975)\n* Photon Correlation Spectroscopy and Velocimetry (joint editor, 1977)\n* Frontiers in Quantum Optics (joint editor, 1986)\n* Chaos, Noise and Fractals (joint editor, 1987)\n* Quantum Measurement and Chaos (joint editor, 1987)\n* Squeezed and Non-classical Light (joint editor, 1988)\n* Photons and Quantum Fluctuations (joint editor, 1988)\n* Inverse Problems in Scattering and Imaging (joint editor, 1991)\n* Photon Correlation and Light Scattering Spectroscopy (joint editor, 1997)\n* Scattering (joint editor, 2002)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/edward-pike%28d7d6da1a-8dc5-4566-9be0-8ac8ad568375%29.html KCL research portal]"
