Andrew Keith, William H. Keith, and Lawrence Schick for Traveller, and published in tête-bêche format by Game Designers' Workshop in 1982.\nPlot summary\nDivine Intervention/Night of Conquest is a double adventure in which the player characters must trick the ruler of a religious dictatorship located in the Spinward Marches, and a group of traders are caught up in an attack on a trading planet in the Reavers' Deep Sector.\nReception\nWilliam A. Barton reviewed Divine Intervention/Night of Conquest in The Space Gamer No. 59. Barton commented that \"both adventures should give referees and players at least one good session of Traveller play each, though Night of Conquest is unquestionably the stronger of the two.\"\nAndy Slack reviewed Night of Conquest/Divine Intervention for White Dwarf #39, giving it an overall rating of 9 out of 10, and stated that \"Double Adventure 6 is one (or rather two) of the classic Traveller scenarios.\"\nSee also\nClassic Traveller Double Adventures\nReferences"
