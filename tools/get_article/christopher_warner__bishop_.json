He is the second bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Mid-Atlantic (DOMA), prior to which he served as a priest in the Anglican Diocese of South Carolina.\nEarly life, education, and family\nWarner was born in 1969 in Pueblo, Colorado. He was baptized in the Catholic Church but did not grow up attending church. In high school and college, Warner became a Deadhead and followed the Grateful Dead on East Coast tours. He has said that he became fearful of demonic presences at Grateful Dead concerts. During a Dead concert at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., Warner left the stadium and prayed for conversion.\nWarner graduated from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington in 1991. After college, he began discernment for ordained ministry and served as a youth pastor at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Charlotte. In 1993, he married his wife, Catherine, and they have three adult children. In 1997, after working in the financial sector at Bank of America and Broadway and Seymour, Warner enrolled in Trinity School for Ministry.\nOrdained ministry\nPittsburgh Bishop Robert Duncan ordained Warner to the diaconate in 2000 upon his graduation from Trinity. He was ordained to the priesthood the following year. He served from 2000 to 2002 as curate at Trinity Episcopal Church in Columbus, Georgia. From 2002 to 2007, he was associate rector at the Church of the Holy Cross in Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, where he developed a men's hiking ministry that has expanded throughout the Diocese of South Carolina and assisted with the launch of a second campus in Daniel Island.\nIn 2007, Warner was appointed rector of St. Christopher Camp and Conference Center on Seabrook Island. The camp is a 300-acre retreat center then owned by the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina. The role included spiritual oversight of the camp and conference center programs (including summer camps, a barrier island environmental education program and diocesan and church conferences) plus oversight of 60 employees. He chose to leave St. Christopher's in 2011. With the rift between the Diocese of South Carolina and the Episcopal Church portending future litigation over diocesan properties, Warner has said that \"[n]ecessarily, St. Christopher would be stewarded through management rather than visionary growth. After much prayer, I realized my gift mix was better suited elsewhere.\" (In 2022, St. Christopher's was returned to the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina under a final settlement.)\nWarner returned to Holy Cross as an associate priest and in 2015 was appointed rector of the multisite congregation with a ministry staff of 22 plus two preschool programs at its two campuses. During his rectorate, Holy Cross paid down $1.5 million in building debt from prior expansions. He also shifted Holy Cross from a \"seeker-sensitive\" model to a \"relational and discipleship model\" for church life.\nIn the late 2010s, Warner has said that he was encouraged to consider episcopal ministry by Anglican Network in Canada Suffragan Bishop Trevor Walters and Bishop Mark Lawrence. He was a finalist in the election for the 15th bishop of South Carolina in which Chip Edgar was elected. In October 2022, Warner was elected the second bishop of the Diocese of the Mid-Atlantic to succeed John Guernsey. Following consent from the ACNA College of Bishops, Warner was consecrated as a bishop by Foley Beach and 25 other ACNA bishops on February 18, 2023, at the Falls Church Anglican. During the same service, he was invested as the diocese's second bishop.\nIn September 2023, Warner ordered an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against a youth minister who had been employed by The Falls Church Episcopal in the 1990s and early 2000s. The independent inquiry concluded that the youth minister “engaged in sexual abuse of students who participated in the youth program while he was employed.” At the conclusion of the investigation, Warner took the unusual step of publicly announcing that he had issued \"Godly Admonitions\" against the former and current rectors of The Falls Church Anglican, criticizing them for failing to investigate the allegations when first informed.\nIn October 2025, The Washington Post reported that an ecclesiastical presentment had been issued against the archbishop of the ACNA, Steve Wood, who was being accused of forcibly touching and attempting to kiss a female staff member in his office, of improperly paying her thousands of dollars in church funds, of bullying and disparaging colleagues, and of plagiarism. The misconduct was alleged to have occurred at St. Andrew’s Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where Wood was the longtime rector. On October 23, Warner responded with a statement calling it \"disheartening\" that the allegations had been shared with the Post and expressing confidence in the ACNA Provincial Office: \"I’m confident that the ACNA is taking this seriously . . . and does not hesitate to take action when action is warranted.\"\nHowever, in November 2025, the Washington Post revealed that Warner had been one of four bishops initially approached about the allegations. Warner acknowledged that the complainants had shared the draft presentment against Wood with him months before speaking to the Post and that he had declined to endorse or read the document, instead referring them to a reporting channel managed by Wood's staff because, in Warner's words, \"there are women in that process.\" Warner also encouraged them to wait a year or more until a new disciplinary process was set to be adopted.\nOn November 16, Warner sent an email to the clergy of DOMA, offering an apology to the women in his diocese and the women who had made allegations against Wood: \"I recognize that women’s experiences are too often overlooked or minimized, particularly in systems led by men.\" He concluded the email by sharing that he had recently called for an inhibition of Wood.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.anglicandoma.org/meet-the-bishop Profile on Anglican Diocese of the Mid-Atlantic website]"
