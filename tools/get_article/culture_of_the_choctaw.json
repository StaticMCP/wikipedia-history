The Choctaws, or Chahtas, are a Native American people originally from the Southeastern United States. They were known for their rapid incorporation of modernity, developing a written language, transitioning to yeoman farming methods, and having European-American and African Americans lifestyles enforced in their society. The Choctaw culture has its roots in the Mississippian culture era of the mound builders.\nClans\nWithin the Choctaws were two distinct moieties: Imoklashas (elders) and Inhulalatas (youth). Each moiety had several clans or Iksas, it is estimated there were about 12 Iksas altogether. Identity was established first by Moiety and Iksa, so a Choctaw identified himself first as his Iksa, for example Imoklasha or Inhulata, and second as Choctaw. Children belonged to the Iksa of their mother meaning they are matrilineal. The following were some major districts:\n*Okla Hannalli (people of six towns)\n*Okla Tannap (people from the other side)\n*Okla Fayala (people who are widely dispersed)\nJohn Swanton writes \"there are only the faintest traces of groups with truly totemic designations, the animal and plant names which occur seeming not to have had a totemic connotation.\" Swanton also adds 'Adam Hodgson ... who \"spoke English very well,\" told ... \"that there were tribes or families among the Indians, somewhat similar to the Scottish clans; such as, the Panther family, the Bird family, Raccoon Family, the Wolf family.\"' The following are possible totemic clan designations:\n}}\nThe evil spirit, or Na-lusa-chi-to (\"black being\" or \"big black one\") or Impashilup (\"soul eater\" or \"ghost eater\"), sought to harm people. It may appear, as told in stories, in the form of a shadow person.\nPrayers may have been introduced by missionaries; however, Choctaw prophets were known to address the Sun. Swanton writes, \"an old Choctaw informed Wright that, before the arrival of the missionaries, they had no conception of prayer. However, he adds, 'I have indeed heard it asserted by some, that anciently their hopaii, or prophets, on some occasions were accustomed to address the sun ...'\"\nMythology\nThe Choctaw have many stories about little people. Swanton states of Halbert, \"the Choctaws in Mississippi say that there is a little man, about two feet high, that dwells in the thick woods and is solitary in his habits ... he often playfully throws sticks and stones at the people ... the Indian's doctors say that Bohpoli [thrower] assists them in the manufacture of their medicines ...\" The little people are said to take young children to the forest to teach them how to be medicine men.\nThe will-o'-the-wisp was called \"night-mare\" by the Indians and was believed to plait up the tails of horses during the night and to ride them about until they could hardly be used next day and many died from the effects.\nStories\nThe Choctaw practiced Head Flattening, but it fell out of favor. This 1840s painting presents [[Chinookans, a Native American Northwestern tribe.]]\nStorytelling is a popular part of entertainment and history in many Native American societies. In addition, many stories were used to convey important morals and values. This stood also true for the Choctaws. Stories would recount their origins and would retell the deeds of heroes long gone. There are also stories about possums, raccoons, turtles, birds, chipmunks, and wolves. Randy Jimmie and Leonard Jimmie state,\n}}\nOne such story of forest animals is about a possum and raccoon. Randy Jimmie and Leonard Jimmie tells,\nEthnobotany\nPseudognaphalium obtusifolium ssp. obtusifolium is made into a decoction of leaves and blossoms and taken for lung pain and colds.\nWarfare\nChoctaw warfare had many customs associated with it. Before war was declared a council was held to discuss the matter which would last about eight days. Swanton writes on Bossu's account, \"The Chactas love war and have some good methods of making it. They never fight standing fixedly in one place; they flit about; they heap contempt upon their enemies without at the same time being braggarts, for when they come to grips they fight with much coolness ...\" Superstition was a part of Choctaw warfare. Swanton says, \"The Chactas are extremely superstitious. When they are about to go to war they consult their Manitou, which is carried by the chief.  They always exhibit it on that side where they are going to march toward the enemy, the warriors standing guard about ...\"\nAllen Wright, a scholar who compiled a Choctaw dictionary, is credited with creating the state name Red People or Oklahoma. Wright attended Union Theological Seminary in New York City and obtained a Master of Arts in 1855, the first Native American in Indian Territory to do so.\nWhen the Choctaw capture an enemy, he or she was displayed as a war trophy. Swanton writes of what Roman wrote, \"they never exercised so much cruelty upon their captive enemies as the other savages; they almost always brought them home to shew them, and then dispatched them with a bullet or hatchet; after which, the body being cut into many parts, and all the hairy pieces of skin converted into scalps, the remainder is buried and the above trophies carried home, where the women dance with them till tired; then they are exposed on the tops of the hot houses till they are annihilated ...\"\nFor some societies, the practice of decapitation was considered an honor. This practice seems to be true for the Choctaw of Oskelagna. A fallen Choctaw warrior's head was brought back after a battle. Swanton says of De Lusser (1730), \"there was one who brought the head of one of their people who had been killed. He threw it at my feet telling me that he was a warrior who had lost his life for the French and that it was well to weep for his death ...\"\nLanguage\nThe Choctaw language is a member of the Muskogean family. The language was well known among the frontiersmen, such as future U.S. President Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison, of the early 19th century. Others in this language family include: Creek, Seminole, Chickasaw, Koasati, Alabama, and Mikasuki.  Language lost its retention with the Choctaws over time as more and more young Choctaws had to go through boarding schools.  In the boarding schools Choctaws were forced to speak the English language making retention of their natural language extremely difficult.  Even though there were boarding schools such as these that many Native Americans had to go through there were still Choctaw schools run by the Choctaw's themselves.  With schools ran solely by the Choctaws some still retained the language though many of those schools became bilingual.\nThe alphabet\nThe written Choctaw language is based upon English characters and was developed in conjunction with the civilization program of the United States in the early 19th century. Although there are other variation of the Choctaw alphabet, the three most commonly seen are the Byington (Original), Byington/Swanton (Linguistic), and Modern.\nByington (Original)\nByington/Swanton (Linguistic)\n, 1909.]]\nModern\n, Present.]]\nStickball\nChoctaw Stickball 1830s painted by George Catlin.\nNative American stickball, one of the oldest field sports in the Americas, was also known as the \"little brother of war\" because of its roughness and substitution for war. When disputes arouse between Choctaw communities, stickball provided a \"civilized\" way to settle the issue. The earliest reference to stickball was in 1729 by a Jesuit priest. The stickball games would involve as few as twenty or as many as 300 players. John R. Swanton states of George Catlin's remarks on the game,\nIt is no uncommon occurrence for six or eight hundred or a thousand [!] of these young men to engage in a game of ball, with five or six times that number of spectators, of men, women, and children, surrounding the ground, and looking on...\nThe goal posts could be from a few hundred feet apart to a few miles. Goal posts were sometimes located within each opposing team's village.\nto five miles (8 km) apart, as was the case in one game in the 19th century.|Kendall Blanchard, The Mississippi Choctaws at Play: The Serious Side of Leisure}}\nThe Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians play stickball today in the 21st century. Every year at the Choctaw Indian Fair near Philadelphia, Mississippi, as well as at the Choctaw Labor Day festival in Tuskahoma, Oklahoma, stickball can be seen played on a modern-day football field.\nTraditional arts\nThe Choctaws are basket weavers and bead workers, dancers and musicians, and cuisine specialists, all of which are part of the collective Choctaw culture that defines them as a distinct cultural group.\nSee also\n*Choctaw Indian Fair\n*Native American art\n*Wild onion festival\nCitations\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060507052851/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html Allen Wright]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100315161340/http://www.choctaw.org/Culture/Welcome%20from%20Miko%20Beasley%20Denson/Welcome%20from%20Miko%20Beasley%20Denson.html Choctaw Culture]"
