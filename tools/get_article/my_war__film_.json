It was released in China by China Film Group Corporation in 3D, IMAX 3D and China Film Giant Screen. As mentioned in the movie, the movie was inspired by Ba Jin's novel \"Reunion\" (\"Tuan Yuan\"). An earlier movie \"Yingxiong ernu (1937)\" was adapted from the same novel.\nThis movie is an historical drama following the Chinese soldiers in the People's Volunteer Army sent to fight in the Korean War against the US and its allies where they experienced life and death and established profound revolutionary feelings.\nPlot\nThe film begins when a train carrying weapons arrived in a station. The Art Troupe were grouped according to the blood type when the males aboard the arriving train mocked the women, until one of the women answered the group's Captain on the local dialect. Meanwhile, a town militia tried to steal weapons on the supply train but was caught. When the train leaves, he dodged the MPs and hopped on the train. The train was carrying troops of the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) to intervene in Korean War. As they arrive in Yalu River, the train was ambushed by American airstrikes and a fortified fortress, causing casualties on the new volunteers. Only on the tactics of their commander Sun Beichuan, they secured the fortress. Next, they were commanded to delay the US attack on a mountain pass, they suffered casualties before one of them detonated himself on the tank. But upon seeing another convoy, they retreated and commanded a father-and-son duo to plant and detonate explosives on the mountainside. The rubble ensued buried the convoy. The unit was honored for their effort. The unit was composed of PVA and some members of Art Troupe.\nWhile entering an abandoned base, they looted it, but detonated booby traps, wounding some of them. One of them stumbled upon a mine, and the Captain saved her. As the soldiers escape, the Americans ambushed them, intending to take the women alive, Big Daddy sacrificed himself and Wenjun died. The girls, full of rage, threw grenades upon their enemies, but Captain Meng was wounded. They flee, while Big Daddy detonated grenades upon the chasing Americans. Days later, they were again tasked with taking some hills.\nAs the bombardment upon the American-occupied hills ends, they charged with human waves, suffered casualties, but after they placed artillery, they repelled the defenders.\nCast\n*Liu Ye as Sun Beichuan / Commander Sun\n*Wang Luodan as Meng Sanxia / Captain Meng\n*Huang Zhizhong as Li Shunliang\n*Tony Yang (credited as Yo Yang) as Zhang Luodong / Little Magician\n*Ye Qing as Wang Wenjun\n*Wang Longhua as Liu Shiwen\n*Guo Jinglin as Tian Yizhuo\n*Ji Xiaofei as Lao Ziwei\n*Huo Yijian as Lao Bangzi\n*Fu Hong as Da Wihu\n*Wang Qi as Da Fuzi / Big Axe\n*Lin Yanlin as Lin Meiyu\n*Liu Yingyi as Xiao Cao\n*Xu Jiaqi as Xiao Song\n*Ding Zenghui as Xiao Shanzi\nReception\nThe film grossed  at the Chinese box office.\nThe film was not well received in the Republic of Korea, and was considered controversial in mainland China, in part due to its promotional material. in which modern South Koreans are perceived as being disrespected. The controversial advertisement depicted a South Korean tour guide in Seoul, shown as being ignorant if China's involvement in the Korean War, being bombastically lectured by patronizing elderly veterans of the events depicted in the film, boasting of their involvement in the invasion of Korea as they recommend the film to her so she might be better \"educated\" as to what they are taking about. Further, there was a lack of prominence of any Korean characters in the film despite the movie depicting the events of the Korean War.\nSee also\n*The Founding of an Army\n*The Founding of a Republic\n*The Founding of a Party\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
