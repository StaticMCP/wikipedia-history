It was assigned to the 4th Army, commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg,  with which it participated in the First Battle of Ypres.  In 1915, it took part in the Second Battle of Ypres and the Second Battle of Champagne and in 1916 in the Battle of the Somme.\nIn November 1916, it was transferred to the Eastern Front.  In late 1917 it returned to the West, initially on border security duties on the Dutch-Belgian border, before returning to the Flanders front in January 1918.  It took part in the German spring offensive from March 1918 and continued to be engaged on the Western Front for the remainder of the War.\nThe Corps was dissolved in February 1919.\nCommanders\nXXVII Reserve Corps had the following commanders during its existence:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
