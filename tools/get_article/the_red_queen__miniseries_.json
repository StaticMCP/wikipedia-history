Although the action is set largely in 1950s–1970s Moscow, principal photography took place on the FILM.UA back-lot in Kyiv, with additional exterior work in Saint Petersburg and the pavilions of VDNKh that once housed Soviet fashion-house exhibitions.\nCast\n* Ksenia Lukyanchikova as Regina Barskaya (the character is inspired by Regina Zbarskaya)\n* Artyom Tkachenko as Lev Barsky\n* Boris Shcherbakov as a senior Party functionary\n* Anatoly Rudenko as Viktor\nAwards and reception\nCritic Caitlin O’Conner praised the “kick-in-the-gut ending that lays bare the cost of beauty under a strict Soviet regime”. Ukrainian Detector Media argued that the lush costuming and nostalgic set-design risked romanticising the late-Soviet period, framing the drama as part of “a Russian television trend of portraying the USSR in pastel, almost Edenic tones”.\nInternationally the miniseries won the Silver Screen Award for Best Television Series at the 49th US International Film & Video Festival in Los Angeles in 2016. At Ukraine’s national Teletriumf awards the same year, it received nominations for Best Drama Series and Best Actress. In April 2017 the drama took Best Series and earned Ksenia Lukyanchikova Best Actress at the inaugural International Film Festival “17 Moments…” in Pavlovsky Posad, Russia.\nReferences"
