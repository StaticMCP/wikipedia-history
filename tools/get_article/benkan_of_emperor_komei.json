      "text": "# Benkan of Emperor Kōmei\n\nThe  is an imperial crown in the benkan style worn by Emperor Kōmei (reigned 1846–1867) of Japan.\nFrom Emperor Shōmu in the 8th century to Emperor Kōmei, the benkan, influenced by the Chinese mianguan, was used in the enthronement ceremonies of Japanese emperors. Starting with Emperor Meiji (reigned 1867–1912), the more Japanese-style }} has been used in enthronement ceremonies.\nThe benkan of Emperor Kōmei is designated as an . Although it is not normally open to the public, it was displayed in 2020 to commemorate Emperor Naruhito's accession to the throne.\nOrigin\nThe benkan is a crown worn by Japanese emperors in conjunction with ''kon'e (, imperial robes) during the enthronement ceremony. The kon'e is embroidered with twelve ornaments reserved for the emperor, and when paired with the kon'e, the ensemble is referred to as the .\nIn the Imperial Costume Catalogue (part of the collection of the Imperial Household Agency, Shoryō Department), compiled in 1912 during a survey of costumes stored in the Kyoto Imperial Palace, this bekan is listed as \"Imperial property of Emperor Kōmei.\" It is believed to have been newly crafted for Emperor Kōmei at the time of his enthronement.\nHowever, Tokinari Kyō Ki (The Record of Tokinari), the diary of aristocrat , states that an \"ancient\" crown was used for the accession of Emperor Kōmei to the throne, suggesting the possibility that the bekan belonged to an earlier emperor.\nIn Tokinari Kyō Ki'', under the entry for August 25, 1847 (Kōka 4), it is recorded that Emperor Kōmei's benkan originally belonged to Emperor Go-Momozono. It also states that the ryū (chain-like ornaments) and other parts were damaged and subsequently repaired.\nSince Emperor Go-Momozono conducted his enthronement ceremony in 1771 (Meiwa 8), if Emperor Kōmei’s benkan had indeed belonged to Emperor Go-Momozono’s, it would have been newly crafted in 1771.\nFeatures\nThe crown measures 20.5&nbsp;cm in length, 19.5&nbsp;cm in width, and 37.5&nbsp;cm in height. The materials used are copper, thin silk (ra), brocade, crystal, and glass, while the manufacturing process includes forging and gilding.\nA gilt-bronze crown called an  is placed around a rounded black cap called a . A thin band of metal fittings is attached to the lower part of the oshikazura. The material and design of the metal fittings are brocade with a check design woven into it, and on the top and bottom of the metal fittings are a series of small dots arranged in a thin line.\nThe upper part of the oshikazura is openwork with a floral and arabesque design. The openwork is decorated in places with three-dimensional floral ornaments of six-petaled flowers with a colored glass bead in the center.\nAt the top of the crown is a rectangular board called a  with a gilt-bronze frame covered with black thin silk (ra). In the center of the benban is an ornament consisting of a flame and a crystal ball, and in front is a gilt-bronze rod with a sun-shaped ornament at the end, which contains a carved three-legged crow (Yatagarasu). Below the sun-shaped ornament is an ornament of . Around the four sides of the benban are }} ornaments of gilt-bronze stems with petals inlaid with colored beads at the tips and in the middle. The sides of the benban are divided into three sections, each section containing two gilt-bronze flower ornaments with five petals stacked on top of each other.\nEighteen chains hang from one end of the benban. Nine of these chains are made of thin wire rings joined, with two colored glass beads between them, and the tips of the rings are further divided into three chains. The other nine are short chains with gilt-bronze bud-shaped ornaments at the tips.\nThese chains hang down on four sides, resulting in 72 chains in total. This is three times the number of chains on the Chinese emperor's mianguan, which has 12 chains on each side of the benban, for a total of 24 chains. If the chains with three separate tips are counted as three chains, each side has 36 chains, for a total of 144 chains.\nThe number of chains and jade beads attached to the Chinese mianguan is based on the descriptions and interpretations in Confucian scriptures such as the Rites of Zhou and the Book of Rites, but the style of the Japanese benkan is not confined by such Confucian interpretations.\nThe chains are not threaded onto beads as in the Chinese mianguan, but rather consist of wire rings joined to form a chain. This style of chain is probably influenced by ancient gilt-bronze crowns and the ornaments on Japanese Buddhist statues.\nComparison with other benkan\nA benkan from 1654 has been handed down to Yasaka Shrine in Kyoto as a sacred treasure. The features of this crown are similar to those of Emperor Kōmei's benkan, including the sun-shaped ornament standing in front of the benban, the tate-tama arranged around the four sides of the benban, and the chain that connects the rings. Therefore, it can be said that a crown similar in style to Emperor Kōmei's benkan existed during the mid-17th century.\nEmperor Ninkō's benkan has also been handed down as an imperial treasure in the Higashiyama Gobunko warehouse of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and its shape is almost the same as that of Emperor Kōmei's benkan.\nSee also\n* Benkan\n* Kanmuri (headwear)\n* Raikan\nNotes\nExplanatory notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
