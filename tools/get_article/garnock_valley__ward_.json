Created in 2022, the ward elects five councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 20,423 people.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the 2019 Reviews of Electoral Arrangements which were instigated following the implementation of the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018. The review coincided with the introduction of the Scottish Elections (Reform) Act 2020 which allowed for the creation of five-member wards. Garnock Valley was formed from two previous wards, taking in all of the former Kilbirnie and Beith ward and the eastern half of the former Dalry and West Kilbride ward. The ward covers the easternmost part of the council area and takes in the towns of Barmill, Beith, Dalry and Kilbirnie.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=10|Councillors\n|-\n!2022\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Donald L.
