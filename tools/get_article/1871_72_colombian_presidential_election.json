The result was a victory for Manuel Murillo Toro of the Liberal Party.\nElectoral system\nThe 1863 constitution changed the electoral system from a direct vote to an indirect vote. The President was now elected on the basis of which candidate received the most votes in each state, with a candidate required to win in at least five of the nine states to be elected. If no candidate received a majority, Congress would elect the President from the main contenders.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Party\n!States won\n|-\n|bgcolor=| ||align=left|Manuel Murillo Toro||align=left|Liberal Party||align=right|6\n|-\n|bgcolor=| ||align=left|Manuel María Mallarino||align=left|Conservative Party||align=right|2\n|-\n|bgcolor=| ||align=left|Julián Trujillo Largacha||align=left|Liberal Party||align=right|1\n|- class=sortbottom\n|align=left colspan=3|Total||align=right|9\n|- class=sortbottom\n!colspan=4|\n|- class=sortbottom\n|align=left colspan=4|Source: [http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Elecdata/Col/pres1826_1990.html PDBA]\n|}\nReferences"
