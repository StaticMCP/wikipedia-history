The team is a member of the American Rivers Conference as well as the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The team plays its regular season games in Levick Arena, along with men's basketball, wrestling, and volleyball teams.\nHistory\nWartburg women's basketball began in 1974, under head coach Doug Johnson. The first Wartburg team finished 12–3 in 1974–75, its first victory coming against the Northern Iowa Panthers. Johnson coached only one season at Wartburg, which marked first winning season. Since Johnson Wartburg has had a total of 7 head coaches, the majority of the seasons coached by Monica Severson and current head coach Bob Amsberry.\nThe 2015–16 season Wartburg broke through to their first final four in school history.  The unranked Knights got an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2002.  They would beat 3 ranked teams on their way to a regional championship and finish the season 23–8.  Since that year the Knights have made it to 8 straight NCAA tournaments and two other appearances in the NCAA Final Four in 2018 and 2024.\nNCAA tournament results\nWartburg has appeared in 17 NCAA Tournaments with a record of 26–17.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=1 | 1989\n||  || First Round || Augustana (Ill) || L 74−93\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 1990\n|| || First RoundSweet Sixteen || Augustana (Ill)Buena Vista || W 72–57L 63−78\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 1991\n|| || First Round || Luther || L 54−78\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 1992\n||  || First RoundSweet SixteenElite Eight || UW-StoutSt. Benedict (MN)Luther || W 90–72W 74–64L 61–70\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 1993\n|| || First RoundSweet SixteenElite Eight || Wash U (MO)UW-WhitewaterCentral (IA) || W 75–60W 83–77L 60–62\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 1994\n|| || First Round || Aurora (IL) || L 57–61\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 1999\n||  || First Round || St Thomas || L 41–67\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2001\n|| 13 || First RoundSecond RoundSweet SixteenElite Eight || ChapmanNebraska WesleyanFontbonneWash U (MO)|| W 86–78W 85–71W 82–78L 71–83\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2002\n|| || First Round || Carleton || L 61–71\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2016\n|| || First RoundSecond RoundSweet SixteenElite EightFinal Four || Wisconsin Lutheran#11 UW-Oshkosh#8 St. Thomas#5 Texas Tyler#7 Tufts || W 65–49W 66–56W 70–66W 80–74L 50–63\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2017\n|| 9 || First Round || Chicago || L 63–67\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2018\n|| 2 || First RoundSecond RoundSweet SixteenElite EightFinal Four || Webster#12 George Fox#7 TrineEast Texas Baptist#5 Bowdoin || W 86–45W 82–58W 78–54W 65–61L 62–90\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2019\n|| 11 || First RoundSecond RoundSweet SixteenElite Eight || Bethany Lutheran#9 Hope#13 UW-Oshkosh#2 St. Thomas (MN)|| W 91–63W 76–49W 70–57L 56–85\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2020\n|| 5 || First RoundSecond Round || Monmouth#11 Whitman|| W 91–55L 63–67\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2022\n||  || First Round || Millikin || L 68–81\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2023\n|| 24 || First RoundSecond RoundSweet Sixteen || #13 Baldwin Wallace#6 Hope#1 Christopher Newport || W 57–43W 81–67L 51–60\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2024\n|| 6 || First RoundSecond RoundSweet SixteenElite Eight Final Four|| Wisconsin Lutheran#16 Illinois Wesleyan Bates#9 Washington and Lee #14 Smith|| W 72–65W 62–59W 54–53W 68–58  L 54-61 OT\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=1 | 2025\n|| 8 || First RoundSecond Round|| Wisconsin–Stevens Point#5 Gustavus Adolphus|| W 57–56L 50–56\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|}\nHead Coaching Records\nCurrent coaching staff\n* Head coach: Bob Amsberry\n* Assistant coach: Kelli Jacobs\n* Assistant coach: Justin Little\n* Athletic trainer: Jessica Albright\nHead coaching history\nAs of the completion of 2025 season\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"60%\"\n!
