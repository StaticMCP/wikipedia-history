He made his league debut for QPR as substitute against Blackburn Rovers in October 1980. On 17 November 1982 he scored his first international and Northern Ireland's winning goal versus that year's World Cup runners up, and reigning European Champions, West Germany in a European Championship qualifying match at Windsor Park, Belfast. One year later in the return game in Hamburg he created the winning goal for Norman Whiteside in another 1-0 win.\nStewart was a crowd favourite at QPR but moved to Newcastle United in the summer of 1985 and joined Portsmouth two years later.
