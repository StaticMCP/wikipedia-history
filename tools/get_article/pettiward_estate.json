The family oversaw and took a direct involvement in much of the speculative development of these areas: parts of West Brompton and small parts of Putney.\nExtent\nThe family trust's key landholdings are in Putney and West Brompton, London.  Most of the houses were originally let for a large premium, to give long leases, archetypally 99 years.  These have been gradually reduced in number by freehold enfranchisement, however value loss has been counteracted by a manifold increase in property prices in the capital over the last centuries, greater than all other British cities.\nDescent\n* John Pettiward - In 1630 John Pettiward married Sarah White daughter and heiress of Henry White of Putney, who during the Commonwealth appointed by Parliament as Sheriff of Surrey in 1653.\n* Roger Pettiward (fl.1660) - The Pettiwards appear to have been Royalists, and following the Restoration of the Monarchy of 1660, \"Roger Pettiward, Esq. of Putney\", was listed as one of the persons qualified to be elected one of the proposed Knights of the Royal Oak, which Order of Chivalry was not proceeded with for political reasons.\n* John Pettiward (born 1652) of Putney - married Honor Davies and left an only daughter as sole heiress, Elizabeth Pettiward (born 1685), who in 1709 married George Mortlock.\n| territorial_extent    = Great Britain\n| royal_assent          = 14 March 1750\n| commencement          = 16 November 1749\n| repeal_date           =\n| repealing_legislation =\n| related_legislation   =\n| status                = Current\n| original_text         =\n| collapsed             = yes\n}}\n* Rev. Roger (Mortlock) Pettiward (1712–1780) - Elizabeth Pettiward's son, of Fairfax House, Putney, in 1749 succeeded to the estates of his uncle Walter Pettiward (d.1749), under which terms, in 1750 he obtained a private act of Parliament,  (23 Geo. 2. c. 8 ), to adopt the surname and arms of Pettiward in lieu of his patronymic.\n* Roger Pettiward (1754–1833), FRS, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries eldest son and heir.

The Pettiward family had owned the nearby manor of Onehouse since the 16th century.

Robert John Pettiward decided to build houses on the land, and had plans completed for so doing in October 1862. A sewer had been built under the land in 1855 by the Metropolitan Commissioner of Sewers, under compulsory powers, unbeknownst to Pettiward, who in 1865 claimed compensation of £1,500 as his plans would need redrawing. The Pettiward's building contractor was William Corbett and Alexander McClymont, who built most of the houses in the 1860s. About 220 houses were built at that time on land owned by R. J. Pettiward. He died in 1908 leaving or having had only 9 daughters, so per the tail male the estates passed to his cousin below, who in 1908 by royal licence adopted the surname Pettiward in lieu of his patronymic.

Surviving records show the Pettiward family as landowners in south-west Kensington in the 1640s. Their West Brompton estate appears to have been acquired later, by Walter Pettiward (died 1749). The Pettiwards sold a small part of their estate to James I Gunter (died 1819) in 1811, a confectioner of Berkeley Square, whose son Robert I Gunter (d.1852) and grandsons Sir Robert Gunter, 1st Baronet (1831–1905) and James II Gunter developed much other land in the area, one of his main streets being Gunter Grove, the southern continuation of Finborough Road beyond the junction with Fulham Road. The estate was bounded to the west by the land of William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington (1777–1852), 39 acres of which he sold before 1840 to form the Brompton Cemetery, opened in 1840.  The eastern boundary was the east side of Redcliffe Gardens, the property of James Gunter. The northern boundary was the back of the houses on Redcliffe Lane. The north–south extent thus comprised numbers 2 to 58 Redcliffe Gardens, west side.\nThe estate bordered:\n*to west: land of William Edwardes, 2nd Baron Kensington (1777–1852),  of which he sold before 1840 to form the Brompton Cemetery, opened in 1840.\n*to east: east side of Redcliffe Gardens, the property of James Gunter.\n*to north: rear of houses on Redcliffe Lane. The north–south extent thus comprised numbers 2 to 58 Redcliffe Gardens, west side.\nThe highest-ceiling homes tend to draw on the South Kensington style, red but also frequently polychromatic (involving cream, yellow and dark shades of red/brown) brick terraces, many distinguished by rusticated quoins and other stone dressings, particularly light, multi-level cornices (at lower storeys often called plats/bands).\n*Finborough Road, the southern half only, both sides, named after the Pettiward family seat of Finborough Hall in Suffolk. A road running on a north–south axis between Fulham Road and Old Brompton Road.\n*Redcliffe Gardens, anciently \"Walnut Tree Lane\", the southern half only, west side only, numbers 2 to 58; the freeholder of the east side was James Gunter. Redcliffe Gardens runs parallel to and on the east side of Finborough Road. The name \"Redcliffe\" was selected by James Gunter, whose larger estate to the immediate east of the Pettiward Estate he named the \"Redcliffe Estate\".\n*Ifield Road, anciently \"Honey Lane\", southern three quarters only, both sides, immediately west of and parallel to Finborough Road, also running on a north–south axis between Fulham Road and Old Brompton Road.\nPutney\nThe Pettiward family owned farms in part of the area between the Lower and Upper Richmond Roads. Roger Astley (died 1780) by his will dated 15 February 1778 bequeathed to Roger Pettiward his \"copyhold estate at Putney consisting of three tenements\". In 1893 on this agricultural land immediately east of Erpingham Road was built an athletic track and concrete cycling velodrome, the first of its type in the United Kingdom.
