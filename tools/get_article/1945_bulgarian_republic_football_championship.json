From 1945 to 1948, the Bulgarian Republic Football Championship was the successor of the Bulgarian State Football Championship.\nOverview\nThe 1945 season was contested by 24 teams, and Lokomotiv Sofia won the championship. As Bulgaria had lost the territories of Vardar Macedonia, Western Thrace and parts of Greek Macedonia that it administered during most of World War II, teams from those regions no longer took part in the Bulgarian championships, beginning in 1945.\nFirst round\n|ZhSK-Botev Pleven}}\n|ZhSK Stara Zagora}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color:#D0F0C0; text-align:left;\" |Replay\n|}\nSecond round\n|}\nQuarter-finals\n|TV 45 Varna}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color:#D0F0C0; text-align:left;\" |Replay\n|}\nSemi-finals\n|Lokomotiv Sofia}}\n|}\nFinal\nFirst game\nG.
