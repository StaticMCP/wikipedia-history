The first three were initially numbered 1230-1232, before being reclassified as the 1400 class. When built, they were tested on standard gauge with Bo-Bo bogies, and received their A1A-A1A bogies upon arrival in Queensland. The demonstrators differ from the production series in placement of the number boxes and marker lights on the ends of the unit.\nThey are similar in appearance to the NZR DA class, first-series Victorian Railways T class and the Kowloon-Canton Railway Class 51 (later the CFCLA TL class), and mainly operated in South East Queensland. The first was withdrawn in December 1986.\nTwo have been preserved:\n*1400 (ex-1230) Mackay Heritage Railway\n*1407 Queensland Rail Heritage Division, stored at Workshops Rail Museum, North Ipswich\nThe 1450 class is a Co-Co version of the G12, lengthened on both ends to accommodate the bogies.\nReferences"
