These ceremonies honoured music industry achievements in Canada during most of 2006. The event was well known for a possible tape delay by the CTV television network so the network could syndicate The Amazing Race.\nCeremonies\nMost winners were announced at the Juno Gala Dinner and Awards ceremony on 31 March. This was a non-televised event conducted at TCU Place. At this event, Tom Jackson received the 2007 Humanitarian Award and Montreal-based music business veteran Donald K. Tarlton received the Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award. Gregory Charles, a Quebec-based musician, hosted this gala.\nThe primary ceremonies of the major awards originated from the Credit Union Centre on 1 April and televised throughout Canada on CTV. Host Nelly Furtado was also the most successful artist this year, winning in five categories: Album of the Year, Artist of the Year, Juno Fan Choice Award, Pop Album of the Year and Single of the Year.\nWinners in the following categories were announced during the primary ceremonies:\n* Album of the Year\n* Group of the Year\n* Juno Fan Choice Award\n* New Artist of the Year\n* R&B/Soul Recording of the Year\n* Rock Album of the Year\n* Single of the Year\nTelecast\nCTV originally planned to provide a tape-delayed broadcast from 22:00 Eastern Daylight Time to accommodate an episode of the American version of The Amazing Race. However, the network relented due to opposition over the late timing, and scheduled the broadcast live from Ontario and eastward (19:00-21:00 Eastern) and tape delayed in western provinces (21:00-23:00 local time in British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 19:00-21:00 in Alberta). Quickly afterwards, the network made yet another change, allowing Saskatchewan viewers to watch the ceremony live (17:00 Central Standard) in addition to its previously scheduled timeslot.\nNational ratings for the Juno telecast were measured by BBM Nielsen at 912&nbsp;000 viewers, an inferior result compared to the 966&nbsp;000 viewers for Global's broadcast of The Simpsons or the 1.03 million viewers CBC gained from its airing of ''At Bertram's Hotel'', an adaptation of the Agatha Christie mystery.\nNominees and winners\nNominees were announced on 6 February 2007.\nArtist of the Year\nWinner: Nelly Furtado\nOther nominees:\n*Gregory Charles\n*Diana Krall\n*Pierre Lapointe\n*Loreena McKennitt\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: Billy Talent\nOther nominees:\n* Alexisonfire\n* Hedley\n* Three Days Grace\n* The Tragically Hip\nNew Artist of the Year\nWinner: Tomi Swick\nOther nominees:\n* Eva Avila\n* Neverending White Lights\n* Melissa O'Neil\n* Patrick Watson\nNew Group of the Year\nWinner: Mobile\nOther nominees:\n* Evans Blue\n* Idle Sons\n* Jets Overhead\n* Stabilo\nJack Richardson Producer of the Year\nWinner: Brian Howes, \"Trip\" (Hedley) and \"Lips of an Angel\" (Extreme Behavior)\nOther nominees:\n* Bob Rock, \"In View\" and \"World Container\" (The Tragically Hip)\n* David Foster, \"Un Giorno Per Noi (Romeo E Giulietta)\" and \"Un Dia Llegara\" (Josh Groban)\n* Julius \"Juice\" Butty, \"Save Your Scissors\" (City and Colour) and \"This Could Be Anywhere in the World\" (Alexisonfire)\n* k-os, \"The Rain\" and \"Sunday Morning\"\nRecording Engineer of the Year\nWinner: John \"Beetle\" Bailey, \"Rain\" (Molly Johnson) and \"Sisters of Mercy\" (Serena Ryder)\nOther nominees:\n* David Travers-Smith, \"The Devil's Paintbrush Road\" and \"Prairie Town\" (The Wailin' Jennys)\n* Eric Ratz, \"Devil in a Midnight Mass\" and \"Red Flag\" (Billy Talent)\n* L.
