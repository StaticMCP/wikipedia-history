The winner in each of Minnesota's eight congressional districts was awarded all of that district's delegates, totaling 47. Another 25 delegates were awarded to the statewide winner, Barack Obama. The 72 delegates represented Minnesota at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Sixteen other unpledged delegates, known as superdelegates, also attended the convention and cast their votes as well.\nCandidates\n* Hillary Clinton\n* Mike Gravel\n* Barack Obama\nCandidates Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, and John Edwards dropped out of the presidential race before the Minnesota Democratic Caucus.\nMoney Raised from Minnesota\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Candidate\n!

Candidates were required to reach a threshold of 15 percent support at the precinct, congressional district, and statewide levels. Unlike other caucuses, there was no realignment of nonviable groups, and the results were binding for the delegates.\nIn 2008, there were more than 4,000 precinct caucus sites. Any Minnesotan who would be eligible to vote in the November general election, was not an active member of a party other than the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, and agreed with DFL party principles was allowed to participate. All participants, by signing in, affirmed their agreement with the DFL's principles. The caucus included a presidential preference primary, in which voters cast secret ballots for presidential candidates. These results were tallied and used to elect 47 delegates from each of the state's eight congressional districts as follows:\n{| class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Sixteen of these delegates were allocated for Barack Obama while nine were allocated for Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nThe remaining 16 delegates were unpledged superdelegates. The 14 Democratic Party Leaders and Elected Officials (PLEOs) included seven Democratic National Committee members, six members of the United States Congress, and former Vice President Walter Mondale. There were also two unpledged add-on delegates, elected at the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party State Convention.\nPre-Caucus Events, Predictions, and Polls\nPolling showed a tightening race for the nomination.\n{| class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

The previous record turnout was about 80,000 in 1968 or 1972; the 2008 turnout exceeded 214,000. As the caucus results came in, Barack Obama consistently held a two-to-one lead over Hillary Rodham Clinton with strong support all throughout the state. Turnout at the Democratic Caucuses was significantly higher than at the Minnesota Republican Caucuses that night.\nFollowing the results of the Super Tuesday elections, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar endorsed Barack Obama.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | 2008 Minnesota Democratic Presidential Caucus Results\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Delegates\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic (DFL)\n| Barack Obama\n| align=\"right\" | 142,109\n| align=\"right\" | 66.39%\n| align=\"right\" | 48\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic (DFL)\n| Hillary Clinton\n| align=\"right\" | 68,994\n| align=\"right\" | 32.23%\n| align=\"right\" | 24\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic (DFL)\n| Uncommitted\n| align=\"right\" | 1,312\n| align=\"right\" | 0.61%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic (DFL)\n| John Edwards\n| align=\"right\" | 985\n| align=\"right\" | 0.46%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic (DFL)\n| Dennis Kucinich\n| align=\"right\" | 361\n| align=\"right\" | 0.17%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic (DFL)\n| Joe Biden\n| align=\"right\" | 129\n| align=\"right\" | 0.06%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic (DFL)\n| Bill Richardson\n| align=\"right\" | 82\n| align=\"right\" | 0.04%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic (DFL)\n| Christopher Dodd\n| align=\"right\" | 77\n| align=\"right\" | 0.04%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic (DFL)\n| Frank Lynch\n| align=\"right\" | 17\n| align=\"right\" | 0.01%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 214,066\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 72\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Voter turnout\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\" | %\n| align=\"right\" | —\n|}\nSee also\n* 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2008 Minnesota Republican presidential caucuses\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.lwvmn.org/ League of Women Voters of Minnesota] Information on caucuses and voting\n* [http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/2008/campaign/president/ Minnesota Public Radio, Campaign 2008: Presidential Race] Campaign news and polls\n* [http://www.dfl.org/ Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party] Detailed caucus information"
