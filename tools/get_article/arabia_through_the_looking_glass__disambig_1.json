Interested in the Arabs he sees on the Earls Court Road where he has a flat, Raban sets out to visit Arabia in the footsteps of writers like T. E. Lawrence and Wilfred Thesiger. He first attempts to learn Arabic with the beautiful Fatma in London before travelling to Bahrain, Doha, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Yemen, Egypt and Jordan. His journey comes full circle with his return to London, described by Raban in the book's final chapter as 'The Biggest Souk in the World'.\nSources\n* Arabia Through the Looking Glass, Picador (1987)\nExternal links\n* The Guardian May 13, 2004  'Emasculating Arabia' [https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1215375,00.html]\n* The Guardian April 19, 2003 'The greatest gulf'  [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/19/iraq.politics]\n* www.doublestandards.org 11 December 2002 'Here we go again' [https://web.archive.org/web/20080725104234/http://www.doublestandards.org/raban1.html]\n* The Guardian March 2, 2002 'Truly, madly, deeply devout' [https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,,660284,00.html]"
