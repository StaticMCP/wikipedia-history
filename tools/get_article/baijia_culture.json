      "text": "# Baijia culture\n\nThe Baijia culture (Ch:百家文化) is an ancient Neolithic culture of China, dated to 5800-5000 BCE. It is considered as the earliest Chinese culture to make painted pottery. The pottery was sometimes painted in simple red.\nThe Baijia culture occupied a large area, in the Shaanxi-Gansu region.\nIt is thought that painted pottery then reached the Yangshao culture, with its Lingkou and Banpo type of potteries, which developed from 5000 to 4200 BCE.\nThe Baijia culture and Dadiwan culture are very similar and located near each other.\nSee also\n* List of Neolithic cultures of China\nReferences"
