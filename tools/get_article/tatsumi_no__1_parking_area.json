On the other hand, annoying acts such as long-term occupation, noise, and sudden acceleration called \"Tatsumi Dash\" have become problems. Fences that block the night view and speed bumps that make it difficult for illegally modified vehicles to enter and exit were installed. In January 2023, a convex step (speed table) was installed on the road surface at the exit of the parking area for the purpose of speed control, but a video of a vehicle passing at high speed using this step as a jump hill was posted on social media. It has been posted many times and has become a problem.\nIn video games\nTatsumi PA has been featured in the upcoming video game NIGHT-RUNNERS and its currently available prologue edition. It is the main place where the game's street racing takes place, as it is where players can challenge racers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.shutoko-sv.jp/parking_area/pa/?id=1427364300-491721 Tatsumi No. 1 PA] - Tatsumi No. 1 PA-Metropolitan Expressway Service"
