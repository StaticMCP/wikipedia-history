He became a trader, soldier and industrialist. In the novel, O'Hara travels to western Pennsylvania to Fort Pitt, now the site of modern-day Pittsburgh. O'Hara also became Washington's quartermaster during the war, and was prominent in the early history of Pittsburgh. The book includes characters such as George Washington, Guyasuta, Mad Anthony Wayne, and George Rogers Clark.\nReferences\n*"
