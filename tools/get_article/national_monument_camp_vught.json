It commemorates the concentration camp known as Kamp Vught that was established there during World War II. The memorial was founded in 1990, with an exhibition building added in 2002. The monument is located on the northeastern tip of the former camp grounds.\nThe initial aim of Kamp Vught was to improve the efficiency of the deportation of Jews from Westerbork by holding Dutch Jews prior to their transport to extermination camps in Germany and Poland. The first prisoners arrived at Vught in January 1943. The camp facilities were liberated on October 26, 1944.\nOutdoor area\nThe outdoor area features a reconstructed half barrack, number 13b, and several reconstructed watchtowers. The watchtowers are lower than the original ones to prevent visibility over the walls of the nearby penitentiary facility located on the former camp grounds.\nThe former crematorium of the concentration camp is also situated on the outdoor area; it is the only museum element that has not been reconstructed. Within the crematorium, the cell in which the Bunker Tragedy took place has been recreated. At the rear of the building, there is the Monument of the Lost Children to commemorate the children's transports on June 1943 to Sobibor.\nBarrack 1b\nBarrack 1b is the only remaining original barrack of the concentration camp. It is not located within the monument area but in another part of the former camp, near the [https://www.geniemuseum.nl/] (Geniemuseum). During the war, the barrack housed the mail department and a canteen. After being relocated to the Netherlands following the Indonesian National Revolution, Moluccan KNIL soldiers and their families were housed in the camp, and this barrack served as a church space. All other barracks were demolished before 1992. This last barrack fell into disuse in 1996 and deteriorated. It was restored in 2012.\nPhotos\nIn March 2021, National Monument Camp Vught acquired three photographs for the first time showing a transport of Jews from Vught station.\nAwards\n2016 – Friends Lottery Museum Prize\nGallery\nFile:NM Kamp Vught Wachttoren.JPG|Watchtowers\nFile:NM Kamp Vught Asput.JPG|Ash pit near the crematorium\nFile:NM Kamp Vught Crematiorium.JPG|Oven in the crematorium\nFile:NM Kamp Vught was ruimte.JPG|Washing area in the barrack\nFile:NM Kamp Vught Leefruimte in barak.JPG|Living area in the barrack\nFile:NM kamp Vught, Bedden in Barak.JPG|Beds in the barrack\nFile:Kampvught2.jpg|Model of the original complex\nAccessibility\nThe Memorial is connected to the bike network in Netherlands, and the Bus 207 connects the monument with the closest train station at Hertogenbosch (the Vught concentration camp was also named Hertogenbosch Kamp).
