He entered the Royal Navy in 1867. He was promoted lieutenant in 1875 and retired in 1881.\nPolitical career\nHe was appointed High Sheriff of Fermanagh for 1884. In 1898 he was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for North Fermanagh. He resigned in 1903, but regained the seat in 1916. The seat was abolished in 1922.\nIn 1921 he stood for the new Parliament of Northern Ireland and was elected for Fermanagh and Tyrone. He held that seat until 1929, and was then elected for Enniskillen, retiring in 1937.\nFrom 1921 to 1925, he served as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce in the Government of Northern Ireland and continued as Minister of Agriculture from 1925 to 1933. As a landowner and practical farmer he was well-qualified for the job. After Archdale's departure from his position, Cahir Healy, a Nationalist leader and member of the Northern Ireland House of Commons, criticised both the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, and Archdale for their public campaign against the employment of Catholics. Healy stated that Archdale's slogan was \"No Catholics need apply\" and said that this policy was not a new one: \"Sir Edward Archdale...declared on 31 March 1925 that out of 109 officials in his Department only four were Roman Catholics, and he apologized for even having four in the service of the Government.\"\nArchdale was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland in the 1921 New Year Honours, entitling him to the style \"The Right Honourable\", and was created a baronet in 1928. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Vice-Admiral Sir Nicholas Edward Archdale.\nArms\n|escutcheon = Quarterly 1st & 4th Azure a chevron Ermine between three talbots passant Or (Archdale) 2nd Or a chevron Sable (Mervyn) 3rd grandquarterly 1st & 4th Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or 2nd & 3rd Gules three gem-rings Gold all within a bordure Or charged with a tressure flory counterflory Gules in the centre point an inescutcheon Argent charged with a tilting spear and sword saltireways points upwards Proper (Montgomery).\n|crest = Out of a ducal crest coronet Or an heraldic tiger's head maned tufted and armed Sable.\n|mantling = Gules doubled Argent.\n|motto = Data Fata Secuta}}\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*Obituary, The Times, 3 November 1943\nExternal links\n* [http://thepeerage.com/p2278.htm Bio at The Peerage.com]"
