The league was founded by a group of team owners and managers in Saskatchewan and Alberta, including Bill Hunter, Scotty Munro, Del Wilson, and Jim Piggott, who thought a larger western league would help western teams compete for the Memorial Cup against teams from the larger associations in Ontario and Quebec. Since the league's founding, it has expanded to include 22 teams across the four Western Canadian provinces along with the Northwest United States, and it has produced 19 Memorial Cup championship teams.\nIronically, the earliest years of the league were marked by disputes with the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, the national governing body for junior hockey, which led to teams in the fledgling league being barred from competing for the Memorial Cup for most years prior to 1971. At the outset of the 1970s, those disputes were resolved and junior hockey was reorganized, with the western league recognized as a top tier major junior league.\n1960s\n*1966: League began play as the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League (CMJHL) with seven teams in Saskatchewan and Alberta: the Estevan Bruins, Moose Jaw Canucks, Regina Pats, Saskatoon Blades, Weyburn Red Wings, Calgary Buffaloes, and Edmonton Oil Kings. League not sanctioned by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) and thus barred from competing for the Memorial Cup.\n*1967: League expands into Manitoba and changes its name to the Western Canada Junior Hockey League (WCJHL). The Calgary Buffaloes renamed the Centennials. The Swift Current Broncos, Flin Flon Bombers, Winnipeg Jets, and Brandon Wheat Kings join the league. League reaches an understanding with CAHA, allowing the WCJHL champion Estevan Bruins to contest the 1968 Memorial Cup.\n*1968: League shortens its name to the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). Dispute over age-limits leads to CAHA again revoking its sanction and the ability for WCHL teams to compete for the Memorial Cup. The Regina Pats, Weyburn Red Wings, and Moose Jaw Canucks leave the league to join the re-booted Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, which was sanctioned to compete for the Memorial Cup. WCHL launches the Canadian Hockey Association to rival the CAHA. Remaining eight WCHL teams are divided into two divisions: East (Flin Flon, Estevan, Winnipeg, Brandon); and West (Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Swift Current).\n*'s Flin Flon Bombers jersey, c. 1967, on display.]]1969: League champion Flin Flon Bombers contest the Canadian Hockey Association \"National Championship\" series—organized to rival the Memorial Cup—against the Western Ontario Junior A Hockey League Champion St. Thomas Barons. Game four is forfeited during the second period by St. Thomas in protest of violent play. Prior to Game 4, Flin Flon led the series 2-games-to-1, and the Bombers, featuring Bobby Clarke and Reggie Leach, are awarded the title. Bombers challenge the Memorial Cup-champion Montreal Junior Canadiens to a match, but the challenge is declined.\n1970s\n*1970: The Regina Pats return to the league and the Medicine Hat Tigers are granted a new franchise. The league reaches a new agreement with CAHA and becomes fully recognized as a top-flight major junior league with the ability to compete for the Memorial Cup, beginning in 1971; the CHA merges with CAHA.\n*1971: League expands into British Columbia to become a fully Western Canadian organization. The Estevan Bruins move and become the New Westminster Bruins, while the Victoria Cougars and Vancouver Nats are both granted franchises. Swift Current Broncos and Saskatoon Blades move to the Eastern Division to balance the league.\n*1972: Memorial Cup format changes to a tournament between the champions of Canada's three major junior leagues—the WCHL, the Ontario Hockey Association, and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.\n*1973: Vancouver Nats move and become the Kamloops Chiefs; Winnipeg Jets renamed the Winnipeg Clubs due to confusion with the World Hockey Association (WHA) Winnipeg Jets.\n*1974: The Regina Pats win the first Memorial Cup title for a WCHL representative. Swift Current Broncos move and become the Lethbridge Broncos.\n*1976: League expands into the United States as the Edmonton Oil Kings—facing pressure from the WHA Edmonton Oilers—move and become the Portland Winter Hawks. Winnipeg Clubs renamed the Winnipeg Monarchs. League divides into three divisions: East (Brandon, Saskatoon, Flin Flon, Regina); Central (Medicine Hat, Winnipeg, Lethbridge, Calgary); and West (New Westminster, Kamloops, Portland, Victoria).\n*1977: The New Westminster Bruins win the first of two consecutive Memorial Cups. League expands into Montana and Washington. Calgary Centennials move and become the Billings Bighorns; Kamloops Chiefs move and become the Seattle Breakers. Winnipeg Monarchs move and become the Calgary Wranglers.\n*1978: Following the addition of American teams, the WCHL is renamed the Western Hockey League (WHL). The Flin Flon Bombers move and become a second incarnation of the Edmonton Oil Kings.\n*1979: The Brandon Wheat Kings establish a league record with 125 points on the season; Brandon wins the league title, but loses in the Memorial Cup final. After one season, the new Edmonton Oil Kings move again and become the Great Falls Americans, before the team ceases operations on December 16. The league pares back to two divisions: West (Portland, Victoria, Seattle, New Westminster) and East (Regina, Calgary, Medicine Hat, Billings, Brandon, Lethbridge, Saskatoon, Great Falls).\n1980s\n*1980: Winnipeg Warriors granted a franchise. Great Falls franchise revived as the Spokane Flyers.\n*1981: The Victoria Cougars establish a WHL and Canadian Hockey League record with 60 wins; the team goes on to win the league playoff title, but falls short at the Memorial Cup tournament.
