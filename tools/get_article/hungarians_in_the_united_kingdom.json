Since Hungary joined the European Union in 2004, the UK's Hungarian population has grown significantly. Although official ONS estimates are that there were about 98,000.\nHistory\nThe first Hungarian student known by name to have matriculated at Oxford University was one Nicolaus de Ungeria, and it is likely that he spent some time in London. Scores of Hungarian students came to study at English and Scottish universities, but the first to settle in London for good was János Bánffyhunyadi (1576–1646) in 1608. He dabbled in alchemy and became a lecturer in chemistry at Gresham College. Marrying an Englishwoman, he had a house in London, and was often visited by fellow countrymen passing through. In 1659, after a short spell in Oxford, Pál Jászberényi settled in London, where he opened a public school for the children of noblemen. He taught them Latin, using innovative techniques. One of the most resourceful scholars who made their home in London at the time of Pepys and Wren was János Mezolaki. He was teaching Latin and philosophy, and died as a patient of Bedlam, in 1693.\nAs with other displaced persons from Central Europe, many Hungarians came to Britain during and after World War II. Furthermore, up to 200,000 Hungarians left their home country after the revolution of 1956, and settled in other countries across the Western world — especially those that formed the Western Bloc. This included refugees to the UK, such as the actor Sandor Éles.\nSince Hungary joined the European Union in 2004, the UK's Hungarian population has grown significantly. It was estimated that 13,159 Hungarian-born people were resident in the UK at the time of the 2001 UK Census. According to the 2011 census there were 48,308 Hungarian-born residents in England and Wales. 17,803 were in London where they made up 0.22% of the population. Just 576 were in North East England, making up 0.02% of the population there. The Hungarian-born population in England and Wales was 0.5% of the population of Hungary. By comparison the Polish-born population of 579,121 was 1.5% of the population of Poland. The Polish-born population is more spread-out around England and Wales. 55% of the Hungarian-born population were in London and South East England, compared to 41% of the Polish-born population and 30% of the total population. There were also 2,943 Hungarian-born residents in Scotland out of a total population of 5,295,403 (0.06%), and 999 Hungarian-born residents in Northern Ireland out of a total population of 1,810,863 (0.06%). This gives a 2011 census total for the whole of the United Kingdom of 52,250.\nThe Office for National Statistics estimated that in 2019 there were 98,000 Hungarian-born people resident in the UK: 47,000 males and 50,000 females. However, there are other estimates that between 200,000 and 220,000 Hungarians were living in the UK in 2020.\nNotable Hungarian immigrants and Britons of Hungarian origin\nLiterature and media\n* Oscar Deutsch (1893–1941) – founder of Odeon Cinemas\n* Frank Furedi (Füredi Ferenc) – commentator\n* John Halas (Halász János) (1912 – 1995) – animator\n* Arthur Koestler (Kösztler Artur) (1905–1983) – novelist, journalist\n* Sir Alexander Korda (1893-1956) – producer, director\n* Sebastian Gorka Military and Intelligence Analyst, Trump Administration Advisor, Social Commentator\n* Mina Loy – artist, poet, playwright, novelist\n* George Mikes (Mikes György) (1912–1987) – writer\n* Baroness Emma Orczy (Orczy Emma) (1865–1947) – writer\n* Emeric Pressburger (1902–1988) – screenwriter, film director, producer\n* Egon Ronay (Rónay Egon) (1915–2010) – food critic\n* Petronella Wyatt – journalist\n* George Szirtes – poet\n* Andor Kraszna-Krausz – Publisher, photographer\nMusicians and performers\n* Miki Berenyi – singer, songwriter (Lush)\n* Joe Bugner (born József Kreul Bugner; 1950–2025) – heavyweight boxer and actor\n* Sandor Éles (1936–2002) – actor\n* Justine Frischmann – artist, musician (Elastica)\n* Stephen Fry – writer, actor\n* Romola Garai – actress\n* Leslie Howard (1893–1943) – actor\n* Princess Julia (born Julia Fodor) – DJ, music writer\n* Kerry Katona – singer\n* Mark Knopfler – singer, songwriter (Dire Straits)\n* Michael McIntyre – comedian\n* Edina Ronay – fashion designer, former actress\n* Steve Sarossy – actor\n* Catherine Schell – actress\n* Georgia Slowe – actress\n* Sir Georg Solti (Solti György) (1912–1997) – conductor\n* Rachel Weisz – actress\nPoliticians\n* Leo Amery (1873-1955) – Conservative Party politician\nScience\n* Dennis Gabor, CBE, FRS (Gábor Dénes) (1900–1979) – Nobel Prize–winning physicist\n* Gustav Wikkenhauser (1901-1974) – engineer\n* Ernő Goldfinger (1902–1987) – architect, furniture designer\n* Nicholas Kurti, FRS (1908–1988) – physicist\n* Imre Lakatos (1922–1974) – philosopher\n* Michael Polanyi (Polányi Mihály) (1891–1976) – scientist, polymath\n* Sir Marc Aurel Stein (Stein Aurél) (1862–1943) – orientalist\nBusiness\n*George Soros (born 1930) – investor, business magnate, and philanthropist\nSport\n*Dominik Kozma, swimmer\n*Johanna Konta, tennis player\n*Conrad Balatoni, football player\n*Tibor Szabo, football player\n*Sammie Szmodics, football player of Irish descent\n*Rebeka Simon, swimmer\n*Callum Styles, football player\n*Imre Varadi, football player of Italian descent\nSee also\n*Hungarian diaspora\n*Hungary–United Kingdom relations\n*Immigration to the United Kingdom\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Zakar, Dr. Andras: The Persecution of Jews in Hungary and the Catholic Church [http://www.churchinhistory.org/pages/booklets/zakar(n)-1.htm]\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hungsoc.com/ Oxford Hungarian Society]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/19990125100039/http://www.hungary.org.uk/ Hungarian Cultural Centre]\n* [http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kulkepviselet/uk/hu Hungarian Embassy UK]"
