The Stuart family descends in the male line from King Robert II of Scotland.\nHe was educated at Charterhouse, Trinity College, Cambridge and the University of Paris.\nMilitary and political career\nStuart fought in the First World War as a Major in the Machine Gun Corps, was mentioned in despatches and was awarded the Military Cross in the 1918 Birthday Honours. His two elder brothers were both killed in the First World War and in 1921, he succeeded his father as seventh Earl Castle Stewart. However, as this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. He was elected to the House of Commons for Harborough in 1929 as a Conservative and Unionist, a seat he held until 1933.\nFamily\nOn 16 December 1920 Stuart married Eleanor May, daughter of Solomon Guggenheim, and had four sons:\n* David Andrew Noel Stuart, Viscount Stuart (1921−1942), killed in action during the Second World War\n* Robert John Ochiltree Stuart, Viscount Stuart (1923−1944), killed in action during the Second World War\n* Arthur Patrick Avondale Stuart, 8th Earl Castle Stewart (1928−2023)\n* Simon Walter Erskine Stuart (1930−2002), father of the food writer Tristram Stuart\nStuart committed suicide with a shotgun in his study at Old Lodge, his house and estate at Ashdown Forest near Uckfield, on 5 November 1961. Following the death of his widow in 1992, Old Lodge was sold to a member of the Saudi royal family.\nReferences\nSources\n*Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).
