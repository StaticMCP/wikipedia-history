Ware, an officer of the United States Navy. in the ensuing years, she gained recognition as an accomplished writer of odes for public events and contributed to literary journals. Among her odes was one addressed to Lafayette and presented to him in the ceremony of his reception in Boston, by her eldest child, then five years old; and another, in honor of New York Governor DeWitt Clinton, which was recited at the Erie Canal celebration in New York.\nIn 1828, Ware commenced in Boston the publication of a literary periodical, entitled The Bower of Taste, which was continued several years. Later, she relocated to New York City. In 1839, she went to Europe, where she remained until her death, in Paris in 1843.\nA few months before she died, Ware published, in London, a selection from her writings, under the title of The Power of the Passions and other Poems.\nSelected works\n* The Power of the Passions and other Poems, 1842 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=BoQ1AAAAMAAJ text])\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
