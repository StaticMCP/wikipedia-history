Beginning under the reign of George VIII, it continued under Bagrat VI and later Constantine II, affecting the entire country with fighting in Abkhazia, Svaneti, Imereti, Samtskhe, Kartli, Mingrelia, and Kakheti.\nThe war began in the 1460s following separatist uprisings in the northern principality of Samtskhe and soon escalated into a series of separatist conflicts opposing the central government of Tbilisi to royal claimants in Imereti and Kakheti. For three decades, Georgia grew poorer and weaker. In 1491, peace was concluded with the formal division of the Kingdom of Georgia into four independent states, bringing an end to the unified kingdom that had existed since the 11th century.\nThe conflict took place in a context of major geopolitical shifts in the Near East, notably the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 and of Trebizond in 1461, both to the rising power of the Ottoman Empire. At the same time, Turcoman tribes fueled political divisions within Georgia to facilitate the conquest of the country.\nBackground\nExternal situation\nAt the beginning of the second half of the 15th century, the Kingdom of Georgia was the most powerful state in the Caucasus, following its revival under the reign of Alexander I, known as the Great (1412–1442). However, the region was still suffering, two centuries after the first Mongol invasion, from the massacres and destruction carried out by the Timur in the early 1400s. Moreover, unlike during Georgia’s Golden Age in the 13th century, the neighboring powers had grown stronger, posing a much greater threat. In particular, the Turcoman tribes of Persia united to form the Qara Qoyunlu confederation, an empire that ravaged Georgia beginning in the 1410s.\nIn 1453, the Ottoman Empire, based in Anatolia, captured Constantinople, bringing an end to the Byzantine Empire, the seat of Orthodox Christianity since the 4th century. This event, followed by the fall of Trebizond in 1461, isolated Georgia from the Western world, leaving the kingdom as the only Christian country in the Near East. In response, Georgian nobles briefly united in an effort to persuade Western European powers to launch a new crusade. However, this initiative quickly collapsed, as Europeans did not view the Ottomans as a threat, leaving Georgia vulnerable to the Turcomans of Persia.\nThe decline of international trade, the disappearance of the kingdom’s cultural allies, and the growing threats at the foot of the Caucasus spread poverty and desolation throughout Georgia, providing an ideal context for nobles seeking to gain more power.\nDivision of Georgia\nTo protect the central government’s authority over the kingdom’s provinces, Alexander I appointed in 1433 his three sons, Demetrius, Vakhtang, and George, as co-kings, following the Byzantine tradition of naming heirs as co-emperors. Together, the rulers shared governance of the country, with Demetrius overseeing western Georgia, while his brother George administered Kakheti on behalf of Tbilisi.\nHowever, this arrangement was short-lived. In 1442, Alexander I abdicated and retired to a monastery, leaving the primary crown to his eldest son, Vakhtang IV. He reigned for four years, a period marked by the dominance of the most powerful nobles, who gained a degree of autonomy after threatening civil peace. Vakhtang IV died without an heir in 1446, leaving the throne to his two younger brothers, who had to share a divided kingdom. Demetrius, the legitimate successor of Vakhtang IV, received the Duchy of Samokalako, while George VIII became king of Kakheti and Kartli, eventually controlling the entire kingdom after Demetrius’ death in 1453.\nIn the west, the power of Tbilisi declined throughout the 15th century. The duchies of Svaneti, Abkhazia, and Guria, along with Mingrelia, on which they depended, became increasingly autonomous despite attempts by the central government to regain control of the Black Sea coast. In 1401, the kingdom of western Georgia was invaded and annexed by King George VII. Alexander I created the Duchy of Samokalako in 1414 to ally with the heirs of the secessionist state; however, this arrangement was not confirmed by Bagrat, who became Duke of Samokalako in 1455.\nThe northern principality of Samtskhe, ruled by the house of Jaqeli, was the first to officially leave the Georgian kingdom with the rise to power of Prince Qvarqvare II in 1451. He proclaimed the religious independence of his state by confiscating the buildings of the Catholicossate of Georgia, forbidding any mention of the Georgian king and patriarch in churches under his jurisdiction, and replacing Georgian clergy with priests from Greece or Antioch. This schism was only temporary, as a severe response from the Catholicossate of Georgia forced Qvarqvare II to abandon these ambitions.\nCivil war\nConsequences\nReferences"
