The Irish format is similar to systems used in many parts of Europe, notably the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Belgium and France, where geographical numbers are organised using a logic of large regional prefixes, which are then further subdivided into smaller regions. It differs from UK numbering, which originated as alphanumeric codes based on town names.\nIrish Mobile and non–geographic numbers are fixed length and do not support local dialling.\nThe trunk prefix 0 is used to access numbers outside the local area and for all mobile calls. This is followed by an area code, referred to as a National Dialling Code (NDC), the first digit of which indicates the geographical area or type of service (e.g. mobile).\nCalls made from mobile phones and some VoIP systems always require the full area code and phone number.\nIn common with most European countries, the trunk prefix 0 must be omitted when calling Irish numbers from abroad.\nGeneral structure of Irish numbering\nIrish area codes vary in length, between one and three digits (excluding the leading 0), and subscribers' numbers are between five and seven digits.\nAs optional local dialling is facilitated, Irish geographic numbers cannot begin with 0 (trunk prefix), 1 (special number prefix) or 999 (emergency services). However, mobile numbers use the full range of digits, as local dialling is not supported on mobile networks, and the area code must always be dialled.\nA migration to a standard format, 0xx xxx xxxx, is in progress; however, to avoid disruption, this process is only being carried out as needed, where existing area codes and local numbering systems have reached full capacity. There is currently no plan to move to a closed numbering system.\nNumber formats\nIrish geographic numbers vary in length from area to area, but follow standard formats within each area code.\nThe area code, or prefix, is normally separated by a space, or less commonly, may be displayed in parentheses (brackets). Numbers are usually grouped into easy to read clusters, separated by spaces or hyphens for ease of use.\nThe use of spaces is recommended by ComReg for ease of compatibility with online services, such as linking to a phone number in a mobile browser, copying and pasting into mobile diallers etc\nOther characters, such as / or . are not used as separators.\nArea codes / prefixes are always separated from the subscriber number. Merging or reformatting these tends to cause confusion or make numbers look unfamiliar.\nWhile formats vary, numbers are usually printed (e.g. in telephone directories) as follows:\nGeographic:\n*01 XXX XXXX – Dublin area\n*0XX XXX XXXX – All other 7-digit areas\n*0XX XXX XXX – 6-digit areas\n*0XX XXXXX – 5-digit areas\n*0X0X XXXXX – 5-digit areas\nNon-geographic\n*1800 XXX XXX – Freephone/Toll Free\n*0818 XXX XXX – Standard Rate\nMobile\n*08X XXX XXXX\nMobile M2M (Machine to Machine)\n*088 XXXXX XXXXX\nAlphanumeric dialling, using letters as mnemonics for advertising etc is supported, but is rarely used.\nGeographical numbering\nIrish geographical numbering is structured on a regional basis and follows a logical hierarchy.\nThese directory areas correspond approximately to the following geographical regions:\n* 01 – Greater Dublin Area\n* 02 – Cork\n* 04 – Northeast\n* 05 – Southeast\n* 06 – Midwest and Southwest\n* 07 – Northwest\n* 09 – West\nThe Midlands is covered by several regional codes.\nExcept for the 01 area, each area is further subdivided into smaller areas (NDCs). Usually, the main city or town in the area is 0x1 e.g. 021 (Cork), 061 (Limerick), 091 (Galway).\nRegional overview\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! width=\"130\" | Directory area || width=\"230\" | National Dialling Codes (NDCs) || width=\"350\" | Region and cities / towns\n|-\n!01\n|01 – single NDC for entire region||Dublin area: extends to certain parts of Wicklow, Meath and Kildare.\n|-\n!02\n|021 to 029 || Cork area:\n* 021: Metropolitan Cork\n* 022: Mallow\n* 023: Bandon\n* 024: Youghal\n* 025: Fermoy\n* 026: Macroom\n* 027: Bantry\n* 028: Skibbereen\n* 029: Kanturk\n|-\n!04\n|0402, 0404, 041 to 047 and 049 || Northeast and Midlands:\n* 0402: Arklow\n* 0404: Wicklow\n* 041: Drogheda\n* 042: Dundalk and Carrickmacross\n* 043: Longford\n* 044: Mullingar\n* 045: Newbridge and Naas\n* 046: Navan and Edenderry\n* 047: Monaghan\n* 049: Cavan and Oldcastle\n|-\n!05\n|0504, 0505, 051 to 053, 056 to 059|| Midlands and Southeast:\n* 0504: Thurles\n* 0505: Roscrea\n* 051: Waterford, New Ross and Carrick–on–Suir\n* 052: Clonmel\n* 053: Wexford\n* 056: Kilkenny\n* 057: Portlaoise and Tullamore\n* 058: Dungarvan\n* 059: Carlow, Athy and Baltinglass\n|-\n!06\n|061 to 069 || Midwest and Southwest:\n* 061: Limerick, Shannon and Scarriff\n* 062: Tipperary\n* 063: Charleville\n* 064: Killarney\n* 065: Ennis\n* 066: Tralee\n* 067: Nenagh\n* 068: Listowel\n* 069: Newcastle West\n|-\n!07\n|071 and 074 || Northwest\n* 071: Sligo and Carrick–on–Shannon\n* 074: Letterkenny\n|-\n!09\n|090, 091, 093 to 099|| West and Midlands\n* 090: Athlone, Ballinasloe and Roscommon\n* 091: Galway\n* 093: Tuam\n* 094: Castlebar and Castlerea\n* 095: Clifden\n* 096: Ballina\n* 097: Belmullet\n* 098: Westport\n* 099: Kilronan\n|}\nComReg maintains a map of area codes [https://www.comreg.ie/licensing_and_services/area_code_maps.552.1040.html here].\nMobile services\nMobile phone numbers start with the prefix 08x and are part of a closed numbering plan, which means that a mobile phone number must have 10 digits. Calls to landlines and other mobiles require the area code on a mobile phone.\nNew numbers are assigned on prefixes and ranges managed by a specific operator. However, as full mobile number portability has been in operation since 2003, it is no longer possible to reliably identify which network a particular number is on. For example, a newly assigned Three number would begin with 083, but may have been ported to another operator in the meantime.\nMobile network operators (MNOs)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! NDC\n!

This prefix was originally used for the Eircell TACS network active from 1985 to 2001.\n|}\nDirect to voicemail number\nMobile phone numbers also have their own voicemail number. To access this, the number 5 should be put after the prefix. For example, the mobile number 08x xxx xxxx has the voicemail number 08x 5 xxx xxxx.\nOn some networks, when the direct to voicemail number is called, the voicemail greeting for that network is played (e.g. Vodafone, eir Mobile), while others request a phone number followed by the voicemail greeting for that number (e.g. Three). Users can press the hash key (#) to gain access to the voicemail box.\nCalls to Northern Ireland\nAlthough Northern Ireland is part of the UK numbering plan, a special arrangement exists for calling Northern Irish landlines from the Republic of Ireland.\nCalls to Northern Ireland can be dialled using the 048 prefix or by dialling the number in the full international format. Most Irish operators treat calls to Northern Ireland at national or even local rates. Similar charging arrangements apply when calling the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland.\nFor example, to reach Belfast landline 90xx xxxx, subscribers can dial either 048 90xx xxxx or 00 44 28 90xx xxxx.\nNorthern Ireland mobile phones use the same mobile numbering and networks as other parts of the UK – calls must be dialled using the 00 44 7xxx xxx xxx format.\nInternational calls\nIn common with all EU countries, the international access code is 00.\nNumbers should be dialled as follows: 00 – country code – area code – local number.\nAll mobile phones and some VoIP services also support the international E.164 number format, so a + may be optionally used instead of 00.\nReserved numbers\n*03 – reserved for future changes in the numbering plan\n*07 – all except 0707, 0700, 071, 074 and 076 are reserved without assigned purpose\n*0707 – reserved for personal numbering\n*0800 – reserved\nSpecial numbers\n*00 – international access\n*020 91x xxxx – drama use (although the rest of 020 is free)\n*0700 – personal numbering\n*076 – VoIP services – (being withdrawn.)\n*080 – mailbox for landline users (formerly access code for Northern Ireland)\n*089 011 0xxx – drama use\nSpeed dial short numbers to contact carriers\n*1901 – eir\n*1902 – Digiweb\n*1903 – Tesco Mobile\n*1904 – BT Ireland\n*1907 – Vodafone Ireland\n*1908 – Virgin Mobile Ireland\n*1910 – Magnet Networks\n*1913 – Three Ireland\n*1977 – NUACOM Ireland\n*1923 – Lycamobile Ireland\nOperator services\nGeneral operator assistance no longer exists in Ireland.\n*118xx – Directory enquiries (multiple commercial providers offer a variety of services in this number range)\nEmergency services\nThe emergency number for Ireland is 999. However, the 112 code also accesses the emergency operator. This code is harmonised across the EU. Either can be dialled.\nServices provided\n*Ambulance\n*Garda Síochána\n*Fire and rescue\n*Irish Coast Guard\n*Cliff and mountain rescue\nSMS emergency service\n112 can also be contacted by SMS. While the service is open to all users, it is primarily aimed at the deaf community.\nPre-registration used to be required. Further information can be found at [https://112.ie/sending-a-text-to-112/ Sending a text to 112].\nPremium rate numbers\nPremium rate voice\nIrish premium rate telephone numbers start with 15 and are read in two-digit blocks e.g. 1550 is \"fifteen fifty\".\nThe rates given below are from ComReg and are indicative only.

For example:\n1800 71x xxx or 0818 71x xxx. This allows the telephone network to manage traffic during number analysis, even before the call is routed.\nIreland's non-geographic numbers and pricing structures were simplified and old shared-cost prefixes were withdrawn on 1 January 2022.\nThese changes mean that calls to non-geographic numbers are either freephone, or always included in call bundles, ensuring consumers are not confused by out of bundle, or other unusual charges.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This was to avoid disruption to essential health services during a time of high volumes of calls. They operated alongside the new numbers that replaced them but advertising of the expiring numbers ceased. Calls to these numbers were be charged on the same basis as calls to landlines or 0818 and included in call bundles.\nFreephone numbers are free to call from mobile handsets; however, the recipient can elect to refuse mobile–originated calls or choose to accept calls only from predefined geographical region(s).\nNB: 1800 can only be dialled from within Ireland. Numbers should never be printed or presented in the international format +353 1800 as these clash with working Dublin landline numbers in the 01 area +353 1 800 xxxx. Alternative geographic numbers, or an 0818 number should be used instead, if international access is required.\nFollowing a 2019 review of non–geographic numbers Comreg decided to withdraw and close the 1850, 1890 and 076 number ranges by 1 January 2022. During the transition period, these ranges were geo–rated (charged as if they are geographical numbers).\nFrom August 2019, various telecoms providers announced price changes which took effect on, or just before, 1 December 2019, including [https://www.virginmedia.ie/business/faqs/ngn/ Virgin Media Business], [https://www.in2tel.ie/comreg-ngn-changes/ in2tel], [https://www.virginmedia.ie/nongeo/ Virgin Media], [https://www.eir.ie/pricingupdate/ eir], [https://www.tescomobile.ie/nongeo Tesco Mobile], [https://notifications.three.ie/service-notification/ngn-and-network-speeds Three], [https://digiweb.ie/knowledge-base/call-charges/ Digiweb], [https://www.puretelecom.ie/blog/customer-notification-comreg-price-update-1850-1890-0818-or-076-numbers Pure Telecom], [https://48months.ie/boiler-plate/ngn-and-network-speeds 48 months], [https://www.sky.com/ireland/terms-conditions/broadband-talk/ Sky] and [https://nuacom.com/ngns-the-last-non-geographic-numbers-in-ireland/ NUACOM]\nFrom 1 January 2022 callers to the withdrawn prefixes receive recorded announcements.\nInternet access numbers\n*1891 – reduced cost internet access (possibly timed)\n*1892 – local rate internet access (timed)\n*1893 – variable cost internet access (timed)\nCarrier selection (per call)\n*13xxx – carrier selection (third party long distance, international and internet services). These codes override the default carrier.\nCarrier preselect is normally used where the exchange automatically uses the customer's preferred provider(s).\nNetwork engineering codes\n*199xxx... – network operator-specific engineering codes (undefined length). These codes are generally not published.\nLine information codes\nThese services give the user more information about their phone line (applicable only to lines provided using the OpenEir access network.)\nCheck phone number associated with line / automatic number announcement circuit (ANAC)\n*199000 – reads out the subscriber's telephone number.\nCheck preset carrier\nCheck which carrier a subscriber is using for each category of call:\n*19800 – international calls\n*19822 – local calls\n*19801 – calls to other parts of the Republic of Ireland, Irish mobile numbers and landlines in Northern Ireland.\nVoicemail\n*171 – used to access voicemail on all networks: fixed line (POTS and Cable), all mobile operators and many VoIP providers.\nCall management services / supplementary service codes\nSpecial short codes are used to control various supplementary services offered by digital local exchanges. These services were first introduced as PhonePlus in 1981, on the first generation of Alcatel E10 and Ericsson AXE digital exchanges used in Ireland, and were rolled out nationally throughout the 1980s.\nThese services are available on all Irish PSTN lines, regardless of operator. There is a more expansive range of services available, but these are the most commonly used. Different codes apply on cable telephony lines, such as those provided by Virgin Media Ireland and on VoIP providers.\nPSTN lines and some ISDN services\nCaller ID services\n*141 – caller ID default override – withhold caller ID on this call\n*142 – caller ID default override – present caller ID on this call\n*1471  – check last missed call. The system will verbally announce details of the last missed call\n*#93# – delete missed call information from network memory\nCall waiting\n**43# – setup\n**#43# – check status\n*#43# – cancel\nAnswering call waiting\n*R0 – reject call (or send to voicemail) and temporarily suspend call waiting service for this call.\n*R1 – answer waiting call and disconnect current call.\n*R2 – answer waiting call and place current call on hold/or swap between calls.\n*R3 – merge both calls into a three–way call.\nConference/three–way calling\n*While on a phone call a subscriber can press the R key on their phone and dial the number they wish to add to the conversation.\n*Dial R3 to begin conference/three–way call.\n*R2 allows a subscriber to separate the calls and swap between them.\nCall hold / transfer to another extension\n*R – places call on hold. Hang up and telephone will ring until call on hold is picked up again.\nCall forwarding (unconditional)\n**21*(phone number)# – forward all calls to (phone number)\n**#21# – check status\n*#21# – deactivate\nWhen this service is active, the dial tone changes to a two–frequency 'siren' tone.\nAlarm / reminder call\n**55*[time in 4–digit 24h format]# e.g. for 8:30&nbsp;am dial *55*0830#\n**#55# – check status\n*#55# – cancel\nMost exchanges confirm setup with a verbal announcement; however, some exchanges may use a ringing tone to indicate successful service setup and a busy tone to indicate an error/invalid code.\nServices on Virgin Media Ireland cable network\n(Codes are unique to Virgin Media Ireland and do not follow ETSI guidelines)\nCaller ID services\n*141 – caller ID default override – withhold caller ID on this call\n*142 – caller ID default override – present caller ID on this call\nCall forwarding\nCall forwarding (unconditional)\n**70 – immediately followed by  (phone number)\n*#70 – deactivate\nForwarding to voicemail\n**75 – activate when busy\n*#75 – deactivate when busy\n**77 – forward if unanswered\n*#77 – deactivate if unanswered\nCall waiting\n**72 – activate\n*#72 – deactivate\nAnswering call waiting\n*R1 – answer waiting call and disconnect current call.\n*R2 – answer waiting call and place current call on hold or swap between calls.\nAnonymous call rejection\n**90 – activate\n*#90 – deactivate\nRedial last number called\n*##\nThe subscriber will either hear a tone or a voice message to confirm services have been set up or deactivated.\nMobiles\n*GSM supplementary service codes – All of Ireland's mobile providers use the standard GSM codes to control special services such as call forwarding, barring, call waiting etc.\nNumber changes\nSeveral major number changes have occurred since 1990. The telephone number changes in Dublin and Cork took several years to complete, as they were busier area codes with few available lead digits.\nOther number changes took place in just one step, with all numbers being changed simultaneously.\nTo minimise disruption simultaneous working was enabled, allowing old numbers to remain mapped and active for a run-in period of one year. Caller ID only displayed the new numbers. This was followed by recorded announcements which remained active for at least a year, advising callers of the number change. Eventually this would be replaced by a dialling error message.\n1990–1994\nDublin (01) changes to 7-digits.\n* All local numbers with the area code 01 changed from 6–digits to 7–digits in five stages between 1990 and 1994:\n**On 2 April 1990, numbers beginning with 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 70 and 79 were prefixed with 6.\n**On 8 April 1991, numbers beginning with 8 and 69 were prefixed with 2.\n**On 4 April 1992, numbers beginning with 4 and the remaining 6–digit numbers beginning with 2 were prefixed with 8.
