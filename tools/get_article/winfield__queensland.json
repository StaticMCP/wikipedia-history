In 2013, there were 16 students enrolled, but, by August 2017, there were no students and no prospect of new enrolments in the coming years. The changing demographics of the area had seen an increase in retirees and tourists but a loss of young families with school-aged children due to a lack of local jobs. The school is expected to be permanently closed, but, as at 2022, the school remains mothballed.\nThere are no secondary schools in Winfield.
