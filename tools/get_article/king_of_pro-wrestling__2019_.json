It took place on October 14, 2019 at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo, Japan. It was the eighth event under the King of Pro-Wrestling name.\nProduction\nBackground\nKing of Pro-Wrestling took place on  October 14, 2019, on , a Japanese public holiday. Due to the events of the Typhoon Hagibis, Jon Moxley and Zack Sabre Jr. were unable to fly in to Japan, prompting last minute changes to the card.\nStorylines\nKing of Pro-Wrestling featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nAt the Best of the Super Juniors 26 finals on June 5, Jon Moxley defeated Juice Robinson to win the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship. Later, Moxley and Robinson would wrestle again in the G1 Climax on August 11, with Robinson winning and thereby preventing Moxley from winning the tournament. Moxley subsequently challenged Robinson to a No Disqualification match for the United States Championship at King of Pro-Wrestling. However, Moxley was unable to attend the event due to travel issues stemming from Typhoon Hagibis. Per NJPW rules, he was stripped of the title and a match between Robinson and Lance Archer for the vacant title was scheduled instead.\nOn night three of the G1 Climax on July 14, Evil defeated Kota Ibushi in a block match. Despite the loss, Ibushi went on to win the tournament, becoming the holder of the Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate. In a post-tournament interview, Ibushi declared that he wanted to defend the certificate against those who had beaten him, setting up a match between the two for this event.\nResults\n|times   =\n|match1  = Suzuki-gun (El Desperado and Yoshinobu Kanemaru) defeated Roppongi 3K (Sho and Yoh)\n|stip1   = Tag team match\n|time1   = 10:44\n|match2  = Hiroshi Tanahashi and Tomoaki Honma defeated The Most Violent Players (Togi Makabe and Toru Yano)\n|stip2   = Tag team match\n|time2   = 9:43\n|match3  = Los Ingobernables de Japón (Tetsuya Naito and Shingo Takagi) defeated Suzuki-gun (Taichi and Douki) by disqualification\n|stip3   = Tag team match\n|time3   = 9:00\n|match4  = Minoru Suzuki defeated Jyushin Thunder Liger\n|stip4   = Singles match\n|time4   = 17:38\n|match5  = Will Ospreay (c) defeated El Phantasmo\n|stip5   = Singles match for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship\n|time5   = 27:58\n|match6  = Chaos (Hirooki Goto, Tomohiro Ishii and Yoshi-Hashi) defeated Bullet Club (Jay White, Kenta and Yujiro Takahashi)\n|stip6   = Six-man tag team match\n|time6   = 12:27\n|match7  = Lance Archer defeated Juice Robinson\n|stip7   = No Disqualification match for the vacant IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship\n|time7   = 14:58\n|match8  = Kota Ibushi defeated Evil\n|stip8   = Singles match for the Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate\n|time8   = 24:05\n|match9  = Kazuchika Okada (c) defeated Sanada\n|stip9   = Singles match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship\n|time9   = 36:21\n}}\nSee also\n*2019 in professional wrestling\n*List of NJPW pay-per-view events\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.njpw.co.jp/series/kopw2019 King of Pro-Wrestling at NJPW.co.jp]"
