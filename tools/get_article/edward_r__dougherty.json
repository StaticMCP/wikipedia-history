Dougherty is an American mathematician, electrical engineer, Robert M. Kennedy '26 Chair, and Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University. He is also the Scientific Director of the Center for Bioinformatics and Genomic Systems Engineering. Dougherty is a specialist in  nonlinear image processing, small-sample classification problems, and modeling gene regulatory networks. He is the Fellow of IEEE and SPIE.\nDougherty is the author of 16 books, whose topics range from basic probability books to advanced computational biology and genomic systems engineering. He proposed the Probabilistic Boolean Network (PBN) model for gene regulatory networks. PBNs have been extensively used for intervention and classification in genomic problems. He has also introduced the notion of Bolstered Error Estimation and Coefficient of Determination for Nonlinear Signal Processing.\nHonors and awards\n*2012 Distinguished Professor,  Texas A&M University\n* 2011 Fellow, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n* 2010 Fellow, Texas Engineering Experiment Station\n* 2007 Doctor Honoris Causa, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere University of Technology\n*2004 International Society of Optical Engineering (SPIE) President's Award\n*2000 Fellow,  International Society of Optical Engineering (SPIE)\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\n}}"
