It is encompassed within two areas of the City Information System, Jeziorki Północne (North Jeziorki) and Jeziorki Południowe (South Jeziorki). The neighbourhood is a residential area of low-rise single-family housing.\nThe village of Jeziorki was founded in the 15th century, via separation from the village of Gramnica, which no longer exists. In 1951, it was incorporated into the city of Warsaw.\nEtymology\nThe name Jeziorki refers to numerous lakes and ponds located within its boundaries, and can be loosely translated from Polish as the Little Lakes.\nHistory\nrailway station, opened in 1936.]]\nThe village of Jeziorki was founded in the 15th century, via separation from the village of Gramnica, which no longer exists. In the 16th century, it was owned by the Jeziorkowski family of the Radwan heraldic clan. In 1528, together with the surrounding farmland, its estate had an area of 50 ha. In 1602, it was part of the Catholic parish based in Raszyn.\nThe village was destroyed by Swedish forces during the Second Northern War, a conflict between the Swedish Empire and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, sometime between 1655 and 1656. In the second half of the 17th century, a portion of the village, with an area of 9 ha, was bought by Warsaw canon Czyżewski, who then incorporated it into his land estate of Dawidy. In 1729, Jeziorki had 10 households.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, German settlers began moving into the village, which was then divided into two parts: Jeziorki Polskie (Polish Jeziorki) in the north, with Polish population, and Jeziorki Niemieckie (German Jeziorki) in the south, inhabited by Germans, later known as Nowe Jeziorki (New Jeziorski). In 1827, the latter had 110 residents in 10 households.\nIn 1864, German settlers had also founded the village of Ludwinów, located to the north of Jeziorki, in the area of current Ludwinowska Street.\nIn 1905, Jeziorki Niemieckie had 82 inhabitants in 12 households, and in 1921, it had 80 inhabitants and the same number of households. In 1905, Jeziorki Polskie had a population of 209 people in 13 households, and in 1921, 194 people in 19 households.\nIn 1936, the Warszawa Jeziorki railway station was opened at the current crossing of Karczunkowska Street and Gogolińska Street. In 1962, the Warszawa Dawidy railway station, was also opened to the north, at Baletowa Street. Both are operated to the present day by the Polish State Railways, and are part of the railway line no. 8, between Warsaw West and Kraków Main stations.\nOn 24 March 1946, the Pyry Cemetery was opened at Łagiewnicka Street, operated by the Saint Apostles Peter and Paul Church, located in the nearby Pyry.\nOn 14 May 1951, the area including Jeziorki and Ludwinów was incorporated into the city of Warsaw.\nIn 1996, the administrative neighbourhoods of Jeziorki and Etap, were established as two subdivisions of the municipality of Warsaw-Ursynów. Both neighbourhoods continued to exist following the restructuring of the municipality into the Ursynów district in 2002. Their status was reconfirmed in 2013. The neighbourhood of Jeziorki has an area of 816 ha, and encompasses area between Warsaw Metro branch line, and in a line west from its crossing with Karnawał Street, Czempińska Street, Farbiarska Street, Klarnecistów Street, Sarabandy Street, Karczunkowska Street, Puławska Street, and the boundaries of the district of Ursynów. The neighbourhood of Etap has an area of 9 ha, and is an enclave surrounded by Jeziorki. It is located between Dawidowska Street (also including a building adjusted to its northeastern side), Karczunkowska Street, and the tracks of the railway line no. 8.\nIn 1998, the district of Ursynów was subdivided into the areas of the City Information System, with neighbourhoods of Jeziorki and Etap together being encompassed within areas of Jeziorki Północne (North Jeziorki), and Jeziorki Południowe (South Jeziorki). They are separated by Baletowa Street.\nBetween 2006 and 2010, the Presbyterian Warsaw Korean Church was built at 63D Farbiarska Street.\nBetween 2015 and 2023, St. Sophia of Holy Wisdom Church, belonging to the Polish Orthodox denomination, was built at 568 Puławska Street. It became the first Orthodox church to be constructed in Warsaw, in over 100 years.\nOverview\nJeziorki is a low-rise single-family residential area with detached and semi-detached houses. It also has farmlands. The area consists several smaller neighbourhoods, including Dawidy Zwykłe, Dawidy Poduchowne, Karczunek, Ludwinów, Jeziorki Polskie, Nowe Jeziorki, and Zgorzała nad Jeziorem.\nThe neighbourhood also includes two railway stations, Warszawa Jeziorki at the corner of Karczunkowska Street and Gogolińska Street, and Warszawa Dawidy at Baletowa Street.
