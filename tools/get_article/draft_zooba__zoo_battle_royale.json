      "text": "# Draft:Zooba: Zoo Battle Royale\n\n| genre = Third-person shooter, battle royale\n| modes = Singleplayer, multiplayer\n}}\nZooba is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by [https://wildlifestudios.com Wildlife Studios]. It was globally released on platforms iOS and Android on October 2, 2019.\nZooba takes place in a zoo where players are customizable, anthropomorphic animals. Players have to battle using various weapons found in the map until one player (or team) remains.\nGameplay\nGame modes\nThe game features a total of five game modes; Standard Solo, Mini Solo, Duo, Squad, and Deathmatch.\nStandard Solo\nStandard Solo (stylized as SOLO | Standard in-game) is the main mode of the game and is the mode that is played in the tutorial matches. It has 35/45-player free-for-all matches, where every player will fight against each other until one remains.\nMini Solo\nMini Solo (stylized as SOLO | Mini in-game) is similar to Standard Solo, except for the map and player amount being smaller.\nDuo\nDuo (stylized as TEAM | Duo in-game) is similar to the Standard Solo game mode, except that it has teams. Each team is composed of two players. When a player from a team is downed, their other teammate has the ability to revive them by going up to them and wait until the translucent circle below the downed player is fully green. When a player is downed and all of their other teammates are downed, they are automatically eliminated. The reviving process can be done immediately via the Defibrillator item.\nSquad\nSquad (stylized as BIG TEAMS | Squad in-game) is similar to the Duo game mode, except that the player amount per team is increased to five.\nDeathmatch\nDeathmatch (stylized as DEATHMATCH | 3x3 deathmatch in-game) is a 3v3 deathmatch game mode where two opposing teams have the objective of eliminating the other team. When a player from a team is eliminated, the eliminating team's score is incremented by one. There are two ways for a team to win—by achieving a total score of 15, or by having the largest score by the time limit. The legendary weapon is dropped every so often to give the possessing team an advantage. It is lost when the possessing player is eliminated. The legendary weapon can be spawned and picked up even when a player currently possesses one.\nMaps\nThe game has 3 maps for Mini and Standard Solo, Duo, and Squad—Central Zoo, Volcanic Park, and Zoo Rail. Each map has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the character a player uses.\nWeapons\nThe game features four weapon types; the spear, the bow, the bomb, and the shotgun. The game also has five rarities—common, bronze, silver, gold, and legendary.\nTo obtain a weapon, the player must either explore the map to gather weapons, or eliminate guards.\nNon-player enemies\nGuards are non-playable characters in the game with the objective to eliminate a character if seen. All regular guards hold all weapon rarities except for the legendary rarity. The Legendary Guard holds the single legendary weapon. This guard holds all four types of weapons at legendary rarity. However, when the Legendary Guard is eliminated, the only weapon they drop is the weapon they were holding at the time of being eliminated.\nSkill tree and leveling\nCharacters can be upgraded via the skill tree. The skill tree is composed of weapon skill points and weapon damage upgrades. Each upgrade can be bought with coins. When a specific level's upgrades have all been bought, the character must be leveled up before purchasing upgrades. Currently, the max level in the skill tree is level 20.\nCurrency\nCoins and gems can be found in various methods. Coins can be found in toolboxes and crates, in the Maze of Treasures, in the Path of Paws, the in-game store, the battle pass, and more. Gems can be found in the in-game store, in clans, in the battle pass, in the Path of Paws and more. Coins can be used to purchase character tokens, character upgrades, and more. Gems can be used to unlock characters, purchase character skins, and more.\nDevelopment and release\nAfter its initial beta release in Brazil on September 17, 2019, Zooba opened to pre-registration on September 22, 2019 before releasing on October 2, 2019 globally.\nReception\nAs of October, 2025, the game has received a 4.7 star rating on the App Store website, and a 4.3 star rating on Google Play website across multiple devices.\nCritical response\nIn some critical reviews, the game has been disliked for its occasional unfair matchmaking, and its pay-to-win system.\nReferences"
