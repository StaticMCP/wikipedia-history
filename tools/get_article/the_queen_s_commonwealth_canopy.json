By 2016, 16 countries had become involved and, by 2023, the number was 54.\nOrigins\nThe idea was conceived in the 2000s by Member of Parliament Frank Field, but, was met by apathy from the political establishment. When he raised the idea at a Buckingham Palace meeting, the concept found support from Queen Elizabeth II. It is the first environmental enterprise the Queen gave her name to. After approval and endorsement by the QCC, the projects are added to the network and \"placed under the protection of the Queen herself.\"\nLaunch\nThe initiative was officially launched at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta in 2015. The Queen said, \"this, and other initiatives, are a practical demonstration of the power of the Commonwealth, working as a group, to effect real change for generations to come.\" At that time, seven countries were involved, with Singapore being the first, which was acknowledged by Princess Anne, Princess Royal, during a visit there.\nThe three organisations behind the project are The Royal Commonwealth Society (RCS), the Commonwealth Forestry Association, and Cool Earth and its aim is to establish a global network of protected indigenous forests, through \"raising awareness within the Commonwealth of the value of indigenous forests and to saving them for future generations\"; generating \"a unique network of forest conservation projects that brings collective credibility and integrity to individual Commonwealth countries\"; raising \"the profile of the Commonwealth, demonstrating the capacity of its 56 member countries to act together as one to ensure forest conservation\"; using \"the Commonwealth network to facilitate knowledge exchange, share best practice, and create new collaborative initiatives for forest conservation\"; and creating \"a physical and lasting legacy of The Queen's leadership of the Commonwealth\".\nProgress\nITV broadcast ''The Queen's Green Planet'' in April 2018, highlighting many of the initiatives around the world interspersed with footage of the Queen and Sir David Attenborough discussing trees in the gardens of Buckingham Palace; By this time, more than 40 countries had committed to taking part in the initiative. it showcased the \"personal stake the royal family and other prominent ambassadors have in conservation efforts.\" By mid-2019, the number had reached 46 countries. The RCS stated in 2023 that 54 countries were committed to the QCC, bringing 115 sites and projects, totalling some 12 million hectares (29,652,646 acres) of forest, under its umbrella.\nIn addition to its three sites within the QCC, Australia contributes via the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, which is part of the country's foreign aid program.\nProjects\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
