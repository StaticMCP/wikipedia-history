      "text": "# Timeline of Amazon Web Services\n\nThis is a timeline of Amazon Web Services, which offers a suite of cloud computing services that make up an on-demand computing platform.\nBackground and development\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Month and date (if available) !! Event type !! Details\n|-\n| 2000 || || Prelude || Amazon.com, the parent company of the as yet nonexistent Amazon Web Services (AWS), begins work on merchant.com, an e-commerce platform intended for use by other large retailers such as Target Corporation. In the process, Amazon's team realizes that they need to decouple their code better, with cleaner interfaces and access APIs. Around the same time, the company also realizes the need to build infrastructure as a service internally, to improve the speed of development and not have it bottlenecked by infrastructure availability. All these changes help pave the way for AWS.\n|-\n| 2003 || || Prelude || Benjamin Black and Chris Pinkham write a short paper describing a vision for Amazon infrastructure that, in Black's words, \"was completely standardized, completely automated, and relied extensively on web services for things like storage.\"\n|-\n| 2004 || || Prelude || Jeff Bezos approves the idea of experimenting with Amazon infrastructure. Pinkham leaves for South Africa to set up a satellite development office. While there, he works on a pilot along with help from Chris Brown and Willem van Biljon. Although the team works from South Africa, the servers are hosted in the United States.\n|-\n| 2004 || November 9 || Customer outreach || The Amazon Web Services blog is launched, with a first blog post by Jeff Barr. At the time, the name Amazon Web Services refers to a collection of APIs and tools to access the Amazon.com catalog, rather than the infrastructure as a service it would eventually become.\n|-\n| 2005 || || Prelude || A private precursor to AWS launches, with a small number of customers. At the same time, Amazon begins planning for a public launch of AWS. Based on internal discussions, they decide to launch storage, compute, and database offerings so that developers can use all of them together.\n|}\nOperation\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=isoDate |Year\n!

Year !! Month and date (if available) !! Event type !! Details\n|-\n| 2011 || April 21 || Outage || At 12:47&nbsp;am PDT on April 21, an invalid traffic shift prior to network upgrade caused EBS instances to lose connectivity to one another with an availability zone of us-east-1 region. Once the errors were localized to just one availability zone, the EBS recovery These connectivity errors impacted EBS volume and EC2 instances in multiple availability zones and caused issues for customers until full recovery at 3:00&nbsp;pm PDT on April 24.\n|-\n| 2011 || August 7 || Outage || Power lost in Ireland, EU West region, causing disruption and outage \"service disruption began at 10:41 AM PDT on August 7th\" (also mentioned but distinct from the outage mentioned above; it happened around the same time as the US outage). Due to followup issues, full restoration of e g EBS and RDS took in the order of days.\n|-\n| 2011 || August 8 || Outage || EC2 went down around 10:25&nbsp;p.m. Eastern in Amazon's us-east-1 Region. The cloud outage lasted roughly 30 minutes, but took down the Web sites and services of many major Amazon cloud customers, including Netflix, Reddit and Foursquare. The issue happened in the networks that connect the Availability Zones to the Internet and was primarily caused by a software bug in the router.\n|-\n| 2012 || June 29 || Service disruption || A major disruption occurs to the EC2, EBS, and RDS services in a single availability zone (due to a large scale electrical storm which swept through the Northern Virginia area).\n|-\n| 2012 || October 22 || Outage || A major outage occurs (due to latent memory leak bug in an operational data collection agent), affecting many sites such as Reddit, Foursquare, Pinterest, and others.\n|-\n| 2012 || December 24 || Outage || AWS suffers an outage, causing websites such as Netflix instant video to be unavailable for customers in the Northeastern United States.\n|-\n| 2013 || September 13 || Outage || AWS us-east-1 region experienced network connectivity issues affecting instances in a single Availability Zone. We also experienced increased error rates and latencies for the EBS APIs and increased error rates for EBS-backed instance launches.\n|-\n| 2014 || November 26 || Service disruption || Amazon CloudFront DNS server went down for two hours, starting at 7:15&nbsp;p.m. EST. The DNS server was back up just after 9 p.m. Some websites and cloud services were knocked offline as the content delivery network failed to fulfill DNS requests during the outage. Nothing major, but worthy of this list because it involved the world's biggest and longest-running cloud.\n|-\n| 2015 || September 20 || Outage || The Amazon DynamoDB service experiences an outage in an availability zone in the us-east-1 (North Virginia) region, due to a power outage and inadequate failover procedures. The outage, which occurs on a Sunday morning, lasts for about five hours (with some residual impact till Monday) and affects a number of related Amazon services include Simple Queue Service, EC2 autoscaling, Amazon CloudWatch, and the online AWS console. A number of customers are negatively affected, including Netflix, but Netflix is able to recover quickly because of its strong disaster recovery procedures.\n|-\n| 2016 || June 5 || Outage || AWS Sydney experiences an outage for several hours as a result of severe thunderstorms in the region causing a power outage to the data centers.\n|-\n| 2017 || February 28 || Outage || Amazon experiences an outage of S3 in us-east-1. There are also related outages for other services in us-east-1 including CloudFormation, autoscaling, Elastic MapReduce, Simple Email Service, and Simple Workflow Service. A number of websites and services using S3, such as Medium, Slack, Imgur and Trello, are affected. AWS's own status dashboard initially fails to reflect the change properly due to a dependency on S3. On March 2, AWS reveals that the outage was caused by an incorrect parameter passed in by an authorized employee while running an established playbook, that ended up deleting more instances than the employee intended.\n|-\n| 2018 || March 2 || Service degradation || Starting 6:25 AM PST, Direct Connect experienced connectivity issues related to a power outage issue in their us-east-1 Region. This caused customers to have service interruptions in reaching their EC2 instances. Issue was resolved fully by 10:26 AM PST.\n|-\n| 2018 || May 31 || Outage || Beginning at 2:52&nbsp;pm PDT a small percentage of EC2 servers lost power in a single Availability Zone in the us-east-1 Region. This resulted in some impaired EC2 instances and degraded performance for some EBS volumes in the affected Availability Zone. Power was restored at 3:22&nbsp;pm PDT.\n|-\n| 2019 || August 23 || Outage || A number of EC2 servers in the Tokyo region shut down due to overheating at 12:36&nbsp;pm local time, due to a failure in the datacenter control and cooling system.\n|-\n| 2019 || August 31 || Outage and data loss || A us-east-1 data center suffered a power failure at 4:33&nbsp;am local time, and the backup generators failed at 6&nbsp;am. According to AWS, this affected 7.5 percent of the EC2 instances in one of the ten data centers in one of the six Availability Zones in us-east-1. However, after restoring power, a number of EBS volumes, which store the filesystems of the EC2 cloud servers, were permanently unrecoverable. This caused downtime for companies such as Reddit.\n|-\n| 2019 || October 22–23 || Service degradation from DDoS || AWS sustained a distributed denial of service attack which caused intermittent DNS resolution errors (for their Route 53 DNS service) from 10:30&nbsp;am PST to 6:30&nbsp;pm PST.\n|-\n| 2020 || November 25 || Outage || Beginning at 9:52&nbsp;am PST the Kinesis Data Streams API became impaired in the us-east-1 Region. This prevented customers from reading or writing data.\n|-\n| 2021 || December 7 || Outage || Beginning at 10:45&nbsp;am PST \"an impairment of several network devices\" in the us-east-1 Region caused widespread errors in all AWS services. The root cause has been mitigated by 4:35 PM PST, but service recovery was still underway causing localized ongoing impairment.\n|-\n| 2021 || December 15 || Outage || Region us-west-1 was unavailable for about 30 minutes.\n|-\n| 2021 || December 22 || Outage and potential data loss || Power loss in us-east-1 for about 1 hour, followed by extended recovery procedures. AWS attributed the failure to a single availability zone, USE1-AZ4.\n|-\n|2023\n|June 13\n|Outage\n|Beginning at 11:49 am PDT, customers experienced increased error rates and latencies for AWS Lambda function invocations within the Northern Virginia (us-east-1) Region. By 3:37 pm PDT, the AWS Lambda service and all dependent service resumed normal operations.\n|-\n| 2025 || October 20 || Outage || Beginning at 12:11 am PDT, customers experienced increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services within the Northern Virginia (us-east-1) Region. A number of websites and services such as Roblox, Fortnite, Snapchat, and Duolingo were affected. The outage was caused by a bug in the DynamoDB DNS management system.\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Amazon products and services\n* History of Amazon\nReferences"
