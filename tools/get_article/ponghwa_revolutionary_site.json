Kim Hyong-jik lived in Ponghwa between mid-March 1916 and November 1917. At that time, he was teaching at the nearby Myongsin School. Kim had helped founding the school. According to North Korean tradition, Kim helped organizing resistance to the Japanese occupation of Korea in Ponghwa by holding secret meetings of various clandestine groups. These efforts culminated in the establishment of the Korean National Association.\nThe site consists of the school, a statue of Kim Hyong-jik, a monument to his revolutionary activities, the Pisok-gye Monument, ground for morning exercises, the Rock Floor, the Maekjon Ferry, dwellings, a shallow well, and a place on Mount Ponghwa were secret meetings were held. The Ponghwa-ri Revolutionary Museum on the premises opened in 2004 houses historical artifacts related to Kim Hyong-jik.\nIn 2009, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) put visitor figures as follows: \"During the past more than four decades since the revolutionary site was opened to visitors it has drawn nearly 16 million people.\" , more than 1.7 million people have visited the site since 2000.\nSee also\n* Ponghwa Clinic&nbsp;– nearby hospital\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*"
