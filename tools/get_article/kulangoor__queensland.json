It is one of the many Australian Big Things. It was sculpted by Hugh Anderson, who also sculpted the Big Bulls in Rockhampton. The Big Cow is seven times the size of an Ayrshire cow on which it is modelled. It is made of concrete and described as \"able to withstand a cyclone\". After the dairy farm closed, the Big Cow remained on the property which was used for a variety of purposes. In March 2016, the Big Cow was described as \"closed and fallen into disrepair\". On 10 January 2020, the Big Cow was moved to the Highfields Pioneer Village complex near Toowoomba, where it was restored and officially reopened on 20 September 2020.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links"
