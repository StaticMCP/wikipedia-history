As the French colony of Middle Congo (Moyen-Congo) also chose the name Republic of Congo upon receiving its independence, the two countries were more commonly known as Congo-Léopoldville and Congo-Brazzaville, after their capital cities.\nThe United States immediately recognized the new Republic of the Congo and moved to establish diplomatic relations. The embassy in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) was established on June 30, 1960, with John D. Tomlinson as Chargé d'Affaires ad interim. The first ambassador, Clare H. Timberlake was appointed on July 5, 1960.\nIn 1971, President Joseph-Désiré Mobutu changed the country’s official name to Zaire.\nIn 1997, President Laurent Kabila restored the name \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\", previously used from 1964 to 1971.\nAmbassadors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!style=\"width: 200px;\" |Title\n!Appointed\n!Presented credentials\n!Terminated mission\n!Notes\n|-\n|Clare H.
