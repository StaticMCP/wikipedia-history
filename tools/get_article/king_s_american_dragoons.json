They were founded by Colonel Benjamin Thompson, later Count Rumford, in 1781. They were initially formed from the remnants of other British Loyalist units, including Black Loyalist soldiers.\nThe King's American Dragoons primarily served on Long Island in 1782 and early 1783, where they dismantled the church and burial ground to build defenses in Huntington.\nThey were evacuated from New York and resettled in Saint John, New Brunswick, in July 1783.  They were disbanded there in October.\nReferences"
