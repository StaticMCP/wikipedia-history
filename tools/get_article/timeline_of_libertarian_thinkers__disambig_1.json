Originally coined by French anarchist and libertarian communist Joseph Déjacque as an alternative synonymous to anarchism, American classical liberals appropriated the term in the 1950s for their philosophy which asserts that individuals have a right to acquire, keep and exchange their holdings and that the primary purpose of government is to protect these rights. As a result of this history, libertarians on this list may be either of the American-style free-market variety or of the European-style socialist variety.\nLibertarian thinkers\n* John Ball (1338–1381): English priest whose preachings against bondship and serfdom helped start the Peasants' Revolt.\n* Étienne de La Boétie (1530–1563): French judge, writer and a founder of modern political philosophy in France.\n* John Locke (1632–1704): English Philosopher and one of the most influential enlightenment thinkers who proclaimed Man has the Freedom to possess himself.
