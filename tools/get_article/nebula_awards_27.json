It was first published in hardcover and trade paperback by Harcourt Brace in April 1993.\nSummary\nThe book collects pieces that won or were nominated for the Nebula Awards for novel, novella, novelette and short story for the year 1992, various nonfiction pieces related to the awards, and tributes to recently deceased author Isaac Asimov, together with the two Rhysling Award-winning poems for 1991 and one of the two for 1992 (because it also received a Nebula nomination for Best Short Story), and an introduction by the editor. Not all nominees for the various awards are included.\nContents\n*\"Introduction\" (James Morrow)\n*\"Science Fiction for What?

Warren's assessment of the year in film is rated as \"knowledgeable,\" Sterling's \"attempt to foresee the fictional shape of the 90's\" as \"suitably provocative,\" and the lists of recommended books and stories as perhaps \"the most valuable feature here,\" an \"excellent way for the occasional reader to get a sample of the current trends in sf, especially since only two entries here are in other 'best-of-the-year' collections for 1991.\"\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Russell Letson in Locus no. 390, July 1993, Joseph Milicia in The New York Review of Science Fiction, July 1993, and Tom Easton in Analog Science Fiction and Fact, October 1993.\nAwards\nThe book placed eighth in the 1994 Locus Poll Award for Best Anthology.\nNotes"
