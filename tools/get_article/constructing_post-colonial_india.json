From 1989 through 1993, Srivastava conducted field research at the school, and he interviewed parents and teachers as well as the school's graduates. The book's main argument is that to be post-colonial in India necessitates the espousal of values such as secularism, rationalism, and a modernity that is not Occidental-inspired, but is contextual to the country.\nSee also\n*Colonial India\n*Postcolonialism\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.routledge.com/Constructing-Post-Colonial-India-National-Character-and-the-Doon-School/Srivastava/p/book/9780415178563 Official page - Routledge UK]"
