Nominations were announced on March 15, 2018.\nBlack Panther led the nominations for film with fourteen, becoming the second most nominated film in the awards' history behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) with fifteen, as the former scored nominations in every category for eligibility (2019's Avengers: Endgame would also receive fourteen nominations the following ceremony, sharing Black Panthers nomination record as the second/third most nominated film in the awards' history). It was followed by Star Wars: The Last Jedi with thirteen nominations, and Blade Runner 2049 and The Shape of Water with nine nominations each.\nThe Walking Dead led the nominations for television for the fourth year in a row with seven, followed by streaming newcomer Star Trek: Discovery and the limited series Twin Peaks: The Return with five each. Seven individuals earned two nominations each, including double writing nominations for Michael Green (for his work on Blade Runner 2049 and Logan, sharing the nods with other writers), and two acting nominations for both film and television for Danai Gurira (for her performances in Black Panther and The Walking Dead, winning for the former).\nFor film, Black Panther won the most awards with five, including Best Comic-to-Motion Picture Release and Best Film Director (Ryan Coogler), followed by Star Wars: The Last Jedi with three and Coco with two. For television, Better Call Saul and Twin Peaks: The Return won the most awards with three each (ending The Walking Deads four-year long streak as the top-winning series), followed by Star Trek: Discovery and The Walking Dead with two each. However, Rian Johnson's win for Best Writing for Star Wars: The Last Jedi caused some backlash from fans, who expressed their disdain with the decision on Twitter.\nOther notable wins include Mark Hamill's record-tying third Best Actor in a Film win for Star Wars: The Last Jedi (thirty-four years after his second win for 1983's Return of the Jedi), making him the first person to have won three Saturn Awards for the same role in film (Robert Downey Jr. would tie this record the following year for 2019's Avengers: Endgame), and Tom Holland's second consecutive win for Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Film for Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), making him the first performer to win the category twice for the same role or to win it in two consecutive years; Holland won a third the following year for 2019's Spider-Man: Far From Home, surpassing his own record.\nWinners and nominees\nFilm\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Comic-to-Motion Picture Release\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Science Fiction Film Release\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Black Panther\n** Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\n** Logan\n** Spider-Man: Homecoming\n** Thor: Ragnarok\n** Wonder Woman\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Blade Runner 2049\n** Alien: Covenant\n** Life\n** Star Wars: The Last Jedi\n** Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\n** War for the Planet of the Apes\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Fantasy Film Release\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Horror Film Release\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Shape of Water\n** Beauty and the Beast\n** Downsizing\n** Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\n** Kong: Skull Island\n** Paddington 2\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Get Out\n** 47 Meters Down\n** Annabelle: Creation\n** Better Watch Out\n** It\n** Mother!\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Action / Adventure Film Release\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Thriller Film Release\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Greatest Showman\n** Baby Driver\n** Dunkirk\n** The Fate of the Furious\n** Hostiles\n** Kingsman: The Golden Circle\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n** Brawl in Cell Block 99\n** Murder on the Orient Express\n** The Post\n** Suburbicon\n** Wind River\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Animated Film Release\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best International Film Release\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Coco\n** The Boss Baby\n** Cars 3\n** Despicable Me 3\n** Your Name\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Baahubali 2: The Conclusion\n** Brimstone\n** The Lodgers\n** The Man Who Invented Christmas\n** The Square\n** Wolf Warrior 2\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Film Director\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Film Writing\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Ryan Coogler – Black Panther'\n** Guillermo del Toro – The Shape of Water\n** Patty Jenkins – Wonder Woman\n** Rian Johnson – Star Wars: The Last Jedi\n** Jordan Peele – Get Out\n** Matt Reeves – War for the Planet of the Apes\n** Denis Villeneuve – Blade Runner 2049\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi – Rian Johnson'\n** Black Panther – Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole\n** Blade Runner 2049 – Michael Green and Hampton Fancher\n** Get Out – Jordan Peele\n** Logan – Scott Frank, Michael Green, and James Mangold\n** The Shape of Water – Guillermo del Toro and Vanessa Taylor\n** Wonder Woman – Jason Fuchs, Allan Heinberg, and Zack Snyder\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Actor in a Film\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Actress in a Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Mark Hamill – Star Wars: The Last Jedi as Luke Skywalker'\n** Chadwick Boseman – Black Panther as T'Challa / Black Panther\n** Ryan Gosling – Blade Runner 2049 as K\n** Hugh Jackman – Logan as Logan / X-24\n** Daniel Kaluuya – Get Out as Chris Washington\n** Andy Serkis – War for the Planet of the Apes as Caesar\n** Vince Vaughn – Brawl in Cell Block 99 as Bradley Thomas\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Gal Gadot – Wonder Woman as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman'\n** Sally Hawkins – The Shape of Water as Elisa Esposito\n** Frances McDormand – Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri as Mildred Hayes\n** Lupita Nyong'o – Black Panther as Nakia\n** Rosamund Pike – Hostiles as Rosalee Quaid\n** Daisy Ridley – Star Wars: The Last Jedi as Rey\n** Emma Watson – Beauty and the Beast as Belle\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Supporting Actor in a Film\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Supporting Actress in a Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Patrick Stewart – Logan as Charles Xavier / Professor X'\n** Harrison Ford – Blade Runner 2049 as Rick Deckard\n** Michael B.
