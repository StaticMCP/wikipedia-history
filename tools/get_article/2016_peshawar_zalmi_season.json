Their winning run ended after losing a close match against the underdogs of 2016 PSL Quetta Gladiators. after completing group stage matches they won six from eight matches losing against Lahore Qalandars in a close match and Quetta Gladiators they finished first in points table qualifying for the play-offs where they played against Quetta Gladiators in Qualifier 1. The first qualifier of the inaugural Pakistan Super League was a nail-biting affair and came down to the last ball, with Quetta Gladiators holding their nerve to clinch one run win. Gladiators posted 133 thanks to Kevin Pietersen (53) well supported by Kumar Sangakkara (37) after disastrous start, in reply Peshawar scoring 132 in their 20 Overs Darren Sammy's 38 from 29 could not save the team. Zalmi were left needing eight runs from six balls;Gladiators required three wickets. A dot off the first ball of the over, bowled by Aizaz Cheema, titled the contest further Quetta's way. However, Wahab Riaz seemed to emerge an unlikely hero for Zalmi, slamming the second ball – a low full toss outside off – over cow corner for four. He then proceeded to take a single. Three needed off three, and it was anybody's game. Cheema, though, drastically turned the fate of the match with his next two deliveries. First Hasan Ali was out caught and bowled. Then, Wahab swung wildly in an attempt to finish the game, but ended up skying the ball straight to Ahmed Shehzad at point. Cheema was on a hat-trick and Muhammad Asghar had the unenviable task of striking the last ball for at least three. Cheema did not get his hat-trick, but more importantly, Asghar was unable to put the bowler's rising short ball away as a result Aizaz Cheema became hero for Gladiators who qualified for the Final. Gladiators' Mohammad Nawaz was judged man of the match against Zalmi for his 3 for 27 and 20 runs. Islamabad United qualified for 2016 Pakistan Super League Final match by defeating Zalmi. United set 177 runs target for Zalmi after being asked to bat first. United's batsman Sharjeel Khan's 117 from 62 balls against Zalmi's strong bowling line-up proved to be the difference between them and United. Zalmi only managed 126 runs after a blistering inning from Shahid Afridi in the end of 38 from 17 balls and earlier Kamran Akmal scored 45 from 32 balls. As a result of this loss they were eliminated from the tournament. Wahab Riaz with 15 wickets was the leading wicket-taker for the team. Tamim Iqbal with 267 runs was the team's leading run scorer.\nSeason standings\nMatch log\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Match\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Venue\n!Result\n!Scorecard\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 1 || 5 February || Islamabad United || Dubai International Cricket Stadium || Won by 24 runs||[http://espncricinfo.com//ci/engine/match/959179.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 2 || 6 February || Lahore Qalandars || Dubai International Cricket Stadium ||Won by 9 wickets|| [http://espncricinfo.com//ci/engine/match/959183.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n| 3 || 7 February|| Quetta Gladiators || Dubai International Cricket Stadium || Lost by 3 wickets||[http://espncricinfo.com//ci/engine/match/959187.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 4 || 11 February || Karachi Kings || Sharjah Cricket Stadium || Won by 3 runs||[http://espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/959193.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 5 || 12 February || Islamabad United || Sharjah Cricket Stadium || Won by 7 wickets || [http://espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/959199.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n| 6|| 13 February || Lahore Qalandars || Sharjah Cricket Stadium || Lost by 4 runs || [http://espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/959203.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 7|| 14 February || Quetta Gladiators || Sharjah Cricket Stadium || Won by 8 wickets|| [http://espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/959207.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 8 || 17 February || Karachi Kings || Dubai International Cricket Stadium || Won by 5 wickets || [http://espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/959211.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n| 9 || 19 February || Quetta Gladiators (Qualifier 1) || Dubai International Cricket Stadium || Lost by 1 run||[http://espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/959215.html Scoreard]\n|- style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n| 10 || 21 February || Islamabad United (Qualifier 2) || Dubai International Cricket Stadium || Lost by 50 runs||[http://espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/959219.html Scoreard]\n|}\nReferences"
