An allied army of Saxons, Swedes, and Brandenburgers invaded Silesia with 21,000 troops, encountering an Imperial army of 20,000 at Ścinawa (). The resulting battle was a major allied victory.\nBackground\nFollowing the victory at Breitenfeld the Saxons retook their territory and invaded Lusatia.  The Swedish army took over large parts of Germany and won yet another victory at the Battle of Rain. To improve his own position in the alliance with Sweden, Johann Georg, the elector of Saxony, ordered to invade Silesia with 12,000 Saxons and 2,000 Brandenburgers under the command of Hans Georg von Arnim-Boitzenburg. Arnim′s army was supported by 7,000 Swedish under the command of Jacob Duwall. The Imperials under the command of the elderly Spanish marshal Baltasar Marradas hurriedly gathered 20,000 men at Steinau, an important crossing on the Oder river.\nBattle\nMarradas’s men entrenched on the Gallows Hill, south-east of Steinau, between it and the river, and posted cavalry on the Sand Hill west of the town to watch the approach. Musketeers occupied the Geisendorf suburb to the west and a nearby churchyard. The advances gained of the allies under firebrand Duwall arrived at midday on August 29, and immediately engaged the imperial cavalry. After two hours of skirmishing the Imperialists retreated into the marshy Kalterbach Valley south of Steinau. Saxon artillery had now arrived on the Sand Hill, compelling the cavalry to retreat further into Marradas’s camp, exposing the musketeers.  Duwall’s younger brother led 1,000 Swedish and  musketeers who stormed the suburb and churchyard. The imperials set the town on fire to forestall further attack, virtually destroying it. Duwall wanted to press on, but Arnim was still negotiating with the enemy on the Gallows Hill.\nArnim did not assault the camp the next day, but marched south to Dieban further upstream where he constructed a bridge, intending to cross and cut Marradas off from the other side. Maraddas reacted belatedly by an attack on Dieban. However, he was repelled on September 4 and retreated. He left a small detachment at Steinau bridge to delay pursuit. The Swedish-Saxon allies suffered only slight losses, whereas the Imperials lost 6,000, mostly men who had fled the initial skirmish or been taken prisoner.\nAftermath\nFollowing the battle, Arnim pressed on and took Breslau and Schweidnitz where he reverted re-Catholicization measures. The Imperialists were driven into the mountains. Arnim had conquered Silesia with fewer men and against greater odds than Frederick the Great's celebrated invasion in 1740.\nWallenstein decided to punish Saxony, so he sent General Heinrich Holk with 10,000 men to ravage Saxony.\nSee also\n*Siege of Nuremberg\nFootnotes\nReferences\nSources\n*"
