It was released on 13 November 2012 and December 2012 for iPhone, iPod and iPad, January 2013 for Android, and January 2014 for Google Play. The game's successor, the My Talking Angela game, was released in December 2014.\nThe game takes place in a café in Paris and allows players to interact with Angela in different ways. Players can use coins to purchase makeup, accessories and items, as well as drinks that will trigger different visual effects. The fortune cookie button causes Angela to read out a fortune cookie, while the bird icon will prompt birds to fly around the screen, or have Angela feed them. Players can also pet or poke Angela, as well the café's sign.\nPrior to their removal, the game featured a chat system and a camera button. Users can engage in conversations with Angela, ask for quizzes or initiate a short snippet of the song \"That's Falling In Love\". If the player was to type in \"who is an idiot?\", Angela would respond with a random swear word. Additionally, inquiring Angela about sexual topics would cause her to reply with \"do you want to talk about sex?\", though she will quickly change the topic regardless of what the player writes next.\nDue to the pedophile hoax, Angela received a blue dress, as well as a different eye reflection.\nPedophile hoax\nIn February 2014, Talking Angela was the subject of an Internet hoax alleging that the application encouraged children to disclose personal information about themselves, which is ostensibly then used by pedophiles to identify the location of these children. The rumor, which was widely circulated on Facebook and various websites claiming to be dedicated to parenting, claims that Angela, the game's main character, asks the game's user for private personal information using the game's text-chat feature. Other versions of the rumor even attribute the disappearance of a child to the game, or claim that it is run by a  pedophile ring, while some go so far as to even claim that the user is recorded by the camera and can be seen in Angela's eyes.\nIt was debunked by Snopes.com soon afterwards. The site's owners, Barbara and David Mikkelson, reported that they had tried to \"prompt\" it to give responses asking for private information but were unsuccessful, even when asking it explicitly sexual questions. While it is true that, in the game with child mode off, Angela does ask for the user's name, age and personal preferences to determine conversation topics, Outfit7 has said that this information is all \"anonymized\" and all personal information is removed from it. It is also impossible for a person to take control of what Angela says in the game, since the game is based on chat bot software.\nIn 2015, the hoax was revived on Facebook, prompting online security company Sophos and The Guardian to debunk it again. Sophos employee Paul Ducklin wrote on the company's blog that the message being posted on Facebook promoting the hoax was \"close to 600 rambling, repetitious words, despite claiming at the start that it didn’t have words to describe the situation. It's ill-written, and borders on being illiterate and incomprehensible.\" Bruce Wilcox, one of the game's programmers, has attributed the hoax's popularity to the fact that the chatbot program in Talking Angela is so realistic.\nHowever, genuine concern has been raised that the game's child mode may be too easy for children to turn off, which, if they did, would allow them to purchase \"coins\", which can be used as currency in the game, via iTunes. Disabling child mode also enables the chat feature, which, while it is not \"connecting your children to pedophilles\", still raises concerns as well, according to Stuart Dredge, a journalist from The Guardian. Dredge wrote that in chat mode, Angela asks for information such as the user's name.\nImpact\nThe scare has significantly boosted the game's popularity, and is credited with helping the app make it into the top 10 free iPhone apps soon after the hoax became widely known in February 2015 and 3rd most popular for all iPhone apps at the start of the following month. In 2016, Outfit7 removed the chat feature along with the camera function from the app due to this controversy, though this decision was met with criticism.\nSee also\n* Talking Tom & Friends\n* My Talking Tom\nReferences"
