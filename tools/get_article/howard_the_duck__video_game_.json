The game is a tie-in to the film Howard the Duck from the same year.\nGameplay\nThe game involves players controlling Howard the Duck to save his best friends, Phil and Beverly. After being parachuted to Volcano Island, Howard needs to find a backpack to proceed with the search. The game consists then of four levels, in the last of which Howard, armed with a neutron gun, will finally face Overlord.\nReception\nLike the film, the game also received fairly negative reviews. Computer Gamer gave an overall 55%, by stating \"beautifully presented, and well-programmed, it rates as one of Activision's better recent releases and deserves consideration outside its unfortunate tie-in\", predicting, however, low longevity. Aktueller Software Markt described the game as not fulfilling the expectancies and not worth the money.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://uk.ign.com/games/howard-the-duck/zx-830834 Howard the Duck] at IGN\n*[http://www.mobygames.com/game/howard-the-duck Howard the Duck] at MobyGames"
