Although the moniker Singapore may suggest a representation of all radio stations in Singapore, the nominations are only open to MediaCorp Radio stations.\nHistory\nPrior to the Singapore Radio Awards (SRA), the three Chinese radio stations (Y.E.S. 93.3FM, Capital 95.8FM and Love 97.2FM) under MediaCorp held their own Golden Mike Awards (GMA). The last GMA was held in 2004 and the SRA was born a few months later to encompass stations from all four languages that MediaCorp broadcast in: English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil.\nThe first SRA was held in 2005, and was renamed MediaCorp Radio Awards (MRA) in 2013.\nCeremony\nThe first Singapore Radio Awards ceremony was held in 2004 at Raffles City Convention Centre. It was a trade event, whereby clients of MediaCorp were invited for a formal sit-down dinner. Listeners were not invited to the show.\nThe second SRA was held in 2005 in Shangri La Hotel's Island Ballroom. The third SRA was held at the same location in 2006. Similarly, only trade clients were invited.\nThe fourth SRA, in 2007, was held at Suntec Convention Centre. For the first time, listeners were invited to purchase tickets to attend. All nominees were involved in the opening sequence.\nThe SRA was not held in 2008 and 2009.\nSingapore Radio Awards 2010 was held in MediaCorp's TV Theatre, with a live webcast on its official site. Florence Lian, former radio DJ and Singapore Idol judge, currently MediaCorp's Managing Director for Radio, opened the show with a monologue. The hosts were Vernon A and Justin Ang from 987FM. Award presenters included Irene Ang, Bobby Tonelli, as well as MediaCorp's senior management. 987FM were the biggest winners for the night, sweeping \"Best Radio Show\", \"Most Creative English Trailer\", and \"Best Radio Personality Blog\".\nSingapore Radio Awards 2011 was telecast live on Channel 5.\nMediaCorp Radio Awards 2013 was to be held on 15 November. The show was to be telecast live on Channel 5.\nNomination\nAll weekday presenters were automatically nominated for the \"Most Popular DJ\" Award for the respective stations. The results are based on SMS polling.\nNominees for other awards were selected by a panel of professionals in the industry.\nAwards\nBest Radio Show\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Producer\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Radio Show\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Language\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Station\n|-\n| 2005\n| Lin Lingzhi\n| Music Diary\n| Chinese\n| Y.E.S. 93.3FM\n|-\n| 2006\n| Dongfang Billy\n| Heart to Heart\n| Chinese\n| Love 97.2FM\n|-\n| 2010\n| The Muttons\n| Muttons to Midnight\n| English\n| 987FM\n|-\n| 2011\n| The Muttons\n| Muttons on the Move\n| English\n| 987FM\n|}\nRadio Personality of the Year (Media's Choice)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | English Stations\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Chinese Stations\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Malay Stations\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Tamil Stations\n|-\n| 2005\n| Glenn Ong\n| Marcus Chin\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| Glenn Ong\n| Dongfang Billy\n| Suriani\n| Mohd Rafi\n|-\n| 2007\n| Glenn Ong\n| Dennis Chew\n| AB Shaik\n| Saravanan\n|-\n| 2010\n| Glenn Ong\n| Dennis Chew\n| AB Shaik\n| Vimala\n|}\nEnglish Stations Most Popular DJ\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Gold 90.5FM\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Class 95FM\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | 987FM\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | 938LIVE\n|-\n| 2004\n| Audrey Ying\n| Mark Van Cuylenberg\n| Carrie Chong\n| Eugene Loh\n|-\n| 2005\n|\n| Rod Monteiro\n| Jamie Yeo\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| Audrey Ying\n| Mark Van Cuylenberg\n| Daniel Ong\n| Melanie Oliveiro, Eugene Loh\n|-\n| 2007\n| Brian Richmond\n| Vernetta Lopez\n| Daniel Ong\n| Keith De Souza\n|-\n| 2010\n| Brian Richmond\n| Jean Danker\n| Daniel Ong\n| Stanley Leong\n|-\n| 2011\n| Tim Oh\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2013\n| Vernetta Lopez\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nChinese Stations Most Popular DJ\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Y.E.S. 93.3FM醉心频道\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Capital 95.8FM城市频道\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Love 97.2FM最爱频道\n|-\n| 2004\n| Dennis Chew\n| Wang Dicong\n| Dongfang Billy\n|-\n| 2005\n| Cruz Teng\n| Wang Lizhen\n| Chen Hong\n|-\n| 2006\n| Cruz Teng\n| Wang Lizhen\n| Dongfang Billy\n|-\n| 2007\n| Cruz Teng\n| Wang Lizhen\n| Dongfang Billy\n|-\n| 2010\n| Cruz Teng\n| Wang Dicong\n| Jeff\n|-\n| 2011\n| Dennis Chew\n| Wang Dicong\n| Wallace Ang\n|-\n| 2013\n| N/A\n|  N/A\n|   N/A\n|}\nLifetime Achievement Award\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Current Station\n|-\n| 2005\n| Brian Richmond\n| Gold 90.5FM\n|-\n| 2006\n| Bala Supramaniam\n| Oli 96.8FM\n|-\n| 2010\n| Ibrahim Jamil\n| Warna 94.2FM\n|-\n| 2011\n| Liang Peng\n| Capital 95.8FM\n|-\n| 2013\n| Suharti Ali\n| Warna 94.2FM\n|}\nAward categories\nCurrent categories\nSponsored categories\nSuspended/retired categories\nReferences"
