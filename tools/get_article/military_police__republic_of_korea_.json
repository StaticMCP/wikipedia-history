Once operated under a unified Military Police Command (; 憲兵總司令部; ) between 1953 and 1960, the ROK's MP units are now commanded by the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force HQs separately. ROK Army MPs also function as border guards at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\nDMZ guards\nAll ROK troops guarding and patrolling inside the DMZ wears military police armband, although they are mainly members of army's infantry or light infantry units. (Reconnaissance Battalion/Company. The ones deployed in the JSA are members of the United Nations Command Security Battalion). The reason why these soldiers are MPs is because the armistice that was signed in 1953 that ended the Korean War requires both sides (the North and the South) to restrict access inside the DMZ to MPs only, which means no vehicles, no squad-served weapons (such as mortars and HMGs) and no regular units of the army.\nMain role\nThe Republic of Korea Army Military Polices' main role is to maintain security and order within the barracks, and also serves as gate guards for the base, and guards the checkpoints to keep watch for intruders. Since its main role is a police force within the military, they have motorized units which consists of motorcycles and other police vehicles to patrol the area that they are assigned to. However, in the 1990s, with the continued increase of the threats from their northern counterparts, the Ministry of National Defense assigned a special operations team within the Military Police, which is the Republic of Korea Army Military Police Special Duty Team, also known as the SDT.\nEquipment\nThe ROK MP has the following small-arms in their inventory:\n* K1A assault carbine\n* K2 assault rifle\n* K5 semi-automatic pistol\n* K14 bolt-action sniper rifle\n* Various revolvers of U.S. origin\nReferences\nSee also\n* Military Police"
