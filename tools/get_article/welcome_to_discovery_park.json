      "text": "# Welcome to Discovery Park\n\n}}\nWelcome to Discovery Park is the third studio album by the alternative rock band Brad. It was released in 2002 on Redline Records.\nOverview\nThe album's recording sessions took place from May 2001 to March 2002 at Studio Litho and Studio X in Seattle, Washington. Studio Litho is owned by guitarist Stone Gossard. The recording of Welcome to Discovery Park saw contributions from Mike Berg, who had taken over as the touring bassist for Jeremy Toback. Most of the album was produced by the band members themselves, although they also worked with producers Phil Nicolo and Skip Drinkwater. The album was mixed by Nicolo, Drinkwater, and Matt Bayles. The album's cover art was photographed by Bruce Tom. The album mixes the rawness of the band's debut, Shame, with the more polished, produced sound of the band's second album, Interiors. The album charted at number 46 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. Bradley Torreano of Allmusic called it \"another quality album that still leaves the listener hungry overall for some better songs.\" Outtakes from the recording sessions for Welcome to Discovery Park were included on the 2005 compilation album, Brad vs Satchel.\nTrack listing\n;European bonus tracks\nPersonnel\n;Brad\n*Stone Gossard&nbsp;– guitars, drums, organ, synth, bass guitar\n*Regan Hagar&nbsp;– drums, synth, guitar, design and layout\n*Shawn Smith&nbsp;– vocals, piano, guitars, programming, drums, synth, bass guitar, organ\n*Jeremy Toback&nbsp;– bass guitar\n*Mike Berg&nbsp;– keyboards, piano, bass guitar, guitars, synth, organ\n;Additional musicians and production\n*Matt Bayles&nbsp;– engineering, recording, mixing\n*Brad&nbsp;– production\n*Skip Drinkwater&nbsp;– additional production, mixing\n*Rick Fisher at RFI/CD Mastering (Seattle)&nbsp;– mastering\n*Sam Hofstedt, Floyd Reitsma&nbsp;– assistance\n*Phil Nicolo&nbsp;– additional production, engineering, mixing\n*Elizabeth Pupo Walker&nbsp;– percussion\n*Bruce Tom&nbsp;– photos\n*Thaddeus Turner&nbsp;– guitars, bass guitar\nChart positions\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!
