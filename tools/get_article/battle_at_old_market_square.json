      "text": "# Battle at Old Market Square\n\nThe Battle at Old Market Square was an anti-fascist protest on 5 June 1934 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nMembers of the Canadian Nationalist Party (CNP) planned a rally at the Old Market Square, in Winnipeg's Exchange District. An estimated 75 to 100 sympathizers of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini gathered there. The event was \"a public provocation aimed at the organized labor movement, Jews, and minority communities\". Five hundred protesters from various anti-fascist groups converged on the rally. At least 20 CNP members were injured, and police arrested seven as they suppressed the confrontation.\nThe battle \"demonstrated the successful and deeply rooted popular resistance to fascist provocations\" in Winnipeg. After that, the CNP held no further public meetings. The effect was lasting: \"no fascist group in the city would ever find itself in a position to mount such public campaigns of discrimination\".\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
