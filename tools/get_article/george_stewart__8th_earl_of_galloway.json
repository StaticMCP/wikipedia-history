Commanding a division of four frigates and a sloop, he engaged the Spanish ship of line San Francisco de Asís in the action of 25 January 1797, in which he was forced to withdraw. He served in the area until the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797. After the battle Lively carried Sir Robert Calder, with the account of the victory, and Lord Minto, Viceroy of Corsica, and his suite, who were on board during the battle, back to England.\nAround November 1799 Garlies commissioned the frigate , and commanded her in the Channel and on the coast of Ireland until early 1801, making several captures and recaptures:\n* On 17 May 1800 Hussar, the frigate Loire and the schooner  recaptured the ship Princess Charlotte, and captured the French schooner La Francoise.\n* On 2 March 1801 Hussar captured the French schooner Le General Bessieres.\n* On 12 April 1801 Hussar recaptured the ship James of Liverpool.\nIn early 1801 Garlies moved into the , to serve on the blockade of Brest, remaining there until the Treaty of Amiens in early 1802 brought a short-lived period of peace. Following the renewal of hostilities in May 1803 he commanded the ship , and sat on the Board of Admiralty in between May 1805 and February 1806.
