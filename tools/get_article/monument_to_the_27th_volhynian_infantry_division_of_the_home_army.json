It commemorates the contribution of the Armia Krajowa's 27th Infantry Division during World War II, especially fighting the Ukrainian Insurgent Army at the time of the Volhynia massacres.\nThe memorial was designed by sculptor  (who was born in Volhynia). It was unveiled on 12 September 1993. The monument is shaped like a large stone sword.\nOn the 13 July 2003 a set of 11 stone column \"candles\" was unveiled, commemorating the martyrdom of Poles from Volhynia's 11 counties, the victims of the Volhynia massacres. Each column has a coat of arms and a name of a county from Volhynia. The columns are terminated with a \"wick\" - the columns are illuminated from below with lights hidden in the pavement.\nTo the right of the monument is a bust of General Jan Wojciech Kiwerski, a leader of the infantry division, who died during the war.\nGallery\nImage:Pomnik 27 Wołyńskiej Dywizji Piechoty AK w Warszawie 07.jpg|\nImage:Pomnik 27 Wołyńskiej Dywizji Piechoty AK w Warszawie 09.jpg|\nImage:Pomnik 27 Wołyńskiej Dywizji Piechoty AK w Warszawie 12.jpg|\nImage:Pomnik 27 Wołyńskiej Dywizji Piechoty AK w Warszawie 16.jpg|\nBibliography\n* [http://www.pomniki.w-wa.info.pl/s_dywizji_piechoty.html A view of the monument]"
