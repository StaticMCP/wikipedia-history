In the , Kagaru had a population of 19 people.\nGeography\nKagaru's eastern border follows the Sydney–Brisbane rail corridor, the Logan River and Teviot Brook.\nIn the 1930s, a railway station in the area was named Kagaru, a Ugarapul word for the blue-winged kookaburra. On the 24 April 1997, the locality was formally bounded and took the name of the railway station. Formerly in the Shire of Beaudesert, Kagaru became split between Logan City and Scenic Rim Region following the local government amalgamations in March 2008.\nThe land use is mostly grazing on native vegetation with crop growing also occurring in the northern part of the loacality.\nHistory\nThe name Kagaru is an Aboriginal word for the blue-winged kookaburra (Dacelo leachii) in the Yuggera language, Yugarabul dialect.\nIn September 1930, a new railway line from South Brisbane to Kyogle (New South Wales) was opened as part of establishing a faster rail route between Brisbane to Sydney avoiding the break-of-gauge that occurred at Wallangarra on the Queensland-New South Wales border. The new line cut six hours from the journey from Brisbane to Sydney. Kagaru railway station () was built to enable the steam locomotives to take on water, but is not in use any more. It was named by the Queensland Railways Department on 14 February 1930. The railway station is now abandoned.\nDemographics\nIn the , Kagaru had a population of 13 people.
