It was declared a \"national drama\" after garnering high ratings, including topping 50.0% for its finale episode.\nIn 2011, GMA Network aired the series, dubbed in Tagalog, under the title The Baker King. For most of its run, it was the highest rated and most watched show in the Philippines.\nProduction\nAt its December 2013 trade launch to potential advertisers, TV5 announced it had acquired the Philippine adaptation rights to the drama. Baker King was revealed as one of two Korean drama adaptations (along with My Fair Lady) to air on the network in 2014.\nTV5 talent Vin Abrenica was initially reported to have either been cast as the lead or second lead on the series. But in March 2014, a story published in the Journal group of daily tabloids reported that TV5 was interested in \"borrowing\" GMA talent Derrick Monasterio for Baker King in which he would star with TV5 talents Ritz Azul and Eula Caballero.\nThere would be no news about the project until April 2015 when TV5 announced Baker King would premiere on 18 May with a cast including Boots Anson-Roa, Akihiro Blanco, Shaira Mae, and Inah Estrada. Mark Neumann was cast in the title role, contrary to what had been reported.  Abrenica admitted to being \"hurt\" after learning he had not been cast on the series.\nTV5 entertainment head Wilma Galvante said the Filipino adaptation would include Filipino \"local flavor\" based on the book Panaderia by Amy Uy which is a study of various local breads from different parts of the Philippines.\nThe series uses several songs from the original Korean soundtrack of Baker King Kim Tak Goo as well as one original Filipino song performed and composed by Ogie Alcasid entitled \"Saranghaeyo.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
