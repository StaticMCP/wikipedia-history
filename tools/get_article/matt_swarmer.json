He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs.\nAmateur career\nSwarmer attended Governor Mifflin Senior High School and played four years of college baseball at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. After his senior year at Kutztown, he was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the 19th round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft.\nProfessional career\nChicago Cubs\nSwarmer made his professional debut in 2016 with the Arizona League Cubs and worked his way through the minor league system with the Eugene Emeralds, Myrtle Beach Pelicans, South Bend Cubs, and Tennessee Smokies before reaching the Triple-A Iowa Cubs for the first time in 2017. In 2018, Swarmer split the season between Myrtle Beach and Tennessee, and was named the Cubs' Minor League Pitcher of the Year after starting 24 games and going 9–8 with a 3.22 ERA over  innings.\nIn 2019, Swarmer made 27 appearances (25 starts) for Iowa, posting a 10-11 record and 5.65 ERA with 137 strikeouts in  innings pitched. Swarmer did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He pitched in 24 games (starting 20) for Triple-A Iowa in 2021, logging a 3-8 record and 4.79 ERA with 120 strikeouts in  innings of work. Swarmer returned to Iowa to open the 2022 season.\nOn May 30, 2022, the Cubs selected Swarmer's contract and promoted him to the major leagues for the first time. He made his MLB debut that day as the starting pitcher in game one of a doubleheader versus the Milwaukee Brewers. He threw six innings and gave up four runs (only one earned) while striking out six batters in a 7-6 loss. On June 5, Swarmer earned his first career win, tossing six innings of one-run ball against the St. Louis Cardinals. He also became the first Cubs rookie since Gene Lillard in 1939 to throw six-plus innings and allow one or fewer runs in each of his first two big-league games.\nOn June 11, 2022, Swarmer tied a major-league record by allowing six solo home runs in a single game during an 8-0 loss to The Yankees. Swarmer also became the first Cubs pitcher to allow six homers in a game since Tom Lee in 1884. Swarmer had previously set another franchise record in 2019 with the Iowa Cubs, allowing 36 home runs in his 27 outings. He was designated for assignment by the Cubs on July 16.
