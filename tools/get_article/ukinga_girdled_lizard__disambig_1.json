They are rupicolous (rock-dwelling) and feed on small arthropods.\nThe dorsal coloration is red-brown with scattered dark mottles.  The lateral scales often have pale borders.  The upper lip is white and there is a distinct dark dorsolateral band on the sides of the neck.  The belly is pale gray.  The maximum length is around 170&nbsp;mm.\nThe Ukinga girdled lizard can be distinguished from related species (Cordylus tropidosternum and Cordylus jonesii) by their white lips, keeled scales on the throat, fusion of the loreal scale with the preocular (separate in other species), and the presence of a low supraocular ridge.  The supraocular ridge extends along the lateral edges of the prefrontal, frontal, frontoparietal, parietal, and supraocular scales.\nUkinga girdled lizards have recently been exported from Tanzania for the pet trade.  They are commonly labeled, along with the tropical girdled lizard, as the armadillo lizard.\nReferences\n* Broadley, D. G., and Branch, W. R., 2002.
