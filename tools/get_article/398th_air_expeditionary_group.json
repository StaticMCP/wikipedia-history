The 398 AEG may be activated or inactivated at any time.\nDuring World War II, its predecessor unit, the 398th Bombardment Group (Heavy) was an Eighth Air Force B-17 Flying Fortress unit in England, stationed at RAF Nuthampstead. The group flew 195 combat missions, the last being on 25 April 1945.\nHistory\nWorld War II\nThe group was constituted as the 398th Bombardment Group (Heavy) on 15 February 1943, and equipped with the B-17 Flying Fortress. It was activated 1 March 1943 at Ephrata Army Air Base, Wash., with the 600th, 601st, 602d, and 603d Bombardment Squadrons. The Group assembled at Blythe Army Airfield, California, and then moved to Geiger Field, Washington, on 20 April 1943 to complete training.\nOn 20 June 1943 moved to Rapid City Army Air Base, South Dakota, to take up Replacement Training Unit duties. Trained 326 B-17 crews from August to December 1943 but at the beginning of the New Year reverted to training for combat. Ground echelon began movement overseas on 4 April 1944. The unit moved to Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts, on 7–12 April 1944. Personnel embarked on USS Wakefield. Sailed to Boston on 13 April, and arrived in Liverpool on 21 April 1944.\nMoved to England in April 1944 and assigned to Eighth AF. The 398th BG entered combat in May 1944, and until V-E Day operated primarily against strategic objectives in Germany, attacking targets such as factories in Berlin, warehouses in Munich, marshalling yards in Saarbrücken, shipping facilities in Kiel, oil refineries in Merseburg, and aircraft plants in Münster.\nThe group temporarily suspended strategic missions to attack coastal defenses and enemy troops on the Cotentin Peninsula during the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944. The group struck gun positions near Eindhoven in support of the air attack on Holland in September 1944, and raided power stations, railroads, and bridges during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 – January 1945. The group flew missions attacking airfields to aid the Allied assault across the Rhine in March 1945.\nThe 398th flew its last combat mission, attacking an airfield in Plzeň, Czechoslovakia, on 25 April 1945. After V-E Day the group transported liberated prisoners from Germany to France.\nFrom Nuthampstead, the 398th Bomb Group flew 195 combat missions. Redeployed USA in May/June 1945. The aircraft left on 21–27 May 1945. The Ground unit went to Greenock on 22 June 1945 and sailed on Queen Elizabeth arriving in New York on 29 June 1945. After 30 days R & R some personnel assembled at Drew Field, Florida, where the Group was inactivated on 1 September 1945.\nPost Cold War\nas part of Joint Task Force Liberia, 14 August 2003.]]\nThe 398th BG was redesignated as the 398th Operations Group and activated 1 June 1992. Reactivated in 1992 as 398th Operations Group. Assigned first to 340th Air Refueling Wing, later to 97th Air Mobility Wing as a KC-135 air refueling group. From 1 June 1992 – 31 March 1995 the 93d Air Refueling Squadron was part of the group. The 398th OG was inactivated on 31 March 1995.\nDuring Operation Iraqi Freedom the title 398th Air Expeditionary Group was given to a collection of units and personnel operating from Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Greece. Colonel Marcelyn A. Atwood commanded the group.\nLater in 2003, the unit participated in Operation Shining Express in Liberia, a rescue operation directed by the United States European Command to evacuate civilians from parts of Liberia affected by the Second Liberian Civil War. Among the groups contributions was delivering a United States Marine Corps security forces team.\nFrom 23 March and 10 April 2008, the 398th with the 712th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron was deployed to the Budapest International Airport, assigned to the 323d Air Expeditionary Wing. It provided air refueling missions to fighters in support of Operation Noble Endeavor during the 2008 Bucharest summit.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 398th Bombardment Group (Heavy) on 15 February 1943\n:Activated on 1 March 1943\n: Redesignated 398th Bombardment Group, Heavy c. 20 August 1943\n: Inactivated on 1 September 1945\n* Redesignated 398th Operations Group in 1992\n: Activated on 1 June 1992\n: Inactivated on 31 March 1995\n* Redesignated 398th Expeditionary Air Refueling Group and converted to provisional status on 5 February 2001\n* Redesignated 398th Air Expeditionary Group' on 18 March 2003\n: Activated in c. 13 July 2003\n: Inactivated on 8 October 2003\n: Activated in 2004\n: Inactivated on 17 June 2004\n: Activated on 25 March 2006\n: Inactivated on 8 April 2006\n: Activated on 14 March 2008\n: Inactivated on 30 April 2008\nAir Expeditionary Service with Joint Task Force Liberia 2003; 2008.
