While the nomination itself was contested, former Vice President Richard Nixon ran virtually unopposed in the Granite State, thus winning in a landslide. He defeated his nearest opponent, Nelson Rockefeller, (who was a write-in candidate) by 67 percentage points. Nixon would go on to win the GOP nomination, and the presidency.\nResults\nReferences"
