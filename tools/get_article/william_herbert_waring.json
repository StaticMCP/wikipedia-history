In 1918 he was serving as a lance-sergeant in the 25th (Montgomery and Welsh Horse Yeomanry) Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers, British Army, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.\nDetails\nOn 18 September 1918 at Ronssoy, France, Lance-Sergeant Waring led an attack against enemy machine-guns and in the face of devastating fire, single-handed rushed a strong-point, bayoneting four of the garrison and capturing twenty, with their guns. The lance-sergeant then reorganized his men, leading and inspiring them for another 400 yards when he fell mortally wounded.\nWaring died 20 days later and is buried at Ste Marie Communal Cemetery, Le Havre, Seine Maritime, France.\nA stone to commemorate his life was installed in the wall of the Welshpool Town Hall and unveiled in January 2015.\nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum, Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, Wales.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Brig-Gen Sir James E.
