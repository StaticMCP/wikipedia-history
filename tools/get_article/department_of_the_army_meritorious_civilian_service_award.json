It consists of a medal, lapel button, and citation certificate. Nominees must have established a pattern of excellence, normally demonstrated by the receipt of lower level awards. The award is comparable to the military Meritorious Service Medal. On 13 April 1987, the Army Chief of Staff approved this award as the Superior Civilian Service. In November 2014, the Department of the Army Civilian Service Medals were renamed by the Secretary of the Army to align award names closer to their military equivalents. At that time the award was renamed the Meritorious Civilian Service Medal and the design of the medal was modified to reflect that change.\nEligibility\nEligibility is determined by measuring contributions against the following example levels of achievement:\n*Accomplished supervisory or nonsupervisory duties in an exemplary manner, setting a record of achievement, and inspiring others to improve the quantity and quality of their work.\n*Demonstrated unusual initiative and skill in devising new and improved equipment, work methods, and procedures; inventions resulting in substantial savings in expenses such as manpower, time, space, and materials, or improved safety or health of the workforce.\n*Rendered professional or public relations service of a unique or distinctive character.\n*Achieved outstanding results in improving the morale and performance of employees.\n*Exhibited unusual courage or competence in an emergency, while performing assigned duties, resulting in direct benefit to the Government or its personnel.\nDescription\nThe medal of the award is a bronze disc  in diameter. On the obverse of the medal is the Department of the Army Seal encircled by a laurel wreath. The reverse contains the inscription in five lines FOR DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY MERITOROUS CIVILIAN SERVICE—TO, while the lower edge contains a laurel wreath, extending up to the inscription.
