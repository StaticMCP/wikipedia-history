The vote was held on the same day as a statewide referendum on the subject of federation, which was an issue throughout the campaign.\nTwo candidates withdrew during the campaign. On 9 June 1899, Protectionist-endorsed candidate William Schey withdrew shortly after candidate nominations closed to avoid splitting the vote with Independent Protectionist candidate John Norton. Five days later, William Melville withdrew and endorsed fellow Federalist candidate William Snape.\nNorton won the seat with 52.6% of the vote, defeating Free Trade candidate (and former Northumberland MP) Henry Wheeler.\nKey events\n*14 May 1899 − Richard Stevenson died\n*2 June 1899 − Writ of election issued by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly\n*9 June 1899 − Candidate nominations\n*20 June 1899 − Polling day\n*24 June 1899 − Declaration of result\n*30 June 1899 − Return of writ\nCandidates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Party\n!
