The complex was built in 1922–1923, and consists of the school, a home economics building, a shop building (ruin), and the girls’ privy (ruin).\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.\nThe King William Academy had its inception through a vision activated by the Reverend Dr. Samuel B. Holmes, a former pastor of the Third Union Baptist Church.  The King William Academy was initially erected on the property of Dr. Holmes and his wife, Martha Bundy Holmes.  Students throughout King William and King & Queen Counties attended the school with some students actually boarding with the Holmes' and other families in close proximity to the Academy.\nReferences\nExternal links"
