Rock and Enemy Ace. The series was published from August 1952 to February 1977, then was renamed Sgt. Rock in March 1977, continuing the numbering sequence of Our Army at War.\nPublication history\nOur Army at War was launched in August 1952 as part of a wave of war comics. The stories were often followed by tag lines such as \"Explosive Battle Action\". One of the main characters was Sgt. Rock, who appeared in #81 (April 1959) as Sgt. Rocky along with his team, Easy Company. The character got his final name in issue #83. Writer Robert Kanigher and artist Joe Kubert introduced Enemy Ace in #151 (February 1965). Artist Neal Adams made his DC Comics debut with the story \"It's My Turn to Die\", written by Howard Liss, in issue #182 (July 1967). Writer/artist Sam Glanzman began his series of biographical war stories about his service aboard the U.S.S. Stevens in issue #218 (April 1970). Three issues of the series, #242 (February 1972), #269 (June 1974), and #275 (December 1974), were published in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format. The series' title was changed to Sgt. Rock with issue #302 (March 1977). An Our Army at War one-shot was published in November 2010.\nCollected editions\n* Showcase Presents: Our Army at War collects Our Army at War #1&ndash;20, 512 pages, December 2010,\n* America at War includes Our Army at War #67: \"Push-Button War\" by France Herron and John Severin; #83: \"The Rock and the Wall!\" by Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert; #160: \"What's the Color of Your Blood?\" by Kanigher and Kubert; #235: \"The Glory Boys\" by Kanigher and Alex Toth; #233: \"Head-Count\" by Kanigher and Kubert; and #235: \"Kamikaze\" by Sam Glanzman, 247 pages, July 1979,\n* Sgt.
