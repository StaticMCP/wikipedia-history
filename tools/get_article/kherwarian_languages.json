Together, Korku and the Kherwarian language continuum form the conventional North Munda branch of the Austroasiatic language family.\nThe Dravidian-speaking Kurukh people in Ranchi suburbs have adopted a creolized dialect of Kherwarian Mundari called Keraʔ Mundari. Its verbal morphology is less complex than an average Austroasiatic Kherwarian language.\nTypology\nVowel harmony in Kherwarian affixes yields some differences depending on the nature of the vowel of the verb stem, while others do not. There are harmonic and non-harmonic affixes. In phonological lexical words, disyllables have certain vowel restrictions.\nStress is fixedly released at the second syllable. LH (weak-strong) prosodic word pattern is pervasive even in morphological words. Unlike Korku, the Kherwarian languages lack phonemic tones, giving a good reason for the Korku-Kherwarian classification of North Munda.\nLike many other Munda languages, the Kherwarian languages are pronominalized languages with complex verbal agreement systems. Encoding double- and triple agreements with a third argument or non-argument are possible, and indexation of the third argument usually involves a possessor.\n1).
