This took place on the same day as other local elections in England. The council remained without control of any party.\nSummary\nThe council was under no overall control prior to the election. The Conservatives were the largest party and they formed a minority administration with local party the Whitnash Residents Association. Following the election the council remained under no overall control, with the Greens becoming the largest party, having won fourteen seats. The Conservatives were reduced to just six seats, making them the fourth largest party after Labour and the Liberal Democrats.\nA coalition of the Greens and Labour subsequently formed, with Green group leader Ian Davison being appointed leader of the council at the subsequent annual council meeting on 17 May 2023, with Labour councillor Chris King serving as deputy leader (the previous Labour group leader Mini Mangat had lost her seat at the election).\nOverall results\n6\n|votes %       =26.3\n|seats %       =31.8\n|votes         =27,789\n|plus/minus    =+3.8\n}}\n6\n|votes %       =21.4\n|seats %       =25.0\n|votes         =22,642\n|plus/minus    =+1.9\n}}\n1\n|votes %       =18.1\n|seats %       =22.7\n|votes         =19,061\n|plus/minus    =–5.4\n}}\n13\n|votes %       =30.5\n|seats %       =13.6\n|votes         =32,181\n|plus/minus    =+1.1\n}}\n|votes %       =3.4\n|seats %       =6.8\n|votes         =3,587\n|plus/minus    =–0.5\n}}\n|votes %       =0.1\n|seats %       =0.0\n|votes         =122\n|plus/minus    =–1.1\n}}\n|votes %       =0.1\n|seats %       =0.0\n|votes         =116\n|plus/minus    =N/A\n}}\n|votes %       =0.1\n|seats %       =0.0\n|votes         =73\n|plus/minus    =N/A\n}}\n|-\nWard results\nBishop's Tachbrook\n}}\nBudbrooke\n}}\nCubbington & Leek Wootton\n}}\nKenilworth Abbey & Arden\n}}\nKenilworth Park Hill\n}}\nKenilworth St. Johns\n}}\nLeamington Brunswick\n}}\nLeamington Clarendon\n}}\nLeamington Lillington\n}}\nLeamington Milverton\n}}\nLeamington Willes\n}}\nRadford Semele\n}}\n12.3\n}}\nWarwick All Saints & Woodloes\n}}\nWarwick Aylesford\n}}\nWarwick Myton & Heathcote\n}}\nWarwick Saltisford\n}}\nWhitnash\n}}\nBy-elections\nWarwick All Saints & Woodloes (January 2024)\n2.6\n}}\nLeamington Clarendon (May 2024)\n1.1\n}}\nWarwick All Saints & Woodloes (February 2025)\nKenilworth Park Hill\n}}\n1.6\n}}\nLeamington Clarendon (September 2025)\n}}\n16.0\n}}\nReferences"
