A scholar of Italian Baroque art, Bissell was a professor of art history at the University of Michigan.\nCareer\nBorn in New York City to Raymond Sr. and Elizabeth Weston, Bissell graduated from Towson High School in 1954. He then received a Bachelor of Arts in 1958 and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1966, both from the University of Michigan. Bissell wrote a doctoral dissertation on the Italian Baroque painter Orazio Gentileschi. He would dedicate the rest of his career to studying that period of art, as well as Orazio's daughter, Artemisia.\nWhile studying at Michigan, Bissell began his teaching career in 1964 as an instructor of art history at the University of Wisconsin. In 1971, Bissell returned to Michigan and was hired as Assistant Professor of Art History. He rose through the professional ranks to become full Professor, and eventually chaired the department. Bissell remained there for the remainder of his career, retiring in 2006.\nBissell was an amateur artist himself and was inspired by the work of Louise Nevelson. He died in Ann Arbor in 2019.\nSee also\n*List of people from New York City\n*List of University of Michigan arts alumni\n*List of University of Wisconsin–Madison people\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://arthistorians.info/bissellr Dictionary of Art Historians profile]\n*[https://obits.mlive.com/us/obituaries/annarbor/name/raymond-bissell-obituary?id=8884553 Ann Arbor News obituary]"
