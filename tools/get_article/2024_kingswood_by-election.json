This followed the resignation of Conservative MP Chris Skidmore, in protest at the UK government's decision to issue more oil and gas licences. Skidmore announced his resignation on 5 January and it was effected three days later.\nThe election was won by Damien Egan of the Labour Party with a 16% swing. The turnout was 37.1%.\nThe by-election took place on the same day as the Wellingborough by-election, also won by Labour from the Conservatives.\nConstituency\nThe Kingswood constituency in South Gloucestershire had been won by the main party of government since its creation in February 1974, except for 1992. It voted Leave in the 2016 EU referendum by a margin of 58% to 42%.\nIn the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Kingswood was set to be split between three seats: North East Somerset and Hanham, Bristol North East, and Filton and Bradley Stoke. The new boundaries did not impact the by-election, instead taking effect at the 2024 general election. Egan had already been selected as the Labour candidate for Bristol North East.\nBackground\n]]\nChris Skidmore was first elected to the constituency of Kingswood in the 2010 general election, gaining the seat from the incumbent Labour MP Roger Berry. As Minister for Energy and Clean Growth, he signed the UK's net zero pledge into law. He has stated his opposition to further oil and gas extraction in the UK, including his refusal to support the government of Liz Truss on the matter in October 2022.\nHe announced his resignation on 5 January 2024, prior to the second reading of the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill which would guarantee annual licensing rounds, having previously announced he would be standing down at the 2024 general election. Skidmore formally resigned as a member of Parliament on 8 January.\nThe writ of election was moved on 11 January 2024 and the date of election is 15 February 2024, the same day as another by-election in Wellingborough.\nCandidates\nThe Labour Party selected Damien Egan as their candidate on 9 January. Egan was elected Mayor of Lewisham in 2018, and in July 2023 was selected as parliamentary candidate for Bristol North East, one of the seats that will succeed Kingswood following the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies. Egan resigned the mayorality to contest the seat.\nThe Conservative Party selected Sam Bromiley, the party group's leader on the South Gloucestershire Council, on 14 January. He is a councillor for Parkwall & Warmley.\nThough initially stating that they would not stand a candidate over frustrations with the cost of the by-election, Reform UK later selected former MEP for the West Midlands and Referendum Party candidate Rupert Lowe.\nThe Liberal Democrats selected Bristol City councillor Andrew Brown, who works in the financial sector and is a councillor for the Hengrove and Whitchurch Park ward.\nThe Green Party candidate was another Bristol City councillor, Lorraine Francis. Francis is a councillor for the Eastville ward and a social worker, who had already been selected as their candidate for Bristol North East at the next general election. She campaigned on protecting the green belt from development.\nThe UK Independence Party (UKIP) selected Nicholas Wood, its May 2023 candidate in the Surrey County Council by-election for the Walton South & Oatlands division and Elmbridge Council elections for Oatlands and Burwood Park ward.\nResult\n}}\nPrevious result\n}}\nNotes\nReferences"
