They won a majority of seats on the island despite the Liberals receiving over 60% of the vote; this was partly due to a disproportionately large number of Conservative candidates standing unopposed. The franchise was restricted to the middle and upper classes.\nElectoral reform in subsequent decades saw something of a rise in the Tory vote in Ireland accompanied by a diminution in the number of seats the party won. This was again due in some degree to the relative numbers of candidates standing unopposed for the two parties.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ 1859 general election in Ireland\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px\" colspan=2 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Candidates\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Unopposed\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| % Change\n|-\n|\n| align=center| 67\n| align=center| 36\n| align=center| 55\n| align=center| 11\n| align=center| 35,258\n| align=center| 38.9\n| align=center| 4.7\n|-\n|\n| align=center| 73\n| align=center| 26\n| align=center| 50\n| align=center| 2\n| align=center| 57,409\n| align=center| 61.1\n| align=center| 13.3\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"font-weight:bold; background:rgb(232,232,232);\"\n| colspan=2 style=text-align:right | Total\n| align=center| 140\n| align=center| 62\n| align=center| 105\n| align=center|\n| align=center| 92,667\n| align=center| 100.0\n| align=center|\n|}\n|61.95}}\n|38.05}}\n}}\n|52.38}}\n|47.62}}\n}}\nSee also\n* History of Ireland (1801–1923)\nReferences"
