After the US release on Ark 21 Records, People was a global release via Jones' own record label dtox. The album is a reworked version of the 1997 Japanese-only release Angels & Lovers. The title track and \"When Lovers Confess\" were deleted and three new tracks added: \"Tomorrow Is Now\", \"Everything\", and \"Let the People Have Their Say\". The album did not chart in the UK. However, the single \"Let the People Have Their Say\" broke the top 100 barrier in the UK and received ample air play on BBC Radio 2. The tri-fold slip case version features the faces of 210 people, all friends, family and fans of Jones.\nTo promote the album, a tour was organised. Jones' band consisted of former Kajagoogoo bassist Nick Beggs, guitarist Robin Boult and on drums the late Kevin Wilkinson who has played with China Crisis.\nHoward also toured the US with Culture Club and The Human League playing a host of hits and songs from the album in large arenas.\nTrack listing\nTrack 4 has a different version on the European versions of this album.
