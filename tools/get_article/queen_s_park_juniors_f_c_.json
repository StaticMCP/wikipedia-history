However, there were close links, as the Juniors played on the former ground of Queen's Park, enjoyed free entry to matches, and often provided players to Queen's Park.\nThe club gave its foundation date as 1870, although the earliest recorded match was a goalless draw against the Woodbank club in September 1873.\nThe club entered the Scottish Cup on three occasions in the late 1870s, but never progressed beyond the first round.  In 1875–76 the club scratched to Renton Thistle F.C., in 1876–77 the club lost 4–1 to eventual finalists Rangers, and in 1877–78 it lost to 1–0 away to Jordanhill.  The club seems to have stopped playing matches against other teams soon afterwards, its last recorded fixtures being from November 1877.\nColours\nThe club's colours were the same black and white jersey and hose as those of Queen's Park.\nGrounds\nThe club played at the Recreation Park in Queen's Park, near to Hampden Park, a 2-minute walk from the Crosshill tram terminus.\nNotable players\n* George Ker, future Scottish international\n* Stewart Lawrie, later President of Queen's Park\n* Sgt Yates, winner of the Queen's Prize for rifle-shooting in 1898 and a forward with the club in 1875\nExternal links\n*[https://www.rsssf.org/tabless/scotcuphistfull.html RSSSF: Scottish Cup]\nReferences"
