The number started to grow in the 1970s after the passage of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act and its amendment in 1968 which curtailed extensive rights to immigrate to the UK for Commonwealth citizens. This Act had the effect of more immigration from non-Commonwealth countries, such as the Philippines.\nThe 2001 UK census recorded 9,924 Burmese-born people residing in the United Kingdom.\n2021 Census\nCountry of birth\nThe figures below represent data collected for the 2021 United Kingdom census with the country as a reported birthplace recorded (i.e. does not include British born people of Southeast Asian origin). The census in Scotland was delayed for a year and took place in 2022.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! class=\"unsortable\" | State/Territory\n!  (2021)\n!
