The Best Fighter ESPY Award trophy was presented to the professional or amateur boxer or mixed martial artist adjudged to be the best in a given calendar year at the annual ESPY Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. It was first awarded as part of the ESPY Awards in 2007, subsuming the Best Boxer ESPY Award until 2019, when the Best MMA Fighter ESPY Award was established, and the ESPY Awards began awarding boxers and mixed martial arts fighters separately. Balloting for the award was undertaken by fans over the Internet from between three and five choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee, which is composed of a panel of experts. It was conferred in July to reflect performance and achievement over the preceding twelve months.\nThe inaugural winner of the Best Fighter ESPY Award was American welterweight champion Floyd Mayweather Jr., who defeated the incumbent category title holder Oscar De La Hoya two months prior. He is one of two people to have been presented with the award more than once, winning the accolade a total of six times; Mayweather was also nominated in 2015. Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao has the second most awards won with victories in 2009 and 2011. It has been presented to one woman in its history, American bantamweight mixed martial arts fighter Ronda Rousey in 2015. Between 2007 and 2018, boxers were most successful at the ESPY Awards with nine victories and twenty-four nominations, followed by mixed martial arts with three wins and nineteen nominations.\nWinners and nominees\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Best Fighter ESPY Award winners and nominees\n|-\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Image\n! scope=col | Winner\n! scope=col | Nationality\n! scope=col | Sport\n! scope=col | Sanctioning body or league\n! scope=col | Weight class\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Nominees\n! scope=col class=unsortable |\n|-\n| 2007\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Boxing\n|\n| Welterweight\n| align=left | Miguel Cotto () – Boxing Randy Couture () – Mixed martial arts Quinton Jackson () – Mixed martial arts Manny Pacquiao () – Boxing\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n|\n! scope=row |  (2)\n|\n| Boxing\n|\n| Welterweight\n| align=left | Joe Calzaghe () – Boxing Holly Holm () – Boxing Kelly Pavlik () – Boxing Georges St-Pierre () – Mixed martial arts\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Boxing\n|\n| Light welterweight  Welterweight\n| align=left | Lyoto Machida () – Mixed martial arts\nShane Mosley () – Boxing Anderson Silva () – Mixed martial arts\n|\n|-\n| 2010\n|\n! scope=row |  (3)\n|\n| Boxing\n|\n| Welterweight\n| align=left | Manny Pacquiao () – Boxing Georges St-Pierre () – Mixed martial arts\n|\n|-\n| 2011\n|\n! scope=row |  (2)\n|\n| Boxing\n|\n| Welterweight\n| align=left | Bernard Hopkins () – Boxing Jon Jones () – Mixed martial arts Sergio Martínez () – Boxing Georges St-Pierre () – Mixed martial arts\n|\n|-\n| 2012\n|\n! scope=row |  (4)\n|\n| Boxing\n|\n| Welterweight\n| align=left | Jon Jones () – Mixed martial arts Anderson Silva () – Mixed martial arts Andre Ward () – Boxing\n|\n|-\n| 2013\n|\n! scope=row |  (5)\n|\n| Boxing\n|\n| Welterweight\n| align=left | Canelo Alvarez () – Boxing Danny García () – Boxing Jon Jones () – Mixed martial arts Anderson Silva () – Mixed martial arts\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n|\n! scope=row |  (6)\n|\n| Boxing\n|\n| Welterweight\n| align=left | Jon Jones () –  Mixed martial arts Manny Pacquiao () – Boxing Ronda Rousey () – Mixed martial arts Andre Ward () – Boxing\n|\n|-\n| 2015\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Mixed martial arts\n| UFC\n| Bantamweight\n| align=left | Donald Cerrone () – Mixed martial arts Terence Crawford () – Boxing Gennady Golovkin () – Boxing Floyd Mayweather Jr. () – Boxing\n|\n|-\n| 2016\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Mixed martial arts\n| UFC\n| Featherweight\n| align=left | Canelo Álvarez () – Boxing Gennady Golovkin () – Boxing Román González () – Boxing Robbie Lawler () – Mixed martial arts\n|\n|-\n| 2017\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Mixed martial arts\n| UFC\n| Flyweight\n| align=left | Terence Crawford () – Boxing Gennady Golovkin () – Boxing Conor McGregor () – Mixed martial arts Andre Ward () – Boxing\n|\n|-\n| 2018\n|  –\n! scope=row |\n|\n| Boxing\n|\n| Light welterweight\n| align=left | Vasyl Lomachenko () – BoxingRose Namajunas () – Mixed martial artsGeorges St-Pierre () – Mixed martial arts\n|\n|-\n|}\nStatistics\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Winners by nationality\n|-\n! scope=col | Country\n! scope=col data-sort-type=number | Winners\n! scope=col data-sort-type=number | Nominations\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 9\n| 21\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 2\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 0\n| 4\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 0\n| 4\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 0\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 0\n| 2\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Multiple winners and nominees\n|-\n! scope=col | Name\n! scope=col data-sort-type=number | Wins\n! scope=col data-sort-type=number | Nominations\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 6\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 2\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 1\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 0\n| 4\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 0\n| 4\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 0\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 0\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 0\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 0\n| 2\n|}\nSee also\n* The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year\n* Sugar Ray Robinson Award\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
