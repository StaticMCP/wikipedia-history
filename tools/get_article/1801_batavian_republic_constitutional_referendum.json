After a previous referendum in 1798 resulted in a new constitution being approved, the French were not satisfied with this constitution, and under their influence a new constitution was written.\nIn 1801, a referendum was held about the new constitution. Non-voters were counted as if they agreed to the new constitution, and the constitution passed with 87.46% in favour. On 16 October 1801, the new constitution became official.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||364,200||87.46\n|-\n|align=left|Against||52,219||12.54\n|-\n|align=left|Total||416,419||100\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||416,419||100\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Source: Direct Democracy\n|}\nReferences"
