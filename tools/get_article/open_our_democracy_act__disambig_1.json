The bill would establish Election Day as a federal holiday, mandate open and top-two primary elections so that all eligible voters can participate in them, and end gerrymandering by requiring independent commissions to draw the districts in each state.\nHistory\nThe bill has been cosponsored by House representatives John Yarmuth, Derek Kilmer, Jared Polis, and Scott Peters. The most recently documented action on it was a review by the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. It has not yet been voted on or gone on the House Calendar.\nDelaney submitted the current version of the bill on July 21, 2017, in the 115th Congress. Delaney had previously proposed two similar bills, one in 2015 (H.R. 2655 of the 114th Congress), and another 2014 (H.R. 5334 of the 113th Congress). In both cases, the House did not bring the bill to a vote.\nSee also\n* Electoral reform in the United States\n* Redistricting\n* United States congressional apportionment\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2981/text Full text of the bill]\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-solution-to-fixing-dysfunction-in-congress/2014/09/02/0f0d0a9a-31e6-11e4-9e92-0899b306bbea_story.html Rep.
