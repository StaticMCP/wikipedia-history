With them was astronaut Sandra Magnus, who joined the Expedition 18 crew after launching on STS-126 and remained until departing on STS-119 on 25 March 2009. She was replaced by JAXA astronaut Koichi Wakata, who arrived at the ISS on STS-119 on 17 March 2009. Gregory Chamitoff, who joined Expedition 18 after Expedition 17 left the station, ended his stay aboard ISS and returned to Earth with the STS-126 crew.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

The conjunction between the debris and the Space Station was not detected until it was too late to perform a collision avoidance manoeuvre. The crew prepared to evacuate the station by closing hatches between modules, and boarding the Soyuz spacecraft that was docked to provide emergency crew escape. The debris did not hit the station, instead it passed by at 16:38 UTC, and the crew were cleared to resume operations about five minutes later.\nExtra-vehicular activity\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"10%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Mission\n! width=\"20%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Spacewalkers\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Start (UTC)\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|End (UTC)\n! width=\"12%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Duration\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\" |EVA 1\n| Yuri LonchakovMichael Fincke\n| 23 December 200800:51\n| 23 December 200806:29\n| 5 hours, 38 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\" |Installed an electromagnetic energy measuring device, (Langmuir probe) on Pirs, removed the Russian Biorisk long-duration experiment, installed the Expose-R experiment package on Zvezda, but subsequently removed it after it failed to activate and transmit telemetry on ground command.
