Four Space Marine classes are playable Sternguard Veteran, Techmarine, Vanguard Veteran and Librarian. The first two focusing on Shooting the later two on melee. The game supports single player and same screen multiplayer modes.\nThe game included a bonus weapon for the use in multiplayer mode in the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, obtained by completing a level.\nThe game was developed and released by THQ for the Xbox 360 in July 2011 and for the PlayStation 3 in August 2011. A Microsoft Windows port was developed by UK based company D3T Ltd and released in May 2014.\nReception\n| MC_X360 = 67/100\n| Destruct_X360 = 6/10\n| EuroG_PS3 = 8/10\n| EuroG_X360 = 8/10\n| GamePro_X360 =\n| GSpot_PS3 = 6/10\n| GSpot_X360 = 6/10\n| GRadar_X360 =\n| GameZone_PS3 = 7/10\n| IGN_PS3 = 6.5/10\n| IGN_X360 = 6.5/10\n| Joystiq_X360 =\n| OPMUK_PS3 = 7/10\n| OXM_X360 = 7.5/10\n| rev1 = Metro\n| rev1_X360 = 5/10\n}}\nThe PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions received \"mixed or average reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\nJames Stephanie Sterling of Destructoid called the Xbox 360 version a \"decent little shooter for fans of the franchise\", and noted that the game was not designed for single-player mode, while criticizing the lack of online multiplayer. GameSpot's Carolyn Petit praised the title's mindless fun and compelling environment while taking issue with the shallow gameplay, local-only co-op, cheap deaths, and poor checkpoint placement. Nathan Grayson of GamesRadar+ liked the Xbox 360 version's quick, violent twin-stick combat, unique classes, and customization but disliked the repetitive gameplay, short runtime, and pace-breaking tutorialization. Arthur Gies of IGN wrote, \"Arcade shooters shouldn't be boring, and they shouldn't be needy and pushy, and Kill Team is often all of the above.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*Video game\n**\n*Tabletop game\n**[https://warhammer40000.com/kill-team/ Official board game website]\n**[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/256066/warhammer-40000-kill-team Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team] at BoardGameGeek"
