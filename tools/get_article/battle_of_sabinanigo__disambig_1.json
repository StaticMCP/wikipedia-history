They eventually faced about 10,000 Nationalist troops, based around the 1st Brigade of the 50th National Division. The attack started on 22 September and fighting continued until 8 November, with perhaps about 2,500 Republican casualties and 3,500 Nationalist casualties.\nThe Republican forces managed to take Biescas, but failed to take Sabiñánigo despite encircling it, or gain complete control of the territory before both sides were exhausted.\nReferences"
