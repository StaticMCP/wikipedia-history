He later served as Head of Maths at a comprehensive school in Middleton, Leeds for eight years.\nPre-parliamentary career\nPrior to his election as Member of Parliament, Sewards stood as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Harrogate and Knaresborough in 2017 and 2019 general elections, finishing third of four candidates on both occasions, with 20.1% and 9.6% of the vote respectively.\nHe was elected as a Leeds City Councillor for Farnley and Wortley in 2022 until his resignation on 28 August 2024, following his election to the House of Commons on 4 July.\nParliamentary career\nIn August 2025, Sewards became the first British MP to create an AI version of himself, in order to interact with constituents. The move was met with a mixed reception, with Sewards' claim that it would allow him to be 'more efficient and more present' for his constituency countered by suggestions that the chatbot could create confusion and damage trust in politicians.\nPersonal life\nHis wife, Alice Smart, has served as a Labour councillor for Armley on Leeds City Council since 2014. The couple have two sons.\nReferences\nExternal links"
