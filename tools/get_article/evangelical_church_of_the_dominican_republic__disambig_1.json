Today it is the second largest Protestant church in the country.\nIn 1978, the Evangelical Church of the Dominican Republic, together with Dominican Episcopal Church founded the Center for Theological Studies of Santo Domingo, a Protestant seminary.\nMemberships\nThe Evangelical Church of the Dominican Republic is a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches, World Methodist Council and the Latin American Council of Churches (Consejo Latinoamericano de Iglesias).\nSee also\n* Religion in the Dominican Republic\n* Protestantism in the Dominican Republic\n* Catholic Church in the Dominican Republic\n* Afro-American religion\n* Religion in Latin America\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060212181320/http://www.clai.org.ec/index.htm Consejo Latinoamericano de Iglesias]\nReferences"
