In what would be recorded as \"US pioneer air mail /light #48\", the flight was the first interstate airmail run in the United States.\nWalter Edwards / Walter Edward Kittel\nIn 1912, from a Seattle hotel, Kittel issued a statement regarding his decision to change his name to Walter Edwards in which he criticized members of his social circle and their idleness as his reasons for becoming estranged with his family.\nSee also\n*EAA Aviation Museum\nReferences"
