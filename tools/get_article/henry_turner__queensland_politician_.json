He was apprenticed in a plant nursery and then worked as a gardener. Upon arriving in Rockhampton in 1880, he worked at the local meatworks for many years where he began to take an active interest in the labour movement.\nPolitical career\nUpon the resignation of James Stewart to stand for a senate seat in the 1901 federal election, Turner, representing the Labour Party, contested the subsequent by-election in June of that year and defeated the Ministerial candidate, John Linnett. The election outcome was successfully challenged in the courts by Linnett and he was declared duly elected.\nTurner once again won the seat at the 1902 state election and in the 1904 state election and remained the sitting member till his resignation in May 1907. Two months later, Premier William Kidston appointed Turner to the Legislative Council, remaining there until the Labour members of the Council voted to abolish the Council in March 1922.\nPersonal life\nTurner married Louisa Langford Stevens in Middlesex in 1866. The couple had 5 children.  His wife Louisa died on 11 February 1882 and was buried in the North Rockhampton Cemetery. He subsequently married Ida Martha Ridgewell (b. 29 March 1879; d. 1965) and they had two children, Gwendoline Ida (1911–1975) and Geoffrey Ridgewell (1918–1998).\nHenry died in Brisbane in 1932 and was buried in Toowong Cemetery.\nReferences"
