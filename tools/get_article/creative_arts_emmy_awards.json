      "text": "# Creative Arts Emmy Awards\n\nThe Creative Arts Emmys are a class of Emmy Awards presented in recognition of technical and other similar achievements in American television programming. They are commonly awarded to behind-the-scenes personnel such as production designers, set decorators, video editors, costume designers, cinematographers, casting directors, and sound editors.\nThe Creative Arts category includes additional awards for outstanding animated programs, commercials, and guest actors.\nThe first Creative Arts Emmys were held in 1970 alongside the 22nd Primetime Emmy Awards due to the growing number of categories at the time. The Primetime Creative Arts and Daytime Creative Arts awards are presented at separate Creative Arts ceremonies on the weekend before their respective main Primetime and Daytime ceremonies. The Emmy awards for Sports are presented in a single ceremony, giving both the main and the creative arts awards.\nAward categories\nSee also\n* List of American television awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.emmys.com Primetime Emmy Awards]\n* [http://www.emmyonline.org/daytime/ Daytime Emmy Awards]\n* [http://www.emmyonline.org/sports/ Sports Emmy Awards]"
