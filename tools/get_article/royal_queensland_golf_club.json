Located beside the Brisbane River is a 10-minute drive from the Brisbane CBD. It has hosted the Australian Open three times: in 1947, 1966, and 1973.\nHistory\nThe Royal Queensland Golf Club was founded in 1920, initially as the Queensland Golf Club. The original course was designed by Carnegie Clark, the Australian Open Champion, and was opened by the Governor-General Lord Forster in 1921. King George V gave the club its Royal Charter in 1921; the King's official letter of notification to the Governor of Queensland was signed by Winston Churchill (then British Secretary of State). Construction of the new Championship course was completed in December 2007. In 2005, the Queensland Government decided to build a second Gateway Bridge over the Brisbane River, which impacted on the original course. The new Royal Queensland layout was designed by Mike Clayton.\nGeography\nThe course is on the northern bank of the Brisbane River.  The course is flat with the front 9 working around the grounds in a clockwise fashion and the back 9 inside the front 9. The Gateway Motorway passes alongside the eastern boundary.\nReciprocal Clubs\nThe Royal Queensland Golf Club has an extensive global and domestic club list.  Clubs include The Australian, Hong Kong, New South Wales, Royal Adelaide, Royal Melbourne and Royal Sydney.\nAustralian Open\nThe winners of these three Australian Open's are:\n*1973 J. C. Snead (USA)\n*1966 Arnold Palmer (USA)\n*1947 Ossie Pickworth (AUS)\nNotable members\nAdam Scott is a current member of the club.\nSee also\n*List of golf clubs granted Royal status\n*List of Australian organisations with royal patronage\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.golf.org.au/default.aspx?s=playgolf-display&clubid=522 Royal Queensland Golf Club Course profile, Golf Australia]\n*[http://www.golf.org.au/default.aspx?s=qld-clubs Queensland Golf Clubs]"
