      "text": "# Foyle's War series 6\n\nSeries 6 of the ITV programme 'Foyle's War' was first aired in 2010, beginning Sunday 11 April; comprising three episodes, it is set in the period from June to August 1945.\nEpisodes\n\"The Russian House\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\"|\n| Writer: Anthony Horowitz || Director: Stuart Orme || Airdate: 11 April 2010 (UK) || Net duration: 93 minutes || Set: June 1945 || Viewers: 7.08 million\n|- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\"|\n|colspan=\"6\"|Guests: Eleanor Bron, Christopher Good, Tim Pigott-Smith, Marcel Iureș, Tom Goodman-Hill, Giles Taylor, Michael Elwyn, Dimitry Drannikov, Rob Heanley, Polly Maberly, Marek Oravec\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\"|In the prelude to the 1945 General Election, Foyle is still unable to resign, given the difficulty of finding a replacement. His former WW1 commanding officer Brigadier Timothy Wilson asks for his help finding an escaped Russian prisoner of war, Ivan Spiakov, who had fought along with the Germans in Normandy.  Seeking refuge, Spiakov meets a former POW colleague, Nikolai Vladchenko, then heads to \"The Russian House\" in London, supposedly a safe house for White Russians. From there he is moved to a hotel, which is raided by the army, and he is captured. Milner, now a newly promoted detective inspector in Brighton, is called to Redwood Lodge to investigate the death of Sam Stewart's new employer, a famous artist who had also employed Vladchenko. Milner appears cool and distant when Foyle arrives at the scene, following on the trail of the Russians. Foyle's investigation leads him to the Russian House, which makes him the target of an attempted hit. Foyle learns of forced repatriations of former POWs to the Soviet Union, where they will probably be executed. Exposure of the practice would reveal the complicity by the British government.\n|}\nCast and characters\nFoyle is still chasing retirement after his resignation at the end of \"All Clear,\" but his superiors are finding it hard to find his replacement. He gives them four weeks before he steps down for good. His former WWI CO, Brigadier Timothy Wilson, arrives from the War Office to enlist his help with the search of a German sympathiser and ethnic Russian POW. Milner, keen to step out of Foyle's shadow and prove himself as a detective, is now in Brighton with his new wife, Edie, and their recently born daughter, Clementine Elizabeth. Stewart has returned to civilian life and had just started working as a domestic for the well-to-do artist, Sir Leonard Spencer-Jones. Also at the artist's house is another anti-communist Russian POW, who is now the groundsman and serves as a witness to the murder. While staying at the London hotel where Spiakov was captured, Stewart befriends Adam Wainwright, who is shot in the shoulder during the attempted hit on Foyle. When Sam visits him in the hospital, she offers to help him at the Hastings guesthouse he recently inherited.\nBackground and production\nThe main theme of this episode is the emerging Cold War in post-war Britain and the commencement of the repatriation of enemy combatants from the UK. For Russian combatants – particularly for enemy sympathisers, anti-communists and those with knowledge of atrocities – their future is bleak. Part of the plot is about members of the Russian Liberation Movement (White Russians), who are seeking to avoid Operation Keelhaul, their repatriation to the USSR. In this context, mention is also made of Almanzora, a ship used by the British to transport returnees to Odessa, during the repatriation of Cossacks (and in which ex-servicemen from the West Indies migrated to Britain in 1947). The show should not be confused with the 1989 novel, The Russia House, by John le Carré; it is also notable that Michael Kitchen starred in the 1990 film adaptation of Le Carré's novel.\n\"Killing Time\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\"|\n| Writer: David Kane || Director: David Richards || Airdate: 18 April 2010 (UK) || Net duration: 92 minutes || Set: July 1945 || Viewers: 7.09 million\n|- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\"|\n|colspan=\"6\"|Guests: Obi Abili, Adam James, Andrew Hawkins, Max Brown, Zoe Telford, Christopher Mellows, Sam Spruell, Neil McCaul, Nicholas Shaw, Trevor White, Victoria Lennox, Nicholas Gleaves, Joseph Long, Nick Dunning, Charlotte Riley, John Sharian\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\"|Sam Stewart and Adam Wainwright are now running a dilapidated local guesthouse together, where Mandy Dean, an unmarried mother with a mixed-race child, is one of the residents. Dean, who had been disowned by her mother, struggles to make ends meet, and her situation is complicated by the return of her former boyfriend, a boxer named Tommy Duggan who was sent to Scotland as a conscientious objector. Foyle investigates a series of nighttime holdups against apparent war profiteers, leading him to the nearby US military base run by Major Wesker. Dean's lover, Private Gabe Kelly, an African-American, appeals to Wesker to let him marry Dean but is later set up as the prime suspect in her murder. Foyle uncovers evidence of Wesker's deputy, MP Sergeant Calhoun, and his corrupt, collusive, and racist activities at the base and of Wesker's guilt in murdering Dean after extorting sexual favours from her in return for promised favourable treatment of her visa application.\n|}\nCast and characters\nFoyle continues his work at the Hastings Police Station, where he opposes a racial segregation order at the town council, and in his spare time, continues his hobby of fly fishing. Foyle is supported by a new assistant detective, DC Hadley. Milner, who is now working in Brighton, does not appear in this episode. Stewart and Wainwright continue their work running and organising the guesthouse, and slowly they begin to become closer as they help Dean and her baby.\nBackground and production\nThe primary theme in the episode is segregation in the US military on its soldiers and in locations visited by soldiers near to its bases (as seen in incidents such as the 1943 Battle of Bamber Bridge in Lancashire and the 1944 Park Street riot in Bristol). Another theme is that of the conscientious objectors (conchies) returning to civilian life along with demobilised soldiers. Underlying all of these is the social stigma against single mothers and tension (particularly among US troops) against interracial relationships.\n\"The Hide\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\"|\n| Writer: Anthony Horowitz || Director: Stuart Orme || Airdate: 25 April 2010 (UK) || Net duration: 89 minutes || Set: August 1945 || Viewers: 7.40 million\n|- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\"|\n|colspan=\"6\"|Guests: Max Brown, Georgie Glen, Richard Goulding, Anastasia Hille, Will Keen, Steven Pacey, Joseph Kloska, Hugh Ross, Andrew Scott, Maggie Service, David Yelland, Dominic Jephcott, Kirsty Besterman, Rupert Frazer, Leon Lissek, David Baron, Chris Wilson as DCS Clarke (uncredited).\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\"|Foyle finally leaves Hastings Police Station to his successor, DCS Clarke. As he returns home, he sees a headline about James Devereaux, the son of a distinguished local family arrested for joining the British Free Corps, a unit supporting Nazi Germany during the war. Based on an earlier connection Foyle had to the family, he undertakes a personal investigation of the case. He visits Devereaux's lawyer and then Devereaux in his cell, where he finds a damaged young man unwilling to fight his treason case. Meanwhile, DI Milner is investigating the murder of Agnes Lyttleton, a researcher for Sir Charles Devereaux. The cases soon merge through Jack Stanford, a comrade of Devereaux in the Free Corps. He discovered that the letters Devereaux was sending to Lyttleton, who'd been a childhood friend, contained coded information, which she forwarded to British intelligence. After Devereaux went missing from the British Free Corps, Stanford assumed the identity of \"Jack\" – a nickname Devereaux's mother used for her son – and continued the correspondence. Stanford murdered Lyttleton to prevent her testifying in support of Devereaux. The final revelation is that Devereaux's father murdered his first wife Caroline to avoid the shame of a divorce, as their son watched unnoticed from a bird hide).\n|}\nCast and characters\nAfter his resignation, Foyle makes plans to go to the US aboard the Queen Mary to \"tie up some loose ends\" &mdash; an oblique reference to his determination to bring Howard Paige to justice, since he was unable to do so in the episode \"Fifty Ships\". We also learn of Caroline Devereaux's involvement as a nurse in Foyle's recuperation from injuries in WWI. This episode sees the final appearance of Anthony Howell as Milner and sees the budding relationship between Stewart and Wainwright bloom into an engagement at Hill House.\nBackground and production\nThe episode prologues with the firebombing of Dresden in February 1945 and ends by highlighting the role of Queen Mary in repatriating returning US troops. It also introduces MI9, whose primary role was to support available European Resistance networks. The Devereaux estate, referred to as Whitefriars in the episode, is fictional but loosely based on the life of William Devereux. In terms of production, there was a three-year gap before the next series aired in 2013.\nInternational broadcast\nSeries Six was broadcast in Australia on ABC weekly from 9 May 2010, in the United States on PBS stations on Masterpiece Mystery! as ''Foyle's War VI'' on 2, 9 and 16 May 2010, and on Netflix as of April 2014.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310455/episodes?season=6 Series 6] on IMDb"
