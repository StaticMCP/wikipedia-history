He is considered as the seventh of the fourteen Manus of the current kalpa (aeon).\nShraddhadeva Manu was the king of the Dravida kingdom before the Pralaya, the great flood. Forewarned about the flood by the Matsya avatar of Vishnu, he saved humanity by building a boat that carried his family and the saptarishi to safety. He is the son of Vivasvana and is therefore also known as Vaivasvata Manu, and his dynasty as the Suryavaṃśa. He is also called Satyavrata (always truthful). Ikshvaku (Sanskrit; ikṣvāku, from Sanskrit ikṣu; Pali: Okkāka), is one of the ten sons of Shraddhadeva Manu, and is credited to be the founder of the Ikshvaku Dynasty.\nSuryavamsha kings\nmanuscript - The Sudarshana Chakra appearing before Emperor Ambarisha and Sage Durvasa ]]\nloses his wealth, by Raja Ravi Varma]]\nsitting upon his throne]]\nThe genealogy of the Ikshvaku dynasty to Rama is mentioned in the Ramayana in two lists. The only difference between the two lists is that, Kukshi is mentioned only in the second list. In the first list, Vikukshi is mentioned as the son of Ikshavaku. The descendants of Vikukshi are known as Vikauva.\nblesses Bhagiratha after allowing Ganga to descend from his matted hair upon the earth. ]]\ngrieving inconsolably at his obligation to banish Rama to the forest.]]\nby his side; flanked by Bharata and Shatrughna, with Lakshmana genuflecting and Hanuman prostrating before Rama.]]\n# Vaivasvata Manu or Satyavrata or Nabhi\n# Ikshvaku\n# Kukshi or Vikukshi or Śaśāda\n# Bāna or Shakuni\n# Kakutstha or Puranjaya (Purañjaya) or Anaranya I\n# Anena (Anenā)\n# Prithu (Pṛthu)\n# Vishtarashva (Viṣṭarāśva), Visvarandhi, or Viśvagandhi\n# Chandra (Cāndra-yuvanāśva)\n# Yuvanashva I (Yuvanāśva)\n# Shravasta (Śrāvasta)\n# Brihadashva (Bṛhadaśva)\n# Dhundumār (Dhundhumāra) or Kuvalayashva (Kuvalayāśva)\n# Dhreedhashva (Dṛḍhāśva) or Kapilashva (Kapilāśva) or Bhadrashva (Bhadrāśva)\n# Pramoda\n# Haryashva I\n# Nikumbha\n# Baharnashva (Barhaṇāśva)\n# Giritashva\n# Amitashva (Amitāśva)\n# Krishashva (Kṛśāśva) or Akrutashva\n# Prasenajit I\n# Yuvanashva II\n# Mandhata\n# Purukutsa I (or Vasuda) and Muchukunda\n# Ambarisha\n# Trasadasyu\n# Sambhruta\n# Anaranya II\n# Preeshadashva\n# Haryashva II\n# Hastya\n# Sumana\n# Tridhanva\n# Trayyaruni\n# Trishanku or Satyavrata II\n# Harishchandra\n# Rohitashva\n# Harita\n# Chanchu\n# Chakshu or Sudeva\n# Vijaya\n# Ruruka or Brahuka\n# Pratapendra\n# Bruka\n# Sushandhi\n# Bahuka\n# Vrika or Bharata II\n# Bahu or Asita\n# Sagara\n# Amshuman\n# Dilipa I\n# Bhagiratha\n# Suhotra\n# Shruti\n# Kukutsa II\n# Raghu I\n# Nabhaga\n# Ambarisha II\n# Shindhudvipa\n# Ayutayu\n# Pratayu\n# Rituparna\n# Sarvakama I\n# Sudasa\n# Kalmashapada\n# Asmaka (Aśmaka)\n# Mulaka or Sarvakama II\n# Dasharatha I\n# Ilibil or Ananaranya III\n# Vishvamashaha\n# Nidhna\n# Animitra (Anamitra)\n# Duliduh or Mūlaka\n# Dilipa II or Dirghabhahu or Khaṭvāṅga\n# Raghu II\n# Aja\n# Dasharatha II\n#  Bharata III\n# Rama\nThe other sons of Dasharatha; Lakshmana and Shatrughna were said to be the kings of Karupada and Malla, and Madhupuri and Vidisha respectively.\nSuryavamsha kings after Rama\nand Kusha, the twin sons of Rama and Sita, capturing the sacrificial horse of his ashvamedha yajna.|322x322px]]\nof the Kurus, getting bitten by the Nāga King Takshaka, who is said to be a member of the Ikshvaku clan.]]\nRama and his brothers were succeeded by their respective sons; Kusha had inherited South Kosala and Lava had inherited North Kosala, while Bharata's children, Taksha and Pushkara, had inherited Takshashila and Pushkalavati respectively.
