Lynch Hill (also known as Lynchs Hill) is the highest point of the locality (). It was  named after Cornelius Lynch who selected Portion 4 in the Parish of King, in 1869.\nThe south-western corner of the locality is within the Lynchs Hill State Forest. Apart from this protected area, there is some rural residential housing in the south-east of the locality with the land use in the north of the locality being grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe two localities of Widgee Crossing North and Widgee Crossing South take their names from the ford over the Mary River.
