In 1813, Siam intervened in a royal dispute in Cambodia, prompting the Cambodian King Ang Chan to seek assistance from Vietnam. Vietnam subsequently stationed troops in Cambodia, transforming it into a protectorate. To strengthen its control over Cambodia, Vietnam constructed three major roads within the country to facilitate military transport. In 1817, it seized the important port of Châu Đốc, and two years later, it dug the Vĩnh Tế Canal between the port and Hà Tiên, annexing Cambodian territory south of the canal.\nIn 1819, Khmer labors were forced to reconstruct the Vĩnh Tế Canal. The Khmer labors were heavily exploited by being forced to do hard work, which resulted in thousands of deaths from fatigue and consequent disease during the canal's construction. Kai, a monk originally from Wat Sambaur who claimed supernatural powers, revolted against the Vietnamese.\nRebellion\nKai occupied the Khmer holy site Ba Phnom and subsequently declared king. Most of his followers were recruited in the area around Tây Ninh. Many Buddhist monks joined his forces and killed Vietnamese. The rebels marched toward Phnom Penh, and three Cambodian generals, Chaophraya Tei (or Somdet Tei, Samdech Tei), Narin Kol and Naike, joined them.\nKing Ang Chan wanted to flee the capital and sent a letter to Saigon to ask for help. Lê Văn Duyệt, the viceroy of Cochinchina, ordered Nguyễn Văn Thoại and Nguyễn Văn Trí to assemble an expeditionary force. The Vietnamese army defeated the rebels, killed many of them. Kai escaped, but was pursued and killed with many monks in Kampong Cham.Kai's assistance, the novice Kuy, escaped to live among the Lao. Other leaders had to surrender, including Chaophraya Tei, Narin Kol and Naike. They were put to death in Phnom Penh and Saigon.\nAftermath\nThis rebellion served as a pretext for Vietnam to re-establish its military presence in Cambodia, since the following year, Vietnam sent Thoại Ngọc Hầu again to \"protect\" the country. Vietnam conscripted more Cambodians to complete the dredging of the Vĩnh Tế Canal, further damaging the Cambodian economy. However, the uprising delayed Vietnam's annexation of Cambodia. Kai was revered by Cambodians, and poems praising the rebellion circulated among the people.\nNotes\n;Footnote\n;Citations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSee also\n* Cambodian rebellion (1811–12)\n* Cambodian rebellion (1840)\n* Anti-Vietnamese sentiment"
