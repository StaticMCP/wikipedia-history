While Metra does not refer to its lines by colors, the Heritage Corridor appears on Metra timetables as \"Alton Maroon,\" after the  Alton Railroad, which ran trains on this route. The name Heritage Corridor refers to the Illinois and Michigan Canal Heritage Corridor. Established in 1984, it runs parallel to the line.\nUnlike other Metra lines, the Heritage Corridor runs during weekday rush hours only in the peak direction–to Chicago in the morning and Joliet in the afternoon, with the trip from Joliet to Union Station taking about 1 hour and 7 minutes. The Rock Island District also serves Joliet with 21 trains.\nAs of February 15, 2024, Metra operates six trains (three in each direction) on the Heritage Corridor on weekdays, with each train serving all stations on the route. All inbound trains originate from  in the morning, and all outbound trains terminate at Joliet in the afternoon. Except for occasional seasonal excursion services, there is no Saturday service. There is currently no off-peak, Sunday, or holiday service on the Heritage Corridor.\nThe Heritage Corridor has the lowest train frequency and fewest number of stations of any Metra line.\nLike the North Central Service and the SouthWest Service, all stations on the route are fully ADA-accessible.\nRoute\nThe line runs from Union Station in downtown Chicago through southwestern suburbs to Joliet. In March 2016, the public timetable shows four Chicago to Joliet trains each weekday. An additional train runs inbound during the afternoon rush hour but as an empty equipment move or deadhead.\nAmtrak's Texas Eagle and Lincoln Service use these tracks from Union Station to Joliet, as do Canadian National freight trains, with CN being the owner of the tracks on which the corridor runs. The Texas Eagle only stops at Chicago and Joliet, while the Lincoln Service also stops at Summit. The Joliet Transportation Center replaced Joliet Union Station on April 11, 2018.\nOn May 16, 2017, Metra announced that the new station for Romeoville had officially broken ground near the intersection of 135th St and New Avenue. The cost of the new station is estimated to be around $4.9 million. The station was opened to the public on February 5, 2018.\nMetra has included the possibility of extending the Heritage Corridor in their Cost Benefit Analysis report. If this were to happen, the Heritage Corridor would continue south from Joliet to Wilmington, with an additional station in Elwood.\nStations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!County\n!Zone\n!Location\n!Station\n!Connections and notes\n|-\n|rowspan=10|Cook\n|1\n|rowspan=4|Chicago\n|\n| Amtrak (long-distance): California Zephyr, , , Empire Builder, , Lake Shore Limited, Southwest Chief, Texas Eagle Amtrak (intercity): , Borealis, Hiawatha, , , Lincoln Service, , Wolverine Metra: , , , ,  Chicago \"L\":  (at ),     (at ) CTA Bus: 1, 7, J14, 19, 28, 56, 60, 120, 121, 124, 125, 126, 128, 130, 151, 156, 157, 192 Pace Bus: 755 Amtrak Thruway: Chicago–Madison and Chicago–Rockford (Van Galder), Chicago–Louisville (Greyhound)\n|-bgcolor=#dfdfdf\n|rowspan=4|&nbsp;\n|\n|Closed 1902, replaced with Halsted Street\n|-bgcolor=#dfdfdf\n|\n|Closed 1984\n|-bgcolor=#dfdfdf\n|\n|Closed 1984\n|-bgcolor=#dfdfdf\n|Central Stickney\n|\n|Closed 1989\n|-\n|2\n|Summit\n|\n| Amtrak: Lincoln Service Pace Bus: 330\n|-\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|&nbsp;\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Willow Springs\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|Closed\n|-\n|3\n|\n| Pace Bus: 390\n|-\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|&nbsp;\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Lemont\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|Closed\n|-\n|3\n|\n| Pace Bus: 755\n|-\n|rowspan=5|Will\n|4\n|Romeoville\n|\n| Pace Bus: 755\n|-\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|&nbsp;\n|rowspan=2|Lockport\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|Closed 1988\n|-\n|4\n|\n| Pace Bus: 755, 834\n|-\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|&nbsp;\n|rowspan=2|Joliet\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|State Prison\n|bgcolor=#dfdfdf|Closed\n|-\n|4\n|\n| Amtrak: Lincoln Service, Texas Eagle Metra:  Pace Bus: 501, 504, 505, 507, 508, 509, 511, 832, 834\n|}\nRidership\nBetween 2014 and 2019 annual ridership remained steady at roughly 730,000. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ridership dropped to 177,838 passengers in 2020 and to 82,197 passengers in 2021.\n}}\nExcursion service\nMetra has offered \"Rails, Trails, and Ales\" excursion service on Saturdays in the fall of 2021; 2023; and 2024, and the summer of 2022. In 2021, two trains in each direction made all stops between Union Station and Joliet from September 18 to October 16.

In 2023, three trains in each direction made all stops between Union Station and Joliet from September 9 to October 14. In 2024, three trains in each direction made all stops between Union Station and Joliet from September 7 to October 12.\nRails, Trails, and Ales service did not return in 2025.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://metrarail.com/content/metra/en/home/maps_schedules/metra_system_map/hc/map.html Heritage Corridor]  service schedule"
