While en route to Polotsk, part of Yaropolk's retinue led by Lyut go hunting for an aurochs and inadvertently run into a rival party led by Oleg. Oleg is given the opportunity to kill the aurochs first but when he fails Lyut kills the animal instead. In rage Oleg murders Lyut and gives chase to his men, running into Yaropolk's main host instead. When Sveneld (one of Svyatoslav's old warriors) tries to defuse the situation, Yaropolk and his men start chasing Oleg. When seeing the chase, Polotsk's lord Rogvolod closes the gates before Oleg can enter. Oleg tries to whip his way through a crowd to reach the gates but falls off the causeway and is killed. Yaropolk decides to have Sveneld answer to pay for Lyut's death but Sveneld thwarts his execution and flees.\nIn the summer, Sveneld returns to Polotsk with Vladimir and his retinue of Viking mercenaries. Vladimir intends to marry Rogvolod's daughter Rogneda, but is rejected because she believes he only wants to marry her to access her father's soldiers and insults Vladimir by calling him the son of a slave - referring to his mother. Furious over the insult to him and his mother Vladimir lays siege to Polotsk. When ordering the Vikings to do a \"berserker attack\", the Vikings coax Vladimir into drinking their \"berserker potion\" to prove himself. Under its influence Vladimir takes part of the charge and rapes Rogneda at the Vikings' encouragement. After passing out Vladimir discovers his men have murdered Rogvolod and his wife, but manages to prevent them from killing Rogneda, seemingly regretting his actions.\nThe war party goes to Kyiv to have Yaropolk answer for Oleg's death. They find Kyiv empty, Yaropolk having fled with the treasury. Yaropolk's Christian wife Irina facilitates a negotiation between the brothers, with Vladimir insisting he wants to solve the matter peacefully. Yaropolk arrives in good faith, but is assassinated by two Vikings. Vladimir is distraught, but his involvement is unclear. As Sveneld proclaims Vladimir the new grand prince, Yaropolk's most loyal follower Varyazhko swears revenge for the murder. Using the treasury Varyazhko is able to recruit a host of Pechenegs. Meanwhile, Vladimir is unable to pay his own mercenaries who refuse to fight. Through able to hold against several direct assaults, Vladimir is unable to drive away Varyazhko. Desperate, the inhabitants of Kyiv, including Rogneda, attempt to sacrifice the son of Vladimir's warrior Fyodor to the gods, resulting in the deaths of both Fyodor and his son when Vladimir does not act. Vladimir eventually agrees to a parley with Varyazhko but is betrayed when the Pechenegs attack. Most of Vladimir's closest followers are killed, but Vladimir and Sveneld are saved when emissaries from the Byzantine Empire arrive. Varyazhko and the Pechenegs have allied with Byzantine rebels, using a Roman city as a base. Having a common enemy they offer to fund Vladimir.\nRealizing the city is impregnable, Vladimir decides to destroy the Roman aqueduct. While searching for the pipe, Varyazhko and his Pechenegs attack. However, they walk into a trap set by Vladimir: when fighting his regular forces the Vikings hurl their longships down the hill causing them to ram into the Pechenegs. Using the destruction and confusion the Vikings are victorious. Vladimir faces off his Varyazhko and defeats him. Insisting his innocence in Yaropolk's death, Vladimir spares Varyazhko. The Vikings are able to locate the pipe and with the water supply cut, the rebels surrender. Vladimir encounters the bishop Anastas who is able to get Vladimir to open up about his guilt. Vladimir admits to being responsible for Yaropolk's death as well as his shame over the death of Rogvolod and Fyodor and the rape of Rogneda. Anastas absolves Vladimir of his sins and moved by the Christian god's ability to forgive Vladimir resolves to stop killing and profess Christianity to the Rus. The film ends with a scene of mass baptism in the Dnieper.\nCast\n* Danila Kozlovsky as Vladimir the Great\n* Svetlana Khodchenkova as Irina, the Byzantine Greek wife of Yaropolk I of Kiev\n* Maksim Sukhanov as Sveneld, voivode of the Grand Duke Sviatoslav Igorevich\n* Igor Petrenko as Varyazhko, the prince of Yaropolk's retinue\n* Aleksandra Bortich as Rogneda, princess of Polotsk, wife of Vladimir the Great\n* Aleksandr Ustyugov as Yaropolk I of Kiev\n* Kirill Pletnyov as Oleg of Drelinia\n* Vladimir Epifantsev as Fyodor, the prince of Yaropolk's retinue\n* Pawel Delag as Anastas\n* Andrey Smolyakov as Rogvolod\n* Joakim Nätterqvist as Khevding, the leader of the vikings\n* Harald Rosenstrøm as Einar, Khevding's sidekick\n* Rostislav Bershauer as Blud, voivode and boyar of Kiev\n* Nikolay Kozak as Lyut, the prince of Yaropolk's retinue\n* Ivan Shmakov as John, Fyodor's son (boy in Kiev)\n* Aleksey Demidov as Samocha\n* Aleksandr Lobanov as Putyata\n* John DeSantis as Berserk\n* Aleksandr Armer as Ulvar\n* Oleg Dobrovan as Valgard\n* Ziedonis Lochmelis as Torvald\n* Daniil Soldatov, Vilen Babichev and Oleg Sizov as Viking chieftains\nProduction\nDevelopment\nThe film was produced by Konstantin Ernst and Anatoly Maksimov, best known for the Russian urban fantasy/supernatural thrillers Night Watch and Day Watch.\nA few scenes were filmed in 2013 to secure funding, a common way to secure finances for large movie productions in Russia.
