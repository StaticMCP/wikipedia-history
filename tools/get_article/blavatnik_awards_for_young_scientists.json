The first Blavatnik Awards were given in New York City on Monday, November 12, 2007. On June 3, 2013, the Blavatnik Family Foundation and the New York Academy of Sciences announced the expansion of the faculty competition to include young scientists from institutions throughout the United States. In April 2017, the Blavatnik Awards program was expanded to the United Kingdom (UK) and Israel. By the end of 2022, the Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists will have awarded prizes totaling US$13.6 million; Blavatnik Award recipients have hailed from 48 countries across six continents.\n* Blavatnik National Awards are for faculty-rank scientists and engineers in Chemistry, Physical Sciences and Engineering, and Life Sciences.\n* Blavatnik Regional Awards are for postdoctoral scientists working in the fields of Chemistry, Physical Sciences and Engineering, and Life Sciences in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.\n* Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists in the United Kingdom are for young, faculty-rank scientists and engineers from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and England.\n* Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists in Israel are for young faculty-rank scientists and engineers early in their independent research careers.\nU.S. Regional Postdoctoral Competition\nThe regional program recognizes postdoctoral researchers working at institutions in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The regional program accepts nominations for scientists working in the life sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering. Nominations are accepted from institutions in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Submissions for the regional program are reviewed by a Judging Panel of senior scientists, science editors, and past Blavatnik winners from the Mid-Atlantic area. As of 2013, winners of the postdoctoral competition receive US$30,000 and finalists receive US$10,000, each in unrestricted cash prizes.\nPast U.S. Regional Winners and Finalists\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

in three disciplinary categories: Life Sciences, Physical Sciences & Engineering, and Chemistry. Nominations are accepted from institutions throughout the United States. Members of the Awards’ Scientific Advisory Council may also submit nominations. Submissions are reviewed by a Judging Panel of senior scientists and past Blavatnik Awards winners. The awards are conferred annually with one winner (“Laureate”) from each disciplinary category selected each year (for a total of three Laureates per year). Each Laureate will receive a US$250,000 unrestricted cash prize and is honored at a ceremony in New York City every fall.\nPast U.S. National Laureates and Finalists\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"line-height:140%\"\n|-\n!width=\"4%\"| Year !! width=\"26%\"| Laureates !! width=\"70%\"|Finalists\n|-\n|2021\n||\nKay M.

A laureate and two finalists in each of three categories (Chemistry, Life Sciences, and Physical Sciences and Engineering) are chosen in the UK every awards cycle. In 2022, prize monies were increased for the UK competition and Laureates are awarded £100,000 and finalists receive £30,000. The first awards were granted during a ceremony held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London on March 7, 2018.\nPast United Kingdom (UK) Laureates and Finalists\n{| class=\"wikitable \"\n|-\n!
