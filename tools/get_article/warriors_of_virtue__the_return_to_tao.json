Ryan Jeffers and his friend Chucky, now 16-year-old martial arts competitors in Beijing, find themselves unexpectedly transported to Tao where it is shown that they are to become Warriors of Virtue.\nCast\n* Nathan Phillips as Ryan Jeffers\n* Kevin Smith as Dogon\n* Nina Liu as Amythis\n* Shedrack Anderson III as Chucky\n* Shuntian Guan as Yun\n* Bao Cheng Li as Yee\n* Jiaolong Sun as Lai\n* Wei Wang as Chi / Yasbin\n* Ying Liang as Tsun\n* Brandon Lin as Quan\n* Wang Zhu as Remo\n* Fusen Chen as Matu\n* Marina as Keo\n* Weiguo Wang as Chieftain\n* Jeff Carrara as Coach\nProduction\nCrawford Prods. produced the sequel with Lance Thompson of Film Brokers Intl. as co-producer.

On February 6, 2002, while waiting for the car back to his motel, and after completing work on Warriors of Virtue 2, Smith decided to walk around the Central China Television film studio grounds, and climbed a flimsy prop tower in a set of another film, lost his footing and fell approximately three stories onto concrete. He was taken to a hospital, then transferred to Beijing. He lapsed into a coma and was on life support for 10 days, until it was ended. He died on February 15, 2002.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
