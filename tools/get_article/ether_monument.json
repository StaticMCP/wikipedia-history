Its design has been attributed to the Boston architect William Robert Ware and to the sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward. It is  tall and is the oldest monument in the public garden.\nDescription\nThe statue depicts a medical doctor in medieval Moorish-Spanish robe and turban&mdash;representing a Good Samaritan&mdash;who holds the drooping body of an almost naked man on his left knee. The doctor holds in his right hand a cloth, suggesting the use of ether that would be developed in centuries to come.\nThe anachronistic use of a Moorish doctor was probably intentional and served to avoid choosing sides in a debate that was raging at the time over who should receive credit for the first use of ether as an anesthetic. A handful of individuals had claimed credit for the discovery of anesthesia, most notably William T. G. Morton and Crawford Long.\nInscriptions\nAt the base of the statue are inscriptions explaining the significance of the discovery of the use of ether as an anesthetic. There are four inscriptions, which include biblical quotations from Isaiah 28:29 and Revelation 21:4:\n*This also cometh forth from the Lord of Hosts which is wonderful and excellent in working. Isaiah.\n*In gratitude for the relief of human suffering by the inhaling of ether a citizen of Boston has erected this monument A.D. MDCCCLXVII.\n*Neither shall there be any more pain. Rev.\n}}\nHistory\nMassachusetts General Hospital, where this procedure took place, is located about a 15-minute walk from the site of the monument. The operating theater at MGH where the experiment took place was renamed the Ether Dome. It is now a National Historic Landmark. Several books have been written about this specific event.\nThe monument was erected in 1868. It was restored and rededicated in 2006.\nUpkeep\nAs an outdoor monument in an area with a harsh climate, the structure has needed regular upkeep and repair. One source of revenue for upkeep of the monument has been income from R. A. Ortega's Written in Granite: An Illustrated History of the Ether Monument, which is available only by making a donation of at least $100 through the Friends of the Public Garden which goes to a fund devoted to preserving the monument for the future.\nReferences"
