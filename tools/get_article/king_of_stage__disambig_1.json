Following his exit from New Edition, and at 16, Brown signed a solo deal with the group's label MCA Records, which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he decided to leave New Edition. His first solo album was released in 1986.\nThe album spawned the singles \"Girlfriend\", \"Seventeen\", and \"Girl Next Door\". None of the singles were major US Hot 100 hits, however, Brown had a number-one R&B hit with the first single, the ballad, \"Girlfriend\".\nProduction\nThe album was produced by Larry Blackmon and John Luongo; Brown and Luongo produced the title track. Brown was unhappy with the production, and elected to go with proven producers for his next album.\nReception\n| rev2 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev3score =\n}}\nAllMusic wrote that \"as enjoyable as the Blackmon-produced tracks are, top honors must go to 'Seventeen' -- a riveting account of a teenage mother who turns to drugs and prostitution -- and the unapologetically sentimental, '70s-like soul ballad 'Girlfriend'.\" The Los Angeles Times called the album \"an ill-conceived mess\" marked by a \"lack of focus, inconsistent production and mostly inferior material.\" The Boston Globe deemed it \"a versatile blend of street funk, rap and ballads.\"\nTrack listing\n| extra1   = White\n| length1  = 6:16\n| title2   = Girl Next Door\n| writer2  = Melvin Wells\n| extra2   = |Keven Kendrick|Wells}}\n| length2  = 4:08\n| title3   = Baby, I Wanna Tell You Something\n| writer3  =\n| extra3   = |Kendrick|Wells}}\n| length3  = 3:47\n| title4   = You Ain't Been Loved Right\n| writer4  = Michael Lovesmith\n| extra4   = Lovesmith\n| length4  = 5:07\n}}\n| extra5   = John Luongo\n| length5  = 5:07\n| title6   = Love Obsession\n| writer6  =\n| extra6   = Luongo\n| length6  = 4:43\n| title7   = Spending Time\n| writer7  = Allen N.
