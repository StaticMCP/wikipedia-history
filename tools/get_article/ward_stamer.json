He represents the electoral district of Kamloops-North Thompson as a member of the Conservative Party of British Columbia. He was also the former mayor of Barriere, British Columbia.\nEarly life and career\nStamer has lived in Barriere most of his life with his wife Carleen, 2 children, and 3 granddaughters. Before entering politics, he has had extensive experience working in the forestry sector as a logging contractor for almost 40 years before selling his business in 2015. He enjoys water and snow skiing and riding his motorcycle in his spare time.\nHe has also been dedicated to public service serving as Chairman to the Barriere Improvement District, overseeing essential services including solid waste management, streetlights, water, and fire services. He has also been a Lions Club member for over three decades, embodying the motto \"We Serve\".\nPolitical career\nDistrict of Barriere\nStamer was elected to Barriere town council after incorporation in 2007 before successfully running for mayor in 2018, and acclaimed as mayor for another term in 2022. He received the most votes as a councillor in municipal elections in 2011 and 2014, and tied for the most votes in 2008. The first time he ran for mayor, Stamer won with 71.47% of the votes defeating his opponent, Mike Fennell. As mayor, he also sat on the Thompson-Nicola Regional District Board. He resigned as mayor after winning his seat in the provincial election.\nIn 2021, Stamer sought the federal Conservative nomination for Kamloops-Thompson-Cariboo, but lost to current MP, Frank Caputo.\n2024 provincial election\nStamer has been a longtime Social Credit Party supporter, but decided to jump on board with the Conservative Party of BC after becoming \"disillusioned\" by the BC Liberals' policies and governance. In March 2024, Stamer was nominated as the Conservative Party of BC's candidate for Kamloops-North Thompson. He went on to win a seat in the Legislative Assembly of BC with 59.7% of the vote.\nStamer currently serves on the official opposition's shadow cabinet as the Critic for Forests. He has since called on the BC NDP to denounce lethal tree spiking in Fairy Creek to protect forestry workers, and to address critical issues facing the forestry sector such as delays in permitting. His policy priorities include healthcare access, affordable housing, economic stability, and revitalizing the local economy by promoting resource industries.\nElectoral record\nReferences\nSee also\n* 43rd Parliament of British Columbia"
