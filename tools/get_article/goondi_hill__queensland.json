In the , Goondi Hill had a population of 437 people.\nGeography\nGoondi Hill is bounded by Bamboo Creek and North Bamboo Creek to the south and south-west. The land is flat, mostly below  above sea level.\nImmediately west of Innisfail, it has some residential overflow from Innisfail including a retirement village in the north of the locality. In the south of the locality the land use is predominantly agricultural, mostly growing sugarcane. Most of the locality contains various civic amenities, such as the race course, the golf course and the showground.\nThe Bruce Highway enters the locality from the east (along Edith Street, Innisfail) and exits to the west (along Palmerston Drive, Goondi Bend).\nThe North Coast railway line enters the locality from the south (Mighell) and exits the locality to the north-west (Goondi Bend / Cullinane) with Innisfail railway station within the locality ().\nHistory\nThe name Goondi is believed to be an Aboriginal word meaning elbow, referring to the bend in the South Johnstone River.\nIn June 1912 there was a meeting that resulted in the creation of the Johnstone River Agricultural Association with the intention to hold their first agricultural show that same year. The first show was held on Friday 11 and Saturday 12 October 1912 in recreation ground (now Callender Park) with exhibits in the Shire Hall and the Oddfellows Hall. In 1935 the show needed more space and the present showgrounds were established with purpose-built buildings and a show ring. The show was held annually apart from 1942 and 1942 when, due to World War II, the army was using the showground. In 1986 many of the showgound's buildings were badly damaged by Cyclone Winifred with further damage sustained during Cyclone Larry in 2006. In 2002 the show introduced a banana packing competition which was very popular.\nDemographics\nIn the , Goondi Hill had a population of 510 people.\nIn the , Goondi Hill had a population of 437 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Goondi Hill.
