The first phase was completed in 1960 and consisted of the construction of the dam. Irrigation tunnels and installation of four power generating units, each of 40 MW capacity with 132&nbsp;kV transmission system, were also completed in 1960. Two additional generating units of 41.48 MW capacity each were added in 1980-81 in the second phase.\nCapacity\nThe total installed capacity of the Warsak Dam Hydropower Project is 243 MW. In June 2012, the Pakistan WAPDA (Water and Power Development Authority) decided to add a 375 MW powerhouse to Warsak, which will raise Warsak's total power generation capacity to 525 MW. No date was given on when the project would be complete.\nRehabilitation\nGermany will loan 40 million euros to Pakistan for the rehabilitation of the Warsak hydroelectric power station built over half a century ago on Kabul River in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. According to Water and Power Development Authority, this is the second time that Warsak hydroelectric power station will be renovated. They plan to overcome several problems, including regaining the capacity loss of 30MW with reliable annual energy generation of 1,144GWh, upgrade and modernise the old system, and achieve another life cycle of 30 to 40 years. The current rehabilitation work will be financed by Germany, France and the European Union Extension is being planned. Germany and France will loan 40 million euros each to Pakistan for the rehabilitation of the Dam. The total cost of the project is euro 162m and it is being co-financed with the German Development Bank (KfW), European Investment Bank (EIB), French Agency for Development (AFD) and Pakistan government contributions.\nSee also\n}}\n* Warsak Canal Project\n* List of dams and reservoirs in Pakistan\n* List of power stations in Pakistan\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.wapda.gov.pk/htmls/pgeneration-dam-warsak.html Warsak Dam] at WAPDA"
