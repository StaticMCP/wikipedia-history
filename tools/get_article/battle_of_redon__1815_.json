Despite their numerical advantage of 4,000–5,000 troops against a small Imperial garrison of 120 men, the Chouans could not capture the town due to their lack of artillery and withdrew after intense fighting.\nEvents\n(2009), where imperial soldiers dug in during the battle.|left]]\nOn June 4, 1815, the Chouan army of , comprising a force of between 4,000 and 5,000 men, launched an assault on the town of Redon, situated at the southwestern extremity of the Ille-et-Vilaine department. The Imperial forces comprised only 120 men, including 100 soldiers from the  and approximately twenty volunteers. These were under the command of Battalion chief Cagnazzoli and Sub-Prefect Baymé, a former squadron leader.\nThe Imperial forces established a defensive position at advanced posts along the avenues leading into the town. However, the Chouans, possessing a significantly larger number of troops, could dislodge them from the suburb's main street on the road to Rennes, situated to the north of the town, as well as from the Codilo district to the west. In this latter instance, the gendarmes, concealed within the vineyards, were circumvented by a detachment of insurgents who had gained access to the area through Parc Anger.\nThe Imperial forces then withdrew to the town hall, which was barricaded, while approximately twenty of their number sought refuge in the bell tower of the Saint-Sauveur Abbey. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Redon allied with the royalists.\nHowever, the Chouans were lacking in artillery and could not overcome the last Imperial strongholds. Furthermore, Sol de Grisolles refused to set fire to the besieged buildings, fearing the fire might spread to the town. Ultimately, the Chouans were forced to evacuate Redon and withdraw to Peillac.\nCasualties\nIn his summary of the 1815 campaign, royalist officer  reports that 17 soldiers and gendarmes were killed during the fighting. Charles-Louis Chassin, in his account, states losses of three dead and six wounded. In 2015, historian Aurélien Lignereux gave a total of four dead.\nIn his memoirs,}}}} Chouan officer  states that the number of casualties on their side was seven killed and approximately thirty wounded. According to , the royalist casualties included six or seven fatalities and approximately thirty individuals wounded, including officers Courson, Breteché, Pioger, Hervieux, and Le Car.
