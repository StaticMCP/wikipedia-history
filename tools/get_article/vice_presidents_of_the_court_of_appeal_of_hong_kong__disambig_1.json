Originally, there were only two vice presidents, dealing with the criminal division and civil division respectively. This later grew to three to include a mixed division, and occasionally up to four to help ease the burden of workload on each vice president.\nRole and responsibilities\nThe vice-presidents usually preside over an appeal hearing unless the chief judge is sitting, then the chief judge presides. From an order of precedence standpoint, they are more senior than regular justices of appeal and often are given some administrative responsibilities by the chief judge. However, from a judicial judgement standpoint, vice presidents, like the Chief Judge, are the same as any Justice of Appeal and do not possess any greater power during appeals.\nList of vice presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!#\n!Name\n!Tenure\n!Subsequent promotions\n!Silk\n!Ref\n|-\n|1\n|Sir Alan Armstrong Huggins\n|1980–1987\n|Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (retired)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Simon Li Fook-sean, GBM\n|1984–1987\n|Retired\n|\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Sir Derek Cons\n|1986–1993\n|Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (retired)\n|\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Sir Ti-liang Yang, GBM\n|1987–1988\n|Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong (retired)\n|\n|\n|-\n|5\n|William James Silke\n|1987–1994\n|Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (retired)\n|\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Kutlu Tekin Fuad\n|1988–1993\n|Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (retired)\n|\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Sir Noel Plunkett Power, GBS\n|1993–1999\n|Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (retired)\n|\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Gerald Paul Nazareth, GBS\n|1994–2000\n|Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (retired)\n|QC (1981)\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Henry Denis Litton, GBM\n|1995–1997\n|Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (retired)(also Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal)\n|QC (1970)\n|\n|-\n|10\n|John Barry Mortimer, GBS\n|1997–1999\n|Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (retired)\n|QC (1971)\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Michael Stuart-Moore, GBS\n|1999–2009\n|Retired\n|QC (1990)\n|\n|-\n|12\n|Gerald Michael Godfrey\n|2000\n|Retired\n|QC (1971)\n|\n|-\n|13\n|Simon Herbert Mayo, GBS\n|2000–2002\n|Retired\n|\n|\n|-\n|14\n|Anthony Gordon Rogers, GBS\n|2000–2011\n|Retired\n|QC (1984)\n|\n|-\n|15\n|Woo Kwok-hing, GBS\n|2004–2011\n|Retired\n|QC (1987)\n|\n|-\n|16\n|Robert Tang Kwok-ching, GBM, SBS\n|2006–2012\n|Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (retired)(also Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal)\n|QC (1986)\n|\n|-\n|17\n|Frank Stock, GBS\n|2009–2014\n|Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal\n|QC (1985)\n|\n|-\n|18\n|Wally Yeung Chun-kuen, GBS\n|2011–2021\n|Retired\n|\n|\n|-\n|19\n|Johnson Lam Man-hon\n|2013–2021\n|Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal\n|\n|\n|-\n|20\n|Michael Victor Lunn, GBS\n|2014–2018\n|Retired\n|QC (1994)\n|\n|-\n|21\n|Andrew Colin Macrae\n|2018–\n|\n|SC (1999)\n|\n|-\n|22\n|Susan Kwan Shuk-hing\n|2019–\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|23\n|Carlye Chu Fun-ling\n|2022–\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences"
