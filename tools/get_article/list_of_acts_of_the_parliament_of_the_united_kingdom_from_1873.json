For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title.  Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n36 & 37 Vict.\nThe fifth session of the 20th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 6 February 1873 until 5 August 1873.\nPublic general acts\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  may be presented to Her Majesty.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n| or the Superannuation Acts Amendment Act 1873|public|23|26-05-1873|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the law relating to the grant of Superannuation Allowances and Gratuities to certain persons who entered the permanent Civil Service of the State between the passing of the Superannuation Act, 1859, and the fourth day of June one thousand eight hundred and seventy.|note4= }}\n|  and The Protection of Life and Property in certain Parts of Ireland Act, 1871.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Thames Embankment Act 1873|public|40|21-07-1873|archived=n|An Act to authorise the acquisition and appropriation by the Metropolitan Board of Works of certain land reclaimed from the River Thames in pursuance of the Thames Embankment Act, 1862. }}\n|  as to the Property of Shrewsbury and Harrow Schools.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  near the town of Youghal;
