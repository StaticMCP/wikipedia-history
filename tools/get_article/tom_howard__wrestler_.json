My philosophy is to train my hardest, do my best and be happy with the outcome. I am not afraid of getting hurt and will fight anyone that they want to put in front of me at any time. I am not saying that to sound like a tough guy but the reality is that they (the K1 office) use their infinite wisdom to do their job in booking the fights and I need to do my job.\"  When asked in the same article about how he got into wrestling and fighting in Japan, Howard explained: \"I was doing pro wrestling in Japan on television for several years with a promotion called Zero-One – The back story to this explains my introduction to K1: Zero One was an offshoot company of New Japan Pro Wrestling established by Shinya Hashimoto. Hashimoto was looking for a new Gaijin (foreign) wrestler to introduce, so I was brought over to wrestle him on a big pay per view called Shingeki. This was when Japanese Pro Wrestling was mimicking MMA so we wore MMA gloves and the matches had MMA rules. I guess the match was highly regarded because we made the covers of the wrestling magazines and even mainstream sports papers. After that I started to get a following in Japan and spent the next several years going back and forth between Japan and the USA for monthly tours. At the end of one of my annual contracts I received word from my manager and friend Rick Bassman that K1 was interested in signing me to a multi year/fight deal and everything just worked out from there. As I said before, I was a huge fan of K1 and had been following it heavily with all of the time I was spending in Japan.\"\nHe made his K1 MMA debut against France's Kristof Midoux on New Year's Eve at K-1 PREMIUM 2003 Dynamite!!. He then fought Mongolian Wrestling champion Dolgorsürengiin Serjbüdee (aka \"Blue Wolf\") at K-1 MMA ROMANEX in May 2004.  This bout was particularly brutal with Howard being kneed in the head and face a total of 46 times.  It was after this fight that K1 changed their MMA rules to make throwing knees to the head of a grounded opponent illegal.  In his next K1 MMA fight, Howard fought against American kickboxer and K1 US Champion Carter Williams in Hawaii at Rumble on the Rock 6.  This fight ended when Williams threw a fury of punches on the ground causing cuts that required Howard to receive a total of 36 stitches.  In June 2005, Howard fought in Hiroshima, Japan on the K1 Grand Prixs show under kickboxing rules against 7' 2\", 400&nbsp;lb. South Korean Choi Hong-man.  This fight was featured in K1's Best Knockouts as Choi caught Howard with a knee to the Head causing a 6\" cut up his forehead and knocking him halfway across the ring. In August 2006, Tom Howard was recruited by the Antonio Inoki's Tokyo Sabres to fight in the International Fight League. His premier fight with the promotion came on September 6, 2006 against Krzysztof Soszynski. In February 2007, Howard competed in the Cage Rage Championships at Wembley Arena in London, England against Wolfslaire fighter Tom Blackledge.  This fight ended quickly when Howard escaped from a takedown attempt and turned into a headkick by Blackledge causing a 5\" cut which ended the fight and required 8 staples to close.
