Its members are former Dio guitar player Craig Goldy and singer Chas West (formerly of Bonham and Tribe of Gypsies).\nIn 2011, Goldy asked West to get together to write and record. After hearing the song \"Livin' Out Loud\", recorded at those demo sessions,  Frontiers Records president Serafino Perugino asked Goldy to create a band. The band added Sean McNabb of Lynch Mob, Dokken and Quiet Riot, as a bass player, and Goldy's former Dio bandmate Vinny Appice as a drummer.\nAlessandro Del Vecchio, Frontiers' in-house writer and producer, wrote (or co-wrote with Goldy) a few tracks, and the band released its eponymous album in 2016.\nDiscography\n* 2016 – Resurrection Kings\n*2021 – Skygazer\nBand members\n* Chas West – vocals (since 2015)\n* Craig Goldy – guitar (since 2015)\n* Sean McNabb – bass guitar (since 2015)\n* Vinny Appice – drums (since 2015)\nReferences"
