The music and the lyrics were created in 1946, and the anthem was adopted later that year. The lyrics were dropped after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the national anthem of the newly independent Tajikistan had used the same melody without any lyrics until 1994, when the country adopted a new anthem, under the title \"Surudi Milliy\", with new lyrics, while retaining the same melody.\nBackground\nThe anthem was used between 1946 and 1994. The music was composed by Sulaymon Yudakov, and the lyrics were written by Abulqosim Lohutiy. The melody is preserved in \"Surudi Milliy\", the current national anthem of Tajikistan, with different lyrics. In 1977, the lyrics were changed to remove mentions of Joseph Stalin. This is the version presented here for the Tajik version, but the Russian version given here is the old one.\nUnlike other former Soviet countries, like Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, that appropriated their old Soviet-era regional anthems as national ones but did so without the Soviet lyrics, Tajikistan retained the Soviet lyrics for some time before replacing them in 1994.\nIt is also one of the nine countries to continuously use their Soviet-era anthems; the other eight being Uzbekistan, Russia (since 2000), Kazakhstan (until 2006), Turkmenistan (until 1996), Belarus, Kyrgyzstan (until 1992), Azerbaijan (until 1992), and Ukraine (until 1992).\nLyrics\n1977 version\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Tajik lyrics (Cyrillic script)\n!Tajik lyrics (Perso-Arabic script)\n!Tajik lyrics (Latin script)\n!IPA transcription\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;
