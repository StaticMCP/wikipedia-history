The same decree approved the initial Regulations on the honorary title, which stated:\nThe honorary title \"Honored Worker of Physical Culture of the Russian Federation\" is conferred upon organizers of the physical culture movement, scientists, and trainers, employees of physical culture collectives, sports facilities, physical culture organizations, educational institutions, and research institutes for merit in the development of physical culture and sports, in organizational and methodological, training, educational, engineering and technical, scientific and pedagogical, and economic activities, improving the system of physical education of the population, mass sports, elite sports, and who have worked in the field of physical culture and sports for 15 or more years.\nIn its current form, the Regulations on the honorary title were approved by Presidential Decree No. 1099 of September 7, 2010, \"On Measures to Improve the State Award System of the Russian Federation\".\nBadge\nThe badge has a uniform design for honorary titles of the Russian Federation and is made of silver, 40 mm in height and 30 mm in width. It takes the form of an oval wreath formed by laurel and oak branches. The crossed ends of the branches are tied with a ribbon at the bottom. The State Emblem of the Russian Federation is located on the upper part of the wreath. On the obverse, in the central part, a cartouche is superimposed on the wreath with an inscription bearing the name of the honorary title.\nA pin for attaching the badge to clothing is located on the reverse. The badge is worn on the right side of the chest.\nTransitional Period\nUntil the adoption of Presidential Decree No. 1341 of December 30, 1995, legal acts on the establishment of honorary titles of the RSFSR were in effect in Russia. After the renaming of the state from \"Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic\" to \"Russian Federation\" (see Law of the RSFSR No. 2094-I of December 25, 1991), the name \"RSFSR\" in the titles of all honorary titles was replaced by the words \"of the Russian Federation.\" Thus, from 1992 to March 30, 1996, the same type of honorary title of the RSFSR, which had existed since 1972, with a name identical to the modern one, was conferred.\nReferences\nLiterature\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*   [https://ru.nagrady.by/nagrada/543 Statistics and list of awardees] // Website \"Awards of Russia\"."
