Lea, 1852\n}}\nEpioblasma stewardsonii, the Cumberland leafshell or '''Steward's pearly mussel', is an extinct species of freshwater mussel in the family Unionidae.\nThis species was endemic to the drainages of the Cumberland River and the Tennessee River in the United States.  Its natural habitat was riffle areas in large- to medium-size rivers. Like most other members of this sensitive genus, it became extinct due habitat destruction and pollution. The last documented occurrence of this species was in 1909.\nIt appears to be most closely related to Epioblasma flexuosa'', which is also now extinct.\nReferences"
