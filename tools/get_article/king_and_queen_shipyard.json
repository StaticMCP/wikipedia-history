For many years it was owned by Peter Everitt Mestaer\nThere was a dry dock here which dated back at least to 1663. This was adjacent to the King and Queen public house, which also gave its name to the King and Queen Watermen's Stairs. The pub closed in 1942, and both the building and the stairs were probably destroyed by bombs during the Second World War.\nShips built at the King and Queen Shipyard\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"border-spacing:0; style=\"width:100%;\"\n!
