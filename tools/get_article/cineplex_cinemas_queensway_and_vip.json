It opened in 2001 and is owned and operated by Cineplex Entertainment. Theatrical films are screened at the venue year-round. On January 17, 2014, a VIP section opened at the venue. It is Toronto's second largest theatre after Cineplex Cinemas Yonge-Dundas and VIP.\nIn 2025, Toronto City Council approved a plan to replace the theatre with condominiums, a park, and a daycare. The plan received backlash from residents. The theatre's lease was subsequently renewed and Cineplex confirmed that the theatre will remain open.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
