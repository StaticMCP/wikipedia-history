It founded the publication ''L'Internationale'' in 1970. The AMR distinguished itself from other Trotskyist groups through its emphasis on and promotion of the concept and practices of self-management.\nThe first Revolutionary Marxist Alliance was established in 1969 by Pabloist activists who had split from the Fourth International in 1965. It dissolved in 1974 to join the Unified Socialist Party (PSU, Tendency B). This union was short-lived, as its members later left to establish the Communist Committees for Self-Management (CCA) alongside former activists from the Revolutionary Communist League (LCR).\nFollowing the 1981 French presidential election, the \"Tendency I\" faction of the CCA revived the name AMR. Members of the original AMR, such as Gilbert Marquis and Michel Fiant, participated in this second AMR, while some later joined the Alternative Rouge et Verte (AREV) and subsequently Les Alternatifs.\nOrigins\nThe movement was heavily influenced by activists like Michel Fiant and Gilbert Marquis, who were initially members of the Internationalist Communist Party. From 1953, Fiant served as secretary of the CGT union at the Derveaux factory in Bezons and led the Pabloist group during the PCI's split through entrism, ultimately joining the French Communist Party (PCF).\nGilbert Marquis spent time in Yugoslavia, working with labor brigades supporting the regime of Josip Broz Tito against Joseph Stalin, and later became a permanent union representative for the CGT at Chausson factories in Gennevilliers.\nTheir entrism activities, supported by Michel Pablo, failed by 1958 when the PCF purged the activists behind Tribune de discussion, marking the end of this strategic approach.\nFormation of the AMR\nThe AMR was founded in 1969 by militants of the Fourth International's Revolutionary Marxist Tendency (TMR-IV), along with students and high school activists radicalized by the events of May 1968. Among the new members were Maurice Najman, Maurice Ronai, and Bernard Schalscha from Collège-lycée Jacques-Decour, as well as other notable figures like Joël Grynbaum and Nicolas Baby.\nActivities\nAdvocacy for Self-Management\nThe AMR stood out among Trotskyist organizations for its emphasis on self-management as a revolutionary strategy. It advocated for workers to spontaneously take control of enterprises during revolutionary processes and operate them independently.\nEarly Engagement with Ecology\nThe AMR was an early adopter of ecologist ideas within the French far-left. Its magazine L'Internationale'' published articles on pollution as early as , and later argued that \"the fight against pollution is not a capitalist diversion.\"\nEngagement with New Social Movements\nThe AMR actively participated in new social movements like the Women's Liberation Movement (MLF), the Soldiers' Rights Movement, and early environmental campaigns.\nDissolution\nThe AMR merged with the PSU in 1974, following the departure of Michel Rocard's faction. However, many of its members left after three years to form the Communist Committees for Self-Management (CCA) with former LCR activists.\nLegacy\nThe AMR was revived in 1981 by former members of the CCA, later contributing to the creation of Alternative Rouge et Verte and Les Alternatifs.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
