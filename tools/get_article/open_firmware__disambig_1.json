It originated at Sun Microsystems where it was known as OpenBoot, and has been used by multiple vendors including Sun, Apple, IBM and ARM.\nOpen Firmware allows a system to load platform-independent drivers directly from a PCI device, improving compatibility.\nOpen Firmware may be accessed through its command line interface, which uses the Forth programming language.\nHistory\nOpen Firmware was described by IEEE standard as IEEE 1275-1994. This standard was not reaffirmed by the Open Firmware Working Group (OFWG) since 1998, and was therefore officially withdrawn by IEEE in May 2005.\nFeatures\nOpen Firmware defines a standard way to describe the hardware configuration of a system, called the device tree. This helps the operating system to better understand the configuration of the host computer, relying less on user configuration and hardware polling. For example, Open Firmware is essential for reliably identifying slave I2C devices like temperature sensors for hardware monitoring, whereas the alternative solution of performing a blind probe of the I2C bus, as has to be done by software like lm_sensors on generic hardware, is known to result in serious hardware issues under certain circumstances.\nOpen Firmware Forth Code may be compiled into FCode, a bytecode which is independent of instruction set architecture. A PCI card may include a program, compiled to FCode, which runs on any Open Firmware system. In this way, it can provide boot-time diagnostics, configuration code, and device drivers. FCode is also very compact, so that a disk driver may require only one or two kilobytes. Therefore, many of the same I/O cards can be used on Sun systems and Macintoshes that used Open Firmware. FCode implements ANS Forth and a subset of the Open Firmware library.\nBeing based upon an interactive programming language, Open Firmware can be used to efficiently test and bring up new hardware. It allows drivers to be written and tested interactively. Operational video and mouse drivers are the only prerequisite for a graphical interface suitable for end-user diagnostics. Apple shipped such a diagnostic \"operating system\" in many Power Macintoshes. Sun also shipped an FCode-based diagnostic tool suite called OpenBoot Diagnostics (OBDiag) used by customer service support and hardware manufacturing teams\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19504-01/802-3241/802-3241.pdf Sun's OpenBoot 2.x command reference manual (Revision A, November 1995)]\n* [https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-1177-10/index.html Sun's SPARC OpenBoot 4.x command reference manual]\n* [https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/1275.ps.gz The last IEEE 1275 text]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110806055045/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/WikiPtype/Boot+Process+on+POWER Boot Process on IBM POWER] (via  [https://web.archive.org Internet Archive])\n* [https://wiki.laptop.org/go/OFW_FAQ OFW FAQ on OLPC Wiki]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120626021529/http://wiki.auroralinux.net/wiki/OBP Aurora SPARC Linux OBP reference guide] (via  [https://web.archive.org Internet Archive])\n* [http://www.firmworks.com/QuickRef.html Quick Reference]"
