This episode marks the last regular appearance of Dayton Callie (Jeremiah Otto) as he was killed by Nick Clark (Frank Dillane).\nPlot\nTeaser\nThrough flashbacks, Ofelia is seen crossing the desert. As she walks along a border fence, she is shot at and she seeks shelter behind a tree. We see the barrel of a gun approaching which is revealed to be  Jeremiah Otto. He gives her water once he realizes she’s American,  only allowing her a few sips. Ofelia asks for refuge only to be denied by Jeremiah because “there’s no use for brown people there.” He denied Ofelia refuge for racist reasons. He instead gives her advice telling her to take shelter and “travel by starlight” as he leaves.\nShe is exhausted by heat, and delusional. As she removes her boots and jacket, she hallucinates, seeing her father Daniel. Daniel warns her the clothing and shoes will protect her from the sun, but she doesn’t put them back on, falling onto the sand, trying to dig a hole.\nDaniel warns her against that as well, growing more urgent as she says she needs to sleep. She mutters in Spanish, and passes out.\nOfelia is later found by Walker on horseback. He takes her, still passed out and extremely sunburnt, back to the Nation’s land to recover.\nPlot\nMadison, Nick, and Alicia wake up to the sound of yelling at the ranch. The poison has killed and there are dead on site, causing havoc. Many are ill. Madison finds Ofelia, mid-escape, beats her and takes her to Black Hat. Walker reveals the poison was anthrax.\nOfelia later confronts Walker over making her a killer without her knowledge. The militia attack Black Hat and, at the cost of lives on both sides, Madison and Alicia steal Walker's trailer of sacred relics. Nick digs under the old cabin and learns Jeremiah and the founders killed three braves who were attacking their cattle, and Walker's father. Madison offers the reliquary and Walker's father's remains but Walker refuses peace.\nLater Madison and Nick reveal to Alicia the lie they backed for Troy’s survival. Alicia is incensed at Troy's crimes, but moreso at her mother’s duplicity. After an explosive scene between Alicia and Madison, Madison reveals to her children her past, in Montgomery, Alabama. She, as a child, killed her abusive, corrupt, alcoholic councilman of a father, to protect her mother. The trio share a tense moment.\nAfter, Madison confronts Jeremiah, saying she knows how to fix the mess that’s unfolded.\nMadison urges Jeremiah to kill himself, saying this will appease Walker, and preserve Jeremiah's legacy. He resists in his typical fashion, sitting down to lecture Madison. Nick enters, and as Jeremiah is making a comparison between Madison and himself, Nick shoots him in the forehead. Madison and Nick stage it as a suicide.\nMadison secretly delivers Jeremiah's head to Walker.\nMeanwhile, Strand finds the Abigail run aground; after clearing it of the dead border patrol, he pops a bottle of 1985 vintage Dom Perignon champagne.\nWe later see him passed out against the radio, waking up to a strongly accented voice; we assume it is the International Space Station passing overhead. A Russian cosmonaut, Valery Vashchenko, shares an intimate moment with Strand. They share quotes from famous writers on their deathbeds. As the connection starts to break, he warns Victor not to wait to waste his chances since he’s not stranded for sure death like Valery. They lose the satellite connection.\nVictor Strand sets fire to the Abigail, taking it in through his dark sunglasses. He leaves armed, with a pack of supplies, as the Abigail burns in the background.\nReception\nmade his final regular appearance as Jeremiah Otto in this episode]]\n\"Children of Wrath\", along with the previous episode: \"The Unveiling\", received positive reviews from critics.
