In the , Inala had a population of 15,273 people.\nGeography\nInala is  by road south-west of the Brisbane GPO.\nInala Avenue/Poinsettia Street is the main roadway east–west and Serviceston Avenue/Rosemary Street and Blunder Road are the main roads stretching north–south.\nHistory\nThe suburb was named Inala by the Queensland Surveyor-General on 10 January 1952, using a Bundjalung word meaning resting time or night time.  It was previously known as Boylands Pocket.\nFollowing World War II there was a shortage of 250,000 houses across Australia. In Queensland alone over 4,000 families were living in makeshift dwellings of tin, calico and canvas. The Queensland and Australian Governments responded by making housing a priority.\nThe history of Inala started as the suburb of Serviceton, established following a meeting held in a Brisbane RSL Hall in May 1946. A group of ex-servicemen, led by Harold (Hock) Davis, were seeking affordable accommodation for their families during the post-war housing shortage. The Serviceton Co-operative Society was formed and they purchased 480 hectares of flood-safe land, which was then divided amongst the shareholders, giving them 800 square metres each. At that stage, Inala was planned as a satellite town set on a broad, high, gently sloping ridge.\nIn 1949–1950 the Queensland Housing Commission purchased Serviceton, comprising approximately 850&nbsp;acres (3.4&nbsp;km2) of land, from the faltering Serviceton Housing Co-operative. The Housing Commission subsequently annexed another 200&nbsp;acres (0.8&nbsp;km2) to the suburb and changed its name to Inala in 1953 to avoid postal confusion with another Serviceton in Victoria.\nInala State School opened on 1 July 1955. In September 1974, it was expanded to include a pre-school.\nInala Methodist Church opened in 1957, becoming Inala Uniting Church in 1977 when the Methodist Church amalgamated into the Uniting Church in Australia.\nInala West State School opened on 2 January 1960 at 2 Deodor Street (end of Biota Street,\n).

Despite the name, Inala State High School was in neighbouring Durack on the north-east corner of Glenala Road and Hampton Street.\nDemographics\nIn the , Inala had a population of 14,849 people, 48.5% male and 51.5% female.

The Bryant family moved onto Blunder Road late 1946, when there was nothing but bushland where Inala now stands. They saw Inala grow from early beginnings to what it is today, a mature, successful multi cultural local community. Les and his wife Margaret still live in the Inala district today in retirement, in sister suburb Durack. Les was succeeded by Milton Dick (Australian Labor Party) in 2008, who moved into Federal politics winning the Federal Division of Oxley in 2016. Charles Strunk (ALP) won the renamed old Ward of Richlands, now Forest Lake Ward, in 2016, to become the new Brisbane City Councillor for Forest Lake Ward. Annastacia Palaszczuk (ALP) was the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Inala from 2006 to 2023; she became Premier of Queensland in 2015 and retained her position until her retirement in 2023. A by-election was held in March 2024 to elect Margie Nightingale. She retained her seat in the 2024 Queensland state election\nArchitecture\nThe development of Inala coincided with the emergence of architectural modernism in Australia. The innovative designs of young southern architects such as Robin Boyd, Roy Grounds and Harry Seidler featured the efficient use of space with minimal ornamentation, utilisation of new materials and techniques, and above all design simplicity, while striving to build solid houses that would require little maintenance. Inala was designed and built in Modernist Revival style with elements of Art Deco. It was both aesthetically successful and a practical architectural solution.\nThe post-war worldwide shortage of building materials coupled with huge demands created the impetus for exploring and using new materials and techniques in Inala. The choice to use reinforced concrete in the construction of Inala houses was made because of its strength, reliability and flexibility. Inala also had the advantage of good access to the local cement and concrete made from washed river sand and lime from Moreton Bay coral shipped up the river by barge and processed at Darra. Concrete was an ideal material for the fashionable Modernist style. Inala houses were built on raised concrete foundations, framed with hardwood timber, floored with hard-wearing brushbox, with silky oak used for window frames. The outer walls were constructed of poured concrete approximately 18&nbsp;cm thick, internal walls and ceilings – with rendered wire lath. These robust construction techniques also served to minimise maintenance costs and achieve a long life span of the houses.\nNotable residents\nFormer Inala resident, Joanna Lindgren was an LNP Australian Senator for Queensland in 2015 and 2016; the niece of Neville Bonner AO, Joanna is the first Aboriginal female Senator for Queensland.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://queenslandplaces.com.au/inala University of Queensland: Queensland Places: Inala]\n* [http://rihghistory.org.au/our-suburbs/inala Richlands, Inala and Suburbs History Group Inc: Inala.]\n* [https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/tqqf2h/alma99284283402061 Inala Elders Digital Stories Resource Project], State Library of Queensland\n* [https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/tqqf2h/alma99183858718602061 Photographs of Inala Civic Centre], State Library of Queensland"
