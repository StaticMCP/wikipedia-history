Operations include maritime patrols in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding waters, as well as readiness for counter-strike and counter-invasion operations during wartime. The Republic of China Marine Corps (ROCMC) functions as a branch of the Navy.\nThe ship prefix, for the Republic of China warships, is ROCS (Republic of China Ship). An older term was the CNS (Chinese Navy Ship), which was mostly used with the pre-WWII era Nationalist Chinese navy ships.\nHistory\nEarly years\n, later served as CNS Hai Yung'' of the Republic of China Navy]]\nThe Republic of China Navy traces its origins to the Imperial Qing Navy. During the Xinhai Revolution, by late October 1911, nearly the entire Qing fleet had defected to the revolutionary forces. Under the leadership of Admiral Sa Zhenbing (), then Minister of the Navy, who deliberately avoided taking military action against the revolutionaries, the Qing fleet effectively aligned itself with the new Republic. This mass defection formed the foundational core of what would become the Republic of China Navy.\nLater the commander of one of those ships, Huang Chung-ying (), became the first Minister of the Navy of the Republic of China, where as Sa Zhenbing had served in several civilian administrative roles in the Beiyang government.\nSeveral naval expansion programs were proposed during the first decade of the republic, but none of them were carried out because of a lack of funding, the outbreak of World War I, and the chaos of the Warlord Era in China. The cruisers that had been acquired by the Qing dynasty between the 1870s and the 1900s remained the main ships of the Chinese fleet through the 1930s. During this time the ROC Navy consisted of three fleets: the Central, Northeast, and Guangdong fleets, and its command structure was divided because of the warlordism in the country. When Sun Yat-sen established his government in 1917 in Guangzhou he was supported by the Navy admirals Cheng Biguang and Lin Baoyi, and when Chiang Kai-shek began his Northern Expedition in 1926 another admiral, Yang Shuzhuang, led part of the Beiyang Fleet to defect to Chiang's forces.\nNavy of the Nationalist China\nFollowing the success of the Northern Expedition, the Republic of China Navy (ROCN) formally realigned with the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-shek. During this time the Navy was commonly referred as the Central Navy ().\nIt is important to note that prior to 1938, the Republic of China Navy operated as an independent national institution, and was not under the authority of the largely KMT controlled Military Affairs Commission of the Nationalist Government. This gave the navy a unique administrative status, distinct from the Army, Military Police, Air Force, and Air Defense Troops, all of which were part of the National Revolutionary Army under the Military Affairs Commission of the Nationalist Government. Ironically,  the Republic of China Navy during that period, is still commonly referred to by mainland Chinese media—particularly pro-communist outlets—as the Navy of the Kuomintang (Chinese: 国民党海军), despite having little direct association with the Kuomintang party itself.\nChiang expressed strong interest in modernizing and expanding the navy, and while some steps were taken—such as acquiring new vessels and reorganizing command structures—these efforts were only partially realized due to limited industrial capacity, financial constraints, and competing military priorities. The most notable examples of these efforts were the acquisition of the two Ninghai-class light cruisers and a number of torpedo boats purchased from the German Reich and the United Kingdom, respectively, reflecting an attempt to build a more capable blue-water force despite the difficult circumstances.\nBy the late 1930s, the ROCN continued to emphasise  to coastal and riverine defense, with a particular emphasis on the Yangtze river, whose navigability allowed ocean-going vessels to penetrate deep into the Chinese interior.\nHowever, when the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the ROCN proved vastly outmatched by the Imperial Japanese Navy. Several of its key ships, including cruisers, were either destroyed in air raids or deliberately scuttled by their crews as blockships along the Yangtze.\nWith most of its combat vessels either destroyed or scuttled during the early naval engagements of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Republic of China Navy suffered a near-total defeat at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Facing a situation where it could no longer effectively operate a fleet, the Ministry of the Navy was dissolved on January 1, 1938, and downgraded to the Navy Command Headquarters under the Military Affairs Commission of the Nationalist Government. This marked the end of the navy’s independent administrative status and its integration into the broader military command structure dominated by the National Revolutionary Army.\nChinese Civil War\n, ex-IJN Destroyer Yukikaze'', one of the most notable naval ship received by the ROCN right after WWII, as part of Japan’s war reparations]]\nFollowing World War II, the Republic of China Navy received a number of former Japanese and American warships as part of postwar realignment and military aid. Most of the Imperial Japanese Navy vessels transferred to China were delivered as part of Japan’s war reparations, while the decommissioned U.S. Navy ships were provided primarily through American military assistance programs. These additions temporarily strengthened the ROCN’s capabilities during the turbulent years of the Chinese Civil War, in which the navy played a key role in escorting supply convoys and ultimately in the evacuation of the ROC government and over one million refugees to Taiwan in 1949.\nIn parallel with these developments, the Republic of China Marine Corps was reactivated on September 16, 1947, as part of a broader naval reorganisation. After the retreat to Taiwan, the navy underwent extensive restructuring and revival, a process later immortalized in the post-1949 ROC Navy anthem, the New Navy ().\nAfter relocation to Taiwan\nThe island of Taiwan was placed under Japanese rule from 1895, with the Imperial Japanese Navy responsible for defending the waters of Taiwan and Penghu. After World War II, on 25 October 1945, the jurisdiction of Taiwan and Penghu was transferred to the Republic of China and the ROCN began its operation in that territory.\nFollowing the relocation of the ROC government to Taiwan, the ROCN was involved in a number of commando attack escorts, evacuation and transport of more displaced soldiers and later to provide patrols and resupply operations to Kinmen and Matsu in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea offshore islands.\nThe Navy Fleet Helicopter Squadron, established on September 1, 1977, marked the official reactivation of naval aviation capabilities for the Republic of China Navy. This milestone ended a nearly-four-decade hiatus in operational naval aviation since the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, during which the original ROC naval air arm had been lost or rendered inactive.\nSince the 1990s the Navy has grown in importance as the emphasis of the ROC's military doctrine moves towards countering a possible People's Republic of China (PRC) blockade, as well as offshore engagement. As of 2004 the ROCN had been working hard to expand its capability in electronic and anti-submarine warfare, as well as the replacement of antiquated warships and support vessels. While for many years the ROCN operated hand me down and foreign designed vessels in recent years they have been operating a higher number of indigenous platforms, sensors, and weapons much of it made by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology.\nIn 2018 Lungteh Shipbuilding was awarded a contract to produce eleven Tuo Chiang Block II corvettes and four minelayers for the Taiwanese Navy.\nIn April 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic the ROCN cut short their semi-annual goodwill mission to Central and South America. The flotilla consisting of two frigates and a supply vessel was subject to 30 days of quarantine after returning to Taiwan.\nIn April 2020 Taiwanese boatbuilder Karmin International Co., Ltd. won a NT$450-million (US$14.9-million) contract to supply the Republic of China Navy with eighteen special operations watercraft and eight RIB tenders, the latter for the Cheng Kung-class frigates. Delivery is scheduled for June 2022. The contract covered only the watercraft themselves with their machine guns, infrared equipment, and boarding ladders sourced separately.\nRank and rating insignia\nOfficer ranks\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0;\"\n|}\nOther ranks\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0;\"\n|}\nEquipment\nTraditionally, most ROCN equipment has been purchased from the United States. The ships themselves have often been older, second-hand vessels without the newest technology. More recently, in the 1990's several ships have been built domestically under licence or through domestic development. The ROCN has also purchased s from France and s from the Netherlands as well as four U.S.  (renamed Keelung) destroyers originally intended for Iran. Despite the ROCN refurbishing and extending the service life of its vessels and equipment, it has suffered from procurement difficulties due to pressures exerted by the PRC.\nOn 12 September 2007, an arms notification was sent to the United States Congress concerning an order for 12 P-3C Orion patrol aircraft and 3 \"spare aircraft\", along with an order for 144 SM-2 Block IIIA surface-to-air missiles. A contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin to refurbish the 12 P-3C Orion aircraft for the ROC on 13 March 2009, with deliveries to start in 2012.\nIn 2008, the ROCN set out to acquire an improved anti-ship capability. On 26 August, an arms notification was sent to Congress for an order for 60 air-launched Harpoon Block II missiles for the 12 P-3Cs. At least a portion of these missiles will be installed on the navy's s.\nOn 29 January 2010, the U.S. government announced five notifications to the U.S. Congress for arms sales to the ROC. In the contracts total US$6.392 billion, ROC Navy would get 2 s for US$105 million, 25 Link 16 terminals on ships for US$340 million, 10 ship- and 2 air-launched Harpoon L/II for US$37 million.\nThe ROC Navy already has 95 older Harpoon missiles in its inventory for the 8 s, 22 newer RGM-84L for the 4 Kidd-class destroyers, 32 sub-launched Harpoon II on order for the 2 Hai Lung-class submarines, and with 60 air-launched Harpoon Block II anti-ship missile on order for the 12 P-3Cs, plus the newly announced 10 ship-launched and 2 air-launched Harpoon II/L sales.\nOn 31 August 2010, it was announced for the next year's defense budget, ROCN planned to lease one or two more s (LST) from the United States, but the 900-ton stealth corvette plan was put on hold, due to lack of funds. That same year, On 29 September, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution, authorizing the U.S. Government for the sale of one more Osprey-class minehunter to the ROC.\nOther ongoing local upgrade programs include locally designed and built Ching Chiang class of 12 patrol ships. Since 2006, seven ships of this class were upgraded to carry four HF-2/3 with W-160 fire control radar from Wu Chin III program (as well as Honeywell H-930 MCS CDS stripped from seven retired Yang-class Wu Chin 3 anti-air warfare destroyers). In 2010 more ships of this class were undergoing this same upgrade program but using CSIST produced fire control radars instead.\nOn 29 December 2010, two LSTs () and four remaining of Adjutant-class coastal minehunters were retired.\nIn 2011, the navy retired several vessels. On 31 October, all eight PCL in the 124th Fleet were retired. On 28 December, the two Lung Jiang-class (PSMM Mk5) guided missile patrol boats (PGG 601 and PPG 602) of the 131st Fleet were retired from ROC Navy service, after entering service in 1978 and 1981 respectively.\nIn June 2018, two s of the US Navy, ex- and ex-, were handed over to the Government of the Republic of China for the Republic of China Navy. The transfer cost was an estimated US$177 million. The transfer of the ships includes the advanced AN/SQR-19 Multi-Function Towed array sonar. Taiwan had previously been blocked from acquiring the AN/SQR-19, and the transfer of the system points to an anti-submarine focus in line with the Knox-class frigates they will likely replace.\nThe keel of a new rescue and salvage ship was laid in March 2022.\nFuture Light Frigates\nThe ROC Navy has started construction on 12 new domestically-built light frigates for the Taiwanese navy. These vessels are in the 2,500-ton weight class and will have two configurations, an anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) version and an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) version. Both variants will be equipped with an OTO Melara 76mm gun with programmable ammunition and a close-in weapons system (CIWS), either a Phalanx 20mm gun system or the indigenous Sea Oryx. The AAW variant will have a 32 cell VLS for TC-2N missiles while the ASW will have two box launchers for 16 TC-2N missiles. The AAW variant will have 8 anti-ship cruise missile launchers, each able to fit either a single HF-2 or HF-3, while the ASW variant will have 16 launchers. The ASW variant is the only variant that will be fitted with Mk 32 light torpedo launchers and a towed variable depth sonar. The frigates will have a BAE System's Artisan radar, Lockheed Martin Canada's CMS-330 combat management system, and either Rolls Royce MT30 or General Electric LM2500 engines for propulsion. The new frigates are intended to become the workhorse of the ROC Navy, replacing the larger OHP and La Fayette class frigates in patrol duties.\nIndigenous \"Landing Platform Dock\" / Amphibious Assault Ship\nIn September 2018, Taiwan confirmed a contract for the first amphibious assault ship built in Taiwan. It will be built by CSBC Corporation, a local shipyard. Four are planned, with the first to enter service around 2021. It will be roughly similar to the US Navy's , but with a slightly smaller displacement. Support features include a full hospital, well deck, full aviation facilities, storage for wheeled vehicles, and dedicated accommodations for a full battalion of Marines. The vessel design will be armed with a 76&nbsp;mm naval gun in the primary position, a close-in weapon system (CIWS) turret, two 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun positions in the forward section, and launchers that can deploy the Hsiung Feng II and III family of anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles. The primary sensor is expected to be a naval version of the indigenous CS/MPQ-90 Bee Eye AESA radar.\nFleet Air Defense Upgrade / Hsun Lien Project\nThe ROC Navy currently lacks a modern fleet defense system. Keelung class destroyers currently use obsolete Mark 26 missile launchers designed from the 1970s and does not currently have a modern centralized air defense combat system like the Aegis. Past US administrations rejected the sale of Aegis radar system and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, including George W. Bush in 2001. Under the George W. Bush administration, the US instead sold Taiwan four Kidd-class destroyers, which did not carry the Aegis and were no longer in service in the US Navy at the time. However, in January 2019, the US government delivered two sets of Mk 41 VLS to Taiwan. The ROC government plans to integrate the MK41 VLS and locally developed Tien-Kung III (Sky Bow III) with its indigenously developed Hsun Lien naval combat system, which is similar to Aegis, to upgrade its ship air defense capabilities. Taiwan has acquired the license and technology to produce additional MK 41 VLS launchers. The ROC Navy currently as of 2019 possesses at least 14 warships compatible with the Mk41. In November 2019 it was reported that the decommissioned amphibious landing ship Kao Hsiung (LCC-1) was being used as a test ship for the Hsun Lien naval combat system project and had been fitted with a large phased array radar system and the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System. In January 2020, it is reported the Tien-Kung III (Sky Bow III) is successfully fired from the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System. In August 2023, it was reported the domestically developed Hua Yang vertical missile launch system (VLS) has passed tests and will be installed on new naval ships in the future. In 2022, it was reported as a short-term solution the ROC Navy will upgrade their Kang Ding-class (La Fayette class) with 32-cell VLS integrated with their domestically developed Aegis-like system with the assistance of a retired French Navy officer. The VLS will have TC-2N surface-to-air missiles, a large upgrade over the existing RIM-72C Sea Chaparral, though it will lack the air defense range of its Keelung Class destroyer with their SM-2 Block IIIA missiles.\nHai Kun-class submarine (formerly: Indigenous Defense Submarine Program)\nIn November 2020, President Tsai Ing-wen opened the submarine construction facility in Kaohsiung with plans to build eight submarines. Construction was to begin with a prototype boat which was to be built over 78 months. The first boat is scheduled to enter service in 2025. Between December 2020 and February 2021, the United States reportedly approved the export of three key systems to Taiwan for the program: digital sonar systems, integrated combat systems and auxiliary equipment systems (periscopes).\nIn 2023, Taiwan revealed its first domestically designed and built submarine, the Hai Kun. The submarine was moved onto a floating dry dock and then launched off the CSBC shipyard in Kaoshiung on February 26, 2024.\nSurface fleet\nDestroyers (4 in service)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:15%;\"|Class\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:10%;\"|Picture\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:15%;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:15%;\"|Ships\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:10%;\"|Displacement\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:;\"|Note\n|-\n|\n|\n|  / destroyer\n|\nDDG-1802  DDG-1803  DDG-1805\n-->\n| 9,574 tonnes\n| Formerly  in US Service built in 1978.

These include high altitude sites like Hsiaohsuehshan which is located at more than 3,000m above sea level. The high altitude sites pose unique challenges to the Navy as they are often located in inaccessible areas and experience extreme weather including months of snow in the winter.\nIn May 2021 the navy ordered a new series of shore based medium-to-long range maritime surveillance radars from NCSIST. Because the radar system will likely come under attack in a war the navy has been pulling staff back to central command centers.\nSee also\n* List of Republic of China Navy ships\n* Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)\n* Republic of China Naval Academy\n* Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)\n* Political status of Taiwan\n* People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) – The naval forces of the People's Republic of China (PRC)\n* Republic of China Navy rank and rating insignia for the rank and rating system of the ROCN (Including the Marine Corps)\n* Maritime industries of Taiwan\n* Taiwan frigate scandal\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
