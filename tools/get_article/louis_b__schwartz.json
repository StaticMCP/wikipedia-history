Schwartz then worked as an attorney for the Securities and Exchange Commission and as head attorney in the criminal division for the U.S. Justice Department in Washington, D.C.  He spent two years as an officer in the U.S. Navy.\nSchwartz was the Benjamin Franklin and University Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, having joined the faculty in 1946. He taught courses in antitrust, criminal law, and professional responsibility. He retired from Penn in 1983. The New York Times said he was \"an influential legal scholar whose work helped bring about significant changes in the penal codes of many states.\" Subsequently he joined the faculty of the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco (as part of its \"Sixty-Five Club\" of senior faculty retired from elsewhere).\nAmong his many writings were Free enterprise and economic organization: government regulation with John J. Flynn and Harry First (Foundation Press, 1985), Law enforcement handbook for police with Stephen R. Goldstein (West Pub. Co., 1970), and Free Enterprise and Economic Organization: Concentration and restrictive practices (Foundation Press, 1966).\nSchwartz died on January 23, 2003, at 89 years of age in San Francisco, California.\nReferences"
