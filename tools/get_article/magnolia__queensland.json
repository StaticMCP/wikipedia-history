In the , Magnolia had a population of 115 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded to the west by Tinana Creek (a tributary of the Mary River) and to the north by Tulesco Road.\nThe Teddington Weir () impounds Tinana Creek with Weir Road crossing the creek through downstream of the weir () connecting Magnolia with neighbouring Teddington. Depending on the flow of water over the weir, the road crossing may be over a dry road or through shallow water. There is a water treatment facility on the Teddington side of the weir. The weir and the water treatment facility are operated by the Fraser Coast Regional Council and supply drinking water to the Maryborough area.\nThe land use in the locality is a mix of crop growing (mostly sugarcane), grazing on native vegetation, and some rural residential housing.\nHistory\nMagnolia State School opened on 8 August 1917 as an \"open-air\" school with 15 students under head teacher Miss M. Gilmer. Its official opening was delayed for various reasons but finally took place in June 1918. In 1940, a decision was made to relocate the school to a new site. In July 1941, the school was officially opened on the new  site on the northern side of Tulesco Road (now within neighbouring Bidwill, ). It closed on 31 December 1963.\nDemographics\nIn the , Magnolia had a population of 130 people.\nIn the , Magnolia had a population of 115 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Magnolia.
