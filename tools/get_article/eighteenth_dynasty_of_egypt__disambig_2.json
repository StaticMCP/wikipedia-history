The Eighteenth Dynasty spanned the period from 1550/1549 to 1292 BC. This dynasty is also known as the Thutmoside Dynasty for the four pharaohs named Thutmose.\nSeveral of Egypt's most famous pharaohs were from the Eighteenth Dynasty, including Tutankhamun. Other famous pharaohs of the dynasty include Hatshepsut (c. 1479 BC–1458 BC), the longest-reigning woman pharaoh of an indigenous dynasty, and Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC), the \"heretic pharaoh\", with his Great Royal Wife, Nefertiti.\nThe Eighteenth Dynasty is unique among indigenous Egyptian dynasties in that it had two queens regnant women who ruled as pharaohs: Hatshepsut and Neferneferuaten, usually identified as Nefertiti.\nHistory\nEarly Dynasty XVIII\nwas the queen consort and great royal wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten and increasingly identified with the female pharaoh Neferneferuaten]]\nwas the sixth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty. Under his reign, Egypt's Kingdom reached its greatest expansion, from Kush in the south to the Hittite Empire in the north.]]\n]]\nDynasty XVIII was founded by Ahmose I, the brother or son of Kamose, the last ruler of the 17th Dynasty. Ahmose finished the campaign to expel the Hyksos rulers. His reign is seen as the end of the Second Intermediate Period and the start of the New Kingdom. Ahmose's consort, Queen Ahmose-Nefertari was \"arguably the most venerated woman in Egyptian history, and the grandmother of the 18th Dynasty.\" She was deified after she died. Ahmose was succeeded by his son, Amenhotep I, whose reign was relatively uneventful.\nAmenhotep I probably left no male heir and the next pharaoh, Thutmose I, seems to have been related to the royal family through marriage. During his reign, the borders of Egypt's empire reached their greatest expanse, extending in the north to Carchemish on the Euphrates and in the south up to Kanisah Kurgus beyond the fourth cataract of the Nile. Thutmose I was succeeded by Thutmose II and his queen, Hatshepsut, who was the daughter of Thutmose I. After her husband's death and a period of regency for her minor stepson (who would later become pharaoh as Thutmose III) Hatshepsut became pharaoh in her own right and ruled for over twenty years.\nThutmose III, who became known as the greatest military pharaoh ever, also had a lengthy reign after becoming pharaoh. He had a second co-regency in his old age with his son Amenhotep II. Amenhotep II was succeeded by Thutmose IV, who in his turn was followed by his son Amenhotep III, whose reign is seen as a high point in this dynasty.\nAmenhotep III's reign was a period of unprecedented prosperity, artistic splendor, and international power, as attested by over 250 statues (more than any other pharaoh) and 200 large stone scarabs discovered from Syria to Nubia. Amenhotep III undertook large scale building programmes, the extent of which can only be compared with those of the much longer reign of Ramesses II during Dynasty XIX. Amenhotep III's consort was the Great Royal Wife Tiye, for whom he built an artificial lake, as described on eleven scarabs.\nAkhenaten, the Amarna Period, and Tutankhamun\nAkhenaten and his family adoring the [[Aten. Second from the left is Meritaten, daughter of Akhenaten.]]\nAmenhotep III may have shared the throne for up to twelve years with his son Amenhotep IV. There is much debate about this proposed co-regency, with different experts considering that there was a lengthy co-regency, a short one, or none at all.\nIn the fifth year of his reign, Amenhotep IV changed his name to Akhenaten (, \"Effective for the Aten\") and moved his capital to Amarna, which he named Akhetaten. During the reign of Akhenaten, the Aten (jtn, the sun disk) became, first, the most prominent deity, and eventually came to be considered the only god. Whether this amounted to true monotheism continues to be the subject of debate within the academic community. Some state that Akhenaten created a monotheism, while others point out that he merely suppressed a dominant solar cult by the assertion of another, while he never completely abandoned several other traditional deities.\nLater Egyptians considered this \"Amarna Period\" an unfortunate aberration. After his death, Akhenaten was succeeded by two short-lived pharaohs, Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten, of which little is known. In 1334 BC, Akhenaten's son, Tutankhaten, ascended to the throne: shortly after, he restored Egyptian polytheist cult and subsequently changed his name to Tutankhamun, in honor to the Egyptian god Amun. His infant daughters represent the final genetically related generation of the Eighteenth Dynasty.\nAy and Horemheb\nAy, c. 1336–1327 BC, 66.174.1, Brooklyn Museum]]\nThe last two members of the Eighteenth Dynasty—Ay and Horemheb—became rulers from the ranks of officials in the royal court, although Ay might also have been the maternal uncle of Akhenaten as a fellow descendant of Yuya and Tjuyu.\nAy may have married the widowed Great Royal Wife and young half-sister of Tutankhamun, Ankhesenamun, in order to obtain power; she did not live long afterward. Ay then married Tey, who was originally Nefertiti's wet-nurse.\nAy's reign was short. His successor was Horemheb, a general during Tutankhamun's reign whom the pharaoh may have intended as his successor in case he had no surviving children, which is what came to pass. Horemheb may have taken the throne away from Ay in a coup d'état. Although Ay's son or stepson Nakhtmin was named as his father/stepfather's Crown Prince, Nakhtmin seems to have died during the reign of Ay, leaving the opportunity for Horemheb to claim the throne next.\nHoremheb also died without surviving children, having appointed his vizier, Pa-ra-mes-su, as his heir. This vizier ascended the throne in 1292 BC as Ramesses I, and was the first pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty.\nThis example to the right depicts a man named Ay who achieved the exalted religious positions of Second Prophet of Amun and High Priest of Mut at Thebes. His career flourished during the reign of Tutankhamun, when the statue was made. The cartouches of King Ay, Tutankhamun's successor appearing on the statue, were an attempt by an artisan to \"update\" the sculpture.\nRelations with Nubia\nThe Eighteenth Dynasty empire conquered all of Lower Nubia under Thutmose I. By the reign of Thutmose III, the Egyptians directly controlled Nubia to the Nile river, 4th cataract, with Egyptian influence / tributaries extending beyond this point. The Egyptians referred to the area as Kush and it was administered by the Viceroy of Kush. The 18th dynasty obtained Nubian gold, animal skins, ivory, ebony, cattle, and horses, which were of exceptional quality. The Egyptians built temples throughout Nubia. One of the largest and most important temples was dedicated to Amun at Jebel Barkal in the city of Napata. This Temple of Amun was enlarged by later Egyptian and Nubian Pharaohs, such as Taharqa.\nFile:Nubian Tribute Presented to King Tutankhamun, Tomb of Huy MET DT221112.jpg|Nubian Tribute Presented to the King, Tomb of Huy MET DT221112\nFile:Nubian Prince Hekanefer bringing tribute for King Tut, 18th dynasty, Tomb of Huy.jpg|Nubian Prince Heqanefer bringing tribute for King Tutankhamun, 18th dynasty, Tomb of Huy\nFile:Nubians bringing tribute for King Tut, Tomb of Huy.jpg|Nubians bringing tribute for King Tutankhamun, Tomb of Huy\nRelations with the Near-East\nAfter the end of the Hyksos period of foreign rule, the Eighteenth Dynasty engaged in a vigorous phase of expansionism, conquering vast areas of the Near-East, with especially Pharaoh Thutmose III submitting the \"Shasu\" Bedouins of northern Canaan, and the land of Retjenu, as far as Syria and Mittani in numerous military campaigns circa 1450 BC.\nFile:Block from a Relief Depicting a Battle MET 213 S3BR2 01GG.jpg|Egyptian relief depicting a battle against West Asiatics.

British Museum\nDating\nRadiocarbon dating suggests that Dynasty XVIII may have started a few years earlier than the conventional date of 1550 BC. The radiocarbon date range for its beginning is 1570–1544 BC, the mean point of which is 1557 BC.\nPharaohs of the 18th Dynasty\nThe pharaohs of Dynasty XVIII ruled for approximately 250 years (c. 1550–1298 BC). The dates and names in the table are taken from Dodson and Hilton. Many of the pharaohs were buried in the Valley of the Kings in Thebes (designated KV). More information can be found on the Theban Mapping Project website. Several diplomatic marriages are known for the New Kingdom. These daughters of foreign kings are often only mentioned in cuneiform texts and are not known from other sources. The marriages were likely to have been a way to confirm good relations between these states. Royal brother-sister marriages were observed, as a means to strengthen the royalty by echoing the practices in their creation myths.\n{| class=\"wikitable sticky-header\"\n|+Dynasty XVIII Kings of Egypt\n! scope=\"col\" | Pharaoh\n! scope=\"col\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Prenomen (Throne name)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:120px\" | Horus-name\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\" | Reign\n! scope=\"col\" | Burial\n! scope=\"col\" | Consort(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Comments\n|-\n| Ahmose I / Ahmosis I\n|\n| Nebpehtire\n| Aakheperu\n| 1549–1524 BC\n| Dra' Abu el-Naga'?\n| Ahmose-Nefertari  Ahmose-Henuttamehu  Ahmose-Sitkamose\n|\n|-\n| Amenhotep I\n|\n| Djeserkare\n| Kauwaftau\n| 1524–1503 BC\n| Tomb ANB? or KV39?\n| Ahmose-Meritamon\n|\n|-\n| Thutmose I\n|\n| Aakheperkare\n| Kanakhtmerymaat\n| 1503–1493 BC\n| KV20, KV38\n| Ahmose  Mutnofret\n|\n|-\n| Thutmose II\n|\n| Aakheperenre\n| Kanakhtuserpehty\n| 1493–1479 BC\n| Wadi C-4\n| Hatshepsut  Iset\n|\n|-\n| Hatshepsut\n|\n| Maatkare\n| Useretkau\n| 1479–1458 BC\n| KV20\n| Thutmose II (Before reign)\n|\n|-\n| Thutmose III\n|\n| Menkheper(en)re\n| Kanakhtkhaemwaset\n| 1479–1425 BC\n| KV34\n| Satiah  Merytre-Hatshepsut Nebtu  Menhet, Menwi and Merti\n|\n|-\n| Amenhotep II\n|\n| Aakheperure\n| Kanakhtwerpehty\n| 1427–1397 BC\n| KV35\n| Tiaa\n|\n|-\n| Thutmose IV\n|\n| Menkheperure\n| Kanakhttutkhau\n| 1397–1388 BC\n| KV43\n| Nefertari  Iaret  Mutemwiya  Daughter of Artatama I of Mitanni\n|\n|-\n| Amenhotep III\n|\n| Nebmaatre\n| Kanakhtkhaemmaat\n| 1388–1351 BC\n| KV22\n| Tiye  Gilukhipa of Mitanni  Tadukhipa of Mitanni  Sitamun  Iset  Daughter of Kurigalzu I of Babylon  Daughter of Kadashman-Enlil of Babylon  Daughter of Tarhundaradu of Arzawa  Daughter of the ruler of Ammia\n|\n|-\n| Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten\n|\n| Neferkepherure-Waenre\n| Kanakhtqaishuti (originally)Meryaten (later)\n| 1351–1334 BC\n| Royal Tomb of Akhenaten, KV55 (?)\n| Nefertiti  Kiya  Tadukhipa of Mitanni  Daughter of Šatiya, ruler of Enišasi  Meritaten?

The Abydos, Saqqara and Ramesseum king lists, all from the New Kingdom of Egypt, provide a list of kings of this dynasty and are in broad agreement on the order of most kings in this dynasty, though they omit Hatshepsut and the Amarna pharaohs as a form of damnatio memoriae; the repudiation of Hatshepsut and the Amarna Period had been state policy since the reign of Horemheb. A Theban tomb, TT19, also provides a king list. It's possible the Turin King List originally listed the Eighteenth Dynasty, but it's now in a fragmentary state and some information is lost, including a section that contained Dynasties 18–19/20. Manetho's now-lost work Aegyptiaca also provided individual reign lengths, however the lengths seem to be inaccurate and later Epitomes of the work were misunderstood by various writers who conflated multiple kings into a single figure, failed to understand the number of kings in this dynasty.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Historical Pharaoh\n!TT19\n!Abydos King List\n!Saqqara King List\n!Ramesseum King List\n!Manetho\n|-\n|Ahmose I\n|Nebpehtire\n|Nebpehtire\n|Nebpehtire\n|Nebpehtire\n|Amosis\n|-\n|Amenhotep I\n|Djeserkare\n|Djeserkare\n|Djeserkare\n|Djeserkare\n|Ammenophis\n|-\n|Thutmose I\n|Aakheperkare\n|Aakheperkare\n|Name lost\n|Aakheperkare\n|Misaphris\n|-\n|Thutmose II\n|Aakheperenre\n|Aakheperenre\n|Name lost\n|Aakheperenre\n|Chebron\n|-\n|Hatshepsut\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Amenssis\n|-\n|Thutmose III\n|Menkheperre\n|Menkheperre\n|Name lost\n|Menkheperre\n|Mesphragmouthosis\n|-\n|Amenhotep II\n|Aakheperure\n|Aakheperure\n|Name lost\n|Aakheperure\n|Amenophis\n|-\n|Thutmose IV\n|Menkheperure\n|Menkheperure\n|Name lost\n|Menkheperure\n|Tuthmosis\n|-\n|Amenhotep III\n|Nebmaatre\n|Nebmaatre\n|Name lost\n|Nebmaatre\n|Amenophis\n|-\n|Akhenaten\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Akhenkherses\n|-\n|Smenkhkare\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|-\n|Neferneferuaten\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|-\n|Tutankhamun\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Rathos\n|-\n|Ay\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Omitted\n|Armais\n|-\n|Horemheb\n|Djeserkheperure Setepenre\n|Djeserkheperure Setepenre\n|Djeserkheperure Setepenre\n|Djeserkheperure Setepenre\n|Oros\n|}\nTimeline of the 18th Dynasty\nImageSize = width:801 height:auto barincrement:12\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:30 right:130 left:20\nAlignBars  = justify\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:-1550 till:-1285\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:100 start:-1550\nScaleMinor  = unit:year increment:10  start:-1550\nColors     =\nid:canvas      value:rgb(0.97,0.97,0.97)\nid:PA   value:green\nid:GP   value:red\nid:eon    value:rgb(1,0.7,1)   # light purple\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbarset:Rulers\nPlotData=\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:S shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbarset:Rulers\nfrom: -1550 till: -1525 color:PA text:\"Ahmose I (1550–1525 BC)\"\nfrom: -1525 till: -1504 color:PA text:\"Amenhotep I (1525–1504 BC)\"\nfrom: -1504 till: -1492 color:PA text:\"Thutmose I (1504–1492 BC)\"\nfrom: -1492 till: -1479 color:PA text:\"Thutmose II (1492–1479 BC)\"\nfrom: -1479 till: -1457 color:PA text:\"Hatshepsut (1479–1457 BC)\"\nfrom: -1479 till: -1425 color:PA text:\"Thutmose III (1479–1425 BC)\"\nfrom: -1427 till: -1401 color:PA text:\"Amenhotep II\" (1427–1401 BC)\nfrom: -1401 till: -1391 color:PA text:\"Thutmose IV\" (1401–1391 BC)\nfrom: -1391 till: -1353 color:PA text:\"Amenhotep III\" (1391–1353 BC)\nfrom: -1353 till: -1335 color:PA text:\"Akhenaten\" (1353–1335 BC)\nfrom: -1336 till: -1335 color:PA text:\"Smenkhkare ?\" (1336–1335 BC?)\nfrom: -1335 till: -1333 color:PA text:\"Neferneferuaten?\" (1335–1333 BC?)\nfrom: -1333 till: -1323 color:PA text:\"Tutankhamun (1333–1323 BC)\"\nfrom: -1323 till: -1319 color:PA text:\"Ay (1323–1319 BC)\"\nfrom: -1319 till: -1292 color:PA text:\"Horemheb (1319–1292 BC)\"\nbarset:skip\nGallery of images\nFile:Trial piece showing a head of an unknown king in profile.
