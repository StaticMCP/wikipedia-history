District of Columbia voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, incumbent President Donald Trump, and running mate Vice President Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his running mate California Senator Kamala Harris. The District of Columbia has three electoral votes in the Electoral College. Prior to the election, Biden was considered to be all but certain to win D.C.\nThe nation's capital is overwhelmingly Democratic and has voted for the Democratic nominee by massive margins in every presidential election it has participated in, ever since it was first granted electors by the passage of the Twenty-third Amendment in 1961. Biden's 86.75-point margin of victory was virtually identical to that secured by Hillary Clinton in 2016.\nNevertheless, the District shifted by 0.02% to the right compared with the previous election, likely due to a decline in third-party voting, making Biden the first non-incumbent Democrat since 1988 to win D.C. by a smaller margin than in the previous cycle. Biden still received the second-highest share of the vote in D.C., behind only Obama in 2008. Along with six states, it was one of seven jurisdictions where Trump improved on his 2016 margins.\nPrimary elections\nThe District of Columbia held primary elections on June 2, 2020.\nRepublican primary\nDonald Trump ran unopposed in the Republican primary, and thus received all of the district's 19 delegates to the 2020 Republican National Convention.\nDemocratic primary\nGeneral election\nFinal predictions\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Ranking\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |The Cook Political Report\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Inside Elections\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Politico\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |RCP\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Niskanen\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |CNN\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |The Economist\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |CBS News\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |270towin\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |ABC News\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |NPR\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |NBC News\n|\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |538\n|\n|}\nPolling\nGraphical summary\nAggregate polls\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;line-height:17px\"\n|+\n!Source of pollaggregation\n!Dates administered\n!Dates updated\n! class=\"unsortable\" |JoeBiden\n! class=\"unsortable\" | DonaldTrump\n!class=\"unsortable\" |Other/Undecided\n!Margin\n|-\n|FiveThirtyEight\n|until November 2, 2020\n|November 3, 2020\n||90.8%\n|5.8%\n|3.4%\n||Biden +85.0\n|}\nPolls\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;line-height:17px\"\n!
