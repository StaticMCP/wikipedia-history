Willis finished two seconds ahead of Marise Chamberlain from New Zealand and her fellow countrywoman Joy Jordan. The winning time of 2:03.7 easily accounted for the Games record set by Englishwoman Gladys Lunn in 1934, with all but last place finisher posting times inside the mark.\nRecords\n| world_mark    = 2:02.0\n| world_place   = Perth, Western Australia\n| world_date    = 3 March 1962\n| world_ref     =\n| games_athlete =\n| games_mark    = 2:19.4\n| games_place   = London, United Kingdom\n| games_date    = 6 August 1934\n| games_ref     =\n}}\nThe following records were established during the competition:\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!
