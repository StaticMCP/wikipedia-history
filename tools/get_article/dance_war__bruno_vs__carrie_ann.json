Drew Lachey, Dancing with the Stars season two champion, hosted the show.\nThe show, based on United Kingdom BBC Television series DanceX, was aired on ABC in the United States. Season one concluded on February 18, 2008. The show was canceled.\nDance War was considered a flop by most ratings' pundits, noting that the ratings showed a steady decline from week 1 through week 7.\nDescription\nThe show's format was based on BBC's Dance X, which also starred Bruno Tonioli. Season one of Dance War premiered on January 7, 2008, on ABC and concluded with a two-hour finale on February 18, 2008.\nThe two stars of this show, Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann, chose and trained two rival teams of singing/dancing amateur performers that competed against each other. The winning team at the end of the season was rewarded a recording deal with Hollywood Records.\nAfter the audition show, Dance War went live with the top 14 contestants. They were divided into two teams of six (three males and three females) with two contestants cut from the competition. In future shows, the two teams competed in various dance styles. Viewers voted for their favorite team. The captain of the losing team, Bruno or Carrie Ann, had to pick one of their team members to leave the show.\nAuditions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
