After his forces were defeated by government troops, he was taken to Stockholm and later beheaded.\nBackground\nAfter the negative treatment of the peasants in Västergötland by the local officials and officers, Sven Hofman, a armourer from Torpa parish, complained. When the peasants in the regions chose him as their representative in the Riksdag, the local sheriff sabotaged him and would not do the necessary work to let Hofman take his place in the Estate of Peasants in Stockholm.\nDisgruntled, he assembled a force of peasants, planning to start an uprising. In the first meeting, only a few were attending, but rumours of the planned uprising spread quickly. On the second day, during a new meeting in some church ruins at Fristad, more angered peasants showed up, and some 300 listened to Hofman's plan to rebel and strengthen the power of the king, Adolf Frederick. Additionally, he compared the planned uprising to the one by the Dalecarlians in 1743.\nRebellion\nAftermath\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*"
