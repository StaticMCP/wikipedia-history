Scroll.in's Nandini Ramnath considered it a \"grim show\" about the \"brutalities of prison life\". She appreciated the work of cinematographer Saumyananda Sahi and production designer Mukund Gupta, as well as the performance of Rahul Bhat. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV opined, \"As a piercing look at Tihar, an absorbing story of a baptism by fire and an insightful snapshot of an era in the life of a nation, Black Warrant warrants bingeing on\". He was particularly impressed by the portrayal of \"a male protagonist who upends notions of belligerence that popular films perpetuate\".\nWriting for The Hollywood Reporter India, Rahul Desai termed it \"skilfully written, performed and crafted\" and took note of its ability to subverse \"easy tropes and resolutions\". The Hindu Shilajit Mitra wrote, \"Black Warrant is a grim, discomfiting series, and the flashes of levity and camaraderie only serve to reinforce the tone.\" He was also appreciative of the performances of Bhat, Zahan Kapoor, and Rajendra Gupta. Shajin Shrijith of The Wire considered its quality to be in the same league as the shows Paatal Lok and Kohrra.\nAudience viewership\nAccording to data released by Netflix, Black Warrant was streamed by 2.3 million viewers in its first three days.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+Name of the award ceremony, year presented, category, nominee of the award, and the result of the nomination\n! scope=\"col\" | Award ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\" | Asia Contents Awards & Global OTT Awards\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2025\n| Best Creative\n| Black Warrant\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| Best Newcomer Actor\n| Zahan Kapoor\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.netflix.com/title/81971071 Black Warrant] on Netflix"
