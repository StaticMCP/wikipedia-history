(西安东信软件公司), known in the Western world as Nice Code Software, or simply Nice Code, was an infamous Chinese developer of shovelware video games for inexpensive plug-and-play consoles. It has developed for various famiclone and Sunplus SPG-based console architectures.\nHistory\nNice Code was originally founded in 1999 as a spin-off company of famous bootleg Famicom developer Dragon Co.''', which was founded in 1997 and also based in Xi'an. Their early games were programmed on unmodified Famiclone and OneBus hardware. They later upgraded to working with the Sunplus SPG2xx series.\nNice Code licensed several ports of Atari 2600/7800 and Intellivision games, remaking them for Famicom hardware for easier inclusion on plug and play consoles, due to Famicom clones being widespread. They later removed all copyrighted content from their ports, in order to sell them on their own plug-and-play consoles.\nReception\nNice Code's ports were not very well received. They were criticized for things such as the poor quality of the in-game music.\nPower Joy Co. Ltd.\nMany of Nice Code's games contain credits for Power Joy, a distributor of plug-and-play consoles. This company is the UK division of a Chinese plug-and-play manufacturer known as Trump Grand.\nGames by them\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Game\n!Chinese Name\n!Hardware\n!Description\n|-\n|Angry Birds\n|愤怒的小鸟\n|Famiclone\n|A bootleg port of the mobile game of the same name for the NES.
