They were based on a design built for use in Brazil five years prior. A derivative was also built for Rhodesia Railways in 1962.\nThe first five units had a  engine and screw couplers.\nThe subsequent units fitted with a  engine, auto couplers and were wired for multiple unit operation.\nThey were used on ore traffic on the Great Northern line, and on general freight on the North Coast and Southern lines. A characteristic addition to the 1250 class in 1961 was a sun visor to help reduce glare.\nWithdrawal & disposal\nTwo were withdrawn in the early 1980s, donating parts to the rebuild of the single 1225 class locomotive. The remainder were withdrawn in 1987. Two units have been preserved:\n*1262 was retained by the Queensland Rail Heritage Division and is on static display as a cutaway at the Workshops Rail Museum, North Ipswich\n*1263 is owned by the Australian Railway Historical Society and stored in Townsville\nStatus table\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
