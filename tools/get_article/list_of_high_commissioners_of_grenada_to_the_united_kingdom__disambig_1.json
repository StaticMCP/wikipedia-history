Though there are a few technical differences (for instance, whereas Ambassadors present their diplomatic credentials to the host country's head of state, High Commissioners are accredited to the head of government), they are in practice one and the same office. The following persons have served as Grenadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.\nList of heads of mission\nHigh Commissioners to the United Kingdom\nSource:\n*Oswald Moxley Gibbs, 1974–1978\n*Raymond Anthony, 1979\n*Fennis Augustine, 1979–1983\n*Oswald Moxley Gibbs, 1984–1990\n*Lynton Noel, 1990–1992\n*Maureen Emmanuel, 1992–1995\n*June Lendore, 1995–1996\n*Marcelle Gairy, 1997–1998\n*Ruth Elizabeth Rouse, 1999–2004\n*Joslyn Whiteman, 2004–2005\n*Joseph S Charter, 2005–2008\n*Ruth Elizabeth Rouse, 2008–2013\n*Joslyn Whiteman, 2013–2016\n*Karl Hood, 2016–2018\n*Kisha Alexander-Grant, 2018–2023\n*Rachér Croney, 2023–Present\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://grenada-highcommission.co.uk/ High Commission for Grenada to the United Kingdom]"
