Simon Gage of The Daily Express gave the album a positive review stating, \"This album couldn’t be a better showcase, mixing classic tracks with contemporary material such as Sting’s \"Fields Of Gold\" and Leonard Cohen’s \"Hallelujah\". The voice is flawless and the production pure class while the man himself is something of a major dish into the bargain.\"\nCommercial performance\nThe album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 14 on April 1, 2012. It was the second highest new entry that week. He also became the first black artist to top the UK classical album chart. Official Charts Company managing director Martin Talbot says, \"This is a truly groundbreaking achievement for Noah Stewart.  Most people naturally look to the Singles and Albums charts for the emergence of new talent, but Noah is sure to become a familiar name for years to come following this landmark breakthrough.\"\nTrack listing\nChart performance\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!Chart (2012)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 40\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Scottish Albums Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 18\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Classical Albums Chart\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Albums Chart\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 14\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Country\n! scope=\"col\"| Release date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format(s)\n|-\n| United Kingdom\n| 26 March 2012\n| CD, digital download\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.noahofficial.com/ Official website]\n* [https://twitter.com/noahsofficial Noah Stewart on Twitter]\n* [http://www.facebook.com/noahstewartmusic Noah Stewart on Facebook]"
