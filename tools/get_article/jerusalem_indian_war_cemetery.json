It contains the mass grave of 79 Indian soldiers from the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, as well as the graves of 290 Turkish prisoners of war. Other war dead, many of them Arab workers employed by the expeditionary corps, are buried in three more separate cemeteries: the Latin (Catholic) Cemetery and the Protestant Cemetery (likely those from Mount Zion), and the Bab Sitna Mariam Muslim cemetery next to the Lions' Gate.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
