In 1983, the society moved to the historic Plumb House, 1380 South Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, Clearwater. In 2014, the society signed a lease with the Pinellas County School Board to lease the old South Ward School. In June 2019, a museum and cultural center was opened with  and six buildings. The front building that houses the museum was built in 1906, the first school paid for with Public Funds. The second building was the first Clearwater High School. It remained a high school until 1924 when the second Clearwater High School was built on Greenwood Ave. The cafeteria was built in 1958 followed by Medis Center (now the Event Center) the kindergarten room, and three smaller buildings in 1971, which now house the office and archives. The museum and cultural center is run by volunteers and donations.
