It was one of the first schools in the state to have compulsory Reserve Officer Training Corps education, a standard from 1934 to 1966.\nThe school avoided destruction when on March 4, 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy attempted to bomb Pearl Harbor a second time. Weather caused one of the two floatplane bombers to drop its bombs 980 feet from the school, shattering some windows.\nRoosevelt High School is most famous for its buildings and landmark domed bell tower constructed in Spanish mission architectural style, currently being restored through grants of the Hawaii State Legislature. Its buildings were used as backdrops in several movie and television productions. Adjacent to the historic bell-towered building is the 2001 Hawaiian basalt sculpture \"Hookahi\" (To Make as One), by Mark Watson.\nShooting\nIn January 2014, a police officer shot a knife-wielding runaway teen who was being detained for trespassing and became disruptive at the school.\nCampus and location\nRoosevelt High School is located in urban Honolulu, Hawaii.
