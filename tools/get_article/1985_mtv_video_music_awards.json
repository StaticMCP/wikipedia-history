The show was hosted by Eddie Murphy at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City.\nDon Henley was the night's biggest winner, taking home four Moonmen, including Video of the Year.  In fact, his video for \"The Boys of Summer\" was also the year's most nominated video, receiving seven nominations in total.  Meanwhile, David Lee Roth turned out to be the most nominated artist that night, receiving eight nominations for two of his videos:  five for \"Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody\" and three for \"California Girls.\"  Nevertheless, Roth came out of the ceremony empty-handed that night.\nOther major nominees included Lindsey Buckingham, Bryan Adams, Eurythmics, Madonna, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Buckingham tied with Don Henley with seven nominations:  three for \"Slow Dancing\" and four for \"Go Insane.\"  Right after him came six-time nominee Adams, who received five nominations for \"Run to You\" and one for \"Heaven.\"  Lastly, Madonna, Eurythmics, and Petty received five nominations apiece:  Madonna split her nominations between \"Like a Virgin\" (three) and \"Material Girl\" (two), while Tom Petty and Eurythmics received all five nominations for \"Don't Come Around Here No More\" and \"Would I Lie to You?,\" respectively.\nBackground\nIn June 1985, MTV announced that the 1985 Video Music Awards would be held on September 13 at Radio City Music Hall.
