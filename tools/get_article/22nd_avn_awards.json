Release. However, two other categories had insufficient entries to warrant a competition: Best Anal Sex Scene – Film and Adult Video Nudes, the latter for the worst release of the year. With the advent of digital video, emphasis started to shift to shot-on-video awards from shot-on-film awards. For the first time, the final award of the night was the Best Video Feature award, whereas in the past it had been the Best Film award. As well, the award for Best Supporting Actress—Video was moved on-stage into the main body of the awards show while the Best Supporting Actor—Film and Best Supporting Actress—Video awards were moved into the announcements segment with awards given off-stage.\nThe show was plagued by several glitches and miscues. Among them, the most noticeable one came when Sean Michaels announced the winner for Best Actress—Film as being Savanna Samson instead of the correct winner, Jenna Jameson. He and co-presenter Jessica Jaymes tried to correct the error but were drowned out by the orchestra and Samson, who, as co-host, was in the wings changing costumes, ran onstage in a towel to collect the award. When told apologetically by Jaymes of the mistake, in an epic wardrobe malfunction, Samson dropped the towel and exited naked back to the off-stage changing area.\nEarlier during the show, when Lit launched into its song, \"My Own Worst Enemy\", Jeremy Popoff knocked over his amplifier when he started playing and the musical performance was cut short. Lit came on again at the end of the show to redo the song so it would be recorded properly for television.\nBesides being recorded for broadcast on Playboy TV, a DVD of the awards show was also issued by Devil's Film.\nPerformance of year's movies\nThe Paris Hilton sex tape, 1 Night in Paris, was announced as the adult movie industry's top selling movie and the top renting movie of the previous year.\nCritical reviews\nLondon's ''Men's World'' magazine gave the show a positive review, calling comedian Thea Vidale \"a hilarious host\" and adding, \"it was clear that the 2005 AVN Awards had been a big hit; it was quicker, slicker and better than previous years.\" The magazine also noted how well-dressed everyone was for the event, stating, \"When the U.S. porn biz does glam, it does it 110 per cent.\" It concluded, \"With music from Smash Mouth and rapper Chingy, it was a good evening, made better by the use of high speed video scrolls to list the many award categories that would bore an audience if they were done live (best packaging?), and little video vignettes including a comedy cracker about Ron Jeremy, which saw him playing the violin while 'factoids' popped up on-screen.\"\nVideo reviewer Denny Recob similarly enjoyed the show: \"The first thing I noticed about this year's show is the comedian was outstanding. Her jokes were funny and topical and she actually knew the correct porn slang and knew the correct pronunciation of the stars' names. This is a big improvement from previous years.\"\nIn Memoriam\nAVN founder Paul Fishbein dedicated the show to two people who died in the previous year: Filmmaker Russ Meyer and film historian and director Jim Holliday.\nSee also\n* AVN Award\n* AVN Best New Starlet Award\n* AVN Award for Male Performer of the Year\n* AVN Award for Male Foreign Performer of the Year\n* AVN Female Performer of the Year Award\n* List of members of the AVN Hall of Fame\n* 2005 GayVN Awards\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041211230414/http://www.avn.com/imagearchive/20/53/72/2053722005_Nominations.pdf 2005 AVN Award nominees] (archived at Wayback Machine, November 11, 2004)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050127014729/http://www.avnawards.com/2005winners.shtml 2005 AVN Award Winners]  Wayback Machine, January 27, 2005)\n* [https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Adult_Video_News_Awards/ Adult Video News Awards]  at the Internet Movie Database\n*\n*\n*"
