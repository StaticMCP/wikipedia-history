He was consecrated a metropolitan of the Church of the East for Iraq on 22 September 1968 at Mar Zaia Cathedral in Baghdad, Iraq.

He was officially elected to the position of Catholicos-Patriarch in February 1970, several months after the death of Mar Thoma Darmo.

The cathedral, located in the Riyadh district of Baghdad, experienced dual bombings: A small improvised explosive device preceded a car detonation setting off a large number of explosives. The bombings occurred within minutes of each other. The bombing was carefully timed to occur just as parishioners exited the church following Sunday morning services. Two civilians were killed in the attacks, in addition to the 20 that sustained injuries.\nDeath\nMar Addai II died in Phoenix, Arizona, on February 11, 2022, at age 74.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
