E. Dodd organ of St. Francis Xavier's Catholic Cathedral, Adelaide, South Australia and the Pilgrim Uniting (originally Congregational) Church organ, also in Adelaide), or left temporarily or permanently disused while being replaced with electronic or digital organs (for example, St. Joseph's Catholic Church, Newtown, New South Wales, and St. Mary's Anglican Church, Kangaroo Point, a suburb of Brisbane.)\nOn 13 May 1977, a public meeting was held in the Chapter House of St. Paul's Anglican Cathedral, Melbourne, and OHTA was formed. At the time, the organisation was conceived as a means for extending the work of the National Trust of Australia. In 1978, OHTA was incorporated under the Victorian Companies Act 1961, directed by a Council made up of representatives from each State of Australia, and offering membership to all members of the general public.\nLegal status\nOHTA is registered with the Australian Government as a Registered Charity recognizing its status as a not-for-profit cultural organization, category: Advancing culture.\nSee also\nOrgan Historical Society, a similar organization in America\nReferences\nExternal links\nDetailed information about the Organ Historical Trust of Australia is available in its own website [http://www.ohta.org.au/].\nAn archive of documents and other material covering the period from the founding of the Organ Historical Trust of Australia in 1977 is held at The University of Melbourne [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Qf6EBB0EdzwJ:www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/collections/archives/collections/pdfs/ohta.pdf+organ+historical+trust+of+australia&hl=en&gl=au&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiEj3H7FzNxBCWLZv77yL5QEBA17xDe4GG-pBDiY83cjTVjvKDZDpk-pX_PU8qc-C-VNxwd6YN5BHnCi-JPoarXnOfulORH0TzD79RVu8g-0yXka7F-drU7APgi3w8r3FIs_JR8&sig=AHIEtbQrA2jGSShC16bcsG7Z59s-ri9-Ng].\nAdditional written and photographic material is held within the State Library of New South Wales – see An archive of documents and other material covering the period from the founding of the Organ Historical Trust of Australia in 1977 is held at The University of Melbourne [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Qf6EBB0EdzwJ:www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/collections/archives/collections/pdfs/ohta.pdf+organ+historical+trust+of+australia&hl=en&gl=au&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiEj3H7FzNxBCWLZv77yL5QEBA17xDe4GG-pBDiY83cjTVjvKDZDpk-pX_PU8qc-C-VNxwd6YN5BHnCi-JPoarXnOfulORH0TzD79RVu8g-0yXka7F-drU7APgi3w8r3FIs_JR8&sig=AHIEtbQrA2jGSShC16bcsG7Z59s-ri9-Ng]."
