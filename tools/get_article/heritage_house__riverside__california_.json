It is part of the Museum of Riverside and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 28, 1973.\nThe house was built in 1891-92 for Mrs. Catherine Bettner, widow of an early citrus pioneer. It was designed by architect John A. Walls of the Los Angeles firm Morgan and Walls. The two-story, 4,000 square foot home resides on Magnolia Avenue, which was a prominent thoroughfare at the time of the house's construction.\nHeritage House is restored to reflect the design and lifestyle of wealthy turn-of-the-century Riverside. In addition to its Queen Anne design, it includes Moorish, Georgian and Chinese elements.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
