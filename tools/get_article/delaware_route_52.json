The route runs from U.S. Route&nbsp;13 Business (US&nbsp;13 Bus.) in downtown Wilmington north to Pennsylvania Route&nbsp;52 (PA&nbsp;52) at the Pennsylvania border near Centerville. DE&nbsp;52 runs through the city of Wilmington and passes through areas of the Brandywine Valley north of Wilmington. DE&nbsp;52 intersects Interstate&nbsp;95 (I-95)/US&nbsp;202 and DE&nbsp;2 in Wilmington and DE&nbsp;100/DE&nbsp;141 and DE&nbsp;82 in Greenville. The entire route is designated as part of the Brandywine Valley National Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway and Delaware Byway, while most of the route is also designated as part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway of the Delaware Byways system. The road was built as the Kennett Pike, a turnpike, between 1811 and 1813. The Kennett Pike was bought by Pierre S. du Pont in 1919 and was widened and paved before being sold to the State of Delaware for $1. The road received the DE&nbsp;52 designation by 1936.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;52 begins at US&nbsp;13 Bus., which is routed on the one-way pair of North Walnut Street northbound and North King Street southbound, in the downtown area of the city of Wilmington. From here, DE&nbsp;52 follows the one-way pair of East 11th Street southbound and East 12th Street northbound to the northwest, forming the northern boundary of Rodney Square along East 11th Street between North King and North Market streets. The route becomes West 11th Street southbound and West 12th Street northbound at the North Market Street intersection. The one-way pair carries three lanes in each direction and heads northwest past downtown high-rise buildings, passing to the north of the DuPont Building along West 11th Street between North Market and North Orange streets and passing to the south of 1201 North Market Street along West 12th Street just west of North Market Street. The northbound direction passes south of Wilmington Hospital between North Washington and North Jefferson streets. Both directions of DE&nbsp;52 merge onto Delaware Avenue, an eight-lane divided highway, and the route reaches an interchange with I-95/US&nbsp;202. Past this interchange, the route narrows to six lanes and leaves downtown Wilmington. DE&nbsp;52 splits from Delaware Avenue by continuing northwest on Pennsylvania Avenue, a four-lane undivided road that heads to the north of the Ursuline Academy and passes through urban areas of homes and businesses. The road intersects the eastern terminus of DE&nbsp;2 in a commercial area on the northern edge of the Little Italy neighborhood and passes under CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line. The route runs through more residential areas north of the Wawaset Park neighborhood, passing to the northeast of the Wilmington Campus of the University of Delaware.\nDE&nbsp;52 leaves Wilmington and becomes Kennett Pike, heading through wooded areas of suburban homes. The road passes north of a park and ride lot at the North Dupont Road intersection before it comes to a junction with Montchanin Road, which heads north to provide access to DE&nbsp;100/DE&nbsp;141. The road continues into Greenville and widens into a divided highway as it comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with DE&nbsp;100/DE&nbsp;141. This interchange has no access from DE&nbsp;100/DE&nbsp;141 southbound to DE&nbsp;52 southbound or from DE&nbsp;52 to DE&nbsp;100/DE&nbsp;141 northbound. Past this interchange, the route continues into business areas, crossing an East Penn Railroad line at-grade before passing to the east of Alexis I. duPont High School. DE&nbsp;52 leaves Greenville and narrows to a two-lane undivided road as it heads into wooded areas then open fields, intersecting the southern terminus of DE&nbsp;82. The road continues through more forested suburban areas, passing to the west of the Wilmington Country Club and to the east of the Delaware Museum of Nature & Science. A park and ride lot located at a church is situated west of the roadway north of the Old Kennett Road intersection. The route passes to the west of the Winterthur Museum and Country Estate and heads into the community of Centerville. DE&nbsp;52 heads northwest to its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania border, where the road continues into that state as PA&nbsp;52 to Longwood Gardens and the borough of West Chester.\nThe entire length of DE&nbsp;52 is part of the Brandywine Valley National Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway and Delaware Byway. The route between Washington and West streets in Wilmington and the Pennsylvania border is also part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway of the Delaware Byways system. DE&nbsp;52 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 28,106&nbsp;vehicles at the Jefferson Street intersection in Wilmington to a low of 7,122&nbsp;vehicles at the southern terminus at US&nbsp;13 Bus. All of DE&nbsp;52 is part of the National Highway System.\nHistory\nOn January&nbsp;21,&nbsp;1811, the Wilmington and Kennett Turnpike Company was incorporated by the Delaware State Legislature to build a turnpike from Wilmington to the Pennsylvania border at Centerville. The turnpike was intended to provide a connection between Wilmington, which was a growing industrial city, and nearby areas in southeastern Pennsylvania, where it would connect to other turnpikes leading to western Pennsylvania. The road was built between 1811 and 1813 at a cost of $30,000. The Kennett Pike was built with a  wide right-of-way, with a  travel surface. The charter of the turnpike gave Christiana Hundred the option to purchase the road in 1820 and remove the tolls. The Kennett Pike had two toll gates north of Wilmington. Tolls along the turnpike were charged based on the type of carriage or vehicle and the amount and type of cargo being carried. People who used the roadway to travel between different parts of their property, along with people traveling to a house of worship or funeral, were not charged tolls.\nIn the 20th&nbsp;century, the automobile rose to prominence and travelers demanded better roads. The alignment of Kennett Pike became home to the estates of many executives from the DuPont Company and other corporations in the early part of the century. Among the executives was DuPont Company secretary and treasurer Pierre S. du Pont, who came up with a plan to modernize Kennett Pike. In 1916, du Pont's plan to modernize the road would widen the turnpike to the same width as Pennsylvania Avenue in Wilmington, eliminate hazards such as narrow bridges, widen culverts, build a bridge near Brecks Lane in Wilmington, widen it to an improved road between  and , and grade the roadway to make it smooth and safe.  Pierre S. du Pont's cousin, Colonel Henry A. du Pont, owned half the shares of the Wilmington and Kennett Turnpike Company and sold his shares to Pierre S. du Pont; he encouraged other shareholders to do so. Work on improving the highway would be delayed by World War I. By April&nbsp;1919, Pierre S. du Pont owned nearly all the shares of the turnpike company. As a result of the acquisition of the road by du Pont, the toll gates were removed.\nFollowing the acquisition of the turnpike company, du Pont began widening and resurfacing the road. The engineering department of the DuPont Company laid out and design the roadway while subcontractors constructed the road. Work on improving the Kennett Pike began just north of the Pyles Ford Road intersection near Winterthur. By July&nbsp;1919,  of concrete had been poured along the road while right-of-way acquisition took place in Centerville. Grading of the northern section of the roadway from Winterthur to Centerville occurred by August of that year. By the end of September, excavation was almost finished and homes began to be moved for paving along the northern portion of the Kennett Pike. Also at this time, plans were made for the bridge at Brecks Lane and land acquisition took place along the road in Greenville. In the later part of 1919, final grading occurred in Centerville while excavation commenced in Greenville. On December&nbsp;13,&nbsp;1919, construction paused for the winter. Work on improving the Kennett Pike resumed in April&nbsp;1920, with the sides of the road between Greenville and the Pennsylvania border dressed. By the end of the spring, nearly all the right-of-way had been acquired and paving of the roadway was being finished. The Kennett Pike opened partially to vehicles on June&nbsp;12,&nbsp;1920; the road would be fully opened by the end of July. The widening and paving of Kennett Pike cost $764,000. The roadway was  wide and had a  wide macadam shoulder. Following the completion of the project, du Pont sold the Kennett Pike to the Delaware State Highway Department for $1. In addition to improving Kennett Pike, du Pont also widened Pennsylvania Avenue in Wilmington, which connected the end of Kennett Pike at Greenhill Avenue to Delaware Avenue, which led to downtown Wilmington. Planning on improving the street began in 1917 and work began in 1919, starting near Riverview Avenue. Work on improving Pennsylvania Avenue progressed from north to south. Pennsylvania Avenue in Wilmington was widened during the 1920s.\nWhen Delaware designated state highways by 1936, DE&nbsp;52 was designated to run from US&nbsp;13 (French Street) in Wilmington north to PA&nbsp;52 at the Pennsylvania border in Centerville, following 11th Street, Delaware Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue in Wilmington and Kennett Pike between Wilmington and the state line. In 1939, the route was widened to four lanes between Rising Sun Lane and Barley Mill Road to alleviate traffic congestion during peak hours. The portion of DE&nbsp;52 along Delaware Avenue was widened to four lanes in November 1940. By 1957, DE&nbsp;52 was split into a one-way pair to reach its southern terminus at US&nbsp;13 (now US&nbsp;13 Bus.). In 2002, DE&nbsp;52 was designated as part of the Brandywine Valley Scenic Highway in the Delaware Scenic and Historic Highways system; it was designated a National Scenic Byway in 2005.\nMajor intersections\nMileposts run from north to south.\n|notes=Southern terminus\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n/ Wilmington Expressway|location1=Baltimore|location2=Philadelphia}}\n|notes=I-95/US&nbsp;202 exit&nbsp;7\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of DE&nbsp;2\n|nspan=2\n}}\n|notes=none\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Interchange; no access from southbound DE&nbsp;100/DE&nbsp;141 to southbound DE&nbsp;52 or from DE&nbsp;52 to northbound DE&nbsp;100/DE&nbsp;141\n}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of DE&nbsp;82\n}}\n|notes=Pennsylvania state line; northern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-052/ DE&nbsp;52 at AARoads.com]\n* [https://www.alpsroads.net/roads/de/de_52/ Delaware Roads - DE&nbsp;52]"
