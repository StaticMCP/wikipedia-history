It displays numerous artifacts of the region, including a fragment of the Garuda capital of the Heliodorus pillar from Vidisha.\nThe palace of Gujari Mahal\nwas built by Tomar Rajput ruler Man Singh Tomar for his wife Mrignayani who belonged to Gujjar tribe. She demanded a separate palace for herself with a regular water supply through an aqueduct from the nearby Rai River. The palace has been converted into an archaeological museum. Rare artifacts at the museum include Hindu and Jain sculptures dated to the 1st and 2nd centuries BCE, miniature statue of Salabhanjika, terracotta items and replicas of frescoes seen in the Bagh Caves.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"  align=\"center\"  colspan=1 cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 80%; width: 100%;\"\n|align=\"center\" colspan=1 style=\"background:#F4A460; font-size: 100%;\"| Artifacts at the Gujari Mahal Archaeological Museum\n|-\n|\nA Different view of Archaeological Museum, Gwalior Fort, Gwalior.jpg|Panorama.\nArchaeological Museum (another view), Gwalior Fort, Gwalior.jpg|Another view.\nArchaeological Museum, Gwalior Fort, Gwalior.jpg|Corner.\nGwalior-museu-exterior.jpg|Exterior.\n|}\nReferences"
