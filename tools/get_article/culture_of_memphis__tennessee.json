The month-long celebration is the largest annual series of public events put on in Memphis. Each year it features a different country, highlighting  aspects of the honored nation's history and culture.\nEach spring since its founding in 1977, Memphis in May has had a significant economic and educational impact to the city. The celebration includes a diverse mix of events, beginning during the first weekend of the month at Tom Lee Park on the Mississippi River, the site of the Beale Street Music Festival.\nDuring International Week, the city focuses on its honored country, part of a larger program in coordination with area schools to broaden cultural awareness among students, as well as a good deal of business linkage.  Other signature events of Memphis in May include the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest (the largest pork barbecue cooking contest in the world) and the closing event of the month—a performance of the Memphis Symphony Orchestra on the river called the Sunset Symphony, also featuring a performance by musicians from the honored country.\nMemphis in May sprang from the Cotton Carnival festivities, which began holding big musical events at the Fairgrounds. In the early 1980s the idea of Memphis in May got started. Germany and Japan were the first two nations to be honored. Events were scattered around the city. A barbecue contest was held in tents in downtown parking lots. The contest proved very popular and has grown substantially, with a dedicated volunteer corps, corporate sponsorship, school involvement, and general citizen attendance. Contestants travel from afar to compete in the barbecue contest and to enjoy the Beale Street Music Fest—originally  held in vacant lots on that storied street.\nCooper-Young Festival\nAn arts festival, the Cooper-Young Festival, is held annually in September in the Cooper-Young district of Midtown Memphis.  Cooper-Young was named one of America’s “10 Great Neighborhoods” by the American Planning Association in 2012.  The event draws artists from all over North America, and includes art sales, contests, and displays.\nSince the late 1980s the Cooper-Young Festival has grown into one of Memphis' most anticipated events, with over 50,000 guests in recent years enjoying a mix of art, music and crafts presented by over 300 artisans from around the country.

King (2006)\nAfter the Yellow Fever epidemics of the 1870s, Memphis' population was very low, and it slowly started being replenished by country people from the Mid-South. Farmers and freed slaves alike brought their musical roots here, and the commercial hurly-burly created a polishing of this talent and heritage, best exemplified by bandleader and composer W. C. Handy.\nMemphis is the home of founders and establishers of various American music genres, including Blues, Gospel, Hip-Hop, Rock n' Roll, and \"rockabilly\" country music (in contrast to the \"rhinestone\" country sound of Nashville). Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, and B. B. King  all got their starts in Memphis in the 1950s. They are respectively dubbed the \"King\" of Country, Rock n' Roll, and Blues.\nOther famous musicians who either grew up or got their starts in the Memphis area include the Box Tops with Alex Chilton, the Gentrys, the Grifters, Nights Like These, Aretha Franklin,  Carl Perkins, John Lee Hooker, Justin Timberlake, Howlin' Wolf, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bobby \"Blue\" Bland, Charlie Rich, Lucero (band), Al Green, Muddy Waters, Big Star, Tina Turner, Roy Orbison, Willie Mae Ford Smith, Sam Cooke, Booker T. and the MGs, Otis Redding, Arthur Lee, The Blackwood Brothers, Isaac Hayes, Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, The Staple Singers, Sam and Dave, Three 6 Mafia, 8 Ball & MJG, Tommy Wright III, Yo Gotti, NLE Choppa, Young Dolph, Key Glock, Moneybagg Yo, Elise Neal, Shawn Lane, Terry Manning, The Sylvers, Aquanet, Steve Cropper, Oblivians, Jay Reatard, Anita Ward, and Andrew Vanwyngarden.\nMemphis is also a haven for classical music, and has produced such opera singers as Ruth Welting and Kallen Esperian. The city has its own opera company, Opera Memphis, which performs in the Orpheum Theatre in Downtown Memphis.  The New York Metropolitan Opera first visited around 1910 and played to packed houses until recently when they quit doing 3-day stands. The Rudi E. Scheidt School of Music at the University of Memphis plays a critical role in music and performance in the city. The Memphis City School district was named one of the \"Best Communities for Music Education\" by the NAMM Foundation in 2013 for the sixth time.\nThe Highland Strip is an area located near the University of Memphis and is known as a haven for the college crowd.  Venues such as Newby's showcase local musicians as well as national touring acts on a weekly basis. But Beale Street in Downtown is the mecca for live performance. Well known musical groups vie for work in this popular venue, crowded by tourists and locals alike. In 2009, Memphis was named as the Society of American Travel Writers 6th Best North American City “For Live Music.”\nDance\nBallet flourishes in Memphis as well. Ballet Memphis, now in its 27th season, strives to interpret the South's cultural legacy through dance, featuring both classical and modern dance choreography. New Ballet Ensemble and School (NBE) combines a professional company composed of the school's instructors with talented students, presenting classical movement fused with other styles (flamenco, jookin', modern, African, etc.) in new interpretations of old stories (e.g. Nut ReMix, a modern and re-imagined Nutcracker). NBE received the 2014 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award (President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities) for \"a program that brings together students from diverse racial, socio-economic and religious backgrounds to build self-confidence, leadership and academic success—and heal a community divided by race—through dance.\"\nLiterature and theater\nWell-known writers from Memphis include Civil War historian and novelist Shelby Foote, made famous by his contributions to The Civil War series on Public Television, and playwright Tennessee Williams, who wrote his first play on Snowden Street and saw it performed on Glenview Street. Dr. Zandria F. Robinson's book This Ain’t Chicago: Race, Class, and Regional Identity in the Post-Soul South (University of North Carolina Press, April 2014), uses literature, pop culture, and interviews to examine how black southerners in Memphis think about race, class, gender, and regional identity. Novelist John Grisham grew up in nearby DeSoto County, Mississippi and many of his books, such as The Firm, The Client and The Rainmaker, are set in Memphis.\nMany works of fiction and literature use Memphis as their setting, giving a diverse portrait of the city, its history, and its citizens.  These include The Reivers by William Faulkner (1962), September, September by Shelby Foote (1977), The Old Forest and Other Stories by Peter Taylor (1985), the Pulitzer Prize-winning A Summons to Memphis by Peter Taylor (1986), The Firm by John Grisham (1991), Memphis Afternoons: a Memoir by James Conaway (1993), Cassina Gambrel Was Missing by William Watkins (1999), The Guardian by Beecher Smith (1999), and The Architect by James Williamson (2007).\nTheater flourishes at Playhouse on the Square and Theatre Memphis.  The Midtown-based Voices of the South is a non-profit, ensemble based theater company whose mission is to create, produce, and perform theatre from diverse Southern perspectives. Working out of Theatreworks (a black-box, alternative theatre owned by Playhouse on the Square), among other companies, is Our Own Voice Theatre Troupe, a non-profit group working to empower people marginalized by mental illness, and striving to engage the community in dialogue about mental health. Overton Square is currently being redeveloped into a theatre and entertainment district.  The area will be anchored by three live-performance theaters, including the existing Playhouse on the Square, the Circuit Playhouse, and the soon to be built [http://www.hattiloo.org/ Hatiloo Theatre]. Also in [http://www.overtonsquare.com/ Overton Square], [http://www.malco.com/cinema_info.php?this_id=32 Studio on the Square] shows both independent films and major studio films.\nFine arts\nMemphis has also had a significant impact in the world of photography. William Eggleston, the pioneer of color photography as a serious artistic medium and considered one of the greatest photographers of all time, still lives and works in Memphis. A number of younger photographers, including Jeanne Umbreit and Huger Foote, are Memphians. Some other notable Memphis photographers were fashion/celebrity photographer Jack Robinson and civil rights–era documenter Ernest C. Withers.\nIn the last two decades, the art scene in Memphis has exploded. Art galleries were first established at Overton Square but have moved farther east. The independent art scene has had some success on South Main, on the trolley line in downtown Memphis.  Several art galleries have moved into the neighborhood, stimulating a real estate boom that expanded into new residential construction.  One interesting conversion was the Power House, a former power plant near Central Station that was transformed into contemporary art space by Delta Axis, a Memphis contemporary arts organization. The Power House closed in August 2009, citing economic concerns.\nThe Cooper-Young neighborhood in Midtown Memphis has also been home to several art galleries.  The Edge is an art studio neighborhood, located at the edge of downtown near Madison Avenue, Marshall, and Union Avenue.  The Edge is home to Memphis' Black Repertory Theater, world-famous Sun Studios, and Delta Axis, among others. The old commercial strip on Broad Avenue in the Binghampton area is home to a cluster of artists and craftsmen.\nQuality commercial art galleries in the east Memphis area include the David Lusk Gallery, Perry Nicole Gallery,  L Ross Gallery and Lisa Kurts Gallery.

The Memphis College of Art and the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art are neighbors inside Overton Park, along with The Shell, a 1930s outdoor performing arts venue recently renovated and reopened in September 2008.\nMore informally, art intersects with entrepreneurship in many traditionally African American neighborhoods through hand-painted signs. Artists like James \"Brick\" Brigance, an Orange Mound native, paints lettering, logos and images on the brick facades of many neighborhood buildings.\nFilm\nMemphis has an active and growing film industry.  Movies filmed at least partially in Memphis include The Firm, The Client, Walk the Line, Hustle & Flow, In the Valley of Elah, and Undefeated.
