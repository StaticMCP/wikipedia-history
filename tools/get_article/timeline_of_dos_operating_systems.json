Non-x86 operating systems named \"DOS\" are not part of the scope of this timeline.\nAlso presented is a timeline of events in the history of the 8-bit 8080-based and 16-bit x86-based CP/M operating systems from 1974 to 2014, as well as the hardware and software developments from 1973 to 1995 which formed the foundation for the initial version and subsequent enhanced versions of these operating systems.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float: right;\" width=\"225\"\n|+ Color key\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft: 86-DOS, MS-DOS\n|-\n|style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|IBM: PC DOS\n|-\n|style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|Digital Research: CP/M, DR-DOS\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffebeb;\"|Compaq MS-DOS\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ddffff;\"|FreeDOS, GNU/DOS\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffefbf;\"|Other\n|}\nDOS releases have been in the forms of:\n* OEM adaptation kits (OAKs) – all Microsoft releases before version 3.2 were OAKs only\n* Shrink wrap packaged product for smaller OEMs (system builders) – starting with MS-DOS 3.2 in 1986,Microsoft offered these in addition to OAKs\n* End-user retail – all versions of IBM PC DOS (and other OEM-adapted versions) were sold to end users.DR-DOS began selling to end users with version 5.0 in July 1990, followed by MS-DOS 5.0 in June 1991\n* Free download – starting with OpenDOS 7.01 in 1997, followed by FreeDOS alpha 0.05 in 1998(FreeDOS project was announced in 1994)\nDOS era version overview (1980–1995)\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+First end-user releases of IBM–Microsoft-compatible versionsMajor market-leading releases and releases introducing significant new technology\n!Date\n!Version\n!Primary developer\n!Notable introduction\n!IBM hardware\n|-\n|August 1980\n|86-DOS 0.10\n|Tim Paterson\n|First Seattle Computer release\n|\n|-\n|August 1981\n|PC DOS 1.0\n|Microsoft\n|First IBM release\n|IBM Personal Computer\n|-\n|May 1982\n|PC DOS 1.1\n|Microsoft\n|Double-sided disks\n|Upgraded IBM Personal Computer\n|-\n|March 1983\n|PC DOS 2.0\n|Microsoft\n|Hard disk drive, subdirectories, device drivers\n|IBM Personal Computer XT\n|-\n|November 1983\n|PC DOS 2.1\n|Microsoft\n|Half-height disk drives, ROM cartridges\n|IBM PCjr\n|-\n|August 1984\n|PC DOS 3.0\n|Microsoft\n|Support for larger disks\n|IBM Personal Computer/AT\n|-\n|April 1985\n|PC DOS 3.1\n|Microsoft\n|Local area networking support\n|IBM PC Network\n|-\n|March 1986\n|PC DOS 3.2\n|Microsoft\n|3-inch 720 KB floppy support\n|Token Ring networkIBM PC Convertible\n|-\n|April 1987\n|PC DOS 3.3\n|IBM\n|3-inch 1.44 MB floppy support, extended partitions\n|IBM Personal System/2\n|-\n|November 1987\n|MS-DOS 3.31\n|Compaq\n|Hard disk partitions over 32 MB\n|rowspan=13 style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|\n|-\n|May 1988\n|DR DOS 3.31\n|Digital Research\n|ROMable DOS\n|-\n|July 1988\n|IBM DOS 4.0\n|IBM\n|DOS Shell, EMS 4.0 usage\n|-\n|April 1990\n|DR DOS 5.0\n|Digital Research\n|Memory management\n|-\n|June 1991\n|MS-DOS 5.0\n|Microsoft\n|MS-DOS Editor, QBasic, first retail upgrade\n|-\n|September 1991\n|DR DOS 6.0\n|Digital Research\n|Disk compression (AddStor's SuperStor)\n|-\n|March 1993\n|MS-DOS 6.0\n|Microsoft\n|Disk utilities, DoubleSpace disk compression\n|-\n|June 1993\n|PC DOS 6.1\n|IBM\n|First IBM release after split with Microsoft, E\n|-\n|September 1993\n|MS-DOS 6.2\n|Microsoft\n| Improved version of DoubleSpace\n|-\n|February 1994\n|MS-DOS 6.21\n|Microsoft\n| DoubleSpace removed due to legal injunction\n|-\n|April 1994\n|PC DOS 6.3\n|IBM\n|SuperStor/DS disk compression\n|-\n|June 1994\n|MS-DOS 6.22\n|Microsoft\n|Last Microsoft release; DriveSpace disk compression\n|-\n|April 1995\n|PC DOS 7.0\n|IBM\n|Memory optimizations, Stacker disk compression, Rexx\n|}\n1973–1980: Hardware foundations and CP/M\n{| class=wikitable\n|colspan=2 align=\"center\" rowspan=8|1973||Some 200 Intel customers have used the MCS-4 and MCS-8 microcomputer chip sets introduced in 1971 and 1972 in more than 60 applications, including: point-of-sale terminals; typewriter-sized general-purpose data processing machines that tabulate accounts, type invoices, and write checks and personalized form letters; process controllers for automatic bottle-loading machines; and a front-end processor in a dial-up communications controller. Microcomputers are increasingly used in systems too small or slow to warrant use of minicomputers. Intel's support for system-building includes SIM4-01 and SIM8-01 prototyping boards that form functioning micro computers, programmable read-only memory (PROM) programmers, and a PROM-based assembler. Intel introduces the 2048-bit (256-byte) erasable 1702A EPROM chip. It can be programmed in two minutes using Intel's punched paper tape-actuated programmer, and erased as often as needed by shining an ultraviolet light through a transparent quartz cap on the package. Intel claims its first two microcomputers command about 99% of the market which Fairchild Semiconductor, National Semiconductor and Rockwell International have joined.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|IBM introduces the IBM 3740 data entry system. It uses IBM's first read/write diskette, a single-sided 8-inch-diameter \"memory disk\"—a new recording medium to replace punched cards.  Each diskette can hold as much data as 3,000 standard 80-column punched cards. See also: History of the floppy disk\n|-\n||The Intel 8008-based Micral N, the first personal computer using a microprocessor, is offered for sale. The 8-bit 8008 has a 14-bit address bus that can address 214 (16,384) memory locations, or 16 KB of memory.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|IBM introduces Winchester hard disk drive technology with the IBM 3340 direct access storage device for use on their System/370 mainframes.  See also: History of hard disk drives\n|-\n|style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|Gary Kildall, a Naval Postgraduate School instructor and consultant to Intel, writes PL/M for the 8008, the first programming language and first compiler specifically for microprocessors. It's a cross compiler written in ANSI standard Fortran IV so it will run on most computers, including a PDP-10. However, the 8008's seven-level subroutine call stack is too small to support a self-hosted compiler. Kildall also wrote an 8008 simulator in Fortran IV.\n|-\n||At the June National Computer Conference in the New York Coliseum, Intel introduces two microcomputers, the Intellec 4 (4004) and 8 (8008). The Intellecs have resident monitors stored in ROMs. The Intellec 8 supported a Teletype operating at 110 baud, a high speed punched tape reader and a CRT terminal at 1200 baud.\n|-\n|In July, Intel debuts its model 2107 4,096-bit (4-kilobit) n-MOS RAM, which competes with 4kb RAMs from TI, Mostek and Microsystems International. It's slow compared with 1kb RAMs such as the p-MOS 1103 and the n-MOS 2105. Nearly all new computers, regardless of size, now come with a semiconductor memory or a choice between semiconductors and cores.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|On a summer job at Vancouver, Washington working for TRW, a contractor for the Bonneville Power Administration, in his spare time Paul Allen adapts the PDP-10 Macro Assembler and DDT debugger to create an 8008 simulator that lets Bill Gates develop code for their 8008-based Traf-O-Data computer built by Paul Gilbert. Allen had previously tried, without success, writing the simulator on the IBM System/360 at Washington State University, where he was studying computer science.\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=\"center\" rowspan=4|1974||Intel releases the 8-bit 8080 (cost $360, compared to the dominant and far more powerful IBM System/360's millions), which has a 16-bit address bus that can address 216 (65,536) memory locations, or 64 KB of memory. The 8080's enhanced stack makes self-hosted high level language development feasible.\n|-\n||Information Terminals Corporation (ITC) introduces the first two-sided, double-capacity floppy disk—the model FF34-2000 flippy disk, compatible with IBM's 8-inch disk.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Lacking an affordable reader for 16-channel paper tapes, the Traf-O-Data partners turn to a local inventor. At a demo for the King County Engineering Department, their contraption malfunctioned, prompting Gates to bite the bullet and spend about $3,400 for the more reliable Enviro-Labs GS-311 tape reader.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|Kildall writes CP/M, a simple \"Control Program/Monitor\" for an Intel 8080-based Intellec 8, to test out his updated PL/M compiler for the 8080. CP/M, written in PL/M, was finished months before the hardware to run it on was completed, by using a PDP-10 to simulate the 8080.  CP/M runs in approximately 3 kilobytes (KB) of memory. Convinced that magnetic-disk storage would make the Intellec 8 more efficient, Kildall interfaced the computer with an 8-inch Shugart Associates floppy disk drive using a custom built floppy disk controller.  Kildall's friend John Torode developed the controller hardware while Kildall worked on the disk operating system software.  Believing, along with Intel's designers, that the microprocessor would run embedded systems such as digital watches, they market their hardware and software together&mdash;not as a microcomputer, but as a development system, used for programming Intel 1602A PROM or erasable 1702A EPROM chips which are plugged into a socket on the Intellec 8's front panel.\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=\"center\" rowspan=5|1975 ||style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|The Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) Altair 8800 is introduced, sparking the microcomputer revolution.  Gates and Allen found Microsoft based on Altair BASIC, which they co-developed with Monte Davidoff and for the first 1 years primarily distributed on paper tape.  MITS later distributes BASIC on cassette tape, supported by the Altair 88-ACR (Audio Cassette Recorder) interface boards. Cassettes were popular for another 1 years, before floppy disks took over. The Altair's S-100 bus eventually becomes the first de facto standard microcomputer expansion bus, as by April 1980 there were probably over 200,000 installed S-100 systems, more than TRS-80, PET and Apple II systems.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|Kildall and Torode sell their first two machines and a word processor for newspaper editing to Omron, a small San Francisco computer terminal subsidiary of a Japanese electronics firm, splitting $25,000.  Omron was the first company to license CP/M, for their intelligent terminal.  CP/M also monitored programs in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Octopus network.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|The IBM 5100 Portable Computer, the first portable computer, is introduced.  Mass storage is provided by quarter-inch cartridge (QIC) magnetic tape drives.\n|-\n|In December, IMS Associates, Inc. ships their first fifty IMSAI 8080 kits. They market their clone of the Altair 8800 as a \"commercial grade\" microcomputer system.\n|-\n|1975 market shares for low-cost data recording devices, according to a Venture Development Corp. study: Cassettes 73%, Floppies 22%, Cartridges 5%.  The cassette was expected to retain its leadership position through 1980.\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=\"center\" rowspan=3|1976||style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|IBM introduces more hardware components for its 3600 finance communication system, including the first double-sided (dual head) floppy drive.  ITC adjusts Flippy (now a registered trademark) production to accommodate the new drive.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|IMSAI ships a lot of disk subsystems, promising that an operating system (OS) would follow; Kildall adapts CP/M to the IMSAI hardware, rewriting the parts that manage devices like diskette controllers and CRTs.  Having adapted CP/M for four different controllers, and somewhat reluctant to adapt it to yet another, Kildall designs a general interface, which he calls the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), that a good programmer could change on the spot for their hardware, e.g. Rob Barnaby for the IMSAI VDP-80 in 1977.  This approach would be reinvented years later as the \"hardware abstraction layer.\"  Kildall founds Digital Research and releases CP/M version 1.3 as a commercial product, at $70 per copy.  His wife sends diskettes to customers responding to an ad they ran in ''Dr. Dobb's Journal, whose editor Jim Warren advocated sale of CP/M to the general public. An ad runs in the December Byte as well.  Demand for the diskettes was slow at first.\n|-\n|Shugart introduces the (single-sided) minifloppy, the first 5-inch floppy drive.\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=\"center\" rowspan=3|1977 ||style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|Torode's Digital Systems runs an ad in Byte for its Altair/IMSAI (S-100) bus floppy disk system.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|IMSAI marketing director Seymour I. Rubinstein paid Kildall $25,000 for the right to run CP/M version 1.3, which eventually evolved into IMDOS, on IMSAI 8080 computers.  Other manufacturers follow and CP/M eventually becomes the de facto'' standard 8-bit operating system.\n|-\n|Tandon Magnetics files a patent for its double-sided ferrite disk read-and-write heads, which improved on IBM's design by employing a fixed transducer on one side and a movable transducer on the other side, and offered its Series 200 heads to OEMs.  Eventually IBM, Shugart and other manufacturers became licensees of Tandon's patent.  Later, Shugart introduces their double-sided, double-headed, double density minifloppy drive.\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=\"center\" rowspan=4|1978 ||Intel releases the 16-bit Intel 8086 microprocessor, which has a 20-bit address bus that can address 220 (1,048,576) memory locations, or one megabyte of segmented memory.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|CP/M version 1.4, now priced at $100, is released.\n|-\n|IEEE proposes an S-100 standard, introducing a 16-bit data bus to the S-100.\n|-\n|Rubinstein founds MicroPro International.

To the programmer, the 8086 and 8088 instruction sets are identical, except for execution speed. The 8088 uses lower cost 8-bit RAM.\n|-\n|rowspan=2|November||style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Seattle Computer Products ships its first 8086 card.

It's crammed into 6 KB of code.  Seattle Computer Products runs an ad in Byte marketing it as 86-DOS for $95.  Seattle Computer contacts Microsoft about adapting Microsoft BASIC for the new operating system, proposing a cross-licensing arrangement.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft announces Xenix, a port of Version 7 Unix to x86 computers, saying that it will prevent a 16-bit software crisis. Xenix will also be available for the PDP-11 as early as October; Motorola 68000 and Zilog Z8000 versions are also coming. Interest in Unix as \"the next CP/M\" resulted in the creation of several Unix-like operating systems, including an Onyx Systems version for the Z8000.\n|-\n|September||style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Allen negotiates an agreement with Seattle Computer for a non-exclusive sublicense for 86-DOS to an unnamed OEM customer for $25,000.

Exhibit \"A\" of the agreement detailed extended 86-DOS features to be developed by Seattle Computer, including \"Directory expanded to include date.\"\n|-\n|style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|Digital Research ships CP/M-86 on January 23. Like CP/M, CP/M-86 consists of three major modules: the BIOS, BDOS (Basic Disk Operating System) supporting 60 system calls and the CCP (Console Command Processor).  New system calls are mainly for the new memory allocation scheme that CP/M-86 uses. Intel's PL/M-86 was used to generate CP/M-86, which is basically the same as the 8-bit version, with the addition of file system enhancements as well as memory management.\n|-\n|February||style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|O'Rear gets 86-DOS to run on IBM's prototype computer.  86-DOS had to be converted from 8-inch to 5-inch floppy disks and integrated with the BIOS, which Microsoft was helping IBM to write.

Digital Research hired consultant Andy Johnson-Laird to customize CP/M-86 for IBM's computer, and Johnson-Laird quickly discovered O'Rear's name in the boot sector of IBM's floppy. Johnson-Laird said that Kildall \"went ashen\" when he saw that.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|On July 27, Microsoft buys all rights to 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, initially for a further $50,000 and favorable licenses back from Microsoft.

The 160 KB DOS diskette also included 23 sample BASIC programs demonstrating the abilities of the PC, including the game DONKEY.BAS.  The two system files, IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM, are hidden.  The first sector of DOS-formatted diskettes is the boot record.  Two copies of the File Allocation Table occupy the two sectors which follow the boot record.  Sectors four through seven hold the root directory.  The remaining 313 sectors (160,256 bytes) store the data contents of files.  Disk space is allocated in clusters, which are one-sector in length. Because an 8-bit FAT can't support over 300 clusters, Paterson implemented a new 12-bit FAT, which would be called FAT12. 510 + 2 reserved bytes  512}} DOS 1.0 diskettes have up to 64 32-byte directory entries, holding the 8-byte filename, 3-byte filename extension, 1-byte file attribute (with a hidden bit, system bit and six undefined bits), 12 bytes reserved for future use, 2-byte last modified date, 2-byte starting cluster number and 4-byte file size.  The two standard formats for program files are COM and EXE; a Program Segment Prefix is built when they are loaded into memory.  The third kind of command processing file is the batch file.  AUTOEXEC.BAT is checked for, and executed by COMMAND.COM at start-up.  Special batch file commands are PAUSE and REM. I/O is made device independent by treating peripherals as if they were files.  Whenever the reserved filenames CON: (console), PRN: (printer), or AUX: (auxiliary serial port) appear in the File Control Block of a file named in a command, all operations are directed to the device.  The video controller, floppy disk controller, further memory, serial and parallel ports are added via up to five 8-bit PC bus expansion cards.  Delivery of the computer is scheduled for October.\n|-\n|rowspan=6|1981||rowspan=\"2\"|October||An InfoWorld article asks, \"Which Operating System Will Prevail?\".

Kildall told InfoWorld that it took Digital Research three months to develop CP/M-86, while MP/M-86 (suggested retail $500) took four-man-years (two actual years).  Solving the problem of concurrency, among other things, accounted for the extra MP/M-86 development time.  In concurrent systems, several functions, organized by the operating system, run simultaneously, using different files.  These functions operate in the background, or multiground if there is more than one function operating.  While this is happening, the user works on another task using the terminal screen, i.e., the foreground.

For about six months PC DOS was the only operating system available for the PC.  Recently, IBM also released the UCSD p-System.  Existing CP/M-86 programs running on other computers must be converted to run on the IBM PC.  Partly because CP/M-86 was priced six times higher than PC DOS (price: $40), it fails to challenge PC DOS as the 16-bit industry standard. 96 percent of the early PC owners chose DOS over CP/M or the p-System.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|Digital Research announces Concurrent CP/M-86, aka Concurrent CP/M, a new CP/M-86-compatible single-user multitasking operating system.

The double-sided directory increased from four to seven sectors, allowing up to 112 directory entries, leaving 630 sectors, i.e. 315 clusters (322,560 bytes) for data (cluster size doubled to two sectors).  The 2-byte last modified time was inserted at the end of the directory's reserved field, reducing the reserved field to 10 bytes.  Timestamping on files is useful for incremental backup with the Corvus hard disk.  Based on MS-DOS 1.24 as of March 1982, PC&nbsp;DOS 1.1 still ships on a 160 KB diskette. The DEL command is added as a synonymous name for the ERASE command and REN is an abbreviated name for RENAME.  DATE and TIME become internal commands. The EXE2BIN command is added and MODE is enhanced to configure serial ports and redirect printing to a serial port.  A \"P\" MODE option causes continuous retries when a device is not ready, by making a portion of MODE permanently resident in memory.

Compaq achieved compatibility legally by reverse engineering through clean-room design.  The Compaq Portable has a CGA-compatible display adapter which shows its text mode characters with MDA-resolution, effectively combining the virtues of the CGA and the MDA. Its operating system was called COMPAQ-DOS, adding to the confusing host of names for MS-DOS.  Microsoft finally insisted that their operating system be called MS-DOS, and eventually everyone but IBM complied. A June 1983 PC Magazine product review said \"the Compaq comes with Microsoft's MS-DOS 1.1 operating system, which is almost identical to PC-DOS 1.1\".

DOS 2 is about 12 KB larger than DOS 1.1 – despite its complex new features, it's only 24 KB of code.  Under pressure from IBM to leave sufficient memory available for applications on smaller PC systems, the developers had reduced the system size from triple that of DOS 1.1. Peter Norton found many problems with the release. Interrupts 25h and 26h, which read or write complete sectors, redefined their rules for absolute sector addressing, \"sabotaging\" programs using these services. The XT motherboard uses 64-kilobit DIP chips, supporting up to 256 KB on board. With 384 KB on expansion cards, users could officially reach the 640 KB barrier of conventional memory.

Concurrent PC&nbsp;DOS, due out by the end of 1984, will be offered for the AT&T 6300. However, the PC mode is not perfectly compatible. It may have trouble with programs that bypass the operating system to address specific memory locations, and is only DOS 1.1 compatible,  so it can't read beyond 2.0's root directories.

It ships with PC DOS 3.0, which adds support for quadruple, or high density (80-track), 15 sectors per track 1.2 MB (1,228,800 bytes; 2,400 sectors) floppy disks. Their FAT fills seven sectors (14 for two copies) and root directory 14 (holding up to 224 entries), leaving 2,371 1-sector clusters (1,213,952 bytes) for data. The hard disk has 614 cylinders, four sides, and 17 sectors/track, a total of 41,752 sectors or 21,377,024 bytes raw space.  The 12-bit FAT design allows for a maximum of 4,078 clusters.  DOS cluster sizes are powers of two, so to avoid using 16-sector clusters and support larger hard disks more efficiently, DOS added a new partition type (0x04) for partitions larger than 15 MB, using a 16-bit FAT, which allows a smaller 4-sector cluster size. As a result, DOS 2.x hard disks larger than 15 MB, which used a 12-bit FAT (type 0x01) are incompatible with later versions of DOS.  The 286 has a 24-bit address bus that can address 16 MB of RAM, and IBM officially supported expansion to 3 MB.  PC DOS 3.0 supported use of extended memory with the VDISK.SYS installable device driver, which allowed configuration of one or more virtual disks (RAM disks). The /E switch caused virtual disks to use extended memory rather than conventional memory.  VDISK used a BIOS memory transfer service, termed the Interrupt 15h interface, to avoid switching directly into protected virtual address mode.  However, the ROM-BIOS routine did switch from real mode to protected mode and back again, a relatively slow process which was not reliable for some applications. PC DOS 3.0 also provided the same international support included earlier in version 2.11. IBM also announced a PC/AT version of the Xenix multiuser operating system, the IBM PC Network (developed for IBM by Sytek and supported by PC DOS 3.1), and a new multitasking windowing software utility called TopView&mdash;all will be available in first quarter 1985. The redesigned keyboard added an 84th key. IBM's software engineers were tasked with making it switch the AT from DOS into a \"virtual machine\" or \"hypervisor\" mode that would enable multitasking programs written for different operating systems. The motherboard grew in size to fit in the added circuits such as the clock and the second Intel 8259 & 8237 controllers.\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1984||September||style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|IBM introduces the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), which costs $524 and has 16 KB ROM and 64 KB RAM.

A further 128 KB ($259) added to the piggyback board produces a fully loaded 256 KB EGA card (total cost: $982). For use with monochrome monitors, the EGA supports MDA-text mode and adds a 640×350 monochrome graphics mode, a slightly lower resolution than the Hercules' 720×348. The EGA has the advantage of being \"IBM standard\" with built-in BIOS support, while Hercules has the initial advantage of being more widely used and software-supported. For color monitors, all seven CGA modes are supported. 80-column text mode resolution improved from the CGA's 640×200 to 640×350&mdash;shy of the 720×350 resolution achieved by Compaq. Three new graphics modes were added, including 16 colors simultaneously from a palette of 64 colors at 640×350 resolution (see EGA palettes).  The IBM 5154 enhanced color monitor ($849, planned availability January 1985) is needed to display the increased resolution.  IBM also announces the 640×480, 256-color Professional Graphics Controller (PGC) for computer-aided design (CAD) workstations. The PGC has IBM's first graphics coprocessor and is its first video controller to produce an analog signal.\n|-\n|November||style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|In Europe, AT&T and Microsoft release MS-DOS 3.1, which added a new local area network supplement Microsoft Networks 1.0 (identified earlier as MS-Net) for use on non-IBM network cards.

Above Board uses bank switching so the IBM PC and PC/AT can use what Intel and Lotus call the expanded memory device interface specification 3.0 (EMS, not to be confused with IBM's extended memory).  The specification allows use of up to 8 MB of RAM.  Above Board packs up to 2 MB, and two Above Boards can coexist in the same system.  A source estimated that 4 MB of RAM would yield about 500,000 cells in a spreadsheet.  EMS is implemented with the expanded memory manager (EMM), a device driver supplied by the board manufacturer as a CONFIG.SYS DEVICE directive.  The specification was publicly released to product developers, and similar memory boards were soon released by others including Tecmar and Quadram. Many of the first programs supporting EMS assumed that all available EMS memory was for them, resulting in \"EMS wars\" as disk caching software, resident programs and applications stomped over each other's use of expanded memory. Only by embracing the spec could peace reign and multiple programs safely share and simultaneously use expanded memory.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffebeb;\"|At Compaq's annual shareholders' meeting, after the Pointer Sisters sing their hit song \"I'm So Excited\" on the mock-keyboard stage floor, CEO Rod Canion introduces the Deskpro 286 and Portable 286.

The program is stored on the network file server.\n|-\n|Market reaction to IBM's Enhanced Graphics Adapter has not been overwhelming, partly because the EGA's complexity&mdash;five custom chips and 12 modes&mdash;has slowed software development and the board's price tag has been a damper for many, but the EGA is emerging as the next graphics standard. Lotus expects to release drivers supporting 1-2-3 and Symphony by the end of the month, and Microsoft Chart will join Word and Windows in supporting the EGA. Several clone boards are expected to hit the market over the next six months.  Chips and Technologies (C&T) is creating a full, custom EGA chip set. IBM tried to insulate developers from the board and sidestep the driver problem by incorporating the Virtual Device Interface (VDI) from Graphic Software Systems (GSS) of Wilsonville, Oregon (founded in 1981 by four former Tektronix engineers) into the EGA, but many developers are choosing to ignore the IBM VDI.  Digital Research has its own Virtual Device Interface, which they describe as similar to a superset of IBM's VDI, which they say has limited raster graphics support. A number of vendors are writing directly to the screen rather than the VDI to get better performance, including Lotus and Ashton-Tate.  Microsoft's upcoming Windows uses Microsoft's Graphics Device Interface, a superset of Graphic Software Systems' VDI. Ashton-Tate's development director said that because the EGA slows down the 8088, creating performance problems, the EGA's technical benefits almost require the 80286. A Microsoft software engineer said the basic 64 KB EGA forces a trade-off between resolution and color&mdash;a user can have either 4-color 640×350 or 16-color 640×200 resolution, recommending the 64 KB piggyback board for good performance of 16 colors at 640×350 resolution. Historically, graphics has been viewed as a vertical market&mdash;charting or computer-aided design.

A company was selling a disk system for the PC/AT that could hold 240 megabytes in one file, and many 40- and 80-megabyte disks were in use.  However, there was a problem.  DOS limited partitions to only 32 MB&mdash;the BPB's Total Sectors on the Volume field limit was 65,536 (216), and 16-bit addresses passed to interrupts 25h and 26h.  Many were surprised that IBM did not demolish the 32 MB barrier with PC&nbsp;DOS 3.0 or 3.1.  The most common way to resolve this problem was to treat large drives as if they were actually two or more drives.  The drives are then termed logical or volume drives, and work well as long as no one file is larger than 32 MB.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|Digital Research, in an effort to promote its stalled Concurrent PC&nbsp;DOS operating system, modified the system to exploit the RAMpage expanded memory specification.

The Deskpro 386 system memory board was expandable to 10 MB, but no operating system was yet available to exploit more than the 1 MB address space of the original IBM PC (except by creating RAM disks and disk caches; Compaq utilities VDISK.SYS and CACHE.EXE did this).  Compaq called their solution to the 32 MB partition limit enhanced disk, which was implemented with a custom Compaq version of FDISK that allowed creation of multiple MS-DOS partitions on a single hard drive, and the ENHDISK.SYS device driver installed into CONFIG.SYS to access those extra partitions.

It runs on an ISDN workstation.\n|-\n|STB Systems releases the first BIOS-level compatible VGA board, soon followed by Sigma Designs. Register-level compatible boards soon followed. Unlike MCA, VGA was quickly accepted in the video board industry as the new standard. While IBM's PS/2 VGA adapter only has an analog port, third-party VGA-compatible cards have both an analog 15-pin port and a digital nine-pin port for compatibility with prior hardware.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft announces and ships the first PC version of its Excel spreadsheet. Excel for Microsoft Windows requires Windows and includes Windows 2.01 in run-time. Excel runs on 286- and 386-based systems with an accelerator board.

Compaq dropped support for creating enhanced disks from their version of FDISK, while maintaining support for ENHDISK partitions created by prior versions.\n|-\n|Intelligent Graphics Corporation (IGC) announces its VM/386 control program, which provides access to multitasking and virtual memory. The program, inspired by IBM's VM/370 operating system, creates full-screen \"virtual machines\". Control-Alt-Delete reboots the current virtual machine within VM/386 without resetting the host system. The  key brings up the VM manager. IGC's DOS extender, X-AM, will be supported in a future version of VM/386.\n|-\n|Quarterdeck announces a new version of DESQview which runs applications that use 386DOS-Extender, such as Paradox 386–that's set to ship next month.

DR DOS is ROMable, unlike MS-DOS.\n|-\n|June||style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft releases Windows/286, version 2.1, which replaces Windows 2.03. It provides an extra 50 KB above the 640 KB DOS limit, when running on a system with more than 1 MB of extended memory available. A future version, as well as the next EMS, will add 64 KB rather than 50 KB to main memory. Windows/286 still runs on 8086/8088-based systems, but without this new memory. Windows/386, version 2.1 was also released.\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1988||rowspan=2|July||style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|IBM ships IBM DOS 4.0. It adds an optional text-based file manager shell (DOSSHELL) with pull-down menus called by typing the  key, optional mouse support and a text-based user interface—an alternative to the command-line interface—which is a subset of the upcoming OS/2 version 1.1's Presentation Manager.  The DOS Shell could run in either text mode or graphics mode (on supported hardware), depending on how it was configured in the file DOSSHELL.BAT.  Text mode is required to avoid incompatibilities (video conflicts) while running many popular TSR programs in graphics mode.  IBM DOS 4.0 supports Lotus-Intel-Microsoft EMS 4.0 on IBM's Expanded Memory Adapter, and is the first MS-DOS/PC DOS version that is \"EMS-aware\" and can use the EMS memory when it is available. DOS 4 supports hard disk partitions over 32 MB, up to 1024 MB.  It also offers a hard drive installation program as an alternative to the procedure used in prior versions (FDISK, FORMAT, SYS, COPY), enhanced video-graphics support and improved error handling.  The release was simultaneously announced by Microsoft, but no other OEMs had yet released it for their machines. Because Microsoft already sells in Europe a multitasking version of DOS, which is called DOS 4.0, it is not clear if Microsoft will use a different version number for the new operating system. IBM also ships OS/2 Extended Edition 1.0, which adds the IBM-developed components Communications Manager and Database Manager.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Concurrently with the July 19 DOS 4.0 announcement, Microsoft released an extended memory specification, XMS, Version 2.0, implemented by the device driver HIMEM.SYS in Windows/286.  When run on 286- and 386-based systems, XMS brings DOS memory management to three new regions of memory:\n* Upper memory blocks (UMBs) above the video RAM and below the BIOS ROM: otherwise unused regions that can be used by EMS hardware and software, and by 80386 memory managers such as QEMM and 386-to-the-Max\n* High memory area (HMA): boosts access to conventional memory by using the A20 handler that adds 64 KB normally considered part of the extended-memory address range, used by multitasking software such as DESQview and Windows/286\n* Extended memory, born in August 1984 with the IBM AT and DOS 3.0, but suffering from lack of management as RAM disks and disk caches battled over the region, now has a sturdy mechanism for governance\nThe other EMS 4.0 partners are evaluating the XMS spec, but stopped short of endorsing it.\n|-\n|August||The Phar Lap Virtual Memory Manager, scheduled for release in October, is unveiled at the Desqview Developers' Conference. The combination of Desqview, QEMM, and applications written to use Phar Lap's new product will run applications concurrently without memory restraints, something that OS/2 also promises. 386DOS-Extender uses installed RAM, but with memory chips costing 100 times more per megabyte than hard disk memory, swapping to disk is more economical. DESQview 2.2, with significantly reduced RAM requirements, and QEMM 4.2 were also announced.\n|-\n|rowspan=7|1988||rowspan=3|September||style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|IBM ships unannounced IBM DOS 4.01.  Plagued with reports of bugs and incompatibilities, DOS 4.0 has been widely reported as being virtually unusable in its present state.  IBM said that this was not a new version but a \"maintenance diskette\" to fix minor problems.  However, early users said that the more serious incompatibilities resulting from a change in file structure have not been fixed by the upgrade. IBM also released two enhanced PS/2 Model 30s that use the classic AT bus rather than the MCA bus, based on the 286 instead of 8086 processor, with VGA instead of MCGA graphics and 1.44 MB disk drives replacing 720 KB drives.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffebeb;\"|The Gang of Nine PC clone makers, led by Compaq, announced the Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus.  New EISA computers are expected by late 1989.\n|-\n|Lotus, Intel and AST Research officially endorse XMS 2.0; Qualitas and Phar Lap say their products will support the spec as well. Although extended memory is faster than expanded memory, delays in acceptance of XMS, which brought the same sort of order to extended memory as the widely accepted EMS brought to expanded memory, meant that some developers still recommended that RAM beyond 1 MB on 286 and 386 machines be configured as expanded memory. By the end of 1989, XMS was still not in widespread use yet.\n|-\n|rowspan=2|October||style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft urged its OEMs to wait for a bug-fixing update of DOS 4.0 code before shipping their own versions.  Microsoft released a DOS 4.0 Binary Adaption Kit - containing the operating system and utilities to help OEMs adapt it to their hardware - shortly after the mid-July announcement of DOS 4.0.  Microsoft told manufacturers who distribute DOS under their own labels not to use that BAK and instead wait for the maintenance update, which contains several bug fixes, primarily for a problem with page frames involving EMS.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|IBM and Microsoft ship OS/2 1.1, which has the Presentation Manager graphical interface. IBM admitted that OS/2 hasn't \"taken off\" as planned; fewer applications than expected are available, and most OS/2-compatible applications are DOS applications running in OS/2's \"compatibility box\".\n|-\n|rowspan=2|November||NEC Home Electronics, maker of the MultiSync monitor line, forms the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) to promote a standard it calls Super VGA, which it says provides 56 percent more pixels on-screen than standard VGA.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft releases MS-DOS 4.01, including the user shell and EMS support.

The choice is not a simple one.  Each has its own set of assets and liabilities.  But with OS/2 currently stalled in the market, there seems to be a future for alternatives.  Microsoft has chosen bank switching for Excel and Windows, while Lotus has seriously looked at DOS extenders for its unreleased 1-2-3, Release 3.0.\n|-\n|rowspan=3|April||style=\"background: #ffebeb;\"|Compaq announced the availability of Compaq's MS-DOS version 4.01.  Compaq continues to market their MS-DOS 3.31 as well.

Within months this expanded to support 1,024×768 pixels with 256 colors, which was called 1K VGA or 1024 display to distinguish this Super VGA from the 800×600 mode. VESA members formed an 8514/A subcommittee to make recommendations on an extended high-resolution, high-performance 8514/A standard. Several manufacturers have introduced 1,024×768 boards offering both interlaced and non-interlaced video, based on the Texas Instruments TMS34010 graphics controller chip. The TMS34010 is 20 percent faster (writing pixels per second) than the 8514/A, and TI's new TMS34020 is about 500 percent faster. Monitors supporting non-interlaced signals cost more.\n|-\n|May||Lotus Development recently became the seventh software company to join the coalition promoting the Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) specification published by Phar Lap and Quarterdeck. Other members are AI Architects, Quadram, Qualitas and Rational Systems. VCPI resolved conflicts with memory managers by defining a communication protocol for the DOS extender to borrow RAM from the memory manager and use memory manager services to switch processor modes.\n|-\n|June||Lotus ships Release 3.0 of its market leading spreadsheet 1-2-3, more than two years after the product was announced.  The company spent $15 million bug testing 3.0, which was translated into C and uses extended memory by way of Rational Systems' VCPI-compatible DOS/16M 16-bit 80286 extender.\n|-\n|rowspan=8|1989||July||InfoWorld reported that a year after its introduction, DOS 4.01's acceptance by users is slower than expected and lags behind the endorsements that greeted its predecessors.  Users said they don't need its large disk partitions, can't afford to update their existing machines, and are wary of problems with how DOS 4.0 handles expanded memory.  Also, no software developers have yet released applications that require the new version of DOS, which could force users to make the jump.  Hardware vendors are taking longer than usual to adopt the new DOS for their hardware.  Since other DOS updates have traditionally entered the workplace primarily accompanying the purchase of new PCs, this too hampered its adoption.\n|-\n|rowspan=2|September||InfoWorld reports that shadow RAM, a technique used by Chips and Technologies' NEAT chipset and AT/386 chipsets to speed performance by loading ROM-BIOS functions into the upper memory area, has become a significant problem for users who want to run programs that use DOS extenders on 1-megabyte systems.  The problem arises when products like Lotus 1-2-3, Release 3.0 try to use the memory that is tied up supporting shadow RAM.  Invisible Software Inc. announced a $40 program called Invisible RAM which extends DOS memory from 640K to as high as 736 K, allowing Release 3.0 users to load the program and have as much as 90 KB remaining for worksheet space.  Or users could spend several hundred dollars for more memory, with prices continuing their slow decline.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft unveils 16-bit OS/2 1.2, featuring the Installable File System API and High Performance File System (HPFS).\n|-\n|rowspan=2|October||VESA releases their Super VGA BIOS Extension standard VS891001, a specification to standardize a common software interface to Super VGA video adapters in order to provide simplified software application access to advanced VGA products.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffebeb;\"|Compaq introduces the LTE, the first commercially successful IBM PC–compatible notebook computer.\n|-\n|rowspan=2|November||style=\"background: #ffebeb;\"|Compaq introduces their first EISA-based computers, the Deskpro 486 and the SystemPro, attempting to sway corporate accounts from minicomputers.

The improved interface resembles OS/2 Presentation Manager and fully supports EGA and VGA graphics adapters.  Windows 3.0 runs on DOS 3.1 or higher, in one of three modes:\n* Real mode runs Windows 2.x applications, much like previous Windows versions, with 640 KB of memory\n* Standard mode requires a 286 and 1 MB of memory; exploits extended memory and 16-bit 286 protected mode\n* 386 Enhanced mode requires a 386 and 2 MB of memory; its improved memory management mitigates the need for third-party 386 memory managers\nExcluding maintenance releases, this is the last version of Windows that could run on 8088 and 8086-based XT-class PCs (in real mode).\n|-\n|July||style=\"background: #eaeaff;\"|Digital Research ships DR DOS 5.0 to retailers.

There are no new features and this version has the same system requirements as Windows 3.0.\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1991||February||style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|IBM promised VESA members that it would soon introduce an ISA version of the XGA and an OEM version of the XGA chipset, but declined to give a time frame. The move put its orphaned 8514/A standard in a precarious state. Just weeks later, IBM reneged on selling the chips and said it would license XGA technology instead. VESA developers were concerned about the lack of technical information from IBM, and some said the market had moved beyond IBM's ability to set a de facto standard. InfoWorld tests would find that XGA was 6% faster than Super VGA in Excel and just 1% faster in PowerPoint.\n|-\n|rowspan=3|March||AddStor Inc. announces the first version of SuperStor on-the-fly disk compression software.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft said that it had received a letter in June from the Federal Trade Commission advising it of an investigation of its competitive practices, limited to the November 1989 joint announcement with IBM regarding OS/2.  Some industry executives think the investigation will lead the FTC to a range of what they consider to be anti-competitive practices by Microsoft.  Digital Research said that after it introduced its DR DOS version 5.0 in April 1990, Microsoft immediately announced a version of MS-DOS, with \"amazing similarity,\" which has yet to appear.\n|-\n|Phar Lap introduces 386DOS-Extender software development kit (SDK) version 3.0, which supports XMS and both the Real and Standard modes of Windows 3.0. Applications built with version 3.0 will be compatible with the upcoming MS-DOS 5.0; compatibility with Windows 386 Enhanced mode will be added in a later release.\n|-\n|May||Phar Lap introduces the 286DOS-Extender SDK, the first 16-bit DOS extender that works with Microsoft's entire C language toolkit—both the DOS (real mode) and OS/2 (protected mode) versions of the compiler, linker, libraries and debugger. 286DOS-Extender can load an OS/2 application and then trap all of its OS/2 API calls and handle them within the DOS extender or convert them to equivalent MS-DOS function calls. In other words, Phar Lap created an OS/2 compatibility box for DOS. A 16-bit protected-mode DOS application can be built by compiling it with Microsoft C under DOS, specifying that an OS/2 program should be built, and then executing the resulting file on DOS with the aid of 286DOS-Extender. With Lotus and Microsoft using DOS extenders, an increasing number of developers want the technology. Some experts say that DOS is still a better platform than Windows for multimedia applications,  because of its hardware control, though its future may be doomed. 286DOS-Extender is compatible with XMS, VCPI and DPMI in Windows 3.0.\n|-\n|rowspan=8|1991||rowspan=2|June||style=\"background: #dcffdc;\"|On June 11, IBM DOS 5.0 is released.

E replaces the MS-DOS Editor. According to IBM, the PC DOS kernel is based on the MS-DOS 6 kernel. However, in July IBM officials said the compression utility (a version of AddStor's SuperStor) is incompatible with OS/2 2.1, so users must decompress drives to move data back and forth. IBM and AddStor were working on a fix. After three months on the market, Computerworld said that the PC-DOS 6.1 user base was \"minuscule\" compared with MS-DOS', and the product faced \"a hard uphill run\" to escape niche status.\n|-\n|rowspan=2|August||style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|A month after the Federal Trade Commission deadlocks for the second time with a 2–2 vote on whether to take action against Microsoft, the Justice Department officially notified Microsoft that it was proceeding with the case, ending the FTC's three-year investigation.\n|-\n|style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft releases Windows 3.11, a minor update to Windows 3.1 that includes updated drivers, better Novell Netware support, and a few bugfixes to Windows core files.

Later, to ensure that the OS would remain free, the GNU General Public License is used to license code and the name is changed to FreeDOS.\n|-\n|July||style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft settles with the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division, signing a consent decree agreeing to end certain practices for 6 years:\n* Per-processor licenses forcing PC makers to pay royalties for Microsoft software with every machine shipped, even those shipped without any Microsoft software\n* Unreasonably long contracts—typically three to five years; licenses are limited to one or two years\n* Overly restrictive non-disclosure agreements; such agreements are limited to one year and can't prevent programmers from working on rival operating systems\n* Requiring PC makers to purchase another Microsoft product as a condition for licensing a Microsoft operating system\n|-\n|November||style=\"background: #ffcccc;\"|Microsoft introduces Microsoft Windows Simplified Chinese 3.2, a.k.a. \"Windows 3.2\". This version was an update to the Simplified Chinese version of Windows 3.1, adding a few more IMEs (Input Method Editors) and a Chinese font editor.
