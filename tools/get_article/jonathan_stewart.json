He played college football for the Oregon Ducks, earning  All-American honors. Stewart was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the first round of the 2008 NFL draft with the 13th overall pick. He played 10 seasons with Carolina, making the 2016 Pro Bowl, before spending one season with the New York Giants. Following the 2018 season, Stewart signed a one-day contract with Carolina and retired as a Panther.\nEarly life\nStewart is the career leading rusher in Washington prep football history. At Timberline High School in Lacey, Washington, from 2001 to 2004, he rushed for 7,755 yards and scored 105 touchdowns. In 2001, as a freshman, he rushed for 1,279 yards on 95 carries (13.5 avg.) and scored 15 touchdowns. In 2002, as a sophomore, despite an ankle injury causing him to miss almost half of the season, he rushed for 1,609 yards on 153 carries (10.5 avg.) and scored 14 touchdowns. As a junior, in 2003, he rushed for 2,566 yards on 285 carries (9.0 avg.) and scored 45 touchdowns. As a senior, in 2004, he rushed for 2,301 yards, averaging 11.2 yards per carry and scored 32 touchdowns. Against Centralia High School in 2002, Stewart rushed for 422 yards and scored nine touchdowns.\nAfter his senior season in 2004, among several other honors, Stewart was named to the Parade High School All-American team, the USA Today All-USA team, and was the Washington Gatorade Player of the Year.\nTrack and field\nIn addition to football, Stewart was on the school's track & field team, where he competed mainly as a sprinter. He placed third in the 100 meters at the prelims of the 2003 3A District IV Championships, with a season-best time of 10.90 seconds. He ran a career-best time of 10.78 seconds in the 100 meters in 2005, that still stands as the school's fastest time ever.\nAs a University of Oregon collegiate, Stewart competed in the 60-meter dash, recording a personal-best time of 6.88 seconds at the 2007 MPSF Championships, where he placed fifth.\nRecruiting\nIn a national recruiting battle, Stewart chose the University of Oregon over USC, Notre Dame, Nebraska, California, Ohio State, and other schools.\nCollege career\n2005 season\nStewart's true freshman season was highlighted by a pair of kickoff return touchdowns against Montana and Oregon State, which made him the program's first player to ever return more than one kickoff for a score. Stewart ended up leading the nation in kickoff return average (33.7 yards-per-return).\nStewart finished his freshman campaign with nine total touchdowns (six rushing, one receiving, and two kickoff returns) despite touching the football only 72 times. His 54 points made him the team's third leading scorer. An ankle injury would force him to miss action in two games and render him less than 100% in others. At one point early in the season, Stewart had accounted for five touchdowns in his first 20 touches of the football.\n2006 season\nStewart finished his sophomore season as the team's leading rusher. He finished 19 yards shy of 1,000 yards rushing despite missing some time due to lingering ankle injuries. He recorded five 100 yard games in the season and the Ducks were 5–0 in those games. Stewart also caught 20 passes for 144 yards including a touchdown and he again finished near the top nationally in kickoff returning (sixth in the country). In Oregon's controversial win against the Oklahoma, Stewart impressed, rushing for 144 yards and a touchdown. In the final regular season game against rival Oregon State, Stewart rushed for 94 yards and three touchdowns. He finished his sophomore season with 10 rushing touchdowns and one receiving score.\n2007 season\nStewart and the Ducks opened the 2007 campaign 4–0, with wins over Houston, Michigan (in Ann Arbor), Fresno State, and Stanford. Against Michigan, Stewart ran for 111 yards and a touchdown on just 15 carries. He followed up that performance with 165 yards rushing and two touchdowns on just 17 carries against Fresno State. Stewart's second touchdown, an 88-yard rush, was the longest run ever in the 41-year history of Autzen Stadium. The following week against Stanford, Stewart picked up a career best 310 all-purpose yards, including 160 yards rushing and a ten-yard touchdown run. In Oregon's showdown against Cal, Stewart ran for 120 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries, in a 31–24 loss to the Golden Bears. Stewart chipped in 66 rushing yards in Oregon's 53–7 win over Washington State, then had a record setting day against rival Washington. Stewart had a career-high 32 carries for 251 yards and two touchdowns, the latter being the second highest single game total in Oregon's history. Stewart continued his impressive play with a 103-yard, 25 carry, two touchdown performance against USC in Oregon's 24–17 home win. Against then #4 ranked Arizona State, Stewart ran for 99 yards on 21 carries (including a 33-yard touchdown scamper), caught two passes for 26 yards and another score, and returned five kicks for 122 yards. Stewart concluded his record setting season with a career-high 39 carries against rival Oregon State, accumulating 163 yards along the way. In Oregon's 56–21 bowl win over South Florida, Stewart ran for a career-high 253 yards, setting a Sun Bowl record for rushing yards and earning him the C.M. Hendricks Most Valuable Player award. Overall, on the 2007 season, he finished with 1,722 rushing yards, 11 rushing touchdowns, 22 receptions, 145 receiving yards, and two receiving touchdowns.\nAt the end of the 2007 regular season, Stewart was selected to the All-Pacific-10 Conference first-team by league coaches. He also garnered All-America notice.\nCollegiate awards and honors\n* First-team All-Pac-10 (2007)\n* Second-team All-Pac-10 (2006)\n* Pac-10 All-Freshman Team (2005)\n* Sun Bowl Champions (2007)\n* Sun Bowl MVP (2007)\n* Doak Walker Award Semifinalist (2007)\n* 2005 NCAA leader in kick return touchdowns (2 TDs)\n* 2006 NCAA leader in kick return yards (646 yds)\n* 2007 Pac-10 leader in rushing yards (1,722 yds)\nCollege statistics\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"16\" style=\"\"| Oregon Ducks\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! rowspan=\"2\"| GP\n! colspan=\"6\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"4\"| Receiving\n! colspan=\"4\"| Kick Returns\n|-\n!

I'm limited to that factor, but there's a lot to be talked about. If anybody wants to use my beats, I want to maintain my integrity that I have as a person.\"\nJonathan Stewart also spoke with Dubcnn about his music career, stating \"Music isn't a business for me. I'm not trying to supplement my lifestyle with music. I love music and I play music everyday, whether it's my piano, or making a song. It's the same with football, I get paid well to play football, because I'm blessed to have a lot of skill, but I could never be this good without loving the game... I love to play football as much as I did when I was a kid and played for nothing but love. Music is the same way. God blessed me with gifts for both and I love both, but I don't do music to make money at all. I love music, so why not let people make love to it.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3378&SPID=233&DB_OEM_ID=500&ATCLID=177405&Q_SEASON=2007 Oregon Ducks bio]"
