During this process in 1811 the monument was destroyed, albeit with the original plaques preserved. A 1:1 scale replica of the monument was created in 1898 and placed in its present location behind the Massachusetts State House, where the summit of Beacon Hill used to be.\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMBNPH_Ashburton_Park_American_Revolutionary_War_Memorial_Boston_MA Ashburton Park American Revolutionary War Memorial - Boston, MA] at Waymarking"
