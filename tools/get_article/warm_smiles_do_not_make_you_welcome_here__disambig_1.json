The song's title is a re-used title from an old song played by the band in their early days.\nMusic video\nThe music video alternates between the band performing in a warehouse and company executives mass-producing clones of the band. The band then perform energetically opposite a lifeless version of themselves, before detonating an explosive and destroying the chimneys, polluting the air in the distance, seen in the sunglasses of the company executive. The video was released on the band's official YouTube page on 2 July 2012. The video was directed by Raul Gonzo and produced by Robby Starbuck. Extra video work was done by KODE Media.\nTrack listing\nBand members\n*Roughton \"Rou\" Reynolds &ndash; lead vocals, synthesizer, keyboards, programming\n*Chris Batten &ndash; bass guitar, backing vocals\n*Liam \"Rory\" Clewlow &ndash; guitar, backing vocals\n*Rob Rolfe &ndash; drums, percussion, backing vocals\nReferences"
