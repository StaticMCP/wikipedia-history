Hosting the ceremony that year was 10-year-old Drew Barrymore.\nEstablished in 1978 by long-standing Hollywood Foreign Press Association member, Maureen Dragone, the Youth in Film Association was the first organization to establish an awards ceremony specifically set to recognize and award the contributions of performers under the age of 18 in the fields of film, television, theater and music.\nCategories\n★ Bold indicates the winner in each category.\n★ Conflicting reports indicates a conflict in information between the Young Artist Awards official website's list of winners for that year and the Daily News of Los Angeles' list of winners published the day after the ceremony.  The Young Artist Award's official website states that - \"The Internet Movie Database has been used to ensure correct information is maintained on this web site\".  However, IMDb was launched in 1990 (five years after the 7th Youth in Film Awards ceremony was held) and is largely a user-generated website.\nBest Young Performer in a Motion Picture\nBest Starring Performance By a Young Actor - Motion Picture\n★ 'Corey Haim - Silver Bullet (Paramount Pictures)'\n*Sean Astin - The Goonies (Warner Bros)\n*Lukas Haas - Witness (Paramount)\n*Ethan Hawke - Explorers (Paramount)\n*Barret Oliver - D.A.R.Y.L.
