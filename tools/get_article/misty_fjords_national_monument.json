Misty Fiords is about  east of Ketchikan, Alaska, along the Inside Passage coast in extreme southeastern Alaska, comprising  of Tongass National Forest in Alaska's Panhandle. All but  are designated as wilderness.\nCongress reserved the remainder for the Quartz Hill molybdenum deposit, possibly the largest such mineral deposit in the world. The national monument was originally proclaimed by President Jimmy Carter in December 1978 as Misty Fiords National Monument, using the authorization of the Antiquities Act and became a part of an ongoing political struggle between the federal government and the State of Alaska over land use policy and authority that finally led to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980. In that law, it was statutorily established as Misty Fjords National Monument.\nPhysical geography\nJohn Muir compared the area with Yosemite Valley for its similar geology and glacial morphology. Light-colored granite, about 50 to 70 million years old (Eocene Epoch to Cretaceous Period) has been sculpted by glaciers that gouged deep U-shaped troughs throughout the monument. Many of the glacial valleys are filled with sea water and are called \"canals\", but they are not man-made in any way; the walls of these valleys are near-vertical and often rise 2,000 to 3,000&nbsp;feet (600 to 900&nbsp;m) above sea level, and drop 1,000&nbsp;feet (300&nbsp;m) below it.\nAcross from the Salmon River and Portland Canal and the settlement of Hyder, Alaska, small glaciers occupy high areas of the northeast part of the monument. Soule and Through Glaciers cover high plateaus and valleys in the Lincoln and Seward Mountains, where one peak rises to 6,250&nbsp;feet (1,900&nbsp;m) above sea level.  Most mountain tops in the monument are in the 4,000 to 5,000&nbsp;foot (1,200 to 1,500&nbsp;m) elevation range. Tree line is usually around 2,700&nbsp;feet (800&nbsp;m).\nEcology\nWestern hemlock, Sitka spruce and western red cedar dominate the prolific rainforest vegetation; wildlife in abundance includes both grizzly and black bears, many species of salmon, whales, mountain goats, and Sitka black-tailed deer.\nVisitor access\n, have tiny islands that rise only a few feet above water level.]]\nBecause of the remoteness of the area, most visitors arrive by boat or aircraft from Ketchikan or Juneau, Alaska. More adventurous travelers choose an overnight charter service or spend days exploring by kayak.\nHistory\nThe region was first visited by Europeans in 1793 when George Vancouver explored up Behm Canal, the prominent sea-filled glacial trough along the western margin of the monument and separating it from Revillagigedo Island.  Vancouver discovered New Eddystone Rock, a 237-foot (72&nbsp;m) tall column of basalt in the middle of Behm Canal. It was formed within the past 5 million years by volcanic activity, evidence for which is scattered sparsely through the monument, including a lava flow high above Punchbowl Cove, and at Blue River in the far northern part of the monument near the Canada–US border.\nSee also\n*Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act\n*Admiralty Island National Monument\n*List of national monuments of the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/national-monuments/misty-fjords Misty Fjords National Monument] (U.S. Forest Service)\n*[http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/districts/ketchikan/kmrdintro.shtml U.S. Forest Service: Ketchikan-Misty Fiords Ranger District]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100515013851/http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/misty-fjords-national-monument-outdoor-pp2-guide-cid401520.html Misty Fjords National Monument Guide at GORP.com]\n*[https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=361 Misty Fjords National Monument Wilderness] - Wilderness Connect"
