Unlike military police organisations in many other countries, the ROCMP functions as a distinct branch of the Republic of China Armed Forces.\nThe ROCMP is tasked with the protection of senior government leaders against assassination or capture, the guarding of Taiwan’s critical infrastructure and strategic facilities, and the conduct of counterintelligence operations aimed at identifying and neutralising enemy infiltrators, spies, and saboteurs.\nHistory\nWarlord Era\nKu Cheng-lun was the first commander of the military police, serving from November 6, 1931 to November 1940. Under Ku, the ROCMP imitated the Japanese system. Branches were opened across the country, and an intelligence branch was created.\nXi'an Incident\nDuring the Xi'an Incident on December 12, 1936, Zhang Xueliang's troops attacked Huaqing Pool to kidnap Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang was defended by a bodyguard company from the ROCMP 1st Regiment. The kidnappers pursued Chiang and his bodyguards into the mountains and captured him.  Only three bodyguards survived. ROCMP reinforcements were interdicted by Zhang's forces. Chiang recognized the ROCMP's loyalty in 1951 by making 12 December \"Military Police Day\".\nSecond Sino-Japanese War\n]]\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Military Police were often thrust into frontline combat roles for which they were neither specifically trained nor equipped. They fought fiercely during events such as the January 28 Incident of 1932 and the Battle of Nanking in 1937, suffering heavy casualties.\nDuring the Battle of Nanking in December 1937, the 2nd Military Police Instruction Regiment () fought bravely against Japanese forces and was almost entirely wiped out. Deputy Commander of the Military Police Command, Hsiao Shan-Ling (), was killed in action. Japanese accounts later revealed that captured Chinese Nationalist Military Police personnel, identifiable by their white armbands, were frequently summarily executed—a practice similar to that of the Wehrmacht’s treatment of Soviet political commissars during the Second World War. Meanwhile, members of the 2nd Special Police Unit (), operating behind enemy lines, were betrayed by collaborators, resulting in the deaths of Tu Ching-Po () and over a dozen other military police members.\nIn addition to frontline duties, the Military Police played a major role in operations behind Japanese lines and expanded into intelligence and counterinsurgency roles. They were instrumental in suppressing communist influence within Nationalist territory, including the quelling of an attempted uprising during the New Fourth Army Incident of 1941.\nThe Military Police also performed vital security duties towards the end of the war, including escorting Japanese delegates during the formal arrangements for the Surrender of Japan in 1945. By the end of the war, the Military Police had grown to include 27 regiments, three independent battalions, and three training regiments.\nFrom September 1945, the Republic of China dispatched Military Police to Japan as part of the Allied Occupation of Japan. On 14 May 1952, the ROC Military Police detachment stationed in Tokyo, led by Captain Li Chien-Wu (), withdrew from Japan and returned to Taiwan aboard the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's vessel MV Hai Lung ().\nPost-War Mainland Operations\n, circa 1946. The ROC Military Police were tasked with maintaining security in the Nationalist capital and protecting government institutions in the post-war period.]]\nAfter 1945, the Military Police played a key role in post-war internal security:\n*In 1946, the 9th and 16th Military Police Regiments were responsible for safeguarding the National Constituent Assembly in Nanjing.\n*In 1947, the 4th and 21st Regiments were deployed to Taiwan to suppress the February 28 Incident.\n*In the same year, tensions between military police and municipal police in Shanghai erupted into the July 27 Shanghai Police-Military Police Incident (), resulting in bloodshed and a general strike within the city’s police force.\n*In 1948, the Military Police continued to provide security during the convening of the First National Assembly.\nAs the Chinese Civil War intensified, the Military Police maintained a primarily internal security role, guarding key government facilities and protecting senior political leaders. The 7th Company of the 1st Regiment notably participated in the Battle of Kuningtou in Kinmen in 1949, successfully resisting communist landings.\nTaiwan Period\n]]\nFollowing the Nationalist retreat to Taiwan in 1949, the ROCMP was reconstituted. On 1 March 1950, the Southeastern Command Post () of the ROC Military Police was reorganised into the Military Police Headquarters (), on Liangzhou Street, Taipei.\nOfficers and troops from the 1st, 3rd, and 18th Military Police Regiments evacuated from mainland China were integrated with the 4th and 8th Regiments already stationed in Taiwan. This reorganisation led to the establishment of new units, including the 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Regiments, as well as a cadre training class, special services battalion, communications unit, military band, and a high-security intelligence group.\nDuring the early 1950s, ROCMP forces were also involved in overseas operations. In 1954, a detachment was deployed to Korea to retrieve and repatriate over 14,000 Chinese anti-communist exiles following the Korean War, an operation commemorated as \"123 Freedom Day\".\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Military Police Command expanded. In 1955, it played a central role in the controversial arrest and detention of over 300 former subordinates of General Sun Li-jen during the \"Sun Li-jen Incident\", part of the wider White Terror political purges.\nIn 1970, under the advice of the United States Military Assistance Advisory Group, a major reorganisation took place. Regimental structures were converted into regional commands:\n*201st Regional Command: Presidential Guard, derived from the 101st MP Regiment.\n*202nd Regional Command: Capital garrison, from the former 201st MP Regiment.\n*203rd Regional Command: Based in Miaoli County.\n*204th Regional Command: Based in Tainan City.\nThe Military Police School was relocated to Wugu Township (now Wugu District, New Taipei City) in 1975. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, through various Ching An () projects, the ROCMP expanded further by absorbing special forces and former security battalions, leading to the creation of additional regiments and specialist units, including the Military Police Special Service Company (MPSSC) established in 1977.\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw ongoing modernisation and rationalisation, including:\n*Establishment of the Armoured Military Police Battalion (1986).\n*Transfer of coastal and port security duties to the Coast Guard, with several MP battalions reassigned accordingly (1993–1999).\n*Full absorption of Air Force security battalions into ROCMP command (2006, under \"Project Peace\").\nIn 2013, following restructuring within the Ministry of National Defence, the Military Police Command was renamed the Ministry of National Defence General Staff Headquarters - Military Police Command (). Area commands such as the 203rd–205th saw command ranks adjusted. And from 2021, the Command post became renamed as the Ministry of National Defence - Military Police Command ()), with its commander maintaining lieutenant general rank.\nThe ROCMP also underwent further streamlining:\n*In 2014, the Military Police School was renamed the Military Police Training Centre.\n*In 2016, the \"White Terror\" concerns were reignited following an illegal search operation in Taipei conducted by the 202nd Command under the Political Warfare Bureau’s directives, leading to widespread public outrage and subsequent disciplinary action against senior officers.\n*In 2021, with reforms under the National Defence Act amendments, the ROCMP was directly subordinated to the Ministry of National Defence.\nMost recently, in 2024, new battalions (261st–264th) were established to reinforce the defence of Taipei, each battalion comprising five companies and approximately 673 personnel per unit, significantly bolstering the capital’s wartime and peacetime security posture.\nFunctions\nROCMP anti-drug unit\nFunctions\nAccording to the 2006 National Defense Report, the Republic of China Military Police (ROCMP) is tasked with the following responsibilities:\n#Military Functions\n##Conducting special security duties, including presidential protection.\n##Undertaking counter-terrorism operations.\n##Providing garrison security.\n##Enforcing military discipline.\n##Supporting broader military operations.\n#Supportive Functions in Civilian Affairs\n##Executing military justice and law enforcement missions.\n##Maintaining public security.\n##Providing effective support for regional disaster prevention and response efforts.\n##Contributing to the maintenance of social stability and national security.\nMilitary\nThe Republic of China Military Police (ROCMP) is responsible for enforcing military law, maintaining military discipline, and providing manpower support to the civilian police force. In times of emergency, ROCMP units are tasked with performing combat duties. They are also responsible for securing key government facilities, including the Presidential Office Building, and for conducting counter-terrorism operations and VIP protection missions. Furthermore, the ROCMP plays a crucial role in the defence of Taipei, the capital city and political and financial centre of the Republic of China.\nIntelligence\nDue to historical and traditional factors, the Republic of China Military Police (ROCMP) continues to undertake intelligence missions across six categories of security investigations:\n* Special services related to presidential security and protection\n* Political investigations\n* Military investigations\n* Criminal investigations\n* Foreign affairs\n* Social order\nThese investigations are primarily conducted by regional investigation groups, the Mobile Investigation Group, and their superior body, the Intelligence Division of the Military Police Command. Although covering a broad range of areas, the primary focus remains on special services for presidential security and protection, with the practical objective of meeting the requirements of the Commander-in-Chief, the President of the Republic of China.\nIn carrying out its intelligence activities, the ROCMP operates under the supervision and coordination of the National Security Bureau within the National Security Council.\nLaw Enforcement\nbeing guarded by a Republic of China Military Policeman]]\nROC Military Police Special Forces disembarking from a UH-1H helicopter of the ROC Army 602nd Air Cavalry Brigade during a counter-terrorism exercise\nUnder Clause 2, Section 1 of Articles 229, 230, and 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code of the ROC, commissioned officers, non-commissioned officers, and enlisted personnel of the Military Police Corps are authorised to assist public prosecutors, or to act under their command, in the investigation of criminal activities. In effect, the ROC Criminal Procedure Code grants judicial police authority to Security Military Police units within regional Military Police commands, placing them in a similar role to civilian police forces when conducting criminal investigations.\nPrior to the establishment and expansion of specialised mobile police forces in the ROC, Military Police units served as the principal force responsible for suppressing serious criminal activities, violent incidents, and frequent societal unrest or riots. Even today, Military Police personnel continue to collaborate closely with district public prosecutor offices, playing a key role in maintaining law and order across Taiwanese society.\nDue to the frequent rotation of military personnel and the system of conscription in Taiwan, regional Military Police units typically maintain fewer close ties to local communities compared to civilian police departments. Furthermore, unlike local police, Military Police units are not administratively accountable to elected local officials. In cases involving sensitive issues such as prostitution or human trafficking, Military Police are often preferred by public prosecutors at all levels, as their operations are perceived to result in less information leakage and reduced political interference.\nIn fugitive recovery operations, public prosecutors occasionally mobilise Military Police forces to conduct large-scale search and arrest missions. Their ability to deploy disciplined, sizeable, and relatively independent manpower makes them an effective tool for handling major security challenges.\nOrganisation\nRepublic of China Military Police Command\nThe Republic of China Military Police Command () oversees all Military Police units and operations. It is subordinate to the Armed Forces General Staff, the Minister of National Defense, and ultimately to the President of the Republic of China.\nThe command structure includes internal departments responsible for political warfare, unit inspection, personnel management, intelligence, operations, logistics, and communications. It directly supervises the following units and divisions:\n* Military Police School ()\n* Military Police Regional Command (four commands) ()\n** Military Police Armoured Battalion ()\n** Artillery Battalion ()\n** Military Police Battalions (19 battalions) ()\n** Military Police Security Squadrons of the Air Force (10 squadrons) (): Specialised in securing air bases and airfields.\n** Naval Military Police Security Battalions (2 battalions) (): Tasked with the protection of naval bases.\n** Regional Military Police Offices (22 offices) (): Battalion-sized units stationed in urban areas.\n*** Regional Military Police Investigation Groups (): Administratively part of the corresponding regional office, but operationally under the Intelligence Division (G2) of the Military Police Command.\n* Forensic Science Centre ()\n** Chemical Forensic Division ()\n** Physical Forensic Division ()\n** Crime Scene Investigation Division ()\n* Military Police Special Services Company (MPSSC) (): Code-named Night Hawk (夜鷹). This elite unit is stationed in Wugu, Taipei. Information regarding its operations remains classified by the Ministry of National Defense. The unit was formally established in 1978.\n* Xindian Military Prison, New Taipei City ()\n* Lioujia Military Prison, Tainan City ()\nRanks\n; Officers\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|}\n; Enlisted\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|}\nBanners\nROCA Regiment Flag (1934-Military Police).svg|Gendarmerie regiment-level unit flag (1934～1935)\nROCA Regiment Flag (1935-Military Police).svg|Gendarmerie regiment-level unit flag (1935～1953)\nROCA Regiment Flag (1953).svg|Gendarmerie regiment-level unit flag (1953～1961)\nROCMP Unit Flag (1961).svg|Military police unit flag (1961～1964)\nROCMP Unit Flag (1964).svg|Military police unit flag (1964～1986)\nROCMP Unit Flag.svg|Military police unit flag (1986～current)\nEquipment\nVehicles\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:left; font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Model\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Origin\n|-\n| AM General Humvee || United States\n|-\n| CM-32/CM-33 armoured vehicle || Republic of China\n|-\n| CM-34 armoured vehicle || Republic of China\n|-\n| Indian Challenger || United States\n|-\n| V-150 APC || United States\n|-\n| Toyota Hilux || Japan\n|-\n| Mercedes-Benz AMG C43 Cabriolet || Germany\n|-\n| Mercedes-Benz Atego || Germany\n|-\n| Volkswagen Transporter || Germany\n|-\n| Volkswagen Crafter || Germany\n|-\n| Škoda Superb || Czech\n|-\n| Škoda Kodiaq || Czech\n|-\n| Peugeot Traveller || France\n|}\nSmall arms\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:left; font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Model\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Origin\n|-\n| AT4 || Sweden\n|-\n| M2 QCB .50 heavy machine gun || United States\n|-\n| M24 Sniper Weapon System || United States\n|-\n| Mk 153 SMAW || United States\n|-\n| Mk 19 grenade launcher || United States\n|-\n| T74 machine gun || Republic of China\n|-\n| T75 Light machine gun || Republic of China\n|-\n| T75 pistols || Republic of China\n|-\n| T-77 Submachine gun || Republic of China\n|-\n| T-85 grenade launcher || Republic of China\n|-\n| T91 assault rifle || Republic of China\n|-\n| T93 || Republic of China\n|-\n| M14 Made under license as the Type 57 || Republic of China\n|}\nFire support\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:left; font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Model\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Origin\n|-\n| M120 120 mm mortar || United States\n|-\n| T-75 60mm mortar || Republic of China\n|-\n| Kestrel (rocket launcher) || Republic of China\n|}\nGallery\nFile:Members of the Republic of China Military Police on the Indian motorcycles 2024-10-10.jpg|Indian Challenger\nFile:Assault Ladders Truck Diaplay in Military Police School Linkou Campus Ground 20120908a.jpg|Assault Ladder Truck\nFile:10.10 中華民國中樞暨各界慶祝106年國慶大會 (36940440463).jpg|Harley-Davidson 883 Sportsters\nFile:Command Communication Trunk Trucks Raised up Antennas Front View 20120908a.jpg|Command Communication Trunk Trucks\nFile:ROCMP Lincoln Town Car left-head 20130615.jpg|ROCMP custom Lincoln Town Car drop top\nFile:ROCMP Ford Excursion limited Armored Car Display at CKS Memorial Hall Square 20140607b.jpg|ROCMP Ford Excursion limited Armored Car\nFile:ROC Military Police V-150s Commando Armored Cars in Camp 20160924.jpg|ROC Military Police V-150s Commando Armored Cars\nFile:ROC Military Police Military Light Tactical Vehicles and V-150s Commando under Roof in Camp 20160924.jpg|ROC Military Police Military Light Tactical Vehicles and V-150s Commando\nFile:Yunpao APC in Military Police School 20120908a.jpg|Yunpao APC in Military Police School\nFile:ROC Military Police Patrol Car in CCK Air Force Base 20111112.jpg|Volkswagen Passat (B5) patrol car\nFile:T93 sniper rifle.jpg|T93 sniper rifle\nFile:T91-3 (65).JPG|T91-3 assault rifle\nFile:T75K1 by James Tung.JPG|T75K1 pistol\nFile:Kurstal anti tank rocket.JPG|Kestrel rocket launcher\nSee also\n*People's Armed Police\n*Military Police Corps (United States)\n*Military Intelligence Bureau\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://afpc.mnd.gov.tw/English/index.aspx ROC Military Police Command]"
