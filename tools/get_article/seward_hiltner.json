He taught for many years at both the University of Chicago Divinity School and Princeton Theological Seminary.\nEarly life and education\nBorn on November 26, 1909 in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, Seward Hiltner received a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1931 from Lafayette College and a doctorate in theological ethics in 1952 from the University of Chicago.\nCareer and ministry\nOrdained in 1935 as a minister in the United Presbyterian Church of North America, Hiltner served from 1935-1938 as the executive secretary of the Council for the Clinical Training of Theological Students. From 1938-1950 he was the executive secretary of the Federal Council of Churches. In 1950, he joined the University of Chicago Divinity School, where he helped establish a pioneering doctoral program in Religion and Personality, incorporating theology, psychology, sociology, and medical sciences. Under his leadership, the field of pastoral theology gained academic recognition and expanded globally.\nHiltner joined the faculty at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1961, and retired in 1980.\nDuring his career Hiltner also taught at Yale Divinity School, Union Theological Seminary, at the Menninger School of Psychiatry, and at the University of Utrecht.\nHiltner authored twelve books and over 500 articles, shaping the modern disciplines of pastoral care and pastoral counseling.\nImpact\nHiltner was instrumental in redefining practical theology as a theological discipline grounded in the practice of ministry, rather than merely a set of ministerial techniques. He developed the perspectival method, which approached ministry through three lenses: communication, organization, and shepherding. He associated the shepherding perspective specifically with pastoral theology, emphasizing care within the parish context.\nHiltner's influential book Preface to Pastoral Theology traced the historical roots of the \"cure of souls\" and drew on case-study methods inspired by 19th-century pastor Ichabod Spencer. Although his work contributed to the rise of pastoral counseling centers, Hiltner maintained that pastoral care should remain rooted in congregational ministry. His collaboration with Rev. Dr. Lowell Colston in The Context of Pastoral Care reinforced this view by contrasting counseling within a community setting with care offered in clinical contexts.\nPersonal life and death\nHiltner was married to Helen Margaret Johansen, and had two children. He died in Princeton, New Jersey on November 19, 1984.\nSelected publications\n* Religion and Health. New York: Macmillan, 1943.\n* Pastoral Counseling.
