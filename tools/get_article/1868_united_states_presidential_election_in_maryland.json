Voters chose seven representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMaryland voted for the Democratic nominee, Horatio Seymour over the Republican nominee, Ulysses S. Grant. Seymour won the state by a margin of 34.4%.\nIn this election, Maryland voted 39.72% more Democratic than the nation at-large.\nWith 67.2% of the popular vote, Maryland would be Seymour's third strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote after Kentucky and Louisiana. To date this is the best performance by a Democrat in Maryland history.\nThis was the first presidential election that Wicomico County was able to vote in.\nResults\n}}\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Horatio Seymour\nDemocratic\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Ulysses S.
