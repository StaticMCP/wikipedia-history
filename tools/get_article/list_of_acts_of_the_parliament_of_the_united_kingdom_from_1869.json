For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title.  Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n32 & 33 Vict.\nThe first session of the 20th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 10 December 1868 until 11 August 1868.\nPublic general acts\nor the Supply Act 1869|public|1|19-03-1869|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply certain sums out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the years ending the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and sixty eight, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine, and one thousand eight hundred and seventy.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  as relates to the approval by meetings of incorporated railway companies of bills and certificates for conferring further powers on those companies.|note4= }}\n|\n| or the Supply (No. 2) Act 1869|public|8|13-05-1869|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the sum of seventeen million one hundred thousand pounds out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the year ending the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy.|note4= }}\n|  and the Acts continuing the temporary provisions of the same.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n| or the Customs and Inland Revenue Duties Act 1869|public|14|24-06-1869|archived=n|An Act to grant certain Duties of Customs and Inland Revenue, and to repeal and alter other Duties of Customs and Inland Revenue.}}\n|\n|  as provides that Norfolk Island is to be part of the diocese of Tasmania.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the University of Oxford Act 1869|public|20|24-06-1869|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to remove doubts as to the validity of certain Statutes made by the Convocation of the University of Oxford.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n| or the '''Borough Recorders' Deputies Act 1869|public|23|12-07-1869|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to extend the Power of Recorders to appoint Deputies in certain cases.|note4= }}\n|\n|  section nine, by extending the age at which orphan and deserted children may be kept out at nurse.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Oyster and Mussel Fisheries Orders Confirmation (No. 2) Act 1869|public|31|12-07-1869|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to confirm an Order made by the Board of Trade under The Sea Fisheries Act, 1868, relating to Langston, and to amend the forty-fifth section of The Sea Fisheries Act, 1868.|note4=|po1=Order for the establishment and maintenance by the South of England Oyster Company, Limited, of a several oyster fishery in the Langston Channel and other parts of Langston Harbour in the county of Southampton, and in certain rythes or channels in Chichester Harbour in the said county.|po1short=n}}\n|\n|\n|\n| }}\n|  in so far as the exemption of Lighthouse Keepers and their assistants from serving on Juries is thereby abolished.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Medical Officers Superannuation (Ireland) Act 1869|public|50|02-08-1869|archived=n|An Act to provide for Superannuation Allowances to Medical Officers of poor law unions, and of dispensary districts of such unions, in Ireland.}}\n|  and to give Jurisdiction in certain Maritime Causes. }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Municipal Corporation (Election) Act 1869or the Municipal Franchise Act 1869|public|55|02-08-1869|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to shorten the Term of Residence required as a Qualification for the Municipal Franchise, and to make provision for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Trades Union Funds Protection Act 1869or the Trade Union Funds Protection Act 1869or the Trade Unions Funds Protection Act 1869'''|public|61|09-08-1869|archived=n|An Act to protect the Funds of Trades Unions from Embezzlement and Misappropriation.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  to defray the charge of the Pay, Clothing, and contingent and other expenses of the Disembodied Militia in Great Britain and Ireland;
