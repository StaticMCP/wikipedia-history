It's a compilation of Eddie Harris comedy monologues before sets at nightclubs in Minneapolis, Evanston, Milwaukee and Redondo Beach, with plenty of sex to go around. Actually, Eddie is pretty droll in his X-rated way, telling the audience what is really on their minds at nightclubs... Hard to find – which is just as well\".\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Eddie Harris except as indicated\n# \"People Getting Ready to Go See Eddie Harris\" – 8:16\n# \"What I'm Thinking Before I Start Playing\" – 4:49\n# \"Are There Any Questions\" – 10:23\n# \"The Reason Why I'm Talking\" – 0:11\n# \"The Next Band – Music: Brother Soul, Pt. 1  2:54\n# \"Ain't Shit Happening – Music: Brother Soul, Pt. 2\" – 4:04\n# \"Projects and High Rises – Music: Bee Bump\" – 4:52\n# \"Singing and Straining – Music: The Aftermath\" – 6:47\n# \"People Enjoying Themselves\" – 4:02\n# \"Eddie Atlantic\" – 1:39\nPersonnel\n*Eddie Harris – tenor saxophone, vocals\n*Ronald Muldrow – guitar\n*Odell Brown – organ\n*Bradley Bobo – bass\n*Paul Humphrey – drums\n*Calvin Barnes – percussion\nReferences"
