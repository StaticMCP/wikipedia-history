Brian Joines of Image Comics suspects that the reason Krampus (specifically, as well as dark aspects of Christmas in general) has not been historically popularized in America is a social artifact resulting from \"the nature of how we view Christmas in this country, both as a big day for kids and as the birth of a big religious figurehead\". In some North American depictions, Krampus is an antihero who seeks to prevent children from becoming spoiled by rampant consumerism flowing from the economics of Christmas.\nFilm\n*Krampus: The Christmas Devil: a direct-to-video horror film (2013).\n*vom Krampus: zwischen Latexhaut und Schaffell: video-documentary film (2013).\n* Krampus: The Reckoning: a direct-to-video horror film (2015).\n* Krampus: a horror comedy (2015) from Universal Pictures, where Krampus is physically portrayed by Luke Hawker and voiced by Gideon Emery.\n* Krampus: The Devil Returns: a direct-to-video horror sequel to Krampus: The Christmas Devil (2016).\n* Krampus Unleashed: a direct-to-video horror film (2016).\n* Mother Krampus: a direct-to-video horror film (2017).\nIn production\n* Anti-Claus (initially titled Comes the Krampus), from Kevin Smith.\n* Happy Krampus!, from Walden Media and The Jim Henson Company.\nTelevision\n* G4 commercial (2003).
