It was commissioned by the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party as part of the Party's 100th anniversary celebrations. The film depicts the story of the North Korea-allied Chinese People's Volunteer Army, forcing U.S. forces to withdraw in a fictionalized retelling of the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War.\nThe Battle at Lake Changjin is the most expensive film ever produced in China, with a budget of $200 million. The film grossed $913 million at the worldwide box office, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2021. It surpassed Wolf Warrior 2, becoming the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time and the highest-grossing non-English film. On 5 February 2025, The Battle at Lake Changjin was surpassed by Ne Zha 2, which became the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time, the highest-grossing non-English film, and the highest-grossing film in a single market. A sequel to the film, The Battle at Lake Changjin II, was released on 1 February 2022.\nThe film's depiction of the battle has been described as containing historical inaccuracies and has garnered controversy in some countries, including South Korea. The film has also been described as propaganda.\nPlot\nWu Qianli, commander of the People's Liberation Army's 7th Company, returns home after the Chinese Civil War. He tells his family that his brother, Wu Baili, was killed in action. Having been allotted land for his service, he promises his parents he will build them a house, but his leave is cancelled when China enters the Korean War. Qianli's younger brother, Wanli, asks to go with, but is refused.\nThe film jumps to 15 September 1950, where the Battle of Incheon is underway. U.S. aircraft are shown indiscriminately bombing a village in Andong Province, China. The film then jumps to Beijing on 4 October 1950 where the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party is meeting in Zhongnanhai to discuss the war situation. Mao Zedong asks whether the U.S. Army crossing the 38th parallel means they will also cross the Yalu. The military briefer states that by stationing forces in Taiwan, the U.S. has already invaded China and U.S. forces in Korea threatens China's security.\nTo Qianli's horror, Wanli has enlisted and is stationed in the 7th Company. Wanli gets bullied by the other members of the 7th Company en route to Korea, with Qianli refusing to help him and at first refuses to even give him a rifle. The train is bombed while track is being fixed, forcing the 7th Company to continue on foot while avoiding American aircraft. The 7th Company stumble upon a battle and aid a group of Chinese soldiers. Wanli and Qianli kill four Americans in hand-to-hand combat and avoid being killed by a tank. The 7th Company continues to the front lines, eventually arriving and delivering field radios.\nThe 7th Company is allowed to rest. Mao Zedong's son, Anying, serving under the pseudonym \"Liu\", helps distribute clothing to them before the company is ordered to the front lines. The Chinese soldiers stay hidden in the mountains, running low on supplies and facing below-freezing temperatures while American soldiers celebrate Thanksgiving in relative comfort and anticipate going home for Christmas. U.S. radio detection detects the headquarters where Anying is stationed and aircraft are sent to bomb the base. While most of the staff take shelter in bunkers, Anying runs back to the base to collect a map and is killed in the bombing.\nThe 27 November offensive begins with Chinese soldiers swarming the positions of the U.S. Army 31st Infantry Regiment at Sinhung-ni. The Americans begin to retreat and Qianli shoots the U.S. commander, Colonel Allan MacLean, but then stops Wanli from executing him. At Hagaru-ri reinforcements are ordered to Sinhung-ni. A USMC Vought F4U Corsair attacks the Chinese forces and drops a smoke marker on the overrun base but is then shot down by a Chinese soldier using a bazooka. Lei Suisheng puts the smoke marker in a jeep and drives off, joining up with the retreating U.S. column. The U.S. bombers destroy the American column and Lei is killed.\nThe scene then cuts to Hagaru-ri which is under attack by the Chinese. U.S. forces are forced to retreat by air and land while they are pursued by Chinese forces. The scene then shifts again to the 3rd Company, 3rd Division, 58th Corps on Hill 1071, which is shown holding out against U.S. forces. Yang Gensi, as the last surviving member of his unit, suicidally attacks American tanks with a satchel charge. The retreating U.S. Marine column finds a group of Chinese soldiers frozen to death at their post. General Oliver P. Smith salutes them; his voiceover is heard saying that fighting against such strong-willed men, the U.S. was not ordained to win.\nThe closing scenes show a U.S. mass grave at Hungnam as the city burns during the Hungnam evacuation. Captions state that 105,000 U.S. troops were evacuated by 24 December and that the 9th Corps captured Hungnam. The captions explain the significance of the battle of Lake Changjin, which was a \"perfect example for annihilating a U.S. reinforced regiment\" and how Chinese forces stopped MacArthur's \"presumptuous\" plan to end the war by Christmas and \"set the stage for the final victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea\" despite the deaths of more than 197,000 Chinese.\nCast\n* Wu Jing as Wu Qianli, commander of the 7th Company.\n* Jackson Yee as Wu Wanli, Artillery Platoon soldier of the 7th Company, younger brother of Wu Qianli.\n* Kevin Lee as Colonel Allan MacLean, commanding officer 31st Infantry Regiment (\"Polar Bears\").\n* John F.

It is the second-highest-grossing film of 2021 and the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time. The film earned a total of $82 million in its first two days of release, and reached 1.012 billion yuan ($155.12 million) on 2 October.

The film remained atop the Chinese box office for a month, being displaced by No Time to Die during the weekend of 29–31 October. It overtook Wolf Warrior 2 on 24 November to become the highest-grossing film in China. It also became the second highest-grossing film of all time in a single market, after Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) in the United States.\nOn 5 February 2025, The Battle at Lake Changjin was displaced by Ne Zha 2 as the highest-grossing Chinese movie and highest-grossing non-English film of all time.\nCritical and audience response\nAmong Chinese ratings sites the movie has received a 9.5 on Maoyan and 7.6 on Douban.\nThe Global Times, a tabloid of the Chinese Communist Party, said that \"the national feeling displayed in the film echoes the rising public sentiment in safeguarding national interests in front of provocations, which has great implications for today's China-US competition.\"\nFilm critic Todd McCarthy of Deadline Hollywood in reviewing, said that \"Anyone into big-time action cinema on the largest possible screen will more than get their money's worth, even if the film is simplistic and entirely predictable in its goals, both as action and politics. But it doesn't matter how big your screen is at home—if you want to see this at all, see it on a really big screen.\" Conversely, Phil Hoad of The Guardian gave a two out of five rating, saying the film was a \"sporadically thrilling, historically dubious account of a Korean war standoff, with all the subtlety of a rocket launcher.\"\nReviewing for Forbes, Scott Mendelson said \"It's arguably no more jingoistic, at least until the final montage, than (offhand) Pearl Harbor or We Were Soldiers.\" He further described the film as spectacular with its \"copious mass battle sequences and intricate action set pieces\" against what was a \"pretty dry war picture\" and a \"generic war actioner\" when compared with The Eight Hundred.\nReviewing in The Independent, Louis Chilton wrote that, while it was fair to describe the film as propaganda, the same criticism should be directed at similar American films such as American Sniper or Captain Marvel.\nControversies and inaccuracies\nThe movie has been described as propaganda. Sophia Yan of The Daily Telegraph wrote that it is an \"anti-US propaganda film\" that tapped into a \"growing nationalist sentiment\", while BBC News described the film as \"Chinese propaganda\". Stanley Rosen, a political science professor from the University of Southern California, stated that the release and popularity of the film \"is definitely related to the ongoing tensions with the US, and has been promoted that way—sometimes indirectly, but still very clearly\". Sun Hongyun, an associate professor at Beijing Film Academy said that the film was \"an extraordinary and perfect collusion of capital and political propaganda\".\nCNN noted that the film was commissioned by the propaganda department of the Chinese Communist Party, while Business Insider and The Economist said that the movie was part of a \"main melody\" genre of entertainment that praises China, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Liberation Army.\nAn article in The New York Times described the film as a government-sponsored movie that appeared to resonate with the Chinese public at a time of tension in the US-China relationship despite \"mixed reviews, a torturous running time and technical errors of military history, tapping into nationalistic sentiment that China's leader, Xi Jinping, has nurtured\" and underscored the extent to which the Chinese Communist Party was determined to shape popular culture.\nRebecca Davis of Foreign Policy described the film's sequel and companion piece, The Battle at Lake Changjin II, as propaganda that \"extol the virtues of sacrificing oneself for the Chinese Communist Party.\" She further described the film as \"plodding, heavy-handed, and preachy\", and that although the film \"portrays U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur as a nuclear-war-hungry boor and spends most of its two-and-a-half-hour run time slaughtering Americans\", its subject is \"the suffering of Chinese troops, not pure anti-Americanism.\"\nPark Min-hee of The Hankyoreh stated that the film is a part of \"political propaganda suggesting that China will fight and ultimately defeat the US\" in a new Cold War that began in 2018, she also wrote that \"such patriotic propaganda is also intended to control the grievances caused by rising unemployment and inequality\". She further criticized China's interpretation of the Korean War, as \"by only considering the outcome of the battle for the two superpowers of the US and China, it fails to consider Koreans' position, not to mention their sacrifice. Xi's declaration that China fought a just war in which it resolutely defeated the \"intruder\" disregards the historical fact that the war was started when North Korea invaded with support from China and the Soviet Union.\"\nThe nonprofit Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting stated that there is \"no doubt that the film is propaganda\" and \"a few outlets interjected that the film failed to mention that North Korea had invaded the South first.\"\nUS Marine Lieutenant General Richard E. Carey, a veteran of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, criticized the film as propaganda and a distorted depiction of the battle. Carey said that at Chosin Reservoir, despite being overwhelmingly outnumbered, American forces badly defeated, demoralized and so wounded the Chinese forces, that a legion's worth of men had to withdraw to China to completely regroup and reequip. He described the Battle of Chosin Reservoir as a Chinese defeat. Carey also stated that up to 100,000 Korean refugees were evacuated together with UN troops at Hungnam. In addition, Kim Young-kweon of Voice of America noted that during the battle, US and UN forces suffered significantly fewer casualties than the Chinese.\nAfter the release of the movie, former Chinese journalist Luo Changping was arrested by police and held on the charge of \"infringing the reputation and honour of national martyrs\" after multiple police reports were filed over his online post in Sina Weibo, where he posted commentary questioning China's role in the Korean War, drawing criticism from thousands of social media users.\nThe film has been banned in Malaysia, a country where the dissemination of communist ideology is illegal.\nDeutsche Welle reported that the film has raised anger in South Korea, with the public calling it \"propaganda filled with historical inaccuracies.\" South Korean former diplomat Ra Jong-yil called the film \"nonsense\" and \"whitewashing\" and accused it of attempting to reshape the narrative of events during the Korean War. The reaction raised the possibility that the film would not be distributed in South Korea.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Ceremony\n! Category\n! Recipient\n!
