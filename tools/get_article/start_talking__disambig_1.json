It was later cancelled when they parted ways with the singer Mike Palace in 2012. Since the group had such amount of material already they took the chance and started recording the music for a full-length album. Together with Marcus Forsberg at Tweak Studios in Helsingborg they started the recording process in 2013. In the winter of 2013, Bulletrain went to Stockholm to finish the record with the vocals for the album with the producers RamPac (Johan Ramström, Patrik Magnusson). It was mixed and mastered by Buster Odeholm.\nTrack listing\nSingles\n* \"Out of Control\"\n* \"Phantom Pain\"\nPersonnel\n*Jonas Tillheden - drums, backing vocals\n*Mattias Persson - lead guitar, backing vocals\n*Robin Bengtsson - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n*Sebastian Sundberg - lead vocals\n*Niklas Månsson - bass guitar, backing vocals\nAdditional musicians\n*Gustav Bergström, bass guitar on tracks \"From the bottom of my heart\", \"Out of control\" and \"Phantom pain\".\n*Kalle Yttergren, backing vocals on tracks \"Dicing with death\" and \"Joanna's secret\".\nReferences\n*[http://mwiemetalblog.over-blog.com/2014/10/cd-review-bulletrain-start-talking.html Start Talking] Markus'Heavy Music Blog.com Retrieved November 24, 2014\n*[http://www.melodicrock.com/articles/showcase/2014/09/12/bulletrain-start-talking-showcase] Melodic Rock.com Retrieved November 24, 2014\n*[http://classicrock.teamrock.com/news/2014-09-03/bulletrain-go-out-of-control] Classic Rock.com Retrieved November 24, 2014\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bulletrain.org Official website]\n*"
