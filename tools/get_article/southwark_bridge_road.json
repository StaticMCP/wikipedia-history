This connection did not come about until the creation of Southwark Street in the 1880s. It does not start at the main northern roads junction at Elephant and Castle either.\nAt the southern end is the campus of London South Bank University. The Ministry of Sound, a well-known nightclub, is in Gaunt Street, just to the east, and is faced with Two Fifty One, a new mixed-used high-rise building, the construction of which generated issues for the club.\nThe London Fire Brigade Museum and the London Fire Brigade Training Centre were located on the road before the site started to be redeveloped in 2015.\nAt the northern end, across Southwark Street near the river are the Rose Theatre Exhibition, the Financial Times headquarters and Anchor Terrace, a Georgian building standing on the site of Shakespeare's original Globe Theatre.\nThe road is designated the A300.\nMajor adjoining roads and streets\n* Borough Road\n* Marshalsea Road\n* Southwark Street\n* Union Street\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.london-se1.co.uk/restaurants/by-street/southwark+bridge+road Restaurants, pubs and bars in Southwark Bridge  Road] from [http://www.london-se1.co.uk/ London SE1 community website]"
