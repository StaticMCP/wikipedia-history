The DPR historically sought to be recognised as independent after breaking away from Ukraine but was annexed by Russia on 30 September 2022. The status is now as an unrecognised Russian republic.\nThe DPR is closely linked to the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), which has a nearly identical political status and history of formation.\nThe DPR has foreign relations with Russia, North Korea, and Syria, as of July 2022. The DPR also maintains relations with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two breakaway states that are claimed by Georgia. The DPR and LPR mutually recognise each other.\nForeign relations of the Donetsk People's Republic\n* – Donetsk People's Republic–Russia relations\n* – Donetsk People's Republic–South Ossetia relations\n**Representative Office of South Ossetia, Donetsk\nEmbassies of the Donetsk People's Republic\n*  – in 2014, the DPR opened a Representative Office in Moscow\n:*  Crimea – in 2016, DPR sympathizers opened a Representative Office in Simferopol\n*  – in 2015, a DPR Representative Office opened in Tskhinvali\nSee also\n* List of states with limited recognition\nReferences"
