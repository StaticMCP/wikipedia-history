The party was particularly concerned with policy addressing employment rights and police attitudes, and liaised with gay groups throughout the capital, helping them apply for grants from the GLC. They also planned the London Lesbian and Gay Centre, which closed in 1991.\nIts work culminated in the publication of Changing the World: a London charter for gay and lesbian rights. The charter included 142 specific recommendations to improve the lives of gay and lesbian Londoners.\nOne of the important point of its activity was the forming of the Gay London Police Monitoring Group in 1982.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/1/3229.htm Gay Rights Working Party in The British Library of Political and Economic Science]"
