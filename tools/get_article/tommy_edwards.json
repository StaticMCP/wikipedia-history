His most successful record was the multi-million-selling song \"It's All in the Game\", becoming the first African-American to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nCareer\nBorn in Richmond, Virginia, Edwards had his own radio show in Richmond the 1940s. In 1946, Edwards wrote \"That Chick's Too Young to Fry\", which was a sizable hit for Louis Jordan. Edwards began recording for the music label in 1949. He moved to New York in 1950, and recorded a few demos. When MGM heard his demos, they gave him a recording contract, but more for his voice rather than his compositions. Edwards first recorded four songs for MGM, including his own song \"All Over Again\".\nEdwards was a singer most remembered for his 1958 hit \"It's All in the Game\", which appeared in the list of Billboard number-one singles of 1958. He sang his hit song on The Ed Sullivan Show, on September 14, 1958. The song was composed by then-future U.S. Vice-President Charles G. Dawes in 1911 as \"Melody in A Major\" with lyrics written in 1951 by Carl Sigman. Edwards originally recorded and charted the song in 1951, but it climbed to only No. 18. The better-known 1958 version was on the same record label (MGM) and was backed by the same orchestra leader (Leroy Holmes), but with a different arrangement more suited to the rock and roll-influenced style of the time. As well as topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, the song also got to number one on the R&B chart and the UK Singles Chart. The single sold over 3.5 million copies globally, earning gold disc status. The gold disc was presented in November 1958. His second biggest hit was his 1959 re-recording of \"Please, Mr. Sun\" (written by Ramon Martin Getzov and Sid Frank), which reached No. 11. Another of Edwards' hits was \"Love Is All We Need\" which reached No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nAlthough Edwards recorded a number of other songs, none came close to achieving the same level of success, though several of his songs later became hits for other artists, such as \"A Fool Such as I\" by Elvis Presley, \"It's All in the Game\" by Cliff Richard and the Four Tops (Eddie Holman's version of it was the B-side of his hit \"Hey There Lonely Girl\"), \"Please Love Me Forever\" by Cathy Jean and the Roommates (1961) and by Bobby Vinton (1967), and \"Morning Side of the Mountain\" recorded by Donny and Marie Osmond.\nOn October 23, 1969, Edwards died at the age of 47 from massive internal hemorrhaging due to esophageal varices linked to cirrhosis, per his death certificate. He is interred at the Quioccasin Baptist Church Cemetery in Henrico, Virginia. His headstone says he was born on October 15, 1922, but his death certificate says he was born October 12, 1926. The 1930 census indicates that his correct birth year is 1922. The informant was his sister, Buena.\nEdwards received a Virginia Highway Marker in 2008, erected near Pemberton Elementary School, off Quioccasin Road, in Henrico County. In July 2008, Richmond mayor L. Douglas Wilder signed a proclamation declaring October 15, 2008 \"Tommy Edwards Day\".\nIn September 2012, Cherry Red Records label Shout issued a double CD collection of Edwards's work, entitled ''It's All in the Game (The MGM Recordings 1958–1960)'', which comprised his first four MGM albums and singles from the two years following that single's huge success.\nCountry and western crossover album\nIn 1961, Edwards broke new ground by releasing a studio album entitled Golden Country Hits. His album of country interpretations predated Ray Charles' Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music and featured covers of some of the same song choices, including \"You Don't Know Me\", a popular crossover ballad by country songwriter Cindy Walker.\nPartial discography\nAlbums\n*Tommy Edwards Sings — Regent MG 6096 (Mono only)–1958\n*''It's All in the Game — MGM E (Mono)/SE (Stereo)

original stereo master tape was either lost or destroyed.\nThe recording \"Take These Chains from My Heart\" is heard on compact disc in re-channeled stereo because, as with the above song, the original stereo master was lost or destroyed.\nThese recordings were issued on the MGM record label unless otherwise noted.\n\"It's All in the Game\" (1958 version) was produced by Harry Myerson. He is assumed to be the producer for all tracks from this point forward, although this cannot be confirmed.\nThe orchestra was conducted and the arrangements were made on all records by LeRoy Holmes.\nTelevision appearances\n*Sing It Again (1951)\n*''Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall (1951–1952)\n*Songs for Sale (1952)\n*The Ed Sullivan Show (1958)\n*The Arthur Murray Party (1958)\nSee also\n*List of artists who reached number one on the Hot 100 (U.S.)\n*List of artists who reached number one on the Billboard'' R&B chart\n*List of artists who reached number one on the UK Singles Chart\n*List of artists who reached number one on the Australian singles chart\n*List of number-one rhythm and blues hits (United States)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Edwards_Thomas_J_Tommy_1922-1969 Biography] at Encyclopedia Virginia\n*[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Tommy-Edwards.html Oldies.com biography of Tommy Edwards]\n*[https://archive.today/20090221031351/http://www.thompeace.com/edwards/tommy_edwards.htm Fansite with discography and song lyrics]"
