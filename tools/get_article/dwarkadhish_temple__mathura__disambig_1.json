In this historic temple, Krishna is worshipped in his Dwarkanath or Dwarkadhish form along with his feminine counterpart goddess Radha in the form of Radharani. The temple belongs to Pushtimarg tradition.\nThe current structure of temple was built up by Seth Gokul Das Parikh, the treasurer of then Gwalior State (Scindia) in 1814, with approval and donation from Shrimant Daulatrao Scindia, Maharajah of Gwalior. Gokuldas was a devotee of the third Gaddi of the Pushtimarg whose seat is the Dwarkadhish temple in Kankroli, Rajasthan.\nFestivals\nThe main festival of the temple is called Hindola festival which is celebrated annually in the month of Shravana  which usually falls in July-August.
