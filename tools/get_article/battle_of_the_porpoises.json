The porpoises had unexpectedly surfaced near the ship, prompting the crew to shoot at the animals.\nContext\n, commander of the cruiser during the incident]]\nNear the end of the First World War, the ships of the Brazilian Naval Division for War Operations received orders from the British Admiralty to move to Gibraltar. Admiral Pedro Max Frontin, commander of the cruiser , was warned to be careful while under operations, as the pre-dreadnought battleship , designated to scout for the Brazilian flotilla, had recently been sunk by a German submarine. German U-boats posed a significant threat at the time, with a potentially large number of them being present in the area.\nThe incident\n]]\nDuring a night patrol, the watchman in the crew warned of a sighting of a periscope in the water. Fearing a potential German attack, the crewmen began firing upon the ocean blindly, trying to defend themselves from the German submarines. The waters turned red after minutes of continuous gunfire from the ship's artillery. What was initially thought to have been a German submarine periscope was, in reality, a shoal of porpoises. This was only determined after observing the bodies of the cetaceans floating on the surface.\nExplanations and similar incidents\nAt the time there were no electronic detection methods for submarines, and it is thought this may have contributed to the event. Such incidents of collateral damage are not uncommon in marine warfare, often caused by extreme tension and battle stress. A similar incident occurred during the Falklands War, more than six decades after. The British frigate , possessing modern electronic equipment, confused a pod of whales passing by for Argentinian submarines, firing upon the animals.\nSee also\n* Brazil during World War I\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Daróz Carlos Roberto Carvalho.
