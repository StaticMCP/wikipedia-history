It is the sequel to One Piece: Pirate Warriors. Due to the success of the first game, the sequel was released the year following. It was released in Japan on March 20, 2013, Europe on August 30, 2013, and in the U.S. on September 3, 2013.\nA sequel, One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3, was released in March 2015. And a fourth game, One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4, was released in March 2020.\nGameplay\nThe game no longer uses a canon story like the original. Instead it uses an original story that take place two years after the Straw Hats Pirates entered the New World. Battles have been changed to focus more on the warrior gameplay, and the player will have to fight through higher numbers of enemies than the previous game. The quick time events from the first game has been removed completely. The game also features a coin system, in which players can spend the money they earn from stages to level up new characters quickly, instead of training them from level 1.\nOne noticeable change from the previous game is how support is handled. Players can build up a support gauge throughout gameplay, and use it to go into \"Style mode\". When in this mode they have the option of temporarily switching characters, and playing as the new character until the support gauge runs out. Style mode also gives a different benefit depending on the characters used: \"Armament\" characters do more damage when attacking, while \"Observation\" characters effectively slow down time, while retaining their normal speed.\nCharacters\nThe game features a total of 27 playable characters, including all 13 characters from the previous game. As with the previous game, other characters appear as non-playable enemies.\nNewcomers to the series are marked in bold.\n* Bartholomew Kuma\n* Boa Hancock\n* Borsalino (Kizaru)\n* Brook\n* Buggy\n* Crocodile\n* Dracule Mihawk\n* Edward Newgate (Whitebeard)\n* Enel\n* Franky\n* Jimbei\n* Kuzan (Aokiji)\n* Marco\n* Marshall D.
