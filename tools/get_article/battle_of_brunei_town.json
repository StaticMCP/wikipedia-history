The battle was part of the Anglo-Bruneian War between the Royal Navy and the Sarawakian forces lead by Rear-Admiral Thomas Cochrane, Pengiran Badruddin and Pengiran Muda Hashim respectively and the forces of Pengiran Yusof\nBackground\nin August 1845, Cochrane who previously arrived at Brunei in July, reappeared with a handful ships to release two Lascar seamen who were believed to be hidden there. Badruddin accused Yusof of being involved in the slave trade due to his close relations with a notable pirate leader Sharif Usman in Marudu Bay and the Sultanate of Sulu. Denying the allegation, Yusof refused to attend a meeting with Cochrane.\nYusof was a rogue noblemen, he was associated with Muhammad Alam who fought against Omar Ali Saifuddien II over control of the sultanate in the Bruneian Civil War of 1826. He was very unpopular as the villagers of Kampong Burong Pingai turned against him. He likely only supported Muhammad Alam due to the fact Muhammad Alam opposed Western influence. He likely married into the House of Osman.\nBattle\nFighting started when Yusof fired a cannon shot at Cochrane's squadron from his house.  fired on his house in retaliation, with Yusof fleeing.\nTwo days after Cochrane and his steamers left, Yusof seized the hill behind his late house with 300 Kedayans, and commenced an attack on Brunei Town, with Badruddin defeating him with a force similar in manpower.\nHe once commenced another attack, this time using sailors from Marudu which were defeated by Hashim.\nAftermath\nYusof fled to Kimanis in northern Borneo, who was reported to be executed but recent research suggests otherwise. His faction's power continued to grow until 1906.\nReferences"
