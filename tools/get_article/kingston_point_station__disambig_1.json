It was built in Kingston, New York, to permit passengers and cargo to be transferred between the U&D and boats transiting the Hudson River between Albany and New York. It was also adjacent to Kingston Point Park, which was an attraction in itself, and there was a nearby trolley depot.\nHistory\nFerry service across the river between Kingston and Rhinebeck began early in the 1700s. The initial location of the west dock is unclear, but by the end of the century it was located at Kingston Point, with stagecoach connection to Kingston proper. The road across the swamp to Kingston Point was frequently in poor condition. On November 11, 1852, Rondout replaced Kingston Point as the main western terminal, while a new terminal replaced two separate older docks in Rhinebeck. An older boat continued to run between Kingston Point and one of the old Rhinebeck docks for the remainder of the year, but did not resume the route when ice cleared in the spring of 1853.\nOriginally, U&D passengers transferred between train and ferry at Rondout station next to Rondout Creek. As boats became larger, they could no longer easily navigate the shallow and narrow waters of the Rondout Creek. In order to facilitate the connection with the larger boats, the U&D extended its rail line approximately one mile east on fill over a tidal swamp to deep water on the Hudson River.\nThe U&D stopped passenger service to the station in 1924. The day-liner service stopped shortly after the Great Depression. Most of the buildings in the park, including the station, were demolished. Only the trolley depot survived, though it has since been rebuilt.\nThe tracks to the Point were also the tail of a switchback that remained in freight service until 1977. Today the Trolley Museum of New York operates a trolley on the former U&D tracks to Kingston Point.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.tmny.org/ Trolley Museum of New York]"
