Sukanya Verma from Rediff.com wrote, \"Don't ask any questions. Don't look for any kind of logic. Go with the flow. Otherwise, you're not ready for this David Dhawan-Govinda flick.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama criticised the film, concluding, \"Kunwara has the super-successful David Dhawan-Govinda combination as its strong point, but the film pales in comparison to the hits the two have delivered earlier. The film may start off well, but it lacks a good script to sustain after the initial curiosity subsides.\"\nAwards\nKunwara was nominated for two awards in the same category at the annual Filmfare Awards:\n*Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role - Govinda\n*Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role - Johnny Lever\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
