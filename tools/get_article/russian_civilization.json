In his view, Russian culture is a part of an Eastern Orthodox civilization.\n* Toynbee regarded the Russian civilization as having modest cultural achievements, but as something complete, Danilevsky and Spengler described it more as a phenomenon of the future, the latter believed that government reform of Peter the Great did not meet the traditions of a Russian civilization.\n* Plekhanov and Berdyaev believed that a Russian civilization occupies a border position between East and West. Solovyov believed that the mission of a Russian civilization in the unification of East and West, and the Eurasianists consider it as some third force.\n* Some consider communism alien to traditional Russian values, others believe that the USSR was a natural continuation of a traditional Russian civilization. Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality is similar to communist partijnost (party-mindedness, partisanship), idejnost (ideology-mindedness) and populism.\n* Researcher Rumyana Cholakova (Washington University in St. Louis) considers Russian civilization to be amalgamation of Slavic culture, Tatar culture, Finno-Ugric culture, Viking culture and the Great Steppe culture of its inhabitants. According to her, the concept of Russian soul is central to Russian civilization.\nSee also\n* Russian world\n* All-Russian nation\n* Civilizing mission\n* Culture of Russia\n* Culture of the Soviet Union\n* Russian soul\n* Russification\n* Russian imperialism\nReferences\nSources\n*"
