He was also the Councillor of Prospect Ward, a council in the City of Kew in several years.\nThe earliest he was documented as a Councillor was in a photograph (1922–1924) of several Kew Councillors, including eight who were at some point Mayor of Kew.\nIn 1924, he stood for Councillor of Prospect Ward, opposed by Michael J. Drohan.\nHe is known to have been Councillor of Prospect Ward between 1932 and 1934. He was still Councillor in 1936, where he was nominated along with Joseph Thomas Gazzard.\nIt is likely that he was Councillor of Prospect Ward consistently in the 1920s and 1930s.\nReferences"
