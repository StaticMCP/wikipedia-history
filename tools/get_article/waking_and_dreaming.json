It was released in August 1976 by Asylum Records. The album reached number 30 on Billboards Top LPs & Tape chart and spawned the singles \"Still the One\" (number five) and \"Reach\" (number 51).\nTwo non-album tracks were released as B-sides. The song \"Siam Sam\", written and sung by Wells Kelly (and co-written by Chris Myers), backed \"Still the One\" while the song \"Sweet Destiny\", another Larry Hoppen/Marilyn Mason composition sung by Larry, appeared on the single \"Reach\".\nCritical reception\n}}\nCash Box said of \"Reach\" that it \"exhibits harmonic similarities to ['Still the One'], substituting a funky beat for the shuffle.\"  Other reviewers found gospel music elements in \"Reach.\"  Record World said that it has \"an early Doobie Brothers-type sound.\"\nCash Box said of \"Spring Fever\" that \"a saxophone gets it sizzling, and sinewey pop melodies and confident harmonies from this versatile collection of musicians keep it going.\" Record World said \"With the snow melting, the temperature rising, and the days getting longer, it's time for spring fever. After coming off two successful chart records, the group is poised to herald in the season in fine style.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Orleans\n* John Hall – electric guitar  (1–4, 6, 7, 9, 10), lead vocals (1–5, 8, 9), backing vocals  (6, 7, 10) , acoustic guitar (5, 8), synthesizer (5)\n* Larry Hoppen – electric piano (1, 5, 6, 10), backing vocals (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), lead vocals (2, 4, 6, 10), electric guitar (2, 4, 6, 7), organ (1, 3, 9), synthesizer (3), clavinet (10)\n* Lance Hoppen – bass (all tracks), backing vocals (all but 8), synthesizer (8)\n* Wells Kelly – drums (1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10), backing vocals (1–4, 6, 9, 10), piano (3, 8), percussion (9), lead vocals (7), lead electric guitar (7), organ (4), tambourine (6)\n* Jerry Marotta – drums (all but 5), percussion (5, 9), congas (1), backing vocals (10)\n;additional personnel\n* Linda Ronstadt – backing vocals (3)\n* Blue Mitchell – trumpet (8)\n* Michael Brecker – saxophone (10)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1976)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|87\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
