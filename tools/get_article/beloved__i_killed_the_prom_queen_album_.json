The lack of big anthems will probably make the album uneventful for casual fans, while the heavier parts rely on the same format and almost become indistinguishable from one another.\" However, Rock Sound were very positive about the album, writing that \"Beloved is both a reincarnation of old and a lesson in modern metalcore that makes IKTPQ the oldest newcomers to stake their claim for 2014.\" Kill Your Stereo described the album as \"a bold declaration of forward momentum while doing classic I Killed the Prom Queen the way only they know how.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nI Killed the Prom Queen\n* Jamie Hope – vocals\n* Jona Weinhofen – guitar, clean vocals on \"Bright Enough\", \"Thirty One & Sevens\", \"Kjærlighet\", \"Nightmares\" and \"Sparrowhawk\", additional orchestral arrangements on \"Kjærlighet\", \"Melior\" and \"Brevity\"\n* Kevin Cameron – guitar\n* Benjamin Coyte – bass\n* Shane O'Brien – drums\nAdditional personnel\n* Bjorn \"Speed\" Strid – additional production, clean  vocals on \"Calvert Street\"\n* Ettore Rigotti – keyboard, programming and orchestral arrangements at The Metal House Studio\n* Christoffer Franzen of Lights & Motion – additional guitars, keyboard and programming on \"Beginning of the End\", \"Kjærlighet\", and \"Brevity\"\n* Randy Slaugh – live string sessions production and engineering\n* Ken Dudley at Cottonwood Studios – string sessions mixing\n* Sarah Abbott – violin\n* Doug Ferry – violin\n* Sara Bauman – violin\n* Amanda Cox – viola\n* Julie Slaugh – viola\n* Sydney Howard – viola\n* Joseph Woodward – cello\n* Isaac Hales – cello\n* Jakob Printzlau – album art\nReferences"
