      "text": "# From Scourging Rebellion\n\nby Thomas Hudson]]\nFrom Scourging Rebellion is a 1746 song composed by the German-born British George Frideric Handel.  It was composed in the wake of the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745 to celebrate Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, the younger son of the Hanoverian king George II of Great Britain. Cumberland, recalled from command of the Pragmatic Army in the Low Countries, oversaw the decisive victory over the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden on 16 April 1746. It was sung at Vauxhall Gardens on 15 May 1746.\nSee also\n* Stand Round my Brave Boys, a 1745 song by Handel\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Burrows, Donald. Handel.
