Hunyadi, together with Nicholas Újlaki, annihilated the troops of the opponents of King Vladislaus I at Bátaszék at the very beginning of 1441. Their victory effectively put an end to the Hungarian civil war. The grateful king appointed Hunyadi and his comrade joint Voivodes of Transylvania and Counts of the Székelys in February. Hunyadi also became Chief Captain of Nándorfehérvár (now Belgrade) and the ispán (head) of several southern counties of the Kingdom of Hungary, assuming responsibility for the defense of the frontiers. John Hunyadi immediately advocated for an offensive, anti-Ottoman strategy after taking control of the southern frontiers. In 1441, Hunyadi began to make raids on the Ottoman countryside in Serbia and by the Battle of Smederevo he defeated Ishak Bey, the commander of Smederevo. Hunyadi pursued Ishak Bey and his men all the way to the gates of Smederevo, killing and capturing as many of the enemy as possible along the way.\nThe operation of Hunyadi aimed to devastate the area in the same manner as Turkish raiders typically did. After three days of plundering, Hunyadi was on his way back to Belgrade when his path was blocked by the troops of Ishak Bey of Smederevo. In the ensuing clash, the Hungarian commander emerged victorious.\nBattle\nIn the summer of 1441 Ishak Bey attacked Belgrade on Sultan Murad's order.\nHe burned and destroyed anything in his path to Belgrade; that's how Hunyadi and Újlaki were able to track him.\nThe Ottomans launched the attack at the Hungarian army, but thanks to the Hungarian heavy cavalry the Ottomans were routed and were chased back to Smederevo.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle Hunyadi captured valuabe booty and important ottomans wich he then returned to Belgrade.\nThe Sultan was upset by the defeat of Ishak Bey and ordered a massive raid against Hungary. The Hungarian court was informed about the planned Ottoman invasion of March in 1442. Hunyadi had the responsibility for the defense of the southern frontiers. Before the anticipated Ottoman attack, Hunyadi mobilized the forces of the entire southeastern defensive section.\nThe Turkish raids into the Kingdom of Hungary continued intermittently over the following years, up until the crushing defeats of Ottomans in several battles in 1442.\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
