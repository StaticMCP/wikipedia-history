He specialised in the 800 metres and competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nBiography\nWarburton, born in Beverley, Yorkshire, England and originally from Caernarfon, finished fourth in the 800m at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. He has represented Great Britain on numerous occasions.\nHe was also a member of the Great Britain team at the London Olympics in 2012. He was selected as part of the Welsh squad for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, however he was suspended shortly before the start of the Games after he was charged with a violation of anti-doping rules. In January 2015 UK Anti-Doping accepted that his positive test was due to taking a contaminated supplement and that he had not knowingly cheated, and gave him a six-month suspension, which was covered by the time he had been suspended since the Commonwealth Games. He was the Welsh record holder for the 800m.\nHe was on the podium four times at the British Athletics Championships in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015.\nAchievements\n{|\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\"|Representing\n|-\n|rowspan=3|2005\n|European Indoor Championships\n|Madrid, Spain\n|bgcolor=\"silver\" | 2nd\n|4 × 400 m relay\n|3:09.53 s\n|-\n|rowspan=2|European U23 Championships\n|rowspan=2|Erfurt, Germany\n|20th (h)\n|400m\n|47.34\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|2nd\n|4 × 400 m relay\n|3:05.51\n|-\n|2011\n|European Team Championships\n|Stockholm, Sweden\n|bgcolor=\"cc9966\" | 3rd\n|800 m\n|1:46.95 s\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\"|Representing\n|-\n|2006\n|Commonwealth Games\n|Melbourne, Australia\n|5th (h)\n|400 m\n|47.31 s\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2010\n|rowspan=2|Commonwealth Games\n|rowspan=2|Delhi, India\n| 4th\n|800 m\n|1:48.59 s\n|-\n|6th\n|4 × 400 m relay\n|3:06.91 s\n|}\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.garethwarburton.com Sports Massage Therapist in Cardiff]"
