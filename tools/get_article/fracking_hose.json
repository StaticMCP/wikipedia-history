Additional water is used when wells are refractured; this may be done several times.\nHose materials\nThe traditional solution is to use metal pipes to transfer water but these are costly to deliver and assemble. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) covered hoses and Nitrile rubber (NBR) covered hoses have a lot of advantages compared to metal pipes. It is easy to deliver, assemble and disassemble hoses and long sections of NBR- and TPU-covered hoses reduce the possibility of leakage in connecting parts. These large-diameter NBR- and TPU-covered hoses are called fracking hoses.\nHose selection\nFracking hoses are high-pressure, high-strength lay-flat hoses designed for pumping aggressive water around mine sites. Safety and efficiency are important factors when choosing products for these applications.\nHistory\nFracking hoses are solutions derived from the fire hose industries. The fire hose manufacturers manufacture NBR or TPU covered hoses for fire fighting, water discharge, irrigation etc. The fracking industries borrowed the idea from the fire hose industries and use these hoses in fracking.\nReferences"
