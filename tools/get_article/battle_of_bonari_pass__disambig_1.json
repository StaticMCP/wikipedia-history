The Bonari pass was a strategic access at the limit of the fief of Aizu.\nThe battle was between a mixed force of 800 troops – including former shogunate soldiers (Denshūtai and Shinsengumi) led by Ōtori Keisuke and Hijikata Toshizō, Aizu forces, and soldiers of various northern domains — against a much larger number of troops favourable to the Imperial government.\nItagaki Taisuke led his troops, by some estimates numbering as many as 3,000, in a rapid strike against forces defending Aizuwakamatsu Castle. Heading southwest from Nihonmatsu, Itagaki then took a route across Bonari Pass northwards to cross into Aizu.\nOutnumbered, the shogunal troops had to retreat to the North to Sendai, where the fleet of Enomoto Takeaki was ready to evacuate them to Hokkaidō. This left Aizu exposed, and facilitated the imperial advance.\nThree days later, the Imperial troops reached the castle of Wakamatsu and laid siege to it, in the key action of the Battle of Aizu.\nGallery\nReferences"
