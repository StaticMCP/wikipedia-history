He also was known as Hōkō-in Daijin and Higashi-sanjō-dono.\nCareer\nKaneie served as a minister during the reigns of Emperor En'yū, Emperor Kazan and Emperor Ichijō.\nAfter his rival brother Kanemichi's death in 977 he was appointed to Udaijin by his cousin Yoritada who became Kampaku after Kanemichi's death. He and his son Michikane encouraged Emperor Kazan to abdicate to accelerate Kaneie's accession to regent. Kaneie told Kazan that the Imperial Regalia was already held by Ichijo, and hence Kazan should not continue as ruler. Kazan acquiesced to Kaneie's demands, under some pressure, and went to the Gangyō-ji monastery. Kaneie's second son, Michikane, went with Kazan; he intended to also take the tonsure. When they arrived at the monastery, Michikane claimed that he would like to see his parents as a layman for the last time - he did not return. When Emperor Ichijo succeeded, Kaneie became Sesshō of Emperor Ichijō.\n* 969 (Anna 1): Ju Sammi (従三位)\n* 970 (Anna 2): Chūnagon\n* 972 (Tenroku 3, 11th month): Kaneie was promoted from the office of Chūnagon to Dainagon\n* 978 (Jōgen 3, 10th month): Kaneie was named Udaijin.\n* 986 (Kanna 2, 24th day of the 6th month): Sesshō (摂政) for Emperor Ichijō\n* 986 (Kanna 2, 20th day of the 7th month): retire from Udaijin\n* 989 (Eiso 1, 12th month): Kaneie is named daijō daijin.\n* 990 (Shōryaku 1, 5th month): Kaneie fell seriously ill; and he abandoned his offices to become a Buddhist monk.\n* July 26, 990 (Shōryaku 1, 2nd day of the 7th month): Kaneie died at the age of 62.\nFamily\nKaneie had four brothers:  Kanemichi,  Kinsue, Koretada, and Tamemitsu.\n* Father: Fujiwara no Morosuke (藤原師輔, 909–960)\n* Mother: Fujiwara no Moriko (藤原盛子, ?–943), daughter of  (藤原経邦).\n** Wife: Fujiwara no Tokihime (藤原時姫, ?–980), daughter of Fujiwara no Nakamasa (藤原中正).\n*** 1st son: Fujiwara no Michitaka (藤原道隆, 953–995), Sesshō and Kampaku of Emperor Ichijō.\n*** 3rd son: Fujiwara no Michikane (藤原道兼, 961–995), Kampaku of Emperor Ichijō.\n*** 5th son: Fujiwara no Michinaga (藤原道長, 966–1028), Kampaku of Emperor Go-Ichijō.\n*** 1st daughter: Fujiwara no Chōshi (藤原超子, 954?-982), consort of Emperor Reizei and mother of Emperor Sanjō.\n*** 2nd daughter: Fujiwara no Senshi (藤原詮子, 962–1002), consort of Emperor En'yū and mother of Emperor Ichijō.\n** Wife: known as Udaisyō Michitsuna no Haha (Mother of Udaishō Michitsuna) (右大将道綱母, 936?-995).
