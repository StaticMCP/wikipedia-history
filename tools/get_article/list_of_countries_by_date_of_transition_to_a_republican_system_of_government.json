      "text": "# List of countries by date of transition to a republican system of government\n\nThis is a list of countries by date of their last transition from a monarchy to a republican form of government. There were two periods in recent history when many such transitions took place:\n* during or within five years after World War I (1914–1923) &ndash; marked in green;\n* during or within five years after World War II (1939–1950) &ndash; marked in pink.\nSome of the countries on this list were part of larger, now extinct, states (such as the Russian Empire or Yugoslavia) when the transition to a republic took place. Countries that have always had non-republican forms of government (such as absolute monarchy, theocracy, etc.) are not included in this list. Some were also independent states that shared their head of state with other countries (such as Denmark or the United Kingdom) before abolishing the link with the shared monarchy. Countries marked in yellow have since ceased to be republics in favour of another form of government.\nList of countries/Regions\n;Legend:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\" width=\"930\"\n! style=\" Transition\n! style=\"background: #ddddff;\"| Remarks\n|-\n! style=\"background: #FFCD00;\"| Vaishali\n|Circa 623&nbsp;BC\n|The Vajjika League of Vrijji mahajanapada in modern-day Bihar in India was established here prior to the birth of Gautama Buddha which happened in Lumbini in 623BC.

Later succeeded by the monarchical Roman Empire following the proclamation of Gaius Octavius as Augustus on 16 January 27 BC and subsequent constitutional reforms. In 395 AD the empire would split in two permanently. The Western Roman Empire became an extinct state in 476 AD. The Eastern Roman Empire, called the Byzantine Empire by later historians, continued until 1453 when Ottoman forces conquered the city of Constantinople.\n|-----\n!San Marino\n|3 September 301\n|Republic founded for San Marino (traditional date)\n|-----\n!Novgorod Republic, Russia\n|1136\n|The Novgorod Republic, formally known as Lord Novgorod the Great, was a city-state that existed from the 12th to 15th centuries in northwestern Russia, stretching from the Gulf of Finland in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east. Its capital was the city of Novgorod. The republic prospered as the easternmost trading post of the Hanseatic League, and its people were much influenced by the culture of the Byzantines, with the Novgorod school of icon painting producing many fine works. For much of its history, Novgorod was the center of Russian art and culture.\n|-----\n! style=\"background: #FFCD00;\"| Poland\n| rowspan=2 |\n| rowspan=2 | Establishment of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as a result of the Union of Lublin. Poland-Lithuania was often referred to as a republic under the presidency of the King, having a King who reigns and does not rule and the Parliament being responsible for governance. In Polish, the Commonwealth is known as the First Polish Republic (), or literally as the Republic of Both Nations (), whilst formally being the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania (). The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth came to an end in 1796, with the Third Partition of Poland.\n|-----\n!  style=\"background: #FFCD00;\"| Lithuania\n|-\n! style=\"background: #FFCD00;\"| Netherlands\n|\n| The Republic of the Seven United Netherlands declared its independence from King Philip II of Spain on 26 July 1581, with the Act of Abjuration, and became the Batavian Republic in 1795.

The regency became a de faco independent military republic, with power initially concentrated in the Agha, who served as the president of the diwan. From 1671 onward, authority was vested in the Dey of Algiers. Algeria was legally a territory of the Ottoman Empire, but in practice it acted as an independent country in relation to Constantinople. In 1830, Algeria was conquered by the Kingdom of France as a constituent territory.\n|-----\n! United States\n|\n|On July 4, 1776, Thirteen British Colonies in North America declared its independence (and therefore also its separation) from the Kingdom of Great Britain. In March 1, 1781, these 13 states officially organized itselves in a Confederation. Great Britain only recognized the independence of the United States of America and its territorial loss in September 3, 1783.

During the Revolution, the French Monarchy was overthrown and a National Convention established.

After several changes to the governance of the Republic it came to an end in 1804 when Napoleon was declared Emperor of the French and the First French Empire was established.\n|-----\n! style=\"background: #FFCD00;\"| Colombia (New Granada)\n|\n| On 20 July 1811, the New Kingdom of Granada declared its independence (and therefore also its separation) from the Kingdom of Spain, forming the United Provinces of New Granada, a republican state. The Bogotá Province decided to not join the new country and declared itself the Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca, a monarchical state that still recognized the authority of the king of Spain. On 3 September 1816 Venezuela is reconquered by the Spanish Empire, which reestablishes the New Kingdom of Granada.\n|-----\n! style=\"background: #FFCD00;\"| Venezuela\n|\n| On 5 July 1811, the Captaincy General of Venezuela declared its independence (and therefore also its separation) from the Kingdom of Spain, forming the First Republic of Venezuela.

On 9 July 1816 the country declared itself an independent republic in relation to the Kingdom of Spain due to the refusal of King Ferdinand VII to accept constitutional rule both in the Peninsula (Spain) and overseas. Republican constitutions of 1819 and 1826 led to the adoption of the 1853 text. The Kingdom of Spain only recognized the independence of Argentina on July 9, 1859.\n|-----\n!Venezuela\n|\n| Third Republic of Venezuela established by Simon Bolivar. The Republic ended, after the Congress of Angostura of 1819 decreed the union of Venezuela with New Granada, to form the Republic of Gran Colombia.

In May 1822, Agostín de Iturbide was acclaimed Emperor, with the title of Agostín I. However, relations with Congress deteriorated, and the monarch ordered its closure in late October of that year, beginning to govern through a junta, which caused him to lose popularity among the elite and the military. The republic was proclaimed and the emperor was forced to resign and go into exile. He returned to Mexico in 1824, but was arrested and executed shortly thereafter.\n|-----\n! Costa Rica\n| rowspan=5 |\n| rowspan=5 |Independence of United Provinces of Central America. After Central America (then the Captaincy General of Guatemala) declared its independence from the Kingdom of Spain in September 1821, it was annexed by the First Mexican Empire in January 1822 before regaining its independence and forming a federal republic in 1823. The republic descended into civil wars from 1827 to 1829 and from 1838 to 1840, by the end of which the states of Central America declared independence as new republics and the federal republic ceased to exist. The Kingdom of Spain recognized the independence of these countries only in the 1850s (Costa Rica and Nicaragua), 1860s (Guatemala and El Salvador) and in the 1890s (Honduras).\n|-----\n!

San Martín left Peru on 22 September 1822, and left the independence movement's command to Bolívar. Constituent Congress founded the republic.
