A specimen at the Arborvillage Nursery was less than  after 3 years.\nFile:Ulmus pumila 'Dwarf Weeper' - Grange Farm arboretum. 2017-08-12.jpg|'Dwarf Weeper' at Grange Farm Arboretum\nPests and diseases\nThe species and its cultivars are highly resistant, but not immune, to Dutch elm disease, and unaffected by the Elm Leaf Beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola.\nCultivation\nRestricted to North America; the only known introduction to Europe, is at the Grange Farm Arboretum, England.\nPutative specimen\nA notably pendulous small-leaved elm in the JC Raulston Arboretum, Raleigh, North Carolina (2019), labelled Ulmus minor subsp. minor 'Pendula', 'Weeping small-leaved elm', has U. pumila-type fruit and is indistinguishable in leaf and form from U. pumila 'Dwarf Weeper'.
