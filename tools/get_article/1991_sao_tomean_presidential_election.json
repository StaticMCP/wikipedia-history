The MLSTP-PSD had called for voters to boycott the election.\nTrovoada was sworn in as the second president of São Tomé and Príncipe on 3 April.\nCandidates\nThree candidates stated their intention to participate in the contest; Miguel Trovoada, a former Prime Minister running as an independent (with the support of both the PCD-GR and CODO), Monso dos Santos of the Christian Democratic Front (FDC) and Guadalupe de Ceita, an independent candidate. Manuel Pinto da Costa, President since independence in 1975, declared that he would not be contesting the election and that he would retire from politics. The MLSTP-PSD did not present an alternative candidate.\nIn February, less than a month before the election, both Monso dos Santos and Guadalupe de Ceita withdrew from the elections, leaving Trovoada as the sole candidate.\nResults\nReferences"
