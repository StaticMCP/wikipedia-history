Five or six winners were chosen from the entire year's production of BBC drama, and published in a series of books. They were named after Giles Cooper, the Anglo-Irish radio dramatist who wrote over sixty scripts for BBC radio and television between 1949 and 1966.\nThese awards ran annually between 1978 and 1992, instigated by Richard Imison at the BBC and Geoffrey Strachan at Eyre Methuen. There was no prize money, but publication was a notable mark of permanence in the ephemeral world of broadcasting.\nList of winners\n1978\n*John Arden – Pearl (published separately as per special arrangement with Eyre Methuen)\n* Richard Harris – Is It Something I Said?\n* Don Haworth – Episode on a Thursday Evening\n* Jill Hyem – Remember Me\n* Tom Mallin – Halt!
