The authority is responsible for reviving the city's architectural legacy and ensuring the maintenance of ancient buildings and cultural landmarks, particularly in Old Lahore.\nHistory and formation\nThe LAHR was formed following a high-level meeting jointly chaired by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Nawaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on 16 March 2025. The meeting focused on the deteriorating condition of Lahore's historical sites due to urban encroachments and neglect.\nNawaz Sharif, appointed patron-in-chief of the authority's steering committee, emphasized the importance of restoring Lahore's original cultural identity and compared the city's potential to that of European cities that have preserved their historical architecture over centuries.\nObjectives and key initiatives\nThe Lahore Authority for Heritage Revival (LAHR) aims to preserve and restore Lahore’s historic and cultural legacy through a combination of conservation, urban planning, and infrastructure development. Key objectives include:\n* Restoration of historical sites, including Mughal-era gates and colonial-era buildings.\n* Systematic removal of encroachments from heritage locations, with compensation and relocation plans for affected businesses.\n* Zoning Lahore into six heritage zones for organized restoration work.\n* Installation of plaques at the former residences of literary figures like Saadat Hasan Manto and Shorish Kashmiri.\n* Development of supporting infrastructure, such as underground parking and pedestrian walkways, to preserve historic aesthetics and reduce congestion.\nAs of mid-2025, restoration is underway on 48 of 75 colonial buildings, while five locations have been identified for underground parking. Major sites like Bhati Gate, Shalimar Garden, and Shahdara Complex are also included in the revival plan.\nKey sites under restoration\n* Shalimar Gardens, Lahore\n* Tomb of Jahangir and Tomb of Nur Jahan\n* Lahore Fort\n* Baradari of Kamran Mirza\n* Circular Road and surrounding areas\nLeadership\n* Patron-in-Chief: Nawaz Sharif\n* Chief Minister of Punjab: Maryam Nawaz (provides executive oversight and coordination)\nFunding and development projects\nIn June 2025, the Punjab government approved a budget allocation of Rs635 million for the Lahore Authority for Heritage Revival (LAHR) as part of the 2025–26 fiscal year budget. The funding supports both ongoing and new heritage restoration initiatives under the patronage of PML-N President Nawaz Sharif.\nA sum of Rs200 million was earmarked for the ongoing infrastructure improvement and façade rehabilitation project spanning from Delhi Gate, Lahore to Akbari Gate in the historic Walled City of Lahore, with the total cost of that project estimated at Rs999.610 million.\nAdditionally, Rs435 million was allocated for 13 new projects with a combined estimated cost of Rs6.277 billion. These include:\n* Preservation and restoration of the Shahdara Complex of Monuments (Phase II)\n* Conservation of Lahore Fort (additional substituted works)\n* Reconstruction of sections of the old fortified wall inside the Walled City\n* Restoration of Shalimar Gardens, Lahore\n* Revitalization of historic zones, including New and Old Anarkali Bazaar, Jain Mandir, Paan Gali, Bakhshi Market, and Bible Society areas\n* Underground parking development adjacent to Tolinton Market and Neela Gumbad Area\n* Restoration of cultural landmarks around Neela Gumbad, King Edward Medical University, Pak Tea House, and Ewing Hall\n* Urban improvements near Nasir Bagh, University of the Punjab, and Government College University, Lahore\n* Reconstruction of four historic gates: Yakki Gate, Shah Alam Gate, Taxali Gate, and Mochi Gate\nThese initiatives are part of a broader strategy to enhance Lahore's cultural landscape while modernizing urban infrastructure in and around the heritage sites.\nControversy and opposition\nThe Lahore Authority for Heritage Revival project has faced strong opposition from the business community, particularly traders operating in the Circular Road and Shah Alam Market areas. On 9 April 2025, representatives of the Circular Road Markets Board and Anjuman-e-Tajiran protested at the Lahore Press Club, rejecting the project over fears it would displace around 7,000 shops and disrupt an estimated Rs5 trillion in business across 23 markets.\nTraders accused the Punjab government of launching the initiative without stakeholder consultation, warning that eviction notices threaten the livelihoods of over 70,000 families. They asserted their businesses, operating on government-owned land for generations, are not encroachments but part of Lahore's economic backbone. Leaders demanded the formation of a commission with trader representation and warned of continued protests if their concerns remain unaddressed.\nSee also\n* Walled City of Lahore Authority\n* Lahore Fort\n* Heritage conservation in Pakistan\nReferences"
