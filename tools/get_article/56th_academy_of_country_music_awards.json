The evening was co-hosted by Keith Urban and Mickey Guyton. The ceremony involved no ticketed audience due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but featured a limited number of health care workers.\nBackground\nOn March 11, 2021, CBS announced that the ceremony would be co-hosted by Keith Urban and Mickey Guyton. With her involvement, Guyton became the first African-American female, and second African-American overall, to host the ceremony, after Charley Pride, who co-hosted the ceremony in 1984. The full list of performers were announced on April 5, 2021, which included a record four Black artists.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show followed a similar format to the 55th ceremony, utilizing several locations and including a mix of live and pre-recorded performances. As with the 55th ceremony, presentations took place at the Grand Ole Opry House, Ryman Auditorium, and the Bluebird Café, while performances were also held at The Station Inn, Lower Broadway, and the Cumberland River.  Unlike the previous ceremony, a limited number of health care workers were also invited to attend the components of the ceremony at the Grand Ole Opry House and Ryman Auditorium, seated on the balconies (while the main floors were used to seat rotating groups of nominees).\nOn February 3, 2021, the ACM announced that Morgan Wallen would be ineligible to receive nominations or be involved with the ceremony, amid criticism of Wallen over a video that depicted him using a racial slur. The ACM stated that it \"does not condone or support intolerance or behavior that doesn't align with our commitment and dedication to diversity and inclusion.\" The nominees were announced on February 21, 2021, with Miranda Lambert, Maren Morris and Chris Stapleton leading with four nods each.\nWinners and nominees\nAll nominees are listed below, and the winners are listed in bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85;\" width=\"50%\" |Entertainer of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85;\" width=\"50%\" |Album of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Luke Bryan\n** Eric Church\n** Luke Combs\n** Thomas Rhett\n** Chris Stapleton\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Starting Over – Chris Stapleton'\n** Born Here Live Here Die Here – Luke Bryan\n** Mixtape Vol. 1 – Kane Brown\n** Never Will – Ashley McBryde\n** Skeletons – Brothers Osborne\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Female Artist of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Male Artist of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Maren Morris\n**Kelsea Ballerini\n** Miranda Lambert\n** Ashley McBryde\n** Carly Pearce\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Thomas Rhett\n** Dierks Bentley\n** Eric Church\n** Luke Combs\n** Chris Stapleton\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Group of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Duo of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Old Dominion\n** Lady A\n** Little Big Town\n** The Cadillac Three\n** The Highwomen\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Dan + Shay\n** Brooks & Dunn\n** Brothers Osborne\n** Florida Georgia Line\n** Maddie & Tae\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Single of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Song of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* '''\"I Hope You're Happy Now\" – Carly Pearce and Lee Brice\n**\"Bluebird\" – Miranda Lambert\n** \"I Hope\" – Gabby Barrett\n** \"More Hearts Than Mine\" – Ingrid Andress\n** \"The Bones\" – Maren Morris\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* \"The Bones\" – Jimmy Robbins, Maren Morris, Laura Veltz\n**\"Bluebird\" – Luke Dick, Miranda Lambert, Natalie Hemby\n** \"One Night Standards\" – Ashley McBryde, Nicolette Hayford, Shane McAnally\n** \"Some People Do\" – Jesse Frasure, Matt Ramsey, Thomas Rhett, Shane McAnally\n** \"Starting Over\" – Chris Stapleton, Mike Henderson\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |New Female Artist of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |New Male Artist of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Gabby Barrett\n**Ingrid Andress\n** Tenille Arts\n** Mickey Guyton\n** Caylee Hammack\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Jimmie Allen\n** Travis Denning\n** Hardy\n** Cody Johnson\n** Parker McCollum\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Songwriter of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Video of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Hillary Lindsey\n** Ashley Gorley\n** Michael Hardy\n** Shane McAnally\n** Josh Osborne\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* \"Worldwide Beautiful\" – Kane Brown; Dir.
