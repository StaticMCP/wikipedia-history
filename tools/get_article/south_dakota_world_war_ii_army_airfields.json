However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Mitchell AAF/MAP, Mitchell\n: 353d Army Air Force Base Unit (Det)\n: Now: Mitchell Municipal Airport\n* Pierre AAF, Pierre\n: 353d Army Air Force Base Unit (Det)\n: Now: Pierre Regional Airport\nSecond Air Force\n* Rapid City AAB, Rapid City\n: 353d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Rapid City Air Field (1947)\n: Was: Weaver Air Force Base (1948)\n: Was: Rapid City Air Force Base (1948-1953)\n: Now:  Ellsworth Air Force Base (1953-Present)\n* Sioux Falls AAF, Sioux Falls\n: 335th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Sioux Falls Regional Airport / Joe Foss Field /  Joe Foss Field Air National Guard Station\nPersonnel Distribution Command\n* Watertown AAF, Watertown\n: 353d Army Air Force Base Unit (Det)\n: Now: Watertown Regional Airport\nArmy Air Force Training Command\n* Aberdeen AAF, Aberdeen\n: Contract Flying School\n: Now: Aberdeen Regional Airport\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
