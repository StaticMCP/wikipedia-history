The outnumbered Austrians were defeated but in an accidental encounter, MacDonald was painfully wounded by two saber cuts. The action occurred during the War of the Second Coalition, part of a larger conflict known as the French Revolutionary Wars. Modena is a city in northern Italy about  northwest of Bologna.\nIn the battles of Magnano and Cassano, the Austrians and allied Russian Empire forces swept the French from much of northern Italy in April 1799. MacDonald collected the French occupying forces in south and central Italy into an army and marched north to retrieve the situation. Bursting out of the Apennine Mountains, the French divisions of Jean-Baptiste Olivier and François Watrin mauled Hohenzollern's division at Modena. MacDonald swung west to fight the Coalition forces. The next action would be the Battle of the Trebbia (1799) from 17 to 19 June.\nSee also\n* Capture of Brescia\n* Battle of Cassano\n* Battle of Bassignana\n* First Battle of Marengo\n* Battle of the Trebbia\n* Second Battle of Marengo\n* Battle of Novi\nReferences\n*\n*"
