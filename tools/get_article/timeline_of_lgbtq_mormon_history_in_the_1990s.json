Although the historical record is often scarce, evidence points to queer individuals having existed in the Mormon community since its beginnings. However, top LDS leaders only started regularly addressing queer topics in public in the late 1950s. Since 1970, the LDS Church has had at least one official publication or speech from a high-ranking leader referencing LGBT topics every year, and a greater number of LGBT Mormon and former Mormon individuals have received media coverage.\nTimeline\n1990\n\" pamphlet called homosexuality an abomination.]]\n* 1990 – The church published a version of the \"For the Strength of Youth\" pamphlet which contained its first explicit mention of homosexuality.

It continues \"homosexual and lesbian activities are sinful and an abomination to the Lord\" and \"unnatural affections ... toward persons of the same gender are counter to God's eternal plan\".\n* April – The church distributed the booklet \"Keys to Understanding Homosexuality\" to its LDS Social Services employees which contained twenty-five suggestions to help male homosexual clients such as discouraging them from coming out of the closet, increasing their hope for changing their attractions, and helping them dress and act heterosexual.\n* October – The first Utah pride march was held.

The six-page booklet states, \"There is a distinction between immoral thoughts and feelings and participating in ... homosexual behavior. However, such thoughts and feelings, regardless of their causes can and should be overcome and sinful behavior should be eliminated.\" It further advised, \"members can overcome these problems by turning to the Lord.\" \"In some cases, heterosexual feelings emerge leading to happy, eternal marriage relationships.\" The pamphlet did not frame homosexuality as a disease corresponding to the recent change by the World Health Organization removing homosexuality as a mental disorder.

Condie calls \"homosexual tendencies\" an unclean \"addictive behavior\" that the man in the story developed \"gradually\" after being \"introduced\" to it \"in his early youth\" after which he had \"relationships\" which brought him \"misery\".

The manual cites \"the roots of lesbianism\" as \"a dysfunctional family relationship\" and/or \"physical, sexual and emotional abuse\" which causes women to \"have a tendency to develop overly dependent or enmeshed emotional relationships\".

Faust gave a First Presidency member message in the September Ensign in which he denies any biological or \"inherited\" components in the etiology of homosexuality citing \"no scientific evidence\" supporting the \"false belief of inborn homosexual orientation\" leading to \"so-called alternative lifestyles\". He continued that if there was an inherited or inborn aspect to homosexuality it would \"frustrate the whole plan of mortal happiness\" and deny \"the opportunity to change\" leading to \"discouragement, disappointment, and despair\". The article also stated that same-sex relationships would also help \"unravel the fabric of human society\" and if practiced by everyone would \"mean the end of the human family\".\n* September – \"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\" was read on September 23, 1995, at the Relief Society General Conference meeting by Gordon B. Hinckley. The document states that \"marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God\" and \"is essential to His eternal plan\". It also teaches that everyone is a \"spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents\" and \"gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose\". It has been submitted by the church in amicus briefs as evidence against court cases which could legalize same-sex marriages.\n* October – Gordon B. Hinckley gave an October General Conference talk in which he states that \"same-sex marriage\" is an \"immoral practic[e]\" though he says that members of the churth \"reach out\" their hearts \"to those who struggle with feelings of affinity for the same gender\" and \"remember\" them, \"sympathize with\" them, and regard them as brothers and sisters.\n* October – Church Seventy Durrel A.

He says members should encourage those with AIDS to participate in church activities. He also seems to contradict Faust's address from a month earlier by giving a nuanced view on potential biological components of the etiology of homosexuality stating \"some kinds of feelings seem to be inborn\" while others \"seem to be acquired from a complex interaction of 'nature and nurture,\". He continues, \"the feelings ... that increase susceptibility to certain behavior may have some relationship to inheritance\". However, Oaks discourages members from calling themselves or other people lesbian or gay saying, \"we should refrain from using [gay and lesbian] as nouns to identify specific persons. Our religious doctrine dictates this usage. It is wrong to use these words to denote a condition.\"\n1996\n* 1996 – Previously excommunicated Mormon historian D.

Four-hundred of Salt Lake's high school students protested the ban. One Mormon senior at East High was quoted stating that he would rather all clubs be banned than allow the gay-straight alliance. Additionally, Mormon state representative Grant Protzman stated \"I think that many legislators have serious concerns about the group’s moving into recruitment of fresh meat for the gay population.\" Club founder Peterson responded that recruitment was not at all what the club is about, stating that it was founded to help her and her LGBT friends deal with a hostile school atmosphere where she faced physical and verbal assault as an out lesbian. In response to the gay-straight alliance group, some students at West High formed the Student Against Faggots Everywhere (SAFE) group.\n* July – BYU Spanish professor Thomas Matthews was reported to a top LDS authority for previously stating that he was gay in private conversations.

In it the author who was married to a woman discussed his struggle with \"same-gender attraction\" calling it a \"trial\", \"weakness\", \"impure thought\", \"temptation\", and \"misguided feeling\" caused by \"longing for true brotherly love or a desire for masculine characteristics\".

Hafen presented at the World Congress of Families in the Czech Republic.

Hinckley, president of the church, gave an interview in April in which he stated \"we have gays in the church. Good people.\" He continued saying that no action is taken against them unless they're involved in sexual transgression, in which case there are \"certain penalties\" same as with \"heterosexuals\". He reaffirmed the stance that God made marriage for one man and one woman and that essentially gay people must live a \"celibate life\".\n* July – General authorities Marlin Jensen, Loren Dunn, and Richard Wirthlin gave recommendations to the church Public Affairs Committee that the church's priesthood structure could be used to gather 70% of the required 700,000 signatures and raise up to $2 million to place an anti-same-sex-marriage ballot on California's June 1998 primary election.\n* November – The church Seventy Jay E.

McKinney would later state \"The night I did it, I did have hatred for homosexuals\" and that he target Shepard because \"he was obviously gay. That played a part. His weakness. His frailty.\" Mormon congregations joined other Laramie denominations in including Shepard's family in their prayers. Rulon Stacey, the LDS CEO of the Colorado hospital where Shepard died, became caught in the ensuing media storm and later stated that he received hate mail for expressing grief and support over a gay murder victim and his family. In The Laramie Project play about the murder, there are parts with an LDS stake leader and LDS home teachers to the family of one of Shepard's killers.\n1999\n* May – The Area Presidency of the North America West Area, composed of Area Seventies, sent a letter to all area leaders directing a letter to be read in all California sacrament meeting which directed members to \"do all you can by donating your means and time\" to ensure that Proposition 22 (known as the Knight Initiative) passed. This act restricted marriage recognition in California to that between a man and a woman denying homosexual or same-sex couples legal recognition of their unions. A follow-up letter directed to stake presidents from Area Seventy Douglas L. Callister on May 20 assigned them to invite church members to donate money to the \"Defense of Marriage Committee\" in order to pass Prop 22.

He further asserted that individuals can \"diminish homosexual attraction\" and that \"when homosexual difficulties have been fully resolved, heterosexual feelings can emerge\". In support of this he stated \"many individuals who have experienced homosexual difficulties have\" had their \"burdens\" or \"trial\" \"lifted through the Lord’s grace.\" The article continued acknowledging that those who desire to diminish their \"homosexual urgings\" may \"experience extreme pain because of the extensive changes that are required\" including \"changing one’s thoughts ... friendships ... or even clothing styles\".\n* October – Church president Hinckley stated in general conference that, \"so-called same-sex marriage ... is not a matter of civil rights; it is a matter of morality. ...
