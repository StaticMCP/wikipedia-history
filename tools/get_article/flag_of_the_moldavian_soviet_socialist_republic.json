This was the SSR's second flag, adopted on 31 January 1952.\nThe SSR's first flag was in use from 1940 to 1952. In 1990, the Romanian tricolor was briefly the SSR's flag before what would become the coat of arms of Moldova was added to the center. The resulting flag was retained when Moldova declared its independence the following year, in 1991.\nThe unrecognized state of Transnistria, which broke away from the rest of Moldova in 1990, retained the (second) flag of the Moldavian SSR and still uses it to this day.\nHistory\nMoldavian ASSR\nBetween 1924 and 1940, part of Moldova was organized as the Moldavian ASSR within the Ukrainian SSR. A red flag, with the gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner, above the Cyrillic characters УРСР (Ukrainian initials of Ukrainian SSR) and the Latin characters RSSU (Moldovan initials of Ukrainian SSR in Latin script) was adopted in 1938. The Moldovan text on the flag was later changed to PCCУ (Moldovan initials of Ukrainian SSR in Cyrillic script).\n|File:Flag of Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.svg|Flag of the Moldavian ASSR (1938–1940)\n}}\nMoldavian SSR\nIn 1940, a red flag with the gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner, with the Cyrillic characters РССМ (Moldovan initials of Moldavian SSR in Cyrillic script) above them in gold in a serif font was adopted for the newly founded Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nOn 31 January 1952, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR \"On the approval of the draft of the new State Flag of the Moldavian SSR\" approved the following description of a new flag:\n}}\nFlag of the Moldavian SSR (1940–1952)\n|Flag of Moldavian SSR.svg| Flag of the Moldavian SSR (1952–1990)\n|1960 CPA 2460.jpg|Flag of the Moldavian SSR on a 1960 stamp}}\nWith perestroika in force, the Moldovan nationalism came in place with the Popular Front of Moldova being involved. On 27 April 1990, the new flag of the Moldavian SSR consisted of the Romanian tricolor with the emblem of the Moldavian SSR in the center. However, it was decided to use the flag without the emblem until new symbols were worked on. When the Moldavian SSR declared sovereignty in June 1990, this new flag was adopted on 6 November 1990 and was used as the flag of Moldova until 2010, when it was slightly modified.\nUnofficial flag of the Moldavian SSR (1990, early prototype)\n|File:Flag of Moldavian SSR (1990) (Soviet colors).png| Flag of the Moldavian SSR (1990)\n|Flag of Moldova (1990–2010).svg| Flag of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (1990–1991)\n}}\nUse in Transnistria\nThe breakaway Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (PMSSR) retained the 1952 flag when it declared its separation from the Moldavian SSR on 2 September 1990. On 5 November 1991, the PMSSR dropped \"Soviet Socialist\" from its name, becoming the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR), commonly known in English as Transnistria. The former flag of the Moldavian SSR was officially adopted by the internationally unrecognized state as its state flag on 18 July 2000.\nSee also\n* Coat of arms of the Moldavian SSR\n* Flag of the Socialist Republic of Romania\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/su-md_h.html Flag of Moldavian SSR at www.crwflags.com (1)]\n*[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/su-md.html Flag of Moldavian SSR at www.crwflags.com (2)]\n*[http://www.vexillographia.ru/moldova/mssr.htm Flag of Moldavian SSR at www.vexillographia.ru] (in Russian)"
