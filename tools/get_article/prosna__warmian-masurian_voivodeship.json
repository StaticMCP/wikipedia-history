It lies approximately  north-west of Korsze,  north-west of Kętrzyn, and  north-east of the regional capital Olsztyn.\nHistory\n]]\nThe village was first mentioned in 1376 by Winrich von Kniprode as property of the Leunenburg family. In 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region into the Kingdom of Poland. After the subsequent Thirteen Years' War (1454–1466), it was a part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Order. In 1490 Barbara von Leunenburg married Botho von Eulenburg and the village from then on remained the property of the von Eulenburg family until 1945.\nThe palace was initially built in 1610–1620 and restructured by the Polish brethren Józef Naronowicz-Naroński in 1667–68. A last major reconstruction happened in the 1860s in Neogothic style; the tower was added in 1875. The palace was not destroyed throughout World War II but is ruined today.\nReferences"
