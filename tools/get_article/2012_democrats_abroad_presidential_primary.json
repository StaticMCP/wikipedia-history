Incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama was unopposed in the Global Primary, but the worldwide Global Primary results helped to choose 11 of Democrats Abroad's 25 delegates to the 2012 Democratic National Convention as well as established the weighting for subsequent votes at the Democrats Abroad Global Convention.\nAdditional votes were held to fill delegate, alternate, page, and standing-committee positions held during the Democrats Abroad Global Convention in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, from May 18–20, 2012. The delegation to the Democratic National Convention included the 11 delegates selected in the Global Primary, 4 more delegates and 1 alternate selected at the Democrats Abroad Global Convention, Democrats Abroad's 8 DNC members, 3 Standing Committee members, and 1 page.\nResults\nPrimary\nPrimary dates: May 1–6, 2012\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:right;\"\n!   colspan=\"4\" | Democrats Abroad global presidential primary, 2012\n|-\n!   style=\"width: 17em\"|Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\"|Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\"|Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\"|National delegate votes\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Barack Obama\n| 2,709\n| 99.09%\n| 19\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Uncommitted\n| 25\n| 0.91%\n| 0\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" style=\"margin-right:0.5em\"\n| Totals\n|2,734\n|100.00%\n|19\n|}\nSee also\n* Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2012\nReferences"
