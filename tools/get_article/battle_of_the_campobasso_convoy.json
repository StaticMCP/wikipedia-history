The Italians were escorting the  freighter Campobasso to Tunisia.\nThe ships were illuminated by star shells, east of Kelibia in Cape Bon; Perseo attacked the British ships with torpedoes then turned to the north-west. Campobasso exploded under the British bombardment, that, with more star shells, lit up Perseo, which was severely damaged, sinking an hour later. The 93 crew of Campobasso suffered 73 killed, and of 133 crew on Perseo, 83 survived.\nBackground\nAs the North Africa campaign neared its conclusion, the destroyers  and  of Force K patrolled the waters off Cape Bon. On the night of 29/30 April, the destroyers made a sweep along the south coast of Sicily and encountered the merchant ship Fauna () escorted by German E-boats. The British destroyers sank Fauna without loss.\nPrelude\nA few days later, alerted by signals intelligence, Nubian, Paladin and , were sent to wait in ambush for an Italian convoy. The Italian merchant ship Campobasso (3,566 GRT) had left Pantelleria island at 19:00 on 3 May, loaded with bombs, land-mines, motor transport and other supplies to the Axis forces in Tunisia. The merchant ship was joined by its escort, the  (Captain Saverio Marotta) soon after departure.\nThe two ships undertook a winding course through the Axis and Allied minefields. On the night of 3/4 May off Kelibia on the Cape Bon peninsula, the British destroyers picked up radar contacts of vessels heading towards the Tunisian coast. Perseo, equipped with a Metox radar detector, was alerted to the transmissions from the British destroyers and signalled a warning to , the headquarters of the , that the convoy had been found.\nAction\nAt 23:35, star shells burst overhead when the Italian ships were about  east of Kelibia (Cape Bon) and Campobasso was hit soon after and caught fire. After the action a crewman on Perseo wrote\n}}\nPerseo launched its two starboard torpedoes from  then sailed at full speed to the north-west towards Cape Bon. Campobasso exploded at 23:48, illuminating Perseo. The British ships fired more star shells and Perseo began abrupt evasive action until 23:52 when its rudder suffered a mechanical fault. Before the crew could steer manually, the hull was hit by two shells then more hits were received on the bridge and the engine rooms.\nSteam escaped from the hull and covered the deck as the engines stopped. The British destroyers came as close as , firing their main guns and anti-aircraft armament and at 23:58 Marotta ordered the ship to be abandoned. Perseo remained afloat for about an hour, when the magazine exploded and the ship sank by the stern at 01:00. The next day the Italian hospital ship Principessa Giovanna picked up four survivors from Campobasso and twenty men reached the coast in a lifeboat; the hospital ship rescued  from Perseo. On 6 May, Principessa Giovanna was bombed and damaged by Allied aircraft, with  killed and\nAftermath\nCasualties\nThe crew of Campobasso suffered  casualties out of the crew of  the complement of Perseo suffered  and  were rescued; Marotta was among those killed.\nSubsequent operations\nA second convoy, led by the  escort , loaded with aviation spirit, sailed with the merchant ship Belluno to Tunis from Trapani and managed to evade the British destroyers, after witnessing the destruction of Campobasso. The Tifone convoy arrived on 4 May and was the last Axis supply run to reach Africa during the war. Another Italian convoy comprising the Italian lighter MZ 724 and the water supply ship Scrivia sailed on 4 May, evacuated 200 Italian troops from Bizerte and reached Cagliari undetected the following day.\nOperation Retribution\nAs Axis airfields in Tunisia were captured, Allied fighters could escort ships in the seas between Tunisia and Sicily, making day patrols feasible. Allied convoys along the coast and to Malta were stopped to divert their escorts to the blockade of Tunisia. Aircraft were to attack Axis ships within  of the Tunisian shore and beyond the limit Allied ships would have freedom of movement. British mines had been timed to sink in early May and intelligence on Axis minefields was judged sufficient to risk sailing in some areas.\nFrom the night of 8/9 May, Paladin, with , Petard and Nubian, from Force K bombarded Kelibia and maintained a daylight blockade off Cape Bon with Force Q based at Bône (now Annaba), which comprised , ,  and  with the Hunt-class destroyers , , , , , ,  and the Greek destroyer RHS Kanaris but had to paint their superstructures red to avoid attacks by friendly aircraft.\nBritish Motor Gun Boats, Motor Torpedo Boats and US PT boats patrolled closer inshore at night. Allied superiority was so great that  decided that an evacuation attempt would be futile. Sporadic attempts were made by personnel in Tunisia to flee; after 7 May, the German KT 22, some Axis torpedo boats and MAS boats () were the only vessels to run the blockade. By the Axis surrender, the blockading vessels had taken }}\nItalian order of battle\nCampobasso convoy\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|+Convoyed ship\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"60px\"  |Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"180px\"  |Flag\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"30px\"   |GRT\n! |Notes\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|3,566\n|align=\"left\"|Sunk\n|-\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|+Escort\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"30px\"  |Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"110px\"  |Flag\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"130px\"   |Type\n! |Notes\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|Sunk\n|-\n|}\nAllied order of battle\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|+Force K\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"80px\"  |Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\"  |Flag\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"120px\"   |Type\n! |Notes\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|align=\"left\"|\n|-\n|}\nNotes\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
