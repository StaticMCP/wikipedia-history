As the name suggests, it's a spy game set in World War II Berlin, but it covers a subgenre of spy novels that Edwards calls 'Spy vs. Guy fiction.' Here, the characters are more endangered by psychological crises than by the enemy.\" For Edwards, his primary goal for the game was to \"write a book on what he calls 'Cold War Triumphalism' — the idea that the fall of the Soviet Union allowed the United States to retroactively rewrite history to justify their military and economic power.\" Edwards also intended to market the game for Europe in countries that would not normally carry role-playing games, using its focus on historical espionage during the Cold War.\nReception\nReferences"
