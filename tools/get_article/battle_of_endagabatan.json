Hamalmal barricaded his forces at Endagabatan in preparation for an offensive. Largely outnumbered by Hamalmal's rebels, the Emperor's able general Taklo successfully received assistance from the Malassay Muslim Garad Asmadin of Wej. The revolt was suppressed after a series of victories by the imperial troops which led to Hamalmal requesting clemency from the Emperor.\nReferences"
