In the first half of the 19th century the command included the counties of Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Hertfordshire. It was based in Colchester.\nDisbanded after the Napoleonic Wars, the Eastern District Command was re-created in 1866 and was based at Flagstaff House in Colchester. In January 1876 a ‘Mobilization Scheme for the forces in Great Britain and Ireland’ was published, with the ‘Active Army’ divided into eight army corps based on the District Commands. 1st Corps was to be formed within Eastern Command, based in Colchester. This scheme disappeared in 1881, when the districts were retitled ‘District Commands’.\nTwentieth century\nThe 1901 Army Estimates introduced by St John Brodrick allowed for six army corps based on six regional commands. As outlined in a paper published in 1903, IV Corps was to be formed in a reconstituted Eastern Command, with HQ at London. Lieutenant General Lord Grenfell was appointed acting General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOCinC) of IV Corps in April 1903.\nFirst World War\n(second building on the left), command headquarters during the First World War]]\nArmy Order No 324, issued on 21 August 1914, authorised the formation of a 'New Army' of six Divisions, manned by volunteers who had responded to Earl Kitchener's appeal (hence the First New Army was known as 'K1'). Each division was to be under the administration of one of the Home Commands, and Eastern Command formed what became the 12th (Eastern) Division. It was followed by 18th (Eastern) Division of K2 in September 1914. During the First World War, HQ Eastern Command was in London: initially at Horse Guards, then (from February 1916) at 50 Pall Mall, London; in 1919 it moved to 41 Queen's Gardens, Bayswater.\nSecond World War\n, command headquarters from 1941 to 1945]]\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, the headquarters was again located at Horse Guards, but by October 1939 it had moved to Hounslow Barracks. At that time Regular Troops reporting to the Command included 4th Infantry Division. In 1941, the Command relocated to Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire. During the war, the 76th Infantry (Reserve) Division was assigned to the command as its training formation.\nFrom 1 December 41 to 30 July 1943 36th Tank Brigade was located in Eastern Command. It disbanded without going overseas.\nPost War\n, command headquarters from 1939 to 1941 and 1945 to 1968]]\nAfter the War the command headquarters moved back to Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow in north London. When the Territorial Army was reformed in 1947, 54th (East Anglian) was not reestablished as a field division, but 161st Infantry Brigade was reformed as an independent infantry brigade in Eastern Command. From 1947 to 1956 101 Coast Brigade supervised RA TA coastal defence regiments, until the disestablishment of all coastal artillery.\nIn 1952 the Command was reported to include 48 Field Regiment RA, Kirkee Barracks, Colchester; 49 Field Regiment RA, Canterbury; 47 Coast Regiment RA, Dover; 36 Army Engineer Regiment, Maidstone; and 1st Battalion, The Devonshire Regiment, at Colchester.\nIn 1954 a single-storey blockhouse was built at Wilton Park in Beaconsfield, to provide a protected Eastern Command headquarters for use in the event of war; however in 1957 this provision was superseded by plans for Regional Seats of Government. In 1968, Eastern Command was dissolved and merged into a reconfigured Southern Command. The new HQ Southern Command was established at Hounslow, and the last GOCinC Eastern Command took over as GOCinC Southern Command. In 1972, Southern Command, together with the other two geographic commands, was merged with Army Strategic Command to form a new command: UK Land Forces (UKLF).\nCommand Training Centres\nBetween 1941 and 1943, each regional command of the British Army formed at-least one training centre which trained those recruits preparing to move overseas.  The centres which were based within the command were:\n* Essex Infantry Training Centre, Warley Barracks, became No.1 Training Centre on 14 August 1941 — affiliated with the City of London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) and Essex Regiment\n** From 2 July 1941 included No.51 Physical Training Wing\n* Norfolk Infantry Training Centre, Britannia Barracks, became No.2 Training Centre on 14 August 1941 — affiliated with the Royal Norfolk Regiment and Northamptonshire Regiment\n** From 2 July 1941 included No.52 Physical Training Wing\n* Suffolk Infantry Training Centre, Gibraltar Barracks, became No.3 Training Centre on 14 August 1941 — affiliated with the Suffolk Regiment and Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment\n** From 2 July 1941 included No.53 Physical Training Wing\nGeneral Officers Commanding-in-Chief\nGOCs and GOCinCs have included:General Officer Commanding Eastern District\n*1795 – 1800 General Sir William Howe\n*1801 – 1802 General the Marquess Cornwallis\n*1802 Lieutenant General William Grinfield\n*1802 – 1805 Major General Sir James Craig\n*1805 – 1806 Major General Sir James Pulteney\n*1806 – 1814 Lieutenant General Lord Chatham\n*1815 – 1819 Major General Sir John Byng\n*1866 – 1869 Major General Thomas Tidy\n*1869 – 1870 Major General Richard Farren\n*1870 – 1872 Lieutenant General Freeman Murray\n*1872 Lieutenant General the Hon.
