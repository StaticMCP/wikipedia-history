In 1973, King was elected as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives' 9th Suffolk district, a post he held until early 1983. King was the runner-up in the 1983 Boston mayoral election, against Raymond Flynn.\nKing, a lifelong resident of South End neighborhood of Boston, was active in creating community programs and institutions for low-income people in the city, and was the founder of the South End Technology Center. At the time of his death, he held the position of Senior Lecturer Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in their Department of Urban Studies and Planning.\nEarly years\nKing's mother, Ursula, was born in Guyana, and his father, Watts King, in Barbados. His parents met and married in Nova Scotia and immigrated to Boston in the early 1920s. Born in the South End neighborhood, King was one of eleven children, only nine of whom survived past infancy. He graduated from Boston Technical High School in 1946 and then from Claflin College in Orangeburg, South Carolina in 1950 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics. In 1951, he received a Master of Arts degree in education from Boston State College, and then taught math, first at Boston Trade High School and at his alma mater, Boston Technical High School.\nIn 1953, King left the classroom to work with at-risk students, becoming Director of Boy's Work at Lincoln House, a settlement house in the South End. He continued doing community work, focusing on street-corner gangs as Youth Director at the United South End Settlements (USES). King also worked as a community activist, as well as an urban renewal and anti-poverty organizer. He was fired by USES when he promoted neighborhood control over government control, but was later rehired after community protests over his firing and was given the job of community organizer. King then founded the Community Assembly for a United South End (C.A.U.S.E.) to give tenants and community residents a voice.\nPolitical activities\nActivism\nIn 1967, King became the director of the New Urban League of Greater Boston.  He brought job training for the unemployed and organized the community around public school, employment, and human services delivery issues. In 2003, King created The New Majority – an organization and program uniting Boston's communities of color– Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans – uniting them around candidates for elective office.\nBoston Redevelopment Authority protests and Tent City\nIn 1968, King helped organize a sit-in at the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) office on April 25 in protest of a planned parking garage that was going to be built at the corner of Dartmouth and Columbus Streets in the South End, a site where housing had been leveled.  The next morning, King organized an occupation of the lot.\nFor the next three days, while facing police retaliation, from 100 to 400 people occupied the lot. They built tents and wooden shanties and put up a large sign welcoming the media and visitors to \"Tent City.\" Celtics legend Bill Russell, who owned a South End restaurant, provided food for the protestors. The story received extensive coverage in the local media. In honor of the demonstration, when a housing complex at that site was dedicated on April 30, 1988, it was named \"Tent City.\" King told reporters that the key to the project was convincing ordinary Bostonians that they had to play a role in the development of their neighborhood.\nBoston School Committee campaigns\nKing ran three times for a seat on the Boston School Committee in 1961, 1963, and 1965 – being unsuccessful each time.\nState representative\nIn 1973, King was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives for the 4th Suffolk district; he served until 1982. He was redistricted to the 9th Suffolk district in 1978.\n1979 mayoral election\nIn 1979, King ran for Mayor for the first time. He finished third in the preliminary election and was eliminated.\n1983 mayoral campaign\nIn 1983, when the incumbent Mayor of Boston, Kevin White, withdrew from contention after 16 years in office, Mel King ran for mayor, the first African-American to run in a final election bid for mayor of Boston, and ultimately against Raymond Flynn. Though King secured the African American vote by wide margins and significant support among other ethnic groups, King ultimately lost to Flynn, an Irish-Catholic with roots in South Boston.\nBoth King and Flynn had originally been viewed as underdogs in the primary election. King's campaign relied heavily on volunteers, as did the campaign of Flynn.\n*\n*\nKing's campaign came in a year where Black candidates in other cities had enjoyed success. This included the election of Harold Washington in Chicago.\nKing and Flynn had known each other since childhood, meeting through both playing basketball, and had both served as state representatives at the same time and worked together there on legislation. They would ultimately have a lifelong friendship, despite having run against each other for mayor.\nRainbow Coalition/Green-Rainbow Party\nKing founded the Rainbow Coalition Party in Massachusetts in 1997. The term \"rainbow coalition\" had been used to describe coalitions which brought together a variety of demographic groups (including multiple ethnicities) into a political coalition. King had used it to describe his coalition of support during his 1983 mayoral campaign, preceding the Jesse Jackson presidential campaign the next year. In 2002, the Rainbow Coalition Party merged with the Massachusetts Green Party to become the Green-Rainbow Party, the Massachusetts affiliate of the Green Party of the United States.\nIn 2002, King supported Green-Rainbow Party nominee Jill Stein for governor of Massachusetts, saying \"Jill Stein is the only candidate who will speak truth to power...She's the only one that makes issues of racism and social justice integral parts of her campaign.\nKing remained active as a member of the Green-Rainbow Party. In 2014, he was the campaign manager for the Green-Rainbow Party candidate for State Auditor, M. K. Merelice. He also supported the candidacies of other Green-Rainbow Party candidates; Danny Factor for Secretary of the Commonwealth and Ian Jackson for Treasurer.\nEndorsements of candidacies\nDuring the 2000 presidential election, King endorsed the presidential campaign of Ralph Nader.\nKing endorsed Boston City Council at-large member Sam Yoon for mayor on August 10, 2009. King praised Yoon's vision, his collaborative approach and his focus on improving the educational system in Boston.\nKing endorsed Rep. Marty Walsh for mayor in his 2013 race against Boston City Councilor John Connolly.\nKing gave a last-minute endorsement to acting mayor Kim Janey before the primary of the 2021 Boston mayoral election.\nThe Mel King Institute\nThe Mel King Institute for Community Building was formed in 2009 by the Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations (MACDC) and Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) Boston, a nonprofit that supports affordable housing and community development. It is a training center and information clearinghouse for community development practitioners.\nAcademic work\nIn 1970, King created the Community Fellows Program (CFP) in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT. He served as an adjunct professor of Urban Studies and Planning and director of the Community Fellows Program for twenty-five years until 1996. CFP, a nine-month-long program brought community organizers and leaders from across America to reflect, research, and study urban community politics, economics, social life, education, housing, and media.\nIn 1981, King's book, Chain of Change: Struggles for Black Community Development was published by South End Press. It focused on development in housing, education, employment and politics in Boston from the 1950s through the 1970s. Inspired by young activists, King reprinted Chain of Change in 2018.\nIn addition to writing Chain of Change and journal articles, King also used poetry to share his messages.\nLater years and death\nUpon his retirement from MIT, King established the South End Technology Center to provide computer training for low-income people.\nIn 2021, an intersection in Boston's South End was named the \"Melvin H. 'Mel' King Square\" in his honor.\nKing died at his home in Boston's South End on March 28, 2023, at the age of 94. He was survived by his wife, the former Joyce Kenion, whom he married in 1951.\nSee also\n* 1973–1974 Massachusetts legislature\n* 1975–1976 Massachusetts legislature\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=126 MassMoments: \"Activists Erect Tent City in Boston\"]\n*[http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/qa/multi_1/documents/03773014.asp Boston Phoenix: \"Still going strong at 75, former Boston mayoral candidate Mel King reflects on a life of political activism\"]\n*[http://openvault.wgbh.org/ton/MLA000396/index.html: Interview with Mel King about living in a diverse city] for the WGBH series, Ten O'Clock News\n*[http://main.wgbh.org/ton/programs/2517_01.html \"WGBH: Gail Harris interviews Mel King\"]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081222001611/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926272,00.html Time Magazine: \"Boston wins by a landslide .. a black takes the primary in a racially scarred city\"]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061024132114/http://www.dotnews.com/comment%2011.28.03.html Dorchester Reporter: \"The Campaign that changed Boston: 1983\"]\n*[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1995/melvinking.html MIT News Office: \"Conference to Honor Mel King\"]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070120024342/http://www.southendtechcenter.org/pages/698532/index.htm South End Technology Center@Tent City]\n*[http://www.iaas.umb.edu/newmajority/ The New Majority: Uniting Boston's Communities of Color]\n*[http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/hon-melvin-king-41 Historymakers Profile: Hon.
