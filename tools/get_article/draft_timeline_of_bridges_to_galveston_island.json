Goods delivered to and from Galveston Island by steam powered ferry, with intermodal connections with railroad possible on the mainland side. Horse drawn drays operated on the island side.\nFirst Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad bridge, constructed 1860. Wooden timber trestles. Slightly north of Old Causeway. Destroyed by hurricane 1867. Connected rail from Virgina Point on the mainland to Galveston Island. Rail line on Galveston Island still present, north of Subject Property.\nSecond Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad bridge, constructed 1869. Wooden timber trestles. Slightly north of Old Causeway. Replaced 1860 bridge. Destroyed by hurricane 1875.\nThird Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad bridge; shared by Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway; constructed from 1875 to 1877. Wooden timber trestles. Slightly north of Old Causeway. Replaced 1875 bridge. Destroyed by hurricane 1886.\nOld Wagon Bridge, constructed 1893. Steel truss spans supported by and concrete piers. First non-rail bridge connecting Galveston Island to the Mainland. Route for mainland farmers to sell produce to island inhabitants. Slightly south of I-45 Causeway. destroyed in the 1900 Storm. Concrete piers still present below water line, visible during extreme low tides. 2-miles long.\nOld Causeway, constructed from 1909 to 1912. Destroyed by hurricane in 1915. A temporary wooden rail trestle was constructed while Old Causeway was rebuilt. The rebuilt Old Causeway featured three rail lines and two automobile lanes. The two rail lines for steam locomotives were shared by Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad (owned by Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad); Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway; and Texas & New Orleans (T&NO) Railroad (owned by Southern Pacific). Galveston–Houston Electric Railway operated the electric rail line. Old Causeway had one lane of automobile traffic in each direction.\nNew Causeway, construction completed 1939.  Four lanes, vehicular traffic only.  Drawbridge in center, aligned with drawbridge on Old Causeway.  Old Causeway dedicated to rail traffic (and electric and water lines) since 1939.\nSecond New Causeway bridge, plans approved 1957, construction completed 1961.  Center section had 73-foot clearance over shipping lane to obviate need for drawbridge. Parallel to First New Causeway.  Center section of First New Causeway reconstructed to eliminate drawbridge (construction completed 1964.  Connected to Interstate 45.  The two New Causeway bridges operated together, with the reconstructed original dedicated to northbound traffic (toward the mainland), and the newer bridge to southbound traffic (toward the island).\nGeorge and Cynthia Mitchell Memorial Causeway replaced the two New Causeway bridges.  Construction on the northbound bridge was completed in 2005.  Construction on the southbound bridge was completed in 2008. The bridges abut one another, with our lanes plus two emergency shoulders in each direction.\nWikipedia page.
