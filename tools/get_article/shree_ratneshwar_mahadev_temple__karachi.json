It is located near the Clifton Beach in Clifton. The temple is famous for its annual Shivratri celebration, and during religious celebrations, around 25,000 pilgrims visit the temple.\nArchitecture\nShree Ratneshwar Mahadev Temple is an underground temple with six levels. There are two staircases near Jehangir Kothari Parade that leads to the underground levels. The fourth underground level is a courtyard floor made of marble. The fifth level has a tunnel which is believed to lead to the Mohatta Palace. There is also a fresh water spring inside the Cave.\nIn 2014, under Clifton traffic improvement project the construction of two underpasses and a flyover were started near the temple due to which cracks started appearing in the cave. The Pakistan Hindu Panchayat filed a case in Supreme Court against this, and the Court ordered restoration of the temple.\nReligious significance\nHindus in Karachi believe that the third eye of the Shiva watches the Sea and prevents the Sea disasters like floods from happening. It is believed that Lord Shiva used to live in this cave, and also that Guru Nanak used to meditate in this cave.\nShivratri Celebration\nOn the Shivratri night, Hindus in Karachi fast and visit the temple. Later, devotees from the Chanesar Goth come to the temple carrying water from the Ganges, which Hindus generally consider to be sacred, in order to bathe the idol of Shiva. Puja is performed until 5 am, when an aarti is then done. Devotees then walk barefoot with women carrying a pooja thali containing flowers, incense sticks, rice, coconut and a diya to the sea after which they are free to break their fast. Later they eat food prepared in the temple kitchen for breakfast.\nSee also\n*Ramapir Temple Tando Allahyar\n*Umarkot Shiv Mandir\n*Shri Krishna Mandir, Rawalpindi\n*Krishna Temple, Sadiqabad\n*Darya Lal Mandir\n*Panchmukhi Hanuman Temple\nReferences"
