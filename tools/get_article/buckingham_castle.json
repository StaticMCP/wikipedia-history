It was possibly held by the Giffard family.  It was levelled in 1777 for the churchyard which now occupies the site, although the outer stone walls remain in place and provide support for the churchyard green. A similar stone wall exists at the rear of castle street, where individual garden plots are supported.\nSee also\n*Castles in Great Britain and Ireland\n*List of castles in England\nReferences\n*Fry, Plantagenet Somerset, The David & Charles Book of Castles, David & Charles, 1980."
