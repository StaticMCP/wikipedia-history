Bush announced the establishment of the '''President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform''', a bipartisan panel to advise on options to reform the United States income tax code to make it simpler, fairer, and more pro-growth to benefit all Americans.\nOrigins\nThe task force was created by the President's Executive Order 13369, amended by subsequent orders 13379 and 13386.\nReport\nOn November 1, 2005, the Advisory Panel submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury a report containing revenue-neutral policy options for reforming the Federal Internal Revenue Code.

Frenzel\n*Elizabeth Garrett\n*Edward P. Lazear\n*Timothy J. Muris\n*James M. Poterba\n*Charles O. Rossotti\n*Liz Ann Sonders\nReferences"
