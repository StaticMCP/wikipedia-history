His experiences in Hawaii significantly influenced his appreciation for local culture, later becoming a foundational aspect of his professional endeavors.\nCareer\nSugimoto began his career working for a cable company, where he remained employed for approximately 23 years. During this period, he launched a personal blog highlighting various aspects of Hawaiian life, culture, and community events. The blog's popularity encouraged him to create branded merchandise, eventually leading to the establishment of VH07V.\nIn 2011, Sugimoto transitioned to full-time management of VH07V. The brand subsequently expanded from a modest online store into a recognized local apparel brand known for its distinctive designs and community engagement. In May 2024, Sugimoto opened a flagship retail store in Kaimukī, Honolulu, located in a restored 1928 cottage.\nCommunity contributions\nSugimoto's VH07V brand actively engages in community-oriented initiatives. Notably, VH07V raised funds through specially designed apparel to support local causes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Sugimoto created a Love’s Bakery-inspired T-shirt, raising approximately $55,120 for employees impacted by the bakery's closure in 2021. VH07V also supported Honolulu's Little League World Series team by raising around $15,000 for travel expenses. VH07V has also participated in fundraising efforts for Maui relief, support for businesses impacted by COVID-19, and relief efforts following natural disasters affecting Kauai and the Big Island.
