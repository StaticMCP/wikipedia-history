It was released on June 19, 1992, by Caroline Records. Hut Records issued the album, along with the single \"Winona\", in the United Kingdom the same year.\nOn April 20, 2009, Delaware was reissued by Cherry Red Records with four bonus tracks from the band's 1992 EP Your Aquarium.\nArtwork\nThe artwork for Delaware features a young girl holding a revolver in front of a barber shop. When the album was reissued in 2024, the band chose to replace the revolver in the image with a flower because of the prevalence of gun violence in the United States, donating a portion of its sales to the Artist for Action charity. Additionally, the band's friend Phil, who was mentioned in the song \"Kick the Tragedy\", died from a gun-related incident.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = NME\n| rev2score = 8/10\n| rev3 = Pitchfork\n| rev3score = 7.5/10\n| rev4 = Record Collector\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = Vox\n| rev5score = 8/10\n}}\nThe New York Times noted that the band's \"use of atonal chords, excessive distortion and mumbled non sequiturs can be traced back to Sonic Youth's 1988 album Daydream Nation.\"\nIn 2016, Pitchfork ranked Delaware at number 45 on its list of the 50 best shoegaze albums of all time.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\nDrop Nineteens\n* Greg Ackell – guitar, vocals\n* Paula Kelley – vocals, guitar\n* Chris Roof – drums\n* Motohiro Yasue – guitar\n* Steve Zimmerman – bass\nProduction\n* Vincent Buckholtz II – mixing, recording (assistant)\n* Paul Degooyer – production, mixing, recording\n* Drop Nineteens – production\n* Dave Snider – recording\n* Jennifer Spaziani – mixing (assistant)\n* Jeff Way – mixing (assistant)\nDesign\n* Petrisse Brièl – photography\n* Ellie Hughes – design\n* Tom Hughes – design\n* Turlach MacDonagh – photography\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (1992)\n!scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| UK Independent Albums (OCC)\n| 5\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
