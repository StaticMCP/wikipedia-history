Such beliefs may manifest as specific behavior.\nFactors that contribute to loss of tradition are endorsement of individual choice and responsibility or the \"sacred\" (in Émile Durkheim's sense of the term) individual itself in democratic societies, and the revolution in communications. Among the theorists who believe that society is moving from a modernity that has been largely traditional to a post-traditional time is Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens.\nSee also\n* Personal development\n* Economic freedom, Individualism and Economic Order\n* solipsism, egocentrism\n* Fin de siècle, Degeneration\n* freedom of choice\nReferences\n* Contributors include Mark Poster, Richard Sennett, Ulrich Beck, Margaret Archer, Mary Douglas and Thomas Luckmann.\n*https://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~janzb/courses/hum3255/giddensdetrad1.htm\n*http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O101-Enttraditionalisierung.html"
