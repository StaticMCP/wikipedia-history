These 22 vessels – comprising 3 classes (Type 34, 34A and 36) – had all been built in the 1930s, making them modern vessels (no destroyers remained in German hands following the close of the First World War). Including that final pre-war vessel, a further 19 were brought into service during the war and more were captured from opposing navies, including the Italian Navy (Regia Marina) after the Italian Armistice with the Allies in 1943.\nGerman destroyer classes were generally known by the year of their design. Because of their size, use and weaponry, some vessels classified as \"fleet torpedo boats\", Flottentorpedoboot, are also described as destroyers. During World War II, destroyers were administratively grouped into one of several destroyer flotillas.\nClass general characteristics are taken from the first of each class, and may differ slightly for individual ships, particularly when they were refitted. Post-war, some surviving ships had significant changes to armament.\nZerstörer 1934\n{|\nmaximum\n|Ship length=* o/a\n* w/l\n|Ship beam=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship propulsion=*2 × Wagner geared turbines,\n*2 shafts\n|Ship speed=\n|Ship range=  at\n|Ship boats=\n|Ship complement=325\n|Ship sensors=\n|Ship EW=\n|Ship armament=*5 ×  guns\n*4 × 3.7&nbsp;cm guns\n*6 × 2&nbsp;cm guns\n*8 ×  torpedo tubes\n*60 mines\n|Ship armour=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\nThis class of four ships was the first German destroyer class. It was designed around a new type of engine, using high pressure steam. This should have allowed higher speed, while saving space and crewmembers. The engine was however so complicated and prone to breakdown, that it forced the navy to assign even more very highly qualified personnel on board to operate and service them. As a result of stability problems, the range of the ships had to be restricted by navy regulations, allowing them to use only half of the fuel carried, to prevent the ships from becoming too light. The bow proved to be of faulty design, resulting in the ships being rather wet in heavy seas. This was fixed by rebuilding all four ship of the class before 1939. Four destroyers were laid down between October 1934 and January 1935. Only one ship survived the war. The ships were named after German navy personnel killed in World War I.\nThe ships were:\n{|\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z1 Leberecht Maas||Laid down: Deutsche Werke Kiel, 15 October 1934\nLaunched: 18 August 1935\nCommissioned: 14 January 1937\nFate: sunk after friendly fire bomb hits on 22 February 1940, during Operation Wikinger\nNamed after Leberecht Maass\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z2 Georg Thiele||Laid down: Deutsche Werke Kiel, 25 October 1934\nLaunched: 18 August 1935\nCommissioned: 27 February 1937\nFate: beached on 13 April 1940, after suffering serious damage during the Battles of Narvik\nNamed after Georg Thiele\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z3 Max Schultz||Laid down: Deutsche Werke Kiel, 2 January 1935\nLaunched: 30 November 1935\nCommissioned: 8 April 1937\nFate: sunk as a result of friendly fire bomb hits and striking mines on 22 February 1940, during Operation WikingerNamed after Max Schultz\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z4 Richard Beitzen||Laid down: Deutsche Werke Kiel, 7 January 1935\nLaunched: 30 November 1935\nCommissioned: 13 May 1937\nFate: scrapped 1947\nNamed after Richard Beitzen\n|}\nZerstörer 1934A\n{|\n|Ship displacement=\n|Ship length=* o/a\n* w/l\n|Ship beam=\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship propulsion=*2 shafts, 2 × Wagner geared steam turbines\n*6 × water-tube boilers\n|Ship speed=\n|Ship range=  at\n|Ship power=\n|Ship complement=325\n|Ship sensors=\n|Ship EW=\n|Ship armament=*5 ×  guns\n*4 (later 14) × 3.7&nbsp;cm guns\n*6 (later 10) × 2&nbsp;cm guns\n*8 ×  torpedo tubes\n*60 mines\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\nTwelve destroyers laid down between July and November 1935. They were only slightly modified from the design of the preceding 1934 class and continued their predecessors' limited endurance and magazine capacity – factors which contributed to the heavy German losses in the Second Battle of Narvik.

Most of the serious faults of the earlier ships had been resolved: engine reliability and the structural integrity was much improved and they were much better seagoing ships, shipping less water through an improvement in the design of the bows. Despite this, five of this newer type were also lost at Narvik in April 1940.\n{|\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 9 September 1936\nLaunched: 19 August 1937\nCommissioned: 29 August 1938\nFate: sunk 13 April 1940 (Narvik)\nNamed after Diether von Roeder\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 9 September 1936\nLaunched: 1 December 1937\nCommissioned: 8 October 1938\nFate: scuttled on 13 April 1940\nNamed after Hans Lüdemann\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 5 October 1936\nLaunched: 22 December 1937\nCommissioned: 12 January 1939\nFate: beached on 13 April 1940\nNamed after Hermann Künne\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 14 September 1937\nLaunched: 15 June 1938\nCommissioned: 21 March 1939\nFate: Transferred to the Soviet Union, served in the Baltic Fleet as the Prochnyi (Прочный) scrapped 1956\nNamed after Karl Galster\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 15 December 1937\nLaunched: 20 August 1938\nCommissioned: 10 June 1939\nFate: sunk on 10 April 1940\nNamed after Wilhelm Heidkamp\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 3 January 1938\nLaunched: 20 September 1938\nCommissioned: 24 September 1939\nFate: sunk on 10 April 1940\nNamed after Anton Schmitt\n|}\nZerstörer 1936A \"Narvik\"\n{|\n)\n|Ship displacement=  maximum\n|Ship length=* o/a\n* w/l\n|Ship beam=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship propulsion=*2 × Wagner geared turbines, 70,000 shp\n*2 shafts\n|Ship speed=\n|Ship range=  at\n|Ship boats=\n|Ship complement=330\n|Ship sensors=\n|Ship EW=\n|Ship armament=*4 or 5 ×  guns\n*4 (later 10) × 3.7&nbsp;cm guns\n*8 (later 20) × 2&nbsp;cm guns\n*8 ×  torpedo tubes\n*60 mines\n*4 × depth charge launchers\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\nEight destroyers intended to carry new 150&nbsp;mm (5.9&nbsp;inch) guns in single turrets with a twin turret at the bow. The twin mountings were not ready in time and so singles were first used, and the twins fitted later. Anti-aircraft armament was substantially improved.\nDespite reusing earlier ship designs as a basis, with modifications to improve seaworthiness, the ships were wet in heavy seas, especially fitted with heavy turrets. After much effort, the problem was traced to a newly designed stern. However, this problem was somewhat offset by the fact that the twin mount was fully enclosed and had a high maximum elevation, allowing limited use against aircraft.\nThese ships reverted to the traditional German practice of giving torpedo ships numbers rather than names. Four survived the war.\n{|\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z23||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 15 November 1938\nLaunched: 15 December 1939\nCommissioned: 15 September 1940\nFate: scrapped after 1951\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z24||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 2 January 1939\nLaunched: 7 March 1940\nCommissioned: 26 October 1940\nFate: sunk 25 August 1944\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z25||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 15 February 1939\nLaunched: 16 March 1940\nCommissioned: 30 November 1940\nFate: scrapped 1961\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z26||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 1 April 1939\nLaunched: 2 April 1940\nCommissioned: 11 January 1941\nFate: sunk 29 March 1942 by British cruiser Trinidad and destroyers Eclipse and Fury\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z27||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 27 December 1939\nLaunched: 1 August 1940\nCommissioned: 26 February 1941\nFate: sunk 28 December 1943\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z28||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 30 November 1939\nLaunched: 20 August 1940\nCommissioned: 9 August 1941\nFate: sunk 6 March 1945\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z29||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 21 March 1940\nLaunched: 15 October 1940\nCommissioned: 25 June 1941\nFate: scuttled 16 December 1946\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Z30||Laid down: DeSchiMAG Bremen, 15 April 1940\nLaunched: 8 December 1940\nCommissioned: 15 November 1941\nFate: scrapped 1949\n|}\nZerstörer 1936A (Mob)\n{|\nmaximum\n|Ship length=* o/a\n* w/l\n|Ship beam=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship propulsion=*2 × Wagner geared turbines, 70,000 shp\n*2 shafts\n|Ship speed=\n|Ship range=  at\n|Ship boats=\n|Ship complement=330\n|Ship sensors=\n|Ship EW=\n|Ship armament=*5 ×  guns\n*4 (later 14) × 3.7&nbsp;cm guns\n*12 (later 18) × 2&nbsp;cm guns\n*8 ×  torpedo tubes\n*60 mines\n*4 × depth charge launchers\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\nWhen war broke out in 1939, planned new destroyer classes were cancelled and twelve additional 1936A vessels (Z.31 to Z.42, although the last three were to be cancelled) were ordered with slight modifications to speed construction and save materials. \"Mob\" stands for \"Mobilmachung\" (Mobilisation). The 150&nbsp;mm twin turrets had been manufactured for planned, but never built, \"O\" class battlecruisers.

Weser at Bremen; none were launched, just two were started – Z.46 and Z.47 – and both were bombed by Allied aircraft while under construction and were scrapped on the slipways in 1945. This design was a response to the vulnerability to air attack of early German destroyers and would have used six new 128&nbsp;mm Flak 40 guns (originally designed for the Luftwaffe) as dual purpose weapons in twin mountings. The number of smaller calibre anti-aircraft guns would have also been increased.\nZerstörer 1938A/Ac\nIn order to provide support for larger German warships operating far from their bases, the development of large ocean-going destroyers started in the late 1930s. They would have had dual power systems to enable long endurance cruises. Twenty-four of these were planned under Plan Z but were not actually ordered – the concept was developed further into the Spähkreuzer (see Type 1936B above).\nZerstörer 1938B\nShips of this class would have been small destroyers designed to patrol and operate in Baltic and coastal waters, but would have had quite big operational range for such purpose, and could have also been used in high seas.

They were planned to have a revised armament, with six 128&nbsp;mm Flak 40 dual purpose main guns, and an all-new anti-aircraft armament, with three 5.5&nbsp;cm Gerät 58 intermediate calibre anti-aircraft guns and a close-in armament of 14 30&nbsp;mm guns in seven twin mounts, with eight torpedo tubes.\nFive of these ships (Z.52–Z.56) were ordered from A.G.

They sat in size between torpedo-equipped fast attack boats (known to the Allies as E-boats) and the destroyers. In 1939, the Germans started work on new designs that were a response to the weaknesses of earlier designs. These \"Fleet Torpedo Boats\" (Flottentorpedoboot) were large, 1,755 tons, and more able as escorts and for anti-aircraft defence as well as torpedo attacks and they were comparable in most respects to some of the British destroyer classes. They were all laid down during the war.\nFlottentorpedoboot 1939 (Elbing-class)\nThe first of the fleet vessels, they were comparable in most respects – size, armament, and use – to standard British destroyer types. Fifteen were laid down between 1940 and 1942, in the Schichau shipyard in Elbing (now Elbląg) and from that the Allies referred to them as the Elbing-class.\nThe last was commissioned at the end of 1944; three survived the war and served in Allied navies. The ships were numbered T22 to T36.\nFlottentorpedoboot 1940\nFollowing the capitulation of the Netherlands, Dutch shipyards were contracted to build 24 boats based on a Dutch design. Only three of these 2,600 ton vessels were launched. These three were moved to the Baltic in 1944 for work, but none were completed.\nFlottentorpedoboot 1941\nThis was a development of the 1939 class, with bigger engines and more anti-aircraft weapons. Fifteen were laid down or launched from 1942 but, by the end of the war, none had been completed.\nFlottentorpedoboot 1944\nThese were to have been ocean-going vessels, as opposed to North Sea or coastal vessels, capable of operating with the fleet, with greater range and an emphasis on anti-aircraft weaponry. Nine were ordered in March 1944; however, the order was subsequently cancelled without any building having started.\nTorpedoboot Ausland\nSeveral destroyer-sized ships were captured by the Germans and put into service as Torpedoboot Ausland.\nFlottenbegleiter\nThese 10 fleet escort vessels of the F class were the German equivalent to the Allied destroyer escorts and frigates.\nCaptured ships\nSome destroyers were captured and used by the Germans; for full list see Torpedoboot Ausland.\nZH1\nThe Dutch destroyer Hr.Ms. Gerard Callenburgh was built by RDM Rotterdam and launched on 12 October 1939. The Dutch attempted to scuttle this ship during the German invasion, but the destroyer was salvaged and completed under German control with technical guidance from Blohm & Voss. She was commissioned as the ZH1 on 11 October 1942. The Germans retained most of the Dutch armament and equipment. The ZH1 spent most of her life on trials in the Baltic, but transferred to Western France via the English Channel in November 1943. When the western allies invaded Normandy in 1944, the German destroyers based in western France attempted to interdict the invasion armada. The German squadron was intercepted by an Allied force – the 10th Destroyer Flotilla (HMS Tartar, Ashanti, Eskimo, Javelin, HMCS Haida, Huron, and ORP Błyskawica, Piorun). In the night action, ZH1 was torpedoed and sunk by Ashanti on 9 June 1944; 33 men were lost.\nZF2\nThe hull of the French Le Hardi-class destroyer ''L'Opiniatre was captured intact and 16% complete in Bordeaux. The Kriegsmarine intended to complete her for service. Since French armament was not available, and for standardisation with the rest of the German Navy, 127&nbsp;mm guns and German pattern torpedo tubes were ordered. Work proceeded tardily until all progress was abandoned in July 1943. The hull was eventually broken up on the slip\nZG3 (Hermes)\nThe Greek destroyer Vasilefs Georgios was captured in damaged condition after the fall of Greece, then repaired in Greece with assistance from the Germaniawerft and commissioned by the Kriegsmarine as the ZG3 or the Hermes.
