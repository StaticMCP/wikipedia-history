The company specializes in the provision of homebuilt aircraft plans for amateur construction.\nIn 1998 the company was known as Viking Aircraft Inc., but in 2008 seems to have been registered as Viking Aircraft, LLC, with Robin M. Taylor as agent.\nThe company sells plans for the Bert Sisler-designed Viking SF-2A Cygnet of which more than 100 were flown by 2003. The company also at one time supplied plans for the Rutan Quickie-derived Bob Walters-designed Viking Dragonfly, of which more than 500 were completed by 2003.\nAircraft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=center style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n|+ align=center style=\"background:#BFD7FF\"| Summary of aircraft built by Viking Aircraft\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
