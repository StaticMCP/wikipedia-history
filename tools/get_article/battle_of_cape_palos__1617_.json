The Spanish fleet was sailing to Naples but was intercepted by the Algerian fleet. The battle ended disastrously for the Spanish, who suffered heavy losses.\nPrelude\nCartagena was an important Spanish city since there was a demand for vessels to transport mainly recruits and supplies to Italy, as Cartagena was one of the main routes for the departure of Spanish troops to the possessions in Southern Italy. In the year 1617, an expedition was prepared to send 1,857 recruits to Naples, which required gathering a considerable number of vessels. Among these ships and those that could be rented from other owners, a more or less respectable fleet was formed: five Flemish vessels, one French, and one Neapolitan.\nBattle\nOnce the convoy was formed, they left Cartagena port, given the lack of wind. The Spanish fleet arrived at Cape Palos on August 4 and encountered a group of 16 Algerian ships led by Sulayman Reis and Mustapha Reis. The various versions known of the battle suggest that the battle began with a first attack by the Spanish flagship, where the commander of the expedition, Lázaro de Eguiguren, however, the other vessels hesitated to join the battle. A fierce battle ensued, and the Spanish put up a fierce fight but were overwhelmed in the end. Lázaro de Eguiguren managed to regroup the other vessels and retreat to Cartagena. The Spanish have lost two ships in this battle, the Neptuno and El perro del Agua, alongside 715 killed or captured. Many of those wounded in battle died when arriving, reducing the number of survivors to 700 men.\nAftermath\nOnce in Cartagena, everyone blamed each other and denied their own responsibility: the commander blamed the royal officers for not properly preparing the ships; in return, they blamed the commander; everyone blamed the corregidor for not providing assistance; and above all, the captains. After the defeat, there was a major concern about sending expeditions and defending the coastline. From mid-April 1618, a large Algerian fleet was detected, and the city was put into a defensive state. The fear and tension lasted until December of the same year.\nThe Algerian victory at Cape Palos increased the fame of Mustapha Reis. In September, Sulieman was promoted to admiral of the Algerian navy, which was the peak of his career, but in October, he was removed.\nReferences\nSources\n*Alan G.
