Its programming consists of a wide variety of shows and music from across genres. It is currently broadcasting via online stream and TuneIn.\nIts studios are located in the Students' Union building at One Elmwood. It is the only licensed student station broadcasting in Northern Ireland, and one of several on the island.\nHistory\nQueen's Radio began broadcasting on 29 September 2003, initially over the Queen's University campus network and then the internet. In late 2005, the station was successful in acquiring a low-powered AM licence, allowing it to broadcast to Queen's Halls of Residence (Elms Village) directly via Medium Wave. This service commenced on 6 February 2006.\nQueen's Radio is operated by the 'Queen's University of Belfast Radio Club', which was originally formed in 1953, making it two years older than the independent student newspaper The Gown. The old Radio Club was a general purpose electronics, amateur radio and computer club, and provided facilities for students to pursue hobby interests in these areas and participated in amateur radio contests, etc. In the late 1990s the University evicted it from its premises in Fitzwilliam St and the club became almost dormant for several years.\nIn 2001, the Radio Club was taken over by a group of students with the intention of forming a broadcast radio station, and giving QUB students experience of all aspects of broadcast radio. After two years of acquiring equipment, building up membership and negotiating with the Students' Union for premises, the station was ready to broadcast at the start of term in the 2003/04 academic year. The first live show was 'The Lunchbox' presented by Ian Llewellyn, although a pilot show had already been recorded by Shane Horan before the summer break.\nThere was previously a temporary RSL (restricted service licence) FM radio station at Queen's called 'Fresh Air'. This operated during the first four weeks of term in September 1995 and was hosted by Cool FM DJs and some students, including the now BBC Radio Ulster presenter/producer Donna Legge, Citybeat presenter Stuart Robinson, Pádraig Mac Donnchadha and Downtown Radio DJ Lynda Cullan, but it was not set up or run by students at Queen's.\nBefore Queen's Radio was set up in its current form, Queen's University had rejected a proposal from university staff to set up a station at Queen's  it was judged to be too expensive to set up and maintain. Now, it is considered to be a major attraction for the university to prospective undergraduates.\nIn 2006, the station was granted a licence to broadcast using Medium Wave to the Elms BT9 Accommodation village in South Belfast. In 2009 the station made headlines when it aired an advert for reducing carbon emissions, which Sammy Wilson had banned from being broadcast in Northern Ireland. In late 2009, the station pulled its Medium Wave transmission but continued to broadcast via its online player available from the station's website.\nSince 2020, Queen’s Radio have been part of the SRA, being the only affiliate station in the NI region. Around this time, it has also since moved into the Student's Union building, and gave a larger focus towards The Scoop and QRTV, and student-produced podcasts.\nCurrently, the station is managed by Jonathan McBride (station manager) and Fiona MacIntyre (deputy station manager).\nDepartments\nQueen's Radio currently operates under 7 departments and 3 brands. Among these are The Scoop (news and current affairs) and QRTV (visuals, editing) which operate as autonomous departments, producing their own content.\nAwards\nIn November 2005, the station was awarded the Gold Award for Best Technical Achievement for its computer-based Record of Transmission / Archiving system at the Student Radio Awards.
