The New York Times wrote that \"Ms. Thomas has produced a slightly seedy-feeling but, yes, addictive biography of two outsize personalities who seem less the gods or kings of her title than Captain Hook and Peter Pan.\" In contrast, The Guardian heavily criticized the book for offering an uneven portrayal of McQueen and Galliano, stating that:to read her brass-tacks account, you'd get the impression that Galliano's career has been fail after fail. She implicates the \"gushing\" fashion press in praising his work – we're an easy bunch to disparage – yet she seems more or less blind to the meaning and emotion others may have felt at Galliano's or McQueen's shows.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150212073809/http://www.refinery29.com/gods-and-kings \"Five Lessons about Self-Destruction All Creative People Should Know\"].
