Since its incorporation as a town in 1884, like other cities, Calgary has had to deal with a variety of violence. Calgary has been credited with maintaining relative civility during duress. The Great Depression in Canada has received particular attention from sociologists and historians, including Thomas Thorner and Neil Watson who wrote, \"There is little question that Calgary experienced its share of civil strife during the Depression. Battles between police and the single unemployed men, full scale riots and threats to blow up public buildings appear to have been almost annual events.\" According to Stephen Graham, a Professor of Human Geography at Durham University, recent events have seen the City of Calgary change their tactics towards civil unrest activities such as protests.\nEvents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Riots and civil unrest in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in chronological order\n|-\n!Date\n!Issue\n!Event\n|-\n|August 2, 1892\n|Racial tension\n|A race riot ensued after members of the Chinese community were blamed for a smallpox outbreak. City authorities burned a laundry where a Chinese worker contracted the disease, and its occupants were quarantined. Nine Chinese contracted the disease, and three died. Alleging the spread was caused by unhygienic living conditions, a mob of over 300 men smashed doors and windows of all the Chinese laundries, destroyed and looted property, and assaulted Chinese residents. As the riot ended, police arrived.  Many in the Chinese community sought refuge at the North-West Mounted Police barracks or in the homes of clergymen. The NWMP patrolled Calgary continuously for the next 3 weeks to protect Chinese Calgarians.\n|-\n|July 16, 1902\n|Labour unrest\n|The Calgary Trades and Labour Council hosts a demonstration with several thousand participants in support of local labour.\n|-\n|February 10, 1916 (during World War I)\n|Ethnic and labour tension\n|An anti-German riot destroys the Riverside Hotel at 4 Street S.E. and Boulevard Avenue.

They re-assembled in a nearby vacant lot called \"Red Square.\" After a series of speeches, the crowd was told to disperse, and when they did not, police took away a popular speaker from the platform.
