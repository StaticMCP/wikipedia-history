The Guru's torture infuriated his close friend and Muslim mystic, Mian Mir. On the fifth day of torture, the Guru's request for a bath in the river was granted after intercession from Mian Mir. After submerging himself in the river, the Guru reportedly did not reappear, and a Mughal search party was unable to retrieve him.\nThe Guru's son and successor, Guru Hargobind had a memorial built here in 1619. The main Gurudwara building with gilded dome was built during Maharaja Ranjit Singh's reign, while some other additions were made later up until the partition.\nGallery\nFile:Photograph of Gurdwara Dera Sahib in Lahore, India (now Pakistan), circa 1909.jpg|Photograph of Gurdwara Dera Sahib in Lahore, India (now Pakistan), circa 1909\nFile:True-colour photograph - Lahore, India (now Pakistan).
