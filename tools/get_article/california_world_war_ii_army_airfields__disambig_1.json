However, Air Technical Service Command (ATSC), Air Transport Command (ATC) and I Troop Carrier Command used a significant number of airfields in a support role. A significant number of them had operational squadrons for air defense of the Pacific coastline and anti-submarine patrols, and one was even handed over to Civil Air Patrol pilots for their use.\nIn addition to the major fields, dozens of minor auxiliary fields and airstrips were built, generally to provide more room for basic flight training, but also to support other operations. A few of these were designed as \"fallback fields\" for launching defensive operations in case of a Japanese invasion.\nMost Army airfields were built with three runways in a triangle, with parking ramp areas adjacent to one runway. This triangular configuration allowed rapid construction, without regard to the direction of the prevailing winds. Navy fields were generally built with two runways in a cross, with a third runway intersecting the other two at an angle.\nThere were, of course, other designs, including single-runway fields.  Most noteworthy were \"landing mats\", large concrete squares, hexagons and circles, which allowed takeoffs and landings in any direction.\nFollowing the war, many bases and auxiliary fields were given to local governments or returned to service as municipal airports. Often, budget constraints caused the new owners to close or even remove the \"extra\" runways, retaining only those that faced into the prevailing winds. In at least one case (Orland), large portions of a landing mat were removed, leaving a conventional runway and ramp.\nSeveral fields were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War, or used for experimental aviation, the most notable of these being Edwards Air Force Base.\nA few were sold or given back to private owners, generally to be returned to agricultural use, while a handful have become private airports. A number of fields were simply abandoned, due to their remote locations, and the remains of these can still be found, especially in the Mojave Desert.\nMajor airfields\nFourth Air Force\nThe mission of Fourth Air Force was the air defense of the West Coast, operating two air defense wings in California (Los Angeles and San Francisco). It also provided operational training of newly formed groups and squadrons in combat aircraft prior to their deployment to overseas combat theaters. After April 1944, operational training was changed to replacement training of newly commissioned pilots in combat fighters from the AAF Training Command advanced flying schools.\n* Chandler Municipal Airport,  west of Fresno\n: Briefly used in 1941 While Hammer Army Airfield under construction\n: Now: Fresno Chandler Executive Airport\n* Chico Army Airfield,  north of Chico\n: Army Air Forces Basic Flying School / Army Air Force Pilot School, Basic, 24 March 1942–25 April 1944\n: 10th Base Headquarters an Air Base Squadron, 12 July 1942–25 April 1944\n: 433rd Army Air Force Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Fighter), 25 April 1944–31 October 1945\n: Now: Chico Municipal Airport\n: Known sub-bases and auxiliaries\n:: Orland Auxiliary Field\n:: Kirkwood Auxiliary Field\n:: Vina Auxiliary Field\n:: Campbell Auxiliary Field\n:: Oroville Auxiliary Field\n:: Sacramento Municipal Airport\n:: Oroville Army Airfield\n:: Siskiyou County Army Airfield\n:: Redding Army Airfield\n* Daggett Municipal Airport, Daggett\n: Now: Barstow-Daggett Airport\n* Hamilton Army Airfield, , Novato, north of San Rafael\n: Air Base Squadron, 45th Air Base Group / 46th Air Base Squadron/ 46th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron, 25 August 1940–1 April 1944\n: 460th Army Air Force Base Unit (Base Services, Air Transport Command), 1 April 1944–8 May 1946\n: Hq, West Coast Wing, Air Transport Command, 1 August 1944–4 December 1945\n: Was: Hamilton Air Force Base (1947–1976)\n: Now: Part of the Hamilton Wetland Restoration Project\n: Known sub-bases and auxiliaries\n:: Montague Air Force Auxiliary Field\n:: Napa Army Airfield\n:: Willows Municipal Airport\n:: Redding Army Airfield\n:: Siskiyou County Army Airfield\n* Hammer Army Airfield,  northeast of Fresno\n: Joint Use with United States Navy (NATS)\n: 50th Air Base Squadron / 50th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron, 2 August 1941–31 March 1944\n: 450th Army Air Force Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Night Fighter), 1 April 1944–15 March 1946\n: Now:  Fresno Air National Guard Base\n: Known sub-bases and auxiliaries\n:: Salinas Army Air Base\n:: Delano Army Airfield\n:: Meadows Field\n:: Visalia Army Airfield\n:: Hayward Army Airfield\n* Lemoore Army Airfield,  southwest of Lemoore\n: Air Corps Basic Flying School / AAF Basic Flying School / AAF Pilot School, Basic; 30 November 1941–1 June 1944\n: 88th Air Base Squadron / 88th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron; 12 December 1941–30 April 1944\n: 3023rd Army Air Force Base Unit (Pilot School, Basic); 1 May 1944–1 June 1944\n: 461st Army Air Force Base Unit (Processing In); 1 June 1944–10 November 1945\n: Now: non-flying agricultural use.\n: Known sub-bases and auxiliaries\n:: Boston Field\n:: Huron Field\n:: Indian Field\n:: Murray Field\n:: West Field\n:: Summit Lake Field (Now NAS Lemoore)\n:: Helm Field\n:: Corcoran Municipal Airport\n:: Porterville Army Airfield\n:: Coalinga Municipal Airport (Old)\n* March Army Airfield,  southeast of Riverside\n: Base Headquarters and 4th Air Base Squadron; 1 September 1936–1 September 1940\n: 4th Air Base Group; 1 September 1940–15 January 1941\n: Air Base Squadron, 32nd Air Base Group / 31st Air Base Squadron / 31st Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron; 15 January 1941–31 March 1944\n: 420th Army Air Force Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Heavy Bombardment); 1 April 1944–31 March 1946\n: Was: March Air Force Base (1947–1993)\n: Now:  March Air Reserve Base\n: Known sub-bases and auxiliaries\n:: Buffalo Springs Airport\n:: Needles Army Airfield\n:: Shavers Summit Army Airfield\n* Marysville Army Airfield,  south of Marysville.\n: Now: Yuba County Airport\n* Muroc Army Airfield,  southeast of Mojave\n: 323rd Air Base Sq / 323rd Base Headquarters and Air Base Sq; 1 May 1942–31 March 1944\n: 421st Army Air Force Base Unit  (Combat Crew Training Station, Heavy Bombardment); 1 April 1944–16 October 1945\n: Now:  Edwards Air Force Base\n: Known sub-bases and auxiliaries\n:: Bishop Army Airfield\n:: Blythe Army Airfield\n:: Palmdale Army Airfield\n:: Desert Center Army Airfield\n:: Gary Army Airfield\n:: Rice Army Airfield\n:: Muroc Flight Test Base\n* Ontario Army Airfield,   east of Ontario\n: 311th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Ontario International Airport\n* Salinas Army Air Base,  southeast of Salinas\n: 301st Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron\n: Also used by Air Transport Command\n: Now: Salinas Municipal Airport\n: Known sub-bases and auxiliaries\n:: Half Moon Bay Flight Strip\n* Santa Maria Army Airfield, Santa Maria\n: 483d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Santa Maria Public Airport\n: Known sub-bases and auxiliaries\n:: Estrella Army Airfield\n* Santa Rosa Army Airfield,  northwest of Santa Rosa\n: 493d Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Charles M.
