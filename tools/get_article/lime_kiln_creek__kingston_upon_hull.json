It was blocked off during the construction of the Albert Dock in the 1860s.\nHistory\nThe creek takes its name from lime kilns which once stood in its vicinity.\nIt is thought that the creek was once the outlet of the River Hull before its flow was redirected eastwards along the Sayer Creek in early medieval times.\nThe creek was the site of a goods station and wharf (Lime Kiln Creek wharf) used by the Hull and Selby Railway and Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway from the 1840s onwards.\nThe Creek was stopped up as a result of the building of the West Dock (Albert Dock) in the 1860s. During the course of the excavations for the new dock a hoard of low value (halfpennies, less than 30% silver, copper base) coins from the reign of Edward I was found  below ground, near the creek.\nReferences"
