The President is the head of state whereas the Prime Minister is the head of government.\nDescription\nUnder Article 90 of the Constitution of the Third Republic, the government is composed of the Prime Minister, of ministers, of deputy ministers; and as the case may be, of deputy prime ministers, of ministers of state, and of minister delegates. The number of these ministers vary from one government to the next.\nThe government is headed by the Prime Minister, appointed by the President, from the political party, the group or the coalition that holds the majority of seats in the National Assembly, the lower chamber of Parliament.\nThe government is the effective executive arm of the state, in charge of all the country's main administration, in all the domains reserved to the central government by the constitution, and in all the domains in which the central government has concurrent jurisdiction with the provinces.\nThe government is accountable to the Parliament. Any individual member of the government, as well the entire government, can be censored by its lower-chamber, the National Assembly, through the vote of a motion of censure, or a motion of no-confidence. When the Prime minister is censured, the entire government is asked to step down.\nCurrent government\nThe current government is the Suminwa government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Judith Suminwa. Suminwa assumed office on 12 June 2024, and her cabinet was announced on 29 May 2024.\nGovernments since 2003\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Government || Start Date || End Date\n|-\n|Transitional Government\n|1 July 2003\n|31 December 2006\n|-\n|First Gizenga government\n|30 December 2006\n|25 November 2007\n|-\n|Second Gizenga government\n|25 November 2007\n|10 October 2008\n|-\n|First Muzito government\n|26 October 2008\n|19 February 2010\n|-\n|Second Muzito government\n|19 February 2010\n|11 September 2011\n|-\n|Third Muzito government\n|11 September 2011\n|6 March 2012\n|-\n|Matata government\n|6 March 2012\n|7 December 2014\n|-\n|Second Matata government\n|7 December 2014\n|14 November 2016\n|-\n|Badibanga government\n|19 December 2016\n|9 May 2017\n|-\n|Tshibala government\n|9 May 2017\n|6 September 2019\n|-\n|Ilunga government\n|6 September 2019\n|26 April 2021\n|-\n|Lukonde government\n|26 April 2021\n|12 June 2024\n|-\n|Suminwa government\n|12 June 2024\n|Present\n|}\nSee also\n* Heads of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nNotes and references\nExternal links\nOfficial site\n* [http://www.presidentrdc.cd/ The President of the Republic]\n(Much of this page is translated from the [http://fr.wikipedia.org French Wikipedia] version of this article)"
