Woodward, is a comic book artist known for illustrating the monthly series Fallen Angel, published by IDW Publishing.  Woodward has employed painting, digital assistance, as well as the more traditional pencil-and-ink and CMYK color method in his work.\nEarly life\nJames Kenneth Woodward was born in the Northeast United States.\nCareer\nWoodward considered either a career as a rock musician or artist. He ultimately chose the latter and moved to Los Angeles, where he spent some years experimenting with his artistic style. He subsequently followed the example of one of his idols, David Bowie, and moved to Germany, where he went into self-publishing, producing a comic book composed of his expressionist paintings called Flesh Angels. He followed this up with an anthology comedic series called These Things Happen.\nHe then relocated to Desert Hot Springs, California, where he collaborated with A. David Lewis on the independent comic book Mortal Coils, and with Michael Colbert on the Digital Webbing Presents series Crazy Mary, for which he continues to do covers. Crazy Mary was noticed by IDW Publishing, which offered him the job of illustrating a CSI: NY miniseries. He subsequently illustrated a story in Boom! Studios' Zombie Tales. When Peter David moved his series, Fallen Angel to IDW, Woodward was chosen as the regular artist.\nHis painted work eventually caught the attention of Marvel editor, Mike Marts, who hired him to illustrate X-Men Origins: The Beast, which was released September 2008.\nPersonal life\nAfter relocating from Desert Hot Springs to Long Beach, California, Woodward moved to Long Island City in Queens, New York.\nIn October 2012, Woodward and his wife lost their home and almost all of their belongings to Hurricane Sandy. He put his original artwork for the Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation miniseries up for sale in order to raise funds to recover.\nBibliography\n*Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2 – issue 8 of 8 (IDW); December 2012\n*Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2 – issue 7 of 8 (IDW); November 2012\n*Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2 – issue 6 of 8 (IDW); October 2012\n*Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2 – issue 5 of 8 (IDW); September 2012\n*Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2 – issue 4 of 8 (IDW); August 2012\n*Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2 – issue 3 of 8 (IDW); July 2012\n*Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2 – issue 2 of 8 (IDW); June 2012\n*Star Trek: The Next Generation/Doctor Who: Assimilation2 – issue 1 of 8 (IDW); May 2012\n*''Star Trek: Captain's Log – Pike (IDW); September 2010\n*Belladonna – graphic novel (IDW); February 2010\n*Weekly World News #1 cover-retail incentive (IDW); January 2010\n*Star Trek: Alien Spotlight – 4000 Throats (IDW); April 2009\n*More Digressions-paperback cover (Mad Norwegian Press); March 2009\n*Rogue Dragon-paperback cover (IDW); February 2009\n*Star Trek: The Last Generation #3 – Cover (IDW); December 2008\n*Necronomicon #4 – Cover (BOOM!
