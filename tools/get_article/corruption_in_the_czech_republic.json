The passage of anti-corruption laws is frequently delayed or obstructed by members of the governing coalition,” said Ondřej Kopečný, head of TI Czechia.\nTransparency International's 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index scored the Czech Republic at 56 on a scale from 0 (\"highly corrupt\") to 100 (\"very clean\"). When ranked by score, the Czech Republic ranked 46th among the 180 countries in the Index, where the country ranked first is perceived to have the most honest public sector. For comparison with regional scores, the best score among Western European and European Union countries  was 90, the average score was 64 and the worst score was 41. For comparison with worldwide scores, the best score was 90 (ranked 1), the average score was 43, and the worst score was 8 (ranked 180).\nAreas\nPolitical corruption\nA series of political corruption cases has damaged the image of Nečas’ administration (see corruption cases below), which is reflected in Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013, which reveals that 73% of the surveyed Czechs consider political parties to be “corrupt” or “extremely corrupt”.\nBusiness corruption\nAccording to Ernst & Young's 2012 Global Fraud Survey, 80% of surveyed companies perceive bribery and corruption to be widespread in the business sector, and fewer than 10% state that between 2009 and 2011 their companies “very frequently/always” conducted due diligence on fraud and corruption-related risks before or after acquiring a new business.\nAlthough the business environment is characterised by a clear set of rules and little interference, corruption remains an obstacle to doing business in public procurement, awarding of subsidies and direct interactions between public and private sectors.\nCorruption cases\nMiloslav Ludvík, a former Motol University Hospital director who served as Minister of Health from 2016 to 2017, is now among 16 individuals charged with bribery and fraud linked to construction contracts valued at over CZK 4 billion, underscoring a serious crackdown on corruption in the country’s healthcare system.\nIn Brno, several South Moravian officials have set up a well-functioning business to earn extra money on top of their salaries. Instead of punishing, officials helped road pirates in 2022.\nIn an alleged EU-subsidies fraud, former Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš was accused of illegally obtaining €2&nbsp;million in EU subsidies designated for small businesses by concealing his ownership of a farm and a convention center called \"Storks Nest\" (). Czech police requested that the Lower House lift his parliamentary immunity on two occasions, in September and November 2017. In both cases, the Lower House lifted the immunity and the police have initiated criminal proceedings. He is accused of the crime of alleged fraud (§212, Criminal Code, 2009) and of wilful damage to the financial interests of the European Union (§ 260, Criminal Code, 2009) in the criminal conspiracy (§ 89, Art. 17, Crime Code (the Czechoslovakian Criminal Code, 1961).\nOperation Dozimetr was a police operation in June 2022 related to the investigation of corruption at Prague City Hall linked primarily to  (DPP). After more than two years of monitoring, the Police of the Czech Republic carried out a mass raid on the Prague City Hall, at the headquarters of the Transport Enterprises of the Capital City of Prague and at dozens of other places. Eleven of the thirteen defendants were arrested, including the then Deputy Mayor of Prague, , a member of Mayors and Independents, or the influential Zlín businessman, , who is the alleged head of the group. The Group was accused, for example, of influencing the public contracts of the Transport Company of the Capital City of Prague (DPP), bribery and efforts to divest assets from DPP and other institutions.\nA case in 2009 involved Defence Minister Vlasta Parkanová overpaying for four aeroplanes in a 3.5 billion crown military contract. As a Member of Parliament, Parkanová was immune from criminal prosecution, however. Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek was also implicated in the case.\nIn June 2012, a former director of the entity in charge of allocating EU funds in the Liberec, Usti, and Labem regions was sentenced to 7.5 years imprisonment and a US$40,000 fine after being convicted of bribery in connection with the granting of EU funds.\nThe 2013 Czech political corruption scandal involved an anti-corruption raid, launched by the organised crime unit. It resulted in the arrest of the prime minister's chief of staff, Jana Nagyová, and seven others. The unit also confiscated approximately GBR 5 million in cash and 10&nbsp;kg of gold found in government offices, banks and private properties. The crimes are suspected to include bribery and abuse of power.\nThere are many corruption cases related to the railway company České dráhy.\nEnhancing Civil Society Participation\nCitizens' participation and the values of integrity, accountability, and transparency are crucial components of fighting corruption. It is important to develop programs and actions to change the cultural understanding of corruption and help citizens to act against abuses.\nPolice corruption\nSee also\n* Crime in the Czech Republic\n* International Anti-Corruption Academy\n* Group of States Against Corruption\n* International Anti-Corruption Day\n* ISO 37001 Anti-bribery management systems\n* United Nations Convention against Corruption\n* OECD Anti-Bribery Convention\n* Transparency International\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131222072233/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/czech-republic/snapshot.aspx Czech Republic Corruption Profile] from the Business Anti-Corruption Portal"
