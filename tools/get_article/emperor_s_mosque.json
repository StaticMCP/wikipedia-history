Completed in 1457 CE, it was the first mosque built after the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia. Built in the classical Ottoman style, it is the largest single-subdome mosque in the country.\nIt was built by Isaković-Hranušić who dedicated it to the Sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror, the conqueror of Constantinople.

Side rooms were added in 1800 and connected to the central prayer area in 1848. Between 1980 and 1983, the painted decorations in the interior of the mosque were conserved and restored. The burial ground (graveyard) beside the Emperor's Mosque contains the graves of viziers, mullahs, imams, muftis, sheikhs, the employees in the Emperor's Mosque, along with other prominent figures living in Sarajevo.\nThe mosque was damaged during World War II but mostly in the wars during the 1990s, and renovation work was completed in 2020.\nThe first settlements in Sarajevo were built around the mosque with the residence of the Sultan's representatives than being built next to the mosque.
