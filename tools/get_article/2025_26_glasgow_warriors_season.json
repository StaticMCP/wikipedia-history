French side ASM Clermont Auvergne. As the South African side are in the same domestic league as the Warriors, they do not play each other in the group stage.\nHead Coach Franco Smith said of the draw:\nTo be drawn against heavyweights and previous champions provides our squad with a chance to test themselves against some of the best this competition has to offer.\nToulouse and Saracens have won this competition nine times between them, with both outfits regularly featuring in the knockout stages and challenging for silverware.\nAdd to that Clermont, who have been in European finals and lifted the Challenge Cup before, and Sale Sharks, who have been one of the top teams in England for the last few years, we know that we will be challenged by each of our opponents. It is a challenge we look forward to.\nTo be challenged at that level is something that excites everyone at this club and we're excited to go head-to-head with the best in Europe.\nPool matches\n|score =\n|report =\n|away =  Glasgow Warriors\n|try1 =\n|con1 =\n|pen1 =\n|drop1 =\n|try2 =\n|con2 =\n|pen2 =\n|drop2 =\n|stadium = Salford Community Stadium, Manchester\n|attendance =\n|referee =\n}}\n|score =\n|report =\n|away =  Toulouse\n|try1 =\n|con1 =\n|pen1 =\n|drop1 =\n|try2 =\n|con2 =\n|pen2 =\n|drop2 =\n|stadium = Scotstoun Stadium, Glasgow\n|attendance =\n|referee =\n}}\n|score =\n|report =\n|away =  Glasgow Warriors\n|try1 =\n|con1 =\n|pen1 =\n|drop1 =\n|try2 =\n|con2 =\n|pen2 =\n|drop2 =\n|stadium = Stade Marcel-Michelin, Clermont\n|attendance =\n|referee =\n}}\n|score =\n|report =\n|away =  Saracens\n|try1 =\n|con1 =\n|pen1 =\n|drop1 =\n|try2 =\n|con2 =\n|pen2 =\n|drop2 =\n|stadium = Scotstoun Stadium, Glasgow\n|attendance =\n|referee =\n}}\nWarrior of the month awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Award\n! style=\"width:300px;\"|Winner\n|-\n!
