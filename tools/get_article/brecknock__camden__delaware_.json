The house is in four sections; two of brick and two frame. The original one-room house possibly dates before 1700 and is constructed of brick.  A brick section was added in the 1740s.  The -story, frame, main house was added in the mid-18th century and abuts the second brick section.  The final frame section was added in the 1880s and is a four-room apartment originally built for the wagon driver, but later incorporated into the house.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
