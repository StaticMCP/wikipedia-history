It was one of the first battles of Slovakia with the Red Army.\nThe Battle\nThe Soviet defense on the cross of the San River was the unit of the 10th Fortified area of 12th Army. The defense of Lypovets was led by 44th Rifle Division under the command of General Semyon Tkachenko. This division consisted of two fresh regiments (305th and 319th) and part of two infantry regiments already exhausted by the fighting (25th and 295th). Its combat role was to delay the advance of the enemy.\nThe Mobile Brigade, with fewer than 5,000 soldiers, 43 tanks and 123 guns, managed to occupy Lypovets, but then the brigade ran into the 44th Rifle Division of the Red Army. Because the Slovak tanks had run out of fuel, the Slovak soldiers came under heavy pressure and the catastrophe was avoided by artillery support, which managed to decimate the Soviets enough to allow the Slovak soldiers to retreat.\nThe Slovak Rychlá brigáda lost 5 tanks: three  LT vz. 35, one LT vz. 38 and one LT vz. 40. Plus one OA vz.30 armored car.\nAftermath\nThe Slovaks suffered 261 casualties: 75 killed, 167 wounded, 2 POWs and 17 MIA, while the Soviets had 600 killed and 1000 wounded. The Rýchla brigáda had not had enough force to defeat a stronger enemy in pre-prepared positions. The reluctance of Slovak soldiers to fight against the Soviet Union was also manifested by the first defectors to the Soviet side, who were reported missing in official reports. The mechanical staff had enough technical means to repair all of the battalion vehicles, but under the influence of anti-fascist and pro-Czechoslovak officers, they had withdrawn all vehicles and the whole battalion to Slovakia on the pretext that they can not be repaired under field conditions. The rest of the brigade was assigned to the German 295. Infanterie-Division.\nReferences\nReferences\nThis article uses a translation of the text of the  on the czech Wikipedia.\nLiterature\n* MIČIANIK, P.: Slovenská armáda v ťažení proti Sovietskemu zväzu I.
