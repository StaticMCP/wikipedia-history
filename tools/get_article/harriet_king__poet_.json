A. Baillie Hamilton and Lady Harriet Hamilton, sister of the Duke of Abercorn. In 1864, she married banker and publisher Henry Samuel King. She lived at the Manor House, Chigwell, Essex, all her married life, but after her husband's death in 1878 she moved with her children to another part of the country. Her strong sympathy for Mazzini and the cause of Italian unification inspired a number of her works. She was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1890 by Cardinal Henry Edward Manning.\nWorks\n*Aspromonte and Other Poems (1869)\n*The Disciples (1873)\n*A Book of Dreams (1883)\n*The Sermon in the Hospital (from The Disciples) (1885)\n*Ballads of the North and Other Poems (1889)\n*The Prophecy of Westminster and Other Poems: in Honour of Henry Edward, Cardinal Manning (1895)\n*The Hours of the Passion and Other Poems (1902)\n*Letters and Recollections of Mazzini (1912)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*Alfred H.
