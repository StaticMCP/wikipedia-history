It is a federally designated National Heritage Area, extending for  from Larimer County in the west where the river emerges from the Rocky Mountains, and ends near Greeley, Colorado, just before its confluence with the South Platte River.  The designation provides a framework for the promotion and interpretation of the area's cultural and historic character, and the preservation of the natural and built environment, and is administered by the Poudre Heritage Alliance.\nSignificant historic and cultural resources include the Greeley No. 3 Ditch and the Bellvue Hydrological Laboratory, which were instrumental in the development of a means to deliver regulated irrigation water to farms and towns in the western United States.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120331041438/http://www.poudreheritage.org/index.htm Cache La Poudre River Corridor] at the Poudre Heritage Alliance\n* [https://www.nps.gov/places/cache-la-poudre-river-national-heritage-area.htm Cache La Poudre River Corridor] at the National Park Service"
