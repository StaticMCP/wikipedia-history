Edward Foley and his wife Eliza Maria Foley Hodgetts and elder brother of John Hodgetts Hodgetts-Foley and inherited the Stoke Edith estate from his father in 1803. He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford (1809) and appointed High Sheriff of Herefordshire for 1815–16.\nFoley was one of the Members of Parliament (MP) for Ludgershall from 1826 to 1832 and for Herefordshire from 1832 to 1841.\nFamily\nHe married in 1832 Lady Emily Graham daughter of James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, but died childless in 1846. His widow survived him until 1901. Foley's will enabled his widow to dispose of the Stoke Edith estate as she wished, but she declined to use that power, enabling her husband's great nephew Paul Henry Foley of Prestwood, Staffordshire, the grandson of John Hodgetts Hodgetts-Foley (her husband's brother), to inherit the estate.\nSee also\n* Foley v Hill\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
