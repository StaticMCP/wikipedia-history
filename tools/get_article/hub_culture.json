It was founded in 2002, and is located in Bermuda.\nHistory\nHub Culture is named after Stan Stalnaker's book Hub Culture: The Next Wave of Urban Consumers about tech nomads.\nAs of July 2025, Hub Culture claimed to have 55,000 members.\nVen\nLaunched in July 2007, Stalnaker says it is a Digital currency used by members of Hub Culture to buy, share and trade knowledge, goods and services. Members can use Ven at any 'Pavilion' or for micropayments online. The value of Ven is determined by Hub Culture's pricing algorithm, which says it uses currencies, commodities and carbon futures in a weighted calculation. It used to trade against other currencies at floating exchange rate.  Global pricing for Ven was briefly provided by Thomson Reuters.\nPavilions\nHub Culture operates temporary popup 'Pavilions' as live event social networking spaces powered by the digital platform. Temporary locations have included Copenhagen to coincide with COP15, Cancún to coincide with COP16, Durban for COP17, Sharm el-Sheikh at COP27, Dubai at COP28 and Baku, Azerbaijan at COP29.\nBetween 2009 and 2025 temporary Pavilions were opened each year in Davos, Switzerland, during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting. \"Hub Maison\" opened in New York City for New York Fashion Week in a fashion oriented collaboration with Sportmax. The New York Pavilion became the first Pavilion to offer contemporary retail fashion selections for sale in digital currency. In May 2010, Hub Culture opened the Cannes Clubhouse, a venue tied to the 63rd Cannes Film Festival in collaboration with Grey Goose. A private island in Croatia and Bali villa project also use Ven as a means of exchange.  The 2011 Davos Pavilion presented the first vehicles available for sale in Ven. In 2012, portions of the Davos Pavilion became the first in Europe to be powered by zero-emission energy from the Nissan Leaf using the Leaf-to-Home energy system.\nIn the summer of 2017, during the 35th America's Cup Hub Culture opened several shipping containers as part of a popup campus at Ariel Sands in Bermuda that the company claimed features integration of artificial intelligence, digital currency, digital identity and blockchain auditing in a retail environment.
