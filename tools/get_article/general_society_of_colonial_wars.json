The General Society of Colonial Wars was organized in 1893, in the Governor's Room, City Hall, New York, by delegates from five States and the District of Columbia. A Constitution was adopted on May 10, 1893. There are now thirty-two constituent state societies.\nThe first General Court met 19 December 1892, the anniversary date of the Great Swamp Fight of King Philip's War in 1675, it was announced that the Society had one hundred and five members.\nThe total membership of state societies has for many years remained in the range of 4,000 to 4,500.  Approximately 21,000 men have joined the organization during its history, including many prominent Americans.\nThe Society has long sought to improve public awareness of the importance of colonial events and individuals in the shaping of America. A number of monuments, plaques, and other markers have been installed by the Society at prevenient sites.  The Society also funds research and educational initiatives of colonial relevance.\nIn recent years, the goal of improving understanding of the colonial period has additionally been addressed by Samuel Victor Constant Fellowships, awarded annually for postgraduate study of colonial American history.\nMembership\nTo be eligible for membership in the Society an individual must be a male over age 18 who is lineally descendant from a person who served either in a military capacity or held public office in one of the original 13 colonies prior to the American Revolution.\nSpecifically, the period from the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia on 13 May 1607, to the Battle of Lexington on 19 April 1775, and to limit qualifying ancestral service to those ancestors who served under the authority of the Colonies.\nNotable members\nGovernment officials\n* Sherman Adams – Governor of New Hampshire and White House Chief of Staff.\n* Thomas R.
