      "text": "# Steamtown Heritage Rail Centre\n\nThe Steamtown Heritage Rail Centre (\"Centre\") is a static railway museum based in the former railway workshops located in Peterborough, South Australia.\nPeterborough was the administrative and service centre for the Peterborough Division of the South Australian Railways, employing up to 1,500 people in the workshops during its heyday. The railway workshops covered an extensive area mainly to the west of the township, and it is in these original buildings that the exhibits are displayed.\nThe turntable and roundhouse are the main features of the exhibit.\nThe turntable is unusual in that it accommodates three rail gauges: Narrow gauge (), standard gauge () and broad gauge (). In Australia there were only two similar turntables (located at Port Pirie and Gladstone); all three were on the same line, with the one at Peterborough the only one remaining. This unique situation arose from the standardisation project of the late 1960s. At this time the broad gauge line was extended from Terowie to Peterborough and the Port Pirie to Broken Hill section (passing through Peterborough) was replaced by standard gauge line. The Peterborough to Quorn section remained narrow gauge.\n]]\nHistory\nPrior to  the cessation of railway operations by Steamtown Peterborough Railway Preservation Society in June 2002, a steering committee, made up of the Federation of North East Councils, the Northern Regional Development Board, and the Flinders Ranges Area Consultative Committee, as well as Society representatives, was established. This led to a project to formalise development of the workshops precinct, which in turn led to the development of the Steamtown Heritage Rail Centre.\nDevelopment\nConsiderable effort was put into improving the grounds and the presentation of the displays, including interpretive signage.\nIt was hoped that Garratt 402 could return from the Zig Zag Railway in Lithgow; however, negotiations were discontinued. Garratt 402 was the only member of its class which travelled the entire Quorn Line.\nA reception centre, which includes offices, a souvenir shop and a cafe, was built just off Main Street, at the north-eastern corner of the 1960s-vintage diesel workshop.\nOpening\nThe Steamtown Heritage Rail Centre was officially opened on 29 November 2009 to much fanfare from the South Australian premier, Mike Rann.\nServices\nThe centre is open seven days a week; an entry fee is charged.\nGuided tours, lasting about an hour and a half, provide a narrative of the equipment displayed, the infrastructure on site and its social history as well as exploring amusing railway anecdotes and experiences.\nAfter the centre's opening, technical difficulties limited the availability of the planned sound and light show; but after considerable work to resolve the issues the show is now considered a huge success, operating most nights, dependent only on bookings. The sound and light show has contributed to an increase in the number of overnight stays in the town, which benefits the other tourist attractions and the town in general.\nThe centre had accreditation as a rail-transport operator to run its motor inspection car, MIC 127, between the centre and the former goods platform in Peterborough yard, though this is rarely done.\nOperation\nThe centre has been operated by a staff of volunteers sourced from the local community in conjunction with a paid manager and a receptionist.\nThrough a skills-development program run in association with the local high school, students assisted with the refurbishment of a sheep wagon and a miniature train. One of these students, Ben Graefe, who also runs tours at the centre, won a Rotary Pride in Workmanship 2010 Award for his efforts.\nThe centre was planned to be cost-neutral to the council within seven years; however, attendances to both tours and its Sound and Light show were such that it was expected to break even within two to three years. It was expecting to achieve a visitation rate of 15,000 by the end of the 2011-2012 financial year.\nthe Steamtown Heritage Rail Centre and Peterborough Visitor Centre are closed owing to the District Council's financial position. It is hoped that they will be reopened in time for the 2026 tourist season, under a new operating model.\nRadium Hill Museum\nThe historic Radium Hill mine site near Olary is closed to the public, but the  Radium Hill Museum was relocated to the rear of the Peterborough Steamtown Heritage Centre.\nAwards\nOctober 2010 the Centre won an Advantage SA award, in the Regional Tourism category for Yorke and Mid North Region\nDuring October 2012, the Centre won an Advantage SA award, in the Regional Tourism category\n2014 Steamtown won the SA Regional Award for Tourism\n2015 Steamtown won the Hall of Fame Award for Tourism in the region of Yorke and Mid North\nClosure\nMounting debt and limited funding sources contributed to the Centre closing its doors in August 2025. The District Council is proposing to reopen Steamtown for the 2026 Tourist season\n* List of Australian heritage railways\n* Rail gauge in Australia\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* McNicol, S.; Mannion, J.
