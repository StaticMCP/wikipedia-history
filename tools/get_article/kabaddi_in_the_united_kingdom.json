The British Kabaddi League is the main kabaddi competition in the UK, and is played annually. The 2025 Kabaddi World Cup will be hosted in the West Midlands region of England.\nHistory\nKabaddi was first promoted to a significant extent in the UK when it was shown on Channel 4 in the 1990s. The growth of the South Asian community in the UK has also grown the sport.
