Following the development of the vinyl LP record by Columbia Records in 1948, Decca issued a plethora of Crosby albums in that format. Many were simply reissues of earlier 78rpm albums but Top o' the Morning / Emperor Waltz appears to be the first 10\" LP not to have been issued as a 78rpm album. As the four songs from Top o' the Morning only filled one side of the LP, Decca added the four songs from the successful Bing Crosby – The Emperor Waltz'' 78 rpm album to complete the record.\nReception\nBillboard reviewed the songs from “Top o’ the Morning” when they were issued as singles, saying:\nOh, ‘Tis Sweet to Think\nBing and the fem lead from “Top o’ the Morning” do an art song—lyrics by Thomas Moore—charmingly. Not for the masses.\nThe Donovans\nMore from the score—and as Irish as Barry Fitzgerald’s phiz. Special stuff—may appeal in the Gaelic nabes.\nYou’re in Love with Someone\nA Burke-Van Heusen pop from “Top o’ the Morning” gets the tender treatment from Bing.\nTop o’ the Morning\nIrish and quaint as all get-out is the title tune, a small lesson in Gaelic a la Berlitz.\nTrack listing\nRecording dates follow song titles.\nReferences"
