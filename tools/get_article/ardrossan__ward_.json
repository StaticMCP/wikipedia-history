Created in 2022, the ward elects three councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 10,359 people.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the 2019 Reviews of Electoral Arrangements which were instigated following the implementation of the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018. Ardrossan was formed from three previous wards, taking in the mainland area from the former Ardrossan and Arran ward – the Isle of Arran being given its own ward – as well as an area of Ardrossan which was part of the former Saltcoats ward and a rural area from the former Dalry and West Kilbride ward. The ward centres around the town of Ardrossan taking in an area in the west of mainland North Ayrshire on the Firth of Clyde and includes the uninhabited Horse Isle.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=6|Councillors\n|-\n!2022\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Tony Gurney(SNP)\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Stewart Ferguson(Conservative)\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Amanda Kerr(Labour)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\nNotes\nReferences"
