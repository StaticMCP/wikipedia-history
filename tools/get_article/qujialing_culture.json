Named after its type site in Jingshan County, Hubei, it succeeded the Daxi culture (5000–3300 BC) and reached southern Shaanxi, northern Jiangxi, and southwest Henan. The culture represents a significant development in Neolithic society, characterized by large-scale fortified settlements, advanced agriculture, and specialized craftsmanship. Artefact types unique to the culture include ceramic balls and painted spindle whorls, the latter inherited by the succeeding Shijiahe culture.\nLocation, dating, discovery history, and environmental context\nThe Qujialing site, located in the Jianghan Plain of Hubei, was first identified in the 1950s, with initial excavations conducted from 1955 to 1957. The culture’s timeline spans approximately 3400–2500 BC, with some scholars suggesting that earlier evidence (3400–3000 BC) may belong to the final phase of the Daxi culture. Geographically, it thrived in the middle Yangtze region, bordered by the Dabie Mountains to the west, Dongting Lake to the north, the Three Gorges to the east, and the Nanyang Basin to the south. Most sites are located north of the Yangtze between modern Yichang and Wuhan, with some extending southwest to the southern bank of the river. These lowland sites, situated on slightly elevated terrain amidst plains and low hills, were ideal for agriculture and facilitated trade via the Yangtze.\nThe region was historically dominated by wetlands, rivers, lakes, and marshes, with settlements built on raised ground to avoid flooding. Archaeological evidence from the shores of Dongting Lake, recently embanked for farmland, reveals stilted structures from the Pengtoushan culture and Daxi culture, indicating a subtropical environment with deciduous and evergreen forests. Algae remains suggest periodic flooding. The climate was warm and humid during the culture’s early phases but became drier, transitioning to grasslands and scrub, which coincided with reduced human activity.\nSubsistence\nAgriculture in the region has deep roots, with evidence of rice cultivation dating back to the Daxi culture. Early rice farming relied on drainage systems, but by the third millennium BC, irrigated rice paddies emerged, as seen at the Chengtoushan site with its reservoirs. The Qujialing culture cultivated Oryza sativa (Asian rice), Setaria italica (foxtail millet), and Panicum miliaceum (common millet), alongside vegetables, amaranths, and plants now considered weeds.\nEmergence of fortified settlements\nThe Qujialing culture marked a significant population increase, with the establishment of large, often circular, fortified settlements, some reaching 263 ha compared to the Daxi culture’s largest site, Chengtoushan (6–8 ha). These fortifications, likely serving defensive purposes, reflect the rise of early states and inter-city rivalries. The Qujialing site features a central urban area of 70 ha enclosed by a moat 25–30 m wide and 3 m deep, surrounded by ten residential zones and additional dwellings beyond the moat. Originating as a small Daxi-era village, it grew into a fortified agglomeration by the late Qujialing phase. City walls, man-made water systems, large courtyard buildings, and residential sites were also found, indicating advanced urban planning.\nCraftsmanship, funerary practices, and symbolism\nQujialing ceramics, building on Daxi traditions, incorporated Yangshao and Dawenkou influences, introducing wheel-thrown vessels like bowls (wan), plates (dou), and jars (guan), reflecting increased productivity by specialized potters. Funerary urns were common, accompanied by diverse vessels like cups (bei), with some tombs containing up to 20 pots or red and yellow lacquered wares. Early copper objects, the southernmost found in Neolithic China, appeared at Dengjiawan. The remains of chickens, dogs, pigs, sheep, and fish were discovered in ten storage pits, alongside eggshell pottery, tripods, ceramic balls, and painted spindle whorls, showcasing the culture’s diverse craftsmanship.\nDecline\nBy 2000 BC, fortifications were no longer maintained, and the population declined significantly, unlike the abrupt collapse of the Liangzhu culture. Some sites show traces of the Longshan culture from the Central Plain.\nCharacteristic artifacts\nFile:Qujialing Culture Skeleton & Burial Vessels.jpg|Burial with funerary pottery, Luoshishan, Huanggang\nFile:Qujialing pottery and stone axes.jpg|Black pottery and polished stone axes, Qujiapo cemetery\nFile:Qujialing Pottery Ritual Vessels.jpg|Ceramic funerary vessels\nSee also\n}}|||}}\n* Neolithic Chinese ceramics\n* Neolithic China\n* Geography of China\n* Chinese art\n* Prehistory of China\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
