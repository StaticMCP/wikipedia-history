In the , Samsonvale had a population of 674 people.\nGeography\nThe district is dominated by Lake Samsonvale, the waters of North Pine Dam, one of the three main water-suppliers to the metropolitan region. Samsonvale sits below the highest peak in the area, Mount Samson.\nHistory\nSamsonvale was occupied by the indigenous people, who named the area Tukuwompa.\nBritish settlement of Samsonvale began with the Samsonvale pastoral run established in 1845 by the Joyner family and the locality takes its name from the pastoral run. The nearby suburb of Joyner is named after the family.\nThe history of Samsonvale is one of forced resumptions with three quarters of the Joyner's original pastoral run in the 1860s being taken from them.\nSamsonvale Provisional School opened on 1 June 1875. It closed in 1880. It was located \"100 yards north of the Presbyterian Church\" (approx ).\nPresbyterian church services were originally held in the provisional school, a slab hut. After the school closed, local people raised funds and built a church using timber from the immediately surrounding area in 1884, which officially opened on Sunday 25 January 1885 by the Reverend A. Macintosh. The church was built on land donated by the Gold family and was located at the end of Gold Scrub Lane (). The church was renovated in 1913. Although the church site was not inundated by the North Pine Dam, the loss of farm land due to the dam resulted in many members of the congregation leaving the district from 1957 onwards. Without a viable congregation, the church closed in 1969. The building was purchased by the Dam Construction Authority and was demolished in 1973. A memorial was placed on the church site.\nIn 1918, the Dayboro railway line reached Samford with the Samford railway station opening on 1 July 1918; the line would finally reach its terminus at Dayboro railway station on 25 September 1920. In 1955, the line closed from Ferny Grove to Dayboro, closing the Samford railway station. The remaining Ferny Grove railway line is now only a passenger service within the City of Brisbane with Ferny Grove railway station being the closest rail connection from Samford.\nSamsonvale was predominantly a dairy farming community centred on a station on the Dayboro railway line.\nThe North Pine Dam was built between 1968 and 1974 and required the resumption of 105 family homes. The flooding of the impoundment, Lake Samsonvale, also closed the Presbyterian Church, community hall, and post office.\nAll that remains today at the site of the old village is a cemetery with much of the former district underwater, along with the original Samsonvale pastoral run.\nThe current Samsonvale Rural Fire Brigade facility sits above what was once the centre of the Kobble Creek community.\nIn 2006, during a drought seeing water levels of Lake Samsonvale falling to unprecedented lows, archeological works were considered by the local council to preserve historic artifacts from flooded homesteads dating back to the 19th Century. In 2010 Lake Samsonvale was once again filled to capacity, covering the historical sites and much of the district's best farming land.\nDemographics\nIn the , Samsonvale recorded a population of 555 people, 49.2% female and 50.8% male.
