The young Charles followed his father into the navy at the age of 13, passing through every commissioned rank in the service to eventually be made an admiral of the Royal Navy.\nIn addition to his distinguished naval record, Admiral Patey was also appointed administrator of Lagos, and of the Gambia, as well as serving as Governor of Saint Helena between 1869 and 1873. In recognition of his services Admiral Patey was awarded the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1874.\nAdmiral Patey died in 1881 at Newton St Loe, a small village just outside Bath. Six officers acted as pallbearers at the funeral, among them three admirals.\nSee also\n*\nReferences\n*"
