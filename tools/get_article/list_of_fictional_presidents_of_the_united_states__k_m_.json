They are elected over Republican incumbent William Howard Taft and Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson. However, on December 19, 1912, Roosevelt is assassinated at the Union Stockyards in Chicago, Illinois by Annie Oakley when personally breaking a labor strike with the help of the Rough Riders. With this being less than three months before the inauguration, Kane is inaugurated as the 28th president on March 4, 1913, as a result.\n* He brings the US into World War I after the RMS Titanic sinks on October 9, 1914.\n* Reelected in 1916 over Taft and Wilson (who is assassinated in February 1917, possibly by Kane's agents).\n* Kane's policies cause great unrest and he is overthrown and executed by a communist revolution.\n* Serves as the analog to Russian Tzar Nicholas II.\n* Party: Progressive\nPresident Florentyna Kane\n* President in: The Prodigal Daughter and Shall We Tell the President?\n* Kane (née Rosnovski) becomes the first woman president after her predecessor dies of a heart attack while jogging.\n* Party: Democratic\nPresident Rufus Kane\n*President in: The Life of Mary Marlin (1930s radio show)\n*Asks Iowa Senator Mary Marlin to marry him\nPresident Kang\n* President in: \"Treehouse of Horror VII\" (The Simpsons)\n* Kang is elected president in 1996 after he and his companion Kodos capture and impersonate presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Bob Dole when informed by Homer Simpson of that year's presidential election.\n* After accidentally ejecting both the real Clinton and Dole into deep space while trying to rescue them, Homer exposes the two aliens to the world. However, Kang and Kodos declare that the two-party system meant that the people still have to vote for one of them, scoffing at one bystander's suggestion of voting for a third-party candidate instead (much to Ross Perot's chagrin).\n* Shortly after his election, Kang enslaves humanity (or at least the population of the United States) and orders the construction of a death ray to be aimed at a planet that \"nobody's ever heard of\".\n* Played by: Harry Shearer (voice)\n* Party: Republican.\nPresident Roberto Katze\n* President in: Toaru Majutsu no Index by Kazuma Kamachi\n* He is the third Hispanic President.\n* Party: Unknown\nPresident Ed Kealty\n* President in: The Teeth of the Tiger by Tom Clancy\n* Ed Kealty took over the presidency after President Robby Jackson was assassinated. Kealty previously failed to secure the presidency when he tried to say he never officially resigned after the events of Debt of Honor's final pages.\n* Party: Democratic\nPresident Elizabeth Keane\n* President-elect, later president in: Homeland\n* First female to be elected president, replacing President Morse.\n* Native of Lake Placid and former junior senator from New York.\n* Divorced from Aaron Keane, an anthropologist.\n* Votes in favor of the Iraq War, but later develops anti-war sentiments after her son Andrew Keane died during the conflict.\n* Runs for president in 2016. She nominated her former primary challenger Ralph Warner as her running mate, who later becomes her vice president.\n* Evacuated to a safehouse after a terrorist attack in Midtown Manhattan takes place near her transition offices, but later returns against the advice of the Secret Service.\n* Survives two assassination attempts orchestrated by rogue elements of the US government, the United States Army and the United States Intelligence Community. She is subjected to a smear campaign intended to discredit her before her inauguration or to force her resignation, with rogue intelligence officers and conservative talk-show host Brett O'Keefe spreading misinformation via bots that Andrew Keane died while deserting (instead of trying to save his wounded comrades). As a result of the attempts on her life, Keane becomes the first president to be inaugurated behind closed doors.\n* She later develops severe paranoia as a result of the attempts on her life, which culminates in her administration extending the PATRIOT Act and using the new provisions to carry out a mass arrest of government and intelligence officials she suspected conspired against her, detaining many without probable cause. This move causes her administration to be investigated by Arizona Senator Sam Paley, who desires to appoint a special prosecutor with regard to her actions.\n* She personally advocates that General Jamie McClendon, one of the main conspirators in her assassination attempt, should be given the death penalty during his court martial, and is infuriated upon hearing he is only given life imprisonment.\n* Keane orders O'Keefe's arrest, but he flees, continuing to broadcast his talk show whilst on the run. The manhunt ends in O'Keefe's arrest following a deadly shootout between the FBI and a family of anti-Keane O'Keefe fans in backwoods Virginia.\n* Her administration is later targeted by information warfare masterminded by the Russian government and the GRU in an attempt to trigger a constitutional crisis and to discredit and remove her from office. This campaign implicates her White House Chief of Staff David Wellington in the death of General McClendon, and leverages the Paley investigation by feeding him false information, and by manipulating Carrie Mathison, aggrieved by Keane's actions against the Intelligence Community, into presenting a fabricated link between Wellington and McClendon's death.\n* Machinations by Paley and Warner result in them attempting to get the Cabinet of the United States to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Keane from office, arguing that her poor management shows she is unable to discharge the duties of the office. Keane attempts to circumvent this by firing certain members of the cabinet, but the Supreme Court of the United States rules that the method she employed to fire them was unlawful, and that they can remain. The 25th Amendment is officially invoked: Keane is removed and Warner takes over.\n* She is reinstated after testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee by Russian agent Simone Martin absolves Keane of any wrongdoing, and fully reveals the extent of the Russian interference in her administration. However, knowing that her reputation has been tainted in the public eye and that the American people need a leader they can trust to save American democracy, she resigns in favor of Warner.\n* Secret Service codename: Big Apple\n* Political Party: Implied to be Democratic\n* Played by: Elizabeth Marvel\nPresident Matthew Keating\n* President in: The Presidents Daughter by Bill Clinton and James Patterson\n* A former Navy SEAL who was medically discharged after surviving a helicopter crash in Afghanistan that shattered his hip.\n* After leaving the service, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives for Texas's 7th district, where he served on the House Financial Services Committee.\n* Became the running mate to Senator Martin Lovering on his presidential campaign, which divided the Party.\n* Became the president after President Lovering's death of an aortic aneurysm.\n* Served less than a full term; became the first president in American history to be defeated in the primary by his own vice president, Pamela Barnes.\n* Married to Professor (Dr.) Samantha Keating, an archaeologist by trade; together, they have a daughter, Melanie R. \"Mel\" Keating, who was a teenager during her father's presidential term.\n* Inherited from President Lovering his Chief of Staff Jack Lyon, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Horace McCoy, National Security Advisor Sandra Powell, and Secretary of Defense Pridham Collum; later nominated and appointed, among others, retired Army Brigadier General Sarah Palumbo the Deputy National Security Advisor for the National Security Council, Lisa Blair as the Director of the FBI, and Kimberly Bouchard as Secretary of the Air Force.\n* After the completion of his term, retired to New Hampshire where he is assisted by his Chief of Staff Madeline Perry and the Special Agent-in-Charge of his Secret Service detail David Stahl.\n* Plans to run against incumbent President Pamela Barnes in the next Presidential Primary Election.\nPresident John Keeler\n* 45th President in: 24\n* Played by: Geoffrey Pierson\n* 2005–2006\n* Keeler is elected after President David Palmer withdrew from the race.

When the court is about to vote in Mackenzie's favour, he orchestrates a bombing of the building which seriously injures the Chief Justice, whose swing vote in the decision had yet to be announced.\n* After the Supreme Court bombing, the capital falls into chaos as infighting between United States Armed Forces factions loyal to Bennett and others to Mackenzie battle one another to take control. US Army and Secret Service officers loyal to Bennett are able to lock down and infiltrate the White House, capturing and detaining a defiant Mackenzie in the Oval Office.\n* As Bennett is about to address the nation, video footage of the now conscious Chief Justice is broadcast on all networks and cell phones, in which he confirms his vote in Mackenzie's favour, shifting the decision to 5–4 and rendering her the legal president.

The initial result was close and unclear, with recounts and firebombing of voting centres making a definitive result impossible for the media to define.\n*Roman and his brother Kendall, following the death of Logan, had ATN call the election for Mencken to force matters to a head, as they sought Mencken's backing for their takeover bid of ATN vs. tech guru Lukas Mattsson.\n*Assuming the title of President-elect despite no sufficient, official declaration of results, Mencken nevertheless betrayed the Roy's by allying with Mattsson in return for an 'American CEO' of Waystar Royco.\n*Played by: Justin Kirk\n*Party: Republican\nPresident William Menen\n* President in: Dagger by William Mason\n* Target of a complex assassination plot developed by the Soviets and led by his chief of staff and vice president\nPresident Albert M.

He receives the nomination when former Secretary of State William Russell throws his support behind him in order to prevent Senator Joe Cantwell from receiving it.\nPresident Selina Meyer\n* 45th and 47th President of the United States in Veep (Season 3–5, 7)\n* Born Selina Catherine Eaton.\n* Married, and later divorced Andrew Meyer, the father of her daughter, Catherine.\n* Former Senator from Maryland who loses in her party's presidential primary to Stuart Hughes, and then becomes Hughes' running mate and eventual vice president.\n* She was initially sidelined within the Hughes administration, forced to abandon many of her initiatives including Senate filibuster reform and a Clean Jobs Bill at the behest of the president. She gained more influence after successfully campaigning during the 2014 midterm elections and ends up announcing her candidacy for president in 2016 after Hughes decides not to run again due to a spy scandal that threatened impeachment. She adopts the campaign slogan \"Continuity with Change\".\n* After Hughes resigns to care for his mentally ill wife, Meyer is inaugurated as the first female president, and appoints Senator Andrew Doyle as her vice president.\n* During her eight-month-long tenure, she proposed to introduce a far-reaching subsidized childcare program via the Families First Bill (also known as the Mommy Meyer Bill), funded through the scrapping of an outdated nuclear defense system costing $50,000,000,000. However, Congressional opposition due to the potential jobs losses this would incur, an accidental pledge to increase nuclear defense spending by $10,000,000,000 made during Meyer's inaugural State of the Union address after President Hughes' speech had been loaded onto a teleprompter by mistake, and public hostility to the bill led the White House to secretly lobby against it so that Meyer could win the upcoming election. During a congressional inquiry launched by Representative Moyes (who received the same information package from lobbyists Amy Brookheimer and Dan Egan and White House staffers Jonah Ryan and Richard Splett), Leigh Patterson, a former White House aide scapegoated for a Medileaks scandal, alleged that the 2016 Meyer campaign used confidential information for targeted campaigning aimed at bereaved parents, which Richard Splett accidentally confirmed. Communications Director Bill Ericsson was scapegoated for both the data breach and the use of lobbyists against the Families First Bill.\n* She narrowly wins her party's nomination and selects Senator Tom James as her running mate to replace Doyle (albeit after Governor Danny Chung of Minnesota declined, former Defense Secretary George Maddox proved himself to be a poor choice, and Meyer refused to nominate a female running mate), who on occasion eclipsed Meyer due to his folksy personality.\n* Meyer ties with Bill O'Brien when they both receive 269 electoral college votes in the 2016 residential election. A recount in Nevada not only maintained the Electoral College tie but lost Meyer her lead in the popular vote following the discovery of uncounted military absentee ballots in Washoe County stolen by a disgruntled postal worker over Meyer's closure of several post offices.\n* While lobbying House Representatives for their support in the upcoming vote, it is revealed that Tom James was lobbying several to abstain in order to allow him to become president via the Senate vote. When privately questioned by Meyer, James said that he was motivated by Meyer's recent acts of incompetence; after a brief shouting match, Meyer and James have sex.\n* After Meyer unwittingly posts a tweet insulting O'Brien, she blames this faux pas on Chinese hackers, and subsequently imposes punitive sanctions. At a secret meeting at Camp David, President Lu Chi-Jung of China proposes to liberalise the governance of Tibet, establishing a system similar to that in Hong Kong, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.\n* Meyer experiences another tie when the United States House of Representatives fails to reach a majority verdict on selecting who should become president. With the delegations for Missouri, Pennsylvania and Vermont abstaining, Meyer loses to O'Brien 22–25, but with O'Brien being one state's vote shy of winning. Meyer decided to let O'Brien win the House vote, preferring to run against him in four years rather than allow James to serve as president for upwards of twelve years, although by this point Congressman Ryan had already cast New Hampshire's vote for Meyer.\n* After the tie in the House, the Senate votes to appoint a vice president from the two presidential nominees' running mates (James and Montez) as per the 20th Amendment, prior to which Meyer privately agreed to serve as James's vice president. The vote also results in a tie, which is broken by incumbent Vice President Andrew Doyle in his capacity as President of the Senate. Doyle selects Laura Montez, O'Brien's running mate and a member of the opposing party, as revenge against Meyer for backtracking on her offer to make him Secretary of State if she won the election.\n* As the office of president is vacant due to the tied House vote, and House Speaker Jim Marwood announces that a second vote to determine the president will not be cast, Montez immediately ascends to the presidency and replaces Meyer.\n* Post presidency, Meyer sets up the Meyer Fund, takes part in election monitoring on behalf of the United Nations in the Republic of Georgia (during which both candidates attempt to bribe her), and enters into a relationship with Qatari ambassador Mohammed Al Jaffar. However, shortly after the publication of Meyer's biography First Woman: A Woman First, Leon West publishes Mike McLintock's diary after he accidentally left it at the offices of The Washington Post. Despite numerous damning revelations, when the public is informed of Meyer's actions during her presidency that helped free Tibet from China, her popularity soars and gives her the confidence to run again in the 2020 presidential election. Initially running on the slogan \"New Selina Now\", she abandoned it in favour of \"Man Up\" after berating popular progressive US Senator from New York Kemi Talbot during a primary debate.\n* Meyer is presented with a lower ranking award from the Nobel Foundation for her actions in freeing Tibet, but during her time in Oslo a warrant for her arrest is issued by the International Criminal Court due to accusations of her administration committing war crimes by violating Pakistan airspace and using a drone to kill innocent civilians at a terrorist's wedding. She is able to escape back to the United States with help from the Finnish embassy and the President of Georgia, using Catherine and Marjorie's wedding as a distraction. Whilst Meyer's popularity rose after news of the drone strike became public, it dipped again when it was revealed that one of its casualties was an elephant.\n* She is able to narrowly secure her party's nomination for president during the 2020 National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, but she is forced to alienate and dismiss her entire former team, ruin the lives of her former friends and competitors and accept Jonah Ryan (who ran for the nomination on a populist, nativist platform) as her running mate. This was so that Meyer would avoid either nominating Talbot as her running mate or serving as Talbot's running mate herself.\n* Meyer defeats Montez and serves a single four-year term as president, which is achieved through election interference in collusion with China in exchange for the unchallenged re-annexation of Tibet; Montez, running against Meyer, would otherwise have been guaranteed re-election despite her own poor approval ratings, according to Chinese polling data. Meyer is the second president since Grover Cleveland to serve two non-consecutive terms.\n* Meyer's only full term was notable for the successful permanent overturning of same-sex marriage, resulting in a permanent rift with Catherine and her wife Marjorie (formerly part of Meyer's Secret Service detail), and the impeachment of Jonah Ryan (which Meyer may have encouraged behind the scenes).\n* Dies in 2045 of natural causes, reported as having died somewhere between the ages of 75 and 77 due to her constantly lying about her age. After resting in state at the United States Capitol, she is interred at her presidential library at Smith College, Massachusetts. Upon being interred in the crypt, coverage of her funeral is immediately pushed out of the news cycle by the death of Tom Hanks at the age of 88.\n* Played by: Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nPresident Jeffrey Michener\n* President in: The Last Ship\n* Native of Evanston, Illinois.\n* The former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Barack Obama, he is in charge of establishing a safe zone in Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Florida during the initial outbreak of the Red Flu. However, he organizes for his son to be transported to the stadium from an infected location in Ann Arbor, Michigan, causing a mass outbreak of the virus in the southern United States. His son and wife later die, and he is forced to kill his daughters to spare their suffering after they become infected with the Red Flu.\n* Naturally immune to the Red Flu, he is taken in and brainwashed into becoming a puppet of Sean Ramsay, leader of the quasi-fascist Immunes, who plan to murder all survivors who are not naturally immune. He was later rescued from the Immunes by United States Navy sailors from the USS Nathan James, and as the only surviving member of the presidential line of succession assumes the role of president after his rescue.\n* Attempts to commit suicide due to the guilt of mercy killing his family, but later recovers and supports the USS Nathan James in their mission to spread the cure and defeat the Immunes.\n* Declares St. Louis the new capital of the United States after he is officially sworn in as president in the season 2 finale and establishes the Old St. Louis Courthouse as the new White House.\n* His policies during the post-plague reconstruction of the United States, which include the rationing of food, the restriction on cash withdrawals from banks, and restriction of land ownership rights, are criticized by regional leaders across the country.\n* Apparently commits suicide after AMT reporter Jacob Barnes reveals his complicity in the Doak Campbell Stadium outbreak and is succeeded by Vice President Howard Oliver.\n* His \"suicide\" is later revealed to be an assassination, carried out by Secret Service agents loyal to Chief of Staff Allison Shaw and the regional leaders, who seek to disband the United States federal government. Their aim is to bring Oliver to power; as he still had surviving family and friends, he could be easier blackmailed into becoming a puppet for their cause.\n* Played by: Mark Moses\nPresident Wyatt Midkiff\n*President in: ''Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Into the Fire by Dick Couch and George Galdorisi\nPresident Hunnis Millbank\n* President in: Virtual Light\n* African-American female president, elected for two terms.

He apparently chooses Caroline Reynolds as his vice president because she was a woman. However, he later tells her he will not support her in her own bid to seek nomination because he feels her ambition outweighs her integrity. She arranges his assassination soon after by having him poisoned, and is immediately sworn in as president.\n* Played by: Daniel J. Travanti\nPresident William Milton\n* Former president in: The Walking Dead''\n* A native of Ohio, he was the patriarch of the Milton family, a political dynasty similar to that of the Bush family and Kennedy family.\n* Served sometime in the 1980's, prior to the events of the series. He was the first president since Benjamin Harrison to sport a full beard during his time in office.\n* After the Wildfire virus outbreak in 2010 and resulting zombie apocalypse, Milton used his power and influence as a former President to create a safe zone that would later be known as the Commonwealth.\n* Due to the collapse of government and society, the Commonwealth would become one of the few functioning civilisations in the former United States of America, alongside the Civic Republic of Philadelphia.\n* After serving as Governor of the Commonwealth and Commander-in-Chief of its military for many years, Milton died and was succeeded by his daughter, Pamela Milton.\n* Played by: Tom Luse\nPresident Mimeo\n* President in: Putney Swope\n* Played by: Pepi Hermine\nPresident Evelyn Mitchell\n* President in Zero Day\n* Is in office when a massive cyberattack wreaks havoc across the United States and causes 3402 deaths.\n* Appoints popular former President George Mullen as head of the Zero Day Commission, authorised by the United States Congress and granted special powers to investigate the incident.\n* Portrayed by: Angela Bassett\nPresident William Harrison \"Bill\" Mitchell/Dave Kovic\n* President and presidential decoy in: Dave\n* Suffers a massive stroke during a sexual liaison with his secretary. His Chief of Staff Bob Alexander engineers a plot to seize power, using Kovic to masquerade as Mitchell, discrediting Vice President Gary Nance (whom Kovic was convinced to be mentally unstable) and succeeding as vice president, whereupon Kovic would fake another stroke and allow him to succeed to the presidency.\n* Kovic's charm and enthusiasm repairs Mitchell's public image, with pundits attributing Mitchell's change in personality to surviving his stroke. Only Oliver Stone (played by himself) suspects a conspiracy.\n* After Alexander forges Mitchell's signature to veto a bill that would guarantee funding for homeless shelters (including a juvenile home visited by Kovic and endorsed by First Lady Ellen Mitchell), Kovic (with the aid of his accountant friend Murray Blum) reviews the federal budget and proposes several cuts and investments that would raise the $650 million dollars necessary to preserve the shelters.\n* Kovic (inspired by Ellen after she learns of the masquerade and the two spend a night on the town together) proposes a job guarantee bill.\n* After Kovic fires Alexander, he accuses both Mitchell and Nance as the ringleaders of the First Liberty scandal which he masterminded, raising the prospect of impeachment. Kovic confesses Mitchell's involvement in the scandal to a joint session of Congress, then presents evidence that disgraces Alexander and proves Nance's innocence, then feigns a second stroke to escape the public eye.\n* Mitchell dies five months after 'his second stroke', is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, and is succeeded by Nance, while Kovic returns to his normal life and runs for office as a D.C. councilman. Kovic's job guarantee bill is passed into law under Nance to honor Mitchell's legacy while Alexander and several other members of the Mitchell administration for their roles in the First Liberty scandal.\n* Both played by: Kevin Kline\nPresident Horace C. Mitchell\n* President in: ''Saturday's Heroes\n* Played by: Charles Trowbridge\nPresidents Harris Moffatt I, II and III\n* Presidents in: Vilcabamba''\n* Harris Moffatt I tries to oppose the invasion of Earth by the alien Krolp, as part of which he merges the U.S. with Canada and becomes its prime minister. With the Krolp proving to be overwhelmingly strong, Moffatt I flees Washington, D.C., and remains president and prime minister of a rump U.S-Canada.\n* His son, Harris Moffatt II, negotiates a peace treaty with North American Krolp Governor Flargar that allows the rump U.S-Canada to exist for the next fifty years. He is killed by a drunken renegade Krolp.\n* The grandson, Harris Moffatt III, is faced with a demand from the Krolp to conduct strip mining for silver and a small amount of gold miles below the surface of northeastern Utah, which would most likely render the rump U.S. and Canada uninhabitable. He embarks on a failed rebellion that the Krolp crush in three days, dissolving the rump U.S. and embarking on their strip mining anyway. Moffatt III and his wife Jessica attempt to flee to rump Canada after the uprising is crushed. However, 20 minutes later, they are captured and forced into exile in the Krolp's North American capital of St. Louis.\nPresident Monahan\n* President in Superintelligence\n* First female US president\n* Played by: Jean Smart\nActing President Henry Moncas\n* Acting president in: Jem by Frederik Pohl (1979 film).\n* Speaker of the House when the president and vice president are killed in a 21st-century nuclear war.\nPresident Richard Monckton\n* President in: The Company\n*Monckton is a roman à clef representation of Richard M.

In reality, the House would be constitutionally required to hold continuous votes until a president is elected.\n* Members of her Cabinet included Meyer's Vice President Andrew Doyle as Secretary of State (who voted for Montez as a tiebreaker as revenge against Meyer for reneging on her promise to appoint him as Secretary of State) and former EM Wheelright CEO Charlie Baird Jr. as Treasury Secretary (O'Brien's initial choice, who had a short-lived relationship with Meyer which ended after she decided not to bail out EM Wheelright, forcing it to declare bankruptcy).\n* Is awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize after the freeing of Tibet earlier that year, though Meyer is the one who negotiated Tibet's independence.\n* During her presidency she presides over a damaging government shutdown instigated by Congressman for New Hampshire Jonah Ryan and his caucus, the Jeffersons, after they vote against a bill to raise the debt ceiling due to Ryan not being invited to the unveiling of Meyer's presidential portrait; after Ryan attempts to hold out for the abolition of daylight saving time, he loses the leadership of the Jeffersons, who reform as the Libertonians and agree to a deal with Montez to end the shutdown.\n*Following the death of Supreme Court Justice Tenny, Montez appoints former President Stuart Hughes to fill the vacancy, following avid press speculation that Meyer would be appointed.\n*After Mike McLintock's lost diary is leaked, it is revealed that Montez falsely took credit for freeing Tibet from the People's Republic of China from Meyer. This gives Meyer the confidence to run for president in 2020, despite the leak also revealing some damning revelations from her first tenure as president.\n* She loses to Meyer in the 2020 presidential election as a result of Chinese election interference in collusion with the Meyer campaign in exchange for the unchallenged re-annexation of Tibet, as secret Chinese polling data revealed that Meyer's nomination would have effectively guaranteed Montez's re-election otherwise, despite Montez's poor approval ratings.\n* She is later seen attending Meyers's funeral in 2045 at her presidential library in Smith College, Massachusetts. It is implied that she had undergone extensive cosmetic plastic surgery.\n* Claimed to be the first elected female president of the United States, as Meyer became president following the resignation of her predecessor, Stuart Hughes.
