In the , Pullenvale had a population of 3,276 people.\nGeography\nMount Elphinstone is in the north of the locality () and rises to   above sea level.\nPullenvale is  by road south-west of the Brisbane CBD. Located in the southern foothills of Mount Elphinstone, Pullenvale features rolling hills and areas of bush land, and is spread over an area of approximately .\nApart from a small area of undeveloped land in the north-west of the locality, the land usage is predominantly rural residential housing.\nHistory\nIn 1827, Mount Elphinstone was named by botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham as Mount Halsey, which also appears on some maps as Mount Helsey and Mount Kelsey.\nThere are a number of theories about the original of the name Pullenvale. One theory from a 1920s newspaper is that it is named after early timbergetter, George Pullen; however, no land records have been found to confirm this. Given that the local creek is known as Pullen Pullen Creek, some people believe the repetition suggests a word from one of the Australian Aboriginal languages possibly meaning \"to die\" (or \"not to die\") or \"fighting\" (or \"fighting ground\"). Another theory is that the Pullen Pullen name was originally Bullen Bullen, an Aboriginal word meaning \"lonely place\". In support of the \"fighting\" theory, there is an 1850 newspaper account:\nThe name Glen Pullen predated the name Pullenvale, which is described as a \"new name\" in 1873. There is an 1873 reference to Glenpullen Farm at Pullenvale.\nPioneer Pullenvale residents developed a logging industry. The construction of Moggill Road, linking Brisbane with Ipswich via Moggill, made the area more accessible. Eventually the logging industry give way to small crop and dairy farming.\nOn 6 September 1873,  were reserved for a cemetery and four trustees appointed. There were eight burials in the cemetery between 1876 and 1888, which were clustered at the top of a steep hill. There is only one surviving headstone for Adam James Furley Walker. When Greater Brisbane was established in 1925, the Brisbane City Council was made the trustee for the cemetery and closed the cemetery in 1930. Most of the land was sold off apart from the small area with the graves and an access path from Haven Road.\nThe resulting tiny population of farming families led to the establishment of the Pullenvale State School which opened on 16 March 1874 with an initial enrolment of 32 students. It was noted in the Brisbane Courier of 28 June 1873 that the residents of Pullenvale had, \"fairly earned the reputation of being possessed of considerable pluck, having lately accomplished a task of which many older settlements might well be proud that of placing in the Savings Bank the sum of £60 to the oredit of the Board of Education for the purpose of erecting a National School for the benefit of the young Pullenites.\" A year later it was reported in The Queenslander that there was now, \"a fine school and teacher's residence, and an average daily attendance of thirty children (which by the way might be increased by a little salutary compulsion).\" It was not until 1981 that the State School was rebuilt in Grandview Road to cater for a great increase in population that stemmed from the encroaching Brisbane metropolis.  In 2015 the school was granted Independent Public School status.\nPullenvale Hall is a former pineapple packing shed. The building was purchased from resident Jack Woodward in about 1943.\nMoggill Pony Club was formed in April 1961. It is one of the oldest pony clubs in Queensland.\nBrisbane Independent School opened in a church hall in St Lucia on 19 August 1968. It was established by parents who were looking for a different style of education for their children where they could pursue their own creativity and ideas. The school relocated to Pullenvale in 1972 on land donated by the Job family.\nDemographics\nIn the , Pullenvale had a population of 3,174 people, 49.8% female and 50.2% male.
