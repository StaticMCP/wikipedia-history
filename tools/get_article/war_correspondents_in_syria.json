The Committee to Protect Journalists in 2012 provided statistics stating that the Syrian Civil War has one of the largest recorded numbers of deaths when it comes to the number of war journalists who died abroad. Most of these deaths took place in Syria or adjacent borders and countries where the correspondents did not have any direct protection or were in travel.\nIn 2013, the number of war journalists kidnapped, killed and threatened reached its highest figure and since then the numbers have decreased. According to Jason Stern, from the Committee to Protect Journalists, this declining number of deaths is due to there are lees journalists in the country.\nOne of the most famous cases was the death of the New York Times´ correspondent, the American Anthony Shadid, who died in February 2012 in Damascus. Another significant death was the British Marie Colvin, correspondent for The Sunday Times, who died reporting the siege of Homs together with the French photographer Rémi Ochlik.\nValue of journalism in Syria\nFrancesca Borri has been reporting from Syria since 2012 and has published two books on the dynamics of the war within the country and within refugee communities as a result. Her opinions on the culture that is perceived by some as a cause of war in these times of turmoil further supports the importance of journalistic insight by these correspondents. According to her, the Arab culture is more \"advanced\" than Western culture in some aspects; for example, the community is more important than an individual and those involved have a relevance thanks to the influence of friends or family.\nSee also\n* List of journalists killed during the Syrian Civil War\nReferences"
