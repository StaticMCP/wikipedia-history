In this context, the Germiyanids and Menteshe principalities of Murad II. While not recognizing the sultanate of Murad, the principalities of Karamanids, Aydinids and Sarukhanids also recaptured some of their former lands from the Ottoman Empire.\nThe Bey of Candar dynasty, İsfendiyar Bey, also took advantage of this opportunity and took Tosya, Çankırı and Kalecik from the Ottomans, as well as besieging Safranbolu (Taraklı Borlu). Simultaneously, Eflak, an ally of Candar dynasty, was attacked by Silistra.\nBattle\nThe Mustafa Çelebi rebellion was suppressed (Mustafa Çelebi was executed on February 20, 1423.) Mustafa II, setting out from İznik, taking Kasım Bey, who had taken refuge with him when the Ottoman army reached Yenişehir, He marched against the Candar dynasty army that was besieging Taraklı Borlu. Murad II, gave soldiers to Kasım Bey's command and sent them to the battlefield. Seeing Kasım Bey on the opposing side, a part of the Candar army separated from the army and crossed to the opposite side. Between Bolu and Gered or near Safranbolu as a result of the battle between the two armies, the Ottoman army inflicted a decisive defeat on the Candar army Mubariz al-Din Isfendiyar, who was wounded in the head, also took refuge in the Sinop castle.\nAftermath\nMurad II, while returning to his capital after the victory, gave some Ottoman troops the task of following the retreating Candar troops. The Ottoman troops, who continued their forward operation, occupied Küre. Thereupon, Mubariz al-Din Isfendiyar sent his son Murad and wanted to make peace.\nReferences"
