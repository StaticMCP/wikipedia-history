It is the second and last game in Tecmo's Monster Rancher Battle Card series, featuring a card game incorporating the popular characters from the Monster Rancher series.\nReception\n| Allgame =\n| EGM = 6.5/10\n| EPD = 5/10\n| Fam = 27/40\n| GameFan = (JP) 87%(US) 80%\n| GameRev = B−\n| GSpot = 5.9/10\n| IGN = 5.5/10\n| NGen =\n}}\nThe game received average reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Greg Orlando of NextGen said, \"Although a variant on [Monster Rancher and Monster Rancher 2], Monster Rancher Battle Card [Episode II] holds none of their whimsical fun.\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 27 out of 40.\nThe D-Pad Destroyer of GamePro said of the game, \"Fans of the Monster Rancher cartoon series and PlayStation owners dying for a video card game would do well to pick up Battle Card. It's a harmless, fun card battle that requires strategy, quick thinking, and an inexhaustible appetite for cute gladiators doing what they do best - kicking ass.\" Bro Buzz said that the game \"gets some juice from the cool, if bizarre-looking, combatants and some basic-but-action-packed animation that illustrates the various cards. The lively music makes for a credible effort to party, too, although there's just too much boring dialogue in between cards. If you're game for a change o' pace or a strategy challenge, you might just find them in these cards.\"\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190112092044/http://monsterrancher.com/ Monster Rancher Metropolis]\n*"
