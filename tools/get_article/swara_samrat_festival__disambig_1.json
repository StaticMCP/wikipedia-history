The festival was initially planned to celebrate the 90th Birth Year of Swara Samrat Ustad Ali Akbar Khan (1922-2009). Bharat Ratna Pandit Ravi Shankar supported the event, but died 11 December 2012, just a month before the festival. After Ratna's death, Shree Ranjani Foundation Trust decided to dedicate this festival to the Sitar legend too. The Majumdars called this festival a dedication to \"The Immortal Duo – Swara Samrat Ali Akbar Khan and Bharat Ratna Ravi Shankar\". Both of them had learnt from the same guru and had performed duet concerts across the globe. The full house, performers and sponsors were overwhelmed by this grand gesture. Shree Ranjani Foundation Trust decided to continue the festival, which is now held every winter.\n|align = right\n|width = 35%\n|fontsize =\n|border = 1px\n|quoted = 1\n|salign = right\n|sstyle =\n}}\nSwara Samrat - The Title\nAcharya Baba Ustad Allauddin Khan, who is regarded as one of the greatest saints of Indian classical music the 19th and 20th centuries and founded the Maihar Senia Gharana, had gifted his son Ali Akbar Khan, the title Swara Samrat (meaning Emperor of Melody).\nSwara Samrat Festival - Time Period\nInitially Swara Samrat Festival was a two-day festival held in January/February of every year. But after the fourth season, which was held on 10 & 12 January 2016, SSF wanted to move the festival to December. The 2016 season was thus held in January, and the fifth season was in December. The festival currently is a four-day December event.\nSSF Lifetime Achievement Award\nIn 2018, SSF honored Janaab Abul Khair Litu  (Chairman, Bengal Foundation, Bangladesh) with the SSF Lifetime Achievement Award for his enormous contribution to the propagation, promotion and facilitation of proper training of Indian Classical Music & Dance as well as other forms of Arts across Bangladesh.\nIn 2019–20, Pandit Vijay Kichlu, an eminent musician, musicologist, music producer and founder of ITC Sangeet Research Academy was honored with the SSF Lifetime Achievement Award for his lifelong contribution to the entire fraternity of Indian classical music and dance across India and abroad.\n| align = right\n| width = 35%\n| fontsize =\n| border = 1px\n| quoted = 1\n| salign = right\n| sstyle =\n}}\nSeason 8 (1, 7 & 8 December 2019, and 13 February 2020)\n*Pt.
