Works are included here if they have been described by scholars as relating substantially in their structure or content to the Divine Comedy.\nThe Divine Comedy () is an Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun  1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. Divided into three parts: Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Heaven), it is widely considered the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as it had developed in the Catholic Church by the 14th century. It helped to establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language.\nLiterature\nMedieval\n's 1365 fresco Church Militant and Triumphant in the Santa Maria Novella church, Florence]]\n* In 1373, a little more than half a century after Dante's death, the Florentine authorities softened their attitude to him and decided to establish a department for the study of the Divine Comedy. Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375) was appointed to head the department in October 1373, and he sponsored its organization. In January 1374, Boccaccio wrote and delivered a series of lectures on the Comedy. In addition, Boccaccio is included in the work Origine, vita e costumi di Dante Alighieri, where his treatise Trattatello in laude di Dante provides a biography of Dante.\n* Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343–1400) translated, adapted, and explicitly referred to Dante's work.\n** \"A Complaynt to His Lady,\" an early short poem, is written in terza rima, the rhyme scheme Dante invented for the Comedy.\n** Anelida and Arcite ends with a \"\" by Anelida, the lover jilted by Arcite; the  begins with the phrase \"So thirleth with the poynt of remembraunce\" and ends with \"Hath thirled with the poynt of remembraunce,\" copied from Purgatory 12.32, \"la punctura di la rimembranza.\"\n** The House of Fame, a dream vision in three books in which the narrator is guided through the heavens by an otherworldly guide, has been described as a parody of the Comedy. The narrator echoes Inferno 2.32 in the poem (2.588–592).\n** ''The Monk's Tale from The Canterbury Tales describes (in greater and more emphatic detail) the plight of Count Ugolino (Inferno'', cantos 32 and 33), referring explicitly to Dante's original text in 7.2459–2462.\n** The beginning of the last stanza of Troilus and Criseyde (5.1863-65) is modelled on Paradiso 12.28–30.\nEarly Modern\n* John Milton finds various uses for Dante, whose work he knew well:\n** Milton refers to Dante's insistence on the separation of worldly and religious power in Of Reformation, where he cites Inferno 19.115–117.\n** Beatrice's condemnation of corrupt and neglectful preachers, Paradiso 29.107–109 (\"so that the wretched sheep, in ignorance, / return from pasture, having fed on wind\") is translated and adapted in Lycidas 125–126, \"The hungry Sheep look up, and are not fed, / But swoln with wind, and the rank mist they draw,\" when Milton condemns corrupt clergy.\nNineteenth century\n's 1831 novel Les Proscrits]]\n* The title of Honoré de Balzac's work La Comédie humaine (the \"Human Comedy,\" 1815–1848) is usually considered a conscious adaptation of Dante's.\n* Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who translated the Divine Comedy into English, wrote a poem titled \"Mezzo Cammin\" (\"Halfway,\" 1845), alluding to the first line of the Comedy, and a sonnet sequence (of six sonnets) under the title \"Divina Commedia\" (1867); these were published as flyleaves to his translation.\n* Karl Marx uses a paraphrase of Purgatory (V, 13) to conclude the preface to the first edition of Das Kapital (1867), as a kind of motto: \"Segui il tuo corso, e lascia dir le genti\" (\"follow your own road, and let the people talk\").\n* Lesya Ukrainka's poem \"The Forgotten Shadow\" (1898) is a feminist reinterpretation of Dante and Beatrice. The forgotten shadow in the poem is Gemma Donati, Alighieri's wife.\nTwentieth century\n* In E. M. Forster's novel Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905), the character of Gino Carella, upon first introducing himself, quotes the first lines of Inferno (the novel includes several references to Dante's La Vita Nuova as well).\n* T. S. Eliot cites Inferno, XXVII, 61–66, as an epigraph to \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" (1915). Eliot cites heavily from and alludes to Dante in Prufrock and Other Observations (1917), Ara vus prec (1920), and The Waste Land (1922).\n* Begun in 1916, Ezra Pound's Cantos take the Comedy as a model.\n* Samuel Beckett in his non-fiction essay \"Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce\", published in Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress (1929), compares Joyce's reassessments of the conventions of the English language to Dante's departure from Latin and synthesis of Italian dialects in the Divine Comedy.\n* In Jorge Luis Borges's 1945 short story The Aleph, the protagonist mourns the recent death of Beatriz Viterbo, whom he loved, at the beginning and meets his cousin Carlos Argentino Daneri, whose name originated from combining Dante Alighieri's name and last name. Also, the Aleph is found in the nineteenth step in the basement, which matches the XIX canto of Paradise, which contains a description similar to that of the Aleph.\n* Turkish poet Cahit Sıtkı Tarancı's famous poem \"Otuz Beş Yaş\" (lit. \"Thirty Five Years\") is beginning with the verses which contains a citation of Inferno: \"Yaş otuz beş! Yolun yarısı eder / Dante gibi ortasındayız ömrün\" (\"Age thirty five! It is half of way / We are in the middle of life like Dante\") won the Best Turkish Poem Prize in 1946.\n* Primo Levi cites Dante's Divine Comedy in the chapter called \"Canto of Ulysses\" in his novel Se questo è un uomo (If This Is a Man) (1947), published in the United States as Survival in Auschwitz, and in other parts of this book; the fires of Hell are compared to the \"real threat of the fires of the crematorium.\"\n* Malcolm Lowry paralleled Dante's descent into hell with Geoffrey Firmin's descent into alcoholism in his epic novel Under the Volcano (1947). In contrast to the original, Lowry's character explicitly refuses grace and \"chooses hell,\" though Firmin does have a Dr. Vigil as a guide (and his brother, Hugh Firmin, quotes the Comedy from memory in ch. 6).\n* The seventh and last chapter from Leopoldo Marechal's first novel, Adam Buenosayres (1948), is a parody of the Inferno, entitled \"Journey To The Dark City Of Cacodelphia\", wherein the titular character meets several of his literary contemporaries (including his guide).\n* Poet Derek Walcott, in 1949, published Epitaph for the Young: XII Cantos, which he later acknowledged as influenced by Dante.\n* Jorge Luis Borges, who wrote extensively about Dante, included two short texts in his Dreamtigers (El Hacedor, 1960): \"Paradiso, XXXI, 108\" and \"Inferno, I, 32,\" which paraphrase and comment on Dante's lines.\n* African-American author LeRoi Jones, in 1965, published the novel ''The System of Dante's Hell'', in which a young African-American man lives nomadically in the Southern United States, struggling with segregation and racism. The book correlates the man's experience with Dante's Inferno, and includes a diagram of the fictional hell described by Dante.\n* Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's novel The First Circle (1968) takes its title from the Inferno. Set in a special Gulag for scientists, it parallels Dante's First Circle (Limbo) where virtuous philosophers of antiquity are separated from God and humanity but not punished in any other way.\n* James Merrill published his Divine Comedies, a collection of poetry, in 1976; a selection in that volume, \"The Book of Ephraim\", consists \"of conversations held, via the Ouija board, with dead friends and spirits in 'another world.'\"\n* Authors Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle wrote a modern sequel to the Inferno, Inferno (1976), in which a science fiction author dies during a fan convention and finds himself in Hell, where Benito Mussolini functions as his guide. They wrote a subsequent sequel to their own work, Escape from Hell (2009).\n* Gloria Naylor's Linden Hills (1985) uses Dante's Inferno as a model for the trek made by two young black poets who spend the days before Christmas doing odd jobs in an affluent African American community. The young men soon discover the price paid by the inhabitants of Linden Hills for pursuing the American dream.\n* Author Monique Wittig's Virgile, Non (published in English as Across the Acheron, 1985) is a lesbian–feminist parody of the Divine Comedy set in the utopia/dystopia of second-wave feminism.\n* Steve Tidrick used the nine circles of Dante's hell as an analogy to explain the United States federal budget in his cover story in The New Republic entitled \"The Budget Inferno\" (May 29, 1995), which was republished in The New Republic Guide to the Issues: the ‘96 Campaign (Basic Books, 1996).\n* Mark E. Rogers used the structure of Dante's hell in his 1998 comedic novel Samurai Cat Goes to Hell (the last in the Samurai Cat series), and includes the trope of a gate to hell with an \"abandon hope\" inscription.\nTwenty-first century\n* Irish poet Seamus Heaney published a poem, \"A Dream of Solstice\", on the front page of the Irish Times (18 January 2000) that begins with a translation of [http://dantelab.dartmouth.edu/reader?reader%5Bcantica%5D=3&reader%5Bcanto%5D=33 Paradiso 33.58–61] as \"Like somebody who sees things when he's dreaming / And after the dream lives with the aftermath / Of what he felt, no other trace remaining, / So I live now\".\n* Nick Tosches's In The Hand of Dante (2002) weaves a contemporary tale about the finding of an original manuscript of the Divine Comedy with an imagined account of Dante's years composing the work.\n* Inferno by Peter Weiss (written in 1964, published in 2003) is a play inspired by the Comedy, the first part of a planned trilogy.\n* The Dante Club is a 2003 novel by Matthew Pearl that tells the story of various American poets translating The Divine Comedy in post-civil war Boston, who must also investigate murders being committed based on the punishments in the text, due to their desire to protect Dante's reputation and the fact that only they have the necessary expertise to understand the murderer's motivations.\n* Óscar Esquivias in his trilogy of novels Inquietud en el Paraíso (2005), La ciudad del Gran Rey (2006) and Viene la noche (2007) shows his personal vision of Dante's Divine Comedy.\n* In the novel The Tenth Circle (2006) by Jodi Picoult, the main character's comic strip, The Tenth Circle, is based on the Inferno.\n* Dante himself is a character in The Master of Verona (2007), a novel by David Blixt that combines the people of Dante's time with the characters of Shakespeare's Italian plays.\n* Dale E. Basye's book series Heck: Where the Bad Kids Go (began in 2008) features a modified version of the nine circles of hell.\n* S.A. Alenthony's novel The Infernova (2009) is a parody of the Inferno as seen from an atheist's perspective, with Mark Twain acting as the guide.\n* The title of Yann Martel's 2010 novel Beatrice and Virgil is an allusion to two of the main characters in The Divine Comedy.\n* Sylvain Reynards' 2011 novel ''Gabriel's Inferno'' was inspired by the relationship between Dante and Beatrice.\n* Dante Quintana from Benjamin Alire Sáenz's 2012 novel Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe is named after Dante.\n* Laura Elizabeth Woollett's 2014 novel The Wood of Suicides is named after the second ring of the seventh circle of hell.\n* Adam Roberts' Purgatory Mount is a 2021 science fiction novel that features a huge mountain on a distant planet resembling Dante's Mount Purgatory.\nVisual arts\nSculpture\n's sculpture The Gates of Hell, Musée Rodin]]\n* Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux's sculpture Ugolino and His Sons is based on the account of Count Ugolino in Inferno Canto XXXIII.\n* Auguste Rodin's sculptural group The Gates of Hell draws heavily on the Inferno. The component sculpture, Paolo and Francesca, represents Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta, whom Dante meets in Canto 5. The version of this sculpture known as The Kiss shows the book that Paolo and Francesca were reading. Other component sculptures include Ugolino and his children (Canto 33) and The Shades, who originally pointed to the phrase \"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'entrate\" (\"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here\") from Canto 3. Sculptures of Grief and Despair cannot be assigned to particular sections of the Inferno, but are in keeping with the overall theme. The famous component sculpture The Thinker, near the top of the gate, and also produced as an independent work, may represent Dante himself.\n*Timothy Schmalz created a series of 100 sculptures, one for each canto, on the 700th anniversary of the date of Dante’s death.\nIllustrations\n* Giovanni di Paolo illuminated Dante's Paradiso with 61 miniature tempera paintings in the 1440s.\n* Sandro Botticelli made the most famous set of illustrations during the Renaissance for a manuscript of the Divine Comedy commissioned by Lorenzo Pierfrancesco de' Medici; Botticelli also designed a series of illustrations for the 1481 edition of the poem.\n* Stradanus prepared a series of illustrations of Inferno.\n* A commentary by La Comedia di Dante Alighieri con la nova esposizione written by Alessandro Vellutello and printed in 1544 by Francesco Marcolini, was illustrated with 87 engravings, possibly by Giovanni Britto.\n* John Flaxman's set of one hundred and eleven illustrations were influential across Europe on artists such as Goya and Ingres, because of their radically minimalist style.\n* William Blake planned and executed several watercolour illustrations to the Divine Comedy, including The Wood of the Self-Murderers: The Harpies and the Suicides. Though he did not finish the series before his death in 1827, they offer a powerful visual interpretation of the poem.\n* Gustave Doré made the most famous illustrations in the 19th century; the plates were drawn in 1857, and published in 1860 with Henry Francis Cary's translation.\n* Franz von Bayros illustrated a 1921 edition in colour.\n* Salvador Dalí made a series of prints for the Comedy in 1950–51.\n* British artist Tom Phillips illustrated his own translation of the Inferno, published in 1985, with four illustrations per canto.\nFile:1K002578 Divine Comedy Giovanni di paolo.jpg|Paradiso: Dante and Beatrice meet Folco of Marseille, who denounces corrupt churchmen.

It was danced by The Royal Ballet, led by its principal dancer Edward Watson as Dante, in his final appearance after 20 years working with and interpreting McGregor. The music was performed live by an orchestra of 75 musicians. Sarah Crompton called the work \"bold, beautiful, emotional and utterly engaging\". The dance is in three sections. \"Inferno\" shows Dante's journey to hell, guided by Virgil, in \"remarkably free and inventive\" choreography, \"rich in feeling\". \"Purgatorio\" shows Dante meeting two incarnations of his young self, and three of the woman he loves, Beatrice. Watson dances with the living Beatrice (Francesca Hayward) \"in lovely, poetic flow\", and then with the heavenly Beatrice (Sarah Lamb) \"all unfolding limbs and ethereal gestures\". \"Paradiso\" has Dante in heaven with the dancers skittering about the stage all in white, in what Crompton calls a mood \"of abstracted joy, deep but dazzling\".\nOpera\nwith members of the premiere cast of his opera Francesca da Rimini in 1906]]\n* In Claudio Monteverdi's 1607 opera ''L'Orfeo'', the title character is bombarded with the famous line  as he attempts to enter the underworld.\n* Gaetano Donizetti's 1837 opera ''Pia de' Tolomei'' centers around the life of the titular Pia de' Tolomei as mentioned in Purgatorio Canto XIII.\n* Numerous mainly 19th century operas treat the story of Francesca da Rimini, many of them including those by Pellico (1818), Strepponi (1823), Carlini, Mercadante, Quilici, Generali, Staffa, Manna, Fournier, Tamburini, Borgatta, Morlacchi, Papparlardo, Nordal, Maglioni, Bellini, DeVasinis, Meiners (1841), Cannetti, Brancaccio, Rolland, Ruggieri, Pinelli, Franchini, Meiners (again, this time in 1860), Gilson, Sescewich, Boullard, Marcarini, Moscuzza, Goetz, Cagnoni, Thomas, Impallomeni, Gilson, Nápravník, Rachmaninov (in 1906), Leoni, Zandonai (1914, based on the 1901 play by Gabriele D'Annunzio), and Henried (in 1920) all having that same title.\n* Benjamin Godard's Dante et Béatrice from 1890 depicts Dante not as a famous poet, but as a young man implicated in political and love intrigues in his quest for Beatrice.\n* Gianni Schicchi, one of the operas making up Giacomo Puccini's Il Trittico alongside Il Tabarro and Suor Angelica, centers around an incident concerning the titular Gianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti mentioned in Inferno Canto XXX.\n* Louis Andriessen's 2008 opera La Commedia is a retelling of The Divine Comedy.\n* Lucia Ronchetti's 2021 opera Inferno is based on the Inferno section of The Divine Comedy.
