Although the majority of members worked in commercial warehouses, one of the founding unions included tobacco workers, who also transferred to the new union.  In 1913, the union renamed itself as the \"National Union of Warehouse and General Workers\".\nThe membership of the union varied considerably; it had 6,000 members on formation, but this fell to 4,000 the following year, before rising to 7,688 in 1915.  It recruited huge numbers of members during World War I, and by 1920 claimed a membership of 96,000.  It was particularly successful in recruiting toymakers, and by the end of the war, around 2,000 of its members worked in the sector.\nAt the start of 1921, the union merged with the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees, forming the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers.\nGeneral Secretaries\n:1911: Joseph Cleary\n:c.1920: William Albert Robinson\nReferences"
