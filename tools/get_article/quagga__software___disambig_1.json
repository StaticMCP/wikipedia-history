Quagga is a fork of the GNU Zebra project which was developed by Kunihiro Ishiguro and which was discontinued in 2005. The Quagga tree aims to build a more involved community for Quagga than the centralized development-model which GNU Zebra followed.\nComponents\nThe Quagga architecture consists of a core daemon (zebra) which is an abstraction layer to the underlying Unix kernel and presents the Zserv API over a Unix-domain socket or TCP socket to Quagga clients. The Zserv clients typically implement a routing protocol and communicate routing updates to the zebra daemon. Existing Zserv clients are:\n*ospfd, implementing Open Shortest Path First (OSPFv2)\n*isisd, implementing Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)\n*ripd, implementing Routing Information Protocol (RIP) version 1 and 2;\n*ospf6d, implementing Open Shortest Path First (OSPFv3) for IPv6\n*ripngd, implementing Routing Information Protocol (RIPng) for IPv6\n*bgpd, implementing Border Gateway Protocol (BGPv4+), including address family support for IP multicast and IPv6\n*pimd, implementing Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM-SSM) for Source-specific multicast\nAdditionally, the Quagga architecture has a rich development library to facilitate the implementation of protocol and client software with consistent configuration and administrative behavior.\nSee also\n* Bird Internet routing daemon\n* List of open source routing platforms\n* XORP\nReferences"
