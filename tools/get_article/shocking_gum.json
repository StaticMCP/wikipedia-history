The victim is offered what appears to be the last stick of chewing gum from a package; touching or pulling the stick of gum triggers the shock. A few novelty companies have produced \"shocking gum\" packages since the 1950s, depicting fictitious brands such as Fruit Juicy and JB.\nIn 2005, the U.S. Marine Corps reported that insurgents in Iraq were using shock chewing gum as a form of torture, forcing prisoners to bite down on the sticks.\nAnother closely related prank device is the chewing gum bug, in which a fake plastic bug attached to a metal spring instead \"snaps\" the hand of the person who attempts to take the piece of gum.\nSee also\n* List of practical joke topics\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Shocking Gum\n\n#REDIRECT Shocking gum"
