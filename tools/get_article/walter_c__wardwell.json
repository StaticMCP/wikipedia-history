Before becoming mayor, he was appointed as Deputy Sheriff of Cambridge in 1893.\nCareer\nAfter becoming mayor in January 1907, Wardwell advocated for at least 5 intermediate stations in Cambridge on the Cambridge subway, while suburbanites interested in faster through travel argued for only a single intermediate station at Central Square. The two groups finally compromised on two intermediate stations, at Central Square and Kendall Square, allowing construction to start in 1909.\nPersonal life\nWardwell was born on January 27, 1859, in Richmond, Virginia to Burnham Wardwell and Sarah J. Goodale. On January 12, 1888, Wardwell married Grace Gardner Jones in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He died on September 29, 1940, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nNotes"
