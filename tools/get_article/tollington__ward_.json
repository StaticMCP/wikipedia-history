The ward was first used in the 1978 elections. It returns three councillors to Islington London Borough Council.\nIt is part of the Islington North constituency. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 13,211. The ward is represented by three councillors, whose elections are held every four years. The ward is a very safe Labour seat, and stayed Labour even during the years when Islington Council was won by the Liberal Democrats. As of 2022, the councillors are Mick Gilgunn, Anjna Khurana and Flora Williamson.\nBackground\nThe ward is named after the only other place in the historic parish of Islington mentioned as a separate manor in the Domesday Book, in the old form Tolentone. The manor house was located beside present day Hornsey Road (known as Tollington Lane as late as 1740) and was purchased in 1271 by the priory of St John at Clerkenwell after which the manor's name fell into disuse.\nIslington council elections since 2022\nThere was a revision of ward boundaries in Islington in 2022.\n2022 election\nThe election took place on 5 May 2022.\n2002–2022 Islington council elections\n|frame=yes|text=Tollington ward boundaries from 2002 to 2022}}\nThere was a revision of ward boundaries in Islington in 2002.\n2021 by-election\n2018 election\nThe election took place on 3 May 2018.\n2014 election\nThe election took place on 22 May 2014.\n2010 election\nThe election on 6 May 2010 took place on the same day as the United Kingdom general election.\n2006 election\nThe election took place on 4 May 2006.\n2002 election\nThe election took place on 2 May 2002.\n1978–2002 Islington council elections\n|frame=yes|text=Tollington ward boundaries from 1978 to 1994}}\nThere was a revision of ward boundaries in Islington in 1978.
