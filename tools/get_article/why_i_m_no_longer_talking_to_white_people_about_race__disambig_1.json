Evaristo described the work as \"timely and accessible\", \"comprehensive and journalistic\" as well as \"resolutely unacademic\", comparing it to the work of African-American writer Roxane Gay, whose 2014 anthology Bad Feminist \"treads some of the same ground\". However, she critiques Eddo-Lodge for not engaging in enough \"rigorous research, particularly into the past\" and for the fact that she \"completely overlooks\" the work of Black British feminist writers like Beverley Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe. Evaristo also noted that the book leaves open further questions, such as \"What is the responsibility of black people in creating change for ourselves? Without also taking responsibility, we are dependent and powerless. What about the numerous positive developments since Windrush?\"\nArifa Akbar reviewed the work for the Financial Times, noting that Eddo-Lodge \"builds on a critical tradition drawn from black American writers\" like W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and bell hooks. Akbar notes that \"Not everyone will find the answer to racial inequality in Eddo-Lodge's reliance on White consciousness-raising, but it is an important shift that undermines the idea that racism is the BAME (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic) community's burden to carry. The liberation that this book offers is in the reversal of responsibilities.\"\nWriting for The Guardian, Colin Grant places the book within a wider tradition of \"angry warnings to an ignorant white readership\", the majority of which have been produced by African-American rather than Black British writers. Grant opined that \"Eddo-Lodge accurately takes the temperature of racial discussions in the UK\" but that several sections, such as its discussion of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, are too brief, stating that \"this kind of book is not designed to delve beyond the headlines in order to draw lessons from the past\".\nThe book was chosen as number one in a public poll of the \"Top Ten Books by Women that Changed the World\" in 2018, as part of the Bookseller's Association of the UK and Ireland's Academic Book Week.\nReviewing the work for NPR, the journalist Silvia Viñas stated that the work's \"boldness\" and \"straight talk\" is what makes it \"memorable\", also noting that while focusing \"on events in Britain, it's still accessible to readers of black American history.\"\nAwards and recognition\n* 2017: Longlisted – the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction for ''Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race\n* 2018: Longlisted – the Orwell Prize for Political Writing for Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race\n* 2018: Jhalak Prize for Book of the Year by a Writer of Colour.\n* 2018: British Book Award for narrative non-fiction\n* 2018: Winner of public poll of 20 books shortlisted by the UK Booksellers Association for the most influential book written by a woman.\n* 2018: Bread and Roses Award for Radical Publishing for ''Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race (joint winner)\nSales\nFollowing the 2020 murder of George Floyd, Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race'' became the first book by a Black British writer to reach No. 1 on the Nielsen BookScan's UK top 50 book sales chart.\nReferences"
