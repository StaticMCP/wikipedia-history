Although the book of ''Zakhirah-i Khvarazm'Shahi'' is written in Persian it contains a few Arabic words.\nThe book builds upon works by Avicenna, Akhaveiny, and other doctors of traditional medicine written in the fifth century or before.\nThis Iranian traditional medicinal book has been translated into other languages such as Turkish, Urdu, and Hebrew, and by the author himself into Arabic. After writing this encyclopedic book, Gorgani wrote Khafi Alayee as a contraction of it.\nProvenance\nAt five places in the volume (fols. 75a, 76a, 95a, 98b, and 162b), a later hand in a fine calligraphic script has repeated the following statement: \"The owner and possessor of this medical book called Jawahir al-maqal is Khamrah Aghā ibn Rustum ibn Muḥammad Aghā ibn Khiḍr Aghā ibn Mīr Khamrah ibn Mīr Mīzā ibn Aḥmad Beg, in the year 1211 [= 1796–7].\" An owner's stamp accompanies these inscriptions. Schullian/Sommer (Cat. of incun. & MSS., p. 338) initially interpreted this name as that of the compiler of the collection, however, the inscription clearly indicates that this is the name of a later owner.\nThe volume was acquired in 1941 by the Army Medical Library from A.S. Yahuda, who had obtained it in Ebril in northern Iraq (ELS 1685 med 45).\nContents\n''Zakhira-i Khvarazm'Shahi'' contains 10 chapters and a preface.
