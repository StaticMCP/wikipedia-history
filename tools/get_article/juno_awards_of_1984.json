The ceremonies were broadcast on CBC Television from 8pm Eastern Time.\n1984 was a pioneering year for music video in Canada as MuchMusic began broadcasting in September, and a new Juno award for \"Best Video\" was presented for the first time.\nAs it had been 20 months since the last Juno show, a number of new artist nominees debuted this year including Corey Hart, Honeymoon Suite, Platinum Blonde, The Parachute Club and Zappacosta.\nThe Juno Award itself was revised from 18-inches high to a 15-inch statuette, retaining the metronome shape.\nAwards ceremony\nIn October 1983, Juno organizers CARAS decided to move the awards date later in the year, tentatively to 3 December 1984 at Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto, Ontario. A stated reason for this move was to promote Canadian artists during the Christmas shopping season. CARAS also wanted to assume more control over the awards broadcast from the CBC. Eventually, it was determined that the CBC would continue to televise the Junos, but for 1984 would work with major music promoter Concert Productions International on the broadcast.\nIn August 1984, it was confirmed that the awards would take place at Exhibition Place two days later than planned. At the same time, a preliminary selection of \"semi-finalist\" artists and albums was also announced. The final set of nominations were determined in late October.\nBritish-Canadian musician Bryan Adams was the heavy favorite of the evening with nominations in five categories of which he would take home four awards including \"Male Vocalist of the Year\" and \"Album of the Year\" for the hit Cuts Like a Knife album which had sold more than 3 million copies in the U.S. and over 300,000 copies in Canada. When Adams and his co-writing partner Jim Vallance won the \"Composer of the Year\" award, Adams excitedly accepted it on behalf of the absent Vallance: \"This is the one I really wanted to win. Jim and I have been writing for six years together. Jimmy we did it! Right on!\"\nPerformances during the show included the three \"Canadian Music Hall of Fame\" inductees: The Crew-Cuts, The Four Lads and The Diamonds, and also Jane Siberry.\nThe ratings for the television broadcast were far down from the previous year with an estimated 1,443,000 viewers.\nNominees and winners\nThis was the last year that the \"Comedy Album of the Year\" was awarded.\nBryan Adams was nominated twice in the same category for \"Composer of the Year\" award for two different songs both from the Cuts Like a Knife album.\nThe Good Brothers were given their final \"Country Group of the Year\" award after a record eight years in a row, while Loverboy claimed the \"Group of the Year\" award for the third year in a row, as did Liona Boyd for the \"Instrumental Artist of the Year\" award.\nDirector Rob Quartly received four of the five nominations for the nascent \"Best Video\" award category, and also took the win for the \"Sunglasses at Night\" music video.\nFemale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Carole Pope\nOther nominees:\n* Dalbello\n* Anne Murray\n* Shari Ulrich\n* Holly Woods\nMale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Bryan Adams\nOther nominees:\n* Bruce Cockburn\n* Corey Hart\n* Gordon Lightfoot\n* Stan Rogers\nMost Promising Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Sherry Kean\nOther nominees:\n* Véronique Béliveau\n* Ann Mortifee\n* Jane Siberry\n* Diane Tell\nMost Promising Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Zappacosta\nOther nominees:\n* LaBarge\n* Johnnie Lovesin\n* Nash the Slash\n* Tim Ryan\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: Loverboy\nOther nominees:\n* Chilliwack\n* Payola$\n* Red Rider\n* Rush\nMost Promising Group of the Year\nWinner: The Parachute Club\nOther nominees:\n* Honeymoon Suite\n* Men Without Hats\n* The Nylons\n* Platinum Blonde\nComposer of the Year\nWinner: Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, \"Cuts Like a Knife\" by Bryan Adams\nOther nominees:\n* Bryan Adams and Eric Kagna, \"Straight from the Heart\"\n* Billy Bryans, Laurie Conger, Lynne Fernie, Lorraine Segato, \"Rise Up\"\n* Ivan Doroschuk, \"Safety Dance\"\n* Corey Hart, \"Sunglasses at Night\"\nCountry Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Anne Murray\nOther nominees:\n* Carroll Baker\n* Marie Bottrell\n* Kelita Haverland\n* Susan Jacks\nCountry Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Murray McLauchlan\nOther nominees:\n* Terry Carisse\n* Dick Damron\n* Ian Tyson\n* Diamond Joe White\nCountry Group or Duo of the Year\nWinner: The Good Brothers\nOther nominees:\n* Family Brown\n* The Mercey Brothers\n* Prairie Oyster\n* Chris Whiteley and Caitlin Hanford\nInstrumental Artist of the Year\nWinner: Liona Boyd\nOther nominees:\n* Canadian Brass\n* Hagood Hardy\n* Frank Mills\n* The Spitfire Band\nProducer of the Year\nWinner: Bryan Adams, Cuts Like a Knife by Bryan Adams\nOther nominees:\n* Kerry Crawford and Jon Goldsmith, Stealing Fire by Bruce Cockburn\n* Dalbello, whomanfoursays by Dalbello\n* Daniel Lanois, The Parachute Club by The Parachute Club\n* David Tyson, Stand Back by The Arrows\nRecording Engineer of the Year\nWinner: John Naslen, Stealing Fire by Bruce Cockburn\nOther nominees:\n* Gary Gray, Weapons by Rough Trade\n* John Naslen, No Borders Here by Jane Siberry\n* John Naslen, On Purpose by Tim Ryan\n* Lenny De Rose, whomanfoursays by Dalbello\nCanadian Music Hall of Fame\nWinner: The Crewcuts, The Diamonds, The Four Lads\nWalt Grealis Special Achievement Award\nWinner: J.
