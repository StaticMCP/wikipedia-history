She sets out to use her family to get revenge on Castle.\nReception\nThe series holds an average rating of 7.6 by 20 professional critics on the review aggregation website Comic Book Roundup.\nThe series marked a return to a humorous portrayal of the character of the Punisher, something which Ennis had not done for some time due to working under the Marvel Max line which focused more on serious stories.\nPrints\nIssues\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
