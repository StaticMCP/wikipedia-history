It is divided into two classes: the first class is awarded to commanders and partisan units of brigades, divisions, and higher military groups for bravery, courage, and auspicious command of military operations. The second class is awarded to the commanders of partisan regiments, battalions, companies, and detachments, as well as to civil professionals employed in the industry for the military. The order is awarded with the Order of the National Flag of the same rank.\nThe order was instituted on 7 July 1950, during the Korean War.\nTwo variants have been made: one Soviet-made with a twisting mechanism for attachment and a North Korean-made with a pin.\nRecipients\nDuring the Korean War, the order, first class, was received by 95 Koreans and 126 Chinese people and second class by 3,043 Koreans and 4,703 Chinese recipients.
