      "text": "# Lute Olson Award\n\n}}\nThe Lute Olson Award is an award given annually to the most outstanding men's college basketball player in NCAA Division I competition. The award was established in 2010 and is named for former Arizona Wildcats head coach Lute Olson.\nSelection\nFrom its inception through the 2020–21 season, only players who had completed at least two seasons at their current school were eligible for the award. As such, freshmen and first-year transfers were ineligible. Starting with the 2021–22 season, eligibility was extended to all Division&nbsp;I players regardless of their academic class or tenure at a school. The recipient is chosen by a panel of 30 people, including current and former coaches, administrators and media personnel. Lute Olson also served on the committee until his death in 2020.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Awarded a national player of the year award: Sporting News; Oscar Robertson Trophy; Associated Press; NABC; Naismith; Wooden\n|-\n| Player (X)\n| Denotes the number of times the player has been awarded the Lute Olson Award at that point\n|}\nWinners\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
