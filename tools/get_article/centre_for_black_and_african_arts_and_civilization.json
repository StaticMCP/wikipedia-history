Through its efforts, the centre aims to safeguard, conserve, and promote this heritage, thereby enhancing its understanding and appreciation.\nHistory\nThe commission is a parastatal under the Federal Ministry of Information and National Orientation to oversee the cultural preservation.

It was upgraded to a Pan-African Heritage Centre in 2000.\nFunctions\nIn accordance with the provision of the Constitution, sections 14(3) and 4, the commission is mandated to develop and issue guidelines for government agencies, employers, and providers of services and socio-economic amenities nationwide to preserve and promote the African cultural heritage through creative economy.\nDirector-General and members\n#Aisha Augie-Kuta a Nigerian photographer, filmmaker, and creative artist.\nReferences"
