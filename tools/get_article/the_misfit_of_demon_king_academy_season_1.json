Two new students, Anos Voldigoad and Misha Necron, are bullied by Zepes Indu, an arrogant royal. Anos, who is secretly the reincarnated Demon King, easily humiliates him by repeatedly killing and resurrecting Zepes until he surrenders. Anos invites Misha to his home, where it is explained by Anos' parents that he used his magic to rapidly age. Anos is accosted by Zepes and his brother, Leorig, who explains that nobles and royals ensure their supremacy by secretly murdering any hybrids born with powerful magic. Leorig then murders Zepes for humiliating the family. However, Anos is unaffected by Leorig's magic, explaining that as their founding ancestor, he is the origin of their magic. He then defeats Leorig by summoning Zepes as a vengeful zombie. Victorious, Anos fully resurrects Zepes and Leorig and declares he will retake his throne as Demon King. The next day, Anos receives his student crest which identifies him as the most powerful new student, but also a total misfit.\n|LineColor            = 341B17\n}}\n| Aux4                =\n| ShortSummary        = 2,000 years ago, Anos, tired of war, made a deal with the human hero Kanon to sacrifice his life to separate the Demon, Human, Spirit and God realms for 1,000 years so peace could flourish. In the present, Anos learns he was deemed a misfit because the history of the Demon King has been grossly misinterpreted. He proves his intelligence by correcting the spell of his teacher, Emilia Ludowell, doubling its power. He then proves his power by overwhelming Sasha Necron, Misha's arrogant sister, with her own spell. Sasha challenges Anos to a duel in the team exam. If Sasha loses, she will join Anos' team, but if Anos loses, he becomes her slave. Anos easily wins using his immense physical strength and overwhelming magic. After Sasha unwillingly agrees to join his team, Anos reveals he went easy on her because Misha loves Sasha and wanted to be on the same team as her, plus he thinks Sasha's demon eyes are beautiful. After introducing Sasha to his parents, who are shocked he brought two girls home, Sasha secretly thanks Anos for helping her reconcile her difficult relationship with Misha, and kisses him.\n|LineColor            = 341B17\n}}\n| Aux4                =\n| ShortSummary        = Ivis Necron, one of the seven Elder Demon Emperors Anos created from his blood, now runs the academy as the seven deans. Anos realizes Ivis does not remember him, so he attempts to sends Ivis back in time to retrieve his memories. However, Ivis decides to remain neutral. For the next academy challenge, students are told to collect magic items from a castle which is actually Anos' home from 2,000 years ago. He decides to collect a scepter at the lowest level. After collecting the scepter, he allows Misha to take one of his personal items, the Phoenix Robe, for Sasha's birthday to enhance her flame magic. However, Sasha stabs Misha and claims she was never their ally, but was waiting for a chance to betray them. Anos claims she is lying since her demonic eyes should have activated under intense emotion, but they did not. Sasha flees with the robe and scepter, claiming she hates Misha. Misha admits to Anos that she will disappear the moment she and Sasha turn 15 and that the person he thinks of as Misha does not actually exist.\n|LineColor            = 341B17\n}}\n| Aux4                =\n| ShortSummary        = When Sasha was a fetus, Ivis split her into two babies so when they turn 15, they would fuse into a single more powerful demon. Anos catches up with Sasha who reveals she actually wants to save Misha. Anos reveals that if he sends them back in time, they can fuse with their unborn fetuses so they will be born as true twin sisters. Anos is then stabbed by Ivis. Anos activates the time spell only to be blocked by Eugo La Raviaz, Guardian God of Time. Fusing himself with Ivis, he seemingly kills Anos. However, Anos reappears unharmed. He sends Sasha and Misha to fuse with their unborn selves. He then destroys Ivis. After resurrecting Ivis, Anos returns all his unaltered memories, revealing Ivis only betrayed him because his memories had been altered by someone working for Avos Dilhevia. Sasha and Misha return, now as true sisters. Despite having saved Misha and altering the past, Anos nonchalantly decides to return his scepter to get a perfect score for the academy challenge. He also gives Misha a ring from his collection to enhance her magic, along with the Phoenix Robe he gave to Sasha.\n|LineColor            = 341B17\n}}\n| Aux4                =\n| ShortSummary        = In the past, a swordsman, Shin Reglia, won a great victory for Anos and was granted the ability to reincarnate.

Anos decides to let Misa and her Unitarian classmates join his team if they prove themselves. The academy begins magic sword lessons where Anos and the transfer student, Lay Glanzudlii, are the only ones strong enough to wield magic swords.

Later, Anos meets Melheis Boran, one of the Seven Elder Demon Emperors, who claims that while he believes that his memories were erased at some point, he is confident Anos is the Demon King of Tyranny. To show his gratitude to Misha, Anos takes her on an outing. During the outing, Ivis, using the disguise of a café cat, tells Anos that someone above Melheis is actually in control of the Unitarians. On the day of the tournament, Ivis tells Anos some more information that he has uncovered. As such, Anos decides to not participate.
