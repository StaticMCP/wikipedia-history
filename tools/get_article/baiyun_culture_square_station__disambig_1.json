In the eyes of passengers, the two platforms appear to be two one-way platforms located on different floors, but in fact they are opposite-type platforms, but the two platforms are completely blocked by a wall, so that passengers do not know that the two platforms are located on the same floor, similar to the design of the Line 2 stations between Feixiang Park station and Huangbian station (except ).\nLine 12 has an island platform located underneath Qifu Road. The platform is equipped with toilets and a nursery room.\nEntrances/exits\nThe station has 5 points of entry/exit, of which Exits A and B are located in the Line 2 west concourse, Exit C in the Line 2 east concourse, and Exits D and E are located in the Line 12 concourse. Exits B and C are accessible via stairlift and Exit D is accessible via elevator.\nLine 2 west concourse\n* A: Yuncheng Middle 3rd Road\n* B: Yuncheng Middle 2nd Road\nLine 2 east concourse\n* C: Yuncheng Middle 2nd Road, Guangzhou Urban Planning Exhibition Center\nLine 12 concourse\n* D: Yuncheng West Road\n* E: Qifu Road\nExit A, Baiyun Culture Square Station, Guangzhou Metro 20250706.jpg|Entrance A\nExit B, Baiyun Culture Square Station, Guangzhou Metro 20250706.jpg|Entrance B\nExit C, Baiyun Culture Square Station, Guangzhou Metro 20250706.jpg|Entrance C\nExit D, Baiyun Culture Square Station, Guangzhou Metro 20250630.jpg|Entrance D\nExit E, Baiyun Culture Square Station, Guangzhou Metro 20250630.jpg|Entrance E\nHistory\nLine 2\nThe station first appeared in 1997 in the \"Guangzhou City Expressway, Traffic Line Planning Research (Final Report)\", is a station along the line after the split of Line 2/8. Since the northern section of the planned line at that time was along Airport Road and National Highway 106, the station was also set up near the Airport Road and Xinshi, and was named Xinshi station at that time. Later, in the 2000 plan, in response to the relocation of the old Baiyun Airport, the northern section of Line 2 north of  was also changed to follow the middle axis of the old Baiyun Airport, and the station location was also changed to the current location.\nIn February 2010, the station was named Baiyun Culture Square station according to the city square surrounded by the planned Municipal Museum, Guangzhou Urban Planning and Exhibition Center, Provincial Academy of Painting, Municipal Academy of Painting, and Lingnan Cultural Center. Due to the late construction schedule of relevant cultural venues, there was no square named \"Baiyun Culture Square\" for a long time, and many citizens were misled by the name of the station. It was not until April 2023 that the \"Baiyun New Town Civic Square\" appeared on the Line 2 map. Because the name of the station does not correspond to the actual place, this station and the two stations of  and , which also belong to Line 2, are nicknamed \"Baiyun Three Liars\" by citizens.\nThe station officially started construction in 2007. On 25 September 2010, the station was opened with the new Line 2 and Line 8.\nDuring COVID-19 pandemic control rules in 2022, the station was affected by prevention and control measures many times and needed to adjust its services. During the epidemic in April, the station was suspended from 9 to 17 April. During the year-end epidemic, the station was suspended from 21 to 27 November.\nLine 12\nIn the 1997 \"Guangzhou Urban Expressway\" Traffic Network Planning Study (Final Report), the interchange station between Line 2 and Line 6 (the relevant section became the current Line 12) was located at Gangbei station at the intersection of Airport Road Gangbei Road, before it was changed to the current Baiyun Park station with Line 2 in the 2000 plan. However, in 2016, in response to the planning needs of Tangxi Station of the National Railway (now Guangzhou Baiyun railway station), the planned route of Line 12 was changed to intersect with Line 2 at this station.\nThe station of Line 12 was originally located on the east side of the Yuncheng West Road intersection of Yuncheng Middle 3rd Road, directly connected to the west concourse of Line 2, and at the same time, the Line 12 platform is planned to be connected to the side of platform 1 on the Line 2 east concourse. Although the station plan has a relatively close transfer distance, it is necessary to pass under many houses within  and Xiaogang Village between the adjacent areas of the station, which comes with a greater construction risk. Therefore, the station was moved north and set up on the east side of the intersection between Yuncheng West Road and Qifu Road, and the distance from the Line 2 was greatly increased, so only a transfer passage connecting the Line 2 west concourse could be built. As the transfer passage is 350 meters long, there will be moving walkways within the passageway. At the same time, the existing Line 2 station will be expanded and the waiting space of the Line 2 station will also be expanded. An escalator crossing under the Line 2 track area was added to meet the need for interchanges between Line 2 northbound and Line 12.\nOn 11 October 2019, Qifu Road was enclosed, and on 7 November 2019, Exhibition Road was enclosed to cooperate with the construction of the Line 12 station. The roof slab was sealed in October 2022. Part of the Line 2 station was also enclosed in October 2024 to facilitate the connection to the Line 12 station and the commencement of related ancillary works. The Line 12 station completed the \"three rights\" transfer on 27 March 2025.\nOn 29 June 2025, the Line 12 station opened.\nNotes\n}}\nReferences"
