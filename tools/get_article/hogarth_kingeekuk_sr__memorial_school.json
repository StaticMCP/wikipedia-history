It is a part of the Bering Strait School District.\nThe school serves as a community center for Savoonga residents. ECI/Hyer Architecture and Interiors built the current school facility, which has asymmetrical trusses and covered entry and exit porches that use Alaska Native-style poles. The building won the merit award from the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Alaska chapter.\nBy 2013 the school received a $1 million grant from the federal government's School Improvement Grant (SIG).\nCurriculum\nthe curriculum heavily emphasizes mathematics and reading due to influences from the SIG grant, with daily emphasis on each taking up two blocks. As of that year it uses the \"Success for All\" teaching program and other programs used to raise test scores. The school previously taught a class on Yupik culture and Yupik language but a lack of students enrolling in the class was one reason for its cancellation.\nAcademic performance\nIn 2003 9% of the students were proficient in Alaska state reading tests. By 2011 this increased to 29%.\nFrom 2003 to 2013 the attendance rate declined; many students who needed to work to support the families felt stymied by an increase in the school year and school day that was mandated by the federal government.  the attendance rate was 85%. Rates of students graduating from school decreased during the same period.\nTeaching staff\nthe administrative staff and the head teachers were White Americans; a lack of local Alaska natives with university educations meant that the school district recruited staff from the Lower 48. Each class had a teacher's aide who was Yupik.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
