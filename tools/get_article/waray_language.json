It is the native language of the Waray people and second language of the Abaknon people of Capul, Northern Samar, and some Cebuano-speaking peoples of western and southern parts of Leyte island. It is the third most spoken language among the Bisayan languages, only behind Cebuano and Hiligaynon.\nNomenclature\nThe term Waray comes from the word often heard by non-speakers meaning 'none' or 'nothing' in the language; similarly, Cebuanos are known in Leyte as  and their language as Kana (after the oft-heard word , meaning 'that' in the Cebuano language). The Cebuano pronunciation of Waray is  with the same meaning.\nDuring the Spanish period, texts refer to the language as simply being a dialect of \"Visayan\". In contrast, most contemporary linguists consider many of these \"Visayan dialects\" (e.g., Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Karay-a, etc.) to be distinct languages, and the term Visayan is usually taken to refer to what is called Cebuano in contemporary linguistic literature. Domingo Ezguerra's 1663 (reprinted 1747)  refers to the \"Visayan tongue of the province of Leyte\", Figueroa's  refers to the \"Visaya language of Samar and Leyte\". Antonio Sanchez's 1914  (Spanish-Visayan Dictionary) refers to the speech of \"Sámar and Leyte\".\nDialects\nLinguist Jason Lobel (2009) considers there are 25 dialects and subdialects of Waray-Waray.\n* Tacloban: \"standard\" dialect: the dialect used in television and radio broadcasts and in education\n* Abuyog, Leyte: heavy Cebuano influence\n* Culaba, Biliran: heavy Cebuano influence\n* Catbalogan: \"original\" dialect: Pure Waray, central part of Samar Island\n* Calbayog: mixture of the Tacloban dialect and the dialect of Northern Samar\n* Allen, Northern Samar: mostly Waray Sorsoganon mixed with Northern Samarenyo. Dialects in neighboring towns have also borrowed extensively from Waray Sorsoganon.\nMany Waray dialects feature a sound change in which Proto-Bisayan *s becomes  in a small number of common grammatical morphemes. This sound change occurs in all areas of Samar south of the municipalities of Santa Margarita, Matuginao, Las Navas, and Gamay (roughly corresponding to the provinces of Samar and Eastern Samar, but not Northern Samar), as well as in all of the Waray-speaking areas of Leyte, except the towns of Javier and Abuyog. However, this sound change is an areal feature rather than a strictly genetic one (Lobel 2009).\nMost Waray dialects in northeastern and Eastern Samar have the close central unrounded vowel  as a reflex of Proto-Austronesian *e.\nUsage\nWaray is one of the many regional languages found in the Philippines and used in local government.\nIt is widely used in media particularly in television and radio broadcasts, however, not in print media because most regional newspapers are published in English.\nThe language is used in education from kindergarten to primary level as part of the Philippine government's K–12 program since 2012 in which pupils from kindergarten to third grade are taught in their respective indigenous languages.\nWaray is also used in the Mass in the Roman Catholic Church and in the worship services of different Christian sects in the region. Bibles in Waray are also available. In 2019, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures was released in Waray-Waray. However, there is a growing population of Muslims in the region with the first mosque, Tacloban Mosque and Islamic Center, through a charity built by a Turkish Islamic religious authority in Tacloban at 2017 which teaches the scriptures and offers Friday sermons in both Waray and Cebuano in general.\nPhonology\nVowels\nMost Waray dialects have three vowel phonemes:  ,   and  . Some dialects have an additional vowel  ; words with  in these dialects have  in the majority dialects.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!align=\"center\"|Front\n!align=\"center\"|Central\n!Back\n|-align=\"center\"\n!Close/Mid\n|\n|()\n|\n|-align=\"center\"\n!Open\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nConsonants\nWaray has a total of 16 consonant phonemes: . Two extra postalveolar sounds  are heard when  occurs after , further proceeding another vowel sound.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!Labial\n!Alveolar\n!Dorsal\n!Glottal\n|-\n!Nasal\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Stop\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Fricative\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Rhotic\n|\n|~\n|\n|\n|-\n!Approximant\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nAlphabet\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; table-layout:fixed\"\n|+ Waray alphabet\n!

There is no officially-approved orthography for the language and different writers may use differing orthographic styles. In general, it has become common to write the language following the current orthographic conventions of Filipino.\nVocabulary\nWaray uses many different words to specify a particular thing. These words might not be the same in spelling and in construction but they share the same meaning, making it a very diverse language.\nHere are some examples of demonstratives and adverbs together with their equivalent definition in Waray-Waray:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \"border=1\"\n!

From eleven onwards, Spanish numbers are exclusively used in Waray today, their native counterparts being almost unheard of by the majority of native speakers (except for  for hundred and  for thousand). Some, especially the old ones, are spoken alongside the Spanish counterparts.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \"border=1\"\n! English !! Native Waray !! Derived from Spanish !!

These words are being adopted to fill lexical gaps of the recipient language. Spanish colonialization introduced new systems to the Philippine society.\nSee also\n* Waray people\n* Waray literature\n* Waray Wikipedia\n* Languages of the Philippines\n* Samar\n* Leyte\n* Waray Sorsogon language\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Abuyen, Tomas A.
