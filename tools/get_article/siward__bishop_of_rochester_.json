He was consecrated in 1058. He died in 1075. His death was commemorated on 30 October, so he probably died on that date in 1075. After the appointment of Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury, the new archbishop found only four canons at Rochester under Siward's authority.\nCitations\nReferences\n* [http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33873 British History Online Bishops of Rochester] accessed on 30 October 2007\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n\n---\n\n## Siward (Bishop of Rochester)\n\n#REDIRECT Siward (bishop of Rochester)"
