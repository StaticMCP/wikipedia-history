There were a total of 105 murders in the Czech Republic in 2012.\nCorruption\nPolitical corruption (especially bribery) and theft are some of the most severe issues in the Czech Republic. Group of States Against Corruption mainly criticises the lack of pro-active monitoring of the financing and states that an effective supervisory mechanism is missing.\nA survey of Transparency International in 2009 showed that fewer than 1 in 10 respondents find the anti-corruption efforts of their government effective. In 2010, 44% of people answered that the corruption increased.\nTerror attacks\nIn 2014, 2 explosions destroyed 2 munition warehouses in Vrbětice, killing 2 people. Originally left unsolved, the explosions were revealed in 2021 to have been committed by the Russian secret service.\nIn January 2019 a 71-year-old Czech pensioner, Jaromír Balda, was sentenced to four years for terrorism after he had cut down trees to block railway lines in order to pretend Islamists were responsible. He had  left messages at the scene saying \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is great\" in Arabic). He became the first (and remains the only) Czech person convicted of terrorism. He was released after 2 years and 8 months on the condition he would accept regular psychiatric treatment.\nYouth crime\nSee also\n* Human trafficking in the Czech Republic\n* Law enforcement in the Czech Republic\n* List of Czech criminals\nReferences"
