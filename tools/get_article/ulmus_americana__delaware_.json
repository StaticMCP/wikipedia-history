'Delaware' is susceptible to Elm Yellows, but resistant to the Elm Leaf Beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola.\nCultivation\nThe original tree, which had been moved to the USDA National Arboretum, Washington, D. C. in 1948, died from unknown causes (probably elm yellows, by some accounts) in 1980, but a clone survives at the Denver Botanic Gardens, as 'Delaware II'. Seven specimens stand in the National Mall area, Washington D.C. Although propagated for further trials, the tree was never commercially released owing to its poor shape. 'Delaware' is not known to have been introduced to Europe or Australasia.\nFile:Washington Road Elm Allée (east side).jpg|Mature 'Princeton' elms on right, planted 1920s; 'Delaware' on left, planted in 1983, in a side allée of the Washington Road Elm Allée, Princeton, New Jersey, US (2011)\nSynonymy\n*'Delaware II'.\nNB 'Delaware I' is the original name given to the hybrid 'Urban' before its commercial release.\nAccessions\nNorth America\n*Brooklyn Botanic Garden, [http://www.bbg.org/cgi/bgbase/search.cgi] , New York, US.
