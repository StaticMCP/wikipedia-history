Before that time, Imereti was considered a separate kingdom within the Kingdom of Georgia, of which a cadet branch of the Bagrationi royal family held the crown.\nThe realm was conquered by George V the Brilliant and once again united with the east Kingdom of Georgia. From 1463 onward, however, Imereti became a constant battleground between Georgian and Ottoman forces for several centuries, resulting in the kingdom's progressive decline due to this ongoing instability. These threats pushed local Georgian rulers to seek closer ties with Tsardom of Russia. In 1649, Imereti sent ambassadors to the Russian royal court and Russia returned favor in 1651. In the presence of Russian ambassadors, Alexander III of Imereti swore an oath of allegiance to Tsar Alexis of Russia. However, internal conflicts among Georgian royalty continued and, although Alexander III briefly managed to control all of Western Georgia, this consolidation was short lived. By the time of his death in 1660, Western Georgia was still in a state of flux. In this chaotic period, Archil of Imereti was enthroned and deposed several times. His efforts to secure assistance from Russia and, later, Pope Innocent XII proved unsuccessful and he was finally exiled to Russia.\nUnder pressure from Pavel Tsitsianov, in 1804 Solomon II of Imereti accepted Russian Imperial suzerainty, only to be deposed entirely in 1810. During the time that Imereti was a vassal state, the Mingrelia, Abkhazia and Guria princedoms declared their independence from Imereti and established their own governments.\nKings of Imereti\nFirst House of Imereti\n* David VI (1258–1293)\n* Constantine I (1293–1326)\n* Michael (1326–1329)\n* Bagrat I (1329–1330)\n* Vacant (1330–1387)\n* Alexandre I (1387–1389)\n* George I (1389–1392)\n* Vacant (1392–1396)\n* Constantine II (1396–1401)\n* Demetrius I (1401–1455), only recognized as Duke by Alexander I of Georgia\nBagrationi dynasty of Imereti\n* Demetrius II (1446–1452)\n* Bagrat II (1463–1478)\n* Alexander II (1478–1510)\n* Bagrat III (1510–1565)\n* George II (1565–1585)\n* Leon (1585–1588)\n* Rostom (1588–1589, 1590–1605)\n* Bagrat IV (1589–1590)\n* George III (1605–1639)\n* Alexander III (1639–1660)\n* Bagrat V (1660–1661, 1663–1668, 1669–1678, 1679–1681)\n* Archil (1661–63, 1678–79, 1690–91, 1695–96, 1698)\n* Demetre (1663–1664)\n* George IV (1681–1683)\n* Alexander IV (1683–1690, 1691–1695)\n* Simon (1699–1701)\n* George V (1696–1698)\n* Mamia (1701–02, 1711, 1713)\n* George VI (1702–1707)\n* George VII (1707–11, 1712–13, 1713–16, 1719–1720)\n* George VIII (1716)\n* Alexander V (1720–1741, 1741–1746, 1749–1752)\n* George IX (1741)\n* Mamuka (1746–1749)\n* Solomon I (1752–1766, 1768–1784)\n* Teimuraz (1766–1768)\n* David II (1784–1789, 1790–1791)\n* Solomon II (1789–1790, 1792–1810)\nHeirs of King of Solomon I of Imereti\nThe dynastic senior line of the Imeretian Bagrationi since 1784.
