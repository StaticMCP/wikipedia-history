Oak and Silver birch dominate most of the woodland in this protected area, over an understorey of hazel. Limestone workings at the site have allowed plant species adapted to alkaline soil to grow here, including fairy flax and twayblade.\nBird species diversity at Kingsbury Woodland includes three species of woodpecker, six species of tits and six species of warbler. Treecreeper, tawny owl and woodcock have also been recorded here.\nAll of the land within the site designated as Kingsbury Wood SSSI is owned by the Ministry of Defence. The whole protected area is located inside Kingsbury Rifle Range (access is closed when red flags are flying).\nReferences"
