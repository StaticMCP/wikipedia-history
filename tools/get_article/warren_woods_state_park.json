The state park is leased by private owners to the state of Michigan.\nHistory\nThe woods are named for Edward Kirk Warren (1847-1919), the inventor of the featherbone corset (which replaced the whalebone in corsets with turkey feathers and secured his fortune). Starting in 1879, Warren bought  of the woods and  of the dunes, setting them aside for preservation.\nNatural features\nThe park is home to the last climax beech-maple forest in Michigan, which occupies . The virgin North American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) forest has specimens  tall and with girths greater than  in diameter. The remaining area in the park consists of floodplain oak-hickory forest. Because of the size and age of the trees, and the rarity of the ecosystem, the area has been designated since 1967 as a National Natural Landmark. Many of the beeches, with their smooth, thin, silver-grey bark, are heavily scarred by hand-carved graffiti, some of it decades old; however, the practice seems to have fallen out of favor in recent years.\nActivities and amenities\nThe park has few facilities and is administered by nearby Warren Dunes State Park. Most visitors come to walk the  of hiking trails, which run from the northern boundary on Warren Woods Road to a parking area accessed from the southern boundary on Elm Valley Road. In the middle of the park the trail crosses the Galien River on a pedestrian bridge, where there is an interpretive station. The park is adjacent to the  Warren Woods Ecological Field Station, which is owned and operated by the University of Chicago.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ParksandTrails/Details.aspx?id=505&type=SPRK Warren Woods State Park] Michigan Department of Natural Resources\n*[https://www.michigandnr.com/Publications/PDFS/RecreationCamping/warren_woods.pdf Warren Woods State Park Map] Michigan Department of Natural Resources"
