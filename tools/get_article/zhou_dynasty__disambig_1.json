During the Western Zhou period (771&nbsp;BC), the royal house, surnamed Ji, had military control over territories centered on the Wei River valley and North China Plain. Even as Zhou suzerainty became increasingly ceremonial over the following Eastern Zhou period (771–256&nbsp;BC), the political system created by the Zhou royal house survived in some form for several additional centuries. A date of 1046&nbsp;BC for the Zhou's establishment is supported by the Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project and David Pankenier, but David Nivison and Edward L. Shaughnessy date the establishment to 1045&nbsp;BC.\nThe latter Eastern Zhou period is itself roughly subdivided into two parts. During the Spring and Autumn period (), power became increasingly decentralized as the authority of the royal house diminished. The Warring States period (221&nbsp;BC) that followed saw large-scale warfare and consolidation among what had formerly been Zhou client states, until the Zhou were formally extinguished by the state of Qin in 256&nbsp;BC. The Qin ultimately founded the imperial Qin dynasty in 221&nbsp;BC after conquering all of China.\nThe Zhou period is often considered to be the zenith for the craft of Chinese bronzeware. The latter Zhou period is also famous for the advent of three major Chinese philosophies: Confucianism, Taoism and Legalism. The Zhou dynasty also spans the period when the predominant form of written Chinese became seal script, which evolved from the earlier oracle bone and bronze scripts. By the dynasty's end, an immature form of clerical script had also emerged.\nHistory\nFoundation\nTraditional myth\nAccording to Chinese mythology, the Zhou lineage began when Jiang Yuan, a consort of the legendary Emperor Ku, miraculously conceived a child, Qi \"the Abandoned One\", after stepping into the divine footprint of Shangdi. Qi was a culture hero credited with surviving abandonment by his mother three times, and with greatly improving agriculture, to the point where he was granted lordship over Tai, the surname Ji, and the title Houji \"Lord of Millet\", by the Emperor Shun.\"Emperor Shun said, 'Qi, the black-haired people begin to be famished. Do you, Lord of Millet, sow in their seasons the various kinds of grain.' He enfeoffed Qi at Tai; [Qi's] title was Lord of Millet; and his distinctive surname was Ji.\"}} He even received sacrifice as a harvest god. The term Houji was probably a hereditary title attached to a lineage.\nBuzhu—Qi's son, or rather that of the Houji—is said to have abandoned his position as Agrarian Master () in old age and either he or his son Ju abandoned their tradition, living in the manner of the Xirong and Rongdi (see Hua–Yi distinction). Ju's son Liu, however, led his people to prosperity by restoring agriculture and settling them at a place called Bin,}} which his descendants ruled for generations. Tai later led the clan from Bin to Zhou, an area in the Wei River valley (modern Qishan County).\nThe duke passed over his two elder sons Taibo and Zhongyong to favor the younger Jili, a warrior in his own right. As a vassal of the Shang kings Wu Yi and Wen Ding, Jili went to conquer several Xirong tribes before being treacherously killed by Shang forces. Taibo and Zhongyong had supposedly already fled to the Yangtze delta, where they established the state of Wu among the tribes there. Jili's son Wen bribed his way out of imprisonment and moved the Zhou capital to Feng (present-day Xi'an). Around 1046&nbsp;BC, Wen's son Wu and his ally Jiang Ziya led an army of 45,000 men and 300 chariots across the Yellow River and defeated King Zhou of Shang at the Battle of Muye, marking the beginning of the Zhou dynasty. The Zhou enfeoffed a member of the defeated Shang royal family as the Duke of Song, which was held by descendants of the Shang royal family until its end. This practice was referred to as .\nCulture\nAccording to Nicholas Bodman, the Zhou appear to have spoken a language largely similar in vocabulary and syntax to that of the Shang; a recent study by David McCraw, using lexical statistics, reached the same conclusion. The Zhou emulated Shang cultural practices, possibly to legitimize their own rule, and became the successors to Shang culture. At the same time, the Zhou may also have been connected to the Xirong, a broadly defined cultural group to the west of the Shang, which the Shang regarded as tributaries. For example, the philosopher Mencius (372–289&nbsp;BC) acknowledged that King Wen of Zhou had ancestry from among the Xirong, as King Wen's descendants, the Zhou kings, claimed descent from Hou Ji, a legendary culture hero possibly related to the Xirong through his mother Jiang Yuan. Additionally, the late 4th-century&nbsp;BC Zuo Zhuan comments that the baron of Li Rong (), after being defeated by Jin, married his daughter Li Ji off. According to historian Li Feng, the term \"Rong\" during the Western Zhou period was likely used to designate political and military adversaries rather than cultural and ethnic \"others\". Cultural artifacts of the Western Rong coexisted with Western Zhou bronzes, indicating close bonds between the Rong and the Western Zhou.\nWestern Zhou\nDuring the Western Zhou (1045–771&nbsp;BC), King Wu maintained the old capital for ceremonial purposes but constructed a new one for his palace and administration nearby at Haojing. Although Wu's early death left a young and inexperienced heir, the Duke of Zhou assisted his nephew King Cheng in consolidating royal power. Wary of the Duke of Zhou's increasing power, the \"Three Guards\", Zhou princes stationed on the eastern plain, rose in rebellion against his regency. Even though they garnered the support of independent-minded nobles, Shang partisans, and several Dongyi tribes, the Duke of Zhou quelled the rebellion, and further expanded the Zhou Kingdom into the east. To maintain Zhou authority over its greatly expanded territory and prevent other revolts, he set up the fengjian system. Furthermore, he countered Zhou's crisis of legitimacy by expounding the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven while accommodating important Shang rituals at Wangcheng and Chengzhou.\nOver time, this decentralized system became strained as the familial relationships between the Zhou kings and the regional dynasties thinned over the generations. Peripheral territories developed local power and prestige on par with that of the Zhou.\nThe conflicts with nomadic tribes from the north and the northwest, variously known as the Xianyun, Guifang, or various \"Rong\" tribes, such as the  Xirong, Shanrong or Quanrong, intensified towards the end of the Western Zhou period. These tribes are recorded as harassing Zhou territory, but at the time the Zhou were expanding northwards, encroaching on their traditional lands—especially the Wei River valley. Archaeologically, the Zhou expanded to the north and the northwest at the expense of the Siwa culture.\nWhen King You demoted and exiled his Qiang queen in favor of the commoner Bao Si, the disgraced queen's father the Marquis of Shen joined with Zeng and the Quanrong. The Quanrong put an end to the Western Zhou in 771&nbsp;BC, sacking the Zhou capital at Haojing and killing the last Western Zhou king You. With King You dead, a conclave of nobles met at Shen and declared the Marquis's grandson King Ping. The capital was moved eastward to Wangcheng, marking the beginning of the Eastern Zhou period.\nEastern Zhou\n}}\nThe Eastern Zhou period (771–256&nbsp;BC) was characterized by an accelerating collapse of royal authority, although the king's ritual importance enabled more than five additional centuries of rule. The Spring and Autumn Annals, the Confucian chronicle of the early years of this process, gave the period its name as the Spring and Autumn period. The partition of Jin during the mid-5th century&nbsp;BC is a commonly cited as initiating the subsequent Warring States period. In 403&nbsp;BC, the Zhou court recognized Han, Zhao, and Wei as fully independent states. In 344, Duke Hui of Wei was the first to claim the title of \"king\" for himself. Others followed, marking a turning point, as rulers did not even entertain the pretense of vassalage of the Zhou court, instead proclaiming themselves fully independent kingdoms. A series of states rose to prominence before each falling in turn, and in most of these conflicts Zhou was a minor player.\nThe last Zhou king is traditionally taken to be Nan, who was killed when Qin captured Wangcheng in 256&nbsp;BC. Duke Wen of Eastern Zhou declared himself to be \"King Hui\", but his splinter state was fully disassembled by 249. Qin's wars of unification concluded in 221&nbsp;BC with Qin Shi Huang's annexation of Qi.\nThe Eastern Zhou is also remembered as the golden age of Chinese philosophy: the Hundred Schools of Thought which flourished as rival lords patronized itinerant scholars is led by the example of Qi's Jixia Academy. The Nine Schools of Thought which came to dominate the others were Confucianism as interpreted by Mencius and others, Legalism, Taoism, Mohism, the utopian communalist Agriculturalism, two strains of the School of Diplomacy, the School of Names, Sun Tzu's School of the Military, and the School of Naturalists. While only the first three of these would receive imperial patronage in later dynasties, doctrines from each influenced the others and Chinese society in sometimes unusual ways. The Mohists for instance found little interest in their praise of meritocracy but much acceptance for their mastery of defensive siege warfare; much later, however, their arguments against nepotism were used in favor of establishing the imperial examination system.\nCulture and society\nThe Zhou heartland was the Wei River valley; this remained their primary base of power after conquering the Shang.\nMandate of Heaven\nZhou rulers introduced the Mandate of Heaven, which would prove to be among East Asia's most enduring political doctrines. According to the theory, Heaven imposed a mandate to replace the Shang with the Zhou, whose moral superiority justified seizing Shang wealth and territory in order to return good governance to the people.\nThe Mandate of Heaven was presented as a religious compact between the Zhou people and their supreme god in heaven. The Zhou agreed that since worldly affairs were supposed to align with those of the heavens, the heavens conferred legitimate power on only one person, the Zhou ruler. In return, the ruler was duty-bound to uphold heaven's principles of harmony and honor. Any ruler who failed in this duty, who let instability creep into earthly affairs, or who let his people suffer, would lose the mandate. Under this system, it was the prerogative of spiritual authority to withdraw support from any wayward ruler and to find another, more worthy one. In this way, the Zhou sky god legitimized regime change.\nIn using this creed, the Zhou rulers had to acknowledge that any group of rulers, even they themselves, could be ousted if they lost the mandate of heaven because of improper practices. The book of odes written during the Zhou period clearly intoned this caution.\nThe Zhou kings contended that heaven favored their triumph because the last Shang kings had been evil men whose policies brought pain to the people through waste and corruption. After the Zhou came to power, the mandate became a political tool.\nOne of the duties and privileges of the king was to create a royal calendar. This official document defined times for undertaking agricultural activities and celebrating rituals. But unexpected events such as solar eclipses or natural calamities threw the ruling house's mandate into question. Since rulers claimed that their authority came from heaven, the Zhou made great efforts to gain accurate knowledge of the stars and to perfect the astronomical system on which they based their calendar.\nZhou legitimacy also arose indirectly from Shang material culture through the use of bronze ritual vessels, statues, ornaments, and weapons. As the Zhou emulated the Shang's large scale production of ceremonial bronzes, they developed an extensive system of bronze metalworking that required a large force of tribute labor. Many of its members were Shang, who were sometimes forcibly transported to new Zhou to produce the bronze ritual objects which were then sold and distributed across the lands, symbolizing Zhou legitimacy.\nFeudalism\nA Western Zhou ceremonial bronze of cooking-vessel form inscribed to record that the King of Zhou gave a fiefdom to Shi You, ordering that he inherit the title as well as the land and people living there\nWestern writers often describe the Zhou period as feudal because the Zhou's fengjian system invites comparison with European political systems during the Middle Ages.\n, painting on silk, dated to 5th–3rd century&nbsp;BC, from Zidanku Tomb no. 1 in Changsha, Hunan]]\npainting from the Jingmen Tomb of the state of Chu (704–223&nbsp;BC), depicting men wearing precursors to hanfu dress and riding in a two-horsed chariot]]\nThere were many similarities between the decentralized systems. When the dynasty was established, the conquered land was divided into hereditary fiefs (, zhūhóu) that eventually became powerful in their own right. In matters of inheritance, the Zhou dynasty recognized only patrilineal primogeniture as legal. According to Hsi-Sheng Tao, \"the Tsung-fa or descent line system has the following characteristics: patrilineal descent, patrilineal succession, patriarchate, sib-exogamy, and primogeniture\"\nThe system, also called \"extensive stratified patrilineage\", was defined by the anthropologist Kwang-chih Chang as \"characterized by the fact that the eldest son of each generation formed the main of line descent and political authority, whereas the younger brothers were moved out to establish new lineages of lesser authority. The farther removed, the lesser the political authority\". Ebrey defines the descent-line system as follows: \"A great line (ta-tsung) is the line of eldest sons continuing indefinitely from a founding ancestor. A lesser line is the line of younger sons going back no more than five generations. Great lines and lesser lines continually spin off new lesser lines, founded by younger sons\".\nK.E. Brashier writes in his book \"Ancestral Memory in Early China\" about the tsung-fa system of patrilineal primogeniture: \"The greater lineage, if it has survived, is the direct succession from father to eldest son and is not defined via the collateral shifts of the lesser lineages. In discussions that demarcate between trunk and collateral lines, the former is called a zong and the latter a zu, whereas the whole lineage is dubbed the shi. [...] On one hand, every son who is not the eldest and hence not heir to the lineage territory has the potential of becoming a progenitor and fostering a new trunk lineage (Ideally he would strike out to cultivate new lineage territory). [...] According to the Zou commentary, the son of heaven divided land among his feudal lords, his feudal lords divided the land among their dependent families and so forth down the pecking order to the officers who had their dependent kin and the commoners who \"each had his apportioned relations and all had their graded precedence\"\"\nThis type of unilineal descent-group later became the model of the Korean family through the influence of Neo-Confucianism, as Zhu Xi and others advocated its re-establishment in China.\nFengjian system and bureaucracy\nThere were five peerage ranks below the royal ranks, in descending order with common English translations: gōng 公 \"duke\", hóu 侯 \"marquis\", bó 伯 \"count\", zǐ 子 \"viscount\", and nán'' 男 \"baron\". At times, a vigorous duke would take power from his nobles and centralize the state. Centralization became more necessary as the states began to war among themselves and decentralization encouraged more war. If a duke took power from his nobles, the state would have to be administered bureaucratically by appointed officials.\nDespite these similarities, there are a number of important differences from medieval Europe. One obvious difference is that the Zhou ruled from walled cities rather than castles. Another was China's distinct class system, which lacked an organized clergy but saw Shang-descent yeomen become masters of ritual and ceremony, as well as astronomy, state affairs and ancient canons, known as ru (). When a dukedom was centralized, these people would find employment as government officials or officers. These hereditary classes were similar to Western knights in status and breeding, but unlike the European equivalent, they were expected to be something of a scholar instead of a warrior. Being appointed, they could move from one state to another. Some would travel from state to state peddling schemes of administrative or military reform. Those who could not find employment would often end up teaching young men who aspired to official status. The most famous of these was Confucius, who taught a system of mutual duty between superiors and inferiors. In contrast, the Legalists had no time for Confucian virtue and advocated a system of strict laws and harsh punishments.\nAgriculture\nThe Shi Qiang pan (), inscribed with the accomplishments of the earliest Zhou kings\nAgriculture in the Zhou dynasty was very intensive and, in many cases, directed by the government. All farming lands were owned by nobles, who then gave their land to their serfs, a situation similar to European feudalism. For example, a piece of land was divided into nine squares in the well-field system, with the grain from the middle square taken by the government and that of surrounding squares kept by individual farmers. This way, the government was able to store surplus food and distribute it in times of famine or bad harvest. Some important manufacturing sectors during this period included bronze smelting, which was integral to making weapons and farming tools. Again, these industries were dominated by the nobility who directed the production of such materials.\nChina's first projects of hydraulic engineering were initiated during the Zhou dynasty, ultimately as a means to aid agricultural irrigation. Sunshu Ao, the Chancellor of Wei who served King Zhuang of Chu, dammed a river to create an enormous irrigation reservoir in modern-day northern Anhui province. For this, Sunshu is credited as China's first hydraulic engineer. The later Wei statesman Ximen Bao, who served Marquis Wen of Wei (445–396&nbsp;BC), was the first hydraulic engineer of China to have created a large irrigation canal system. As the main focus of his grandiose project, his canal work eventually diverted the waters of the entire Zhang River to a spot further up the Yellow River.\nMilitary\n, a Qin terracotta figurine from a tomb near modern Xianyang in Shaanxi, 4th–3rd century BC]]\nThe early Western Zhou supported a strong army, split into two major units: \"the Six Armies of the west\" and \"the Eight Armies of Chengzhou\". The armies campaigned in the northern Loess Plateau, modern Ningxia and the Yellow River floodplain. The military prowess of Zhou peaked during the 19th year of King Zhao's reign, when the six armies were wiped out along with King Zhao on a campaign around the Han River. Early Zhou kings were true commanders-in-chief.\nKing Zhao was famous for repeated campaigns in the Yangtze region, and died on campaign. Later kings' campaigns were less effective. King Li led 14 armies against barbarians in the south, but failed to achieve any victory. King Xuan fought the Quanrong nomads in vain. King You was killed by the Quanrong when Haojing was sacked. Although chariots had been introduced to China during the Shang dynasty from Central Asia, the Zhou period saw the first major use of chariots in battle. Recent archaeological finds demonstrate similarities between horse burials of the Shang and Zhou dynasties with the steppe populations in the west, such as the Saka and Wusun. Other possible cultural influences resulting from contact with these Iranic people of Central Asia in this period may include fighting styles, head-and-hooves burials, art motifs and myths.\nThe Zhou army also included \"barbarian\" troops such as the Di people. King Hui of Zhou married a princess of the Red Di as a sign of appreciation for the importance of the Di troops. King Xiang of Zhou also married a Di princess after receiving Di military support.\nFile:Gold sword hilt Eastern Zhou BM.jpg|Gold sword hilt, Eastern Zhou, 6–5th century&nbsp;BCBritish Museum\nFile:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze sword.jpg|Eastern Zhou bronze sword excavated from Changsa, Hunan\nEastern Zhou Bronze Ji (Halberd) (10338222034).jpg|Eastern Zhou jǐ bronze halberd\nPhilosophy\n, Eastern Zhou or Han dynasty, 4th–3rd century&nbsp;BC.]]\n, Warring States periodHangzhou Museum]]\n, a set of bronze bianzhong percussion instruments from his tomb in Hubei, dated 433&nbsp;BC]]\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, the origins of native Chinese philosophy developed, its initial stages of development beginning in the 6th century&nbsp;BC. The greatest Chinese philosophers, those who made the greatest impact on later generations of Chinese, were Confucius, founder of Confucianism, and Laozi, founder of Taoism. Other philosophers of this era were Mozi, founder of Mohism; Mencius, the \"second sage\" of Confucianism; Shang Yang and Han Fei, responsible for the development of ancient Chinese Legalism; and Xunzi, who was arguably the center of ancient Chinese intellectual life during his time.\nThe state theology of the Zhou dynasty used concepts from the Shang dynasty and mostly referred to the Shang god, Di, as Tian, a more distant and unknowable concept, yet one that anyone could utilize, the opposite view of the Shang's spirituality. The Zhou wanted to increase the number of enlightenment seekers, mystics, and those who would be interested in learning about such things as a way to further distance their people from the Shang-era paradigm and local traditions.\nLi\nHaving emerged during the Western Zhou, the li ritual system encoded an understanding of manners as an expression of the social hierarchy, ethics, and regulation concerning material life; the corresponding social practices became idealized within Confucian ideology.\nThe system was canonized in the Book of Rites, Rites of Zhou, and Etiquette and Ceremonial compiled during the Han dynasty (202&nbsp;BC220&nbsp;AD), thus becoming the heart of the Chinese imperial ideology. While the system was initially a respected body of concrete regulations, the fragmentation of the Western Zhou period led the ritual to drift towards moralization and formalization in regard to:\n* The five orders of Chinese nobility\n* Ancestral temples (size, legitimate number of pavilions)\n* Ceremonial regulations (number of ritual vessels, musical instruments, people in the dancing troupe)\nSexuality\nAside from Shi Jing, the earliest Chinese poem anthology, where gender-ambiguity and same-sex affection both made an appearance, the Zhou dynasty involved many recorded forms of homosexuality, including farmers and soldiers.Hinsch, Bret. \"Passions of the Cut Sleeve.\" Academic Publisher. De Gruyter Brill, 1990. p. 18, . Bisexuality and/or homosexual practices often involved heterosexual marriage, foundational to kinship and social networks in the Zhou Dynasty and beyond in Imperial China, whereas male homosexuality was often \"class-based,\" meaning these relationships involved economic and social benefits.Hinsch, Bret. \"Passions of the Cut Sleeve.\" Academic Publisher. De Gruyter Brill, 1990. pp. 19–20, .\nKings\nThe rulers of the Zhou dynasty were titled wang (), which was also the term used by the Shang rulers, normally translated into English as 'king'.\nIn addition to these rulers, King Wu's immediate ancestors—Danfu, Jili, and Wen—are also referred to as \"Kings of Zhou\", despite having been nominal vassals of the Shang kings.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ List of Western Zhou kings\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"colgroup\" | Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Reign\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Personal\n! scope=\"col\" | Posthumous\n|-\n| Fa\n| King Wu\n|\n|-\n| Song\n| King Cheng\n|\n|-\n| Zhao\n| King Kang\n|\n|-\n| Xia\n| King Zhao\n|\n|-\n| Man\n| King Mu\n|\n|-\n| Yihu\n| King Gong }}\n|\n|-\n| Jian\n| King Yih\n|\n|-\n| Pifang\n| King Xiao\n|\n|-\n| Xie\n| King Yi\n|\n|-\n| Hu\n| King Li }}\n|\n|- style=\"background-color:#ccc\"\n| colspan=\"2\"  | Gonghe Regency\n| 841–828 BC\n|-\n| Jing\n| King Xuan\n| 827–782 BC\n|-\n| Gongsheng\n| King You\n| 781–771 BC\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ List of Eastern Zhou kings\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"colgroup\" | Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Reign\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Personal\n! scope=\"col\" | Posthumous\n|-\n| Yijiu\n| King Ping\n| 770–720 BC\n|-\n| Lin\n| King Huan\n| 719–697 BC\n|-\n| Tuo\n| King Zhuang\n| 696–682 BC\n|-\n| Huqi\n| King Xi\n| 681–677 BC\n|-\n| Lang\n| King Hui\n| 676–652 BC\n|-\n| Zheng\n| King Xiang\n| 651–619 BC\n|-\n| Renchen\n| King Qing\n| 618–613 BC\n|-\n| Ban\n| King Kuang\n| 612–607 BC\n|-\n| Yu\n| King Ding\n| 606–586 BC\n|-\n| Yi\n| King Jian\n| 585–572 BC\n|-\n| Xiexin\n| King Ling\n| 571–545 BC\n|-\n| Gui\n| King Jing\n| 544–521 BC\n|-\n| Meng\n| King Dao\n| 520 BC\n|-\n| Gai\n| King Jing\n| 519–476 BC\n|-\n| Ren\n| King Yuan\n| 475–469 BC\n|-\n| Jie\n| King Zhending\n| 468–442 BC\n|-\n| Quji\n| King Ai\n| 441 BC\n|-\n| Shu\n| King Si\n| 441 BC\n|-\n| Wei\n| King Kao\n| 440–426 BC\n|-\n| Wu\n| King Weilie\n| 425–402 BC\n|-\n| Jiao\n| King An\n| 401–376 BC\n|-\n| Xi\n| King Lie\n| 375–369 BC\n|-\n| Bian\n| King Xian\n| 368–321 BC\n|-\n| Ding\n| King Shenjing\n| 320–315 BC\n|-\n| Yan\n| King Nan\n| 314–256 BC\n|}\nNobles of the Ji family proclaimed Duke Hui of Eastern Zhou as King Nan's successor after their capital, Chengzhou, fell to Qin forces in 256 BC.

The remaining Ji family ruled Yan and Wei until 209 BC.\nDuring Confucius's lifetime in the Spring and Autumn period, Zhou kings had little power, and much administrative responsibility and de-facto political strength was wielded by rulers of smaller domains and local community leaders.\nAstrology\nIn traditional Chinese astrology, Zhou is represented by two stars, Eta Capricorni () and 21 Capricorni (), in \"Twelve States\" asterism.
