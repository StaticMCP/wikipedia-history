The award, which was named after Yeşilçam Street in the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul where many film studios were based during the 1950s-1970s, was created by the Alliance of Cinema Labour Unions' Yeşilçam Film Academy (YEFA) in protest against Turkish Foundation of Cinema and Audiovisual Culture (TÜRSAK)'s disregard of their suggestions to give the Yeşilçam Award, which had been awarded from 2008 to 2011, a more professional structure. The Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Beyoğlu Municipality, who had been organizers along with TÜRSAK of the previous awards, failed to offer their support to this new award. The First Yeşilçam Film Academy Awards, which was held on June 4, 2012 at the Cemal Reşit Rey Concert Hall (CRRKS) and broadcast live on the A Haber news channel, were described as a mess and have not been held again.\nAwards\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"toccolours\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|- style=\"background: #e0e0e0\"\n!
