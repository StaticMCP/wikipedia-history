The player can choose from three difficulties: Easy, medium or hard.\nCampaign\nThe Campaign is the main mode for Army Men: World War - Land, Sea, Air. Set in a \"realistic\" setting like the previous Army Men, it features 15 missions in total, which involves the player (as a Green soldier) completing certain objectives that may involve intercepting vehicles, escorting friendly soldiers and killing enemies on land, sea or air. The plot begins with the Tan Army attacking the Green Army by air and the Green Army later taking revenge, with the narrator announcing: \"We shall beat them on all fronts, returning force with force, whether it be by land, sea or air.\"\nBoot Camp\nBoot Camp is a training level in which the player learns the controls. It consists of training areas for all weapons and an obstacle course.\nReception\n| CNG = 4/10\n| GI = 1/10\n| GSpot = 6.5/10\n| IGN = 3/10\n| NGen =\n| OPM =\n}}\nThe game received \"generally unfavorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN called it \"awful\" for its \"shoddy controls, horrible clipping, lousy animation\" and \"bland grainy textures\". Emmett Schkloven of NextGen, however, said of the game, \"Fire up the newsreels and propaganda – the Army Men are back with a much better World War.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
