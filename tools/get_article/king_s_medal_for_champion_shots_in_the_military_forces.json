It could now be awarded to the champions of Army marksmanship competitions, held under battle conditions at annual central meetings in the United Kingdom, the British Dominions, Colonies and India. Early participating countries were Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.\nThe number of countries which awarded the King's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces grew to twelve by the mid-20th century, but as some countries gained independence from the United Kingdom or instituted their own equivalent awards, that number dwindled to the present three: the United Kingdom, Jamaica and New Zealand.\nAn Air Force version of the medal, the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces, was instituted in 1953. This was followed by the institution of the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the New Zealand Naval Forces in 1958 and the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines in 1966.\nInstitution\nQueen Victoria authorised the creation of the Medal for the Best Shot in the British Army, Infantry, by Royal Warrant dated 30 April 1869. The medal, initially struck in bronze and from 1872 in silver, was inscribed with the year in which won and the winner's name, number and regiment. It became the winner's property and could be worn by him during the whole of his service. From 1870, the medal was awarded annually, along with a £20 Prize for Skill at Arms, to the best shot of the Infantry of the British Army, including the Royal Engineers and the Colonial Corps. With only thirteen medals won, award of the medal and the £20 prize ceased after 1882. A £5 prize and a crowned badge of crossed carbines or rifles, worked in gold and worn upon the left arm, was approved to replace it on 10 June 1884.\nAfter a 41-year lapse, the medal was re-introduced by King George V in 1923 and designated the '''King's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces'''. The medal could now be awarded to the champions of Army marksmanship competitions, held under battle firing conditions at annual central meetings in the United Kingdom, India, the British Dominions and the Colony of Southern Rhodesia. Early participating countries were Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia.\nA date clasp was also introduced in 1923, for award with the medal to first recipients as well as, without a medal, to champions who had already been awarded the medal. The clasp is inscribed with the year of the award and is designed to be attached to the medal's suspension bar. The institution of the clasp was followed in 1926 with the provision that a rosette may be worn on the ribbon bar to indicate the award of each subsequent clasp.\nAward criteria\nAll medal contenders have to be serving members of the Regular Army, Army Emergency Reserve, Territorial Army, or Local Militia and Volunteer Forces in the countries concerned. Members of independent Naval and Air Forces, while not excluded from the competition, could therefore not be awarded the medal even though they won the championship. This regulation had consequences on two occasions.\n* The 1938 competition in Canada was won by Leading Aircraftman T.W. Gregory, who had won the medal in 1935 as a Sergeant in the Canadian Regular Army. In 1938, since he was a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force by then, he was ineligible to be awarded the clasp and the medal was awarded to the runner-up. An Air Force version of the medal, the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces, was instituted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. In 1955, Gregory won this new medal and became the only person to have won Queen's Medals in two different Arms of the Service.\n* The 1962 competition in Rhodesia was won by Corporal Technician B.T. Gilpin, a member of the Royal Rhodesian Air Force. Despite protests from the Army commanders, the Minister of Defence presented Gilpin with the Army medal. As a result of the controversy, Rhodesia sought and was granted the Crown's permission to introduce the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces. The first Rhodesian Air Force award was backdated to 1962 and the first two medals were presented in December 1963, one to Gilpin and the other to the Air Force champion for 1963. Gilpin's 1962 Army medal was returned and the 1962 Army runner-up, Inspector D. Hollingworth, was awarded a second clasp to his existing medal.\nThe institution of the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces was followed by the institution of the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the New Zealand Naval Forces in 1958 and the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines in 1966.\nOrder of wear\nIn the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Queen's/King's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces takes precedence after the King's Medal for Champion Shots of the New Zealand Naval Forces and before the King's Medal for Champion Shots of the Air Forces.\nParticipating countries\nIn the United Kingdom, the medal is at present awarded annually to the winner of the Regular Army championship - the Army Operational Shooting Competition.\nFrom 1935, a second medal could be awarded annually in the United Kingdom, to the champion shot of the Territorial Army. In order to also be eligible for the medal, members of the Supplementary Reserve were included in the competition's definition of the Territorial Army from 1936. The competition to determine the annual medal winner for the part-time forces is held during the National Rifle Association's annual Imperial Meeting at the National Shooting Centre, Bisley.\nOutside the United Kingdom, the number of British Commonwealth countries which awarded the medal grew to eleven by the mid-20th century. This number decreased over the ensuing years, however, since some countries became republics and stopped awarding the medal, while others replaced the medal with new domestic versions. The tables below list the recipients of the medal in the respective countries.\nAustralia\nThe first King's Medal Competition in the Commonwealth of Australia was held in 1924 and the first medal to an Australian was won by Temporary Quartermaster and Honorary Captain W.C.G. Ruddock of the Australian Instructional Corps. In 1988, the Champion Shots Medal was instituted in Australia and the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces ceased to be awarded.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|+Recipients\n!scope=\"row\"|Year\n!scope=\"row\"|Rank\n!scope=\"row\"|Initials\n!scope=\"row\"|Surname\n!scope=\"row\"|Unit or Formation\n|-\n|1924\n|T/QM (Hon Capt)\n|W.C.G.\n|Ruddock\n|Australian Instructional Corps\n|-\n|1925\n|WO2\n|A.\n|Taylor\n|Australian Instructional Corps\n|-\n|1926\n|WO1 (Hon Lt)\n|E.F.\n|Davies\n|Australian Instructional Corps, 3 MD\n|-\n|1927\n|WO1\n|J.D.\n|Shearim\n|Australian Instructional Corps, Small Arms School\n|-\n|1928\n|WO1 (Hon Lt)\n|J.\n|Hutchison\n|Australian Instructional Corps, 2 MD\n|-\n|1929\n|WO1\n|J.D.\n|Shearim (2)\n|Australian Instructional Corps, Small Arms School\n|-\n|1930\n|WO1\n|W.H.\n|Hackfath DCM\n|Australian Instructional Corps, 5 MD\n|-\n|1931\n|WO1\n|J.D.\n|Shearim (3)\n|Australian Instructional Corps, Small Arms School\n|-\n|1932\n|Lt\n|C.W.\n|Potter\n|3rd Light Horse Regiment 4 MD\n|-\n|1933\n|WO1\n|J.D.\n|Shearim (4)\n|Australian Instructional Corps, Small Arms School\n|-\n|1934\n|Bdr\n|J.C.\n|King\n|2 SRG 3 MD, 2nd Survey Co AGA\n|-\n|1935\n|Cpl\n|A.F.\n|Carson\n|32nd Infantry Battalion, 3MD\n|-\n|1936\n|Pte\n|E.W.\n|Potter\n|43/48 Infantry Battalion, 4 MD\n|-\n|1937\n|Pte\n|E.W.\n|Potter (2)\n|43/48 Infantry Battalion, 4 MD\n|-\n|1938\n|Pte\n|N.W.\n|Savage\n|Sydney University Regiment 2 MD\n|-\n|1939\n|Sgt\n|N.P.W.\n|Hall\n|37/39 Infantry Battalion 3 MD\n|-\n|1947\n|Lt\n|A.\n|Preston\n|EDN 1 MD, Northern Command AMF\n|-\n|1948\n|Capt\n|E.A.\n|Green\n|AEME 2 MD\n|-\n|1949\n|Capt\n|L.A.J.\n|Eagleson\n|RAAC Eastern Command, 1RNSWL\n|-\n|1950\n|WO2\n|R.D.\n|Archer\n|5 Inf Bn Southern Command\n|-\n|1951\n|Maj\n|G.C.\n|Magenis\n|RAAC AHQ\n|-\n|1952\n|Maj\n|G.C.\n|Magenis (2)\n|Army Branch Department of Supply, RAAC\n|-\n|1953\n|Sgt\n|G.L.\n|Loveband\n|16 NS TRG Bn Central Command, RAINF\n|-\n|1954\n|Sgt\n|P.F.\n|Jeffery\n|INT Corps HQ Western Command ARA\n|-\n|1955\n|Sgt\n|R.K.\n|Beardman\n|16 Petroleum Platoon RAASC (CMF) Western Command\n|-\n|1956\n|Maj\n|E.A.\n|Green (2)\n|HQ Eastern Command, RAEME\n|-\n|1957\n|WO2\n|R.D.\n|Archer (2)\n|RAINF Southern Comd Trg School\n|-\n|1958\n|WO1\n|J.A.\n|Guymer\n|CRE Central Command, RAINF\n|-\n|1959\n|WO1\n|R.D.\n|Archer (3)\n|RAINF HQ Southern Command\n|-\n|1960\n|L Cpl\n|G.A.\n|Dennis\n|RAE Central Command\n|-\n|1961\n|WO2\n|P.J.\n|Pini\n|Army Headquarters.\n|-\n|1962\n|WO2\n|G.L.\n|Loveband (2)\n|4 Cadet Battalion.

Goodhouse of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps. From 1963, two Queen's Medals for Champion Shots in the Military Forces were awarded annually in Canada, the second to a member of either the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or the Canadian Reserve Force. The first of these was won by Lance Sergeant T.A.P. Richardson of the Victoria Rifles of Canada. On 28 August 1991 the Queen's Medal for Champion Shot (), a distinct Canadian version of the medal, was instituted and from 1992 the British version of the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces ceased to be awarded.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|+Recipients\n!scope=\"row\"|Year\n!scope=\"row\"|Rank\n!scope=\"row\"|Initials\n!scope=\"row\"|Surname\n!scope=\"row\"|Regular Forces Unit or Formation\n|-\n|1923\n|WO1\n|F.J.\n|Goodhouse\n|CASC\n|-\n|1924\n|Cpl\n|W.J.\n|Livingstone\n|The Governor General's Foot Guards\n|-\n|1925\n|Lt\n|D.T.\n|Burke\n|The Governor General's Foot Guards\n|-\n|1926\n|Cpl\n|W.J.\n|Livingstone (2)\n|The Governor General's Foot Guards\n|-\n|1927\n|Lt\n|D.T.\n|Burke (2)\n|The Governor General's Foot Guards\n|-\n|1928\n|Maj\n|J.\n|Jeffrey OBE MC\n|RCR\n|-\n|1929\n|Lt\n|D.T.\n|Burke (3)\n|The Governor General's Foot Guards\n|-\n|1930\n|Lt\n|D.T.\n|Burke (4)\n|The Governor General's Foot Guards\n|-\n|1931\n|Lt\n|D.T.\n|Burke (5)\n|The Governor General's Foot Guards\n|-\n|1932\n|Capt\n|J.W.\n|Houlden\n|The Sherbrooke Regiment\n|-\n|1933\n|Lt\n|A.B.\n|Coulter OBE ED\n|The Governor General's Foot Guards\n|-\n|1934\n|Capt\n|J.W.\n|Houlden (2)\n|The Sherbrooke Regiment\n|-\n|1935\n|Sgt\n|T.W.\n|Gregory\n|7th BN CMG Corps\n|-\n|1936\n|L Cpl\n|C.\n|Robins\n|PPCLI\n|-\n|1937\n|Lt\n|G.A.\n|Molecey\n|Canadian Irish Fusiliers\n|-\n|1938\n|Pte\n|F.\n|Wallace\n|48th Highlanders of Canada\n|-\n|1939\n|Capt\n|D.T.\n|Burke (6)\n|The Governor General's Foot Guards\n|-\n|1947\n|Maj\n|D.T.\n|Burke (7)\n|RCAMC\n|-\n|1948\n|Lt\n|R.F.P.\n|Fendick\n|RCEME, RCOC\n|-\n|1949\n|CO\n|G.S.\n|Boa\n|Central Command Contingent (48 Highlanders of Canada)\n|-\n|1950\n|Lt\n|G.S.\n|Boa (2)\n|48 Highlanders of Canada\n|-\n|1951\n|Lt\n|G.S.\n|Boa (3)\n|48 Highlanders of Canada\n|-\n|1952\n|Lt\n|S.F.\n|Johnson OBE ED\n|14th Armoured Regiment (King's Own Calgary Regiment)\n|-\n|1953\n|Lt\n|A.H.\n|McKeage\n|Canadian Grenadier Guards\n|-\n|1954\n|Capt\n|D.C.\n|Lawford\n|1st Canadian Signals Regiment\n|-\n|1955\n|2 Lt\n|E.L.\n|Warner\n|The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment)\n|-\n|1956\n|Sgt\n|J.R.\n|Hardy\n|RCEME\n|-\n|1957\n|Lt\n|A.

It is a disk,  in diameter, with a raised rim on each side and suspended from a straight silver bar, swivelling on some versions. On the Queen Victoria version, the suspender is affixed to the medal by means of a double-toe claw and a pin through the upper edge of the medal. On the Kings' versions and the first Queen Elizabeth II version, the attachment is by a single-toe claw. On the second Queen Elizabeth II version, the suspension is either riveted or welded to the top of the medal.\n;Obverse\nThe obverse bears the effigy of the reigning monarch. Seven versions of the medal have been awarded.\n* The original Queen Victoria version of 1869 has her diademed and veiled effigy, facing left, and is circumscribed \"VICTORIA REGINA\".

This version has the same effigy as the first, but is circumscribed \"ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA F. D.\", reading around from the top.\n;Reverse\nThe reverse shows the winged mythological goddess Pheme, with a trumpet in her left hand and rising from her throne to crown a warrior with a laurel wreath. At left is the naked and cloaked warrior, with his left foot on the throne dais, a bow and a quiver of arrows in his right hand and supporting a target with three arrows through its centre on his left knee. The design was by Sir Edward John Poynter, 1st Baronet PRA, and the original die was engraved by L.C. Wyon.\n;Clasp\nThe medal can be won multiple times. Each subsequent award is indicated by the award of another clasp, which displays the year of the subsequent award. The clasps are designed to be attached to the suspender and to each other with rivets, in roller chain fashion. When medals are not worn, the award of second and subsequent clasps are denoted by silver rosettes on the ribbon bar. Since it is impossible to sew more than four rosettes onto a single ribbon bar and since several champions have won the award more than five times, gold rosettes were introduced to cover situations where more than five championships have been won.\n;Ribbon\nThe ribbon is 32 millimetres wide and dark crimson, with a 3 millimetres wide black band, a 3 millimetres wide beige band and a 3 millimetres wide black band on each edge.\nReferences"
