Also on the property are a contributing brick, two-story servants' house fronted by a two-level gallery and a brick structure which incorporates the original kitchen and stable outbuildings.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111031145746/http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/richmond/PaceKing.htm National Park Service: Pace窶適ing House]"
