However, Ranjith never harms Raju out of respect for Raju's father, Kotha Ravi, who was also a gangster in the past.\nRaju meets Tara and falls in love with her. Kannan tries to get Raju and his gang to deal with narcotics, but Raju disagrees because Tara's brother committed suicide due to a drug overdose.

Blinded by his greed for wealth and power, Kannan decides to partner with Ranjith and agrees to transport cannabis into Kotha.

In October 2022, Salmaan stated in an interview that, \"It is an action gangster genre, noir film set in a fictional town. It's interesting because I generally tend to veer away from this type of cinema quite a bit. But I found a bit of a balance. I feel like it has content, it has great writing, but it's also a very commercial gangster drama.\" On 23 June 2023 the film's motion poster, titled \"People of Kotha\" was launched.\nFilming and casting\nThe principal photography began on 27 September 2022 at Karaikudi, while additional filming occurred in Rameswaram and Ramanathapuram.

However the background scores, cinematography and technical aspects were praised.\nCritical response\nSanjith Sidhardhan of OTTplay gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"King of Kotha might have a familiar storyline that feels stretched out in parts, but Dulquer's performance along with the grand visuals make this gangster revenge saga worth watching in theatres.\" Anandu Suresh of The Indian Express gave 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Though the Dulquer Salmaan-starrer possessed the potential to be celebrated alongside iconic gangster movies like Satya, Vada Chennai, and Gangs of Wasseypur, its failure to feature a compelling narrative prevents it from reaching the lofty heights it aspired to achieve.\"\nRonak Kotecha of The Times of India gave 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"King of Kotha suffers from the same old problem of not knowing how much is too much. Short of becoming a cult gangster classic, it does have the mass appeal and the ability to hold its audience captive for a long time. It just doesn't know when to stop.\" Janani K. of India Today gave 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"King of Kotha is a gangster drama that has many interesting ideas, but they are underused. Despite the pacing issues, the film holds your attention.\"\nGautaman Bhaskaran of News18 gave 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"King of Kotha has a nice plot, but an over-ambitious scripting pushes it in a multitude of paths with the cream of it all turning sour. The narrative is uneven, and direction not quite up to the mark.\" Priyanka Sundar of Firstpost gave 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"If King Of Kotha had as much of an emotional depth as Dulquer Salmaan's one dialogue that explains his love for Aishwarya Lekshmi's Thara — we would have probably had a winner.\" Nirmal Jovial of The Week gave 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"King of Kotha clocks in at nearly three hours in duration. A more judicious and precise editing process could have resulted in a more tolerable viewing experience. Stylised action sequences cannot compensate for the weak script.\"\nPrincy Alexander of Onmanorama wrote, \"Though the film gets a little predictable towards the end, the filmmakers have tried to steer clear from sticking to the old formula of mass action films. The songs, the visuals, and the style of making have helped elevate the film, so it appeals to a pan-Indian audience.\" S. R. Praveen of The Hindu wrote, \"King of Kotha, in the end, is an unabashed vehicle for Dulquer's superstardom aspirations, but it does not pack enough of a punch to become the crowning glory that it was intended to be.\" Vishal Menon of Film Companion wrote, \"With the freshness limited to the visuals and the music department, the moments of high King Of Kotha achieve quickly deflate just when you feel the film has done its job. Sadly, there's only so much you can do with daggers and swagger when the runtime is close to three hours.\"\nBox office\nKing of Kotha had a strong opening at worldwide box office grossing over  worldwide and  ( from Kerala and  from ROI circuit) which was the second highest opening for a Malayalam film at the Indian box office after Odiyan (2018).\nKing of Kotha grossed  in New Zealand,  in the United Kingdom,  in the United Arab Emirates and  in Australia, totaling  in international earnings The film was a box office bomb.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
