The national museums of the UK are funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) of the British government, and are all located in England. There are 14 national museums, all established by Acts of Parliament, as well as another eight which are sponsored by the DCMS.\nIn addition, there are national museums in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which are supported by the devolved legislatures. National museums in Scotland are funded by the Scottish Executive Education Department, in Wales by the Welsh Government, and in Northern Ireland by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure of the Northern Ireland Executive.\nFree entrance is standard practice in all UK national museums, although some exhibits do require an admission fee to view. Several of the museums have more than one location throughout the UK.\nNational museums in England\nNational museums established by Act of Parliament\n* British Museum, London\n* Imperial War Museums, London, Cambridge and Manchester\n** Imperial War Museum London\n** Imperial War Museum Duxford\n** HMS Belfast 1938, London\n** Churchill War Rooms, London\n** Imperial War Museum North, Trafford\n* National Gallery, London\n* National Maritime Museum, London\n* National Museum of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth, Gosport, Yeovilton, Belfast, and Hartlepool\n** National Museum of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth\n** Fleet Air Arm Museum, Yeovilton\n** HMS Caroline, Belfast\n** National Museum of the Royal Navy, Hartlepool\n** Explosion Museum of Naval Firepower, Gosport\n** Royal Navy Submarine Museum, Gosport\n* National Museums Liverpool\n** World Museum, Liverpool\n** Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool\n** Merseyside Maritime Museum, Liverpool\n** Seized!
