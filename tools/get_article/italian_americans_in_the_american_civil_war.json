A contingent of soldiers from the former Kingdom of the Two Sicilies fought on the Confederate side, with most of these having been former prisoners of war who had fought against Giuseppe Garibaldi during his invasion of the Two Sicilies. Between 5,000 and 10,000 Italian Americans fought in the civil war.\nIn the Union army\nShortly after the onset of war, several hundred officers and soldiers in the Italian army went to the American legation at Turin and volunteered to fight in the Union army. Because of financial constraints, the U.S. army accepted only some of these volunteers.\"\nMost of the Italian-Americans who joined the Union Army were recruited from New York City. Many Italians of note were interested in the war and joined the army, reaching positions of authority. Brigadier General Edward Ferrero was the original commander of the 51st New York Regiment. He commanded both brigades and divisions in the eastern and western theaters of war and later commanded a division of the United States Colored Troops. Colonel Enrico Fardella, of the same and later of the 85th New York regiment, was made a brevet brigadier general when the war ended.\ncommanded a Union cavalry unit during the war.]]\nFrancis B. Spinola recruited four regiments in New York, was soon appointed Brigadier General by President Abraham Lincoln and given command of the Spinola Brigade. Later he commanded another unit, the famed Excelsior Brigade.\nColonel Luigi Palma di Cesnola, a former Italian and British soldier and veteran of the Crimean War, commanded the 4th New York Cavalry and would rise to become one of the highest ranking Italian officer in the federal army. He established a military school in New York City where many young Italians were trained and later served in the Union army. Di Cesnola received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Aldie.\nTwo more famous examples were Francesco Casale and Luigi Tinelli, who were instrumental in the formation of the 39th New York Infantry Regiment. According to one evaluation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, there were over 200 Italians who served as officers in the U.S. army.\nAt least 260 Italian Americans fought as sailors in the Union Navy.\nGiuseppe Garibaldi\nGiuseppe Garibaldi, celebrated as one of the greatest generals of modern times and as the \"Hero of the Two Worlds\" because of his military enterprises in South America and Europe, who fought in many military campaigns that led to [[Italian unification]]\nAt the outbreak of the American Civil War, Giuseppe Garibaldi was a very popular figure. The 39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, of whose 350 members were Italian, was nicknamed Garibaldi Guard in his honor. The unit wore red shirts and bersaglieri plumes. They carried with them both a Union Flag as well as an Italian flag with the words Dio e popolo, meaning \"God and people.\" In 1861 Garibaldi himself volunteered his services to President Abraham Lincoln. Garibaldi was offered a Major General's commission in the U.S. Army through the letter from Secretary of State William H. Seward to H. S. Sanford, the U.S. Minister at Brussels, July 17, 1861. On September 18, 1861, Sanford sent the following reply to Seward:\nAccording to Italian historian Petacco, \"Garibaldi was ready to accept Lincoln's 1862 offer but on one condition: that the war's objective be declared as the abolition of slavery. But at that stage Lincoln was unwilling to make such a statement lest he worsen an agricultural crisis.\" Although the aging Garibaldi respectfully declined Lincoln's offer, Washington D.C. recruited many of Garibaldi's former officers. On August 6, 1863, after the Emancipation Proclamation had been issued, Garibaldi wrote to Lincoln: \"Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure.\"\nIn the Confederate army\nwas Confederate general in the American Civil War.]]\nAbout a thousand Italians, emigrants or descendants of emigrants, or with Italian names, enlisted in the armed forces of the Confederacy.\nThe military units of the South with the largest number of Italians came from Louisiana, the Confederate state with the largest presence of Italian immigrants. New Orleans, which was then the most populous city in the Confederate States, had a very high percentage of foreigners, and when the secession began, practically every ethnic group formed its own units.\nThe Italians already present in Louisiana attempted to form a battalion, called the \"Garibaldi Legion\" or, alternatively, \"Garibaldi Guards\": about 170 Italians volunteered.\nOn February 21, 1861, the \"first company of the Garibaldi Guards\" or simply \"Garibaldi Guards\" was prepared and fully equipped. On March 19, 1861, the “Garibaldi Guards” paraded through the streets of New Orleans, in uniforms that recalled the Garibaldi volunteers of Italy, red jacket and tricolor cockade.\nThe officers, all Italian, were: Captain Gaudenzio Marzoni (or Manzoni, both surnames predominantly Lombard), later made major and replaced by the aforementioned Captain Giuseppe (or Joseph), Santini (originally from Corsica), Second Lieutenant Ulisse Marinoni (from Brescia, political exile after the riots of 1848, in America since 1850) and Second Lieutenant Ernesto Baselli (surname predominantly Lombard).\nNot having reached the number of men necessary to form an autonomous unit, the \"first Garibaldi Guards company\" was incorporated into the regiment of the \"Cazadores Españoles-Spanish Hunters\", of which it became Company F; Finally, after New Orleans fell to the Union, the Garibaldi Guards disbanded in early May 1862. Many other Italian names are found in the lists of other Confederate units. These were immigrants who had already resided in the Southern States. About a thousand Italians, emigrants or descendants of emigrants, or with Italian names, enlisted in the armed forces of the Confederacy.\nThe military units of the South with the largest number of Italians came from Louisiana, the Confederate state with the largest presence of Italian immigrants. New Orleans, which was then the most populous city in the Confederate States, had a very high percentage of foreigners, and when the secession began, practically every ethnic group formed its own units.\nThe Italians already present in Louisiana attempted to form a battalion, called the \"Garibaldi Legion\" or, alternatively, \"Garibaldi Guards\": about 170 Italians volunteered.\nThere also were Italian companies within regiments from Louisiana, Virginia, Tennessee and Alabama; as well as parts of a company from South Carolina.\nAmong the Confederate officer corps, General William B. Taliaferro had some Italian ancestry as a son of the Taliaferro first family of Virginia, descended from Italians in England in the 1500s who settled the Colony of Virginia in the 1600s. General P. G. T. Beauregard, a Louisiana Creole, had Italian ancestry via his mother Hélène Judith de Reggio, who hailed from a prominent first family of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana established in 1747 by her grandfather Francesco Maria de Reggio, an Italian nobleman of the House of Este.\nSee also\n*African Americans in the American Civil War\n*German Americans in the American Civil War\n*Hispanics in the American Civil War\n*Irish Americans in the American Civil War\n*Native Americans in the American Civil War\n**Cherokee\n**Choctaw\n*Foreign enlistment in the American Civil War\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=SdrYv7S60fgC&dq=italian+americans+The+Civil+War+Archive&pg=PA1050 \"Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: a political, social, and military history\" - Italian-Americans] by David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T.
