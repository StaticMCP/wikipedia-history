The battle occurred when the Spanish fleet of the Adelantado of Castile, Don Martín de Padilla y Manrique, Count of Santa Gadea (in their return from the Republic of Venice to Spain with a valuable goods), sighted an Anglo-Dutch fleet in the waters of Almería, on the southern coast of Spain. The Spanish fleet, led by Martín de Padilla, attacked with such fury the Anglo-Dutch fleet who managed to undo their training, achieved a great success. About 20 Dutch ships and 3 English ships were captured by the Spaniards, and some ships of the rest of the Anglo-Dutch fleet were seriously damaged. On the other hand, the Spanish losses were minimal.\nAfter the battle, the Spanish fleet victorious, entered the port of Almeria with the captured ships.\nSee also\n* Cape Palos\n* Siege of Deventer (1591)\n* Battle of Flores (1591)\n* Siege of Rouen (1591)\n* Battle of the Bay of Biscay (1592)\n* Battle of the Gulf of Cadiz\nNotes\nReferences\n* Fernández Duro, Cesáreo (1898).
