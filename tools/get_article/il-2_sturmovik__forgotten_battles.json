Unlike the first installment, Forgotten Battles focuses on the Soviet-Finnish Continuation War of 1941-1944.\nCareer Mode\nThe Career mode allows the player to become a pilot of the Luftwaffe, Soviet Air Force, Finnish Air Force, or the Hungarian Air Force. Each campaign consists of approximately 30 missions, and a career includes 4-8 campaigns or 100 to 250 missions. As a new feature in the IL-2 Sturmovik series of flight simulation games, IL-2 Sturmovik: Forgotten Battles introduced the dynamic campaign mode which had been static until then.\nAircraft\nThe game features 129 flyable aircraft, all of which are available as AI controlled elements in missions. 80 of these planes can be flown by the player. 30 of the flyable planes and 21 of the AI planes were new in the series. The flyable aircraft have a full 3D cockpit with working instruments. Planes with crew allow switching to most positions.\nExpansions\nAce Expansion Pack\nReleased on 2 March 2004, 1C: Maddox Games and Ubisoft released the official expansion pack entitled IL-2 Sturmovik: Forgotten Battles - Ace Expansion Pack. It offers players a more in depth simulation experience by allowing them to take control of 11 new aircraft, and fight against or beside 10 non-flyable aircraft. It also includes 2 new maps, one depicting the Finnish Front, and a Hungarian map which includes the Balaton Lake area. Both a Finnish and Hungarian campaign which uses these maps are also playable and allows the player to progress in rank and earn awards.\nGold Pack\nIL-2 Sturmovik: Forgotten Battles - Gold Pack was simultaneously released with the Ace Expansion Pack. The Gold Pack consisted in a software reuniting all the content shared between Forgotten Battles and the Ace Expansion Pack. This allowed customers possessing no game in the series to purchase the latest version of IL-2 Sturmovik reunited in only one standalone game.\nReception\nForgotten Battles\n| MC = 86/100\n| GSpot = 8.6/10\n| GSpy =\n| IGN = 8.5/10\n| PCGUK = 90%\n| PCGUS = 92%\n| PCZone = 92%\n| XPlay =\n}}\nForgotten Battles was met with positive reception; GameRankings gave it a score of 87.39%, while Metacritic gave it 86 out of 100.\nForgotten Battles won PC Gamer USs 2003 \"Best Simulation\" award.
