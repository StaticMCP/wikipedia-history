She attended schools in Chicago, and graduated from the Boston School of Oratory in 1888. She studied at the School of Dramatic Art with David Belasco.\nCareer\nHoward translated many works by Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf into English, including Christ Legends (1908), The Girl from the Marsh Croft (1910), Further Adventures of Nils (1911), The Legend of the Sacred Image (1914), The Emperor of Portugallia (1916), Jerusalem: A Novel (1916), The Holy City: Jerusalem II (1918),  ''Gösta Berling's Saga (1918), Mȧrbacka (1925), and Charlotte Löwensköld'' (1927). \"Even today, when you come across Lagerlöf in English, it is likely that it will be an abridged or edited version based on Howard's work.\"\nShe also translated works by dramatist August Strindberg, including Lucky Pehr: A Drama in Five Acts and Easter: A Play in Three Acts. She contributed to a Swedish-language newspaper published in the United States, and wrote one short book of her own in Swedish, När Maja-Lisa kom hen från Amerika, encouraging Swedish immigrants in America to consider returning to Sweden.\nHoward was also a lecturer, suffragist, pacifist, and Christian Scientist. She was in the cast of a skit presented by the Professional Woman's League of New York in 1900, and played Mary Baker Eddy in a New York City suffrage pageant in 1911.\nPersonal life\nSwanston married Charles Howard. Her husband died in 1917, and she died in 1937, at the age of 69, in New York City, about a month after she suffered a stroke.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
