The film stars Will Ferrell and Robert Duvall as a father and son who exploit their own sons' soccer teams to try to beat the other. Mike Ditka, Kate Walsh, and Josh Hutcherson also star. It was released on May 13, 2005, to mixed reviews and grossed $56 million worldwide.\nPlot\nPhil Weston is an average person who had endured his father Buck Weston's over-competitiveness throughout his childhood, an upbringing which has left permanent mental scars. Now middle-aged and married, with a young son named Sam, Phil runs a small vitamin store, while Buck operates a local chain of sports stores.\nBuck is the coach of the Gladiators, the most successful little-league soccer team in the district. Sam is on Buck's team, but Buck keeps him on the bench, a humiliation he also visited upon his son decades prior. Buck eventually transfers Sam to the Tigers, the league's worst team.\nAt Sam's first game with his new team, their coach is absent. Rather than forfeit, Phil offers to coach the team, a position he takes up permanently. However, despite Phil's best efforts, the team does not seem to improve. In desperation, Phil recruits Mike Ditka, Buck's neighbor and hated enemy. Enticed by the opportunity to beat Buck, Ditka accepts the position. Despite grueling training, the team continues to lose.\nDitka introduces Phil to two exceptionally talented Italian boys working in a local butcher's shop. Phil succeeds in gaining their uncle's permission for them to play for the Tigers. They have an immediate impact, scoring repeatedly. The resulting winning streak makes them serious contenders in the league.\nAfter Phil boasts about the Tigers potentially reaching the finals, he and Buck make a bet: if the Gladiators win then Phil would sell his store and work for Buck. If the Tigers win then Buck would hand over his most prized possession, 'The Pelé Ball', a soccer ball struck by the famous player which Phil caught as a child and Buck took from him.\nMeanwhile, Ditka also introduces Phil to coffee, which rapidly changes him from a mild-mannered caring dad to an obnoxious, egotistical, over-competitive coach, not unlike his father, abusing kids and parents alike. The team's mantra becomes \"Get the ball to the Italians\", which, though effective, demoralizes the team. In the ultimate over-competitive act, he benches his son for the entire semi-final game.\nThe Tigers make it to the finals, where they face off against the Gladiators. At half-time, the score is 2–1 to the Gladiators. In a heart-to-heart discussion with his son, Phil realizes the error of his ways. He tells his team to do exactly the opposite of what he taught them.\nAlthough the Gladiators score one more goal after half-time, the Tigers do not give up hope. Phil gives the goalie a vision test with glasses from the crowd. From there, Ambrose scores one goal—making the score 3–2. After another goal, the score is tied. The team rallies and produces a spectacular team performance to win 4–3, with Sam scoring the winning goal against his uncle Bucky, (Buck's child from his second wife and Phil's younger half-brother, who was born on the exact day as Sam) using a move that he practiced when his dad benched him in the semi-finals.\nHonoring the bet, Buck tries to give Phil the ball, but Phil refuses. Making peace with his father, they merge their businesses, realizing there is more to life than winning.\nThe film ends with an adapted version of the \"He's Got Balls\" commercial originally produced by Buck. In it, the entire Tigers and Gladiators team appear, announcing the merger of Phil's vitamin shop—Phil's Pills—and Buck's Sporting Goods Store. The team shouts, after the \"He's got balls\" line, \"And vitamins.\"\nCast\nProduction\nIn April 2003, it was reported Universal Pictures had bought a soccer themed pitch from writers Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick starring Will Ferrell citing the success of Old School as a reason for the swift acquisition. Marco Schnabel, who had previously worked as a second unit director for Jay Roach on the Austin Powers films and Meet the Parents, was initially hired to make his directorial debut with the film but was ultimately replaced with Jesse Dylan and Schnabel instead making his directing debut with 2008's The Love Guru. In October 2003, Robert Duvall joined the cast to star alongside Ferrell.\nReception\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 41% based on 139 reviews, and an average rating of 5.5/10. The web site's critical consensus reads, \"The script is mediocre and fails to give Ferrell a proper comedic showcase.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRoger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying that it was \"an entertaining family movie\". Scott Foundas of Variety called it \"An immensely likable, funny comedy that finds a novel approach to that familiar combo of kids and sports.\"\nDavid Palmer gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying that Ferrell and the film were much funnier than \"a PG-rated kids film has any right being\".\nBox office\nThe film grossed $20.2 million in its opening weekend, finishing in 2nd place behind fellow newcomer Monster-in-Law ($23.1 million).\nKicking and Screaming earned $52.8 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $3.2 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $56.1 million, against a production budget of $45 million. Kicking and Screaming became the highest grossing soccer movie, beating Bend It Like Beckham which grossed $32.5 million.\nAwards and nominations\nGolden Raspberry Awards\n* Will Ferrell nominated for Worst Actor (also for Bewitched)\nTeen Choice Awards\n* Choice Movie, Actor: Ferrell nominated for Comedy (also for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy)\n* Choice Movie, Hissy Fit: Ferrell\n* 2005: Choice Movie Sleazebag: Ferrell\nSee also\n* List of association football films\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
