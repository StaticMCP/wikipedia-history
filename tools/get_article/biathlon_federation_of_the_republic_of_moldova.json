This made it possible to achieve high results in 2022 when Alina Stremous won gold (in the pursuit) and silver (in the individual race) medals at the 2022 IBU Open European Championships in Großer Arbersee (Germany).\nAt the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing the Moldovan team was represented by four athletes. The highest achievement at the Olympics was Alina Stremous' 10th place in the 7.5&nbsp;km sprint.\nLeadership\n*Dimitri Torner, President (from 2020)\n*Petru Bria, Secretary General (1993-2014, 2017–present)\nList of presidents\n*Valentin Ciumac (1993–2014).\n*Petru Bria (2014–2017).\n*Ion Florian (2017–2020)\n*Dimitri Torner (2020–present)\nReferences"
