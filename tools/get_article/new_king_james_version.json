Published by Thomas Nelson, the complete NKJV was released in 1982. With regard to its textual basis, the NKJV relies on a modern critical edition (the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia) for the Old Testament, while opting to use the Textus Receptus for the New Testament.\nThe NKJV is described by Thomas Nelson as being \"scrupulously faithful to the original [King James Version], yet truly updated to enhance its clarity and readability.\"\nHistory\nThe text of the New Testament was published in 1979; the Psalms in 1980; and the full Bible in 1982. The project took seven years in total to complete. A minor revision was completed in 1984.\nTranslation philosophy\nThe Executive Editor of the NKJV, Arthur L. Farstad, addressed textual concerns in a book explaining the NKJV translation philosophy. He defended the Majority Text (also called the Byzantine text-type) and claimed that the Textus Receptus is inferior to the Majority Text, but he noted (p.&nbsp;114) that the NKJV references significant discrepancies among text types in its marginal notes: \"None of the three [textual] traditions on every page of the New Testament [...] is labeled 'best' or 'most reliable.' The reader is permitted to make up his or her own mind about the correct reading.\"\nCirculation\nThe NKJV translation has become one of the best-selling Bibles in the US. In 2024, it was listed as the fifth best-selling Bible by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association.\nAn unabridged audiobook version called \"The Word of Promise Audio Bible\" has been produced by the publisher. It is narrated by celebrities and fully dramatized with music and sound effects.\nGideons International, an organization that places Bibles in hotels and hospitals, at one stage used the NKJV translation along with the KJV, offering the KJV as the default translation and offering the NKJV when an organization asked for a Bible in newer English to be used. After HarperCollins' acquisition of Thomas Nelson, however, the Gideons have chosen to start using the English Standard Version (ESV) instead of the NKJV.\nSee also\n* Modern English Bible translations\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.thomasnelsonbibles.com/nkjv-bible/ Official webpage]"
