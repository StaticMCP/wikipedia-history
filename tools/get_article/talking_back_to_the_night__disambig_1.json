Released less than two years after the top 3 hit Arc of a Diver, it failed to see as much success as its predecessor, reaching #28 on the Billboard 200. \"Valerie\" was a minor hit in 1982, but when it and the title track were remixed and re-released in 1987 for Chronicles, the newer version of \"Valerie\" became a top 10 hit, while the remix of \"Talking Back to the Night\" hit the Billboard Hot 100, but failed to crack the Top 40. The track \"Help Me Angel\" was also remixed for Chronicles, and was then released for the first time as a single.\nWinwood played all of the instruments on the album.\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = ''Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s\n|rev2Score = C\n| rev3      = Rolling Stone\n| rev3Score =\n}}\nReviewing for Rolling Stone'' in 1982, Parke Puterbaugh said the album is \"for the most part a bland, easy-listening electropop rut\". Mark Cooper was critical of the album, saying that the music \"lacks the eccentricity or excitement that characterised Traffic's best work\", adding that the \"ludicrous\" synths \"emphasise the blandness of Winwood's current style\".\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Steve Winwood – lead and backing vocals, Prophet-5, Multimoog (also used for fretless bass), Hammond B3 organ, Linn LM-1 programming\n* Nicole Winwood – backing vocals (tracks 2 and 5)\nProduction\n* Steve Winwood – producer, engineer, mixing\n* John \"Nobby\" Clarke – assistant engineer\n* Lynn Goldsmith – photography\n* Tony Wright – artwork\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
