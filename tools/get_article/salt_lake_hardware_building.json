United States, that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nDescription\nIn 1996, with the help of FFKR Architects, the warehouse was converted to office space for Albertsons operations, but currently it is used for commercial office space. The design was special in that it allowed the building to maintain the historic aspects. In 2001, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At that time there was a water tower on the roof; the tower has since been renovated and renewed. The building was built in 1909, just north of a depot of the Oregon Short Line Railroad.\nIn 2018 the first phase of a new, adjacent apartment complex was completed and named the Hardware Apartments.\nSee also\n}}\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Salt Lake City\nReferences\nExternal links\n}}\n* [http://www.utahlocations.com/salt-lake-hardware-building/?rq=Salt%20lake%20hardware%20building Utah Locations: Salt Lake Hardware Building]\n* http://www.ffkr.com/gallery/salt-lake-hardware-building/"
