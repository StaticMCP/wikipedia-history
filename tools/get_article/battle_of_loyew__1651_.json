Near the site of the present-day town of Loyew on the Sozh River in Belarus, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth’s forces under the command of Prince Janusz Radziwiłł and Mirski attacked and defeated a forces of the Zaporozhian Cossacks under the command of Colonels Martyn Nebaba, Stepan Pobodailo and Prokip Shumeyko with Lytvynenko.\nJust a few weeks after the Battle of Berestechko, Bohdan Khmelnytsky managed to gather the scattered Cossacks and, supported by the Tatars , once again posed a serious threat. Meanwhile, on the Polish side, the levy, like King John Casimir, refused to continue fighting and returned home. Mercenary units moved into the depths of Ukraine. On September 3, the Crown Hetmans ( Potocki and Kalinowski ) occupied Lubar. Janusz Radziwiłł headed the Lithuanian troops (11 Lithuanian cavalry banners, including 2 Tatar banners of Sienkiewicz and Murza, a total of 4,000 soldiers) to meet the Crown troops, defeating on July 6 the Cossack covering units of Colonel Martyn Nebaba (15,000 mainly infantry) marching towards Gomel near Łojów on the Dnieper. The victorious Lithuanian Field Hetman, after liberating a three-thousand-strong Cossack cavalry unit besieged in Krzyczew, captured Kiev on August 4.\nReferences\nSources\n*Marcin Domagała: Biała Cerkiew 23-25 IX 1651.
