His wife Clementia of Burgundy was regent of Flanders in his absence. The known members of the army, mostly Flemish, included the ones listed below, as reported in histories of the First Crusade.  Unless otherwise noted, references are to the on-line database of Riley-Smith, et al., and the hyperlinks therein provide details including original sources. The names below are also referenced in the Riley-Smith tome, Appendix I: Preliminary List of Crusaders.  Those references are not shown unless they appear elsewhere in the text of the book.  Articles that are hyperlinked to a more detailed article in this encyclopædia rely on the latter for references.\nHousehold of Robert\nAmong those from Robert’s household included the following:\n* Engelbert of Cysoing and Lord of Petegem, Standard-bearer for Robert, and his nephews Arnold II of Ardres and Baldwin of Ghent\n* Eustace, butler of Robert\n* Gontier of Aire, squire of Robert\n* Onulf, seneschal of Robert\n* Winrich of Flanders, who originally travelled with Robert as his butler but became the butler of Godfrey of Bouillon in 1100.
