Many claim that World War III can happen without nuclear weapons, in the form of local wars. World War III is a local conflict between Russia with Iran and NATO with its allies...\nStatements in Russia\nOn June 25 2025, the Head of the Russian and Chechen special forces \"Akhmat\" Apti Alaudinov said that the Third World War is already underway and the fact that nuclear weapons have not been launched is not the reason that the war has not begun. His statements appeared a day after the end of the Iran-Israel war. Other experts and news channels also spoke about this. But there is a local conflict and all the countries that should be involved in it, even partially. Because on April 24, the conflict between India and Pakistan began, on May 28, the conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, on June 13, the Iran-Israel war. And even before these events, the Russo-Ukrainian war, the war in Gaza, the Civil war in Sudan began, and in Syria, the Civil war has been going on since 2011. Philosopher Alexander Dugin shares this opinion.\nChronology of Events\nThere are suggestions that Israel was planning to seize the Levant region with the help of the US during the war with Iran. Britain could also stage a provocation in the Baltic Sea. On July 26, a Russian ship crossed the maritime border of Estonia. On July 27, Russia held the \"July Rain\" exercises in the Baltic Sea. On July 17, NATO General Christopher Donahue said that NATO might strike Kaliningrad, and this may have increased the chance of at least some kind of attack on NATO. On July 28, 2025, Russian MP Andrei Gurulev confirmed that World War III is already underway, and Russia is ready and will prepare for such an outcome. Trump began to threaten Russia with sanctions on oil, which should kill the Russian economy. On July 28, a Russian drone crossed the border between Belarus and Lithuania, prompting NATO to scramble fighter jets. On July 28, Thailand and Cambodia signed a Peace Treaty and can no longer be considered warring countries. On August 2, Trump and Medvedev began to clash when Medvedev responded to Trump's threats by saying that Russia was not equal to Iran or other countries and would be responded to accordingly. Trump decided to send nuclear submarines to scare Russia or avoid the threat. On August 6, a Russian kamikaze drone crashed in Lithuania, and NATO took no action. On August 15, Putin arrived for a meeting with Trump in Alaska, discussing issues related to Ukraine. On August 27, Britain and the United States tried to find a Russian submarine that may not have existed. On September 2, 2025, the US attacked a Venezuelan ship believed to be carrying drugs, and the Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro claimed it was an AI-generated video. On September 8, mass protests began in Nepal, dubbed the \"Gen Z Revolution\" due to the blocking of many messengers and websites; after the protests, many government buildings were burned down and many politicians resigned. On September 9, Nicolas Maduro said that World War III had already begun, which confirms the conflict. On September 9, Israel struck Hamas leaders in Qatar. On September 10, a record number of Russian drones (10-20) flew into Poland, which was immediately called an invasion and aggression. On September 11, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting. On September 12, at Poland's request to activate Article 4 against Russia, NATO accepted the request and launched «Operation Eastern Sentry». Meanwhile, through September 16, Russia, Belarus, and a pair of Indian military forces conducted the «Zapad 2025» exercises. On September 19, three Russian aircraft flew into Estonia for 12 minutes, which prompted Estonia to apply for the activation of NATO Article 4, but the NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte personally refused and said that he would not activate the article on a case-by-case basis. Trump announced future nuclear tests, the first in 30 years, and announced the start of preparations for them. Donald Trump also stated that the United States has the most nuclear warheads, far more than Russia and China. On November 5, the United States launched tests of the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, prompting Russian Defense Minister Andreу Belousov to announce that Russia would begin its own nuclear tests in response to the US actions. On November 9, 2025, former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that World War III would not start because of Ukraine. Russia called on the United States to take advantage of the upcoming regular session of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to clarify its position on nuclear testing, said Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's Permanent Representative to the International Organizations in Vienna.\nReferences"
