      "text": "# Long eighteenth century__disambig_1\n\nThe long 18th century is a phrase used by many British historians to cover a more natural historical period than the simple use of the standard calendar definition of the eighteenth century (1 January 1701 to 31 December 1800). They expand the century to include larger British and Western European historical movements, with their subsequent \"long\" 18th century typically running from the Glorious Revolution and the beginning of the Nine Years' War in 1688 to the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Other definitions, perhaps those with a more social or global interest, extend the period further to, for example, from the Stuart Restoration in 1660 to the end of the Georgian era. Possibly the earliest proponent of the long eighteenth century was Sir John Robert Seeley, who in 1883 defined the eighteenth century as \"the period which begins with the Revolution of 1688 and ends with the peace of 1815\".\nThe Institute of Historical Research hosts a seminar series on \"British History in the Long 18th Century\".\nSee also\n* Long 19th century\n* Second Hundred Years' War\n* Short 20th century\nReferences"
