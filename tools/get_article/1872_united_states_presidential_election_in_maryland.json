All contemporary 37 states were part of the 1872 United States presidential election. The state voters chose eight electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nMaryland was won by the Liberal Republican and Democratic nominees, former Congressman Horace Greeley of New York and his running mate former Senator and Governor Benjamin Gratz Brown of Missouri. Greely and Brown defeated the Republican nominees, incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant of Illinois and his running mate Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts.\nGreeley won the state by a narrow margin of 0.68%. However, he died prior to the Electoral College meeting, allowing for Maryland's eight electors to vote for the candidate of their choice.\nIn this election, Maryland voted 12.49% more Democratic than the nation at-large.\nResults\n}}\n|evprct     = 0.00%\n}}\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Horace Greeley\nLiberal Republican\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Ulysses S.
