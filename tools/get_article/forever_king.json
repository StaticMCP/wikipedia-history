      "text": "# Forever King\n\nForever King is a twelve-track mixtape by 50 Cent with 90s R&B samples provided by DJ Whoo Kid. The collection is dedicated to the death of Michael Jackson.\nBackground\nThe collection was initially called Sincerely Southside Part 2, but the death of Michael Jackson stimulated a last minute renaming. Comparing to his last release, War Angel LP, 50 Cent stated:\nThe cover art for Forever King features 50 Cent's face and his New York Yankees cap digitally imposed on a skull encrusted with diamonds. Another version is more ordinary, featuring a jeweled skull with tilted crown.\nTrack listing\nReferences"
