In the , Surbiton had a population of 80 people.\nOn 22 November 2019, the Queensland Government decided to amalgamate the localities in the Barcaldine Region, resulting in five expanded localities based on the larger towns: Alpha, Aramac, Barcaldine, Jericho and Muttaburra. Surbiton was incorporated into Alpha.\nGeography\nThe Belyando River forms the north-western boundary of the locality. Native Companion Creek flows from the south-west (Alpha/Beaufort) through to the north of the locality where it becomes a tributary of the Belyando River.\nThe Alpha Clermont Road passes through the locality from the south (Alpha) to the north-west (Quetta).\nThe principal land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe origin of the name is unclear but there has been a Surbiton pastoral run since at least 1866 when it was operated by William Killgour, who came to the colony of New South Wales from London in 1856. It may have been named for Surbiton in London.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Surbiton. There is a primary and secondary school in neighbouring Alpha, but only to Year 10. For Years 11 and 12 of secondary schooling, the nearest schools are in Clermont, Barcaldine and Emerald. Boarding schools and distance education are other options.\nReferences"
