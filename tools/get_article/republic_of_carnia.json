Despite Italy not having the right for women to vote in elections, the Republic of Carnia allowed women to vote. A year later in 1945, Italy allowed women to vote.  The country was under a direct democracy and every municipality had a say.\nThe Republic of Carnia consisted of around 40 municipalities with another 8 being only partially controlled. In October 1944, much like the other partisan states, German troops and Cossacks who had joined the German forces in the Soviet Union came and took over the area. The Cossacks were promised this land. Many of the partisans fled to nearby Yugoslavia.\nSee also\n*Italian Partisan Republics\n*Italian resistance movement\nReferences"
