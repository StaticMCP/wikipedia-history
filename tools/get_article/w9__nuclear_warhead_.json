It was produced starting in 1952 and all were retired by 1957, being superseded by the W19.\nDescription\nThe W9 was  in diameter,  long, and weighed . It had an explosive yield of .\nThe W9 was a gun-type nuclear weapon, using around  of highly enriched uranium in one large rings assembly and one smaller bullet, which was fired down a tube by conventional explosives into the rings assembly to achieve critical mass and detonate the weapon.\nThe W9 units which were retired in 1957 were recycled into lower yield T-4 Atomic Demolition Munitions. These were the first (semi) man-portable nuclear weapons.\nTests\nThe W9 is only the second gun-type nuclear weapon known to have been detonated; the first was the Little Boy nuclear weapon used in World War II.\nThe W9 artillery shell was test fired once, fired from the \"Atomic Annie\" M65 Atomic Cannon, in Upshot-Knothole Grable on May 25, 1953 at the NTS. Yield was the expected 15 kilotons.\nSubsequently, the W33 nuclear artillery shell was test fired twice (not in a gun) during its development (shots Nougat/Aardvark and Plumbbob/Laplace). These four detonations are the only identified gun-type bomb detonations.\nGallery\nFile:UpshotKnotholeGrable.gif|The W9 nuclear artillery shell was tested during the Upshot-Knothole Grable shot in 1953 with a yield of 15 kilotons, about the same strength as the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II\nFile:Upshot_Knothole_Grable.gif|Full uncut detonation of Upshot Knothole Grable, launched out of the Atomic Annie device on 5/25/1953.
