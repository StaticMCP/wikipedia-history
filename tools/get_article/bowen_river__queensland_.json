The river then flows north-west again between the Herbert Range and Leichhardt Range then discharges into the Burdekin River, south southeast of . The river descends  over its  course.\nThe catchment area of the river occupies  of which an area of  is composed of riverine wetlands. The catchment is in poor condition with much of the riparian habitat having been cleared and prone to erosion. The area is mostly used for cattle grazing with the towns of Collinsville and Glendon both drawing their town water supply from the Bowen River Weir. The river has a mean annual discharge of .\nThe Bowen River Weir supplies water to a coal mine, power station and the township of Collinsville.\nHistory\nThe river was named in 1861 by the Queensland Government, derived from the name of the town Bowen which was named in honour of Sir George Bowen, a  Governor of Queensland.\nIn the 1860s, Richard Daintree made mineral discoveries along the river. Daintree made the first systematic examination of the Bowen River coal seams near Collinsville.\nCirca 1865, the Bowen River Hotel was built at the top of a steep bank of the river (). The hotel is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.\nConstruction of the Bowen River Weir commenced in April 1982 and was completed in August 1983. The 6.5 million project is situated approximately  south of Collinsville and delivers water to the Newlands Coal Mine.\nSee also\n}}\n*\nReferences\nExternal links"
