It was founded on March 15, 1995, under the leadership of Benjamin Bounkoulou.\nThe UR was established by members of parliament who left the ruling Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS) and another party in January 1995, complaining of government favoritism towards people from Niari Region and Lékoumou Region at the expense of Bouenza Region, from which these members of parliament originated.\nThe UR is part of the presidential majority supporting President Denis Sassou Nguesso.\nMichel Bidimbou was elected as the UR's Secretary-General in late 2006.\nIn the parliamentary election held on June 24 and August 5, 2007, the party won 1 out of 137 seats.\nReferences"
