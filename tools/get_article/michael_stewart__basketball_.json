He averaged 4.3 ppg and 4.7 rpg in 117 games and finished as the Bears' all-time leading shot-blocker (207). Stewart set a school record by blocking 59 shots as a freshman in 1993–94 and holds the four best single-season totals for blocks in school history. He never missed a game, playing in all 117 games during his collegiate career and shooting .510 from the field.\nAt the 1994 U.S. Olympic Festival, Stewart was a member of the bronze medal-winning West team.\nNBA career\nStewart went undrafted in the 1997 NBA draft, but  was signed to a one-year contract by the Sacramento Kings on September 11, 1997. This was a dream come true for Stewart, as he had served as a ball boy for the Kings in his youth. As a rookie in 1997–98, he led the Kings in blocked shots and ranked second overall among NBA rookies. He also blocked nine shots in one game. On January 21, 1999, Stewart was signed as a free agent by the Toronto Raptors. During the ensuing offseason, he was re-signed to a six-year, $24&nbsp;million contract by the team.\nIn 2002, Stewart was traded from the Raptors (along with a future first round pick) to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Lamond Murray.\nIn 2003, Stewart, Chris Mihm, Ricky Davis and a 2005 second-round draft pick were traded to the Boston Celtics for Kedrick Brown, Eric Williams, and Tony Battie. Stewart played sparingly for the Celtics, appearing in seventeen games before being traded at the 2005 trade deadline alongside Tom Gugliotta, Gary Payton and a 2006 first-round draft pick to the Atlanta Hawks for Antoine Walker. Stewart retired after the season.\nCareer statistics\nNBA\nSource\nRegular season\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Sacramento\n| 81||37||21.7||.480||&ndash;||.458||6.6||.8||.4||2.4||4.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Toronto\n| 42||2||9.4||.415||&ndash;||.680||2.4||.1||.1||.7||1.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Toronto\n| 42||1||9.3||.377||&ndash;||.563||2.2||.1||.1||.5||1.4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Toronto\n| 26||0||4.7||.324||&ndash;||.611||1.1||.1||.2||.1||1.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Toronto\n| 11||0||8.5||.348||.&ndash;||.545||2.3||.3||.4||.3||2.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland\n| 47||0||5.3||.378||&ndash;||.667||1.2||.1||.0||.3||.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cleveland\n| 8||2||9.5||.429||&ndash;||1.000||2.3||.0||.1||1.0||1.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Boston\n| 17||0||4.2||.400||&ndash;||.500||.6||.0||.1||.1||.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Atlanta\n| 12||1||12.1||.524||&ndash;||.429||3.3||.4||.5||.4||2.1\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career\n| 286 || 43 || 11.5 || .442 || &ndash; || .522 || 3.2 || .3 || .2 || 1.0 || 2.2\nPlayoffs\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2001\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Toronto\n| 2||0||2.0||.000||&ndash;||&ndash;||.5||.0||.0||.0||.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2002\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Toronto\n| 1||0||8.0||1.000||&ndash;||&ndash;||3.0||.0||.0||1.0||4.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2004\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Boston\n| 1||0||2.0||&ndash;||&ndash;||&ndash;||.0||.0||.0||.0||.0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career\n| 4||0||3.5||.667||&ndash;||&ndash;||1.0||.0||.0||.3||1.0\nReferences\nExternal links"
