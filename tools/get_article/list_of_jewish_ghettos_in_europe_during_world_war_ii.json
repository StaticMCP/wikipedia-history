Jewish population (and sometimes Romani people) on territories they controlled.\nMost of the ghettos were set up by the Third Reich in the course of World War II.\nIn total, according to United States Holocaust Memorial Museum archives, \"The Germans established at least 1,000 ghettos in German-occupied and annexed Poland and the Soviet Union alone.\"\nTherefore, the examples are intended only to illustrate their scope across  Eastern and Western Europe.\nIn Europe\nLarge Nazi ghettos in which Jews were confined existed across the continent.\nThese ghettos were liquidated as Holocaust transports delivered their helpless victims to concentration and extermination camps built by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland.\nGerman-occupied Poland\nFollowing the 1939 invasion of Poland, the new ghetto system had been imposed by Nazi Germany roughly between October 1939 and July 1942 in order to confine Poland's Jewish population of 3.5 million for the purpose of persecution, terror, and exploitation.\nThe Warsaw Ghetto was the largest ghetto in all of Nazi occupied Europe, with over 400,000 Jews crammed into an area of , or 7.2 persons per room.\nThe Łódź Ghetto was the second largest, holding about 160,000 inmates.\nA more complete list of over 270 ghettos with an approximate number of prisoners, dates of creation and liquidation, as well as known deportation routes to extermination camps, is available at Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland.\nBelow, selected Nazi German designations are listed.\n* Baranowicz Ghetto, today Belarus\n* Będzin Ghetto, site of
