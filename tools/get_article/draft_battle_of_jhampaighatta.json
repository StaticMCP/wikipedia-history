It resulted in the halt of Jayavarman's expansion into Rajputana.\nPrelude\nPrior to the battle, Jayavarman had expanded his domain's territories northwards, around Atru as attested to his 1257 inscription located in it.\nThis ignited a series of conflicts with the Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura under Jaitrasimha, who ruled Ranthambore.\nWhile marching north with his army, Jayavarman seems to have encountered Jaitrasimha at Jhampaighatta.\nBattle\nThe 1288 CE Balvan inscription of Hammiradeva suggests that his father Jaitra-simha (died 1283 CE) defeated \"Jayasimha of Mandapa-Durga\", who was likely Jayavarman II.\nThe inscriptions states that he defeated the brave warriors of Jayasimha at Jhampaighatta, and imprisoned them at Ranthambore.\nAftermath\nThe battle led to the end of Jayavarman II's expansionist campaigns in Rajputana, but did not undermine his authority in territories already under his control.\nReferences"
