      "text": "# Australasian Shadows Awards\n\nThe Australasian Shadows Awards, formerly known as the Australian Shadows Awards, are annual literary awards established by the Australasian Horror Writers Association (AHWA) in 2005 to honour the best published works of horror fiction written or edited by an Australian/New Zealand/Oceania resident in the previous calendar year.\nAwards criteria and history\nWorks are judged on their overall effect within the horror genre based on the author's skill, delivery, and the work's lasting resonance. Each year, a director is appointed by the AHWA to administer the award. Shortlists for each category are determined by a panel of judges, and the shortlisted nominees are announced in March/April every year.\nFrom 2005 to 2008, the Australian Shadows Award evaluated novels, anthologies, and short stories against each other in a single category. In 2009, the award was expanded into three categories: Short Fiction, Long Fiction, and Edited Publication.\nFrom 2011, the award was restructured to consist of five categories: Novel; Long Fiction (novellas and novelettes); Short Fiction (short stories); Collection (single author collections); and Edited Publication (anthologies and magazine issues). In 2013, the 'Long Fiction' award category was renamed the 'Paul Haines Award for Long Fiction' in honour of New Zealand/Australian author Paul Haines. In 2015, two additional categories were added: Best Comic/Graphic Novel and The Rocky Wood Award for Non-Fiction and Criticism.\nThe Australian Shadows Awards were sponsored by Altair Australia Books in its first two years, through the donation of two statuettes created by dark fantasy artist Brom (supplied by The Franklin Mint). Currently, winners of the awards receive a gravestone-shaped trophy hand-crafted by Sydney-based artist, Adam Galea.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the below list, the years correspond to the year of the book's eligibility; the awards are always announced the following year. If the short story was originally published in an anthology with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the anthology title and anthology publisher's name is included.\n2005\nJudges\n* Guest judge: Kim Wilkins\n* Award Director: Marty Young\nWinner\n* '\"Father Muerte and the Flesh\", Lee Battersby, Aurealis #36'\nNominees\n* \"Pater Familias\", Lee Battersby, Shadowed Realms #3\n* Shadow Box, Shane Jiraiya Cummings & Angela Challis (eds) (Brimstone Press)\n* \"The Red Priest's Homecoming\", Dirk Flinthart, Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine #17\n* The Grinding House, Kaaron Warren (CSFG Publishing)\n2006\nJudges\n* Judging panel: David Schembri, Miranda Siemienowicz, Mark Smith-Briggs\n* Guest judge: Robert Hood\n* Award Director: Marty Young\nWinner\n* 'The Pilo Family Circus, Will Elliott (ABC Books)'\nNominees\n* \"Father Renoir's Hands\", Lee Battersby, Through Soft Air (Prime Books)\n* \"The Dying Light\", Deborah Biancotti, Eidolon I (Eidolon Books)\n* \"The Blow-Off\", Stephen Dedman, Brutarian #47\n* \"The Bridal Bier\", Carol Ryles, Eidolon I (Eidolon Books)\nHonourable mentions\n* \"Silk and Pearls\", K.
