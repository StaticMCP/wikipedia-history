It comprises multiple performance ensembles including marching band, concert bands, jazz band, percussion units, and guard units.\nThe Viking Band has been recognized by the '''Georgia Music Educator's Association (GMEA) as one of the best high school band programs in the state of Georgia by being awarded the GMEA “Exemplary Performance Award” for outstanding achievement in 2012.\nHistory\nThe band began as just a marching program in August 1996 with just 21 freshmen students, along with the opening of Northgate High School. Founding director Alan Armstrong, with assistant director Christopher Sink, led the program’s head staff up until 2024. The band quickly grew an undefinable reputation of excellence underneath the Armstrong family — constructing a family enterprise as the staff.\nDuring its early years, the band rapidly expanded in both size and scope. Within just a few years, it grew to include over 150 members, adding ensembles such as concert band, jazz band, and percussion groups alongside the marching program.\nBy the 2000s, the marching band became a consistent competitor in regional circuits, earning superior ratings and class championships. The program developed a reputation for excellence in the Georgia marching community, highlighted by multiple grand championships at invitational competitions.\nIn addition to competition, the Viking Band became active in public performances throughout Coweta County and the greater Atlanta area. The marching band has appeared in events such as the WSB-TV Salute to America Fourth of July Parade in Atlanta, as well as numerous community parades and civic celebrations in Newnan and Sharpsburg.\nIn 2024, founding director Alan Armstrong formally announced his retirement from the program after 29 years, leaving the band behind under the direction of Christopher Sink.\nIn 2025, the Viking Band announced that the role of the new associate director would be taken on by Jason Carpio.\nMarching Band\nThe Northgate Viking Marching Band' is the most impactful ensemble of the Northgate High School music program. The unit performs at football games, pep rallies, parades, and community events in Newnan and Sharpsburg, Georgia. In addition to its role as a spirit organization for the school, the marching band competes in regional and state-level competitions.\nSince its formation in 1996, the marching band has established a strong competitive record, earning more than 190 class, divisional, and grand championship titles. The program reports a winning percentage of over 90 percent in its classification across a span of more than 20 years.\nThe marching band has participated in notable public performances, including appearances in the WSB-TV Salute to America Fourth of July Parade in Atlanta and various holiday parades throughout Coweta County. Its repertoire includes field shows designed annually, often built around a unifying musical or thematic concept. Each year’s production is performed at football halftime shows, local exhibitions, and judged competitions.\nThe marching band also includes specialized sections such as the color guard and percussion ensemble, both of which compete independently in winter and indoor circuits during the off-season, for the Southern Association for Performance Arts (SAPA) and Georgia Indoor Percussion Association (GIPA), respectively.\nCurrent\nThe Viking Marching Band is currently in the 2025 season, performing their 2025 competitive field show, \"Brick by Brick.\" The show features music repertoire composed from music from The Lego Movie, such as the track, \"Everything is Awesome.\"\nIn 2024, the Viking Marching Band won a grand champion title at the 2024 Golden River Invitational and Haralson County High School in Tallapoosa, Georgia by performing their 2024 competitive field show, \"What's the Point?\"'' as a retirement send-off for the Armstrong family.\nReferences"
