Cellular agriculture refers to the development of agricultural products - especially animal products - from cell cultures rather than the bodies of living organisms.  This includes in vitro or cultured meat, as well as cultured dairy, eggs, leather, gelatin, and silk.  In recent years a number of cellular animal agriculture companies and non-profits have emerged due to technological advances and increasing concern over the animal welfare and rights, environmental, and public health problems associated with conventional animal agriculture.\nTimeline\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!
