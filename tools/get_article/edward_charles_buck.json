He came to be known as the \"Grand Old Man\" of Indian agriculture.\nFamily and education\nBuck was the son of Zechariah Buck, organist and master of the choristers at Norwich Cathedral for 58 years, and his second wife, Lucy Holloway. He was educated in Norwich and at Oakham School and later studied at Clare College, Cambridge, receiving a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree in 1862. In 1886, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law (LL.D.) degree, and in 1898 he became an honorary Fellow of Clare College.\nCareer\nin Shimla, 1880s.]]\nBuck joined the Bengal Civil Service and served in the agricultural department of the North-Western Provinces from 1875 to 1880 before becoming a secretary to the Revenue and Agricultural Department in 1882, succeeding Allan Octavian Hume.\nAlong with Lockwood Kipling and others he was involved in the promotion of arts, including the use of photography for documentation. He was also involved in nearly shutting down the Archaeological Survey of India.\nHe was keen outdoorsman and one of his hobbies was \"to plunge with a native hunter into a Himalayan forest, which he would penetrate before the dawn of day\". From 1882 to 1896 he resided at The Retreat in Mashobra, sharing it for some years with Courtenay Ilbert and also with Earl Roberts when he was Commander-in-Chief. The property was later purchased by the Government for use by the Viceroy of India.\nRecognition and later life\n(seated at centre), and other Indian Civil Service officers, c. 1890.]]\nFor his contribution to agriculture in India, Buck came to be called the \"Grand Old Man\" of Indian agriculture.
