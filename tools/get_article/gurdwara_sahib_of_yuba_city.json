The Gurdwara has a main Langar hall and prayer hall.  The temple led to a \"renaissance of the Sikh community in Yuba City,\" including the 1980 establishment of the local Sikh parade, which has become one of the largest Sikh festivals outside India.\nSee also\n*Gurdwaras in the United States\nReferences\nSources\n*[http://sikhtempleyubacity.com/ Official Temple website]"
