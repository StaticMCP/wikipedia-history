The day afterward, the surviving Boko Haram militants ambushed a different group of Nigerian soldiers on the outskirts of the Kasiya forest near Kangarwa, killing 40 soldiera and leaving 65 others missing.\nBackground\nBoko Haram emerged in 2009 as a jihadist social and political movement in a failed rebellion in northeast Nigeria. Throughout the following years, Abubakar Shekau unified militant Islamist groups in the region and continued to foment the rebellion against the Nigerian government, conducting terrorist attacks and bombings in cities and communities across the region. The area around the Kasiya forest had been a known Boko Haram hub of activity, with the group using their base in the forest to kill 40 Nigerian soldiers in Gashua in May. The base itself was extremely well-defended and highly fortified.\nBattles\nNigerian officials stated that the battle began when Nigerian troops infiltrated the camp on the night of September 12. These troops were part of the 81st Battalion of the 7th Division of the Nigerian Army. These troops had aerial support, and the battle at Kasiya lasted for several hours. The militants, caught by surprise, shot wildly at the Nigerian soldiers. The militants were forced to desert the camp. Nigerian officials said that over 150 militants were killed during the battle, along with sixteen Nigerian soldiers. Of the soldiers, one officer and a lieutenant were killed. Nine more soldiers were also missing. A top Boko Haram commander, Abba Goroma, was killed as well.\nThe battle was a major victory for Nigerian forces after several hefty losses against Boko Haram. In the days following the attack, the surviving militants began ambushes on Nigerian soldiers in the Kasiya forest. At least 40 soldiers from the 134th Battalion of the 12th Brigade were killed and 65 others missing by the militants on September 13 after no aerial support showed up. The Nigerian army denied the existence of this attack.\nReferences"
