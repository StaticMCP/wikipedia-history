In the time-based toll system, the D46 motorway is tolled along its entire length, i.e. from the Vyškov-východ off-ramp (exit 1) to the end of the motorway after the Slavonín off-ramp (exit 37).\nHistory\nThe construction of 38&nbsp;km of the D46 began in 1972, with the first section finished in 1974. It was not until 1992 that the full length of the projected motorway could be driven. Originally, the D46 was actually just an expressway. It was officially turned into a motorway in December 2015. Currently, it is still used as an alternative to the D1 motorway. Capacity-wise, however, the narrow S 20.5/100 category road is no longer sufficient.\nFuture modernizations\nThe D46 motorway is completed in its entire length according to the current motorway network concept. Therefore, all upcoming projects concern only construction modifications of already completed sections.\nA rest area, MÚK Držovice is planned for 2030.\nImages\nFile:Highway D46 (Czech Republic) on 1st kilometr to the south.jpg | Highway D46 on its 1st kilometr in direction to Vyškov at interchange Vyškov.\nFile:Highway D46 (Czech Republic) on 13th kilometr to the south.jpg | Highway D46 on its 13th kilometr in direction to Vyškov at bridge near Brodek u Prostějova.\nFile:Highway D46 (Czech Republic) on 15th kilometr to the south.jpg | Highway D46 on its 15th kilometr in direction to Vyškov at bridge near Dobrochov.\nFile:Highway D46 (Czech Republic) on 22nd kilometr to the north.jpg | Highway D46 on its 22nd kilometr in direction to Olomouc at interchange Prostějov-jih.\nRoute description\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061207030114/http://www.ceskedalnice.cz/r46.htm Info on ceskedalnice.cz]\n*[http://www.dalnice-silnice.cz/R/R46.htm Info on dalnice-silnice.cz]\nReferences\nContent in this edit is translated from the existing Czech Wikipedia article at :cs:Dálnice D46; see its history for attribution."
