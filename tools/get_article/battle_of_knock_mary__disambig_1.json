In revenge for this William Drummond, the son of the 1st Lord Drummond attacked the Murrays.\nThe battle\nThe clans met initially at Knock Mary, a hill on the south bank of the River Earn between the river and Drummond Castle. At first the Murrays were winning, but the battle was turned by the arrival of Campbells from Dunstaffnage under Duncan Campbell, McRobbies from Balloch and Faichneys from Argyllshire.  Campbell had come to Strathearn to avenge the Murrays' recent murder of his two brothers-in-law and father-in-law, Drummond of Menie.  Traditionally the dead from this battle were believed to be buried in the cairn of Rottenreoch, just north of Knock Mary (, but this appears to be a Neolithic long cairn.\nHaving fled the battlefield, the Murrays crossed the River Earn and took refuge in the Kirk of Monzievaird, about a mile north of the river. Drummond was happy to let them go, but as Campbell returned home, an arrow fired from the church killed  one of his men. In revenge the church was burned to the ground, killing those inside.  Reports on casualties vary between 120 and 160 Murrays. This became known as the Massacre of Monzievaird.\nAftermath\nWilliam Drummond was arrested and despite his protests that the Drummonds had nothing to do with the fire, he was executed at Stirling along with many of his friends.\nGallery\nFile:Track west of Knock Mary - geograph.org.uk - 81053.jpg|Looking towards the site, of the battle on the hill of Knock Mary\nFile:Woodland track at Knock Mary - geograph.org.uk - 81043.jpg|A path inside Knock Mary\nFile:Rottenreoch chambered cairn - geograph.org.uk - 1571565.jpg|The once rumoured burial place of the battle, the cairn of Rottenreoch\nMurray Mausoleum and burial ground geograph NN8523-4585976.jpg|The site of the ensuing massacre at the Church of Monzievaird, near Hosh\nReferences"
