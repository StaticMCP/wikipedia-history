It was part of a campaign by the British to expel the French from North America, in the French and Indian War. General Jean-Armand, and Baron Dieskau led a variety of regulars and irregulars. William Johnson led an army consisting solely of colonial irregulars and Iroquois warriors under Hendrick Theyanoguin. The battle consisted of three separate phases and ended in victory for the British and their allies. Afterward, Johnson built Fort William Henry in order to consolidate his gains.\nBackground\nWilliam Johnson – who had recently been named the British agent to the Iroquois – arrived at the southern end of Lac du Saint Sacrement on 28 August 1755, and renamed it \"Lake George\" in honor of his sovereign, George II. He intended to advance via Lake George and Lake Champlain to attack French-held Fort St. Frédéric at Crown Point, which was a keystone in the defense of Canada.\nTo stop Johnson's advance, Dieskau had already left Crown Point for an encampment situated between the two lakes (later to be built into Fort Carillon, the precursor of Fort Ticonderoga.) On 4 September, Dieskau launched a raid on Johnson's base, the recently constructed Fort Edward (at the time called \"Fort Lyman\") on the Hudson River. His aim was to destroy the boats, supplies and artillery that Johnson needed for his campaign. Leaving half his force at Carillon, Dieskau led the rest on an alternate route to the Hudson by landing his men at South Bay and then marching them east of Lake George along Wood Creek. Dieskau arrived near Fort Edward on the evening of 7 September, with around 200 French regular grenadiers from the Régiment de la Reine and the Régiment de Languedoc, over 600 Canadian militia, various Abenaki and Nipissing allies.\nJohnson, camped  north of Fort Edward at the southern end of Lake George, was alerted by scouts to the presence of enemy forces to the south, and he dispatched a messenger to warn the 500-man garrison at Fort Edward. The messenger was intercepted and soon a supply train was captured. As a result, the disposition of all of Johnson's forces became known to Dieskau. The Abenaki Indians in the French party, after holding council, declined to assault Fort Edward because they expected it to be defended with cannons; so in the morning, Dieskau gave the order to march north toward the lake.\nAt 9:00&nbsp;a.m. on 8 September, Johnson sent Colonel Ephraim Williams south to reinforce Fort Edward with 250 Mohawk allies and 1,000 troops from Williams' Massachusetts Regiment and Colonel Nathan Whiting's Connecticut Regiment. Dieskau, warned by a deserter of Williams' approach, blocked the portage road with his French grenadiers and sent his Canadians and Indians to ambush the British from both sides of the road. They lay in wait in a ravine three miles south of the present-day village of Lake George.\nOrder\n;British\nMajor-General William Johnson commanded 1,500 colonial militiamen. He was also joined by over 200 Iroquois allies. Later, 220 militiamen were sent to reinforce Johnson. Johnson had no regulars.\n;French\nMaréchal de camp Jean-Armand, Baron de Dieskau only had 220 regulars, which were grenadiers. The remaining force consisted of 600 Canadian militiamen and 700 Indians.\nBattle\n\"Bloody Morning Scout\"\nWilliams' column marched straight into the trap and was engulfed in a blaze of enemy musketry. In an engagement known as the \"Bloody Morning Scout\", Williams and Hendrick were killed along with many of their troops. At this point, the French regulars, brought forward by Dieskau, poured volleys into the beleaguered colonial troops. Most of the New Englanders fled toward Johnson's camp while about 100 of their comrades under Whiting and Lt. Col. Seth Pomeroy and most of the surviving Mohawks covered their withdrawal with a fighting retreat. The British rearguard was able to inflict substantial casualties on their overconfident pursuers. Pomeroy noted that his men \"killed great numbers of them; they were seen to drop like pigeons\". One of those killed in this phase of the battle was Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, the highly respected commander of Dieskau's Canadian and Indian forces. His fall caused great dismay, particularly to the French Indians.\nAssault on Johnson's camp\nDieskau ordered his Canadians and Indians to follow up their success with an attack on Johnson's camp. With their morale already shaken by the loss of their leader, the Caughnawagas \"did not wish to attack an entrenched camp, the defenders of which included hundreds of their Mohawk kinsmen. The Abenakis would not go forward without the Caughnawagas, and neither would the Canadians\". Hoping to shame the Indians into attacking, Dieskau formed his French grenadiers into a column, six abreast, and led them in person along the lake road. The grenadiers marched toward the clearing where Johnson's camp was, around which Johnson had hurriedly constructed defensive barricades of \"wagons, overturned boats and hewn-down trees\". Once the grenadiers were out in the open ground, the British gunners crewing Johnson's three cannons loaded them with grapeshot and cut \"lanes, streets and alleys\" through the French ranks. When Johnson was wounded and retired to his tent for treatment, Major-general Phineas Lyman took over command. When Dieskau went down with a serious wound, the French attack was abandoned.\nAfter the French withdrawal, the British found about 20 severely wounded Frenchmen who were lying too close to the British artillery's field of fire for their comrades to retrieve them. They included Baron Dieskau, who had paid the price of leading from the front with a shot through the bladder. (Benjamin West painted a portrait of Johnson saving a French officer—allegedly Baron Dieskau).\nBloody Pond\nMeanwhile, Colonel Joseph Blanchard, commander of Fort Edward, saw the smoke from the battle in the distance and sent out Nathaniel Folsom's 80-strong company of the New Hampshire Provincial Regiment and 40 New York Provincials under Captain McGinnis to investigate.\nHearing the report of guns in the direction of the Lake, they pressed forward, and when within about two miles of it, fell in with the baggage of the French army protected by a guard, which they immediately attacked and dispersed. About four o'clock in the afternoon, some 300 of the French army appeared in sight. They had rallied, and retreating in tolerable order. Capt. Folsom posted his men among the trees, and as the enemy approached, they poured in upon them a well directed and galling fire. He continued the attack in this manner till prevented by darkness, killing many of the enemy, taking some of them prisoners, and finally driving them from the field. He then collected his own wounded, and securing them with many of the enemy's packs, he brought his prisoners and booty safe into camp. The next day the rest of the baggage was brought in, thus securing the entire baggage and ammunition of the French army. In this brilliant affair, Folsom lost only six men, but McGinnis was mortally wounded, and died soon after. The loss of the French was very considerable.\nThe bodies of the French troops who were killed in this engagement (actually Canada-born French colonials and their Native American allies, not French regulars) were thrown into the pool \"which bears to this day the name of Bloody Pond\".\nAftermath\ndepicting Hendrick Theyanoguin and William Johnson]]\nThe Battle of Lake George, comprising three parts, eventually ended in a British victory. Johnson's expedition eventually stopped short of Fort St. Frédéric and the strategic result at Lake George was significant. Johnson was able to advance a considerable distance down the lake and consolidated his gains by building Fort William Henry at its southern end. Historian Fred Anderson writes that had Dieskau succeeded in halting Johnson at Fort Edward, it would have not only ended the threat to Fort St. Frédéric but would also \"roll back New York's and New England's defenses to Albany itself\".\nCasualties\nThere are as many different versions of the casualties suffered at Lake George as there are accounts of the battle.\nA letter of 20 October 1755, from Monsieur Doreil to the Comte d'Argenson, a senior French commander in North America, confirms that the French grenadiers paid for their assault on Johnson's entrenchments with the loss of more than a third of their total strength: the Regiment de la Reine had 21 killed or missing and 30 wounded, while the Regiment de Languedoc had 5 killed and 21 wounded.\nPeter Palmer states in his history that \"the loss of the English this day was about two hundred and sixteen killed and ninety-six wounded; of the French the loss was much greater.\" He claims Johnson estimated the French loss at five to six hundred, while stating that another source noted it as \"a little short of eight hundred\".\nW. Max Reid says, \"The English loss in killed, wounded, and missing at the battle of Lake George was 262, and that of the French, by their own account, was 228\".\nIan K. Steele says of the British losses, \"The official returns, corrected, read 154 dead, 103 wounded, and 67 missing. Most of those listed as missing had not deserted into woods full of Canadians and Indians; most of the missing were later found dead. Pomeroy was preoccupied with the losses, but overlooked the Iroquois casualties, which brought the totals to 223 dead and about 108 wounded\".\nOf the French losses, Steele says, \"The official French journal of the operation probably minimized Indian casualties in a total count of 149 dead, 163 wounded, and 27 taken prisoner. The reported number of those killed, wounded, and captured was remarkably close on both sides, with those fighting for the English losing 331 and the French, 339.\" Steele does not give a reason for his suspicion that the Indian casualties were under-reported.\nIn his 2009 book, Combattre pour la France en Amérique, Marcel Fournier diverges considerably from the other sources in reporting the casualties for the Battle of Lac St-Sacrement (as the French called it) at 800 killed or wounded for the British and 200 killed or wounded for the French.\nMap gallery\nImage:Carte Guerre de 7 ans Amérique du nord.PNG|Map showing location of fighting in the French and Indian War\nImage:Nouvelle-France 1754.jpg|French forts on Lake George.\nImage:Lake Champlain Landsat.jpg|Landsat photo of lakes Champlain and George and portions of the Hudson and Richelieu rivers\nImage:Champlainmap.svg|Map showing the Lake Champlain and Richelieu River watershed\nImage:Hudsonmap.png|The watershed of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers\nSee also\n* Battle of Lake Champlain\n* Thomas Johnston - engraver of first historical print in America, A prospective plan of the battle fought near Lake George on the 8th of September 1755.\n* Lake George Battlefield Park Historic District\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Harrison, Bird (1962).
