The enhanced-CD release includes a short film by Martina Hoogland-Ivanow involving time-lapse photography and dream-like visuals.\nRelease\nTaxidermy was released in the United Kingdom on compact disc which features a short film by Martina Hoogland-Ivanow, and as a 12\" vinyl LP.\nCritical reception\nNME wrote of the album: \"while carrying on Daisy Chainsaw's predilection for rock as infantile nightmare, here the scope is much wider than a one-track take on banshee pop. There are some obvious precedents, notably Björk and PJ Harvey, but much more than either of those two reference points, this debut album is frequently akin to eavesdropping on psychotherapy.\"\nTrack listing\n| length1= 2:08\n| title2= Soda Dreamer\n| writer2=\n| length2= 3:39\n| title3= I Adore You\n| writer3=\n| length3= 3:24\n| title4= Yesterday's Hymn\n| writer4=\n| length4= 3:04\n| title5= Pretty Polly\n| note5= traditional\n| length5= 5:10\n| title6= Yemaya\n| writer6=\n| length6= 2:48\n| title7= Madraykin\n| writer7=\n| length7= 3:58\n| title8=X-ing Off the Days\n| writer8= Gray\n| length8=4:21\n| title9= Hide from Time\n| writer9=\n| length9= 4:39\n| title10= Friday's Child\n| writer10=\n| length10=3:09\n| title11=Sleepwalking\n| writer11=\n| length11=4:22\n| title12=Are the Songs My Disease?\n| writer12=\n| length12=3:23\n| title13=Weeds\n| writer13=\n| length13=3:29\n}}\n| title14 = A Heavenly Surrender\n| writer14= Garside\n| length14=3:33\n| title15=Pray for Me\n| writer15=Garside\n| length15=1:35\n}}\nSingles\n*\"X-ing Off the Days\" (1999)\n*\"Cold Fish\" (1999)\n*\"Jolene\" (2000)\n*\"I Adore You\" (2000)\nPersonnel\nQueenadreena\n*KatieJane Garsidevocals, arrangement\n*Crispin Grayguitar, glockenspiel, harmonica, backing vocals, arrangement\n*Dizzy Qbass\n*Steve Drewdrums\nTechnical personnel\n*Ken Thomasproduction\n*Queenadreenaproduction\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://archive.org/details/mbid-cc2d44d6-f2aa-48c1-868d-72008be6eb15 Cover art and liner notes] at the Internet Archive"
