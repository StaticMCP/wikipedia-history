It was carved out from the then-Diocese of Benin City (now the Archdiocese of Benin City), and initially comprised eight parishes: Warri, Aragba, Ashaka, Sapele, Okpara Inland, Ozoro, Ughelli, and Bomadi.\nThe first bishop of Warri was Lucas Olu Chukwuka Nwaezeapu, who served from 10 March 1964 until 10 September 1983. After a period of vacancy, Bishop Edmund Joseph Fitzgibbon, S.P.S., was appointed on 31 August 1991 and served until 3 March 1997. He was succeeded by Bishop Richard Anthony Burke, S.P.S., who led the diocese until his appointment as Archbishop of Benin City on 24 December 2007. Bishop John 'Oke Afareha succeeded him on 29 March 2010 and served until his retirement on 18 April 2022. The current bishop, Anthony Ovayero Ewherido, was appointed on 28 December 2022 and consecrated on 9 February 2023.\nThe diocese's principal church is the [https://gcatholic.org/churches/africa/2987.htm Sacred Heart Cathedral], located along Warri–Sapele Road in the Agbasa area of Warri.\nAs of 2025, the diocese comprises seven deaneries and 91 parishes or chaplaincies, ministering to a Catholic population of approximately 106,298 faithful.
