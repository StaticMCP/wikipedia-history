France was one of a half-dozen European countries, the others being Austria, Russia, Great Britain, Germany and Italy, which had been granted the right to maintain post offices within the Empire. This privilege was distinct from the so-called \"Capitulations\" which, since the 16th century, had been negotiated with a much larger number of countries and which granted some extraterritorial rights to citizens and commercial enterprises of those countries. Initially restricted to consular mail, these post offices could soon be used by foreign and local businesses and individuals, provided they used the postage stamps of the post office concerned. The system came to end with the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.\n30c, 1902\n3-piaster 30-para overprint on French 25c\nOriginally, the post office used postage stamps of France, but these were denominated in centimes and francs instead of the local piasters, so beginning in 1885, some French stamps were surcharged in piasters, at a rate of four piasters to the franc.\nBeginning in 1902, stamps of the Blanc, Mouchon and Merson series were issued with the inscription \"LEVANT\", both as centime/franc, and with higher values surcharged in piasters. In 1905, 15c stamps in Beirut were surcharged with \"1 Piastre / Beyrouth\".\nWorld War I forced the closure of all the post offices on 13 October 1914. After the war, only the office in Istanbul reopened, operating from August 1921 to July 1923. Stamps of France were again surcharged, with values from 30 paras to 75 piasters.\nPost offices\n* Alexandretta\n* Beirut\n* Candia (now Iraklion)\n* Canea (now Chania)\n* Castellorizo\n* Cavalle\n* Constantinople\n* Dedeagh\n* Galata\n* Gallipoli\n* Jaffa\n* Jerusalem\n* Kustendje (now Constanţa)\n* Latakia\n* Mersin\n* Port Lagos\n* Rhodes\n* Rodosto\n* Salonica\n* Sinope\n* Smyrna\n* Sulina\n* Trebizond\n* Tripoli\n* Tulcea\n* Varna\n* Vathy\n* Volos\nFour post offices also issued their own stamps between 1893 and 1903: Cavalle (present-day Kavala), Dedeagh (Dedeagatch, present-day Alexandroupoli), Port Lagos, and Vathy (Samos).\nImage:Stamp French PO Cavalle 4pi.jpg|Cavalle 4pi\nImage:Stamp French PO Dedeagh 1902 10c.jpg|Dedeagh 10c, postmarked 21 March 1913\nImage:Stamp French PO Port Lagos 1893 5c.jpg|Port Lagos overprint on 5c\nImage:Stamp French PO Vathy 1894 15c.jpg|Vathy overprint on 15c\nSee also\n* French post offices abroad\n* French post offices in Crete\n* French post offices in Egypt\nNotes\nReferences\n* Stanley Gibbons Ltd: various catalogues\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153223/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/home.html Encyclopaedia of Postal History]\n* Stuart Rossiter & John Flower: The Stamp Atlas\nExternal links\n* [http://robert.desert.chez-alice.fr/index.htm ''Bureaux français de l'Empire ottoman''], specialized website awarded by the Académie de philatélie in 2001."
