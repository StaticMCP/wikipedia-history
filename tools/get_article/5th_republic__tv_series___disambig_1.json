The production refused, with producer-director Im Tae-woo saying that they tried their best to maintain objectivity by basing their script on historical records and information that they collected for three years, such as Supreme Court rulings, and other hearing documents and news reports at that time.\nReception\nCritical and public response\nThe Fifth Republic was a politically and socially turbulent era in the country's history, which generated controversy for the drama series.\nIt was so popular in Japan that even Shinzō Abe watched it and people started cosplaying the characters and even fanzines were created.\nIn 2023, as the film 12.12: The Day became popular, people became interested in other works, such as this work which dealt with the Coup d'état of December Twelfth.\nMusic\nAhn Ji-hong wrote the music. In the past, he also participated in MBC's drama Republic series, 3rd Republic and 4th Republic. He tried to create powerful music to capture the diverse and ironic aspects of the drama.\nThe insert songs included \"That Person Back Then\" () of Sim Soo-bong and \"I Love You\" () of Lana. Et. Rospo (), which came out during the real-life October 26 incident.\nSoundtracks\n| extra_column = Artist\n| title_width  = 30%\n| lyrics_width = 25%\n| music_width  = 30%\n| extra_width  = 15%\n| title1       = 5th Republic (Ending)Deus Non Vult (Ending)\n| note1        = Deus Non Vult ()\n| lyrics1      = Ahn Ji-hong\n| music1       = Ahn Ji-hong\n| extra1       = Various Artists\n| length1      = 1:04\n| title2       = 5th Republic (Opening)Deus Non Vult (Opening)\n| note2        = Deus Non Vult ()\n| lyrics2      = Ahn Ji-hong\n| music2       = Ahn Ji-hong\n| extra2       = Various Artists\n| length2      = 0:52\n| total_length = 1:56\n}}\nIn particular, the theme song, Deus Non Vult, is taken from the Latin meaning that humans can forgive history, but \"God will not.\" and used the expression as a parody of Deus vult. The powerful sound achieved by combining the choir's thick sound and rapid repetition with brass and metal has a modern feel.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
