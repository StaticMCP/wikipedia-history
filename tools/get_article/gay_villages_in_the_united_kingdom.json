Bigger cities and metropolitan areas are most popular as they are deemed to be more tolerant and tend to have \"a history of progressive local government policy towards supporting and financing LGBTQ-friendly initiatives.\" There is also a noted circular pattern of migration, whereby once areas have established a reputation as somewhere LGBT people live, more LGBT people are drawn there. LGBT-inclusive areas of UK towns and cities tend to be defined by \"a distinct geographic focal point, a unique culture, a cluster of commercial spaces\" and sometimes a concentration of residences. It is thought that LGBT-inclusive areas help towns and cities in the UK to prosper economically, but some believe the building of such areas creates an isolating effect on some LGBT people who want to blend in.\nBirmingham\nBirmingham is home to 60,000 gay people. The Birmingham Gay Village, which became prominent in the 1990s, is located around Hurst Street in Southside and features clubs, bars and shops.\nBirmingham Pride is celebrated each year around the late May bank holiday weekend; its entertainment and festivities are centred around the Gay Village. Organisers estimated that Pride brings around £15 million to the city's economy. In 2014, it attracted over 50,000 people.\nThe city also has its own LGBT centre, opened in 2013, for support with health and well-being. Midlands Zone, the LGBT magazine for the region, was published every month (1997–2020.)\nBrighton\nin Brighton during Brighton Pride]]\nBrighton has a significant LGBT population, and records LGBT history in the city since the 19th century. Brighton Pride is at the start of August and attracts around 160,000 people every year. Many LGBT pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, cafés and shops are located around Brighton and in particular around St James's Street in Kemptown.\nIn a 2014 estimate, 11–15% of the city's population aged 16 or over is thought to be lesbian, gay or bisexual. The city also had the highest percentage of same-sex households in the UK in 2004 and the largest number of civil partnership registrations outside of London in 2013.\nBristol\nOld Market is the main gay village in Bristol, with its scene centred on West Street. Across the city centre, Frogmore Street in the Old City is a gay area.
