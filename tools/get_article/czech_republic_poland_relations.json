Both joined the EU simultaneously on 1 May 2004. They also both joined NATO on 12 March 1999. Both countries, together with Slovakia and Hungary, form the Visegrád Group, which is an important regional group in Central Europe. Both countries are also members of the Bucharest Nine, Three Seas Initiative, OECD, OSCE, Council of Europe and the World Trade Organization.\nBoth nations have a long historical contact since their foundation in the Early Middle Ages. They share 796&nbsp;km (495&nbsp;mi) of the Czech Republic–Poland border, which can be crossed anywhere without border control under the Schengen Agreement.\nHistory\nand Doubravka of Bohemia, which cemented the first Polish-Bohemian alliance, on a 19th-century painting by Józef Peszka]]\nRelations date back to the Middle Ages, when both countries were established in the 9th-10th century. In the 10th century, Bohemia (Czechia) was the only neighbor of Poland, that was effectively Christianized and organized according to Western European standards, so Mieszko I of Poland drew his standards from Bohemia. The founding Piast and Přemyslid dynasties, of Poland and Czechia (Bohemia) respectively, intermarried several times. Prime examples include first Polish ruler Mieszko I who married Princess Doubravka of Bohemia, and first Bohemian king Vratislaus II who married Princess Świętosława of Poland. Polish ruler Bolesław the Brave also ruled Bohemia (Czechia) in 1003–1004, whereas King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia also ruled Poland in 1296–1305. The subsequent Bohemian kings then claimed the Polish crown until 1335. In 1471, Polish prince Vladislaus Jagiellon, son of Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon, became King of Bohemia, and afterwards the two countries were ruled by two closely related branches of the Jagiellonian dynasty until 1526.\nduring the Polish–Teutonic War of 1431–1435 on a painting by Adolf Liebscher]]\nSeveral Bohemian–Polish wars were fought for control of the border regions of Moravia, Silesia and Lesser Poland in the Middle Ages. Additionally, Bohemia was allied against Poland during the German–Polish wars of 1003–1018, 1028–1031, 1109 and 1157 and the Polish–Teutonic War of 1326–1332. Czechs and Poles were also allies on multiple occasions, with the first alliance formed around 965. Moravia aided Poland during the first Mongol invasion of Poland in 1241. At the Battle of Kressenbrunn between Bohemia and Hungary in 1260, the Polish duchies of Silesia and Kraków fought on opposite sides. Poland aided Bohemia against Hungarians and Germans at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278. In 1363, Poland was allied with Denmark against Bohemia. In 1432, Poland entered an alliance with the Czech Orebites, and then Poles and Czechs together fought many battles in the Polish–Teutonic War of 1431–1435. Some Poles fought on the side of the Czech Taborites in the Battle of Lipany in 1434. In 1457, Czech mercenaries hired by the Teutonic Knights in their Thirteen Years' War of 1454–1466 against Poland sold the strongholds of Malbork, Tczew and Iława to Poland in lieu of indemnities. Bohemia and Poland were part of a coalition of several European countries in the Crusade of Varna of 1443–1444 and the Hungarian–Ottoman War of 1521–1526, which goal was to repel the Ottoman invasion of Europe and liberate the already conquered nations of Southeast Europe. In 1474, Bohemia and Poland were allied against Hungary.\nAfter the Bohemian loss to Austria at the Battle of White Mountain of 1620, many Czechs adhering to the Moravian Church fled subsequent Austrian Catholic persecution to Poland, forming the once sizeable Czech minority in Poland. The main centers of Czechs in Poland included Leszno and, after the Partitions of Poland, Zelów and Kwasiłów. Notable Czech refugee in Poland was philosopher John Amos Comenius. The files and library of the Unity of the Brethren from Leszno, now held at the State Archive and Raczyński Library in Poznań and the Kórnik Library in Kórnik, are listed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\nFollowing Austria's conquests and annexations, both Bohemia and southern Poland belonged to the Austrian Empire (from 1867 Austria-Hungary) until the end of World War I in 1918. Czechoslovakia–Poland relations were established afterwards.\nModern relations\non the Czech–Polish border in the Giant Mountains]]\nThere is a Polish Institute in Prague.
