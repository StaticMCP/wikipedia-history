This distinctive flag, also known as the Presidential Flag, is an emblem of the authority and dignity vested in the office of the President.\nHistory\nThe use of a presidential standard in Turkey dates back to the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923. Initially, the presidential standard closely resembled the national flag of Turkey, with the addition of a gold fringe around the edges to distinguish it from the standard flag. The first document to regulate the Presidential Standard officially is the Flag Regulation issued on October 22, 1925. In this regulation, the definition of the Presidential Standard is provided.\nThe origin of the coat of arms and emblem used today is attributed to Hüsnü Tengüz, the Chief Engraver of the Naval Press. Upon the order of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the production of a presidential coat of arms was requested. This request, conveyed to the Naval Press from the Istanbul Military Tailoring House.\nOn May 29, 1936, Law No. 2994 on the Turkish Flag was enacted, and on September 14, 1937, Regulation No. 2/7175 on the Turkish Flag was accepted. In the annex referred to in Article 36 of this regulation, it is stated that the sun rays in the Presidential Standard are ten each (ten oval, ten pointed). The dimensions of the standard are 70 cm by 70 cm.\nLater, with an Additional Regulation to the Regulation on the Turkish Flag, the dimensions of the standard were determined as 30 cm by 30 cm. This time, with the enforcement of the Regulation Amending the Regulation on the Turkish Flag on February 18, 1978, two new amendments were made. The sun rays in the center of the standard are arranged as 8 long and 8 short rays, lined up in the sequence of one long, one short. It was also determined that all 16 rays, which were determined to be a total of 16, have pointed tips (triangular in shape).\nThe current standard is used according to Article 28 of the Regulation on the Turkish Flag dated January 25, 1985, numbered 85/9034, and the relevant example referred to in this article. The view that the sun in the Presidential Standard represents the Republic of Turkey and the 16 stars represent the independent Turkish states was first put forward in 1969 by Map Officer Akîp Özbek in his book \"The Turkish Presidential Standard and its Meaning.\" This view has been accepted in the following years. In addition to this, other views have been expressed especially regarding the 16 stars. According to one view, 9 of the 16 stars represent the 9 banners used by the ancient (Central Asian) Turks, and the remaining 7 stars represent the 7 banners used by the Anatolian Turks. Thus, the total of 9+7 equals 16.\nFile:Historical flag of the President of Turkey.svg|Version depicted in the flag encyclopedia Flaggenbuch of 1939.\nFile:Flag of the President of Turkey (1925-2012).svg|Historical dimensions until 2012\nDesign and symbolism\nThe Presidential Standard of Turkey features a red field with a white star and crescent emblem in the center. The star and crescent are traditional symbols of Turkish identity and are deeply rooted in the country's history and culture. The red background symbolizes valor, courage, and the blood shed by the nation's defenders throughout history.\nThe star and crescent emblem is positioned prominently in the center of the flag, with the star pointing upwards and the crescent facing to the right. This orientation of the star and crescent is consistent with the design of the national flag of Turkey, which also features these symbols.\nIn Article 27 of the \"Turkish Flag Regulation,\" numbered 85/9034 and dated January 25, 1985, the dimensions of were specified by the cabinet of Turkey.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Design limits\n|-\n!
