      "text": "# War World (series)\n\nWar World is a series of collaborative science fiction books set in the CoDominium universe of Jerry Pournelle, some novels being co-authored by John F. Carr and Don Hawthorne, as well as Larry Niven and S. M. Stirling. It consists of ten short story anthologies by various authors as well as six novels. Most stories take place on a single world, Haven, and many involve battles between Haven's people and the ruthless, genetically engineered race of supersoldiers called Saurons.\nThe War World Setting\nThe War World series is set mostly on a single world, Haven. It is a marginally habitable moon of a supergiant planet called ''Cat's Eye'', the fourth planet in the Byer's Star system. Haven is synchronically tide-locked to its primary, giving it an 86-hour-43-minute-long day-night cycle with respect to Byer's Star and a 131-hour-55-minute Dimday/night cycle with respect to Cat's eye. It has a thin but breatheable atmosphere; this and its distance from Byer's Star make surface conditions on most of Haven very cold and dry, so much so that initial habitation is limited to a single large valley at the equator. Haven is originally settled by the Universal Church of New Harmony, but they are quickly joined by \"involuntary colonists\" (exiled criminals) from Earth, and later other exiles from the CoDominium. Following the defeat of the Saurons and the destruction of their homeworld by the forces of the Empire, a remnant of the Sauron forces occupy the planet as a last hidden refuge. Known HaBandari (The Band) clans are the fan Reenans, fan Gimbutas, fan Tellerman, and fan Haller.\nContents\nThe books in this series were written by several authors. They consist of five collections of short stories and three collaborative novels. Each volume takes place in roughly chronological internal order, but starting in different time periods (for instance, CoDominium: Revolt on War World, chronologically the last collection in the series, is set during the earliest years of human settlement on Haven). Blood Feuds incorporates material that originally appeared in the short story collections. John F. Carr rejuvenated the series with the publication of War World: The Battle of Sauron, by Carr and Don Hawthorne (Pequod Press, 2007).  The series is starting over with the publication of War World: Discovery (2010), edited by John F. Carr. The new books are published in chronological order, with Discovery providing background on the first surveys and colonization. The new volumes include fresh stories intermixed with ones from the original series, providing a more complete look at the War World universe.\nPublications\n*War World, Vol 1: The Burning Eye (1988)\n**\"Prolog: Discovery\" (unattributed)\n**\"Haven\" (unattributed)  - Even before colonization, Haven is a source of conflict as factions fight to determine its status.\n**\"Dream Valley\" - Edward P.
