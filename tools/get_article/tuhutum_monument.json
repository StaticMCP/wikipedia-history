It depicted the arrival of the Hungarians, when Tuhutum jumped off his horse and stabbed his spear into the ground symbolizing the landtaking. A turul was also on the top of the monument. The obelisk was located in a park named after Lajos Szikszai, situated between Zalău City Hall and Zalău River. The park was replaced by a parking area. The monument was destroyed during Communist Romania, in a night of the summer of 1968.\nOnly a copy of the turul situated on the top of the obelisk was completed in 2008 and placed in the yard of the Reformed Church, Zalău. The obelisk is going to be placed in Iuliu Maniu Square, in Zalău.\nNotes and references\nExternal links\n* [http://varos.zilah.net/index.php?option=com_phocagallery&view=category&id=8:zilah-rgi-tuhutum-emlkm&Itemid=191 Zilahi képek - Zilah- Régi Tuhutum emlékmû]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425161809/http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&idart=328 Un monument dispărut]\n* [http://www.adevarul.ro/locale/zalau/Intoarcerea_Turului_intarzie_0_276572559.html# Întoarcerea Turului întârzie]\n* [http://www.magazinsalajean.ro/index.php?cmd=article&artid=13829 Vulturul maghiar se „aseaza” pe toaleta publica din centrul Zalaului]"
