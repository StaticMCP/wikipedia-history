'Idaho' is marked with Jones' rollicking post-bop mastery as he trades solos with Smith and can be heard quoting lines from Monk before yielding to Smith. The cover of Duke Ellington's 'Sophisticated Lady' sparkles from beginning to end. Jones' opening flourish sets the tenure as Smith settles into a smoky lead, containing some nice syncopation and regal augmentation from Jones. ...The tempo is significantly stepped up on a cover of Benny Goodman's 'Flying Home,' which is full of high-spirited playing and garners a sizable reaction from the audience.\" Planer described Fitzgerald's performance on \"Perdido\" as \"hot steppin' and definitive\" and said it featured \"authority, class, and most of all, soul\". Rich and Krupa's performance on The Drum Battle was described by Planer as a \"mile-a-minute wash of profound percussion\".\nTrack listing\n# \"Idaho\" (Jesse Stone) – 7:26\n# \"Sophisticated Lady\" (Duke Ellington, Irving Mills, Mitchell Parish) – 4:35\n# \"Flying Home\" (Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton) – 6:02\n# \"Drum Boogie\" (Gene Krupa, Roy Eldridge) – 9:20\n# \"The Drum Battle\" (Norman Shrudlu) – 3:20\n# \"Perdido\" (Ervin Drake, Hans J.
