It is located on Stanstead Road opposite the Hundred Acre Estate and is backed by the New River.\nEstablished in 1953 as Hoddesdon Secondary School, it adopted the name John Warner in 1968, after the man who established the first all-boys school for all classes and any religious beliefs in 1841.\nThe school has many facilities, including its sport centre which opened in 2001, (consisting of a swimming pool, several astro-turf pitches, sports hall and many other facilities), which is available for use by all students of the school, and also a newly built science block which was added in 2005, that aided the school in gaining the status of a Science College. Many local primary schools in the area have science lessons in the school's new laboratories. The school has specialist technology status. On 1 April 2011, the John Warner School was reformed to Academy status.\nThe school participates in many extra-curricular activities and events, including Model United Nations and the Vex Robotics Competition. It has also begun hosting its own MUN conferences.\nThe school is undergoing renovation to improve the experience of the pupils, with multiple new blocks being built, starting with a new Modern Foreign Languages block, an Engineering & DT block, a new library and temporary Mathematics department. As of May 2016 a new Mathematics block was being built.\nAcademics\nOfsted reports:\n{| class=\"wikitable \"\n|+\n|-\n! Inspection date!!

This award is a combination of eight years' continuous improvement in examination results.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131202174238/http://www.broxbourne.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture/sport_and_leisure_facilities/the_john_warner_sports_centre.aspx The John Warner Sports Centre]"
