It was founded in 1964 as a segregation academy.\nHistory\nHeritage was founded in 1964 as a segregation academy. In 1988, Heritage enrolled its first Black students, Jabari and Jasáda Dunbar.\n1989 football forfeitures\nIn 1989, Heritage Academy became the first school in the Mississippi Association of Independent Schools (MAIS) North Conference to have a black player on its football team. The school received national media attention when two other schools threatened to forfeit games rather than play against a racially integrated opponent. The opponents, two former segregation academies named Sharkey-Issaquena Academy and the East Holmes Academy, claimed that injuries, not race, were the reason for forfeiting the games. Heritage Academy headmaster and head coach Ray Wooten rejected the denials, calling them \"a bunch of bull.\"\nAfter seven players and two school board members resigned, East Holmes Academy reconsidered its decision to forfeit. The black player, sophomore running back Scott Fuller, offered to quit the Heritage Academy team so the game could be played, but coach Ray Wooten insisted that Fuller remain on the team.\nIn 1991, the student body elected Jabari O. Dunbar the first, and to date (as of 2019) only, African-American president of Heritage Academy's Student Government Association. The following year, Jabari graduated with honors, the school's first African-American graduate. His sister Jasa'da Dunbar became the second in 1998.\nAthletics and extracurricular activities\nHeritage Academy's first athletic director was Billy Brewer. When Brewer later accepted a coaching position at Ole Miss, he told the Clarion-Ledger that his involvement with the all-white academy was his \"own business\" and that it would not affect Ole Miss's efforts to recruit black players.\nThe Heritage Academy football team won the MPSA AAA championship in 1986 and the MAIS championship in 2012 and 2019.\nThe Heritage Academy basketball team won MPSA titles in 1992 (2A), 2018 (3A), and 2019(3A). The 2019 basketball team also went on to win the MAIS Overall Championship that year.\nHeritage Academy golf won the MAIS 3A Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2017.\nIn addition to these sports, Heritage Academy also offers baseball, soccer, softball, volleyball, tennis, track and field, cross country, rugby, pickleball, wrestling, and badminton.\nNon-athletic extracurricular opportunities include cheerleading, competitive dance, robotics, quiz bowl, various school clubs, and the spirit store.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.heritagepatriots.com/ Heritage Academy Website]"
