It commemorates the servicemen from Potters Bar who died during the First World War and the Second World War.\nHistory\nThe memorial was designed by the British architect Sir Reginald Blomfield, who was responsible for several other war memorials, including the Menin Gate in Ypres.\nIt was erected after the First World War to commemorate local residents who had died during the conflict. Following the Second World War, additional names were inscribed to honour those who died in that war.\nDesign\nThe memorial is in the form of a tall stone Celtic cross on a tapering shaft and square plinth. Fixed to the base are bronze plaques that record the names of the fallen from both World Wars. The inscription \"THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE\" is engraved on the memorial.\nBlomfield’s design is consistent with his broader work on war memorials, which were often characterised by classical or cross forms, and a focus on dignity and permanence.\nThe Celtic cross was a widely adopted form in British war memorials of the period, symbolising sacrifice and commemoration.\nUse and commemoration\nThe memorial is used as a focal point for annual Remembrance Sunday services. Wreaths are laid and a two-minute silence is observed as part of the national act of remembrance.\nListing\nIn 2018, the memorial was designated as a Grade II listed building by Historic England. The listing describes the structure as \"an eloquent witness to the tragic impact of world events on the local community,\" and notes its architectural interest as the work of a prominent memorial designer.\nSee also\n* Menin Gate\n* Commonwealth War Graves Commission\n* Remembrance Sunday\nReferences\nExternal links\n*http://www.geograph.org.uk/snippet/8592\n*http://www.hertsatwar.co.uk/potters_bar\n*http://www.hertsburialsandmemorials.org.uk/search.html\n*https://www.warmemorialsonline.org.uk/node/121592"
