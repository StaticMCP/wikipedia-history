Behat was created by Konstantin Kudryashov and its development is hosted on GitHub.\nPurpose\nBehat is intended to aid communication between developers, clients and other stakeholders during a software development process. It allows the clear documentation of testable examples of the software's intended behaviour. Behat test scenarios are written with Gherkin, a business-readable domain-specific language following defined patterns.\nBenefits\nTests can be run at any point new code is introduced into a codebase to confirm no regressions within the existing test coverage are introduced. It can be used to directly test php code and is often used with Selenium to remote control browsers as part of the scenarios. The browsers under remote control can take videos or screenshots of failures.  Using selenium or tools like selenoid a \"grid\" of browsers can be remote controlled for parallel test execution.  There is also a module for running php only scenarios.\nLike other BDD frameworks, Behat scenarios are a series of Given, When, and Then steps that explain a business case. The definition of these steps exist within method annotations of a class that extends the BehatContext.\nBehat can output test results in a number of different formats, including JUnit XML and HTML\nExamples\nThe preconditions after \"Given\" correspond to the PHP method name to execute:\nFeature: Simple description of this feature’s story\nDescribe benefit, role and feature or user story\nUse as many lines as needed\nBackground:\nGiven some step run for all scenarios\nScenario: Scenario or example description\nGiven I setup preconditions with:\n| data column 1 | data column 2 |\n| alice         | bob           |\nWhen I press the \"blue\" button\nThen the result is:\n\"\"\"\nA multiple line\nstring of data\n\"\"\"\n#comments can be added as needed\nScenario Outline: Scenario or example description using setting\nGiven I setup config with \"\"\nWhen I push button \"\"\nThen \"\" happens\nExamples:\n| setting | button | result           |\n| a       | red    | there is a beep  |\n| b       | blue   | there is no beep |\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
