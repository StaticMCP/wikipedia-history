Following Kidston's resignation, Opposition leader Robert Philp was sent for and formed a ministry, but the ministry almost immediately lost a vote of no confidence in the Assembly, and as such, a new election had to be called.\nThis election used contingent voting, at least in the single-member districts.\nFive districts were two-seat districts - Mackay, Marlborough, North Brisbane, Rockhampton and South Brisbane. In the two-member constituencies, plurality block voting was used -- electors could cast two valid votes but were allowed to \"plump\".\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n!
