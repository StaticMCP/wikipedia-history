It presents the history of the Priamar promontory and the town of Savona. On the exposition are old collections of objects from around the Mediterranean and artifacts from the 20th century excavations of the fortress and its surrounding (especially ceramic products of the region). The museum has two floors and inside it is possible to see original excavation pits.\nHistory of the museum\nThe museum was opened on 7 April 1990. Before, the archaeological collection of Savona did not have a permanent seat, being stored in different places and mostly not exposed. The current seat of the museum came to be thanks to numerous seasons of archaeological excavations carried in the Priamar Fortress under the International Institute of Ligurian Studies (Instituto Internazionale di Studi Liguri) directed first by Nino Lamboglia, later by Carlo Varaldo and Rita Lavagna (current director of the museum). The idea of creating a permanent museum in Palazzo della Loggia was born after the temporary exhibition organized in 1979 presenting the results of so far executed excavations.\nThe exposition\nThe museum is located on the ground floor and the first floor of Palazzo della Loggia. On the ground floor it is possible to see objects from old collections, such as mosaic, marble reliefs, glass and ceramics from the Bronze Age and Classical periods. Also on the ground floor located is so called 'archaeological area' where exposed are parts of the original excavations, among them that of the Byzantine necropolis. The visit continues on the first floor where illustrated is the history of the town. Exhibited are numerous examples of imported pottery that testify the intense maritime trade with other cities of the Mediterranean. Also exhibited are local ceramic products of Savona as the town was an important centre of production. The last section of the tour concerns urban development and the town's life before and after the construction of the Genoese fortress.\nGallery\nImage:Fortezza priamar 11.jpg|View on Palazzo della Loggia\nImage:Celtic Burials in Priamar 5th century BCE (Savona - Italy) .jpg|Part of the archaeological excavations showing tombs from 6th and 7th century\nExternal links\n[https://www.museoarcheosavona.it/ Official Website]\nReferences\n*Il Priamar, 1982, Massucco, Ricchebono, Tassinari, Varaldo, Sabatelli Editore, Savona\n*Museo archeologico di Savona al Priamar, 1996, Instituto Internazionale di Studi Liguri, R.
