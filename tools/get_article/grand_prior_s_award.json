The Grand Prior's Award recognises a self-motivated and capable young person's ongoing commitment, compassion, and support. It is recognised and awarded internationally by various branches of the program. The Grand Prior's Award is recognised in many countries, including England and the Islands, Wales, Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Australia.\nEngland and the Islands\nCadets begin to work on the Grand Prior's Award scheme after receiving the Membership award. The award scheme was named for the Grand Prior's of the Order of St John, the Duke of Gloucester. The award scheme involves cadets completing 16 subjects. Four subjects must be completed for the bronze level, four more for silver, and a further four for gold. After completing another four subjects, the cadet will be awarded with the Grand Prior's Award. Cadets can continue to work on this award until they are 21 years old.\nMalaysia\nIn its early years, the scheme had a different subject group (cycling, camping, tracking, etc.) than is used today. These groups were removed and merged to make the scheme that is currently used today. The 26 badges are split into five different groups according to the nature of the activities. These groups are: care, emergency care, leisure, communication, and life and social skills.\nCadets who successfully complete the Grand Prior's Award receive the award from the Order Secretariat in London, England.
