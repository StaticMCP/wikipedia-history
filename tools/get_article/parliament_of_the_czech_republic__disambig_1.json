It meets in Malá Strana, Prague and is composed of 281 total members and Senators.\nIt consists of two chambers, both elected in direct elections:\n* the Upper House: Senate\n* the Lower House: Chamber of Deputies\nArt. 15 of the Constitution stipulates its name as the \"Parliament\". The Parliament exercises competences usual in parliamentary systems: it holds and passes bills, has the right to modify the Constitution, ratifies international agreements; if necessary, it declares war, approves presence of foreign military forces in the Czech Republic or a dispatch of Czech military forces abroad.\nHistory\nSession room of the Chamber of Deputies\nThe tradition of modern parliamentarianism in the Bohemian lands dates back to times of the Austrian Empire (and then Cisleithanian part of Austria-Hungary), where the Imperial Council (Reichsrat, Říšská rada) was created in 1861.\nAfter proclamation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 its National Assembly (Národní shromáždění) undertook legislative duties both of the Imperial Council and State Diets (Bohemian, Moravian, Silesian). In 1938–39 and between 1948–89 there existed a parliament within non-democratic regimes (right-wing authoritarian or Communist regime, respectively). As a consequence of federalization of Czechoslovakia (1968), national councils of Czech and Slovak parts of the country were created.\nThe Chamber of Deputies keeps continuity with the Czech National Council (Česká národní rada), while the Senate was established in 1996 (with reference to the First Czechoslovak Republic one).\nExternal links\n* [https://psp.cz/en/sqw/hp.sqw psp.cz]  (official site)\nNotes\nReferences"
