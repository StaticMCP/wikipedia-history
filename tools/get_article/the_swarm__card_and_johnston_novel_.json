It was released on August 2, 2016.\nPlot\nThe first invasion of Earth was beaten back by a coalition of corporate and international military forces, and the Chinese army, but China has been devastated by the Formics' initial efforts to eradicate Earth life forms and prepare the ground for their own settlement. The Scouring of China struck fear into the other nations of the planet; that fear blossomed into drastic action when scientists determined that the single ship that wreaked such damage was merely a scout ship. Earth's government has been reorganized for defense; it now comprises a Hegemon, a planetary official responsible for keeping all the formerly warring nations in line, and a Polemarch, responsible for organizing all the military forces of the planet into the new International Fleet. But ambition and politics, greed and self-interest remain, as important members of the military continue to place their career prospects ahead of Earth's defense. It is up to Bingwen, Mazer Rackam, Victor Delgado and Lem Jukes to create a weapon that can effectively defend humanity.\nSeries\nThe book is the first of the Second Formic War trilogy by Card and Johnston. The projected titles for the second and third books are The Hive and The Queens respectively. The Hive was released on June 11, 2019.\nSee also\n* List of ''Ender's Game'' characters\n* Orson Scott Card bibliography\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
