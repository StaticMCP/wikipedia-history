His large artillery was placed at the front, followed by the lighter pieces, and then the cavalry and infantry of the vanguard in the rear. As was customary, the Nawab positioned himself in the center of the formation.\nBattle\nIn 1748 A.D, Janoji Bhonsle and Mir Habib enlisted in the army of Afghans at Rani Sarai to fight against Alivardi Khan. The Afghans had also organized their army in the typical manner of that era. However, they cleverly utilized the terrain by implementing a new strategy. Their forces stretched out in a long line of over two miles from Rani Sarai to Kaladiara in the west. The left wing, led by Hayat Khan and equipped with large cannons, extended across a small stream that flowed into the Ganges. They were instructed to target the Nawab Alivardi Khan's right wing when it approached their position. In the distance on the left, the Marathas could be spotted, poised to loot from whichever side.\nDisregarding the Maratha light horse as insignificant and identifying the Afghans as his primary foes, the Nawab Alivardi Khan boldly advanced towards their assembled ranks. The battle commenced with a thunderous exchange of artillery fire, in which Alivardi Khan held a clear advantage due to the Afghans having abandoned many of their heavy guns at a ford four miles to the east the day prior. The initial cannon fire resulted in the death of Sardar Khan, a commander of a significant portion of the rebel force, his demise sending shockwaves through his troops. While Nawab Alivardi Khan's young captains were eager to charge the enemy immediately, the veteran commander urged caution, allowing his musketeers to inflict damage first. The musketeers unleashed volleys upon the densely packed enemy ranks on the sandbank, shrouding the once bright day in smoke.\nObserving the enemy forces faltering, the Nawab Alivardi Khan ordered two officers to launch an attack, but their response was delayed. Seizing this moment of confusion, the Marathas and Mir Habib's Afghans launched an assault on the Nawab's baggage from the rear, advancing towards the center with a throng of servants in tow. Unperturbed by this new threat, the Nawab Alivardi Khan focused on directing his vanguard to confront the main Afghan army head-on, leading the charge from his elephant with his guards and victory music serenading their advance. The generals, eager to prove themselves, urged their elephants into the thick of the enemy's ranks. The battle intensified along the entire front, marked by instances of prominent figures falling in combat and gruesome beheadings as chaos reigned.\nThe Afghan army, now in disarray, broke and retreated, while the Marathas discreetly fled from the battlefield, having played no significant role in the conflict.\nAftermath\nAlivardi Khan's forces seized the deserted enemy camp before marching to Baikunthpur, where they rested briefly before triumphantly entering Patna, where the news of the victory was welcome."
