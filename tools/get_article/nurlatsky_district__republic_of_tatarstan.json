The administrative center of the district is the city of Nurlat. In 2020, the population of the district was 58,290.  Almost half of the district population lives in the district center (at least 33 thousand people).\nThe history of the district is closely connected with the Bulgar period in the Volga region and on the Kama. The city of Nurlat used to have different names: South Nurlat, Nurlat-Oktyabrsky. The Nurlatsky district was called Oktyabrsky from 1930 to 1937.\nThe main natural resource of the region is oil, which is very important for the district's economy. The main economic sectors are oil production, processing industry, and agriculture.\nGeography and climate\nNurlatsky district is a developed socio-economic municipal district with a total area of 2308.9 m2. The district is located in the south of the Republic of Tatarstan, on the territory of the Western Trans-Kama and Samara Trans-Volga regions. The district shares borders with Alkeevsky, Alekseyevsky, Aksubayevsky, Cheremshansky districts of the Republic of Tatarstan, Samara (Koshkinsky and Chelno-Vershinsky districts), and Ulyanovsk regions (Novomalyklinsky district).\nForests cover 41.1% of the area of the Nurlatsky district. The area is a black earth zone and located in the southern part of the forest-steppe zone. There are deposits of oil, bentonite, and expanded clay.\nThe climate of the region is temperate continental, with rather mild winters (average temperature of January is −12&nbsp;°C). Summer has got a stable temperature regime. The seasonal amount of precipitation in the form of rain and hail is 80&nbsp;mm.\nCoat of arms and flag\nThe coat of arms was approved by the decision of the Council of the Nurlat Municipal District on July 15, 2006. There is the figure of a galloping horse and the shining sun as the background on the coat of arms. According to one of the versions, the name of the city of Nurlat is translated from the Tatar language as “shiny horse”. Equestrian sports and horse breeding are also priority areas of the district's socio-economic development. The ears in the red field represent the priority of agriculture. Gold is a symbol of harvest, wealth, stability, respect, intelligence. Red means labor, strength, courage, beauty. Silver is a symbol of purity, perfection, peace, and mutual understanding. Green is a symbol of nature, health, and growth in life. The flag is based on heraldic elements of the coat of arms.\nHistory\nEtymology\nThe name of the district comes from the name of the municipal center Nurlat. The village of Nurlaty has been known since the 17th century. There are mentions of the villages of Verhny Nurlat (Abdulkino Nurlat) and Nizhny Nurlat (Nurlat) of the Samara district of the Simbirsk province in the 18th century. The name from the anthroponym Nur means \"shiny\", and Nurulla means “the light of Allah”.\nBackground\nThe history of the Nurlatsky district begins from the Bulgar times when the Bulgar settlements were founded on this territory, among which the Novoalmetyevskoe and Novoamzinskoe settlements were considered the largest. The defenders of Kazan went to these lands and founded a number of Tatar villages - Burmetyevo, Kurmanaevo, Upper and Lower Nurlat, Savinovo, Stepnoye Lake, Chulpanovo after the siege of the Kazan Khanate by Ivan the Terrible in 1552. There are also known pagan Chuvash settlements: Bilyar-Ozero, Elaur, Egorkino, Vishnevaya Polyana, Starye Chelny, and some others. It is known that in the 16th century, in the lower reaches of the Bolshoi Cheremshan River, separated groups of the Kazan Tatars settled.\nThe area has not been fully explored archaeologically. Data from 1964 to 1968 show the presence of two types of monuments here: burial mounds, located mainly on the watersheds, and Bulgar settlements, confined mainly to the Cheremshan river basin. The archaeological monuments of the Nurlatsky district are located in the settlements of Novoe Almetyevo, Novaya Amzya, Selengushi, Staraya Tatarskaya Amzya, Kulbaeva Marasa, Staroye Tatarskoe Almetyevo, Mikhailovka.\nThe Nurlatsky district was described in the diaries of the natural scientist and traveler in Russia Peter Pallas (1741-1811), which he visited as part of the academic expeditions of 1768-1774.\nCivil War period\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the Nurlat railway station was in the area of hostilities. The Czechoslovak corps, up to 60 thousand White Guards and the reactionary command, raised an anti-Soviet mutiny in 1918. The Belochekhs attacked Simbirsk (Ulyanovsk) and approached Nurlat in July 1918. In early August, Red Army units set fire to the wooden station building but they were forced to retreat. The White Guards sieged the Middle Volga region. Red Army soldiers were brought to the Nurlat station and shot on the territory of a coal warehouse.\nIn August 1918, the Red Army launched an offensive from Simbirsk to Bugulma. Already in early October, Nurlat was released, the remains of the executed were placed in a mass grave. A plywood pyramid with a red star was erected at the burial site in 1922. At the moment, the monument to the victims of the civil war is located near the railway station of the city of Nurlat.\nSoviet period\nThe territory of the region was part of the Chistopolsky district of the Kazan province and the Melekessky district of the Samara province. It belonged to the Chistopol canton of the Tatar ASSR and the Melekessky district of the Samara province from 1920 to 1928. Later from 1928 to 1930, it was included only in the Chistopol canton. In 1930, the territorial reform was completed to abolish the cantons. On August 10 of the same year, the territory was formalized as the newly formed Oktyabrsky District.\nMoscow industrial enterprises were evacuated to the Oktyabrsky District during the Great Patriotic War. According to the decision of the State Defense Committee, the \"Mosmetrostroy\" plant was redesigned for the production of military products and placed in the southern building of the Nurlat railway station. Equipment for the release of Katyusha rocket artillery shells was installed there as well. The plant worked during 1941-1945.\nJoseph Stalin three times noted in telegrams the contribution and military feat of the residents of the district: “Give my fraternal greetings and gratitude of the Red Army to the collective farmers of the Oktyabrsky District who collected 2,538,000 rubles for the construction of the \"Kolkhoznik Tataria\" column, who donated 12,566 poods of grain to the fund of the Red Army, 4,000 poods for industrial workers\".\nThe territory of the district has changed several times. The greater part of the abolished Telmansky district became part of the Oktyabrsky district on July 16, 1958. The borders of the district also underwent significant changes. Part of the territory of the Alkeevsky district, together with the village of Novaya Tumba, was transferred to the Oktyabrsky district on August 19, 1987.\nA powerful impetus to the development of the district was given by the development of oil fields, which were found in the 1980s. This helped to strengthen the oil and gas industry in the next decade. Oktyabrsky district was renamed Nurlatsky on December 10, 1997.\nContemporary Nurlatsky District\nAfter the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Tatarstan made an attempt to secede from Russia and gain independence. In 1992, a referendum was held, following which Tatarstan proclaimed state sovereignty. However, the region decided to remain a part of Russia as a sovereign republic. At the same time, Tatarstan began to pursue an independent socio-economic policy, the districts within the republic received greater independence.\nIn 1996-2007, the Nurlatsky district was headed by Fatih Sibagatullin, in 2008-2013 by Nail Sharapov. From September 2018 to the present, the head of the Nurlatsky municipal district and the city of Nurlat is Almaz Salimovich Akhmetshin.\nPopulation\nAccording to the 2010 All-Russian Population Census, the region is populated by 3 big national groups.
