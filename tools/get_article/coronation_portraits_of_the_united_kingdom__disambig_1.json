These are usually large full-length paintings, which show the monarch surrounded by a crown, orb and sceptre. The earliest example of such portraits in the Royal Collection is that of James VI and I by Paul van Somer. Similar portraits have also been commissioned for consorts that have been crowned alongside the monarchs. The most recent coronation state portraits are those of Charles III and Camilla, which were unveiled in 2025. All paintings are in the medium of oil on canvas.\nMonarchs\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\"\n|-\n! Subject!! Portrait !! Artist!! Year unveiled !! Dimensions !!  !!

However, Thomas Lawrence, George's chosen artist, had already made two other portraits of her: Caroline, Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte (1801) and Princess Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1804).\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n* Plowden, Alison (2005).
