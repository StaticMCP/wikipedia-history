Sullivan Courthouse\nEdward J. Sullivan (1921 – July 24, 2007) was clerk of courts for Middlesex County, Massachusetts and mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Edward's brother, Walter J. Sullivan also served as Mayor of Cambridge, as did his nephew, Michael. As clerk of courts, he instituted the one-day–one-case jury system.  He was succeeded as clerk of courts by his nephew, Michael A. Sullivan, after holding the position for 48 years. The former Middlesex Superior Court building was named the Edward J. Sullivan Courthouse in his honor.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cambridgema.gov/fiscalaffairs/PropertyDetail.cfm?PropertyId=761 The City of Cambridge Assessors website: The Edward J.
