Elements of the French ''Armée de l'Est'' under General Bourbaki engaged August von Werder's German forces. It resulted in a French victory.\nBackground\nIn the turmoil and confusion following the capitulations at Sedan and Metz and the continued besiegement of Paris, the remaining French armies faced major supply difficulties which restricted their movements. The ''Armée de l'Est'' was tasked with reaching and assisting Belfort, where Colonel Denfert-Rochereau still held out.\nBattle\nWerder's XIV Corps caught up to Bourbaki in the evening of 9 January at Villersexel, where a French detachment had taken positions the evening before. Prussian troops, filing through an unguarded pass, rapidly overwhelmed the positions surrounding the bridge over the Ognon. By 13:00h the château fell to the Prussians. However, the French lines at Esprels, Autrey-le-Vay, and, to the east, Villers-la-Ville, successfully checked the Prussian attack.\nAround noon Werder ordered two brigades of the Baden Field Division, which were marching towards Athesans, to reinforce the Prussians at Villersexel. Arriving late, they would only be lightly engaged during the battle. A French counterattack organized by Bourbaki pressed steadily forth in the afternoon and recaptured the château after confused street fighting. Fighting continued into the night until the retreat of the Prussians at 03:00h. Bourbaki continued his march on 13 January, while Werder fell back some 20 kilometers north along the Lisaine.\nResults of the battle\nThough the French sustained heavier losses they managed to drive the Prussian armies from their barricades.\nThe Chateau des Villersexel, then known as Château des Grammont, was destroyed during the battle.  The Château was later rebuilt. The village, also burned, was particularly affected in its lower part to Ognon.\nImage:Battle of Villersexel area map.jpg|A map of the area around Villersexel at the time of the battle\nImage:Bataille de Villersexel - 07.jpg|View of destruction to the village\nImage:Bataille de Villersexel - 05.jpg|Artillery placements at the ruins of the Château\nImage:Bataille de Villersexel - 06.jpg|View of destruction in the lower portion of the village\nFootnotes\nReferences\n* Colonel Rousset, Histoire générale de la Guerre franco-allemande, Vol. 2, édition Jules Tallandier, Paris, 1911.\n* Général Pierre Bertin, \" 1870-1871 Désillusions dans l'Est\" Cêtre Besançon Editions, 2007."
