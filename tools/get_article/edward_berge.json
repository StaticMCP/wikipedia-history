      "text": "# Edward Berge\n\nEdward Henry Berge (1876–1924) was an American sculptor. He is mainly known for his bronze monumental works and figures, created in the traditional manner in contrast with the avant-garde work of his contemporaries.\nBerge was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1876. He studied at the Maryland Institute (currently known as the Maryland Institute College of Art or MICA) and was part of the first class of the Rinehart School of Sculpture, which comprised three boys and four girls. The other two boys were J. Maxwell Miller and Hans Schuler. Upon completion of Rinehart School study, the three went together to Paris where they enrolled in the Académie Julian for three years and studied under Raoul Verlet and Auguste Rodin.  Berge was a member of the National Sculpture Society and the National Arts Club.\nAt 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, October 12, 1924, Berge suffered a heart attack while working alone in his studio on his latest piece. His nephew was contacted, who in turn summoned Berge's physician. The physician recommended that Berge be taken home to rest. At approximately 3:30 p.m., Berge experienced a second heart attack and died alone during the brief period his wife had left to obtain medication. Although he had received treatment for indigestion in the preceding months, Berge was believed to have been in good health. He was 48 years old.\nHis son, Henry Berge (1908–1998) was also a sculptor and focused on bas-relief.\n__NOTOC__\nSculpture\nBerge mainly worked in marble and bronze and completed many monuments, portrait busts and relief sculptures, many of which are on display outdoors or in public buildings in Baltimore City, including:\n* Armistead, Fort McHenry.\n* Chapin A.
