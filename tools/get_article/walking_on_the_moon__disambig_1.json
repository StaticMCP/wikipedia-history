The song was written by the band's lead vocalist and bassist Sting. It went on to become the band's second  hit in the UK.\nBackground\nSting has said that he wrote the song when he was drunk one night after a concert in Munich. The following morning, he remembered the song and wrote it down.\nIn his autobiography, Sting implies that the song was partially inspired by an early girlfriend:\nAccording to Sting, the song was originally recorded \"as a rocker\" in early versions, but it was reworked. The riff, which is played on the bass, was described as \"weird\" and \"jazzy\" by Sting. Guitarist Andy Summers came up with the chord \"which hits after the bass notes\" throughout the song.\n\"Walking on the Moon\" was released as the follow-up single to the British  single \"Message in a Bottle\" in late 1979. The song was the Police's second number-one hit single in the United Kingdom. It also reached  in Ireland and  in Australia but did not chart in the United States.\nThe B-side to the song, \"Visions of the Night\", was written by Sting. He said of the song, \"This was the first song I wrote after going to London. It was hard to be serious about the whole thing. I was bemused, much to Stewart [Copeland]'s disgust.\" According to Copeland, the song was \"too cerebral for [the band's] early audiences,\" so Sting would call it \"Three O'Clock Shit\", the title of a rejected Police song that appears as \"Three O'Clock Shot\" on Strontium 90: Police Academy.\nComposition\n\"Walking on the Moon\" has a \"sparse\" arrangement, centred around a three-note bass riff. It is one of the Police's more reggae-influenced songs.\nPersonnel\n* Sting – vocals, bass guitar\n* Andy Summers – guitar, guitar synthesiser\n* Stewart Copeland – drums\nMusic video\nThe video was shot at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on October 23, 1979. It features the band miming to the track amidst spacecraft displays, interspersed with NASA footage. Sting plays a guitar rather than a bass, while Stewart Copeland strikes his drumsticks on a Saturn V moon rocket. The video was directed by Derek Burbidge.\nTrack listing\n;7\" A&M / AMS 7494 (UK)\n# \"Walking on the Moon\" (Edit) – 3:59 (This edit has never been officially released on CD.)\n# \"Visions of the Night\" – 3:05\n;12\" A&M / AMSP 7494 (UK)\n# \"Walking on the Moon\" – 4:59\n# \"Visions of the Night\" – 3:05\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for \"Walking on the Moon\"\n|-\n!
