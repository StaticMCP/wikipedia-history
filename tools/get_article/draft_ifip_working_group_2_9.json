In 1993, Kevin Ryan (Emeritus) was among the first to recognize the future potential of natural language processing to reduce the manual effort of documenting and analyzing requirements. and Axel van Lamsweerde (Emeritus), in collaboration with Anne Dardenne and Stephen Fickas (Emeritus), introduced a method for modeling early requirements, called goals.\nSeveral members of the IFIP WG 2.9 have received a Most Influental Paper Award, which is a retrospective award recoginizing the 10-year impact of research on the fields of software and requirements engineering, including: Sol Greenspan and John Mylopolous (1994), Jeff Kramer and Bashar Nuseibeh (2003), Stephen Fickas (2005), Annie Antón (2006)\nEach year, the IFIP WG 2.9 meets to engage the membership and invited guests in the discussion of unpublished research. New members are inducted by vote of the membership after they have attended three meetings as guests. After attending five meetings as members, members may self-elect to enter Emerit status.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of IFIP WG 2.9 is to develop a better understanding of:\n* The elicitation, specification, analysis and management of the requirements for large and complex software intensive systems;\n* The interpretation and documentation of those requirements in such a way as to permit the developer to construct a system which will satisfy them.\nRequirements engineering has received significant attention in software development design education.\nScope\nThe Scope of IFIP WG 2.9 includes all aspects of requirements engineering. Some examples of areas of special interest are:\n* Formal representation schemes and requirements modelling;\n* Descriptions of the requirements engineering process;\n* Tools and environments to support requirements engineering;\n* Requirements engineering methods;\n* Requirements analysis and validation;\n* Requirements elicitation, acquisition and formalisation;\n* Methods and tools for verification of an implementation’s compliance with requirements;\n* Reuse and adaptation of requirements;\n* Domain modelling and analysis;\n* Requirements engineering for distributed, safety-critical, composite, real-time and embedded systems.\nOrganization\n* [https://computing-research.open.ac.uk/people/andrea-zisman/ Andrea Zisman], Chair, Open University, UK\n* [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~breaux Travis Breaux], Vice Chair, Carnegie Mellon University, USA\n* [https://people.ucd.ie/liliana.pasquale Liliana Pasquale], Secretary, University College Dublin, Ireland\nMembers\n* [https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~da04/ Dalal Alrajeh], Imperial College, UK\n* [https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jmatlee/ Jo Atlee], University of Waterloo, Canada\n* [https://profiles.open.ac.uk/amel-bennaceur Amel Bennaceur], Open University, UK\n* [https://www.lbriand.info/ Lionel Briande], University of Ottawa, Canada\n* [https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/24922-marsha-chechik Marsha Chechik], University of Toronto, Canada\n* [https://cse.msu.edu/~chengb/ Betty HC Cheng], Michigan State University, USA\n* [https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/jane-cleland-huang/ Jane Cleland-Huang], University of Notre Dame, USA\n* [https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/profile/k2czarne Krzysztof Czarnecki], University of Waterloo, Canada\n* [https://www.danieladamian.ca/ Daniela Damien], University of Victoria, BC, Canada\n* Vincenzo Gervasi, University of Pisa, Italy\n* [https://cse.umn.edu/cs/mats-heimdahl Matts Heimdahl], University of Minnesota, USA\n* Julio Cesar Leite, Federal University of Bahia, Brazil\n* [https://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/robyn-lutz Robyn Lutz], Iowa State University, USA\n* [https://profiles.open.ac.uk/bashar-nuseibeh Bashar Nuseibeh], Open University, UK\n* [https://sse.uni-due.de/en/about-us/team/klaus-pohl Klaus Pohl], University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany\n* [https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.uchitel Sebastian Uchitel], Imperial College, UK\n* Michael Whalen, Amazon, USA\n* [https://people.csiro.au/w/j/jon-whittle John Whittle], CSIRO, Australia\nEmertius\n* Annie Antón, USA\n* Dan Berry, Canada\n* Stephen Fickas, USA\n* Carlo Ghezzi, Italy\n* Sol Greenspan, USA\n* Robert Hall, USA\n* Jeff Kramer, UK\n* Axel van Lamsweerde, Belgium\n* John_Mylopoulos, Canada\n* William Robinson, USA\n* Kevin Ryan, Ireland\nReferences"
