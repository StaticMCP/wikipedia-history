The station is regarded as the first British black music radio station. Both Miss P and Lepke are the younger siblings of Bob Marley's wife Rita Marley.\nIn 1983, Miss P was approached by BBC Television to compose and perform visual promotional trails and the theme song for its weekly magazine programme Ebony.\nOn 31 March 1985, she began presenting a weekly reggae show Culture Rock on BBC Radio 1 on Sunday nights. This was Radio 1's first ever show dedicated solely to reggae music, and Miss P was one of the station's first black presenters. Her entire show on 12 May 1985 was a tribute to the life and music of Bob Marley.\nShe left BBC Radio 1 in 1990 and went on to present a programme titled Riddim and Blues on BBC Radio London on Saturday nights, in which she played a wide variety of black music.\nMiss P has two sons and a daughter.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/05/04/miss_p_person_profile.shtml Archived BBC page]\n*"
