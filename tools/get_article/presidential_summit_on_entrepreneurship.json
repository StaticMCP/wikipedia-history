During recent months, the State Department coordinated with outside organizations on these related but independent events.\nEvents during the week of the Summit on Entrepreneurship included:\n* Roundtable discussions hosted by the Acumen Fund, Endeavor, the Brookings Institution, and the World Congress of Muslim Philanthropists;\n* Conferences hosted by the Middle East Center on International Cooperation, Vital Voices, the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy, and the International Council for Small Business;\n* Receptions hosted by the Kauffman Foundation and Businesses for Diplomatic Action / Entrepreneurs' Organization;\n* Public Diplomacy Luncheon and Professional Networking events hosted by Al-Mubadarah: Arab Empowerment Initiative in collaboration with Aspen Institute's Global Initiative on Culture and Society and\n* Video screenings of Ten9Eight at the Library of Congress and Garbage Dreams at the World Bank.\n* The Global Technology Forum 2010, hosted by TechWadi, focused on building bridges between the US and MENA to accelerate entrepreneurship.\nIn addition, the US Government hosted special events for delegates, including briefings on business development by the US Small Business Administration, an economic support roundtable at the US Trade and Development Agency, and a reception hosted by the State Department for delegates with the Ambassadors to the United States from delegates’ home countries.\nThe US Government released an interactive Google map with detailed information on each of these events, which was embedded on several websites.\nFollow-on conferences\nSeveral overseas institutions and partners expressed interest in hosting Follow-on Conferences to continue to advance the mission of the Entrepreneurship Summit beyond the April 26 and 27 Presidential Summit in Washington. These Follow-on Conferences would be locally or regionally focused and would focus on a specific element of advancing entrepreneurship (e.g. youth entrepreneurship, access to capital, etc.) We have told these partners that we want to be supportive of these events and acknowledge them at the Summit. We have said that we would attempt to have an appropriate USG official attend, but that we would not play any role in organizing them and would not expect to provide any funding assistance.\nThese Conferences have been initiated by partners who are heeding the President's call to shared action and responsibility. Through their initiative, they will help to advance what the United States and its partners on the Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship have started. We have received Statements of Intent for the following Follow-on Conferences:\n* UAE/Abu Dhabi: The Aspen Institute and the government of the UAE will host a Conference in Abu Dhabi in June 2010 on Innovation.\n* Iraq: The American University of Iraq-Sulaimani will host a conference on Social Entrepreneurship in Sulaimani, Iraq in Spring 2011.\n* Algeria: The U.S.-Algerian Business Council will host a Conference in Algeria on entrepreneurship in the Maghreb in September 2010.\n* Bahrain: The government of Bahrain will host a Conference on innovation, investment and entrepreneurship in December 2010.\n* France: The French-American Foundation has committed to host a Conference on youth entrepreneurship in disadvantaged communities late in 2010 or early in 2011.\n* Kyrgyzstan: The American University of Central Asia, with some Department of State support, will host a Conference on Women Entrepreneurship in Bishkek in May 2010.\n* UAE/Dubai: The Legatum Institute at MIT and the Dubai School of Government hosted a Conference in Dubai on “Best Practices in Entrepreneurship Policy” in November 2010.\nPrime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan sent a letter to Obama with Deulcom International's CEO Baybars Altuntaş during the summit, proposing to hold the next Entrepreneurship Summit in Istanbul. During his remarks, President Obama embraced the proposal and stated that \"Together, we’ve sparked a new era of entrepreneurship -- with events all over Washington this week, and upcoming regional conferences around the world. Tonight, I am pleased to announce that Prime Minister Erdogan has agreed to host the next Entrepreneurship Summit next year in Turkey. And so I thank the Prime Minister and the people and private sector leaders of Turkey for helping to sustain the momentum that we will unleash this week.\"\nNotes and references"
