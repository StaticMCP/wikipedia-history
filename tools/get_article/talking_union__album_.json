It is a collection of union songs and ballads, written by many different labor songwriters over the years. The liner notes include an introduction by Pete Seeger and song explanations by Philip Foner. In 2010, it was selected by the Library of Congress as an addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nIn 1955, the album was rereleased on Folkways Records as The Original Talking Union & Other Union Songs, expanded with seven songs recorded in 1955 by Pete Seeger and a chorus dubbed \"the Song Swappers\" that included Erik Darling, later of The Weavers, and Mary Travers, later of Peter, Paul and Mary.\nTrack listing\nReferences"
