In the game, players control a variety of Marvel superheroes who must battle hordes of enemies in locations ranging from New York City to the Negative Zone to thwart the villain Annihilus' cosmic invasion. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes, allowing players to team up with three other players in cooperative gameplay. Each player has to select two characters, and they can switch between the two characters anytime during combat. Each hero has their distinct movement and combat abilities, though each has a primary, hero-specific attack, a regular melee attack, a defend mechanic (either a block or a dodge), and a screen-clearing special move that consumes \"focus\", gained through landing hits on enemies.
