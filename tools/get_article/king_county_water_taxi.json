It operates two routes between Downtown Seattle and West Seattle or Vashon Island.\nHistory\nEarly ferries of Puget Sound\nWest Seattle is the oldest neighborhood and the birthplace of the city of Seattle. It is surrounded on three sides by water and has both enjoyed and suffered its isolation from the \"mainland\" of downtown Seattle.\nBetween 1850 and 1930, hundreds of small, steam-powered ferries called the Mosquito Fleet  carried travelers to and from numerous islands and peninsulas in the Puget Sound area, including West Seattle and Vashon Island.\nThe first licensed ferry in the Seattle area launched on December 24, 1888, traveled from Seacrest Park in West Seattle to downtown Seattle, as well as other water-bound location throughout the Puget Sound. It was a steam-powered sidewheel ship named the City of Seattle and made two trips a day, carrying West Seattle homesteaders east to the city, and weekend vacationers west to the beachfront. The King County government operated ferries to Vashon Island and West Seattle from Downtown Seattle from 1917 to 1922. The entire fleet was then leased to John L. Anderson. The West Seattle service was discontinued when the first bridge across the Duwamish River was built.\nOver on Vashon Island, the passenger-only ferries were discontinued as the Mosquito Fleet faced increasing competition from the diesel-powered auto ferries. Vashon Island residents could now drive their vehicles onto a ferry to the Fauntleroy terminal in West Seattle.\nOver time, a succession of bridges was installed to connect the West Seattle peninsula to downtown proper, beginning with the old wood-and-rail Spokane Street bridge in 1920. In 1970, calls for a modern solution brought attention to the growing problem of commuting to downtown; in 1978, the freighter ship Chavez crashed into the lower bridge spurring the city to build the high-level West Seattle Bridge and the low-level Spokane Street Bridge that are still the primary paths into and out of peninsula today. As West Seattle has grown in popularity, travel in and out of the peninsula has become more congested.\nElliott Bay Water Taxi\nThe Elliott Bay Water Taxi started service in 1997 as a pilot project to give commuters an alternative to the congested West Seattle Bridge and Highway 99. The Water Taxi was operated by King County and only ran between April and October. King County leased the M/V Admiral Pete from Kitsap Harbor Tours (via Argosy Cruises) and later the M/V Sightseer from Argosy Cruises to operate the service. The vessel was only capable of traveling 8 knots, but the slow speeds proved popular with both commuters and tourists. The ferry quickly became a popular tourist attraction due to the view of the Seattle skyline as the vessel crosses Elliott Bay, the short walk to Alki Beach and the restaurants in West Seattle.\nVashon passenger-only ferry\nThe passenger-only ferry service between Vashon Island and Downtown Seattle started as a service of the Washington State Ferries in the early 1990s. The ferries proved popular with commuters as they offered a much faster connection to downtown Seattle than the alternative of taking the auto ferry to Fauntleroy and driving or taking transit to downtown. In 2006, the state legislature ordered Washington State Ferries to discontinue all passenger-only ferry services, but simultaneously enabled local authorities to form Ferry Districts with tax-collecting authority. The last run operated by the Washington State Ferries vessels came in September 2009.\nKing County Ferry District\nIn April 2007 the county formed the special-purpose King County Ferry District to take over operations of both the West Seattle and Vashon Island passenger-only ferries. The district is funded through a property tax levied on all property in the county. The ferry district took over operation of the West Seattle/Downtown Seattle route from King County on April 27, 2008.\nIn April 2009, the West Seattle route was renamed from the Elliott Bay Water Taxi to the King County Water Taxi. Later that year, on September 28, 2009, the Vashon Island/Downtown Seattle route was transferred from Washington State Ferries and became the second King County Water Taxi Route. King County Ferry District leased the catamaran  from Four Seasons Marine Services to operate the Vashon Island route. In addition to being more stable, the catamaran was also faster than the ships operated by the Washington State Ferries reducing travel time from 30 to 22 minutes.\nIn April 2010, the West Seattle route began operating year-round service from a newly rebuilt dock at Seacrest Park that allowed for wheelchair access. At the same time the West Seattle route started operating with the catamaran  (a sister ship of the Melissa Ann), also leased from Four Seasons Marine Services. The leased Sightseer was returned to Argosy Cruises.\nIn March 2013, the District added a third vessel to its fleet by acquiring the  that had been previously used on the failed SoundRunner ferry between Kingston and Downtown Seattle. The Spirit of Kingston is the first vessel to be owned by the ferry district. It was assigned to the West Seattle route where its smaller size, and more efficient engines proved a better fit than the Rachel Marie. The new vessel allowed the Rachel Marie to serve as a backup, saving the district on rental and lease expenses.\nIn 2014, the district received federal grants that allowed it to purchase two ships specifically designed for the needs of the King County Water Taxi.\nKing County Department of Transportation\nIn late 2014 the King County Council (made up of the same members as the King County Ferry District) voted to assume governance of the King County Ferry District. The consolidation of the district into county government saves money by eliminating redundant functions.\nAs of January 1, 2015, the King County Ferry District ceased to exist, and the King County Water Taxi became a service of the Marine Division of the King County Department of Transportation.\nDecember 2014 saw the arrival of the first new vessel for the King County Water Taxi, the . After undergoing tests, the new ferry was placed into service on the Vashon Island/Downtown Seattle route on April 8, 2015. The addition of the Sally Fox to the fleet allowed the leased Rachel Marie to be returned to Four Seasons Marine Services in December 2014.\nThe second new vessel, the  was delivered in October 2015 and after modifications were made to the dock at Seacrest Park, the new ship began service on the West Seattle/Downtown Seattle route on January 7, 2016. The arrival of the Doc Maynard allowed the Spirit of Kingston to become the backup ship for King County and allowed the leased Melissa Ann to be returned to Four Seasons Marine Services in November 2015.\nA new passenger ferry terminal at Colman Dock opened on August 13, 2019, to serve the King County Water Taxi and Kitsap Fast Ferries at Pier 50. For two years, passenger ferries were diverted to a temporary terminal to the north at Pier 52 while the old dock was demolished.\nOn January 1, 2019, King County Department of Transportation was dissolved and the Metro Transit Division became its own department, King County Metro Transit Department. The Marine Division is now part of the Metro Transit Department.\nOn November 2, 2023, the captain and crew of the Doc Maynard spotted a runaway container ship that was floating adrift towards the Seattle Aquarium. They used the ferry to push the barge away from the waterfront, taking no damage and only falling 15 minutes behind in taxi operations. The captain and crew were later honored by the King County Council and Seattle Kraken.\nRoutes\nWest Seattle–Seattle\nThe West Seattle–Seattle route crosses Elliott Bay between Pier 50 on the downtown Seattle waterfront and Seacrest Park in West Seattle. The ferry's crossing time is approximately ten minutes during weekday commute hours and approximately 15 minutes at all other times. , the primary ferry for the route is the .\nThe ferry operates year-round, and carried an average of 1,742 passengers during the commute hours in December 2014. Prior to 2021, the route only operated during peak commuter times on weekdays with limited seasonal service on weekends. In September 2021, due to construction on the West Seattle High Bridge, service was expanded to include midday sailings as part of a pilot program. The program continued in 2022 and was made permanent on October 16, 2023, alongside year-round weekend service.\nKing County Metro operates two shuttle bus routes that take passengers to and from the dock at Seacrest Park. Route 773 connects to the West Seattle Junction and route 775 connects to the Admiral District and Alki Beach.\nVashon Island–Seattle\nThe Vashon Island–Seattle route operates commuter service between Pier 50 on the downtown Seattle waterfront and Vashon Island. There are ten sailings in either direction every weekday, with most during the morning and evening peak periods. Each crossing takes approximately 22 minutes. The primary ferry for the route is , which carries an average of 400 passengers per day in each direction and was named for a Vashon activist. In 2023, the Vashon route carried 85,040 total passengers—an average of 341 per weekday.\nThe Vashon Island Ferry Terminal is also served by Washington State Ferries routes to Southworth in Kitsap County and the Fauntleroy terminal in West Seattle. Connecting services include King County Metro bus routes 118 and 119, which traverse Vashon and Maury islands. The route initially was peak-only with 12 round trips, but gained four mid-day rounds trips in 2024 with funding from the state legislature's supplemental transportation budget to compensate for reduced two-boat service on the Southworth–Vashon–Fauntleory ferry.\nFares\nAs of September 1, 2022, the one-way fares for the King County Water Taxi are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Fare type !!
