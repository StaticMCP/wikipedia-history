      "text": "# Kings Trough\n\nKings Trough (sometimes spelled '''King's Trough''') is an undersea trough in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is located on the east side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, northwest of the Açores-Biscay Rise and roughly  north-northeast of the Azores. It is approximately  long, running in a northwest–southeast direction. To the east it branches into the Peake Deep and Freen Deep. The center depth is . Surrounding the trough are high ridges and seamounts, such as the Antialtair Seamount and the Crumb Seamount complex. Various explanations for the complex have been suggested, ranging from compression, a former plate boundary, transform faulting or even an oblique meteor impact.\nThe trough, being in an apparently geologically stable region, has been studied as a possible location for radioactive waste disposal.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Kings trough\n\n#REDIRECT Kings Trough"
