After World War II, B 3000 production continued from July 1948 to 1950. There was also an electric version named Borgward BE3000.\nEinheits-Lkw 3 t\nBorgward started building trucks in 1937, supplying vehicles of up to five tons of payload until the start of the Second World War in 1939, including the 3-ton Borgward G.&nbsp;W. truck, available with petrol or Diesel engine.\nA large contingent of these trucks was requisitioned by the Wehrmacht. Initially, production of the regular truck range continued. In 1940, the German truck manufacturers were directed to curtail the number of different models in order to focus on the production of simplified 'standard' trucks with a payload of around three tons.\nAs of 1942, production of the successor commenced. This new \"Einheits-LKW\" (\"standard truck\") was a 3-ton truck with the official designation Borgward B 3000 S/O (with a 3.7 litre, 78&nbsp;hp petrol engine) or Borgward B 3000 S/D respectively (with a  5-litre, 75&nbsp;hp Diesel engine, both with six cylinders). To save raw materials, the trucks were later simplified even further by measures like dropping the diamond-shaped Borgward badge on the grille or replacing the steel cabin with a standard wooden truck cabin (\"Einheitsführerhaus\").\nThe B 3000 was an adequate vehicle, but the lighter Opel 'Blitz' V 3000 proved superior.\nProduction volume\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Production\n|-\n!

Plans to recommence production in order to build the Opel Blitz in Bremen could not be implemented when Bremen was conquered by British troops in 1945.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Reinhard Frank: Lastkraftwagen der Wehrmacht.
