In 1872, Cazalet purchased the estate of Fairlawne at Shipbourne in Kent; he also owned Villa Liserb at Cimiez in the south of France, which was often visited by Queen Victoria, who became godmother to his grandson, Victor Cazalet, born 1896.\nCazalet died of typhus at the Hôtel d'Angleterre, Constantinople, on 21 April 1883, and was survived by his wife.
