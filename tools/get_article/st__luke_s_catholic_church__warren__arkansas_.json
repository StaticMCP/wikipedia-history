Pine in Warren, Arkansas. It is attended from Holy Redeemer Church in El Dorado, in the Diocese of Little Rock.\nThe historic structure was built in 1907, following a simple L-shaped plan with Gothic Revival styling. The exterior is concrete blocks that have been treated to look like ashlar stone. It was originally built for the Episcopal Diocese of Arkansas and called St. Mary's Church, but it never had a large congregation, and services ended in the late 1920s. It was vacant until its purchase in 1948 by the Catholic Church, which named it St. Luke's.\nThe church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Bradley County, Arkansas\nReferences"
