The high commission was withdrawn on 12 November 1965, following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence of Rhodesia the previous day. Zimbabwe became an independent nation in 1980 following the Lancaster House Agreement on 21 December 1979. Initially, Zimbabwe was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations so the UK's diplomatic representatives were high commissioners. Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth in 2003 and since then the UK's representatives have been ambassadors.\nEmmerson Mnagagwa, the president of Zimbabwe has stated that Zimbabwe will seek a return to its membership of the Commonwealth during 2018, following in the footsteps of The Gambia, which returned to its status as a republic in the Commonwealth of Nations on 8 February 2018. If this does occur, then the UK's head of mission in Zimbabwe will again be a high commissioner.\nList of heads of mission\nHigh commissioners\nFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland\n*1955–1961: Maurice Rupert Metcalf\n*1961–1963: Lord Alport\n*1963–1963: John Baines Johnston\nSouthern Rhodesia\n*1963–1965: John Baines Johnston\nZimbabwe\n*1980–1983: Robin Byatt\n*1983–1985: Sir Martin Ewans\n*1985–1989: Sir Ramsay Melhuish\n*1989–1992: Sir Keiran Prendergast\n*1992–1995: Sir Richard Dales\n*1995–1998: Martin Williams\n*1998–2001: Peter Longworth\n*2001–2003: Sir Brian Donnelly\nAmbassadors to Zimbabwe\n*2003–2004: Sir Brian Donnelly\n*2004–2006: Roderick Pullen\n*2006–2009: Andrew Pocock\n*2009–2011: Mark Canning\n*2011–2014: Deborah Bronnert\n*2014–2018: Catriona Laing\n*2019–2023: Melanie Robinson\n*2023–present: Peter Vowles\nControversy\nAmbassador Pocock, along with other foreign diplomats, was seized and threatened by Zimbabwe police briefly on 13 May 2008 while they tried to investigate violence against Zimbabwe's rural population since the March 2008 elections.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gov.uk/government/world/zimbabwe UK and Zimbabwe], gov.uk"
