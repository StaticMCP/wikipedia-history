      "text": "# Rat Queens\n\nRat Queens is an American fantasy comic book series created by Kurtis J. Wiebe and Roc Upchurch, published by Image Comics. The series was written by Wiebe until Ryan Ferrier took over in mid 2019. The original 2013–2016 run was drawn by Roc Upchurch, Stjepan Šejić, and Tess Fowler. The series was put on hiatus in April 2016 and returned in March 2017 with the new artist Owen Gieni. Currently, Moritat & Casey Silver are the ongoing artists.\nRecounting the exploits of a party of four rowdy, foul-mouthed adventurers, the series has received critical praise, was nominated for the 2014 Eisner Award for Best New Series and won the 2015 GLAAD Media Award.\nPublication history\nWriter Kurtis Wiebe described the series as a \"love letter to my years of D&D (...) and fantasy\" with a modern twist, and the concept as \"Lord of the Rings meets Bridesmaids\". Originally intended to be funded through Kickstarter, it was picked up by Jim Valentino at Image Comics a week before the funding campaign was to start. Rat Queens was intended to be published at a pace of ten issues per year, with two-month breaks between collections.\nArtist Roc Upchurch left the book after issue #8 and Image Comics announced that Stjepan Šejić would continue the series as artist beginning with issue #9 in February 2015, preceded by a special issue about the orc warrior Braga by guest artist Tess Fowler in January 2015. After Šejić left the series in July 2015 for health reasons, Fowler continued the series as main artist, joined by colorist Tamra Bonvillain.\nIn April 2016, Fowler left the title, and Wiebe paused work on it. In May 2016, Fowler wrote that Wiebe pushed her out to make room for Upchurch's return after the fourth arc. Wiebe denied this and said that the collaboration not working out creatively was the reason for Fowler's departure and the comic's hiatus.\nIn July 2016, Wiebe announced that Rat Queens would continue as a webcomic. Early strips in this format would be drawn by Battlepug creators Mike Norton and Cecilia Dupuy.\nIn November 2016, Wiebe announced that Rat Queens would return to print with a new series artist, Owen Gieni.\nOn Reddit, Wiebe clarified that issue #16 (When Beards Collide, Part 1) would not be considered canon following the reboot. Apparently he found it too difficult to wrap that arc up and put the series back on track. He later found a way to reference #16 while writing #9 of the reboot series, but reiterated that #16 will not be collected. The reference is an Easter egg for those that read #16.\nWiebe and Gieni ended their work as the series' writer and artist in March 2019, with issue #15.[https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/03/13/rat-queens-15-brings-an-end-to-an-era-of-fantasy-comics/ Rat Queens #15 Brings an End to an Era of Fantasy Comics] A new creative team of Ryan Ferrier (writer), Priscilla Petraites (artist), and Marco Lesko (colorist) resumed work on the series in June 2019.\nThe storyline The God Dilemma ended the regular serialization of the series, but original creators Wiebe and Upchurch have announced they will be producing a graphic novel finale for the series tying up all remaining loose ends, giving the characters a true final send-off. This finale, titled Rat Queens: Sisters, Warriors, Queens was published in late September 2023, with Upchurch returning as its artist.\nPlot\nThe eponymous \"Rat Queens\" are a rambunctious party of adventurers in a medieval fantasy setting. They comprise the rockabilly elven mage Hannah, the hipster dwarven warrior Violet who shaved her beard before it became cool, the atheist human cleric Dee, who hails from a family of Lovecraftian monster cultists, and the hippie halfling (here called \"smidgen\") thief Betty, whose idea of a hearty meal is a bag of drugs and candy. They were later joined by Braga, a transgender Orc warrior.\nThe first five issues follow the group's exploits as they try to defend themselves against assassins intent on killing them and other adventuring groups that have been roughing up their home town of Palisade. The second story arc sees the Rat Queens trying to prevent a vengeful businessman from summoning Dee's people's many-tentacled gods to lay waste to Palisade. The third arc has Hannah return to her sinister alma mater after her father is arrested for attempting a coup.\nCharacters\n;Hannah Vizari\n:A black-haired Elven necromancer who made a pact with a demon named Hazirel and was cursed by the demonic Necrius magic he bestowed upon her, which among other things made her grow horns, which she tries to hide under her haircurls. Later, the corruption causes her to be split into a good and evil half.\n;Violet (\"Vi\") Blackforge\n:A redhaired Dwarven fighter of the Blackforge Clan who became tired of her father's adherence to old-fashioned traditions, which disallowed Dwarven females from becoming warriors even though Violet had the talent. After beating up a guest of her father's who made a slur at her, she banished herself from the clan, cutting off her beard as a sign of rebellion against tradition, although she would let it grow back later. She has a relationship with Dave, an Orc healer, whom she later marries. Her twin brother Barrie, her rival for her father's approval even though he dearly loves his sister, later becomes the leader of a copycat imitation of Violet's team called \"Cat Kings\".\n;Dee (Delilah)\n:A human ex-high priestess of a monster cult who left her faith and her family after she became disillusioned with the horrors they worshipped. She still continues to use her powers, especially for healing, despite her falling-out with her dark deity. She was once married with Mezikiah, another cult member. At one point she is called into the realm of the gods and granted the powers of a dwindling deity. Although shy in social situations and gloomy about her choices in life, she loves the company of her fellow Rat Queens and will do anything to keep them safe.\n;Betty\n:A fun-loving Smidgen thief whose major vices in life are candy, hallucinogens, and large servings of alcoholic drinks. She is also a lesbian, with a long-lasting relationship with a human woman named Faeyri. Formerly called Petunia Harvestchild, she was the leader of a Robin Hood-type group called The Five Monkeys, who were framed for robbery and all - except Betty - thrown into prison; as a result, the other members of the Five Monkeys, unaware that Betty has been scapegoated, are out for revenge on her. In combat she is a vicious fighter, using her small size and agility to fullest advantage.\n;Braga\n:A huge, one-eyed transgender Orc and former member of the Peaches, another adventuring team which was wiped out during the first Rat Queens story arc. Born male and originally named Broog, Braga was the oldest child and heir to of her tribe's chieftain, but she didn't believe in her people's constant warring. Her ambitious younger brother Voon attempted a coup to eliminate her and take up the chieftainship; after her best friend and lover Kiruk was slain by Voon's minions, Braga crippled Voon in revenge and left her tribe, although Voon would later return, imbued with demonic powers, to plague Braga anew.  Her transition is not shown in the books but appears to have happened in between when she left her family and when she arrived in Palisades as a mercenary. Already a good friend of the Rat Queens, she later joins them full-time in their exploits.\n;Madeline\n: The teenage daughter of a retired bard who works as a barmaid in her father's tavern. She has long admired the Rat Queens and wants to be a fighter. After Violet's marriage and subsequent retirement, she takes over as the group's apprentice fighter.\nReception\nRat Queens received critical praise. It was nominated for the 2014 Eisner Award for best new series, and won the 2015 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book for its portrayals of LGBT characters. The first compiled volume, Rat Queens: Sass and Sorcery, was nominated for the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story.\nIn Paste, Robert Tutton noted that the \"rowdy, sarcastic and intensely loyal\" personalities of the main characters drive the series, and praised its seamless transitions from \"gore to humor, sprawling action to small personal moments\", as well as artist Roc Upchurch's skill at portraying facial expressions. Augie De Blieck from Comic Book Resources appreciated the \"dark, twisted, and hilarious\" series for its fast pacing, Wiebe's witty (and foul-mouthed) writing, and the humanity and personality with which Upchurch infused his drawings. Writing for IGN, Benjamin Bailey described the \"mix of D20 adventures and modern angst\" as perfecting the formula of injecting humor and wit into sword and sorcery tropes, and praised Upchurch's \"expressive and unique\" character designs.\nIssues\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Issue\n!Title\n!Release date\n!Story\n!Art\n!Colors\n!Cover\n|-\n|Special\n|Rat Queens Free Preview\n|Sep. 9, 2013\n|Kurtis J.

Wiebe originally stated that Rat Queens #16 would never be collected. Weibe commented on Reddit: \"I hated that issue. It was a reminder of how bad things had gotten creatively.\" However in 2023 Wiebe announced on Facebook that it would finally be collected in the Rat Queens Omnibus, to be published later in 2023.\nTrade paperbacks\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!colspan=5|Trade paperbacks\n|-\n!Title\n!Release date\n!Collects\n!Cover\n!ISBN\n|-\n|Rat Queens, Volume 1Sass and Sorcery\n|March 26, 2014\n|\n*Rat Queens #1–5\n|Fiona Staples\n|\n|-\n|Rat Queens, Volume 2The Far Reaching Tentacles of N’Rygoth\n|May 6, 2015\n|\n*Rat Queens #6–10\n|Stjepan Sejic\n|\n|-\n|Rat Queens, Volume 3Demons\n|April 13, 2016\n|\n*Rat Queens #11–15\n*Braga #1\n|Tess Fowlerand Tamra Bonvillain\n|\n|-\n|Rat Queens, Volume 4High Fantasies\n|October 11, 2017\n|\n*Rat Queens Vol. 2 #1–5\n|Owen Gieni\n|\n|-\n|Rat Queens, Volume 5The Colossal Magic Nothing\n|July 25, 2018\n|\n*Rat Queens Vol. 2 #6–10\n*Orc Dave\n|Owen Gieni\n|\n|-\n|Rat Queens, Volume 6The Infernal Path\n|May 15, 2019\n|\n*Rat Queens Vol. 2 #11–15\n*Neon Static\n|Owen Gieni\n|\n|-\n|Rat Queens, Volume 7The Once and Future King\n|February 12, 2020\n|\n*Rat Queens Vol. 2 #16–20\n*Swamp Romp\n|Marco Leskoand Priscilla Petraites\n|\n|-\n|Rat Queens, Volume 8The God Dilemma\n|April, 2021\n|\n*Rat Queens Vol. 2 #21-25\n|Marco Leskoand Priscilla Petraites\n|\n|}\nDeluxe hardcover edition\nWhile Wiebe considers Rat Queens, Volume 3: Demons canon, he said he would not collect the arc in the deluxe hardcovers because of his falling out with the artist, Tess Fowler.
