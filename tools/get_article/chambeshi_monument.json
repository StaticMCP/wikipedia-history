I order my troops to end hostilities as from now and I expect you to do the same. General van Deventer.\nHence the Memorial marks the cessation of hostilities, not the surrender.\nLocation\n|alt =\n|relief =1\n|AlternativeMap=\n|overlay_image =\n|label =\n|label_size =\n|position =\n|background =\n|mark =\n|marksize =\n|link =\n|coordinates = }}\nThe location of the Monument is on the north bank of the Chambeshi River, near the northern end of the old Chambeshi Bridge (which was built later, this bridge was destroyed by Rhodesian troops during the Rhodesian Bush War, a new bridge was built further upstream) on the Mpika-Kasama road. Most accounts of the war say that Lettow-Vorbeck surrendered at Abercorn, 250&nbsp;km to the north, giving the impression that he penetrated just the few kilometres to Abercorn from German East Africa but that is only because he was instructed by Allied commanders in Northern Rhodesia to march his troops there for the official surrender on 23 November 1918.\nHistorical background\nThe British force had been waiting in the Abercorn area to attack the German forces coming from northern Mozambique, thinking they would make for Lake Tanganyika, but General von Lettow-Vorbeck had evaded them by turning south-west towards Kasama. Its tiny British population evacuated to Mpika, except for nine who set up two Maxim guns at the Chambeshi, but they did not know how to work them. One, Charlie Simpson, had with him about £10,000 which was all the cash from the government offices and businesses in Kasama, which he buried in a goat pen near the rubber factory he ran, thinking that the goats' hoofprints would hide evidence of digging, and that the Germans would probably be more interested in the goats than looking for the money. On arrival at the Chambeshi the Germans machine-gunned the rubber factory before Croad arrived with the telegram.\nSetting up the monument\nThe Monument was unveiled on 14 November 1953 as a National Monument of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and consists of a large stone platform with the plaques set into a stone pillar, next to a cannon of the era (but not one used by the Germans).\nSee also\n* Mbala War Memorial\nReferences"
