The station was sited just north of a level crossing on the A420 road through the village. It had wooden buildings: the shelter on the down platform (towards Bath) survives and is used on occasion as a refreshment stop on the Bristol & Bath Railway Path, which follows the route of the railway.\nServices\nThe station was served by stopping trains from Bath to Mangotsfield, Bristol St Philips and Bristol Temple Meads, via Bitton and Oldland Common.\n}}\nReferences"
