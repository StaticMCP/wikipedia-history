There are about 200 distinct members known.\nCharacteristics\nThey are a regolith breccia consisting mostly of eucrite and diogenite fragments, although carbonaceous chondrules and impact melt can also occur. The rock formed from impact ejecta which was later buried by newer impacts and lithified due to the pressure from overlying layers. Regolith breccias are not found on Earth due to a lack of regolith on bodies which have an atmosphere.\nName\nHowardites are named for Edward Howard, a pioneer of meteoritics.\nAn arbitrary divide between howardites and the polymict eucrites is a 9:1 ratio of eucrite to diogenite fragments.\nSee also\n* Glossary of meteoritics\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.meteorites.com.au/collection/achondrites.html#Howardites Howardite images] - Meteorites Australia"
