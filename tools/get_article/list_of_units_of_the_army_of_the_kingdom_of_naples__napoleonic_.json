At its height in 1815, it numbered close to 95,000 men. This large formation was modelled heavily on the French Grande Armée, and although the success of its service in the Peninsular War is questionable, the Neapolitan Army is still remembered as one of the better-organised examples of armies from Napoleon's client states.\nBelow is a mostly complete (with a few obscure exceptions) list of various units serving in the Murattian Neapolitan Army in the Napoleonic Wars. The units are listed by their respective army branches, i.e. Guard infantry and engineers. All of the regiments and units pertaining to the Guard had the phrase \"della Guardia Reale\" (Italian: 'of the Royal Guard') after their official name, to indicate their status as part of the Royal Household Guard.\nRoyal Guard\nGuard Infantry\nIn 1815, the Guard Infantry Division totalled 57 companies organised into 4 regiments (9 battalions) and totalled 8,135 men.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!English name\n!Italian Name\n!Formation Date\n!Disbanded\n!Major Nationalities (other than Neapolitan) — if applicable\n!Notes\n|-\n|Regiment of Foot Grenadiers\n|Reggimento di Granatieri a Piedi\n|11 July 1806\n|20 May 1815\n|French, German and \"other foreigners\"\n|Personal Guard of the King of Naples.
