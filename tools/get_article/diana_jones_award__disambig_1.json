The award is unusual in two ways: first, it is not an award for a specific class of thing, but can be awarded to a person, product, publication, company, organization, event or trend – anything related to gaming; second, it does not count popularity or commercial success as a sign of \"excellence\".  The award was first presented in 2001.\nNominees are circulated during the year to the committee, which is mostly anonymous but which is known to include Peter Adkison, Matt Forbeck, John Kovalic and James Wallis.  The committee is anonymous to protect the voting process from interference, but individual judges are free to reveal themselves.  The committee releases a shortlist of three to seven nominees in spring, and the award is presented to the winner at Gen Con in Indianapolis in August.\nHistory\nThe Diana Jones trophy was originally created as a keepsake in the UK offices of TSR in the mid 1980s to commemorate the ending of their license to publish The Adventures of Indiana Jones Role-Playing Game.  The trophy itself was a lucite pyramid containing the burnt remains of the last unsold copy of the game; all that was legible of the title was \"diana Jones\".  (There is no relation of the award with fantasy author Diana Wynne Jones.) The trophy was \"liberated\" and eventually ended up with the Diana Jones committee. The destruction of \"one of the least-loved and critically savaged games of all time\" was seen an appropriate symbol for an award for excellence in gaming. The trophy also contains a counter that reads \"Nazi™\" from the game.  While the trademark claim was present at Lucasfilm's insistence, it led to rumors that TSR had tried to trademark the term.\nIn October 2021, it was announced that the physical award had been lost in transit. A committee member stated \"Perhaps it now sits in a box inside a warehouse somewhere, as forgotten and unappreciated as the Ark of the Covenant at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" A new physical award was debuted in 2022, and the committee announced the launch of a new award, the Diana Jones Emerging Designer Program.\nThe Diana Jones Committee became a 501(c)(3) registered charity in 2023.\nPast winners\n*2001: Peter Adkison, founder of Wizards of the Coast.\n*2002: awarded jointly to Ron Edwards and his game Sorcerer.\n*2003: awarded jointly to Jordan Weisman, a founder of FASA Corporation and WizKids, and to Nobilis second edition.\n*2004: My Life with Master by Paul Czege.\n*2005: Ticket to Ride, the board game by Alan Moon, published by Days of Wonder.\n*2006: Irish Game Convention Charity Auctions, at Gaelcon and Warpcon, for their generosity.\n*2007: The Great Pendragon Campaign, by Greg Stafford, a supplement for the Pendragon role-playing game (published by White Wolf, Inc.).\n*2008: awarded jointly to Grey Ranks by Jason Morningstar, and to Wolfgang Baur and his Open Design business model.\n*2009: Dominion, a card game by Donald X.
