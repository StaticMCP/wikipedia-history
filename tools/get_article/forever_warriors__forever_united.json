      "text": "# Forever Warriors, Forever United\n\nForever Warriors Forever United is the thirteenth studio album by the German heavy metal singer Doro, released on August 17, 2018 through Nuclear Blast Records. This is Doro's first double album, released separately as split albums, as well as a double package. The album is dedicated to Lemmy Kilmister. The first single \"All For Metal\" contains several guest vocalists such as Chuck Billy, Jeff Waters, Johan Hegg, Mille Petrozza, and Sabaton. \"If I Can't Have You, No One Will\", which has a duet with Amon Amarth bellower Johan Hegg, was released as the 2nd Single. The third and fourth singles were \"Lift Me Up\" and \"It Cuts So Deep\" respectfully. Five music videos were produced in promotion for the record's release: \"All for Metal\", \"It Cuts So Deep\", \"If I Can Not Have – No One Will\", \"Freunde Furs Leben\" and \"Love's Gone to Hell\".\nBackground\nWhen talking about the album Doro explained that: }}\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = Distorted Sound\n|rev2score = 7/10\n|rev3 = Ghost Cult Magazine\n|rev3score = 7.0/10\n|rev4 = Grimmgent\n|rev4score = 6.4/10\n|rev5 = Metal Forces\n|rev5score = 8/10\n|rev6 = Metal Hammer\n|rev6score =\n}}\nReception of the album was generally positive upon its release, with many welcoming Doro's return. A review from Blabbermouth.net stated that \"Forever Warriors, Forever United is like that reliable MOTÖRHEAD album you're gonna buy automatically—just because.\" They spoke fondly of tracks like \"All for Metal\", \"Turn It Up\", \"Resistance\", \"Blood, Sweat and Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Fight Through the Fire\", and \"Backstage to Heaven\". However, they disliked the length of the album, stating that;\nJohn Kokel from Sonic Perspectives wrote that the album was more of a mixed bag, stating: \"We wanted to like this album. Seeing a golden rocker like Graham Bonnet defy age and the odds to deliver a blistering metal album was heartwarming, and we wanted nothing more than to see Doro also deliver the goods. However, there is little to recommend the album, unless one is a longtime Doro fan. The artistic drawing of a 22-year-old Doro on the cover unfortunately does not live up to the dated and faded product within.\"\nTrack listing\n| length2 = 3:49\n| writer2 = Bruhn, Doro\n| title3 = If I Can't Have You – No One Will\n| length3 = 5:09\n| writer3 = Doro, Johan Hegg, Thomas N.
