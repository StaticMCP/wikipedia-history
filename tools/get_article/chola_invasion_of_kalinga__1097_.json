The war resulted in the subjugation of Kalinga and its reduction to the position of a tributary state of the Chola Empire.\nCauses\nIn 1097, the army of Kalinga invaded the Eastern Chalukya kingdom which was then a vassal of the Chola Empire. The troops of Kalinga were supported by the chief of Kolanu near Ellore. A huge army under Vikrama Chola was sent to repulse the invaders. The army was supported by troops under the Pandya viceroy, Parantaka Pandya. The invasion was beaten back and the retreating army was pursued back into Kalinga. Kalinga was subdued after a drawn-out war.\nSee also\n* Chola invasion of Kalinga (1110)\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
