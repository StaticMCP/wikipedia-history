It was released on 10 September 2001 through EMI. The album moves away from the drum and bass music from Colours (which Adam F described as \"a phase\"), and instead features hip hop music with almost every song featuring a vocalist. Upon release, the album reached number 44 on the UK Albums Chart.\nBackground\nThe album was promoted by its singles which landed on the UK Singles Chart. \"Smash Sumthin\" (featuring Redman) peaking at 11, Adam F's highest-charting single to date, \"Stand Clear\" (featuring M.O.P.) in 2001 peaking at 43, \"Where's My...\" (featuring Lil' Mo) in 2002 peaking at 50, and \"Dirty Harry's Revenge\" (featuring Beenie Man) also peaking at number 50.\n| title1        = Kaos Main Title\n| note1         = featuring Royal Symphonia\n| length1       = 1:12\n| title2        = Smash Sumthin'\n| note2         = featuring Redman\n| length2       = 3:20\n| title3        = Stand Clear\n| note3         = featuring M.O.P.\n| length3       = 3:59\n| title4        = Listen Here\n| note4         = featuring Capone-N-Noreaga\n| length4       = 5:27\n| title5        = Where's My...\n| note5         = featuring Lil' Mo\n| length5       = 3:45\n| title6        = Greatest of All Time\n| note6         = featuring LL Cool J\n| length6       = 4:05\n| title7        = News Flash\n| note7         = reporting Huggy Bear\n| length7       = 1:36\n| title8        = Dirty Harry's Revenge\n| note8         = featuring Beenie Man and Siamese\n| length8       = 3:13\n| title9        = Time 4 Da True\n| note9         = featuring Davie and Pos from De La Soul\n| length9       = 4:14\n| title10       = Karma (Comes Back Around)\n| note10        = featuring Guru and Carl Thomas\n| length10      = 5:24\n| title11       = End of Days Interregnum\n| note11        =\n| length11      = 0:56\n| title12       = Last Dayz\n| note12        = featuring Pharoahe Monch\n| length12      = 3:09\n| title13       = Time Is Up Outro\n| note13        =\n| length13      = 0:43\n| title14       = Trans Mission\n| note14        =\n| length14      = 0:22\n}}\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Chart (2001)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Albums (Official Charts Company)\n|44\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
