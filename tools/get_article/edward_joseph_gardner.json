His father came from Ireland as a child and his mother was born in Ohio.\nEducation\nHe attended the local parochial schools and was graduated from the College of Commerce and Finance of St. Xavier University in 1920. He did graduate work at Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia and at the University of Cincinnati.\nWorld War I\nDuring the First World War, Gardner served as a private in the United States Army in 1918.\nCareer\nAfter the war, he took a job as district controller of a food distributing company at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for four years and then worked as a public accountant at Hamilton, Ohio, from 1924 until his death in 1950.\nEarly political career\nIn 1926, Gardner was elected to the Hamilton city council serving as president and vice mayor for two years.  He was elected a member of the Ohio House of Representatives in 1937 and again in 1941, serving two-year terms.\nCongress\nIn 1944, he was elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-ninth Congress.  During his campaign Edward J. Gardner told fellow Democrats that he would work honestly and ceaselessly for employment of returning servicemen. \"We must make a positive determination that there shall be jobs and wages, that there should be security from unemployment, thereby setting a market for production,\" he said.  During his term, he supported a temporary extension of wartime price controls and the draft and the right to strike.\nPresident Truman's unpopularity overshadowed his reelection campaign in 1946 and he was defeated.\nLater career and death\nReturning to Hamilton, he continued his profession as a public accountant after his congressional service.\nDeath and burial\nEdward Joseph Gardner died in Hamilton in 1950 and was interred in St. Mary's Cemetery.\nSources\n* \"World War II – On The Home Front\" Dayton Daily News (OH) October 9, 1994 page, 1B.\n* Reston, James. \"Cleveland a Democrat Bridgehead But Rest of Ohio Seems GOP Camp,\" New York Times, Oct 19, 1946, pg. 10."
