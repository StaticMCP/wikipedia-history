The series is a spin-off of Rick and Morty, also co-created by Harmon (alongside Justin Roiland) and centers around President Andre Curtis, created by Wes Archer and Tom Kauffman, and voiced by Keith David, who will reprise his role for the show. It was announced at San Diego Comic Con on July 25, 2025.\nBackground\nCurtis was originally created by Wes Archer and Tom Kauffman as a stand-in for then-sitting US president Barack Obama for the Rick and Morty episode \"Get Schwifty\", though he was not given a surname until the show's fifth season or a first name until the show's seventh season. Inspired by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, series co-creator Dan Harmon said that the character's following appearances came from \"the idea of a cartoonishly bad president\", depicted as a composite character of Obama and Trump, before evolving into his own original character over subsequent seasons.\nPremise\nAccording to a press release issued by Warner Bros. Discovery following the announcement at SDCC, the show \"follows the Commander-in-Chief and his eccentric staff as they tackle the kind of crises that Rick Sanchez could never be bothered with - from interdimensional diplomacy to paranormal investigations and unexplained phenomena.\"\nDevelopment\nThe show was announced after Keith David made a surprise appearance at San Diego Comic Con's Rick and Morty panel on July 25, 2025. In a joint statement, co-creators Dan Harmon and James Siciliano said: \"President Curtis has always been one of our favorite characters to write — he's the only person in the multiverse who can go toe-to-toe with Rick and still hold office. Now we finally get to go on sci-fi missions from Curtis’ point of view. And with Keith David leading the charge, it's going to be a wild ride.” The show is also slated to star Jim Rash and Stephanie Beatriz.\nReferences"
