It was mainly concerned with pensions for those leaving the UK's fire services and police forces to serve in the armed forces (section 1–5), including those in the army and navy reserves (section 6) but excluding those in the London Fire Brigade (section 7).\nIt also clarified such matters regarding probationers and those in training on leave (sections 8 and 13) and that those injured on war service would have that injury counted as non-accidental injuries (section 11), but that nobody leaving the force to join the armed services needed to re-attest (section 9). It also made different provisions for chief officers (section 10).\nReferences"
