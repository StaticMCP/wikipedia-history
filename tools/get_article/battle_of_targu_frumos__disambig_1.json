The same historian had earlier concluded that the battle was instead a successful example of Soviet maskirovka, meant to trick the Germans into believing the region continued to be in their strategic interest after the end of the Uman–Botoșani Offensive.\nThe term may apply to either to the entire scope of conflict in the area over a longer time, but often refers specifically to the battle in May. For example, a military unit or an individual can be said to have served in the battle.\n*First Battle of Târgu Frumos, 9–12 April 1944: the Red Army took the town but was pushed out.\n*Second Battle of Târgu Frumos, 2–8 May 1944: the German forces held again.\nSoviet historians did not consider this to be a significant battle but have come around to identifying it separately.\nThe battle in May has been used in military education as an example of how a mobile defense can defeat an armoured spearhead.\nReferences"
