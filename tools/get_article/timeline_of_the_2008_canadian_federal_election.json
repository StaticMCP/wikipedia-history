Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, Sheila Copps, Gerard Kennedy, and Michael Ignatieff were among notable Liberals at this rally.]]\nThe 2008 Canadian federal election (more formally, the 40th Canadian General Election) was held on Tuesday, October 14, 2008 to elect members to the House of Commons of Canada of the 40th Canadian Parliament after the previous parliament had been dissolved by the Governor General on September 7, 2008. The election yielded a minority government under the Conservative Party of Canada, led by incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper.\nThe election call resulted in the cancellation of four federal by-elections that had been scheduled to occur in September.\nTimeline\n*February 6, 2006: Harper Cabinet is sworn in. Liberal David Emerson crosses the floor to join the new government, thus changing the standings in the Canadian House of Commons to Conservatives 125, Liberals 102, BQ 51, NDP 29, Independent 1. This has the potential to be very relevant in terms of numbers, as it allows a Conservative-NDP voting bloc to command a majority.\n*February 19, 2006: Bloc Québécois House Leader Michel Gauthier announces that his party will vote to keep the government in office for a \"good while\".

The Speaker only votes in the event of a tie and then must vote to support the status quo. The election of a Liberal Speaker effectively gives the Conservatives an additional cushion by denying the Liberals a vote. Numerically, the Conservatives can now pass legislation and win motions of confidence with the support of any one Opposition party, i.e., the Conservatives and the NDP combined have enough seats to win a vote, as they do combined with BQ or the Liberals (assuming all MPs are present and vote without any defections).\n*August 28, 2006: Bloc Member of Parliament Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny) dies in a car accident.\n*September 20, 2006: Liberal MP for London North Centre Joe Fontana resigns to run for mayor of London, Ontario.\n*October 18, 2006: Garth Turner, the Conservative MP for Halton, is suspended from the Conservative Party.
