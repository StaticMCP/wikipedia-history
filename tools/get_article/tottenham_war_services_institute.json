Fire destroyed much of the property on 13 October 1987, and the rebuilt structure was reopened on 14 April 1989. From 1995 to 2012, the building's top floors housed an annex of the nearby Tottenham police station. The top floors were home to the Footsteps Vocational Academy (a Pupil Referral Unit), and until April 2017, the Note By Note Music Academy.\nBut it was most well known for housing the T. Chances community centre (formerly known as Tottenham Chances). Supported by the Reknaw sound system, T. Chances has gained a profile as one of London' major punk rock venues.\nNotable figures associated with T. Chances included the musician Captain Rizz, and the poet Xochitl Tuck, who ran regular Survivors Poetry nights at the venue until her death in 2012.\nAs of 2020, the TWSI began operating out of the county of Somerset (South West England), stating on the register of charities held by the Charity Commission of England and Wales: \"In 2020 trustees made the decision to move from a London hub to participate in other parts of the country\".\nIn the media\nPenny Potter has given several interviews discussing the charity.\nThe TWSI's property was a topic of discussion in a 16 July 2009 meeting of the Haringey Council.\nKey documents\nFile:Deed of Trust (original), Tottenham War Services Institute, 12 October 1920.pdf|Original deed of trust founding the Tottenham War Services Institute, 12 October 1920\nFile:1920-TWSI-deed-of-trust-transcription-1950.pdf|1950 transcription of the original deed of trust: Tottenham War Services Institute, 12 October 1920\nFile:Deed of Trust (2017 transcription), Tottenham War Services Institute, 12 October 1920.pdf|2017 transcription of the original deed of trust: Tottenham War Services Institute, 12th October 1920\nReferences"
