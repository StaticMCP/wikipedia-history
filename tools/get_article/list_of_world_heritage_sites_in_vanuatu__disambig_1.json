Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Vanuatu accepted the convention on June 13, 2002, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Vanuatu has only one World Heritage Site.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\nIn danger|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Chief Roi Mata’s Domain\n|\n|Shefa Province\n|2008\n|1280; iii, v, vi (cultural)\n|Chief Roi Mata’s Domain is the first site to be inscribed in Vanuatu. It consists of three early 17th century AD sites on the islands of Efate, Lelepa and Artok associated with the life and death of the last paramount chief, or Roi Mata, of what is now Central Vanuatu. The property includes Roi Mata’s residence, the site of his death and Roi Mata’s mass burial site. It is closely associated with the oral traditions surrounding the chief and the moral values he espoused. The site reflects the convergence between oral tradition and archaeology and bears witness to the persistence of Roi Mata’s social reforms and conflict resolution, still relevant to the people of the region.\n|}\nTentative List\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , Vanuatu has listed five properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Yalo, Apialo and the sacred geography of Northwest Malakula\n|\n|Malampa Province\n| align=\"center\" |2004\n|iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The President Coolidge\n|\n|Sanma Province\n| align=\"center\" |2004\n|i, iii, iv, v (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Vatthe Conservation Area\n|\n|Sanma Province\n| align=\"center\" |2004\n|vii, ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lake Letas\n|\n|Torba Province\n| align=\"center\" |2004\n|vii, ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The Nowon and Votwos of Ureparapara\n|\n|Torba Province\n| align=\"center\" |2005\n|iii, iv, v (cultural)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
