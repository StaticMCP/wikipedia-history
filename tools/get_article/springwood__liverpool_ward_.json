The Springwood ward was created as a single-member ward from the western portion of the former Allerton and Hunts Cross ward. The ward boundaries follow Booker Avenue, Menlove Avenue, Heath Road, the southern boundary of Allerton Park Golf Course, Hillfoot Road, the Liverpool to Manchester railway, and the West Coast Main Line. The ward covers Allerton Cemetery, and Clarke's Gardens.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
