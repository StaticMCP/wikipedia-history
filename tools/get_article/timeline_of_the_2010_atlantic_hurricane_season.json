      "text": "# Timeline of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2010 Atlantic hurricane season was an event in the annual tropical cyclone season in the north Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the most active Atlantic hurricane seasons since record keeping began in 1851 as 19 named storms formed.|group=\"nb\"}} The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 2010, and ended on November&nbsp;30, 2010, dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The first storm to form was Hurricane Alex, on June&nbsp;25; and the last to dissipate was Hurricane Tomas, on November&nbsp;7.\nOf the year's 19 named storms, 12 strengthened into hurricanes with five intensifying further into major hurricanes.) or higher on the 5-level Saffir–Simpson wind speed scale are considered major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} The two most significant storms of the season, in terms of damage and loss of life, were hurricanes Igor and Tomas. Igor was one of the largest storms by gale diameter on record, and one that attained maximum sustained winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h) before striking Newfoundland as a much weaker storm several days later. Tomas was a late-season tropical cyclone that rapidly intensified to reach maximum sustained winds of 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) as it entered the eastern Caribbean Sea. Though the system did not make landfall, it severely affected the Greater Antilles, and impacted the southeastern Bahamas as a tropical storm before quickly moving into the open Atlantic.\nThis timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) prior to 2020 were: Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective regional time included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following the convention used in the National Hurricane Center's products. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline\nJune\nJune&nbsp;1\n*The 2010 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\nJune&nbsp;25\n* 18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One develops from an area of low pressure roughly 80&nbsp;mi (130&nbsp;km) north-northeast of Puerto Lempira.\nJune&nbsp;26\n* 06:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One intensifies into Tropical Storm Alex.\nJune&nbsp;27\n* 00:00&nbsp;UTC (7:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT, June&nbsp;26)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Alex makes its first landfall near Belize City with winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h).\nJune&nbsp;30\n* 00:00&nbsp;UTC (7:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT, June&nbsp;29)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Alex intensifies into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, becoming the first of the 2010 season.\nJuly\nJuly&nbsp;1\n* 00:00&nbsp;UTC (7:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT June&nbsp;30)&nbsp;– Hurricane Alex intensifies into a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane.\n* 02:00&nbsp;UTC (9:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT June&nbsp;30)&nbsp;– Hurricane Alex attains its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 946&nbsp;mb (hPa;
