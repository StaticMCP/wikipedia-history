There have been contradicting reports by the Chinese on its compatibility with APAS. It is used by Shenzhou spacecraft, beginning with an uncrewed Shenzhou 8, to dock to Tiangong-1. Subsequent crewed missions docked with the Tiangong-1, Tiangong-2 and the Tiangong space station. Similar docking mechanism was also introduced to the Tianzhou cargo spacecraft. Tianzhou 1 was the first cargo spacecraft which docked with the Tiangong-2. It has a circular transfer passage that has a diameter of . The androgynous variant has a mass of 310&nbsp;kg and the non-androgynous variant has a mass of 200&nbsp;kg.\nSee also\n* Docking and berthing of spacecraft\n* International Docking System Standard\nReferences"
