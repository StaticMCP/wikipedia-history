The monument represents the strong will of the first inhabitants of the area who arrived to this selvatic location to start a settlement with their families, looking for news options of survival and escaping the civil wars that affected the northern areas of the country during the 19th century.\nIt is a 28-meter high bronze sculpture and was dedicated in 1978. Its current location is in the main square of Armenia.\nReferences\n*http://www.colarte.com/recuentos/Colecciones/Armenia/recuento.htm?nomartista=Armenia%20Ciudad?idartista=7525\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013429/http://www.fondomixtoculturaquindio.gov.co/vercontenido.php?id=35"
