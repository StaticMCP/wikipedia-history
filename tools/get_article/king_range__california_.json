The area experiences frequent earthquakes.\nMost mountains and ridges in the range are low to moderate in elevation. King Peak, at , is the highest mountain in the range. Snow falls above 3,281 feet (1,000 m) a couple of times per year.\nNatural history\nThe range is part of the Northern California coastal forests ecoregion. It is largely forested with climax-dominant trees including coast Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii ssp. menziesii), oak (Quercus garryana and Q. kelloggii), and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), with pockets of sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) found along steep slopes above the fog line.\nThe rivers and streams that drain the range include the Mattole River.  Four federally endangered species occur in the range: the coho salmon, chinook salmon, steelhead, and northern spotted owl.  Other wildlife includes northern elephant seal, harbor seal, gray whale, brown pelican, bald eagle, peregrine falcon, black-tailed deer, mountain lion, bobcat, osprey,  otter, gray fox and black bear.\nHistory\nHistorically, the King Range was home to the Native American Mattole and Sinkyone peoples. In the 19th century, the region was opened to commercial logging, fishing, ranching, and tanning.\nIn 1936 and 1937, due to the rugged terrain of the King Range and Mendocino Range to its south, engineers assigned to designing the new State Route 1 were forced to site the highway further inland/east towards the town of Leggett in its route north from Westport. Subsequently, the inaccessible coastal wilderness, known as the Lost Coast, remains the longest undeveloped stretch of coast in California.\nIn 1970 the U.S. Congress designated  of the range as the King Range National Conservation Area. It is primarily located within southwestern Humboldt County, and extends into the far northwestern corner of Mendocino County.\nIn 2000 President Bill Clinton signed the law designating the rocks and islands just offshore as the California Coast National Monument.\nIn 2006 the U.S. Congress designated  of the National Conservation Area as the King Range Wilderness. The California Coastal trail goes from end to end of the range.\nGallery\nFile:Wildflowers, King Range National Conservation Area.jpg|Wildflowers\nFile:King Range National Conservation Area (18807554259).jpg|King Range cove\nFile:King Range National Conservation Area (18967577236).jpg|Old ranch and estuary\nFile:King Range National Conservation Area (18807535539).jpg|Purple sea urchins and Giant Green anemones, King Range tidepool\nSee also\n*Sinkyone Wilderness State Park\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/california/king-range-national-conservation-area Official Website], Bureau of Land Management"
