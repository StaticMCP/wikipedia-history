      "text": "# Joe Cronin Award\n\nThe Joe Cronin Award was an award issued by the American League from 1973 through 1999. It was not issued every year within that period but, in some years, was issued more than once.  The award was named for Joe Cronin who served as a player, manager, and general manager in the American League and was later elected league president.  It was created to recognize and reward players for significant achievement during the year.\nNolan Ryan became the first recipient of the award in 1973.  He, George Brett, Cal Ripken Jr., and Roger Clemens are the only players to win the award more than once, each earning the honor on two occasions.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Season\n!
