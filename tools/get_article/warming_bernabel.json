He made his MLB debut in 2025.\nCareer\nBernabel signed with the Colorado Rockies as an international free agent on July 2, 2018. He made his professional debut in 2019 with the Dominican Summer League Rockies.\nBernabel did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He returned in 2021 to play for the rookie–level Arizona Complex League Rockies and Single–A Fresno Grizzlies and played 2022 with Fresno and the High–A Spokane Indians. After the 2022 season, he was selected to play in the Arizona Fall League.\nOn November 15, 2022, the Rockies added Bernabel to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. He was optioned to the Double-A Hartford Yard Goats to begin the 2023 season. In 83 games for Hartford, Bernabel hit .225/.270/.338 with 6 home runs and 28 RBI.\nBernabel was again optioned to Double–A Hartford to begin the 2024 season. However, on March 28, 2024, Bernabel was designated for assignment following the promotion of Alan Trejo. He cleared waivers and was sent outright to Hartford on March 30. Bernabel made 120 appearances for the Yard Goats during the year, slashing .263/.296/.359 with nine home runs, 64 RBI, and 12 stolen bases.\nBernabel began the 2025 season with the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes, where he batted .301/.356/.450 with eight home runs, 45 RBI, and five stolen bases across 75 contests. On July 26, 2025, Bernabel was selected to the 40-man roster and promoted to the major leagues for the first time. He was named National League Player of the Week for the week of July 28-August 3, shortly after his debut with the Rockies.\nPersonal life\nBernabel's first name Warming is a portmanteau of his father's name, Warren, and his grandfather's name, Ming.\nOn December 3, 2023, Bernabel and his wife were the victims of a robbery attempt in the Dominican Republic, an incident in which he suffered multiple gunshots to the back.\nReferences\nExternal links"
