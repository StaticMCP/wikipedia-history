Advertising sales started soon thereafter, on December 1, 2007. Discovery's ad sales in Russia were handled by a company called Video International.\nUntil 2006, Discovery was represented in Russia and the CIS countries by Zone Vision. This partnership ended when Discovery changed their representative to Media Broadcasting Group Limited. MBG became responsible for the distribution of all seven Discovery channels in Russia, while Discovery contemplated opening an office of their own in Moscow.\nDiscovery halted all broadcasts of its 15 linear channels to Russia through the Media Alliance partnership on March 9, 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080307092242/http://en.mediabg.biz/cat409 Discovery Channel] from MBG"
