Like most professional wrestling championships, the title was won as a result of a scripted match. The championship, which was situated at the top of Arsion's championship hierarchy, was introduced on December 18, 1998, when Mariko Yoshida defeated Candy Okutsu to become the inaugural champion. The two contestants had earlier in the year won separate tournaments to qualify for the match. During the next four and a half years, there were eight reigns shared among six different wrestlers. The title was retired on August 24, 2003, two months after the folding of Arsion, when Yoshida defeated Mima Shimoda to become the final champion.\nHistory\nOn December 18, 1998, Mariko Yoshida became the first champion in the title history by defeating the winner of the Ars '98 tournament, Candy Okutsu. On February 11, 2003, the championship was vacated after the previous titleholder Michiko Omukai left the promotion. On April 29, Yoshida defeated Rie Tamada to win the vacant championship, marking it her second reign. On August 24, after Yoshida won the championship for the third time, she immediately vacated it, and the title became deactivated with the promotion's closing.\nReigns\n]]\nOver the championship's four-year history, there have been eight reigns between six champions and one vacancy. Mariko Yoshida was the inaugural and final champion, who also holds the record for most reigns at three. Aja Kong's reign is the longest at 485 days, while Yoshida's third reign and the last in the title history is the shortest, lasting less than a day. Lioness Asuka is the oldest champion at 38 years old, while Ayako Hamada is the youngest at 19 years old.\n|reign    = 1\n|date     =\n|days     =\n|location = Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan\n|event    =\n|defenses = 4\n|notes    = Yoshida, winner of the Zion '98 tournament, defeated Candy Okutsu, winner of the Ars '98 tournament, in a decision match to become the inaugural champion.\n|ref      =\n}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     =\n|days     =\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = Carnival The Queens\n|defenses = 7\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     =\n|days     =\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = Live event\n|defenses = 5\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     =\n|days     =\n|location = Urayasu, Chiba, Japan\n|event    = Carnival Arison\n|defenses = 5\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     =\n|days     =\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = Premium Starwars\n|defenses = 2\n|notes    =\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location =\n|defenses = yes\n|notes    = The championship was vacated after Michiko Omukai left Hyper Visual Fighting Arsion.\n|ref      =\n}}\n|reign    = 2\n|date     =\n|days     =\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    =\n|defenses = 0\n|notes    = Yoshida defeated Rie Tamada for the vacant championship.\n|ref      =\n}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     =\n|days     =\n|location = Tokyo, Japan\n|event    = Starlet\n|defenses = 0\n|notes    = This was the final Hyper Visual Fighting Arsion event.\n|ref      =\n}}\n|reign    = 3\n|date     =\n|days     =\n|notes    = This was an eight-woman elimination tag team match, where Yoshida, Ai Fujita, Akino and Rie Tamada faced Mima Shimoda, Mirai, Sachie Abe and Yumiko Hotta.\n|ref      =\n}}\n|location =\n|defenses = yes\n|notes    = Mariko Yoshida retired the championship immediately after winning it.\n|ref      =\n}}\nCombined reigns\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Rank\n!Wrestler\n!No. ofreigns\n!Combineddefenses\n!Combineddays\n|-\n!1\n| || 1 || 7 || 485\n|-\n!2\n| || 1 || 5 || 357\n|-\n!3\n| || 3 || 4 || 285\n|-\n!4\n| || 1 || 2 || 276\n|-\n!5\n| || 1 || 5 || 167\n|-\n!6\n| || 1 || 0 || 63\n|}\nSee also\n* AAAW Single Championship\n* JWP Openweight Championship\n* WWWA World Single Championship\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/arsion/arsion-s.html Queen of Arsion Championship history at Wrestling-Titles.com]\n*[http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/qoarsion.html Queen of Arsion Championship history at Solie's Title Histories]"
