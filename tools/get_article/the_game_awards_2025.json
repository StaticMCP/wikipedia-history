It is set to be the twelfth show hosted by Geoff Keighley, creator and producer of the Game Awards, to be with a live audience at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on December 11, 2025, and live streamed across online platforms globally. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 leads the ceremony with twelve nominations, the most in the show's history.\nBackground\nAs with previous iterations of the Game Awards, the 2025 show is set to be hosted and produced by Canadian games journalist Geoff Keighley. He returned as an executive producer alongside Kimmie Kim, while Richard Preuss returned as director, LeRoy Bennett as creative director, and Michael E. Peter as co-executive producer. The presentation is set to take place at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on December 11, 2025. Public tickets became available for purchase on November&nbsp;1.\nThe event will be live streamed across online platforms including TikTok, Twitch, Twitter, and YouTube, as well as Amazon Prime Video for the first time. The Game Awards partnered with Amazon for the show, creating a dedicated store for merchandise, deals, and new reveals. The Twitch broadcast will be streamed in 2K resolution for the first time. Like the 2024 show, the Future Class initiative—an annual list of 50 individuals from the industry who best represent its future, introduced in 2020—will not return in 2025, and the list of previous inductees was removed from the show's website.\nNominees\nNominees were announced on November 17, 2025; the Game of the Year nominees leaked a few hours before the official announcement. Any game released for public consumption on or before November 21 was eligible for consideration, including downloadable content (DLC), expansions, remakes, remasters, and seasonal content. The nominees were compiled by a jury panel composed of members from over 150 media outlets globally. Specialized juries decided nominees for categories like accessibility, adaptation, and esports. Winners are determined between the jury (90 percent) and public voting (10 percent); the latter is held via the official website and Discord server until December 10. The exception is the publicly-voted Players' Voice, for which voting is set to open on December 1.\nMillions of votes were cast within hours, causing website delays; Keighley called the traffic \"unprecedented\". 2025 marked the first year in which multiple Game of the Year nominees were independent games, representing a 50/50 split. Clair Obscur: Expedition&nbsp;33 is the second game to receive three nominations in a single category (Best Performance) after ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End in 2016. Megabonks Best Debut Indie Game nomination was removed on November 18 at the request of its developer, who felt he did not qualify for the award as it was not his debut game; it was the first time a developer had willingly withdrawn a nomination and the second rescission overall, following the removal of two fangame nominations in 2016.\nAwards\nMedia\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!

Sony Interactive Entertainment had 19 nominations, more than any other publisher, followed by Kepler Interactive with 13 and Electronic Arts with 10. Microsoft Gaming's subsidiary companies—Bethesda Game Studios and Xbox Game Studios—received a combined nine nominations.

The Game Awards Orchestra, conducted by Lorne Balfe, is set to perform.\nReception\nNominees\nSome viewers and journalists criticized the decision to discontinue the Future Class initiative. Several alumni felt they had been abandoned after not receiving responses from Keighley or Future Class organizer Emily Weir. Some suspected the initiative's discontinuation was in response to an open letter they wrote to Keighley in 2023. Polygon writers criticized the show's categories: Austin Manchester felt the term \"indie\" was misapplied, considering Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Dispatch to be double-A and triple-I, respectively; Paulo Kawanishi considered the Best Role Playing Game category too broad due to the diversity of its nominees; and Giovanni Colantonio suggested the show implement smaller, more knowledgeable juries (like the Academy Awards) for categories like Best Mobile Game to better represent genres and mediums.\nSeveral journalists were surprised by the lack of Game of the Year nominations for Blue Prince, Ghost of Yōtei, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Silent Hill f, and Split Fiction, and felt ARC Raiders, Dispatch, Donkey Kong Bananza, and South of Midnight deserved more recognition. Some thought The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy was deserving of a Best Narrative nomination, and that Alex Jordan was snubbed a Best Performance nomination for his role in The Alters. The Best Adaptation category was criticized for its nominees' mixed reception; some felt Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was snubbed, theorizing its December 2024 release date weakened its chances. Streamer Shroud, who won Content Creator of the Year in 2019 and was nominated for Trending Gamer in 2017, called the awards \"rigged\" after ARC Raiders was not nominated for Game of the Year, though several journalists and viewers called these claims unfounded and noted the game had tough competition.\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
