      "text": "# Results of the 1858 New South Wales colonial election\n\nThe 1858 New South Wales colonial election was to return 54 members of Legislative Assembly composed of 34 electoral districts with 18 returning 1 member, 13 returning 2 members, two returning 3 members and one returning 4 members,  all with a first past the post system. In multi-member districts, because each voter could cast more than one vote, it is not possible to total the votes to show the number of voters and voter turnout in these districts is estimated. 17 members from 14 districts were returned unopposed. The electoral districts and boundaries were established under the Electoral Act 1851 (NSW) for the former Legislative Council.\n}}\nResults by district\nArgyle\n}}\nBathurst (County)\n}}\nClarence and Darling Downs\n}}\nThe sitting member Clark Irving unsuccessfully contested Northumberland and Hunter.\nCook and Westmoreland\n}}\nCumberland Boroughs\n}}\nWilliam Dalley had been defeated as a sitting member for Sydney City.\nCumberland (North Riding)\n}}\nThe sitting member James Pye unsuccessfully contested Parramatta.\nCumberland (South Riding)\n}}\nThe other sitting member James Byrnes successfully contested Parramatta.
