Founded by bequest in 1869 and opened in 1894, the school is located in the historic Quincy Center district of Quincy, Massachusetts, and is the only nonsectarian private school in the city. Woodward's American Queen Anne style school building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nHistory of the School\nFounding\nThe Woodward School was founded by Dr. Ebenezer Woodward and his wife, Mary Ann Wroe Greenleaf. Dr. Woodward was a prominent Quincy physician and a cousin of President John Adams. When Dr. Woodward died in 1869, his will established a trust fund to create and maintain a girls' school equivalent to the Adams Academy, the Quincy boys' school founded by John Adams.\nUpon her death in 1870, Mary A.W. Greenleaf Woodward bequeathed further assets to the trust fund established by her late husband. The Town of Quincy, which became a city in 1888, was named trustee of \"The Woodward Fund and Property,\" and was given 25 years to build the school.\nHistoric School Building\nThe original school building consisted of six classrooms and was designed by E. G. Thayer in the Queen Anne style, with clapboard siding and a slate roof. Construction began in 1893 and was completed in 1894. In 1897, the school building was modified to add six additional classrooms, a library, study hall, gymnasium, reception rooms, and administrative offices. The architectural firms of Kendall & Stevens and Rand & Taylor were contracted to design plans for this significant structural extension. Upon completion of construction, the size of the school building was roughly doubled in size. Today, the school largely retains visual conformance with the 1897 building.\nIn 1989, the Woodward School was added to the National Register of Historic Places as an individual property of national architectural, educational, cultural, and historic significance.\nAffiliated organizations\n* National Association of Independent Schools\n* International Coalition of Girls' Schools\n* New England Association of Schools and Colleges\n* New England Preparatory School Athletic Council\n* Adams Academy (1872-1908)\n* [https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/454913438 Adams Temple and School Fund]\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Quincy, Massachusetts\n*Women's education in the United States\n*Timeline of women's education\n*List of girls' schools in the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.thewoodwardschool.org/History History of the school at the Woodward School homepage]\n*[https://aisne.org/schools/woodward-school/ AISNE Member School - The Woodward School]\n*[http://ledger.southofboston.com/articles/2006/05/26/news/news10.txt Woodward School's planned expansion]\n*[http://ledger.southofboston.com/articles/2005/03/10/news/news09.txt Woodward's Latin program]\n*[http://ledger.southofboston.com/articles/2007/11/27/news/news09.txt School's success in Christmas Parade float competition]"
