The accolade is presented at the Brit Awards, an annual celebration of British and international music. The winners and nominees are determined by the Brit Awards voting academy with over one-thousand members, which comprise record labels, publishers, managers, agents, media, and previous winners and nominees. The award was first known as Brit Award for British Single, from the inaugural 1977 Brit Awards through to the 2019 Brit Awards, was first renamed as Song of the Year in 2020, returned to the name British Single in 2021, then returned to Song of the Year in 2022.\nIn 1984 and 1991, the category was non-competitive, with the award given directly to the highest-selling single of the year.\nThe inaugural recipients in this category were Queen and Procol Harum, who both won in 1977. The current holder of the award is Charli XCX, who won in 2025 for \"Guess\"  featuring Billie Eilish.\nAchievements\nRobbie Williams is the biggest winner in this category with six, including three as a member of Take That, who have five wins, the most of any group. They are followed by three-time winner Adele, and Harry Styles, who won twice as a solo artist and once as a member of One Direction. Queen are the only other act to win more than once, with two. Williams leads all performers with twelve nominations, followed by Calvin Harris, who has nine. Take That has the most nominations as a group, with seven. Dua Lipa has the most nominations among female artists, with seven. Ed Sheeran holds the record for most nominations without a win, with eight.\nTake That were the first act to win British Single in two consecutive years: in 1993 (\"Could It Be Magic\") and 1994 (\"Pray\"), and they repeated this feat, winning in 2007 with \"Patience\" and 2008 with \"Shine\". That record was overtaken by Robbie Williams, a former member of the band, when he had three wins in a row with \"Angels\" (1999), \"She's the One\" (2000), and \"Rock DJ\" (2001).\nThe first female act to win the award was Spice Girls in 1997, for \"Wannabe\". Dido became the first female solo performer to win in 2004, for \"White Flag\". Adele is the first female artist to win the award twice, winning for \"Skyfall\" in 2013 and \"Hello\" in 2016 and then became the first woman to win three times with 2022's \"Easy on Me\".\nThe first and only tie in this category in Brits history happened at the inaugural ceremony in 1977, when both \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen and \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" by Procol Harum won the award.\nUnlike other categories, international artists are eligible for British Single/Song of the Year if the primary artist is British. The first foreign artist to win this award was Bruno Mars in 2015 as a featured artist on Mark Ronson's \"Uptown Funk\"; since then, two more foreign artists won the award: 070 Shake (as the featured artist in \"Escapism\" by Raye) in 2024 and Billie Eilish (as the featured artist in \"Guess\" by Charli XCX) in 2025.\nRecipients\n1970s\n]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:1.00em; line-height:1.5em;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"35%\" | Single\n! width=\"60%\" | Artist(s)\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1977 (1st)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"\n| Queen\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\"\n| Procol Harum\n|-\n| \"I'm Not in Love\"\n| 10cc\n|-\n| \"She Loves You\"\n| The Beatles\n|-\n|}\n1980s\nreceived the award for their iconic single \"Karma Chameleon\"]]\n]]\nwon in 1988 for \"Never Gonna Give You Up\"]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:1.00em; line-height:1.5em;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"35%\" | Single\n! width=\"60%\" | Artist(s)\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1982 (2nd)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Tainted Love\"\n| Soft Cell\n|-\n| \"Prince Charming\"\n| Adam and the Ants\n|-\n| \"Stand and Deliver\"\n| Adam and the Ants\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1983 (3rd)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Come On Eileen\"\n| Dexys Midnight Runners\n|-\n| \"Eye of the Tiger\"\n| Survivor\n|-\n| \"Fame\"\n| Irene Cara\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1984 (4th)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Karma Chameleon\"\n| Culture Club\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1985 (5th)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Relax\"\n| Frankie Goes to Hollywood\n|-\n| \"Careless Whisper\"\n| Wham!\n|-\n| \"Smalltown Boy\"\n| Bronski Beat\n|-\n| \"Smooth Operator\"\n| Sade\n|-\n| \"Two Tribes\"\n| Frankie Goes to Hollywood\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1986 (6th)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\"\n| Tears for Fears\n|-\n| \"19\"\n| Paul Hardcastle\n|-\n| \"Dancing in the Street\"\n| David Bowie & Mick Jagger\n|-\n| \"Money for Nothing\"\n| Dire Straits\n|-\n| \"Running Up That Hill\"\n| Kate Bush\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1987 (7th)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"West End Girls\"\n| Pet Shop Boys\n|-\n| \"Don't Leave Me This Way\"\n| The Communards & Sarah Jane Morris\n|-\n| \"Holding Back the Years\"\n| Simply Red\n|-\n| \"The Lady in Red\"\n| Chris de Burgh\n|-\n| \"Sledgehammer\"\n| Peter Gabriel\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1988 (8th)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Never Gonna Give You Up\"\n| Rick Astley\n|-\n| \"China in Your Hand\"\n| T'Pau\n|-\n| \"It's a Sin\"\n| Pet Shop Boys\n|-\n| \"Love in the First Degree\"\n| Bananarama\n|-\n| \"Pump Up the Volume\"\n| MARRS\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1989 (9th)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Perfect\"\n| Fairground Attraction\n|-\n| \"Kiss\"\n| Art of Noise featuring Tom Jones\n|-\n| \"Real Gone Kid\"\n| Deacon Blue\n|-\n| \"She Makes My Day\"\n| Robert Palmer\n|-\n| \"Twist in My Sobriety\"\n| Tanita Tikaram\n|-\n|}\n1990s\nwon the award in 1990]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\nwon for their worldwide smash \"Wannabe\"]]\nholds the record for most wins in this category, with six.
