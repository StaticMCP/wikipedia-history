The album was released on vinyl, CD and digitally on September 15, 2017 by Universal Music Enterprises and Reznor's own label The Null Corporation.\nAdditionally, the TV series reused tracks from The Social Network (2010), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), together with snippets of ten tracks from Nine Inch Nails' 2008 album Ghosts I–IV and instrumental versions of \"The Wretched\" from 1999's The Fragile and \"The Beginning of the End\" from 2007's Year Zero.\nSeparately, music for the series was also composed by Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble, David Cieri and Doug Wamble. Ma's work, which served as a score for the Vietnam scenes in the documentary, was released on October 6, 2017 as The Vietnam War by In A Circle Records. A third soundtrack album was released by Universal Music Enterprises, a double disc compilation of 38 (of the over 120) pieces of popular music from the 1960s and 1970s played in the series, The Vietnam War (The Soundtrack).\n}}\nTrack listing\nReferences"
