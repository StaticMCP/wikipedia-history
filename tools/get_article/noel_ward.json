Following Derry's withdrawal from the Irish league, Ward moved to Portadown in 1972. He played in the 1972–73 Gold Cup final, which Portadown lost 2–0 against Linfield.\nWard joined Aberdeen in 1974, but made only seven first team appearances in two seasons for the club. He signed for Wigan Athletic in 1976, making over 100 appearances for the club, and helping Wigan gain election to the Football League in 1978. In 1979, Ward broke his leg in a match against Portsmouth, an injury which prematurely ended his career. In 1982, he was awarded a testimonial match by Wigan, which was played against Chelsea.\nCareer statistics\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Club\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=3|League\n!colspan=2|National Cup\n!colspan=2|League Cup\n!colspan=2|Other\n!colspan=2|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Aberdeen\n|1974–75\n|Division One\n|5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0\n|-\n|1975–76\n|Premier Division\n|2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!7!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!7!!0\n|-\n|rowspan=5|Wigan Athletic\n|1976–77\n|Northern Premier League\n|42||2||||||||||||||42||2\n|-\n|1977–78\n|Northern Premier League\n|44||5||||||||||||||44||5\n|-\n|1978–79\n|Fourth Division\n|44||4||2||0||2||0||0||0||48||4\n|-\n|1979–80\n|Fourth Division\n|4||0||0||0||2||0||0||0||6||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!134!!11!!2!!0!!4!!0!!0!!0!!140!!11\n|-\n!colspan=3|Career total\n!509||198||20||10||35||16||21||9||585||233\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://nifootball.blogspot.com/2007/10/noel-ward.html Profile] at NIFG"
