He emigrated to Indianapolis in December 1897 to help complete the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in Indianapolis, Indiana, which was designed by German architect Bruno Schmitz. He was invited to work on the project by Karl Bitter, with whom he had worked in Austria.\nTraining\nIn Vienna, Schwarz attended the Real-Schule, similar to America's high school, for eight years.  Afterward, he entered the Imperial Academy of Arts in Vienna, where his work was recognized and where he received many prizes. Karl Bitter met him at that Academy and introduced him to stone-carving.\nBitter describes Schwarz in their younger days:\n\"Schwarz attracted me very much.  His manly bearing, his fondness for athletic exercise, his straightforwardness, and particularly his quick and vivid mind, made him one of the most promising pupils of the Academy.  To his influence during these years I owe a great deal, especially in physical development.  He supplied our class with dumbbells, which became our favorite exercise.  He was the kind of young man in every respect that I should like my son to be; for with his coming a new ideal, striving, entered the hearts of the other students.\", whom he had known in Austria.\nIn 1887 when the competition for the Soldiers and Sailors Monument began, Bruno Schmitz, who was first commissioned for the work realized he needed to bring Schwarz to Indianapolis. Schmitz located him in the ateliers of Berlin and both went to Indianapolis to work on the monument.\nIndianapolis years\nHe lived a simple life, almost secluded, and was not known among the public. He created a studio on East Raymond Street on the south side of Indianapolis. His studio was more or less a shed that was below ground. He had an assistant who was also his model who would dress in costumes for the figures that Schwarz would be designing. Schwarz made his creations using the lost wax casting process.\nAbout working as an artist, Schwarz says:  \"It requires some nerve for a young man to choose art as a career.  An artist sometimes does not know how to meet the problems that come up.  He must have the greatest conceivable amount of patience if he wishes to achieve success.  Art as well as any other work takes perseverance.\",\nFor the last seven years of his life, Schwarz created and directed a class in sculpture from 1905 to 1912 at the John Herron Art School, now known as Herron School of Art and Design.\nRudolf Schwarz died on April 14, 1912, at the age of forty-seven.\nLegacy\nSchwarz is known from at least 30 sculptural works throughout the state of Indiana, many of which are War Memorials.\nSelected works\n*Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (1897-1902), Monument Circle, Indianapolis, Indiana, Bruno Schmitz, architect.
