Originally classified as the C class, per Queensland Railway's classification system they were redesignated the B11 class in 1890, B representing that they had three driving axles, and the 11 the cylinder diameter in inches.\nIn 1888, three were transferred to Maryborough. The remaining member on the Southern & Western Railway was renumbered no. 36 to allow the B12 class to be consecutively numbered.\nClass list\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Worksnumber\n!Southern & WesternRailway number\n!MaryboroughRailway number\n!Queensland Railwaysnumber\n!In service\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=center|1305\n|align=center|17\n|align=center|\n|align=center|36\n|\n|Written off November 1904\n|-\n|align=center|1306\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|4\n|align=center|110\n|\n|Written off November 1904\n|-\n|align=center|1307\n|align=center|16\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|109\n|\n|Written off November 1904\n|-\n|align=center|1308\n|align=center|18\n|align=center|6\n|align=center|111\n|\n|Written off November 1904\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
