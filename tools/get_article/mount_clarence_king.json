King later became the first chief of the United States Geological Survey.\nThe Peak is located along King Spur, a sub-range of the California's Sierra Nevada. It is north of Mount Cotter, northeast of Gardiner Basin, and west of Sixty Lakes Basin and the John Muir Trail. The first ascent was recorded by painter and lithographer Bolton Brown.\nClimate\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Mount Clarence King is located in an alpine climate zone. Weather fronts coming off the Pacific Ocean travel east toward the Sierra Nevada mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the range.\nGallery\nSee also\n* List of mountain peaks of California\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Mount Clarence King from Cotter (photo): [https://www.flickr.com/photos/labgloves/44256861795/in/album-72157696320136910/ Flickr]\n*"
