She was 31 years his junior, and originally came from Korea.\nIn 1408, when she was 16 years old, the emperor sent to Korea for beautiful women for his court. Upon her arrival, she demonstrated the skill in playing the jade flute.  Known for her intelligence and beauty, she quickly gained favour with the emperor, and was appointed to a high position with significant responsibilities, including management of the 6 palaces where the Imperial women lived.\nDue to the favour she experienced, members of her family were also honoured, as with her brother, Quan Yongjun, who was given a high position within a temple.\nIn 1410, while accompanying the emperor as he took an expedition against the Mongols, she suddenly died. She had lived only a year and a half as part of the Imperial Court. Though her cause of death is unknown, and no such information is recorded in annals of the time, later Korean histories suggested that she was poisoned.\nIn these Korean histories, her death is the beginning of a tale of widespread bloodshed, where Consort Lu accuses Consort Ryeo of poisoning Consort Gongxianxian, and, in the fallout, the Yongle emperor had nearly 3,000 people executed.  No record of such large-scale scandal and mass deaths appears in Chinese histories, however, which causes many scholars to feel that the Korean history's version is probably not accurate.\nShe died at Lincheng, and her tomb resides in Yixian.\nTitles\n*During the reign of the Hongwu Emperor (r. 1368–1398):\n**Lady Gwon (권씨; 權氏) (from 22 November 1391)\n*During the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424):\n**Consort Xian (賢妃; from February 1409)\n**Consort Gongxianxian (恭獻賢妃; from 1410)\n**Consort Hyeonin (현인비; 顯仁妃) (from 1410)\nReferences"
