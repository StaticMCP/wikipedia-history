It was formed in 2011 by a merger between Bunda College of Agriculture of the University of Malawi and Natural Resources College (NRC).\nHistory\nIn a landmark address to the Malawi parliament on 24 May 2010, the third State President of the Republic of Malawi, His Excellency the late Professor Bingu wa Mutharika shared his vision of establishing six universities in Malawi.\nThis was meant to address the problems of limited University access and to increase the pool of well-trained human resource in the country in order to accelerate the socio-economic development of Malawi. One of the new universities to be established was the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) which was to be formed by transforming the then Bunda College of Agriculture into a university with the integration of Natural Resources College (NRC).\nLUANAR was therefore created through an Act of Parliament No. 22 of 2011 and started her operations on 1 July 2012, with Bunda Campus, as the initial institution until NRC was fully integrated into LUANAR in December 2014.\nIt has five faculties: Faculty of Agriculture (founded in 1967), Faculty of Natural Resources (2001), Faculty of Development Studies (2004), Faculty of Food and Human Sciences (2013) and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (2013). Ph.D. programmes are operated in collaboration with the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM).\nBunda Farm, which was part of Bunda College and an economic negative for the college, became a limited company in 2005. In 2017, Bunda Farm Ltd. started a service station with fuel pumps at the campus in order to generate income to the university as well as to train students in business management.\nFaculties, departments and centres\nThe Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources has the following faculties and departments.\nFaculty of Agriculture\nThe Faculty is organized in six departments namely: Crop and Soil Science Department, Agricultural Engineering Department, Department of Horticulture, Animal Science Department, Basic Sciences Department and Veterinary Medicine (Prospective Faculty of Veterinary Medicine). The Basic Sciences Department is there to provide services to other departments at Bunda College of Agriculture in the teaching of basic and fundamental sciences. These include Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Computer Applications, Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Biometry. Staff members from the department also assist in teaching other courses from sister departments. Some of these courses are pollution science, thermodynamics, gender studies, desktop publishing, management of information systems and other similar courses\nAgricultural Engineering Department\nThe Agricultural Engineering Department was established at Bunda College of Agriculture in 1972 and has the mandate of teaching, conducting research, and providing outreach and consultancy services in irrigation and agricultural engineering. The department takes a leading role in the promotion of agricultural production through the development and introduction of appropriate engineering technologies and practices for the sustainable production, distribution, and processing of biological products such as crops and livestock. The department places a strong emphasis on research and firmly believes that a research-oriented atmosphere enhances the quality of the teaching and learning process. The department welcomes partnership with industry as one way of linking its teaching and research with industrial needs. The mission of the Agricultural Engineering Department is to advance, promote and disseminate the knowledge and application of engineering needed to efficiently produce, distribute, and process biological products while conserving natural resources, preserving environmental quality, and ensuring the health and safety of people.\nDepartment programs\n*Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering  (Honors)\n*Bachelor of Science in Irrigation Engineering   (Honors)\n*Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering  (Honors)\n*Master of Science in Irrigation Engineering\n*Master of Science in Machinery Systems Engineering\n*Master of Science in Processing and Food Engineering\nAnimal Science Department\nThe Department of Animal Science is one of the five Departments within the Faculty of Agriculture.\nDepartment programs\n*Bachelor of Science in Animal Science\n*Diploma in Dairy Science and Technology\n*Master of Science in Animal Science\nBasic Sciences Department\nAll first year students at Bunda Campus take foundation courses offered by the Basic Science department.

Due to demand for capacity building in Aquaculture from SADC region, a draft Aquaculture curriculum was produced in 1991 and Aquaculture courses were to be offered as an option in the Animal Science Department. The first optional courses were offered in 1994/95-academic year. Students from other countries in SADC started joining the college in the same year for Diploma and Degree programs in Agriculture with bias in aquaculture. Some regional students studying in the Animal Science Masters program had opted to do research in aquaculture.\nDepartment programs\n*Bachelor of Science in Aquaculture and Fisheries Science\n*Master of Science in Aquaculture\n*Master of Science in Fisheries\n*PhD in Aquaculture and Fisheries\n*Master of Science in Aquaculture and Fishiries\nThe Department of Environment and Natural Resource Management\nThe Department of Environmental Science and Management (DESM) was established in 2001 and it belongs to the Faculty of Natural Resources. The department has a complement of fourteen academic staff positions. The areas of specialization for the staff members include Environmental Management, Wild-life Ecology, Environment and Development, Environmental Science, Environmental and Natural Resource Economics, and Genetic Resource Conservation. There are three positions for technicians in the department to be filled.\nDepartment programs\n*Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science\nBachelor of Science in Natural Resources Management (Land and Water)\n*Bachelor of Science in Natural Resources Management (Wildlife and Ecotourism)\n*Master of Science in Environment and Climate Change\nFaculty of Postgraduate Studies\nThis offers programmes at the postgraduate diploma, masters and doctoral levels\nControversies\nIn December 2017, student protests over frequent power outages at the Bunda campus. It ended in property damages and an arrest of 46 students.  The campus was closed for some time. The Malawi Human Rights Commission that investigated the death of a student found that some students had been subject to torture or inhumane treatment by the police, but did not find the police responsible for the student's death.\nSee also\n* List of universities in Malawi\n* Education in Malawi\nNotable alumni\n1.
