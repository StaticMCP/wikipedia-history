      "text": "# 1996 Chadian presidential election\n\nPresidential elections were held in Chad on 2 June 1996, with a second round on 3 July. They were the first multiparty presidential elections in the history of Chad and occurred at the end of a long transitional process after repeated delays. The elections were won by the incumbent President Idriss Déby, who easily defeated a prominent southern politician, Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué, in the second round. Déby benefited from the support of another southern politician, Saleh Kebzabo, who finished third in the first round. The election was marred by widespread and credible reports of electoral fraud and government intimidation of opposition forces, confirmed by international observers. Voter turnout was 68% in the first round and 78% in the second.\nFollowing his victory, Déby was sworn in on 8 August 1996.\nResults\n|party8=National Union|votes8=63671\n|cand9=Delwa Kassiré Koumakoye|party9=National Rally for Development and Progress|votes9=53260\n|cand10=Ngarlejy Yorongar|party10=Federation, Action for the Republic|votes10=48407\n|cand11=Mahamat Abdoulaye|party11=People's Movement for Democracy in Chad|votes11=47830\n|cand12=Abbas Mahamat Ambadi|party12=Independent|votes12=37568\n|cand13=Naimbaye Lossimian|party13=Action for the Republic, Democracy and Development|votes13=35420\n|cand14=Adoum Hassan Issa|party14=National Union for the Reform of Chad|votes14=28877\n|cand15=Elie Romba|party15=Democratic Union for Progress in Chad|votes15=26008\n|invalid=88224|invalid2=69699\n|electorate=3565913|electorate2=3871044\n|source=Nohlen et al.\n}}\nReferences"
