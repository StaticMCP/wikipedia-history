It was long the practice that the apportionment thus made stood until after the next decennial census.\nHowever, the power rests with the legislature to change or adjust the apportionment during the interim and in 1845, the tradition in Ohio of reapportioning following the decennial census was broken.  For the last half of the century, it was the policy of the party in power in the legislature to secure the largest amount of political advantage in making the apportionments, and they were made whenever the political control of the assembly changed.  From 1878 to 1892, the state was reapportioned six times as power oscillated between the two parties.\nA partisan majority in the legislature has it in their power to so apportion the districts as to enable the minority of the voters in the state to elect a majority of the congressional delegation, or to empower a bare majority of the voters to elect almost the entire delegation, in effect disenfranchising the minority. No apportionment of Ohio was absolutely free from partisan bias.\nConstitutional background\nOhio’s legislative structure\nUnder the original Ohio constitution, state representatives were chosen annually for the term of one year, and state senators were chosen for two years, the original allotment being such that half the senators held over and one-half of the body was chosen at the annual elections, necessitating annual sessions of the legislature.\nThe mode of electing members of the Ohio General Assembly was changed under the constitution of 1851. Senators and representatives were elected biennially, for the term of two years, and the entire legislature changed its membership at the end of the biennial period.\nThe object of the change in the organic law was to obviate annual legislative sessions, but as a rule, up to the last decade of the century, annual sessions were held, the general assembly adjourning to a date in the second year of the biennial period to complete its unfinished business and consider other legislative matters.\nOther changes were proposed in the Ohio Constitutional Convention of 1872–73.  However, the citizens soundly rejected the proposed changes in the referendum in 1874.  The next change in the state constitution did not occur until the 20th century.\nOhio’s county structure\nAt the time of the first apportionment in 1812, there were 40 organized counties in the state.  During each of the following decennial periods up to 1851, new counties were created to the current number of 88.  Where portions of the new counties came from two or more congressional districts, the voters continued to cast their ballots for representative in Congress as in the original district until the next apportionment was made.\nTerritorial representation — 1799 to 1802\nDuring the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Congresses, the Northwest Territory was represented by one at-large Territorial Delegate.  These were in turn William Henry Harrison, who resigned to become governor of Indiana Territory, William McMillan, and Paul Fearing.\nStatehood representation — 1803 to 1812\nOhio entered the Union on February 19, 1803 a few weeks before the end of the Seventh Congress. From 1803 to 1812, the entire state constituted a single representative district in Congress, held by Jeremiah Morrow for all five terms.  In the Seventh Congress Ohio had a population of 47,500; in the Eighth, when the state was first fully represented, the population was 68,850; in the Ninth the population numbered 91,280; in the Tenth it rose to 150,965, and in the Eleventh it reached 250,325, so that the member from Ohio not only represented the largest geographical territory of any single congressman, but about three times as large a constituency as any other.\nFirst apportionment — 1812 to 1822\nThe state was first apportioned into representative districts by the Act of January 14, 1812, six districts being designated.\nBased on the Third Federal Census, the state was entitled to seven representatives in Congress, but this fact was overlooked at the time the apportionment was made.  No attempt was made to rectify this error, the result being that Ohio was short five congressional seats during the decade, and one elector at each of the presidential elections in 1812, 1816 and 1820.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! colspan=2 | Ohio congressional districts 1812–1822\n|-\n!

The legislature in 1842 contained a Democratic majority and the apportionment debate acrimonious, the Whigs denouncing the proposed redistricting as unfair and grossly partisan. Consequently, the session ran until August 12.\nThis adjustment of the congressional districts subsequently became the excuse for a number of the most notorious gerrymanders at the hands of the leaders of both parties in later years.\nThere were 78 organized counties, which were divided into 21 districts based on the Sixth Federal Census.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! colspan=2 | Ohio congressional districts 1842–1845\n|-\n!

In 1844–1845, control of the legislature was in Whig hands.  On 12 March 1845, the Whigs proceeded to readjust the congressional districts, the first use of the implied legislative power to redistrict at any time, not bound strictly to the federal census. The legislature added one county to the list of those already organized.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! colspan=2 | Ohio congressional districts 1845–1852\n|-\n!

The United States Congress had just passed an act increasing the ratio of representation, and this had the effect of reducing the number of Ohio representatives in Congress from 21 to 19, and in the rest of the Union proportionately. During the first session of the Fifty-fifth general assembly, in 1862, the state was apportioned into the 19 districts based on the Eighth Federal Census.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! colspan=2 | Ohio congressional districts 1862–1872\n|-\n!

At the election in 1878, the head of the Republican state ticket received 274,120 votes, and the head of the Democratic ticket received 270,966 votes.  Each party won ten seats.  In contrast, using the earlier districting two years before in 1876, the heads of the tickets were similarly balanced (Republican 317,856, Democratic 311,220), yet voters elected 13 Republican congressmen and 7 Democrats.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! colspan=2 | Ohio congressional districts 1878–1880\n|-\n!

The vote for the head of the ticket was: Republican, 362,021; Democratic, 343,016.

The Republicans were again in control but in 1892 succeeded only in winning 9 seats, while the Democrats won 12. At the subsequent elections, however, the Republicans succeeded in increasing their delegation to as high as 15.\nBetween 1892 and 1900, there were no revisions of the apportionment only because the Democrats did not secure control of the legislature.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! colspan=2 | Ohio congressional districts 1892–1902\n|-\n!
