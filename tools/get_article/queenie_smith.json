In later life she became a talent agent. Today's audiences may know her best for her Southern-belle character roles in the W. C. Fields-Bing Crosby film Mississippi (1935) and the Irene Dunne-Allan Jones musical Show Boat (1936); her role as Jimmy Durante's wife in the Christmas perennial The Great Rupert (1950); and for her appearances as The Bowery Boys' Irish landlady (1956–57).\nLife and career\nSmith was born in Texas. Her family moved from Texas to New York shortly before Smith began studying at the Metropolitan Opera's ballet school. She got an early start, being trained in ballet and dance and spent her teen years performing as a dancer with the Metropolitan Opera Company in operas such as Aida, La Traviata, and Faust. By the 1920s she was appearing on Broadway in shows such as Helen of Troy, New York (1923), Sitting Pretty (1924), and The Street Singer (1929),. Her last Broadway credit was in 1934, for a two-month run of the play Every Thursday.\nShe journeyed west to try her luck in motion pictures. After being featured in the Lillian Roth musical featurette Masks and Memories (1934), she was cast as a showboat entertainer in Mississippi. She costarred in the 1936 Universal Pictures film version of Jerome Kern's Show Boat, playing Ellie May Chipley. Smith replaced stage actress Eva Puck, who had starred as Chipley in the 1927 premiere and 1932 revival of Show Boat.\nApart from a single feature film in 1939, she made no screen appearances until 1946, when she began playing character roles on film, and later, television. She was seen in guest shots on many television shows, usually playing feisty old ladies, in The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, A.E.S. Hudson Street, Rhoda, Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway, Barney Miller, Mother, Jugs & Speed, Chico and the Man, McMillan & Wife, Love American Style, The Waltons, ''Here's Lucy, The Funny Side, Hawaii Five-O, The Monkees, The Odd Couple, The Love Boat, Maude, and Little House on the Prairie (in a recurring role as Mrs. Whipple).\nSmith was a teacher and mentor to many young actors. She taught at the Hollywood Professional School and was the director for the training program at Melodyland Theater in Anaheim, California, during the 1960s. She also established a talent agency.\nShe worked until the year of her death, her last role being Elsie in the Chevy Chase-Goldie Hawn film Foul Play. (1978).
