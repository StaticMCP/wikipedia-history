Barker comments that \"Disappointingly few of the 43 tales have a sense of fun, but then these were people busy with marital rape and fitting small boys in chimneys. I'd have liked to have seen it stretch a little but you can't fault its style, and the editor's notes are brief and sharp. A splendid read.\"\nReviews\n*Review by Don D'Ammassa (1996) in Science Fiction Chronicle, #189 May/June 1996\n*Review by Darrell Schweitzer (1997) in The New York Review of Science Fiction, December 1997\nReferences"
