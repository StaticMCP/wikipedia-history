During this season the young professional side competed as Glasgow Caledonians.\nThis season saw Glasgow Caledonians compete in the competitions: the Scottish Inter-District Championship and the European Champions Cup, the Heineken Cup - as well as the Welsh Rugby Union's Challenge Cup.\nSeason overview\nThis proved to be one of the most turbulent years in the club's existence. The SRU decided to reduce the number of professional teams in Scotland from 4 to 2. Only Glasgow and Edinburgh now remained standing; with Glasgow taking over the Caledonia district – and Edinburgh taking over the Borders district. The fall-out from this caused many professional players to lose their jobs and created managerial problems at Glasgow.\nMeanwhile, behind the scenes there were negotiations on trying to get a suitable league structure in place for the two remaining Scottish professional sides.\nMerger\nThe SRU announced on 26 March 1998 that they would be halving the number of teams who compete in Europe.\nThe move stunned almost everyone in Scottish rugby; including Jim Telfer who had little time to prepare a defence of the four districts. Telfer thought about resigning over the move.\nWhat was even more surprising was the two sides ear-marked for closure. Caledonia Reds were the current Scottish Inter-District Championship holders. Border Reivers were based in Scotland's rugby heartland.\nThe SRU claimed the move was a rugby decision. The fact that last season's top two sides Caledonia Reds and Glasgow Warriors were being merged into one however made most doubt this.\nSome clubs - resentful of the districts in Europe – celebrated the decision and saw it as the death-knell of the Scottish districts. The Hawick president Robert Christie said: \"We are strongly in favour of this new development. We want clubs to get back to having a meaningful season.\" Former Grand Slam winning captain - and part of the 'Gang of Four' arguing against districts - David Sole stated: \"This proves yet again that to put the focus on districts was an ill-conceived and ill-planned idea which wasn't thought through\".\nIt soon became clear that finance was at the heart of the decision. The Herald ran this story over the closures: \"There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the prime reason for the SRU cutting their squad from 120 to 60 is to cut costs and appease the clubs\" and \"they have slashed the so-called budget by dumping players and they'll save nearly a million quid.\"\nIt was later announced that 43 players had been cut from the professional clubs. For the Glasgow side it meant that it lost about half its squad to make way for around half of the Caledonia squad.\nThe Glasgow District now consumed the Caledonia District - and the Edinburgh District took in the Borders District. The new districts were deemed 'Super-districts'. This was an unfortunate name as, at least initially, their play did not merit the term and the reduction of the districts hindered player progression around the country.\nNew coach\nIt was felt that Robertson struggled with trying to bond the newly merged squad together. For the first time then, the SRU appointed a top name Scottish coach for the professional Glasgow side.\nRichie Dixon was the former Scotland boss from 1995 to 1998, with a success rate (50%) at Scotland national level higher than Ian McGeechan (42%) and just slightly below that of Jim Telfer (53.8%). Dixon had quit the national job after Scotland lost a Five Nations warm up match to the fast improving Italian team but it was thought, with his experience, he was best placed to bring the district players together.\nPerhaps more importantly to Glasgow, he was a former Glasgow District player and captain in the amateur days of the club. As a player, he won the Scottish Inter-District Championship outright for Glasgow District in 1974. He took over the district as coach in 1983 and won the Championship as coach for Glasgow in 1989–90 in an unbeaten season, also beating the touring Fiji national rugby union team. There was no doubting his Glasgow pedigree. He took over Glasgow Caledonians in January 1999.\nLeague structure\nWith only 2 Scottish teams the Scottish Inter-District Championship could not continue in its current form. The restricted 3 game format was kept; however this was deemed a 'tri-series': essentially a best-of-three tournament to determine the winner.\nIt was felt that only playing 3 games against the same opposition would not help either Glasgow or Edinburgh in their European campaigns.\nTo try and increase the level of competition available, friendlies were sought as a short term fix while negotiations continued with other Rugby Unions. Pleasingly for the SRU, the Welsh Rugby Union and the Irish Rugby Football Union were meandering their way to a similar conclusion about increasing competitiveness for their own sides. The Scottish district sides faced up to the Irish provinces as part of the friendlies organised for the pre-season. In competitive matches, Glasgow and Edinburgh were also invited sides to take part in this season's Welsh Rugby Union's Challenge Cup. The SRU also organised pre-season friendlies against London Scottish - a member of the Scottish Rugby Union - and their London neighbour Richmond for Glasgow. It also organised friendlies against touring international teams for the clubs.\nThe Irish Rugby Football Union was against joining a British and Irish league. Thoughts in Wales turned to England. Initially it was thought that the English Rugby Union might be interested in a British league. However their proposals to the Welsh Rugby Union - that 5 Welsh clubs join a two tier English league - showed English contempt for the 'British' plan. The English model was flatly rejected by the WRU. The Wales coach Graham Henry said \"It was right to reject this paltry offer. What was proposed wasn't British, just a few Welsh clubs in a predominantly English league which would have been no good to anyone\".\nThe SRU felt the creation of a Celtic League for the Scottish, Irish and Welsh sides was the best way forward. This however didn't happen immediately but the fledgling success of the Scottish sides in the WRU Challenge Cup engendered good relations between Scotland and Wales and paved the way for a Welsh-Scottish League.\nTeam\nCoaches\n*Head coach:  Keith Robertson to January 1999;  Richie Dixon from January 1999.\n*Assistant coach:  Gordon Macpherson\n*Assistant coach:  Rob Moffat from January 1999.\nSquad\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\nHookers\nGordon Bulloch\nChris Docherty\nKevin McKenzie\nGavin Scott\nProps\nWillie Anderson\nAlan Kittle\nJohn Manson\nGordon McIlwham\nTom Smith\nLocks\nStewart Campbell\nStuart Grimes\nGuy Perrett\nRob Wainwright\n|width=\"33\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\nLoose forwards\nGareth Flockhart\nGordon Mackay\nJon Petrie\nJohn Shaw\nGordon Simpson\nMartin Waite\nMurray Wallace\nJason White\nHalf backs\nGraeme Beveridge\nDerrick Patterson\nFraser Stott\nStand offs\nTommy Hayes\nCameron Little\nChris Paterson\nLuke Smith\n|width=\"33\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\nCentres\nAlan Bulloch\nAaron Collins\nMurray Craig\nIan Jardine\nJohn Leslie\nMatt McGrandles\nChris Simmers\nBack Three\nJames Craig\nShaun Longstaff\nGlenn Metcalfe\nDerek Stark\nRowen Shepherd\n|}\nAcademy players\nGlasgow District Rugby Union once again sent a Glasgow Thistles squad to New Zealand for their development.

The second place achieved in the Scottish Inter-District was enough for Glasgow to be entered in the Heineken Cup for the new season 1997–98.\nThe pool matches saw Glasgow grouped alongside London Wasps; with former player Kenny Logan now starring for the English side. Logan was to put Glasgow to the sword over the two matches, scoring 3 tries against his old team. Nevertheless, Glasgow did well enough to get out the group and snatch a quarter final play-off place. However they were soundly beaten by the Leicester Tigers and their matches against English opposition showed the gulf of professionalism that then existed between Scotland and England.\nteams received in the pool matches:\n*2 points for a win\n*1 point for a draw\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Key to colours\n|-\n| style=\"background: #ccffcc;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Winner of each pool advances to quarter-final stage\n|-\n| style=\"background: #CCCCFF;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Advance to quarter-final playoffs\n|}\nPool 4\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!width=\"200\"|Team\n!width=\"20\"|P\n!width=\"20\"|W\n!width=\"20\"|D\n!width=\"20\"|L\n!width=\"20\"|Tries for\n!width=\"20\"|Tries against\n!width=\"30\"|Try diff\n!width=\"20\"|Points for\n!width=\"20\"|Points against\n!width=\"25\"|Points diff\n!width=\"20\"|Pts\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=\"left\"|  Colomiers\n|6||4||0||2||22||10||12||176||121||55||8\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=\"left\"|  Pontypridd\n|6||3||0||3||13||16||&minus;3||160||141||19||6\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  Benetton Treviso\n|6||3||0||3||13||13||0||142||150||&minus;8||6\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|  Glasgow Caledonians\n|6||2||0||4||10||19||&minus;9||121||187||&minus;66||4\n|}\nResults\nRound 1\n|score = 21–43\n|report = [http://www.epcrugby.com/matchcentre/17282.php Report]\n|away =  Pontypridd\n|try1 = Glenn MetcalfeJames Craig\n|con1 = Tommy Hayes\n|pen1 = Tommy Hayes (3)\n|drop1 =\n|try2 = Dafydd JamesGeraint O LewisPaul JohnGeraint Lewis\n|con2 = Neil Jenkins (4)\n|pen2 = Neil Jenkins (5)\n|drop2 =\n|stadium = Firhill Stadium\n|attendance = 2,000\n|referee = Nick Cousins (England)\n}}\nRound 2\n|score = 34–15\n|report = [http://www.epcrugby.com/matchcentre/17006.php Report]\n|away =  Glasgow Caledonians\n|try1 = Leonardo Perziano (2)Wilhelmus Visser\n|con1 = Francesco Mazzariol (2)\n|pen1 = Francesco Mazzariol (5)\n|drop1 =\n|try2 =\n|con2 =\n|pen2 = Rowen Shepherd x3Tommy Hayes\n|drop2 = Rowen Shepherd\n|stadium = Stadio Comunale di Monigo\n|attendance = 1,100\n|referee = Graham Hughes\n}}\nRound 3\n|score = 34–16\n|report = [http://www.epcrugby.com/matchcentre/16982.php Report]\n|away =  Glasgow Caledonians\n|try1 = David Skrela (2)Marc BibouletStephane PeyssonRaphaël Bastide\n|con1 = Laurent Labit (3)\n|pen1 = Laurent Labit\n|drop1 =\n|try2 = Shaun Longstaff\n|con2 = Tommy Hayes\n|pen2 = Tommy Hayes (3)\n|drop2 =\n|stadium = Stade Selery\n|attendance = 3,000\n|referee = Andrew Watson\n}}\nRound 4\n|score = 40–27\n|report = [http://www.epcrugby.com/matchcentre/16728.php Report]\n|away =  Treviso\n|try1 = Glenn MetcalfeRowen Shepherd (2)James CraigMartin Waite\n|con1 = Tommy Hayes (3)\n|pen1 = Tommy Hayes (3)\n|drop1 =\n|try2 = Ivan FrancescatoWilhelmus Visser\n|con2 = Luca Pavin\n|pen2 = Luca Pavin (5)\n|drop2 =\n|stadium = Firhill Stadium\n|attendance = 2,040\n|referee = Gerard Borreani\n}}\nRound 5\n|score = 26–17\n|report = [http://www.epcrugby.com/matchcentre/17166.php Report]\n|away =  Colomiers\n|try1 = Chris SimmersShaun Longstaff\n|con1 = Luke SmithTommy Hayes\n|pen1 = Luke Smith (2)Tommy Hayes (2)\n|drop1 =\n|try2 = Jean-Philippe RevallierStephane Peysson\n|con2 = Laurent Labit (2)\n|pen2 = Laurent Labit\n|drop2 =\n|stadium = Firhill Stadium\n|attendance = 2,000\n|referee = Nigel Whitehouse\n}}\nRound 6\n|score = 32–3\n|report = [https://web.archive.org/web/20160125201650/http://www.epcrugby.com/matchcentre/16980.php Report]\n|away =  Glasgow Caledonians\n|try1 = Dafydd JamesGeraint O.

Glasgow Caledonians and Edinburgh Reivers then fought it out in a renamed Tri-Series sponsored by Tennents Velvet.\nThree matches were played between the clubs. Edinburgh won the series, beating Glasgow 2–1. A league table is shown for completeness. Both teams entered the next year's Heineken Cup.\n1998-99 League Table\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!width=\"200\"|Team\n!width=\"20\"|P\n!width=\"20\"|W\n!width=\"20\"|D\n!width=\"20\"|L\n!width=\"20\"|PF\n!width=\"20\"|PA\n!width=\"25\"|+/-\n!width=\"20\"|Pts\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=\"left\"| Edinburgh Reivers\n|3||2||0||1||97||32||+65||4\n|- bgcolor=\"#ffffcc\"\n|align=\"left\"| Glasgow Caledonians\n|3||1||0||2||32||97||-65||2\n|}\nResults\nRound 1\nRound 2\nRound 3\nWelsh Rugby Union Challenge Cup\nBoth Glasgow Caledonians and Edinburgh Reivers were invited into the WRU's Challenge Cup; along with the South African provincial sides Northern Bulls and Gauteng Falcons and the Romania national side (in Glasgow's pool) and Natal, the Canada national side and the Georgia national side (in Edinburgh's pool).\nThe WRU constructed that year's tournament so that 8 Welsh teams are placed in two pools; 4 in each pool. The 4 Welsh sides in each pool then played the invited sides of that pool. The winners of each pool play a final; and the pool runners-up played a third place play-off. Hence Glasgow (and Edinburgh and other invited sides) only played Welsh opposition in their pools.\nDepending on results, the invited sides then would only play each other if they qualified out of their pools. Going into their last matches both Glasgow and Edinburgh had a chance to secure their pool runners-up place. This would have meant a Glasgow - Edinburgh play-off in Wales! However Glasgow fell at the last hurdle. Although Edinburgh won their pool runners-up spot they then pulled out of the 3rd place play-off against Bridgend due to their players' exhaustion.\nRound 1\n|score = 22–33\n|report = [http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12008533.Back_strain_rules_Smith_out_again/ Preview][http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12008197.Victory_loses_its_shine_for_Reds/ Report]\n|away =  Glasgow Caledonians\n|try1 = HawkerOlsenManley\n|con1 = Jason Strange (2)\n|pen1 = Jason Strange\n|drop1 =\n|try2 = Derek StarkJohn ShawShaun LongstaffJohn Leslie\n|con2 = Tommy Hayes (2)\n|pen2 = Tommy Hayes (3)\n|drop2 =\n|stadium =\n|attendance =\n|referee = G Simmonds (Cardiff)\n}}\nRound 2\n|home = Bridgend\n|score = 10–8\n|report = [http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12009751.Reivers_in_positive_mood_for_a_victory/ Preview][http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12006570.Reds_bogged_down_in_the_mud/ Report]\n|away =  Glasgow Caledonians\n|try1 = Penalty try\n|con1 = Cull\n|pen1 = Cull\n|drop1 =\n|try2 = Derrick Patterson\n|con2 =\n|pen2 = Luke Smith\n|drop2 =\n|stadium = Brewery Field\n|attendance =\n|referee = D Davies (Llandarach)\n}}\nRound 3\n|score = 21–19\n|report = [http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12005872.Penalty_causes_Caley_to_see_red/ Report]\n|away =  Glasgow Caledonians\n|try1 = MaddenScott Quinnell\n|con1 = Stephen Jones\n|pen1 = Stephen Jones (3)\n|drop1 =\n|try2 = Gordon Simpson (2)Shaun Longstaff\n|con2 = Tommy Hayes (2)\n|pen2 =\n|drop2 =\n|stadium =\n|attendance =\n|referee = H Lewis (WRU)\n}}\nRound 4\n|score = 7–18\n|report = [http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12007696.More_Euro_games_on_way/ Preview][http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12007922.Reivers_go_joint_top_but__Reds_apos__win_is_not_enough_Highs_and_lows_in_Welsh_valleys/ Report][http://www.blackandambers.co.uk/Match/Report/120923 Report]\n|away =  Glasgow Caledonians\n|try1 = Penalty try\n|con1 = Connor\n|pen1 =\n|drop1 =\n|try2 = Rob WainwrightLuke Smith\n|con2 = Luke Smith\n|pen2 = Luke Smith (2)\n|drop2 =\n|stadium = Rodney Parade\n|attendance =\n|referee = Nigel Williams (Wales)\n}}\nReferences"
