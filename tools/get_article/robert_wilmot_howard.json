He was educated at Monkton Combe School's Junior School before going on to Weymouth College, Trinity College, Cambridge and Ridley Hall, Cambridge. After ordination in 1912, he was from 1912 to 1915 Tutor to St Aidan's Theological College and became there a chaplain and then Vice-Principal. From 1916 to 1919 he was a chaplain in the British Expeditionary Force.
