The initial belligerents were the warlords Li Keyong and Zhu Wen (then known as Zhu Quanzhong), who went on to found the Former Jin dynasty and Later Liang dynasty respectively.\nAfter their deaths, their sons Li Cunxu and Zhu Youzhen continued the hostility, which also involved other quick-to-change-allegiance warlords mainly in modern Hebei. The war ended with the conquest of Zhu Youzhen's Later Liang dynasty by Li Cunxu's Later Tang dynasty in 923, after four decades of bloodshed that left much of the fertile Central Plain region destitute.\nReference"
