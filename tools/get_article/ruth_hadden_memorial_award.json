It was awarded in the early 1990s and has now been discontinued.\nThe award was unusual in that the prize was awarded to a completed manuscript before acceptance by a publisher, and the prize money (in 1994, £2000) went to the publishers of the novel to spend on promoting it.\nWinners\n*1991: The Last Room, by Elean Thomas\n*1992: Leaving the Light On, by Catherine Merriman\n*1993: In the Place of Fallen Leaves, by Tim Pears\n*1994: Pig, by Andrew Cowan\nReferences"
