The Pegasus Dwarf is a member of the Local Group and a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31).\nGeneral information\nimage of a part of the Pegasus Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy]]\nThe Pegasus Dwarf Spheroidal is a galaxy with mainly metal-poor stellar populations. Its metallicity is [Fe/H] ≃ −1.3. It is located at the right ascension 23h51m46.30s and declination +24d34m57.0s in the equatorial coordinate system (epoch J2000.0), and in a distance of about 830 kpc from Earth and a distance of 281.6 kpc from the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe galaxy was discovered in 1999 by various authors on the Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II) films.\nSee also\n* List of Andromeda's satellite galaxies\n* Pegasus Dwarf Irregular Galaxy (Peg DIG)\n* Pegasus galaxy, the Stargate Atlantis fictional location (probably the Pegasus Dwarf Irregular Galaxy).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/nph-objsearch?objname=pegasus+dwarf+spheroidal NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database: Pegasus Dwarf Spheroidal]\n*[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v118n3/990209/990209.html Armandroff, Jacoby, & Davies, \"Low Surface Brightness Galaxies around M31\", Astrophys.
