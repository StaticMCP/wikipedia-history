The current holder of the award is Jhaniele Fowler-Nembhard, who is currently the only player in the league to have won the award on more than occasion.\nUnlike similar awards in rival codes, where umpires are responsible for voting for a player, the SSN Player of the Year is voted on by the players, coaches and high-performance staff of the competition.\n, the award is known as SSN Player of the Year.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" summary=\"Season (sortable), Player (sortable), Nationality (sortable), Team (sortable) and Ref.
