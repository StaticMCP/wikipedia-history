IDragons were honored to produce the web series based on all the recommendations they got from other people. Since The King of Fighters was commonly known for being 2D game, iDragons decided to make it a 3D series. In order to generate appealing fights, the development team bought an arcade game machine. The artists and scriptwriters were ordered to play every day. Aware that The King of Fighters was also famous for its characters, iDragons produced side stories centered around backstories. In regards to the plot, the team decided to incorporate elements from another SNK franchise, Fatal Fury, alongside The King of Fighters believing fans were also looking forward to it. The answer to the first-season cliffhanger remains as a secret according to the team.\nRelease\nIn the West it began being released for free watching on August 3, 2017, on Steam and August 10, 2017, on YouTube. In China it was broadcast on Youku, Bilibili, Tencent Video, iQIYI and Mango TV. The series' first season of 24 episodes ended on January 18, 2018.\nThe King of Fighters: Destiny is a tie-in for the SNK video game The King of Fighters: World (along with Tencent's mobile game also titled The King of Fighters: Destiny).\nIn January 2018, it was announced it is going to be followed by two more seasons and then a feature-length film, adapting the Orochi storyline, that is the early KOF games' plot from ''The King of Fighters '94 to The King of Fighters '97, without any dates.  The first film The King of Fighters: Awaken was scheduled to be released in 2022.\nReception\nThe King of Fighters: Destiny'' earned mixed responses by reviewers. Kyo's portrayal in The King of Fighters: Destiny received better response due to the plot not solely focusing on his history but also other characters from the games. While finding the story dated, NSVMundoGeek considered it one of the best adaptations of The King of Fighters franchise, comparing it favourably in contrast to the live-action film that received negative reviews. IGN France reviewer was disappointed by the first three episodes, citing varying quality of graphics and his opinion inadequate sound, even as he enjoyed the mix of action and Chinese humor. Hogan Reviews enjoyed the handling of the cast as both Terry Bogard and Kyo possess their own stories across the narrative with their personalities also balancing each other. He rated it four out of five, stating he was looking forward for a sequel. Corey Lanier from Shoryuken enjoyed the climax and finale for the presentation of the fight between Kyo and Rugal and looked forward to see similar works in the future and bring Iori Yagami into the series.\nThe series was well received in China, winning the China Games Billboard 2018 award for most popular game-based animation.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.idragons.cn/project/info_3.aspx?itemid=6 Official website]\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7254486/ IMDb entry]"
