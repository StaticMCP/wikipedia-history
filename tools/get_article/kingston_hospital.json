It is managed by the Kingston and Richmond NHS Foundation Trust. It has an Accident & Emergency Unit, a popular Maternity unit, and an STD clinic known as the Wolverton Centre.\nHistory\nThe hospital has its origins in a workhouse infirmary built in 1843. A larger infirmary was built to the southwest of the workhouse in 1868 and a nurses' home was built to the north of the workhouse in 1897. The infirmary was separated from the workhouse and was renamed the Kingston Infirmary in 1902. It became the Kingston and District Hospital in 1920 and a larger nurses' home was opened by the Duchess of York in 1928. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 and began to redevelop the site the following year.\nA new out-patients department was opened by Princess Alexandra in 1963, a new medical centre was opened by Enoch Powell, Minister of Health in 1962 and Kenley Ward was opened by Professor Sir Max Rosenheim, President of the Royal College of Physicians, in 1969. The Esher Wing opened in 1976, the Bernard Meade Wing was opened by Princess Alexandra in 1992 and the Rowan Bentall Wing was opened, also by Princess Alexandra, in 1994.\nA new surgical centre was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in May 2004. The surgical centre, which was built by Costain at a cost of £33 million, opened in June 2007.\nIn June 2008, the Trust opened the Sir William Rous Unit, for those with cancer or concerned they might have cancer. The unit is run in partnership between, Kingston Hospital, the Royal Marsden Hospital and Macmillan Cancer Support so as to provide care for patients with cancer.\nServices\nThe Coombe Wing is a private patient unit on the site which was operated by BMI Healthcare but the contract was taken over by One Healthcare in 2018.\nTransport\nKingston Hospital is close to Norbiton railway station and is on the A308. It is serviced by several bus routes (57, 213, K2, K3, K4) (primarily from Kingston upon Thames).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kingstonhospital.nhs.uk Kingston Hospital NHS Trust]\n*[http://www.sexualhealthkingston.co.uk The Wolverton Centre at Kingston Hospital]"
