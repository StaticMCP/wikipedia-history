The Sri Lankan Navy claimed that it received reports of a boat cluster moving off of Delft Island.  After moving in to investigate clashes erupted and fierce sea battle ensued. Both sides claimed victory. The pro-rebel Tamilnet claimed that the Sea Tigers sank one Sri Lankan Navy vessel and the Sri Lankan Navy suffered 10 casualties. However, the Sri Lankan Defense ministry claimed that six Tiger boats were sunk and over 40 Tigers were killed.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
