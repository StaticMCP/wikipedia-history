Kawaguchi Detachment landed in three important points in west coast of Mindanao including Malabang in then undivided Lanao Province. Defending forces of Filipino and American troops resisted but lacked artillery, and due to Japanese naval and air support were overwhelmed and forced to retreat.\nBackground\nAfter securing the island of Panay, General Masaharu Homma ordered General Kiyotake Kawaguchi to Mindanao. He was to land in Lanao sector of Mindanao Force which was under the command of Brigadier General Guy O. Fort. Kawaguchi's naval convoy was soon spotted in the Zamboanga sector and reported to Mindanao Force HQ on April 27, 1942, at which time Fort warned his troops of the imminent invasion from his command post at Camp Kiethley.\nKawaguchi arrived and landed in Malabang on April 29, 1942. Opposing them was the 61st Infantry Regiment under Colonel Eugene T. Mitchell. Attached to the 61st was a two-gun battery of QF 2.95 inch Mountain Guns commanded by Captain Albert Price and a PC Company based in Momungan.\nCombat narratives\nThe 3rd Battalion, 61st Infantry under Major Ernest E. McLish was deployed north of Malabang Air Field astride Ganassi Road while the 2nd Battalion 61st Infantry under Captain Clyde Childress was posted astride the Maladig River. The 1st Battalion under Major Moran was held in reserve near Lake Dapao.\nThe Japanese landed used the docks in Banago southeast of Malabang to land their tanks, then moved forward in an effort to quickly capture the Mataling River Bridge.\nRegimental headquarters moved from Ganassi to the left side of the reserve battalion. Mitchell asked to blow up the bridge but Fort declined as the bridge was needed to give the 2nd Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Calixto Duque a way to retreat from Parang.\nMitchell reported to General Fort that a convoy of more than 20 trucks full of Japanese soldiers with tanks and scout cars left from Parang, Cotabato to Malabang.\nRetreat to Dansalan\nMitchell rounded up men to establish a holiday position. General Fort informed him of giving him 1st Battalion, 84th Infantry under Major Jay Navin. Mortars and artillery and machine gun fire rained down on the Filipinos in this position. Mitchell established another line but before his men could finish their earthworks the Japanese struck again, which scattered his exhausted, tired, dispirited men. This time Colonel Mitchell was captured, 61st Infantry was routed, which gave Japanese full control of Route 1 towards Lake Lanao.\nMoro battalions\nGeneral Fort's confidence in the Moro battalions was validated when they ambushed a battalion-sized Japanese force travelling from Ganassi to Lumbatan. Led by Captain Mamalinta Lao, they annihilated the Japanese with only two Moros lost. Another Moro unit under Lieutenant Muhammad Ali Dimaporo and Captain Busran Kalaw continuously harassed the Japanese.\nReinforcement\nFort ordered Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Vessey to move down one of his battalions in Bacolod, Lanao del Norte to support Mitchell. Doing reconnaissance near Ganassi, Vessey, his executive officer Tisdale and Private Childress were met by a tank, which fired at them. Vessey was able to return to Gannasi and appointed Commander Robert Strong, USN as his executive officer, thinking that Tisdale and his driver had been killed during the ambush. It was later known that Tisdale died in the jungle trying to reach the 73rd Infantry Line. Fort ordered Lieutenant Colonel Naidas of the Philippine Constabulary to establish a line from Tamparan to Taloan Hill using whatever troops he could find, and deny the Japanese entry into the east coast of the lake.\nThe Japanese advance resumed on May 3 towards Bacolod in a motorized column with four tanks spearheading at the 73rd Infantry's position. Direct fire from Captain Price's detachment caught the leading tank and put it out of commission, confusing the Japanese column. However, the Japanese got air support from Zamboanga, forcing the 73rd Infantry into successive retreats. In Dansalan, the 73rd Infantry and remnants of the 61st Infantry established another line to deprive the Japanese of Route 1 and link with the Kawamura Detachment.\nExecution of Jose Abad Santos\nChief Justice Jose Abad Santos of the Philippine Commonwealth was captured in Barangay Tubod, Barili, Cebu, while riding in an automobile with his son Jose Jr (Pepito) and his aide, Lieutenant Colonel Benito Valeriano. He was brought to a Japanese camp in Basak San Nicolas, Cebu City, where the Japanese attempted to persuade him to collaborate. However he was executed May 1, 1942 and was hastily buried. Markings were allowed on his grave.\nAftermath\nThe troops in Lanao sector were still fighting when orders from General Sharp to surrender reached General Fort on May 10, 1942. Many questioned the order, as his unit was still successfully fighting the Japanese. However, Sharp warned that any American who disobeyed his order would be court martialed. Fort surrendered on May 12, 1942 and combat operations ceased in Lanao Sector.\nDeath March and execution of Fort\nAfter the troops in Lanao Sector surrendered on May 12, the Japanese forced Filipino American POWs in very poor condition to walk 136&nbsp;km without water or food from Camp Keithley in Dansalan to Camp Overton in Iligan. Americans were tied by four per column and Filipinos, although not bound, were made to walk barefoot, and some were executed on the road. This event was known as the Mindanao Death March.\nAfter General Fort's surrender, he was shipped north on the small freighter Maru San alongside other captive generals, including his commander Sharp plus Joseph P. Vachon and Manuel Roxas. After the war, Roxas would become the first president of the Philippines. Fort was then escorted by the Kempeitai to Manila, where he remained for several months. In November 1942 the Japanese sought Fort's help in talking to the Moro people, who were still fighting the Japanese. Specifically, Fort was supposed to persuade the Moros to lay down their arms, and tell them that since the U.S. Army had surrendered they must also surrender. Fort was brought from Manila back to Marawi (then known as Dansalan) on Mindanao for that purpose. However, Fort refused to cooperate and was executed. His body was never found as he was buried in an unmarked grave.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Mindanao Force\n* 61st Infantry Regiment\n* 81st Infantry Division\n* Guy O.
