The Centre runs the Czech Medieval Sources online project which makes available editions of primary sources important for Czech medieval history for internet users. Since 2009, it publishes Studia Mediaevalia Bohemica (SMB), a biannual journal open to scholarly contributions in all fields related to the Middle Ages in Central Europe written in Czech, Slovak, English, German, Polish, or French.\nDirectors\n, the cofounder of CMS and its second director]]\n* František Šmahel (1998–2004)\n* Petr Sommer (2004–2019)\n* Pavel Soukup (current)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://cms.flu.cas.cz/en.html Centre for Medieval Studies (official website in English)]"
