It is administered by Hampshire County Council which coordinates the schools admissions.\nWarblington School offers GCSEs as programmes of study for pupils. It is the only school located in Warblington, as the area does not have any primary schools.\nThe property was Grade II listed in June 2019 by Historic England because of architectural and historic interest.\nThe school came under criticism in 2019 after a PE teacher, Sean Aldridge, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for having sexual relations with 4 girls attending the school from the ages of 13 to 16 between 2007 and 2012.\nNotable former pupils\n* Julia Chambers, actress\n* Bobby Tambling, Chelsea and England footballer.\n* Nicholas Lyndhurst, actor\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.warblington.hants.sch.uk/ Warblington School official website]"
