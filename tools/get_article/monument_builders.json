It was released on November 11, 2016, through Kranky. It received generally favorable reviews from critics.\nBackground\nMonument Builders is Loscil's first studio album since Sea Island (2014). He drew inspiration from rewatching a VHS copy of the documentary film Koyaanisqatsi (1982), as well as its score composed by Philip Glass. He was also inspired by the works of photographer Edward Burtynsky and the writings of philosopher John Gray. A music video was released for the track \"Drained Lake\".\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = Exclaim!\n| rev2score = 8/10\n| rev3 = The Line of Best Fit\n| rev3score = 8/10\n| rev4 = Pitchfork\n| rev4score = 7.4/10\n| rev5 = PopMatters\n| rev5score = 7/10\n| rev6 = The Skinny\n| rev6score =\n}}\nHeather Phares of AllMusic stated, \"Monument Builders is a powerful reminder that ambient music is a fine conduit for emotionally and politically charged messages, and it's one of Morgan's finest works yet.\" Daniel Sylvester of Exclaim! commented that the album \"finds Loscil at his most focused, political and meticulous, a bleak but fulfilling listen whether you're aware of the album's brainy themes or not.\" Brian Burlage of Pitchfork described it as \"a highly visual album, a mosaic of images depicting construction, erasure, devastation, redemption, and transformation.\"\nFinbarr Bermingham of The Skinny stated, \"This is a breathless and dense record, built on layers of crackle, fuzz and dystopian fugue.\" He added, \"What really capture the imagination, though, are the fleeting, stark melodies Loscil introduces on almost every track.\" Ian King of The Line of Best Fit stated, \"Leaving listeners in the 'Weeds' surrounded by a swirl of haunting whispers, Monument Builders doesn't offer a happy ending, but nor is it devoid of hope.\" He added, \"Perhaps Loscil's most confrontational record, it processes the darkness in order to expunge it.\"}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Somewherecold\n| Top 10 Albums of the Year\n|\n| }}\n|}\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from liner notes.\n* Scott Morgan – production\n* Nick Anderson – French horn (2–4, 6)\n* Erik Nielsen – French horn recording (2–4, 6)\n* Joshua Stevenson – synthesis (2, 6)\n* Ashley Pitre – vocal sample (7)\n* Rafael Anton – mastering\n* Bob Weston – lathe cut\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
