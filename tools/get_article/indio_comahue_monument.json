It was constructed to honor the native inhabitants of the Comahue Region. The monument was completed in time for the inaugural Comahue National Fair in 1964.\nCommissioned by the organizers of the fair, Bartolo Pasin and Rogelio Chimenti, it was designed by Miguel De Lisi and constructed in two months by local bricklayer Aldo Cardozo. Presently it is used as an overlook for its panoramic view. The monument is considered to be a symbol of the town, and as such it is depicted in the coat of arms.\nHistory\nThe monument was erected to commemorate the native inhabitants of Comahue. It was constructed for the first Comahue National Fair, in 1964. This was a 45-day event that aimed to highlight the economic potential of the Comahue Region, and at the same time commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of Villa Regina. Bartolo Pasin and Rogelio Chimenti, who organized the fair, proposed the construction to designer Miguel De Lisi, after seeing his work at the City Hotel in Mar del Plata.\nConstruction\nDe Lisi sent the drawings to the local construction team, led by Aldo Humberto Cardozo and Alberto Sartor. The monument had been originally planned to be  tall, but Cardozo re-scaled it to be nearly , and later also added a high base of . The completed monument, now standing at almost 13 metres (42.4&nbsp;ft), depicts a native who is holding a long spear while watching the horizon.\nWork started in July 1964, with the structure being built of reinforced concrete. It had an iron skeleton made up of 4 inch pipes (100mm), which was reinforced with radial sections that were soldered every . Later, the figure was filled from the feet to the hips with ceramic brick and concrete, with the top half finished using a layer of reinforced concrete. The monument was completed in two months with an estimated weight of 80 tons, and a height of . In its construction, five hundred bags of cement,  of iron,  of steel, and  of sand were used.\nIt was later painted by a local man, Carlos Basabe Cerdá. The job proved to be very difficult due to strong winds that blew the wooden planks off the scaffolding and into a nearby ditch. A construction team later tied on the planks, solving the problem. The painters first applied  a primer coat, then linseed oil, varnish, and finally a coat of copper glitter. The monument was inaugurated during the opening of the Comahue National Fair on September 7, 1964.\nThe monument and Villa Regina\nThe structure is located on the northern hill of the town, which has an elevation of 70 to 80 metres (230 to 260 feet). The hill is mostly covered in bushes and can be accessed by two paths. Currently it is used as an overlook for its panoramic view of the town. It also serves to mark the finishing line for the annual trekking trail competition, Desafío al Indio Comahue.\nConsidered as the symbol of Villa Regina, the Indio Comahue is depicted in the city's coat of arms. It was also depicted in the previous seal of the Río Negro Province, designed by the  government of the Argentine Revolution. The seal was replaced in 2009 by the one that the overthrown government designed in 1966, months before the coup d'état. The Comahue National Fair was relaunched in 2004, and is currently  celebrated every two years.\nOn October 23, 2018, the Rio Negro provincial legislature passed law 5320 that declared the Indio Comahue a historical monument in accordance to the law 3656 for \"Protection and Conservation of the Cultural Patrimony of the Río Negro Province\". Meanwhile, two propositions were presented at the Argentine Senate to declare it a National Historical Monument in 2016 and 2018 respectively. In 2019, plots of land on the northern hill that included the location of the monument were subject to a lawsuit by lawyers that requested the municipality to auction them off for the settlement of unpaid fees. The dispute resulted from a previous lawsuit that granted an architect the rights to develop a housing project. To avoid danger to the monument, Municipal prosecutor Juan Carlos Giménez presented the judge the existing protection declaration by the Villa Regina municipal council, the Río Negro Province and the existing projects at the Argentine Senate.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
