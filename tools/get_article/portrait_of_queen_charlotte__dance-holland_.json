It depicts the German-born Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, queen consort of the British monarch George III.\nDance-Holland spent more than a decade in Italy before returning to Britain where he became a noted portraitist. He was a founder member of the Royal Academy and chose to exhibit this and a portrait of George III at the  inaugural Royal Academy Exhibition of 1769 at Pall Mall. Both paintings are now in the collection of the National Trust at Uppark House in West Sussex.\nSee also\n* Portrait of Queen Charlotte, a 1789 portrait by Thomas Lawrence\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Gott, Ted & Benson, Laurie.
