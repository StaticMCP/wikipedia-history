      "text": "# Theodore Aylward Sr.\n\nTheodore Aylward (1730–1801) was an English composer and organist. He was a member of the Royal Society of Musicians in 1763 and gained a prize medal from the Catch Club in 1769. He was organist successively of St Lawrence Jewry and St Michael, Cornhill (1769–1781), in London, and of St. George's Chapel, Windsor (1788–1801). As well as these appointments, he was the Gresham Professor of Music (1771–1801). During his lifetime he composed musical dramas, songs, canzonets and glees.\nHaving died in London on 27 February, 1801, Aylward was buried in St George's Chapel, leaving behind a family line of musicians. The composer is sometimes confused with his namesake and great-great nephew, Theodore Aylward Jr., sometime Organist & Master of the Choristers of Chichester Cathedral.[https://books.google.com/books?id=PiQ8AAAACAAJ Organs and Organists of Chichester Cathedral]\nReferences\n*\n* James B.
