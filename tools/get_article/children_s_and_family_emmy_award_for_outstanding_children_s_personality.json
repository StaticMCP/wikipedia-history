The current holder of the award is Meryl Streep, who won at the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards for her reading of \"The Three Questions\" on Storyline Online. The category received its current name at the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards. While both the Daytime and Primetime Emmy Awards have honored hosting with various categories, there has never been an award specifically dedicated to hosting in children's programming until the establishment of this category.\nWinners and nominations\nOutstanding Host\n.]]\n.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  width=\"85%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n!
