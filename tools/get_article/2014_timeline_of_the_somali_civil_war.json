      "text": "# 2014 timeline of the Somali Civil War\n\nThis is a 2014 timeline of events in the Somali Civil War (2009–present).\nJanuary\nJanuary 1\n* Hundreds of Ethiopian troops backed by armored vehicles and tanks enter Baidoa, the capital of Bay region, establishing new military bases in the city's main entrance and in a factory \"to assist the Somali government to root out al-Shabab in 2014 from the entire country\", according to Bay's Deputy Governor Mr. Shine Moalim Nurow. An unknown number of Ethiopian troops were already in Somalia over the past three years. In 2014, Ethiopian troops are set to join the African Union Mission (AMISOM), which is set to expand from 17,731 to 22,126 troops.\n* At least 11 people were killed and 17 injured in a bomb attack at the Jazeera Hotel in one of the most secure areas of Mogadishu. The first two bombs came in quick succession and were followed by gunfire from Somali security forces. The third blast took place about an hour later when a bomb went off inside a car that was being searched by the military. The attack happened less than 24 hours after warnings by Al Shabaab spokesman Abdulaziz Musab who called upon Somali citizens to avoid social areas and important government installations referring to possible attacks by the group in the New Year. It was claimed by the organisation a day later, saying that it targeted \"a meeting of senior 'apostate' intelligence officials\". The attack killed two police commanders (Mursal Showre and Abdikani Ahmed Ga’al) and was publicly condemned by i.a. France, the UK, the UN Security Council and by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.\n* Al Shabaab arrests between 10 and \"dozens\" aid workers of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in Buale and Sako, the major towns in the Middle Juba region, claiming that they work as under cover intelligence for their opponents.\n* As hundreds of families displaced by recent inter-clan conflicts in Middle Shabelle region have sought shelter in makeshift camps in Jowhar airport, Middle Shabelle administration officials and traditional elders call for peaceful coexistence between the various clans in the region. Middle Shabelle Governor, Abdi Jinow Alasow, calls on the inhabitants of Geedo-Berkaan (7&nbsp;km northeast of Jowhar) to avoid further recurrence of inter-clan conflicts.\nJanuary 4\n* 600 new recruits join Somalia's National Army after four months of military training at Dhusamareb's 21st military training base (in Galguduud region). Colonel Sulub Ahmed Dirie addressed the graduation ceremony saying the 600 were ready to defend their country from \"invading terrorists\".\n* In the vicinity of Buur-Hakaba (Bay region), an official from the World Health Organization is kidnapped by al-Shabaab and abducted to Dinsoor.\nJanuary 6\n* Hundreds of families who were internally displaced by recent conflicts in Middle Shabelle region are being resettled back to their homes by the regional administration in collaboration with Jowhar district officials. More than 140 families are resettled in Sabun area, two months after they sought shelter in a makeshift camp near Jowhar airport.\nJanuary 8\n*Al-Shabaab announces that it is banning wireless Internet in the areas of Somalia that it controls. Internet Service Providers were given 15 days to terminate their service and warned of sanctions if they did not comply. The militants elaborated that they would tolerate internet access via cable but not by satellite. The insurgent group is on Reporters Without Borders' list of \"Predators of Freedom of Information\", and regards internet use as a form of spying.\nJanuary 9\n*On January 9, the Kenyan Defense Force launched three air strikes from an F-5 jet at an al-Shabaab gathering in Gedo province. The attack was intended to kill al-Shabaab's leader, Ahmed Godane, and killed 57 militants (including 6 key commanders), wounded 120 more, and destroyed eight vehicles used by the militant group. The air strike came after AMISOM received intelligence regarding the location of Ahmed Godane, who left the meeting a mere thirty minutes before the attack.\nJanuary 10\n*Col. Tom Davis, a spokesman for the United States Africa Command, announces that the U.S. has established a military coordination cell in Mogadishu. The deployment came at the request of the Somali government and AMISOM, who approached Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel about the move in September 2013. According to Davis, the cell consists of a small team of advisers rather than combat troops, and also includes planners and communicators between the Somali authorities and AMISOM. It is intended to provide consultative and planning support to the allied forces in order to enhance their capacity and to promote peace and security throughout the country and wider region. The coordination cell's formation is open-ended, with rotating personnel. Members reportedly first started to arrive in October to organize their office and living spaces at the capital's main airport. According to a defense official, the unit has a staff of fewer than five personnel and became fully operational in Mogadishu by mid-December 2013. A few days later, Al Shabaab commander Sheikh Ali Jabal in a voice recording posted online vowed that the group would attack the new US Forces in Mogadishu.\nJanuary 13\n* Officials of the Hiran region successfully broker a peace pact between warring clans in the Defow, Kabhanley and Jerrey areas in Hiran region after three days of intense negotiations.\n* Government officials in Gedo region state that seven Al Shabaab fighters have defected and surrendered to them. Two months earlier, government officials had publicly announced that any al Shabaab defector would be given a full amnesty to minimize number of Somali youth lured by the group. Since then, three to ten surrender each month, according to Col. Abbas Gurey, government military officer in Gedo.\nJanuary 14\n* Abdullahi Dalas, a well-known militant Al Shabaab officer in the Juba region, surrenders himself to the Afmadow District authorities in Lower Juba.\n* Fighting erupts at night after al-Shabaab launches an assault on government bases at Burane and Mahaday, two strategic towns near Jowhar, the provincial capital of Middle Shabelle region. At least 15 people are killed during the ambush attack, 6 of them Somali soldiers. Both sides exchange heavy and small firearms in the pitch combat, while reports claim that al-Shabaab destroyed Somali government military facilities in Mahaday. Before daybreak, the government troops backed by African Union forces secure the towns, and repel the al-Shabaab fighters from the area following a fierce counter-attack.\nJanuary 22\n* At a ceremony in Baidoa, (Bay region), 4,395 troops from the Ethiopian National Defence Forces (ENDF) are integrated into the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). This ceremony follows the adoption of Security Council resolution 2124(2013) of 12 November 2013 which allows AMISOM to expand from 17,731 to 22,126 troops and acceptance of Ethiopia's offer to the African Union to deploy its troops in Somalia under AMISOM. The Ethiopian troops will work alongside the Somalia National Army (SNA) in the Gedo, Bay and Bakool regions, and will be commanded by an Ethiopian sector commander who will in turn report to the AMISOM Force Commander, Lt. General Silas Ntigurirwa. The Ethiopian addition to AMISOM will free up other units to stage a long-awaited offensive on al-Shabaab bases in the far southern regions of Lower and Middle Shebelle, with Kenyan units advancing from the south, and Uganda and Burundi pressing from the north. AMISOM has remained largely still for around a year, hampered by limited troops and air power. The al-Shabaab controlled port of Baraawe, one of the last sea access routes for the extremists, is a key target for the force.\n* The local administration of Middle Shebelle region in Somalia imposes a night-time curfew in Jowhar, the regional capital. Bomb explosions and grenade attacks escalated in the town the weeks before and regional inter-clan conflicts occurred in the previous months, leading to local displacements of villagers. See also the entries of January 1 and 6.\nJanuary 26\n*Sahal Iskudhuq, a senior al-Shabaab commander and confidant of the militant group's spiritual leader, is killed between Barawe and Sablale in Somalia's southern Lower Shabelle region. Abu Mohamed, a leader within the insurgent outfit, indicates that Iskudhuq and his driver died when the vehicle they were in was struck by a drone missile. Mohamed blames U.S. authorities for the attack, with two American military officials later in the day confirming the missile strike. However, the representatives do not specify the target of the operation, and one of the officials indicates that U.S. intelligence was still ascertaining just how efficacious the strike had been. Somalia's presidential office concurrently issues a press statement welcoming the drone attack by its U.S. partner. Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed also suggests via Twitter that the missile strike would serve as an effective deterrent against the arrival of additional jihadists, and would impede attempts by the militants to impose a blockade locally.\nFebruary\nFebruary 5\n*Somali military forces assisted by AMISOM troops move into new areas in Lower Shabeelle. According to the regional governor Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur, government forces dislodged al-Shabaab militants from Jilib, Dhanane and Gendershe vicinities. The offensive is part of a martial clean-up operation prepared over the previous three days, which saw federal troops secure Merca's outskirts, including a main road linking the city to the capital. Nur indicates that two government soldiers were wounded during the activities, with a search operation underway to capture any remaining al-Shabaab insurgents.\nFebruary 7\n*Somali government forces from the Jubba region supported by AMISOM troops launch a surprise attack on an al-Shabaab outpost in Hagar, a town situated 50&nbsp;km north of Afmadow. The joint forces dismantle the insurgent base during the operation, with seven militants reportedly killed. The troops also recover an assortment of ammunitions, one Suzuki escudo vehicle, and some communications equipment.\nFebruary 15\n*Al-Shabaab militants reportedly vacate Hudur in the southwestern Bakool region ahead of a joint assault by Somali government forces and AMISOM troops.

Al-Shabaab members  also instructed local residents to leave the town as Ethiopian forces are invading.\nFebruary 21\n*Al-Shabaab militants launch a surprise attack on Villa Somalia, when a car loaded with heavy explosives rammed into the concrete barrier surrounding the perimeter of the palace. A group of nine armed men penetrate the area where the first bomb hit. All of the attackers were carrying suicide vests and fought a lengthy gun-battle with presidential guards inside the compound. The assault ended when Somali government troops and AMISOM forces reinforced presidential guards in retaking several key buildings. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud is unharmed. Government casualties are estimated at five palace guards killed, including the deputy intelligence chief Mohamed Nur Shirbow and Mohamed Abdulle, a close aide to the prime minister. All nine of the attackers were later found and confirmed dead.\nMarch\nMarch 6\n*Somali forces and their Ethiopian AMISOM allies capture Rabdhure in the southwestern Bakool region, a key al-Shabaab stronghold. Witnesses report the arrival in the town of Ethiopian infantrymen and battle tanks, as residents vacate their households ahead of the allied offensive. According to Somali federal government officials, dozens of al-Shabaab insurgents are killed in the ensuing battle, with early reports putting the figure at 12 dead militants. Casualty figures for the Somali army soldiers and AMISOM troops are as yet unconfirmed. The insurgent group had previously used the town and its environs as a base from which to launch attacks. Additionally, an al-Shabaab spokesman confirms that an intense battle for control of Rabhure took place, but does not elaborate on the seizure of the town. He also asserts that the militants managed to fight off an attack on their bases. The allied forces continue their march toward Hudur.\n*Somali government forces and allied Ethiopian troops clash with al-Shabaab insurgents in the village of Teed, situated around 30&nbsp;km from Hudur. According to the Bakool regional administration, 12 fighters on both sides are confirmed dead.\nMarch 7\n*Somali government forces assisted by Ethiopian troops capture Hudur, the capital of the southern Bakool province, from al-Shabaab militants. The insurgent group had seized control of the town about a year earlier, following a surprise withdrawal by Ethiopian troops. Hudur since that time served as the militant outfit's largest remaining stronghold. Additionally, AMISOM confirms on Twitter that the allied forces have seized the town. According to AMISOM spokesman Colonel Ali Aden Houmed, the al-Shabaab militants retreated after attempting to engage the allied forces, with three Somali army soldiers incurring minor injuries and no AMISOM casualties. Hudur's Mayor Mohamed Moallim Ahmed also announces that Somali soldiers and Ethiopian AMISOM troops are conducting door-to-door investigations in a joint security operation, with a number of suspects apprehended.\nMarch 9\n*Somali government forces assisted by an Ethiopian battalion with AMISOM captured Wajid District in the southern Bakool province. According to the district Governor Abdullahi Yarisow, the siege took a few hours and local residents welcomed the allied forces. He did not specify any casualties.\n*Somali government troops assisted by AMISOM soldiers engage al-Shabaab militants in a gun battle on the outskirts of Burdhubo in the southern Gedo province. It is the second largest of the remaining towns in the region that are under al-Shabaab control. According to a senior Somali military officer stationed in the province, Col. Abdi Bule Abdi, the allied forces captured three of the insurgents during the operation. The official also indicates that they killed at least six other fighters, but declines to comment on casualties by the joint Somali and AMISOM troops. The militant commanders and their fighters subsequently begin vacating the town proper as the allied forces draw near. Many civilians had already fled the area ahead of the offensive, which Gedo Governor Mohamed Abdi Kali attributes to coercion by the insurgents. Kalil adds that the allied forces are positioned around 2&nbsp;km from Burdhubo and are prepared to enter it within a few hours. According to the Governor, the Somali and AMISOM troops will then march toward Bardera, al-Shabaab's largest remaining stronghold and a place of residence of several of its senior commanders. Within a few hours, the allied forces capture Burdhubo.\nMarch 10\n*Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops engage in a gun battle with al-Shabaab militants on the outskirts of Barawe and Qoryoley.

Situated in the Hiran region, the town was the insurgent group's strongest base in central Somalia. According to the tenth Somali national army contingent commissioner, Colonel Mohamed Ammin, the militants vacated Bulobarte thereby allowing the allied forces to seize control of the area. He adds that Somali government soldiers and AMISOM forces are now headed toward the other parts of the region under insurgent control, with the joint troops expecting to remove the militants altogether from Hiran over the next few days. Additionally, the allied forces seize control of Buqdaaqable; the insurgents mount no resistance. The town is located around 90&nbsp;km from Beledweyne, Hiran's capital. The Somali army forces and AMISOM troops also capture the towns of Weel Dheyn and Ted in the Bay and Bakool regions in Sector 3.\nMarch 15\n*The U.S. Department of State begins offering bounties of up to $3 million apiece for information leading to the arrest or conviction of the al-Shabaab senior members Abdikadir Mohamed Abdikadir, Yasin Kilwe and Jafar. According to State Department officials, Abdikadir coordinates al-Shabaab's recruitment activities in Kenya, with Jafar acting as his deputy; Kilwe serves as al-Shabaab Emir for the northeastern Puntland region. The bounties are part of the \"Rewards for Justice\" program, wherein money is issued for leads on terror suspects.\nMarch 16\n*Somali military forces assisted by AMISOM troops capture Warsheikh from al-Shabaab.

Jama Saed Warsame (Afgadud), is killed in an al-Shabaab ambush near Bosaso. Reports initially suggest that he was targeted by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) planted on the main road between Bosaso and Laag village, situated around 27&nbsp;km away. However, independent sources later indicate that al-Shabaab gunmen opened fire on the armored vehicle in which Warsame was traveling, in the process wounding the commander and one of his bodyguards and killing another member of his security detail.

However, Barre vows to offer no amnesty to the militant group's senior commanders, whom he instead states will be commensurately prosecuted under the law.\n*Somali military forces assisted by AMISOM troops capture Qoryoley after intensive fighting with al-Shabaab militants. According to residents, at least four civilians are killed during the heavy gun battle after a mortar shell strikes their house.

Seizure of Qoryoley facilitates the allied forces' plans to capture the port city of Barawe, which serves as one of al-Shabaab's last remaining revenue bases. The joint operations by the Somali army and AMISOM troops have liberated eight towns within the month, including most recently Qurunlow in the Middle Shabelle province.

He adds that U.S. security personnel have not discerned any civilian casualties, and that they are still gauging the strike's relative impact.
