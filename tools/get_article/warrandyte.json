It is built on the lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Woiworung language group of the Kulin Nation. Warrandyte recorded a population of 5,541 at the .\nWarrandyte is bounded in the west by the Mullum Mullum Creek and Target Road, in the north by the Yarra River, in the east by Jumping Creek and Anzac Road, and in the south by an irregular line from Reynolds Road, north of Donvale, Park Orchards and Warrandyte South.\nWarrandyte was founded as a Victorian town, located in the once gold-rich rolling hills east of Melbourne, and is now on the north-eastern boundary of suburban Melbourne. Gold was first discovered in the town in 1851 and together, with towns like Bendigo and Ballarat, led the way in gold discoveries during the Victorian gold rush. Today Warrandyte retains much of its past in its surviving buildings of the Colonial period and remains a twin community with North Warrandyte, which borders the Yarra River to its north.\nEtymology\nIn Australian Aboriginal mythology (see dreamtime), a Wurundjeri dreamtime story tells of a great eagle; \"the all powerful, ever watchful creator of the world\", named Bunjil, who \"once gazed down upon his people from the star Altair and saw their wrong doing. Awaiting their return, with a mighty crash of thunder, he hurled down a star to destroy them\". Where the star struck created a gorge in which much of the town today is located. Bunjil's people remembered the spot, and referred to it as Warrandyte, speculated to mean \"that which is thrown\".\nHistory\nIn 1851, gold was first discovered in Victoria, in Warrandyte, at Anderson's Creek, by Louis Michel, the approximate location of the site is marked by a cairn on Fourth Hill, in the Warrandyte State Park. While some mining did occur in the area throughout the peak of the gold rush, it was not until the late 19th century, after gold discoveries reduced in the more popular regions, that the area around Warrandyte was intensively mined, particularly around Fourth Hill and Whipstick Gully. Some areas continued to be mined up until the 1960s. The Warrandyte Post Office opened on 1 August 1857.\n, The Road to Warrandyte, ca. 1905–1910]]\nIn the early 20th century, Warrandyte (mainly now North Warrandyte) became a popular destination for artists of the Heidelberg School, who sought subject matter further into the bush. This led to the development of an artists camp and small colony. Though not as substantial as the older colonies at Heidelberg and Box Hill, several artists, such as Clara Southern and Walter Withers, who were associated with the Heidelberg School, took up residence in Warrandyte. Others followed, including Penleigh Boyd, Harold Herbert, Jo Sweatman and Gus McLaren, all of North Warrandyte.\nBushfires\nMajor bushfires have swept through Warrandyte throughout history, and the town was at the centre of the Black Friday bushfires in 1939, in which 71 people lost their lives. The 1962 fires also devastated North Warrandyte. Many houses were destroyed and many lives lost. In 2009 the Black Saturday fires in Kinglake were 15 minutes away from North Warrandyte. On 9 February 2014, a bushfire broke out in Warrandyte burning approximately 10 hectares and destroying 3 houses. Major bushfires to have swept through Warrandyte include:\n*1851 - 6 February \"Black Thursday\"\n*1939 - 13 January \"Black Friday\"\n*1962 -  14–16 January\n*2014 - 9 February\nGeography\nwas created by gold miners during the gold rush to divert the Yarra River]]\nWarrandyte is situated on the southern banks of the Yarra River. The river and hills surrounding the town were once rich in gold and the ruins of mineshafts and tunnels can be found throughout the Warrandyte State Park, amongst other locations. While the central town itself is nestled into a gorge on the river, the suburb covers a reasonably large area of land and can be divided up into the following sections:\nCentral Warrandyte comprises the main street of Ringwood-Warrandyte Road and Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road (Yarra Street), Pound Bend and the southern banks of the Yarra River.\nAndersons Creek flows from neighbouring South Warrandyte and Warranwood into the Yarra just before the beginning of Pound Bend. This area is where several gullies converge and create a geographical hole, with Fourth Hill to the east and the hills on the eastern banks of the Mullum Mullum Creek to the west. This becomes evident when driving through Warrandyte on Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road, as the hills guide the road down towards Andersons Creek.\nThe Eastern banks of the Mullum Mullum Creek were home to vast orchards overflowing from neighbouring East Doncaster and as a result, much of the vegetation has been cleared. Today the area is covered in large residential properties due to local council regulations allowing land to be subdivided into larger sites.\nTransportation\nWarrandyte is serviced primarily by the private car, however a bus service actively operates along the main roads of Ringwood-Warrandyte Road and Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road (Yarra Street).\nCommunity\nby the banks of the Yarra River]] The Pottery Expo at Warrandyte was instigated by local studio potter, Jane Annois in February 2001. It is now an annual event run each February, showcasing the work of selected studio ceramic artists from around Australia, along with international guest artists. Ceramicists who have exhibited in previous Expos include: Arnaud Barraud, Kevin Boyd, Csongvay Blackwood, Greg Daly, Janet DeBoos, Minna Graham, Ted Secombe and Prue Venables.\nThe Warrandyte Festival, one of the last remaining volunteer-run festivals in Victoria, is held every year in mid March. Typically, the festival features a variety of attractions. Many stalls sell local produce or crafts and there are numerous historical exhibits, as well as safety demonstrations by the CFA.\nWarrandyte is serviced by the community newspaper Warrandyte Diary. The Diary was established in 1970 by local screenwriter Cliff Green, journalist Lee Tindale and cartoonist Jock Macneish. The Diary has provided news, information and entertainment to Warrandyte and its surrounding communities for more than 50 years.\nFacilities\nWarrandyte has a general post office, tennis courts, a community centre, an RSL club, bed and breakfasts, restaurants, a police station, a CFA fire station, two kindergartens, two recreational ovals (AFL Football and Cricket), Andersons Creek Cemetery and a Scout hall, canoe launching ramps, a skatepark, nurseries and tearooms and the Crystal Brook Holiday Centre.
