As a boy he attended the Royal Hibernian Military School in Dublin. He was 21 years old, and a private in the 12th Battalion, The Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own), British Army during the First World War, and was awarded the VC for his deeds on 26 September 1916 in the Battle of Thiepval Ridge at Thiepval, France:\npart of the line was held up by machine-gun fire and all the officers had become casualties. There was confusion and indication of retirement. Private Edwards, grasping the situation and on his own initiative, dashed out towards the gun, which he knocked out with his bombs. This very gallant act, coupled with great presence of mind and disregard of personal danger, made further advance possible and cleared up a dangerous situation.\nHe was later promoted to corporal and after leaving the British Army he was forced to sell his medal to make ends meet. He died on 9 March 1964 at the Royal Star and Garter Home in Richmond (then in Surrey, now in London) and is buried in Richmond Cemetery.\nHis Victoria Cross was displayed at the National Army Museum, Chelsea, England.\nIn popular culture\nEdwards was portrayed by Adam Webb in the 2006 BBC docudrama The Somme – From Defeat to Victory, a film made to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme.\nReferences\nSources\nListed in order of publication year\n*The Register of the Victoria Cross (1981, 1988 and 1997)\n*\n*''Ireland's VCs  (Department of Economic Development, 1995)\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041204085907/http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/surrey.htm Stewart, Iain (23 November 2004.
