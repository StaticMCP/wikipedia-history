It dissolved in 1997.\nCareer\nBennis is a graduate of New York's Fashion Institute of Technology. In 1972 Bennis and Edwards had the opportunity to purchase the New York outlet of The Chelsea Cobbler, a British shoe brand founded in 1967 by Richard Smith and Mandy Wilkins. At the time, Bennis and Edwards hoped to combine their clothing designs (marketed under the name Kiss) with Chelsea Cobbler's footwear,  but quickly decided to focus exclusively on their own shoe designs, which they had made in Italy. By 1980, the Susan Bennis/Warren Edwards brand was known for expensive shoes with \"outrageous\" design elements such as unexpected material combinations, loud fabric prints, and elaborate decoration.\nSusan Bennis/Warren Edwards clients included Bruce Springsteen, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and Cher, who wore their shoes in Moonstruck. They maintained exclusivity by refusing to wholesale their shoes, selling only through their own shops at first. In 1993, they granted the department store Henri Bendel permission to retail their shoes and handbags, including a large number of store exclusives, although it had been reported a couple of years earlier by ''Women's Wear Daily that Neiman Marcus would market their line.\nIn 1990 Bennis and Edwards moved their flagship store to West 57th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in New York City. It closed down in 1997, the same year the company disbanded.\nFollowing the closure, Warren Edwards went solo the following year, opening a shop on Park Avenue, New York, where he was still based in 2010. In 2000, he was specialising in slightly modified classic styles of business and business-casual footwear for New York professionals.\nAwards\nThe firm won a Coty Award in 1982, and the Cutty Sark Award in 1984.\nExhibitions\nExamples of Susan Bennis/Warren Edwards'' shoes are housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, who also hold some of their handbags.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n: Agins, Teri. \"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=20081109&id=4oo0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=YaIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1176,4322584 New shoes leave women falling head over heels],\" The Wall Street Journal, reprinted in The Reading Eagle, November 9, 2008.\n: Author Unknown. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/15/magazine/fashion-who-s-who-in-high-style-shoe-design.html Fashion; Who's Who in High-Style Shoe Design],\" The New York Times, February 15, 1981.\n: Lee, Georgia. \"Bennis/Edwards Going Into Wider Retail Orbit,\" Footwear News, June 3, 1991.\n: McNally, Pamela. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20140611071000/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-8785623.html Bennis, Edwards Plan Move in NY With Coast to Follow],\" Footwear News, March 1990.\n: McNally, Pamela. \"New York Footwear Stores That Are On Worth-Seeing List,\" Footwear News, February 1991.\n: Petzke, Diane. \"The Scourge of Walls and Subways Enters the World of Haute Couture,\" The Wall Street Journal, September 13, 1984."
