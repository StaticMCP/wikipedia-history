Vast numbers of domains were added to its empire in Central and Eastern Europe and Western Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740, and again between 1745 and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. The house also produced kings of Bohemia, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Portugal, Spain, England and Ireland, as well as rulers of Dutch and Italian principalities amongst others.\nThe Austrian Empire was declared as the Holy Roman Empire dissolved itself and became a successor state. The former Holy Roman Emperor Francis II became the Emperor of Austria. In accordance with tradition and the titles that were already held, he promulgated the grand title to codify the most important monarchical titles of vast numbers of countries and territories under Habsburg rule, and also of titular rulers of former possessions. With the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 the grand title was again slightly modified. Although the Austrian emperor was also the nominal head of the German Confederation, this was not included in the grand title.\nThe grand title was not a complete listing of all the titles held; instead it ends with an etc. twice. There were also a middle title and a small title. The empress was also given the feminine version of the title.\nGrand title\nThe full title (in German) of the Austro-Hungarian monarch as of 1914 was:\nwhich translates to:\nExplanation of the individual titles listed in the grand title in their order\nEmperor of Austria\nIn 1804 Holy Roman Emperor Francis II foresaw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, so he sought to preserve his family's imperial status by creating the new title \"Hereditary Emperor of Austria\".\nApostolic King of Hungary, King of Bohemia\nThe kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia were originally elective monarchies, but like many elective monarchies heredity was followed.

The first prayer started with the feminine form of the grand title: \"Zita, Empress of Austria, crowned Queen of Hungary, Queen of Bohemia ...\". In the list of ducal titles, the title of Duchess of Parma claimed by the Habsburgs was omitted, as she had a closer tie to Parma. Her father, Robert of Parma, was the last Duke of Parma (1854-1860) and as a pretender to that title she was a princess, even though she was not born until 1892. Thus the title ended with \"Infanta of Spain, Princess of Portugal and of Parma\".\nZita's son Otto von Habsburg was buried on 16 July 2011, and a prayer was said in the mausoleum: \"Otto of Austria, first Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, royal prince of Hungary and Bohemia ...\" The titles of King of Jerusalem and Archduke of Austria were omitted. No Austrian emperor was actually sovereign over Jerusalem, and in 1961 Otto had renounced all claims of sovereignty in the Republic of Austria.\nSee also\n*List of rulers of Austria\n*List of Austrian consorts\n*List of heirs to the Austrian throne\n*History of Austria\nNotes"
