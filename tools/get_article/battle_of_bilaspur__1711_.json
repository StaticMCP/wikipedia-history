His campaign began with an assault on Raja Ajmer Chand—a man who had long been a persistent irritant to Guru Govind Singh and had played a major role in the military campaigns led by both the hill chiefs and the imperial forces from Sirhind and Lahore against the Guru, Raja Ajmer Chand, along with other local hill rulers, had taken measures to reinforce the city’s defenses in anticipation of conflict.Despite these preparations and the determined resistance led by Raja Ajmer Chand and his coalition of allies, the fortified position at Bilaspur could not withstand the forceful advance of the Sikh army. In the ensuing battle, over thirteen hundred Mians—comprising both regular troops and irregular forces—were completely defeated. Their bodies were methodically gathered into groups of one hundred and interred in thirteen long ditches. As a consequence of this decisive victory, Bilaspur fell to the Sikhs, and they seized a substantial amount of treasure from the town.\nAftermath\nThe crushing defeat not only weakened the Raja of Kahlur and his allies, but also struck fear into the hearts of other Rajput chieftains in the Shiwaliks, who dreaded the harsh retribution that might follow if they opposed the advancing Khalsa. As a result, many chose to avoid further bloodshed by surrendering to Banda Singh, joining the Sikh camp, pledging their loyalty, and offering tribute to the Sikh treasury. Both Kulu and Chamba submitted on their own, and Udai Singh of Chamba further solidified his commitment by marrying his daughter, Susheel Kaur, to Banda Singh Bahadur, whose striking beauty—with large eyes, imposing limbs, and delicate grace—evoked the very image of a goddess of love.\nSee also\n*Nihang\n*Martyrdom in Sikhism\nReferences"
