The Russians anchored just outside the Kerch Strait and sailed toward Kerch the next day. Vasily Chichagov took part in this action.\nOn 9 July, the Ottomans, needing to destroy the Russian ships so their land army could cross the Kerch Strait, attacked, but abandoned the effort after it was found that the Russian bombs had a greater range. The Ottoman force that day consisted of 6 battleships, 7 frigates, 1 bomb and 17 galleys and xebecs.\nReferences\n*"
