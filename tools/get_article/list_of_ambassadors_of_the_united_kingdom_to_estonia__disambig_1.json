The official title is '''His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador to the Republic of Estonia'''.\nThe United Kingdom first recognised Estonian independence during the Russian Civil War, and the two countries exchanged envoys for over twenty years. The United Kingdom refused to recognise the Soviet Union's unilateral annexation of Estonia in 1940, and the de facto non-independence caused the UK to close its mission and sever diplomatic ties with Estonia as a result. In 1991, upon restoration of de facto independence, the United Kingdom reestablished diplomatic links with Estonia, and the two countries resumed their exchange of ambassadors.\nList of heads of mission\nEnvoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary\nFrom 1921 to 1940, British ministers to Latvia, based in Riga, were also accredited to Estonia and Lithuania.\n*1921&ndash;1922: Ernest Wilton\n*1922&ndash;1927: Sir Tudor Vaughan\n*1928&ndash;1930: Joseph Addison\n*1931&ndash;1934: Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen\n*1934&ndash;1937: Sir Edmund Monson, 3rd Baronet\n*1937&ndash;1940: Sir Charles Orde\n*1940: Wilfred Hansford Gallienne\nNo representation 1940&ndash;91.
