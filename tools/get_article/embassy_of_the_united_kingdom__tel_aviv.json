Simon Walters has been British Ambassador to Israel since August 2023.\nThe United Kingdom also maintains a Consulate-General in East Jerusalem, with a Consul-General not being accredited to any state, as \"an expression of [the UK] view that no state has sovereignty over Jerusalem\". The United Kingdom also has an honorary consul in Eilat.\nIn 2009, the United Kingdom planned to move the British Embassy to the Kirya Tower. However, the Foreign Office dropped these plans because the building is part-owned by Africa-Israel Investments Ltd, a company which has built in the Palestinian territories. Israel's ambassador to London said the decision was \"appeasement to those who slander Israel\".\nSee also\n*Israel–United Kingdom relations\n*List of diplomatic missions in Israel\n*List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Israel\nReferences"
