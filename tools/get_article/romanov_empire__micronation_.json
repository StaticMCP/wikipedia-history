Bakov declared himself prime minister and announced a constitution and state symbols. The empire began to issue its own passports online for 1,000 rubles (US$31), and by 2014 it claimed it had granted about 4,000 passports to citizens.\nIn June 2012, Bakov registered the Monarchist Party with the Russian Ministry of Justice, with the stated goal of restoring the monarchy to Russia in accordance with the law.\nIn the fall of 2013, Bakov's daughter Anastassia Bakova (Анастасия Бакова) was the Monarchist Party's candidate in the mayoral elections in Yekaterinburg. Anton Bakov's son Mikhail, an engineer, was a candidate for Ekaterinburg City Duma the same year for the same party.\nOn 31 March 2014, under the new name of the Imperial Throne, the micronation issued a manifesto announcing itself a sovereign nation and declaring that Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen had become its head with the title of Nicholas III, Emperor of All Russia, as a successor to Nicholas II. Emich wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin requesting land in Yekaterinburg to establish a capital with its own imperial senate. The request was denied.\nBakov has held discussions with a number of nations in attempts to purchase land and give the micronation territory under its control. As of 2017, talks with Kiribati and the Gambia were unsuccessful. Bakov also purchased a plot of land in Montenegro and held talks with Montenegrin authorities, but these talks also failed.\nBakov ran for President of Russia at 2018 Russian presidential election from the Monarchist Party. His elder son, Ilya Bakov, attempted to run for Moscow city mayor at 2018 Moscow mayoral election also from Monarchist Party. He withdrew from the race in July 2018 due to complexities in the registration process.\nReferences"
