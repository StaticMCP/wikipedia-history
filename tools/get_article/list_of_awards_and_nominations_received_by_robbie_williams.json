The prize was conceived by Popjustice founder Peter Robinson in 2003 as a reaction to what he perceived as the pompous and elitist nature of the existing Mercury Prize, which recognises the best album of the previous year, and in particular its exclusion of pop music acts in favour of those from more esoteric genres. The shortlist for the Popjustice prize is announced in September of each year and the winner named the following month, to coincide with the presentation of the Mercury Prize. Popjustice gives a token prize of £20 to the winner of its award, in contrast to the £20,000 given to the winner of the Mercury Prize.\n|-\n| 2005\n| \"Radio\"\n| rowspan=3|Best British Pop Single\n| rowspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| 2007\n| \"She's Madonna\"\n|-\n| 2013\n| \"Candy\"\nUK Music Video Awards\nThe UK Music Video Awards is an annual award ceremony founded in 2008 to recognise creativity, technical excellence and innovation in music videos and moving images for music.\n|-\n| 2010\n| \"You Know Me\"\n| rowspan=2|Best Art Direction\n| rowspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| rowspan=2|2013\n| rowspan=2|\"Goin' Crazy\"\n|-\n| Best Pop Video (UK)\nZD Awards\n' Zvukovaya Dorozhka'  (, \"sound track\") is  Russia's oldest hit parade in field of popular music.
