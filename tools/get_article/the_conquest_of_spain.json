      "text": "# The Conquest of Spain\n\nThe Conquest of Spain is a 1705 tragedy by the English writer Mary Pix. The play was published anonymously, but has been widely attributed to Pix. It was a reworking of the Jacobean tragedy ''All's Lost by Lust'' by William Rowley.  It was the first new play to be staged at John Vanbrugh's Queen's Theatre in Haymarket, opened earlier that year, and lasted for six nights.\nSet during the Moorish conquest of Spain, the play likely sought to capitalise on growing interest in the region due to the ongoing war being fought there, particularly as the previous year Allied forces had captured Gibraltar.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Burling, William J.
