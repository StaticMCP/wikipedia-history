During his reign, the Saka ksatrapas remained strong after a period of instability during the reign of Rudrasimha I.\nBiography\nHe is mainly known from his coins. Several have a date in Brahmi numerals on the reverse (such as 142 Saka Era = 220 CE). The reverse shows a three-arched hill or Chaitya, with a river, a crescent moon and the sun, within a legend in Brahmi \"Rajno Mahaksatrapasa Rudrasihaputrasa Rajno Mahaksatrapasa Rudrasenasa\", \"The great satrap Rudrasena, son of the great satrap Rudrasiha\".\nReign\nRudrasena succeeded his cousin Jivadaman, who had no sons, as a ruler of the Western Satraps.\n. 16mm, 2.2 grams. Obverse: portrait of the ruler, with pseudo-Greek legend around (..ΥΙΟΙΙΥΛΙΗΟ..) and date (, 131) to left in Brahmi. Reverse: Chaitya hill, with Brahmi legend around (starting at 1 o'clock):}}]]\nHis sister Prabhudama was perhaps married to a ruler of Vaishali. After his death, the Malavas under their king Soma re-asserted their independence from the Saka satraps.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/0100_0199/rudradamancoins/rudradamancoins.html Western Satrap coins]"
