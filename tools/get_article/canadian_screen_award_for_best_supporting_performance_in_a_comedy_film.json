It is done as part of the Canadian Screen Awards program, to honour the best supporting performance in a comedy film.\nAfter the academy announced in August 2022 that it was discontinuing its former gendered awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress, they presented only a single award for Best Supporting Performance in a Film at the 11th Canadian Screen Awards in 2023. The organization subsequently decided to increase the number of acting awards again, with the new awards separated by genre of film instead of performer gender; beginning with the 12th Canadian Screen Awards in 2024, distinct awards will now be presented for Best Supporting Performance in a Comedy Film and Best Supporting Performance in a Drama Film.\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Actor\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Film\n! style=\"width:2%;\"| Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| 2023  12th Canadian Screen Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Glenn Howerton\n| BlackBerry\n|\n|-\n| Hannah Cheesman\n| Hey, Viktor!\n| rowspan=7|\n|-\n| Charlie Gillespie\n| Suze\n|-\n| Matt Johnson\n| BlackBerry\n|-\n| Steve Laplante\n| Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person (Vampire humaniste cherche suicidaire consentant)\n|-\n| Marc-André Leclair\n| ''One Summer (Le temps d'un été)\n|-\n| Guy Nadon\n| One Summer (Le temps d'un été)''\n|-\n| Noémie O'Farrell\n| Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person (Vampire humaniste cherche suicidaire consentant)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| 2024  13th Canadian Screen Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Graham Greene\n| Seeds\n|\n|-\n| Sandrine Bisson\n| 1995\n| rowspan=7|\n|-\n| Roy Dupuis\n| Rumours\n|-\n| Danielle Fichaud\n| Universal Language (Une langue universelle)\n|-\n| Will Sasso\n| ''Deaner '89\n|-\n| Mani Soleymanlou\n| Universal Language (Une langue universelle)\n|-\n| Saba Vahedyousefi\n| Universal Language (Une langue universelle)\n|-\n| Mary Walsh\n| Deaner '89''\n|}\nReferences"
