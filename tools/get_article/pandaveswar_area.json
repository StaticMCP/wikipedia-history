As the collieries do not have individual pages, there are no links in the full screen map. However, all places in the map of the northern portion of Durgapur subdivision, placed below, are linked in the full screen map.\nCoal\nAs per the Shodhganga website, collieries in the Pandaveswar Area are: Madaipur, Mandarbani, Nutandanga, Pandaveswar, Dalurbandh, Kendra, Samla, South Samla, Khottadih, Kankartala, Dalurbandh OCP, Palasthali OCP and Gangaramchak OCP.\nAs per ECL website telephone numbers, operational collieries in the Pandaveswar Area in 2018 are: Dalurband Colliery, Khottadih OCP, Khottadih UG, Madhaipur Colliery, Manderbony Colliery, Pandaveswar Colliery and South Samla Colliery.\nMining plan\nAn overview of the proposed mining activity plan in Cluster No. 12, consisting of 15 reconstituted mines covering Pandaveswar Area, Sonpur Bazari, Jhanjra and Bankola Area as of 2016, is as follows:\n1. Pandaveswar & Dalurband underground mine and open cast project, combining Pandaveswar UG mine, Pandaveswar OC project and Dalurband UG mine & OC project, has annual production capacity of 1.47 million tonnes for UG and 2.00 mt for OC.\n2. Manderboni UG mine has annual production capacity of 0.17 mt.\n3. Madhaipur UG mine & OC patch has annual production capacity of 0.21 mt for UG mine and 0.57 mt for OC patch.\n4. Nutandanga UG mine has annual production capacity of 0.12 mt.\n5. Kendra UG mine has annual production capacity of 0.10 mt.\n6. Samla UG mine has annual production capacity of 0.12 mt.\n7. Sonpur Bazari OC project has annual production capacity of 12.00 mt.\n8. South Samla UG mine has annual production capacity of 0.11 mt.\n9. Nakrakonda and Kumardihi B UG mine & OC project, formed with the amalgamation of Nakrakonda UG mine, Nakrakonda B OC project, Nakrakonda B OC project (extension), Kumardihi B UG mine, Kumardihi B OC patch and Purushattompur OC patch, has annual production capacity of 1.12 mt for UG mine and 3.00 mt for OC project.\n10. Kumardihi A UG mine has annual capacity of 0.20 mt. Kumardihi A OC patch is exhausted and being backfilled.\n11. Jhanjra UG mine has annual production capacity of 5.00 mt.\n12. Tilaboni UG mine has annual production capacity of 2.14 mt.\n13. Shyamsundarpur UG mine has annual production capacity of 1.12 mt.\n14. Bankola UG mine has annual production capacity of 0.30 mt. Bankola OC patch is exhausted and being backfilled.\n15. Khottadih UG mine and OC project has annual production capacity of 0.90 mt for UG mine and 2.20 mt for OC project.\nNote: Mandermoni Extension/ Rangamati A UGP and Madhaipur Extension/ Rangamati B UGP are not viable in the present time.\nSubsidence\nTraditionally many underground collieries have left a void after taking out the coal. As a result, almost all areas are facing subsidence. As per CMPDIL, there were 6 points of subsidence in the Pandaveswar Area involving 49.62 hectares of land.\nMigrants\nPrior to the advent of coal mining, the entire region was a low-productive rice crop area in what was once a part of the Jungle Mahals. The ownership of land had passed on from local adivasis to agricultural castes before mining started. However, the Santhals and the Bauris, referred to by the colonial administrators as \"traditional coal cutters of Raniganj\" remained attached to their lost land and left the mines for agricultural related work, which also was more remunerative. It forced the mine-owners to bring in outside labour, mostly from Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh. In time the migrants dominated the mining and industrial scenario. The pauperization and alienation of the adivasis have been major points of social concern.\nTransport\nThe Andal-Sainthia branch line passes through this Area.\nNH 14 (old number NH 60) pass through the Pandaveswar Area.\nReferences"
