Several Hawkes Children's Library buildings were constructed from his advocacy and charitable work. Some of the libraries included theaters. Hawkes planned to build 100 new libraries in Georgia. He helped fund several in his will. The Hawkes Children's Library of West Point and Hawkes Children's Library (Cedartown, Georgia) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nLibraries\n*Hawkes Children's Library (West Point, Georgia)\n*Hawkes Children's Library (Cedartown, Georgia)\n*Hawkes Children's Library (Griffin, Georgia)\n*Hawkes Children's Library (Roswell, Georgia)\nReferences"
