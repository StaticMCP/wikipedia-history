On the night of 1 June 2015, the ship was traveling on the Yangtze River when it capsized during a thunderstorm in Jianli, Hubei Province with 454 people on board. On 13 June, 442 deaths were confirmed, with 12 survivors (including two rescued by officials). The passengers were mostly in their 60s and 70s, and mostly from Nanjing, where the ship started its cruise.\nThe final investigation concluded the ship navigated into a squall line (the biggest scale of thunderstorm) from 21:19 onwards, blasted by a downburst (a form of windshear) from 21:26 to 21:32, capsized at 21:31, and sank at 21:32. The ship met gusts of 32–38&nbsp;m/s (72-85&nbsp;mph, equivalent to wind force scale of 12-13). The hourly rain was observed at 94.4mm.\nIt is the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster in China's history, and the worst maritime disaster (including wartime disasters) in China's history since the steamer  sank in January 1949, killing more than 1,500.\nSinking\nAround 21:28 on 1 June 2015, Dongfang zhi Xing was making a  trip from Nanjing to Chongqing on the Yangtze River. When the ship was near Jingzhou, it was caught in a storm and sank in approximately  deep waters. The captain and the chief engineer said that the ship was hit by a tornado, and the China Meteorological Administration confirmed that a tornado occurred in Jianli County with wind-speeds reaching EF1 strength, or approximately . It was once widely believed that the tornado struck the river near the ship's location, but later investigation suggested that the tornado struck a location 8&nbsp;km away and did not affect the ship; instead, based on Doppler radar data and other evidence, the official report found that a massive downburst in the thunderstorm, with gusts over  (12–13 on the Beaufort scale), was the likely cause of the capsizing.\nPassengers and crew\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:right; margin:0 0 1.5em 1.5em;\"\n|+ Passengers on board by region\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:130px\" | Region\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | No.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Jiangsu\n| 204\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Shanghai\n| 97\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Tianjin\n| 43\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Shandong\n| 23\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Fujian\n| 19\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Zhejiang\n| 11\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Anhui\n| 8\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Total\n| 405\n|}\nInitially, the Chinese authorities reported 458 people were aboard the ship, but later reduced this figure to 456. This included 405 passengers, all of whom were Chinese and mostly elderly, 46 crew members and five tour guides. According to crew members that were rescued, the storm hit and capsized the ship quickly while most of the passengers were asleep. One rescued passenger stated that the ship had become flooded with water, and with the turbulent river conditions, capsized after experiencing a list greater than 45 degrees. Seven survivors were able to swim to shore and alert authorities about two and a half hours after capsizing. On 13 June, the Chinese authorities updated that 454, not 456, people were on board and 442 bodies had been found with 12 rescued.\nAnalysis of the incident\nSevere weather reports were issued for the area, which should have subsequently been sent to all vessels on the river in the area for them to take necessary precautions. There is no confirmation that Dongfang zhi Xing had been properly notified, though at least one other vessel travelling nearby was shown to have taken precautions due to the weather warning. The ship's captain and chief engineer, two of the rescued persons, were taken into custody for questioning.\nThe Chinese government censored news and discussion about this accident, while tightly controlling media coverage. The Politburo Standing Committee attempted to control public opinion about the disaster response, by issuing an order to both \"understand the sorrow of the families\" and \"concretely preserve social stability\".\nOn 30 December 2015, the Chinese government issued the investigation report on the incident. The report said that heavy storms caused Dongfang zhi Xing to capsize; it also found that the shipping company and local authorities had flaws in their daily management and suggested that 43 people be punished accordingly.\nShip\n{|\n| Ship operator = Chongqing Eastern Shipping Corporation (重庆东方轮船公司)\n| Ship route =  Nanjing to Chongqing\n| Ship ordered = Before 1992\n| Ship builder = Chongqing Chuandong Shipyard (重庆川东造船厂)\n| Ship original cost =\n| Ship yard number =\n| Ship way number =\n| Ship laid down =\n| Ship launched =\n| Ship completed = 1994\n| Ship acquired =\n| Ship maiden voyage = Fuling to Wanzhou\n| Ship in service = February 1994\n| Ship registry =\n| Ship out of service =1 June 2015\n| Ship identification =\n| Ship fate = Capsized and sank on 1 June 2015\n| Ship notes =\n}}\n| Ship displacement = 2,200\n| Ship length =\n| Ship beam =\n| Ship height =\n| Ship draught =\n| Ship depth =\n| Ship decks =\n| Trial length =\n| Ship power =\n| Ship propulsion =\n| Ship speed =\n| Ship capacity = 534 passengers\n| Ship crew = 46\n| Ship notes =\n}}\n|}\nMV Dongfang zhi Xing was constructed in February 1994. In 1997 the ship's length was extended by . It underwent another retrofit in 2008 that cut its capacity from 584 to 534 people. As of 2015, the ship was  long with a beam of . It was owned by the Chongqing Eastern Shipping Corporation and operated by Xiehe Travel. It made cruises in the Three Gorges area of inland China.\nDongfang zhi Xing, as well as other Yangtze River cruise ships, had come under increasing government scrutiny in recent years due to the growing tourist industry in China. In 2013, Dongfang zhi Xing and five other ships were cited for safety violations by the Nanjing maritime bureau, though the Chongqing Eastern Shipping Corporation did not comment on the nature of these infractions.\nRescue\nRescue efforts were made immediately to save the passengers and crew, reaching full scale about twelve hours after the capsizing. Eighty-two people had been confirmed dead by 4 June, with some bodies having washed ashore  downstream from the wreck. Fourteen people were rescued in the immediate aftermath, including the ship's engineer and captain.\nAccording to a tweet from China Central Television (CCTV), rescuers were able to hear the sound of people trapped inside the vessel. CCTV reported that search teams heard people yelling from within the ship. One thousand police officers from the Hubei Armed Police Corps were sent to the site with 40 inflatable boats. Authorities reported that the search and rescue effort included 3,000 people and 50 boats. Crews used both underwater approaches with diving apparatus, and above-water approaches through holes cut through the inverted hull.\nAdditional search efforts were made to locate survivors or bodies up to  downstream of the wreck. The Three Gorges Dam upriver was instructed to cut water flow rates by half in order to lower the river levels for the rescue effort.\nOn 5 June, the inverted ship was fitted with cables and nets, and the holes cut in the hull sealed, in order to right the ship and resume the search for survivors or bodies. The search yielded only bodies. The search range was subsequently expanded to  downstream on 5 June.\nThe highest levels of government were involved in the search coordination. Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang ordered rescue efforts.  Premier Li Keqiang, Vice Premier Ma Kai and State Councilor Yang Jing traveled to the site.\nMourning\nOn 7 June, more than 500 rescue workers and government officials at the site mourned during a three-minute silence, after an announcement from Minister of Transport Yang Chuantang. According to Chinese tradition, the seventh day is a key occasion to mourn the passing of the dead ().\nTo mourn the victims, all Chinese satellite television channels suspended entertainment programs from 7 to 8 June.\nSee also\n* List of shipwrecks in China\n* MV Teratai Prima\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/special/zjkljy/#_zbs_baidu_dk 图文直播：载456人客轮沉没 长江大救援！！！ (ifeng.com)]\n*[http://news.163.com/special/kelun_2015/?bdsj 载458人客轮在长江湖北段倾覆 (Netease)]\n*[http://live.sina.com.cn/zt/l/v/news/kelunqingfu/ 实时播报：全力搜救“东方之星” (Sina)]\n*[http://news.sohu.com/s2015/dongfangzhixing/?pvid=3cda0af37565999f \"东方之星\"倾覆长江 上载458人 (Sohu)]"
