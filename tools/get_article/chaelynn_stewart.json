She currently plays third on Team Nancy Martin.\nCareer\nStewart represented Saskatchewan at back-to-back Canadian Mixed Doubles Curling Championships with her boyfriend Brayden Stewart in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, the pair finished first place in their pool with a 5–2 record before losing in the quarterfinals to Chelsea Carey and Colin Hodgson. At their second appearance in 2019, they just missed the playoffs with a 4–3 record.\nStewart joined the Sherry Anderson rink for the 2019–20 season. The team had three semifinal finishes and two quarterfinal finishes on the World Curling Tour. At the 2020 Saskatchewan Scotties Tournament of Hearts, they lost in the final to Robyn Silvernagle 8–5. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Saskatchewan, the 2021 Saskatchewan Scotties Tournament of Hearts was cancelled. Since the reigning champions, Team Silvernagle, did not retain three out of four team members still playing together, Team Anderson was invited to represent Saskatchewan at the 2021 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, as they had the most points from the 2019–20 and 2020–21 seasons combined, which they accepted. At the Hearts, they finished with a 6–6 sixth place finish.\nPersonal life\nStewart is a kinesiology graduate from the University of Saskatchewan. She is married to fellow curler Brayden Stewart. She currently works as a firefighter paramedic for Brandon Fire and Emergency Services. Her father, Shane Kitz, coaches her team.\nTeams\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Season\n! scope=\"col\"| Skip\n! scope=\"col\"| Third\n! scope=\"col\"| Second\n! scope=\"col\"| Lead\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2014–15\n| Chaelynn Kitz || Rikki Schick || Taylor Marcotte || Rachel Erickson\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2015–16\n| Chaelynn Kitz || Rikki Schick || Taylor Marcotte || Rachel Erickson\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2016–17\n| Chaelynn Kitz || Rikki Schick || Rachel Erickson || Sarah Hoag\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2017–18\n| Chaelynn Kitz || Rikki Schick || Alexa Dixon || Kelsey Dixon\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2018–19\n| Chantelle Eberle || Chaelynn Kitz || Jana Tisdale || Haylee Jameson\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2019–20\n| Sherry Anderson || Nancy Martin || Meaghan Frerichs || Chaelynn Kitz\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2020–21\n| Sherry Anderson || Nancy Martin || Chaelynn Kitz || Breanne Knapp\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2021–22\n| Sherry Anderson || Nancy Martin || Chaelynn Kitz || Breanne Knapp\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2023–24\n| Robyn Silvernagle || Kelly Schafer || Chaelynn Kitz || Kara Thevenot\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2024–25\n| Nancy Martin || Chaelynn Stewart || Kadriana Lott || Deanna Doig\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2025–26\n| Nancy Martin || Chaelynn Stewart || Kadriana Lott || Christie Gamble\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
