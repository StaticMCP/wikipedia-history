Written by lead singer Zac Brown, along with Wyatt Durrette, it features guest vocals from veteran country singer Alan Jackson. The song is the sixth single release by the band, and the first from the album You Get What You Give''. It won the Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals at the 53rd Grammy Awards, and is the second Grammy for both the band and Jackson overall.\nRelease history\nThe song is the first release from the band's album You Get What You Give, which was released on September 21. John Driskell Hopkins, who plays bass guitar in the band, suggested that Jackson be included as a duet partner on it, because he thought that \"it would get a great, different kind of fan base for us.\" Both Zac Brown Band and Jackson are produced by Keith Stegall.  On August 24, 2010, an exclusive CD single was released at Target featuring \"As She's Walking Away\" along with the studio version of \"Colder Weather\" for the first time.\nBackground and writing\nCo-writer Wyatt Durrette told The Boot that the idea came when he and Brown went to a bar in Orlando, Florida to watch a UFC fight. Durrette said that while they were watching the fight a guy and a girl walked in and all night she stared at him. Durrette said that she was \"a beautiful girl, but she had her boyfriend with her, so I obviously wasn't going to say or do anything. We kind of spoke all night from across the room, but didn't say anything to each other.\" Durrette said that Brown had the idea of bringing the wise man into it and turning it into the older man at the bar who's a much wiser man, giving you advice.\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the liner notes for Jackson’s greatest hits album 34 Number Ones.\n* Zac Brown – lead vocals, acoustic guitar, producer\n* Jimmy De Martini – backing vocals, fiddle\n* Clay Cook – backing vocals, electric guitar\n* John Driskell Hopkins – backing vocals, bass guitar\n* Coy Bowles – Hammond B-3 organ\n* Chris Fryar – drums\n* Alan Jackson – lead vocals\n* Keith Stegall — producer\nCritical reception\nThe song received critical acclaim.
