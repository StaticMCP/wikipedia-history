(FSFE) is an organization that supports free software and all aspects of the free software movement in Europe, with registered chapters in several European countries. It is a registered voluntary association (German: eingetragener Verein) incorporated under German law.\nHistory\nFSFE was founded in 2001. It is the European sister organization of the USbased Free Software Foundation (FSF), although each foundation exists as a separate organization.\nIn 2010, FSFE received the Theodor Heuss Medal in recognition of its work for freedom in the information society.\nFollowing the return of Richard Stallman to the FSF in 2021, the FSFE declared themselves \"unable to collaborate\" with the FSF.\n, Germany in 2009]]\nSee also\n* European Committee for Interoperable Systems\n* OpenForum Europe\n* OpenUK\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
