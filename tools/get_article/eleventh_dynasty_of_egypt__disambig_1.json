Its earlier members before Pharaoh Mentuhotep II are grouped with the four preceding dynasties to form the First Intermediate Period, whereas the later members are considered part of the Middle Kingdom. They all ruled from Thebes in Upper Egypt.\nCharacteristics\nThe relative chronology of the 11th Dynasty is well established by contemporary attestations and, except for count Intef and Mentuhotep IV, by the Turin canon.\nManetho's statement that the 11th Dynasty consisted of 16 kings, who reigned for 43 years is contradicted by contemporary inscriptions and the evidence of the Turin King List, whose combined testimony establishes that this kingdom consisted of seven kings who ruled for a total of 143 years. However, his testimony that this dynasty was based at Thebes is verified by the contemporary evidence. It was during this dynasty that all of ancient Egypt was united under the Middle Kingdom.\nThis dynasty traces its origins to a nomarch of Thebes, \"Intef the Great, son of Iku\", who is mentioned in a number of contemporary inscriptions. However, his immediate successor Mentuhotep I is considered the first king of this dynasty.\nAn inscription carved during the reign of Wahankh Intef II shows that he was the first of this dynasty to claim to rule over the whole of Egypt, a claim which brought the Thebans into conflict with the 10th-Dynasty rulers of Herakleopolis Magna. Intef undertook several campaigns northwards, and captured the important nome of Abydos.\nWarfare continued intermittently between the Theban and Heracleapolitan dynasts until shortly before the 39th regnal year of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II, when the Herakleopolitans were defeated, and this dynasty could begin to consolidate their rule. The rulers of the 11th Dynasty reasserted Egypt's influence over her neighbors in Africa and the Near East. Mentuhotep II sent renewed expeditions to Phoenicia to obtain cedar. Sankhkare Mentuhotep III sent an expedition from Coptos south to the land of Punt.\nThe reign of its last king, and thus the end of this dynasty, is something of a mystery. Contemporary records refer to \"seven empty years\" following the death of Mentuhotep III, which correspond to the reign of Nebtawyre Mentuhotep IV. Modern scholars identify his vizier Amenemhat with Amenemhat I, the first king of 12th Dynasty, as part of a theory that Amenemhat became king as part of a palace coup. The only certain details of Mentuhotep's reign was that two remarkable omens were witnessed at the quarry of Wadi Hammamat by the vizier Amenemhat. Nobody knows for certain how Amenemhat I rose to power and became the next pharaoh.\nRulers of the Eleventh Dynasty\nInitially the rulers of the Eleventh Dynasty were only Nomarchs but starting during the reign of Intef I they declared themselves pharaohs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\" | style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; width: 65%\"\n|+Nomarchs of Dynasty XI\n!|Nomarchs!!

The Karnak King List provides the most complete surviving list of names for the eleventh dynasty, beginning with the nomarch Intef the Elder, whose name is the only one on this list that does not have a cartouche because he never reigned as Pharaoh, and ending with Mentuhotep IV, one of the few lists to include him. Several names are lost and damaged, but can still be reconstructed.\nThe Turin King List begins this dynasty with Mentuhotep I and provides reign lengths for individual kings, however it is in a fragmentary state and some information is now lost. Mentuhotep IV is not mentioned at all, but the list does note \"a lacuna of 7 years\" following Mentuhotep III.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Historical Nomarch or Pharaoh\n!Karnak King List\n!Abydos King List\n!Saqqara Tablet\n!Turin King List\n!Turin Reign Lengths\n|-\n|Intef the Elder\n|Intef\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|–\n|-\n|Mentuhotep I\n|Men[tuhotep]\n|–\n|–\n|Name lost\n|Lost\n|-\n|Intef I\n|In[tef]\n|–\n|–\n|Name lost\n|Lost\n|-\n|Intef II\n|Intef\n|–\n|–\n|[I]n[tef]\n|49 years\n|-\n|Intef III\n|Name lost\n|–\n|–\n|Name lost\n|8 years\n|-\n|Mentuhotep II\n|Nebhepetre\n|Nebhepetre\n|Nebhepetre\n|Nebhapetre\n|51 years\n|-\n|Mentuhotep III\n|Seneferkare\n|Sankhkare\n|Seankhkare\n|Sankhka(re)\n|12 years\n|-\n|Mentuhotep IV\n|[Nebtawy]re\n|–\n|–\n|Omitted\n|7 years\n|}\nSee also\n* Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt family tree\n* Middle Kingdom of Egypt\nNotes\nExternal links\n*"
