It consists of thirteen buildings associated with a trade school for boys from poor families that operated from 1898 to 1944. The complex centers on a 3-story dormitory building built for the school, but also includes the late 18th-century Federal style Buckingham House. The surrounding farm was, uniquely for the area, irrigated.  Bordering the Monocacy River, the grounds include several significant late Woodland period archeological sites.\nAfter the school closed, the property was donated to the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland.  It became a youth camp and then a conference center named after the first bishop ordained in Maryland, the Rev. Claggett.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*, including 2006 photo, at Maryland Historical Trust"
