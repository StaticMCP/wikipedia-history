This occurred as the suburb was quite large, located on either side of South Road and was in the jurisdiction of two local government councils, with the larger western side belonging to the City of Marion.\nEdwardstown is in the South Australian House of Assembly districts of Badcoe and Elder, and the Australian House of Representatives Division of Boothby. Edwardstown is home to the Castle Plaza Shopping Centre.\nEdwardstown is served by the Woodlands Park and Edwardstown railway stations. The current suburb of Edwardstown includes localities previously known as Hammersmith, Woodlands Park, '''St Mary's West, Ackland Gardens and Mirreen'''.\nSee also\n*List of Adelaide suburbs\n*Electoral district of Edwardstown\nReferences"
