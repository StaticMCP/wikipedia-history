Any case selected in a plot in Mondrian is highlighted in all other plots.\nCurrently implemented plots comprise Mosaic Plot, Scatterplots and SPLOM, Maps, Barcharts, Histograms, Missing Value Plot, Parallel Coordinates/Boxplots and Boxplots y by x.\nMondrian works with data in standard tab-delimited or comma-separated ASCII files and can load data from R workspaces. There is basic support for working directly on data in databases.\nMondrian links to R and offers statistical procedures like interactive density estimation, scatterplot smoothers, multidimensional scaling (MDS) and principal component analysis (PCA).\nOverview\nStarting in 1997, Mondrian was first developed with a focus on visualization techniques for categorical data and enhanced selection techniques. Over the years, a complete suite of visualizations for univariate and multivariate data measured on any scale were added. The link to R offers well tested statistical procedures, which integrate seamlessly into the interactive graphics. Today, even geographical data is supported with highly interactive maps.\nMondrian details\nLast stable and beta versions, help and documentations are available on the developer web site, Martin Theus\nSupported data sources\nMondrian works on plain text files with tab-separated columns with variable header, as exported from Microsoft Excel as \".txt\". If the Rserve link and R are present, Mondrian also reads data directly from R workspace files (.RData files).\nVisualizations\n* 1-d: Barchart, Spineplot, Histogram, Spinogram, Boxplot\n* 2-d: Scatterplot, Boxplot y by x\n* High-D:\n** Multivariate continuous: Scatterplot matrix, Parallel coordinates\n** Multivariate categorical: Mosaic plot (see also Treemapping)\n* Geographical: Map\n* Special: missing value plot\nInteraction techniques\nMondrian supports Query, Select, and Modify.\nSee also\n* Data visualization\n* GGobi\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Theus, M.
