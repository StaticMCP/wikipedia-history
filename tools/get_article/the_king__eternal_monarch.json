Written by Kim Eun-sook and produced by Hwa&Dam Pictures and its parent company Studio Dragon, the series premiered on SBS TV and Netflix for the global audience on April 17, 2020.\nSet in two parallel worlds, the series follows Emperor Lee Gon of the Kingdom of Corea, who discovers access to an alternate reality after crossing a mythical door opened by his half-uncle, Lee Lim, where the Republic of Korea exists in the Kingdom's stead and sets out to put an end to Lee Lim's atrocities and retrieve the other half of Manpasikjeok used as a portal between two worlds.\nHailed as one of the most anticipated series in the first half of 2020 due to its ensemble cast, screenwriter, extensive publicity and production budget, the series set a record for SBS's highest 2020 Friday-Saturday drama premiere ratings. It also maintained the No.1 spot on the weekly Wavve drama chart for eight consecutive weeks, and was listed as the most popular Korean drama series on Netflix in India, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore and one of the top two in the U.S. The series received mixed reviews and lower-than-expected domestic TV viewership ratings on later episodes, with news media attributing it to competition from streaming platforms and criticism of its screenplay, production and various controversies.\nSynopsis\nLee Gon (Lee Min-ho), a modern-day Emperor of the Kingdom of Corea, attempts to cross the barrier into an alternate reality where the Republic of Korea exists in the Kingdom's stead. He comes across detective Jeong Tae-eul (Kim Go-eun), whom he recognizes from an identity card he obtained during the turning point of his childhood: his father's assassination.

Netflix 2020 year-end viewing lists revealed that The King: Eternal Monarch was the most popular Korean drama series in India, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore and one of the top two in the U.S.\nOn August 6, Studio Dragon announced their financial performance over the second quarter with a record-breaking 135 million dollars in total sales, a 25.9% increase over the same period of time last year, accrediting the boost to license sales of works such as Crash Landing on You, The King: Eternal Monarch, and ''It's Okay to Not Be Okay'', and according to Hancinema, \"'The King: Eternal Monarch' likely deserves most of the credit, as it is the only one of these dramas to have aired entirely during the second quarter.\" Business Korea also reported, \"Studio Dragon's TV series sales climbed 9.3% year-over-year on average amid the growing popularity of K-dramas, particularly The King: Eternal Monarch.\"\nThe BBQ Chicken brand advertised on the series reported the sale of 550,000 sets of its fried chicken in a month due to its appearance on the series.\nCritical response\nThe King: Eternal Monarch received mixed reviews. The series was highly anticipated by fans before its premiere, as it served to be Lee Min-ho first comeback projected following his release from mandatory military service, and being written by screenwriter Kim Eun-sook.\n| width = 25em\n}}\nArab News praised the series commenting, \"In a world of mainstream K-dramas filled with cliches and reoccurring themes, The King: Eternal Monarch stands unique and absolutely mind-blowing,\" while Sebastian Roché tweeted, praising the series. The Philippine Cosmopolitan reviewed it saying, \"The drama was smart and ambitious. It's commendable that screenwriter Kim Eun-suk aspired to attract a wider audience by choosing to veer away from tried and tested drama tropes.\" Woo Do-hwan's performance as double characters was praised throughout the show's run.\nOppositely, The Korean Herald wrote that the series failed to present adequate explanation of the parallel universe to the audience who complained of the similarity of the two different worlds, with cultural critic Ha Jae-geun describing, \"The story unfolds at a relatively slow pace and the parallel world is too complex to understand. It's hard to find some clever, creative conversations and catchy soundtracks in 'The King'.\" William Schwartz from Hancinema commented on the directing saying, \"The lack of coherent direction has also dampened enthusiasm for the drama,\" and expressed that, \"Viewers have taken issue with the inconsistent intuitive intelligence shown by the main character .... particularly the unapologetic extent to which characters from the fantasy universe play on uncomfortable gender tropes,\" while Cinemaescapist stating, \"Others may find themselves disappointed as the ensemble cast swim in a sea of cliche.\" The series was also criticized for the excessive use of product placement, with one episode featuring 7 product placement ads, which was seen as undermining the series's content and artistry.\nStock images and historical inaccuracy\nFollowing its premiere, an online controversy erupted as Korean viewers noticed that the architecture of the fictional world of the Corean Empire resembled that of Japanese temples, in particular, the Japanese temple complex Tōdai-ji and the temple of Kōfuku-ji. As the series was aired during a time when Korean-Japanese relations were uneasy, the production team issued an apology and stated that the buildings in question would be corrected. As the series progressed into its sixth episode, another controversy occurred as the episode depicted a naval war between Japan and the Corean empire, where the viewers noticed that the Japanese warships had the design of present Korean warships. The producer admitted that the production team used open source and stock images as reference material for the Japanese fleet as they were restricted from filming overseas due to COVID-19 and that they should have consulted experts to review the material.\nAnother controversy also surfaced in the sixth episode about the image of the dragon in the royal robe and the crown of the King. According to the viewers, Emperor Lee Gon's golden crown was similar to crowns used in the Silla period and his royal robe with the image of the dragon was mainly used in the Joseon period, and though the series states that it is not set in any particular dynasty in Korea and is a fantasy, they considered this mistake as a massive mix-up.\nBroadcast warnings\nOn May 14, the Korea Communications Standards Commission issued an advisory warning against the series for scenes that challenged gender equality after viewers complained that those scenes promote fixed gender stereotypes. The scenes in question featured the female prime minister saying, \"Bras without wires can't support the chest,\" as well as the scene portraying a boat race where a female spectator said, \"Men need to wear less and move around lots.\"\nOn the same day, the Korea Communications Standards Commission also issued a warning to the production when the advertising review subcommittee took issue with the indirect advertising seen in episodes 8, 9, and 12 stating that it violated article 47 of the broadcasting regulations.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The rating hit its lowest at 5.2% on the 11th episode, hovered around the 6-8% viewership ratings on later episodes, and ending with a viewership rating of 8.1%. The series saw smaller domestic popularity compared to previous works by writer Kim Eun-sook. According to International Business Times, the development of the plot, the editing and the forced scenes were the reasons the series failed to increase its ratings, while The Korea Times in an interview with an anonymous drama production company official said that the low ratings can largely be attributed to rise of streaming platforms.\n| average         = y\n| width           = 300\n| height          = 200\n| country         = South Korea\n| -\n| 2.299\n| 2.453\n| 1.856\n| 2.154\n| 1.745\n| 2.136\n| 1.595\n| 1.756\n| 1.304\n| 1.690\n| 1.316\n| 1.572\n| 1.631\n| 1.288\n| 1.727\n| 1.642\n| 1.760\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:550px; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|+ Average TV viewership ratings\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Part\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Original broadcast date\n! colspan=\"3\" | Average audience share\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Nielsen Korea\n!
