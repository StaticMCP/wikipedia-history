The category was presented only at the 11th Canadian Screen Awards in 2023; beginning with the 12th Canadian Screen Awards in 2024, it was split into new categories for Best Supporting Performance in a Comedy Film and Best Supporting Performance in a Drama Film.\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Actor\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Film\n! style=\"width:2%;\"| Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| 2022  11th Canadian Screen Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Aaron Pierre\n| Brother\n|\n|-\n| Marsha Stephanie Blake\n| Brother\n| rowspan=7|\n|-\n| K.
