The original lineup consisted of Jonathan Huber (vocals), Evan Hughes (guitar), Jake Paulson (guitar), Randy Carpenter (drums), and Zack Ring (bass).\nIn 2006, the group released their first album, the independently released What You Deserve and began touring soon after. In 2007 the band released their second album and first on a record label, Amidst the Bloodshed on the now defunct Compton Records. During a tour in the same year, the group came in contact with fellow deathcore band Whitechapel and established a close friendship with them. In 2009 the band would experience its first major lineup change \"with Chris Fugate stepping in to replace Paulson, Ryan Cox coming in for Carpenter, and Brent Eaton taking over for Ring.\" This would leave Huber and Hughes as the only original members in the band. Also in 2009, the band was contacted by the up-and-coming Artery Recordings after Whitechapel guitarist Alex Wade \"was approached by Artery in regards to possible bands to sign\" and recommended I Declare War.\nThe following year, the band released their third album, 2010's Malevolence.  This would mark the group's last release to feature original vocalist, Jonathan Huber. He would leave the band in 2010 to further other ventures.  Huber would then go on to join death metal outfit Pathology. The band was quick to find a replacement vocalist in Jamie Hanks. Hanks had previously been the long time vocalist of death metal band Those Who Lie Beneath. In 2011, Hanks made his first recorded appearance with the band on the group's fourth record, the self-titled I Declare War. This release being titled I Declare War Guitarist Evan Hughes was the only member in the band left from the original 2005 lineup. However, even this was about to change. In early 2012, the band's lineup again went through a drastic change. Every single member of the band other than their newly appointed vocalist left I Declare War.  With Hanks now finding himself the senior member of the band, the group gained a new lineup in 2012. This third and current incarnation of the group consists of guitarist John Winters, drummer Colin Bradford, bassist Gordon McPherson, and vocalist Jamie Hanks. They eventually expanded to once again include a second guitarist, this one being Jacob Hansen. Later on yet again due to heavy touring Hansen and Bradford would leave and enters Yusef Johnson.\nIn 2014, this new lineup released its first album together, We Are Violent People by Nature, which would be I Declare War's fifth full-length album and would reach No. 13 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. In 2016, 'Songs for the Sick' was released. An Instrumental version of the album was also made available. Later in 2016 the band recruited guitarist Greg Kirkpatrick (As Blood Runs Black) and drummer Garon Howe (Hailbrook Hollow). A year later a new music video was released for one of the songs on that album entitled, Millions will Burn.  In 2018, they released a cover of the Stone Temple Pilots song Dead and Bloated.\nIn October of 2019, I Declare War released a five song EP entitled Downcast. It was recorded in Seattle, WA at Thunderbeast studios and mixed and mastered by Aaron Kitcher. It is the first body of music to feature drummer Garon Howe and guitarist Greg Kirkpatrick. It also features lyrics written by Howe on the track entitled Hypothermic. A sequel to the EP, Downcast Vol. 2, was released on November 19, 2024.\nBand members\nCurrent\n* Jamie Hanks – lead vocals (2010–present)\n* John Winters – rhythm guitar (2012–present) bass (2016–present)\n* Greg Kirkpatrick  – lead guitar  (2016–present)\n* Garon Howe – drums  (2016–present)\nFormer\n* Jake Paulson – guitar (2005–2008)\n* Randy Carpenter – drums (2005–2008)\n* Zack Ring – bass guitar (2005–2009)\n* Jonathan Huber – lead vocals (2005–2010)\n* Chris Fugate – guitar (2009–2011)\n* Evan Hughes – guitar (2005–2012)\n* Ryan Cox – drums (2009–2012)\n* Gordon McPherson – bass guitar (2011–2015)\n* Brent Eaton – bass guitar (2009–2011, 2016)\n* Joe Garcia – drums  (2014–2016)\n* Yusef Johnson – lead guitar (2014–2016)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend     = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2005\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2006\nColors=\nid:Vocals value:red         legend:Vocals\nid:lead   value:teal        legend:Lead_guitar\nid:rhythm value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitar\nId:Bass   value:blue        legend:Bass\nId:Drums  value:orange      legend:Drums\nid:album  value:black       legend:Studio_album\nid:EP  value:gray(0.6)       legend:EP\nId:bars   value:gray(0.95)\nLineData=\nlayer:back\ncolor:album\nat:01/01/2006\nat:01/10/2007\nat:08/06/2010\nat:11/10/2011\nat:15/04/2014\nat:21/10/2016\ncolor:EP\nat:18/10/2019\nat:19/11/2024\nBarData=\nbar:Huber     text:\"Jonathan Huber\"\nbar:Hanks     text:\"Jamie Hanks\"\nbar:Evan      text:\"Evan Hughes\"\nbar:Hansen    text:\"Jacob Hansen\"\nbar:Johnson   text:\"Yusef Johnson\"\nbar:Kirkpatrick text:\"Greg Kirkpatrick\"\nbar:Paulson   text:\"Jake Paulson\"\nbar:Fugate    text:\"Chris Fugate\"\nbar:Winters   text:\"John Winters\"\nbar:Ring      text:\"Zack Ring\"\nbar:Eaton     text:\"Brent Eaton\"\nbar:McPherson text:\"Gordon McPherson\"\nbar:Carpenter text:\"Randy Carpenter\"\nbar:Cox       text:\"Ryan Cox\"\nbar:Bradford  text:\"Colin Bradford\"\nbar:Garcia    text:\"Joe Garcia\"\nbar:Howe      text:\"Garon Howe\"\nPlotData=\nwidth:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,4)\nbar:Huber     from:01/01/2005 till:01/07/2010 color:vocals\nbar:Hanks     from:01/07/2010 till:end        color:vocals\nbar:Evan      from:01/01/2005 till:01/01/2012 color:lead\nbar:Hansen    from:01/01/2012 till:01/06/2014 color:lead\nbar:Hansen    from:01/01/2012 till:01/01/2013 color:rhythm width:3\nbar:Johnson   from:01/06/2014 till:01/05/2016 color:lead\nbar:Kirkpatrick    from:01/05/2016 till:end        color:lead\nbar:Paulson   from:01/01/2005 till:01/01/2009 color:rhythm\nbar:Fugate    from:01/01/2009 till:01/01/2012 color:rhythm\nbar:Winters   from:01/01/2012 till:end        color:rhythm\nbar:Winters   from:01/05/2016 till:end color:bass width:3\nbar:Winters   from:01/01/2012 till:01/01/2013 color:lead width:3\nbar:Ring      from:01/01/2005 till:01/01/2009 color:bass\nbar:Eaton     from:01/01/2009 till:01/01/2012 color:bass\nbar:McPherson from:01/01/2012 till:01/01/2016 color:bass\nbar:Eaton     from:01/01/2016 till:01/05/2016 color:bass\nbar:Carpenter from:01/01/2005 till:01/01/2009 color:drums\nbar:Cox       from:01/01/2009 till:01/01/2013 color:drums\nbar:Bradford  from:01/01/2013 till:01/06/2014 color:drums\nbar:Garcia    from:01/06/2014 till:01/01/2016 color:drums\nbar:Howe  from:01/01/2016 till:end        color:drums\n}}\nDiscography\nAlbums\n* 2006: What You Deserve (album, self-released)\n* 2007: Amidst the Bloodshed (album, Compton Records)\n* 2010: Malevolence (album, Artery Recordings)\n* 2011: I Declare War (album, Artery Recordings) U.S. Heatseekers #16\n* 2014: We Are Violent People by Nature (album, Artery Recordings) U.S. Heatseekers #13\n* 2016: Songs for the Sick (album, self-released)\nOther\n* 2007: Bring the Season (Christmas-themed EP, Compton Records)\n* 2019: Downcast (EP, self-released)\n* 2024: Downcast Vol. 2 (EP, self-released)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
