She served with the Black Sea Fleet during the war and covered older pre-dreadnought battleships as they bombarded Ottoman facilities in 1915. The ship engaged the Ottoman light cruiser Midilli,(formerly the German SMS Breslau) several times without inflicting anything more serious than splinter damage. Imperatritsa Mariya was sunk at anchor in Sevastopol by a magazine explosion in late 1916, killing 228 crewmen. She was subsequently raised, but her condition was very poor.  She was finally scrapped in 1926, after the end of the Russian Civil War.\nDescription\nImperatritsa Mariya at anchor on 24 June 1915; the structure on her bow is a mooring boom, not a bowsprit\nImperatritsa Mariya was  long at the waterline. She had a beam of  and a draft of . Her displacement was  at load,  more than her designed displacement of . She proved to be very bow-heavy in service and tended to ship large amounts of water through her forward casemates. The ammunition for the forward  guns was reduced from 100 to 70 rounds each, while the  ammunition was reduced from 245 to 100 rounds per gun, in an attempt to compensate for her trim. This did not fully cure the problem, but Imperatritsa Mariya was lost before any other changes could be implemented.\nThe ship was fitted with four Parsons-type steam turbines imported from John Brown & Company of the United Kingdom. They were designed for a total of , but produced  on her sea trials using steam produced by 20 mixed-firing triangular Yarrow boilers with a working pressure of . Designed speed was . Her maximum coal capacity was  plus  of fuel oil, which gave her a range of  at maximum speed. All of her electrical power was generated by three Curtis  main turbo generators and two  auxiliary units.\nHer main armament consisted of a dozen 12-inch Obukhovskii Pattern 1907 guns mounted in four triple gun turrets distributed the length of the ship. Her secondary armament consisted of twenty 130&nbsp;mm B7 Pattern 1913 guns mounted in casemates. They were arranged in two groups, six guns per side from the forward turret to the rear funnel and the remaining four were clustered around the rear turret. She was fitted with four  anti-aircraft guns, one mounted on the roof of each turret. Four  submerged torpedo tubes were carried, two tubes on each broadside abaft the forward magazine.\nService\nphoto of the battleship Imperatritsa Mariya, while being inspected by the Romanov imperial family in the port of Sevastopol (27 May 1916).

She was laid down on 30 October 1911 along with her sister ships Imperator Aleksander III and Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya, but this was merely a ceremonial event as the design had not yet been finalized nor the contract signed. She was launched on 19 October 1913 and arrived in Sevastopol on 13 July 1915, where she completed her fitting out during the next few months and conducted sea trials. On 1 October she provided cover for the Black Sea Fleet's pre-dreadnoughts as they bombarded targets in Kozlu, Zonguldak and Karadeniz Ereğli. She did much the same when older battleships bombarded targets in Bulgaria on 20–22 October and then Varna itself on 27 October. The light cruiser Midilli narrowly escaped a running engagement with the Imperatritsa Mariya on 4 April 1916 as the battleship narrowly missed her several times before she could disengage. Three months later both Imperatritsa Mariya and Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya, alerted by intercepted radio transmissions, sortied from Sevastopol in an attempt to intercept the ex-German battlecruiser Yavuz as she returned from a bombardment of the Russian port of Tuapse on 4 July. The Yavuz dodged north and avoided the Russians by paralleling the Bulgarian coastline back to the Bosphorus. The Midilli mined the harbor of Novorossiysk on 21 July, but the Russians, again alerted by radio intercepts, attempted to catch her on her return journey. Midilli was lured into range of Imperatritsa Mariyas guns the next day when the cruiser pursued the , but she managed to escape with only splinter damage.\nalt=A large ship upside-down and braced in a drydock\nOn the morning of 20 October 1916, a fire was discovered in the Imperatritsa Mariyas forward powder magazine while at anchor in Sevastopol, but it exploded before any efforts could be made to fight the fire. Sailors led by Engineer-Mechanic Midshipman Ignatyev, however, managed to flood the forward shell magazine before the explosion at the cost of their own lives. Their action probably prevented a catastrophic detonation and all of the other magazines were flooded as a precaution. About forty minutes after the first explosion, a second occurred in the vicinity of the torpedo compartment that destroyed the watertight integrity of the rest of the forward bulkheads. Imperatritsa Mariya began to sink by the bow and listed to starboard. She capsized a few minutes later, taking 228 sailors with her. The subsequent investigation determined that the explosion was probably the result of spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose-based propellant as it decomposed.\nFollowing a complex salvage operation, the ship was eventually refloated on 18 May 1918 and moved into Sevastopol's Northern Dry Dock on 31 May, still upside down. The chaos of the Russian Revolution and Civil War prevented further repair work, although her 130&nbsp;mm guns were removed. By 1923, the wooden blocks supporting her in place were rotting.  She was floated out and grounded in shallow water in 1923. She was approved for scrapping in June 1925 and officially stricken on 21 November 1925, although the work did not begin until 1926 when she was refloated and moved back into the dry dock. Her gun turrets, which had fallen out of the ship when she capsized, were later salvaged. Two of them were used as the 30th Coast Defense Battery defending the city during the Siege of Sevastopol in World War II.\nNotes\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://web.ukonline.co.uk/aj.cashmore/russia/battleships/imperatritsamaria/imperatritsamaria.html Specifications]\n*[http://flot.sevastopol.info/eng/ship/dreadnoughts/impmariya.htm Brief article on the Black Sea Fleet website]"
