In addition to traditional stand-up comedy, Edmondson's act featured his ability to write in script that was upside down and/or backwards, spell and pronounce words backwards, and read an inverted blackboard correctly.\nHe was murdered on January 29, 1976, as part of an armed robbery. Three men 17-year-old Willie Edgar Bell, 19-year-old Roy Anthony Ellerbee, and 23-year-old Michael Gantt, were arrested for the murder. They were all found guilty and sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years for armed robbery.\nThe three men were paroled in the early 1990s, albeit Bell and Gantt returned to prison for numerous parole violations.
