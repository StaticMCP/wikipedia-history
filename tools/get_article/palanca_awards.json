Usually referred to as the \"Pulitzer Prize of the Philippines,\" it is the country's highest literary honor in terms of prestige. It was named after Carlos T. Palanca, Sr., the Filipino-Chinese businessman and philanthropist.\nThe literary competition began with a long-term vision straddling two complementary tracks: to provide incentives for Filipino writers to craft the best literary pieces, and to be a treasury to the country's literary gems. Winning works are entered in the competition either as previously published pieces or in manuscript form. The Palanca Memorial Awards, organized by the Carlos Palanca Foundation, Inc. is one of the Philippines' longest-running awards programs. Among its winners include several National Artists for Literature, including Nick Joaquin, Edith L. Tiempo, Gemino H. Abad, Cirilo F. Bautista, F. Sionil Jose, NVM Gonzales, Bienvenido Lumbera, Amado V. Hernandez, and Virgilio Almario.\nHistory\nThe Palanca Memorial Awards was established in 1950 to inspire and recognize Philippine writers, including poets, playwrights and screenwriters, and writers for children. It started giving out prizes in the Short Story (English) and Maikling Kwento (Filipino) in 1951. In the 1960s, the Palanca Memorial Awards Committee started to fund the publication of Palanca Memorial Award-winning plays, and production funds were committed in 1975.\nSince 1954, the awards night has been held on September 01, to commemorate the birthday of Carlos T. Palanca Sr. (although there have been changes of dates in the intervening years). Venues that have hosted the celebratory dinner include the Philippine Columbian Clubhouse, New Selecta, Hilton Hotel, Hyatt Regency Hotel, La Tondeña Building, Philippine International Convention Center, Dusit Hotel, the Peninsula Manila, and Marquis Events Place.\nCategories\nThere are currently 22 categories in the Palanca Memorial Awards. In the early decades, writers could submit multiple submissions per category, often resulting to multiple wins [plus designated honorable mentions or special prizes].
