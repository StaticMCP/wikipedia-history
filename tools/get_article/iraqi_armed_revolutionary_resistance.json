The first article, citing leftist Iraqi news website Al-Badeel Al-Iraqi, described the group as \"previously unknown\". The leaflets described the IARR as a \"movement of Iraqi Communists and Marxists experienced in armed struggle, leftist Iraqi nationalists, and their supporters.\"  They also spoke against the \"puppet government, the so-called Council of Representatives, terrorist Salafis, militias, the Interior Ministry, Iraqi traitors who came on American tanks, the American and British mercenaries, contractors, and their servants from the South Lebanese Army.\" The membership of the group is unknown, and no other source has reported on it.\nAttacks\nThe Revolutionary Resistance claimed responsibility for one attack, against United States troops in the area between Najaf and Karbala. Unnamed sources quoted by Al-Badeel Al-Iraqi said the attack targeted a convoy of \"special forces of the occupation,\" referring (according to IraqSlogger) to US military contractors, at the Khan Al-Nus area on the main road between the Shi'a holy cities of Najaf and Karbala. According to the sources, the attack destroyed one vehicle and damaged another, killing the occupants of the first vehicle, although no other media source reported the attack or the casualties. The sources added that the Iraqi Armed Revolutionary Resistance would continue its military operations, according to a \"meticulous and calculate [sic] plan, taking into account the delicate surrounding security situation and the intense intelligence presence of well-known elements and lackeys of the occupation, both Islamic and secular.\" There have been no subsequent reports of the group and it is unknown if they have continued to operate.\nReferences"
