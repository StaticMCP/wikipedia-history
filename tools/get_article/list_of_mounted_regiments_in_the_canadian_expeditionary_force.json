The remaining mounted rifle regiments were raised in Canada but broken up in England to provide reinforcements for other cavalry, mounted infantry and infantry units.\nThe regiments in bold type served in the field.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\"\n|+ Cavalry and mounted rifle units of the Canadian Expeditionary Force\n|-\n!
