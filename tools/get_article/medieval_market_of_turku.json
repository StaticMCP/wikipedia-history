Admission to the event is free. In addition to living history performances, it includes an open-air handicrafts market with vendors and even visitors garbed in period costume. The main market is at the Old Great Square (one of the city's oldest market squares), but there are other performances and exhibitions at Turku Castle, Turku Cathedral and at the Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova Museum. Together these different performances and exhibitions form the Medieval Turku event, which is organized in unison by Turun Suurtorin keskiaika ry, the Museum Centre of Turku, the Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova museum, Rohan Stables and Turku and Kaarina Parish Union. These areas are closed to traffic during the event.\nHistory\nThe event, held in late June, has been organized since 1996, and is constantly growing in popularity. In 2005, it drew in approximately 100,000 visitors, and employed over 100 voluntary and professional actors and actresses.\nThe Town Market of the Hanseatic merchant, \"Laurentius\" was organized by the Aboa Vetus & Ars Nova Museum till 2013. Since then, the museum has focused on presenting medieval times through guided tours, lectures and archeological digs.\nMore recently, the visitor amounts of the market have climbed to 180,000, and they now compete with the most popular summertime events in Finland, such as Ruisrock (93,000 visitors) or Pori Jazz (150,000 visitors).\nThis market went virtual in 2020.\nGallery\nFile:Turku Medieval Markets, twisting rope, detail.jpg|Rope twisting 2005\nFile:Turku Medieval Market, a knight.jpg|Voluntary actor as a soldier 2005\nFile:Turku Medieval market, bourgeois.jpg|Voluntary actors as members of the bourgeois 2005\nFile:Turku Medieval Market, handicrafts.jpg|Handicrafts 2005\nFile:Turku medieval festival.jpg|Turku Medieval Market 2006\nFile:Turku Medieval Market in 2012.jpg|Market visitors 2012\nFile:Animal skulls at Turku Medieval market 2015.jpg|Animal skulls 2015\nFile:Acrobatic show at Turku Medieval market 2015.jpg|Acrobatic show 2015\nFile:Medieval band at Turku Medieval market 2015.jpg|Medieval band 2015\nFile:Sahti brewing at Turku Medieval market 2015.jpg|Sahti brewing 2015\nSee also\n* List of Renaissance fairs\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://en.keskiaikaisetmarkkinat.fi/ Medieval Market] Official site.\n* [https://keskiajanturku.wordpress.com/in-english/ Medieval Turku] Official blog."
