It works with the PyMC probabilistic programming framework. Bambi provides an interface to build and solve Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models.\nBambi is an open source project, developed by the community and is an affiliated project of NumFOCUS.\nEtymology\nBambi is an acronym for BAyesian Model-Building Interface.\nLibrary features\n* Model specification using a Wilkison-like formula style\n* Bayesian inference using MCMC and Variational Inference methods\n* Interface with ArviZ, as Bambi returns an  object\n* Model interpretation via conditional adjusted comparisons, predictions, and slopes\n* A wide array of response families\n* Default priors that the users can modify if needed\nSee also\n* Stan, a probabilistic programming language for statistical inference written in C++\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
