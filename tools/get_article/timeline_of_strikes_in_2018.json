Notably an increase in the number of strikes at private companies and strikes in companies were workers didn't have official union representation.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics found that there were 20 major work stoppages in the United States in 2018, the highest since 2007, and that 485,000 workers were involved in work stoppages across the country, the highest since 1986. In Aotearoa New Zealand, at least 70,000 workers were involved in strikes in 2018, the highest since the late 1980s.\nReferences"
