It has been recognised as one of the oldest and most active student societies at the University of Queensland and one of the most active and successful university debating societies in the world. The UQ Debating Society was also a founding member of the University of Queensland Union.\nHistory\nThe University of Queensland Debating Society was officially established in 1960; however debating has been present at the University of Queensland since its formation in 1909.\nIn 1932, the UQ Intervarsity Debating Society organised in Brisbane the first ever national intervarsity debating tournament with all six Australian universities at the time (Melbourne, Tasmania, Sydney, Adelaide, Western Australia, and Queensland).\nAs was described in the UQ student publication, Semper Floreat, in 1937, \"the Society offers a unique opportunity to undergraduates to express themselves on all sorts of heterogeneous topics, to deliver their pet heresies and to slander their friends in a comparatively sheltered academic atmosphere... So don't forget to roll along to the first debate with all your pet theories and subjects. If you have never spoken before you are like most of us—but don't leave it too late to begin. The sooner you start the sooner you reach perfection.'\"\nIn 1953, the UQ Intervarsity Debating Society won the Philippines Cup at the Australian Intervarsity Debating Championships.\nMembership\nUQDS is made up of approximately 200 members and is open to all students and staff of the University of Queensland. This membership is drawn primarily from undergraduate students at the University of Queensland St Lucia campus, across the academic faculties from biomedical science to anthropology and from commerce to engineering, although the common degrees of the membership tend to be in law, economics, and politics. Graduate students are also members and staff members have been known to participate in the internal debating competition.\nThere is also a base of frequent attendants in the internal competition from Griffith University and the Queensland University of Technology.
