The treaty, consisting of 15 articles, was negotiated by General Thomas Lowry Robinson on behalf of Mosquitia and Coronado Chávez, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, for Honduras. It marked a rare instance of formal diplomatic engagement between an indigenous monarchy and a Central American republic during the 19th century.\nBackground\nAt the time of the treaty's negotiation, both Mosquitia and Honduras sought to strengthen their positions in the face of regional instability and foreign intervention. For Mosquitia, the treaty represented an effort to broaden its network of formal diplomatic ties beyond the United Kingdom. For Honduras, the treaty was a strategic attempt to assert influence and foster cooperative relations with the Mosquitian Kingdom, which had historically aligned with British interests.\nTreaty Provisions\nThe treaty established several key principles of cooperation:\n* Freedom of Movement and Trade (Articles 1–2, 5): Citizens of both states were granted reciprocal rights of movement and commerce within each other's territories, subject to local laws. Mosquitians were expressly permitted to enter Honduras freely to exchange or sell their products with Central Americans.\n* Diplomatic and Postal Communication (Articles 3–4): Mutual respect for state officials was mandated, and a postal arrangement was created to ensure the monthly exchange of official correspondence, to be managed through Juticalpa or the port of Trujillo.\n* Customs and Trade Regulation (Articles 6–8): Both governments pledged to prohibit unauthorized foreign trade. Smuggled goods would be confiscated, and violators punished under the laws of the detaining state. Honduras was authorized to establish colonies or customs stations at the mouths of the Negro and Guayape Rivers to enforce trade regulations and prevent foreign intrusion.\n* Mutual Defense and Alliance (Articles 9, 13): Mosquitia committed to providing assistance to Honduras in times of need, and the treaty affirmed that the Mosquitian nation would be under the protection of the State of Honduras—described as the primary objective of General Robinson.\n* Educational and Cultural Collaboration (Articles 10–12): Honduras was permitted to establish colonies in Mosquitian territory with benefits to be shared between both parties. The treaty also called for initiatives to educate Mosquitians, including apprenticeship programs in mechanical arts and broader educational improvements under joint supervision.\n* Ratification and Future Amendments (Articles 14–15): The treaty allowed for future additions by mutual consent and required ratification by the Legislative Chamber of Honduras to enter into force.\nSignificance\nThe Robinson–Chávez Treaty represented a unique episode in Central American diplomacy, reflecting efforts by Mosquitia to diversify its alliances amid growing tensions with Nicaragua and shifting British policy. Although the long-term impact of the treaty was limited—particularly in light of Britain's eventual retreat from the region—it nonetheless illustrated the active agency of the Mosquitian monarchy in regional politics and its complex relationship with emerging Latin American republics.\nReferences"
