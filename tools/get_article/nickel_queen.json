It was inspired by the 1969–70 Poseidon nickel boom in Western Australia. British film producer Sydney Box, who had retired to Perth, sent a copy of the script to John McCallum who had just finished making the TV series Barrier Reef and was interesting in moving back into features. Finance was raised from a Perth syndicate, which included the local Channel Seven and Fauna Productions in Sydney.\nShooting started in November 1970 and took place in Perth and in the mining town of Broad Arrow. The film was full of plugs for companies which helped finance the film and cameos from West Australian politicians, including Premier Sir David Brand and Minister for Industrial Development Charles Court.\nRadio personality John Laws was cast in the lead after impressing John McCallum with his performance in an episode of the TV series Skippy the Bush Kangaroo. Alfred Sandor came out to Australia to play opposite Googie Withers in Plaza Suite and decided to stay.\nRelease\nThe film was highly popular in Perth, running for six months. It did less well in the eastern states.\nSee also\n* Cinema of Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A4462;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10 Nickel Queen] at the National Film and Sound Archive\n*[http://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/nickel-queen Nickel Queen] at Oz Movies"
