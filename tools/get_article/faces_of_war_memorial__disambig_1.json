The monument is made of brick enclosing a sculpted bronze centerpiece topped with a capstone made of Georgia marble.

A thin cascade of water flows over the faces from the top of the monument.\nA Memorial Day ceremony is held annually at the Faces of War Memorial which began in 1998, though it was not held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Roswell's annual Memorial Day ceremony is the largest Memorial Day event in the state of Georgia.\nThe monument was designed by local architect Zachary Henderson, and the bronze-cast centerpiece of the monument was sculpted by local husband-and-wife sculptors Don Haugen and Teena Stern.\nHistory\nThe idea for the memorial was conceived in 1990 by a small group of local veterans. The group coordinated fundraising efforts for the monument, which included benefit concerts and selling inscribed bricks which would be laid on both the monument itself as well as along the walkway leading to the monument. A miniature model of the finalized design of the memorial was unveiled at a fundraising auction in 1993.\nConstruction of the monument began in mid-1994, and was completed at a cost of $150,000 and formally dedicated on Memorial Day on May 29, 1995. The dedication ceremony included a commemoration speech by Georgia's Secretary of State Max Cleland, as well as helicopter and fighter jet flyovers in a missing man formation.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080820141628/http://www.roswellmemorialday.com/war-memorial.html Faces of War at Roswell Remembers]"
