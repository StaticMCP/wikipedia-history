In 1952 he went up to Jesus College, Cambridge and read history, being influenced by Conservative-minded figures such as Maurice Cowling, Herbert Butterfield and Michael Oakeshott. He graduated in 1955, and took his MA in 1959.\nEcclesiastical career\nPilkington trained for ordination at Westcott House, Cambridge, and was ordained as a deacon in the Diocese of Derby in 1959, and as a priest the following year. He served for three years as curate at the historic parish church of All Saints', Bakewell during the incumbency of George Sinker.\nHe left parochial work to take up his first school chaplaincy position. In 1975 he was appointed an honorary canon of Canterbury Cathedral.\nEducational career\nIn 1962 Pilkington became a schoolmaster at Eton College, teaching history, and a college chaplain. Later he became Conduct (senior chaplain), and for 10 years also served as Master in College, the housemaster of the scholars' house, until his resignation in 1975.\nHe was Headmaster of The King's School, Canterbury from 1975 to 1986.\nHis final appointment in education was the post of High Master of St Paul's School, London, from 1986 to 1992.\nRetirement\nFollowing his retirement from education Pilkington was appointed Chairman of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, serving from 1992 to 1996.\nIn 1995, he was made a life peer as Baron Pilkington of Oxenford, of West Dowlish in the County of Somerset.\nHe also assisted in retirement as an honorary curate of St Mary's, Bourne Street, a prominent Anglo-Catholic church in Pimlico, where he served from 1992 to 2005.\nAlthough his entire teaching career was spent in the private sector, Pilkington was a vociferous supporter of selective state education. During his retirement he served for several years as Chairman of the National Grammar Schools Association.\nPersonal life\nIn 1966 Pilkington married Helen Wilson, who predeceased him in 1997. He was survived by two daughters, Celia and Sarah Pilkington.\nReferences"
