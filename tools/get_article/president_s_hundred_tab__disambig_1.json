The brassard version is authorized for wear on enlisted uniforms of the U.S. Navy.\nHistory\nThe National Rifle Association of America's (NRA) President's Match was instituted at the NRA matches of 1878, as the American Military Rifle Championship Match. It was patterned after an event for British Volunteers called the Queen's Prize, a competition initiated by the British National Rifle Association in 1860, for which Queen Victoria personally offered a £250 prize to the winner.\nIn 1884, the name was changed to the President's Match for the Military Rifle Championship of the United States. It was fired at Creedmoor, New York, until 1891. In 1895, it was reintroduced at Sea Girt, New Jersey.\nThe tradition of making a letter from the President of the United States the first prize began in 1904, when President Theodore Roosevelt personally wrote a letter of congratulations to the winner, Private Howard Gensch of the 1st Regiment of Infantry of the New Jersey National Guard.\nIt cannot be ascertained as to when the President's Match was discontinued; however, it is known that it was not fired during World Wars I and II. It appears to have disappeared during the 1930s and during the Depression when lack of funds severely curtailed the holding of matches.\nThe President's Match was reinstated in 1957 at the National Matches as \"The President's Hundred.\" The 100 top-scoring competitors in the President's Match were singled out for special recognition in a retreat ceremony in which they passed in review before the winner and former winners of this historic match.\nOn 27 May 1958, the NRA requested approval of a tab for presentation to each member of the \"President's Hundred.\" NRA's plan was to award the cloth tab together with a metal brassard during the 1958 National Matches. The cloth tab was approved for wear on the uniform on 3 March 1958. The first awards were made at Camp Perry, Ohio, in early September 1958. Only the U.S. Navy has authorized the wear of the metal brassard on the uniforms of enlisted sailors. However, the NRA issued the metal brassard to all military and civilian personnel for wear on the shooting jacket.\nIn 1977, the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice (NBPRP) assumed responsibility for the President's Match from the NRA. Today the CMP holds the National Matches and awards the President's Hundred tab/brassard to the top 100 shooters in those matches.\nOther tabs\nThe President's Hundred Tab is one of four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs (as compared to a badge) authorized for wear by the U.S. Army. In order of precedence on the uniform, they are the President's Hundred tab, the Special Forces tab, the Ranger tab, and the Sapper tab. Only three may be worn at one time.\nSee also\n* Marksmanship badges (United States)\n* Tabs of the United States Army\n* Badges of the United States Coast Guard\n* Badges of the United States Navy\nReferences"
