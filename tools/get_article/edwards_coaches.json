A small fleet of service buses is maintained to operate a group of local bus services.\nOn 7 January 2011, Swansea based coach holiday operator Diamond Coach Holidays went into administration. In the week after Diamond collapsed, Edwards took over £1m in holiday bookings (many of these from ex Diamond customers).
