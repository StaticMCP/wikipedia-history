It was fought in what was then the District of Saskatchewan of the North-West Territories, at what is now known as Steele Narrows at Makwa Lake, in Saskatchewan's Steele Narrows Provincial Park. Steele Narrows is a channel that separates Sanderson Bay from Makwa Lake.\nLed by Major Sam Steele, a force of North-West Mounted Police, Alberta Mounted Rifles and Steele's Scouts (a body of mounted militia raised by Steele himself) caught up with and dispersed a band of Plains Cree warriors and their white and Métis hostages.\nCree scouts made a determined stand with what was left of their ammunition, but the body of the Cree column, realizing the hopelessness of their situation, released their prisoners and fled. The Cree casualties were four dead and dozens wounded.\nWandering Spirit, the war chief leading the Cree military campaign, surrendered to authorities at Fort Pitt. Big Bear, the aging peacetime chief of this band of Cree, eluded capture until July 2.\nMaps\n*[http://library.usask.ca/northwest/db/images/loonlk.jpg Military map of Loon Lake]\n*[http://library.usask.ca/northwest/db/images/fordll.jpg Military map of Loon Lake Ford]\n*[http://library.usask.ca/northwest/db/images/islell.jpg Military map of Loon Lake Island and Muskeg]\nLegacy\nThe site of the battle was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1950.\nIn the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake, that \"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\"\nThe Battle of Loon Lake is commemorated today by interpretive signs placed by the Government of Saskatchewan and a plaque placed by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.\nThe area of the battlefield was designated a provincial park in 1986. Steele Narrows Provincial Historic Park is an  park that conserves the lookout point of a Cree burial ground, has interpretive plaques, and a recreation area.\nReferences"
