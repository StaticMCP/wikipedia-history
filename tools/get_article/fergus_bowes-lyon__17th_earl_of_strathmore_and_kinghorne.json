He served as a captain with the Second Battalion of the regiment in Germany.\nStrathmore, then Captain Fergus Bowes-Lyon, married Mary Pamela McCorquodale (31 May 1932 – 28 April 2025) at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 10 April 1956 in a ceremony attended by his cousin, the Queen. His widow died on 28 April 2025. They had three children:\n* Michael Fergus Bowes-Lyon, 18th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (7 June 1957 – 27 February 2016)\n* Lady Elizabeth Mary Cecilia Bowes-Lyon (born 23 December 1959)\n* Lady Diana Evelyn Bowes-Lyon (born 29 December 1966)\nLater life\nHe became 17th and 4th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne upon the death of his first cousin, Timothy, 16th and 3rd Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, on 13 September 1972. He sat in the House of Lords as a Conservative. He and his wife made improvements to the visitors' areas at Glamis Castle, their seat in Angus. On 6 August 1973, Strathmore was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Angus, later serving as a vice lieutenant for the Tayside Region. Additional appointments he held included honorary colonel of the Tayforth Universities Officers' Training Corps from 1974 to 1982.\nOn 19 August 1987, Strathmore collapsed while shooting grouse on the grounds of Glamis Castle and died en route to hospital. He was succeeded by his son, Michael.\nReferences"
