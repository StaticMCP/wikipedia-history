Produced by Lucasfilm and set to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, the film will be part of the Star Wars franchise. It is set centuries before the main Star Wars films and explores the origins of the first Jedi and the Force.\nDevelopment on a film about the first Jedi began with David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who were hired to create a new series of Star Wars films in 2018. The pair left the project the next year due to other commitments, and Lucasfilm did not move forward with the idea. In April 2023, Mangold was announced to be making a Jedi origins film based on his own pitch. Willimon joined to co-write the film with Mangold a year later.\nPremise\nThe film is set centuries before the main Star Wars films during the \"Dawn of the Jedi\" era and explores the origins of the first Jedi and the Force.\nProduction\nBackground\nIn February 2018, Lucasfilm announced that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss would write and produce a new series of Star Wars films that would be separate from the main \"Skywalker Saga\" film series as well as a planned new film trilogy from Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) director Rian Johnson. Benioff and Weiss were expected to begin work on the new Star Wars films after completing the final season of their series Game of Thrones (2019). The pair wanted to explore the origins of the Jedi Order and considered the title The First Jedi. Creative differences with Lucasfilm emerged during meetings in mid-2018. In April 2019, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said their would be no new Star Wars films released for several years after Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019), the last of the Skywalker Saga films, as the company was taking their time to plan the next decade of storytelling for the franchise. She said Benioff, Weiss, and Johnson were working together to plan their projects, and the intention was for the new films to be set in different parts of the Star Wars timeline from the Skywalker Saga.\nDisney CEO Bob Iger said in May 2019 that the next Star Wars film would be directed by Benioff and Weiss, and released in 2022; Disney felt three years was the right amount of time to prepare for the next film. At the same time, Benioff and Weiss were courting multiple studio offers for overall film and television deals, and they signed an exclusive deal with Netflix in August. The pair were initially expected to continue working on their Star Wars films, and Netflix executives were aware of this commitment when the deal was signed. However, Netflix wanted Benioff and Weiss to prioritize developing new projects for them, and the pair officially parted-ways with Lucasfilm in October. They said this was because they could not do justice to both their Star Wars and Netflix projects. In September 2023, David S. Goyer said he had written a scriptment for a Jedi origins film set 25,000 years before the Skywalker Saga, but it was not produced due to \"behind-the-scenes stuff\" at Lucasfilm. In January 2024, Benioff and Weiss said they left their Star Wars deal because Lucasfilm did not want to tell their first Jedi story.\nDevelopment\nAt Star Wars Celebration London in April 2023, Lucasfilm announced that James Mangold would write and direct a Star Wars film set in the \"Dawn of the Jedi\" era. Mangold previously directed Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) for the studio, and before that he had been attached to co-write and direct a film based on the Star Wars character Boba Fett which was ultimately abandoned. Mangold said the new film would explore the origins of the Force and the first Jedi, and pitched it to Kennedy as being akin to the epic religious films Ben-Hur (1959) and The Ten Commandments (1956). Mangold had begun writing the script by the time of the announcement. He was also working on a planned Swamp Thing film for the DC Universe (DCU) franchise and was unsure which project would move forward first following his film A Complete Unknown (2024). That November, Dave Filoni revealed that he was now chief creative officer at Lucasfilm, after serving as executive producer on various Star Wars television series, and would be directly involved in the planning of future films and series.\nBeau Willimon, a writer on the Star Wars television series Andor (2022–2025), was hired to co-write the screenplay with Mangold in April 2024. The film, which was being referred to by the working title Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi, was expected to be the focus for Mangold following his work on A Complete Unknown. Mangold indicated in October that filming for Dawn of the Jedi would begin in 2025 after he completed work on A Complete Unknown. However, he reiterated in December that he was unsure which project would be next due to the ongoing writing process for Dawn of the Jedi, with himself and Willimon yet to complete a draft of the script. In February 2025, Kennedy said Mangold was still working on the script and she was willing to accommodate delays from his other projects, including the impacts of A Complete Unknown awards season. In September 2025, following the announcement that Mangold had signed an overall deal with Paramount Pictures, his representatives confirmed that he still \"remain[ed] attached and available to develop all his other projects\".\n}}\nExternal links\n*  Star Wars }}"
