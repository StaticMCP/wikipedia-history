It is situated to the far south west of the county, on the B186 near to the Greater London boundary and the M25 motorway.\nHistory\nThe original settlement of Wareleia was an Anglo-Saxon settlement located south of the existing Great Warley village. The name, Wareleia, had been reported to have different meanings, including \"wood or clearing near a wear\" or \"a covenant or agreement\", though in P. H. Reaney's 1935 book, Place Names of Essex, he stated that it was old English but obscure in meaning. In his book, Reaney stated that the spelling had changed from Werle in e.1045, with Warleia and Wareleia both being used in 1086.\nWarley, in the Domesday Book of 1086, was at the time, one settlement which had been split under separate manors, Warley Abbess and Warley Franks:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\n|-\n!Land held by\n!Households\n!Land and resources\n!Livestock\n!Valuation\n!Owners\n|-\n|Bishop of St. Paul of London\n| 5 villagers. 2 smallholders. 2 slaves.\n|Ploughland: 2 lord's plough teams. 3 men's plough teams.\nOther resources: Pasture 100 sheep.

The ancient parish of Great Warley, was seven miles north to south but only 1 mile across at its widest part, and was separated from Little Warley in the east by a stream that passes through Bulphan Fen on its way to the Thames. The parish was part of the Hundred of Chafford and from 1836 the Romford Poor Union before the change in 1875 to the Romford Rural Sanitary District. It also came under the Brentwood Petty Sessional and County Court.\nGreat Warley Common at one time ran from the village and connected with the outskirts of Brentwood, as shown by Chapman and André's 1777 Map of Essex. The common, along with Little Warley common, were owned by George Winn, who started selling off the land for development, including 116 acres for Warley Barracks and another 172 acres for residential development. In 1855, the new ecclesiastical parish of Christ Church was setup, with northern parts of Great Warley, along with parts of South Weald and Shenfield parishes to serve the new residents. The old church at St. Mary's had been reported as totally inadequate for the growing population in 1851, with the rector's sister in law, Sarah Clay donating £1,000 to build the new church. By 1876, 1,416 people lived in the parish, though 1,004 were in the new  church parish of Christ Church. This area would become a suburb of Brentwood and was named Warley to distinguish it from the villages of Great Warley and Little Warley. In 1858, the chancel at St. Mary's collapsed, so remodeling work commenced under the guidance of Samuel Sanders Teulon which was completed in 1860. However, with the village centre moving further away from the church, it fell into disrepair, and a new \"Interim\" church was built from wood in the grounds of \"Fairfields\", home of Rector Bailey. The first service was in 1892 attended by 140 parishioners, although the old church was continued to be used for funerals.\nFrom 1894 the Great Warley parish formed part of Romford Rural District and covered an area of . In 1901 it had a population of 1,900. Great Warley Parish Council was the parish council from 1894 to 1934. In 1904, a replacement St. Mary's church opened after a local resident Eveline Heseltine donated the site and £5,000 towards it's cost. The parish was split in 1934 with  of its former area transferred to the Brentwood parish in Brentwood Urban District. The remaining area was transferred to Hornchurch Urban District which in 1965 was transferred to Greater London to form part of the London Borough of Havering. In 1993, following the first periodic review of Greater London, the boundary between Brentwood and Havering was locally realigned to the M25 motorway in the west and the London, Tilbury and Southend line in the south by the Essex and Greater London (County and London Borough Boundaries) (No.2) Order 1993. This transferred almost all of the remaining part of Great Warley in Greater London back to Essex.\nGeology\nThe village sits on London Clay with an outcropping of Bagshot sands.\nGovernance\nParliamentary constituency\nGreat Warley comes under the parliamentary constituency of Brentwood and Ongar, which current MP Alex Burghart has held since 2017.\nLocal authorities\nGreat Warley sits within the non-metropolitan county of Essex, governed Essex County Council and the non-Metropolitan Borough of Brentwood, which is governed by Brentwood Borough Council. The village is within the Warley ward.\nBuildings, structures and attractions\nGreat Warley has its own conservation area, which was first designated in 1975. Historic England have thirty two listed buildings in Great Warley.\nConsecrated in 1904, the Grade I listed parish church, St Mary the Virgin is noted for its Art Nouveau interior, and replaced the original St. Mary's church that was eventually taken down in 1923. A little further to the south is The Kilns Hotel in the building locally known as The Brick House which dates back to the 16th Century and is Grade II listed.\nIn 2024, work was started on Hole Farm Community Woodland, a 100 acre woodland and visitor centre developed by National Highways and Forestry England due to open in 2025.\nWarley Place is a  nature reserve and is managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries this site was the home and garden of the leading horticulturalist, Ellen Willmott, described by Gertrude Jekyll as 'the greatest living gardener', who planted many plants from all over the world, some of which still survive. The site remained derelict after Willmott death, after a development for the site failed until the site was leased to the Essex Wildlife Trust in 1977, who uncovered the structure of the garden. The site has been Grade II listed since 1987.\nListed buildings and structures\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\n|-\n!Listing name\n!Image\n!List entry number\n!Grade\n!Date first listed\n!National Grid reference\n!Reference\n|-\n|Apple Tree Cottage\n|\n|1293155\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 58554 91258\n|\n|-\n|Blake House\n|\n|1197259\n|II\n|21 Oct 1958\n|TQ 58318 90683\n|\n|-\n|Boyles Court\n|\n|1206439\n|II\n|21 Oct 1958\n|TQ 57788 91558\n|\n|-\n|Boyles Court Cottages - 2 & 3\n|\n|1197204\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 58252 91178\n|\n|-\n|Boyles Court Cottages - 4 & 5\n|\n|1280225\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 58252 91178\n|\n|-\n|Boyles Court Cottages - 6 & 7\n|\n|1197205\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 58252 91178\n|\n|-\n|Barn at Boyles Court Farm\n|\n|1197206\n|II\n|5 September 1988\n|TQ 57848 91443\n|\n|-\n|Stables at Boyles Court Farm\n|\n|1206447\n|II\n|9 Dec 1994\n|TQ 57861 91412\n|\n|-\n|Blenheim House, Headquarters of the Royal Anglian Regiment\n|\n|1205940\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 59248 91507\n|\n|-\n|Chapel of the Royal Anglian Regiment and Essex Regiment\n|\n|1197197\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 59240 91416\n|\n|-\n|Brick House Hotel\n|\n|1263167\n|II\n|7 Jan 1955\n|TQ 59457 88864\n|\n|-\n|Church of St. Mary the Virgin\n|\n|1197210\n|I\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 58888 89990\n|\n|-\n|Lych Gate at the church of St. Mary the Virgin\n|\n|1206677\n|II*\n|16 March 1993\n|TQ 58922 89995\n|\n|-\n|Fairsteads\n|\n|1297229\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 58862 90177\n|\n|-\n|Great Ropers\n|\n|1206489\n|II*\n|21 Oct 1958\n|TQ 58597 91517\n|\n|-\n|Game Larder at Great Ropers\n|\n|1280198\n|II\n|21 Oct 1958\n|TQ 58597 91534\n|\n|-\n|Hill Cottage\n|\n|1293162\n|II\n|13 Nov 1989\n|TQ 58766 91518\n|\n|-\n|Hole Farmhouse\n|\n|1250606\n|II\n|14 Sep 1979\n|TQ 58564 89798\n|\n|-\n|Hulmers\n|\n|1250605\n|II\n|7 January 1955\n|TQ 59435 88917\n|\n|-\n|Oak Beam Cottage\n|\n|1206628\n|II\n|21 Oct 1958\n|TQ 58351 90648\n|\n|-\n|Post Office\n|\n|1293148\n|II\n|21 Oct 1958\n|TQ 58283 90657\n|\n|-\n|K6 Telephone Kiosk adjacent to the Post Office\n|\n|1297214\n|II\n|9 Jan 1989\n|TQ 58289 90652\n|\n|-\n|Stony Hills Farm\n|\n|1297215\n|II\n|9 Dec 1994\n|TQ 57708 90524\n|\n|-\n|The Red House\n|\n|1197260\n|II\n|21 Oct 1958\n|TQ 58307 90680\n|\n|-\n|The Squirrels\n|\n|1208575\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 58096 90318\n|\n|-\n|Thatchers Arms\n|\n|1208559\n|II\n|21 Oct 1958\n|TQ 58324 90718\n|\n|-\n|Thatched Cottage\n|\n|1205387\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 57970 90392\n|\n|-\n|Two Door Cottage\n|\n|1197209\n|II*\n|21 Oct 1958\n|TQ 58367 90668\n|\n|-\n|Wallets\n|\n|1197211\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 58323 90639\n|\n|-\n|Warley Elms\n|\n|1297230\n|II\n|20 Feb 1976\n|TQ 58799 90098\n|\n|-\n|Warley Place\n|\n|1000746\n|II\n|1 Jul 1987\n|TQ 58371 90979\n|\n|-\n|South Lodge to Warley Place\n|\n|1197261\n|II\n|21 Oct 1958\n|TQ 58329 90741\n|\n|-\n|}\nSports\nGreat Warley has a cricket field, the De Rougemont Cricket Ground, formerly the Great and Little Warley Cricket ground, and a golf course, Warley Park.\nFile:Warley Park Golf Course, Great Warley, Essex - geograph.org.uk - 16987.jpg|Warley Park Golf Course, Great Warley\nFile:Cricket Clubhouse, Great Warley, Essex - geograph.org.uk - 50665.jpg|Cricket Clubhouse at De Rougemont Cricket Ground, Great Warley\nNotable people\n•Ellen Willmott (1858 – 1934), renowned horticulturalist and recipient of the first Victoria Medal of Honour.\nExternal links\nReferences"
