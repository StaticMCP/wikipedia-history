Thus, the countries exchange high commissioners rather than ambassadors.\nHistory\nThe British Government opened its high commission in Apia in 2019. Previously British interests in Samoa were represented by the British high commissioner to New Zealand who was also accredited as high commissioner to Samoa.\nList of heads of mission\nHigh commissioners to Samoa\n*2006–2010: George Fergusson (non-resident)\n*2010–2014: Victoria Treadell (non-resident)\n*2014–2017: Jonathan Sinclair (non-resident)\n*2018–2019: Laura Clarke (non-resident)\n*2019–2023: David Ward\n*2023–: Gareth Keith Hoar, CVO\nReferences"
