It also produces general alarm calls when danger is not present. These calls have different pitches which indicate different levels of urgency for the family, could convey the predator's species, distance and elevation to the family all through alarm calls.\nSubspecies\n*Helogale hirtula hirtula\n*Helogale hirtula ahlselli\n*Helogale hirtula annulata\n*Helogale hirtula lutescens\n*Helogale hirtula powelli\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Ethiopian Dwarf Mongoose\n\n#REDIRECT Ethiopian dwarf mongoose"
