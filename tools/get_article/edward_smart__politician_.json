He attended Toowoomba State School and became an apprentice plumber. He acquired his own plumbing business in 1885 and eventually became a director of the Sugarloaf Colliery Company.\nOn 11 April 1895 he married Emma Jessie Hunt (died 1939) and together had three sons and two daughters. He died in November 1948 and was buried in the Drayton and Toowoomba Cemetery.\nPolitical career\nSmart, who was a member of the Independent Order of Rechabites, was an Alderman on the Toowoomba City Council from 1894 until 1900. When one of the sitting members for the Queensland state seat of Drayton & Toowoomba, John Fogarty died in 1904, Smart, representing the Labour Party, won the resulting by-election. He held the seat for three years, declining to stand at the 1907 state election.\nReferences"
