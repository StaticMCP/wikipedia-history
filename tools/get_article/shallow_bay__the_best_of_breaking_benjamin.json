The album features every single released by the band from 2002's Saturate to 2009's Dear Agony, with the exception of the 2010 digital single version of \"Blow Me Away\"; instead featuring the remix of that track featuring vocals of Sydnee Duran of Valora. A two-disc deluxe version was released alongside it, featuring remastered versions of B-sides, covers, acoustic performances, live recordings, and other rarities. Shallow Bay debuted at number 22 on the US Billboard 200, and sold an initial 13,700 copies. It topped the US Top Hard Rock Albums chart for three consecutive years, from 2011 to 2013, and also reached number four on the US Top Alternative Albums and US Top Rock Albums charts for 2011.\nDespite its name, the track \"Shallow Bay\" from Saturate does not appear on the album. The 2005 single \"Rain\" does not appear on the album either, but instead the 2004 studio version of the song which was never released as a single is also featured.\nBackground and release\nIn March 2010, Hollywood Records requested that the band produce two new master recordings, sought permission to release a new version of the hit song \"Blow Me Away\", featuring Sydnee Duran of Valora, and requested the production of Shallow Bay. In May 2011, guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark James Klepaski granted the record company's requests after they were offered a $100,000 payment. Benjamin Burnley, alleging that Fink and Klepaski did not inform him, the band's management, or the band's lawyer, fired the two via email, demanding at least $250,000 in compensatory and punitive damages, as well as the exclusive right to the name \"Breaking Benjamin\". Fink and Klepaski's attorneys stated the two \"dispute and strictly deny\" Burnley's allegations, instead asserting that \"at issue is the validity of a January 2009 partnership agreement giving Burnley permission to dismiss Fink and Klepaski for 'cause,'\" saying that the agreement was no longer valid due to Burnley's status of indefinite hiatus. The case was ordered by a judge to arbitration. Burnley's attorney, Brian Caplan, told the Associated Press, \"The relationship between Mr. Burnley and the two other members of the band has ended ... Mr. Burnley intends on moving forward using the name Breaking Benjamin and the band will continue. It just won't continue in its prior configuration. He's not retiring.\"\nIn August 2011, Hollywood Records scheduled the release of Shallow Bay, featuring every Breaking Benjamin single released, including the remix of \"Blow Me Away\". Burnley publicly opposed the album's release, saying content had been altered without his consent and did not meet his standards, refusing to consider it part of the official Breaking Benjamin catalog. The disc received positive critical reception, Loudwire giving the compilation a score of 4 out of 5, with The Daily Trojan praising it for balance and a progressive retrospective history, concluding with \"For the first-timers, welcome to Breaking Benjamin.\"\nTrack listing\n| length1       = 2:57\n| extra1        = Saturate (2002)\n| title2        = Skin\n| writer2       =\n| length2       = 3:21\n| extra2        = Saturate\n| title3        = Medicate\n| writer3       =\n| length3       = 3:46\n| extra3        = Saturate\n| title4        = So Cold\n| writer4       =\n| length4       = 4:34\n| extra4        = We Are Not Alone (2004)\n| title5        = Sooner or Later\n| writer5       =\n| length5       = 3:39\n| extra5        = We Are Not Alone\n| title6        = Rain\n| writer6       =\n| length6       = 3:25\n| extra6        = We Are Not Alone\n| title7        = The Diary of Jane\n| writer7       =\n| length7       = 3:20\n| extra7        = Phobia (2006)\n| title8        = Breath\n| writer8       =\n| length8       = 3:38\n| extra8        = Phobia\n| title9        = Until the End\n| writer9       =\n| length9       = 4:13\n| extra9        = Phobia\n| title10       = I Will Not Bow\n| writer10      =\n| length10      = 3:36\n| extra10       = Dear Agony (2009)\n| title11       = Lights Out\n| writer11      =\n| length11      = 3:35\n| extra11       = Dear Agony\n| title12       = Give Me a Sign\n| writer12      = Burnley\n| length12      = 4:19\n| extra12       = Dear Agony\n| title13       = Blow Me Away\n| note13        = featuring Valora\n| writer13      =\n| length13      = 3:09\n| title14       = Water\n| writer14      = Burnley\n| length14      = 4:02\n| extra14       = Breaking Benjamin (2001)\n| title15       = Had Enough\n| note15        = live acoustic\n| writer15      = Burnley\n| length15      = 4:16\n| extra_column  = Original release\n| total_length  = 55:50\n}}\n| length1       = 2:57\n| title2        = Skin\n| writer2       =\n| length2       = 3:21\n| title3        = Medicate\n| writer3       =\n| length3       = 3:46\n| title4        = So Cold\n| writer4       =\n| length4       = 4:34\n| title5        = Sooner or Later\n| writer5       =\n| length5       = 3:39\n| title6        = Rain\n| writer6       =\n| length6       = 3:25\n| title7        = The Diary of Jane\n| writer7       =\n| length7       = 3:20\n| title8        = Breath\n| writer8       =\n| length8       = 3:38\n| title9        = Until the End\n| writer9       =\n| length9       = 4:13\n| title10       = I Will Not Bow\n| writer10      =\n| length10      = 3:36\n| title11       = Lights Out\n| writer11      =\n| length11      = 3:35\n| title12       = Give Me a Sign\n| writer12      = Burnley\n| length12      = 4:19\n| title13       = Blow Me Away\n| note13        = featuring Valora\n| writer13      =\n| length13      = 3:09\n| total_length  = 47:32\n}}\n|length1   = 3:31\n|title2    = Water\n|note2     = remastered EP version\n|writer2   = Burnley\n|length2   = 4:02\n|title3    = Who Wants to Live Forever\n|note3     = Queen cover\n|writer3   = Brian May\n|length3   = 3:12\n|title4    = I Will Not Bow\n|note4     = acoustic + strings mix\n|writer4   =\n|length4   = 4:06\n|title5    = Better Days\n|note5     = previously unreleased\n|writer5   =\n|length5   = 3:23\n|title6    = Polyamorous\n|note6     = acoustic\n|writer6   =\n|length6   = 3:04\n|title7    = Lie to Me\n|note7     = previously unreleased\n|writer7   =\n|length7   = 4:05\n|title8    = Lady Bug\n|note8     = We Are Not Alone Japanese B-side\n|writer8   =\n|length8   = 3:02\n|title9    = Enjoy the Silence\n|note9     = Depeche Mode cover\n|writer9   = Martin Gore\n|length9   = 3:29\n|title10   = Until the End\n|note10    = live acoustic\n|writer10  =\n|length10  = 4:41\n|title11   = Breath\n|note11    = live acoustic\n|writer11  =\n|length11  = 4:56\n|total_length = 41:31\n}}\nPersonnel\nThe track numbers correspond to the deluxe edition.\n; Breaking Benjamin\n* Benjamin Burnley – vocals, guitar\n* Aaron Fink – lead guitar\n* Mark James Klepaski – bass guitar\n* Jeremy Hummel – drums\n* Chad Szeliga – drums and percussion\n; Additional musicians\n* David Bendeth – additional keyboards , programming\n* Wayne C.
