The years given are those in which the ceremonies took place.\nRules\nAnimated programs have the option to compete in broader program categories such as Outstanding Comedy Series, but cannot also submit for Outstanding Animation Program in the same year. The Simpsons, for instance, unsuccessfully submitted the episodes \"A Streetcar Named Marge\" and \"Mr. Plow\" in 1993 and 1994 while Family Guy was successfully nominated in 2009. Several animated programs won Outstanding Children's Program prior to 1979 and, in the years since, Rugrats, Winnie the Pooh specials and Star Wars Rebels have been nominated for that award.\nPrior to 1989, all of the nominated programs were specials produced outside the confines of a running series. The category was divided into programs \"one hour or less\" and \"more than one hour\" from 1989 to 2009, with episodes of running series becoming eligible. Programs that are 15 minutes or less were given their own category, Outstanding Short Form Animated Program, in 2008.\nWinners and nominations\n1970s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Program\n! width=\"65%\" | Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n|-\n|rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1979(31st)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\n| David D.
