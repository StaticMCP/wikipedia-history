      "text": "# Mackenzie dike swarm__disambig_1\n\nThe Mackenzie dike swarm, also called the Mackenzie dikes, forms a large igneous province in the western Canadian Shield of Canada. It is part of the larger Mackenzie Large Igneous Province and is one of more than three dozen dike swarms in various parts of the Canadian Shield.\nThe Mackenzie dike swarm is the largest dike swarm known on Earth, more than  wide and  long, extending in a northwesterly direction across the whole of Canada from the Arctic to the Great Lakes. The mafic dikes cut Archean and Proterozoic rocks, including those in the Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Thelon Basin in Nunavut and the Baker Lake Basin in the Northwest Territories.\nThe source for the Mackenzie dike swarm is considered to have been a mantle plume center called the Mackenzie hotspot. About 1,268&nbsp;million years ago, the Slave craton was partly uplifted and intruded by the giant Mackenzie dike swarm. This was the last major event to affect the core of the Slave craton, although later on some younger mafic magmatism registered along its edges.\nSee also\n*Bear River dikes\n*Coppermine River Group\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mantleplumes.org/GiantRadDykeSwarms.html Giant radiating dyke swarms: Characteristics and Origin of Giant Radiating Dyke Swarms]"
