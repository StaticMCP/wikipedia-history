The season premiered in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel on July 15, 2005, with the UK, Ireland, and Canadian premiere in January 2006. In fall 2005, airing of the second season halted, as it was part of Sci-Fi Channel's standard airing schedule normally used for its Stargate series, which was to split a 20-episode season into two parts (a \"winter season\" and a \"summer season\") to avoid heavy competition with major networks that follow a spring/fall schedule. Universal Home Video took this break as an opportunity to package the episodes aired thus far into a DVD set, calling it \"Season 2.0\". The final episode of the first half, \"Pegasus\", was originally 15 minutes too long for broadcast, but according to creator Ronald Moore, the production team decided to cut the episode to time rather than pad it out to fill 90 minutes, as this was deemed impractical. The longer version of \"Pegasus\" appears on the Battlestar Galactica Season 2.5 DVD set, which was released in the U.S. on September 19, 2006. Sky did not contribute financially to the second season, though UK broadcasts credit the company at the end of every episode.\nThe second half of season two (\"Season 2.5\") began airing on January 6, 2006, after a three-month hiatus, during which the Sci-Fi Channel mounted a huge publicity effort. Battlestar Galactica picked up considerable critical acclaim from the mainstream press, including being named the #1 show of 2005 by Time magazine, and being listed on numerous top ten lists of both 2005 and 2006 by publications such as the Chicago Tribune, Entertainment Weekly, Newsday and TV Guide. The American Film Institute also named it one of the ten best television shows of 2005. There was some criticism that a few episodes following \"Resurrection Ship, Part 2\" were not up to par with previous episodes, such as the episode \"Black Market\", for which even Ron Moore expressed some disdain. Moore stated in his blog that he felt this was a result of the larger workload the series faced with twenty episodes, instead of thirteen in season one. However, episode 15, \"Scar\", was thought to bring the series back up to its high level of quality, and subsequent episodes \"The Captain's Hand\", \"Downloaded\", and the two part finale \"Lay Down Your Burdens\", were hailed by fans and critics alike. Moore expressed that the longer break between seasons two and three (seven months instead of two) would help to ensure that all episodes were up to the high level of quality that the production team strove to maintain.\nReception\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 100% with an average score of 9.5 out of 10 based on 12 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"In its second season, Battlestar Galatica doubles down on the series' high-minded themes and satisfyingly complex storylines.\"\nAwards\n;Wins\n* 2005 Saturn Award for Best Syndicated/Cable Television Series\n* 2005 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television – James Callis\n* 2005 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television – Katee Sackhoff\n* 2006 Scream Award for Best Television Show\n* 2006 Spacey Awards for Best Television Show\n* 2005 Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Animated Character in a Live Action Broadcast Program, Commercial, or Music Video (Cylon Centurion in \"Fragged\")\n;Nominations\n* 2006 ALMA Award for Outstanding Actor in a Television Series – Edward James Olmos\n* 2006 Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series (\"Resurrection Ship, Part 2\")\n* 2006 Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Series (\"Lay Down Your Burdens, Part 2\")\n* 2006 Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Sound Mixing for a Series (\"Scattered\")\n* 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form (\"Pegasus\")\n* 2005 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television – Jamie Bamber\n* 2005 Saturn Award for Best Television Release on DVD (Season 2.0)\n* 2005 Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Animated Character in a Live Action Broadcast Program, Commercial, or Music Video (Cylon in \"Valley of Darkness\")\nHome video releases\nSeason 2.0 and 2.5 were released on DVD in region 1 on December 20, 2005, and September 19, 2006, respectively.
