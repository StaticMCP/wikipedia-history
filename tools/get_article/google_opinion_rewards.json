It was initially launched as a survey mobile app for Android and iOS developed by Google. The app allows users to answer surveys and earn rewards. On Android, users earn Google Play credits which can be redeemed by buying paid apps from Google Play. On iOS, users are paid via PayPal. Users in the available countries who are over 18 years old are eligible. Google Opinion Rewards works with Google Surveys, market researchers make the survey through Google Surveys and answers are received through Google Opinion Rewards by app users. This process provides surveyors with a large pool of surveyees quickly. This \"fast and easy\" surveying process has been criticized due to contention over the validity of results as well as concern over the privacy and security of the app users' data.\nHistory\nIn November 2013, the app was initially launched for Android users in US.\nIn April 2014, the app was made available in Australia, Canada and the UK. The first time the app has been available outside the US.\nIn August 2014, the app was made available to Germany and Netherlands.\nIn September 2014, the app was made available to Italy and Japan.\nIn June 2015, the app was made available to Mexico and Brazil.\nIn November 2015, the app was made available in Spain.\nIn May 2016, the app was made available to Denmark, Norway and Sweden.\nIn September 2016, the app was made available in France.\nIn December 2016, the app was made available to Switzerland and Austria.\nIn May 2017, the app was made available to India, Singapore and Turkey.\nIn October 2017, the app was launched for iOS users.\nIn November 2017, the app was made available to Belgium and New Zealand.\nIn May 2018, Google announced it would incorporate Cross Media Panel, another one of its rewards-based programs, into the Google Opinion Rewards program.\nIn December 2019, the app was made available in Taiwan.\nIn January 2020, the app was made available to Poland, Chile and United Arab Emirates.\nIn April 2020, the app was made available to Hong Kong and Malaysia.\nIn June 2020, the app was reached 50 million downloads on Google Play.\nIn November 2020, the app was made available in Thailand.\nIn July 2021, the app was made available to Czech Republic, Indonesia, Ireland, Russia and South Korea.\nIn March 2022, the app was made available to Colombia, Finland, Hungary, South Africa and Vietnam.\nIn September 2024, the app was reached 100 million downloads on Google Play.\nThe app is currently available for download in 39 countries.\nUser interface\nThe Google Opinion Rewards app is composed of one main page, displaying the balance and available tasks, leading users to the survey and back to the main page once submitted. The drop-down menu navigates users to their Reward history, Google Play account, or Settings.\nEach task consists of multiple pages, with the first explaining what the survey is about, followed by a series of multiple-choice questions, and finally one displaying the value of Google Play credits earned.\nFunctionality\nThe application provides a surveyor with a large group of people to answer market research questions. Surveyors purchase this service from Google through Google Consumer Surveys, providing researchers the ability to create an online survey with the survey question they want answered and publish it to one of Google's platforms, including Google Opinion Rewards.\nWhen users take a survey using Google Opinion Rewards, their answers are combined with the large pool of other respondents and shared with the market researcher. The respondents' demographics including age, gender and geographic location are inferred based on \"anonymous browsing history and IP address\" or taken from the demographics questions asked when setting up user account.\nApp monetization\nUsers can earn from $0.10 to $1 for each survey. A minimum of $2 must be earned to be eligible to receive rewards. Apple users can cash out the value of their earnings to their PayPal account. Android users can transfer the value of their earnings into Google Play credits to purchase other apps from the Google Play Store. These apps include digital books, TV shows, movies, games, and apps. Credits can also be used to make in-app purchases. If Android users want to exchange Google Play credits to cash, they can do so externally through third party apps that can exchange the Google Play credits to PayPal for a percentage of their earnings.\nThe rewards must be redeemed within one year from the date received, or else they will expire.\nCriticism\nGoogle Opinion Rewards offers benefits to both the surveyor and surveyee. The surveyor benefits from the large pool of surveyees achieved through the financial incentive and the wide demographic available online, in addition to the fast return of results, cost effective price and convenient surveying methodology. The surveyee benefits from the rewards offered in exchange for their time and opinion. However, online surveys have also sparked criticism due to highlighted concerns. The two common concerns regarding Google Opinion Rewards include the privacy and security of surveyee information and the validity of results.\nValidity of results\nThe validity of results produced is a major concern regarding online surveys. Google Surveys have been designed on a \"quick, inexpensive surveying\" model compared to traditional interview or paper methods. However, this quick and efficient method to increase the sample size raises the concern of validity, as people are perceived to not pay attention when partaking in an online survey. This is known as 'inattentive response behavior', 'satisficing behavior' or 'careless responding'.\nIn addition to the suspected satisficing and forging of data for financial reward, surveyors have been critical of the program's 'random' sampling methodology or rather the lack thereof. Online surveys attract surveyees from a \"highly selective subgroup of the general population\" whereby all respondents have a specific 'similar' demographic, economic status, values and habits, which can affect the randomization of participants selected within the sample. As noted by social scientist Helen Ball, \"It is not easy to use random sampling techniques with online surveys as there is no systematic way to collect a traditional probability sample of the general population using the internet\"\nTo overcome these issues, Google has introduced measures to enhance survey credibility and reliability.\nAddressing the concern regarding participants attentiveness, Google has introduced 'Attention checks' to deter careless responding behavior and forging of data. Google tests attentiveness by asking specific questions to ensure the surveyee is paying attention when taking surveys. Such questions include asking the surveyee to choose a specific choice from the multiple choices offered to ensure the question is read. If such questions are answered incorrectly the users account will be flagged and the user will receive fewer surveys. This action has increased researchers' confidence in the quality of their results and the \"internal validity of the research.\"\nFurthermore, the simple, \"fast and easy\" design adopted by Google for the online surveys has been recognised by economists Riccardo Vecchio, Gerarda Casoa, Luigi Cembaloa and Massimiliano Borrelloa as an effective display to ensure questions are understood and answered correctly, further enhancing the reliability of the results. They state, \"After beginning a survey, Google Opinion Rewards presents only one question to the user at a time, and they are only presented with the next question when they have answered the one presented to them. The presentation of each question is plain to ensure minimal misinterpretation of individuals in the user base.\"\nPrivacy and security of surveyee information\nPrivacy and security of surveyee information are of concern as Google Opinion Rewards collects information about the surveyee including their name, age and location in addition to the information provided in their responses.  While Google has been criticized for collecting data of users such as with their Screenwise Meter, people are generally aware that Google collects data, which Google claims is for the purpose of improving their services, however, users are worried their data would be sold to and accessed by other parties which may use the data for nefarious purposes or even spamming and targeted advertising.\nWhile adding this information online provides a form of transparency, contention remains as the extensive list of 'Data Linked To You' contains private information considered highly intrusive. Furthermore, users also remain unsure what 'broad terms' like 'other' data mean to their privacy, which falls under data that is linked to the user. Such data is collected and shared with the market researcher despite the user being uncertain about what it entails. It is for this reason that paid online surveys are often seen or perceived as a trade-off whereby, those surveyed trade their privacy for a reward.\nWhile Google clearly states its privacy policy, it has not disclosed the security measures in place to protect the app users' data that has been collected as it may contain private information that is highly demanded. Therefore, the security is especially of concern due to the information being stored online, which is susceptible to being intercepted or accessed by cyber criminals during a cyberattack.\nSee also\n* Crowdsource (app)\n* Google Surveys\n* Survey data collection\n* Paid survey\nReferences"
