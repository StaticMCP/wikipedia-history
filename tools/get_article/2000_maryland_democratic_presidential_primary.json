The Maryland primary was a closed primary, with the state awarding 95 delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of whom 68 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nVice president Al Gore won the primary with 67% of the vote. Senator Bill Bradley, who would withdraw in the days following from the presidential race but still competed for delegates, and  reached  only less than 28%, one of his lowest results so far in the race. The remaining 4% were separated between Lyndon LaRouche Jr. and the \"uncommitted\" option.\nProcedure\nMaryland was one of 15 states and one territory holding primaries on March 7, 2000, also known as \"Super Tuesday\".\nVoting took place throughout the state from 7&nbsp;a.m. until 8&nbsp;p.m. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15% at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable.
