There are three major hardware companies in Australia: Bunnings, Mitre 10 and Home Hardware. Home Hardware is a retailers' co-operative and has many banners which store owners trade under.\nSince the acquisition of Bunnings by Wesfarmers in 1994, the big-box store concept has changed how new hardware stores are built. In 2004, Mitre 10 built its first supercentre Mitre 10 MEGA with an average store size of 13,500 m2. These were later either closed or turned into large-concept Mitre 10 stores. In 2011 Masters Home Improvement entered the market and opened more than 49 stores, with an average footprint of 13,500&nbsp;m2. Masters Home Improvement, which was the second-largest hardware chain in Australia, closed in December 2016.\nBunnings also operates in New Zealand, competing against Mitre 10 New Zealand and Hammer Hardware.

They provide similar products to Western hardware stores, including plumbing and electrical supplies, tools, and some housewares.

Some rural hardware stores supply animal feed, such as chicken feed.\nCommon to most non-Western countries, China has specialty hardware stores, dedicated to selling products in a particular category.

All four report more than US$1&nbsp;billion in annual sales. Two of them operate as retailers' cooperatives: Do It Best Corp, from Fort Wayne Indiana, and Ace Hardware from Oakbrook Illinois. Hardware store owners purchase stock in these suppliers and may choose to include the name of the cooperative in the advertised name of the store.\nHardware stores also purchase from a variety of regional wholesalers and specialty manufacturers. Some hardware stores operate rental businesses which can offer equipment from construction tools to inflatable playhouses. The major hardware cooperatives provide brand name rental advertising and support for hardware store owners including Just Ask Rental, Party Central, Grand Rental Station and Taylor Rental, all four of which are brands owned by the True Value Company.\nElwood Adams Hardware of Worcester, Massachusetts claims to be the oldest operating hardware store in the US, having begun business in 1782.\nUnique services in hardware stores\nPart of the popularity of American hardware stores is the range of services they provide. Most retail outlets only sell goods, while some hardware stores custom-make or repair a large variety of household items. It is common for a hardware store in the US to repair broken windows and screens, repair power equipment such as lawn mowers, re-key entry locks, make copies of house keys and car keys, re-wire lamps and vacuum cleaners, sharpen knives and cutting tools, make minor repairs to faucet and shower parts, repair kerosene heaters and cut and thread plumbing pipe.\nHardware industry trade association\nThe North American Retail Hardware Association (NRHA) is a membership organization that provides training and resources for hardware store owners and publishes a trade magazine in print and online.\nSee also\n* American Hardware Manufacturers Association\n* National Hardware Show\n* DIY Week\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
