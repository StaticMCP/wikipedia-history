Kathiawar displaced  at standard load and  at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of  and a draught of . The ship's complement consisted of 60 officers and ratings.\nShe was powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of  and gave a maximum speed of . Kathiawar carried a maximum of  of fuel oil that gave her a range of  at .\nThe turbine-powered Bangors were armed with a 12-pounder  anti-aircraft gun and a single QF 2-pounder (4&nbsp;cm) AA gun. In some ships the 2-pounder was replaced by a single or twin  20 mm Oerlikon AA gun, while most ships were fitted with four additional single Oerlikon mounts over the course of the war. For escort work, her minesweeping gear could be exchanged for around 40 depth charges.\nConstruction and career\nHMIS Kathiawar was originally ordered from the Blyth Shipbuilding Company for the Royal Navy as HMS Hartlepool in 1939. However, before she was launched, she was transferred to the Royal Indian Navy and eventually commissioned as Kathiawar. Kathiawar was a part of the Eastern Fleet, and escorted numerous convoys between Africa, British India and Australia in 1943-45.\nAfter the Independence of India and the subsequent Partition, she was among the vessels transferred to Pakistan, where she was renamed PNS Chittagong.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
