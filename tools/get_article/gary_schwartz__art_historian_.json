He then moved with his family to Far Rockaway, Queens, at the age of twelve. In 1961, Schwartz received a Bachelor of Arts in Art History from New York University, where he was inspired to study the topic after taking an introductory course by the noted art historian H. W. Janson. Schwartz then continued to Johns Hopkins University, where he completed coursework towards a Doctor of Philosophy in Art History, focusing on medieval art. In 1965, Schwartz moved to the Netherlands to research Dutch Golden Age painting, never to return to the United States and abandoned completing his doctoral degree.\nIn 1966, Schwartz took up various jobs, including as a translator of Dutch and German texts, an assistant to Jan Gerrit van Gelder at Utrecht University, and editor of the journal Simiolus. Two years later, Schwartz also worked under Horst Gerson editing publications, and married Loekie Hendriks. In 1971, Schwartz established his own publishing firm called \"Uitgeverij Gary Schwartz\" in Maarssen, in order to print books that were considered important to the field of art from the Dutch Golden Age. Six years later, Schwartz published his first book, which was on the artist Rembrandt, titled Rembrandt: All the Etchings Reproduced in True Size.\nSchwartz continued research on Rembrandt, publishing several more books over the years and establishing himself as an expert on the artist. From 1986 to 1987, Schwartz conducted research at the Getty Center, and a year later, sold his publishing firm. However, he continued to work for the company until 1991.\nIn 1998, Schwartz founded CODART, a digital network for curators of art from the Low Countries. He served as its director until 2005, but continued to work for the network until 2008.\nIn 2009, Schwartz received the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds Prize for the Humanities, a lifetime achievement award.\nSelect works\n*Rembrandt: All the Etchings Reproduced in True Size (1977)\n*Rembrandt: Zijn Leven, Zijn Schilderijen (1984)\n*Rembrandt: His Life, His Paintings (1985)\n*Rembrandt (1992)\n*The Complete Etchings of Rembrandt (1994)\n*Bets and Scams: A Novel of the Art World (1996)\n*The Night Watch (2002)\n*The Rembrandt Book (2006)\n*''Rembrandt's Universe: His Art, His Life, His World (2006)\n*Meet Rembrandt: Life and Work of the Master Painter (2011)\n*Emotions: Pain and Pleasure in Dutch Painting of the Golden Age'' (2014)\nSee also\n*List of New York University alumni\n*List of people from Brooklyn\n*List of Rembrandt connoisseurs and scholars\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.garyschwartzarthistorian.nl/ Official website]\n*[https://arthistorians.info/schwartzg Dictionary of Art Historians profile]"
