It was established in 1994 and commemorates the life and work of Richard Imison.\nRichard Imison was Script Editor for BBC Radio Drama from 1963 to 1991. In the thirty years that Imison worked for BBC Radio Drama it was the largest patron of original creative dramatic writing in Britain. In his role as Script Editor no other single individual therefore had as much influence in either the discovery of new talent or the encouragement of established writers such as Edward Albee, Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, Alexander Gelman, Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett in the production of Drama for this genre.\nAfter his death in 1993 the Society of Authors established the Imison Award in recognition of Imison's enduring influence on the development of high quality dramatic writing.\nSubmissions for the award must consist of a completed nomination form as well as three copies of the writer's original script and recording of the broadcast. Further copies may be requested if the work is short-listed.  Further details can be found on the Society of Authors website.\nList of prize winners\nThe prize winners\n* 2025:  Tether  by Isley Lynn and Edson Burton\n* 2024: Benny & Hitch by Andrew McCaldon\n* 2023: The Making of a Monster by Connor Allen\n* 2022: The Lemonade Lads by Faebian Averies\n* 2021: Maynard by Fraser Ayres\n* 2020: Bathwater by Vicky Foster\n* 2019: Of A Lifetime, Lulu Raczka\n*2018: The Book of Yehudit, Adam Usden\n*2017: Comment Is Free, James Fritz\n*2016: 30 Eggs, Eoin O'Connor\n*2015: How to Say Goodbye Properly, E.V.
