He then practiced law in Colorado and Idaho. He served as regional director of a Migrant Law program and later became statewide director of a Native American Law program. He also studied at the General Theological Seminary graduating with a Master of Divinity in 1991. He was ordained deacon in 1990 and priest in 1991. His first post after ordination was as curate at Christ Church in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where he served from 1990 until 1994. Edwards also served as rector of St Francis' Church in Macon, Georgia, between 1994 and 2007 and dean of the region's convocation of congregations.\nIn 2017, he was reported to canon Alicia Schuster-Weltner at the Diocese of Atlanta for abuse of a parishioner from the years 1998-2007. Rather than investigate, the diocese chose to ignore the victim, so she had to go public with her claims.  In 2022, Anglican Watch posted an article with details about the alleged abuse.\nEdwards was elected on October 12, 2007, and was consecrated bishop on January 5, 2008, by his predecessor and Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori.\nSee also\n* List of Episcopal bishops of the United States\n* Historical list of the Episcopal bishops of the United States\nReferences\nhttps://www.anglicanwatch.com/when-church-collaborates-with-abuse/?amp=1"
