Much more than a throwaway project, it contains some of Common’s most insightful, daring, and overtly beautiful music in a decade.\"}}\n|}\nTrack listing\n| extra1 = Karriem Riggins\n| length1 = 2:14\n| title2 = Fallin'\n| note2 = with PJ\n| writer2 =\n| extra2 = Karriem Riggins\n| length2 = 3:57\n| title3 = Say Peace\n| note3 = with PJ featuring Black Thought\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 = Karriem Riggins\n| length3 = 4:11\n| title4 = What Do You Say (Move It Baby)\n| note4 = with PJ\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 = Karriem Riggins\n| length4 = 4:02\n| title5 = Courageous\n| note5 = with PJ featuring Stevie Wonder\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 =\n| length5 = 4:08\n| title6 = A Place In This World\n| note6 = with PJ\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 =\n| length6 = 3:35\n| title7 = A Riot In My Mind\n| note7 = featuring Chuck D and Lenny Kravitz\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 = Karriem Riggins\n| length7 = 5:13\n| title8 = Don't Forget Who You Are\n| note8 = with PJ\n| writer8 =\n| extra8 =\n| length8 = 2:53\n| title9 = A Beautiful Revolution\n| note9 = Outro; featuring Morgan Parker\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 = Karriem Riggins\n| length9 = 4:01\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Chart (2021)\n! scope=\"col\" |Peak position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |US Current Album Sales (Billboard)\n|94\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
