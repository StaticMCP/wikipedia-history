The Foreign Language Film award is handed out annually by the U.S.-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. Each year, the Academy invites countries to submit their best films for competition, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nThe Soviet Union had a strong record in the category, receiving nine nominations between 1968–1984, including three winners – War and Peace, Dersu Uzala and Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears. Eight of the nominees, including all three winners, were produced by Russian film studios.\nAfter 1992, the country was officially dissolved and succeeded by Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.\nSince then, the Russian Federation is the most successful country in the category, with seven nominations and one win for Burnt by the Sun.\nSubmissions\nwas the first Soviet director to win the award, for War and Peace.]]\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by the Soviet Union for review by the Academy since 1963. All Soviet submissions were filmed in Russian except for 1987's Georgian language Repentance.\nAmong the submissions were two films that sat on the shelf for several years awaiting approval from Soviet censors (1987–1988), a Japanese co-production (1975) and a documentary (1981). During the Soviet era, it was routine for productions to have cast and crew from throughout the country. However, each republic had its own film studios, and the \"Republic of Production\" indicates the republic of the film studio that produced the film. However, even outside of the Russian SFSR films were still produced in Russian, except for 1987 when the Soviet Union was nearing its collapse.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
