It is in the civil parish of Hurstbourne Priors.  The nearest town close to it is Whitchurch, which lies approximately  north from the hamlet.\nAccessing Tufton Warren is quite unusual, mainly because it is only accessible directly from a dual-carriageway, in this case being the A34. A crossroad-style junction formed of a gap in the central reservation leads to Tufton Warren in one direction, and Firgo in the other."
