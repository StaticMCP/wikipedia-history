The ceremony is to feature several category changes from the 2022 WhatsOnStage Awards, retiring the eight acting awards (Best Actor in a Musical, Best Actress in a Musical, Best Actor in a Play and Best Actress in a Play, Best Supporting Actor in a Musical, Best Supporting Actress in a Musical, Best Supporting Actor in a Play and Best Supporting Actress in a Play) in favour of four gender-neutral categories. In addition, the Best Takeover Performance award was reinstated, having last been presented at the 2015 ceremony, and two new categories: Best Professional Debut Performance and Best Concert Event, were introduced. The ceremony will be hosted for the first time by Legally Blonde stars Courtney Bowman and Billy Luke Nevers and Spring Awakening star Laurie Kynaston.\nThe stage adaptation of Hayao Miyazaki's acclaimed film My Neighbour Totoro received the most nominations with nine, while the revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! was the most nominated musical, with eight. Due to the continued large volume of eligible productions, the number of nominees in each category remained at six, following an increase at the previous ceremony.\nFor plays, My Neighbor Totoro was the night's big winner, receiving five awards, while Oklahoma and Legally Blonde won two awards each, becoming the joint most successful musicals at the ceremony. Prima Facie was notable for winning all three of the categories in which it was nominated and was the only other show to receive multiple wins.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominees for the 23rd WhatsOnStage Awards were announced on 8 December 2022 by As You Like It stars Leah Harvey and Alfred Enoch in a livestream from the green room @sohoplace.\nwon Best Performer in a Play for her role in the one-woman play Prima Facie.]]\nwon Best Performer in a Musical for her starring role as Elle Woods in Legally Blonde.]]\nwon Best Supporting Performer in a Musical for her role in Legally Blonde.]]\nwon Best Professional Debut Performance for his work in The Trials.]]\nwon Best Takeover Performance for assuming the role of Elphaba in Wicked.]]\nwon Best Direction for My Neighbour Totoro.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
