      "text": "# Prewar television stations\n\nThis is a list of pre-World War II television stations of the 1920s and 1930s. Most of these experimental stations were located in Europe (notably in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands, and Russia), Australia, Canada, and the United States. Some present-day broadcasters trace their origins to these early stations.\nAll television licenses in the United States were officially \"experimental\" before July 1941, as the NTSC television standard had yet to be developed, and some American television broadcasters continued operating under experimental licenses as late as 1947, although by then they were using the same technical standards as their commercial brethren.\nList\n* Present North American broadcast television starts at 54&nbsp;MHz (VHF)\n* Present day UK TV broadcasts begin at 470&nbsp;MHz (UHF)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Television stations\n|-\n!
