This riverboat was announced to assume the Queen of the Mississippi  name after the previous ship was repositioned to the  Columbia River and renamed in early 2016.  However, the American Eagle quietly assumed the name in 2016 without clarification of whether this vessel will become Queen of the Mississippi in 2017 or sail under a different name.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://americancruiselines.com/ Official website]"
