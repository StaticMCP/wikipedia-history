Slotwinski titled it The History of Muscovy War until the Capture of Smolensk.\nFollowing the example of Julius Caesar, Zolkiewski presents himself in the third person singular. The text includes a number of examples of the Macaronic language, and the memoir is regarded as one of the finest examples of works written in the Old Polish language.\nSources\n* Czaplinski W., \"Poczatek i progres wojny moskiewskiej\", in Literatura polska : przewodnik encyklopedyczny, vol. 2, Warsaw 1985, p. 182."
