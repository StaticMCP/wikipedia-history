In 1873, the original grist windmill was converted into a lighthouse by the Canadian Department of Marine. The lighthouse became known as Windmill Point Light.\nIn 1996 the Friends of Windmill Point opened the 60-foot-tall stone lighthouse tower to the public as Battle of the Windmill National Historic Site, a National Historic Site of Canada. Visitors are led on a guided tour of the tower, and can climb to the top just below the lantern room for a view of the St. Lawrence River. There are interpretive panels about the battle, a video presentation, and a gift shop. The tower is open weekends in June and September, and daily in July and August, and is located on Windmill Point Road, off Highway 2, 3&nbsp;km east of the town of Prescott, Ontario.\nSee also\n*Fort Wellington National Historic Site\nReferences\n*Graves, Donald E., Guns Across the River: The Battle of the Windmill, 1838, 2001, The Friends of Windmill Point, Prescott, Ontario.\nExternal links\n*[https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/on/windmill Battle of the Windmill National Historic Site] - Parks Canada official site\n*[http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=1099 Windmill Point Light] Lighthousefriends.com"
