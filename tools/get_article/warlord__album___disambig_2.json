It was released on 25 February 2016 by YEAR0001. It was recorded between spring and autumn 2015, across Florida and Stockholm. A deluxe edition was released on 28 April 2016.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Crack Magazine\n| rev2Score = 5/10\n| rev3 = HipHopDX\n| rev3Score = 3.4/5\n}}\nSteve Mallon of Crack Magazine wrote that \"As with much of Lean’s output, tracks like Fantasy, Highway Patrol and Afghanistan feature crystalline instrumentals, but are let down by uninspired lyricism and stilted delivery\" while Ural Garrett of HipHopDX said \"Regardless of some unintentional missteps, Warlord explores the mind of a man already turned cynical toward fame, even if it’s only by the binary codes of the web.\"\nSome reviews were far less positive however. Tiny Mix Tapes wrote in a more negative piece that \"listening to Warlord is like thinking of Napoleon beating himself up. It’s intentional. But being played a fool and submitting are different topics (wholly); it’s fucking cold up in here. So I see you, Yung Lean. You’re just stoked because you were the first to grab the name Warlord across all gaming platforms. Human beings are liars. All of them.\"\nTrack listing\n| length2       = 3:33\n| title3        = Fantasy\n| note3         = featuring Lil Flash\n| extra3        =\n| length3       = 3:09\n| title4        = Afghanistan\n| extra4        =\n| length4       = 2:47\n| title5        = Hoover\n| extra5        = Yung Gud\n| length5       = 2:39\n| title6        = Fire\n| extra6        = Whitearmor\n| length6       = 3:08\n| title7        = Stay Down\n| extra7        =\n| length7       = 3:13\n| title8        = Eye Contact\n| extra8        = Whitearmor\n| length8       = 3:41\n| title9        = More Stacks\n| extra9        =\n| length9       = 3:23\n| title10       = AF1s\n| note10        = featuring Ecco2K\n| extra10       =\n| length10      = 3:41\n| title11       = Hocus Pocus\n| note11        = featuring Bladee\n| extra11       =\n| length11      = 3:31\n| title12       = Shawty U Know What It Do\n| extra12       =\n| length12      = 2:11\n| title13       = Miami Ultras\n| extra13       =\n| length13      = 4:24\n| total_length  = 41:42\n}}\n| length1       = 4:10\n| title2        = God Only Knows\n| extra2        =\n| length2       = 3:34\n| title3        = How U Like Me Now?\n| note3         = featuring Thaiboy Digital\n| extra3        = Yung Gud\n| length3       = 3:53\n| title4        = Pearl Fountain\n| note4         = featuring Black Kray and Bladee\n| extra4        =\n| length4       = 3:14\n| title5        = Stars Align\n| extra5        = Yung Sherman\n| length5       = 4:23\n| title6        = Shine\n| extra6        =\n| length6       = 4:51\n| total_length  = 65:47\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
