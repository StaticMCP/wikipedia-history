Both were veterans of WWI who went on to study under Charles D'Ebro. They are best known for designing the Shrine of Remembrance in  Melbourne.\nHudson & Wardrop\nAfter forming an alliance in 1919, Hudson and Wardrop entered the competition for the National War Memorial in 1923 and won first prize. The Shrine is known to be Melbourne's most important Public Monument. The design for the shrine was based on the Parthenon in Athens and the tomb of Mausolus, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and symbolizes both the democratic tradition for which the soldiers died and the eternity of their afterlife. In 1929 Hudson and Wardrop partnered with architect and engineer Kingsley Ussher particularly to check calculations for the 'eye of light' at the shrine.\nThe proposal\nThey compiled a booklet The First Brochure on the First Premiated Design. The National War Memorial of Victoria, 1928.\nFrom the brochure:\nSeveral months were devoted by the architects, Messrs. Hudson & Wardrop, to the consideration of the character of the Memorial. It was thought that in accordance with the established custom of observing on Armistice Day, (at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month) a period of silence, the Memorial must be a silent one. Further, a Memorial to our country's sacrifice in the Great War calls neither for \"A Shaft of Might\" nor \"An Arch of Triumph\"; but for a \"Shrine of Remembrance\" which, by its nobility of mass and line will perpetually inspire men to dedicate themselves to the cause for which the Memorial stands.\nThe theme is Remembrance, and the design is indicative of Remembrance. It is Australian in feeling, in that it stands for the highest of Australian ideals - ideals we fought for—Patriotism, Sacrifice, Justice, and Freedom. Further, the climax of a pilgrimage to the Memorial is at \"The Rock of Remembrance\" lit by the eye of light}} and emblematically guarded by the best of virtues striven for by our glorious dead.\nThe Site has not an abrupt rise and calls for a structure rather growing out of the contour of the hill than rising abruptly from it. Further, the Memorial is so situated on the site that it will be clearly visible from the heart of the city and easy of access from all approaches—thus bringing the purpose of the Memorial into the daily lives of our citizens.\nIt stands out and dominates the surrounding country, and will be a landmark for all shipping navigating Port Phillip.\nThe company\nIn 1946 Robert F. Howden joined the firm as junior partner. A year later Stevenson joined to form Hudson Stevenson Partners. The sudden death of Hudson and the illness of Stevenson led Howden to run the practice.\nHugh McLean joined, renaming the firm Hudson Stevenson Howden & McLean. Howden became senior partner followed by the death of Stevenson and the firm became both architects and engineers. It was renamed Howden and McLean and now continues as Howden & Wardrop Pty Ltd, Architects & Engineers at 24 Albert Road South Melbourne.\nPersonal\nHudson was born in Auckland, New Zealand, the son of Charles Hudson, Railway Commissioner of Victoria. As a child he attended Wellington College in New Zealand and moved to The Friends College High School to continue his education in his early teens. In 1903 Hudson moved to Melbourne and attended Melbourne University to pursue a career in Architecture.\nHudson was articled to Anketell Henderson in 1904 and began a practice with D’Ebro over the period of 1904-09. Soon after he established a practice of his own in 1909. Hudson also began teaching architectural drafting with Harold Desbrowe-Annear and Haddon at the Working Mens College, now known as RMIT University.\nA year later, he met Ethel Elise Vincent and was married on 14 December 1910. Ethel gave birth to one son and two daughters and lived in their home in Garden Vale which was designed by Hudson himself in 1914.\nBorn in 1891, James Hastie Wardrop was enlisted in A.I.F. in October 1915, and served in Europe before traveling to England to study briefly in 1919.\nNotable projects\nPhilip Hudson\n*1914: Own house at Garden Vale\n::Villa at Garden Vale.\n::Victoria House apartments 220 Clarendon Street, East Melbourne\n*1915: Geelong grammar school chapel in association wit Gerard Wight\n::Villa in Lansell Road, Toorak.\n*1919; Architect Philip B.
