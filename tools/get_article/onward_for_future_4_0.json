They announced 44 members including leadership figures, such as Park Hwee-rak (Chief Deputy President), Song Geun-john (Deputy President), Park Ju-won (Secretary-General), Lee Jong-hyuk (General Chairman of the Organising Committee), and Kim Won-sung (Chairman of the Strategic Planning Committee). They also recruited 86 members — 14 for entrepreneurship, economy, labour and renovation, 7 for security and industrial security, 51 for youth startup, and 14 for youth student councils.\nOn 19 January 2020, the party was officially established. However, after a month, it was merged into the United Future Party.\nIdeology and policies\nThe party described themselves as centre-right, seeks youth politics and supported freedom and democracy. The name, \"Onward\", was inspired from the La République En Marche! of France.\nThe party was also strongly anti-communist. Park Hwee-rak, the Chief Deputy President called the ruling Democratic Party of Korea as \"left-wing party who communise the Republic\". It wanted to end populist welfare policy while seeking public and labour reform.\n4.0\nThe party added \"4.0\" into its name, which means:\n* \"1.0\" - Establishment\n** On 15 August 1948, the former President of the Republic Syngman Rhee, and the other heroes and heroines, established this country, and defended freedom and democracy against communism.\n* \"2.0\" - Industrialisation\n** From 1960s to 1980s, the country was industrialised by sending troops to South Vietnam, miners and nurses to West Germany, and construction workers to the Middle East.\n* \"3.0\" - Democratisation\n** Although the country achieved a democratisation, there were several fakers and hypocrites who endangered the social value and brought a chaotic age.\n* \"4.0\" - Future\n** In future, we should end this chaotic age and rebuild a free and fair society.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.xn--ok1b121boib.kr/ Official website]"
