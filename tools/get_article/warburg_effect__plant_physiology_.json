      "text": "# Warburg effect (plant physiology)\n\nIn plant physiology, the Warburg effect is the decrease in the rate of photosynthesis due to high oxygen concentrations.  Oxygen is a competitive inhibitor of carbon dioxide fixation by RuBisCO which initiates photosynthesis.  Furthermore, oxygen stimulates photorespiration which reduces photosynthetic output. These two mechanisms working together are responsible for the Warburg effect.\nReferences"
