The Mapia Atoll are the outermost part of the current Papua Province and directly border the Republic of Palau.\nHistory\n's 1903 expedition to Papua, King Marwedi third from right.]]\nInitially, the Mapia Atoll were inhabited by native people who practiced and spoke Austronesian languages, just like the people of the Pacific Islands in general, The most visible similarity is with the inhabitants of the Caroline Islands in Micronesia, namely in customs, habits of the population, and construction of traditional houses. The native inhabitants of the Mapia Atoll are called the Mapia people who speak the Mapia language, which is a language in the Micronesian languages.\nCurrently, the Mapia Atoll are no longer inhabited by the native Mapia people but are inhabited by Biak people who come from Biak Island and its surroundings. Before contact with other peoples of Malay Archipelago and European traders, it is believed that Papuans from Biak Island and its surroundings had trade and hunting contacts with the Mapia Atoll. Biak people who have arrived on this islands will mark themselves with a tattoo of a seagull, namely a Manmarmar or Mankabes. Therefore, this islands is also called Myos Maninei ().\nIn the 19th century, the Dutch government began to control this island and appointed the native population with the title of Sangaji Meraudi (Marawidi or Marwedi) under the Sultanate of Tidore. Among its territory areas are three islands, Pegun (Mapia) as the center, Bras, and Fanildo, the smallest island.\nList of rulers\n*Marwedi (ruled in 1898)\nSee also\n*Mapia Atoll\n*Mapia language\nReferences"
