He ruled the state between 320 BC and 318 BC.\nKuai was the son of King Yi, whom he succeeded to the throne. In 318 BC, Lu Maoshou (鹿毛壽) persuaded him to resign the throne in favor of the powerful chancellor Zizhi (子之) to \"prove his humility\". Kuai did so and even removed his crown prince from power. In 314 BC, Crown Prince Ping (太子平) revolted against Zizhi, but was failed and killed in action. Encouraged by Mencius and other ministers, King Xuan of Qi sent Kuang Zhang (匡章) to attack Yan in 314 BC. Yan was practically conquered by Qi, and both Kuai and Zizhi were killed.\nReferences"
