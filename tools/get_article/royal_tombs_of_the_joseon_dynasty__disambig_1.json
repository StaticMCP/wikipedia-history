These tombs are scattered over 18 locations across the Korean Peninsula. They were built to honor and respect the ancestors and their achievements and assert their royal authority. Two other Joseon tombs, located in Kaesong, North Korea, were proposed but not submitted.\nStructure of the tombs\nThe royal tombs can be divided into three main sections:\nArea around Jeongjagak\nIt is the meeting point between the dead and the living. The area around Hongsalmun gate is the space for the living.\nArea just past the gate\nThis is the space between the earthly and the holy. This is the area where the spirits of the kings and queens meet their earthly worshippers. This area also contains the Jeongjagak shrine, the Subokbang, and the Suragan buildings.\nThe sacred ground of the grave mounds\nThis area also includes the wall and the other stone structures.\nOther structures\nOther structures include:\n# Gokjang – these are the five sides of walls around the grave mound that protects the sacred area.\n# Seokho – the tiger deity which serves as the guardian of the Bongbun.\n# Seogyang – a sheep statue which fends off the evil spirits from earth and prays for the souls of the departed.\n# Mangjuseok – this is a pair of stone pillars erected on both sides of the mound.\n# Bongbun – this is where the body of the king or queen lies. It is also called Neungchim or Neungsang.\n# Nanganseok – it is the hedge-like stone which protects the Byeongpungseok.\n# Honyuseok – a rectangular stone erected in front of the mound which is believed to invite the soul to come out and play.\n# Muninseok – statues of scholars placed on the left and right sides of the Jangmyeongdeung lantern.\n# Jangmyeongdeung – a lantern which comforts and prays blessing over the soul.\n# Seongma – a horse statue.\n# Muinseok – statue of a soldier said to be guarding the king and is placed below the Muninseok.\n# Yegam – it is located on the left-side corner behind the Jeongjagak and is used for burning the written prayers after a burial service.\n# Bigak – a building which has a stone monument where the names of the king and the queen are written at the front, while at the back was written the list of the king's accomplishments.\n# Jeongjagak – this is where memorial services are held; it refers to a pavilion that is shaped like the hanja character 丁(Jeong; 정) when viewed from above.\n# Chamdo – these are two stone-covered paths that lead to the Jeongjagak. The higher path is called Sindo (The Path of the Gods), while the lower path is called Eodo (The Path of the King). Only the Eodo path can be used by visitors under Korean customs.\n# Suragan – this is where the food for the memorial services is brought and prepared.\n# Subokbang – this is the living quarter of the officer guarding the tomb.\n# Baewi – this is where the king and memorial service officials knelt in honor of the deceased king. It is also called Panwi or Eobaeseok.\n# Hongsalmun – this is the gate with two red cylindrical pillars.\n# Byeongpungseok – it is the stone which was placed underneath and around to protect the Bongbun.\nTombs\nThe tombs are classified into two types. The kings and queens and those posthumously granted the title of king or queen, were interred in reung (陵; 릉)-type tombs. Crown princes and their wives were interred in won (園; 원)-type tombs.\nOther members of the royal family were interred in myo (墓; 묘)-type tombs.\nThe royal tombs are scattered over 18 locations, with many of them located as far as 40 kilometers from Seoul. For example, Jangneung is in Yeongwol, Gangwon Province, while Yeongneung is in Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province. Tombs were made for individuals as well as family groups. There are 40 reung-type and 13 won-type tombs, thus creating a total of 53 royal tombs.\nJoseon-era royal tombs followed the guidelines outlined in Chinese Confucian texts, such as the Book of Rites (Li Ji) and the Rites of Zhou (Zhou Li). Many factors went into consideration when deciding the location of a tomb, such as the distance from Hanseong (present-day Seoul), the distance between other royal tombs, the accessibility of the location, and Korean traditions of pungsu (geomancy). The tomb construction also took into account the traditional burial rituals of Korea and the natural environment.\nThere now follows a list (in alphabetical order) of the individual (or clusters of) tombs. There are two more royal tombs from the Joseon era in Kaesong, North Korea, namely Jereung () (the tomb of Queen Sinui, first wife of King Taejo) and Hureung () (the tombs of King Jeongjong and Queen Jeongan).\nDonggureung (동구릉)\nThis cluster is the best sample of group tombs from the Joseon era and represents the evolution of tomb architecture over a period of five hundred years. Seven kings and ten queens are interred in nine reung-type tombs. The most notable in this group is Geonwolleung (건원릉) for King Taejo, the founder of the Joseon dynasty. The other tombs in the cluster are Gyeongneung (경릉) (King Heonjeong and his two wives, Queen Hyohyeon and Queen Hyojeong), Hyereung (혜릉) (Queen Danui, first wife of King Gyeongjong), Hwireung (휘릉) (Queen Jangnyeol, second wife of King Injo), Mongneung (목릉) (King Seonjo and his two wives, Queen Uiin and Queen Inmok), Sungneung (숭릉) (King Hyeonjong and Queen Myeongseong), Sureung (수릉) (Crown Prince Hyomyeong, who was posthumously honored as King Munjo, and Queen Sinjeong), Wolleung (원릉) (King Yeongjo and his second wife, Queen Jeongsun) and Myeongbinmyo (명빈묘) (Royal Noble Consort Myeong of the Andong Kim clan, a concubine of King Taejong). The cluster is situated on the west bank of the Wangsukcheon Stream in the city of Guri, Gyeonggi Province.\nGwangneung (광릉)\nGwangneung is a pair of tombs in the city of Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province. The tombs, arranged in a V shape, contain the remains of King Sejo and his wife, Queen Jeonghui. They were built in 1468 and 1483 respectively. Gwangneung is important because changes taking place in the architecture of royal tombs are evident in its construction. Screening rocks were not installed at this tomb. Instead of an outer coffin stone, quicklime was used. Another break from tradition was that the reverential access was not built. Finally, only one T-shaped ritual shrine was built for both burial mounds. This change in tomb architecture came from the last wishes of the king and reflects a new frugal style that influenced later royal tomb construction.\nHeonilleung (헌인릉)\nHeolleung:\nIlleung:\nThis site is located in the south of Seoul, at the bottom of the southern slope of Daemo Mountain. Heolleung is a pair of tombs holding the remains of Taejong of Joseon and Queen Wongyeong, while Illeung is a single mound situated two hundred meters to the west and holds the remains of King Sunjo and Queen Sunwon.\nHongyureung (홍유릉)\nHongneung:\nYureung:\nYeongwon:\nThe styles of the two main tombs reflect the political changes experienced by Korea during the waning days of the Joseon dynasty. With the declaration of the Korean Empire, the style of the tombs of the last two rulers, Emperor Gojong and Emperor Sunjong were designed to reflect their imperial, rather than royal status. Hongneung holds the remains of Emperor Gojong and Empress Myeongseong. Yureung holds the remains of Emperor Sunjong and his two wives, Empress Sunmyeong and Empress Sunjeong. Other notable tombs include Yeongwon (영원), the tomb of Yi Un, Crown Prince Euimin and Yi Bang-ja, Crown Princess Euimin. They are located in the city of Namyangju, just to the east of Seoul.\nJangneung (Gimpo) (김포 장릉)\nThere are three locations with Joseon tombs named Jangneung.

It holds the remains of King Injo and his first wife, Queen Inyeol.\nJangneung (Yeongwol) (영월 장릉)\nThis tomb lies in the county of Yeongwol, Gangwon Province and is the furthest from the capital.
