In 2020, he founded Circle Pictures.\nArtist\nMackinnon studied at the Edinburgh College of Art where he was awarded an Andrew Grant Scholarship before moving to London to attend the Royal College of Art where he won the Drawing Prize and contributed to and co-edited the RCA magazine Ark in the 1970s.\nMackinnon designed the artwork for the British TV movie The War Game and went on to draw illustrations for Oz, Nova, Time Out, the Edinburg Review, Spare Rib, Ambit, The Times, Sunday Times and Management Today, and was featured in the Radical Illustrators issue of Illustrators magazine (no.38) published in 1981 by the Association of Illustrators in which co-editor George Snow singled out Mackinnon as “perhaps the greatest single influence on today’s Radical Illustrators.”\nProducer\nIn the 1970s and 80s Mackinnon directed and produced a number of films including the Brechtian film Because I am King and Ends and Means written by Andy McSmith.\nMackinnon went on to found Trade Films which produced films and television such as ''The Miners' Campaign Video Tapes, When the Dog Bites, Woodbine Place, Border Crossing'', an interview with Paul Rotha, and the Northern News Reel, which was distributed to trade unions and members of the Labour movement around the UK. Working closely with Murray Martin (Amber Films) and other independent film makers, Stewart was closely involved in devising the Workshop Declaration (1982) in partnership with the film union ACTT and Channel 4. The Workshops worked with their local communities, women's organisations and ethnic minority communities, and by 1988, some 44 workshops had had films funded and screened by Channel 4. So began a decade of experiment with progressive and aesthetically avant-garde documentaries and dramas screened on British television, which continued until 1990.
