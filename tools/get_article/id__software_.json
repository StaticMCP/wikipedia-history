It is the most popular and the default editor on the main OSM page. iD's features include choosing custom aerial imagery and native support for Mapillary photos.\nHistory\nPrior to iD, the primary web editor for OpenStreetMap data was the Flash-based Potlatch 2 editor. The iD editor project was founded by the author of Potlatch 1 and 2, Richard Fairhurst, online on July 13, 2012 and at the State of the Map conference on October 14, 2012.\nIn September 2012, the Knight Foundation announced the winners of the Knight News Challenge: Data competition. The team from Development Seed/Mapbox was selected as a winner for their proposal to develop new contribution tools for OpenStreetMap and was awarded a grant of $575,000.\nThis editor was meant to be a Potlatch 2 architecture reimplementation in JavaScript with redesigned user interface. The only big internal change was a departure from XML tagging preset architecture to a JSON-based one.\nIn 2013, iD became the default editor on OSM.org, making it the most used OSM editor by changeset count.\nForks\niD has spawned several forks for specialized use cases. In 2018, Facebook created RapiD, with provided access to machine learning–generated roads and buildings under the name MapWithAI, which users could verify before uploading to OSM. In 2023, RapiD was renamed Rapid and MapWithAI renamed Rapid Assist.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://id.raifer.tech/sotm-2022/ iD version archive]"
