The accolade was presented at the Brit Awards, an annual celebration of British and international music. The winners and nominees were determined by the Brit Awards voting academy with over one-thousand members comprising record labels, publishers, managers, agents, media, and previous winners and nominees.\nThe inaugural recipients of the award are The Darkness, who won in 2004. The category only featured bands as nominees until it was revived in 2022. Muse, Kasabian and Tom Grennan hold the record for most nominations without a win, with two. Sam Fender is the first solo artist to win the category, and is the current holder after winning for a second time in 2025.\nHistory\nThe Brit Award for British Rock Act was first presented at the 2004 Brit Awards and last presented in 2006.\nIn 2021, it was announced that the category had been revived and renamed British Rock/Alternative Act following the removal of gendered categories. This new iteration of the award was first presented at the 42nd Brit Awards and is voted for by the public on TikTok alongside the three other genre categories (Pop/R&B Act, Dance Act and Hip Hop/Grime/Rap Act).\nWinners and nominees\nBritish Rock Act (2004–2006)\n]]\n]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
