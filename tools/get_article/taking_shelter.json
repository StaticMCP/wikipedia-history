In the realm of storytelling she does, indeed, 'make something' of value.\"\nPublication history\nAfter its original publication in 1989 in Australia by publisher Penguin Books the novel was later reprinted as follows:\n* Viking, Australia, 1990\n* Untapped, Australian, 2021\nAwards\n* Miles Franklin Award, shortlisted 1991\nSee also\n* 1989 in Australian literature\nReferences"
