It was built about 1845 and is a three-story, gable-roofed brick building with a symmetrical five-bay facade and a three-story ell to the rear. It is in a restrained form of the Greek Revival style. The front facade features a portico and massive pilasters added sometime after 1929.\nIn 2010, a second location of the popular Wilmington, DE restaurant Catherine Rooney's moved into the original section of this building. As of 2025, this space is now occupied by the Greenhouse Gastropub.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\nReferences"
