These artifacts, which include gold ornaments, carved stones, and ceremonial tools, have been discovered at excavation sites such as El Caño, Sitio Conte, and Cerro Juan Díaz. Archaeological and ethnographic studies indicate that the presence of ritual specialists, often identified as shamans, in Panama dates back at least 3,000 years. Further findings suggest that shamanistic practices were well-established by the Coclé culture (750–950 CE), as evidenced by artifacts linked to ceremonial activities. Some indigenous groups, including the Ngäbe and Buglé peoples, continue to observe ritual practices involving sacred plants, ceremonial objects, and traditional healing methods.\nShaman Stones\nThe earliest known shamanic artifacts discovered in Panama consist of a collection of 12 stones found at the Casita de Piedra rock shelter near Boquete. Excavated in 2007, these stones date to approximately 4,000 to 4,800 years ago and represent some of the earliest material evidence of ritual practices in lower Central America. The assemblage includes quartz, pyrite, chalcedony, and a modified dacite cylinder, which are interpreted as objects associated with ceremonial or ritualistic activities.\nReferences"
