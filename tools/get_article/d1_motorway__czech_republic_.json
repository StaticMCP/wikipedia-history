It routes from Prague to Brno and on to the Polish border, although there is currently a small section still under construction. Once completed its length will be . It is the busiest motorway in the Czech Republic, with a maximum AADT of 99,000 vehicles per day near Prague.\nChronology\nFirst attempt\nThe Munich Agreement in 1938 deprived the country of some fundamental road and rail routes. The government rushed to prepare three major infrastructure projects: the Německý Brod – Brno railway; the Plzeň – Ostrava road; and a 4-lane highway from Prague to Velký Bočkov (on the Czechoslovak – Romanian border). On 23 December 1938 the government issued Decree no. 372/1938 Coll. concerning the construction of motorways, establishing the General Motorway Directorate. This decree called for construction of an east-west motorway within four years.\nAs of January 1939, the General Motorway Directorate had 108 employees. On 13 January 1939, the Prague – Jihlava – Brno – Slovak border motorway project was approved, and construction was started on two segments: Chodov (now part of Prague) – Humpolec; and Zástřizly – Lužná. The prime minister of Carpathian Ruthenia, Avgustyn Voloshyn, requested that the Slovak border – Chust segment be added to the plan as well. Construction began on the Zástřizly – Lužná segment on 24 January in Zástřizly in the Chřiby mountains.\nThe German occupation of Czechoslovakia brought only small technical changes to the project, and the construction of another segment, Chodov – Humpolec, began in May 1939. The increasing demands of World War II slowed down the construction, and the works were completely halted in 1942. After the war the works were resumed mainly on major bridges in 1946, but only with a small workforce.\nAfter 1948 the works continued. But in January 1949 the segment in Chřiby was abandoned, and the Prague – Humpolec segment met the same fate one year later. All 77 km of motorway under construction at that time, including 60 bridges, remained in disuse.\nSecond attempt\n]]\nIn the 1960s, traffic was growing very quickly, and a new plan for a D1 highway from Prague to the Soviet Union border was formulated. Work on the Prague – Brno section started in 1967, mainly using the old route from the first attempt. The 21-km long Prague – Mirošovice segment was completed in July 1971, and the 205-km long route to Brno was finished in November 1980.\nIn Slovakia, construction started in 1973 with the 14-km long Ivachnová – Liptovský Mikuláš section, together with the construction of the Liptovská Mara dam. The 19-km Prešov – Košice motorway was added in 1980. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s the 19-km long Brno – Vyškov segment was built, along with another 20 km from Liptovský Mikuláš to Hybe in Slovakia.\nAfter the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, construction was no longer planned to Slovakia, but instead to Lipník nad Bečvou (the replacement of the planned route is the R49 expressway). Due to growing traffic near Prague, the first segment to Mirošovice was widened from 4 lanes to 6 lanes, and there are similar plans for widening around Brno as well. After the dissolution, no new sections were built. In 2002, construction of an 18-km long extension from Vyškov eastwards started. It was opened in 2005. More extensions eastwards were opened in 2008, 2009 and 2010; in 2011, the motorway reached the junction with the R55 expressway and the R49 expressway near Hulín, and the route curved north to Přerov (and Lipník nad Bečvou).\nThe segment from Lipník nad Bečvou to Ostrava was constructed from 2004 – 2009. Due to historical reasons it was named the Motorway D47; however, it was opened as part of the D1. The segment from Ostrava to the Polish border (and Autostrada A1) opened in late 2012, but only for cars under 3.5 tonnes, because the Polish side had problems with the bridge at Mszana village. From 2014 the bridge is open, and it is possible to drive from Ostrava to the Polish border and on to Katowice. The Přerov – Lipník nad Bečvou segment opened in December 2019.\nRecategorisation of the Prague section\nIn 2022, the re-categorisation of the section from the zero kilometre at Chodov across the Prague border (km 5.2) to the crossing with the Prague ring road (km 10.2) as a local road, together with the transfer of the Prague section (including buildings and land by a donation contract) to the ownership of the City of Prague was prepared. On 4 February 2022, ŘSD and Prague concluded a future donation agreement. The city council approved the plan on 17 May 2022, and the city council by resolution No. 37/42 on 26 May 2022.\nThe donation contract, by which the state, through ŘSD, donated the first 5.2 km of the motorway to the capital city of Prague, was concluded on 29 June 2022 and published on 19 December 2022; the contract quantified the book value of the donated property at CZK 4,793,160,294. The Prague section of the motorway (km 0 - 5.2) was re-categorised as a local first class road. In the contract, Prague undertook the task of modifying the traffic signs on the date of the Prague ring road's commissioning in the section between Běchovice, and the D1 motorway.\nAs of 1 January 2023, it was announced that the section km 0.0-5.2 would be transferred to the ownership of the City of Prague and removed from the toll network. The section was re-designated as a road for motor vehicles. In its Twitter message, ŘSD mistakenly informed about the transfer of the section to a Class I road, but later corrected the message that it was a transfer to a local Class I road, the spokeswoman of TSK hl. However, the Prague TSK spokesperson Barbora Lišková reportedly continued to mystify that it was a Class I road.\nFinal stretches\nThe only section which is not yet completed is the Říkovice – Přerov segment. Construction on this segment started in 2022, with an expected completion date in 2025.\nFurthermore, in April 2025, the widening works (to three lanes in each direction) on the  long section in Brno should conclude.\nRoute description\n|notes=Kilometrage starting point\n----\nConnects with Prague's Inner Ring Road (MO).\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Start of toll section (toll coupon, electronic toll already in force)\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=End of the toll section (toll coupon only, electronic toll continues to apply)\n}}\n|notes=Started construction 12/2022.
