The crescent and star came into use in the second half of the 18th century. A  (decree) from 1793 required that the ships of the Ottoman Navy were to use a red flag with the star and crescent in white. In 1844, a version of this flag, with a five-pointed star, was officially adopted as the Ottoman national flag. The decision to adopt a national flag was part of the Tanzimat reforms which aimed to modernize the Ottoman state in line with the laws and norms of contemporary European states and institutions.\nThe star and crescent design later became a common element in the national flags of Ottoman successor states in the 20th century.\nThe current flag of Turkey is essentially the same as the late Ottoman flag, but has more specific legal standardizations (regarding its measures, geometric proportions, and exact tone of red) that were introduced with the Turkish Flag Law on 29 May 1936. Before the legal standardization, the star and crescent could have slightly varying slimness or positioning depending on the rendition.\nEarly flag\nPre-modern Ottoman armies used the horse-tail standard or tugh rather than flags.\nSuch standards remained in use alongside flags until the 19th century. A depiction of a tugh appears in the ' by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1718).\nWar flags came into use by the 16th century. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Ottoman war flags often depicted the bifurcated Zulfiqar sword, often misinterpreted in Western literature as showing a pair of scissors.\nThe crescent symbol appears in flags attributed to Tunis from as early as the 14th century ('), long before Tunis fell under Ottoman rule in 1574. But the crescent as a symbol also had 14th-century associations with the Ottoman military\nand millennium-long associations with the city of Istanbul,\nwhich became the Ottoman capital after  its conquest in 1453. The Spanish Navy Museum in Madrid shows two Ottoman naval flags dated 1613; both are swallow-tailed, one green with a white crescent near the hoist, the other white with two red stripes near the edges of the flag and a red crescent near the hoist.\nFile:Szigetvár before the siege.jpg|Various Ottoman flags and tughs displayed before the Siege of Szigetvár in 1566\nFile:Bremen, Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek, ms.

The white star and crescent moon with a red background was introduced as the flag of the Ottoman Empire in 1844.\nFile:Ottoman flag c.1490-1701.png|Official state flag used by the Ottoman Empire between c.1453 and 1701.\nFile:1783 Ottoman Flag.svg|\"Turks Standard\", in Bowles's Universal Display of the Naval Flags of all Nations (1783).

Prepared 29 years after the Battle of Mohács, this painting shows the Turkish Army using the Crescent-Star flag\nSource of the Star and Crescent symbol\nIt has been suggested that the star-and-crescent used in Ottoman flags of the 19th century had been adopted from the Byzantine. Franz Babinger (1992) suggests this possibility, noting that the crescent alone has a much older tradition also with Turkic tribes in the interior of Asia. The crescent and star is found on the coinage of Byzantium since the 4th century BC and was depicted on Byzantine Empire's coins and shields of Christian warrior saints till the 13th century. Parsons (2007) notes that the star and crescent was not a widespread motive on the coinage of Byzantium at the time of the Ottoman conquest. Turkish historians tend to stress the antiquity of the crescent (not star-and-crescent) symbol among the early Turkic states in Asia.\nImperial standards\nfeatured a green flag at left (representing the Rumelia Eyalet) and red flag at right (representing the Anatolia Eyalet and the other Asian eyalets).]]\nThe imperial standard displayed the sultan's tughra, often on a pink or bright red background.\nFile:Imperial standard of the Ottoman Sultan.svg|Imperial Standard of the Ottoman Sultan\nFile:Naval standard of the Ottoman Sultan.svg|Naval Standard of the Ottoman Sultan\nFile:Soldiers 1900.png|Standards used by the Ottoman Army in 1900\nThe standard used by the last Caliph, Abdulmejid II (between 19 November 1922 – 3 March 1924) consisted of a green flag with a star and crescent in white on a red oval background within a rayed ornament, all in white.\nFile:Caliphate standard of Abdulmejid II (1922–1924).svg|Caliphate Standard of Abdulmejid II\nArmy Flags and Standards with Shahada\nThe Ottoman army often used verses from the Quran and Shahada on their flags. This tradition continued during the First World War. When Ottoman Turkey joined the war on the side of the Central Powers in 1914, it declared a  jihad against the Entente States. The modern Ottoman Turkish army used the Ottoman state coat of arms on one side of their standard regimental flags and Shahada on the other. The Ottoman regimental flags consisted of gold writings and the state emblem on a red background. After the empire was abolished in 1922, this practice continued for a while in modern Turkey.\nFile:HGM Türkische Standarte 1683.jpg|Standard of the Ottoman Army at Battle of Vienna (1683)\nFile:Οθωμανικό λάβαρο το οποίο απέσπασαν οι Βενετοί ως τρόπαιο όταν εκ - Peeters Jacob - 1690.jpg|Ottoman Flag at Morea (1690)\nFile:Hellenic War Museum Banners (27977335343).jpg|Ottoman Regimental Standards with Ottoman National Flag\nFile:Ottoman Regiment Flag.svg|One Side of Ottoman Turkish Regimental Standard with Shahada which was used in World War I (1914)\nFile:Ottoman regimental flag at Kanlisirt.jpg|Ottoman Turkish Regimental Standard with Shahada in Gallipoli campaign (1915)\nSee also\n* Coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire\n* Flag of Turkey\n* List of Turkish flags\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\nko:오스만 제국의 국기"
