This last valley is much larger than can be expected from such a small flow, still representing the original Warche valley. In that time the Warche confluenced with the Amblève at Stavelot. Later on, probably during the last ice age the Warche adopted its current position, flowing through the Malmedy graben.\nReferences\n* [http://www.eastbelgium.com/pressecenter/presse_fr/2005/05/warchetal.html eastbelgium.com: « sentier de découverte » dans la vallée de la Warche] (in French)"
