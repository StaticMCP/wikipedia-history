For example, whereas the town, state construction for all addresses in Manhattan is New York, New York (except in Marble Hill, where Bronx, New York is used), and all neighborhoods in Brooklyn use Brooklyn, New York, residents of College Point would use the construction College Point, New York or Flushing, New York instead of Queens, New York.\nFrom the time of the inception of the ZIP Code system until 1998, the postal zones of Queens and western Nassau County—whose secession from Queens County in 1899 did not affect postal routes—were organized based on which main post office routed the neighborhood's postal mail. The name of the main post office was the default name of the corresponding ZIP Code. For example, Fresh Meadows postal mail was routed through the main post office in Flushing, and Fresh Meadows' ZIP Codes 11365 and 11366 were both labeled as \"Flushing\".\nAt the urging of the citizens of Queens and with the support of Congressman Gary Ackerman, ZIP Codes are also named after the main post office they serve. The original ZIP Codes themselves are still used by the USPS for mail delivery purposes. Queens neighborhoods may have one of the following ZIP Code prefixes, which are classified under the following main post offices:\n* 111: Long Island City\n* 113: Flushing\n* 114: Jamaica\n* 116: Rockaway\nSee also\n* List of Bronx neighborhoods\n* List of Brooklyn neighborhoods\n* List of Manhattan neighborhoods\n* List of Staten Island neighborhoods\n* Community boards of Queens\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/about/developments/queens.page Queens - NYCHA]\n* [http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/city-neighborhoods.page 'NYC Neighborhoods Map' from New York City's Department of City Planning (DCP)]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/flimflimflam/3170588053/lightbox/ Map of Queens neighborhoods]"
