He is generally regarded as being the person responsible for shooting and killing the Aboriginal warrior Pemulwuy in 1802.\nBiography\nHacking was the quartermaster of , the flagship of the First Fleet that established the first British colony in New South Wales, Australia in 1788.\nHe was well regarded as an enforcer by the authorities at the outpost of Sydney and was employed in shooting expeditions to gather food and game for the colony. In September 1789, near Middle Harbour, a group of Cammeraygal men threw a stone at Hacking, who responded by shooting at them, resulting in two being killed or seriously wounded.\nHacking probably returned to England after the loss of the Sirius in 1790, as he returned to Sydney in the Royal Admiral in 1792.\nIn March 1799, Henry Hacking was ordered by Governor John Hunter to investigate claims of British sailors being trapped by Aboriginal Australians at the mouth of the Hunter River to the north of the colony. Hacking encountered a group of Awabakal people on the south side of the river, who informed him that the sailors had left earlier on foot, endeavouring to walk back to Sydney. Hacking did not believe them, and became agitated, shooting dead three Awabakal men. The sailors in question later arrived in Sydney, having walked the distance to return.\nHacking led many hunting expeditions to supplement meat rations for Australia's first settlers. He was among the party that found the lost government cattle at Cowpastures in 1795. He was sentenced to be transported to Norfolk Island in October 1799 for perjury but received a pardon.\nIn 1800 and 1801, he piloted the  into and out of Port Jackson. In 1802, he was appointed first mate of the . In 1802, Hacking shot and killed Pemulwuy, a Bediagal resistance fighter who had killed and harassed settlers and who had been a wanted man since 1790, after Governor Philip Gidley King issued an order on 22 November 1801 to bring Pemulwuy in dead or alive, with an associated reward.\nIn 1802, Hacking also shot and wounded Ann Holmes, his former mistress, for which crime he was sentenced to death but pardoned in 1803. Also in 1803, he was found guilty of stealing naval stores from  and again sentenced to death, then reprieved on condition that he was transported to Van Diemen's Land.\nIn 1804, Hacking was appointed coxswain to the lieutenant-governor at Hobart. In July 1806, he was appointed pilot at Hobart at £50 a year. He died at Hobart on 21 July 1831.\nLegacy\nPort Hacking, south of Botany Bay, known as Deeban by traditional owners, was named in his honour by Matthew Flinders in 1796.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
