This was partially achieved by the marriage of Victoria's progeny with Christian's (and vice versa). By the time of her Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Victoria was known as the \"Grandmother of Europe\". Christian IX was nicknamed the \"Father-in-law of Europe\".\nVictoria and Christian's grandchildren were the monarchs of Denmark, Germany/Prussia, Greece, Norway, Russia and the United Kingdom. Today, the descendants of Victoria and Christian are monarchs of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\nGrandchildren\nGeorge's mother, Princess Alexandra of Denmark, was a daughter of Christian IX. Additionally, Queen Victoria was the mother of King Edward VII, George's father.}}]]\nVictoria arranged the marriage of her eldest son and heir, the future King Edward VII, to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the daughter of Christian IX, which took place on 10 March 1863.

Between 1881 and 1894, Maria's husband ruled as Russia's sovereign. Her son, Nicholas II, became Emperor of Russia upon Alexander III's death. Nicholas married Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, on 26 November 1894, and Alix became his consort, adopting the name Alexandra Feodorovna.\nOther grandchildren of either or both of Victoria and Christian were sovereigns suo jure or consorts of sovereigns, including:\n* King Christian X of Denmark, the elder brother of Haakon VII of Norway\n* Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia, the elder brother of Sophia of Prussia\n* Princess Marie of Edinburgh, the eldest daughter of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha,}} who married King Ferdinand I of Romania\n* Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, a daughter of Queen Victoria's youngest daughter Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom, who married King Alfonso XIII of Spain\n}}\nChristian IX\n|VI=Queen Victoria\n}}\nFrederick VIII of Denmark\n|AD=Alexandra of Denmark\n|EVII=Edward VII of the United Kingdom\n|GI=George I of Greece\n|VII=Victoria, Princess Royal\n|AL=Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n|MF=Dagmar of Denmark\n|AI=Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse\n|BEA=Beatrice of the United Kingdom\n}}\nChristian X of Denmark\n|HVII=Haakon VII of Norway\n|MW=Maud of Wales\n|GV=George V of the United Kingdom\n|AND=Andrew of Greece and Denmark\n|CI=Constantine I of Greece\n|SP=Sophia of Prussia\n|WII=Wilhelm II of Germany\n|NII=Nicholas II of Russia\n|AD2=Alix of Hesse\n|ME=Marie of Edinburgh\n}}\nFrederik IX of Denmark\n|Olav=Olav V of Norway\n|Ed8=Edward VIII of the United Kingdom\n|Ge6=George VI of the United Kingdom\n|Ge2=George II of Greece\n|Alex=Alexander of Greece\n|Paul=Paul of Greece\n|Helen=Helen of Greece and Denmark\n|CAR=Carol II of Romania\n}}\nMargrethe II of Denmark\n|Herald=Harald V of Norway\n|Liz=Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom\n|Phil=Philip, Duke of Edinburgh\n|Const=Constantine II of Greece\n|Sof=Sofia\n|Michael=Michael I of Romania\n}}\nFrederik X of Denmark\n|CIII=Charles III of the United Kingdom\n|Fel=Felipe VI of Spain\n}}\nWorld War I\nAt the start of World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, six major powers of Europe were divided between two coalitions. On one hand, France, Russia and the United Kingdom formed the Triple Entente. On the other hand, Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy formed the Triple Alliance.
