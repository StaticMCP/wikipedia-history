Over 30 million registered users and 500,000 organizations are using Postman. Postman also maintains the Postman API Network, a directory of over 100,000 public APIs that is listed as the world’s largest such collection. The company is headquartered in San Francisco and maintains additional offices in Tokyo and Bengaluru, where Postman was founded.\nIn August 2021, Postman raised a $225 million Series D round at a $5.6 billion valuation making it a unicorn company.\nHistory\nPostman started in 2012 in Bangalore as a side project of software engineer Abhinav Asthana, who wanted to simplify API testing while working at Yahoo Bangalore. He named his app Postman – a play on the API request “POST” – and offered it free in the Chrome Web Store. As the app's usage grew to 500,000 users with no marketing, Abhinav recruited former colleagues Ankit Sobti and Abhijit Kane to help create Postman, Inc. The three co-founders lead the company today, with Abhinav serving as CEO and Ankit as CTO.\nIn 2017, Postman moved its corporate headquarters from Bangalore to San Francisco.\nIn 2023, Postman announced it had acquired Akita, an API observability solution. In 2024, Postman acquired Orbit, a solution for building and managing developer communities.\nFeatures\nPostman features include:\n* Workspaces: Personal, team, partner, and public workspaces allow for API collaboration internally and externally\n* API repository: Allows users to store, catalog, and collaborate around API artifacts in a central platform within public, private, or partner networks\n* API builder: Helps implement an API design workflow through specifications including OpenAPI, GraphQL, and RAML.
