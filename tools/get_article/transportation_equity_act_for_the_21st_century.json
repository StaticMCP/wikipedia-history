TEA-21 authorized federal surface transportation programs for highways, highway safety, and transit for a 6-year period from 1998 to 2003. Because Congress could not agree on funding levels, the Act, which had continued past 2003 by means of temporary extensions, was allowed to lapse.\nHistory\nThe bill was introduced in the House by Bud Shuster (R–PA) on September 4, 1997.\nThe transportation equity act requires that seven planning factors be included in regional transportation plans. The plans must:\n# support the economic vitality of the metropolitan planning area, especially by enabling global competitiveness, productivity and efficiency;\n# increase the safety and security of the transportation system for motorized and non-motorized users ;\n# increase the accessibility and mobility options available to people and for freight;\n# protect and enhance the environment, especially by promoting energy conservation and improving quality of life;\n# enhance the integration and connectivity of the transportation system across and between modes, for people and freight;\n# promote efficient system management and operation; and\n# emphasize the efficient preservation of existing transportation systems.\nFactor 4 was amended by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA-LU) in 2005 and reads: \"protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation, improve the quality of life, and promote consistency between transportation improvements and State and local planned growth and economic development patterns\".\nSection 1211(d) prevents the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) from requiring state departments of transportation to use the metric system. This has delayed metrication in the United States with respect to road construction, though some states had already completely converted.\nFunding programs\n*JARC (Job Access Reverse Commute)\nSee also\n*Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act\n*Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA, 1991)\n*Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21, 2012)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/tea21/index.htm TEA-21 official web site]\n* [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1431/uslm/COMPS-1431.xml Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century] as amended ([https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1431/pdf/COMPS-1431.pdf PDF]/[https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/COMPS-1431 details]) in the GPO [https://www.govinfo.gov/help/comps Statute Compilations collection]\n* [https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/105/public/178?link-type=pdf&.pdf Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century] as enacted ([https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/105/public/178?link-type=details details]) in the US Statutes at Large\n*  on Congress.gov\n*  on Congress.gov"
