The legislation was enacted into law  by the 31st President of the United States Herbert Hoover on February 26, 1931.\nProvisions of the Act\nThe public property acquisition act was penned as five sections facilitating the transfer of private property appropriated for public use purposes in the continental United States.\n{| style=\"width: 60%; ; border: none; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n|Declaration of Taking\n|-\n|46 Stat. 1421-1422 § I\n|-\n| * Acquisition of public building sites for public use\n|-\n| * Declaration of Taking to be filed\n|-\n| * Statements annexed regarding Declaration of Taking\n|-\n| * Title to vest in United States upon deposit of just compensation\n|-\n| * Compensation to be ascertained\n|-\n| * Interest\n|-\n| * No commission charges\n|-\n| * Payment upon application of parties in interest\n|-\n| * If compensation award exceeds payment made judgment entered for deficit\n|-\n| * Power of court to fix time for surrender of possession\n|-\n| * Orders respecting encumbrances\n|-\n|Vesting Not Prevented or Delayed\n|-\n|46 Stat. 1422 § II\n|-\n| * Vesting of title not delayed by appeal\n|-\n|Irrevocable Commitment of Federal Government\n|-\n|46 Stat. 1422 § III\n|-\n| * Payment of ultimate award\n|-\n|Right of Taking as Addition to Existing Rights\n|-\n|46 Stat. 1422 § IV\n|-\n| * Prior rights not abrogated\n|-\n|Authorized Purposes of Expenditures After Irrevocable Commitment\n|-\n|46 Stat. 1422 § V\n|-\n| * Expenditures when United States committed to pay awards\n|-\n| * Validity of title\n|}\nSee also\n* Bankhead–Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937\n* Federal lands\n* Condemnation Act of 1888\n* Frazier–Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act of 1934\n* Eminent domain in the United States\n* Ketch Ranch House (Oklahoma)\n* Farm Security Administration\n* Protected areas of the United States\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*}}\n*}}\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
