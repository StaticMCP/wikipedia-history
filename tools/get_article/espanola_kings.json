They played in the Greater Metro Junior 'A' Hockey League.\nHistory\nOn February 18, 2007, Bob Russell announced the expansion of the Espanola Kings for the 2007-08 season [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929132033/http://tcmoosehockey.com/GMHLFORUM/index.php?topic=609.0]. The announcement corresponded with two games that took place in Espanola between the King Wild and the Richmond Hill Rams franchises. The Kings are owned by the same ownership group as the Rams and were named after the 1970s Oak Ridges Kings of the Metro Junior B Hockey League.\nThe expansion of the Kings makes them the eighth team in the independent GMJHL and one of six 2007 expansion teams.\nOn September 7, 2007, the Espanola Kings played their first ever game in Elliot Lake against the Elliot Lake Bobcats.  The Bobcats defeated the Kings 3-2. On September 14, the Kings played their first ever home game, against the South Muskoka Shield. This resulted in a 6-4 victory — the Kings' first ever win.\nAfter the 2009 GMHL Spring General Managers' meeting, it was announced that the Kings would not take part in the 2009-10 season. The Kings did not return, and nor did their sister franchise, Richmond Hill Rams.\nSeason-by-season standings\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"  bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n|Season\t||GP || W || L || T || OTL || GF ||\tGA || P || Results\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2007-08\t||42    ||15   ||26   ||-   ||1    ||151   ||226    ||31   ||9th GMJHL\n|- align=\"center\"\n|2008-09\t||43    ||8    ||34   ||-   ||1    ||110   ||334    ||17\t||13th GMJHL\n|- align=\"center\"  bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n|2 Seasons ||85 ||23 ||60 ||- ||2 ||261 ||560 ||-- ||0.282\n|}\nPlayoffs\n*2008 Lost bye round\n:Temiscaming Royals defeated Espanola Kings 4-games-to-none in bye round\n*2009 Did not qualify\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626024110/http://www.espanolakings.com/ Espanola Kings Webpage]"
