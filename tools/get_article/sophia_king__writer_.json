Her sister Charlotte, later Charlotte Dacre (1771–1825), also became a writer. Their brother was Charles. King's year of birth is uncertain and she may have been closer in age to her sister than is generally believed. Their childhood was tumultuous as their father was involved in a series of highly publicized lawsuits and financial difficulties.\nKing married Charles Fortnum (1770–1860) in 1801 and had three children. Charles Fortnum was himself imprisoned and declared bankrupt, in 1804 in France. The years of both King's birth and death are uncertain.\nWriting\nKing's first publication was a collection of poetry, Trifles of Helicon (1798), co-authored with her sister Charlotte. In the dedication, they thanked their beleaguered father for the education he gave them, writing that they trusted that their verses demonstrated that \"the education you have afforded us has not been totally lost.\" They worked collaboratively at least once more, when Charlotte contributed the poetry for King's twelfth-century romance The Fatal Secret; or, Unknown Warrior (1801).\nKing also contributed poetry to periodicals using the nom de plume \"Sappho,\" and published a solo collection, which contained many of these individual poems, entitled Poems, Legendary, Pathetic, and Descriptive, in 1804.\nThe bulk of her literary output consists of her five multi-volume novels.\nCritical assessments\nHer first, co-authored collection of poetry received \"mediocre\" reviews, though the circumstances — and the dedication to their disgraced father — were perhaps a factor. Both King, and her sister to an even greater extent, inspired a degree of controversy all on their own, however. A reviewer for the Critical Review'' commented on King's \"luxuriant imagination,\" which was not necessarily a compliment with its implication of being untamed.\nTwentieth-century commentators have often been dismissive, but in more recent years, literary critics are reevaluating Gothic texts as a separate category rather than as failed realist texts. According to the Orlando Project, \"Sophia King, like her sister Charlotte Dacre, seems to use the sensational in both her poetry and fiction ... to figure her actual, excruciating family romance. Male libertinism, both sexual and philosophical-radical, is rendered fatally attractive and destructive.\" King herself would seem to have been considering the possibilities available to genre writers when, in the \"Remarks\" which preface her poetry collection of 1804, she discusses the relationship of fantasy to good taste.\nWorks\nFiction\n*Waldorf; or, the Dangers of Philosophy.
