The river descends  over its  course.\nFirst surveyed by European explorers during the 1820s, the river was named in honour of William Ward, a founding director of Australian Agricultural Company.\nSee also\n* Rivers of New South Wales\n* List of rivers of New South Wales (L–Z)\n* List of rivers of Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
