It is part of the municipality of Krummhörn. The village is located between Hamswehrum and Campen.\nUpleward is built on a warft which has been inhabited since at least the Early Middle Ages. The village center consists of traditional single-family houses, built around the Gothic church from the 14th century. The church's narrow pointed arches are typical of the time.\nIn 2004, an iron dagger inscribed with the words \"ANNA\" and \"HANA\" was discovered in Upleward, dating back to 1450.\nGallery\nKirche Upleward (Krummhörn) IMG 6674.jpg||alt=Church of Upleward\nGefallenendenkmal Upleward (Krummhörn) IMG 6679.jpg| ('Memorial for the Fallen')\nDeich in Upleward (Krummhörn) IMG 6414.jpg|Dyke near Upleward\nNotable people\n* Johannes Bogerman (1576–1637), Dutch theologician\nReferences\nExternal links"
