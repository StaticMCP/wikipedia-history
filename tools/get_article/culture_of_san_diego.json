San Diego's longtime association with the U.S. military also contributes to its culture. Present-day culture includes many historical and tourist attractions, a thriving musical and theatrical scene, numerous notable special events, a varied cuisine, and a reputation as one of America's premier centers of craft brewing.\nLittle Italy.]]\nTourism\nSan Diego houses many tourist attractions, such as the San Diego Zoo, Balboa Park, USS Midway Museum, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, SeaWorld, Belmont Park, and nearby Legoland. Spanish influence on the city can be seen in the many historic sites across San Diego, such as Mission San Diego de Alcalá, Old Town San Diego State Historic Park, and Cabrillo National Monument. Cuisine in San Diego is diverse, but there is an abundance of wood fired California-style pizzas and Mexican and East Asian cuisine. Annual events in San Diego include the San Diego County Fair, San Diego Comic-Con, and the Farmers Insurance Open.\nMilitary\nSan Diego has been a military town for more than 100 years. Present-day reflections of that tradition include tributes to military history such as the USS Midway Museum and Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery, as well as numerous smaller memorials throughout the city. Annual events celebrating the military include Fleet Week and the Miramar Air Show.\nCuisine\nFood\nBecause of its ethnic and cultural mix, San Diego has a wide range of cuisines. One can find Mexican, Italian, French, Spanish, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Greek, Latin, German, Indian, Central and East Asian, Middle Eastern and Pacific Islander food throughout the city.

The first of the new wave of local breweries and brewpubs was the Karl Strauss Brewing Company which opened in 1989.
