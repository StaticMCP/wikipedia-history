The chairman of the Indiana Republican State Committee is Lana Keesling.\nIt is currently the dominant party in the state, controlling all statewide executive offices, both of the state's U.S. Senate seats, seven of its nine U.S. House seats, and supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature.\nHistory\nRepublicans have dominated Indiana politics for most of its history, although Democrats did occasionally do very well in some parts of the state government from the 1960s to the early 2000s. At the presidential level, the state is also reliably Republican; the state has voted Democratic only five times since 1892, all of which occurred amidst national Democratic landslides. In fact, no Republican has won the presidency without carrying Indiana since 1876, when Democrat Samuel Tilden very narrowly carried the state amidst an extremely close (and still disputed) national election.\nIn the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln won all of Indiana's 13 electoral votes with 51.09% of the popular vote. When the American Civil War broke out, Indiana had a strong, pro-South Democratic Party in the Indiana General Assembly that, for the most part, claimed to be pro-Union but anti-abolition. Governor Oliver P. Morton (elected 1861), had a close relationship with Lincoln, who called him the \"shrewdest person I know\". At the 1862 Loyal War Governors Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Morton put his full support behind Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n]]\nA backlash followed the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, leading to a defeat of Republicans in the 1862 midterm elections. Morton feared that the Democratic majority in the General Assembly would be sympathetic to the Confederacy, so he began to take steps to circumvent the General Assembly and mobilize Indiana in the war effort. When Morton stepped beyond the scope of his constitutional powers by establishing a state arsenal, the Democratic legislature moved to switch command of the militia from the Governor to the General Assembly. Fearing that with control of the militia, the Democrats would attempt to secede from the Union, Morton helped Republican legislators to flee to Kentucky and prevent a quorum. Unable to pass appropriations bills, the paralyzed government of Indiana teetered on bankruptcy until Morton once again stepped out of the scope of his powers and acquired millions of dollars in federal and private loans to keep the government running, support Indiana's role in the war effort, and circumvent the Democratic Assembly.\nFor the remainder of the Civil War, Morton made efforts to keep Indiana secure by suppressing elements he saw as anti-union or sympathetic to the South. The searches, arrests, and even disruption of the Democratic State Convention in what would later be called the Battle of Pogue's Run earned Morton much criticism and he was called a \"dictator\" and \"underhanded mobster\". As the war ended and the Republican Party received an overwhelming majority in the government, Morton's questionable conduct during the war was moot and he continued to serve a second term in the US Senate until 1877.\nThe party's darkest stain was after World War I, following a rush of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe into the United States. By this period of time, the Indiana Republican Party, like the Republican Party elsewhere, had given up its former goal of African-American rights. Unlike the first Ku Klux Klan that rose in the South during the Reconstruction era to terrorize both white and black Republicans, the new Klan that started in Georgia in 1915 was a highly nativist organization. Staunchly anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, antisemitic, and prejudiced against African Americans, the new Klan spread into Indiana in the 1920s under Grand Dragon D.C. Stephenson. The second KKK was almost exclusively Republican in Midwestern states such as Indiana as well as in northern and western states such as Maine and Colorado, although the KKK remained exclusively Democratic in the South. Under Stephenson's leadership, the Klan flourished in Indiana and took over both the governor's office and much of the Republican Party in the General Assembly. With over 250,000 white males (approximately forty-percent of Indiana's population) paying Klan dues in Indiana, Stephenson amassed a fortune estimated from two to five million dollars. In 1922. the Klan-dominated General Assembly passed a Klan Day in the Indiana State Fair, but Republican Governor Warren T. McCray vetoed the bill, earning the ire of Stephenson and the Klan.\n(1889–1893)]]\nIn the 1924 Republican primary elections in Indiana, almost all candidates nominated for statewide office were Klansmen. One African-American newspaper said, \"the Ku Klux Klan has captured boot and breeches, the Republican party in Indiana and have [sic] turned what has been historically an organization of constitutional freedom into an agency for the promotion of religious and racial hate. Nobody now denies the Ku Klux Klan is the dominating power in Indiana Republican politics. In fact, the Republican party exists in Indiana today only in name. Its place has been usurped by the Klan purposes and leadership and issues.\" Most Indiana blacks in 1924 cast their first-ever ballot for the Democratic Party, which had passed a resolution denouncing the KKK in its platform, though without mentioning the Klan by name. Blacks in other areas of the United States, in contrast, generally remained Republican until the 1930s. Despite the influx of blacks into the Democratic party, Klansmen won most of the Indiana legislature and most statewide offices in the November 1924 general elections. However, once in office, the Klan-controlled legislature passed little to no anti-black, anti-Jewish, or anti-Catholic legislation.\nThe peak of the Klan's power and influence was in the early 1920s, when the Klan had Governor McCray arrested, imprisoned, and thrown out of office on a charge of mail fraud. Republican Edward Jackson, a KKK member was elected in the 1924 election. Stephenson became infamous for his words \"I am the law in Indiana.\"\nThe Klan quickly fell apart under the revelation that Stephenson had abducted, raped, and murdered a young woman. More of a populist organization that believed in the Klan's image of defending the race and \"Protestant Womanhood,\" the Klan's power and influence in both Indiana and its politics dissolved quickly. Governor Jackson refused to pardon his old ally Stephenson, so Stephenson retaliated from prison by revealing evidence that Jackson had received bribes from the Klan. Despite calls for his resignation for being associated with the Klan, Jackson's trial resulted in a hung jury.\nFrom 1972 to 1988 the Republican Party candidate for president won over 50% of Indiana’s popular vote, breaking only in 1992 when independent candidate Ross Perot siphoned votes away from both Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican George H.W. Bush, and again in 1996 against Clinton and Bob Dole. Perot won 19.77% of the vote in 1992 and 10.56% in 1996. Clinton lost Indiana in 1996 by only six percentage points. George W. Bush swung Indiana more firmly to the Republican side once again during his successful campaign in 2000, defeating Democrat Al Gore by over 15 points in the state. Bush increased his margin of victory even more in 2004, defeating Democrat John Kerry by 20 percentage points, 5 points better than his first presidential run. Bush consolidated and accrued large margins in the state's abundant rural counties, sometimes winning 70-80% of the vote in those areas. Democrats were competitive only in Lake, Monroe, LaPorte, and Marion (home to Indianapolis) counties during the Bush years.\nIn 2008, Democratic nominee Barack Obama surprisingly won the state by a 1.03% margin over Republican John McCain, the first time a Democrat won the state since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Obama made several large inroads in the state's rural counties. McCain still won most of these counties, but the fact that Obama made inroads contributed to his overall victory . Also many counties in Indiana’s blue collar northwest swung away from McCain. This election was considered an upset due to the state’s traditional Republican lean. The state was back to voting Republican in the 2012 presidential election, breaking for Mit Romney by more than ten points.\nDonald Trump and his running mate, Indiana native Mike Pence, won the state over Democrat Hillary Clinton by a 20-point margin of victory, improving on Romney’s margin mainly due to third-party candidates in the 2016 election and the fact that Pence was on the ticket. In his unsuccessful 2020 reelection campaign, Trump won the state, albeit by three points less than in 2016, over Democrat Joe Biden.\nIn 2024, Trump won Indiana for a third time in a row over Democrat Kamala Harris, winning by a margin of 19 points, an increase over his 2020 margins but just under his 2016 margins.\nIndiana has had a Republican governor since 2005.\nPlatform\nThe 2012 party platform contains the party's official stances on key issues, economic, political and social.\nThe first section of the platform states that the liberties guaranteed to us in the Constitution and Bill of Rights must be protected from erosion by government. The platform then states a commitment to \"protecting and defending our U.S. and Indiana Constitutions,\" \"fiscal responsibility,\" \"federalism,\" \"strong family structures,\" \"individual responsibility,\" \"personal liberty and freedom,\" \"free and fair elections\" and \"volunteerism.\"\nThe Indiana GOP concurs with the current Indiana law that \"childbirth is preferred, encouraged, and supported over abortion.\"\nThe party also believes that \"strong families are the foundation of virtue and that such families bring forth citizens capable of self-government as well as properly motivated public servants so essential for a successful republic.\"\nIt stands by the national Republican Party that \"limited government truly is good government\" and states that the proper role of government is to get out of the way of entrepreneurs and job creators.\nThe party also supports paying down debt, balancing budgets, and lowering taxes coupled with a simplified tax code.\nThe Indiana Republican Party supports the use of Hoosier resources, including expanded clean coal technology, as a way to reduce dependence on foreign oil.\nThe platform states the belief of Indiana Republicans that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced with free market solutions.\nOne amendment was approved and added at the 2012 State Convention; \"The Indiana Republican Party shall seek transparency, accountability and fairness in all levels of government, including a comprehensive audit of the Federal Reserve.\"\nCurrent Indiana Republican officeholders\nThe Indiana Republican Party controls both U.S. Senate seats and seven of nine U.S. House seats. Republicans control all seven of the seven statewide constitutional offices. The party currently hold a majority in both the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate.\nFederal officials\nU.S. Senate\nFile:Senator Todd Young official portrait.jpg|Senior U.S. Senator\nFile:Sen.
