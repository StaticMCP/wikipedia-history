He is described to be the eldest son of King Yayati, and his queen, Devayani. He married five daughters of Nāga king.\nLegend\nAccording to a narrative found in the Mahabharata, and the Vishnu Purana, Yadu refused to exchange his years of youth with his father, Yayati, when the latter was cursed with senility by his father-in-law, Shukra. Thus, he was cursed by Yayati to have his progeny disinherited of the dominion. Due to this proclamation, Yadu was replaced by his half-brother, Puru, as the heir to the throne of the Chandravamsha dynasty. Yadu founded his own cadet branch of the dynasty, called the Yaduvamsha.\nDescendants\nThe Agni Purana states that Yadu's lineage was continued by his eldest son, Sahasrajit. Sahasrajit had three sons: Haihaya, Renuhaya, and Haya.\nA historical dynasty called the Traikutaka claimed descent from Haihaya.\nAccording to Historian T Padmaja, the Abhiras migrated to Tamil Nadu and established their kingdoms and some of the inscriptions there mentions their descendant from the Yadu lineage.\nSee also\n* Raghu\n* Ikshvaku\n* Bharata\n* Krishna\n* Rama\nReferences"
