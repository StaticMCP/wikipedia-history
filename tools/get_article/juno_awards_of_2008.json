These ceremonies honoured music industry achievements in Canada in the latter part of 2006 and in most of 2007.\nCountry performer and multiple Juno Award winner Paul Brandt received the 2008 Humanitarian Award which is now named after CHUM-FM Radio founder, Allan Waters. Moses Znaimer, who led the development of Citytv and MuchMusic, received the Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award. Nominations for all remaining categories were announced on 5 February 2008.\nNotable among winners was Feist, winning all five awards in her nominated categories, three of which were presented in the televised gala.\nPresentations\nSaturday gala\nThe Saturday gala where most awards are presented occurred at the Telus Convention Centre on 5 April, while the major awards were presented at the Pengrowth Saddledome on Sunday (6 April).\nSunday televised ceremonies\nPerformers appearing on the program included Feist, Finger Eleven, Michael Bublé, Avril Lavigne, Anne Murray, Paul Brandt, Aaron Lines, Gord Bamford, Hedley, Johnny Reid, and Jully Black.\nThe televised event was broadcast on CTV and hosted by Russell Peters. Peters' monologue was described by Edmonton Sun columnist Bill Harris as \"the funniest opening five minutes we've ever seen from an awards-show host.\" Peters was also cited by Toronto Star entertainment critic Ben Rayner as offering a break from recent years of \"iffy emceeing\" during the award broadcasts.\nThe 2008 broadcast attracted CTV's second-highest ratings since the network gained broadcast rights. 1.45 million viewers were measured in 2008 compared to 2.18 million for the 2003 ceremonies.\nJeff Healey, an internationally noted Canadian musician who died the month before the Juno ceremonies, was given a brief tribute mention by members of Blue Rodeo during the televised awards ceremony.\n----\n----\nNominees and winners\nNominees for the 2008 Juno Awards were announced on 5 February 2008.
