It began with the defeat of the pipiolos (Liberals) by the pelucones at the Battle of Lircay ending the Chilean Civil War of 1829–30 and concluded in 1861 with the election of the independent Jose Joaquin Perez as president, ending the hegemony of the conservative party.\nSee also\n*Diego Portales\n*War of the Confederation\nReferences"
