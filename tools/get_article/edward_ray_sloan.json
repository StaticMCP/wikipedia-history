He was admitted to the bar with fifty other students in June 1905, only one of which was a woman.\nHe was married to Miss Julia L. Write at her home in Norton, Kansas January 24, 1906.\nHe was a Methodist and on occasion spoke to church groups on subject such as \"Christianity and Law\" and \"The Trail of Christ\".\nCareer\nHe was elected as the Sheridan County attorney at the end of 1904 before passing the Bar, and then re-elected for a further two terms, all the time running his own private practice in Hoxie, Kansas.\nHe set up a new law firm July 1911 with Guy L. Hursh called the Holton law firm of Hursh & Sloan.\nSloan was appointed the Holton city attorney in April 1912 and held the position for 19 years.

Thiele that did run for the next term and won the position on the court, reverting to Republican from Democrat.\nHe was later appointed to the Kansas Corporation Commission and was the chairman from 1936 until 1938.\nSometime later in 1947 he was appointed as the Referee in Bankruptcy for the District of Kansas, a position he help for 14 years.\nHe was also the first vice-president of the National Association of Referees in Bankruptcy.\nHe lectured at the Washburn University School of Law, and then compiled a textbook on bankruptcy in 1952 called Lectures on the Law of Bankruptcy.\nHe received and honorary doctorate of law from the Washburn University School of Law in 1954.\nDeath\nHe died at home in Topeka, Kansas January 30, 1964 in his sleep.\nReferences"
