Democratic nominee former Lieutenant Governor, John Carney defeated Republican nominee Glen Urquhart, giving Delaware an all Democratic congressional delegation for the first time since before the 1942 midterms. This is the first open-seat election since 1992 and only the second since 1976.\nBackground\nThe state of Delaware is completely contained in a single at-large district. The district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+7. Since 1993, the district had been represented by Republican Michael Castle.\nCastle announced in 2009 he would run for the United States Senate seat held by Ted Kaufman (D) who had been appointed to the seat when his predecessor, Joe Biden (D), resigned to become Vice President. Castle was defeated by Christine O'Donnell in the Delaware Republican Senate primary.\nDemocratic primary\nCandidates\n*John Carney, former Lieutenant Governor of Delaware\nResults\nCarney announced his candidacy on April 15, 2009, and was unopposed in the primary after Scott Spencer, a transportation consultant, dropped out.\nRepublican primary\nCandidates\n*Glen Urquhart, businessman\n*Michele Rollins, businesswoman and former Miss District of Columbia USA and former Miss World America 1963\n*Rose Izzo, columnist\nResults\n}}\nGeneral election\nCampaign\nAccording to a September 2010 poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind, \"likely voters in Delaware split 45%-40% on whether they prefer[ed] to have the U.S. Congress controlled by the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, suggesting that the First State's open congressional seat might be hotly contested,\" yet in the same poll, Carney led Urquhart by 51%-36%. Peter Woolley, the poll director, remarked that \"candidates matter, not just parties\" and that in Delaware candidates matter \"more than in most states.\"\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=bottom\n! width=205px| Poll source\n! width=205px| Date(s) administered\n! width=100px| GlenUrquhart (R)\n! width=100px| JohnCarney (D)\n|-\n|Monmouth University\n| align=center| October 25–27, 2010\n| align=center| 44%\n|  align=center| 51%\n|-\n|Fairleigh Dickinson\n| align=center| October 20–26, 2010\n| align=center| 36%\n|  align=center| 53%\n|-\n|Monmouth University\n| align=center| October 8–11, 2010\n| align=center| 44%\n|  align=center| 53%\n|-\n|Fairleigh Dickinson\n| align=center| September 27 – October 3, 2010\n| align=center| 36%\n|  align=center| 51%\n|-\n|University of Delaware\n| align=center| September 16–30, 2010\n| align=center| 31%\n|  align=center| 48%\n|-\n|Wilson Research Strategies\n| align=center| September 27–28, 2010\n| align=center| 41%\n|  align=center| 45%\n|-\n|Grove Insight\n| align=center| September 15–18, 2010\n| align=center| 32%\n|  align=center| 50%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\n| align=center| September 11–12, 2010\n| align=center| 37%\n|  align=center| 48%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\n| align=center| August 7–8, 2010\n| align=center| 30%\n|  align=center| 48%\n|}\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Source\n!Ranking\n!As of\n|-\n| align=left | The Cook Political Report\n|\n| November 1, 2010\n|-\n| align=left | Rothenberg\n|\n| November 1, 2010\n|-\n| align=left | Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n| November 1, 2010\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |RCP\n|\n| November 1, 2010\n|-\n| align=left |CQ Politics\n|\n|October 28, 2010\n|-\n| align=left |New York Times\n|\n| November 1, 2010\n|-\n| align=left |FiveThirtyEight\n}}\nCounties that flipped from Republican to Democratic\n*New Castle (largest city: Wilmington)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://elections.delaware.gov/ Election Commissioner] at the Delaware Secretary of State\n**[http://elections.delaware.gov/services/candidate/candidate_list.shtml Official candidate listings]\n*[http://www.votesmart.org/election_congress_state.php?state_id=DE U.S. Congress candidates for Delaware]  at Project Vote Smart\n*[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/ContainerDetail.html?ContainerID=188 Delaware U.S. House] from OurCampaigns.com\n*[http://www.opensecrets.org/races/election.php?state=DE Campaign contributions for U.S. Congressional races in Delaware] from OpenSecrets\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100131023714/http://www.pollster.com/polls/de/ 2010 Delaware General Election] graph of multiple polls from Pollster.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120309071427/http://cookpolitical.com/house?toState=DE House - Delaware] from the Cook Political Report\n*[https://archive.today/20130120025529/http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=district-2010-DE-AL Delaware House Race] from CQ Politics\n*[http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/house/delaware/1 Race profile] at The New York Times\n*[http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/100817025/1006&theme=ELECTION2010&template=theme Election 2010]  at The News Journal"
