The film's sets were designed by the art director Umberto Turco.\nAlthough not clearly specified, the film refers to the history of football club based in Cesena, Emilia-Romagna, that reached Serie A in the 1970s, achieving a best result of sixth place in 1975–76 Serie A season, a result that allowed it to compete in the 1976–77 UEFA Cup season the following year, equivalent to today's Europa League. In total, Cesena Football Club played 13 seasons in Serie A from 1973 to 2015. It currently holds first place in Serie B for the 2025–26 Serie B season season, with the stated goal to return to Serie A.\nSynopsis\nAfter inheriting a small-town football club in Romagna from his long-estranged father, Vatican official Benito Fornaciari shows little interest despite the club being promoted shortly afterwards. However, after selling several top players provokes a riot in the town, he has a damascene conversion and begins to plough huge amounts of money in the club and hires a supposedly brilliant Peruvian coach. When he proves to be inept and the club loses several games at the start of the new season, Fornaciari himself takes over control of the team from the bench. This leads to a dramatic surge in form as the club win match after match, with Fornaciari rallying the fans in a populist manner. He takes this too far during a local derby, provoking a pitch invasion and major damage to a rival team's stadium.\nThe ensuing trouble, including a fine and a points deduction, leads a rival consortium to try and oust Fornaciari as president. However, he counters by signing Omar Sívori for Borgorosso and is acclaimed by the supporters once more. The film ends with Fornaciari leading a convoy of the team and their supporters to an away game, in exactly the same style his father had done at the beginning.\nThe film is known to the Italian public for the sheer amount of stereotypes that depict the Italian society of the 1970s. Examples of this include the fraud Italian-Peruvian manager, who puts on a fake South American accent to fool the president, and the overwhelming presence of the Catholic Church, represented by the priest who rushes the weekly mass to make sure he can attend the match.\nCast\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Claudio G.
