      "text": "# Traditional Thai clothing\n\n]]\nTraditional Thai clothing (,  ) refers to the traditional styles of dress worn by the Thai people. It can be worn by men, women, and children. Traditional clothing for Thai women usually consists of a pha nung or a (chong kraben), and a sabai. Northern and northeastern women may wear a sin instead of a pha nung and a chong kraben with either a blouse or a suea pat. Chut thai for men includes a chong kraben or pants, a Raj pattern shirt, with optional knee-length white socks and a sabai. Chut thai for northern Thai men is composed of a sado, a white Manchu-styled jacket, and sometimes a khian hua. In formal occasions, people may choose to wear a so-called formal Thai national costume.\nHistory\n, 18th century painting in the National Palace Museum in Taipei.]]\nshows a Siamese official wearing lombok and chong kraben and a traditional Thai house]]\nHistorically, both Thai males and females dressed themselves with a loincloth wrap called chong kraben. Men wore their chong kraben to cover the waist to halfway down the thigh, whilst women wore their chong kraben down the waist to well below the knee. Members of the nobility wore silk robes called khrui and a tall, pointed hat called lomphok in attendance of  royal affairs. Bare chests and bare feet were accepted as part of the Thai formal dress code, and are observed in murals, illustrated manuscripts, and early photographs up to the middle–1800s. Prior to the 20th century, the primary markers that distinguished class in Thai clothing were the use of cotton and silk cloths with printed or woven motifs, but both commoners and royals alike wore wrapped, not stitched clothing. Traditional Thai attire changed significantly during the Rattanakosin period.\nPrior to the 1700s, Thai men and women both kept their hair long. However, following the Burmese–Siamese wars of 1759-1760 and 1765–1767 and repeated Burmese invasions into Ayutthaya, central Thai women began cutting their hair in a crew-cut short style, which remained the national hairstyle until the 1900s.\nFrom the 1860s onward, Thai royals \"selectively adopted Victorian corporeal and sartorial etiquette to fashion modern personas that were publicized domestically and internationally by means of mechanically reproduced images.\" Stitched clothing, including court attire and ceremonial uniforms, were invented during the reign of King Chulalongkorn. Western forms of dress became popular among urbanites in Bangkok during this period.\nDuring the early–1900s, King Chulalongkorn encouraged Thai women to wear long hair instead of traditional short hair which later became a trend during the reign of King Vajiravudh along with wearing pha sin (ผ้าซิ่น), a tubular skirt, instead of the chong kraben (โจงกระเบน), a cloth wrap.\nOn 15 January 1941, Plaek Pibulsonggram issued a Thai cultural mandate to modernize and Westernize Thai dress, by deeming the long-practiced customs of wearing underpants, wearing no shirt, or wearing a wraparound cloth, as forms of inappropriate public attire.\nTraditional costumes\nChong kraben\nChong kraben (Thai: โจงกระเบน, Thai pronunciation: [tɕoːŋ.kra.beːn]) is a traditional lower-body garment commonly worn in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. The Siamese people adopted this lower-body garment in ancient times. It is a long rectangular cloth used to wrap the lower body and reflects shared cultural influences across Mainland Southeast Asia. The garment is influenced in function by the South Asian Dhoti, but it is tailored to resemble trousers more than a skirt.\nIn Thailand, the chong kraben is typically worn by wrapping the fabric around the waist, extending the ends outward, twisting them together, passing the twisted portion between the legs, and tucking it into the waistband at the back. This practical design allowed for ease of movement and was commonly used in daily life as well as during formal or ceremonial occasions in Thai history. Today, it is often seen in traditional dance performances, historical reenactments, and cultural festivals.\nPha nung and Pha sin\n, one of the four consorts of King Chulalongkorn  wearing pha nung and pha biang]]\n(or Thep Kraison), Princess of Chiang Mai, consort of Inthawichayanon of Chiang Mai and mother of Dara Rasmi wearing pha sin and pha biang, before 1884]]\nPha nung (Thai: ผ้านุ่ง, Thai pronunciation: [pʰâː nûŋ]) is a traditional Thai lower-body garment made from a long rectangular piece of cloth wrapped around the waist and legs, resembling a skirt. It is traditionally worn by both men and women across Thailand. The term pha nung can be used broadly to describe various types of lower garments in Thai culture, including region-specific styles.\nOne notable variant is Pha sin (Thai: ผ้าซิ่น, Thai pronunciation: [pʰâː sîn]), a tubular skirt traditionally worn by women, especially in Northern, Northeastern Thailand and Laos. The pha sin is typically handwoven and decorated with intricate regional patterns. It is commonly divided into three sections: the hua sin (waistband), tua sin (main body), and tin sin (hem), each reflecting local artistry and identity.\nAnother widely used version is Pha thung (Thai: ผ้าถุง, Thai pronunciation: [pʰâː tʰūŋ]), a cylindrical skirt sewn at the ends for convenience. The pha thung is popular in daily life throughout Thailand due to its comfort, ease of wear, and versatility, often used at home, in markets, and even for bathing.\nThese garments reflect Thailand’s rich textile heritage, with variations in style, fabric, and pattern often indicating the wearer’s region, social status, or occasion.\nSabai or Pha biang\nSabai (Thai: สไบ; Thai pronunciation: [sa.baj]), also known as Pha biang (Thai: ผ้าเบี่ยง, Thai pronunciation: [pʰâː.bìaŋ]), is a traditional Thai shawl-like garment worn by both women and, occasionally, men. It is typically made of silk and consists of a long rectangular piece of fabric, approximately one foot wide, draped diagonally across the chest, covering one shoulder, with the end hanging down the back. The sabai could be worn over a bare upper body or layered atop another piece of clothing, such as a blouse or inner cloth which reflected both modesty and elegance and was commonly seen in the attire of noblewomen and members of the Thai royal court.\nHistorically, the sabai is part of a tradition of unstitched garments that was an integral part of traditional Thai attire, particularly during the Ayutthaya and early Rattanakosin periods that evolved from a long history of cultural exchange and indigenous innovation. Its form and the materials used to create it, such as silk and cotton, were significantly influenced by Indian textiles and fashion such as the sari and dupatta. The sabai and other draped clothing styles emerged from a dynamic process of synthesis between local traditions and the cultural and commercial influences that came to the region via extensive trade networks and early kingdoms like Dvaravati. These interactions led to the adoption and reinterpretation of foreign elements into distinct Southeast Asian forms, in a process of mutual exchange.\nDuring the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V, r. 1868–1910), Thai society underwent significant modernization and Westernization. The sabai continued to be worn but was often paired with Victorian-style garments, reflecting a fusion of traditional and Western fashion. This hybrid style remained popular into the reign of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI, r. 1910–1925), when Western clothing styles began to dominate more formal and urban dress codes.\nHowever, the use of sabai as everyday wear declined sharply during the cultural reforms of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram in the late 1930s and 1940s. As part of his nation-building and modernization campaign, Phibunsongkhram issued a series of cultural mandates, one of which promoted Western-style dress and discouraged traditional garments like the sabai, which were seen as incompatible with a \"modern\" national identity.\nDespite its decline in daily use, the sabai remains a symbol of Thai cultural heritage and is still worn today in traditional ceremonies, classical dance performances, and historical reenactments, preserving its place in the rich tapestry of Thai history.\nRaj pattern\nRaj pattern (Thai: ชุดราชปะแตน, Thai pronunciation: [t͡ɕʰút râːt.pà.tɛːn]) refers to a traditional Thai men's outfit, or more specifically, to its signature jacket. It has similarities with the Nehru jacket, but specific characteristics like a five-button front. This formal attire, introduced during the reign of King Chulalongkorn in the late 18th century, typically includes a high-collared white jacket with five buttons, worn with a chong kraben, knee-length socks, and black leather shoes. Originally worn by government officials and the upper class in Siam, it became popular among Bangkok's elite and remains a symbol of national pride today.\nIn modern times, the Raj pattern is worn in a variety of ceremonial and formal settings, such as royal functions, weddings, ordinations, and even cultural festivals like Loy Krathong. Style adaptations now include the use of premium fabrics like silk or fine cotton, and color variations such as cream, ivory, or even light pastels to suit different themes or skin tones. Some choose to pair the jacket with slacks for a more contemporary look, or coordinate accessories like metallic belts, cufflinks, or minimal jewelry to enhance elegance.\nDespite its historical roots, the Raj pattern continues to evolve, blending tradition with modern style for a timeless, dignified appearance.\nHam sleeve blouse\nHam sleeve blouse (Thai: เสื้อแขนหมูแฮม, Thai pronunciation: [sɯ̂a kʰǎn mǔː hɛ̌ːm]) is a traditional Thai blouse influenced by European women's fashion during the reign of King Chulalongkorn in the Rattanakosin Kingdom. It is a fitted lace blouse with ornate lace detailing, a tightly cinched waist, distinctive puffed upper sleeves that gradually narrow toward the tapered wrist.\nHistorically, The ham sleeve blouse first appeared in the Siamese royal court around 1895-1896. It was influenced by the ceremonial attire of royal ladies from Russian and Austrian courts, and some sources suggest influence from Victorian era England. The sleeve style, known in Europe as the Gigot sleeve or Leg-of-mutton sleeve, was popular among European women in the early and late 19th century.\nThe blouse was made of European lace with boning for a fitted shape. It featured a high collar, a fitted waist, lace ruffles, and lace panels covering the shoulders and chest. Despite its European adaptation, the outfit retained traditional Siamese elements: wearing a chong kraben, a sabai, hair in a floral bun, long socks, and low-heeled square-toed shoes or boots. Exceptionally, Chao Dara Rasmi paired it with a traditional sin luntaya. Accessories such as folding fans, drop earrings, layered pearl necklaces, and brooches with initials, flowers, or animal motifs complemented the outfit, often coordinated with the garment's color.\nIn Thailand, the style first appeared in official photographs of Queen Saovabha Phongsri, the Queen Mother, and Chao Chom Manda Chum during King Rama V's reign. It remained popular in the royal inner court during the late reign of King Chulalongkorn, but eventually fell out of favor and was replaced by long-sleeved lace blouses that lacked the puffed sleeve.\nPha khao ma\nwearing pha khao ma, 1882]]\nPha khao ma ( )) is a versatile plaid fabric woven for centuries in Thailand. It serves numerous purposes, including being worn as a waistband by Thai men, used as a handkerchief, fan, or head covering to protect against the sun, and even used as a makeshift cradle or to carry goods. The cloth's practicality and sustainability have attracted the attention of designers in the fashion and interior design industries. The word Khao ma is derived from the Persian word Kamarband, meaning waistband or belt. This cloth has become an omnipresent item in Thai society. Its recognition as a national cultural heritage in Thailand and nomination for UNESCO World Heritage status in 2027.\nTabengman\n'Tabengman (' ) is a traditional Thai cloth that originated during the late Ayutthaya period. It consists of a piece of cloth that covers the chest and is tied behind the neck. It remains an important part of Thailand's cultural heritage and history, and continues to inspire contemporary fashion designers and artists. It has been featured in national and international events, and the clothing worn by the main character in the 2021 Disney film Raya and the Last Dragon, which is inspired by traditional Southeast Asian cloth including Tabengman.\nRegional costumes\nThe various regions and ethnic groups of Thailand have rich and distinctive clothing and textile traditions, with each community expressing its cultural identity through unique patterns, weaving techniques, and garment styles.\nSuea pat\nSuea pat (Thai: เสื้อปัด, Thai pronunciation: [sɯ̂a.pàt]) is a traditional long-sleeved blouse commonly worn by women in Northern Thailand, Laos and among Tai peoples, particularly in the historical region of Lanna. Characterized by its lack of buttons, the blouse is worn by wrapping the right side of the front panel over the left, and securing it with fabric ties or strings. The design provides both elegance and practicality, suitable for the region's temperate climate and cultural customs.\nHistorically, the suea pat was an essential part of Lanna women's traditional dress, often paired with a sabai (shawl) and a pha sin (tubular skirt). It was especially popular in Chiang Mai, Lamphun, and other northern provinces, where it featured in both everyday wear and formal attire. The materials and patterns of suea pat garments varied according to the wearer’s social status, with handwoven cotton used for daily use and finer silk versions reserved for ceremonies and festivals.\nThe suea pat reflects the aesthetic values and craftsmanship of Northern Thai textile culture, including the use of natural dyes, intricate weaving techniques, and motifs unique to Lanna identity. Although Western-style clothing became more dominant in the 20th century, the suea pat remains an important cultural garment and is still worn during traditional events, temple festivals, and regional cultural celebrations. Its continued presence in modern Thai fashion underscores the ongoing revival and appreciation of local heritage.\nBanong\nBanong ( ) or Baju Kurung is a type of blouse traditionally worn by women in the southern border provinces of Thailand, including Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat. It has a collar and is cut in front, with a folded placket all the way to the hem. The fabric used to make Banong is often thin and sheer, and may be embroidered with patterns on the hem. It is typically worn during religious and cultural events like weddings, funerals, and dance performances. The name Banong comes from the word Bandung in Middle Malay, which refers to a city in the west of Java Island, Indonesia. While Banong is popular among Thai Muslims in the southern border provinces, it is also worn by Thai Buddhists and Thai Chinese in the region.\nKebaya and Baba Nyonya\nKebaya (Thai: เกอบายา, Thai pronunciation: [kəː.baː.jaː]) and Baba Nyonya (Thai: บาบ๋า-ย๋าหย่า, Thai pronunciation: [baː.bǎː jáː.jàː]) a traditional blouse characterized by its open front and delicate tailoring, commonly made from lightweight fabrics such as silk, cotton, voile, or lace. Decorative elements like embroidery and lacework are often featured, and the blouse is typically fastened with buttons or brooches. It is usually worn with a long lower-body wrap, known as a sarong, kain, or kemben, which is draped and tucked around the waist or under the arms. These wraps may be made from distinctive textiles such as batik, ikat, songket, or tenun.\nRecognized as a national costume in Indonesia, the kebaya holds strong cultural associations with Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese heritage. In neighboring Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei, it is also regarded as traditional attire, especially among Malay and Peranakan communities. Within these contexts, the complete outfit is often referred to as a “sarong kebaya,” with regional variations in design and textile motifs.\nIn southern Thailand, particularly in provinces around the Andaman Sea like Phuket, Krabi, Phang Nga, Ranong, Trang and Satun where are the heart of diversity in culture and practices of Peranakan communities. It is also typically worn by the muslim population in Pattani, Narathiwat and Yala. The kebaya remains part of the cultural identity of the local population. It is worn during festivals, community gatherings, and religious events, serving as a symbol of shared heritage and regional ties between the Southern Thai and the wider cultural sphere.\nToday, the kebaya continues to serve not only as traditional dress but also as a symbol of modern Southeast Asian elegance. Its iconic presence is evident in the uniforms of several national airlines, including Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia, where stylized versions of the kebaya are worn by female cabin crew.\nIn a landmark effort to preserve and celebrate regional heritage, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Thailand submitted a joint nomination in 2023 for the kebaya to be included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. This collaborative recognition underscores the kebaya’s cultural significance across borders and its enduring role in representing Southeast Asian identity.\nFormal costume\nThe formal Thai costume,  (, literally, 'Thai dress of royal endorsement'), includes several sets of dress, designed as the Thai national costume at formal occasions. Although described and intended for use as national costume, it is of relatively modern origins, having been developed in the 1960s under the guidance of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit, the Queen Mother. She worked with skilled artisans and scholars to improve traditional craftsmanship and create a unique national identity for Thailand.  Which later led to several styles of the Thai National Dress, including Thai Boromphiman, Thai Siwalai, and Thai Chakri. Each style combines traditional Thai artistry with modern design for formal and diplomatic occasions.\nDuring the 1960 state visit to western nations, Pierre Balmain and François Lesage supported Her Majesty’s vision by designing matching outfits, using local Thai silk from different regions of Thailand together with the cooperation of the SUPPORT Foundation. Their collaboration promoted Thai craftsmanship worldwide and highlighted the cultural importance of Thai textiles. In 1976, the Queen Mother took her mission further by founding the Support Foundation. The organization aims to preserve Thailand’s textile heritage and support traditional silk weaving in rural communities.\nGallery\nFile:Wani Laohakiat, Miss Siam 1935.jpg|Wani Laohakiat, Miss Siam 1935\nFile:Queen Rambai Barni of Siam Coronation Dress 1925.jpg|The coronation dress of Queen Rambai Barni of Siam, 1925\nFile:Voralaksanavadi.jpg|Princess Voralaksanavadi in full regalia on her tonsurate ceremony in 1880\nFile:Siamese Women (Siamois Femmes de Bangkok) by Bocourt 1863.png|Siamese women wearing Sabai and chong kraben, 1863\nFile:Younger Prince Chulalongkorn and 2 younger brother.jpg|Photograph of Prince Chulalongkorn (King Rama V) and his two younger brothers wearing chong kraben, 1851\nFile:King Vajiravudh in barrister-at-law gown.jpg|King Vajiravudh of Siam wearing the Suea khrui gown, 1915\nFile:กรมพระยาดำรงราชานุภาพ และเจ้าจอมมารดาชุ่ม.jpg|Prince Damrong Rajanubhab wearing raj pattern and his mother wearing pha nung and pha biang, 1912\nFile:Siamese lady of title, wife of Prime Minister, Bangkok, Siam Wellcome L0055546.jpg|Lady Pun Bunnag, Somdet Chaophraya Borom Maha Sri Suriwongse's wife wearing pha biang, 1866\nFile:Bualai of Phrae.jpg|Bualai, was a Princess Consort of Phiriya Thepphawong of Phrae wearing ham sleeve blouses and Pha sin, before 1902\nFile:Woralaksanawadi.jpg|Princess Voralaksanavadi,  a daughter of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) wearing pha nung and pha biang, 1926\nFile:Thai princesses of the Inner Court.jpg|Thai princess of the Inner Court of the Grand Palace, Bangkok in 1890\nFile:Siamese Women.jpg|Siamese women's photo, 1890\nFile:111 Women (9163948661).jpg|Painting of Siamese women wearing pha nung and Sabai or pha biang in Wat Pho, Bangkok\nSee also\n* Xout lao\n* Raj pattern\n* History of Thai clothing\n* Formal Thai national costume\n* Culture of Thailand\n* School uniforms in Thailand\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Conway, Susan, and Mūnnithi Čhēm ʻĒt Dapbœ̄nyū Thō̜msan.
