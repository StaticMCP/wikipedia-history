However upon Vijay Singh's death, Bhim Singh seized Jodhpur and proclaimed himself as the ruler of Marwar.\nMan Singh was sent to Jalore for his own safety, where he remained throughout the reign of his cousin, Bhim Singh of Marwar.\nHe succeeded on his cousin's death on 19 October 1803. In 1804 Man Singh broke the treaty with the British for cooperation and formed an alliance with Yashwantrao Holkar, however Jodhpur was invaded by Sindhia and was forced to break their alliance with Holkar and pay heavy tribute.\nOpposed by many of his principal nobles throughout his reign, he depended on the support of successive factions. The last of these were the Nath family, the Maharaja's spiritual advisers, who came to control state affairs and turned him into a recluse. Many of the nobles fled to neighbouring principalities, state repression having become entirely vengeful and cold-blooded.\nMan Singh, after finding it unbearable to see his kingdom get destroyed by the Sindhias and his own corrupt nobles and ministers, entered into treaty relations with the British on 6 January 1818.\nSiege of Mehrangarh\nIn 1806 the combined armies of Jaipur, Bikaner and Mewar declared war on Marwar in order to install a pretender as the Maharaja of Marwar. However, Man Singh defeated the combined army so comprehensively that Jagat Singh of Jaipur had to pay a sum of Rs. 2,00,000 to secure his safe passage. In honour of Man's victory over Jaipur the Jai Pol, or victory gate of, was built in the Mehrangarh fort in 1808.\nAsylum to Nagpur ruler\nIn 1829, Man Singh gave shelter to Mudhoji II Bhonsle, also known as Appa Sahib, the dethroned ruler of Nagpur against the wishes of British. He refused to hand him over to the British in spite of persistent demands by Governor General Lord William Bentinck. Appa Sahib remained in Jodhpur at Man Mandir till his death in 1840.\nDeath and legacy\nMan Singh died at Mandore, 4th September 1843.\nWorks\nMan Singh was a eminent poet and scholar of his time and had composed several poems and texts.\n* Charan Badi Amolak Cheej\n* Nath-Purana\n* Nath-Sharot\n* Nath-Shatak\n* Siddha-Gyan\nSee also\n*Rulers of Marwar\nReferences"
