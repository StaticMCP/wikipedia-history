He was a member of the committee that drafted the rules for Rugby union.\nAlthough he was a free-hitting right-handed batsman, Rutter was more prominent as a slow left-handed round-arm bowler. Playing for Middlesex against Kent at Gravesend in 1868 he had a match analysis of 11 for 123. When Surrey beat Middlesex by three wickets in 1870, he took every Surrey wicket that fell in the second innings, finishing with 7 for 47.\nHe wrote a memoir, Cricket Memories, which was published in 1925, the year before he died.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
