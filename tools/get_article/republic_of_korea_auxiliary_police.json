divided into those directly under police agencies and those belonging to the Task Force.\nMembers of the mobile units will be classified as local police and police officers. The internal structure of the task force consists of the headquarters platoon, the 1st Platoon, the 2nd Platoon and the 3rd Platoon.\nThe leader of the start-up team is the Director General, the assistant director is the Director General, the Director of the start-up team is the Director General, the Manerintendent is the Head, and the Director of the company is the Director. In normal cases, an Inspector will take over the platoon leader for riot police belonging to the local police department or for security patrols. However, some are in charge of acting as a platoon leader, with the Assistant Inspector-class wearing green shoes. In addition, the assistant platoon leader is usually the Assistant Inspector level, but Senior Policeman is in some cases.\nIdentity\nIdentity is a police officer and not a soldier during service as Auxiliary Police. Also, they belong to the police officers, which are prescribed under Article 2 (1) of the National Compensation Act.\nPeacetime and wartime operation\nBased on the permanent establishment company, the agency will be operated in peacetime under the direction of management of the experience, which is provided by the police service department of each district. Career management is divided into preparation for the situation, congestion security, facility security, security patrols, and transportation assistance.\nCongestion guards play a role of maintaining order and protecting key personnel at various event sites, and facility security refers to guarding important facilities.\nA security patrol is generally defined as a patrol unit patrolling the jurisdiction of the police station to which the unit belongs.\nAuxiliary Police will also fight with the military's reserve in case of emergency. It has a K2 rifle, an individual weapon, and basic personal equipment such as magazines and helmets. Unlike the South Korean military, however, they do not fire rifles in peacetime, and only one or two times a year they conduct regular shooting exercises at nearby military firing ranges.\nThe Auxiliary police in culture\nAuxiliary police also appear in dramas and movies when demonstration scene.\nIn the comics, Naver Webtoon author Jo Seok frequently describes his experiences in Auxiliary police service by writing a comic book titled \"The Sound of Heart\" (Hangul: 마음의 소리). It was published in June 2007.\nOn Naver Webtoons, Seongjeon and Yoon Sung-won are running a cartoon entitled \"Beautiful Gunbari\" every Monday. The writer describes the situation in the mid-2000s when he was serving in the military in a very realistic manner. On the other hand, the difference between the existing comics is that the main characters and the order of the group are both women as in the comic universe South Korea has enacted a universal conscription policy which both men and women are required to perform compulsory military service.\nThe Dissolution of The Auxiliary Police\nMoon Jae-in, the president, announced plans to completely lift the Republic of Korea Auxiliary Police after 2023.\nAs a result, National Police Agency has been cutting staff by 20 percent every year since 2017.\nAfter the last conscripted conscripts in December 2021, they will be completely abolished after September 2023. Finally, in 2023, march, the historic agency was officially disbanded after its long 55 years of service, and the remaining officers who were in the Republic Of Korea Coast Guard were discharged from service in June Fourth the same year, making it unofficially disbanded in that same day.\nRelevant laws\n* Police law\n* Act on the establishment and operation of the Auxiliary police force\n* The Military Service Law\nReferences\nExternal links"
