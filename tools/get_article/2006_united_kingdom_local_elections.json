Several councils elected half of their seats: these were Adur, Cheltenham, Fareham, Gosport, Hastings, Nuneaton and Bedworth, and Oxford. Local elections follow a four-year cycle, and the 2006 election was the follow-on from the 2002 elections.\nMayoral contests were held in the London boroughs of Hackney, Lewisham and Newham, and in Watford.  Crewe and Nantwich held a referendum on the issue of whether or not to have a directly elected mayor.\nThis was the first set of elections since David Cameron was elected leader of the Conservative Party. The Conservatives strengthened their position as the largest party in local government, making headway against Labour.\nResults\nNote: Figures for number of councils and councillors is only in regard to those councils up for election in 2006, and does not include councils not up for election.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|- border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"  | Party\n! colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | Councillors\n! colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | Councils\n|-\n! valign=\"top\" | Number\n! valign=\"top\" | Change\n! valign=\"top\" | Number\n! valign=\"top\" | Change\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,830\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 316\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 68\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 11\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,439\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 319\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 30\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 17\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 909\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 13\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 35\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 13\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 33\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 33\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 29\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 20\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 16\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 13\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 8\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Other\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| n/a\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| n/a\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 65\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"|5\n|}\n*Turnout was 36%, compared to 40% in 2004 and 33% in 2002.\nPre-election predictions\nOn 7 April, a report produced by the University of Plymouth for Newsnight, based on results of council by-elections in the past three months, suggested that, compared to the 2002 local elections:\n* Labour would increase their national vote share by 2% to 28% but that they would lose around 130 seats.\n* The Conservatives would suffer a decrease in the national vote share of 4% leaving them with 33% and a loss of around 95 seats.\n* The Liberal Democrats would increase their vote share by 2% to 29% and would gain around 190 seats.\nThis prediction may be seen to be almost entirely inaccurate.\nProjected national share\nIn an analysis for the Sunday Times, psephologists Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, of the University of Plymouth, produced an estimate of the national share of the vote. According to their calculations, the parties would have the following share of the vote:\n*Conservative: 39%\n*Labour: 26%\n*Liberal Democrats: 25%\n*Others: 10%\nThey note that this is estimate not intended to predict the vote share in an actual general election, because voters often vote differently in general elections due to local issues, or to a wish to \"fire a shot across the government's bows\" without actually removing it.\nThe BBC had a similar national share prediction, based on the results of 950 key wards:\n*Conservative: 40%\n*LibDem: 27%\n*Labour: 26%\n*Others: 7%\nNotable battles\n* In Birmingham, the Acting Returning officer announced that the votes in the Kingstanding ward had been incorrectly tallied, incorrectly giving a win to the BNP's Sharon Ebanks, whereas she should have been in third place. The only way in which this result can be corrected is for one of the candidates to raise a petition to the courts; the council has said it will support in any way it can any candidates who wish to raise such a petition. Labour's Catherine Grundy did so, and was declared the rightful winner.\n* In Crawley, after three recounts, one result showed 500 votes for the Labour candidate and 500 for the Conservative. As per electoral law, the candidates subsequently drew lots. The Conservative candidate Adam G. Brown won, giving his party a majority and switching the council from Labour to Conservative control for the first time since 1971.\n* Another count was tied in St Albans, this time between Conservative and Lib Dem candidates on 1,131 votes each. The candidates drew lots with the Lib Dems winning, giving them a majority on the local council.\n* In Chester the Conservatives were in third place in one ward, with around only 20% of the votes (in 2004), however they managed to win the seat with a majority of around 20%, and a 45% vote share. Their vote increased by over 110%, and was believed to be one of the largest increases in vote share (as a percentage) in the country.\nCampaign launches\nUK Independence Party (UKIP) launched their local election campaign on 28 March 2006, where they put forward their policies for the local elections which included: the reduction of council tax by 50%; local binding referendums on major issues; and giving councils control of business rates and letting them receive the proceeds from stamp duty.\nThe Liberal Democrats' campaign launch was held on 3 April and was led by Sir Menzies Campbell MP.\nLabour's campaign for the local elections was launched on 5 April and was led by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair MP (Lab, Sedgefield) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Blair's expected successor, Gordon Brown MP (Lab, Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath) in the wake of rumours of a split between the two over when Blair should stand down as Prime Minister.\nRespect launched their election manifesto on 10 April 2006 calling the local elections a referendum on New Labour.\nThe Greens launched their campaign on 11 April, having already announced that 1,300 candidates will be standing across the country.\nThe BNP launched their election manifesto on 14 April. Soon after, Margaret Hodge, the Labour Employment Minister, told the press that 8 out of 10 white voters in her east London constituency of Barking admitted being tempted to vote for the BNP, hinting that the party's share of council seats was set to increase.\nThe Conservatives launched their campaign on 18 April. David Cameron, Eric Pickles, Caroline Spelman and Peter Ainsworth fronted a press conference that focused on environmental issues.\nTimeline\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Event\n|-\n| 28 March\n| UKIP (UK Independence Party) launch local election campaign.\n|-\n| 29 March\n| The London Communications Agency issue a study suggesting that the Conservatives would gain a minimum of six London Borough councils.\n|-\n| 3 April\n| The Liberal Democrats launch local election campaign.\n|-\n| 4 April\n| Independent anti-war strategic voting web site launched in London.\n|-\n| 5 April\n| Labour launch their local election campaign.\nConservatives offer a chance for \"ordinary people\" to appear in the local election broadcast.\n|-\n| 10 April\n| Respect launch their local election campaign.\n|-\n| 14 April\n| The British National Party launch their election campaign.\n|-\n| 18 April\n| The first party election broadcast by the Labour Party depicts David Cameron MP (Con, Witney) as a chamleon and even launch a website to promote the idea.
