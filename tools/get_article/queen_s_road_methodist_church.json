The church was opened on 24 May 1900.\nThe building was designed for 425 people and cost around £1,900 (equivalent to £}} in ).\nAs of 2014 the church merged with the congregations at Wollaton Road Methodist Church, Chilwell Road Methodist Church and the former site at Queen's Road went up for sale in 2018.\nReferences"
