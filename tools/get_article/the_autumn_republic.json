For the first time in history, the capital of Adro is in the hands of a foreign invader. Reinforcements are weeks away, and friends and foes have become indistinguishable of each other.\nInspector Adamat, still searching for his kidnapped son, finds himself drawn into the very heart of the action, struggling to keep up with the mutiny that has turned the Adran army against itself.\nMeanwhile, Taniel Two-Shot is hunted by men he once thought his friends, and finds himself the only hope for Adro.\nPre-publication\nOn February 21, 2014 McClellan wrote on his blog that he had almost finished the third book.
