It is their first album to feature Mariska Veres, the group's signature frontwoman and lead singer.\nOverview\nThe album is the group's first record with singer Mariska Veres. Robbie van Leeuwen acquired Veres in an attempt to ape the form of the female-fronted Jefferson Airplane. With Veres's notable vocal performance and stunning looks, the band finally had an adequate frontwoman.\nAt Home was a mixture of influences ranging from pop rock to psychedelic rock. There is also early evidence of their interest in Americana, with tracks like \"California Here I Come\" and \"Harley Davidson\".\nThe hit single \"Venus\" was omitted from the original Dutch pressings of the album, but was appended to the international versions both as an opening or closing track to the side one. Singles \"Long and Lonesome Road\" and \"Mighty Joe\" were also featured on several versions of the album.\nAt Home was repackaged for the American market as a self titled album rearranging tracklisting, omitting \"I'll Write Your Name Through the Fire\" and including singles of that period. The Argentinian version has the same tracklisting with different order, in Mono, different cover and titled \"Venus\" on the cover .\nSince the first reissue of At Home in 1989 \"Venus\" and \"Long and Lonesome Road\" were constantly present on the main tracklistings, both on CD and LP. Additional CD bonus tracks were the b-sides of that period.\nUses in media and cover versions\nThe John Mayer version of the song \"Acka Raga\" was used as the theme song for the BBC1 quiz show Ask the Family.\nThe track \"Love Buzz\" gained notoriety when it was covered by grunge band Nirvana.\nTrack listing\nAll songs were written by Robbie van Leeuwen, except for \"Acka Raga\" by John Mayer.\nOriginal version\n;Side one\n#\"Boll Weevil\" – 2:40\n#\"I'll Write Your Name Through the Fire\"– 2:50\n#\"Acka Raga\" – 3:10\n#\"Love Machine\" – 3:15\n#\"I'm a Woman\" – 3:00\n;Side two\n#\"California Here I Come\" – 3:15\n#\"Poor Boy\" – 4:50\n#\"Love Buzz\" – 3:40\n#\"The Butterfly and I\" – 3:50\nAmerican The Shocking Blue version\n;Side one\n#\"Long and Lonesome Road\" – 2:44\n#\"Love Machine\" – 3:15\n#\"The Butterfly and I\" – 3:50\n#\"Venus\" – 3:07\n#\"California Here I Come\" – 3:15\n#\"Poor Boy\" – 4:50\n;Side two\n#\"Mighty Joe\" – 3:04\n#\"Boll Weevil\" – 2:40\n#\"Acka Raga\" – 3:10\n#\"Love Buzz\" – 3:40\n#\"I'm a Woman\" – 3:00\n#\"Send Me a Postcard\"– 2:33\nArgentinian \"Venus\" version\n;Side one\n#\"Venus\"\n#\"Love machine (La máquina del amor)\"\n#\"The butterfly and I (La mariposa y yo)\"\n#\"I'm a woman (Soy una mujer)\"\n#\"Poor boy (Pobre muchacho)\"\n;Side two\n#\"Mighty Joe (Joe el poderoso)\"\n#\"Bool weevil (El gusanito)\"\n#\"Acka Ragh\"\n#\"Love buzz (Susurro amoroso)\"\n#\"California here I come (California aquí llego)\"\n#\"Send me a postcard (Mándame una postal)\"\nReissue edition\n#\"Boll Weevil\" – 2:40\n#\"I'll Write Your Name Through the Fire\"– 2:50\n#\"Acka Raga\" – 3:10\n#\"Love Machine\" – 3:15\n#\"I'm a Woman\" – 3:00\n#\"Venus\" – 3:07\n#\"California Here I Come\" – 3:15\n#\"Poor Boy\" – 4:50\n#\"Long and Lonesome Road\" – 2:44\n#\"Love Buzz\" – 3:40\n#\"The Butterfly and I\" – 3:50\n;CD reissue bonus tracks\nPersonnel\n* Mariska Veres - lead vocals\n* Robbie van Leeuwen - guitar, sitar, backing vocals\n* Klaasje van der Wal - bass guitar\n* Cor van der Beek - drums\nStudio musicians\n*Cees Schrama - keyboards\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1970)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|30\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\n|relyear=1969|salesamount=25,000|salesref=}}\nReferences"
