It drains a section of pre-Alpine hill country north of the Gantrisch chain and is part of the Rhine catchment area.\nSource area\nThe headwaters of the Schwarzwasser are located at approximately  a.s.l. on the municipal land of Rüschegg north of the Gantrisch area. They originated in a basin on the northern slope of the Süftenegg, situated between the peaks of Pfyffe ( a.s.l.) to the west and Schüpfenflue ( a.s.l.) to the east. Over its first , the Schwarzwasser torrent descends more than ;  cutting through a notch valley that is deeply entrenched in the slope. At the base of the slope in the area of Heubach and Eigrund, the valley is filled with erosion material (boulders and gravel). Here, the Schwarzwasser joins the Wissenbach, the Biberze (both from the right) and the Gambach (from the left), all of which drain the Gurnigel area.\nSee also\n*List of rivers of Switzerland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
