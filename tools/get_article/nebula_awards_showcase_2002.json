Farmer in KLIATT writes that \"[t]he current winners generally have a dark humor or philosophical 'bent.' ... Several of these works carry the sense of being parts of larger efforts, [and] so sometimes feel incomplete. Still, they provide an interesting look into today's approach to the genre, particularly according to the views of peer authors.\" The pieces by Williams, Bear, Bisson, Arnason, Nagata, and Dozois are singled out for comment.\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Philip Snyder in SFRA Review no. 258, 2002, and Gary K.
