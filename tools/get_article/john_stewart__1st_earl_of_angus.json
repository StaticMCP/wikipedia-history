Sir Alexander died around 1319, and Stewart inherited his father's estates in Berwickshire, centered upon the barony of Bonkyll and Preston.\nIn 1328, he married Margaret de Abernethy, heiress to the Lordship of Abernethy. Her father Sir Alexander de Abernethy was the last of the Gaelic lords of Abernethy, descendants of Gille Míchéil, Earl of Fife. Stewart assumed his wife's titles, and was further ennobled by Robert I of Scotland in 1329, being created Earl of Angus. The Earldom of Angus had been forfeited by the previous holder, Robert de Umfreville, before 1314, for choosing the losing side during the Wars of Scottish Independence, although he continued to style himself Earl until his death in 1325.\nIt is through John Stewart's granddaughter, Margaret's illicit relationship with William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, that the Earldom of Angus, Lordship of Abernethy, and the comitatus associated with it passed on to the Douglases in the person of George Douglas (the first Red Douglas). This close connection of the Douglas Earls of Angus with the House of Stewart was to have large implications for the latter's future struggles with the Black Douglases.\nStewart was knighted on 24 November 1331 on the coronation of King David II, but died just two weeks later. He was succeeded by his son Thomas Stewart, 2nd Earl of Angus.\nSee also\n*Bonkyl Kirk\nReferences\n|-"
