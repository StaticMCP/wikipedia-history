The sculpture sets on a base of granite from Stone Mountain.\nThe sculpture  was erected in 1926, eight years after World War I ended, but its intent was broadened to honor all of America's war dead.  In describing it, Borglum said \"The design represents a great spearhead.  Upon the green field of this spearhead we have placed a Tudor sword, the hilt of which represents the American nation at a crisis, answering the call to arms.\"\nThe work was funded by a $100,000 bequest by Newark businessman Amos Hoagland Van Horn, who also funded Borglums Seated Lincoln, also located in Newark.\nThe sculpture was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 1994.\n.  \"The design represents a great spearhead.
