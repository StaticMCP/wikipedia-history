The oak is at least 1300 years old according to experts and potentially as old as 1500 years. Both of these numbers would make the tree the oldest oak in the United Kingdom.\nHealth\nThe tree split centuries ago, and a sizeable part of the trunk has died and fallen to the ground, whereas several other offshoots remain living. The tree has a live, vigorous top. Recently, fears were raised in regards to the tree's health if it got infested by the oak processionary moth.\nLocation and status\nThe tree grows on private land with no public access at Windsor Great Park, and has been registered as a Tree of National Special Interest.\nSee also\n*King Offa\n*List of Great British Trees\nReferences"
