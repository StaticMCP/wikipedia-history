On March 15, 2014, they uploaded their cover. Filmed by Robbie, the video starred Mia as a young Anna and Ariana as a teen Anna and received over 16 million views by April of that year and over 46 million views by July of that year. Jeane Bourne reused fabric at their home to make a costume for Mia, and they used duct tape for Mia's oversized shoes. They spent $5.49 to produce the video. The expense was from purchasing contact paper which they covered in blue paint for the door in the video. They filmed the video with a digital single-lens reflex camera a friend lent them, recorded the dialogue and singing using a Rock Band video game microphone, used GarageBand's no-cost software, and created a pop filter from nylon tights and a clothes hanger. They filmed for two days for seven hours each day. Sean P. Means of The Salt Lake Tribune called the cover \"accurate and quite touching\".\nThe popularity of their \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\" cover convinced Robbie Bagley and Jeane Bourne to create a cover of a second Frozen song, \"Love Is an Open Door\", which they had earlier considered making. Starring Mia and her brother Anson, the cover was released on YouTube on May 22, 2014, and by July of that year, it had received over 14 million views. With the money earned from their first cover, Working with Lemons was able to increase the budget for \"Love is an Open Door\" by purchasing higher quality costumes. They filmed the music video at the Thanksgiving Point complex in Lehi, Utah, and attempted to model their set after the movie's. Bustle reviewer Olivia Truffaut-Wong said that although the \"vocals might leave something to be desired\", the cover was \"simply adorable\" and \"absolutely irresistible\" by having \"Frozen with kids\" with a \"a mini Anna and mini Hans\".\nWorking with Lemons on June 24, 2014, uploaded to YouTube their cover of \"In Summer\" starring Robbie Bagley.

Released on March 20, 2015, the cover featured Robbie's sister, Camrey Bagley. With about 350 million views by August 2017, their Let It Go cover is their most-watched video.\nHamilton covers\nWorking with Lemons uploaded their first Hamilton cover, featuring the songs \"Aaron Burr, Sir\" and \"My Shot\".
