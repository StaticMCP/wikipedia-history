It is located on Bains Road in Canning, Nova Scotia.\nThe school replaced the high schools of Kings County Academy in Kentville and Cornwallis District High School in Canning.\nNKEC's students come from the Kentville, Canning, Halls Harbour, North Kentville, Scots Bay and Centreville areas of Kings County. The school provides public education for Grade 6 through to Grade 12 and is divided into a middle school (Grades 6–8) and a high school (Grades 9–12). Glooscap Elementary School and Aldershot Elementary School students begin attending NKEC in Grade 6, while students from Kings County Academy in Kentville begin with Grade 9. Northeast Kings Education Centre has the second largest student population of any public school in western Nova Scotia. There are approximately 900 students and 80 staff members in the school.\nFacilities\nThe school has a large gymnasium that can be divided into two separate gyms which allows both the middle school and high school to use the facility simultaneously. The school also has a cafeteria, a \"learning commons\" area, and 50 classrooms and labs. There is also a stage that opens for viewing in the cafeteria or the gymnasium, as well as an outdoor stage with seating. The school also boasts a football field, a baseball diamond, two soccer fields, outdoor basketball courts, tennis courts, and a nearby ice rink (Glooscap Arena), all within walking distance of the school grounds.\nCuisine\nSince the 2025/26 school year, the school's cafeteria offers daily pre-ordered lunches through the Nova Scotia School Lunch program. This represented a departure from the earlier arrangement, in which students were sustained by a variety of menu items sometimes described as the cafeteria's culinary highlights, consisting of various delicacies such as milk and flatbread pizza, the latter offered at $4.70 CAD in the 2024/25 school year. Students are also provided with an opportuity to prepare their own culinary delights with the school's cooking club.\nAthletics\nIn athletics, the school offers badminton, basketball, cross country, football, golf, hockey, table tennis, track and field, cheerleading, softball, volleyball, and soccer. NKEC has won provincial championships in badminton (multiple), girls and boys soccer (multiple), boys hockey (multiple), girls basketball, track and field, cross country, table tennis (multiple) and division 2 football (multiple). The majority of the school's athletic teams, clubs and committees are run by school staff members, while a few teams are coached by community members.\nMusic & Arts\nNKEC music program's Senior Concert Band won gold at the Annapolis Valley Music Festival in both 2012 and 2013, winning their category in 2013, which gave them the honour of performing in the Stars of the Festival concert. The school hosts musicals annually and offers Senior Jazz band, Senior Concert band along with Junior Concert band.\nMedia\nNortheast Kings also hosts a student-led media club producing morning announcements and other content, distributed primarily through YouTube. Anthems are played each morning through these announcements, following a meticulous schedule. On Mondays, both the Canadian national anthem and a Mi'kmaq anthem are played; on Wednesdays, the Canadian anthem followed by the anthem of another country; and on Fridays, the Canadian and Lift Every Voice and Sing are played, ensuring that each day begins with its prescribed musical ritual.\nAcademics\nAlthough not known for their academics, NKEC offers a wide variety of academic opportunities for its students:\n*AP Capstone Program for grades 10 -12\n*French immersion for grades 9-12\n*Co-op 11 and 12 (community or Acadia University work placement)\n*Fine Arts Certificate\n*Career Access:The Career Access Program is a highly modified 3-year program which covers grades 10–12.
