Like the Uruk Trough, Mask of Warka, and the Narmer Palette from Egypt, it is one of the earliest surviving works of narrative relief sculpture, found, no in situ, in a layer dated to c. 3100–2900 BC. Simple relief sculpture is also known from much earlier periods, from the site of Göbekli Tepe, dating to circa 9000 BC.\nThe bottom register displays naturalistic components of life, including water and plants, such as date palm, barley, and wheat. On the upper portion of the lowest register, alternating rams and ewes march in a single file. The middle register conveys naked men carrying baskets of foodstuffs symbolizing offerings. Lastly, the top register depicts the goddess a female deity accepting a votive offer. A female deity stands at the front portion of the gate surrounded by her richly filled shrine and storehouse (identifiable by two reed door poles with dangling banners). This scene may illustrate a reproduction of the ritual marriage between the goddess and her consort that ensures Uruk's continued vitality.\nDiscovery\nThe vase was discovered as a collection of 15 fragments by German archaeologists in their sixth excavation season at Uruk in 1933/1934. The find was recorded as find number W14873 in the expedition's field book under an entry dated 2 January 1934, which read \"Großes Gefäß aus Alabaster, ca. 96&nbsp;cm hoch mit Flachrelief\" (\"large container of alabaster, circa 96&nbsp;cm high with flat-reliefs\"). It was on excavation level III which dated to the Jemdat Nasr period (also called the Uruk III period) ie (c. 3100-2900 BC) in the \"Eanna district\". It was not found in situ as part of a \"temple treasury hoard\" so\nthat would be a no later than date. Because of some similarities to numerical tables it has been suggested the vase dates to Uruk V (c, 3500 BC). It was found along with a number of other items (including fragments of another vase) and was deemed a votive object by the excavators. The vase had been repaired in antiquity using copper bands.\nBecause the reconstruction of the base is uncertain estimates of the total height\nof the vase range from 105cm to 110cm (the relief portion is 92cm high). The diameter at the mouth is 38cm and 28cm and the narrowest point near the base and wall thickness is\n2cm at the top part and increases toward the bottom. The three registers are 25cm,\n17.5cm, and 20.5cm from top to bottom. The bottom register is divided by a band which results in the vase sometimes being said to have four registers.\nA plaster cast was made of the original and this reproduction stood for many decades in room 5 of the Near-Eastern Museum in Berlin (Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin), Germany.\nDecoration\nThe vase has three registers – or tiers – of carving. The bottom register depicts the vegetation in the Tigris and Euphrates delta, such as the natural reeds and cultivated grain. Above this vegetation is a procession of animals, such as ram and sheep presented in a strict profile view. The procession continues in the second register with nude males carrying bowls and jars of sacrificial elements, such as fruit and grain. The top register is a full scene, rather than a continuous pattern. In this register, the procession ends at the temple area. A female deity stands with two bundles of reeds behind her. She is being offered a bowl of fruit and grain by a nude figure. A ruler-figure dressed in a ceremonial kilt and long belt faces her leading the procession.\nFile:Top register, Warka Vase, Uruk, c. 3000 BCE, Iraq Museum.jpg|Top register, Warka Vase, Iraq Museum\nFile:Top register, Warka Vase, from Uruk, c. 3000 BCE.

In April 2003, it was forcibly wrenched from the case where it was mounted, snapping at the base (the foot of the vase remaining attached to the base of the smashed display case.\nThe vase was later returned during an amnesty to the Iraq Museum on 12 June 2003 by three unidentified men in their early twenties, driving a red Toyota vehicle. As reported by a correspondent for The Times newspaper,\nSoon after the vase's return, broken into 14 pieces, it was announced that the vase would be restored. A pair of comparison photographs, released by the Oriental Institute, Chicago, showed significant damage (as of the day of return, 12 June 2003) to the top and bottom of the vessel.\nThe fully restored Warka Vase (museum number IM19606) is now on display in the Iraq Museum.\nSee also\n*Archaeological looting in Iraq\n*Art of Mesopotamia\n*Blau Monuments\n*Stele of Ushumgal\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Bahrani Z., \"Performativity and the image: Narrative, representation and the Uruk Vase, in Leaving No Stones Unturned: Essays on the Ancient Near East and Egypt in Honor of Donald P.
