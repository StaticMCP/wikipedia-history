CBC Television broadcast the ceremonies nationally.\nLabour problems at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation overshadowed plans for the awards broadcast. NABET complained about CBC plans to hire two American technical workers to assist with a special effect during the broadcast. NABET was renegotiating a labour contract with CBC and felt that Canadians should have been hired instead.\nMeanwhile, CBC workers with the CUPE stopped work on 7 November. This strike was temporary, but interrupted the work of some Juno stage hands who were members of that union. weekend. CUPE's workers returned to work on the day of the Junos broadcast, as this particular union action was not planned to continue past the weekend.\n1600 public tickets were made available, but all were sold late September, approximately one month after the $170 CAD tickets were offered for sale.\nGordon Lightfoot entered Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and was introduced at the ceremonies by Bob Dylan who made a surprise appearance.\nNominees and winners\nFemale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Luba\nOther nominees:\n* Carroll Baker\n* Anne Murray\n* Martine St. Clair\n* Jane Siberry\nMale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Bryan Adams\nOther nominees:\n* Bruce Cockburn\n* Kim Mitchell\n* Gino Vannelli\n* Neil Young\nMost Promising Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Kim Richardson\nOther nominees:\n* Chantal Condor\n* Siobhan Crawley\n* Francesca Gagnon\n* Sheree Jeacocke\nMost Promising Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Billy Newton-Davis\nOther nominees:\n* Doug Cameron\n* Michel Lemieux\n* Stan Meissner\n* Scott Merritt\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: Honeymoon Suite\nOther nominees:\n* Loverboy\n* Platinum Blonde\n* Rush\n* Triumph\nMost Promising Group of the Year\nWinner: Glass Tiger\nOther nominees:\n* Cats Can Fly\n* Chalk Circle\n* Eye Eye\n* One to One\nComposer of the Year\nWinner: Jim Vallance\nOther nominees:\n* Bryan Adams\n* David Foster\n* Corey Hart\n* Luba\nCountry Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Anne Murray\nOther nominees:\n* Carroll Baker\n* Marie Bottrell\n* Kelita\n* Anne Lord\nCountry Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Murray McLauchlan\nOther nominees:\n* Eddie Eastman\n* Gilles Godard\n* Country Group or Duo of the Year\nWinner: Prairie Oyster\nOther nominees:\n* Carroll Baker and Eddie Eastman\n* C-Weed Band\n* The Family Brown\n* The Mercey Brothers\nInstrumental Artist of the Year\nWinner: David Foster\nOther nominees:\n* Liona Boyd\n* Canadian Brass\n* Moe Koffman\n* Zamfir\nProducer of the Year\nWinner: David Foster, ''St. Elmo's Fire Soundtrack by various artists\nOther nominees:\n* Terry Brown, Just in Time to Be Late by Eye Eye\n* Graeme Coleman, The Bohemians by Skywalk\n* Leslie Howe, Forward Your Emotions by One to One\n* David Tyson, The Lines are Open by The Arrows and The Key by Erroll Starr\nRecording Engineer of the Year\nWinner: Joe and Gino Vannelli, Black Cars'' by Gino Vannelli\nOther nominees:\n* Patrick Glover, \"The Bohemians\" by Skywalk\n* Leslie Howe, \"Forward Your Emotions\" by One to One\n* Mike Jones and Paul Northfield, \"Don't Forget Me\" and \"Thin Red Line\" by Glass Tiger\n* Anton Kwiatkowski, \"Holst: The Planets\" by Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Andrew Davis conductor\nCanadian Music Hall of Fame\nWinner: Gordon Lightfoot\nWalt Grealis Special Achievement Award\nWinner: Jack Richardson\nNominated and winning albums\nAlbum of the Year\nWinner: The Thin Red Line, Glass Tiger\nOther nominees:\n* Alien Shores, Platinum Blonde\n* ''Lovin' Every Minute of It, Loverboy\n* Power Windows, Rush\n* The Big Prize, Honeymoon Suite\nBest Album Graphics\nWinner: Hugh Syme and Dimo Safari, Power Windows by Rush\nOther nominees:\n* Heather Brown, Dean Motter, Deborah Samuel, Between the Earth & Sky by Luba\n* Heather Brown, Hugh Syme, Peter Shelly, Robot Man and Friends by Peter Shelly\n* Mark Gane, Martha Johnson, Dimo Safari, The World Is a Ball by M + M\n* Allen Shechtman, Melosphere'' by Helmut Lipsky\nBest Children's Album\nWinner: 10 Carrot Diamond, Charlotte Diamond\nOther nominees:\n* A House For Me, Fred Penner\n* Come on In, Eric Nagler\n* Lots More Junior Jug Band, Chris Whiteley and Ken Whiteley\n* Songs + Games For Toddlers, Bob McGrath and Katharine Smithrim\nBest Classical Album of the Year -
