The skirt comprised some 30 metres of fabric. Hartnell specifically kept the adornments of the dress such as the crystal embellishments and beading to a minimum in order to suit Margaret's petite frame.\nThe dress now belongs to the British Royal Collection and is part of a display of royal wedding dresses at Kensington Palace in London.\nCritical appraisal\nVogue described the dress as \"stunningly tailored\". Another author called it \"a study in simplicity\". In 1960, Life magazine named it \"the simplest royal wedding gown in history\". It has also been described as one of Hartnell's most beautiful and sophisticated pieces.\nSee also\n* List of individual dresses\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13207649 BBC audio slideshow featuring her wedding dress]"
