However, the right bank of the Danube belonged to the Ottomans. There, on the right bank of the new Sava river, the Ottomans had built the Šabac Fortress in 1470. Hungarian king Matthias took it four years later.\nSultan Mehmed considered it necessary to prevent this situation immediately. He came to Edirne during winter, something the Hungarians did not believe he would do.\nExpedition\nThe Sultan reached the Danube after difficulty and suffering.\nWhen the Ottoman army arrived at Smederevo, it repelled several attacks and the garrisons of the two Hungarian forts around the city fled. However, those in the third fortress stood firm and suffered 500 casualties as a result of the Ottoman attack. Mehmed besieged the fort, but he knew that he could not continue the siege for a long time due to the harsh winter conditions. He had his soldiers cut down trees and had these fill in the ditch up to the level of the walls. Respecting the promise of safe passage, the garrison agreed to surrender as Mehmed prepared to burn the timber he had piled up to set the castle on fire.\nReferences"
