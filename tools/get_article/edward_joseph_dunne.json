He served as bishop of Dallas in Texas from 1894 until his death in 1910.\nBiography\nEarly life\nEdward Dunne was born on April 23, 1848, in Gortnahoe, County Tipperary, to Richard and Judith (née Cooke) Dunne. At a young age, he and his parents immigrated to the United States, settling in Chicago, Illinois. Dunne studied at St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and then at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland.\nPriesthood\nDunne was ordained to the priesthood in Baltimore for the Archdiocese of Chicago by Bishop Thomas Becker on June 29, 1871.\nOn his return to Chicago, the archdiocese assigned Dunne as a curate at St. John's Parish in Chicago. He was transferred in 1873 to St. Mary's Parish, then in 1875 was named pastor of All Saints Parish, both in Chicago. Dunne build a church at All Saints in 1880 and a parochial school. He also served as financial overseer for the archdiocese.\nIn early 1884, Dunne was sent to St. Anthony of Padua Parish in San Antonio, Florida for health reasons. Spending six months in San Antonio, he was credited by The Catholic Review with advancing the development of a Catholic school. On April 29, 1884, largely due to Dunne's efforts, St. Anthony Catholic School was officially established and began holding formal classes in the parish church. Dunne returned to All Saints Parish in Chicago later in 1884.\nBishop of Dallas\nOn September 24, 1893, Dunne was appointed the second bishop of Dallas by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on November 30, 1893, from Archbishop Patrick Feehan, with Bishops James Ryan and John Samuel Foley serving as co-consecrators, at All Saints Church in Chicago. He was installed in Dallas in January 1894.\nDuring his tenure, Dunne opened several educational institutions, including Holy Trinity College (today the University of Dallas). He established St. Paul Sanitarium in Dallas, and St. Anthony's Sanitarium, the first hospital in Amarillo. He also erected Sacred Heart Cathedral. During his sixteen years as bishop, the number of churches increased from 28 to 90, and the Catholic population tripled in size.\nDeath and legacy\nEdward Dunne died from a heart attack while visiting a friend in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on August 5, 1910, at age 62. At his brother's request, Dunne was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.\nReferences"
