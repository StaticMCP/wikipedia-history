The Republican ticket of the U.S. representative from Ohio's 19th congressional district James A. Garfield and the chair of the New York Republican Party Chester A. Arthur defeated the Democratic ticket of the major general Winfield S. Hancock and the former U.S. representative from Indiana's 2nd congressional district William H. English. Garfield defeated Hancock in the national election with 214 electoral votes.\nGeneral election\nSummary\nIndiana chose 15 electors on a statewide general ticket. Nineteenth-century election laws required voters to vote directly for members of the Electoral College rather than for president. This sometimes resulted in small differences in the number of votes cast for electors pledged to the same presidential candidate, if some voters did not vote for all the electors nominated by a party. This table reflects the statewide popular vote as calculated by Walter Dean Burnham in his influential study, Presidential Ballots, 1836–1892. Svend Petersen finds six more votes for Garfield, one fewer for Hancock, and 80 fewer for Weaver in Indiana.\n1.19}}\n}}\n1.74}}\n}}\n0.56}}\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Indiana\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
