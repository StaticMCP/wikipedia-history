The most important sanctuary is that  of Athena Alea, whose site can be visited 200 meters distant from the museum.\nThe museum houses collections from various sites, including Neolithic and Early Bronze Age items from Agiorgitika and Asea, objects from various sites at Tegea, including the temple of Alea Athena, and Early Christian and Byzantine objects from the Episkopi Tegeas.\nThe exhibits are structured into four inside galleries: 1. Neolithic to Early Bronze Age Archaic period, development of the Polis; 2. Arcadian Herms, private donations to sanctuaries discovered only in the region of Tegea; 3. Evolution of the polis from the Greek classical period to the Roman period; 4. The development of the sanctuary of Athena Alea. In addition, an outdoor exhibit, centered around “Public Life” and “The Hereafter” can be visited.\nGallery\nFile:Base of semicolumn of the Temple of Athena Alea, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017).jpg|Base of semicolumn of the Temple of Athena Alea\nFile:Epikranitis blocks (2) of the Temple of Athena Alea, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017).jpg|Epikranitis blocks\nFile:Epikranitis blocks of the Temple of Athena Alea, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017).jpg|Epikranitis blocks\nFile:Sima or gutter, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 1306).jpg|Sima or gutter\nFile:Gorgoneion from Alea, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 1311).jpg|Gorgoneion from Alea\nFile:Head of Asclepios (House at Stadio), Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 1277).jpg|Head of Asclepios\nFile:Head of Asclepios (Roman period), Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 24).jpg|Head of Asclepios\nFile:Head of Asclepios (undated), Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 25).jpg|Head of Asclepios\nFile:Inscribed stele with a sacred law, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 1261 alpha).jpg|Inscribed stele with a sacred law\nFile:Relief with a lion, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 4).jpg|Relief with a lion\nFile:Relief with an attacking lion, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 1).jpg|Relief with an attacking lion\nFile:Relief with Dionysos, Heracles and possibly Artemis, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 47).jpg|Relief with Dionysos, Heracles and possibly Artemis\nFile:Sarcophagus fragment of Achilles and Hector, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 3).jpg|Sarcophagus fragment of Achilles and Hector\nFile:Statue of Nike (Akroterion), Temple of Athena Alea, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 59).jpg|Statue of Nike (Akroterion)\nFile:Supplication of Priam (Troy), Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 144).jpg|Supplication of Priam\nFile:Mould for the production of a prototype of a helmet crest, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 151).jpg|Mould for helmet crests\nFile:Bronze pendants, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017).jpg|Bronze pendants\nFile:Seated bull bronze pendant, Archaeological Museum of Tegea (2017, exhibit 7).jpg|Seated bull bronze pendant\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.tegeamuseum.gr/ Official website]"
