The oldest is the Croonian Lecture, created in 1701 at the request of the widow of William Croone, one of the founding members of the Royal Society. The Croonian Lecture is still awarded on an annual basis, and is considered the most important Royal Society prize for the biological sciences. Although the Croonian Lecture was created in 1701, it was first awarded in 1738, seven years after the Copley Medal, which is the oldest Royal Society medal still in use and is awarded for \"outstanding achievements in research in any branch of science\".\nAwards\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Awards\n!Created\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Description\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Recent winners\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n|-\n|Armourers and Brasiers' Company Prize||align=center|1984||Awarded biennially \"for excellence in materials science and technology\" the Armourers and Brasiers' Company Prize is sponsored by the Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers and is accompanied by a £2000 gift. ||align=center|George Smith  2020||\n|-\n|GlaxoSmithKline Prize and Lecture||align=center|1976||Awarded biennially \"for original contributions to medical and veterinary sciences published within ten years from the date of the award\" the GlaxoSmithKline Prize and Lecture is both an award and a lecture, and is accompanied by a £2500 gift.
