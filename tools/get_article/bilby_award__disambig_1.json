The name of the award, BILBY, is an acronym of 'Books I Love Best Yearly'.\nThese awards are children's choice awards.  Each year Queensland children are asked to nominate their favourite book that they have read in the past year; only the winners from the previous two years are excluded from nomination.  The nominations are made in three readership categories (see below). The nomination process is the first phase of the awards.\nIn each category, around five of the most popularly nominated books are grouped into shortlists. In the second phase of the awards students are encouraged to read the books from the list in their readership category and vote for their favourite title.  The book receiving the most votes is declared the winner in its category.\nAward category and description\nPrior to 1997 there were three Awards categories for primary school readers – Read Alone, Read Aloud and Read Australian – and one category for Secondary. In 1997 a readership format was introduced, though the Early Readers category was first called the Picture Book category, then the Early Childhood category [see below].\nCurrently there are three categories:\n*Early Readers – for books for readers under 8 years old\n*Younger Readers – for books for readers between 8 and 12 years old\n*Older Readers – for books for readers over 12 years old.\nList of BILBY Award winners\nEarly Readers Award\nNote: Before 2001, this award was called the \"Early Childhood\" (1990–1999), \"Picture Book\" (1998–1997) and \"Read Alone\" (1996–1990) awards.\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Author\n!Book\n!Citation\n|- style=\"background:LemonChiffon; color:black\"\n|-\n| 1990\n|\n| Superfudge\n| Winner\n|-\n| 1991\n|\n|\n| Winner\n|-\n| 1992\n|\n| Unreal!\n| Winner\n|-\n| 1993\n|\n|\n| Winner\n|-\n| 1994\n|\n| Undone!\n| Winner\n|-\n| 1995\n|\n|\n| Winner\n|-\n| 1996\n|\n| ''Where's Wally?\n| Winner\n|-\n| 1997\n|\n| Bamboozled\n| Winner\n|-\n| 1998\n|\n|\n| Winner\n|-\n| 1999\n|\n| Gasp!\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2000\n|\n| Grandad's Teeth\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2001\n|\n| Where's Wally?\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2002\n|\n| Buffy – An Adventure Story\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2003\n|\n|\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2004\n|\n|\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2005\n|\n| Old Tom's Holiday\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2006\n|\n| Baby Boomsticks\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2007\n|\n| Ugly fish\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2008\n|\n| Diary of a Wombat\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2009\n|\n| The Twits\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2010\n|\n| Zac Power: Poison Island\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2011\n|\n| Dewey: There's a Cat in the Library!\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2012\n|\n| The Cat in the Hat\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2013\n|\n| Bamboozled\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2014\n|\n| Art & Max\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2015\n|\n| Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!\n| Winner\n|-\n| 2016\n|\n| The Book With No Pictures\n| Winner\n|-\n|2017\n|Aaron Blabey\n|Pig the Pug\n|Winner\n|-\n|2018\n|Andy Lee, illus.
