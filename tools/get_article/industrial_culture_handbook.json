Vale and Andrea Juno.  It features interviews and articles with Throbbing Gristle, Mark Pauline, Cabaret Voltaire, NON, Monte Cazazza, Sordide Sentimental, SPK, Z'EV, Johanna Went and Rhythm & Noise. The book was re-released in 2006 in a new hardback edition.\nIn his study on Throbbing Gristle's third album, Drew Daniel points out that the Handbook included extensive reference sections, which allowed the devotees to absorb the history of the bands and \"the network of industrial music and noise radiating outwards of it.\"\nReferences\n* RE/Search No. 6/7: Industrial Culture Handbook, RE/Search Publications 1983,\n* RE/Search No. 6/7: Industrial Culture Handbook, Limited Hardback Edition, RE/Search Publications 2006,\nCitations\nExternal links\n* [https://www.researchpubs.com/shop/p/research-67-industrial-culture-handbook Industrial Culture Handbook Page on RE/Search pubs]"
