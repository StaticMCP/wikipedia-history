      "text": "# John Edward Maurice Midgley\n\nJohn Edward Maurice Midgley (22 February 1935 – 9 December 2023) was a British scientist, biochemist and researcher in endocrinology. His main scientific focus was on molecular genetics, microbiology, the development of hormone assays and endocrine research. Midgley pioneered modern diagnostic methods for thyroid function.\nEarly life and education\nMidgley was born in Burley, West Yorkshire, being the only child of Edna (née Clarke) and Maurice Midgley. He received his primary education at Ilkley Grammar School and studied biochemistry at Leeds University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1958.\nSubsequently, he received a doctorate in physical chemistry at Exeter College, Oxford. His supervisor was the Nobel laureate Cyril Hinshelwood.\nAcademic and professional career\nFrom 1961 to 1962, Midgley was a fellow in molecular biology at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D. C. After having returned to Great Britain, he held a lectureship in biochemistry at Leeds University from 1962 to 1967. Subsequently, he took up the position of a lecturer and research fellow in biochemistry and molecular biology at Newcastle University, which he held from 1967 to 1975.\nIn 1975, he joined Amersham International, a manufacturer of medical products, in Buckinghamshire. There, he developed innovative one-step assay systems for the detection of free thyroid hormones in collaboration with Terry Wilkins. He gained multiple patents and, together with Terry Wilkins, received the Prince of Wales award for industrial innovation and production in 1985.\nFrom 1988 to 1998, he worked as a consultant for diagnostic methodologies, before he joined the Cochrane Collaboration as a Trials Abstractor (1999–2005).\nIn his later life, he worked in an international study group on the physiology and pathophysiology of thyroid diseases and homeostatic and allostatic mechanisms controlling the function of endocrine organs. Additionally, he devoted himself to advocacy for patients' rights.\nContributions to science and medicine\nMidgley's research significantly contributed to medical decision-making and the understanding of thyroid physiology. He authored or co-authored more than 100 peer-reviewed articles and had multiple patents. In 2018, he co-authored the book Homeostasis and Allostasis of Thyroid Function, which explores physiological and clinical aspects of the dynamic regulation of thyroid hormones. His numerous scientific articles addressed the interaction between thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), challenging conventional diagnostic approaches and advocating for more personalised patient care.\nDeath\nMidgley died at the age of 88 on December 9, 2023. His wife, Joan, died shortly after him.\nPublications\n;Books\n*\n;Selected articles\n* .\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n;Selected Patents\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* DNB dataset https://d-nb.info/gnd/1167461436\n* The Scottish Parliament.
