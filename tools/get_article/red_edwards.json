As a two-year starter, he led the team to a record of 7–2–1 in 1925, and 9–1 as a captain in 1926.\nEdwards served as an assistant football coached at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania for three season under Clem Crowe before succeeding him as head football coach in 1926. Edwards was later offered the head coaching position for the Pittsburgh Steelers by owner Art Rooney, but he declined. In 1956, he and his wife Sarah (née Brewster) returned to his home town of Weston to accept a position with Citizens Bank, where he eventually became chairman of the board of directors in 1968.\nEdwards was inducted into the West Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1970. He died on December 22, 1981, in Weston.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
