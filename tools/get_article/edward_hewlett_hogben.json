In partnership with the estate agent Alfred Craig, and then with the Goyder brothers, he played an influential role in the architectural development of both Katoomba and Leura between the wars. An early commission in 1905 was the design of the Kanowna guesthouses for John Connely in Wascoe Street, Leura. His most distinguished private home was the second Leuralla, built for Harry Andreas.\nHogben was born to Edward Hogben (1835–1891) and Jemima Henrietta (née Hewlett 1847–1918). His father was Mayor of Kogarah  Council (1887–1888). In 1889 Hogben commenced at Newington College under the presidency of the Rev Dr William Kelynack and the Headmastership of William Henry Williams.\nReferences"
