It is located at the end of Turner Ashby Lane in a small privately maintained park that is open to the public.  It consists of a granite shaft, its sides finished roughly except for the inscription panel, with a similarly cut pyramidal top.  It is set on a limestone base.  Its 1898 dedication ceremony was attended by 5,000 people, and typifies emblems of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.\nThe monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Harrisonburg, Virginia\nReferences"
