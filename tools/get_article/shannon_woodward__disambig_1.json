She played the role of Di Di Malloy, the teen daughter and middle child in an American family of Irish Travellers. After The Riches ended, Woodward played the role of Leah in the film The Haunting of Molly Hartley.\nWoodward shot the 2009 pilot Limelight, about a New York City school for performing arts, but the series was not picked up.
