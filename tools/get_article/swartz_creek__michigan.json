The population was 5,897 at the 2020 census. The city is a suburb of Flint and has incorporated land formerly within Flint Charter Township, Gaines Township, and Clayton Township, but is administratively autonomous from all three.\nHistory\nNative Americans traveled the trail that paralleled the Swartz Creek to reach the maple trees, on what would later be the\nCrapo Farm, to fish, gather fruit, and hunt. This trail terminated in the Lansing area.\nPredecessor communities\nMiller's Settlement\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|colspan=3 | Miller Settlement Population\n|-\n! Year !!

On March 11, 1837, just weeks after Michigan became a state, the southern area that would make up the community was placed into Mundy Township. Flushing Township was formed on March 6, 1838, split off from Flint Township, and included the northern part of the settlement. Two settlers were buried on the Miller property before that acre was deeded to Flushing township by Adam Miller.\nIn 1848, Miller Road was designed as a state road. in 1842, a post office was set up in the community called Swartz Creek after the stream. Soon, the community assumed that name. The Village of Swartz Creek subdivision was platted in 1877.\nIn 1881, Swartz Creek had a rail station called Hamilton. Serving the station was the Goodyear and Miller elevator and Western Union Telegraph. The locality also had a hotel run by William Brown, a Methodist church and a district school. The creek powered a saw mill and a flour mill at the time. Sommers & Brewer business was a manufacturer of potash.\nThe first Masonic Temple in the community was built in 1906 on Miller Road. By the 1910s, the unincorporated village's major industry was sugar beet farming with three beet weighing stations. An elevator and two churches were located there by 1916. A private bank, which was managed by Ira T. Sayre as part of a chain, was also open at that time.\nIn 1927, the community's downtown roads were paved with gravel supplied by the Crapo Gravel Company, which created the now Winchester Lake. Electrical power was brought to the area that same year.\nOn Wednesday April 7, 1954 at about 7:40 PM, a small tornado hit the community. The tornado destroyed the fire hall, knocking down power lines and taking roofs off homes while only injuring two.\nOtterburn\nOtterburn as the rest of Flint Township was in Grand Blanc Township at its organized on March 9, 1833, then split off into Flint Township on March 2, 1836, then with the west half of the survey area was place in Flushing Township. The first land purchase in section 31, the general area of Otterburn, was on May 30, 1836, by John W. McNair.\nOtterburn was in Flint Township, had about 150 residents and had its own train depot that opened in 1882.  The location was known as Otterburn as otters were generally seen there on the Swartz Creek, a burn. On August 27, 1887, Charles F. Shumway assumed the position of postmaster for the post office upon its opening. The post office closed on October 31, 1913. In 1957, a Chevrolet plant, which was also referred to as Otterburn, was built in this area for its service and parts operations moved from the west Flint Chevy in the Hole complex.\nWinchester developments\nCrapo Farm was sold in 1955 after parts were donated for St. Mary's Cemetery and Mary Crapo School. The Winchester Village subdivision was built on the former farm. Which was followed by another, Winchester Woods. All of the village and most of the woods were incorporated into the City of Swartz Creek in 1959 at its founding.\nCity\nIn the 1950s, GM executive started a \"New Flint\" regional/metropolitan government plan to incorporate the metropolitan area into Flint. The proposal was released in 1957 and petition began circulating the next year. Area residents were fearful that New Flint would bring the Otterburn plant into its borders. While New Flint proponents indicated this would not be the case, area residents campaigned against New Flint while moving to incorporate the area. The city was incorporated on December 1, 1959. The city included parts of Gaines (Winchester Village), Clayton and Flint Townships (Otterburn).\nIn 1986, Sports Creek Raceway opened. The raceway was a harness racing track.  The city received about $425,000 a year from wager dollars until 1993 when John Engler became Michigan governor. Engler reduced cash flow from the casinos for two years until a new distribution formula allowed the state to contribute less: from $126,000 to $118,000 by the mid-2000s.\nIn the 2000s, Gaines and Mundy Townships ceased contributions to cover building costs for the Swartz Creek Perkins Library, while Clayton Township ceased funding in 2011. In April 2011, the Flint Flames, a semi-professional Women's Blue Chip Basketball League team, changed ownership and its name to Flint Monarchs. The Monarchs then moved its games to the Cage Field House in Swartz Creek from its previous location at Flint Northern High School. In 2014, the Monarchs moved their games back to Flint.\nIn 2004, the city formed a downtown development authority. In 2006, Meijer announced plans to build a location in Swartz Creek. Construction started in September 2012, and on May 16, 2013, the store opened on Morrish Road north of I-69.\nIn December 2013, the city council voted 4 to 3 to adopt a 4.9-mil public safety special assessment district consisting of the whole city. While a referendum petition could take the assessment to the ballot, some city residents threatened to recall members of city council who supported the millage. In January and February 2014, the city and Gaines Township were contacted by Mundy Township Supervisor David L. Guigear with the intent of  regionalizing their building departments, code enforcement activities, janitorial services and police departments.\nAlso in December 2013, City Manager Paul Bueche, who was preparing for medical and disability leave, recommended the promotion of Adam Zettel, the current city zoning administrator and DDA Director, as interim City Manager. Zettel was also assistant city manager for the city of Owosso and former assistant city manager for the city from 2006 to 2010. The city council accepted Bueche's recommendation and hired Zettel effective January 1, 2014. Bueche died on May 15, 2014.\nSport Creek Raceway was closed by the Michigan Gaming Control Board on January 1, 2015, as the raceway could not agree to terms with the Michigan Harness Horsemen's Association. As of 2023, despite being under new ownership, there continue to be no plans to reopen the track.\nA 5.7-mil property-tax levy for streets was placed on the May 5, 2015 ballot. The city proposal failed 729 to 831. On May 3, 2016, a smaller, 4.22-mil property-tax levy for street improvements was finally approved by city residents.\nFourth-precinct council member Michael Shumaker died on March 2, 2016, with his appointed temporary replacement being Jim Florence. A council member considered the city charter to have conflicting provisions thus bring into question an interim election in November. After 34 years of council service, Richard B. Abrams, last serving as mayor pro tem and prior mayor, did not seek reelection in November 2016.\nOn January 9, 2016, the Swartz Creek City Council voted to disband its police department by merging the department with Mundy Township's into the Metro Police Authority of Genesee County effective February 1, 2017. On October 1, 2019, the city turned over the operation of the city's parking violations bureau to the Metro Police Authority. Swartz Creek began receiving Karegnondi Water Authority water treated by Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division on December 15, 2017.\nBy January 2022, Swartz Creek Community Schools completed a series of renovations on both schools within the city limits, in addition to the satellite elementary schools. A new, updated football field was completed in 2019, four years after the completion of the Swartz Creek Performing Arts Center. A new STEM wing was constructed at the high school, while the middle school continues to undergo construction to allow for STEM classrooms and performing arts facilities.\nGovernment\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\"\n|-\n!
