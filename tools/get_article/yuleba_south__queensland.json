In the , Yuleba South had a population of 21 people.\nGeography\nThe Warrego Highway and the Western railway line run immediately parallel along two sections of the northern boundary, entering initially from the north-east (Yuleba North / Jackson South) and then exiting to Yuleba and then re-entering and exiting to the north-west (Wallumbilla North / Wallumbilla South).\nThe Yuleba Surat Road enters the locality from the north (Yuleba) and travels south, forming part of the western boundary with Wallumbilla South, before exiting to the south (Warkon).\nThere are two sections of the Yuleba State Forest in the locality, one in the centre of the locality and the other in the north-east of the locality extending into neighbouring Jackson South and beyond. Apart from these protected areas, the land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation with a small amount of crop growing.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from the town of Yuleba, which was a name given in 1865 to a settlement on Yuleba Creek, but which in October 1879 was moved to the railway crossing on Yuleba Creek.\nDemographics\nIn the , Yuleba South had a population of 27 people.\nIn the , Yuleba South had a population of 21 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Yuleba.

The nearest government secondary schools are Wallumbilla State School (to Year 10) in Wallumbilla to the north-west. The nearest government school offering secondary education to Year 12 is Roma State College in Roma to the west, but it would be too distant for most students in Yuleba South to attend; the alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
