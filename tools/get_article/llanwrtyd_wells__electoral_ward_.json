It covers three local government communities and elects a councillor to Powys County Council.\nDescription\nThe Llanwrtyd Wells ward covers the sparsely populated communities of Llanwrtyd Wells, Llangamarch and part of Treflys, including the small town of Llanwrtyd Wells and the villages of Llangammarch Wells and Beulah. Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire border the ward to the west. The Powys ward of Llanafanfawr with Garth borders to the east, with Maescar/Llywel and Yscir with Honddu Isaf and Llanddew to the south.\nAccording to the 2011 UK Census the population of the ward was 1,875.\nFollowing a boundary review to improve electoral parity, the Treflys community ward of Garth was transferred to Llanafanfawr, effective from the 2022 local elections.\nCounty elections\nSince the May 1995 local government election, it has been represented by one county councillor on Powys County Council. Councillor Tim Van Rees, an Independent, has represented the ward throughout this period. He is a previous chairman of the county council.
