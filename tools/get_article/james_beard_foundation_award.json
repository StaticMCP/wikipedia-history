The James Beard Foundation Awards have been likened to the Academy Awards of the food world due to its prestige and recognition.\nThe awards are voted on by more than 600 culinary professionals, including previous award winners. Recipients receive a medallion etched with the image of James Beard and a certificate from the foundation.\nAwards ceremonies\nThe James Beard Foundation Award was officially established in 1990 through a merger with ''Who's Who of American Cooking and French's Food and Beverage Book Awards from Cook's Magazine (the predecessor to Cook's Illustrated''). In addition to the chef, restaurant, and book awards, journalism awards were added in 1993, which expanded to broadcast media in 1994, and restaurant design awards were first given in 1995.\nThe first award ceremony took place in 1991, with ceremonies following every year until 2020, when the chef and restaurant awards (for 2019) were canceled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the book and media awards were announced online on May 27, 2020. A virtual event was broadcast from Chicago on September 25, 2020.  In August 2020, the James Beard Foundation announced that no awards for a 2020 ceremony (held in 2021) would be given. Award ceremonies fully resumed in 2022.\nThe award ceremonies are usually scheduled around James Beard's May 5 birthday. The media awards are presented at a dinner in New York City; the chef and restaurant awards were also presented in New York until 2015, when the foundation's annual gala moved to Chicago. Chicago will continue to host the Awards until 2027.\nChanges\nIn 2018, the James Beard Foundation changed the award's rules to be more inclusive, to fight race and gender imbalances in the industry. Changes include judges reflecting the demographics of the United States, retiring the Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America awards (which were judged by previous winners), adding leadership awards which focus on social justice issues, in addition to waiving some media entry fees.\nWho's Who of Food and Beverage in America\nThe \"Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America\" was an award that was given from 1991-2018. It was presented to members of the food and beverage industry who have been \"identified by his or her peers as having displayed remarkable talent and achievement.\" The Who's Who awards were voted on by past honorees, with a ballot of 20 candidates distributed to the entire Who's Who group each year.\nThe honors were initially awarded by ''Cook's Magazine (the predecessor to Cook's Illustrated''), which inaugurated the award in 1984 but ceased publication in 1990. The award was administered by the James Beard Foundation from 1990 to 2018 and presented at the annual gala. The foundation decided to retire the awards after 2018, citing a new commitment to inclusion. Including the inductees from the 1980s, the final Who's Who list included nearly 300 individuals.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Who's Who list by year\n!Year\n!Inductees\n!Ref\n|-\n|1991\n|David Bouley, Ken Hom, Bryan Miller, Michel Richard, Nancy Silverton\n|\n|-\n|1992\n|Albert Kumin, Julee Rosso, Sheila Lukins, Drew Nieporent, Jane and Michael Stern, Patricia Wells\n|\n|-\n|1993\n|Ariane and Michael Batterberry, Gael Greene, Robert M.
