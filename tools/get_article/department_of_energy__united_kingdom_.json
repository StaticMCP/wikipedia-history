The department was established in January 1974, when the responsibility for energy production was transferred away from the Department of Trade and Industry in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis and with the importance of North Sea oil increasing.\nFollowing the privatisation of the energy industries in the United Kingdom, which had begun some ten years earlier, the department was abolished in 1992. Many of its functions were abandoned, with the remainder being absorbed into other bodies or departments. The Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas) and the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER) took over market regulation, the Energy Efficiency Office was transferred to the Department of the Environment, and various media-related functions were transferred to the Department of National Heritage. The core activities relating to UK energy policy were transferred back to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).\nThe Department of Energy was a significant source of funding for energy research, and for investigations into the potential for renewable energy technologies in the UK. Work funded or part-funded by the department included investigations into Geothermal power and the Severn Barrage\nMinisters\nSecretary of State for Energy\nColour key (for political parties):\nPoliticians:\n|Conservative|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Labour|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|Name\n! colspan=2|Term of office\n!

The Ministry of Fuel and Power was created on 11 June 1942 from functions separated from the Board of Trade.  It took charge of coal production, allocation of supplies of fuels, control of energy prices and petrol rationing during World War II.\nThe Ministry of Fuel and Power was renamed the Ministry of Power in January 1957.  The Ministry of Power later became part of the Ministry of Technology on 6 October 1969, which merged into the Department of Trade and Industry on 20 October 1970.\nThe post of Secretary of State for Energy was re-created in 2008 as the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change.\nSee also\n*Energy use and conservation in the United Kingdom\n*Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090609003228/http://www.berr.gov.uk/aboutus/corporate/history/outlines/The%20Department%20of%20Energy%201974%20-%201992/page24456.html   History of the Department of Energy]"
