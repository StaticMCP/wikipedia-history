One of its remaining columns, under commander Anselmo Cañete, was engaged by a Brazilian force twice its size and defeated, losing its two guns and many of its men in the process.\nBackground and engagement\nAfter the Pikysyry campaign, which had for all means and purposes left Paraguay without a standing army, the country lacked the means to fight a regular war. A new army was hastily rebuilt in the interior of the country, with many boys and teenagers amongst its ranks, badly equipped. When operations resumed some months after Paraguayan capital Asunción was captured, this army would soon prove to be no match to those of the allies. It was dealt bloody defeats around the new Paraguayan capital of Piribebuy, in Piribebuy itself and in Acosta Ñu.\nSome Paraguayan units were able to escape the latter combat, as did the Paraguayan president, Francisco Solano López. Also operational was a column of 1000 men under commander Anselmo Cañete near Concepción, in the north of the country. A month after Acosta Ñu, it was engaged by a Brazilian force twice its size; it managed to avoid confrontation briefly, on the 19th of September, by using two squadrons of cavalry to delay the enemy, which did so and withdrew. On the same day, however, the Brazilians still were able to reach the place where the column's main body was encamped, Itapytanguá, and attack it successfully. Cañete and some of his men managed to withdraw to a place called Sanguinacué. His two guns and some 1500 heads of cattle were captured, as were many Brazilian and Paraguayan families.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
