During the night, Byzantine troops scaled the opposite side of the slope without being noticed and launched an attack from both sides at dawn, catching the Berbers off guard. The Byzantines routed the rebels, reportedly killing or wounding nearly all their fighters and forcing the remaining leaders to flee into the Berber Kingdom of Arris. It marked the end of the first stage of the Berber revolt.\nPerlude\nByzantine General Belisarius after his victory in the Vandalic War in Africa had to return back to Constantinople to deal with rumors against him in the royal court of Justinian I. Belisarius anticipated that the Berbers, who had remained quiet largely out of fear of him, would revolt upon his departure. He placed most of his bucellarii under Solomon's command and instructed him to put down the rebellion. The Berbers rebelled on the news of Belisarius' departure.\nThe Berbers invaded Byzacena and defeated the local Byzantine garrison, ambushing and killing its commanders, Aigan and Rufinus the Thracian, which damaged the morale of the Byzantine troops. After diplomatic entreaties over the winter failed, and with his forces bolstered to some 18,000 men following the arrival of reinforcements, in spring 535 Solomon led his troops into Byzacena. In early 535, Solomon defeated the Berber rebels, under their chiefs Cutzinas, Esdilasas, Iourphouthes and Mesidinissas, in the Battle of Mammes. The Berbers retreated, and regrouped at Mount Bourgaon, while the Byzantines sought to put an end to the revolt.\nBattle\nThe Berbers encamped on the mountain's foothills, having a defensive advantage over the Byzantines. The Berbers, not expecting the Byzantines to actually try and overtake them from the east that had a steep slope, concentrated all their forces on the west, where there was a gentle slope. Solomon's army camped in the valley, expecting the Berbers to descent and engage him in the open, but the Berbers refused to be drawn out.\nAt first, the Byzantine troops lost morale when confronted by their numerically superior enemy. After a speech by Solomon, the troops gained their morale back and prepared for the fight. Solomon sent his commander, Theodorus, with about 1,000 excubitors to climb the eastern side of the mountain. He did not tell this to his own troops to avoid being betrayed. The excubitors climbed up the mountain during the night without being noticed.\nAt dawn, Solomon advanced his forces to the mountain's outskirts, while Theodorus's troops emerged on the opposite side, encircling the Berbers. Both detachments struck the Berbers with volleys of arrows, causing them to panic and try to flee, but they had no route of escape. The few that survived did so by trampling over the dead bodies of their comrades, and nearly all of the Berber warriors were caught, killed, or wounded. All of the Berber chieftains were able to flee except for Esdilasas, who was caught, and taken prisoner. According to Procopius, the Berbers suffered 50,000 casualties, while the Romans suffered none.\nAftermath\nSurviving Berber soldiers retreated into Numidia where they joined forces with Iabdas, King of the Aurès. Masuna, King of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom and allied with the Byzantines, and another Berber king, Ortaias (who ruled a kingdom in the former province of Mauretania Sitifensis), urged Solomon to pursue the enemy Berbers into Numidia, which he did. Solomon did not engage Iabdas in battle, distrusting the loyalty of his allies, and instead constructed a series of fortified posts along the roads linking Byzacena with Numidia. In 536, Emperor Justinian considered that peace had been established in the region.\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nSources\nPrimary\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*  }}\nSecondary\n*  }}\n*\n*  }}\n*  }}\n*\n*  }}\n*"
