The United Kingdom declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November 1914 and annexed Cyprus. Turkey recognised British possession of Cyprus by the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923 and the island became a Crown colony on 10 March 1925. Following the Zürich and London Agreement of 19 February 1959, Cyprus became independent on 16 August 1960. The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the British Commonwealth, so the British diplomatic representative is a high commissioner.\nHeads of mission\nHigh commissioners (1878–1925)\n*1878–1879: Sir Garnet Wolseley\n*1879–1886: Sir Robert Biddulph\n*1886–1892: Sir Henry Ernest Bulwer\n*1892–1898: Sir Walter Sendall\n*1898–1904: Sir William Haynes Smith\n*1904–1911: Sir Charles King-Harman\n*1911–1915: Hamilton Goold-Adams\n*1915–1918: Sir John Clauson (died in office)\n*1918–1920: Sir Malcolm Stevenson (acting)\n*1920–1925: Sir Malcolm Stevenson\nGovernors (1925–1960)\n*1925–1926: Sir Malcolm Stevenson\n*1926–1932: Sir Ronald Storrs\n*1932–1933: Sir Reginald Stubbs\n*1933–1939: Sir Richmond Palmer\n*1939–1941: William Battershill\n*1941–1946: Charles Woolley\n*1946–1949: Reginald Fletcher, 1st Baron Winster\n*1949–1954: Sir Andrew Wright\n*1954–1955: Sir Robert Armitage\n*1955–1957: Sir John Harding\n*1957–1960: Sir Hugh Foot\nHigh commissioners (1960–present)\nSource:\n*1961–1964: Sir Arthur Clark\n*1964–1965: Sir Alec Bishop\n*1965–1967: Sir David Hunt\n*1967–1969: Sir Norman Costar\n*1969–1971: Peter Ramsbotham\n*1971–1972: Robert Edmonds\n*1973–1975: Stephen Olver\n*1975–1979: Donald Gordon\n*1979–1982: Peregrine Rhodes\n*1982–1988: William Wilberforce\n*1988–1990: Humphrey Maud\n*1990–1994: David Dain\n*1994–1999: David Madden\n*1999–2001: Edward Clay\n*2001–2005: Lyn Parker\n*2005–2010: Peter Millett\n*2010–2014: Matthew Kidd\n*2014–2016: Ric Todd\n*2016–2018: Matthew Kidd\n*2018–2022: Stephen Lillie\n*2022–2024: Irfan Siddiq\n*2024–present: Michael Tatham\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gov.uk/government/world/cyprus UK and Cyprus], gov.uk"
