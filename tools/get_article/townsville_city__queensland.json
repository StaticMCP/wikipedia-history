In the , the suburb of Townsville City had a population of 2,945 people.\nIt is the city's central business district and a major hub for businesses of all sectors in the Northern Australia region.\nGeography\nTownsville City is a strip of land along the northern-eastern bank of Ross Creek at its mouth at the Coral Sea, thus the suburb is bounded to the north by the Coral Sea and to the south-east by Ross Creek. It is overlooked to the west by Castle Hill. The land is mostly low-lying, just about sea level, apart from Melton Hill () which creates a natural boundary to North Ward to the north-west.\nNorth Ward Road (Denham Street) runs through from north to south-east.\nHistory\nTownsville City is situated in the traditional Wulgurukaba Aboriginal country.\nTownsville City takes its name from Robert Towns, a merchant and entrepreneur, who was a pioneer financial supporter of pastoral development around the Ross River area.\nServices of worship for members of the Baptist Church commenced in Townsville in January 1888 in rented premises. In 1891 the Townsville Baptist Church bought the land and two cottages (at the rear of the allotment) from the original landholder, Duncan McVean, for £500. At the time the allotment took up one half of the length of Fletcher Street between Sturt and Walker streets (). In September 1893, a vacant Congregationalist church building in Denham Street and its contents were purchased and re-erected on the Sturt Street site. The first service was held on Thursday 23 November 1893. In January 1903 the building was damaged by Cyclone Leonta. What could be salvaged was used to erect a church hall. A building fund was set up for a new church and hall, but it was not until 1922 that a replacement church was built. Having insufficient funds for new bricks, a disused powder magazine, eight miles from Townsville at Brookhill and purchased and the congregation dismantled and cleaned around 30,000 bricks. In December 1921, tenders were called to erect a new brick church adjacent to the former church. The building contract was signed for £832/6/- and the foundation stone was laid on 8 July 1922. The new church opened on Saturday 23 September 1922. In 1981, the land and buildings were sold because the Townsville City Baptist Church and the Currajong Baptist Church were both too small, so the congregations decided to combine and bought a new property at Kirwan.\nSt Anne's Church of England Girls’ School opened on 1 January 1917 with an initial enrolment of 71 students in Walker Street (now occupied by the Townsville City Council centre, approx ).

In 1953, the need for expand results in the purchase of  of land in Mundingburra, where the foundation stone was laid in 1956. The Mundingburra site was officially opened on 13 April 1958 with the move to the new site taking place at the end of August 1958. Still Anglican, it is now a co-educational school known as the Cathedral School of St Anne and St James.\nTownsville State High School opened on 7 July 1924 in the Townsville Technical College in the Townsville CBD on the corner of Walker and Stanley Streets. The school had an initial enrolment of 55 students and eight staff. In 1954, there were 369 students. Lacking space to expand at the technical college, a new site was opened in 1964 in Boundary Street in Railway Estate with an intake of new Year 8 students while the existing students at the technical college transitioned to the new site in 1965.\nDemographics\nIn the , the suburb of Townsville City had a population of 2,500 people.\nIn the , the suburb of Townsville City had a population of 2,910 people.\nIn the , the suburb of Townsville City had a population of 2,945 people.\nBuilt environment\nThe dominant land use in the Townsville CBD (Central Business District) is commercial but with a growing residential aspect.
