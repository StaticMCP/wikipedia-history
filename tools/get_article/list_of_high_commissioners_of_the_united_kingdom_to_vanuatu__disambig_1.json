Thus, the countries exchange high commissioners rather than ambassadors.\nHistory\nIn 2005 the British Government closed its high commission in Port Vila. During this time British interests in Vanuatu were represented by the British high commissioner to Solomon Islands who was also accredited as high commissioner to Vanuatu. The British high commission in Port Vila reopened in summer 2019 with a resident high commissioner.\nList of heads of mission\nHigh commissioners to Vanuatu\n*1980–1982: William Ashford\n*1982–1985: Richard Dorman\n*1985–1988: Malcolm Lars Creek LVO OBE\n*1988–1992: John Thompson\n*1992–1995: Thomas Duggin\n*1995–1997: James Daly\n*1997–2000: Malcolm Geoffrey Hilson OBE\n*2000–2005: Michael Hill\n*2006–2009: Roger Sykes (non-resident)\n*2009–2011: Malcolm McLachlan (non-resident)\n*2011–2012: Timothy Smart (acting, non-resident)\n*2012–2013: Martin Fidler (acting, non-resident)\n*2013–2016: Dominic Meiklejohn (non-resident)\n*2016–2019: David Ward (non-resident)\n*2019–2022: Karen Bell\n*2022–present: Nicolette Brent\nReferences"
