      "text": "# Caribbean-American Heritage Month\n\nCaribbean-American Heritage Month is celebrated by proclamation of the President and Congress in the United States in June to honor the achievements and contributions of Caribbean immigrants and their descendants living in the United States, particularly in government, sports, entertainment, and the arts. Events are held throughout the month celebrating and educating the public about Caribbean-American history and culture.\nThe heritage month was first officially observed in 2006, after being unanimously adopted by the House of Representatives on June 27, 2005 in H. Con. Res. 71, sponsored by Congresswoman Barbara Lee, recognizing the significance of Caribbean people and their descendants in the history and culture of the United States.\nThe Senate adopted the resolution on February 14, 2006, which was introduced by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.\nOn June 5, 2006, George W. Bush issued a presidential proclamation declaring that June be annually recognized as National Caribbean American Heritage Month to celebrate the contributions of Caribbean Americans (both naturalized and US citizens by birth) in the United States. Since the declaration, the White House has issued an annual proclamation recognizing June as National Caribbean-American Heritage Month.\nGeorge W.
