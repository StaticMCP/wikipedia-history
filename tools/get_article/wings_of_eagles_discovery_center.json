The center traces its origins to the National Warplane Museum, founded in 1984 in Geneseo, New York, by a group of aviation enthusiasts dedicated to preserving the history and heritage of World War II aircraft.\nThe National Warplane Museum was recognized by the New York State Department of Education as a flying museum. Its flagship aircraft was the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress “Fuddy Duddy,” which toured during the flying season and offered flight experiences to the public. The museum also hosted the annual Wings of Eagles Airshow, a major event featuring numerous historic military aircraft.\nIn the mid-1990s, the museum's Board of Trustees sought a larger venue and selected Chemung County as its new location. The museum subsequently relocated to the Elmira Corning Regional Airport to gain greater visibility. However, evolving Federal Aviation Regulations related to airshows and passenger flights on vintage aircraft made the original business model unsustainable.\nAmong its exhibits, the Mars Base Eagle installation highlights human space exploration and the challenges of sustaining life on Mars. The center's focus on aerospace and space science education aligns with its goal of preparing youth for careers in technology and innovation.\nIn 2012, the Wings of Eagles Discovery Center completed the relocation of its aircraft and exhibits from storage at the Elmira Corning Regional Airport to a newly renovated facility on Daniel Zenker Drive in Big Flats, New York. The move included a collection of historic aircraft—ranging from fighter jets to bombers—representing over six decades of aviation history, according to museum communications director Stacey Brown.\nThe aircraft are now displayed in the main exhibition hangar, a converted horse arena repurposed for museum use. The new facility also includes classroom spaces dedicated to STEM education programs, offered in partnership with Greater Southern Tier BOCES and local schools.\nThe organization originally opened at the airport in 1984 under the name National Warplane Museum. It was renamed the Wings of Eagles Discovery Center in 2006, reflecting a broader focus on aviation and aerospace education. In 2010, the museum's original airport facility was sold to Sikorsky Aircraft, after which the museum operated from temporary quarters until its new site was completed.\nAircraft on display\n* Bell UH-1H Iroquois (69-16723)\n* Douglas B-26B Invader (41-39516)\n* Fairchild Republic A-10A Thunderbolt II (75-0293)\n* Grumman TBM-3E Avenger (91752)\n* Grumman F-14A Tomcat (161605)\n* Grumman OV-1C Mohawk (62-5856)\n* Hughes OH-6A Cayuse (67-16576)\n* LTV A-7D Corsair II (69-6200)\n* Martin RB-57A Canberra (52-1459)\n* McDonnell Douglas F-4B Phantom II (152256)\n* McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle (75-0026)\n* AGM-28 Hound Dog (60-2971)\n* Piper J-4A Cub Coupe\n* RLU-1 Breezy\n* Schweizer LNS-1 (N53275)\n* Westland Whirlwind HAR-10 (helicopter) (XJ763)\nSource: Wings of Eagles\nGallery\nReferences"
