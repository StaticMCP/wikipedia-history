      "text": "# National Union for Democracy in Iran\n\nThe National Union for Democracy in Iran (NUFDI; is a non-profit, non-partisan political advocacy organization of the Iranian diaspora based in the United States. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., it promotes the voices of Iranian-Americans who support secular democracy and human rights in Iran. NUFDI is opposed to the Islamic Republic and advocates for democratic regime change in Iran.\nHistory\nNUFDI was established in 2003 in Los Angeles by Iranian-American dissidents and was later registered as a 501(c)(4) organization in 2014. Initially volunteer-run, the organization expanded its staffing and policy presence in Washington by the late 2010s.\nIn 2018, NUFDI drew attention for publicly supporting Iranian protest movements. Spokesperson Bijan Farhoudi stated that the goal of the people was \"democracy, freedom, and a secular and modern government.\"\nFollowing the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests, NUFDI supported the movement by organizing rallies, policy briefings, and legal actions. It played a supporting role in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. against Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi under the Torture Victim Protection Act.\nMission\nNUFDI’s mission is to advocate for a free, democratic, and secular Iran through community engagement and influencing U.S. policy. The organization supports policies that apply diplomatic and economic pressure on the Iranian regime and favors solidarity with Iranian civil society.\nActivities\nNUFDI organizes policy roundtables, conferences, and public education campaigns. It has hosted forums featuring prominent figures such as Reza Pahlavi and former U.S. diplomats. In 2024, NUFDI supported the bipartisan MAHSA Act, which aimed to sanction human rights abusers in Iran.\nNUFDI also engages in legal advocacy, public campaigns for the release of political prisoners, and lobbying for U.S. foreign policy that centers human rights in Iran. Its events include the annual \"Iran Conference,\" which convenes policymakers and activists.\nLeadership\nNUFDI is led by an executive team and board of directors composed of Iranian-American professionals and dissidents. Its political director is Cameron Khansarinia, who frequently represents the organization in media and policy events. Other notable affiliates include human rights attorney Shahin Milani and former RAND analyst Alireza Nader.\nReception\nNUFDI has been praised by segments of the Iranian opposition, including Reza Pahlavi, for its advocacy work in Washington. Critics have accused the organization of having a confrontational approach and aligning with hawkish U.S. foreign policy views. NUFDI has denied claims of political partisanship and describes itself as representing a broad spectrum of pro-democracy Iranian voices.\nSee also\n* Iranian Americans\n* Politics of Iran\n* Human rights in Iran\n* Reza Pahlavi\n* NIAC\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nufdiran.org Official website]"
