This event, known as the Gawkadal massacre, intensified public outrage and led to widespread protests across the region.\nMassacre\nOn 25 January 1990, thousands of residents gathered in Handwara to protest the Gawkadal massacre and demand accountability for massacre which had occurred four days earlier. The protesters, chanting slogans and waving placards, marched through the town. As the procession approached the Handwara Police Station, a Tata Matador (407) carrying BSF personnel arrived at the scene.\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the BSF personnel opened fire indiscriminately into the crowd without any warning. The shooting resulted in the immediate deaths of 21 civilians and left over 75 others injured. The victims included women and children, with several eyewitnesses described the scene as chaotic and harrowing, with bodies lying on the ground and survivors scrambling to escape the gunfire.\nReferences"
