According to Spyridon Trikoupis, it was believed by the Turks that the destruction of Vervena would seriously damage Greek morale.\nDuring the night of 17–18 May, an Ottoman force of six thousand men and two cannons marched from Tripoli to Vervena. The Turkish plan would only succeed if the Ottoman army could pass Doliana where Nikitaras, a leader of the Greek revolutionaries, was positioned with approximately two hundred men. By the time the Ottomans reached Doliana, Nikitaras had established a fortified position utilizing ordinary houses. When the Turks arrived they were surprised by the Greeks and panicked. Meanwhile at Vervena, when a portion of the Ottoman army arrived it was forced to quickly retreat because the Greek revolutionaries had realized the impending danger and prepared for an attack by taking positions to flank the Turks. Due to the number of casualties, Mustafa Bey and the Turks retreated. The Greeks followed the Turks as they withdrew and continued to pursue their fleeing enemy to Tripoli.\nAccording to the Greek General Kolokotronis, the Ottomans lost seventy men and abandoned their cannons and materials on the battlefield. Nikitaras, who had up to that point lived in the shadow of General Kolokotronis, earned a reputation and nickname () for himself. A legend of the time reported that after the battle of Doliana, Nikitaras' sword got stuck to his hand and could not be removed.\nSignificance\nThe victorious Battle of Doliana was a big morale boost for the Greek revolutionaries. It marked the last time that the besieged Ottoman army left Tripoli and opened the way for the fall of the city and the firm establishment of the independence movement in the Peloponnese.\nSee also\n*\n* Ano Doliana\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*"
