Maggs Composition Award is a commission-based Australian classical composition award given in order to \"encourage and assist composers who might otherwise abandon their efforts for want of means\".\nThe award was founded in 1966 by Albert H. Maggs, a Melbourne-based professional bookmaker, amateur pianist and patron of the arts and medicine.  He initially provided $10,000, and made later contributions to keep the award viable.\nThe only qualification is that applicants must have resided in Australia for at least two years before the closing date for applications, in March.  It is administered by the University of Melbourne and is awarded annually in August.\nThe winner agrees to submit their work within 18 months of the award being made.  The current value of the award is $7,000 with another $3,000 as a performance subsidy.\nList of winners\nThe following composers have been awarded the Albert H.
