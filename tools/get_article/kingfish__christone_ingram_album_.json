His first album, it was released on May 17, 2019, in CD, LP, and digital formats.\nFor the 2020 Grammys, Kingfish was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album.\nCritical reception\nOn AllMusic, Thom Jurek wrote, \"At the ripe old age of 20, Clarksdale, Mississippi guitar slinger Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram has been anointed \"the next explosion of the blues,\" by no less than Buddy Guy. The proclamation is accurate.... The bottom line is that Ingram arrives fully formed as an already authoritative presence on Kingfish, all revved up and ready to. This is as promising as a debut album gets.\"\nOn NPR, Tom Moon said, \"This emphasis on crisp execution makes literally every Ingram solo on the album a dramatic event. On the up-tempo stuff, he tears through blistering lines with the easygoing assurance of a road-dog veteran. Then when it's slow-blues time, he makes the guitar moan...\"\nIn Blues Blast Magazine, Steve Jones wrote, \"Many of the live shows and songs I’ve seen Kingfish do are really wild and have some over the top guitar here and there. The work here is much more restrained and yet is equally enjoyable (if not better).... It really is a great CD and Kingfish Ingram really has grown up to become a superb bluesman. I recommend this one highly!\"\n}}"
