Compared to hot shrinking, cold shrinking is a longer but nevertheless more preferred method most common especially with larger stretching areas. Cold shrinking is mostly done by use of a dolly hammer. The resulting rough surface is filled using a body filler or a body solder for a smoother finish.\nCold shrinking is a method of panel beating where heating is not done to the stretched panel. This method is mostly suitable for integral cars with integral body panels such as hatchbacks.\nSee also\n* Hot shrinking\n* Panel beater\nReferences"
