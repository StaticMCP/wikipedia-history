All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1988 United States presidential election. Alaska voters chose three electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nAlaska was won by incumbent United States Vice President George H. W. Bush of Texas, who was running against Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Bush ran with Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as vice president, and Dukakis ran with Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen.\nBush won the election in Alaska with a resounding 23 point sweep-out landslide. Alaska has sent Republican electors to the Electoral College during every election in its history – except in 1964, where electors were sent for Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson.\nThe election was rather multi-partisan for Alaska, with nearly 5% of the votes going to third-party candidates. Leading the third-party turnout in Alaska, and with one of their best turnouts nationwide, Texas Congressman Ron Paul with running-mate and Alaska Legislator Andre Marrou were able to pull nearly 3% of votes in the state on the Libertarian Party ticket.\nAlaska weighed in for this election as 16% more Republican than the national average.\nCampaign\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Rating\n!As of\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |The Cook Political Report\n|\n|September 24, 1988\n|}\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1988 United States presidential election in Alaska\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f33; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| George H.
