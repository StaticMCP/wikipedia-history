It is also referred to as The Almonry Museum and just The Almonry. It is governed by Evesham Town Council. The focus of the museum is on the history of the town and Vale of Evesham. The museum derives its name from the original use of the building as the almonry of the 14th-century Evesham Abbey The museum opened within this building in 1957.\nHistory\nThe Almonry Museum is housed in a 14th-century building that was formerly part of the Benedictine Evesham Abbey, the third largest abbey in England. The building is an almonry, meaning it was the home of the almoner, a monk whose role was to provide alms to the poor. Evesham Abbey was closed by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, after which the Almonry became the personal home of the last Abbot, Philip Ballard. Two churches, a bell tower and a cloister arch from Evesham Abbey also survive nearby. The Almonry is a grade I listed building and was first listed in 1952. It has a part rubble and part timber-framed structure with a Cotswold stone roof. Additions to the building were made in the 15th and 17th centuries.\nFollowing the closure of the Abbey, The Almonry has served as an ale house, offices, tea rooms and a private home. It was purchased by Evesham Borough Council in 1929 and opened as a heritage centre in 1957.\nCollections and exhibitions\nin 1855 and later given by Queen Victoria to the town of Evesham.
