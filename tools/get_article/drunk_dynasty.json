The album was entirely fan funded through PledgeMusic, and the band provided regular updates to pledgers throughout the making of the album. It is the final studio album to feature bass guitarist Erik Chandler before his official departure on January 12, 2019.\nProduction and recording\nOn May 11, 2016, the band announced they have launched a new campaign project again using the fan funded PledgeMusic to record an EP. The campaign reached its goal on May 20. The next day, Reddick presented the new album cover illustrated by Dave Pearson of the band Lacey. In June, the band would enter the studio in Denton, Texas. Day one in the recording studio, \"two songs done on drums and rhythm guitar...one on bass. We start tomorrow with two more...\"\nThe first titled song, \"Shit to Do\", was announced on June 7 and that Chandler was recording bass to it. Later that day, a second song title was given with a video clip of Wiseman recording \"She Used to Be Mine\". A third update with a new song and a video clip showed Burney recording \"Go to Bed Mad\". Wiseman began tracking drums on June 8 for \"Don't Be a Dick\" and Reddick would also show a short audio clip of the song's drums, bass and rhythm guitar for the first verse. On June 9, they were tracking \"Beer on a Sunday\" which Reddick said \"We did this one totally live!\".\nIn July, vocals would be recorded, and on July 8, an update from Reddick stated, \"I am super happy to announce that instead of an EP, Drunk Dynasty will be a FULL album!\" and that three more songs would be recorded next month. In August, the band would go to Los Angeles, California to record three more songs at The Lair. A video update on September 6 showed that Reddick was finishing vocals to \"She Doesn't Think That It's Ever Gonna Work Out\". Mixing and mastering would begin mid-month. A video with Reddick mentioned that The Dollyrots' Kelly Ogden would be singing on \"Happy as Happy Gets\". The new single \"Hey Diane\" was released to pledgers on October 1. A digital download of the album was first made available to pledge members on October 13.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Jarinus except \"She Used to Be Mine\", \"Ever Gonna Work Out\", and \"Stop Doing That\" written by Jaret Reddick and \"Hey Jealousy\" written by Doug Hopkins.\nPersonnel\n;Bowling for Soup\n* Jaret Reddick - vocals, guitar\n* Chris Burney - guitars, vocals\n* Erik Chandler - bass guitar, vocals\n* Gary Wiseman - drums\n;Production\n* Jarinus (Jaret Reddick & Linus of Hollywood) - producer\n* Jay Ruston - mixing (at TRS West)\n* John Douglas - assistant mix engineer\n* Paul Logus - mastering (at PLX Mastering)\n* Dave Pearson - artwork\nReferences"
