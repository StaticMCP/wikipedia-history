The band consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist Jack White, and drummer Meg White who also occasionally sang. They have received several accolades, including a Brit Award and six Grammy Awards. Overall, the White Stripes have won 18 awards from 71 nominations.\nThe duo released their first two albums, The White Stripes (1999) and De Stijl (2000), to limited success; it was their third album, White Blood Cells (2001), that pushed the band into the public eye. The album's success was boosted by the single \"Fell in Love with a Girl\" and its subsequent music video, which won three MTV Video Music Awards. Their fourth album, Elephant (2003), went multi-platinum in four territories and won the Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song. Elephant produced four singles including \"Seven Nation Army\", which became the band's most enduring work and a stadium anthem.\nThe White Stripes' later albums, Get Behind Me Satan (2005) and Icky Thump (2007), both won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and charted in the top five of the Billboard 200. The title track of Icky Thump became the band's highest entry on the Billboard Hot 100. They also broke a Guinness World Record in 2009 for performing the shortest music concert. In 2011, the White Stripes disbanded. In 2025, the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; they were previously nominated in 2023 (their first year of eligibility).\nAmerican Music Awards\nThe American Music Awards are awarded for achievements in the record industry.
