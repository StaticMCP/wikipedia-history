Twelve of which were recovered by the Romanian state and at least another twelve are still missing.\nLooting groups\nIn Romania, unauthorized digs are illegal around the areas designated archeological sites. Some looters use flocks of sheep in order to justify their presence in the area: they camp near the archeological sites and use donkeys to carry their equipment.\nIn 2009, twelve looters (among which Iulian Ceia) were convicted to between 7 and 12 years in jail for looting Dacian bracelets and selling them on the international black market; they have however appealed and the trial is still ongoing.\nIn 2012, four looters (Liviu Darius Baci, Mircea Mihăilă, Florin Sebastian Zvîncă, Romică Hîndorean) were sent to trial for looting from Sarmizegetusa Regia between 1998 and 2009. They looted 3,600 Greek coins (estimated at €3,794,550), a necklace (estimated at €100,000) and 35 Roman denarii (from Dâncu Mare).\nArtifacts looted\n]]\nDacian bracelets\nThe golden bracelets, weighing between 800 and 1200 grams each, were discovered by looters in the Sarmizegetusa Regia Dacian fortress (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) in the Orăștie Mountains and they were illegally exported. They were recovered by the Romanian authorities from the international market through a collaboration with the German authorities.\nDacian coins\nFollowing the looting, gold Koson coins have been dispersed around the world, being sold at coin auctions. The Romanian police began an international investigation which resulted in seizures in Hamburg and London (2010) and Dublin (2011), the source of the two coins seized in the Dublin auction being a New York auction. Such coins have an estimated value of €800 each. The Romanian authorities have so far, recovered 700 gold Kosons and 202 silver Kosons.\nA treasure containing 3,600 Greek coins (bearing the names of Lysimachus, Pharnakes and Asander) weighing  was looted in August 1998 from the Sarmizegetusa Regia site of Șesu Căprăreței. It was taken illegally out of the country and sold on the Triton III auction (November/December 1999) in the United States.\nThe Romanian authorities recovered only 28 Lysimachus coins.\nOn 21 May 2013, three Lysimachus coins minted on Tomis and Callatis were recovered from looters among other Roman and medieval coins.\nOther artifacts\nIn 2009, the Romanian authorities recovered from Germany an ancient golden necklace with pendants that has been looted around 2002&ndash;2003 from the archeological site of Dacian fortress of Căpâlna. The authorities also recovered three royal Dacian iron shields.\nReferences"
