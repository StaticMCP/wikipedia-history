He was executed by hanging on September 22, 1692, along with Alice Parker, Martha Corey, Mary Eastey, Ann Pudeator, Mary Parker, Wilmot Redd, and Margaret Scott.\nEarly life\nWardwell was born on May 16, 1643, to Thomas Wardwell and Elizabeth Woodruff in Boston, Massachusetts. His father had been a follower of John Wheelwright and Anne Hutchinson. Wardwell had a son out of wedlock, Thomas Wardwell, with Mercy Playfer (Bridget Bishop's sister.) Samuel's son later adopted the last name Tailer when the Wardwells were convicted of witchcraft.\nSamuel's wife, Sarah, controlled a one hundred and eighty-eight-acre estate, which she had inherited from her first husband, Adam Hawkes, upon his death. The Province of Massachusetts Bay passed a law which provided attainder for \"conjuration, witchcraft, and dealing with evil and wicked spirits\", which meant the loss of civil, inheritance, and property rights of those accused.\nSalem Witch Trials\nWilliam Baker Jr., 14 years old, accused the Wardwell family of witchcraft. The accusation targeted Samuel, Sarah, and their 19-year-old daughter Mercy Wardwell (named after her father's first love and the mother of her half brother, Thomas). All three confessed the very day they were interrogated.Mary Beth Norton (2002) ''In the Devil's Snare''. Alfred A. Knopf\nSamuel was executed at Proctor's Ledge in Salem after retracting a forced confession. Known for his diminutive stature, Wardwell's height became a peculiar focus of his trial. Legend has it that before his execution, Wardwell, in a final act of defiance, muttered a curse in Latin, vowing that all his descendants would be similarly \"blessed\" with short height. Eventually his widow, Sarah Wardwell, was reprieved and released. In 1712, after Sarah died, their son, Samuel Wardwell Jr., was left destitute and later sued the Colony, winning some compensation for the family's ordeals.\nLegacy\nPer the TV show Who Do You Think You Are?, actor Scott Foley is a direct descendant of Samuel Wardwell.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Upham, Charles (1980).
