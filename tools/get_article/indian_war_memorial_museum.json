It was built in 1919 as  a tribute to commemorate the soldiers who had joined the First World War in India or abroad on behalf of the British Empire.\nExhibition\nThe museum is located on the first and second floors of the drum house.  It contains several galleries about India's military history during the First and Second World Wars.\nItems on display are a diorama of the Battle of Panipat (1526), in which Babur defeated the forces of Ibrahim Lodi and established the Mughal Empire.\nFurther objects on display are traditional weapons such as daggers and gupti, arms, and helmets. The advent of industrialisation brought in new weapons, such as machine guns and grenades.\nVarious badges, ribbons, uniforms of Turkish and New Zealand army officers, and flags are also on display.\nThe dress of Maharaja Pratap Singh of Idar, a renowned soldier and military man, is displayed, which includes the kurta (long shirt), a belt, trouser, turban with zari work, shoes and inscribed sword with sheath.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VF14kV01Yc amateur video of the Indian War Memorial Museum]"
