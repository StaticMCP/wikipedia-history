Under OPV, voters are only required to vote for one candidates, although they can choose to preference other candidates.\nIn the 22 councils that use single-member wards (including Brisbane and the Gold Coast) OPV is also used.\nMulti-member wards\nIn July 2019, it was announced that the 10 single-member wards on Ipswich City Council would be replaced by four two-member wards, reducing the total amount of councillors to eight.\nNo form of preferential voting is in place, with plurality block voting (also referred to as first-past-the-post by the Electoral Commission) is instead used, where voters are only required to mark the same amount of candidates as there are positions to be elected − in the case of Ipswich, two candidates.\nUndivided councils\n54 councils are undivided, meaning they do not use any forms of wards and all councillors are elected in a single area representing the entire LGA.\nPlurality block voting is used for these councils.\nParty changes before elections\nA number of councillors joined or left parties before the 2024 elections.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Most wards are not contested by political parties and are rarely successful when they do. The sole exception to this is Brisbane, which is contested by the Liberal National Party, Labor and the Greens. The Greens also contested several seats in other LGAs, though none of their candidates outside Brisbane were elected. There are also a number of councillors and candidates who are members of political parties but ran as independents.\nMinor parties including the Animal Justice Party and the Liberal Democrats also contested the elections. There are also a number of local parties that operate exclusively within a single LGA.\nThe North Queensland State Alliance, which advocates for the creation of the State of North Queensland, ran two separate party tickets − Cairns N.Q.S.A. Team (5,775 votes) and TSV Team NQ State Alliance (6,694 votes). No candidates from either ticket were elected.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-bottom:0\"\n|+\n|colspan=10 align=center|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10px;\" | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\" | Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | %\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | Swing\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | Change\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Independents\n|954,307\n|41.72\n|\n| 424\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Liberal National\n| 279,793\n|12.23\n|\n| 19\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Greg Williamson Alliance\n| 272,691\n|11.92\n|\n| 6\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Labor\n| 200,428\n| 8.76\n|\n| 5\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Independent Liberal National\n| 169,364\n|7.40\n|\n| 15\n|  5\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Greens\n| 141,006\n|6.16\n|\n| 1\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Independent Labor\n| 79,606\n|3.48\n|\n| 7\n|  2\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Team Jenny Hill\n| 44,715\n|1.95\n|\n| 9\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Christensen & Keioskie\n| 43,781\n|1.91\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Cairns Unity\n| 26,395\n| 1.15\n|\n| 6\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Future Noosa\n| 25,280\n|1.11\n|\n| 1\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Our Team 4 Your Shire\n| 24,973\n|1.09\n|\n| 3\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Progress Mount Isa\n| 20,155\n|0.88\n|\n| 5\n|  5\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Your Voice Of Experience\n| 18,917\n|0.83\n|\n| 2\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Unity Maranoa\n| 16,546\n|0.72\n|\n| 4\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mount Isa Community Team\n| 15,571\n|0.68\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | North Queensland State Alliance\n| 12,469\n|0.55\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | It's Time for Townsville\n| 12,375\n|0.54\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Animal Justice\n|10,665\n|0.47\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Our Voice\n| 10,587\n|0.46\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Team WORK\n| 7,483\n|0.33\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Liberal Democrats\n|7,433\n|0.32\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Locals United - Back to Basics\n| 5,128\n|0.22\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Independent Socialist\n| 4,428\n| 0.19\n|\n| 1\n|  1\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Logan Needs Moore\n| 4,362\n|0.19\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Independent One Nation\n| 3,928\n|0.17\n|\n| 1\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Better Families\n| 2,395\n|0.10\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Whig\n| 1,825\n|0.08\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Independent United Australia\n| 1,352\n|0.06\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Civil Liberties & Motorists\n| 586\n|0.03\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Team Josh Weazel\n| 410\n|0.02\n|\n| 2\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Independent Katter's Australian\n| 409\n|0.02\n|\n| 1\n|  1\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| &nbsp;Total\n| 2,287,588\n| 94.55\n|\n| 512\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Invalid/blank votes|| 131,775 || 5.45 || ||–||–\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Turnout || 2,419,363 || 77.28 || ||–||–\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Registered voters || 3,130,716 ||–||–||–||–\n|}\nMayoral elections\nSee also\n*2020 Brisbane City Council election\n*2020 Gold Coast City Council election\n*2020 Townsville City Council election\nNotes\nReferences"
