Lots of flavour ... Not overly long, [a] departure from from [Avalon Hill] items.\" In the following issue, Vasey, Peter Lee and Roger Sandell thoroughly analyzed the game and then discussed it. Lee commented, \"My dissatisfaction lies with the withdrawal rules governing field battles. In my view, it is simply too easy for an enemy force to withdraw from a battle ... What about the cavalry superiority and the surrounding of the enemy? Here these rules seem to be heavily emasculated ... Finally, in the game it is possible for an unsupplied force to survive for many turns despite attrition.\" Vasey replied, \"I do not think that rationalisation will hold water ... I think the supply rules are quite reasonable and accurate. The cavalry and surround rules seem reasonable too ... The problem comes in the battles. As you point out the result is precious\nlike the real thing ... The whole situation makes one feel that the use of Frederick the Greats rules would help.\" Sandell added, \" I have some reservations about the 1805-1815 game as a simulation ... The production rules give no indication of the way constant war and its effect on French manpower led to the wearing down of the Grand Armee from its peak of 1805-1809 .... A multi-player version of the 1805-1815 game is given but I do not really see this as having much appeal to those who relish the wheeling and dealing aspect of multi-player games.\" Vasey summarized for all three, writing, \"It is not all things to all men, as with most Avalon Hill games the accent is always on the game ... The package has plenty of play value with its many scenarios.\"\nIn Issue 26 of Phoenix, David Mylie notes \"If you prefer strategic games or are interested in the Napoleonic period, War and Peace is well worth investigation.\"\nWar and Peace was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book Hobby Games: The 100 Best. Fantasy author R. A. Salvatore commented, \"I've played them all and that's the one that had me lying in bed for hours and hours, working up multi-turn strategies for blasting my enemy's supply lines, or creating a back-alley run to Paris. That's the game, with its simple elegance yet multitude of tactics, that offered to me exactly the right amount of information to juggle. Neither overwhelming nor underwhelming, too hot nor too cold, too big nor too small, too soft nor too hard, War and Peace fit this duck's bill.\"\nAwards\nAt the 1981 Charles S. Roberts Awards, War and Peace was a finalist for \"Best Pre-Twentieth Century Game of 1980.\"\nOther reviews\n* Fire & Movement No. 25\n* Boardgamer Vol. 8, No. 3\n* Casus Belli No. 17 (Oct 1983)\n*Moves #52, p11-12\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dvgc.com/gamekits.html Deer Valley Game Company] contains extensive errata, updates, and fixes.\n* [http://www.grognard.com/ Grognards.com], a provider of wargame materials\n* [http://www.grognard.com/titlew.html#w3/ Grognards.com file listing] provides a fix for the two player version of the Campaign Game.\n* [https://www.war-and-peace-game.com/ War and Peace for PC] the classic board game adapted for computers by Avalon Digital.\n*"
