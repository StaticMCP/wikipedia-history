The version of the show in Hollywood had its final performance on December 31, 2012; the show then closed January 1, 2013. The version in Florida had its final performance on October 8, 2017; the show then closed October 9, 2017. The version in Osaka closed on September 14, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, making the show on September 13, 2020, the final performance.\nThe attraction is a mini-sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day and reunites director James Cameron and the main cast from the movie, including Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Edward Furlong as John Connor, and Robert Patrick as the T-1000. The show was presented in two parts; a pre-show where a Cyberdyne Systems company hostess shows guests a brief video presentation about the company's innovations, and the main show, where live performers interact with a 3D film. The attraction marked James Cameron's final involvement with the Terminator franchise until Terminator: Dark Fate in 2019.\nHistory\nThe attraction was originally developed for Universal Studios Florida, with producers pushing for a second installation in Universal Studios Hollywood during development. The original attraction cost a total of $60 million. With a total run time of 12 minutes, the film alone cost $24 million, making it one of the most expensive films per minute in the world.\nOn May 30, 1995, Universal Orlando announced that they would be receiving Terminator 2 3D: Battle Across Time. The attraction opened in the Hollywood area of Universal Orlando on April 27, 1996, to very positive reviews. Additional venues were later announced for Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Japan.\nConstruction for the Hollywood venue forced the closure of Fievel's Playland and An American Tail Theatre, which were built atop a parking structure. The attraction opened on the Upper Lot of Universal Studios Hollywood on May 6, 1999. In the year of the attraction's opening, attendance at Universal Studios Hollywood remained steady at 5.1 million; however, other parks in the region saw declines in revenue, such as Disneyland which experienced a 5% drop. The Terminator stage was subsequently used for the annual Halloween Horror Nights event, with The Rocky Horror Picture Show: A Tribute being shown in 2009.\nAt Universal Studios Japan, the attraction was added as one of the debut attractions in the New York section of the park. It opened to the public on March 31, 2001. California-based firm Technifex provided special effects and show equipment for the attraction.\nIn late 2012, Universal Studios Hollywood announced that their version would close on December 31, 2012. It was later announced Despicable Me Minion Mayhem would replace the attraction. The version at Universal Orlando had its final performance on October 8, 2017. Two years later, Universal Orlando announced that a new Jason Bourne-themed show named The Bourne Stuntacular would replace that park's version of the Terminator show. This attraction premiered on June 30, 2020.\nThe version in Osaka was temporarily closed on September 14, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However on May 16, 2023, Universal Studios Japan announced the park had no intentions to reopen the attraction.Four years later, Universal Studios Japan announced this a new Detective Conan 4-D Live Show: Jewel Under the Starry Sky would replace this park version, this attraction premiered on March 22, 2024.\nCast\n* Arnold Schwarzenegger as Terminator\n* Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor\n* Edward Furlong as John Connor\n* Robert Patrick as T-1000\nExperience\nQueue\nThe queue features dozens of television monitors that show a series of video segments (which are being presented on the \"Cyberdyne Interactive Network\", or C.I.N.). The queue media sets the scene in the lobby of Cyberdyne and the company propaganda is playing all around the audience. The segments are about the latest innovations and products of Cyberdyne Systems. The video also includes several special musical segments, including two songs from the film; \"Bad to the Bone\" and \"Guitars, Cadillacs\", as well as a \"live\" video feed from Costa Rica of a performance of the song La Bamba. Mixed into the video cycle are live images of the waiting audience (in the manner of a closed-circuit security system) and two brief comical sketches of \"guests\" running afoul of Cyberdyne security – either being electrocuted by a security device or being arrested by security staff.\nQueue video also contains a brief appearance of Dr. Peter Silberman played by Earl Boen.\nJust before entering the pre-show auditorium, guests pass an unmanned kiosk where they pick up a pair of \"safety visors\" (3D glasses) for use during the main show.\nPre-show\nThe pre-show is hosted in the \"Miles Bennett Dyson Memorial Auditorium\" by Kimberley Duncan (named Reika Ayanokōji for the Japanese version), Cyberdyne's Director of Community Relations and Media Control. Here, the audience stands and views a promotional video about Cyberdyne's numerous technological contributions before the video feed is temporarily hijacked by John (Edward Furlong) and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), warning the audience about Skynet and the future war against the machines and telling them to get out of the building before they are cut off. As the video continues, Duncan can be seen talking on a phone, telling someone on the other line to find the Connors. Once the video ends, Duncan tells the audience to ignore the Connors' warnings and proceed forward. The video was produced and directed by Landmark Entertainment's Gary Goddard and Adam Bezark. A segment on future technology in sports featured a young Shaquille O'Neal.\nThe promotional video in the pre-show was updated in 2015 as some of the original pre-show featured \"future\" technologies that were now in existence; new CGI and narration now accompanied the remastered original footage alongside some newly-shot scenes.\nMain show\nGuests are ushered from the pre-show auditorium into a large theater that seats 700 where they are to see a demonstration of Cyberdyne's newest creation, the \"Cyberdyne Series 70 Autonomous Infantry Unit\" (T-70 Terminators). Once guests are seated, they are told to put on their \"safety visors\" to watch a demonstration of the T-70 Terminators in action, presented by Duncan. After this brief demonstration, John and Sarah arrive and disrupt the proceedings. After disabling the security alarms, they force Duncan to shut down the T-70s. However, they are confronted by a T-1000 Terminator (Robert Patrick) from the future whom they engage with automatic-weapons. Duncan is killed by the T-1000 while attempting to stop him, mistaking him for a police officer. In some shows, Duncan flees the auditorium instead of being killed. A T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) bursts through the movie screen through a \"time portal\" on his signature Harley-Davidson motorcycle – via actual actor/stunt double riding into auditorium – to rescue John. He takes John back through the portal and into the future war between humans and machines while Sarah stays behind in the present, with the T-1000 in pursuit. After defeating him, John and the T-800 make their way across the war-ravaged landscape as they head towards Skynet. Along the way, they are chased by a flying Hunter-Killer, four Mini-Hunters, and a Terminator endoskeleton.\nThe duo successfully penetrate the Skynet facility and descend with the audience into Skynet's Central Core, where they battle the \"T-1000000\", a giant liquid-metal spider-like construct similar to a very large T-1000. The T-800 sends John to a nearby time machine that will take him back to the present while he stays behind to blow up Skynet and the T-1000000. The show ends with the ground-shaking destruction of Skynet, leaving Sarah and John alone in the present time once again. During the destruction of the T-1000000, water is sprayed from the ceiling onto the riders and then during the explosion, smoke is blown into the audience; the seats of the auditorium also lurch with a sudden drop, giving guests a final scare and ending the attraction with Sarah narrating that she feels that she owes her life to the Terminator for saving John's life. During this narration, the face of a Terminator endoskeleton fills the screen, morphing into Schwarzenegger's face before the film fades to black, during which John and Sarah mysteriously disappear.\nThe ground breaking sound design for the theater set new standards and created new technologies in the design and delivery of fully immersive 3D sound. The main show sound system is a 24 channel matrix surround system driven by a Peavey Media Matrix, an Akai DD1000 digital 24 Track, 156 speakers, 24 custom engineered subwoofers that shook the building. James Cameron was quoted as saying, \"Sound is 50% of the experience. T23D is the greatest sounding show in the world\".\nProduction\nThe initial planning for T2-3D: Battle Across Time began in the early 1990s. Jay Stein, Universal Destinations & Experiences' Chairman and CEO at the time, asked Gary Goddard and his team at Landmark Entertainment to develop a stunt show based around the Terminator franchise. Goddard sought permission from MCA Planning and Development (later Universal Creative) to morph this concept into a theater-based presentation featuring a 3-D film, live action and pyrotechnics. After a year-and-a-half of development, MCA Planning and Development and Landmark Entertainment approached James Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment for ultimate approval. Although Cameron was originally against the idea of Universal taking his Terminator franchise and converting it into a ride, he found the storyboards and the whole concept to be \"great\", so the project was green-lit.\nA full-scale mock-up duplicating the dimensions of the planned Florida venue was created in an airplane hangar at the Van Nuys Airport in the San Fernando Valley. The set consists of a stage surrounded by a triptych of adjoined silver screens. Each of these three screens measured . A total of six SimEx-Iwerks projectors were used to run the 3-D, 70mm film simultaneously at 30 frames per second. Several elements of T2-3D: Battle Across Time have been patented by Universal, including the seat drop effect, the blending of live action and film, the trio of projection screens, and the simulated assault weapons.\nThe film was shot at the abandoned Eagle Mountain iron ore mine, just north of Desert Center in California. The cast and crew from the first two Terminator films returned for the shoot, including Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Robert Patrick as T-1000, and Edward Furlong as John Connor. To achieve the 3-D effect on a 70mm projected film, a two-camera rig weighing  was used.\nAs a sequel to the 1991 film, T2-3D: Battle Across Time introduced two new Terminator characters. The first is Cyberdyne's latest invention, the T-1000000. It is a large spider-like version of the T-1000 that defends Skynet's CPU from attack. Like the T-1000, it is made of mimetic polyalloy, allowing it to form its legs into stabbing weapons. The only known T-1000000 was destroyed when Skynet's core was destroyed.\nThe demonstration featured as the premise for the film involves several large practical effects robots called T-70s, designed as mechanical soldiers, with large miniguns on their arms. They are the earliest Terminator models shown to have a humanoid form with arms and legs, and are a direct predecessor to Schwarzenegger's T-800. The T-70s stand  tall and line the walls of the arena.\nSee also\n*List of amusement rides based on film franchises\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.usj.co.jp/e/attractions/litebox/t2-3d.html Terminator 2: 3D Battle Across Time at Universal Studios Japan]"
