      "text": "# Ancient Diocese of Boulogne__disambig_1\n\nThe former French Catholic diocese of Boulogne existed from 1567 to the French Revolution. It was created after the diocese of Thérouanne was suppressed because of war damage to the see; effectively this was a renaming. It belonged to the Archdiocese of Reims. The Concordat of 1801 suppressed the diocese of Boulogne, transferring its territory to the diocese of Arras.[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/db521.html Boulogne (Diocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy&#93;] The seat was the Boulogne Cathedral, demolished in 1793.\nBishops\n* Claude-André Dormy 1567–1599\n* Claude Dormy 1600–1626\n* Victor Le Bouthillier 1626–1630\n* Jean Dolce 1633–1643\n* François Perrochel 1643–1675\n* Nicolas Ladvocat-Billiard 1677–1681\n* Claude Le Tonnelier de Breteuil 1682–1698\n* Antoine-Girard de La Bournat 1698\n* Pierre de Langle 1698–1724\n* Jean-Marie Henriau 1724–1738\n* Augustin-César D'Hervilly de Devise 1738–1742\n* François-Joseph-Gaston de Partz de Pressy 1742–1789\n* Jean-René Asseline 1789–1790\nSee also\n* Catholic Church in France\n* List of Catholic dioceses in France\nNotes\nBibliography\nReference works\n*  (Use with caution; obsolete)\n*  (in Latin)\n* (in Latin)\n*\n*\n*\n*\nStudies\n*\n*\n*"
