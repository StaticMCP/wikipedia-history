Bronislaw Koniuszy's replica of Bertel Thorvaldsen's original 1830 sculpture in Warsaw, Poland, was created, installed, and dedicated in 1973. Adler Planetarium erected the monument to mark the 500th anniversary of Copernicus' birth.\nSee also\n* 1973 in art\n* Copernicus Foundation\n* List of public art in Chicago\nReferences"
