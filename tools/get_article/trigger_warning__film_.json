Parker meets with friend and manager of the bar, Mike, and investigates the mine, deducing that Harry's death was not an accident. At a bar, Parker gets into a confrontation with Jesse's younger brother, Elvis, and later, she rescues a hardware store owner from thieves.\nParker witnesses Elvis and his henchmen firing weapons and snooping on her family property. When calling Spider to investigate, he finds that Elvis is a weapons dealer on the dark web who supplies arms to terrorists. While reconnecting with Jesse, Parker meets his father and senator, Ezekiel Swann, who is running for reelection.\nLater, after Harry's funeral, Parker meets with Jesse and Ezekiel at their compound before Spider messages to inform her that Elvis' men are trespassing in Harry's mine. She confronts them and they burn down her bar, leading to the death of one of the henchmen and Parker being arrested.\nJesse confronts Elvis about the incident, revealing that Elvis had been using Harry's mine to take weapons from a nearby military depot. They had managed to access an underground tunnel and start secretly funneling weapons out to sell them to arms dealers, funding Ezekiel's campaign and helping Jesse become sheriff.\nWhen Harry found out, Jesse killed him, and the Swanns blamed it on a mine collapsewhich Harry triggered as he lay dying. Ezekiel orders them to stop arguing, dictates that the arms dealing will continue, and has Jesse kill Parker's lawyer.\nAfter killing the lawyer, Jesse lets Ezekiel and Elvis into the holding cells, where they tie Parker up and beat her in an attempt to obtain the security footage from her bar. She escapes from the cells in a police cruiser, but passes out from her injuries while driving and crashes in a field on Mike's property.\nMike and his mother hide Parker so she can recover in his hidden weed lab, while Elvis confronts them, threatening to burn down the property if they don't produce her. After three days of recovery, Parker tries to warn the senior officer at the weapons depot about the arms thefts, but his staff hangs up on her. Eager for payback, and with the assistance of family friends Mo and Frank, Parker collects enough weapons to wage her own war on the Swanns.\nGhost, a Timothy McVeigh-esque domestic terrorist wanted for the murder of at least 37 Americans, has paid the Swanns hundreds of thousands of dollars in advance for stolen weapons, and they aren't delivered thanks to Parker's interference. When pressed on the matter, Ezekiel admits he already spent the money on his re-election campaign. Parker infiltrates the Swann compound and confronts Ezekiel, getting answers for what happened to her father before killing him.\nSpider arrives at the mines to assist Parker, but encounters Ghost's thugs. Parker explodes a weapons truck to distract the thugs, allowing her and Spider to kill them before she stabs Elvis to death. Mo, Frank and Parker's family friends arrive in the mines to help her see her mission through, discovering the military depot exit.\nJesse arrives with a grenade in his hand, desperate to take control of the situation. Parker offers to help him, but he realizes there's no happy ending for him and he shoves her away before blowing himself up.\nWith the Swann family dead, Parker is able to move on with her life. A month later, Parker and Spider are driving cross country to return to their CIA jobs when Mikey video calls, with an update on the advanced progress of work to rebuild and reopen Maria's.\nCast\nIn addition, Alejandro De Hoyos appears, in flashbacks, as Harry.\nProduction\nIn June 2016, Thunder Road Films acquired Josh Olson and John Brancato's spec script for Trigger Warning.

Jesse Hassenger of IGN wrote, \"Trigger Warning mashes together three different types of pulpy thrillers, but it sometimes feels as if the Jessica Alba vehicle isn’t bothering to actually take the best of what it’s ripping off\". Brian Lowry of CNN wrote, \"Trigger Warning might not be packing anything unexpected in the chamber, but for those who come to it with the proper mind-set, the movie doesn’t wind up firing blanks either.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
