It is connected to the Massif du Nord mountain range in neighboring Haiti.\nGeography\nThe Cordillera Central is home to the highest peaks in the Caribbean: Pico Duarte (3,098&nbsp;m or 10,164 ft) (the highest point in the Caribbean), La Pelona (3,094&nbsp;m or 10,150 ft) and La Rucilla (3,049&nbsp;m or 10,003 ft). Connected to the smaller Massif du Nord in Haiti, it gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of San Cristóbal on the Caribbean coastal plains. Because of its altitude, cool temperature, and scenic vistas, the Cordillera Central is also known as the \"Dominican Alps\".\nParks\nJosé Armando Bermúdez National Park (Parque Nacional Armando Bermúdez) is located in the range, protecting a diversity of flora and fauna species. The pale magnolia tree (Magnolia pallescens), an endangered species endemic to the Dominican Republic, grows in the park.\nOther ranges\nIn the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two, largely dry and rocky ranges. The more northerly of the two is the Sierra de Neiba, while in the south the Sierra de Bahoruco is a continuation of the Massif de la Selle in Haiti.\nReferences"
