      "text": "# Heritage Trail (Iowa)\n\nHeritage Trail is a  long, multiuse rail trail connecting Dubuque and Dyersville, Iowa.\nIt is maintained by the Dubuque County Conservation Board, and was converted from a segment of the former Chicago Great Western railroad line between Chicago and Oelwein, Iowa. It is mostly surfaced with compacted, crushed limestone. The county and the city of Dyersville recently sought to have  the two mile segment adjacent to Dyersville paved.\nSee also\n*List of rail trails\n*Parks in Dubuque, Iowa\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091104142353/http://www.dubuquecounty.org/Conservation/HeritageTrail/tabid/193/Default.aspx Heritage Trail official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090514154823/http://www.inhf.org/iowatrails/heritage-intro.htm Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation trail information]"
