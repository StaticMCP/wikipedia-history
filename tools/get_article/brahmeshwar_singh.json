On 1 June 2012, he was assassinated by unidentified gunmen.\nRanvir Sena, arrest, and acquittal\nBrahmeshwar Singh was born in a Bhumihar Brahmin family and later on became the leader of the Ranvir Sena soon after it was formed in 1994. Singh was suspected of involvement in the killings of hundreds of Naxalites who recruited people from poor and Dalit backgrounds. In 2002, Singh was arrested on \"carnage\" charges, for which he faced the possibility of life imprisonment. He spent nine years in jail awaiting trial and was released on bail and then later acquitted for insufficient evidence.\nPolitics\nOn 5 May 2012, Singh founded the Akhil Bharatiya Rashtravadi Kisan Sangathan, an organization that Singh said would assist farmers and other manual labourers.\nDeath\nOn 1 June 2012, Brahmeshwar Singh was on a morning walk near his home in Arrah, Bihar. Reportedly, around six armed men shot Singh several times. The assassination resulted in public unrest and severe rioting. Several thousand people burnt the circuit house, Block Development Officer's office, and several government vehicles; damaged railway offices; and stopped the trains on the Howrah-Delhi route.\nSee also\n*Jagdish Mahto\n*Ashok Mahto gang\n*Ajay Kanu\nReferences\nExternal links\n* , Al Jazeera English\n* , CNN-IBN"
