Olympic was scheduled for November 1945, to be followed by Coronet in early 1946.\nIf Downfall had taken place, it would have been the largest amphibious operation in history, surpassing D-Day. The planned operation was canceled when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet declaration of war, and the invasion of Manchuria.\nOrder of Battle for Olympic\nAllied\nSupreme Commander, Allied Forces Pacific\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur\nGround forces\nShould these four corps prove insufficient to accomplish the tasks assigned, elements earmarked for Coronet would be used to reinforce Sixth Army at the rate of three divisions per month beginning about 30 days after the initial landings.\n:  U.S. Sixth Army\n: General Walter Krueger\n:: Peripheral landings\n:::  40th Infantry Division (Landing on Yakushima and Koshikijima Islands)\n:::  158th Infantry Regiment (Landing on Tanegashima)\n::  I Corps (Landing at Miyazaki)\n:: Major General Innis P.
