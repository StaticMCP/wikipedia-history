The OBSI provides the service on an impartial and independent basis, and free of charge to the consumer as an alternative to the legal system.\nIndividuals and small businesses may contact OBSI with a complaint at no charge to them. If OBSI decides that a firm has acted unfairly or made an error and the customer lost money, it will recommend that the firm pay compensation. OBSI may also recommend other types of non-financial compensation when appropriate. OBSI is a non profit organisation and charges fees to its member financial firms.\nHistory\nOBSI was founded in 1996 as the Canadian Banking Ombudsman to review complaints by small business against the chartered banks. In a few short months, the mandate was expanded to cover unresolved consumer complaints as well.\nIn 2002, as a result of discussions among government, industry and consumer groups about improving consumer protection in financial services, all members of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada and the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada joined the organization. At the same time, OBSI invited credit unions to join and changed its name to “Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments” (OBSI).\nIn 2013, the Canadian Securities Administrators [https://osc.gov.on.ca/en/NewsEvents_nr_20131219_csa-mandate-obsi-dispute-resolution.htm announced] amendments to National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations (NI 31-103) and Companion Policy 31-103CP Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations that will require all registered dealers and advisers outside of Quebec to use OBSI as their provider of dispute-resolution services. By August 1, 2014, all registered dealers must be members in OBSI, with the effect that OBSI's membership will more than double, to over 1600 participating firms.\nAny regulated firm in the banking services and investment fields is eligible to join OBSI.\nIn September 2018, Scotiabank stopped using OBSI, making it the third big bank, after Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada, to not use OBSI.\nIn October 2023, “amid a surge in consumer complaints about their banks, the federal Finance department is mandating that the non-profit Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments (OBSI) serve as the sole provider of external complaint handling.”\nOperation\nOBSI is Canada's national independent dispute resolution service (ADR) for consumers or small businesses with a complaint they can't resolve with their financial services firm. As a free alternative to the legal system, OBSI works informally and confidentially to find fair outcomes to disputes about banking and investment products and services.\nIf OBSI decides that a firm has acted unfairly, made an error or given a customer bad advice, and the customer lost money as a result, it will recommend that the firm restore your financial position to where it should have been. OBSI may also recommend other types of non-financial compensation when appropriate. If OBSI thinks a customer has been treated fairly, or the settlement offer the customer has previously received from a firm is fair, OBSI will inform the customer and let them know the reasons why it believes so. While OBSI cannot order a firm to follow a recommendation, OBSI has an excellent record of firms – and clients – accepting its recommendations. OBSI will make public the name of any firm that refuses a recommendation.\nThe limit for OBSI's recommendations is $350,000. However, if a customer's claim is for an amount higher than $350,000 the customer can voluntarily reduce it.\nOBSI is not a regulator, and because OBSI is impartial it does not advocate for consumers or the industry. That also means OBSI doesn't give advice – financial, legal or other. If a customer doesn't like OBSI's findings in a case, the customer is still able to go to a lawyer or seek other ways of resolving the dispute.\nComplaints it will deal with\nOBSI looks into complaints about most banking and investment matters including:\n* mutual funds\n* bonds and GICs\n* stocks, exchange-traded funds, income trusts and other securities\n* investment advice\n* unauthorized trading\n* fraud\n* mortgages\n* loans and credit\n* debit and credit cards\n* fees and  rates\n* transaction errors\n* misrepresentation;\n* accounts sent  to collections\nOBSI is able to make recommendations for amounts up to $350,000.\nOBSI currently has more than 600 participating firms in Canada, that include Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) member firms, Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (MFDA) member firms, mutual fund companies, banks, Credit unions and deposit-taking organizations.\nComplaints that it won't deal with\nIf the customer's complaint involves an insurance company, the customer should contact one of the insurance ombudservices to see if they can help.

A majority of the directors are independent, and have not been part of industry or government for at least five years. A minority of the directors are appointed from lists of nominees provided by industry bodies. The directors also comprise the voting membership of the organization.\nOBSI is headed by the Ombudsman has two teams of investigators: one for Banking Services and the other for Investments. The Ombudsman is also independent of industry and government.\nFunding\nOBSI levies fees on all of participating firms based on their size or volume of business. OBSI's budget is set each year by the Board of Directors based on the advice of staff.\nInternational Network of Financial Services Ombudsman Schemes\nOBSI is a member of the International Network of Financial Services Ombudsman Schemes, a global association whose members operate as out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms in the financial sector.\nReferences\nInvestment Executive [https://www.investmentexecutive.com/-/csa-expands-obsi-mandate CSA expands OBSI mandate]\nBusiness News Network [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/video/streetwise-video-the-future-of-canadas-national-bank-ombudsman/article2383758/ The Future of Canada's National Bank Ombudsman]\nCanadian Press [https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/873516--rise-seen-in-financial-abuse-of-the-elderly Rise seen in financial abuse of the elderly]\nChinese News [http://www.chinesenewsgroup.com/SMPApp/design/article.jsp?cate=16&artId=14919 Unsuitable advice leads to compensating clients, OBSI]\nThe Globe and Mail [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/banks-should-not-have-choice-of-dispute-mediator-ombudsman/article2368314/ https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/banks-should-not-have-choice-of-dispute-mediator-ombudsman/article2368314/]\nThe Globe and Mail [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/strengthen-banking-ombudsman-panel-urges/article2353171/ Strengthen banking ombudsman, panel urges]\nExternal links\n* [https://www.obsi.ca Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments (OBSI) website]\n* [https://www.obsi.ca/images/Documents/Annual_Report/EN/obsi_ar2012_en.pdf OBSI 2012 Annual Report]\n* [https://www.obsi.ca/images/Documents/Annual_Report/FR/osbi_ar2012_fr.pdf OBSI Rapport Annuel 2012]"
