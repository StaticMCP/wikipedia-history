The Ivy Mills was the second oldest paper mill in the United States. The mill made printing paper for Benjamin Franklin and paper for currency for several Continental governments, the US government and many South American countries. The oldest Roman Catholic parish in Pennsylvania began as a mission at the home of the Willcox family in 1730. The church was later moved approximately one mile east to the top of the hill into what later became the Borough of Chester Heights and is known as St. Thomas the Apostle Church.\nIn 1702, the St. John's Episcopal Church was founded on land donated by John Hannum, a successful farmer and tavern owner who was baptized by the former Quaker George Keith. Keith was known to conduct services at the Hannum home on Concord Road.\nThe Newlin Grist Mill has been grinding grain since 1704. It has an  tall stone wheel housed in a timber frame. The mill and processing complex passed through various hands and, in the 1950s, it was purchased by a direct descendant of Nicholas Newlin, which along with  of surrounding countryside became the Newlin Mill Historic Park. The mill complex area was the location of the Markham post office and Markham train station (Philadelphia/Baltimore rail traffic).\nThe name \"Concord\" was believed to have been given by the earliest European settlers of the township and reflects the harmonious feelings among them at the time. Title to all real estate in the township can be traced back to a grant from William Penn.\nConcord Township was a part of Chester County until 1789, at which point Delaware County was created by act of legislature.
