Led by representatives from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks), the insurrectionists overthrew the liberal Russian Provisional Government led by Alexander Kerensky, on 6–7 November 1917 (N.S., 24–25 October O.S.).\nHistory\nOn 1 May 1918, on International Workers' Day, the first parade of the Red Army took place on Khodynka Field. Subsequently, many military parades were traditionally held, mainly on Red Square. At first, these events were held on the anniversary of the October Revolution. On 7 November 1919, a parade was held in honor of the second anniversary of the events of 1917. Columns of cadets, infantry, cavalry, and units, as well as horse-drawn artillery took part in the procession. Starting in 1922, parades began to be held twice a year: on 1 May and 7 November. There were no parades held from 1942–1944 due to occupation of Soviet territories by the German Wehrmacht. The last May Day parade took place in 1968, and the November parade ended in 1990.\nList of parades\n1910s\nThere were military parades held in 1918 and 1919.\n1920s\nThere was no military parades held in 1920 and 1921.

As per tradition, 14 other Soviet Cities (including Leningrad) held their parades on this day. A folding stock version of the AK-47 notably appeared in the contingent from the Airborne troops. This parade included the updated anthem of the Soviet Union for the first time. The parade saw the return of military tanks after a two-year hiatus, the highlight of which was the T-72 tank that was first publicly seen at this parade.
