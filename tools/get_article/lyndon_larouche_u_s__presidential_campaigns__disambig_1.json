LaRouche ran for president on eight consecutive occasions, a record for any candidate, and tied Harold Stassen's record as a perennial candidate. LaRouche ran for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States seven times, beginning in 1980.\nCampaigns\n1976\nIn 1971 LaRouche founded the U.S. Labor Party as a vehicle for electoral politics. In 1976 he ran for President of the United States as the U.S. Labor Party candidate, polling 40,043 votes (0.05%). According to LaRouche supporters, the major accomplishment of the campaign was the broadcast of a paid half-hour television address, which gave LaRouche the opportunity to air his views before a national audience. This was to become a regular feature of later campaigns during the 1980s and 1990s.\nHis platform included a reference to Vice President Nelson Rockefeller: \"Impeach Rocky to prevent imminent nuclear war\".\n1980\nSince the autumn of 1979, LaRouche resigned from the U.S. Labor Party and founded the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), a political action committee whose name drew complaints from the Democratic National Committee, who saw these efforts as infiltration.\nLaRouche budgeted $150,000 for the first primary state, New Hampshire. That included air time on TV stations in overlapping markets such as Maine and Vermont, along with 1,928 radio advertisements on New Hampshire radio. LaRouche reportedly spent $4,000 on a half-hour broadcast on WBZ, and a total of $24,200 on all TV spots in the state.\nThe Democratic National Committee asserted that LaRouche is not a Democrat, but the U.S. electoral system made it impossible for the party to prevent LaRouche followers entering Democratic primaries. LaRouche himself polled negligible vote totals, but continued to promote himself as a serious political candidate, a claim which was sometimes accepted by elements of the media and some political figures.\nIn the end, LaRouche got 177,784 (0.91%) votes in the primaries.\n1984\nLaRouche's 1984 campaign was his most successful, garnering over 76,000 votes. Independent Democrats for LaRouche, a committee formed for the 1984 election, was found guilty in 1988 of soliciting loans in violation of Minnesota securities law, and was ordered to stop selling unregistered Securities.\n1988\nIn 1988 LaRouche and running mate Debra Hanania Freeman received 25,082 votes, or 0.03% of the vote.\n1992\nIn 1992, LaRouche became the third person in U.S. history (after Joseph Smith and Eugene Debs) to run for president from a prison cell. Classical violinist Norbert Brainin performed a benefit concert on his behalf in Washington, D.C.; the Washington Post reviewer praised his musicianship while condemning his political message. LaRouche's running mate, who did the active campaigning, was the American Civil Rights Movement leader, Reverend James Bevel.\n1996\nPrior to the primaries the Chair of the Democratic National Committee, Don Fowler, ruled that LaRouche \"is not to be considered a qualified candidate for nomination of the Democratic Party for President\" on account of LaRouche's \"expressed political beliefs, including beliefs which are explicitly racist and anti-Semitic, and otherwise utterly contrary to the fundamental beliefs ... of the Democratic Party and ... on his past activities including exploitation of and defrauding contributors and voters.\" In subsequent primaries LaRouche received enough votes in Louisiana and Virginia to get one delegate from each state. When the state parties refused to award the delegates LaRouche sued in federal court, claiming a violation of the Voting Rights Act. After losing in the district court the case was appealed to the First District Court of Appeals, which sustained the lower court.\nIn 1999, however, a court ruled that the Democratic National Committee had the right to keep LaRouche from electing delegates to the Democratic National Convention, based on a party requirement that a Democratic nominee must be a registered voter. LaRouche, as a convicted felon, was not eligible to be a registered voter in the state of Virginia, where he lived. (see United States v. LaRouche)\n2000\nA routine FEC audit of the 2000 \"LaRouche's Committee for a New Bretton Woods\" campaign found that vendors whose sole client was Lyndon LaRouche had added unqualified \"mark-up charges\" to the bill submitted for matching funds. The vendors were American System Publications, Inc., Eastern States Distributors, Inc., EIR News Services, Inc., Hamilton Systems Distributors, Inc., Mid-West Circulation Corp., Southeast Literature Sales, Inc., and Southwest Literature Distributors, Inc. They had overbilled by $241,519 and the campaign was ordered to repay $222,034. The FEC decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\nLaRouche qualified to win six delegates in the Arkansas Democratic primary. A minimum of 15% vote was required and LaRouche took 22%. However, the Democratic Party refused to grant him delegates because he was ineligible to vote.\n2004\nHe waged a campaign, begun in October 2002, to have Dick Cheney dumped from the Republican ticket.\nAgain, LaRouche gained negligible electoral support. However, according to Federal Election Commission statistics, LaRouche had more individual contributors to his 2004 presidential campaign than any other candidate, until the final quarter of the primary season, when John Kerry surpassed him. As of the April 15 filing, LaRouche had 7834 individual contributions, of those who have given cumulatively, $200 or more, as compared to 6257 for John Kerry, 5582 for John Edwards, 4090 for Howard Dean, and 2744 for Dick Gephardt.\nHe ran even though his home state of Virginia is one of a handful of states which still has lifetime denial of the vote to felons, which can be overturned only on appeal to the governor. (Neither the Constitution nor federal statute law requires presidents to be registered voters.) The Democratic Party did not consider his candidacy to be legitimate and ruled him ineligible to win delegates. He gained negligible electoral support. He was endorsed by two Democratic state representatives, Erik Fleming of Mississippi and Harold James of Pennsylvania, though Fleming later called the endorsement \"the worst mistake of all.\" LaRouche was not one of the major candidates invited to the primary-season debates, although he did participate in some alternative forums for minor candidates.\nLaRouche was present in Boston during the 2004 Democratic National Convention but did not attend the convention itself. His followers sang songs insulting Democratic nominee John Kerry. Later in the campaign his followers heckled Kerry and disrupted his rallies.\nHe held a media conference in which he declared his support for John Kerry and pledged to mobilize his organization to help defeat George W. Bush in the November presidential election.\n2016\nOn October 17, 2016, LaRouchePAC advised readers to write in Lyndon LaRouche and Alexander Hamilton in the 2016 Presidential elections. In the article \"What We Need in 2016: — Alexander Hamilton's Principles, LaRouche's Four Laws\", the PAC wrote \"American citizens should write in LaRouche's name at the presidential ballot box to stand for the re-adoption of Alexander Hamilton's economic principles, as LaRouche has reclarified them. \"I'm writing in LaRouche and Alexander Hamilton, let's get the nation to elect the right principles\" will cut through the dread with which Americans are questioning each other about the approach of Election Day.\"\nThis exhortation was disseminated by PAC members through social media. No verifiable statistics have been assembled concerning vote totals.\nCampaign statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|+Lyndon LaRouche political statistics (amounts in USD)(* off year campaign activity)\n|-\n!align=left|Year!!Party!!Running mate!!Total funds raised!!Matching funds!!Campaign debt!!Primary votes!!Sources\n|-\n!align=left|1976\n|Labor||Ronald Wayne Evans\n|-\n!align=left|1980\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Dem|| || || align=right|$526,253|| || align=right|177,784||\n|-\n!align=left|1984\n|Billy Davis|| ||align=right|$494,146 ||||||\n|-\n!align=left|1988\n|Debra Freeman|| || align=right|$825,577 || ||\n||\n|-\n!align=left|1992\n|James Bevel || align=right|$2,709,531 || align=right|ineligible|| align=right|$2,223,985 || ||\n|-\n!align=left|1994*\n| || || align=right|$1,154,623 || || align=right|$2,124,099 || ||\n|-\n!align=left|1996\n|Dem || || align=right|$4,304,184 || align=right|$624,692 || align=right|$2,079,927 || align=right|496,423 ||\n|-\n!align=left|1998*\n| || || align=right|$138,424 || || align=right|$2,051,489 || ||\n|-\n!align=left|2000\n|Dem || || align=right|$4,898,362 || align=right|$1,448,389 || align=right|$2,471,918 || align=right|327,928 ||\n|-\n!align=left|2002*\n| || || align=right|$3,080,601 || || align=right|$2,360,261 || ||\n|-\n!align=left|2004\n|Dem || || align=right|$10,255,464 || align=right|$1,456,019 || align=right|$3,217,890\n|| ||\n|-\n!Total since 1990\n| || || align=right|$23,814,604 || align=right|$2,899,889 || align=right|$18,881,195 ||\n||\n|}\nCampaign committees\n* 1976 – Committee to Elect Lyndon LaRouche (1976 Committee)\n* 1980 – Citizens For LaRouche\n* 1984 – Independent Democrats for LaRouche\n* 1988 – Democrats For National Economic Recovery – LaRouche in 88\n* 1992 – Democrats For Economic Recovery-LaRouche in 92\n* 1996 – The Committee to Reverse the Accelerating Global Economic and Strategic Crisis: A LaRouche Exploratory Committee\n* 2000 – LaRouche's Committee for a New Bretton Woods\n* 2004 – LaRouche in 2004\nUnknown years\n* LaRouche Democratic Campaign\n* Texas Democrats to Draft LaRouche\n* LaRouche Campaign\nFEC cases\n* Committee to Elect Lyndon LaRouche v.
