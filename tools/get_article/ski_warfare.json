During the Battle of Oslo in 1161, Norwegian troops used skis for reconnoitering. They were also used in 1452 in Sweden, and in the 15th to 17th centuries by various other Scandinavian countries. Norwegian Captain Jens Emahusen wrote a military ski manual Skiloperegglement in 1733. In 1767, military ski competitions began. They evolved into the biathlon.\nNapoleonic Wars\nDenmark–Norway (though only Norwegian) ski troops were used against Sweden during the Gunboat War in the Napoleonic Wars.\nFile:Johannes Senn og Johan F.

France created the Briançon military ski school in 1904. The Italian Army raised 88 Alpini Battalions.  Their purpose was to fight summer and winter in the highest regions of the Alpine Arch.  Most of the battalions were dissolved after World War I. Only nine Alpini regiments remain in service today, and only four still train every soldier in ski warfare: the 4th Alpini Parachutist Regiment, 5th Alpini Regiment, 6th Alpini Regiment and 7th Alpini Regiment. France's Chasseurs Alpins, created in 1888, consisted of 12 battalions.  Currently three remain. Romanian Mountain Corps consisted of three battalions.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Army had the Kaiserjäger. German Alpenkorps was founded in 1915 with two brigades.\nThe Ottoman Empire deployed ski shock troops in the Caucasus Campaign of the WWI.\nS. V. Ivanov. Campaign of Muscovites. XVI century.

Forested, rural terrain with no roads was used by Finnish ski troops with great success against the advancing mechanized Soviet troops. In the Battle of Suomussalmi, two Soviet mechanized divisions (45,000 men) were annihilated by three Finnish regiments (11,000 men).\nGerman units included the 1st Ski Division and 6th SS Mountain Division Nord.\nItalian ski troops included the Arditi Alpieri formation, the Monte Bianco formation, the Monte Cervino battalion, and the Monte Rosa battalion. They were deployed in France, the Balkans, and the Soviet Union.\nThe Soviet Union deployed 11 ski battalions, among other troops, in November 1941 to reinforce their defenses in the Battle of Moscow.\nThe most common transportation for Norwegian soldiers during the Norwegian Campaign in 1940 was skis and sleds, and in Operation Gunnerside, paradropped Norwegian commandos covered a large distance using skis in order to reach and sabotage the heavy water plant Vemork at Rjukan in Telemark, Norway, which was being used by the Germans as part of their nuclear research programme.\nSki warfare even extended to the Middle East where the Australian Ski Corps were deployed against Vichy French forces in the mountains of Lebanon.\nThe United States Army 10th Mountain Division was established and trained for ski combat. They were deployed in Italy.\nJapanese ski troops.jpg|Imperial Japanese Army ski troops on maneuveurs in Chishima Islands, circa 1940.\nThe War in Finland, 1940 HU55566.jpg|Finnish ski troops in Northern Finland during the Winter War in January 1940.\nBundesarchiv Bild 101I-099-0735-15, Nordeuropa, Gebirgsjäger mit Narvikschild und Ski.jpg|German Gebirgsjäger with skis in 1942.\nContemporary usage\nSwedish, Finnish and Norwegian defense forces use skis in cross country skiing but also by pulling squads of soldiers with tracked transport vehicles or snow mobiles. One or two ropes hang from the end of a tracked vehicle such as the famous Swedish Hägglunds Bandvagn 206 or the Finnish Sisu Nasu and troops hang onto the ropes with their hands and ski-poles.\nMany nations train troops in skiing and winter warfare, including:\n* Austrian Army — Certain soldiers are trained in ski combat.\n* Canadian Army — Certain troops, such as Voltigeurs de Québec, are trained in winter warfare operation and skiing.
