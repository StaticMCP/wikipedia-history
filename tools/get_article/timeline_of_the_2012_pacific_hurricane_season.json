      "text": "# Timeline of the 2012 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2012 Pacific hurricane season was an above-average year in which seventeen named storms formed.|group=\"nb\"}} The hurricane season officially began on May&nbsp;15 in the east Pacific—defined as the region east of 140°W—and on June&nbsp;1 in the central Pacific—defined as the region west of 140°W to the International Date Line—and ended on November&nbsp;30 in both regions. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. This year, the first storm of the season, Tropical Storm Aletta, formed on May&nbsp;14, and the last, Tropical Storm Rosa, dissipated on November&nbsp;3.\nThe season produced seventeen tropical storms; ten became hurricanes, and five further intensified into major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} Impact during the season was relatively minimal. In late May, Hurricane Bud paralleled the western Mexico coastline before dissipating, causing minor damage and but no reported fatalities. In mid-June, Hurricane Carlotta came ashore in Oaxaca at Category&nbsp;2 hurricane intensity, making it the easternmost tropical cyclone in the basin to make landfall at hurricane intensity since 1966. The storm killed seven and caused $12.4&nbsp;million (2012&nbsp;USD) in damage.\nThis timeline includes information that was not released in real time, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.\nTimeline\nMay\nMay&nbsp;14\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One-E develops from an area of low pressure about  south of Manzanillo, Mexico.\nMay&nbsp;15\n*The 2012 Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT May&nbsp;14)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One-E intensifies into Tropical Storm Aletta.\nMay&nbsp;16\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT May&nbsp;15)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Aletta attains its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of  and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000&nbsp;mb (hPa;
