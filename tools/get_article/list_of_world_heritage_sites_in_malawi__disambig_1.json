Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Malawi accepted the convention, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2025, there are three World Heritage Sites in Malawi.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Lake Malawi National Park\n|\n| Central Region, Southern Region\n|1984\n| 289; vii, ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Chongoni Rock-Art Area\n|\n|Central Region\n|2006\n| 476rev; iii, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Mount Mulanje Cultural Landscape\n|\n|Southern Region\n|2025\n|iii, vi (cultural)\n|\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Malawi maintains five properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Nyika National Park\n|\n|Northern Region\n| align=\"center\" |2000\n|(mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Khulubvi And Associated Mbona Sacred Rain Shrines\n|\n|Southern Region\n| align=\"center\" |2011\n|iii, v (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Malawi Slave Routes and Dr. David Livingstone Trail\n|\n|Central Region\n| align=\"center\" |2011\n|iii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Lake Chilwa Wetland\n|\n|Southern Region\n| align=\"center\" |2011\n|ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Vwaza Marsh Wildlife Reserve\n|\n|Northern Region\n| align=\"center\" |2011\n|iii, v, viii, ix, x (mixed)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
