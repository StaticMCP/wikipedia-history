Based in Manchester, it was originally named the National Union of Shop Assistants, and the following year, 1893 it became the National Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks.  Its membership grew rapidly, from just under 1,300 in 1893 to more than 7,500 in 1900.  During this period, it relocated its headquarters to London, merged in 1898 with the United Shop Assistants Union, and adopted its final name.\nIn 1910, the union had more than 21,000 members, including 3,000 women, and was the second largest union of retail workers, after the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees.  It continued to expand, merging with the National Association of Grocers Assistants in 1920 and the Dental Assistants Union in 1921.  It built up a branch in Dublin, but this left in 1921 to merge with the Irish Drapers' Assistants Association, forming the Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks.\nIn 1946, the union merged with the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers to form the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers.\nNotable figures associated with the union include assistant general secretary Margaret Bondfield, and president James Seddon.\nElection results\nThe union sponsored Labour Party candidates in several Parliamentary elections, many of whom won election.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
