Total time spent in office since the beginning of his term: .]]\n|}\nThis is a list of presidents of Romania by time in office. This is based on the difference between dates; if counted by number of calendar days all the time periods would be one day greater.\nThe political party column in the table below denotes the political party or political alliance that sustained/supported their candidacy, as the president is legally forbidden by the Romanian constitution to be a member of any party while still in office. The first exception was Nicolae Ceaușescu, who was president under a different constitution, and who consequently was both a member of the PCR and president of Romania at the same time. Ion Iliescu also held party leader positions during his first term (1989–1992). The third exception is Nicușor Dan, who was the only president who did not officially belong to any political party at the time of his inauguration.\nBoth Nicolae Ceaușescu and Ion Iliescu won presidential elections three times, but Iliescu's last two terms were non-consecutive, and Ceaușescu was never popularly elected (being elected by the Great National Assembly). Emil Constantinescu was the only president to hold the office for a single term, and did not seek re-election. Traian Băsescu was the only president to date to be suspended/impeached twice (once in each of his two mandates, more specifically in 2007 and 2012). Klaus Iohannis was the only president who resigned from his post (2025).\nIf the president's term ends prematurely within five years, they are replaced by the President of the Senate, who serves as acting president until the inauguration of a new popularly elected candidate. Since the Romanian revolution of December 1989 this has happened three times; with Nicolae Văcăroiu (2007), Crin Antonescu (2012) and Ilie Bolojan (2025) filling the office temporarily.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=80%\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n! width=15%| Nº in office\n!
