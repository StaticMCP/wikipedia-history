Led by Jan Žižka, the Hussites besieged the army of Royalist crusaders. The Roman Catholic crusaders were no match for the Hussites and Německý Brod was quickly taken and sacked. More than 500 mercenaries (548 according to the chronicles) drowned as they fled across the frozen Sázava River. During Žižka's dealings with the crusaders, part of his troops invaded Německý Brod, burned down almost the entire town and killed about 1,000–2,000 inhabitants, which was the majority of the population at the time.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of Nemecky Brod\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Německý Brod"
