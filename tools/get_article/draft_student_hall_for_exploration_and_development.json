It houses various collaborative workspaces, makerspaces, classrooms, and performing arts facilities, and is intended to serve as a central hub for innovation and interdisciplinary learning at the university.\nHistory\nPlanning\nThe SHED was originally conceived by RIT President David Munson, with the goal of creating a central space on campus that would foster innovation and collaboration among students of different disciplines. This proposed building was known at this time as the Innovative Maker and Learning Complex (IMLC).\nInitial plans for construction gave an estimated cost of over million. An initial million for the project was provided by alumnus Austin McChord, as part of a million donation to the university. The glass-box theater was funded through a million donation by Frank and Ruth Sklarsky. The remainder of the construction was financed through the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York.\nAs part of his donation, McChord requested that RIT students be allowed to name the building themselves. A contest to select the final name of the complex was organized by the RIT Student Government, narrowing 260 names that were submitted down to seven finalists that were then put to a campus-wide vote. The winning name, \"Student Hall for Exploration and Development,\" abbreviated as \"the SHED,\" was announced in April 2021. Jonathan Dharmadi, the student who proposed the name, stated that it is intended to give the impression of a \"raggedy old place in your backyard\" that contrasts with the grand scale of the building and its activity.\nConstruction\nThe site of the SHED was previously an open field between the Wallace Library and the Student Alumni Union complex. The Tiger Statue, a prominent campus landmark that was previously located in the field, was relocated to a temporary perch near Global Village for the duration of construction. As part of the construction process, Wallace Library was also significantly renovated and expanded, with connections to the SHED on all levels. In preparation for the renovations, the library's circulating collection was temporarily moved to the Ritter Ice Arena in 2020.\nConstruction of the SHED began in 2020. The building was designed by the architectural firms William Rawn Associates and HBT Architects, and the project was managed by construction firm LeChase Construction. Construction was largely complete by the start of the 202324 academic year, and the first classes were held in the building that fall. During the final stages of construction, the Tiger Statue was returned to its original location in front of the SHED.\nDedication\nThe building was dedicated on October 12, 2023, during RIT's annual Brick City Homecoming and Family Weekend. The dedication ceremony included remarks from President Munson, Austin McChord, and other university officials.\nArchitecture\nThe SHED is a six-story building with a modern architectural style. The complex is divided into an eastern wing adjacent to Monroe Hall, and a larger western wing adjacent to the Wallace Library. These are connected by two glass-enclosed skybridges that form a ring-shaped circulation on the first floor. The western wing contains a large glass atrium that spans the height of the building, with classrooms and makerspaces surrounding.\nThe SHED was designed to make significant use of natural light, with extensive use of glass walls and open spaces throughout the building. This design contrasts with the brutalist style and heavy use of orange brick that characterizes many of the university's older buildings.\nFacilities\nThe building's ground floor (referred to as the \"A-level\") contains a large open-plan workshop space with tools and equipment for woodworking, metalworking, 3D printing, laser cutting, and other fabrication activities. The atrium contains studios for engineering, virtual reality, digital fabrication, music production and rehearsal. Additional makerspaces include a 3D printing lab, materials library, and a combined textile and electronics lab. Seven of the university's competitive performance teams also have dedicated spaces in the building, including electric vehicle, robotics, steel bridge, and high-power rocketry.\nThe SHED also houses a 180-seat \"glass-box\" theater, with two walls made of glass with integrated louvers for shading and light control. Adjacent to the theater is a dance studio with a sprung floor and mirrored walls. An ensemble studio for performing arts groups, a music instructional studio, and a recording studio are also available for student use, along with multiple practice rooms for individual musicians.\nThe building contains twenty-seven classrooms with technology to support audiovisual education. These include twenty-two standard classrooms, four larger \"active classrooms\" with flexible seating, and one tiered lecture hall with seating for 144 students.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
