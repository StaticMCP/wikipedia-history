The Democratic-Republican ticket of the U.S. secretary of state James Monroe and the governor of New York Daniel D. Tompkins was elected unopposed. The Federalist Party failed to nominate a candidate. In the national election, Monroe easily defeated the senior U.S. senator from New York Rufus King, who received 34 votes from unpledged electors despite not being a candidate.\nGeneral election\nSummary\nTennessee chose eight electors from as many single-member electoral districts. Returns from the election have been lost. In several districts, multiple candidates ran pledged to Monroe and Tompkins.\n}}\n| percentage =\n}}\n| percentage = 100.00\n}}\nResults by district\nRobert Allen, James Baxter, Samuel Buchanan, David Campbell, Alfred M.

Carter was elected from the 1st district, apparently without opposition; Huntsman defeated John W. Simpson in the 4th district race; while MacClanahan defeated Edward Ward in the 6th district.
