It is part of the genus Helogale, along with the Ethiopian dwarf mongoose.\nCharacteristics\nThe common dwarf mongoose has soft fur ranging from yellowish red to very dark brown. It has a large pointed head, small ears, a long tail, short limbs and long claws. With a body length of  and a weight of , it is Africa's smallest member of the order Carnivora.\nDistribution and habitat\n, South Africa]]\nThe common dwarf mongoose ranges from East to southern Central Africa, from Eritrea and Ethiopia to the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in the Republic of South Africa. It inhabits primarily dry grassland, open forests and bushland up to an elevation of . It is especially common in areas with many termite mounds, its favorite sleeping place. It avoids dense forests and deserts.\nSubspecies\n*Helogale parvula parvula\n*Helogale parvula ivori\n*Helogale parvula mimetra\n*Helogale parvula nero\n*Helogale parvula ruficeps\n*Helogale parvula undulatus\n*Helogale parvula varia\nBehaviour and ecology\nThe common dwarf mongoose is a diurnal animal. Dwarf mongooses are territorial, and each group uses an area of approximately 30-60 hectares (depending on the type of habitat). They sleep at night in disused termite mounds, although they occasionally use piles of stones, hollow trees, etc. The mongooses mark their territory with anal gland and cheek gland secretions and latrines. Territories often overlap slightly, which can lead to confrontations between different groups, with the larger group tending to win.\nThe main predators of dwarf mongoose are predatory birds such as raptors and marabou storks, reptiles such as snakes and monitor lizards, and other carnivorous mammals such as jackals and larger mongooses.\nA mutualistic relationship has evolved between the dwarf mongoose and hornbills, in which hornbills seek out the mongooses in order for the two species to forage together, and to warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators.\nSocial structure\nIt is a social animal, with an average group size of twelve individuals, but larger packs can exceed thirty members. Packs are organized around a strict hierarchy, with females holding higher positions than males within each age class. Each pack is structured around a single breeding pair, the breeding female of which holds the highest social position while her mate holds the second highest. Younger members and immigrant individuals do not typically reproduce, but instead care for and feed juveniles. Other females may reproduce during good conditions, but their litters rarely survive to adulthood. The breeding pair of a dwarf mongoose colony is given priority access to food and protection from subordinate members, and rarely has to defend against predators. The breeding male is most often responsible for suppressing reproduction among other colony members by confronting them directly when this is attempted, typically with a low-intensity threat posture, which causes the pair to cease their attempted reproduction and retreat. The female of the pair often grooms the alpha male afterwards as an appeasement behavior.\nDispersal and the funding of new packs are relatively rare, and group splits occur most often when the dominant female dies. Non-breeders occasionally transfer between different packs, typically at their second or third year of age and during the rain season, which can result in their obtaining a shorter \"queue\" for becoming part of the breeding pair of the new pack.\nReproduction and life history\nDwarf mongooses tend to breed during the wet season, between November and May, where the breeding female may produce up to three litters, containing an average of four pups each after a gestation period of 49 to 53 days. The pups nurse for a period of 45 days, during which they may be nursed by subordinate females. Juveniles begin foraging alongside adults at around six weeks of age, and reach sexual maturity at three years of life. Their maximum lifespan is around 18 years.\nDiet\nThe primary diet of the common dwarf mongoose consists of invertebrates, chiefly insects such as beetle larvae, termites, grasshoppers and crickets, alongside spiders and scorpions. Secondary food sources include small vertebrates, eggs, and fruit.\nPublications\n* Anne Rasa: Mongoose Watch: A Family Observed, John Murray, 1985, .\n* Anne Rasa: \"[https://archive.org/details/sim_naturwissenschaften_1973-06_60_6/page/303 Intra-familial sexual repression in the dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula)]\" in Die Naturwissenschaften, Volume 60, Number 6, p.&nbsp;303-304, Springer, 1973.\nReferences"
