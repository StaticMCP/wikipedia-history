Kassa's forces won the battle.\nThe popularity of Kassa continued to grow as he defeated several chiefs one after another, including Dejazmach Birru Goshu, Birru Aligaz and Belew. Birru Aligaz and Belew were defeated in the battle of Taqussa, that enraged Ras Ali. Finally, Ras Ali and Kassa fought the battle in Ayshal. The charges of the Oromo cavalry were only smashed because of Kassa's personal bravery and because of the devotion of his Amhara followers. When it became apparent that Kassa was about to be victorious, Ras Ali was among the first to flee from the battlefield, heading to Yeju. According to traditional Ethiopian history, the battle of Ayshal marks the end of the Zemene Mesafint.\nReferences"
