Noted for his ruckwork and strong marking skills, Edwards rested in the backline. His career highlight was playing in the Bulldogs' 1954 premiership side.\nFour consecutive generations, namely his father in law Frank \"Dolly\" Aked (Footscray), his son Allan Edwards (Richmond, Collingwood and Footscray) and two grandsons Jake Edwards (Carlton) and Shane O'Bree (Brisbane and Collingwood) have all played at the elite level of AFL/VFL football.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
