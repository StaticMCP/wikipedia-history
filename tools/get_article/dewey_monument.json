Union Square is bounded by Geary, Powell, Post and Stockton Streets.  The monument is dedicated to Admiral George Dewey and commemorates his victory in the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War.  Work on the monument began in 1901 and it was dedicated in 1903.\nHistory and description\nThe monument was erected to honor Admiral George Dewey, a hero of the Spanish–American War, for his victory in the Battle of Manila Bay.\nOn May 23, 1901, President William McKinley visited San Francisco to break ground for the monument. Six months later McKinley was assassinated and was succeeded by his vice president, Theodore Roosevelt. On May 14, 1903, Roosevelt officially dedicated the monument, which \"commemorates the victory of Admiral George Dewey and the American fleet over Spanish forces at Manila Bay, the Philippines, on May 1, 1898, during the Spanish–American War\" and also is a tribute to the sailors of the United States Navy.\nRobert Ingersoll Aitken was hired to sculpt a  statue representing Nike, the ancient Greek Goddess of Victory in honor of McKinley and Dewey. The statue holds a trident that represents Dewey and a wreath that represents McKinley. There are several stories about who modeled for Aitken's statue. One story holds that Aitken hired Alma de Bretteville (later Alma Spreckels), who he knew from the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art, to model for the statue. This version of the story was endorsed by San Francisco columnist Herb Caen and later in the Alma Spreckels biography, Big Alma. However, a 1902 San Francisco Chronicle article hailing the statue's completion and giving details on the progress of the monument states that the model who posed for the statue was Clara Petzold or Petzoldt, a popular artists' model in San Francisco at that time.\nArchitect Newton Tharp designed the base and column within a budget of $45,000. The column, over  in diameter and over  in height, was assembled from individual blocks weighing . Timbers over  long were shipped from Oregon to support the block and tackle system used to construct the monument.\nThe column stands on a square base with inscriptions on each side.\nDewey_Monument,_Union_Square_SF_base_4.JPG|American squadron at Manila Bay: Olympia (flagship), Baltimore, Raleigh, Boston, Concord, Petrel, McColloch.On May 14, 1903, this monument was dedicated by President Theodore Roosevelt.\nDewey_Monument,_Union_Square_SF_base_3.JPG|Secretary of the Navy John D.
