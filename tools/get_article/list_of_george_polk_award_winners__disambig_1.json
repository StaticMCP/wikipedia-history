JohnsonRebecca WoolingtonEli Murray\n|Tampa Bay Times\n|For reports (\"funded in part by PBS' ''Frontline's Local Journalism Initiative\") that exposed \"unsafe conditions\" at a lead-smelting factory; the conditions \"endangered low-wage employees working with inadequate protection from the effects of lead dust and other toxic chemicals.\"\n|-\n|State Reporting\n|Carol Marbin MillerDaniel Chang\n|Miami Herald''\n|\"Birth & Betrayal,\" a series of reports exposing the consequence of a 1988 law designed to shelter medical providers from lawsuits by funding lifelong care for children severely disabled by birth-related brain injuries, and how an agency responsible for \"stewarding\" nearly $1.7 billion in funds \"repeatedly refused pleas for care.\"\n|-\n|International Reporting\n|Ian Urbina\n|The New Yorker\n|Award for an article revealing that \"the European Union equipped and trained Libyans to intercept migrants from sub-Saharan Africa at sea and hold them in secret prisons.\" During their reporting, Urbina and his team were seized, detained, beaten, and interrogated by Libyan agents at a \"black site\" for 6 days.\n|-\n|Medical Reporting\n|Adam FeuersteinMatthew HerperDamian Garde\n|STAT\n|Reports revealing \"covert lobbying\" of the Food and Drug Administration by Biogen, which led to the FDA overruling its own scientific advisors \"to grant approval for Biogen's new and costly treatment for Alzheimer's disease despite questionable trial results.\"\n|-\n|Business Reporting\n|Jeff Horwitz\n|The Wall Street Journal\n|\"The Facebook Files,\" a series that exposed how the social media company and its top executives \"ignored internal findings\" and rejected fixes to company practices promoted extremism and divisiness, endangered teenage girls to negative discussions of body image and emotional health, and protected drug cartels — all out of fears that \"political friction\" and profitability would decrease were those fixed put into place.\n|-\n|Environmental Reporting\n|David MuirAlmin KaramehmedovicEsther Castillejo\n|ABC News\n|Award for \"The Children of Climate Change,\" a series airing on World News Tonight and Nightline that showed \"how global warming led to a famine devastating a remote, drought-stricken region of Madagascar.\"\n|-\n|Magazine Reporting\n|Sarah Stillman\n|The New Yorker\n|Award for “The Migrant Workers Who Follow Climate Disasters,” which explored how federal contractors benefitted from \"the multi-billion-dollar disaster recovery industry\" while putting the lives their employees, many of whom are undocumented immigrants or foreign guest workers, at risk.\n|-\n|Military Reporting\n|Azmat KahnDave PhillipsEric Schmitt\n|The New York Times\n|Award for exposing \"a record of deadly errors\" that led to \"intelligence failures and civilian deaths associated with Middle East air strikes.\"\n|-\n|Political Reporting\n|Linda SoJason Szep\n|Reuters\n|Award for reports uncovering \"widespread intimidation efforts by acolytes of Donald Trump to undermine the electoral process by threatening and vilifying poll workers and government officials in 16 states,\" and how those aggrieved by such false narratives made threats against election officials (and were prosecuted for doing so).\n|-\n|Technology Reporting\n|\n|Forbidden Stories NetworkWashington PostThe Guardian\n|Award for \"The Pegasus Project,\" reporting that revealed how spywear sold by NSO Group was used to tap into the phones of business executives, human rights activists, journalists, and politicians.\n|-\n|Local Television Reporting\n|Dave Biscobing\n|KNXV-TV/Phoenix, AZ\n|\"Politically Charged\", a series of reports that revealed how police and prosecutors fabricated, yet testified as real, the existence of a street gang \"in order to convince a grand jury to authorize surveillance of political protestors.\"\n|-\n|National Television Reporting\n|A. C. Thompson\n|ProPublicaPBS FrontlineBerkeley Investigative Reporting Program\n|Award for \"American Insurrection,\" which examined the emboldening of far-right extremist activity across the United States.\n|-\n|Foreign Television Reporting\n|Clarissa Ward\n|CNN\n|Award for \"real-time coverage\" of the \"rapid rise\" of Taliban forces as U.S. Troops withdrew from Afghanistan.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"18\" |2020\n|Foreign Reporting\n|David Culver\nYong Xiong\nNatalie Thomas\n|CNN\n|\"for giving much of the world its first on-the-scene look at the dangers posed by the coronavirus and the Chinese efforts to control its spread. Tapping into independent sources they developed during a trip to Wuhan that was cut short when the government ordered a lockdown of the city, the CNN crew did much of its early reporting from an enforced 14-day quarantine site.\"\n|-\n|Science Reporting\n|Ed Yong\n|The Atlantic\n|\"for his clear and insightful analysis of factors behind the spread of COVID-19 and failed efforts to bring it under control. Yong’s March 25 account, “How the Pandemic Will End,” correctly predicted its inordinately severe impact in the U.S., a circumstance his August 4 story, “How the Pandemic Defeated America,” explained in devastating detail.\"\n|-\n|Medical Reporting\n|Dan Diamond\n|Politico\n|\"for multiple accounts of Trump Administration interference with the Centers for Disease Control and other sources of medical and scientific expertise. Among the actions he revealed were efforts to reduce COVID-19 testing, pour $300 million into a celebrity ad campaign, send seniors $200 drug discount cards, ignore a “pandemic playbook” inherited from the Obama Administration and install a spokesman at the Department of Health and Human Services with orders to withhold or revise reports that did not hew to the official line.\"\n|-\n|Public Service Award\n|Helen Branswell\n|Stat\n|\"for relentless coverage of all aspects of the pandemic that became must reading for the medical community and the general public. From her first posting January 4 alerting readers to a “growing cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases” in Wuhan to her December 31 take on experts’ frustration over how little they knew about a new variant of the virus, Branswell tracked the spread of the virus in 161 articles — more than three a week —that were almost uniformly timely and astute.\"\n|-\n|Health Reporting\n|Staff of ProPublica\n|ProPublica\n|\"for two series examining the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on Black Americans and meatpacking workers. Using data and anecdotal evidence, a team of reporters revealed high rates of infection in Black communities because of limited access to proper medical care. In another series, reporters Michael Grabell and Bernice Yeung found global corporations exposed low-wage food handlers to conditions that caused widespread Covid-19 outbreaks, even lobbying the federal government to declare them essential workers.\"\n|-\n|Oral History\n|Eli Saslow\n|The Washington Post\n|\"for “Voices from the Pandemic,” 25 compelling personal narratives he crafted based on extensive interviews with individuals deeply affected by the virus. Saslow chose each to represent a segment of the American populace coping with grief, fear, guilt, bitterness, frustration, tension, dejection and other emotions, relating their stories in their own words while keeping his role invisible to the reader.\"\n|-\n|Military Reporting\n|Matthias Gafni\nJoe Garofoli\nTal Kopan\n|San Francisco Chronicle\n|\"for disclosing the Pentagon’s punishment of Navy Captain Brett Crozier who sought to evacuate nearly 5,000 sailors in tight quarters aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt to protect them from exposure to Covid-19. The Chronicle story forced the Acting Navy Secretary to resign and called into question the military’s approach to the pandemic. In the end a crewmember died and a thousand others tested positive for the virus, including Crozier, who lost his command, was almost reinstated and finally lost it for good.\"\n|-\n|Magazine Reporting\n|Katie Engelhart\n|The California Sunday Magazine\n|\"for “What Happened in Room 10?”. Focusing on one room in the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Washington, scene of the nation's first deadly COVID-19 outbreak, which led to 46 deaths, Engelhart's seamless 17,000-word narrative was at once riveting storytelling and a deft analysis of what went so wrong in nursing homes across the country.\"\n|-\n|National Reporting\n|Luke Mogelson\n|The New Yorker\n|\"for three magazine articles putting his extensive experience as a foreign war correspondent to use with firsthand accounts of domestic upheaval that sometimes turned violent. He produced probing portraits of Black Lives Matter activists in Minneapolis, anti-lockdown militia members in Michigan and competing left and right militants on the streets of Portland.\"\n|-\n|Local Reporting\n|Staff of the Star Tribune\n|Star Tribune\n|\"for coverage of the death of George Floyd and its aftermath, starting with spot-on deadline work by police reporter Libor Jany and then delving into the background on Floyd and the officers indicted for killing him. Other articles explored the unsavory history of a precinct, destroyed by protestors, that was considered a breeding ground for renegade cops. The articles portrayed an ineffective police disciplinary process and reported on attempts to rethink the role of police and pick up the pieces in neighborhoods ravaged in the protests.\"\n|-\n|Justice Reporting\n|Staff of The Washington Post\n|The Washington Post\n|\"'George Floyd’s America,' a six-part series by a team of Washington Post reporters illustrating how uncanny a match Floyd’s life and death were for the national movement he came to symbolize, has won the award for Justice Reporting. Based on more than 150 interviews, the Post series detailed how entrenched poverty, structural racism, inferior education, police intimidation and a rigged criminal justice system dogged Floyd’s life from beginning to end.\"\n|-\n|Television Reporting\n|Roberto Ferdman\n|VICE News\n|\"for breakthrough coverage of the shooting death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor in a “no-knock” police raid in Louisville and the investigations that followed. Their reports revealed a pattern of over-heavy police enforcement amid a culture that condoned misconduct and called into question official accounts of the raid and ensuing probes, including a highly suspect grand jury investigation.\"\n|-\n|Political Reporting\n|Stephanie McCrummen\n|The Washington Post\n|for deftly capturing Georgia’s shifting political winds in three perceptive profiles in the run- up to the election. One highlighted the conversion of a suburban woman whose turn away from President Trump presaged his ultimate defeat. Another portrayed the re-election of a 76-year-old Democrat-turned-Republican sheriff as a reflection of resistance to change in the rural South. And the third chronicled the collapse of a Democratic Congressional campaign against a far-right conspiratorialist whose outlandish views would soon make her a pariah for many colleagues on Capitol Hill.\n|-\n|Business Reporting\n|Ryan Mac\nCraig Silverman\n|BuzzFeed News\n|\"for a series demonstrating how Facebook exposes the public to disinformation, fraud and violence. They found the $800 billion social media giant was slow to remove extremist content, fired a whistleblower who determined it favored right-wing publishers and disregarded another who detailed how fake accounts were undermining the democratic process in India, Ukraine, Spain, Brazil, Bolivia and Ecuador as well as the U.S. In one egregious example, Mac and Silverman revealed that Facebook ignored 455 requests to remove an event page urging militants to bring weapons to a Wisconsin protest where two people were later shot to death.\"\n|-\n|Financial Reporting\n|Ross Buettner\nSusanne Craig\nMike McIntire\n|The New York Times\n|\"for accessing and analyzing a trove of Donald Trump’s income tax information, a reportorial coup suggesting why Trump went to such lengths to hide it from public view. They reported that in 11 years before 2017, he paid no federal income tax, benefitting from such questionable write-offs as $70,000 for hair care, over $2 million in property taxes on a family retreat and almost $800,000 in “consulting fees” paid to his daughter. Perhaps their most stinging revelation was the amount Trump remitted in each of two years he did pay tax: $750.\"\n|-\n|Local Reporting\n|Ian Shapira\n|The Washington Post\n|for laying bare overt racism at the state-supported Virginia Military Institute. Among other things, he persuaded aggrieved Black cadets to open up about their experiences at the hands of whites. His series of articles led Governor Ralph Northam (an alumnus) to order an independent investigation. They pressured VMI’s board to remove a statue of Confederate general Stonewall Jackson and forced the resignation of VMI’s superintendent, who was succeeded by the first Black to lead the 181- year-old institute.\n|-\n|Education Reporting\n|Robert Lee\nTristan Ahone\n|High Country News\n|\"for 'Land Grab Universities,' the result of a two- year investigation exploring the dark side of a federal initiative considered a hallmark achievement, the 1862 Morrill Act. The law transferred nearly 11 million acres to the states to fund the establishment of 52 land grant colleges. Nearly all that acreage, now worth an estimated half-billion dollars, was seized from 250 Indigenous nations, the magazine found. Its well-documented account sent shockwaves through campuses across the country where students and faculty demanded that institutions like MIT, Cornell and Cal-Berkeley find ways to right a 150- year-old wrong.\"\n|-\n|Special Award\n|Regina Martínez Pérez\n|Proceso\nForbidden Stories\n|Eight years after the 2012 murder of Martinez, journalists following her leads produced “The Cartel Project,” which linked politicians to drug traffickers in the state of Veracruz and discovered that she had been preparing to publish an explosive report about thousands of individuals who had mysteriously disappeared. Forbidden Stories reporters interviewed sources who had never spoken on-the-record, revealing how local authorities sabotaged the investigation into Martinez's death and put a scapegoat behind bars without proof — a tactic similar to one used by the Greek government in the aftermath of George Polk’s murder.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"15\" |2019\n|Foreign reporting\n|Azam Ahmed\n|The New York Times\n|\"for risking his safety time and again to portray the reality and impact of violence perpetrated by gangs, drug cartels and even police in firsthand dispatches from Brazil, Jamaica, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico, where he is stationed as the Times Bureau Chief.\"\n|-\n|National reporting\n|Lomi Kriel\n|Houston Chronicle\n|\"for revealing previously unreported aspects of the Trump Administration's immigration policy and tactics that extracted a heavy and sometimes lethal toll on Latin American refugees, including the continued separation of some families without apparent reason.\"\n|-\n|Metropolitan reporting\n|Staff of Newsday\n|Newsday\n|\"for Long Island Divided, a series three years in the making that exposed an endemic pattern of discrimination by suburban realtors steering homebuyers of color away from white enclaves in violation of federal and state law. It drew promises of action from officials at every level of government.\"\n|-\n|Local reporting\n|Brian M. Rosenthal\n|The New York Times\n|\"for unearthing a pernicious scheme by unscrupulous lenders to drive up the price of taxi medallions and turn huge profits by selling them to unsophisticated cab drivers with loans they could never repay, leading borrowers into financial ruin so devastating at least nine committed suicide.\"\n|-\n|International reporting\n|Mark Scheffler and Malachy Browne and the Visual Investigations Team\n|The New York Times\n|\"for using local plane spottings, satellite imagery, cockpit recordings, and Google Earth tools to map and geolocate the attacks to establish that Russian pilots in Syria bombed four hospitals, a busy commercial street, and a refugee camp, killing scores of civilians. It was one of a number of wide-ranging coups the team pulled off combining advanced technology with ground-level reporting in Venezuela, Afghanistan, Libya, North Korea and Hong Kong.\"\n|-\n|Financial reporting\n|Noah Buhayar and Caleb Melby and David Kocieniewski\n|Bloomberg News\n|\"for groundbreaking stories on how wealthy, well-connected individuals perverted the stated intention of \"opportunity zone\" incentives in the 2017 federal tax code for their own profit. The program was aimed at spurring economic growth in depressed areas, but some developers reaped tax breaks by using it for such high-end projects as a long-planned $4 billion luxury North Miami development and the construction of a Ritz-Carlton hotel in downtown Portland, Oregon.\"\n|-\n|Business reporting\n|Dominic Gates and Mike Baker and Steve Militech and Lewis Kamb\n|The Seattle Times\n|\"for first exposing the cooperative arrangements between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration that led to the approval of design changes in 737 Max jets blamed for two crashes, killing 346. Times reporters traced FAA approval of the flawed flight control system to its decision to defer to Boeing's own safety analysis, which they attributed to pressure from leaders of the company and the agency to speed production and avoid adding costs.\"\n|-\n|Environmental reporting\n|Helena Bottemiller Evich\n|Politico\n|\"for describing how a politicized Department of Agriculture ignored its own climate action plan, devoted a minuscule portion of its budget to climate change, which it acknowledges is the gravest threat to food production, and buried a study warning of lost nutrients in rice, the leading source of nutrition for 600 million people, provoking a highly regarded scientist to quit in disgust.\"\n|-\n|Military reporting\n|Craig Whitlock\n|The Washington Post\n|\"forcing the release of interviews conducted about the Afghan War as part of a five-year, $11 million federal Lessons Learned project. After Whitlock received more than 2,000 documents, including some initially withheld, he puzzled out key redactions before producing \"The Afghanistan Papers,\" which demonstrated that \"senior U.S. officials failed to tell the truth about the war in Afghanistan throughout the 18-year campaign, making rosy pronouncements they knew to be false and hiding unmistakable evidence the war had become unwinnable.\"\"\n|-\n|Justice reporting\n|Lisa Gartner\n|The Philadelphia Inquirer\n|\"for Beaten, Not Silenced, which exposed a pattern of violent physical abuse of boys housed at the Glen Mills Schools, a 193-year-old reformatory in suburban Delaware County. Gartner's reporting was so devastating that within days state officials ordered Glen Mills closed and pledged to do a better job of monitoring conditions at juvenile justice facilities across Pennsylvania.\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Political reporting\n|Chance Swaim and Jonathan Shorman and Dion Lefler\n|The Wichita Eagle\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\"for turning journalistic intuition into deep dives into public records that revealed municipal misconduct.\"\n|-\n|Luke Broadwater and staff\n|The Baltimore Sun\n|-\n|Magazine reporting\n|Lizzie Presser\n|ProPublica and The New Yorker\n|\"for The Dispossessed, an account of how speculators use legal loopholes associated with \"heirs' property\" laws in the South to seize black-owned ancestral lands, uprooting lifelong residents who assume their homes and property have been passed down to them. Especially poignant was Presser's portrait of two brothers in a North Carolina coastal town jailed for nearly eight years for refusing to leave.\"\n|-\n|Television reporting\n|John Sudworth\n|BBC News\n|\"for ''Inside China's Hidden Camps, which documented the reality of camps authorities established in Xinjiang province to indoctrinate hundreds of thousands of Muslims in an effort to erase their religion and culture. Allowed by authorities to visit one camp depicted as a model of agreeability, Sudworth used satellite photos, leaked documents and interviews with forlorn parents separated from their children to paint a very different picture.\"\n|-\n|Special Award\n|Nikole Hannah-Jones and contributors\n|The New York Times\n|\"for The 1619 Project,'' a supplement published on the 400th anniversary of the advent of American slavery, using essays by journalists and scholars to explore the role of slavery in history and its enduring effects in contemporary American society. A powerful introduction by Hannah-Jones, the project's creator and driving force, examined efforts of black Americans to advance the nation's expressed ideals of democracy, liberty and equality in the face of centuries of oppression and exclusion.\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"16\" |2018\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Special Award\n|David Ignatius and Karen Attiah\n|The Washington Post\n|\"for eloquence and resolve in demanding accountability in the wake of the gruesome murder of Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi\"\n|-\n|Madeleine Baran and Samara Freemark\n|APM Reports\n|\"for 'In the Dark: Season Two,' a compelling case for the innocence of a death-row inmate tried and convicted six times for a quadruple murder in 1996.\"\n|-\n|Local Television Reporting Award\n|Joe Bruno\n|WSOC-TV in Charlotte, N.C.\n| \"for stories on ballot tampering in a rural North Carolina Congressional race.\"\n|-\n|Foreign Television Reporting Award\n|Jane Ferguson\n|PBS NewsHour\n|\"for her graphic portrayal of a humanitarian disaster resulting from the proxy war between forces allied with Saudi Arabia and Iran in northern Yemen.\"\n|-\n|Magazine Reporting Award\n|Ben Taub\n| The New Yorker\n|  \"for a firsthand account of 'Iraq’s Post-ISIS Campaign of Revenge' by minority Sunnis against Shiites in sham trials sometimes leading to summary executions.\"\n|-\n|Environmental Reporting Award\n|Larry C.

Reporting Award\n|Kirby Dick, Amy Ziering and Amy Herdy\n|Netflix\n|for “The Bleeding Edge,” a documentary aired by Netflix linking the failure of risk-prone medical devices to lax regulation.\n|-\n|Political Reporting Award\n|David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner\n|The New York Times\n|\"for tracing President Donald Trump’s wealth to an inherited fortune and 'dubious
