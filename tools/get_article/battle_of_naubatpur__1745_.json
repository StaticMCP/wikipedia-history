It pitted the forces of the Bengal Subah, led by Nawab Alivardi Khan, against the invading Maratha army under Raghuji Bhonsle of Nagpur. The battle, fought near Muhib Alipur, northeast of Naubatpur (in present-day Bihar, India), marked a key clash in the fourth Maratha incursion into Bengal and Bihar.\nBackground\nRaghuji Bhonsle invaded Orissa, captured Cuttack, and took the governor, Durlabhram, prisoner. The Marathas then gained control of all of Orissa up to Midnapore. In the meantime, Mustafa Khan was slain in the battle of Jagdishpur on 20 June 1745. His army fled away to the village of Magror near Chainpur and Sasaram under Mustafa's son Murtaza Khan.\nAround this time, Murtaza Khan along with Buland Khan and other beleaguered Afghans, who had endured hardship in the Magror hills following Mustafa Khan's death, dispatched desperate pleas to Raghuji Bhonsle for deliverance. Raghuji encamped near Ramgarh. Deeming their alliance advantageous to his cause, he advanced in Gaya in September 1745. Raghuji arrived near Fatua, pillaged and burned Shaikhpura and numerous villages in the Tekari Raj, ultimately reaching the Son River. After fording it, he advanced to Magror, where he rescued the Afghans and recovered their property. He looted the surrounding area for two months.\nBattle\nThe combined forces of Marathas and Afghans swelling up to 14,000 or 20,000 troops proceeded towards Patna. Alivardi determined to expel the Marathas out of Bengal, left Murshidabad to Bihar at the head of 12,000 cavalry in October 1745. Upon learning of Alivardi's advance, the Marathas withdrew from Patna southward. The Nawab encamped for several days at Bankipur, to organise his army and collect supplies. He then advanced against the enemy via Naubatpur with a fully replenished army backed by formidable artillery. The Marathas, however, eschewed open battle and moved ahead of him, maintaining a distance beyond cannon range plundering villages until his forces reached Muhib Alipur,}} the site of Raghuji's encampment.\nThere the early ranks of the Bengal army, under Mir Jafar Khan and Shamshir Khan, launched a sudden attack on Raghuji. Raghuji was surrounded by rest of the Nawab's forces. The Marathas exerted themselves to rescue their leader, who ultimately escaped owing to negligence on Shamshir Khan's part, or more likely accepted bribe. Meanwhile, Alivardi advanced to join his army in punishing the Marathas. Raghuji, however, fought valiantly and held his position during eighteen days of combat, despite sustaining a chance gunshot wound to the mouth which knocked one of his tooth. A running fight continued from 14 November till 20. Two of Maratha generals, Mahimaji Baba and Sankaraji Baba, were killed on 14 and 20 November, respectively.\nAftermath\nThe Nawab's rapid march outpaced his baggage and tents, halting him for days. Envoys were sent by Nawab's wife to negotiate peace with Raghuji. Though Raghuji was amenable, Mir Habib refused and urged a dash to loot undefended Murshidabad. The Marathas doubled back toward Bengal, with Alivardi in pursuit amid severe food shortages. Alivardi's small escort at Champanagar was attacked by Raghuji. Nawab's main army to arrive and repel them in battle at Bhagalpur.\nSee also\n* First Maratha invasion of Bengal\n* Second Maratha invasion of Bengal\n* Third Maratha invasion of Bengal\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
