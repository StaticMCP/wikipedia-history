The battle, which took place during the French invasion of Egypt, allowed the invaders to suppress an uprising against their control.

A large number of works were commissioned featuring moments from French history. With his depiction of Heliopolis, Cogniet was one of many leading French painters who produced works for Versailles. He was paid three thousand Francs for the works. Today the painting remains at Versailles.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Metzger, Franziska & Sproll, Heinz .
