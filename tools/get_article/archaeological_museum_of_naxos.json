A smaller area is given over to finds from the Geometric Period and later finds, including sculpture from all periods of Naxos' history.\nWith effect from 7 January 2019, it is open from 08.00 to 15.30 daily, except Tuesdays.\nFile:AM Naxos 091354.jpg|Building of the Museum\nEntrance to the hall of Cycladic collection of the Archaeological Museum of Naxos 141363.jpg|Cases of Early Cycladic art\nCycladic female figurine violin, marble, 3200-2800 BC, AM Naxos, 143170.jpg|Violin shaped Cycladic figurine, 3200-2800 BC\nCase 13 Cycladic Collections AM Naxos, 143233.jpg|Cycladic figurines and stone vessels, Naxos, 3200-2300 BC\nEnthroned Cycladic female figurines, 3rd Millennium BC, AM Naxos (02), 111808.jpg|Enthroned Cycladic figurines, Naxos, 3rd millennium BC\nCycladic female figurine 2800-2300 BC, AM Naxos (03 6), 119850.jpg|Cycladic female figurine, Naxos, 2800-2300 BC\nCycladic figurine female 50 cm, Keros 2800-2300 BC, AM of Naxos, 119883.jpg|Cycladic female figurine, Keros, 2800-2300 BC\nCase 01 Cycladic Collections AM Naxos, 110021.jpg|Cycladic figurines and stone vessels, Naxos, 3rd millennium BC\nEarly Cycladic marble vessel, 3000-2300 BC, AM Naxos, 110023.jpg|Cycladic marble vessel, Naxos, 3000-2300 BC\nFrying Pan, AM Naxos 143189.jpg|Cycladic \"frying-pan\", Pano Koufonisi, 2800-2500 BC\nCase 12 Cycladic Collections AM Naxos, Finds from the cemetery of Koufonisia 143235.jpg|Finds from Pano Koufonisi, 2800-2300 BC\nEarly Cycladic bronze tools and obsidian blades, 2800-2300 BC, AM Naxos, 143212.jpg| Cycladic bronze tools and obsidian blades, Naxos, 2800-2300 BC\nCycladic jewelry, 3200-2300 BC, AM Naxos, 143238.jpg| Cycladic jewellery, Naxos, 3200 – 2300 BC\nArch Museum Naxos Bügelkannen.JPG|Cases of Late Cycladic art, Mycenaean pottery, Naxos, 12th century BC\nJewelry from child grave at Kamini, 1200-1100 BC, AM Naxos, 143251.jpg|Jewellery from child grave, Kamini on Naxos, 12th century BC\nHydria Mycenaean 12 c BC fishing 110067.jpg|Mycenaean Hydria, fishing to the network, Naxos, 12th century BC\nGeometric pottery Am Naxos 110076.jpg|Room of Greek geometric pottery, 8th century BC\nTerracota boots geonmetric for statue?
