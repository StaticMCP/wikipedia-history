      "text": "# Andean culture\n\nAndean culture is a collective term used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Andes mountains especially those that came under the influence of the Inca Empire. Cultures considered Andean include:\n* Atacama people\n* Aymara people\n* Muisca people or Chibcha\n* Andean civilizations\n* Quechua people\n* Uru people\n* Diaguita people\n* Maina people\n* Mayo-Chinchipe\nThis term is also used to describe the Hispanic based cultures of the Andes, which through the interaction of the Spaniards with the Andean Natives formed into a distinct group of cultures incorporating both Hispanic and Indigenous cultural traits, although such a definition excludes the contribution of other human groups and ethnicities inhabiting in the Andean mountains, such as non Andean indigenous groups, African diaspora in the Americas or Asian immigrants. These cultures include:\n* Culture of Bolivia\n* Culture of Chile\n* Colombian culture\n* Culture of Ecuador\n* Argentine Northwest\n* Culture of Peru"
