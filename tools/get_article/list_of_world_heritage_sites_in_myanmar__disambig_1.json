Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Myanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and also called Burma, ratified the convention on 29 April 1994.\n, Myanmar has two sites on the list: Pyu Ancient Cities were listed in 2014 and Bagan in 2019. Both sites are cultural. In addition, Myanmar has 15 sites on its tentative list.\n__TOC__\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria.
