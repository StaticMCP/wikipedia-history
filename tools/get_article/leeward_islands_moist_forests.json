The forested areas are typically in the core interior of the islands, and at the higher elevations of the volcanic islands.  Non-forested lower elevations in the region receive less rainfall and are typically semi-arid.  A notable feature of the ecoregion is its position in the main hurricane track.  The frequent damage to trees produces in many places an uneven forest canopy, and an opening of the canopy that allows more pre-climax trees to grow.\nLocation and description\nThe island groups with forests making up this ecoregion are:\n* United States Virgin Islands (US) - western portion of the islands\n* British Virgin Islands (UK) - western portion of the islands\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis - the forested areas\n* Antigua and Barbuda - a small portion of southern Antigua\n* Montserrat (UK) - the central, mountainous areas\n* Guadeloupe (Fr) - about 85% of Basse Terre, the western island\nThere are also small patches of moist forest on the smaller islands in the region.  The Leeward Islands are formed on two arcs; the inner (western) arc features active volcanos and higher precipitation; the outer arc tend towards limestone-capped submerged volcanos and less precipitation.\nClimate\nThe ecoregion has a Tropical climate with individual islands having different levels of precipitation that classify them into either Tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification (Af)), Tropical savanna climate - dry winter (Köppen climate classification (Aw)), or Tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification (Am)).\nFlora and fauna\n, an endemic snake specie of Leeward Island]]\nLike many island chains, there are many endemic species in the ecoregion.  Species diversity and endemism are higher on the larger islands, and those farther from the mainland, such as Guadeloupe.  There are small patches of most forest on the smaller islands, such as Saba, and for this ecoregion the term 'moist forest' includes areas that might also be classified as rain forest or cloud forest.  Common species are those of genus Miconia and Clusia.  In less disturbed areas the common species is Dacroydes excelsa.  At higher elevations, palm trees are common, such as the  mountain cabbage palm Prestoea acuminata var. montana.\nThe most common mammals in the ecoregion are bats; the ten recorded species include the endangered Guadeloupe big brown bat (Eptesicus guadeloupensis) and the vulnerable Thomas's yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira thomasi).\nProtected areas\nOver 76% of this ecoregion (the forested areas, not the entire islands) is in an officially protected area, including:\n* Virgin Islands National Park, in the US Virgin Islands\n* Guadeloupe National Park, in Gaudeloupe\n* Centre Hills (Forest Reserve on Montserrat)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
