Brackenville is located at the intersection of Brackenville Road and Old Wilmington Road, east of Hockessin.\nIn 1809, William Brackend bought land along the road running from Wilmington to Lancaster. With the  opening of the Wilmington Turnpike (Lancaster Pike) in 1818, he opened a hotel named the \"Peace and Plenty\". The hotel stood on the northwest corner of Old Lancaster Pike and Brackenville Road; it was demolished before 1937.\nReferences"
