Announced in December 2016, the awards were first presented in January 2017. Crunchyroll describes it as a \"global event that recognizes the anime shows, characters, and artists that fans around the world love most.\"\nThe Anime Awards were originally held in California in the United States. In 2023, the Awards moved to the Grand Prince Hotel New Takanawa in Tokyo, Japan for the 7th ceremony and have been held there ever since. The most recent ceremony was the 9th ceremony, held on May 25, 2025, where Solo Leveling won the Anime of the Year award.\nProcess\nThe awards have two rounds of voting. Initially, each judge will submit up to five potential candidates for each category. Six candidates that received the highest amount of nominations from this round will be included in the final list for the next round, which is a one-week public voting. Winners for each category are determined by the most amount of judge and public votes weighted in a 70:30 ratio respectively since at least the 6th edition.\nFor the first six editions of the awards, any anime that was produced primarily in Japan and released legally on television, cinema, or online from January to December of the previous year were eligible for nomination. The eligibility period was changed for the 7th and 8th editions, from October of the previous two years (Fall season) to September of the previous year (Summer season). However, in December 2024, Crunchyroll announced that starting from the 10th edition onwards, the eligibility period will return to its previous format of eligibility from January to December, with the eligibility period for the 9th edition covering October 2023 to December 2024 to accommodate the change in format. Eligible nominations for non-Japanese VA Performance are based on the initial release of the dub irrespective of when the anime was originally released.\nThe set of categories that will be presented varies for each edition, with categories added, removed, or otherwise renamed. The 9th edition, for example, featured 32 categories.\nCategories\nCurrent\nCrunchyroll announced the categories for each edition around December.

Its inaugural ceremony in 2017, saw allegations of possible voting fraud after the sports series Yuri on Ice won all of its seven nominations including Anime of the Year. The win caused a controversy among Crunchyroll users, who accused fans of the series for rigging the vote in a heavily aggressive campaign. Following this, Crunchyroll responded by adjusting the awards system, introducing a new weighting system favoring jury in an attempt to minimize the effect of popular shows sweeping the awards. This change stopped the extremely popular superhero series My Hero Academia from unexpectedly losing the Anime of the Year to Made in Abyss in the following edition.\nThe bias towards popular shows have been noted by several publications, including those who are part of the jury itself. In a reflection piece after the 8th edition, Animehunch opined that due to its design, the awards favor popularity over merit, noting that Vinland Saga was a far better recipient of Anime of the Year than the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen. This is reflected again in the following edition, where the extremely popular anime adaptation of the manhwa series Solo Leveling won the Anime of the Year over the critically-acclaimed Frieren: Beyond Journey's End''. The decision led some viewers to question whether the awards were prioritizing hype and recency bias over artistic merit. Meanwhile, despite receiving 16 nominations, Netflix's Delicious in Dungeon did not win a single award. This outcome led to speculation about a potential bias against non-Crunchyroll platforms, with many fans questioning whether the series was deliberately overlooked, though Devilman Crybaby and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, both released on Netflix, won the award in 2019 and 2023 respectively.\nLack of diversity in nominations\nThe lack of diversity in the nominations was also criticized: 29 of the 32 award winners were works whose originals were published in Weekly Shōnen Jump; of the nine voice acting categories, four went to voice actors who voiced Denji from Chainsaw Man, while only one female voice actress won an award: she voiced Power from the same series. In an article in the This Week in Anime section on Anime News Network, in which editors Steve Jones and Nicholas Dupree had a sarcastic argument, they concluded that this award show was not for animators or translators, but for the bosses who collect the revenue from the franchises. In this context, the award for the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen was viewed critically in various categories, as the animation studio had been criticized in the past for its poor working conditions.\nSee also\n* List of animation awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
