She is in charge of financial management and is head of the regional administration. It is also her role to ensure the direction of the patrimony (for example the secondary schools) and to represent the institution with the national and European organisms.\nShe has numerous functions: convening and chairing meetings, preparing and carrying out deliberations, signing conventions and acting as legal representative of the institution. If necessary, the president can delegate some of his functions to his vice-presidents.\nThe president of the regional council is assisted by 10 vice-presidents entrusted with different missions.
