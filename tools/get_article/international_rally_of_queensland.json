      "text": "# International Rally of Queensland\n\nThe International Rally of Queensland, known previously as Rally Queensland, is a rallying event held in the Gympie Region of Queensland, Australia run by the Brisbane Sporting Car Club. The rally was based for most of its out of the state capital Brisbane but in more recent times has moved north along the coast to various centres in the Sunshine Coast area. The rally begins in Caloundra before moving inland to forest roads in near Imbil and Kandanga. The rally was first held in 1968 as part of the original Australian Rally Championship and has been part of the ARC ever since.\nWith the end of the Rally of Canberra in 2008 and the Western Australian government ceasing its funding of Rally Australia in 2006 both the World and Asia-Pacific Rally Championships were both looking for new venues. Rally Queensland was selected for APRC duties and became the International Rally of Queensland in 2009.\nIn 2013, a competitor died after his car crashed in the Imbil State Forest.\nList of winners\nSourced in part from:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year!!Winner!!Car\n|-\n| 2000\n|  Possum Bourne\n| Subaru Impreza WRX\n|-\n| 2001\n|  Possum Bourne\n| Subaru Impreza WRX\n|-\n| 2002\n|  Possum Bourne\n| Subaru Impreza WRX\n|-\n| 2003\n|  Cody Crocker\n| Subaru Impreza WRX\n|-\n| 2004\n|  Chris Atkinson\n| Subaru Impreza WRX\n|-\n| 2005\n|  Cody Crocker\n| Subaru Impreza WRX STi\n|-\n| 2006\n|  Simon Evans\n| Toyota Corolla Sportivo\n|-\n| 2007\n|  Simon Evans\n| Toyota Corolla Sportivo\n|-\n| 2008\n|  Neal Bates\n| Toyota Corolla S2000\n|-\n| 2009\n|  Simon Evans\n| Mitsubishi Lancer Evo IX\n|-\n| 2010\n|  Simon Evans\n| Subaru Impreza WRX STi\n|-\n| 2011\n|  Mark Higgins\n| Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X\n|-\n| 2012\n|  Chris Atkinson\n| Škoda Fabia S2000\n|-\n| 2013\n|  Eli Evans\n| Honda Jazz\n|-\n| 2014\n|  Jan Kopecký\n| Škoda Fabia S2000\n|-\n| 2015\n|  Pontus Tidemand\n| Škoda Fabia S2000\n|}\nSee also\n*Motorsport in Australia\n*Sport in Queensland\nReferences"
