Baker Award for Initiatives in Research, previously the NAS Award for Initiatives in Research, is awarded annually by the National Academy of Sciences \"to recognize innovative young scientists and to encourage research likely to lead toward new capabilities for human benefit. The award is to be given to a citizen of the United States, preferably no older than 35 years of age. The field of presentation rotates among the physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics.\"\nThe award was established in 1981 in honor of William O. Baker by AT&T Bell Laboratories and is supported by Lucent Technologies.\nRecipients\nSource: [http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/initiatives-in-research.html National Academy for Sciences]\n*Benjamin Recht (2015, statistics and machine learning) For his significant contributions at the confluence of optimization, signal processing and statistics, including seminal work on matrix completion.\n*Garnet Kin-Lic Chan (2014, numerical simulations in condensed matter and materials) For pioneering research in the field of numerical simulation of highly correlated quantum systems in chemistry and physics, particularly for his development of density matrix renormalization group methods and the density matrix embedding theory.\n*Theodore Betley (2013, catalysis) For his development and mechanistic elucidation of remarkable iron catalysts for carbon-hydrogen bond functionalization.\n*Christopher Bettinger (2012, materials science) For innovative research on advanced materials for next-generation implanted medical devices.\n*Martin T.
