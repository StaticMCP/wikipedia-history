A number of examples were built as one type and converted to another during their lifetimes. The DGA-11, powered by a nine-cylinder  Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior radial engine, was purportedly the fastest four-seat civil aircraft of the late 1930s, able to achieve a top speed of about . A favorite of the high society and Hollywood circles, the DGA-11 cost about $16,500 in 1938. These aircraft were a direct developments of the famous Howard racing plane Mister Mulligan. Designer/pilot Ben Howard's \"DGA\" prefix stood for \"Damned Good Airplane\".\nHistory\nThe DGA-6's racing success brought the DGA series much attention, and in its various permutations, differentiated mainly by different powerplants, the DGAs -8, -9, -11, -12 (and later DGA-15) emerged as coveted aircraft, owned by corporations, wealthy individuals, and movie stars, such as Wallace Beery, who was himself a pilot. Spanish conductor and pianist Jose Iturbi owned and flew a DGA-11 \"El Turia\" (NC22402). In an era when airlines were flying DC-3s, the Howards at 160 to  could match their speed and range. The rear seat exceeded airline leg room with limousine-like spaciousness. With its high wing loading, the Howards rode through most turbulence with airline-like solidity. The -11 was probably the ultimate of the series. Configured as a four-place aircraft with the  Pratt & Whitney R-985.\nWith America's entry into World War II, most of the civilian Howards were commandeered by the military. The Army used them as officer transports and as ambulance planes. They were used variously as an officer's utility transport and for instrument training. The Howard was and is an excellent instrument platform, very stable and solid, especially compared to modern light aircraft.\nA number of these aircraft still fly, and another example of a DGA-11, restored by Jim Younkin, can be seen in the Arkansas Air & Military Museum.\nVariants\nin Fayetteville, Arkansas]]\n* DGA-8 - version with Wright R-760 engine (18 built, 1 impressed by USAAF as UC-70C)\n* DGA-9 - version with Jacobs L-5 engine (7 built, 2 impressed by USAAF as UC-70D)\n* DGA-11 - version with Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior engine (4 built; several more converted from DGA-8, -9 etc.)\n* DGA-12 - version with Jacobs L-6 engine (2 built, both impressed by USAAF as UC-70A)\n* UC-70 - DGA-8/ -9/ -12 and -15 aircraft impressed into service with the USAAC as utility transports.\nSpecifications (DGA-11)\n{{Aircraft specs\n|prime units? = kts\n|ref={name of first source}\n|crew= one, pilot\n|capacity=3 passengers\n|length ft= 25\n|length in= 5\n|length m= 7.75\n|span ft= 38\n|span in= 0\n|span m= 11.59\n|height ft= 8\n|height in= 5\n|height m= 2.57\n|wing area sqft= 185\n|wing area sqm=  17.2\n|wing area note=\n|airfoil=  NACA 2R212 (reflexed)\n|empty weight lb=  2,450\n|empty weight kg= 1,111\n|gross weight lb= 4,100\n|gross weight kg= 1,860\n|max takeoff weight lb= 4,100\n|max takeoff weight kg= 1,860\n|eng1 name=Pratt & Whitney R-985\n|eng1 type=radial engine\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 hp=  400-450\n|eng1 kw=  299-336\n|max speed kts= 170\n|max speed mph=  196\n|max speed kmh=  315\n|never exceed speed mph= 288\n|stall speed mph= 69\n|range nmi= 869\n|range miles=  1,000\n|range km=  1,609\n|ceiling ft= 26,000\n|ceiling m= 7,926\n|wing loading lb/sqft=  22.2\n|wing loading kg/m2= 108\n|power/mass= 0.11 hp/lb\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\n;Notes\n;Bibliography\n*\n*\n* [http://howardaircraft.org/ Howard Aircraft Foundation website]"
