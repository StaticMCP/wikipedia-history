      "text": "# Russia's War: Blood upon the Snow__disambig_1\n\n'Russia's War: Blood upon the Snow' is a ten-part British-Russian television documentary series that explores the involvement of the Soviet Union in World War 2 while under Joseph Stalin's reign of terror, highlighting the suffering of the general population, members of the Red Army and anyone that Stalin thought might pose a threat to his power.\nThe series was released in 1995, not long after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, an event that allowed Western and Russian historians access to formerly secret Soviet archives for the first time so that the events on the Eastern Front could be better explained to Western audiences.\nThe series is narrated by English actor Nigel Hawthorne and the credits name \"Professor Richard Overy\", \"Professor Dmitri Volkogonov\" and \"Professor Mikhail Semyryaga\" as Historical Consultants. Although Volkogonov did publish books on Soviet history and had extensive access to the archives, it appears that the title \"Professor\" is honorary as it appears he did not work at a university.\nEpisodes\n, one of Stalin's bodyguards, describes the day that Stalin failed to rise during the day and how, in the early evening, one of the guards entered Stalin's private rooms and discovered him lying on the floor incapacitated. Chief guard Shtarostein(?) telephoned Malenkov who, with Beria, arrived at the dacha at 3am. Beria scolded Ligachov(?), one of the guards, saying Stalin was just sleeping and not to disturb him further. However, doctors were called and Beria told the lead doctor that failing to save him would result in the doctor being shot. Stalin died that night and a state funeral follows.\nThe Soviet people survived the loss of more than twenty million citizens in the Great Patriotic War but also millions more as a direct result of actions by their own leader. Stalin's death therefore \"embodied the hope of a better world for millions\".\n}}\n}}\nCriticism\nDr. Nick Baron an associate professor at the Faculty of Arts, University of Nottingham writes:\nHe suggests it is simplistic to say Stalin was an evil genius and that the population not sent to the gulag or the front was held in thrall by propaganda.\nHe notes some errors where the visual footage does not match what is being described, imprecise chronology, quotes used out of context and some mistranslations.\nHowever, he concludes\nBooks\nAfter the television series was released, the book ''Russia's War: Blood Upon The Snow, was published in hardback but renamed as Russia's War: A History of the Soviet Effort: 1941-1945'' in paperback.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJPTDDSM09U&list=PLoDS9Eoofuwrf31PV1TmqYaBwZ0QF-J-W&index=1 Playlist of episodes on YouTube]"
