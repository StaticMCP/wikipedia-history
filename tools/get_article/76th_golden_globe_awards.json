Because of the large viewership of NFL playoff games, this was expected to boost the Golden Globes' TV ratings, which dropped 11% between 2017 and 2018. Despite the NFL lead-in, the Golden Globes achieved a lower household rating and less total viewers than the 2018 ceremony, though the show experienced a slight increase in the 18–49 demographic.\nThe regular Golden Globes Red Carpet Preshow was livestreamed exclusively on Facebook Watch instead of airing on NBC.\nIn Memoriam\nNo \"In Memoriam\" section was broadcast on television during the ceremony, so the HFPA included a slideshow on their website, and they included the following names:\n* Penny Marshall\n* Bernardo Bertolucci\n* Stan Lee\n* Neil Simon\n* Burt Reynolds\n* R. Lee Ermey\n* Miloš Forman\n* Steven Bochco\n* Lewis Gilbert\n* John Gavin\n* John Mahoney\nSee also\n* 91st Academy Awards\n* 46th Annie Awards\n* 34th Independent Spirit Awards\n* 25th Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 24th Critics' Choice Awards\n* 23rd Satellite Awards\n* 45th Saturn Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
