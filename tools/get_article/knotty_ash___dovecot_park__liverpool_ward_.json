      "text": "# Knotty Ash & Dovecot Park (Liverpool ward)\n\nKnotty Ash and Dovecot Park ward is an electoral district of Liverpool City Council within the Liverpool West Derby constituency.\nBackground\nThe ward was created for the elections held on 4 May 2023 following a 2022 review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, which decided that the previous 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The Knotty Ash & Dovecot ward was created as a single-member ward from a portion of the former Knotty Ash ward. The ward boundaries follow East Prescot Road, between Ashover Avenue and Dinas Lane, along Page Moss Lane, Pilch Lane, behind Gordon Drive, along Thingwall Avenue, Thomas Lane, the North Liverpool Extension Line, the northern boundary of Thomas Lane Playing Fields, and Thomas Lane.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
