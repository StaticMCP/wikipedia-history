The Puerto Rican nominee was selected by the Corporación de Cine de Puerto Rico.\nPuerto Rico submitted twelve films from 1986 to 2011, and was nominated only once for What Happened to Santiago (1989).\nHowever, the territory is no longer allowed to submit films due to the Academy altering its rules in the 2010s, disqualifying any film solely produced by American companies or territory protectorates.\nSubmissions\nEvery year, each country is invited by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to submit its best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nIn 2008, the producers of local box-office hit Talento de Barrio protested that they submitted their film for consideration, but that Puerto Rico's film board chose not to send a film that year.\nThe following is a list of the films submitted by Puerto Rico. All films were produced in Spanish.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n! Year(Ceremony) !!English title !! Spanish title !! Director !!
