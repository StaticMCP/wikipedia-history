It is also among the largest media organizations in Asia and the Pacific region and a regular member of the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. Its head is appointed directly by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nWith 13,000 employees and branches in 20 countries worldwide, including Italy, France, Belgium, Guyana, Malaysia, Lebanon, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting offers both domestic and foreign radio and television services, broadcasting 12 domestic television channels, four international news television channels, six satellite television channels for international audiences, and 30 provincial television channels countrywide, half of which are broadcast in minority-status languages in Iran, such as Azerbaijani and Kurdish, as well as the local dialects of Persian. IRIB provides 12 radio stations for domestic audiences, and through the IRIB World Service, 30 radio stations are available for foreign and international audiences. It also publishes the Persian-language newspaper Jam-e Jam.\nHistory\nBefore the 1979 revolution\nOn 24 April 1940, Radio Iran was officially opened by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi – the then crown prince of Iran – with Isa Sedigh as the first head of the company. The channel broadcast five hour programs including news, traditional and western music, religious and sports programming as well as programs dedicated to economic and political discussion. according to estimates from the Statistical Center of Iran, in 1976 about 76% of urban population and 45% of rural population had access to the radio.\nNational Iranian Television officially opened on 21 March 1967 to create National Iranian Radio and Television. At that time, hardware equipment was at the disposal of the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone and its media was producing by Advertising and publishing department. In later years, radio and television expansion request across the country to create an integrated entity and from 1971 all facilities were given to National Radio and Television. The Shah personally appointed Reza Ghotbi as head of organization, and the duration of the programs increased quickly.\nBefore the 1979 revolution about 40% of TV programs were foreign, and imported and internal programs were usually modeled after foreign programs. After the revolution two TV channels (first program and second program) were active and with facility expansion, more than 95% of the urban population and about 75% of the overall population was able to receive TV signals.\nAfter the 1979 revolution\nDuring the Iranian Revolution, when Gholam Reza Azhari became prime minister of Iran, Touraj Farazmand was chosen for head of National Iranian Radio and Television after Reza Ghotbi.\nThe organization expanded greatly after the revolution, and in addition to internal and global broadcasting channels, it manages more than 100 electronic and written media.\nA broadcasting budget of 4,000 billion Tomans was expected in the 2018 budget bill. However, according to Ali Asgari (the organization manager), a channel budget like that of BBC Persian consists of over 6,000 billion Tomans and IRIB needs a larger budget for managing 62 TV channels and 83 radio channels.\nIran–Israel war\nDuring the Iran–Israel war, IRIB's headquarters including the studio of Islamic Republic of Iran News Network (IRINN) in Tehran was hit by an Israeli airstrike on 16 June during a live broadcast resulting in a temporary halt in programming. Two IRIB employees, including IRINN's editor-in-chief, were killed in the attack, while the station said its offices were struck by four bombs. The attack was condemned as a war crime by the International Federation of Journalists, saying \"under international law, journalists are civilians, and deliberate attacks against them constitute war crimes\". The Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the strike.\nBroadcasting sign\nFile:National Iranian Radio & Television.jpg|Sign of National Iranian Radio and Television\nFile:IRIB Logo.svg|Sign of Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting\nThe IRIB sign includes the Emblem of the Islamic Republic at the top and two characters \"لا\". When this sign was conceived at the beginning of the revolution, it represented the revolution's slogan of \"neither Eastern, nor Western – Islamic Republic\" and thus symbolized denial of both capitalist and communist influence or specifically the United States and Soviet Union. These two words at the middle get together like a channel and there is an eye sign at the intersection of them (which was later adapted into the logo of the flagship television channel). At the bottom of the sign, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting phrase is written in Nastaliq font in the Persian language.\nOrganisational structure\nAccording to Article 175 of the Iranian constitution,\n# The freedom of expression and dissemination of thoughts in the Radio and Television of the Islamic Republic of Iran must be guaranteed in keeping with the Islamic criteria and the best interests of the country.\n# The appointment and dismissal of the head of the Radio and Television of the Islamic Republic of Iran rest with the Leader. A council consisting of two representatives each of the President, the head of the judiciary branch, and the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the Iranian parliament shall supervise the functioning of this organization.\n# The policies and the manner of managing the organization and its supervision will be determined by law.\nChannels operated by IRIB\n* IRIB TV1: Iran’s first and longest-running television channel, launched in 1958.

These networks churn out ideological products in line with the state’s Islamic gender norms, with women sometimes cast in traditional roles and deferential to men, who are portrayed as their guardians and protectors. Amid the intensified conflict with the United States, Iran’s security establishment has emerged as a major producer of blockbuster television and film centering on the prowess of the Revolutionary Guards and its intelligence services. Iran is awash in sophisticated domestic versions of “Homeland,” and lacks the self-interrogating, subversive cinema that allows a society to have a public conversation with itself about gender, culture, marriage, and power.\nAllegations of false confessions\nA study published in June 2020 by the Justice for Iran and the International Federation for Human Rights claimed that Iranian television had broadcast the potentially coerced confessions of 355 detainees since 2010. Former prisoners stated they had been beaten and been threatened with sexual violence as a means for their false confessions to be delivered for use by the country's broadcasters.\nCensorship of reformists\nIRIB, along with other Iranian state-run media, tend to censor or silence voices or opinions of reformist politicians as well as ridicule them even as the reformists are in power since IRIB's editorial bias is closer to the Supreme Leader and the Principlists.\nApril 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel\nIn April 2024, IRIB reported on the April 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel — but it actually showed footage of a fire in Chile (not Israel), filmed several months prior.\nReligious insults\nIn 1989, five IRIB employees were prosecuted over a radio report in which Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, was described as not being a suitable role model for women since she lived centuries ago. The incident reportedly resulted in lashes and purges in the agency.\nIn April 2025, four IRIB employees were arrested on charges related to the airing of a TV program insulting the Sunni caliph Abu Bakr. IRIB head Peiman Jebeli condemned the remarks as “sedition” and “unforgivable wrongdoing.”\nInternational sanctions\nUnited States\nPursuant to the United States Presidential Executive Order 13628, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting is subjected to U.S. sanctions under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act which gives the U.S. Treasury Department the authority to designate those in Iran who restrict or deny the free flow of information to or from the Iranian people.\nEuropean Union\nIRIB was placed in the list of sanctioned entities of the European Union in December 2022 due to its role in the repression of the Mahsa Amini protests. Following this order, Eutelsat ceased broadcasts of the IRIB international channels for the Europe region via Hot Bird satellite on 21 December 2022.\nSee also\n* IRIB International Conference Center\n* Mass media of Iran\n** Television in Iran\n* Censorship in Iran\n* Sobh International Media Festival\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n**  for IRIB's domestic radio services\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20090119192212/http://iribtv.ir/ Official website] for IRIB's domestic television services\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160529143315/http://worldservice.irib.ir/ Multilingual website of IRIB World Service]"
