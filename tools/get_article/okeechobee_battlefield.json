It is located four miles (6&nbsp;km) southeast of Okeechobee, on US 441/98, near Taylor Creek. The Battle of Lake Okeechobee, one of the major conflicts of the Second Seminole War, was fought at the site.  Part of the battlefield is preserved as Okeechobee Battlefield State Historic Park.\nDescription and history\nThe Okeechobee Battlefield covers an estimated  of land on the east side of Taylor Creek.  Much of the land is now agricultural, but portions of the battlefield have been developed, and it has been impacted by road construction.  The agricultural appearance of the open portions of the battlefield also differ from the time of the battle, when much of the area was overgrown with sawgrass as much as  in height.  The principal feature of the battlefield is a low hummock, which provided the Seminoles with defensive cover in the engagement.  North of this hummock, across what was originally open sawgrass, is a wooded area where Colonel Zachary Taylor made camp prior to the battle.\nWhen the battlefield was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1961, an area of  that was believed to include the \"general area\" of the battlefield was landmarked.  In the 1980s, the National Park Service commissioned more detailed studies, and performed some archaeological work in the area, to more precisely identify the battlefield area.  As a result, the landmarked area was decreased to above , most of which overlapped parts of the original designation. A marker was placed near the site in 1939, and a portion of the battlefield was purchased by the state of Florida in 2006.\nA volunteer group sponsors annual reenactments of the Battle of Lake Okeechobee as a fundraising activity for the park.\nSee also\n*List of Florida state parks\n*List of National Historic Landmarks in Florida\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Okeechobee County, Florida\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/okeechobee-battlefield-historic-state-park Okeechobee Battlefield Historic State Park] at [https://www.floridastateparks.org Florida State Parks]\n* [http://www.okeechobeebattlefield.com Friends of the Okeechobee Battlefield]\n* [http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/places/Counties/Okeechobee.cfm Okeechobee County listings] at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070507121934/http://www.flheritage.com/ Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs]\n* [http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/southern-region/okeechobee-battlefield.html Most Endangered Places (2000 listing) - Okeechobee Battlefield] at [http://www.preservationnation.org National Trust for Historic Preservation]\n* [http://www.sptimes.com/News/062700/State/Conflict_brews_over_h.shtml Conflict brews over historic site] at [http://www.sptimes.com The St. Petersburg Times Online]\n* [http://www.dep.state.fl.us/secretary/news/2006/04/0404_01.htm State to Acquire Historic Okeechobee Battlefield] at [http://www.dep.state.fl.us Florida Department of Environmental Protection]"
