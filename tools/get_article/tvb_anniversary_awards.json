Winners are awarded a copy of the golden TVB anniversary statuette, which depicts a man and a woman holding up TVB's square logo. The TVB Anniversary Awards are only one of three (four, including Asian Television Awards) TVB awards given out. The other two types of TVB awards that are given out before the anniversary awards are: TVB Star Awards Malaysia and StarHub TVB Awards (Singapore). A list of all TVB awards winners is compiled here in the TVB Awards Winners Lists.\nThe awards for Best Drama, Best Actor, and Best Actress in a TVB drama series were first presented in 1997 as the final act for the TVB Anniversary Gala, a star-studded event held every year on 19 November, TVB's anniversary day. Several more award categories were introduced in the following years. In 2006, the event became a separate awards ceremony, and is usually given in November or December of that year, until 2019 when it is held in January of the following year. Carol Cheng has been hosting the awards ceremony since 2006.\nCategories\nNominating and voting procedures have varied over the years. Winners are determined by a combination of results coming from a professional voting committee and the public. In 2023, awards titled \"Most Popular\" were retired and replaced with \"Greater Bay Area's Favourite\"; the \"Most Popular Drama Theme Song\" renamed \"Best TV Song\"; A \"Most Promising Newcomer\" category was established.\nCurrent categories\nDiscontinued categories\nTV ratings\nAll results are derived from live viewership in Hong Kong, based on Nielsen ratings. Before 2013, audience membership was determined by CSM Media Research.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! Year !! Average !! Peaking !!
