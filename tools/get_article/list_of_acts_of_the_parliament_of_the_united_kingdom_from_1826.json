For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003.  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n7 Geo. 4\nThe seventh session of the 7th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 2 February 1826 until 31 May 1826.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 7 G. 4.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for making Provision for the Salaries of certain Bishops, and other Ecclesiastical Dignitaries and Ministers in the Diocese of Jamaica, and in the Diocese of Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands, and for enabling His Majesty to grant Annuities to such Bishops upon the Resignation of their Offices.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for regulating the Qualification and the Manner of enrolling Jurors in Scotland, and of choosing Jurors in Criminal Trials there, and to unite counties for the purposes of Trial in Cases of High Treason in Scotland, as relates to the Qualification of Special Jurors.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  in the County of Montgomery, belonging to Charles Dallas Esquire, from the Claims of the Crown.}}\n|  for vesting in His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, for ever, Part of the Ground and Buildings now belonging to the Society of King's Inns, Dublin, for erecting thereon a Repository for Public Records in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  for the Establishment of Asylums for the Lunatic Poor in Ireland.}}\n|  for the more easy Recovery of Small Tithes.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  relative to Assault and Battery pendente Lite.|note4= }}\n|  for granting for the Term of Five Years additional Stamp Duties on certain Proceedings in the Courts of Law in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for preventing private Distillation in Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  of the Disembodied Militia in Great Britain and Ireland;
