Filmed in Ukraine and produced in Canada, the film was directed by Olha Byrledianu, produced by Daniel Fine and Tana Axtelle. It features  Krystina Dragomaretska, an architect-turned-volunteer who leads animal rescue missions on the front lines of the Russian invasion.\nWar Tails is available for streaming on Amazon Prime.\nCritical response\n\"The love of animals, especially as in Dan and Krystina’s cases, dogs, transcends boundaries. Heroes like these emerge from their choices, which often involve sacrifice, courage, resilience, and unwavering commitment to doing what is right.\" Nina May, Wunderdog Magazine.\n\"In the movie, Axtelle and Fine — co-founders of the Ukraine War Animals Relief Fund (UWARF) — bring this critical issue to light, demonstrating the power of compassion and the urgent need for action.\" MLT News.\n\"Watching War Tails left me deeply moved. As a military member with a profound love for dogs, I couldn’t help but feel conflicted. It’s impossible to ignore the broader implications of war, not just for humans but for the countless voiceless beings caught in its crossfire.\" Theresa Carpenter.\n“It's not possible to see an abandoned dog in a bombed-out building quivering with fear at the sound of explosions without being moved to tears, nor is it possible to remain dry-eyed by the sight of the same dog coming alive with the care and attention of the vets and volunteers of the Ukraine War Animal Fund. While mostly focused on the rescue of stray animals, it also works as a powerful reminder of just how inhumane and brutal this war perpetrated by Russia has been for the people of Ukraine. The innumerable abandoned animals are shadowed by the untold human tragedies and atrocities that led their owners to flee”.
