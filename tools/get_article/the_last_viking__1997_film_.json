Nielsen. The film stars Holger Thaarup, Kim Bodnia and Per Oscarsson.\nPlot\nA Viking boy, Harald dreams of becoming a warrior like his father Agne. King Grimnir imposes new taxes to collect from the people. However, chieftain Agne refuses to surrender his city's ships to the king and cooperates with the rebels. The king's soldiers soon come to raid the village. The village is set on fire, some of the inhabitants are killed and the rest taken prisoner, and they are ordered to build a new ship for the king's fleet.
