Initially, non-Canadian actresses were simply barred from being nominated in acting categories at all, but beginning with the 7th Genie Awards non-Canadian actresses instead became eligible for the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role and/or the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Film\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 1980  1st Genie Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Trish Van Devere\n| The Changeling\n|-\n| Susan Anspach\n| Running\n|-\n| Samantha Eggar\n| The Brood\n|-\n| Sally Kellerman\n| It Rained All Night the Day I Left\n|-\n| Cloris Leachman\n| Yesterday\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 1981  2nd Genie Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Susan Sarandon\n| Atlantic City, U.S.A.\n|-\n| Ann-Margret\n| Middle Age Crazy\n|-\n| Jamie Lee Curtis\n| Prom Night\n|-\n| Louise Fletcher\n| The Lucky Star\n|-\n| Lee Remick\n| Tribute\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\"| 1982  3rd Genie Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Annie Potts\n| Heartaches\n|-\n| Ellen Burstyn\n| Silence of the North\n|-\n| Meg Foster\n| Ticket to Heaven\n|-\n| Mariette Hartley\n| Improper Channels\n|-\n| Marthe Keller\n| The Amateur\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"| 1983  4th Genie Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| '''Glynnis O'Connor\n| Melanie'\n|-\n| Patty Duke Astin\n| By Design\n|-\n| Lee Grant\n| Visiting Hours\n|-\n| Marie-France Pisier\n| The Hot Touch\n|-\n| Mare Winningham\n| Threshold\n|-\n| Charlayne Woodard\n| Hard Feelings''\n|}\nReferences"
