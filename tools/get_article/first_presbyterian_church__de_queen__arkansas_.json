Fifth Sts., SW corner in De Queen, Arkansas.  It is a single-story wood-frame structure, built in 1898 for a newly established congregation.  The church is the city's finest example of Gothic Revival architecture, with Gothic-arched entrances on the north and east faces of the tower, and a large three-part Gothic window on the eastern gable end, topped with triangular arches.  The main gable ends of the roof are decorated with brackets, as are the ends of a cross gable on the southern elevation.\nThe church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Sevier County, Arkansas\nReferences"
