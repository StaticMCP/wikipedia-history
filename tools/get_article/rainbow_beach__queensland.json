According to the legends of the indigenous  Kabi Kabi people, the dunes were coloured when Yiningie, a spirit represented by a rainbow, plunged into the cliffs after doing battle with an evil tribesman. The sand colours derive from the rich mineral content, including rutile, ilmenite, zircon, and monazite. A black dune of ilmenite sands, overgrown by dune vegetation, can be found north-west of the main town. It is currently being mined for sale to China, with complete removal expected to take two years.\nThe Cooloola Section of the Great Sandy National Park borders the town to the south. A number of walking tracks through the national park depart from the southern outskirts of Rainbow Beach. That includes the northern end-point of the Cooloola Great Walk.\nBy road, Rainbow Beach is  from the Bruce Highway town of Gympie, and  from the Queensland state capital, Brisbane.\nHistory\nThe area's name comes from the vibrant, multi-colored sand dunes, which, according to local Kabi Kabi legend, were coloured by a rainbow spirit.\nOriginally known as Back Beach and Black Rock, it was officially renamed Rainbow Beach in 1969, coinciding with the arrival of the sandmining industry. The town developed to support its industry, but after mining ceased in 1976, it transitioned into a popular tourist destination, as well as the gateway to Fraser Island and an eco-tourism hub.\nThe town's war memorial, commemorating those who died in the World War I and subsequent conflicts, was refurbished in 1993 and is also located in Laurie Hanson Park.\nRainbow Beach State School opened on 28 January 1986.\nThe Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd opened on 15 September 1993. The church and hall were relocated from Yeronga in Brisbane and re-erected in Rainbow Beach after a 15-hour journey.
