Each episode was aired live, and was a two- to three-hour look at the life and times of one particular president of the United States. Episodes were broadcast from locations of importance to the profiled president, featured interviews with historians and other experts, and incorporated calls from viewers. The series served as a commemoration of C-SPAN's 20th anniversary.\nThe first program aired on March 15, 1999, and profiled George Washington. Subsequent programs featured each president in succession, concluding with the then current president Bill Clinton on December 20, 1999. (Despite serving two non-consecutive terms, Grover Cleveland was only profiled on one program.)\nPeabody Award\nAmerican Presidents was awarded a George Foster Peabody Award in 1999. Excerpts of the official rationale for that award appear below:\n...From the sites, noted biographers, presidential scholars, descendants, and other guests presented revealing information and assessments of the life, times and legacies of the presidents. The tone set by chairman and CEO (and reluctant air personality) Brian P. Lamb remains on point: good television often takes time, requires few special effects and demands (and rewards) good listening. While, like Mr. Lamb, they rarely seek the spotlight, especially deserving of mention are executive producer Mark Farkas, producers Maura Pierce, Paul Brown, Peter Slen and the more than 200 other unseen individuals who make the C-SPAN service increasingly indispensable...\n...For creating a series that perfectly embodies the essence of public service in electronic communications, a Peabody Award is presented to C-SPAN for \"American Presidents: Life Portraits.\"\nPresidential portraits\nArtist Chas Fagan was commissioned by C-SPAN to paint portraits of each of the 41 men who had held the office of U.S. president through 1999. He was given a 90-day window from the time he agreed to the assignment until the time that the project needed to be complete. In September 1999, Union Station in Washington, D.C., hosted a display of Fagan's presidential portraits. Since then, Fagan has also painted portraits of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump, and tours with exhibits of those portraits.\nPrograms\nNote: In addition to the interviewees listed, each program featured a variety of other experts, many of whom were employed by or volunteered for the historical sites from which the programs were being broadcast.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!Original air datewith link to video!!President!! width=\"330\"|Location!!Featured interviewees\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?121783-1/life-portrait-george-washington March 15, 1999]||George Washington||Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens,Alexandria, Virginia||Richard Norton Smith\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?121951-1/life-portrait-john-adams March 22, 1999]||John Adams||Adams National Historic Site,Quincy, Massachusetts||David McCullough\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?121787-1/life-portrait-thomas-jefferson April 2, 1999]||Thomas Jefferson||Monticello,Charlottesville, Virginia||Andrew Burstein, Annette Gordon-Reed\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?122316-1/life-portrait-james-madison April 9, 1999]||James Madison||Montpelier,Montpelier Station, Virginia||Jack Rakove, Holly Shulman\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?122387-1/life-portrait-james-monroe April 12, 1999]||James Monroe||James Monroe Museum,Fredericksburg, Virginia||\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?122555-1/life-portrait-john-quincy-adams April 18, 1999]||John Quincy Adams||Massachusetts Historical Society,Boston, Massachusetts||Lynn Hudson Parsons\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?122792-1/life-portrait-andrew-jackson April 26, 1999]||Andrew Jackson||The Hermitage,Hermitage, Tennessee||Robert Remini\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?122988-1/life-portrait-martin-van-buren May 3, 1999]||Martin Van Buren||Martin Van Buren National Historic Site,Kinderhook, New York||\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?123123-1/life-portrait-william-henry-harrison May 10, 1999]||William Henry Harrison||Tippecanoe Battlefield,Battle Ground, Indiana||\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?123380-1/life-portrait-john-tyler May 17, 1999]||John Tyler||Sherwood Forest Plantation,Charles City, Virginia||Edward Crapol, Harrison Ruffin Tyler\n|-\n|[http://www.c-span.org/video/?123943-1/life-portrait-james-k-polk May 28, 1999]||James K.
