Inaugurated on 10 December 2018, it was designed by the landscape architect  and commissioned by the former Brussels Minister of the Environment and Energy, .\nThe monument was created to provide a dedicated space for reflection on human rights, addressing the lack of such a space in Brussels. While human rights texts have been displayed in other public areas, such as Parvis de Saint-Gilles/Sint-Gillisvoorplein premetro station, this monument offers a space for deeper contemplation. The design was inspired by Memorial 22/03, a land-art work by Smets honouring victims of the 2016 Brussels bombings, and it aims to serve as a physical representation of human rights.\nThe  obelisk features thirty coloured stone blocks, each inscribed with an article of the UDHR in French, Dutch, German, and English. The colours range from dark at the bottom to light at the top, symbolising the diversity of human rights and cultures. Surrounded by a circle of Scots pines, the monument invites reflection on the values of equality and dignity. The design was developed through consultations with human rights groups, political parties, and architects, emphasising the importance of collaboration and interdisciplinary dialogue. The monument encourages visitors to engage with the principles of human rights and consider their relevance today.\nFinanced by  with a budget of €140,000, the monument was completed in time for Human Rights Day (HRD) in 2018.\nSee also\n* Sculpture in Brussels\n* Human rights in Belgium\n* Tour & Taxis\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
