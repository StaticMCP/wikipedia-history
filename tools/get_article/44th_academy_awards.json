The ceremonies were presided over by Helen Hayes, Alan King, Sammy Davis Jr., and Jack Lemmon.

She appeared alongside one of her leading men from the 1940s, singer Dick Haymes, to present the musical scoring awards. This was the first time in Awards history that the nominees were shown in superimposed pictures while being announced.
