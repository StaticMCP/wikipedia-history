He was earlier called the King's/Queen's Swanmaster. The office existed to perform Swan-Upping marking and health-checking carried out using Thames skiffs on many of the non-tidal reaches of the River Thames in latter years from Sunbury-on-Thames passing Windsor, Berkshire to Henley on Thames. In 1993 it was replaced by two separate offices: Warden of the Swans and Marker of the Swans.\nHistory\nThe keeper's office dates from the 13th century. He was supported by three swanherdsmen. The principal duties of this official team of four people were to conduct the annual Swan-Upping on much of non-tidal reaches of the River Thames including Windsor.\nIt was abolished in 1993, when it was replaced by two new offices, the Warden of the Swans and the Marker of the Swans.\nList of Keepers of the King's and Queen's Swans\n* Sir William ANDREWS of Lathbury, Bucks, 1620s (d.1625)\n* Thomas Alexander Roberts, 1807–after 1825\n* J.
