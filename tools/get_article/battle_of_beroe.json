The Romans under Trajan Decius were pursuing the Goths, under Cniva, after their victory at the Battle of Nicopolis ad Istrum.  A Goth ambush at Beroe led to heavy Roman losses and forced Decius to retreat across the Balkan Mountains to Moesia.  This allowed Cniva to capture Philippopolis in Thrace.\nReferences"
