It is endemic to the Philippines found on the islands of Luzon, Mindoro, Masbate and the Western Visayas region. Some authorities consider this to be two separate species namely the birds from Western Visayas as the South indigo banded kingfisher and the birds from Luzon, Mindoro and Masbate as the North indigo banded kingfisher. Its habitat are in streams in tropical moist lowland forest. It is declining in population due to habitat loss and degradation.\nDescription and taxonomy\nEbird describes it as \"A dazzling little kingfisher of streams with vegetated banks from the lowlands to low elevations in the mountains. Deep indigo-blue above with a pale turquoise band down the back and speckling on the wing and head. Note pale cheek and throat patches and bright orange chest and belly. Males have a blue band across the upper chest, and some have an incomplete band across the lower chest.\"\nSubspecies\nTwo subspecies are recognized:\n* C. c. cyanopectus —  Known as the Northern Indigo banded Kingfisher; Found  on Luzon, Polillo, Mindoro, Sibuyan, Masbate and Ticao,\n* C. c. nigriostris -—  Known as the Southern Indigo banded Kingfisher; Found on Panay, Negros and Cebu, though possibly extinct on Cebu or was listed as an error.\nSouthern birds have an all-black bill, while northern ones have a red lower bill and more blue on the sides. The Handbook of the Birds of the World considers them as separate species.\nEcology and behaviour\nThe indigo-banded kingfisher feeds on fish and aquatic insects. It perches on rocks and overhanging branches and foliage and dives steeply into the water to catch its prey. Once caught, it returns the prey to the perch where it is beaten and swallowed. Little is known about its breeding behaviour, although it is known to nest in tunnels dug into the banks of streams and rivers.\nHabitat and conservation status\nIts natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forests up to 1,500 meters above sea level but usually much lower. It prefers streams and rivers with densely forested banks. It is somewhat tolerant of secondary forests.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature recognizes the Northern and Southern indigo-banded kingfisher as separate species thus has an assessment for each.\nNorthern indigo-banded kingfisher (C. c. cyanopectus)\nThe global population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as generally rather common. It is classified as a Least-concern species with the population believed to be decreasing.\nSouthern Indigo-banded kingfisher (C. c. nigriostris)\nConsidered uncommon in its range. Negros is one of the most deforested islands in the country with just 4% remaining forest cover in 1988 and is only found in the remnant forests. Range in Panay has not been fully surveyed but they may persist in larger numbers. IUCN estimates the population to be 1,000 - 2,499 mature individuals with the population continuing to decline.\nBoth subspecies are declining due to habitat loss and deforestation.  There are no targeted conservation programs for either sub-species.\nConservation actions proposed is further surveys especially for the more threatened Southern subspecies to be able to better understand its population and biology.\nReferences"
