The currency was issued by the East African Currency Board, a London-based body. In 1966, the Bank of Uganda (BoU), which controlled the issue of currency and managed foreign exchange reserves, became the Central Bank and national banking regulator. The government-owned Uganda Commercial Bank and the Uganda Development Bank were launched in the 1960s.  The Uganda Development Bank is a state-owned development finance institution, which channeled loans from international sources into Ugandan enterprises and administered most of the development loans made to Uganda.\nThe East African Development Bank (EADB), established in 1967, was jointly owned by Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. It was also concerned with development finance. It survived the breakup of the East African Community in 1977 and received a new charter in 1980.\nIn the 1960s, other commercial banks included local operations of the Bank of Baroda, Barclays, the Bank of India, Grindlays Bank, Standard Chartered, and the Uganda Cooperative Bank. The Uganda government took majority shares in all commercial banks in 1969 as part of President Obote's \"Move to the Left\" policy. This was increased to 100 percent control when European and Asian business owners were expelled in 1972-75 under President Idi Amin.\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the number of commercial bank branches and services contracted significantly. Whereas Uganda had 290 commercial bank branches in 1970, by 1987 there were only 84, of which 58 branches were operated by government-owned banks. This number began to increase slowly the following year, and in 1989 the gradual increase in banking activity signaled growing confidence in Uganda's economic recovery.\n1990s–2004\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Ugandan banking industry underwent significant restructuring. Several indigenous commercial banks were declared insolvent, taken over by the central bank, and eventually sold or liquidated. These included the Uganda Cooperative Bank, Greenland Bank, the International Credit Bank, Teefe Bank, and Gold Trust Bank. The Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) was initially privatized through a sale of its majority shares to a purported company from Malaysia. It later became public, however, that the actual buyer was a partnership between Greenland Bank, which was insolvent at the time, and politically connected individuals. A second privatization sale was conducted, with the Standard Bank of South Africa emerging as the winner.\nThe privatized UCB was merged with the former  Grindlays Bank Uganda that the Standard Bank of South Africa already owned and had renamed Stanbic Bank (Uganda). The combined bank is now known as Stanbic Bank Uganda Limited. As of 2008, Stanbic Uganda was the dominant commercial bank in Uganda, with about 27 percent of all bank assets and about 20 percent of all bank branches.\nNile Bank Limited, an indigenous institution, was acquired by the British conglomerate Barclays in January 2007 and merged with its existing Ugandan operations to form the Barclays Bank of Uganda.\nA moratorium on new commercial bank licences was declared in 2004 with the passage of a new banking bill in Parliament, which established new banking institution classification guidelines. There are four classes of lending financial institutions under the new regulations as outlined below.\nRegulatory changes, 2007–2010\nDuring the 18 months following the July 2007 lifting of the new banks moratorium, several commercial banks were newly licensed. These included KCB Bank Uganda Limited, Equity Bank Uganda Limited, GT Bank Uganda, Global Trust Bank, United Bank for Africa, Ecobank, and Housing Finance Bank. Three other banks, ABC Bank (Kenya), Access Bank from Nigeria, and CRDB Bank from Tanzania, publicly declared their intention to start banking operations in Uganda.\nDuring 2008 and 2009, several of the existing banks went on an accelerated branch expansion through mergers and acquisitions or new branch openings. As of December 2009, total commercial bank assets in Uganda were estimated at USh&nbsp;8.73&nbsp;trillion. In April 2009, Bank PHB, Nigeria's fifth largest bank at the time, bought 80 percent ownership of Orient Bank, Uganda's eighth largest commercial bank. This brought the number of Ugandan banks with major investments from Nigeria to three.\nIn October 2010, there were 22 licensed commercial banks in Uganda, with nearly 400 bank branches and almost 600 automated teller machines. At that time, the bank accounts in the country numbered over 5 million. This represented a 16 percent penetration, given Uganda's population of about 32 million at that time.\nIn November 2010, the BoU directed that all commercial banks in Uganda must raise their minimum capital to USh&nbsp;10&nbsp;billion by March 2011 and to USh&nbsp;25&nbsp;billion by March 2013.\nAccording to a study published in 2010, most of the banking activity was concentrated around Kampala, the country's capital, and other large towns, leaving 42 percent of Ugandans dependent on the informal financial sector and another 30 percent totally excluded from the financial services sector.\nAfter 2010\nBy April 2011, the number of commercial banks had increased to 23. The bank branches in the country numbered over 400. The banking sector employed over 8,700 people. Total commercial bank assets in the country were valued at more than USh&nbsp;11&nbsp;trillion.\nDuring 2012, the BoU closed the National Bank of Commerce (Uganda) (NBCU), a small indigenous operation with wealthy investors, some of whom held high-ranking government positions. NBCU's deposits were transferred to Crane Bank. In November 2012, the total number of commercial bank branches in the country reached 500.\nIn June 2012, the BoU estimated the total banking assets in the country at USh&nbsp;14.4&nbsp;trillion. In June 2013, the BoU estimated the total of all commercial bank assets in the country at USh&nbsp;15.7&nbsp;trillion. Those assets had increased to USh&nbsp;18.6&nbsp;trillion by 30 June 2014. As of 31 December 2015, total banking assets in the country were USh&nbsp;21.7&nbsp;trillion.\nThe Bank of Uganda reported total banking assets at USh&nbsp;24.9&nbsp;trillion, as at 30 June 2017, with 7.4 million commercial bank accounts in the country. At that time, there were 546 bank branches and 818 ATMs in Uganda.\nAs of June 2019, according to the Uganda Deposit Protection Fund, total banking assets in the country were USh&nbsp;30.3&nbsp;trillion (US$8.34 billion), with total customer deposits of USh&nbsp;22&nbsp;trillion (US$6.05 billion), held in approximately 14 million deposit accounts. The total banking sector loan portfolio had a 3.48 percent non-performing loan ratio. At that time, the Deposit Protection Fund had assets valued at USh&nbsp;689&nbsp;billion (US$190 million).\nAs of January 2020, according to Uganda Bankers Association, there were 13 million bank accounts in Uganda and 11,000 banking agents countrywide.\nAsset allocation among commercial banks in Uganda\n, total assets in Uganda's banking institutions were valued at USh45.44 trillion (approx. US$12.3 billion). At that time the 10 largest commercial banks accounted for 82.18 percent of total banking assets, while the remaining 15 commercial banks held 17.82 percent. The top five banks held a combined market share of 57.54 percent of total national banking assets. As of December 2023 total bank assets in the country were valued at UGX:45.91 trillion (US$13.9 billion). At that time, the six larges and systemically important commercial banks (Stanbic, Standard Chartered, Centenary, Absa Uganda, Dfcu Bank and Equity Bank Uganda) held a combined market share of 62.15 percent in assets.\nClassification of financial institutions\nTier I financial Institutions\nThis class includes commercial banks that are authorized to hold checking, savings, and time deposit accounts for individuals and institutions in local and international currencies. Commercial banks are also authorized to buy and sell foreign exchange, issue letters of credit, and make loans to depositors and non-depositors.\nTier II financial institutions\nThis class includes credit and finance companies. They are not authorized to establish checking accounts or trade in foreign currency. They are authorized to accept customer deposits and to establish savings accounts. They are also authorized to make  loans backed  with collateral or  without collateral to savings and non-savings customers.\nThe licensed credit institutions as of 12 December 2024 were:\n* BRAC Uganda Bank Limited\n* Yako Bank Uganda Limited\n* Opportunity Bank Uganda Limited\n* Guaranty Trust Bank Uganda\n* ABC Capital Bank Uganda\n* Pride Bank Limited\nTier III financial institutions\nThis class includes microfinance institutions that are allowed to accept deposits from customers but only in the form of savings accounts. Members of this class of institutions are known as Microfinance Deposit-taking Institutions or MDIs. MDIs are not authorized to offer checking accounts or to trade in foreign currency.\nThe MDIs in the country as of 14 December 2024 were:\n* FINCA Uganda Limited\n* UGAFODE Microfinance Limited\nTier IV institutions\nThese institutions are regulated by the Uganda Microfinance Regulatory Authority (UMRA). They are not authorized to accept deposits from the public. They may, however, offer loans backed  with collateral or  without collateral to the public. In 2008, it was estimated that there were over 1,000 such institutions in the country.\n* Letshego Microfinance Uganda\n* Asaak Financial Services Limited\n* Hofokam Limited\n* VisionFund Uganda Limited\nDevelopment banks\n*East African Development Bank\n*Uganda Development Bank\nInvestment banks and stock brokerage firms\nInvestment banks and stock brokerage firms in Uganda are regulated by the Capital Markets Authority and the various stock exchanges in the country.\nInsurance companies\nThere were 18 insurance companies in Uganda in January 2015.\nForeign exchange bureaus\nAs of March 2016, there were 246 licensed foreign exchange bureaus in the country.\nDeposit insurance\nThe Uganda Deposit Protection Fund became operational in 1997. It is funded by premiums charged to every licensed deposit-taking financial institution in the country. Each account is protected up to USh&nbsp;10&nbsp;million. The Depositor Insurance Law was enacted by Parliament and states that all depositors must be paid within 90 days of a bank failure and that the failing institution must be sold by the auctioning of its assets within six months of its seizure by the central bank. If the central bank determines that the failed institution will fetch a better economic return, if sold as a whole, then it will re-open under new ownership and management, provided the new owners and managers meet the approval of the BoU.\nCredit bureaux\nIn 2008, the Bank of Uganda registered Compuscan CRB Ltd, a subsidiary of Compuscan, as the first credit reference bureau in the county. In addition to its traditional credit bureau services, Compuscan CRB introduced and maintained the biometric identity smart card system used in the Ugandan financial industry.\nWith improved credit risk assessment afforded by the credit bureau, new products, including medium and long-term financing like car loans and mortgages, have been introduced by most Ugandan commercial banks. As of April 2014, interest rates that were formerly in the 20 to 30 percent range had dropped to as low as 10 percent for the best customers at some banks.\nIn 2015, Ugandan regulators licensed an additional credit bureau, Metropol Credit Reference Bureau Limited. Based out of Nairobi, Kenya, Metropol has operations in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.\nSee also\n*Asset allocation among commercial banks in Uganda\n*List of banks in Africa (Uganda)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Insight/The-first-bank-in-Uganda/-/688338/2638762/-/allt9fz/-/index.html The First Bank In Uganda]\n*[http://allafrica.com/stories/201405051901.html?viewall=1 Uganda: Commercial Banks Reeling]\n*\n*[http://allafrica.com/stories/201309301326.html?viewall=1  Overview of Uganda's Banking Sector In September 2013]\n*[http://allafrica.com/stories/201205040037.html Ugandan Banks Swimming In Profits In 2011]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120406072119/http://redpepper.co.ug/welcome/?p=6280 Most Ugandan Banks Had A Profitable 2010]\n*[http://www.monitor.co.ug/Business/Business%20Power/-/688616/897912/-/l588sh/-/index.html Overview of Uganda Banking Sector April 2010]\n*[http://www.thebanker.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/5976/Big_names_reeled_in_by_Ugandan_rebirth.html Resurgence of Uganda's Banking Sector]\n*[http://allafrica.com/stories/201012141126.html Bank of Uganda Raises Minimum Capital For Commercial Banks From US$2 Million To US$12.5 Million (USh&nbsp;4&nbsp;Billion To USh&nbsp;25&nbsp;Billion)]\n*[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20110410075830/New_National_Islamic_Bank_in_the_pipeline Bank of Uganda Working To Establish Islamic Banking In 2012]\n*[https://ugandahighcommissiondaressalaam.com/banks-in-uganda/ List of commercial banks in Uganda]"
