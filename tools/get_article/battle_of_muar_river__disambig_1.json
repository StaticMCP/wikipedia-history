The battle ended in favor of the Malayans, as they defeated the Portuguese in the Muar River.\nBattle\nIn 1521, having defeated a Portuguese attempt to capture and destroy the Sultan of Malacca Mahmud Shah's base, attacks on Portuguese shipping increased from that time onwards, which laid a heavy burden on Portuguese operations. In April 1523, the Malaccans, allied with the Pahang Sultanate launched a raid against the Portuguese and occupied Malacca with a large navy of 80 vessels led by the Laksamana.\nOnce the Malayans established themselves in the Muar River, a lone Portuguese vessel sailing from Malacca spotted the large Malayan navy about 10 leagues away and quickly returned to Malacca to inform its captain Jorge de Albuquerque; who decided to face them in the sea and send ships there, however, the Portuguese encountered a heavy storm which forced them head to the Muar River.\nThe storm was powerful enough that it forced three Portuguese ships – separated from the rest – to go far into the river where they met the Malayan camp, where they were surrounded and attacked with all 65 Portuguese on board being killed. The rest of the Portuguese navy withdrew to Malacca, and the Malayans, satisfied with their victory returned to Bintan.\nSee also\n* Attack on Bintan (1521)\n* Battle of Pago\n* Siege of Bintan\nReferences"
