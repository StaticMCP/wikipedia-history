Services are assessed as 'Outstanding', 'Good', 'Adequate', 'Requires Improvement' or 'Inadequate' in 11 areas.\nIn the inspection for 2023-2025 one category (Responding to major incidents) was found to be 'Adequate', one category (Public safety through fire regulation) was found to be 'Inadequate' and the remaining 9 categories were found to be 'Requires improvement'.\nFire stations and appliances\nBuckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service operates 19 fire stations,\nof which two are crewed day and night by wholetime firefighters, ten are crewed by on-call firefighters who live near to their fire station and can arrive there within ten minutes of a call being received, and seven are crewed by a combination of wholetime and on-call firefighters.\nBuckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service also operate a pool of \"flexi-firefighters\" who fill in gaps in wholetime crewing.\nBlue Light Hub\nOn 10 February 2016, Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes Fire Authority (BMKFA) approved plans for a new combined station to be used alongside Thames Valley Police, South Central Ambulance Service, and NHS Blood and Transplant, named the \"Blue Light Hub\" to be built. The new station is intended to house over 200 fire, police, and ambulance staff who will be relocating from various locations across Milton Keynes to work together in one central location.\nOn 30 June 2020, fire crews from Great Holm and Bletchley fire stations moved into the new West Ashland fire station, inside the Blue Light Hub.\nSee also\n*List of British firefighters killed in the line of duty\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmicfrs/fire-and-rescue-services/buckinghamshire/ Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service] at HMICFRS"
