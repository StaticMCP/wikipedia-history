A.D. 500, like the HTV production Arthur of the Britons (1972–3). However, the tragic storyline of this BBC version kept closer faith with the chivalric romance of ''Le Morte d'Arthur.\nReception\nThe Arthurian scholar Norris J. Lacy opines: \"The Legend of King Arthur  has the leisure to depict the legend in detail, but the resulting periodic presentation, if not the medium itself, dilutes the force and drama of the Arthurian story in a way that rarely happens in literature, and certainly not either in the French Vulgate or in Malory.\"\nNovelisation\nA tie-in novel, The Legend of King Arthur'', authored by the screenwriter Andrew Davies, was published in London by Fontana/Armada in 1979.\nHome video and DVD releases\nThe serial was released on VHS by BBC Video in 1985, and on DVD by Simply Media in 2016.\nSee also\n*List of films based on Arthurian legend\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
