The Army Nursing Service, which had been established in 1881, and which from 1889 provided Sisters for all Army hospitals with at least 100 beds, had only a small number of nurses in its employ. In 1897, in an effort to have nurses available if needed for war, the service was supplemented by 'Princess Christian's Army Nursing Service Reserve''' (PCANSR). Nurses registered for the service and by the beginning of the First Boer War the reserve had around 100 members, but swelled its membership to over 1400 during the conflict. PCANSR eventually became the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service. On 27 March 1902, 'Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS) was established by Royal Warrant, and was named after Queen Alexandra, who became its president.  In 1949, the QAIMNS became a corps in the British Army and was renamed as the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps'''. Since 1950 the organisation has trained nurses, and in 1992 men were allowed to join.\nThe associated Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps Association is a registered charity. Queen Alexandra was president from 1902 until her death in 1925. The following year she was succeeded by Queen Mary.\nAmalgamation\nThe Secretary of State for Defence announced on 15 October 2024, that it will amalgamate with the Royal Army Dental Corps and Royal Army Medical Corps to form one unified corps, the Royal Army Medical Service.\nThe Army Nursing Service\nFive early members of the Army Nursing Service trained at The London Hospital under Eva Luckes, and went onto become Superintendents. They also later served in the QAIMNS.\n* May Russell, joined in 1885, promoted in 1893.\n* Ann Garriock, joined in 1886, promoted in 1899.The War Office records for Ann Garriock do not appear to have survived. Ann Garriock,  see: Boer War Nurses Database [Available at: , accessed on 14  October 2024].\n* Sarah Elizabeth Oram, joined in 1886, promoted in 1899.\n* Caroline Hutton Potts, joined in 1887, promoted to Acting Superintendent in 1899.\n* Sarah Lucy Wilshaw, joined in 1887, promoted to Acting Superintendent in 1900.\n* Caroline Hodgson, Matron 1893-1904.\nQueen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS)\nWhen Queen Alexandra's Imperial Nursing Service was formed King Edward VII asked Sir Frederick Treves and Sydney Holland, Chairman of the London Hospital for advice. Holland asked Eva Luckes, Matron of The London Hospital for advice. Several London Hospital supporters were members of the first Army Nursing Board including Sir Frederick Treves; Norah, Lady Roberts; Queen Alexandra – who was a keen supporter and President of The London Hospital from 1904; and London Hospital trained civilian matron of the Westminster Hospital, Mabel Cave. Six of the first 27 matrons  and principal matrons had all trained at The London under Eva Luckes.\n* Ethel Hope Becher, GBE, RRC and Bar, Principal Matron, 1903, Matron in Chief, War Office, 1910-1919.\n* Ann Garriock, RRC, Matron, 1903, Principal Matron - South Africa, 1907-1910.\n* Emma Maud McCarthy, GBE, RRC & Bar, DStJ, Matron, 1903, Principal Matron War Office, 1910-1914, Matron in Chief, British Expeditionary Force (BEF), 1914-1919.\n* Sarah Elizabeth Oram, DBE, RRC, Matron 1903, Principal Matron -South Africa, 1911-1914, Nursing Inspector and attached to BEF 1914-1915, and Matron in Chief (Acting ) Eastern Mediterranean Force 1915-1919.\n* May Russell, RRC, Matron, 1903-1911.\n* Caroline Hutton Potts, Matron,1904-1911.\n* Gertrude Richards, CBE, RRC, Matron,1904-1919.\nTerritorial Force Nursing Service\nThe Territorial Force Nursing Service (TFNS) was originally formed to staff the territorial force hospitals at home, and the majority of its members spent their service during World War I in the United Kingdom, not only in the 25 territorial hospitals, but also in hundreds of auxiliary units throughout the British Isles. Within a short time they were also employed in the eighteen territorial hospitals abroad, and alongside their QAIMNS colleagues in military hospitals, casualty clearing stations and on hospital ships in France and Belgium, Malta, Salonica, Gibraltar, Egypt, Mesopotamia and East Africa.\nTerritorial Army Nursing Service\nThe Territorial Army Nursing Service (TANS) was formed in 1920, when the Territorial Force was renamed the Territorial Army. It existed until 1949, when both regular and reserve nurses joined the QARANC. Territorial Army nurses served alongside QAIMNS nurses all over the world, and in all campaigns during World War II.\nRanks\nThe initial ranking system used by the QAIMNS was as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!QAIMNS rank\n!Equivalent Army rank (from 1941)\n|-----\n| Staff Nurse ||\n|-----\n| Sister || Lieutenant\n|-----\n| Senior Sister || Captain\n|-----\n| Matron || Major\n|-----\n| Principal Matron || Lieutenant-Colonel\n|-----\n| Chief Principal Matron || Colonel\n|-----\n| Matron-in-Chief || Brigadier\n|}\nSenior appointments\nThe Colonel in Chief was The Duchess of Edinburgh GCVO GCStJ CD.
