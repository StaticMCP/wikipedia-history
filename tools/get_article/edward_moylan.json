Moylan was a member of the U.S. Davis Cup Team, Davis Cup Coach and a gold medal winner at the 1955 Pan American Games with Art Larsen.\nCareer\nMoylan won the 1956 Cincinnati Open on clay, defeating Alex Olmedo in the quarterfinal, Grant Golden in the semifinal in five sets, and Bernard Bartzen, considered the finest clay court player at the time, in the final in three straight sets. He also won the Eastern Clay Court Championships three times in succession from 1954 to 1956.\nMoylan's finest hour was perhaps the 1947 Spring Lake Bathing and Tennis Club singles when he brought to an end the 9-year tenure of Frankie Parker at Spring Lake.  After his victory against Parker, Moylan went on to defeat Gardnar Mulloy in the final round of the tournament to win the men's singles.\nAfter his playing career, Moylan taught tennis and was the head tennis and squash coach at Cornell University from 1962 to 1972. He died on May 26, 2015, in Ithaca, New York.\nReferences\n*From Club Court to Center Court, The Evolution of Professional Tennis in Cincinnati by Phillip S.
