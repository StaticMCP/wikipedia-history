Named after the Cumbria town of Workington, the term was first used ahead of the 2019 general election. Workington man describes the stereotypical swing voter who it was believed would determine the election result. Their support of the Conservatives in the 2019 election helped the party break the Labour Party's Red Wall of safe seats.\nThe term was invented by Onward, a centre-right think tank, with a Guardian article describing the characteristics of Workington man as a northern male over the age of 45 without a university degree, who enjoys rugby league, and who had previously supported Labour but voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum. The Financial Times described the term as \"just the latest depressing political caricature\". The term is similar to political stereotypes used at previous elections, such as Worcester woman, who were thought to define the characteristics of a key target voter.\nLabour had held the Workington constituency for most of its 100-year history, with the exception being the period following the 1976 by-election, which saw a Conservative candidate elected against a backdrop of Labour in government at national level. Less than three years after this by-election victory, the seat returned to Labour at the 1979 general election. Going into the 2019 general election, it was seen as a key marginal seat for the Conservatives to win from Labour. On a 9.7% swing, it fell to the Conservatives on election night, marking the first time the seat had elected a Conservative at a general election.\nAbolition of constituency\nFurther to the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished. The town of Workington itself was combined with the majority of the also-abolished constituency of Copeland to form Whitehaven and Workington. The remainder, comprising the majority of the electorate, was reformed as the new seat of Penrith and Solway.\nIn February 2023, Workington's MP Mark Jenkinson announced that he had been selected by Conservative Party members for Penrith and Solway, which was considered to be the safer seat.\nRebuilding of the Red Wall\nIn April 2023, a Labour Together report suggested the Conservatives' vote share among 'Workington man' voters had dropped, from 49% at the 2019 general election to 15%, with Labour's vote share among the group increasing in turn to 56%, a lead of 41 points. Analysis by The Guardian said that should the level of support that Labour \"currently receives from this group [be] mirrored on election day, Labour would win back every one of its 30 lost red wall seats\".\nSee also\n*Essex man\n*Worcester woman\n*Holby City woman\n*Soccer mom\n*Reagan Democrat\n*Squeezed middle\n*Stevenage woman\n*Yuppie\n*Motorway man\nReferences"
