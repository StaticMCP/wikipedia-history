It is an adaption of a 1933 Kenyon Nicholson and Charles Robinson play of the same name. It was released on February 9, 1952, by Paramount Pictures. The working title was At Sea with the Navy.\nIt was the fifth film collaboration of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, who would make 16 movies together before their partnership's end.\nPlot\nAfter meeting in the Navy recruiting line, Al Crowthers and Melvin Jones become friends. Al has tried to enlist before, 11 times, but was always rejected because of a bad knee. However, he keeps trying so that he can impress women. Melvin, meanwhile, is allergic to women's cosmetics and his doctor prescribed ocean travel, so he decided to join the Navy as this was the only way he could afford to follow doctor's orders.\nUnbeknownst to Al, the naval requirements have been lowered and this time he has been accepted, as has Melvin. They are assigned to Lardoski, a bully they met in line and referred to as \"fathead.\"\nWhile based in San Diego, Melvin falls in love with Hilda Jones, a woman who does not wear makeup. Melvin seems to attract many women, so Lardoski wagers with Al, betting that Melvin must get a kiss from any girl Lardoski names. Al agrees and Lardoski picks Corinne Calvet, who is performing at a nightclub in Honolulu. The crew then get sent out on the next submarine to Hawaii, with Melvin caught on deck when the ship is submerging. Upon his rescue he is tied to a torpedo for the rest of the voyage to avoid any more incidents.\nOnce in Hawaii, Al romances Corinne at the same time Melvin vies for her affection in order to gain a kiss to win the bet, which his shipmates have informed him about. Melvin is unsuccessful in comforting Hilda, who becomes jealous. Lardoski tries to prevent the kiss by getting the shore patrol to arrest Melvin, but after disguising himself as a hula dancer, Melvin gains the kiss. Al wins the bet (and Corinne), and Melvin works things out with Hilda.\nCast\n* Jerry Lewis as Melvin Jones\n* Dean Martin as Al Crowthers\n* Corinne Calvet as Corinne Calvet, herself\n* Marion Marshall as Hilda Jones\n* Robert Strauss as CPO Lardoski\n* Leif Erickson as Cmdr.
