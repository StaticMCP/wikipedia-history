He was the eldest son of the Wanli Emperor and succeeded his father as emperor in 1620. His reign came to an abrupt end less than one month after his enthronement when he was found dead one morning in the palace following a bout of diarrhea. His reign was the shortest in Ming history.\nZhu Changluo was born in 1582. His mother, Lady Wang, was a servant of the Wanli Emperor's mother, Empress Dowager Li. Lady Wang was promoted, but did not gain the favor of the Wanli Emperor, and the Emperor ignored their son. Instead, the Wanli Emperor favored another concubine, Lady Zheng, and her son, Zhu Changxun. The Emperor intended to appoint Zhu Changxun as heir to the throne, but this choice faced strong opposition from the ministers. As a result, the matter remained at a standstill for many years due to the stubbornness of both sides.\nIn 1601, the Wanli Emperor finally succumbed to the pressure of his ministers, his officials, and the Empress Dowager, and officially appointed nineteen-year-old Zhu Changluo as heir. However, even with this formal recognition, intrigue and the Emperor's dissatisfaction with the succession persisted. In 1615, the court was rocked by scandal when a man named Zhang Chai armed himself with a wooden staff and broke into the Forbidden City, specifically targeting Zhu Changluo's palace. While the initial investigation deemed him insane, another investigator suggested the involvement of two eunuchs close to Lady Zheng. Both eunuchs were swiftly executed, but speculation about the true perpetrators of the plot continued to circulate.\nThe Wanli Emperor died on 18 August 1620, and Zhu Changluo officially ascended the throne as the Taichang Emperor on 28 August. However, just a few days after his coronation, he fell ill and died on 26 September, despite attempts at treatment. The Taichang Emperor's eldest son, Zhu Youjiao, was then enthroned as the Tianqi Emperor. The death of the relatively young emperor sparked suspicion, speculation, and recrimination among different court factions.\nEarly life\nZhu Changluo, the future Taichang Emperor, was born in 1582 during the tenth year of the Wanli Emperor's reign as the Emperor's first son. His mother, Lady Wang, was a servant of Empress Dowager Li, the Emperor's mother. Although the Wanli Emperor initially wanted nothing to do with the child, the Empress Dowager convinced him to acknowledge paternity by presenting records of his visits. She also pushed for Lady Wang's promotion to imperial concubine with the title \"Consort Gong\" (). The Emperor's interest in Lady Wang quickly faded as he became infatuated with another concubine, Lady Zheng, who bore him another son, Zhu Changxun (1586–1641).\nIn 1586, the question of succession arose when the Emperor promoted Lady Zheng to the rank of \"Imperial Noble Consort\" (Huang Guifei), placing her just below the Empress and above his other concubines, including Lady Wang. It was evident to those around him that he preferred Lady Zheng's son Zhu Changxun—his third son (the second had died in infancy)—to succeed him rather than Zhu Changluo. This caused a division among officials, with some advocating for the rights of the first son based on legal primogeniture, while others supported Lady Zheng. In response to the widespread support for the eldest son, the Emperor delayed making a decision. He justified the delay by stating that he was waiting for a son from the Empress. When the request was made to appoint Zhu Changluo as heir to the throne at the age of eight so that his education could officially begin, the Emperor defended himself by saying that princes were traditionally taught by eunuchs.\nIn 1589, the Emperor agreed to appoint Zhu Changluo as his successor. This decision was met with opposition from Lady Zheng, causing controversy and, two years later, even arrests when a pamphlet was circulated in Beijing accusing her of conspiring against the Emperor's eldest son with some high officials. Despite this, the Emperor tried to portray Lady Zheng in a positive light to the public.\nThe failure to name a successor sparked protests from not only opposition-minded officials, but also high dignitaries such as grand secretaries Shen Shixing (in office 1578–91) and Wang Xijue (in office 1584–91 and 1593–94). The Empress and Empress Dowager Li also supported the rights of Zhu Changluo, but the Wanli Emperor did not appoint him heir to the throne until 1601, after further protests and requests. At the same time, Zhu Changxun was given the title of Prince of Fu, but he was kept in Beijing instead of being sent to the province as originally planned when he turned eighteen in 1604. This fueled rumors that the question of succession was still open. It was not until 1614, after a long series of appeals and protests, that Empress Dowager Li intervened and insisted on sending Zhu Changxun to the provincial seat.\nCase of the attack with the stick\nRelated to the succession debates was the \"case of the attack with the stick\". In late May 1615, a man named Zhang Chai was arrested near the palace of Zhu Changluo for carrying a stick. It was later discovered that Zhang was mentally unstable and had intended to use the stick to resolve a conflict with two eunuchs he did not get along with. Initially, the case was closed and Zhang was executed, but prison official Wang Zhicai intervened and pushed for a public investigation involving representatives from the Ministry of Justice. This new version of the case suggested that Zhang Chai was mentally sound and had been manipulated by two eunuchs close to Lady Zheng and her brother. This raised suspicions that their goal was to kill the heir and install Lady Zheng's son in his place. The case caused a stir at court and the Wanli Emperor took the unprecedented step of summoning civil and military officials from the Beijing authorities for a meeting. This was the first time the Emperor had met with officials from the \"outer court\" since 1602. He appeared before them with his family, including Zhu Changluo and his sons and daughter, and expressed his disappointment and disbelief that they would doubt his relationship with the heir in whom he trusted and relied upon. Zhu Changluo also confirmed his close relationship with his father and asked for an end to the affair. Despite this, the Emperor ordered the execution of Zhang Chai and the two eunuchs involved in the case, but representatives from the Ministry of Justice demanded further investigation and the grand secretaries brokered a compromise. Zhang Chai was executed the next day, but the suspected eunuchs were to be interrogated. The interrogation did take place, but both eunuchs remained under the supervision of the Emperor's eunuchs. On the fifth day after the Emperor's speech, the officials were informed that the two eunuchs had died under palace confinement.\nEmperor\n, Taipei]]\nOn 18 August 1620, the Wanli Emperor died. Zhu Changluo officially took the throne on 28 August 1620 (the first day of the 8th month of the Chinese calendar). He chose the name Taichang for his era, symbolizing peace and prosperity in contrast to the turmoil of the previous reign. Many people in Beijing saw the new monarch as a chance for a fresh start. Since he had not been his father's first choice and the two had never been close, there was hope that he would abandon the Wanli Emperor's policies and implement necessary reforms. On 19 August 1 million liang (37.3 tons) of silver from the palace treasury was sent to defend the northeastern borders, due to the critical situation in Liaodong, where Nurhaci's Jurchens were attacking. Additionally, the mining and commercial taxes that had been introduced in the 1590s were abolished, and the eunuch tax commissioners, who were responsible for collecting these taxes, were recalled from the provinces. All of these actions were carried out in accordance with the last wishes of the deceased emperor. On 21 August, the Taichang Emperor sent another million liang of silver to Liaodong.\nTo address the long-standing issue of vacant positions in the administration, the Taichang Emperor appointed many critics of the previous government who had been removed from their positions for opposing the Wanli Emperor. Among the first to be summoned were Zuo Yuanbiao (; 1551–1624) and Feng Congwu (; 1556–1627), both associated with the Donglin movement.}} Many officials who later became key Donglin figures had supported Zhu Changluo during the dispute over the succession in the 1580s and 1590s.\nIllness and death, the Red Pill Case\nThree days after his enthronement, the Taichang Emperor fell ill. On 5 September, his condition worsened, and he called for a physician. During audiences on 8 and 9 September, he appeared unwell and soon took to his bed. On 13 September, he was visited again by the physician and a group of officials. The Emperor complained of insomnia and loss of appetite. The officials were concerned and when they heard that Cui Wensheng (), the eunuch in charge of the imperial clinic, had given the Emperor a laxative, they accused him of incompetence. The officials believed that the Emperor needed strengthening medicine instead. The Emperor refused to accept the accusation, but also stopped taking the mentioned medicine.\nSeveral days passed with the Emperor officiating from his bed, but on 17 September, he became overwhelmed and began to speak of his impending death. During a visit from concerned officials, led by Grand Secretary Fang Congzhe, on 25 September, the Emperor requested red pills, which he had heard were being produced by Li Keshao, an assistant director in the Court of State Ceremonial. Li later testified that he believed his pills helped strengthen the Emperor's diseased body. That same day, the imperial guards and eunuchs brought Li to the Emperor, who ordered him to make the pills. In the presence of the aforementioned (thirteen) officials, Li made the pills using lead, autumn mineral, human milk and cinnabar—all tonic drugs in traditional Chinese medicine—which were provided to him by the Emperor's eunuchs. He then gave one pill to the Emperor, who felt relieved and grew hungry, requesting a second. Li, however, refused, saying that one was sufficient and two would be excessive. The Emperor then sent Li and the officials home after midnight. The following morning at dawn, the eunuchs announced that the Emperor had died. Some members of the Donglin movement accused Li Keshao and Fang Congzhe of poisoning the Emperor, while others among the thirteen officials present took a more cautious approach, attempting to absolve themselves of any negligence. The controversy surrounding the red pills—whether they caused the Emperor's death intentionally or unintentionally—sparked heated debates and accusations over the next few years.\nAfter the Taichang Emperor's death, a power struggle emerged over the succession of his fourteen-year-old son, Zhu Youjiao. Lady Li, the Taichang Emperor's favored concubine, clashed with the ministers and grand secretaries for control. Despite Lady Li's resistance and that of her eunuchs, the eunuchs loyal to the officials ultimately handed the boy over to them and banished Lady Li to another palace. Zhu Youjiao officially ascended to the throne on 1 October 1620.\nConsorts and issue\n* Empress Xiaoyuanzhen () of the Guo clan (; d. 1613)\n** Princess Huaishu (), personal name Huijian (), second daughter\n* Empress Dowager Xiaohe () of the Wang clan (; 1582–1619)\n** Zhu Youjiao (), the Tianqi Emperor (; 1605–1627), first son\n** Zhu Youxue (), Prince Huai of Jian (), second son\n* Empress Dowager Xiaochun () of the Liu clan (; 1592–1614)\n** Zhu Youjian (), the Chongzhen Emperor (; 1611–1644), fifth son\n* Consort Gongyihuishunzhuang () of the Li clan (; 1588–1624)\n* Consort Yi () of the Fu clan ()\n** Princess Ningde (), personal name Huiyan (), sixth daughter\n*** Married Liu Youfu ()\n** Princess Suiping (), personal name Huijing (), seventh daughter\n*** Married Qi Zanyuan () in 1627, and had issue (four daughters)\n** Zhu Youxu (), Prince Huai of Xiang (), sixth son\n* Consort Kang () of the Li clan ()\n** Zhu Youmo (), Prince Hui of Huai (), fourth son\n** Princess Le'an (; d. 1643), personal name Huiti (), ninth daughter\n*** Married Gong Yonggu (; d. 1644), and had issue (three sons, two daughters)\n* Consort Jing () of the Feng clan ()\n** Zhu Youshan (), Prince Zhao of Hui (), seventh son\n* Concubine Shen () of the Shao clan ()\n** Princess Daowen (), personal name Huizheng (), 11th daughter\n* Concubine Xiang () of the Zhang clan ()\n* Concubine Ke () of the Li clan ()\n* Concubine Ding () of the Guo clan (; b. 1591)\n* Lady of Selected Service () of the Wang clan ()\n** Zhu Youji (), Prince Si of Qi (), third son\n* Lady of Selected Service () of the Zhao clan (; d. 1620)\n* Unknown\n** Princess Daoyi (), first daughter\n** Zhu Huiheng (), third daughter\n** Princess Daoshun (), personal name Huixian (), fourth daughter\n** Zhu Huiweng, (), fifth daughter\n** Zhu Huiwan (), eighth daughter\n** Zhu Huizhao (), tenth daughter\nSee also\n* Chinese emperors family tree (late)\n*List of emperors of the Ming dynasty\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n*  |orig-year=1647 |location=Beijing}}\n*\n*  |orig-year=1739}}\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
