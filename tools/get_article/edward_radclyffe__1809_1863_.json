He was largely employed in engraving for the ‘annuals,’ then so popular, and for The Art Journal and other works. He also was employed for many years by the admiralty in engraving charts.\nLike his father, Radclyffe was a close friend of David Cox, and published several etchings and engravings from his works. He planned a \"liber studiorum\" in imitation of J. M. W. Turner's ‘Liber Studiorum’ , but had executed only three etchings for this at the time of his death in November 1863. At the end of his life he was living in Clifton Villas, Camden, London (now Cliff Villas) and was a close neighbour of Orlando Jewitt.\nHe was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery, and his wife, son, daughter and daughter-in-law were later buried with him. He had married, in 1838, Maria, daughter of Major Henry Revell of Round Oak, Englefield Green, Surrey.\nGallery\nEdward Radclyffe - Stag at the Edge of a Pond - B1998.14.281 - Yale Center for British Art.jpg|Edward Radclyffe, Stag at the Edge of a Pond, Yale Center for British Art\nEdward Radclyffe - St Michael's Church, Stockwell - B1977.14.15758 - Yale Center for British Art.jpg|Edward Radclyffe, ''St Michael's Church, Stockwell, Yale Center for British Art\nEdward Radclyffe - British Museum, Elgin Room - B1998.14.235 - Yale Center for British Art.jpg|Edward Radclyffe, British Museum, Elgin Room, Yale Center for British Art\nEdward Radclyffe - Fall of Foyers, Invernesshire - B1998.14.754 - Yale Center for British Art.jpg|Edward Radclyffe, Fall of Foyers, Invernesshire, Yale Center for British Art\nView from Coopers Hill, with Runnemede and Windsor Castle engraved by E.Radclyffe after a picture by Thomas Allom publ 1842 edited.jpg|View from Coopers Hill, with Runnemede and Windsor Castle engraved by E.Radclyffe after a picture by Thomas Allom published in 1842\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe.
