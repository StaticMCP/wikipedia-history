AQAP captured much of Hadhramaut including its capital of Mukalla in 2015 amid the breakout of the Yemeni civil war. Mukalla, along with most of Hadhramaut was recaptured by the Yemeni army along with coalition forces in 2016. After being ousted from power, AQAP continued maintaining a presence in the governorate, waging an insurgency against the government and the coalition.\nAl-Manisi Valley was an AQAP stronghold in central Hadhramaut used as an operation room for its activities in the region.\nBattle\nOn 16 February 2018, the Hadrami Elite Force surrounded Al-Manisi Valley. The next day, the Hadrami Elite, backed by coalition aircraft and UAE ground support, launched a preemptive attack from three axles that laid siege to Al-Manisi. By 18 February, Hadrami Forces had entered the valley and began to slowly retake all areas in and around it. On 18 February, Hadhrami Elite Forces were pushing into the valley from the lower and western entrance. Following fierce fighting over the day, AQAP forces retreated as Hadrami forces gained full control of the valley and began pursuing them. After AQAP had completely fled, Yemeni security forces established military posts and patrols around the area.\nAftermath\nAfter capturing the valley, security forces confiscated equipment and ammunition used by AQAP. This included large caches of ammunition, mortar guns and missiles.\nThe governor of Hadhramaut, Major General Faraj Al-Bahsani, declared that the operation was a success and that others like it will follow until the region was fully rid of AQAP.\nReferences"
