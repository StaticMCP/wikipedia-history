This species is endemic to Saint Lucia. It was formerly considered a subspecies of the Adelaide's warbler.\nTaxonomy\nThe St Lucia warbler was first formally described as Dendroeca adelaidae delicata in 1883 by the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway with its type locality given as St Lucia. This species is now classified within the genus Setophaga which belongs to the family Parulidae, the wood warblers or New World warblers. The Saint Lucia warbler was considered to be a subspecies of Adelaide's warbler(S. adelaidae) of Puerto Rico, along with the Barbuda warbler (S. subita) but these are now regarded as separate species. The three species formerly known as Adelaide's warbler are classified in the \"yellow-throated\" species group, S. dominica, within Setophaga.\nEtymology\nThe Saint Lucia warbler is classified in the genus Setophaga; this name means \"moth eater\" in Greek. The specific name, delicata, is Latin and means \"dainty\", \"nice\" or \"delicate\".\nDescription\nThe Saint Lucia warbler is a small bird with a length of .

The females are similar to the males but the black margin of the crown stripe is less obvious and there is less white in the tail. The song is variable, but always includes a series of fluty notes and frequently ends with two notes which are written as \"which you\". The call is a single loud chip note.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe Saint Lucia warbler is endemic to St Lucia in the Lesser Antilles where it is found in forests and in well wooded gardens.\nReferences"
