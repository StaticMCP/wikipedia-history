It formed part of the Area Force Units as well as the Territorial Reserve.\nHistory\nOrigin\nOtjiwarongo Commando was one of 26 Area Force Units, similar to the localised territorial force concept of area bound commandos in South Africa. These units were set in particular sectors of South West Africa mainly from the farming community.\nOperations\nDisbandment\nThis unit, along with all other South West Africa Territorial Force units was disbanded with the independence of Namibia from South Africa and was announced around December 1988.\nUnit Insignia\nLeadership\nReferences\nSee also\n* South African Commando System"
