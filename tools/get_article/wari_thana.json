Located in the Old Dhaka quarter, it is the first planned neighbourhood in Dhaka city, established in the late 19th century. The area is home to the Baldha Garden, one of the oldest botanical gardens established in this part of Bengal.\nFormed in 2012, Wari Thana falls under the administrative area of the Dhaka South City Corporation and had a population of about 1.25 lakh at the 2022 Bangladeshi census.\nHistory\nThe origin of the name \"Wari\" has been subject to debate. While many attribute it to Dhaka's magistrate in 1884 Frederick Wyer, historian Hashem Sufi suggests that it dates back to the Mughal period when troops garrisoned here in large tents, called  in Persian.\nBefore the British government gained control of the area in the 19th century, Muslin artisans, known for repairing clothing, inhabited the area. Spanning 700 acres, the whole area was rented as an agricultural settlement in 1839, primarily comprising orchards. Despite rent adjustments, by 1876, a significant portion of Wari had become abandoned and overgrown with jungles.\nIn 1885, the British administration tasked Wyre with Wari's development as a residential area. Wyre embarked on clearing jungles, constructing roads, and dividing the land into residential plots. Plots were priced at six rupees per bigha and primarily distributed to government employees, with a stipulation that houses must be built within three years, subject to approval by the magistrate. Although plots sold swiftly, full occupancy of the area was delayed likely due to financial constraints of the landowners.\nFollowing its transformation into a residential hub in the early 20th century, Wari was described as having clean thoroughfares and a sparse populace. The dwellings, largely inhabited by middle-class residents, exhibited distinct characteristics, resembling rural homes with predominantly single-storey structures and open lawns. Wari evolved into a Hindu-majority area as government jobs were primarily held by Hindus at the time, most of whom later migrated to India following the partition. As Dhaka expanded and better opportunities arose elsewhere, many families relocated to other areas within the city.\nIn 2012, Wari Thana was established with a population of approximately 2.6 lakh residents.\nGeography\nThe area of the police jurisdiction is approximately , extending from Gopibag Railway Crossing in the north, Nababpur Road in the west, Narinda Road Crossing in the south, and in the east from the Christian cemetery until Swamibag Railway Crossing.\nGallery\nFile:Dhaka Christian cemetery, wari.jpg|Christian cemetery\nFile:Doel chattar, wari 2.jpg|Doel Square\nFile:ওয়ারী থানা ধ্বংসত্ব.jpg|Vandalized Wari police station in 2024\nReferences"
