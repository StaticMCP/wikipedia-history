For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003. Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n43 Vict.\nThe seventh session of the 21st Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 5 February 1880 until 24 March 1880.\nThere were no local acts passed during this session.\nPublic general acts\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  1867, 1877, and 1879.|note4= }}\n}}\nPrivate acts\n|private|1|19-03-1880|repealed=n|archived=n|An Act to naturalize Luitbert Alexander George Lionel Alphons Freiherr Von Pawel Rammingen, and to grant and confer on him all the rights, privileges, and capacities of a natural-horn Subject of Her Majesty the Queen.}}\n}}\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  |pages=498 |via=Google Books}}\n43 & 44 Vict.\nThe first session of the 22nd Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 29 April 1880 until 7 September 1880.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and for other purposes relating thereto.}}\n|  and the Industrial Schools Act (Ireland), 1868. }}\n|\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  so far as regards certain Fees and Expenses and Sums receivable and payable by the Board of Trade.}}\n|  or '''Mundella's Education Act|public|23|26-08-1880|archived=n|An Act to make further provision as to Byelaws respecting the attendance of Children at School under the Elementary Education Acts.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n}}\n|\n| or the Drainage and Improvement of Lands Supplemental (Ireland) Act 1880|local|3|29-06-1880|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to confirm a Provisional Order under the Drainage and Improvement of Lands (Ireland) Act, 1863, and the Acts amending the same.|po1=Garristown and Delvin River Order 1880|In the matter of Garristown and Delvin River Drainage District, in the counties of Dublin and Meath.}}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  and for conferring Powers upon the Cardiff Waterworks Company; and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and 1871. }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  to be acquired, and to authorise that Company to raise additional Capital; and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  to vary the provisions of the said Act, to discharge the Hendon Rural Sanitary Authority from the obligation to maintain portions of a certain road, to impose on them the obligation to maintain another portion of the same road; and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and the Public Health Act, 1875, relating to the Borough of Conway.|po1=Conway Gas Order 1880|}}\n|  relating to the county of Salop.|po1=Salop Order 1880|}}\n| or the Drainage and Improvement of Lands Supplemental (Ireland) Act 1880'''|local|35|09-07-1880|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to confirm a Provisional Order under the Drainage and Improvement of Lands (Ireland) Act, 1863, and the Acts amending the same.|po1=Currygrane Order 1880|}}\n|\n|  and the Metropolitan Commons Amendment Act, 1869, relating to Staines Commons.|po1=Staines Common Scheme.|po1short=n}}\n|\n|  relating to the Burgh of Broughty Ferry.|note4=|po1=|po1short=n}}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  and 1875.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  and for the making and maintaining of another Bridge in lieu thereof; and for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|  and the Corris Railway Act, 1864, and to confer further powers upon the Corris Railway Company; and for other purposes.}}\n|  for the completion of the Docks, Railways, and Works by that Act authorised, and for enabling the Earl of Jersey to act as a Harbour Trustee.}}\n|  and for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to the City of Canterbury, and an Order of the Local Government Board under the provisions of the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act, 1876, amended and extended by the Poor Law Act, 1879, relating to the parishes of Bepton, Chithurst, Farnhurst, Iping, Kirdford, Linch, Linchmere, Lodsworth, Lurgashall, Selham, Stedham, Terwick, Trotton, and Woolbeding, and to the Tything of North Ambersham.|po1=Canterbury Order 1880|\n|po2=Bepton, &c.
