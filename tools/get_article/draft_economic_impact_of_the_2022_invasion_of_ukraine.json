The Ukrainian economy was already recovering from the pandemic when the war halted production, closed ports and triggered the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War. Official estimates indicate that Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) collapsed by almost 30 % in 2022, wiping out years of growth. The National Bank of Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund expect growth to rebound above 4 % in coming years, yet baseline forecasts still predict that Ukraine’s real GDP will not return to its pre‑war level until the early 2030s. Reconstruction and recovery needs are enormous: direct damage to infrastructure and productive capacity exceeded US$ 152 billion by the end of 2023, and total reconstruction needs are estimated at US$ 486 billion.\nThe conflict also reverberated across Eastern Europe and global markets. Sanctions against Russia restricted trade and financial flows, pushing up energy and commodity prices. Regional neighbours such as Poland faced supply‑chain disruptions and surging inflation. This report uses publicly available data to quantify the economic impact of the war, focusing on Ukraine while comparing trends in Russia and Poland. It analyses GDP growth, inflation and exports of goods and services from 2019–2024 to capture pre‑war conditions, the shock of 2022 and the early recovery.\nMethodology\nData sources\nWorld Bank World Development Indicators: GDP growth (annual %, indicator NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG), consumer price inflation (annual %, indicator FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG) and exports of goods and services (balance of payments, current US$, indicator BX.GSR.GNFS.CD) for Ukraine, Russia and Poland were retrieved via the World Bank API. These series provide consistent cross‑country data. For example, Ukraine’s GDP growth values show 3.20 % in 2019, ‑3.75 % in 2020, 3.45 % in 2021, ‑28.76 % in 2022, 5.53 % in 2023 and an estimated 2.91 % in 2024. Poland’s GDP growth was 4.58 % in 2019 and fell to ‑2.04 % in 2020, then surged to 6.93 % in 2021 and remained positive despite the war. Russia’s GDP growth dropped from 2.20 % in 2019 to ‑2.65 % in 2020, rebounded to 5.87 % in 2021, contracted by ‑1.44 % in 2022 and recovered to roughly 4 % in 2023–2024.\nWorld Bank inflation data: Ukraine’s consumer price inflation climbed from 7.89 % in 2019 to 20.18 % in 2022, before moderating to 12.85 % in 2023 and 6.50 % in 2024. Poland’s inflation surged from 2.23 % (2019) to 14.43 % in 2022 and 11.53 % in 2023 before easing to 3.78 % in 2024. Russia’s inflation is reported through 2021 (6.69 %); official figures for 2022 onward are scarce because of sanctions and data restrictions.\nWorld Bank export data: Exports of goods and services provide a proxy for external trade. Ukraine’s exports were around US$ 81.3 billion in 2021 but fell to US$ 57.4 billion in 2022 and US$ 51.3 billion in 2023. Poland’s exports grew from US$ 392.7 billion in 2021 to US$ 478.6 billion in 2024. Russia’s export data were not used because sanctions and oil‑price swings complicate direct comparison.\nEuropean Parliament Briefing (2024): Narrative insights on the economic impact of the war were drawn from a briefing by the European Parliament’s Economic Governance and EMU Scrutiny Unit. This document notes that Ukraine’s goods trade deficit approached US$ 40 billion by end‑2023 and that total exports remain less than half of their pre‑war level. It also highlights that inflation peaked at 26.6 % at the end of 2022 and subsequently returned to the National Bank of Ukraine’s target range.\nAnalytical approach\nData were compiled for 2019–2024 to capture pre‑war baseline, the pandemic, the invasion year and the early recovery. Using Python (pandas and matplotlib), time‑series charts were created for each indicator. No econometric model was applied; the analysis is descriptive, highlighting changes over time and comparing Ukraine with Russia and Poland. All monetary values for exports are expressed in current US$ billions. Missing data for Russia after 2021 are denoted as “not available” (NaN).\nData analysis\nGDP growth\nUkraine’s economy expanded modestly before the invasion: GDP growth averaged around 3 % in 2019 and 2021, contracted during the pandemic (‑3.75 % in 2020) and then collapsed ‑28.76 % in 2022. The economy partially rebounded in 2023 with 5.53 % growth and is projected to grow 2.91 % in 2024. In contrast, Poland experienced only a short pandemic recession (‑2.04 % in 2020) and maintained positive growth throughout the war, albeit slowing to 0.25 % in 2023. Russia’s GDP contracted by 1.44 % in 2022 and recovered quickly; high oil revenues and import substitution cushioned the impact of sanctions.\nThe figure below compares GDP growth rates for the three countries.\nInflation\nUkraine’s consumer price inflation rose from single digits to 20.18 % in 2022 amid supply disruptions, currency depreciation and wartime shortages. Monetary tightening and declining global energy prices helped bring inflation back to 6.50 % in 2024. Poland faced its own inflation surge: annual inflation jumped to 14.43 % in 2022 and 11.53 % in 2023 before falling to 3.78 % in 2024. Russia’s inflation data are missing after 2021; however, estimates suggest a spike above 12 % in 2022 followed by moderation. The chart below illustrates inflation trends for Ukraine and Poland.\nExports of goods and services\nTrade patterns underscore the scale of disruption. Ukraine’s exports of goods and services rose to US$ 81.28 billion in 2021 but dropped by nearly one‑third to US$ 57.42 billion in 2022. Exports fell further to US$ 51.29 billion in 2023, reflecting blocked Black Sea ports, destroyed industrial capacity and the loss of metallurgical and mineral exports. Poland, by contrast, continued to expand exports despite global uncertainties, rising from US$ 392.70 billion in 2021 to US$ 478.58 billion in 2024. The divergence highlights how war‑related destruction and trade blockades hit Ukraine’s external sector, whereas Poland benefited from diversified industries and access to EU markets. The following figure compares exports (in current US$ billions) for Ukraine and Poland.\nFindings\n1. War‑induced economic collapse in Ukraine. The World Bank data corroborate official reports that Ukraine’s GDP contracted by almost 30 % in 2022; our series shows a ‑28.76 % decline. Such a contraction dwarfs the pandemic recession and underscores the extent of destruction. Though growth bounced back to 5.53 % in 2023, the level of economic activity remains far below pre‑war output. The European Parliament briefing expects Ukraine’s real GDP to reach its 2021 level only by 2030.\n2. Divergent growth paths in neighbouring economies. Poland’s economy demonstrates resilience. After a short recession in 2020, growth rebounded strongly (6.93 % in 2021) and remained positive through 2024, even though high inflation and energy prices slowed momentum. Russia’s GDP contracted by only 1.44 % in 2022 and recovered quickly; high oil revenues and import substitution cushioned the impact of sanctions. This divergence highlights that the war’s economic costs are borne disproportionately by Ukraine.\n3. Inflationary surges and policy responses. Ukraine’s inflation rate peaked at around 20 % in 2022 and eased to 6.5 % in 2024, reflecting tight monetary policy and declining energy prices. The European Parliament notes that inflation briefly reached 26.6 % in late 2022 before returning to the National Bank’s target range. Poland experienced a similar inflation shock, reaching 14.4 % in 2022; its central bank responded with aggressive rate hikes. Russia’s inflation path is unclear due to limited data.\n4. Trade disruption and shifting exports. Ukraine’s exports collapsed by roughly 29 % in 2022 and remained depressed in 2023. The European Parliament briefing notes that the goods trade deficit approached US$ 40 billion and exports are still less than half of pre‑war levels. Metal and mineral exports have been severely curtailed, while cereals and other agricultural products were partially rerouted through alternative corridors. Poland’s exports continued to grow despite the shock, indicating that its trade channels were more diversified and less vulnerable to conflict.\nConclusion\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered an economic collapse unparalleled in recent European history. GDP contracted by nearly one‑third in 2022, inflation surged to double digits and exports plummeted. Although stabilisation efforts and external support helped GDP growth turn positive in 2023 and inflation decline, the level of economic activity remains far below pre‑war norms. In contrast, Poland maintained growth and managed inflation through monetary tightening, while Russia’s economy showed resilience due to high commodity revenues and import substitution.\nLooking forward, Ukraine’s recovery depends on ending hostilities, rebuilding destroyed infrastructure and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The European Parliament projects that reconstruction and recovery will require hundreds of billions of dollars. International aid, access to export markets and structural reforms will be crucial for Ukraine to restore living standards and converge towards European neighbours. For policy makers, the findings underline the need for sustained financial support, targeted infrastructure investment and trade facilitation to accelerate recovery. At the same time, diversification and resilient supply chains in neighbouring economies helped cushion the blow, offering lessons on economic preparedness in the face of geopolitical shocks.\nReferernce\nEuropean Parliament, Economic Governance and EMU Scrutiny Unit.
