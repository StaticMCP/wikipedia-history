      "text": "# United Kingdom Postal Clerks' Association\n\nThe '''United Kingdom Postal Clerks' Association''' was a trade union representing post office workers in the UK.\nHistory\nThe union was founded in 1887 by postal sorters working outside London.  Those in London had already attempted and failed to form a lasting union, and soon afterwards succeeded in forming the Fawcett Association, which remained a rival to the UKPCA.  The UKPCA also began recruiting post office counter clerks and writers.\nThe union was initially based in Liverpool, and never developed strength outside North West England.  From 1895, it was instead run from Manchester.\nIn 1901, the union affiliated to the Trades Union Congress.  In 1906, the union's executive proposed affiliation to the Labour Party, but members heavily rejected the idea, and the union instead adopted a position of being non-political.\nThe union discussed a potential merger with the Fawcett Society in 1907, but members were apathetic, and this did not proceed.  Despite this, the union continued to grow, employing Lucy Withrington as its women's officer from 1908, and reaching 7,724 members by 1912.\nIn 1911, the union instead began discussing a potential merger with the Postal Telegraph Clerks' Association.  This was achieved in 1914, with the new union becoming known as the Postal and Telegraph Clerks' Association.\nGeneral Secretaries\n:1887: George Lascelles\n:1893: Paul Casey\n:1895: George Landsberry\n:1901: Ernest Lea\n:1911: Albert Varley\nReferences"
