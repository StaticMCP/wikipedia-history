The first endorsement was in 1852 for Winfield Scott, and the most recent one was for Kamala Harris in 2024. Its first seven endorsements after Scott were for Republicans, and it was not until 1884 that it backed its first Democrat, Grover Cleveland.  In total it has endorsed the Democratic candidate twenty nine times, the Republican thirteen times (the last being Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956), a Whig candidate once (Winfield Scott in 1852), and a third-party candidate once (John M. Palmer in 1896).\nPrimary elections\nDemocratic Party\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col | Endorsement\n! scope=col | Result\n|-\n! scope=row | 2000\n| data-sort-value=\"Gore, Al\" | Al Gore\n| Won\n|-\n! scope=row | 2004\n| data-sort-value=\"Kerry, John\" | John Kerry\n| Won\n|-\n! scope=row | 2008\n| data-sort-value=\"Clinton, Hillary\" | Hillary Clinton\n| Lost\n|-\n! scope=row | 2012\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n! scope=row | 2016\n| data-sort-value=\"Clinton, Hillary\" | Hillary Clinton\n| Won\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=\"2\" | 2020\n| data-sort-value=\"Warren, Elizabeth\" | Elizabeth Warren\n| Lost\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"Klobuchar, Amy\" | Amy Klobuchar\n| Lost\n|}\nRepublican Party\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col | Endorsement\n! scope=col | Result\n|-\n! scope=row | 2000\n| data-sort-value=\"McCain, John\" | John McCain\n| Lost\n|-\n! scope=row | 2004\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n! scope=row | 2008\n| data-sort-value=\"McCain, John\" | John McCain\n| Won\n|-\n! scope=row | 2012\n| colspan=\"5\"\n|-\n! scope=row | 2016\n| data-sort-value=\"Kasich, John\" | John Kasich\n| Lost\n|-\n! scope=row | 2020\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|}\nGeneral election\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\"\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" | Endorsement\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"6\" | Other major candidate(s)\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ref.\n|-\n! 1852\n| style=\"background-color:\" | &nbsp;\n| data-sort-value=\"Scott, Winfield\" | Winfield Scott\n| Lost\n|\n| style=\"background-color:\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=\"5\"  | Franklin Pierce\n| rowspan=\"1\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1856\n| style=\"background-color:\" | &nbsp;\n| data-sort-value=\"Frémont, John C.\" | John C.
