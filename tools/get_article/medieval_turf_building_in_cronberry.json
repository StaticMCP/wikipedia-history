      "text": "# Medieval turf building in Cronberry\n\nExcavations in Cronberry, East Ayrshire, Scotland by Headland Archaeology revealed a medieval turf building and a nearby enclosure, also constructed of turf, of unknown date. The turf structure was sub-rectangular and contained a hearth surrounded by paving. Pottery dating to no later than the 16th century was recovered from the interior.\nThe plan of the turf building was exposed during excavation. Due to the construction's materials and nature, it had been greatly affected by soil processes since it went out of use. The walls appear to have been made from a mixture of turf and local soil. Preservation was found to vary with the south end being best preserved. Extensive slumping had occurred and this, combined with subsequent decay, made excavation difficult. The presence of charcoal and charred cereal grains within the walls suggested that material from earlier occupation may have been incorporated and the remains may have represented more than one structural phase.\nIn the interior of the building, the floor level was indicated by the hearth and slabs. Elsewhere, the floor was likely to have been of beaten earth, which is no longer recognisable due to soil mixing. There was no evidence for internal partitions.\nSee also\n* Vernacular architecture\n* Earth shelter\n* Cob (material)\nReferences\n* Baker, L.
