Montgomery (born July 3, 1955) is an American economist, academic, and politician who previously served as the president of Western Michigan University. He is one of the key players in helping pull the United States out of the automotive crisis.\nBiography\nMontgomery graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1973 and was inducted into their alumni hall of fame in 2010.

In 1990, he was appointed at the rank of associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he became a full professor in 1992.  From 1997 to 1999 Montgomery served as chief economist of the United States Department of Labor in the administration of President Bill Clinton.

During his first year at WMU, Montgomery has spoken at length on the need for transformational change. His 2017 and 2018 State of the university addresses detail this philosophy and the specific initiatives proposed to meet that goal.\nOn September 12, 2024, Montgomery announced that he would be retiring as president on June 30, 2025.\nMontgomery married in 1994 and has three children.
