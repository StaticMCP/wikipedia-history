A question was added to record the number of rooms in a household, in response to concerns about overcrowding in cities. This was also the first census to employ women census takers and the first to ask in Wales about the ability to speak the Welsh language.\nThe total population of England, Wales and Scotland was recorded as 33,015,701.\nSee also\n*Census in the United Kingdom\n*List of United Kingdom censuses\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## 1891 United Kingdom Census\n\n#REDIRECT 1891 United Kingdom census"
