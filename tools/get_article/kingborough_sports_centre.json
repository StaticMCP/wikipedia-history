The centre caters for indoor sports such as volleyball, basketball and netball.\nWork began in 1978 on a four-level complex that was finished in 1979 at a cost of $1.3 million.\nThe Hobart Devils in the National Basketball League (NBL) played at KSC between 1983 and 1988, as did the Hobart Islanders in the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) between 1986 and 1996, winning the 1991 title.\nThe Hobart Chargers in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) initially played at KSC, winning three South Conference titles in 1997, 1998 and 2000 in front of fans at Kingston before the club shifted closer to the city centre. The Hobart Huskies played their home games in the NBL1 at KSC in 2019. The Chargers returned to KSC in 2021.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.kingborough.tas.gov.au/recreation-facilities/ksc/ Kingborough Sports Centre - Official Site]"
