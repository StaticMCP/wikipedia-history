Mass enlistments and military conscription drew hundreds of players in the National Football League (NFL) to the colors, greatly impacting both team rosters and players' careers. Some players were able to continue to play football while in the military as part of the military service teams which proliferated as a focus for physical training and source of mass entertainment. Hundreds of NFL players had their playing careers interrupted or terminated by the conflict for months or years, losing seasons in their athletic prime.\nThis is a sortable list of players in the NFL who were active at their time of induction and who served in the American military at some point between 1940 and 1945. It includes their team at time of induction, position, branch of military service, year of enlistment, service details, and information on the military service teams on which they played during the war, if known.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
