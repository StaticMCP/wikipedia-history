He is Professor of History at the Australian National University in Canberra.\nEarly life and education\nMartin Thomas attended Pennant Hills High School in northwest Sydney. In 1983 he worked at Lake Vyrnwy in Wales, the subject of his radio essay Returning to Wales (2005).  He later studied at the University of Sydney, graduating with Honours in History. In 1988 he began to work as an independent essayist, critic, and writer/producer for ABC Radio. In 1995 he began doctoral research at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) where he later worked as a postdoctoral fellow.  His PhD thesis was published as The Artificial Horizon: Imagining the Blue Mountains (2003).\nCareer\nThomas has published on Australian and trans-national cultural history, especially as it relates to perceptions of place, representations of landscape, and narratives of cross-cultural encounter. He has worked extensively on early Australian anthropology and the history of exploration.  Since the release of his edited book Expedition into Empire (2014) he has become known for his work on the expedition as a socio-cultural formation.  His critical engagement with histories of exploration has involved long-term, collaborative research with Indigenous communities, especially in northern Australia where he studied the impact of the 1948 American-Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land.  This has opened new perspectives on how expeditions are understood by cultures that were allegedly ‘explored’ by outsiders.\nThomas was a research fellow at the University of Sydney in the early 2000s. He had a Smithsonian Fellowship in 2008 where he studied collections relating to the American-Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land.\nIn 2010 he joined the Australian National University as an Australian Research Council Future Fellow, later becoming Professor of History.  In 2018 he was announced as the Keith Cameron Chair in Australian history at University College Dublin.  In 2020-21 he was Visiting Co-Director of the Menzies Australia Institute at King’s College London.\nAs an academic, he has made works for radio and co-produced a feature-length documentary film. He is also an oral history interviewer for the National Library of Australia.\nIndigenous human remains\nThomas is an advocate for the repatriation of Indigenous ancestral remains that were stolen or collected in the name of science. He has done detailed research on the scientific collecting of human remains and its impact upon Indigenous beliefs about the spirit world and the afterlife.  These themes are explored in the film Etched in Bone (co-produced with Béatrice Bijon) (2018), the essay ‘Because It’s Your Country’ (2013), and the book Clever Men (2025).\nRecognition and honours\n2025.
