Typically, a set-aside cover crop is topped in July or August, to prevent seed production and subsequent soil contamination leading to germination and regrowth.  For example, controlling the spread of Soft rush or Juncus Effusus on wet land, such as Purple Moor and Rush Pastures.\nA variation of topping is often employed in order to create a more stout and bushy plant, one that is suitable for thriving indoors.\nSee also\n* Tree topping\nReferences"
