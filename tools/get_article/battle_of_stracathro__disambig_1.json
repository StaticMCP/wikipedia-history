This invasion was launched by the joint forces of Moray and Ross at an opportunistic moment to destabilise David I of Scotland's control as he was visiting England. David had spent most of 1130 in England to serve as a judge at Henry I's court, as well as to attend the dedication service of Canterbury Cathedral.\nThe rebellion was led by two pretenders to the Scottish crown, Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair (Malcolm)—the illegitimate son of Alexander I of Scotland—and Óengus of Moray (Angus). Angus was the grandson of King Lulach who had been deposed and killed by David's father Malcolm \"Canmore\". Details of the invasion are sparse in the historical record; however, it is recognised that the aim was to depose David and replace him with Angus—as a legitimate heir.\nThe forces loyal to David were led by Edward, Constable of Scotland. Edward's army defeated the invading rebellion at Stracathro. Óengus of Moray was killed in the battle. Contemporary reports differ in the scale of the loss of the rebels, with some estimating as many as 4,000 may have been killed but other sources claiming a much smaller battle.\nMalcolm, having escaped, took up the mantle as the new pretender to the Scottish crown after the death of Angus. He was later betrayed in 1134 and imprisoned in Roxburgh by David for life.\nReferences"
