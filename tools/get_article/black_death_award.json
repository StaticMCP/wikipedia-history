It is presented to players only in the case of \"exceptional, near perfect play.\"\nThe award was first instituted by Army coach Jim Young in 1988. In 2007, Stan Brock, as the new head coach, reinstated the award. The award itself consists of a plaque featuring an Army Ranger-style knife and engraved with the honoree's name. According to Brock, it is given to players who go \"above and beyond\" and play \"a near perfect game and have something to do with the outcome of the game for a victory.\"\nRecent honorees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Year !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Player !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Position !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Achievement\n|-\n| 2007 || LTC Greg Gadson || align=\"center\"| LB ||\n|-\n| 2007 || Mike Wright || align=\"center\"| WR || vs. Tulane (20–17)\n|-\n| 2008 || Frank Scappaticci || align=\"center\"| LB || vs. Louisiana Tech (14–7)\n|-\n| 2008 || Collin Mooney || align=\"center\"| RB || vs. Tulane (44–17)\n|}\nSources:\nReferences"
