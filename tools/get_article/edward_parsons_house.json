Built in 1877, this -story wood-frame house is an unusual local small-scale example of Stick style.  Its gables are decorated with applied wood.  The porch is further decorated with chamfered posts, brackets, and rosettes.  Nothing is known of its first owner, Edward Parsons, who was listed as a \"gentleman\" in the local business directory.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts\nReferences"
