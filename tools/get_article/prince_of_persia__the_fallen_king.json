It was released for the Nintendo DS in December 2008, as a spin-off of Prince of Persia. The plot, taking place in ancient Persia, concerns the player character's role in a celestial battle between two gods: Ahriman and Ormazd. The player assumes the role of the Prince and Zal, fighting Ahriman's forces with a variety of different physical and magical attacks. Prince of Persia: The Fallen King has received mixed reviews, with the most agreed-upon problem being the control scheme.\n| MC = 64/100\n| 1UP = C\n| GI = 6/10\n| GSpot = 6/10\n| GameZone = 6.5/10\n| IGN = 6.8/10\n| NP = 7/10\n| ONM = 80%\n| PALGN = 6.5/10\n| VG = 6/10\n}}\nPrince of Persia: The Fallen King was met with modest reviews by critics, earning a score of 64.63% on GameRankings and 64 out of 100 on Metacritic. The main gripe among reviewers seemed to be the control scheme. IGN reviewer Matt Casamassina called the control scheme \"ultimately passable, even allowing for some fun moments... [but] not superior to traditional controls\". Casamassina found it less responsive and reliable on most occasions. 1UP.com reviewer Anthony Gallegos also criticized the control scheme, and lack of control options saying the controls were \"more immediately intuitive... [but not] necessary\". Gallegos elaborated further, stating that he would have appreciated the option for a D-pad controlled game.\nAnother criticism was the length of the game, with some reviewers citing that it was too lengthy. 1UP.com reviewer Gallegos said he enjoyed the game initially, but it quickly got old and began to \"[feel] artificially long, as though a few good ideas were tossed into a random level-generator and then slapped together until a game of desirable length formed\". He further admitted that \"if the team behind The Fallen King had just made it a lot shorter and perhaps added some additional challenges, like time trials, it might have helped with the diminishing returns I felt from each successive level\".\nAn aspect that was liked, however, by GameSpot reviewer Carolyn Petit, was the Prince character. She proposed that he was \"a good deal more likable than ... in the console game\". She also said that despite Prince having constant wisecracks, he's fighting for something he cares about deeply. IGN reviewer Casamassina, in contrast, criticized the way the Prince was portrayed, saying that \"the DS Prince ... just doesn't exude much visual charm\", and that, \"in contrast ... he's the worst looking iteration of the character since the franchise's reboot a generation ago\".\nReferences"
