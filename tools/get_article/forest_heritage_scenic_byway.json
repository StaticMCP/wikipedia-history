It features the Cradle of Forestry, waterfalls, trails and scenic vistas.\nRoute description\nThe scenic byway begins at the intersection of  US&nbsp;64 and NC&nbsp;215, near Rosman (el. ).  Traveling north, along the banks of the North Fork French Broad River, it reaches the Balsam Grove community; there, access to Courthouse Falls can be reach via Forest Road 140.  At Pinhook Gap (el. ) the scenic byway enters through a small stretch of Jackson County before returning into Transylvania County.  At Beech Gap (el.  and highest point), the scenic byway enters Haywood County and connects with the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Descending from the Pisgah Ridge, it soon follows the West Fork Pigeon River to Lake Logan (el. ); where originally existed a logging town known as Sunburst, until a devastating wildfire in 1925 closed the mill and then it was submerged by the lake in 1933.\nIn Woodrow (el. ), named for President Woodrow Wilson, the scenic byway switches from NC&nbsp;215 onto US&nbsp;276 towards Brevard.  The scenic byway, now following the East Fork Pigeon River, slowly ascends between Cold Mountain and Mount Pisgah.  At Shining Creek Gap (el. ) is where the Shining Rock Trail Head is located and the beginning of the National Scenic Byway; making a curve and crossing over the East Fork Pigeon River, the scenic byway now quickly climbs up the Pisgah Ridge again.  Crossing back into Transylvania County at Wagon Road Gap (el. ), it connects again with the Blue Ridge Parkway before making a switchback descent into the Pink Beds.\nThe Pink Beds is an upland bog with dense growth of pink blooming rhododendrons and laurels.  Located nearby is the Cradle of Forestry, where the very first school of forestry, the Biltmore Forest School, was founded by Carl A. Schenck in 1898.  Three miles south from the Cradle of Forestry is Sliding Rock (el. ), a popular summertime location where visitors can get cool by sliding on rocks and into the pool below.  Nearby is Looking Glass Falls, named by the mountain its on, the water appears like a mirror gleaming off its granite face.  The Pisgah Forest National Fish Hatchery, located in the former logging camp of John Rock and along the Davidson River, is where trout is raised and released in the area rivers.\nNear Brevard is the Pisgah Visitor Center, where once stood a community around the Sycamore Flats area(el. ) and stands the historic English Chapel (1860-1940).  Visitors may also see a pair of stone pillars, which were built to honor Transylvania County residents who served in World War I and also mark the border of the Pisgah National Forest.  At the intersection of US&nbsp;64/US&nbsp;276 and NC&nbsp;280, both the North Carolina Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway ends; the National Forest Scenic Byway, however, continues along US&nbsp;64, through Brevard, to meet back with NC&nbsp;215 to make a complete loop.  Despite the overlap along US&nbsp;64, no byway signage is marked along this section.\nA majority of the scenic byway was built along former railroad tracks that were used for logging operations in the area in the late 19th and early 20th century.  The highways, both NC&nbsp;215 and US&nbsp;276, have 9% grades and curves that may require some drivers and most truckers to slow as much as ; thus the scenic byway is not recommended for recreational vehicles or buses.\nEach byway varies in length and general focus.  The National Forest Scenic Byway is the longest and makes a loop along NC&nbsp;215, US&nbsp;276 and US&nbsp;64 (as shown in article).  The National Scenic Byway is the shortest with  along US&nbsp;276.  The North Carolina Scenic Byway is  along NC&nbsp;215 and US&nbsp;276.\nHistory\nThe Forest Heritage Scenic Byway was established in 1989 as a United States Forest Service (USFS); in 1990, it also became a North Carolina Scenic Byway.  In 2009, part of US&nbsp;276 portion of the scenic byway was also designated as a National Scenic Byway, by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT).\nJunction list\n]]\n|notes=National Forest Scenic Byway begins}}\n|notes=Switch between US&nbsp;276 and NC&nbsp;215}}\n|notes=Switch between US&nbsp;64 and US&nbsp;276}}\n|notes=}}\n|notes=}}\n|notes=National Forest Scenic Byway ends}}\nSee also\n* Cherohala Skyway\n* Foothills Parkway\n* Mountain Waters Scenic Byway\n* North Carolina Bicycle Route 8\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://archive.today/20140711162510/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/77229 Forest Heritage National Scenic Byway]\n* [http://www.fs.usda.gov/r08/northcarolina National Forests in North Carolina]"
