He received his M.A. in 1894 and PhD. in 1895, both from Harvard University under William G. Farlow and Roland Thaxter. He became a Professor of Natural History at Middlebury College in 1895, then both a Professor of Botany at the Henry Shaw School of Botany at Washington University in St. Louis, and a mycologist for the Missouri Botanical Garden in 1913. He also worked on a systematic description of basidiomycetes such as Merulius and fungi from Vermont, Siberia, and Java.\nThe Septobasidium species S. burtii is named in his honor.\nReferences"
