The team competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). Formerly members of the Northeast Conference, the Colonials were originally intended to compete in the 2020 season as an FCS independent before becoming a football-only member of the Big South Conference in July 2021. The Colonials would ultimately join Big South football several months ahead of schedule. After  COVID-19 caused the Big South to move its fall 2020 season to spring 2021, with two teams playing in the fall and a third not playing at all in 2020–21, the conference brought RMU into its football league for its spring 2021 season. In 2023, after playing in the Big South in 2023, the team returned to play in the Northeast Conference in 2024.\nThe school's first football team was fielded in 1994. The team plays its home games at the 3,000 seat Joe Walton Stadium. They are currently led by fifth-year head coach Bernard Clark.\nHistory\nClassifications\n*1994–present: NCAA Division I–AA/FCS\nConference memberships\nOn June 15, Robert Morris Colonials announced leaving the Northeast Conference for the Horizon League in all sports except for football starting in 2020.
