She was employed as whaler, in the British northern whale fishery, sailing to Greenland and Davis Strait. From late 1793 she made at least one voyage as a West Indiaman. Although she was last listed in 1796, there is no evidence that she sailed again after late 1794.\nCareer\nQueen Charlotte first appeared in online records in 1786 as a northern fisheries whaler. On 24 July 1786 a newspaper reported that Queen Charlotte, Wheatley, master, had arrived in the Thames from Greenland with four \"fish\" (whales).\n{| class=\" wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Master\n!
