The Massachusetts primary was a semi-closed primary, with the state awarding 118 delegates towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of which 93 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nVice president Al Gore came in first with just shy of 60% and earned 58 delegates. Senator Bradley finished behind in second place with a little more than 37% and 35 delegates, while Uncommitted votes took a third-place finish with around 1% of the vote.\nProcedure\nMassachusetts was one of 15 states and one territory holding primaries on March 7, 2000, also known as \"Super Tuesday\".\nVoting took place throughout the state from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. In the semi-closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level to be considered viable. The 93 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 6 and 7 were allocated to each of the state's 10 congressional districts and another 12 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 20 at-large delegates.\nThe state party committee met and voted on the 20 at-large and 12 pledged PLEO delegates for the Democratic National Convention. The delegation was joined by 23 unpledged PLEO delegates: 9 members of the Democratic National Committee, 12 members of Congress (both senators, Ted Kennedy and John Kerry, and 10 representatives, John Olver, Richard Neal, Jim McGovern, Barney Frank, Marty Meehan, John Tierney, Ed Markey, Mike Capuano, Joe Moakley, and Bill Delahunt), 2 distinguished party leaders, and 2 add-ons.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"4\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
