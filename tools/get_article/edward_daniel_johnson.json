He was a founder member and vice President of the British Horological Institute, which was formed in June 1858.\nDuring his early career he worked out of Ashley Crescent in Shoreditch. Watches from this period (–1855) show the address as \"21 Ashley Crescent, City Road, London\" inscribed on the movement.\nIn 1855, he moved to 9 Wilmington Square, Clerkenwell where he produced the majority of his work. It was during this period that Johnson was involved with the founding of the British Horological Institute. Johnson was granted the Freedom of the City of London on 17 January 1860 by Redemption in the Company of Clockmakers.\nHe was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 10 May 1861.\nIn June 1873, the British Horological Institute ran an essay competition, sponsored by Baroness Burdett-Coutts. Johnson was involved with this, the title of which was \"The Compensation Balance and its Adjustment in Chronometers and Watches\".\nFrom 1875, the company was listed as \"Edward Daniel Johnson & Son\". Two of his sons worked in the watch manufacturing industry—Edward Henry and William George. The 'son' is believed to refer to Edward given that he lived at 10 Wilmington Square, which was inscribed on E. D. Johnson watch movements at this time.\nJohnson retired in 1879, by which time he was almost totally blind.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708165154/http://www.clockswatches.com/php/login.php?pg=showpage.php&em=1187 British & Irish Clock and Watch Makers]"
