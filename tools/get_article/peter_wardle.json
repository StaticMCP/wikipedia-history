He won a scholarship to University of Cambridge and completed a PhD under Alexander Stuart Watt. He returned to New Zealand to work at the Forest Service before being recruited by Eric Godley for the Botany Division of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. His scientific strength remained the botany and ecology of the lower South Island, where he had been raised.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1977 and awarded the society's Hector Medal in 1990. In the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours, Wardle was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to plant ecology.\nHe died on 6 December 2008 while crossing the Waimakariri River.\nSelected works\n* Vegetation of New Zealand (1991)\n* Scenic reserves of South Westland: a botanical survey of scenic and allied reserves of South Westland (1980)\n* Plants and landscape in Westland National Park (1979)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://scholar.google.co.nz/scholar?q=Peter+Wardle Google Scholar]"
