The single reached No.&nbsp;22 in the German singles chart.\nBackground\nRosenstolz's collaboration with Almond came about after the English singer received one of the pop duo's CDs from a journalist and then contacted the duo a few days later. The song they chose to work on together, \"Total Eclipse\", was written by American musician Kristian Hoffman and originally recorded by German singer Klaus Nomi, appearing on Nomi's 1981 debut album. Both AnNa&nbsp;R. and Peter Plate of Rosenstolz were fans of Nomi. Almond also met Nomi in New York many years earlier.\nFor Rosenstolz's collaboration with Hagen, the duo themselves contacted the German singer. They felt that the song they had written, \"Die schwarze Witwe\" (The black widow), was tailor-made for her.\n\"Total Eclipse\" and \"Die schwarze Witwe\" also appear on Rosenstolz's 2000 album Kassengift. However, the album's versions of the songs do not feature Almond and Hagen on vocals.\nTrack listing\nCD 1\nRosenstolz and Marc Almond are featured on the single cover.\n# \"Total Eclipse\" (Radio Version - Rosenstolz + Marc Almond) – 3:29\n# \"Die schwarze Witwe\" (Tarantula Radio Mix - Rosenstolz + Nina Hagen) – 4:22\n# \"Du atmest nicht\" (Rosenstolz + 2raumwohnung) – 3:50\n# \"Enfants des nuits\" – 5:23\nCD 2\nRosenstolz and Nina Hagen are featured on the single cover.\n# \"Total Eclipse\" (Long Version - Rosenstolz + Marc Almond) – 3:59\n# \"Die schwarze Witwe\" (Rosenstolz + Nina Hagen) – 3:53\n# \"Kassengift\" (Drag Mix) – 4:44\n# \"Les Larmes de Septembre\" – 4:43\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.myvideo.de/watch/4613282/Rosenstolz_Marc_Almond_Total_Eclipse \"Total Eclipse\" music video] (Adobe Flash) under official Rosenstolz profile on MyVideo (streamed copy where licensed)\n*[http://www.kristianhoffman.com/lyrics.htm#total \"Total Eclipse\" lyrics] at official Kristian Hoffman website"
