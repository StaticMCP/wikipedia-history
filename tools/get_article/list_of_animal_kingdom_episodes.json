Pope learns that Pete has forbidden anyone from dealing with the Codys. Officer Chadwick, J's contact in the Oceanside police, sets up a meeting with the Codys to discuss options for dealing with the DEA. They meet at Deran's bar and are surprised to see Livengood arrive with the officer. After vowing to destroy the family using every resource he can, Livengood is suddenly shot dead by Chadwick; Chadwick assures the shocked Codys that the killing will not be traced to them, but he expects to be well compensated for his services in the future.\n|LineColor       = 8888FF\n}}\n|ProdCode        = U13.14211\n|Viewers         = 0.85\n|ShortSummary    = In 1984, Smurf's attempt to lure Max into a trap through a local contact (Baz's mother, a local stripper) is unsuccessful. Smurf is violently confronted by Max, but Pope saves her by stabbing Max in the leg; Pope then witnesses Smurf kill Max. In the present, the Codys deal with Livengood's death; J and Pope pay smugglers to stage the death as a cartel hit. Deran and Craig meet with Frankie to discuss scoping out a job. Frankie meets with a higher-level hawala, a longshoreman operating out of a union hall, using a GPS to track where the money is being stored. Initially believing it to be in the hall, the Codys discover the tracker has entered a large port, where security will be air-tight. Pope and Craig comment on the impossibility of the job, but Deran states, with proper planning, there is a good chance they will be successful.\n|LineColor       = 8888FF\n}}\n|ProdCode        = U13.14212\n|Viewers         = 0.75\n|ShortSummary    = In 1984, the crew decides to rob Max's safe that contains cash, guns and a sizeable list of his underworld contacts which, much to Jake and Manny's chagrin, Smurf plans to use to build her own network. In the present, the Codys prepare to move on the port, though it shapes up to be difficult when Deran and J are unable to come up with a clear plan of action after scoping it out. Craig's drug abuse worsens, leading both Frankie and Pope to confront him over his reckless behavior and the risk it will pose on the job. FBI agents show up at the bar and question Deran about his association with Livengood, but they do not seem to suspect his involvement. J and Pope decide to cut ties with Chadwick. Pope finds out that Pete is moving the coke from the plane job, despite telling the Codys it was disposed of. When back at the house, Pope praises J for the way he has stepped up since Smurf's death and informs him of the situation with Pete.\n|LineColor       = 8888FF\n}}\n|ProdCode        = U13.14213\n|Viewers         = 0.68\n|ShortSummary    = In 1984, Smurf begins making plans to move into the Cody family home, and she reveals to Julia and Pope that she is pregnant. In the present, the Codys rob the port, but they are discovered and forced to flee both the man they are robbing and the police; however, the heist is ultimately successful. After getting her cut of the money, Frankie leaves the country. Renn continues to ignore Craig while living with her cousins; she attempts to send a friend to collect both her and Nick's things, but Craig refuses. Enraged at Pete's lies about the cocaine, Pope and J confront Pete; Pope rips one of Pete's eyes out as a punishment and threatens to do worse if he does not give them their cut. The Codys share a family dinner where J and Deran, finally working together as the leaders of the family, outline their plan to sell off Smurf's apartment buildings and buy a series of businesses to launder money through. To everyone's surprise, Deran decides to start laundering money through his bar, which had previously been just his legitimate side business. As they celebrate, the police discover Catherine's body buried at a new housing development.\n|LineColor       = 8888FF\n}}\n}}\nSeason 6 (2022)\n|director= |writer= |airdate= |airdateR= |prodcode= |viewers= |country=U.S. |episodes=\n|ProdCode        = U13.14551\n|Viewers         = 0.47\n|ShortSummary    = In 1992 (flashback), the twins and Baz steal some desktops from their high school to negative consequences.
