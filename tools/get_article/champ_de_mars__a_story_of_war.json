He is estranged from his family and friends, and feels intense guilt about something that happened while he was in active duty.\n* A psychologist who works with young war veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder. She, herself, suffers from compassion fatigue, and seeks solace in Klezmer clarinet lessons.\n* An action film maker who hopes to direct a masterpiece, an Apocalypse Now for this generation.
