The Warriors play their home games at Kaiser Permanente Arena. Prior to the move to Santa Cruz for the 2012–13 season, the team was known as the Dakota Wizards. The team has won a championship in each of three leagues it has been a part of, and they are the only NBA G League team to reach the championship in three consecutive seasons.\nHistory\nDakota Wizards\nThe Warriors began play in 1995 in the International Basketball Association (IBA), and in 2001, with Dave Joerger at the helm, they won the IBA championship in the league's final year of operation.\nFollowing the 2000–01 season, the IBA merged with several teams from the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and in their first year in the new CBA, Joerger and the Wizards won the league title, defeating the Rockford Lightning. After making it to the semifinals in the 2002–03 season, the Wizards again won the league title in 2004 over the Idaho Stampede, giving Joerger his third title as the Wizards' head coach.\nJoerger left the Wizards following the 2003–04 season, and after his departure, the Wizards made it to the semifinals in 2004–05 then missed the playoffs the following season.\nPrior to the 2006–07 season, the Wizards joined the NBA Development League, and Joerger returned to Dakota as head coach. He won his fourth title with the Wizards in their first year in the D-League. In the Championship Game, forward Darius Rice came off the Wizards bench to put together a record-setting night that led the Wizards to a 129–121 overtime victory over the Colorado 14ers. Rice scored 52 points and made 11 three-pointers, including one with 4.5 seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime tied at 109. Rice's points and three-point field goal totals set D-League championship game records.\nBetween 2007–08 and 2009–10, the Wizards made the playoffs every season but were unable to return to the Finals. This was followed by a 2010–11 season that saw the Wizards miss postseason action for the first time since 2006.\nOn June 28, 2011, the Golden State Warriors, led by Co-Executive Chairmen Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, purchased the Wizards franchise from Bismarck Professional Basketball LLC. The Warriors became the fourth NBA team to own and operate their own NBA D-League affiliate, joining San Antonio, Oklahoma City and the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe Wizards remained in Bismarck during the 2011–12 season, but the Warriors were open to relocating the team to Northern California in 2012. To reflect the new ownership, the Wizards debuted with a new color scheme, the Warriors' blue and gold, used as an alternative to the purple and green, which dates back to their IBA days. The old color scheme was still used with the team's road uniforms, while the blue and gold was used with the home uniforms and the logo. The Wizards were led by Edwin Ubiles in 2011–12, as he helped the team return to the playoffs with a 29–21 record. However, they were unable to move on past the first round following a 2–0 defeat at the hands of the Bakersfield Jam.\nSanta Cruz Warriors\nFollowing intense off-season discussions regarding a move, on October 10, 2012, the Golden State Warriors announced that the Dakota Wizards would relocate to Santa Cruz beginning with the 2012–13 season. The team was subsequently renamed the Santa Cruz Warriors.\nIn the 2012 NBA Development League Draft, the Warriors selected Travis Leslie with their first pick (13th overall), as Leslie became a star for the team during the 2012–13 season. On December 23, 2012, the Warriors played their first home game at the Kaiser Permanente Arena after beginning their campaign with seven-straight road games. With Leslie leading the way alongside teammates Jeremy Tyler and Maurice Baker, the Warriors made it through to the D-League Finals in their first season. However, they were defeated 2–0 by the Rio Grande Valley Vipers in the best-of-three series. Highlights from the team include Golden State assignees Kent Bazemore and Scott Machado, former NBA player Hilton Armstrong, Most Improved Player recipient Cameron Jones, and Stefhon Hannah, who won Defensive Player of the Year for the second year in a row.\nSanta Cruz embraced the team during their first season in the city, as the Warriors placed first in the NBA Development League for overall revenue. The team sold $1.2 million in tickets. The average ticket revenue per game, at $52,651, was the highest in the 16-team league. But while the Warriors' ticket prices were the highest in the league – from $15 for bleachers to $140 for courtside seats – popularity was also key to the financial success. The team had the highest average number of individual tickets sold per game at 709, approximately 130 tickets more than its nearest competitor, the Maine Red Claws.\nIn 2013–14, the Warriors again finished second in the Western Conference – behind the Los Angeles D-Fenders – and despite only the sixth best record in the G-League standings, the Warriors again reached the Finals. However, they were once again outclassed in the best-of-three Finals series, this time losing 2–0 to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants. Highlights from the team include the Santa Cruz Warriors' G-League Splash Brothers, with Seth Curry and Mychel Thompson emulating their respective brothers playing for Golden State, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.\nIn 2014–15, the Warriors finished with a 35–15 record, good for the best record in the Western Conference. Guard Aaron Craft was named the NBA D League Defensive Player of the Year, leading the league with 2.5 steals per game. The Warriors made it through to the Finals for the third consecutive year and swept the Fort Wayne Mad Ants to claim their first G-League championship since 2007, with Finals MVP Elliot Williams leading the way with a game-high 23 points in Game 2.\nFollowing their 2015 championship, the Warriors failed to make the postseason in the 2015–16 season after finishing with a 19–31 record. Guard Elliot Williams set a Franchise record 48 points in a double overtime victory against the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. The Warriors returned to the postseason in 2016–17, following a 31–9 record, but ultimately fell to the Oklahoma City Blue in their first round series, 1–2.\nIn 2017–18, the Warriors finished with a 23–27 record, missing the postseason for the third time since joining the NBA Development League in the 2006–07 season.  Despite missing the playoffs, the Warriors led the league with an efficient 50.1% team field goal percentage.\nThe Warriors returned strong in the 2018–19 season, finishing first in the Pacific division and earning a trip to the postseason with a 34–16 record. The Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Blue, 117–102, in the conference semifinals before falling to the eventual champion Rio Grande Valley Vipers, 125–144, in the conference finals.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic would cancel the 2019–20 season and lead to a reduced 2020-21 schedule. All games were played in the NBA G League bubble at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida. Santa Cruz was one of 18 participating teams and finished 2nd in the league with an 11–4 record. In the postseason, the Warriors defeated the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, 110–81, before falling to the Lakeland Magic, 96–108, in the conference semifinals.\nIn the 2021–22 season, the NBA G League returned to a traditional schedule and the Warriors finished with a 15–17 record, narrowly defeating the Austin Spurs in the overtime,118-112, in the final game of the regular season to secure a postseason berth. Following the exciting season conclusion, the Warriors would fall to the South Bay Lakers, 123–134, in the conference quarterfinals.\nIn 2022–2023, the Warriors finished with an 18–14 record, missing the postseason for the first time since the 2017–18 season. On April 4, rookie guard Lester Quinones was named the NBA G League Most Improved Player. Quinones was also named to the 2022-23 NBA G League All-Rookie Team, averaging 21.8 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 4.8 assists in 31 games with Santa Cruz.\nIn the 2023 NBA G League Winter Showcase, the Warriors scored a franchise high 153 points versus the G League Ignite. The Warriors returned to the postseason in the 2023–24 season finishing with a 20–14 record. The Warriors defeated the Salt Lake City Stars, 113–11, in the first round before falling to the Stockton Kings, 109–112, in the conference semifinals. Rookie guard Kendric Davis was named to the 2023-24 NBA G League All-Rookie Team, averaging 18.7 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 8.8 assists in 34 games with Santa Cruz.\nSeason by season\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Season !!League !!Division/Conference !!Finish !!Wins !!Losses !!Pct. !!Postseason results\n|-\n|colspan=8 bgcolor=\"#FFCC33\" | Dakota Wizards\n|-\n| 1995–96 || IBA || || 5th || 7 || 17 || .292 ||\n|-\n| 1996–97 || IBA || || 2nd || 17 || 13 || .567 ||align=left| Won Semifinals (Magic City) 2–1Lost IBA Finals (Black Hills) 1–2\n|-\n| 1997–98 || IBA || West || 3rd || 14 || 20 || .412 ||\n|-\n| 1998–99 || IBA || West || 5th || 12 || 22 || .353 ||\n|-\n| 1999–2000 || IBA || West || 1st || 30 || 6 || .833 ||align=left| Won Division Semifinals (Winnipeg) 2–0Lost Division Finals (Magic City) 1–3\n|-\n| 2000–01 || IBA || West || 1st || 30 || 10 || .750 ||align=left| Won Division Semifinals (Magic City) 2–0Won Division Finals (Saskatchewan) 2–0Won IBA Finals (Des Moines) 3–2\n|-style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"\n| 2001–02 || CBA || National || 1st || 26 || 14 || .650 ||align=left| Won Semifinals (Fargo-Moorhead) 3–0Won CBA Finals (Rockford) 116–109\n|-\n| 2002–03 || CBA || National || 1st || 31 || 17 || .646 ||align=left| Lost Semifinals (Yakima) 1–3\n|-\n| 2003–04 || CBA || || 1st || 34 || 14 || .708 ||align=left| Won Semifinals (Rockford) 3–1Won CBA Finals (Idaho) 132–129\n|-\n| 2004–05 || CBA || Western || 1st || 32 || 16 || .667 ||align=left| Lost Semifinals (Sioux Falls) 1–3\n|-\n| 2005–06 || CBA || Western || 4th || 19 || 29 || .396 ||\n|-style=\"border-top:2px solid black\"\n| 2006–07 || D-League || Eastern || 1st || 33 || 17 || .660 ||align=left| Won Division Finals (Sioux Falls) 115–113Won D-League Finals (Colorado) 121–129 (OT)\n|-\n| 2007–08 || D-League || Central || 1st || 29 || 21 || .580 ||align=left| Lost First Round (Sioux Falls) 89–101\n|-\n| 2008–09 || D-League || Central || 2nd || 27 || 23 || .540 ||align=left| Won First Round (Iowa) 114–109Lost Semifinals (Utah) 93–103\n|-\n| 2009–10 || D-League || Eastern || 3rd || 29 || 21 || .580 ||align=left| Lost First Round (Austin) 1–2\n|-\n| 2010–11 || D-League || Eastern || 4th || 19 || 31 || .380 ||\n|-\n| 2011–12 || D-League || Eastern || 2nd || 29 || 21 || .580 ||align=left| Lost First Round (Bakersfield) 0–2\n|-\n|colspan=8 style=\"\"|Santa Cruz Warriors\n|-\n| 2012–13 || D-League || Western || 2nd || 32 || 18 || .640 ||align=left| Won First Round (Fort Wayne) 2–0Won Semifinals (Austin) 2–0Lost D-League Finals (Rio Grande Valley) 0–2\n|-\n| 2013–14 || D-League || Western || 6th || 29 || 21 || .580 ||align=left| Won First Round (Los Angeles) 2–0Won Semifinals (Rio Grande Valley) 2–1Lost D-League Finals (Fort Wayne) 0–2\n|-\n| 2014–15 || D-League || Western || 1st || 35 || 15 || .700 ||align=left| Won First Round (Oklahoma City) 2–0Won Semifinals (Austin) 2–1Won D-League Finals (Fort Wayne) 2–0\n|-\n| 2015–16 || D-League || Pacific || 5th || 19 || 31 || .380 ||\n|-\n| 2016–17 || D-League || Pacific || 2nd || 31 || 19 || .620 ||align=left| Lost First Round (Oklahoma City) 1–2\n|-\n| 2017–18 || G League || Pacific || 3rd || 23 || 27 ||  ||align=left|\n|-\n| 2018–19 || G League || Pacific || 1st || 34 || 16 ||  ||align=left|Won Conf.
