Lemus said that the series does not give the \"best first impression,\" and while he hated it when he first started watching, he became \"indifferent,\" comparing it to Gantz, adding that the series \"preoccupied itself with panty shots and various states of undress.\" Jones, however, praised the portrayal of the villains and hoped that a second season of the series would be produced, while acknowledging it is \"not for everyone.\"\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
