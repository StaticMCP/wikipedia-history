It was designed by British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger (1885–1934), who also designed the Royal Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner in London. It commemorates the men and women of West Kirby and Hoylake who gave their lives in World Wars I and II.\nOn two sides of the obelisk stand bronze figures symbolising war and peace. On the west face is a figure of a robed woman holding a baby, a wreath of poppies and broken manacles. On the east face stands a British infantry soldier dressed for winter and standing guard with standard issue .303 rifle, bayonet fixed, a gas mask, water bottle, putties and his helmet pushed off the back of his head, and a German helmet at his feet\n.\nInscriptions around the base read:\nThe memorial was unveiled on 16 December 1922 by the Earl of Birkenhead with 5,000 people in attendance. The Memorial is in the care of Metropolitan Borough of Wirral.\nA recasting of the soldier figure now forms part of the \"Drivers and Wipers\" Memorial at the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne, Australia.\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed buildings in Merseyside\n*Grade II* listed war memorials in England\n*Listed buildings in Hoylake\nExternal links\n*[http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Charles_Sargeant_Jagger._Sculptor_(1885-1934)#The_Hoylake_Memorial The Hoylake Memorial]  – National Archives\nReferences"
