The film was directed by Ben Stassen and Vincent Kesteloot and written by John R. Smith and Rob Sprackling. Inspired by Queen Elizabeth II and her pet corgis, the story follows a corgi named Rex, who gets lost and tries to find his way home.\nThe film was theatrically released in Belgium on 3 April 2019. It was panned by critics, and grossed $31.4 million worldwide against a budget of $20 million.\nPlot\nRex is Queen Elizabeth II's favourite corgi and lives a life of luxury with three other corgis in Buckingham Palace. On a visit by U.S. president Donald Trump with his wife Melania and their dog Mitzi, the Queen suggests one of her corgis might be a suitable mate for Mitzi, who chooses Rex, who is not pleased at the prospect. After Rex evades her multiple times, Mitzi chases him into the dining hall where he accidentally bites Trump, angering the Queen.\nRex, ashamed at embarrassing the Queen, is consoled by Charlie, another of the Queen's corgis who is jealous of Rex's position. Luring him with the false promise that the Pope is looking for dogs, Charlie disposes of Rex's collar and leads him to a stream with the intention of drowning him.\nRex is saved by a man who takes him to a dog shelter, where Rex's mannerisms at first alienate him, but he makes friends and falls in love with a young Saluki named Wanda. Initially wary, she develops feelings for him. This raises the ire of Tyson, a former fighting American Pit Bull Terrier, who also has feelings for Wanda and runs the kennel. Rex convinces the other dogs to join forces against Tyson and defeat him.\nRex returns to the palace with his new friends and Wanda, however the guards do not recognise him and throw him out of the palace as Charlie has convinced the Queen that Rex was killed by foxes. Rex sneaks into the palace where everybody tries to prevent Charlie from becoming top dog. Charlie traps Rex and Wanda in a room and sets it on fire. Wanda escapes and rallies their friends to save Rex.\nThe Queen is overjoyed to find Rex alive and well and is about to restore to him the honour of Top Dog. Rex refuses as he values his love for Wanda more than his position. Charlie, becoming Top Dog, is forced to become mates with Mitzi and move to America while Rex continues to live at the palace with his new friends.\nCast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! colspan=\"2\" | Voice actor\n|-\n!

And that's from the puppy dogs our kids are supposed to find cute.\"\nNathan Rabin wrote in a review for Fatherly, \"It's as if the screenwriters wrote a hard R, Sausage Party-style lowbrow romp and a G-rated movie about cute doggies, then combined the two scripts into something that was wildly inappropriate for families but too cute and cloying for adults. Nobody should watch this with their kids if they watch it at all.\"\nSee also\n* List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
