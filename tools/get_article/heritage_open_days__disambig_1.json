It takes place in September.\nHeritage Open Days was established in 1994 as England's contribution to European Heritage Days, in which 49 countries now participate. It is one of England's biggest voluntary cultural events, attracting some 800,000 people every year and bringing together over 2,500 organisations, 5,000 events and 40,000 volunteers.\nThe equivalent event in Wales is Open Doors, in Scotland Doors Open Days, and in Northern Ireland European Heritage Days. Open House London is also part of the initiative and takes place in September.\nImpact and Legacy\nHeritage Open Days has grown significantly since its inception. Each year, over 5,000 events are held, with participation from a wide range of heritage organizations, individuals, and communities. The festival has played a vital role in raising awareness about the importance of preserving England’s historic environment and fostering a sense of national pride.\nRelated Initiatives\nHeritage Open Days is part of the broader European Heritage Days programme, which involves over 50 countries. Other UK nations have similar initiatives, including Scotland’s Doors Open Days and Wales’s Open Doors.\nSee also\n* European Heritage Days\n* Heritage Week in Ireland\n* Visit My Mosque\n* Doors Open Days\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/ Heritage Open Days website]\n* [http://www.londonopenhouse.org/ London Open House website]"
