It is named for the Great Indian Warpath that was used by the Iroquois in war raids with the Cherokee and other tribes. Warriors Path State Park is surrounded on three sides by the Raystown Branch Juniata River. The park is a seasonal day use park. The park can be accessed by foot from the main gate when the gate is closed November through mid-April.\nThe land for the park was acquired in three main parcels between 1959 and 1964. A stone with a bronze marker remembers the gift by Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Bussard of one parcel, stating that the land will \"be maintained and used as a park forever\".  were originally purchased from the Nimchishin family in 1959. Mr. Nimchishin lived on the remaining  until his death, but sold that land to the state in 1987 and it became part of the park.\nRaystown Branch of the Juniata River\nThe Raystown Branch of the Juniata River is accessed from the park for fishing and boating. The river is home to smallmouth and rock bass, carp, sucker, eel, catfish, walleye, and muskellunge. The waters of the river are usually too shallow for motorboating during the summer months, but Raystown Branch is ideal for canoes, rafts and other small boats. All boats must have a current registration with any state. Backflow from the river has created a fresh water swamp that provides habitat for wood ducks, river otter and mallards.\nTrails\nThe trails of Warriors Path State Park are open to hiking and cross-country skiing. The trails also provide access to the woods for hunters during hunting season. All hikers and skiers are asked to wear blaze orange during the hunting seasons.\nHunting\nHunting is permitted at Warriors Path State Park.
