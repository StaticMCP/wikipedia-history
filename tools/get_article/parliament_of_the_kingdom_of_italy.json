It was established in 1861 to replace the Parliament of the Kingdom of Sardinia and lasted until 18 June 1946, when it was replaced by the present-day Italian Parliament. It was formed of a lower house (the Chamber of Deputies or after 1939 the Chamber of Fasces and Corporations) and an upper house (Senate of the Kingdom).\nFurther reading\n* Francesco Bartolotta (ed), ''Parlamenti e governi d'Italia dal 1848 al 1970'', Roma, Vito Bianco Ed., 1971.\ncategory:1946 disestablishments in Italy\ncategory:Italian Parliament\ncategory:1861 establishments in Italy\ncategory:Defunct bicameral legislatures"
