These operations were carried out by the (GTD) Picarde group in concordance with another French group and the Malian Army (FAMa). The main target was Katibat Macina, the central Malian front of Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin.\nBattle\nThe operation began on the night between January 4 and 5, after French helicopters backed by airstrikes attacked JNIM hideouts in the Serma forest. In one of the airstrikes, several JNIM fighters were killed. Days later, French commandos attacked the forest on the ground, discovering a training area and a logistics base. Several vehicles and caches of ammunition were seized.\nThe French army later stated that around twenty jihadists were rendered combat-ineffective from the battle. Of those, fifteen were killed in the battle, and five were captured.\nReferences"
