After the inconclusive negotiations with the Poles in Vilnius, army of prince Yury Dolgorukov attacked the Polish units guarding the Polish delegations near Verkiai. Polish troops were taken by surprise and were defeated, Russians took many prisoners, including the Polish leader, hetman Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski; Gosiewski would remain a hostage for four years. Another Polish commander, hetman Paweł Jan Sapieha, would be later blamed for not coming to the aid of Gosiewski due to personal friction between them.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Łukasz Ossoliński, \"Kampania na Ukrainie 1660 roku\"; doctoral thesis (University of Warsaw), 1995, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040611013227/http://www.historia.icenter.pl/pdf/Kampania_na_Ukrainie.pdf available here]\n*"
