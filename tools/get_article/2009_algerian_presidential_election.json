The result was a victory for incumbent President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was re-elected with 90% of the vote.\nBackground\nThe Council of Ministers announced on 3 November 2008 that a planned constitutional revision would remove the two-term limit on the presidency that was previously included in Article 74, thereby enabling Bouteflika to run for a third term. The People's National Assembly endorsed the removal of the term limit on 12 November 2008, with only the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) voting against its removal.\nCandidates\nThirteen candidates submitted papers to contest the election, but only six were approved to run:\n*Abdelaziz Bouteflika, incumbent president and leader of the National Liberation Front. Supported by the Democratic National Rally\n*Louisa Hanoune, candidate of the Workers' Party\n*, candidate of the Algerian National Front (FNA)\n*, independent candidate supported by his Party of Justice and Liberty (which was not recognised at the time of the election)\n*, candidate of the Movement for National Reform\n*Ali Fawzi Rebaine, candidate of Ahd 54\nAlthough some urged former President Liamine Zéroual to run, he said in a published statement on 14 January 2009 that he would not, while also suggesting that it was not in the best interests of democracy for Bouteflika to run for a third term.\nRCD President Saïd Sadi announced on 15 January 2009 that the RCD would not participate in the elections, which he described as a \"pathetic and dangerous circus\", saying that to participate \"would be tantamount to complicity in an operation of national humiliation\".\nBouteflika announced his independent candidacy for a third term at a rally in Algiers on 12 February, and officially submitted his candidacy on 23 February, shortly before the deadline.\nResults\nThe official turnout of 75% was disputed by the opposition, with some claiming it was as low as 16%.\n|party3=Algerian National Front|votes3=294411\n|cand4=|party4=Movement for National Reform|votes4=208549\n|cand5=|party5=Independent|votes5=133315\n|cand6=Ali Fawzi Rebaine|party6=Ahd 54|votes6=124559\n|invalid=925771\n|electorate=20595683\n|source=[https://vdocuments.mx/the-presidential-election-in-algeria-april-2009.html Electoral Studies]\n}}\nReferences"
