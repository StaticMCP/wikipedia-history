The statue of Douglas MacArthur was modeled by Roger Noble Burnham and the memorial was designed by Harold Field Kellogg. The monument was vandalized in the 1980s and surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\" program in 1995.\nThe monument features a decorative pool shaped as the western Pacific Ocean, memorializing the Pacific War and MacArthur's leapfrogging campaigns. The pool is currently drained.\nSee also\n* MacArthur Memorial – burial site in Norfolk, Virginia\n* MacArthur Monument (West Point)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
