Topics include the state of the oil and steel industries within the United States and the best uses of tariffs.\nThe essays that form the book have been gathered from a number of well received publications from the era, these include the New York Evening Post, the New York Journal and ''Macmillan's Magazine. The Empire of Business provides the reader with an insight into one of history’s most notable entrepreneurs. Andrew Carnegie is also often described as the most prominent philanthropist in history.\nBibliography\n*The Empire of Business, by Andrew Carnegie.
