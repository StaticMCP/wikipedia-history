It was released in some countries as Terminator II, as it had been made two years before Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).\nBackground\nDespite the film's original title and artwork presenting it as a sequel to The Terminator, it is not officially associated with that film. The plot has more in common with Aliens. Two years after Mattei's film came out, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (the official Terminator sequel) was released. Mattei's film was not released in the United States, especially under its original title due to licensing problems.\nCast\n* Cristopher Ahrens as Samuel Fuller\n* Haven Tyler as Sara\n* Geretta Giancarlo Field as Koster\n* Fausto Lombardi (as Tony Lombardo) as Lieutenant Franzini\n* Mark Steinborn as Commander Dalton Bond\n* Dominica Coulson as Samantha\n* Mark Zielinski as Stephano\n* Clive Ricke as Drake\n* Paul Norman Allen as Kowalsky\n* Cortland Reilly as Caine\n* Richard Ross as Price\n* Bruce McFarland as Parson\n* Al McFarland as Raphelson\nRelease\nUp until 2018, the film had never been released on video in the United States for legal reasons.
