The event is primarily recorded in the Hathigumpha Inscription, which describes Kharavela’s expeditions across the Indian peninsula. The battle resulted in Kharavela's victory which broke the Tamil confederacy.\nBackground\nDuring the 1st century BCE, the eastern Indian kingdom of Kalinga re-emerged as a major power under the Mahameghavahana dynasty. Its ruler, Kharavela, sought to restore the prestige and military strength that Kalinga had lost after the Mauryan conquest under Ashoka. The Hathigumpha Inscription, carved at Udayagiri near Bhubaneswar, portrays Kharavela as an ambitious monarch who undertook extensive public works and a series of military campaigns across the subcontinent.\nAt the same time, South India was dominated by the early Tamil polities—the Chera, Chola, and Pandya kingdoms—collectively described in later interpretations as a Tamil Confederacy. They were unconquered by the Mauryan empire which proves their military unity against northern threats.\nSouthern Campaign and Battle\nKharavela possessed a large and invincible army which is suggested by the Hathigumpha Inscription, His army consisted of cavalry, elephantry, infantry, chariot (Haya, Gaja, Nara, Radha) and also most likely a navy (Nava), after Kharavela's South-east India engagement The Tamil confederacy probably became Kalinga's direct neighbour.\nThese southern monarchs who maintained their independence even in the days of the imperial Mauryas perhaps became apprehensive of Kharavela’s ambitious designs and united in a common cause to towards his aggression.\nKharavela, in his 11th regnal year defeated the combined strength of these States and successfully shattered their league. The 13th Line of the Hathigumpha Inscription informs \"Kharavela obtained horses, elephants, and jewelleries after incurring heavy loss of wonderful elephants and ships\".This was most probably in connection with his war against the Tamil League The king of pandya dynasty who appears to be the head of the League, surrendered before the conqueror and was forced to bring large quantity of pearls, jewels, and precious stones to Kalinganagari as tribute.\nAftermath\nKharavela’s return to Kalinga following the campaign is depicted as a moment of heightened royal prestige. The expedition temporarily expanded Kalinga’s influence over key coastal and inland routes linking the Andhra region with Tamilakam. Historians note that this strengthened Kalinga’s position in regional trade and enhanced the kingdom’s political stature.\nAlthough the Tamil rulers soon regained autonomy, the campaign is significant as one of the earliest recorded instances of a powerful eastern Indian monarchy projecting military power deep into peninsular India. It contributed to Kharavela’s wider program of restoring the martial reputation of Kalinga after its earlier subjugation under the Mauryan Empire.\nReferences"
