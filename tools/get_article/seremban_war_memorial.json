The site chosen was in front of the State Secretariat Building known as the Government Offices, later the State Library. It was erected at the instigation of the Seremban Branch of the Ex-Services Association of Malaya, and unveiled, at a ceremony which took place on Armistice Day, 11 November 1929, by the British Resident, James Simmons.\nThe design, in the form of a cenotaph, is modelled on the Whitehall Cenotaph, London, and bears an inscription which states that the memorial commemorates those servicemen who died in the First World War, as well as the Second World War, and the Malayan Emergency.\nReferences"
