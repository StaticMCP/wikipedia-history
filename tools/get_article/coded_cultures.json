The first Coded Cultures focused on the theme 'Decoding Digital Culture' and took place over two weeks in May 2004 at the Museumsquartier in Vienna. The 2009 version of the conference and festival was a bi-national event that took part in Austria and Japan as part of the official \"Japan - Austria Friendship Year 2009\". Further implementations of the festival have discussed topics such as Open Source Hardware, Right to repair, New media art and digital art in cooperation with the apertus AXIOM project and the University of Applied Arts Vienna, the Transmediale Festival and the ISEA (International Symposium on Electronic Art).\nCoded Cultures has debated topics publicly, and many international artists, researchers and academics such as Marina Gržinić, Masaki Fujihata, Christa Sommerer, Hans Bernhard and many others have discussed the history, past and future of Coded Cultures.\nFestivals, conferences and implementations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
