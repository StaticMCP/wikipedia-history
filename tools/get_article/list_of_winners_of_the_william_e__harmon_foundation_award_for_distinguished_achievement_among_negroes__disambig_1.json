Harmon Foundation Award for Distinguished Achievement Among Negroes, commonly referred to as the \"Harmon award\" or \"Harmon Foundation award\", was a philanthropic and cultural award created in 1926 by William E. Harmon and administered by the Harmon Foundation. It was offered for distinguished achievements in eight different fields: literature, music, fine arts, business and industry, science and innovation, education, religious service, and race relations. Although awards were created in eight categories, it is best known for its recognition of African-American art of the Harlem Renaissance, and particularly of the visual arts.\nA description of the bronze medal won by A.M.E. Bishop John Fletcher Hurst in 1926 appeared in the January 8, 1927, edition of the Afro-American, published in Baltimore, Maryland:\nThe medal is of unusually beautiful design. On the obverse side is embossed a ship in full sail on the open sea with the inscription \"Harmon Foundation\" around the margin. On the reverse side are the words \"Inspiration, Achievement Religious Service. Second award, 1926, John Hurst\".\nA full list of the winners of each year was offered in contemporary New York Times articles.\n1926\n;Race relations\n* Will W.
