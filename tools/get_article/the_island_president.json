Produced by Actual Films and directed by Jon Shenk, the film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival. The film received critical acclaim and won the Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award for Documentaries.\nThe government of the Maldives has predicted it would be inundated as a result of global warming since 1988, when its forecast was \"completely cover this Indian Ocean nation of 1196 small islands with in the next 30 years\".\nProduction and release\nThe film was funded by groups including the Ford Foundation, the American Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Atlantic Philanthropies and the Sundance Institute.\nAt the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, The Island President won the Cadillac People's Choice Documentary Award.\nUS rights to The Island President were acquired by Samuel Goldwyn Films. The film opened in New York City on March 28, 2012, followed by releases in other US cities, like Los Angeles and San Francisco.\nReception\nThe Island President received positive reviews from critics.\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as \"buoyant and spirited\" despite a grim postscript, praising its \"spectacular aerial and underwater footage of the Maldives' beauty\" and stating that \"It is impossible, while watching it, to root against Mr. Nasheed or to believe that he will fail\". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club gave the film a \"B−\", praising \"the energy and conclusiveness\" of its opening sections, but writing that \"the movie stalls a bit\" during the sections of international diplomacy.\nAfter Nasheed stepped down as president in February 2012, Shenk said that he hoped his film could help convince the world that Nasheed was deposed in a coup that was orchestrated by loyalists to the former dictator, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. \"That might be the single most important thing that the movie can do. It's now clear that this new government is not democratic, that the people who run the ministries are the same people who were there under the dictator.\"\nSee also\n* Climate change in the Maldives\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*[http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/the-island-president-m100096021 The Island President] at the Movie Review Query Engine"
