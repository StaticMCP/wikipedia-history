He defended the so-called \"theory of the struggle of two cultures\", from which it followed that since Russian culture in Ukraine is associated with the progressive proletariat and the city, while Ukrainian culture - with the backward peasantry and countryside, Russian culture will sooner or later win, and the duty of the Communists is to support this \"natural process.\" Although the ideas of this figure were shared by many of his superiors in Moscow, they were considered premature, so he and a number of other prominent non-Ukrainian party officials were recalled.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.knowbysight.info/MMM/00348.asp Лебедь Дмитрий Захарович]."
