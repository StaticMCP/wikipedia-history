Founded in 1983, it was set up to 'promote use of the canal in Hackney'. In the early 1980s a Hackney Council grant to generate affordable housing enabled the dredging of the abandoned basin, and the setting up of moorings for residential boats.\nCHUGʼs key activities over the last three decades focused on educating about the canal and its environmental and historical facets, and advocating its use by working with schools and local organisations. CHUG actively improved the canal environment, and campaigned for sustainable development around the basin. CHUG works with the Laburnum Boat Club, which uses the basin as a training space. CHUG supports LBC with resources and funds for sporting activities.\nCHUG still manages and maintains the moorings. The self-managed moorings, unique in the UK, provide affordable residential moorings in central London. The redevelopment of Kingsland Basin may affect CHUG's ability to do this in the future.\nSee also\n*Canals of the United Kingdom\n*History of the British canal system\n*List of canal basins in the United Kingdom\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.chug.org.uk/ Canals in Hackney Users Group website]\n*[https://archive.today/20130421104144/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?xml=/property/2007/04/12/pcanals112.xml Telegraph newspaper, 12/04/2007 article: \"Unlocking London's best-kept secret\"]\n*[http://www.hced.co.uk/newsite/Projects/general/Kingsland_Basin.htm Basin redevelopment plans]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090109190144/http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-introduction-summary.pdf Hackney Council Draft Report on the Kingsland Basin Urban Development Framework Stage 1]\n*[http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-2-urban-context.pdf Site Information and Urban Context]\n*[http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-3-planning-context.pdf Planning Context]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090108124536/http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-4-constraints-opportunities.pdf Strengths/weaknesses]\n*[http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-5-indicative-develoment-diagram.pdf Indicative Development Diagram]\n*[http://www.hackney.gov.uk/ep-6-design-ideas-conclusion.pdf Design ideas and principles]"
