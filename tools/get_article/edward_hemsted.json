He was educated in Kent at Chatham House School. Hemsted made his debut in first-class cricket for the Gentlemen of Kent against the Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club at Canterbury in 1863. From 1866 to 1869, he played first-class cricket for Hampshire on seven occasions. In these, he scored 204 runs at an average of exactly 17, with a highest score of 39. With his right-arm roundarm fast bowling, he took 8 wickets at a bowling average of 12.25; he took one five wicket haul, with figures of 5 for 14 against Surrey. His efforts were notable for helping Hampshire to just their second victory in first-class cricket.\nHemsted died at Weymouth, Dorset on 12 March 1884.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
