He played first-class cricket for Auckland and Wellington between 1894 and 1898.\nWarren was a batsman and occasional bowler. He made his highest first-class score opening the batting for Wellington against the touring New South Wales side in December 1895, when he was the top scorer with 50 out of Wellington's total of 150.\nUntil his retirement in the 1920s, Warren was on the permanent staff of the New Zealand Defence Force as a warrant officer, serving at the North Head base in Auckland. He died in Auckland in August 1944, aged 73.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
