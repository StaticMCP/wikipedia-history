The award ceremony was broadcast live on the CBS television network in the United States. The 2006 Tony Awards did not feature a host, but instead over 60 stars presented awards at the ceremony.\nThe biggest winner of the night was the Royal National Theatre production The History Boys by British playwright Alan Bennett winning six Tonys out of seven nominations, including Best Play, Best Direction, Best Leading Actor and Best Featured Actress.\nNatasha Richardson, Phylicia Rashad and Liev Schreiber announced the nominations on May 16, 2006.\nThe Antoinette Perry Awards for Excellence in Theatre, more commonly known as the Tony Awards, recognize achievement in live American theatre and are presented by the American Theatre Wing and the League of American Theatres and Producers (now called The Broadway League) at an annual ceremony in New York City.

All of the sixty presenters and co-hosts joined the stage during the third song.

This category was intended to honor actors and actresses who were cast as replacements and joined a long-running show after its official opening, and would not have otherwise had the chance to be recognized for a potentially Tony-worthy performance.  This award may or may not have been given in any particular year. Shows were to submit replacements they deemed worthy of consideration and a twenty-four-member committee, The Tony Awards Administration Committee, were to attend the shows and evaluate the performances.\nNo award was given in 2006, because neither of the two performers nominated, Jonathan Pryce and Harvey Fierstein, received the necessary sixteen votes for a win.\nFollowing the 2006 Tony Awards, the Administration Committee voted unanimously to abandon the category.\nWinners and nominees\nSources:PlaybillNew York Times\nWinners are in bold\n{| class=wikitable width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! width=\"50%\" | Best Play\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! width=\"50%\" | Best Musical\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'The History Boys – Alan Bennett'\n** The Lieutenant of Inishmore – Martin McDonagh\n** Rabbit Hole – David Lindsay-Abaire\n** Shining City – Conor McPherson\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Jersey Boys\n** The Color Purple\n** The Drowsy Chaperone\n** The Wedding Singer\n|-\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Revival of a Play\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Revival of a Musical\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Awake and Sing!\n** The Constant Wife\n** Faith Healer\n** Seascape\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Pajama Game\n** Sweeney Todd\n** The Threepenny Opera\n|-\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Richard Griffiths – The History Boys as Hector'\n** Ralph Fiennes – Faith Healer as Francis Hardy\n** Željko Ivanek – The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial as Lt.
