For two years, before entering college, he took voice lessons and sang solos in church and on radio. He also spent a year doing various jobs in Florida. At Duke University, he graduated with A.B. in 1934, A.M. in 1936, and Ph.D. in 1939. Some of his doctoral work was done at Harvard University, where he worked under the orchidologist  Oakes Ames, who introduced him to economic botany. At Harvard, Correll was financially assisted by the Anna C. Ames Memorial Scholarship. In 1937 he married Helen Elizabeth Butts (1907–2000). She received her Ph.D. in zoology from Duke University in 1934. She worked extensively on botany with her husband and became an expert on grasses and sedges.\nHe was from 1939 to 1943 a research associate at the Harvard University Botanical Museum. In 1943 he also worked as a botanist for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on the Alaska Highway Botanical-Geological Survey, which was connected with the Alaska Highway project. From 1944 to 1946 he was a U.S. Navy gunnery officer.  From 1946 to 1947 he was a Guggenheim Fellow at Harvard University.\nFrom 1947 to 1956, Correll worked for the USDA. There he was involved with, or led, projects involving explorations for plants that might be useful to U.S. farmers or pharmaceutical companies. His book Native Orchids of North America, North of Mexico was published in 1950. Together with Oakes Ames, he published Orchids of Guatemala in two volumes in 1952 and 1953. In 1956 Correll resigned from the USDA and moved with his family to Texas.\nIn 1956 Correll became Head of the Botanical Laboratory, Texas Research Foundation, in Renner, Texas, where he continued his explorations for wild species of potato in Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Other plants also caught his attention, and on one Mexican exploration in Sonora a tiny member of the sunflower family caught his eye; it was of a new genus and subsequently named Correllia montana A.M.Powell. His primary project in Texas, however, was the preparation of a complete work of the native and introduced plants of the state, and in 1970 he saw published the Manual of the Vascular Plants of Texas. He also helped to create the Big Thicket National Park and preserve nearly 100,000 acres of pristine wilderness.\nFor the academic year 1959–1960 he was a Guggenheim Fellow.\nAmong his collaborators in Texas were Irving William Knobloch and Marshall C. Johnston. During his career, Correll was the author or co-author of 11 books and more than 115 papers.\nFrom 1971 to 1973 Correll worked as  Program Director for Systematic Biology  at the National Science Foundation. Then Correll moved to the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Miami, where he and his wife Helen B. Correll, with their assistant Priscilla Fawcett, researched the flora of the Bahamas. The work  Flora of the Bahama Archipelago, Including the Turks and Caicos Islands , which was created on the basis of this work, was published in 1982.\nCorrell was a member of The Explorers Club and numerous botanical associations. Upon his death in 1983, he was survived by his widow Helen Butts Correll, two sons, and two daughters.\nAwards and honors\nThe Native Plant Society of Texas has been giving the Donovan Stewart Correll Memorial Award annually since 1988 for scientific work in the field of flora in the US state of Texas.\nEponyms\n* Correllia A.M.Powell (Asteraceae; synonym for the genus Perityle)\n* Correlliana D'Arcy (Primulaceae)\nSelected publications\n* Brown, Claire A. & Correll, Donovan Stewart: [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001497076 Ferns and fern allies of Louisiana.] Louisiana State University Press. 1942\n* Correll, Donovan Stewart: [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011394470 Collecting wild potatoes in Mexico].
