As the army climbed the heights of Kachkalikov, a historical region in Chechnya, fighters from the Kachkalikov clan, led by Ibba-Mullah, launched a surprise attack on the disorganized Russian army. The sudden ambush decimated Russian ranks, and after further fierce fighting, the mountaineer army left and retreated into the mountains. In the battle, up to 20 Chechens were killed, including Ibba-Mullah himself.\nRussian punitive campaign\nAs a result, a second army, led by Colonel Rebinder, was mobilized and sent to Chechnya 2 days later, on January 19. The detachment was made up of a Grenadier Battalion. The detachment ravaged part of the Chechen plain and burnt down several villages, as a result of which about 80 people were killed and 4 people were captured, 800 rams and 30 heads of cattle were captured as booty, which were immediately distributed to the troops. Soon after the Russian soldiers returned to their garrisons.\nSee also\n*Battle of Tatartup\n*Anapa campaign (1787)\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
