In January 1899, Wright was elected the 31st Speaker of the Assembly, but resigned the office and his seat in the assembly after just 29 days after he was allegedly involved in a vote-buying scheme for U.S. Senate candidates, which at the time were elected by the state legislature. Wright had also forged campaign documents, the penalty for which would have been forfeiture of office; James K. Burnett, another state assemblyman, introduced an expulsion resolution for Wright prior to his resignation from the Assembly. Alden Anderson was chosen to succeed Wright following his resignation.\nPersonal life\nWright was born in Carson City, Nevada, the son of a judge, Samuel Huntington Wright. His professional career was in the oil and insurance industry. Wright died at his home in Berkeley, California on October 10, 1942 at the age of 76.\nReferences"
