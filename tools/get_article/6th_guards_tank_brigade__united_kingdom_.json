The 6th Brigade, was converted from the 30th Independent (Guards) Infantry Brigade\nIn 1942, all British armoured divisions were reorganised to have one armoured brigade and one motorised infantry brigade. The 6th Guards Armoured Brigade thus became an independent tank brigade, being renamed as the 6th Guards Tank Brigade.\nThe brigade, now equipped with the Churchill tank, served in the North West Europe campaign landing in Normandy on 20 July 1944.\nCorrespondence in Winston Churchill's The Second World War (Volume V: Closing the Ring, Annex C) in April 1944 appears to indicate that breaking the brigade up and making its personnel available as replacements for other army formations was considered. Churchill was opposed to this, and nothing appears to have been done.\nThe brigade went on to take part in the Battle of Normandy in Operation Bluecoat, Operation Veritable finally ending the war at Lübeck on the Baltic Sea where they captured a U-boat.\nOrder of battle\nThe 6th Guards Tank Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:\n* 4th Tank Battalion Coldstream Guards\n* 4th Tank Battalion Grenadier Guards\n* 3rd Tank Battalion Scots Guards\nBrigade Troops\n* 6th Guards Tank Brigade Postal Unit, Royal Engineers\nPrior to Operation Plunder and after Operations Veritable and Blackcock, the 6th Guards had units of artillery, engineer and other units added to their formation. The Brigade then became known as the 6th Guards Armoured Brigade through to V. E. Day.\nCommanders\nThe following officers commanded 6th Guards Tank Brigade during the war:\n* 15 January 1943 – 3 August 1944 Brigadier Gerald Verney\n* 3–16 August 1944 Brigadier Sir Walter Bartellot, Bt\n* 18 August 1944 – 2 February 1945 Brigadier Walter Greenacre\nSee also\n* British armoured formations of the Second World War\n* List of British brigades of the Second World War\n* Rhino tank\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSee also\n* List of British brigades of the Second World War\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
