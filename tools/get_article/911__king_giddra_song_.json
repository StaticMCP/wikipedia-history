      "text": "# 911 (King Giddra song)\n\n\"911 Song\" was released on September 11, 2002, the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States, by the Japanese hip-hop group King Giddra. King Giddra released this single as part of their album Saishuu Heiki/The Final Weapon. The song delivers potent, politically charged lyrics that challenge the United States government and their role in the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\nLyrics\nThe song uses a repetitive chanting of the phrase \"Remember that day, that day, that day\" as its chorus in memory of September 11, and the attacks that clearly resonated across the world. Both MCs in the group, K Dub Shine and Zebra, deliver verses that urge the world to question not \"what, where, who, but why\" the attacks happen. K Dub Shine ends his verse with a critique of the Bush administration, saying \"It's always civilians who are sacrificed, even so, Bush sleeps in his bed tonight.\" The lyrics as well as a music video can be found at http://web.mit.edu/condry/www/jhh/mov/KG-911-small.mov.\nReferences"
