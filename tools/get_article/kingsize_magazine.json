It was founded in Norway in 2001 by Hallgeir Knutsen and Julian Alexander Kibsgård and was the first Norwegian-language hip-hop magazine. Kingsize expanded to Sweden in 2004, with separate Norwegian and Swedish issues published bi-monthly. The Norwegian edition originally had a circulation of 5,000 copies and was published quarterly, with a target audience of boys aged 15–25. The Norwegian Kingsize ceased publication in 2009 due to declining advertising revenue.\nThe Swedish edition of Kingsize has been issued since 2004 but ceased physical publications in 2012 to focus on their website and online magazine. The magazine returned in its physical edition in 2018 after being purchased by Nöjesguiden Media, the company behind Nöjesguiden. As of 2018, Kingsize Magazine is distributed free-of-charge mainly in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, and is funded by advertisers. In August 2025, Kingsize announced it had once again ceased physical publications, with the last magazine issued in May of that year. In the 2010s, the magazine hosted the Kingsizegalan, an annual music awards ceremony celebrating Swedish hip-hop. Kingsize Magazine is the largest hip-hop magazine in the Nordic region.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.e-magin.se/latestpaper/1xk2hpmd/paper#/title/1xk2hpmd Online issues of Swedish Kingsize (since 2018)]"
