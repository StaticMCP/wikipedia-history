Such cities often bear outsized importance in the national and/or historical narrative of a country, and may be home to a number of national museums and monuments.\nThe term derives from infant cradles, referring to a revolution being gradually \"nursed\" from a young age (e.g. small uprising) until it becomes mature (e.g. full-scale revolt and/or civil war).\nExamples\n* Bastille, Paris, France - Cradle of the French Revolution (see Storming of the Bastille)\n* Boston, Massachusetts and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - Cradles of the American Revolution (see Faneuil Hall, AKA the \"Cradle of Liberty\")\n* Daraa, Syria - Cradle of the Syrian revolution\n* Petrograd, Russian Empire - Cradle of the Russian Revolution\n* Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia - Cradle of the Tunisian revolution\n* Timișoara, Romania - Cradle of the Romanian revolution\nReferences"
