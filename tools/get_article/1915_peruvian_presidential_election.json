They followed a coup in January 1914 that overthrew the government of Guillermo Billinghurst.\nJosé Pardo y Barreda of the Civilista Party was elected president with 91% of the vote. Ricardo Bentín Sánchez was elected first vice president and Melitón Carvajal second vice president.\nBackground\nA new electoral law was approved in February, which abolished the previous electoral register.\nCoup leader Óscar R. Benavides hoped to avoid a repeat of the highly partisan politics that preceded the coup and called for parties to work together. As a result, in March 1915 the Civilista Party, Constitutional Party and Liberal Party held a joint convention, with 418 members in attendance. The parties agreed to support a common presidential candidate, selecting former president José Pardo y Barreda on 28 March. On 25 April the convention selected Ricardo Bentín Sánchez and Melitón Carvajal as candidates for the vice presidencies.\nResults\nPresident\n|party2=Democratic Party|votes2=13151\n|totalvotes=144712\n|electorate=\n|source=Basadre\n}}\nFirst vice president\nSecond vice president\nReferences"
