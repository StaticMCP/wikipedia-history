The constituency elected four councillors for a three-year term in 1964, 1967 and 1970.\nHistory\nIt was planned to use the same boundaries as the Westminster Parliament constituencies for election of councillors to the Greater London Council (GLC), as had been the practice for elections to the predecessor London County Council, but those that existed in 1965 crossed the Greater London boundary. Until new constituencies could be settled, the 32 London boroughs were used as electoral areas which therefore created a constituency called Southwark.\nThe electoral division was replaced from 1973 by the single-member electoral divisions of Bermondsey, Dulwich, Peckham.\nElections\nThe Southwark constituency was used for the Greater London Council elections in 1964, 1967 and 1970. Four councillors were elected at each election using first-past-the-post voting.\n1964 election\nThe first election was held on 9 April 1964, a year before the council came into its powers. The electorate was 210,292 and four Labour Party councillors were elected. With 70,675 people voting, the turnout was 33.6%. The councillors were elected for a three-year term.\n1967 election\nThe second election was held on 13 April 1967. The electorate was 199,510 and four Labour Party councillors were elected. With 55,161 people voting, the turnout was 27.6%. The councillors were elected for a three-year term.\n1970 election\nThe third election was held on 9 April 1970. The electorate was 202,533 and four Labour Party councillors were elected. With 57,978 people voting, the turnout was 28.6%. The councillors were elected for a three-year term.\nReferences"
