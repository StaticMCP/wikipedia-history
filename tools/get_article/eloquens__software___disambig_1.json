It was the first commercial speech synthesis software able to speak Italian.\nDescription\nIt was the first commercial product of the research center CSELT in the field of voice technology. It was built with diphone-technology aimed to reach a high computational efficiency. As a result, the produced voice is still \"robotic\", but more natural than the previous generation voice implemented in MUSA by CSELT itself. In the past, ELOQUENS was applied to automatically read timetables in the Italian train stations and some telephone services provided by Telecom Italia, e.g. the automated address book service.\nIn 1997 Eloquens was also used as a building block (synthezer module) in dialogue systems.\nNowadays, it is released as freeware: it is nowadays typically used in spoken comments in many YouTube videos.\nSee also\n* Loquendo\n* vidby\n* Acapela\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://eloquens.it.softonic.com/ Eloquens on Softonic]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170227133535/http://www.datasheetarchive.com/files/texas-instruments/sc/docs/dsps/softcoop/cseltelq.htm Datasheet Archive: Eloquens 2000]"
