Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. The Republic of the Congo accepted the convention on December 10, 1987, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, the Republic of the Congo has two World Heritage Sites. One of these, Sangha Trinational, is shared with the neighbouring countries of Cameroon and the Central African Republic.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (department)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF|Sangha Trinational\n|\n| Sangha Department, Likouala Department\n|2012\n| 1380rev; ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n|Forest Massif of Odzala-Kokoua\n|\n| Cuvette-Ouest Department\n|2023\n| 692rev; ix, x (natural)\n|\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. The Republic of the Congo maintains three properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (department)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Loango ancient slavery harbour\n|\n|Kouilou Department\n| align=\"center\" |2008\n|vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Mbé Royal Domain\n|\n|Pool Department\n| align=\"center\" |2008\n| v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Conkouati-Douli National Park\n|\n|Kouilou Department\n| align=\"center\" |2008\n| ix, x (natural)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
