The defeat of the rebellion meant that the state could never be properly established.\nHistory\nOrigins\nA British colony since 1763, Canada was divided into two distinct entities in 1791: Lower Canada, mainly inhabited by the descendants of the colonists of New France, and Upper Canada, mainly inhabited by British colonists. Lower and Upper Canada were frequently in tension with each other, which made governing difficult.\nDeclaration of independence and 1838 invasions\nRobert Nelson declared himself president and read the Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada in front of thousands of people cheering him along in Napierville.\nSee also\n* Patriote movement\n* Republicanism in Canada\n* Executions at the Pied-du-Courant Prison\n* History of Quebec\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.republiquelibre.org/cousture/NELSONROB.HTM Account of the events] (Republiquelibre.org (French))"
