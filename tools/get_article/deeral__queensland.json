In the , the locality of Deeral had a population of 151 people.\nGeography\nDeeral has an unusual \"J\"-shape boundaries. The eastern part is a long section of beach facing the Coral Sea and its immediate hinterland; this land is undeveloped and controlled by the Queensland Government. The western part is a curved section of freehold land, cleared and used for farming especially sugarcane. Both of these areas are low-lying (less than 10 metres above sea level). In the very far west of the locality the land begins rising rapidly towards the adjacent Bellenden Ker Range in neighbouring Wooroonooran; this land is undeveloped.\nThe town is located in the south-western part of the locality. The Bruce Highway and the North Coast railway line traverse the locality, adjacent and parallel, from the south-west of the locality through to the north-west of the \"curve of the J\", passing through the town, which is served by the Deeral railway station () which was known as Munros Camp railway station from 1883 to 1912. Figtree Creek railway station () served the north of the locality but it is now abandoned.\nThe Mulgrave River forms the north-eastern boundary of the \"curve\", then crosses the locality to form the southern boundary of the eastern beach of the locality, entering the Mutchero Inlet and then to Coral Sea.\nHistory\nThe town was built on Yidinji tribal territory.  The town's name was derived from its railway station's name which was named Deeral in 1912, an Aboriginal word in the Yidinyji language meaning teeth.\nThe locality also contains the town of Woolanmarroo, which was on the northern side of the Mutchero Inlet. Although land had been offered for sale in Woolanmarro since at least 1885, that land was never developed and remained in its natural state. The town site is now protected land within the Malbon Thompson Range National Park (created in June 2024).\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Deeral had a population of 141 people.\nIn the , the locality of Deeral had a population of 151 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Deeral.
