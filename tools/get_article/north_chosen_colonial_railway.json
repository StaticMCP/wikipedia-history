The line was opened in two parts - the Gomusan-Hambuk Sincham section opening on 20 August 1927, and the Sinch'am-Musan segment opening on 15 November 1929. On 1 February 1937, Musan Cheolsan Station was opened.\nOriginally built as a narrow-gauge line, the conversion to standard gauge was completed on 1 May 1940, and the extension to Musan Gangan station was completed then as well. On 1 April 1944, the line was absorbed into Sentetsu; at the same time, the line was given its current name, Musan Line, and the extension to Musan Gangan station was closed.\nAfter the partition of Korea the line was within the territory of the DPRK, and was nationalised by the Provisional People's Committee for North Korea along with all other railways in the Soviet zone of occupation on 10 August 1946; the line retained the name given it by Sentetsu, Musan Line.\nServices\nIn the last timetable issued prior to the start of the Pacific War in November 1942, the North Chōsen Colonial Railway was operating four daily round trip passenger trains between Gomusan and Musan, timed to connect with local and express services on Sentetsu's Hamgyeong Line.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+  Gomusan - Musan\n|-\n!

After it was converted to standard gauge, the primary power on the line was twenty-two heavy 2-8-2 steam locomotives identical to the South Manchuria Railway's Mikai class engines. Built by Kisha Seizō of Japan, they were numbered 1 through 22.\nAfter the North Chosen Colonial Railway was nationalised, these locomotives were taken over by Sentetsu, but their subsequent numbering is unknown.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!
