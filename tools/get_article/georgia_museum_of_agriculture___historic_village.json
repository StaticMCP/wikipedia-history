It opened on July 4, 1976. The grounds consist of five areas: a traditional farm community of the 1870s, an 1890s progressive farmstead, an industrial sites complex, rural town, national peanut complex, and the Museum of Agriculture Center.\nOver 35 structures have been relocated to the  site and faithfully restored or preserved including the Vulcan Steam Train running on  narrow gauge track.  Costumed interpreters explain and demonstrate the lifestyle and activities of this time in Georgia's history. It is located at 1392 Whiddon Mill Road off I-75 at Exit 63B.\nThe museum is a facility of Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College.\nNotable facilities\nLike many living museums, this one includes residences, a grist mill, saw mill and stores. More notable demonstrations include a turpentine still and a cotton gin.\nThe cotton gin is a reconstruction designed to demonstrate ginning technologies of the period 1890–1900. During this period, mid-nineteenth century gins were being replaced by the system gin invented by Robert S. Munger. This gin demonstrates all the system ginning technologies, but does not operate as efficiently as a system gin because it only contains one gin stand. Its equipment was made by Lummus of Columbus, Georgia. In 1999, Lummus moved to Savannah, Georgia, where it continues to make cotton gins. The museum operates the gin for the public annually.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://gma.abac.edu/ Georgia Museum of Agriculture & Historic Village] - official site"
