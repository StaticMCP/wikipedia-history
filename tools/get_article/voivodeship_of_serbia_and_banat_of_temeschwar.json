It was created by reorganization of administrative structures in regions of Serbian Vojvodina and Banat of Temeschwar. Its former area is now divided between Serbia, Romania and Hungary. In 1860-1861, it was reincorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary. The Voivodeship gave its name to the present Serbian Vojvodina.\nNames\nIn contemporary German, the crown land was officially known as  ('Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat';  when definite). The forms  ('the Serbian Voivodeship and the Temes Banat') and  ('the Serbian Voivodeship with the Temes Banat'; the -e on  is a now mostly obsolete dative ending) also appeared frequently in official documents. Other variations also appear as a result of grammatical inflection (see German grammar), such as  (genitive case), but these should not be considered distinct. The spellings  and  are typographic variations;  was used officially until 1852,  from 1853.\nIn contemporary Serbian it was known as  () and  (). In Hungarian it was known as , and in Romanian as .\nAs in German, in Serbian sources there are two somewhat different variants of the name of the voivodeship; one could be translated into English as Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat and another as Serbian Voivodeship and Temes Banat.\nAlso in modern English use, the term Temes Banat or Banat of Temes is sometimes incorrectly replaced with term Banat of Temeschwar or Temeschwar Banat. In the original name in all native languages, there is no mention of the city of Temeschwar (Timișoara) in the title of Voivodeship. As shown above, the reference to the Temes region is always used, and should be translated into English as Temes Banat or Banat of Temes.\nHistory\nCreation of the self-proclaimed autonomous province of Serbian Vojvodina in 1848 was followed by the Imperial Patent of 4th March (1849), known as the March Constitution, that imposed constitutional reorganization of the Austrian Empire, and provided (in article 72) a formal base for the creation of an official administrative unit under the name: Voivodeship of Serbia (), also allowing the possibility for future association of that province with other crown lands.\nThe Voivodeship was officially formed by a decision of the Austrian emperor in November 1849, after the Revolutions of 1848/1849. It was formed in accordance with privilege given to Serbs by the Habsburg emperor in 1691, recognizing the right of Serbs to territorial autonomy within the Habsburg monarchy.\nIt consisted of the regions of Banat, Bačka and northern Syrmian municipalities of Ilok and Ruma. An Austrian governor seated in Temeschwar ruled the area, and the title of Voivode belonged to the emperor himself. The full title of the emperor was \"Grand Voivod of the Voivodeship of Serbia\" (). Even after the Voivodeship was abolished, the emperor kept this title until the end of Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1918.\nMap from 1853\nIn 1860, the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat was abolished and most of its territory (Banat and Bačka) was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, although direct Hungarian rule began only in 1867, after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise. Unlike Banat and Bačka, in 1860 Syrmia was incorporated into the Kingdom of Slavonia, another separate Habsburg crown land. The Kingdom of Slavonia subsequently merged with the Kingdom of Croatia, forming the new kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, which concluded an agreement with the Kingdom of Hungary in 1868, becoming an autonomous region of the Kingdom of Hungary within Austria-Hungary.\nLanguages\nThe two official languages of the Voivodeship were German and \"Illyrian\" (what would come to be known as Serbian).\nDemographics\nThe Voivodeship was ethnically very mixed, since the southern parts of Syrmia, Banat and Bačka with compact Serbian settlements were not included in it, while eastern Banat, with a Romanian majority was added to it.\neparchy in Timișoara, capital of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]\n1846\nAccording to the 1846 census, the territory that in 1849 formed the voivodeship included:\n* Vlachs (Romanians) = 417,000\n* Serbs = 402,000\n* Germans = 352,000\n* Hungarians = 233,000\n* Slovaks = 27,000\n* Bulgarians = 24,000\n* Jews = 16,000\n* Romani = 12,000\n* Rusyns = 7,000\n* Croats = 3,000\n* Greeks = 3,000\n1857\nIn 1857, population of the voivodeship numbered 1,526,105 inhabitants, including:\n* Latin Catholics = 698,189 (45.75%)\n* Eastern Orthodox Christians = 691,828 (45.33%)\n* Evangelic-Lutherans = 56,871 (3.73%)\n* Evangelic-Reformists = 29,281 (1.92%)\n* Greek Catholics and Armenian Catholics = 26,244 (1.72%)\n* Jews = 23,203 (1.52%)\n* others = 489 (0.03%)\n1850/51\nAccording to the 1850/51 census, ethnic composition of the voivodeship was as follows:\n*Romanians = 347,459\n*Germans = 335,080\n*Serbs = 321,110 (*)\n*Hungarians = 221,845\n*Bunjevci and Šokci = 62,936 (*)\n*Rusins = 39,914\n*Slovaks = 25,607\n*Bulgarians = 22,780\n*Jews = 15,507\n*Gypsies = 11,440\n*Czechs = 7,530\n*Croats = 2,860 (*)\n*Greeks and Cincars = 2,820\n(*) Total number of \"Illyrian Slavs\" (Serbs, Bunjevci, Šokci, and Croats) was 386,906.\nAccording to another source, in 1850/1851, the population of the voivodeship numbered 1,426,221 inhabitants, including:\n* 397,459 (27.87%) Romanians\n* 335,080 (23.49%) Germans\n* 321,110 (22.52%) Serbs\n* 221,845 (15.56%) Hungarians\n* others.\nBy religious makeup:\nIn 1851, population of the voivodeship numbered 1,426,221 inhabitants, including:\n* Eastern Orthodox Christians = 694,029 (48.66%)\n* Roman Catholics = 624,839 (43.81%)\n* Evangelic-Lutherans = 51,724 (3.63%)\n* Evangelic-Reformists = 26,621 (1.87%)\n* Jews = 16,252 (1.14%)\n* Greek Catholics and Armenian Catholics = 12,756 (0.89%)\n1860\nIn 1860, population of the voivodeship numbered 1,525,523 inhabitants, including:\n*432,523 Serbs\n*414,490 Romanians\n*396,156 Germans\n*256,164 Hungarians\nAdministrative divisions\nAt first, the crown land was divided into two districts:\n#Batschka-Torontal (Bačka-Torontal)\n#Temeschwar-Karasch (Timișoara-Caraș)\nLater, it was divided into five districts (contemporary , modern spelling ), which were largely based on the pre-1849 Hungarian counties which made the majority of the crown land. From 1851 they were subdivided into political districts (). In the reforms of 1853, implemented in the crown land in 1854, the  became , which were subdivided into  (formally  but of a different type than in 1851).
