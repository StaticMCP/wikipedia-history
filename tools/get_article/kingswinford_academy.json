There is about 100 staff operating in the school and 1000 students. There are roughly 180 students per year group.\nHistory\nThe school was built just before World War II by the Brierley Hill Urban District Council. Subsequent local authority mergers meant that the school was later controlled by the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, and then became a Foundation School and specialist Science College.\nThe Kingswinford School converted to an Academy status on 1 January 2012 and became independent of local authority control. However, the school continues to coordinate Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council for admissions. As of September 2016, the Kingswinford School joined the Windsor Academy Trust (WAT), run by Windsor High School to become part of a Multi Academy Trust (MAT). The school frequently receives financial grants from the government to help its funds and upkeeping. In easter term of 2019 the name changed from The Kingswinford School to Kingswinford Academy.\nHouse system\nThere are roughly 220 students per house. The current houses and their leaders as of September 2022 are:\n* Krypton – Miss Amber Wall\n* Neon - Mrs Jess Airey\n* Argon – Mr Robert Hanson\n* Helium - Mr David Cotterell\nFacilities\nMajor refurbishments and repairs have taken place since 2012 with the introduction of an observatory  in 2012. In 2014, three new modern classroom facilities purposed for the English curriculum were built. In 2015 many windows, doors and classrooms were refurbished and helped modernise the school.\nIn May 2016, the schools canteen was demolished after being in service since 1939, to be replaced by a newer more modern refectory. The financial cost of the project, summing up to £1.5 million, was provided by The Department for Education as part of the government's Academy Programme. The refectory was planned to be finished in March 2016 but due to various administrative issues, the final completion date was reached in late March 2017 and officially opened on 19 June 2017, named \"The Hedley Refectory\" after former headteacher, Bronwyn Hedley. The canteen is staffed by a group of chefs and serves various meals and snacks from mellors catering company until the end of the summer term of 2022. In September 2022 the catering provider for Kingswinford Academy is Chartwells . In September 2018 the school opened the King's pod selling snackish food to students across the school.\nNotable former pupils\n*Blessing Chitapa, singer\n*Nicola Richards, politician\n*Ebony Salmon, women's footballer\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
