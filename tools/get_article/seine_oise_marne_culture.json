In the chalk valley of the River Marne, rock-cut tombs (hypogea) were dug to a similar design. Some have examples of megalithic art with images of axes, breasts, and necklaces carved on their walls.\nDiagnostic artefacts include transverse arrowheads, antler sleeves and crude, flat-based cylindrical and bucket-shaped pottery decorated with appliqué cordons. The SOM culture had trade links with neighbouring cultures enabling the use of Callaïs and Grand Pressingy flint imported from Brittany and the Loire and later, the use of copper.\nThe culture seems to have had strong links with other areas and may have arisen from a composite of influences as indicated by the gallery grave design common across Europe and the pottery types which have comparators in Western France from 2600BC and also in Brittany, Switzerland and Denmark.\nGenetic profile\nTen individuals dated between 3400 and 2900 BC were tested from two collective burial hipogea of the Mont-Aimé site (Val-des-Marais, Marne department); six out of seven males were assigned to the Y-chromosome haplogroup I2a1b1b1 (Y13335), and there was an individual belonging to haplogroup H2a1a. The autosomal components were a mix of European farmer and Western hunter-gatherer (this one ranging from a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 55%). Two males buried in the Pierre Fritte dolmen (Yermenonville, Eure et Loire department) had the same mitochondrial haplogropup K and Y-DNA haplogroup I2a1.\nGallery\nFile:Pierre Brunehaut 01.JPG|The Pierre Brunehaut, Belgium\nFile:Foret de Carnelle - La Pierre Turquaise 01.jpg|The Pierre Turquaise megalithic grave, France\nFile:La pierre Turquaise.jpg|The Pierre Turquaise\nFile:Hypogée de l'homme mort 1506086.jpg\nFile:Ax, Betekom, Neolithic, Seine-Oise-Marne civilization, c. 3400-2200 BC, polished stone in deer antler handle - Cinquantenaire Museum - Brussels, Belgium - DSC08702.jpg\nFile:Néolithique final hypogée 0339.JPG\nFile:2018-04-29-Dolmen Oppagne-8545-Version 2.jpg\nFile:Dolmen van Oppagne 3.JPG\nFile:Dolmen van Wéris.JPG\nFile:Wéris Dol1a JPG.jpg\nFile:Menhirs de la Longue Pierre, seen from the north, Wéris, Durbuy, 2023.jpg\nFile:Maquette-dolmen-weris.jpg\nSee also\n* Prehistoric France\n* Chasséen culture\n* Horgen culture\nNotes"
