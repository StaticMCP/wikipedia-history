The lines serves a number of small towns in the Fassifern Valley. The first stage of the Mount Edwards line opened from Munbilla to Engelsburg (now Kalbar) on 17 April 1916, but the next stage to Mount Edwards was not completed until 7 October 1922. The line closed on 1 November 1960.\nGeography\nThe 25&nbsp;km long line branched off the Dugandan line at the rural locality of Munbilla 38&nbsp;km south of the city of Ipswich. The line then proceeded in a generally south-westerly direction to the locality of Mount Edwards near the village of Aratula.\nHistory\nThe line was intended to form part of a via recta (Latin, \"straight route\") between Brisbane and Sydney via the break-of-gauge border town of Wallangarra. Before the completion of the New South Wales North Coast Line in 1930, rail traffic between the two state capitals travelled west from Brisbane to Toowoomba then south to Wallangarra via Warwick. The via recta was to incorporate the Mount Edwards line and the Maryvale line on the other side of the Great Dividing Range to produce a direct route southwest from Brisbane to Warwick, shaving around 95&nbsp;km off the interstate journey. However, the via recta was never completed.\nRoute\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stations on the Mount Edwards railway line\n!Distance from Ipswich\n!Name\n!Coordinates\n!Altitude\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Junction with Dugundan line\n|\n|\n|Immediately south-west of Munbilla railway station.\n|-\n|\n|Warperta\n|\n|\n|On Munbillla Road (now in Kents Lagoon).\n|-\n|\n|Kalbar\n|\n|\n|At the western end of Railway Street in Kalbar.\n|-\n|\n|Warumkarie\n|\n|\n|On Warumkarie Road (now in the south of Kalbar).\n|-\n|\n|Fassifern Valley\n|\n|\n|On Lake Moogerah Road.\n|-\n|\n|Morwincha\n|\n|\n|On the bend in Morwincha Road.\n|-\n|\n|Aratula\n|\n|\n|At the eastern end of Sawmill Road.\n|-\n|\n|Mount Edwards\n|\n|\n|Terminus, on the southern corner of the Cunningham Highway and Lake Moogerah Road\n|}\nSee also\n*Rail transport in Queensland\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.qhatlas.com.au/map/extent-queensland-railway-network-1925/ 1925 map of the Queensland railway system]\n* [http://maryvaleqld.com.au/Via-Recta.php/ Via Recta – The Railway That Never Was]"
