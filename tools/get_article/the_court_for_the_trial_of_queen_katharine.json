      "text": "# The Court for the Trial of Queen Katharine\n\nThe Court for the Trial of Queen Katharine is an 1817 oil painting by the British artist George Henry Harlow. It combines history painting and portraiture. It depicts the trial scene from William Shakespeare's play Henry VIII with members of the Kemble family playing various roles. Sarah Siddons was well known for playing Catherine of Aragon and this became one of the best-known images of her as it was widely circulated in prints. in addition the painting features her brothers John Philip Kemble as Cardinal Wolsey, Stephen Kemble as Henry VIII, Charles Kemble as Thomas Cromwell and her niece Fanny Kemble as a page. It was produced five years after Siddons had formally retired from the stage. on the strength of its success Harlow was able to double the prices he charged for portraits.\nIt was displayed at the Royal Academy's 1817 Summer Exhibition at Somerset House, where it was one of the most discussed works. The painting is located at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Bennett, Shelley,  Leonard, Mark & West, Shearer.
