Stewart, who reportedly clashed with the coaching staff several times, was suspended from the team after the following season. He later transferred to Division II Cal State Bakersfield, where he went on to become Division II Player of the Year and California Collegiate Athletic Association Player of the Year as a senior, leading the team to the NCAA Division II national championship.

He played for the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) from 1998 to 2000. He was selected to the All-CBA First Team in 2000.\nStewart started his overseas career in Israel with Hapoel Jerusalem in the 2000–01 season. Then, he played for Avtodor Saratov and UNICS in Russia (2001–2003). He also played few games for Prokom Trefl Sopot (Poland) and Adecco Estudiantes (Spain), before signed for NIS Vojvodina (Serbia and Montenegro) in late 2003. After two seasons there, he moved to Italy and played for Vertical Vision Cantù in the 2005–06 season. In the 2006–07 season, he played for Seoul SK Knights (South Korea) and Crvena zvezda (Serbia).
