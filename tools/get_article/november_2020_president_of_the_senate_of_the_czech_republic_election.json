Miloš Vystrčil was then elected to serve the rest of Kubera's term.\nVystrčil stated that he wants to run for another term after 2020 Senate election. Traditionally Senate group with highest number of senators holds the position but Civic Democratic Party group and Mayors and Independents group were tied in the position prior the Senate election. Mayors and Independents admitted that Vystrčil might remain President of the Senate even if their group has more members that Civic Democratic Party group.\n2020 Czech Senate election resulted in Mayors and Independents group becoming the largest Senate faction. Leader of the group Petr Holeček stated that it will discuss whether to nominate its candidate for the President of the Senate and admitted possibility of compromise that would allow Vystrčil to continue as the Senate President.
