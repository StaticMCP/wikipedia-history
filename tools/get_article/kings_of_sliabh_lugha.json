Its rulers were the Ó Gadhra, whose ancestors were Kings of Luighne Connacht, an over-kingdom of which Gailenga/Sliabh Lugha was the southern part. The northern area, lying in southwest County Sligo, retained the name Luighne.\nAfter the Anglo-Norman conquest of Connacht, the Gailenga portion was known as the barony of Gallen, and ruled by the Clan Mac Siúrtáin until the early 17th century, while the Sliabh Lugha portion was ruled by a Norman Costello family.\nList of kings\n* 1181 - Donn Sléibhe Ua Gadhra, king of Sleibe Lughu, died.\n* 1206 - Ruairí Ó Gadhra, Lord of Sliabh Lugha, died.\n* 1217 - Domhnall Ó Gadhra, died.\n* 1227 - Donn Sléibhe Ó Gadhra, ''was slain by Gillaroe, his own brother's son.\n* 1256 - Ruaidrí Ó Gadhra, was slain by David, son of Richard Cuisin\nFurther reading\n* Irish Kings and High Kings'', pp.&nbsp;68–9, 88, 101n., 132–3, 231, 233, 249, 291, Francis John Byrne, 3rd edition, 2001.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080515143036/http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlkik/ihm/connacht.htm#tri Dynasties & Territories - Connacht - Corca Fhir Trí] (archived 2008)\n* [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005A/ Annals of the Four Masters - via UCC Corpus of Electronic Texts]"
