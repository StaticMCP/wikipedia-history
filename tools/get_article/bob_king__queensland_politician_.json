He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly.\nEarly life\nBob King was born in Ayr, the son of John Leslie King, a radio dealer, and Thelma Annie. He attended Mackay state school and became a school teacher, then a primary producer with International Finance and Automotive Management.\nPolitics\nFrom 1985 he was deputy chairman of Maroochy Shire Council.\nOriginally a member of the National Party, he joined the Liberal Party and at the 1989 election was narrowly elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly as the member for Nicklin. Following a challenge by the defeated National candidate, Neil Turner, a recount was held, which Turner won; King thus ceased to be a member on 22 November 1990. He unsuccessfully contested the seat again in the 1992 election.\nReferences"
