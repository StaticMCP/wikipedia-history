Initial production was in the form of a kit for amateur construction, but later many were professionally built.\nThe Viking 28 design was also built in England by Anesty Yachts as the Trapper 28/400, with 70 completed.\nDesign\nflying.]]\nonly]]\nThe Viking 28 was the first boat designed by Cuthbertson & Cassian to be produced by Ontario Yachts.\nThe Viking 28 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim.

It is fitted with a Vire Engines two-stroke gasoline inboard engine of  or a well-mounted outboard motor.\nMany modifications were incorporated in 1974, including a wider companionway, with a pop-up hatch, plus a modified mast step and V-berth to make the hull stronger.\nThe boat has a PHRF racing average handicap of 186 with a high of 189 and low of 183. It has a hull speed of .\nOperational history\nIn a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \"The Viking 28 is a fast, relatively light weight boat that was designed by C&C and built by Ontario Yachts. Its cabin does not have standing headroom, which is something of an oddity for a modern production 28 footer. On the other hand, this meant there was no need to incorporate a high freeboard, or otherwise compromise the lines of this design, in order to accommodate for standing headroom in this boat. As a well known British designer (Uffa Fox) once said, \"If you want to stand up, go on deck\".\"\nSee also\n*List of sailing boat types\nSimilar sailboats\n*Alerion Express 28\n*Aloha 28\n*Beneteau First 285\n*Beneteau Oceanis 281\n*Bristol Channel Cutter\n*Cal 28\n*Catalina 28\n*Cumulus 28\n*Grampian 28\n*Hunter 28\n*Hunter 28.5\n*Hunter 280\n*J/28\n*O'Day 28\n*Pearson 28\n*Sabre 28\n*Sea Sprite 27\n*Sirius 28\n*Tanzer 8.5\n*Tanzer 28\n*TES 28 Magnam\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
