In the , Causeway Lake had a population of 121 people.\nGeography\nThe locality takes its name from the lake of the same name which lies within the locality, both of which take their name from the  causeway (and smallbridge) which allows the Scenic Highway to cross the lake's narrow entrance to the Coral Sea.\nThere is very little development within the locality except for a small residential area on the north-eastern shore of the lake where there is also public parkland access to the lake for recreation. Apart from that, most of the locality is undeveloped being taken up with the lakes and the associated palustrine wetland surrounding the numerous creeks which flow into the lake.\nThe northern mouth of the lake is part of the Capricorn Coast National Park. The southern part of the locality is within the Causeway Lake Conservation Park.\nHistory\nThe Scenic Highway crossing over Causeway Lake was constructed in 1939, allowing motorists to travel between Yeppoon and Emu Park.\nAfter a near-drowning of an 8-year-old girl at Causeway Lake in June 1951, Livingstone Shire Council erected warning signs the following month advising of the potential dangers associated with the lake.\nA 15-year-old boy drowned in the lake in January 1952 after his clothes became entangled in the propeller shaft of the outboard motor aboard his boat.\nA five-year-old boy drowned in the lake in February 1954. After noticing him disappear, a 15-year-old girl retrieved him from the water prior to an honorary ambulance officer attempting resuscitation without success.\nDespite it having been a much-discussed topic in the local community, the issue of potentially dredging Causeway Lake remains an ongoing concern for local residents, recreational users of the lake and environmental agencies.\nA local fish and chip shop which fronts the lake, the Causeway Lake Kiosk, received some publicity in 2017 following a visit by One Nation leader Pauline Hanson who worked in the shop for a day, in an attempt to bring attention to the issue of high electricity prices. Hanson denied it was a ploy to win votes prior to the state election.\nA house fire which occurred in August 2018 caused structural damage to the neighbouring Causeway Lake Kiosk. However, the business re-opened the following day and began accepting donations for the family whose home was destroyed by the fire.\nDemographics\nIn the , Causeway Lake had a population of 121 people.\nIn the , Causeway Lake had a population of 121 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Causeway Lake.
