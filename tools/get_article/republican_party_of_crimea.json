Its goal was to revive the republican status of the region and its sovereignty.\nIt has been alleged that the movement was financed by the local company \"Impeks-55\" and supported by a criminal gang \"Bashmaki\" (after its leader Bashmakov). With the help of the Black Sea Fleet administration, in February 1992 the movement initiated gathering of signatures for a referendum for Crimea in the new Soviet Union.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://rusk.ru/st.php?idar=50489 Russians of Crimea will always be with Russia]\n*[http://www.ruscrimea.ru/cms/?go=mon&in=view&id=18 Stages of creation the Russian community of Crimea] .
