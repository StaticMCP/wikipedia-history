It is authorized by and accountable to Ball State University.\nHistory\nThe 21st Century Charter School of Gary was established in 2005, originally serving grades 7–9. The initial curriculum description said, \"Spanish language classes for all students will be offered, and character development will be taught.\"\nIn 2012, all 19 seniors graduated and were college-bound.\nThe original school building had a capacity of 400 students, but by 2013 it had become overcrowded with more than 650 students.
