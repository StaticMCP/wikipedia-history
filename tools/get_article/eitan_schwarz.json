The book is meant to help caregivers shape how their children consume and use digital technology. He released the book on paperback and as an E-book.\n;Book overview\nIn the book Schwarz claims that younger children are increasingly in charge of how they use media, but that they mainly consume \"junk.\" He also says that excessive consumption can cause and exacerbate emotional difficulties. He argues that parents should manage children's media consumption just like they do nutrition; not with complete restriction, but educated consumption. Digital media, he claims, does not have to be a threat to watchful parents, but that parents should still avoid \"texting while parenting\", as it could negatively affect children who can benefit from focused adult interaction and face-to-face contact.\nAcademic specialties\nHis specialty is Adolescent and Pediatric Psychiatry.

While at Northwestern University, Schwarz has recently researched the use of digital media in play therapy with children.\nCertifications\nIn 1975, he was Board Certified in general, child, and adolescent psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology In 1990, he was elected to Fellow membership at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (FAACAP).
