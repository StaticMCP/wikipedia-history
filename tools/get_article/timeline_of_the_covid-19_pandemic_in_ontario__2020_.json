The patient, a male in his 50s who travelled between Wuhan and Guangzhou before returning to Toronto on January 22, contacted emergency services following rapid onset symptoms. The presumption of infection in the patient was made after a rapid test was done at Public Health Ontario's Toronto laboratory, and was announced on January 25. Final testing conducted at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba confirmed the presumptive case on January 27. Authorities said that the patient was experiencing respiratory problems but was in stable condition. His condition later improved and he was released from hospital on January 31.\nOn January 27, the Chief Medical Officer of Health of Ontario announced the man's wife as the second presumptive case. Officials reported that she was in good condition and that she was asymptomatic.\nOn January 31, the third case in Ontario (and the fourth case in Canada) was reported in the city of London. Officials said that the individual, a woman in her twenties and a student at University of Western Ontario, returned from Wuhan on January 23. She was asymptomatic and had tested negative at first, but additional advanced testing confirmed that the woman had low levels of the virus in her system. Officials said that the individual wore a mask during her voyage and she voluntarily entered self-isolation upon her return, making a full recovery after two or three days. On the same day, the Government of Ontario reported that 17 cases were under investigation within its provincial jurisdiction. Officials said that most of the individuals under investigation were awaiting results while in self-isolation at home. As of January 30, the associate medical officer of Ontario said that the province had conducted a total of 67 tests with 38 negative results. Officials said that all possible cases—including previous negative results—were being retested as additional assessments become available.\nFebruary\nCFB Trenton in Trenton, Ontario was used as a quarantine facility for repatriated Canadians since February 7. By March 24, 13 positive cases for the virus of the repatriated citizens at CFB Trenton were reported.\nOn February 23, one more presumptive case was confirmed in Ontario. The samples were sent to the National Microbiology Lab for further testing.\nOn February 24, a fourth presumptive case in Ontario was announced of a woman in her 20s who presented to a hospital on February 21 with symptoms after travelling to Wuhan. The woman was tested locally with a positive test result and the sample was sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. On February 24, health officials in Ontario stated that all three previous cases in Ontario were \"resolved\", which means patients had two consecutive negative test results 24 hours apart and that the \"system was working\".\nOn February 26, a Toronto woman with a history of traveling to Iran tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in Canada to 12.\nOn February 27, Canada confirmed the first human-to-human transmission in Toronto, the husband of the woman who had travelled to Iran, bringing the total cases in the country to 13.\nOn February 28, two positive cases were reported in Ontario, bringing the total number of cases in Canada to 16. One of them had traveled to Iran while the other had visited Egypt.\nOn February 29, Ontario confirmed one case in York Region and two cases in Durham Region, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 11.\nMarch\non the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto discouraging non-essential travel in March 2020.]]\non March 27, 2020]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=3 | Hospitalizations\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

Between 3,000 and 15,000 deaths related to COVID-19 were predicted with the current public health measures over the course of the pandemic, compared to a total projected 100,000 deaths if no action were taken, and if further measures are taken, models showed projections as low as 12,500 additional cases and 200 additional deaths by the end of April. The models projected that by April 30 there would be 80,000 cases and 1600 deaths under the current interventions. In addition, the government projected a peak use of ICU beds of 1200 beds by April 18 under their best-case scenario (with over 3000 ICU beds required under the worst-case scenario by April 30).\nOn April 9, Ontario reported its first death of a healthcare worker, a man in his fifties in Brampton.\nOn April 14 during an emergency session, the Legislative Assembly voted to extend the provincial state of emergency through May 12.\nIn late April, the Canadian Armed Forces was deployed to five nursing homes in the Greater Toronto Area. (In Quebec, the CAF were deployed to 25 facilities.)\nMay\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=3 | Hospitalizations\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

The first was declared on April 18 while three others were declared on April 30. On May 10, another outbreak was declared on another floor at the hospital. While the term outbreak differs in definition by hospital, Toronto Western Hospital defines it as the confirmation of one positive patient per unit. On May 13, the hospital's emergency department declared an outbreak after five of its staff tested positive.\nOn May 5, it came to light that the mayor of Huron-Kinloss township by Lake Huron in March 2020 ordered water service to seasonal properties shut off. Carling Township ordered its boat launch facility to remain closed, thus preventing access to anyone who needs it, including seasonal residents. Cottage-country mayors pleaded with the government of Ontario to legislate or somehow else to accept responsibility for their fate. In a memo circulated to his subordinate medical officers of health, Dr. David Williams was frightened by the advice of CMOH Nesathurai and said that\nPremier Doug Ford weighed in and said that he would not take responsibility:\nCanadian Armed Forces Brigadier General C. J. J. Mialkowski filed a report on conditions in the five Toronto-area nursing homes, in which they were assisting, on May 14. It did not reach the Defence Minister until a week later, after which there was a delay in notifying the Province of Ontario. The document alleges extreme conditions and abuse.\nWith the weather getting warmer, on Saturday, May 23, 2020, estimates of 10,000 mostly young people grouped into Trinity Bellwoods Park in Toronto's west end. Public outrage ensued as well as condemnation from Premier Ford and Toronto's medical officer of health Eileen de Villa. After making a tour of the city's parks, speaking with citizens, Mayor John Tory was also seen at the park and was criticized for lack of social distancing and improperly wearing a mask. He publicly apologized for his actions to the following day. No social distancing fines were placed, however, there were several issued for public urination. Police presence was increased the following day to prevent any subsequent large gatherings. The following week, 'social distancing circles' were painted on the lawn in the park modelled after similar tactics used in San Francisco and New York City.\nOn May 30, the Ontario government announced a \"COVID-19 recovery rate\" for electricity effective June 1 to October 31.

It was also the heavily debated first day of public school for many parts of the province, with at least COVID-19 cases reported in Ottawa-area Catholic schools and teachers in a Mississauga Catholic school refusing work until proper personal protective equipment was provided.\nOn September 10, Premier Ford criticized the federal government for not actively enforcing the Quarantine Act. Continuing an upward trend of new infections, on September 11, Ontario had its highest daily rate of new infections since June 29.\nOn September 11, the Ontario government released a website to track COVID-19 cases in public schools.\nOn September 13, the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA) stated that the province was \"losing ground\" due to the recent surge in cases, mainly centred on Toronto, Peel Region and Ottawa. Ontario reached over 300 new daily cases on September 14, the highest daily increase since June 5. On September 17, the province announced new restrictions on the size of private and \"unmonitored\" gatherings in the three regions.\nOn September 18, the province had over 400 new cases, the highest number since June 2.\nOn September 22, the province saw an increase of 478 cases, the highest daily increase since May 2. The Ford government announced they had ordered 5.1 million flu shots, encouraging the Ontario public to be vaccinated this year to avoid further burdening the hospital system. In an effort to reduce the burden on provincial assessment centres, the province began to expand testing at local pharmacies (beginning primarily within current hotspots) and encourage asymptomatic patients to obtain appointments at them instead of assessment centres. On September 25, new province-wide restrictions were introduced on operating hours for bars and restaurants, restricting the sale of alcohol to an 11&nbsp;pm last call, and the closure of the establishment at midnight. All strip clubs were ordered fully closed.\nOn September 28, Ontario reported 700 new cases, its highest daily record throughout the pandemic. Premier Ford explained that \"we know that we are in the second wave and we know that it will be worse than the first wave but what we don't know yet is how bad the second wave will be.\" The OHA proposed that Toronto and Ottawa be rolled back to Phase 2 restrictions (which would, among other restrictions, order the closure of bars and restaurants to indoor dining), citing evidence that indoor dining was a \"significant driver\" of rising cases. The OHA stated that \"without public health measures in place to limit opportunities for disease transmission, Ontario will soon see higher numbers of hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care units and more death.\"\nOctober\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=3 | Hospitalizations\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

The testing backlog increased significantly to over 90,000 tests. A one-time increase of 74 deaths was also added, due to a \"data review\" by Toronto Public Health accounting for deaths from earlier that had not yet been included in the provincial total.\nAmid these spikes, Ford announced that new capacity limits on bars, event facilities, gyms, and restaurants would be implemented in the hotspots of Peel, Ottawa, and Toronto, and a province-wide mandate on the wearing of face masks when social distancing is not possible, would take effect on October 3. He also announced that provincial testing centres would be limited to appointments only in order to manage their testing capacity and that the moratorium on reduced restrictions would be extended for another four weeks. Ford urged residents of the province to limit contact with people from outside their immediate household (especially during the Thanksgiving holiday), explaining that \"we're in a second wave of COVID-19 and as Premier it's my duty to protect the people.\"\nOn October 9, Ontario announced that Peel, Ottawa, and Toronto would be rolled back to Modified Stage 2 for 28 days from October 10. This came as the province surpassed its daily record of new cases for the second consecutive day. Province-wide, the government also recommended that residents stay home except for essential activities, and avoid non-essential interprovincial travel (especially to and from hotspots). On October 16, Premier Ford announced that York Region will also be rolled back to Modified Stage 2 for 28 days from October 19.\nOn October 19, Ontario recommended that children and their families not go out trick-or-treating in those parts of the province that have been hardest hit by a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.\nOn October 24, Ontario reported 978 new infections, creating a new daily high record during the pandemic, the next day on October 25, the record was broken once again with 1,042 new cases.\nNovember\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=3 | Hospitalizations\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

Under the new system, Ottawa, Peel, and York regions will be moved to the new third tier on the scale, \"Restrict\" (orange) at this time. By request of Mayor John Tory, this change was delayed in Toronto until November 14. Restaurants and bars will be allowed to reopen at all tiers of the scale besides the highest level (\"Lockdown\"), but subject to varying capacity limits.\nOn November 6, Premier Ford announced that Peel Region will not be moving to the \"Restrict\" (orange) tier, and will be moving to the \"Control\" (red) tier. The region has experienced the second-highest number of regional cases in the province, next to the cases in Toronto.\nOn November 7, the new \"Response Framework\" system went in place, with the exception of Toronto. The following day, on November 8, a new record high was set once again with 1328 new cases.\nOn November 10, Premier Ford announced Toronto would move to the \"Control\" (red) tier beginning November 14. The municipality proceeded to enact even more stringent restrictions than the provincial tier for a minimum of 28 days.\nOn November 12, new projections were released by the province. With a 3% growth rate, daily cases would increase to 2,500 and at 5% 6,500 by mid-December. Intensive care unit capacity in the province will exceed capacity in six-weeks if more measures are not put in place, warned the new projections.\nOn November 13, the provincial government announced changes to the Ontario COVID-19 Response Framework, lowering the metrics for regions to be moved into more stringent restriction categories. Halton Region, York Region, and Hamilton would be moving into the \"Control\" (red) tier beginning November 16, Durham Region, Brant County, Eastern Ontario, Niagara, Ottawa, Waterloo, Wellington-Dufferin, and Guelph would be moving into the \"Restrict\" (orange) tier, and Haldimand-Norfolk, Huron-Perth, Middlesex-London, Simcoe-Muskoka District, Southwestern Ontario, and Windsor-Essex would be moving into the \"Protect\" (yellow) tier.\nFrom November 3 to 14, Ontario recorded consecutive record-breaking numbers of daily new infections province-wide.\nOn November 20, Premier Ford announced that Peel Region and Toronto will be placed under Lockdown effective November 23. All dine-in restaurants, gyms, personal care services, and otherwise non-essential businesses will be ordered closed.\nOn November 27, Ontario reported a new record-breaking day of new cases with 1,855 new infections reported. The record high also coincided with a new record for most tests completed at 58,037.\nDecember\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=3 | Hospitalizations\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

On December 10, it was announced the first doses of the vaccine in Ontario will be administered to healthcare workers in the University Health Network in Toronto and The Ottawa Hospital in Ottawa beginning December 15.\nOn December 11, it was announced that the York and Windsor-Essex regions would move to the \"Lockdown\" category of the response framework effective December 14, while Middlesex-London, Simcoe Muskoka and Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph were moved to the \"Control\" category.\nOn December 14, nationwide distribution began for the first Canadian shipment of the BioNTech vaccine, with Ontario vaccinations beginning distribution with health care workers in Ottawa and Toronto. Anita Quidangen, a personal support worker from Toronto, was the first health care worker in Canada to receive a dose.\nFrom December 15 to 17, Ontario saw consecutive daily new infection records of COVID-19. On December 18, it was announced that Hamilton would be moved to \"Lockdown\" effective December 21.\nOn December 18, the Ontario Superior Court \"dismissed an attempt by Hudson's Bay Company to have the province's lockdown restrictions struck down or modified to allow its stores to open alongside competitors such as Walmart and Costco which are permitted to open because they sell essential items including groceries.\"\nOn December 21, Premier Ford announced that a \"strict\" Provincewide Shutdown would take effect at 12:1 December 26 (Boxing Day). The lockdown will take effect for 28 days in Southern Ontario (south of Sudbury), and 14 days in the northern regions of the province. All publicly funded schools were to remain closed to in-person classes until at least January 11, when elementary and secondary schools in the north, and elementary schools in the south were expected to return to in-person classes. Secondary schools were to return to in-person classes on January 25. The province is recommending residents to remain home unless performing an essential activity, and against non-essential interregional travel. The province is also recommending 14 days self-isolation if returning from travel from outside of Ontario.\nCriticism was fronted toward the government rollout of vaccinations over the winter holidays. Vaccinations were paused during statutory holidays. As of the afternoon of December 24, 2020,  Ontario had only administered 10,756 vaccine doses of a total 90,000 received by the federal government. The government officially blamed staff shortages for the cessation of vaccinations.
