Players can earn money by killing other players and holding a certain item (called \"the pill\") at the end of the game but lose money when being hit or killed.\nKwari received negative reviews on release, with GamesRadar+ giving it 2 stars out of 5, criticizing game's technical aspects and the business model by saying it sets most players up to lose money.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
