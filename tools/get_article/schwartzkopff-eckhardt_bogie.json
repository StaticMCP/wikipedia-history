      "text": "# Schwartzkopff-Eckhardt bogie\n\nA Schwartzkopff-Eckhardt bogie ( or Schwartzkopff-Eckhardt-Gestell) is a mechanical device to improve the curve running of steam locomotives.\nThe Schwartzkopff-Eckhardt bogie is a further refinement of the Krauss-Helmholtz bogie, whereby two coupled axles and the carrying axle are combined within the bogie. The carrying axle steers the second coupled axle via a long shaft and this also moves the first coupled axle via a Beugniot lever. This bogie is used on the DRG Class 84. Whether DR Class 99.23-24 locomotives were also fitted with this arrangement is not entirely clear.\nIt was named after the L. Schwartzkopff locomotive factory and its chief engineer, Friedrich Wilhelm Eckhardt.\nSee also\n*DRG Class 84\n*DR Class 99.23-24\nReferences\n*Friedrich Wilhelm Eckhardt: Das Fahrgestell der Dampflokomotiven, Transpress, Berlin 1960\n*Friedrich Wilhelm Eckhardt: Lokomotivkunde.
