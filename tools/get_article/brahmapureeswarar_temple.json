Worshippers believe that a person can change his fate by seeking the blessings of Brahma and Brahmapureeswarar Shiva Temple, Tirupattur.\nHistory\nThe god Brahma's overwhelming pride as the Creator of the Universe.  Brahma felt that he was more prevailing than Shiva – since he had the supremacy of creation.\nThis sense of pride provoked Shiva, who destroyed Brahma’s Fifth Head, and also cursed him that he would lose his power of creation.\nTo relieve himself of this curse,  Brahma started out on a pilgrimage of Shiva Temples.\nDuring the course of his pilgrimage,  Brahma also visited this temple and installed 12 Shiva Lingams around Brahmapureeswarar and worshipped Shiva here for a considerable time.\nBeing moved by Brahma's prayers,  Shiva, on Devi Parvathi’s appeal, gave him Darshan under the Magizha tree and liberated him from his curse.  Shiva also restored the power and responsibility of creation to Brahma.\nShiva also blessed Brahma that he would have a separate shrine at this temple. He also advised Brahma that since Brahma himself had his destiny rewritten here; he should rewrite the destiny of his devotees visiting this temple.\nSince the fate of Brahma, the Creator, himself was changed by Shiva at Tirupattur, one can expect a turning point in life by praying at this temple.\nThe temple is under the administration of [https://web.archive.org/web/20100106092251/http://www.hrce.tn.nic.in/ The Hindu Religious And Charitable Endowments Department], Government of Tamil Nadu.\nTemple Timings\nAll Days: 7:00 AM - 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM\nOn Every Thursdays:\nOpen: 5:30 AM - 1:00 PM, 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM\n'Pooja Timings:'\nKalashanthi Pooja: 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM\nUchikala Pooja: 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM\nSayaratchi Pooja: 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM\nArthajama Pooja: 7:30 PM to 8:00 PM\nLiterary mentions\nAccording to the Tirupaatu, the eighth-century Saint Sundarar has praised about this temple and presiding deity Brahmapureeswarar as follows:\nஅம்மானே ஆகமசீலர்க்கு அருள் நல்கும் பிரம்மானே\nபேரருளாளன் பிடவூரன் தம்மானே\nதாந்தமிழ் நூற்புலவானர்க்கோர் அம்மானே\nபறவியூன் மண்டலி அம்மானே.\nThe sage Patañjali is said to have attained Samadhi through yogic meditation at the temple. Jeeva Samadhi of sage Patanjali, which is now an enclosed meditation hall, can be seen near the Brahma's shrine within the temple complex.\nShrines in the Complex\nThe presiding deities are Brahmapureeswarar in the form of Swayambu Lingam and Devi Brahma Sampath Gowri.\nThere is a separate shrine for Brahma. The idol of Brahma is in meditative pose sitting in Padmasana on a lotus. The temple complex also has the Jeeva Samadhi of Yogi Patanjali, the author of Yoga Sutras.\nThe 12 Shrines of Shiva\nThere are 12 Shiv Lingams in the Temple complex, which includes the garden adjacent to the temple. These Shiva Lingams were installed and worshipped by Brahma.\nMost of these Shiv Lingams are housed in separate shrines, which are situated around the Brahma Theertham.\nBrahma Theertham is the pond from which Brahma took water for performing puja to Shiva.\nThese 12 shrines of Shiva which comprise the Bramhapureeswarar Temple complex are :\n* Sri Brahmapureeswarar Presiding Deity\n* Sri Pazhamalai Nathar\n* Sri Pathala Eswarar\n* Sri Thayumanavar\n* Sri Manduga Nathar\n* Sri Ekambareswarar\n* Sri Arunachaleswarar\n* Sri Kailasa Nathar\n* Sri Jambukeshwarar\n* Sri Kalathi Nathar\n* Sri Sabthagereswarar\n* Sri Sudharaneswarar\nRecent Miracles\nOther than the main Shiva shrine, most of the portion of the temple was desolated until 1998.
