Queen Gyeonghwa became a queen consort through her marriage with her first cousin, King Yejong as his first and primary wife, with which she became the 11th reigned Goryeo queen who followed her maternal clan after Queen Inpyeong. She was called Princess Yeonhwa () when she was still a child/princess.\nShe then followed her mother's clan, the Incheon Yi and married in 1106, along with she whom formally became Yejong's queen. Beside their relationship before as a first cousin, Yejong was said to love her very much since her appearance and attitude were clear and extraordinary, beautiful. However, she later died at 31 years of age in 1109 and Yejong was said to be very sad about this. He buried her in Jareung Tomb () and gave her posthumous name.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0003022 Queen Gyeonghwa] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture ."
