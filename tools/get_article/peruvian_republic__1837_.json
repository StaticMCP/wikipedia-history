A tariff war soon began between both states, and Luis José de Orbegoso's support of Ramón Freire's failed expedition against Diego Portales worsened the situation. Thus, the Congress of Chile approved the declaration of war on December 26, 1836, claiming that Andrés de Santa Cruz's rule over Peru was illegitimate, and that his influence threatened the integrity of other South American nations, as seen by Orbegoso's support for the attempted invasion of Chile by Freire, specifically pointing out the attempt on Portales. Portales was later assassinated in Valparaíso after a mutiny broke out in Quillota, leading to preparations for the invasion of South Peru.\nThe first \"Restorative Expedition\" of the United Restoration Army left Valparaíso on September 15, 1837, landing in Quilca, and occupying Arequipa on October 12. The Confederate Navy captured the Juan Fernández Islands on November 14.\nOn November 17, after the Chileans were surrounded by Peruvian troops, the Treaty of Paucarpata was signed by Manuel Blanco Encalada under the guarantee of Great Britain, through which the occupation was undone six days later and the Peruvian ships captured by Chile were to be returned. After Blanco Encalada's troops arrived in Valparaíso, he was met with hostile demonstrations and the Chilean government repudiated the treaty of Paucarpata.\nSee also\n*Peruvian Republic (1838–1839)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*  |first=Jorge|last=Basadre Grohmann|year=2014|title=Historia de la República del Perú [1822-1933]|volume=2|publisher=El Comercio|isbn=978-612-306-353-5|author-link=Jorge Basadre}}\n*  |title=Nuevo Compendio de Historia del Perú|last=Tamayo Herrera|first=José|author-link=José Tamayo Herrera|publisher=Editorial Lumen|year=1985|isbn=}}"
