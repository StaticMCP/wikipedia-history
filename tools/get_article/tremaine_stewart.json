He later scored his first goal for Aalesund against Haugesund on 16 May 2012 in his fifth league appearance for the club. He scored goals in both Aalesund's Europa League wins against KF Tirana.\nThe latter half of the 2012 season was bright for the Jamaican. On 29 July, he scored his second league goal for the club in the home 3–1 win against Stabæk, while he scored two times in an away win against Fredrikstad FK. This was Aalesund's first away win in 14 months.\nDuring July 2014, Stewart left Aalesund returning to Jamaica. Just over a year later, Stewart returned to Northern Europe, signing for Veikkausliiga side RoPS on a one-year contract.\nOn his return to Jamaica, he played again for Portmore United and Waterhouse before joining Dunbeholden in summer 2020.\nInternational career\nOn 24 February 2012, he made his international debut against Cuba coming on as a substitute. He made his first start and scored his first goal (Jamaica's second goal) in a 3–2 win over New Zealand on 29 February 2012.\nDeath\nStewart died suddenly and unexpectedly on the morning of 18 April 2021, after collapsing while playing in Spanish Town. Despite being brought to the nearest hospital, he could not be resuscitated.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Aalesund||2012||rowspan=\"3\"|Tippeligaen||21||4||4||0||2||2||27||6\n|-\n|2013||8||2||1||0||0||0||9||2\n|-\n|2014||5||0||3||1||0||0||8||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!34!!6!!8!!1!!2!!2!!44!!9\n|-\n|RoPS||2015||Veikkausliiga||4||0||0||0||0||0||4||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!38!!6!!8!!1!!2!!2!!48!!9\n|}\nSee also\n* List of association footballers who died while playing\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
