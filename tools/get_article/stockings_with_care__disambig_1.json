It provides toys as well as necessities like clothing, food, diapers, books and strollers. Individual donors (aka \"Santas\"), corporations and a small army of volunteers come together to purchase and wrap the gifts. They are then delivered anonymously to the parents before the holidays. In total, 40,000 children have had presents on Christmas thanks to Stockings With Care.\nHistory\nStockings with Care was founded in 1992 by Rosalie Joseph and Tom Fontana and is volunteer based.
