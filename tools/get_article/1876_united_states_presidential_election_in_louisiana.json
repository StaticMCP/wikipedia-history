Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nLouisiana was one of three states (along with Florida and South Carolina) in which the vote was disputed. On election night, the Democratic nominee, Samuel J. Tilden, led the Republican nominee, Rutherford B. Hayes, by 6,300 votes, but this was overturned by the Republican-controlled returning board, which threw out approximately 13,000 Democratic votes, along with 2,000 Republican votes, thus giving Hayes a majority. With the two parties sending opposing slates of electors to Washington, an Electoral Commission was formed to settle the results. This commission decided the three disputed states in favor of Hayes. Hayes won Louisiana by a narrow margin of 3.30%.\nThis would be the final presidential election until Dwight D. Eisenhower won the state in 1956 where a Republican presidential candidate would win Louisiana.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Louisiana\nReferences"
