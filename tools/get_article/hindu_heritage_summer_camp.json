It began with six tents at a location in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. During the 1990s it moved to Macedon, where it could utilize the facilities of the India Community Center for the Rochester area.\nMorning reveille at the camp is blown on a conch shell in homage to Hindu deity Vishnu, who is often depicted carrying one, In addition to traditional summer camp activities such as drama and arts and crafts, campers are offered classes on Hindu philosophy, playing cricket, and learning the garba, a traditional dance from Gujarat.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
