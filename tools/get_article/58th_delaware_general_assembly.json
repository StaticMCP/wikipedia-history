Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, Delaware, convening January 6, 1835, two weeks before the beginning of the third and fourth years of the administration of Governor Caleb P. Bennett. He died July 11, 1836, and replaced the remainder of the fourth year by Governor Charles Polk Jr.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Whig majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Charles Polk Jr., Sussex County\nHouse of Representatives\n*William D.
