The applicants sought access to the donation records of certain political parties, but the latter were judged to be private bodies in relation to those records. Section 8(1) of the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) recognises that a body may be \"public\" or \"private\" for the purposes of the Act depending on whether the record in question \"relates to the exercise of a power or the performance of a function as a public body or as a private body.\"\nSee also\n* South African administrative law\n* Access to information in South African law\nReferences\n* Institute for Democracy in South Africa and Others v African National Congress and Others 2005 (5) SA 39 (C); [2005] 3 All SA 45 (C); 2005 (10) BCLR 995 (C)\n* C.
