Teaching is an unusual profession in that it does not have one leading union, but has many different ones, often with differing aims. Having said that, the NEU and NASUWT jointly represent the vast majority of teachers in England and Wales, while the EIS represents the majority of teachers in Scotland.\nFor teachers and school staff looking for an alternative to the traditional teaching unions, Edapt provides legal support and advice in England and Wales.\nList of teachers' trade unions\nThe table below lists all the UK's registered teachers' unions in the primary and secondary education sectors (up to age 16), with details of establishment, membership, where they organise and the types of members they accept:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n!Full name\n!Short name\n!Established\n!Members\n!England\n!Northern Ireland\n!Scotland\n!Wales\n!Channel Islands & Isle of Man\n!Teachers\n!School leaders\n!Teaching assistants\n|-\n|Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland\n|AHDS\n|1975\n|1,385\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Association of School and College Leaders\n|ASCL\n|1977\n|24,913\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Community Education section (formerly known as Voice)\n|\n|2004\n|43,865\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Educational Institute of Scotland\n|EIS\n|1847\n|59,371\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Irish National Teachers' Organisation\n|INTO\n|1868\n|6,842\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|National Association of Head Teachers\n|NAHT\n|1897\n|27,988\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|NASUWT\n|NASUWT\n|1976\n|285,963\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|National Education Union: Association of Teachers and Lecturers section\n|NEU/ATL\n|2017\n(1978 as ATL)\n|160,000\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|National Education Union: National Union of Teachers section\n|NEU/NUT\n|2017\n(1870 as NUT)\n|497,400\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|School Leaders Scotland\n|SLS\n|1936\n|Part of the ASCL\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Scottish Primary Teachers' Association\n|SPTA\n|2011\n|Did not exist\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association\n|SSTA\n|1944\n|6,609\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Ulster Teachers' Union\n|UTU\n|1919\n|6,429\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Undeb Cenedlaethol Athrawon Cymru\n|UCAC\n|1940\n|3,879\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*UK labour law\n*List of trade unions in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
