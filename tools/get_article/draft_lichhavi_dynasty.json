Originally based in Vaishali (modern-day Bihar, India), where they formed a republican government, the Licchavis later established a monarchy in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, ruling from approximately the 4th to 8th century CE.\nIn India\nThe Licchavis first emerged as a republican Kshatriya clan in Vaishali, the capital of the Vajjika League, around 600 BCE. Their government featured a general assembly of noble families and was admired in Buddhist and Jain texts for its structure and governance. They are noted for their support of Gautama Buddha, who visited and preached in their territory.\nEventually, the Licchavi republic was annexed by the expanding Magadhan empire during the Magadha–Vajji war. Despite their decline, their legacy persisted. A Licchavi princess married into the Gupta dynasty, and her son, Samudragupta, referred to himself as \"Licchavi-dauhitra,\" meaning \"grandson of the Licchavis,\" highlighting their enduring prestige.\nIn Nepal\nBy the 4th century CE, a branch of the Licchavis migrated north to the Kathmandu Valley and founded a powerful monarchical dynasty. This era, known as the Licchavi period, is regarded as a golden age in Nepalese history. The dynasty ruled from around 400 to 750 CE, and its rulers promoted both Hinduism and Buddhism, maintaining strong cultural connections with India.\nMānadeva I (r. c. 464–505 CE) was one of the earliest and most prominent kings of this dynasty. He issued the first stone inscriptions in Nepal and expanded the kingdom's territory. Later rulers, such as Shivadeva I, Narendradeva, and Jishnu Gupta, continued to support religion, temple construction, and the arts. Amshuverma, although not of Licchavi blood, served as a powerful prime minister and de facto ruler in the early 7th century.\nCulture and Religion\nThe Licchavi era in Nepal saw a flourishing of Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Mahayana Buddhism were all supported by the state. Numerous temples, sculptures, and viharas were built during this time, many of which still exist today in the Kathmandu Valley. Sanskrit was the primary administrative and literary language, and coinage reflected strong influence from the Gupta Empire.\nLegacy\nThe Licchavi dynasty symbolizes the bridge between ancient Indian republican ideals and early Nepalese monarchy. In India, the Licchavis are remembered for their innovative republican governance and spiritual contributions. In Nepal, they are credited with founding a stable and culturally rich kingdom that laid the groundwork for later dynasties, such as the Mallas. Their inscriptions remain among the oldest historical records in Nepal.\nSee also\nVaishali (ancient city), Samudragupta, History of Nepal, Licchavis of Nepal, Thakuri dynasty, List of monarchs of Nepal\nExternal links\n[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Licchavi – Licchavi Dynasty]\nRelated article – Licchavis of Nepal\nReferences"
