The Spanish Division of Llobregat led by Campoverde intercepted and destroyed the French vanguard (500 men) at Santa Perpètua de Mogoda. Then, the Spanish marched to Mollet to face the rest of Duhesme forces (1,500 regulars, 160 cuirassiers and 2 cannons). The French were surrounded by the Spanish force and finally, after a vigorous defense, the French surrendered. The Spanish captured 500 French soldiers, 140 cuirassiers, 2 cannons, and the baggage. Duhesme and the rest of his force fled to Granollers, and were saved from other Spanish attack thanks to the arrival of Marshal Pierre Augereau with 9.000 men.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
