It was responsible for promoting, supporting, developing and protecting the arts, culture and heritage of South Africa. The heritage sites, museums and monuments of the country also resided under this ministry. The political head of the department was the Minister of Arts and Culture. In June 2019 the department was merged with Sport and Recreation South Africa to form a new Department of Sports, Arts and Culture.\nSee also\n* Culture minister\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dac.gov.za/ Department of Arts and Culture]"
