Throughout the year, 21&nbsp;tropical cyclones became named storms in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Hurricane Alma formed on May&nbsp;12, 1990, three days before the season's official start on May&nbsp;15. The Central Pacific hurricane season began on June&nbsp;1, covering tropical cyclone formation in the region between 140°W and International Dateline. Hurricane Trudy was the last storm to dissipate, doing so on November&nbsp;1, nearly a month before the Pacific hurricane season officially ended on November&nbsp;30.\nThe season produced twenty-seven tropical depressions, of which twenty-one became named storms, and sixteen strengthened into hurricanes. Six out of the sixteen hurricanes strengthened into major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} Despite high levels of activity, Rachel was the only system to make landfall, bringing floods to Northwestern Mexico and the Southwestern United States. Thousands were left homeless, and there were 18&nbsp;confirmed fatalities. Additionally, the remnants of Hurricane Boris brought light showers to California. At that time, Hurricane Hernan was the strongest Pacific hurricane to have its intensity estimated via satellite imagery; this record was matched by Hurricane Trudy months later. One tropical storm formed in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's warning zone and eventually crossed the International Dateline before dissipating. All other units are rounded to the nearest digit.|group=\"nb\"}} south of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero.\n;May&nbsp;13\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression One-E strengthens into Tropical Storm Alma, becoming an off-season tropical cyclone.\n;May&nbsp;15\n*The 1990&nbsp;Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Alma strengthens into a Category 1 hurricane.\n;May&nbsp;16\n*0600&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;p.m. PDT May&nbsp;15) &ndash; Hurricane Alma attains its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of .\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Hurricane Alma weakens to a tropical storm.\n;May&nbsp;17\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Alma weakens to a tropical depression.\n;May&nbsp;18\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Alma dissipates while centered about 1,445&nbsp;mi (2,325&nbsp;km) southwest of San Diego, California.\nJune\n;June&nbsp;1\n*The 1990&nbsp;Central Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\n;June&nbsp;2\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Two-E develops from a tropical wave while located about 430&nbsp;mi (690&nbsp;km) south of Acapulco, Guerrero.\n;June&nbsp;4\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;p.m. PDT June&nbsp;3) &ndash; The depression strengthens into Tropical Storm Boris.\n;June&nbsp;5\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;p.m. PDT June&nbsp;4) &ndash; Tropical Storm Boris strengthens into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane.\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Hurricane Boris attains its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum pressure of .\n;June&nbsp;6\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Hurricane Boris weakens back into a tropical storm.\n;June&nbsp;7\n*0600&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;p.m. PDT June&nbsp;6) &ndash; The NHC downgrades Tropical Storm Boris into a tropical depression.\n;June&nbsp;8\n*1200U&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Three-E develops from a tropical wave located about  south of the southern tip of Baja California Sur.\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Boris dissipates about  west of La Paz, Baja California Sur.\n;June&nbsp;9\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; The tropical depression intensifies into Tropical Storm Cristina.\n;June 12\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Cristina reaches its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of .\n;June&nbsp;14\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;p.m. PDT June&nbsp;13) &ndash; Tropical Storm Cristina weakens to a tropical depression.\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Cristina dissipates about  southwest of Guadalupe Island.\n;June&nbsp;19\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;p.m. PDT June&nbsp;18) &ndash; Tropical Depression Four-E develops from a tropical wave while located about  south of Acapulco.\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Four strengthens into Tropical Storm Douglas.\n;June&nbsp;21\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Douglas attains its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum pressure of .\n;June&nbsp;23\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Douglas weakens to a tropical depression.\n;June&nbsp;24\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;p.m. PDT June&nbsp;23) &ndash; Tropical Depression Douglas dissipates about  south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California.\n;June&nbsp;26\n*0600&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;p.m. PDT June&nbsp;25) &ndash; Tropical Depression Five-E forms about  south of Acapulco.\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;a.m. PDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Five-E strengthens into Tropical Storm Elida.\n;June&nbsp;28\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (5&nbsp;p.m. PDT June&nbsp;27) &ndash; Tropical Storm Elida becomes a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane.\n*0600&nbsp;UTC (11&nbsp;p.m. PDT June&nbsp;27) &ndash; Hurricane Elida attains its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of .
