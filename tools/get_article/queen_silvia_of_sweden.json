She has held this title since her marriage to Carl XVI Gustaf in 1976. The king and queen have three children: Crown Princess Victoria, Prince Carl Philip, and Princess Madeleine.\nChildhood and parentage\nSilvia Renate Sommerlath was born in Heidelberg, Germany, on 23 December 1943, the only daughter of Alice (née Soares de Toledo) and Walther Sommerlath. Her father was German and her mother Brazilian.\nShe has one older brother, Ralf Sommerlath (born 1929). Her other brothers were Walther Sommerlath, who died in 2020, and Jörg Sommerlath, who died in 2006. The Mother-Child House Jörg Sommerlath in Berlin, operated by Queen Silvia's World Childhood Foundation, is named after her brother.\nShe attended grammar school in Düsseldorf, finishing her Abitur in 1963; and attended the Munich School of Interpreting from 1965 to 1969, majoring in Spanish.\nShe has some fluency in Swedish Sign Language, a national sign language used by the deaf community in Sweden. She is a trained interpreter and Swedish is her sixth language. She speaks her native German, her mother's language of Portuguese, as well as French, Spanish, and English.\nMarriage and family\nDuring the 1972 Summer Olympics, Sommerlath met Crown Prince Carl Gustaf. At the time, she was leading a marketing campaign for the city of Munich. Sommerlath and the other Olympic hostesses wore sky-blue dirndls to promote Bavarian cultural identity. After the death of King Gustaf VI Adolf on 15 September 1973, Carl XVI Gustaf succeeded to the throne.\nHe and Sommerlath announced their engagement on 12 March 1976 and were married three months later on 19 June 1976 in Stockholm Cathedral. It was the first marriage of a reigning Swedish monarch since 1797. The wedding was preceded the evening before by a Royal Variety Performance, where the Swedish musical group ABBA performed \"Dancing Queen\" for the first time as a tribute to Sweden's future queen.\nThe King and Queen have three children and nine grandchildren:\n*Crown Princess Victoria, Duchess of Västergötland (born 14 July 1977), who is married to Daniel Westling and has two children\n*Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland (born 13 May 1979), who is married to Sofia Hellqvist and has four children\n*Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, (born 10 June 1982), who is married to Christopher O'Neill and has three children\nIn February 2021, Silvia was taken to hospital after she fractured her right wrist in a fall.\nFather's Nazi links\nIn July 2002, the Queen became the subject of international curiosity when an article published in the syndicalist newspaper Arbetaren reported that German state archives recorded that the Queen's father, Walther Sommerlath, joined the Nazi party's foreign wing, the NSDAP/AO, in 1934, when he was living in Brazil and working for a German steel company. In December 2010, Queen Silvia wrote a letter of complaint to Jan Scherman, the CEO of TV4, the network that had aired a documentary about her father's alleged Nazi past.\nQueen Silvia commissioned a report from World War II expert Erik Norberg, a choice that was criticised due to Norberg having ties to the royal family. In his report, Norberg said that the Queen's father had in fact helped the owner of the steel-fabrication plant, a Jewish businessperson, escape from Germany by taking over the factory. In a December 2011 interview for Sweden's public service broadcaster Sveriges Television, Silvia called the media's handling of the information about her father \"character assassination\".\nCharity involvement\n, Estonia, in 1992.]]\nQueen Silvia established Mentor International in 1994 in collaboration with the World Health Organization. Her vision was to offer mentoring as inspiration, empowerment, and motivation for young people to make healthy life choices and view their futures more positively. Mentor's work has been recognized by the United Nations Office on Drugs & Crime, the Organization of American States, and the Council of Europe. She is now an honorary board member of Mentor Foundation.\nShe was also a co-founder of the World Childhood Foundation in 1999, having been inspired by her work as Patron of the first World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children held in Stockholm. She has also been involved in the Global Child Forum, which she helped initiate, as a keynote speaker in several forums.\nHer commitment to the work with dementia and the care of the elderly at the end of life is also well known and respected. On her initiative, Silviahemmet was established in Stockholm. It works to educate hospital personnel in how to work with people suffering from dementia, and also initiates research in the area.\nShe chairs the Royal Wedding Fund, which supports research in sports and athletics for disabled young people and the Queen Silvia Jubilee Fund for research on children and disability.\nQueen Silvia holds honorary positions in the Swedish Amateur Athletic Association, the Children's Cancer Foundation of Sweden and Save the Children Sweden.\nIn popular culture\nIn May 2025, Queen Silvia made a surprise appearance on national television in Sweden to honor entertainer-designer Christer Lindarw in a program about Lindarw's life and career.\nHonours and arms\nNational\n* :\n** Member and Commander of the Royal Order of the Seraphim, in diamonds (LoKavKMOmbr)\n** Member 1st Class of the Royal Family Decoration of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n** Recipient of the 50th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n** Recipient of the Wedding Medal of Crown Princess Victoria to Daniel Westling\n** Recipient of the Ruby Jubilee Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n** Recipient of the 70th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n** Recipient of the Golden Jubilee Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf\nForeign\n* : Grand Cross of the Order of the Liberator General San Martín\n* : Grand Star of the Order of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria\n* : Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold\n* : Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross\n* : Honorary recipient of the Family Order of Laila Utama\n* : Grand Cross of the Order of the Balkan Mountains\n* : Grand Cross of the Order of Bernardo O'Higgins\n* : Grand Cross of the Grand Order of Queen Jelena\n* :\n** Knight of the Order of the Elephant (3 September 1985)\n** Recipient of the Silver Anniversary Medal of Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik\n* :\n** Grand Cross of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana\n** Grand Cross of the Order of the White Star\n* :\n** Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the White Rose of Finland\n* :\n** Grand Cross special class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n** Member of the Decoration of Merit (Baden-Würtemberg)\n** Member of the Decoration of Merit (Bavaria)\n* :\n** Grand Cross of the Order of the Legion of Honour\n** Grand Cross of the Order of National Merit\n* : Grand Cross of the Order of Honour\n* :\n** Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Pope Pius IX\n**Recipient of the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice\n* : Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary\n* : Grand Cross of the Order of the Falcon\n* : Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic\n* : Grand Cordon (Paulownia) of the Order of the Precious Crown\n* : Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance\n* :\n** Commander of the Great Cross of the Order of the Three Stars\n** Commander of the Great Cross of the Order of Cross of Recognition\n* :\n** Grand Cross of the Order of Vytautas the Great\n** Grand Cross of the Order of Merit\n* : Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau[http://www.kungahuset.se/kungafamiljen/aktuellahandelser/2008/2008aktuellt/galamiddagpakungligaslottet.5.36df73941192994694f80001449.html Swedish Royal website] , kungahuset.se; accessed 7 April 2016.
