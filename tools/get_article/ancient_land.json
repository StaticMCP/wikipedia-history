The digital album was released on 28 September 2018 and the CD was released on 26 October 2018, with a digital deluxe edition following on 6 September 2019.\nThe album is produced, arranged, and orchestrated by Gavin Murphy and includes a mixture of traditional Irish songs and contemporary arrangements. The lead performers are vocalists Mairéad Carlin, Éabha McMahon, and Megan Walsh as well as instrumentalist Tara McNeill. Ancient Land was Walsh's studio debut and live debut with the group.\nAn accompanying concert special of the same title was recorded live outside of Johnstown Castle in County Wexford, Ireland on 13 and 14 September 2018 in front of an invited audience. It was the group's first outdoor special since Songs from the Heart was recorded nine years prior. The special began airing on PBS in November 2018, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 25 January 2019.\nBoth the album and concert special were both dedicated to Dave Kavanagh, one of the founders of Celtic Woman, who died on 6 April 2018, and was, according to the group, \"our founder, our leader, our guiding light.
