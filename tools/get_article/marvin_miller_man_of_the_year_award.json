      "text": "# Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award\n\nThe Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award is given annually to a Major League Baseball (MLB) player \"whose on-field performance and contributions to his community inspire others to higher levels of achievement.\"  The award was created by the Major League Baseball Players' Association (MLBPA) and was presented to the inaugural winner – Mark McGwire – in 1997 as the \"Man of the Year Award\".  Three years later, it was renamed in honor of Marvin Miller, the first executive director of the MLBPA.  The award forms part of the Players Choice Awards.\nIn order to determine the winner, each MLB team nominates one of their players, who is selected by their teammates to appear on the ballot.  An online vote is conducted among baseball fans in order to reduce the number of candidates to six.  MLB players then choose the award winner from among the six finalists.  In addition to the award, recipients have $50,000 donated on their behalf to charities of their choice by the MLB Players Trust. John Smoltz, Jim Thome, Michael Young, Curtis Granderson, and Marcus Semien are the only players to win the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award on multiple occasions.  Five winners – Paul Molitor, Jim Thome, Smoltz, Chipper Jones and Mariano Rivera – are members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nWinners of the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award have undertaken a variety of different causes.  Many winners, including McGwire, Thome, Smoltz, Mike Sweeney, Torii Hunter, Young, Curtis Granderson and Brandon Inge, worked with children in need.  McGwire established a foundation to assist children who were physically or sexually abused, while Inge visited disabled children at the Mott Children's Hospital and donated part of his salary to raise money for a pediatric cancer infusion center.  Other winners devoted their work to aiding individuals who had a specific illness, such as Albert Pujols, whose daughter suffers from Down syndrome, and who devoted the Pujols Family Foundation to helping those with the disease, and Jones, who has been raising money for cystic fibrosis since 1996, after meeting an 11-year-old fan who suffered from the disease and who died several weeks after meeting Jones through the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nWinners\n, the 1998 recipient, is one of five award winners to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.|alt=Paul Molitor in a navy blue baseball jersey with \"Twins\" written across the chest holding a navy blue cap and smiling.]]\nis one of five players to win the award on multiple occasions.|alt=Michael Young, wearing a blue batting helmet and baseball jersey with the lettering TEXAS across it and the Flag of Texas on the left sleeve, clutches a baseball bat in his left hand and looks towards the left after hitting a baseball.]]\nwon the award in 2013, the final year of his career.|alt=Mariano Rivera, wearing a grey uniform with the lettering \"NEW YORK\" across it, with his body facing the right as he prepares to throw a baseball.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Key\n!scope=\"row\"|Year\n|Links to the article about the corresponding Major League Baseball year\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Player\n|Name of the player and number of times they had won the award at that point (if more than one)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Team\n|The player's team at the time he won the award\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Position\n|The player's position at the time he won the award\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb;\"|\n|Member of the Baseball Hall of Fame\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#cfecec;\"|\n|Player is active\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Winners\n!scope=\"col\"|Year\n!scope=\"col\"|Player\n!scope=\"col\"|Team\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Oakland AthleticsSt. Louis Cardinals||First baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb\"|}}\n|Minnesota Twins||Designated hitter||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Chicago Cubs||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|St. Louis Cardinals||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb\"|}}\n|Cleveland Indians||First baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb\"|}}\n|Atlanta Braves||Relief pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb\"|}}\n|Atlanta Braves||Relief pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb\"|}}\n|Philadelphia Phillies||First baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Kansas City Royals||First baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|St. Louis Cardinals||First baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Minnesota Twins||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Texas Rangers||Shortstop||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Detroit Tigers||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Detroit Tigers||Third baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Texas Rangers||Infielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb;\"|}}\n|Atlanta Braves||Third baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color: #ffffbb;\"|}}\n|New York Yankees||Relief pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfecec;\"|}}\n|Los Angeles Dodgers||Starting pitcher||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Baltimore Orioles||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|New York Mets||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfecec;\"|}}\n|Chicago Cubs||First baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Toronto Blue JaysMilwaukee Brewers||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Miami Marlins||Outfielder||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|Minnesota Twins||Designated hitter||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfecec;\"|}}\n|Toronto Blue Jays||Second baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfecec;\"|}}\n|New York Mets||Shortstop||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfecec;\"|}}\n|Texas Rangers||Second baseman||\n|-\n|\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfecec;\"|}}\n|Milwaukee Brewers||First baseman||\n|}\nSee also\n*Roberto Clemente Award\n*Lou Gehrig Memorial Award\n*Branch Rickey Award\n*Baseball awards\n*List of Major League Baseball awards\nNotes\nReferences\nGeneral\n*\n*\nSpecific"
