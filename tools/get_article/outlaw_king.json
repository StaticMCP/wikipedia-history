Chris Pine stars as Scottish king Robert the Bruce during the Scottish Wars of Independence in 1304–07. The ensemble cast also features Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Florence Pugh, Billy Howle, Sam Spruell, Tony Curran, Callan Mulvey, James Cosmo and Stephen Dillane.\nOutlaw King premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2018, and was released on streaming on November 9 by Netflix. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its production design, sets, performances, and choreography, but criticised its historical inaccuracies and clichés.\nPlot\nIn 1304, outside the besieged Stirling Castle, John Comyn, Robert Bruce and their allies surrender to Edward I of England and pay him their homage.\nAfterwards, Bruce spars with the king's son, Edward, Prince of Wales, whom he had known as a child (their fathers becoming friends whilst fighting on crusade in the Holy Land).  A widower, he is betrothed to the king's goddaughter, Elizabeth de Burgh. Lord James Douglas arrives, asking for the restoration of his ancestral lands, but is denied on the grounds that his father Lord Douglas committed treason. The King and Prince depart Scotland, with Bruce and Comyn acting as their vassals under the supervision of the Earl of Pembroke, Aymer de Valence.\nRobert marries Elizabeth but respectfully delays the consummation.  Elizabeth is, however, an increasingly important presence in the life of Robert's daughter, Marjorie.  Not long after, his father, the Lord of Annandale, dies, fearing his friendship with the King of England may have been an error.\nSoon after, while delivering tax monies to the English, Bruce notes their unpopularity. Rioting ensues when news of the rebel William Wallace's  execution reaches Scotland. Bruce decides to organize another rebellion with the support of his family, including Elizabeth. He meets Comyn in a church, trying to persuade him to join the rebellion but as Comyn threatens to inform Edward, Bruce kills him. The Scottish clergy offers Bruce absolution for serving the English and supports Bruce's bid for the crown of Scotland if he supports the Catholic Church. King Edward declares Bruce an outlaw and orders the Prince of Wales to suppress his uprising, with instructions that no quarter is to be shown to any Bruce supporter.\nCalling a council of nobles, most refuse to break their oaths to Edward. Despite the lack of support, Bruce heads to Scone to be crowned king of the Scots. On the way, Douglas pledges his allegiance. The ambitious de Valence, brother-in-law to Comyn, tries to move against Bruce before the Prince arrives. To avoid bloodshed, he challenges de Valence to single combat, who accepts but delays the duel a day, as it is Sunday. That night, Bruce and Elizabeth finally consummate their marriage, but the English launch a surprise attack. Elizabeth and Marjorie Bruce are sent to safety with his brother Nigel, and he fights a losing battle, during which most of the Scottish army is killed. Escaping with fifty men, they flee to Islay. On the way, John MacDougall parleys with them, bitter about the murder of his cousin Comyn but allows them to pass. Later, however, he attacks Bruce as his party attempts to cross Loch Ryan. Some get away in boats, but Bruce's brother Alexander dies.\nPrince Edward arrives in Scotland, searching for Bruce at Kildrummy Castle, only to find Bruce's wife, daughter, and brother. The prince has Nigel hanged, drawn, and quartered, and sends Marjorie and Elizabeth into captivity in England. Bruce's band presses on to Islay anyway; there, they learn of the fall of Kildrummy Castle. Bruce decides to take back the castle through stealth. The successful operation inspires him to utilize guerilla warfare against the more powerful English. Shortly thereafter, Robert the Bruce is reunited with his only surviving brother, Edward. In England, Elizabeth learns that Marjorie has been sent to a nunnery by King Edward. After Edward hears Douglas Castle has been re-taken, he goes after Bruce himself. Edward offers amnesty to Elizabeth if she renounces her marriage, but she refuses and is put in a hanging cage.\nKing Edward I dies shortly after arriving in Scotland, and his son takes over his forces. Bruce fights the new king in a pitched battle at Loudoun Hill, despite being outnumbered six to one. As Edward II's army is composed almost entirely of cavalry, Robert overcomes his army's size disadvantage in the battle with a spear wall hidden by a ditch. Attempting to attack the flanks, horsemen become bogged down in the mud, as anticipated. The English knights fall from their horses, many are slain, and the battle becomes an open brawl, where the Scots prevail over the disoriented English soldiers, with James killing the noble to whom King Edward had granted his family's lands. Realising the battle is hopeless, de Valence orders a retreat. However, determined to kill his nemesis, Edward II does not join them. Instead, he duels Bruce as the Scots look on. Edward is outmatched, and realising he is about to be slain, he vomits in fear and cries for help. Bruce prevails, allowing Edward II to leave unarmed.\nCast\nProduction\nPrincipal photography began on 28 August 2017 on location in both Scotland and England. Filming took place in various locations including Linlithgow Palace & Loch, and St Michael's Parish Church, Borthwick Castle, Doune Castle, Craigmillar Castle, Dunfermline Abbey, Glasgow Cathedral, Muiravonside Country Park, Mugdock Country Park, Aviemore, Isle of Skye (Talisker Bay, Coral Beaches and Loch Dunvegan), Glen Coe, Loch Lomond, Gargunnock, University of Glasgow, Blackness Castle, Seacliff Beach and Berwick-upon-Tweed and Tweedmouth (the latter two both in Northumberland - Berwick-upon-Tweed's bridge doubling for London Bridge). Principal production concluded in November 2017.\nRelease\nThe film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2018. The premiere's runtime of 137 minutes and its pacing were criticised in early reviews, and Mackenzie subsequently cut nearly 20 minutes from the film. Cut material includes a battle scene, a major confrontation backdropped by a waterfall, an eight-minute chase sequence, and a scene in which Pine's character meets William Wallace in the woods. The film had its European premiere at the London Film Festival in October 2018 and was commercially released on November 9, 2018.\nReception\nCritical response\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipients\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n| Visual Effects Society Awards\n| February 5, 2019\n| Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature\n| Alex Bicknell, Dan Bethell, Greg O'Connor, Stefano Pepin\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nHistorical authenticity\nThe film implies that Robert I (\"Robert the Bruce\") began his rebellion almost immediately after the execution of William Wallace, implying that he intended to avenge Wallace. He began his rebellion a full year after Wallace's death. During the intermediate period, Edward I became suspicious of Robert I and ordered him to stay at Kildrummy Castle.\nThe film's depiction of Edward II's role in the Battle of Loudoun Hill is heavily flawed. It is unlikely that he was present at the battle in any capacity. Moreover, it is certain that he would not have challenged Bruce to single combat. Even if he had been present and challenged Bruce to personal combat, a hostage as valuable as Edward II would not have been allowed to flee.\nThe title character in Outlaw King is that of an enigmatic and well-behaved man of the people who desires to restore Scotland to its inhabitants. However, historian Fiona Watson speculates that the real Robert I was most likely cold, canny, and driven by his personal ambition.\nThe color yellow is mostly absent from the clothing of the fighting men. In contrast, the yellow dye was not only the most common dye in Scotland during the period, but it was also highly favoured by the fighters with the means to afford it. Historian Fergus Cannan notes that while many historical writers comment on its prevalence, it remains absent from appearances in popular culture related to Scottish history.\nSee also\n*Robert the Bruce (2019) stars Angus Macfadyen as Robert the Bruce, but depicts different events.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
