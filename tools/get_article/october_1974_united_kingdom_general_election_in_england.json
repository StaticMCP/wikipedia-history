It was the second general election held that year.\nWhile the Labour Party led by Prime Minister Harold Wilson clinched an overall narrow majority of 3 seats in the House of Commons, in England, the Labour Party won just two seats over the opposition Conservative Party led by Edward Heath.\nThis remains the last general election in which a party won an overall majority in the Commons without winning a majority of seats in England. Since this election, the Labour Party has won more seats in England only on 4 occasions- 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2024.\nResult Table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Party\n!Seats won\n!Net change in seats\n!Total votes\n!Voteshare\n!Change in voteshare\n|-\n|Labour\n|255\n|18\n|9,694,579\n|40.1%\n|2.4%\n|-\n|Conservative\n|253\n|15\n|9,416,154\n|38.9%\n|1.3%\n|-\n|Liberal\n|8\n|1\n|4,878,975\n|20.2%\n|1.1%\n|}\n|49.41}}\n|49.03}}\n|1.55}}}}\nSee also\n* October 1974 United Kingdom general election\nReferences\nFurther References\n# Pilling, Sam; Cracknell, Richard (18 August 2021). \"UK Election Statistics: 1918-2021: A Century of Elections\" (PDF).
