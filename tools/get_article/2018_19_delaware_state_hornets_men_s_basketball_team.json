They played their home games at Memorial Hall in Dover, Delaware, and were led by 1st-year head coach Eric Skeeters.\nPrevious season\nThe Hornets finished the 2017–18 season 4–28, 2–14 in the MEAC play to finish in last place. They lost in the first round of the MEAC tournament to North Carolina A&T. They lost every game on the road and on a neutral court, with both of their non-conference victories coming against non-Division I schools. They had the dubious distinction of finishing the season 351st in RPI out of the 351 teams in the NCAA.\nOn February 22, 2018, head coach Keith Walker was fired and associate head coach Keith Johnson was named interim head coach for the remainder of the season. On July 26, 5 months after Walker was fired, the school hired UMBC assistant Eric Skeeters for the head coaching job.\nRoster\n)\n|asst_coach=\n* Keith Goodie ()\n* Kevin McClain ()\n* Stephen Stewart ()\n|roster_url=http://www.dsuhornets.com/SportSelect.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=12900&SPID=5813&SPSID=82265\n|accessdate=January 1, 2019\n}}\nSchedule and results\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=| Non-Conference Regular season\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=| MEAC regular season\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=| MEAC tournament\n|-\n|-\nSource\nReferences"
