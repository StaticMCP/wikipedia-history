It is served by Sydney Trains' T2 Leppington & Inner West Line, T3 Liverpool & Inner West Line and T5 Cumberland line services.\nHistory\nThe original Warwick Farm station opened on 18 March 1889 as a private platform for William Forrester near the former level crossing on the Hume Highway. It was relocated to its present location in 1943 when nearby Warwick Farm Racecourse was used as a military camp.\nPreviously, a 1.6-kilometre branch line to the racecourse branched off from the Main South line north of the station, and carried special racecourse trains on race days. The branch opened in June 1889, closed in August 1990 and was removed in December 1991.\nThe Southern Sydney Freight Line opened immediately to the east of the station in January 2013. As part of its construction, a footbridge with lifts and stairs was constructed. Previously, crossing the railway line required passengers to use the Hume Highway bridge. Platform 2 was very narrow and was widened during the works.\nPlatforms and services\n|p1blinename = T3\n|p1bstop     = services to Central & the City Circle via Regents Park\n|p1bnotes    =\n|p1clinename = T5\n|p1cstop     = services to , Schofields and\n|p1cnotes    =\n|p2alinename = T2\n|p2astop     = services to Leppington\n|p2anotes    =\n|p2blinename = T3\n|p2bstop     = services to Liverpool\n|p2bnotes    =\n|p2clinename = T5\n|p2cstop     = services to weekend services to Liverpool\n|p2cnotes    = }}\nTransport links\nTransit Systems NSW operates one bus route via Warwick Farm station, under contract to Transport for NSW:\n*904: Fairfield station to Liverpool station\nWarwick Farm station is served by one NightRide route:\n*N50: Liverpool station to Town Hall station\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://transportnsw.info/stop?q=10101288#/ Warwick Farm station details] Transport for New South Wales"
