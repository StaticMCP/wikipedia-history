In 1948, he became a Fellow of St John's College, Oxford, where he remained until his death in 2007.\nHe served on several bodies including the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (1963–76), the Historic Buildings Council for England (1970–84), and the Royal Fine Art Commission (1962–72).\nHis Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840 was first published in 1954. Yale University Press produced the third edition in 1995, and he had just completed work on the fourth edition at the time of his death. On publication it was hailed as groundbreaking; it \"changed the face of English architectural history\", according to historian David Watkin.\nThe dictionary only includes buildings where an architect’s name can be linked through documentary evidence, reflecting Colvin’s opposition to stylistic attributions. The prefatory essay, \"The Practice of Architecture, 1600–1840\", analysed both the building trades and the architectural profession, contributing to the wider social history of Britain.\nHe also served as general editor and contributor to the official multi-volume ''The History of the King's Works, published between 1963 and 1982.\nColvin also influenced policy: he chaired the committee of English Heritage responsible for Britain’s built environment, and in 1984 he led a campaign that persuaded Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson to amend the Budget in order to save Calke Abbey for the nation.\nHonours\nColvin was knighted in 1995. He served as president of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain from 1979 to 1981; in 1984, a special issue of its journal Architectural History'' was published in his honour.\nPersonal life\nColvin married Christina Edgeworth Butler, a literary scholar and historian of Oxfordshire, in 1943; they had two sons. She predeceased him in 2003.\nArchive and library\nColvin's research papers and correspondence associated with the Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840 are held in the archives of the Paul Mellon Centre in London.\nPublications\n''The History of the King's Works\n* London: HMSO (1963–1982)\n** Vol. 1–2: The Middle Ages, R.
