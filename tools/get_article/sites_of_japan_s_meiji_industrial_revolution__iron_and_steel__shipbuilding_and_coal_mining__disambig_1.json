In 2009 the monuments were submitted jointly for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List under criteria ii, iii, and iv. The sites were accepted at the 39th UNESCO World Heritage session, under the condition to take measures \"that allow an understanding that there were a large number of Koreans and others who were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions ...\", and again, such measures have yet to be implemented.\nEight areas are registered, with twenty-three component sites:\nArea 1: Hagi in Yamaguchi\nHagi proto-industrial sites and Tokugawa period cultural setting;

There is a research questioning about Japanese government's compliance with UNESCO regulations and requirements with respect to Hashima Coal Mine site.\nAlthough the period at which forced labour took place does not coincide with the period of Meiji industrial revolution, the criticism arose based on the view that the Meiji industrial revolution was \"inseparable from 20th-century empire-building, which led inexorably to Japanese colonialism and the Asia-Pacific War\". South Korea claimed that the official recognition of those sites would \"violate the dignity of the survivors of forced labor as well as the spirit and principles of the UNESCO Convention\", and \"World Heritage sites should be of outstanding universal value and be acceptable by all peoples across the globe.\" China also released a similar statement that \"World Heritage application should live up to the principle and spirit of promoting peace as upheld by UNESCO.\"\nSee also\n* World Heritage Sites in Japan\n* Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5399/ UNESCO Tentative List entry]\n* [http://www.kyuyama.jp/e/index.html The Modern Industrial Heritage Sites in Kyushu and Yamaguchi]\n* [http://www.kyuyama.jp/e/action/teigensyoE.pdf Emergence of Industrial Japan: Kyushu and Yamaguchi]\n* [http://www.kyuyama.jp/ The Modern Industrial Heritage Sites in Kyushu and Yamaguchi]\n* [https://www.ihic.jp/ Industrial Heritage Information Center]"
