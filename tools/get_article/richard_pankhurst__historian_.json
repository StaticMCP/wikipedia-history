He is known for his research on economic history and socio-cultural studies on Ethiopia.\nEarly life and education\nPankhurst was born in 1927 in Woodford Green to left communist and former suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst and Italian anarchist Silvio Corio. His maternal grandparents were Emmeline and Richard Pankhurst.\nPankhurst studied at Chigwell School, Bancroft's School in Woodford, and then at the London School of Economics, from which he received a doctorate in economic history, on which Harold Laski acted as an advisor.\nCareer\nRichard and Rita Pankhurst, [[Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin, Gebre Kristos Desta (at right), with Helen and Alula Pankhurst in front]]\nHis mother, Sylvia Pankhurst, had been an active supporter of Ethiopian culture  and independence since the Italian invasion in 1935, and Richard grew up knowing many Ethiopian refugees. Sylvia was a friend of Haile Selassie and published Ethiopia, a Cultural History in 1955.  In 1956, she and Richard moved to Ethiopia where they were joined by Rita Eldon.
