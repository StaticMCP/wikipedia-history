The ceremonies were held at the Canadian Tire Centre in Kanata and televised on CTV with Bryan Adams and Russell Peters as co-hosts. The duo replaced Michael Bublé, who was originally scheduled to host the show.\nEvents\nVarious events associated with the awards are held in Ottawa from 27 March until the primary awards ceremony at the Canadian Tire Centre on 2 April. This was the last Juno Award Broadcast on CTV, before moving back to CBC in 2018.\nThe Juno Cup charity hockey game was played at TD Place Arena on 31 March. The NHL former players team beat the musicians team with a score of 13-12.\nA Songwriters' Circle event was hosted by Bruce Cockburn on 2 April at the National Arts Centre. Daniel Caesar, Chantal Kreviazuk, Lisa LeBlanc, Colin Linden, Paul Murphy and Donovan Woods performed. CBC Radio broadcast recordings of this event.\nGala dinner\nMost award category winners were announced at a private dinner gala 1 April at the Shaw Centre hosted by musician and CBC Radio host Tom Power. The late Leonard Cohen won the Artist of the Year category; his son Adam accepted the award on his behalf at the gala. The Tragically Hip won Rock Album of the Year for their album Man Machine Poem. Secret Path, the solo album by Tragically Hip lead singer Gord Downie, won Junos in two categories: Adult Alternative Album and Recording Package of the Year. Drake did not win any of his several nominations at the gala and The Weeknd won in only the R&B/Soul Recording category for his Starboy album.\nPrimary ceremony\nThe televised award ceremony on 2 April was hosted by Bryan Adams and Russell Peters. Performers included Arkells, Alessia Cara, Billy Talent, Dallas Smith, July Talk, Ruth B, Sarah McLachlan, Shawn Mendes, The Strumbellas, A Tribe Called Red.\nChanges to host\nCanadian singer Michael Bublé was originally scheduled to host the awards, but had cancelled public appearances due to his son's cancer diagnosis.\nIt was announced on 1 November 2016 that the singer would return to host of the 2017 ceremony after playing emcee in 2013. Three days later, on 3 November, Bublé made public that he would be suspending professional activities to focus on his son's treatment. At that time it was uncertain whether he would still host the Junos or its British counterpart, the Brits.\nBell Media president Randy Lennox said in an interview with The Canadian Press that initial discussions with Russell Peters began in early November when the comedian offered to take the hosting gig if Bublé needed someone else to step in. Shortly after Bublé opted to forgo the Brit Awards hosting plans, singer Adams also began talking with Juno organizers about taking a role in the Canadian broadcast.\nOn 9 March 2017, the Juno Awards announced that Bublé would be replaced by Adams and Peters.\nIndigenous introduction\nThe telecast began with a sketch introducing the co-hosts prior to taking the stage. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared in this segment, phoning Adams to request a performance of  \"Summer of '69\".\nBuffy Sainte-Marie appeared on stage at the Canadian Tire to declare that the event was held on traditional Algonquin territory. She then introduced A Tribe Called Red who performed music from their album We are the Halluci Nation accompanied by throat singer Tanya Tagaq.\nLeonard Cohen tribute\nFormer Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau paid tribute to musician Leonard Cohen who died in November 2016. Feist then sang Cohen's song \"Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye\", accompanied only by her acoustic guitar and singers Ariel Engle and Daniela Gesundheit of Hydra.  Cohen's album You Want it Darker was later awarded a Juno for Album of the Year. He won the Artist of the Year category during the previous night's gala.\nMcLachlan joins Hall of Fame\nCanadian singer Sarah McLachlan was this year's inductee to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. A video montage featuring of her career began with a tribute from former American president Bill Clinton. Sheryl Crow, Josh Groban, Diana Krall, James Taylor and Tegan and Sara also provided statements in honour of McLachlan's career.\nMcLachlan took the stage to make an acceptance speech which noted the presence and importance of diversity, politeness and the arts in Canadian society, declaring that \"[w]e Canadians, we're far from perfect, but we have a lot to offer the world and we have to continue to set the bar high.\" while expressing gratitude to those who supported her career.\nPeters controversy\nDuring the ceremony broadcast, co-host Russell Peters spotted some young women in the audience and remarked \"Look at all the young girls. This is a felony waiting to happen.\" Furthermore, when announcing that Minister of Canadian Heritage Mélanie Joly was co-presenting the Breakthrough Artist of the Year Award with musician Coleman Hell, Russell added  \"I don't know why, but she's hot, so who cares?\" The following day, Joly declared that Peters' comments were not appropriate, indicating a need to ensure \"that all our role models are supporting the importance of gender parity.\" Allan Reid, president of CARAS and the Juno Awards, issued an apology and distanced the Juno Awards organization from Peters' statements.\nNominees and winners\nCategory nominees were announced on 7 February 2017.\nBuffy Sainte-Marie is the 2017 recipient of the Allan Waters Humanitarian Award. It was revoked in 2025 over citizenship requirements.\nRandy Lennox is the year's recipient of the Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award. Sarah McLachlan is the 2017 Canadian Music Hall of Fame inductee.\nThe category for Aboriginal Album of the Year was renamed to Indigenous Music Album of the Year as of the 2017 awards. The first 34 awards were announced on 1 April 2017.\nPeople\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50%\"  | Artist of the Year\n! style=\"width:50%\" | Group of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"  |\n*  Leonard Cohen\n** Alessia Cara\n** Drake\n** Shawn Mendes\n** The Weeknd\n| valign=\"top\"  |\n*  The Tragically Hip\n** Arkells\n** Billy Talent\n** Tegan and Sara\n** The Strumbellas\n|-\n! style=\"width:50%\"  | Breakthrough Artist of the Year\n! style=\"width:50%\" | Breakthrough Group of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"  |\n*  Ruth B\n** Kaytranada\n** Tory Lanez\n** Andy Shauf\n** Jazz Cartier\n| valign=\"top\"  |\n*  The Dirty Nil\n** Bleeker\n** Cold Creek County\n** Bob Moses\n** The Zolas\n|-\n! style=\"width:50%\"  | Fan Choice Award\n! style=\"width:50%\"  | Songwriter of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"  |\n*  Shawn Mendes\n**  Alessia Cara\n**  Belly\n**  Drake\n**  Hedley\n**  Justin Bieber\n**  Ruth B\n**  The Strumbellas\n**  The Weeknd\n**  Tory Lanez\n| valign=\"top\"  |\n*  Gord Downie - \"The Stranger\", \"The Only Place To Be\", \"Son\" from Secret Path by Gord Downie\n** Donovan Woods - \"Leaving Nashville\" (co-songwriter Abe Stoklasa) from The Driver by Charles Kelley; \"What Kind of Love is That\" , \"They Don't Make Anything in That Town\" from ''Hard Settle, Ain't Troubled by Donovan Woods\n** Tegan Quin and Sara Quin - \"Boyfriend\" , \"100x\" , \"Stop Desire\" from Love You to Death by Tegan and Sara\n** Leonard Cohen - \"You Want It Darker\", \"It Seemed the Better Way\", \"Traveling Light\" from You Want It Darker by Leonard Cohen\n** Ruth Berhe - \"Lost Boy\", \"Superficial Love\", \"2 Poor Kids\" from The Intro by Ruth B\n|-\n! style=\"width:50%\" | Producer of the Year\n! style=\"width:50%\" | Recording Engineer of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  A Tribe Called Red - \"R.E.D.\" feat.
