Its council is based in the town of King's Lynn. The district also includes the towns of Downham Market and Hunstanton, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. The population of the district at the 2021 census was 154,325.\nPart of the borough lies within the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The borough lies on the coast, facing both The Wash to the west and the North Sea to the north. The neighbouring districts are North Norfolk, Breckland, West Suffolk, East Cambridgeshire, Fenland and South Holland.\nHistory\nThe district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering seven former districts which were all abolished at the same time:\n*Docking Rural District\n*Downham Market Urban District\n*Downham Rural District\n*Freebridge Lynn Rural District\n*Hunstanton Urban District\n*King's Lynn Municipal Borough\n*Marshland Rural District\nThe new district was initially named \"West Norfolk\" reflecting its position in the wider county. The district was awarded borough status on 30 January 1981, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor. The name of the borough was changed later that year, becoming \"King's Lynn and West Norfolk\" with effect from 14 May 1981.\nGovernance\n| leader2_type       = Leader\n| leader2            = Alistair Beales\n| party2             = Independent\n| election2          = 16 May 2024\n| leader3_type       = Chief Executive\n| leader3            = Kate Blakemore\n| party3             =\n| election3          = 17 June 2024\n| members            = 55 councillors\n| structure1         =\n| structure1_res     = 200px\n| political_groups1  =\n;Administration (20)\n:|border=darkgray}} Independent (16)\n:|border=darkgray}} Liberal Democrats (3)}}\n:|border=darkgray}} Green (1)\n;Other parties (35)\n:|border=darkgray}} Conservative (19)\n:|border=darkgray}} Labour (8)\n:|border=darkgray}} Reform UK (2)\n:|border=darkgray}} Independent (6)}}\n| last_election1     = 4 May 2023\n| next_election2     = 6 May 2027\n| session_room       = Kings Lynn Guild Hall (geograph 4626827).jpg\n| session_res        =\n| meeting_place      = Town Hall, Saturday Market Place, King's Lynn, PE305DQ\n| website            =\n| footnotes          =\n}}\nThe Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Norfolk County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.\nPolitical control\nThe council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a coalition of most of the independent councillors, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens with informal support from Labour.\nThe first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Party in control!!Years\n|-\n|  || 1974–1976\n|-\n|  || 1976–1991\n|-\n|  || 1991–1995\n|-\n|  || 1995–1999\n|-\n|  || 1999–2003\n|-\n|  || 2003–2023\n|-\n|  || 2023–present\n|}\nLeadership\nThe role of mayor is largely ceremonial in King's Lynn and West Norfolk, with political leadership instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2007 have been:\n{| class=wikitable\n! Councillor !! colspan=2|Party !! From !!

Another two form the 'Progressive Group', and the other four do not belong to a group. The next election is due in 2027.\nElections\nSince the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 55 councillors representing 35 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.\n;UK Youth Parliament\nAlthough the UK Youth Parliament is an apolitical organisation, the elections are run in a way similar to that of the Local Elections. The votes come from 11 to 18 year olds and are combined to make the decision of the next, 2 year Member of Youth Parliament. The elections are run at different times across the country with King's Lynn and West Norfolk's typically being in early Spring and bi-annually.\nPremises\nThe council generally meets at the Town Hall on the Saturday Market Place in King's Lynn, parts of which date back to the 1420s, having replaced an earlier guildhall on the site which burnt down in 1421. The council's main offices are at King's Court, on Chapel Street in King's Lynn, which had been built as speculative offices in 1975, initially being called Aspen House. The council bought the building in 1981.\nGeography\n, one of the coastal towns on the Norfolk Coast.]]\nThe district comprises the urban area of King's Lynn itself, together with 102 surrounding parishes. At the time of the 2001 census, the district had an area of 1,473&nbsp;km2, of which 28&nbsp;km2 was in the urban area and 1,445&nbsp;km2 in the surrounding parishes. The district had a population of 135,345 in 58,338 households, with 34,564 in 15,285 households living in the urban area, whilst 100,781 people in 43,053 households lived in the surrounding parishes.\nTowns and parishes\nThe main part of the urban area of King's Lynn (roughly corresponding to the pre-1974 borough of King's Lynn) is an unparished area. The remainder of the district is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Downham Market and Hunstanton have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style \"town council\". The parishes are:\n*Anmer\n*Bagthorpe with Barmer\n*Barton Bendish\n*Barwick\n*Bawsey\n*Bircham\n*Boughton\n*Brancaster\n*Burnham Market\n*Burnham Norton\n*Burnham Overy\n*Burnham Thorpe\n*Castle Acre\n*Castle Rising\n*Choseley\n*Clenchwarton\n*Congham\n*Crimplesham\n*Denver\n*Dersingham\n*Docking\n*Downham Market\n*Downham West\n*East Rudham\n*East Walton\n*East Winch\n*Emneth\n*Feltwell\n*Fincham\n*Flitcham with Appleton\n*Fordham\n*Fring\n*Gayton\n*Great Massingham\n*Grimston\n*Harpley\n*Heacham\n*Hilgay\n*Hillington\n*Hockwold cum Wilton\n*Holme next the Sea\n*Houghton\n*Hunstanton\n*Ingoldisthorpe\n*Leziate\n*Little Massingham\n*Marham\n*Marshland St. James\n*Methwold\n*Middleton\n*Nordelph\n*North Creake\n*North Runcton\n*Northwold\n*North Wootton\n*Old Hunstanton\n*Outwell\n*Pentney\n*Ringstead\n*Roydon\n*Runcton Holme\n*Ryston\n*Sandringham\n*Sedgeford\n*Shernborne\n*Shouldham\n*Shouldham Thorpe\n*Snettisham\n*South Creake\n*Southery\n*South Wootton\n*Stanhoe\n*Stoke Ferry\n*Stow Bardolph\n*Stradsett\n*Syderstone\n*Terrington St. Clement\n*Terrington St. John\n*Thornham\n*Tilney All Saints\n*Tilney St. Lawrence\n*Titchwell\n*Tottenhill\n*Upwell\n*Walpole\n*Walpole Cross Keys\n*Walpole Highway\n*Walsoken\n*Watlington\n*Welney\n*Wereham\n*West Acre\n*West Dereham\n*West Rudham\n*West Walton\n*West Winch\n*Wiggenhall St. Germans\n*Wiggenhall St. Mary Magdalen\n*Wimbotsham\n*Wormegay\n*Wretton\nArms\n|badge = A sea lion Or within a garland of oakleaves fructed Proper.}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk Official Website]\n*[http://www.westnorfolk.info West Norfolk Information]"
