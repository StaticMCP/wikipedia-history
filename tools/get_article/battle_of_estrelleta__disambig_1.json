The invaders captured two towns on the Plateau du Centre and established a bastion at Cachimán. Haitian President Jean-Louis Pierrot quickly mobilized his army and counter-attacked on July 22, driving the invaders from Cachimán and back across the frontier. On August 6, Pierrot ordered his army to invade the Dominican Republic.\nBattle\nOn September 17, 1845, the Dominicans defeated the Haitian vanguard near the frontier at Estrelleta where the Dominican \"square\" repulsed, with the use of bayonets, a Haitian cavalry charge.\nAftermath\nOn September 27, 1845, Dominican Gen. Francisco Antonio Salcedo defeated a Haitian army at the battle of \"Beler,\" a frontier fortification. Salcedo was supported by Adm. Juan Bautista Cambiaso's squadron of three schooners, which blockaded the Haitian port of Cap-Haïtien.
