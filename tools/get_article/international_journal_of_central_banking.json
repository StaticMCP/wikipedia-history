In July 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank, and each of the Group of Ten (G-10) central banks announced their plans to support the development of a new publication focused on central bank theory and practice. Other central banks were invited to participate in this joint project, and there are now some 50 sponsoring institutions.\nThe primary objectives of the IJCB are to widely disseminate the best policy-relevant and applied research on central banking and to promote communication among researchers both inside and outside of central banks.\nFederal Reserve Vice Chairman Roger W. Ferguson Jr. first proposed the idea of such a journal and discussed the concept with several BIS colleagues and with Federal Reserve Board Governor Ben S. Bernanke, who served as the initial managing editor. John B. Taylor, Professor of Economics at Stanford University, was appointed managing editor in September 2005. Frank Smets of the European Central Bank became managing editor in January 2008. John Williams of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco took over as managing editor in January 2011. Loretta J. Mester of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland took over as managing editor in June 2016. Luc Laeven of the European Central Bank became managing editor in January 2020. Bank of England Chief Economist Charlie Bean strongly supported the project, and the journal's governing body, comprising representatives from the sponsoring institutions, was established. The current managing editor is Christopher J. Waller, from the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System.\nRetraction Watch reports that the journal has been victim of hijacking, with the imposter website setup at https://ijocb.org/.\nAbstracting and indexing\nThe journal is indexed and abstracted in the following bibliographic databases:\nAccording to Scopus, the journal has a 2024 CiteScore of 2.3, ranking 172th out of 317 journal in the category \"Finance\".\nAccording to Raphael Auer, Giulio Cornelli and Christian Zimmermann, the journal is the most influential journal of economics published by policy institutions, followed by BIS Quarterly Review and IMF Economic Review.\nAnnual conference\nThe journal organizes the Annual IJCB Research Conference, which focuses on a difference theme every year.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
