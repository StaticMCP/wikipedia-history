The flag has four horizontal stripes. From top to bottom, the stripes are light blue (3/4 of the flag's width), white (1/16), red (1/16), and green (1/8). The flag has been used officially as the flag of the Sakha Republic since 14 October 1992.  The light blue stripe is charged with a white disc in the center.

After 1937, the flag of the Yakut ASSR was based on the flag of the Russian SFSR, modified with inscriptions.\nSymbolism\nThe disc represents the northern sun. The light blue, white, and green colors stand for the sky, snow, and taiga landscape respectively. The red symbolizes the courage and constancy of the people.

The flag was a red flag, with a blue canton in the top left of the flag on which the northern lights was depicted with the inscription in golden letters \"ЯАССР\" in the Yakut language.\nThe flag of the Yakut ASSR was described in the 1937 Constitution of the Yakut ASSR, which was adopted by the Central Executive Committee of the Yakut ASSR on 9 March 1937, at the 9th Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the Yakut ASSR. The flag became that of the Russian SFSR save for an added inscription naming the Yakut ASSR.
