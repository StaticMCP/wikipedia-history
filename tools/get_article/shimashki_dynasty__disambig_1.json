A list of twelve kings of Shimashki is found in the Elamite king-list of Susa, which also contains a list of kings of Awan dynasty. It is uncertain how historically accurate the list is (and whether it reflects a chronological order), although some of its kings can be corroborated by their appearance in the records of neighboring peoples. The dynasty corresponds to the second Paleo-Elamite period (dated to ). It was followed by the Sukkalmah dynasty. Shimashki was likely near today's Masjed Soleyman.\nHistory\nGutian period (c. 2154 – c. 2112 BC)\nShimashki is first mentioned on the inscription to an image of Puzur-Inshushinak, king of Awan around 2100 BC, which depicts a Shimashkian king as subordinate to him. A royal inscription recorded \"in a single day he made (those lands) fall prostrate at his feet; and, when the king of  Šimaški came up (on learning about it), he seized the feet of  PuzurInšušinak (in submission)\".\nDaryaee suggests that, despite the impression from the king-list that the rulers of Shimashki was a dynasty of sequential rulers, it is perhaps better to think of Shimashki as an alliance of various peoples \"rather than a unitary state.\"\nUr III period (c. 2112 – c. 2004 BC)\nThe names in the king-list, as found in Potts, are \"Girnamme, Tazitta, Ebarti, Tazitta, Lu[?]-[x-x-x]-lu-uh-ha-an, Kindattu, Idaddu, Tan-Ruhurater, Ebarti, Idaddu, Idaddu-napir, Idaddu-temti, twelve Sumerian kings\" (bracketed letters original). An inscription\nestablishes Idattu I was the son of Kindattu and the grandson of Ebarat (Yabrat/Ebarti) I.\nGirnamme ruled at the same time as Shu-Sin, king of Ur, and was involved, as either a groom or simply a facilitator, in the marriage of Shu-Sin's daughter. Gwendolyn Leick places this event in 2037 BC. Girnamme, along with Tazitta and Ebarti I, appears in \"Mesopotamian texts establishing food rations issued to messengers,\" texts from 2044 to 2032 BC.\nTazitta, the second figure in the list, is referred to in a document from the eighth year of the reign of Amar-Sin of Ur.\nEbarat I (Old Elamite ia-ab-ra-at), king number 3 in the Shimashki kings list (SKL).  He is mentioned in several documents of Third Dynasty of Ur, from year 44 of Šulgi  (the earliest) to year 8 of Šu-Sin. Documents   show that he ruled at about the same time as Girnamme and at the same time as Tazitta, kings #1 and #2 from the SKL. The inscription on bronze bowl MS 4476 mentions Ebarat (de-ba-ra-at) as a father of Kindattu and grandfather of Idadu I, kings no 6 and 7 in the SKL. The spelling ia-a-ba-ra-at later became e-ba-ra-at and e-ba-ar-ti reflecting the historic shift of /’a/ to /e/ in Elamite.\nThe Shimashki confederacy led an alliance against the Ur III Empire, and managed to defeat its last ruler Ibbi-Sin. After this victory, they destroyed the kingdom, looted the capital of Ur, and ruled through military occupation for the next 21 years.\nKindattu was also known as Kindadu. A Kindattu, who according to Daryaeee was \"apparently\" the Shimashkian king of the list above, lead the army that destroyed the Third Dynasty of Ur in 2004 BC.  The operation was a joint effort between Kindattu and his then-ally Ishbi-Erra, who defeated Ur and captured Ibbi-Sin, its king. The Ishbi-Erra hymn claims that Ishbi-Erra later expelled Kindattu from Mesopotamia.\nIsin-Larsa period (c. 2004 to c. 1763 BC)\nIdaddu I (also known as Indattu-Inshushinak, or simply Indattu) called himself \"king of Shimashki and Elam\". According to Stolper and André-Salvini, he was the son of Kindattu, while Gwendolyn Leick calls him \"son of Pepi,\" claiming that Kindattu may have been his grandfather. According to Leick he ascended to the throne of Shimashki around 1970 BC.\nTan-Ruhurater, also known as Tan-Ruhuratir, formed an alliance with Bilalama, the governor of Eshnunna, by marrying Bilama's daughter Mê-Kubi.\nEbarti II of Shimashki may have been the same individual known as Ebarat, a Sukkalmah, or \"Grand Regent\". If so, he was ruler simultaneously to the next member of the list of twelve Shimaskin kings: Idaddu II.\nIdaddu II was the son of Tan-Ruhurater, during whose reign he oversaw building projects as the governor of Susa. According to Leick, he was the last of the Shimashkian kings.\nThe Shimashki rulers became participants in an ongoing conflict with the rulers of Isin and Larsa after the fall of Third Dynasty of Ur.\nUnder the Shimashki and their successors the Sukkalmah, Elam then became one of the most powerful kingdoms of West Asia, influencing the territories of Mesopotamia and Syria through commercial, military or diplomatic contacts. Expansion in Mesopotamia was only halted by the Babylonian king Hammurabi in the 18th century BC. After a prolonged conflict, the military forces of Elam were finally forced to retreat their forces positioned along the Tigris river, and to return to Susa.\nThe Shimashki dynasty was followed by the Sukkalmah dynasty (c. 1900–1500).\nList of rulers\nThe following list should not be considered complete:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"border=\"1\"style=\"width:100%;text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=\"1%\"|#\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Portrait\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Name\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Succession\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Title\n!width=\"16.5%\"| dates\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Notes\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Gutian period ()\n|-\n|\n|\n|Unknown\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Shimashki\n|Uncertain, }}}}\n|\n*temp. of Puzur-Inshushinak\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|Awan dynasty ()\n|-\n|12th\n|\n|Puzur-Inshushinak𒅤𒊭𒀭𒈹𒂞\n|Nephew of Khita (?)\n|Military Governor of Elam\nGovernor of Susa\nMighty King of Elam\nKing of Awan\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n*temp. of Puzer-Mama\n*temp. of Gudea\n*temp. of Ur-Nammu\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"left\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Ur III period ()\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|Shimashki dynasty ()\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=\"6\"|\n|Girnamme I (?)\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Shimashki\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ebarat I (?)𒂊𒁀𒊏𒀜\n|Relative of Gir-Namme I (?)\n|King of Shimashki\n|\n|-\n|1st\n|Girnamme II\n|Relative of Ebarat I (?)\n|King of Shimashki\n|\n*temp. of Shulgi\n|-\n|3rd\n|Ebarat II𒂊𒁀𒊏𒀜\n|Relative of Tazitta I\n|King of Shimashki\n|\n*temp. of Shulgi\n|-\n|2nd\n|Tazitta I\n|Relative of Gir-Namme I (?)\n|King of Shimashki\n|\n*temp. of Amar-Sin\n|-\n|4th\n|Tazitta II\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Shimashki\n|\n*temp. of Shu-Sin\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Isin-Larsa period ()\n|-\n|6th\n|\n|Kindattu𒆠𒅔𒁕𒌅\n|Son of Ebarat I (?)\n|King of Shimashki\n|Uncertain, }}(26 years)\n|\n*Conquered Ur\n*temp. of Ishbi-Erra\n|-\n|\n|\n|Imazu\n|Son of Kindattu\n|King of Anshan\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n*temp. of Shu-Ilishu\n|-\n|5th\n|rowspan=\"6\"|\n|Lurak-Luhhan\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Shimashki\n|\n|\n*temp. of Shu-Sin\n|-\n|\n|Tan-Ruhuratir I (?)\n|Same person as Lurak-Luhhan (?)\n|King of Shimashki\n|\n|\n*temp. of Shu-Sin\n|-\n|\n|Hutran-Temti I (?)\n|Same person as Kindattu (?)\n|King of Shimashki\n|\n|\n*temp. of Shu-Sin\n|-\n|7th\n|Indattu-Inshushinak I𒀭𒄿𒁕𒁺\n|Son of Hutran-Temti I (?)\n|King of Shimashki\n|Uncertain,\n|\n*temp. of Ibbi-Sin\n|-\n|8th\n|Tan-Ruhuratir II\n|Son of Indattu-Inshushinak I (?)\n|King of Shimashki\n|Uncertain,\n|\n*temp. of Iddin-Dagan\n|-\n|\n|Indattu-Inshushinak II (?)\n|Son of Tan-Ruhuratir I (?)\n|King of Shimashki\n|\n|\n*temp. of Bilalama\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|Epartid dynasty ()\n|-\n|9th\n|\n|Ebarat III𒂊𒁀𒊏𒀜\n|Unclear succession\n|Sukkalmah\nKing of Anshan and Susa\nKing of Shimashki\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n*temp. of Iddin-Dagan\n|-\n|10th\n|\n|Indattu-Inshushinak III𒀭𒄿𒁕𒁺\n|Son of Pepi\n|King of Shimashki\n|Uncertain, (≥3 years)\n|\n*temp. of Gungunum\n|-\n|\n|\n|Shilhaha\n|Son of Ebarat II\n|Sukkalmah\nKing of Anshan and Susa\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Kuk-Nashur I\n|Son of Shilhaha\n|Sukkalmah\n|\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|Sukkalmah dynasty ()\n|-\n|\n|\n|Palar-Ishshan\n|Unclear succession\n|Sukkalmah\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Kuk-Sanit\n|Son of Palar-Ishshan (?)\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Lankuku\n|Father of Kuk-Kirwash\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Kuk-Kirwash\n|Nephew of Palar-Ishshan (?)\n|Sukkalmah\nSukkal of Elam and Shimashki and Susa\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Tem-Sanit\n|Son of Kuk-Kirwash\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Kuk-Nahhunte\n|Son of Kuk-Kirwash\n|\n|\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Old Babylonian period ()\n|-\n|\n|\n|Attakhushu\n|Son of Kuk-Nashur I (?)\n|Sukkal and Ippir of Susa\nShepherd of the people of Susa\nShepherd of Inshushinak\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Tetep-Mada\n|Son of Kuk-Nashur I (?)\n|Shepherd of the people of Susa\n|\n|-\n|11th\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|Idattunapir\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Shimashki\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Uncertain, }}\n|\n*temp. of Sumuabum\n|-\n|12th\n|Idattutemti\n|Unclear succession\n|King of Shimashki\n|\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"left\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Shirukduh\n|Descendant of Shilhaha (?)\n|Sukkalmah\n|Uncertain, }}\n|\n*temp. of Shamshi-Adad I\n|-\n|\n|\n|Siwe-Palar-Khuppak\n|Son of Shirukduh (?)\n|Sukkalmah\nSukkal of Susa\nPrince of Elam\n|Uncertain,\n|\n*temp. of Hammurabi\n|-\n|\n|\n|Tan-Uli\n|Unclear succession\n|Sukkalmah\nSukkal\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Uncertain, }}\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Temti-Halki\n|Son of Tan-Uli (?)\n|Sukkalmah\nSukkal of Elam and Simashki and Susa\n|\n|}\nGallery\nFile:Dynastic list Awan Siwashi Louvre Sb17729.jpg|The Susanian Dynastic List—a regnal list dated to  and provenanced at Susa.
