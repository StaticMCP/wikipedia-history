He uses a middle voice, quiet yet public, as if talking to a small groups of friends and admirers.\" And concludes: \"These poems, with their charm and compactness, make a cogent argument against the charge that all modern verse is obscure.\"\nIn The Age, in a combined review of seven poetry collections, Dennis Douglas opines that this collection places \"the poet as a mediator between the reader and the world of phenomenal objects...The incursions of phenomena are precariously held at bay in Mr. Hart-Smith's collection by the lightness of tone in his work and the use of the poet as observer.\"\nAwards\n* 1966 – Grace Leven Prize for Poetry winner\nSee also\n* 1966 in Australian literature\n* 1966 in poetry\nReferences"
