      "text": "# The Free Software Definition\n\nThe Free Software Definition is a policy document written by Richard Stallman and published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). It defines free software as software that grants users the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software. The term \"free\" is used in the sense of \"free speech\", not \"free of charge\".\nThe earliest known publication of the definition appeared in the February 1986 edition of the now-discontinued ''GNU's Bulletin'' published by the FSF. Since 1996, the official version of the document has been maintained in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. , the definition had seen 27 major revisions since it was originally published online and it had been translated into 65 languages. The FSF also publishes a list of licenses that meet this definition.\nThe Four Essential Freedoms\nThe definition published by the FSF in 1986 originally listed two key points:\nIn 1996, when the GNU Project website was launched, the definition was expanded to include \"three levels of freedom\", explicitly adding the freedom to study the software (which had been implied in the original). Stallman later discouraged describing them as \"levels,\" noting that all freedoms are equally essential.\nA fourth freedom was later introduced to explicitly affirm the user's right to run the program. Because it was seen as more fundamental than the others, it was placed first. Since the existing freedoms were numbered one through three, this new one was designated \"freedom zero\". Such zero-based numbering, where counting begins at zero, is also a common convention in computer programming.\nThe modern definition states that a program is free software if it grants users the following four essential freedoms:\nFreedoms 1 and 3 require source code to be available, as studying and modifying software without source code is impractical.\nLater definitions\nIn July 1997, Bruce Perens published the Debian Free Software Guidelines. A definition based on the DFSG was later adopted by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) under the name The Open Source Definition.\nComparison with the Open Source Definition\nDespite philosophical differences between the free software movement and the open-source movement, the FSF's definition of free software and the OSI's definition of open-source software describe largely overlapping sets of licenses, with only a few minor differences. While emphasizing these philosophical distinctions, the FSF states:\n}}\nSee also\n* Free software movement (FSM)\n* The GNU Manifesto\n* Definition of Free Cultural Works\n* Debian Free Software Guidelines\n* The Open Source Definition\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html The Free Software Definition]"
