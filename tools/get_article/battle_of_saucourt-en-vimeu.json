After taking Kortrijk in November 880, they raided Arras and Cambrai in December. Later in 881, they sacked Amiens and Corbie.\nBattle\nLouis and Carloman were victorious, in what must have been a rare pitched battle, against the northern raiders in which some 9,000 Vikings were slain according to the Annals of Fulda. The battle is celebrated in the Old High German poem Ludwigslied.\nDespite winning the battle, Louis was unable to take advantage of this victory since he would die in an accident in 882. The battle of Saucourt did nothing to stop Viking raids, who switched to raiding Lotharingia.\nSee also\n*Carolingian Empire\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
