It is found in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and probably in Tajikistan.\nPopulation\nPseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni population is recorded to be a rare species. There are few recordings of this species being caught, but there are accusations that fishermen are unknowingly catching them. The population trend of this species is decreasing. Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni is being negatively affected due to dams, poaching, water extraction, irrigation, and high levels of water pollution including mineral fertilizers, pesticides for cotton agriculture, and drainage waste. More survey work on this species is needed to determine the status of their population. Overall this species is recorded to be a critically endangered species.\nDiet\nPseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni has a diet of small aquatic invertebrates.\nDistribution\nPseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni is endemic to the Amu Darya river basin in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and might also occur in Tajikistan. It formerly occurred up to the Aral Sea.\nIdentification\nPseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni has been recorded reaching a maximum length of 27 centimeters or 10.63 inches. The maximum reported weight of this species is 51 grams or 0.11 pounds. The oldest reported age of this species is six years old. This species is considered to be potamodromous. This species is also recorded to be sensitive to chemicals in the water. One of the specific features of Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni is the crease on the external edge of the pectoral fin.\nEnvironment\nPseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni is recorded to live in freshwater or slightly salty environments within a demersal depth range. This species lives in a temperate climate.\nCommon names\nThe common names of Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni in various languages include the following:\n*Dwarf Sturgeon : English\n*Little shovelnose sturgeon : English\n*Little Amu-Darya shovelnose : English\n*Lopatonos hermannův : Czech (česky)\n*Nibylopstons amu-daryjski : Polish (polski)\n*Pikkulapiosampi : Finnish (suomen kieli)\n*Амударьинский малый лопатонос : Russian (русский язык)\n*Лжелопатонос амударьинский малый : Russian (русский язык)\n*短尾拟铲鲟 : Mandarin Chinese\n*短尾擬鏟鱘 : Mandarin Chinese\n*난쟁이철갑상어 : Korean\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\n* [http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?ID=8764 Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni] at FishBase\n* Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni  - photos at FishBase: http://www.fishbase.us/photos/ThumbnailsSummary.php?ID=8764\n* Video of Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni and the both forms of Pseudoscaphirhynchus kaufmanni in one pool for comparison (in Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni the crease on the external edge of pectoral fin is well seen) - the lower stream of Amu Darya River (Khorezm Province, Uzbekistan):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lio_vxQ7yG8&t=2s\n* Pseudoscaphirhynchus of Amu Darya River including Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni in the lower stream of Amu Darya (Uzbekistan) with photos and videos of the fish: http://life-on-earth.ru/amu-darya-and-syr-darya-shovelnose-sturgeons/amu-darya-shovelnose-sturgeons-conservation-uzbekistan\n* Pseudoscaphirhynchus of Amu Darya River including Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni in the middle straem of Amu Darya (Turkmenistan) with photos of the fish: http://life-on-earth.ru/sokhranenie-bioraznoobraziya/amudarinskie-lopatonosy-turkmenistan\n* L.
