The chili is best appreciated not in a bowl, as one would with the chunkier, \"Tex-Mex\" chili, but rather, as a sauce to cover a plate of spaghetti, covered in shredded cheddar cheese (3-way), the latter with onions or beans (4-way) or with both (as a 5-way), all topped off with oyster crackers and to some, hot sauce.  It can also be placed on top of a hot dog in a steamed bun with mustard and onions, and topped with cheddar cheese (referred to as a cheese coney).\nFindlay Market\nFindlay Market is the oldest continuously operated public market in the state of Ohio.\nGoetta\nGoetta is a meat-and-grain sausage or mush of German inspiration that is popular in the greater Cincinnati area.
