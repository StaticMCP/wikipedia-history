It is based upon David Holthouse's Westword newspaper article, where Holthouse wrote about how he had once planned to kill his childhood rapist. Potter chose to adapt the play after listening to Holthouse's story on a This American Life podcast, and the play had its world premiere at the North Carolina Stage Company in September 2013. An off-Broadway production ran from September 29, 2014 until November 9, 2014 at New World Stages. A new production of the play opened in London on July 11, 2016. The play made its Australian premiere at the historic Old Fitzroy Theatre in Sydney on May 23, 2018. The play received an Outer Critics Circle Award nomination off-Broadway, and three off-West End Award nominations in London, including best production.\nSynopsis\nWhen he was seven, David Holthouse was raped by a 17-year-old acquaintance whom he knew through friends of his parents. The teenager threatened to kill him if he did not comply with his wishes, and after he was finished, David was threatened with violence if he did not keep quiet. Twenty-five years later, David can no longer remain silent when he learns that the man who destroyed his childhood has moved into his new neighborhood. With key ties to the leader of an Arizona gang and other illicit connections, David meticulously plans the murder of the Bogeyman.\nFeature story: [https://www.audreyjournal.com.au/arts/stalking-the-bogeyman-vengeance-or-healing/ STALKING THE BOGEYMAN: VENGEANCE OR HEALING?]\nProductions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is an incredibly important story that needs to be heard.\" - BroadwayWorld\n\"When theatre bites down hard on a subject like this you, too, are caught in its teeth.\" - The Sydney Morning Herald\n“…this is gut punch theatre by stealth…Stalking The Bogeyman is an important, relevant story to tell.  Unfortunately, not a rare story….But the truth telling mustn’t stop and at this time, in this intimate space, with this cast, this production bears witness with humanity and authority. – Sydney Arts Guide\nA very involving piece of theatre that leaves you thinking and feeling a little raw from the sexual trauma that so many in our society experience. Played with heartfelt naturalism and honesty by Graeme McRae, this is the true story of David Holthouse. Stalking the Bogeyman is told in such a way that you are responding moment by moment to the life of David in his reliving of the experience and him trying to come to terms with his abuse. We the audience feel his horror, his fear, his wanting it to all go away, his awareness of other bogeymen in society, his desire for revenge, his desire to self-destruct, and his secrecy of the rape to the people closest in his life in order to protect them. – The Buzz from Sydney\nHolthouse, alongside playwright Markus Potter, has created a complex, compelling piece of storytelling that could so easily have been one-dimensional and all about revenge. But there are so many other important layers to the script. They have managed to articulate all of the conflicting emotions of betrayal, pain, revenge and fear in a distinctly human way. – Theatre Now\nIt is an engaging production, keeping things concise and clear. Ideas in Stalking The Bogeyman are simple, and powerfully conveyed on this stage. Leading man Graeme McRae’s vulnerability as David is a vital component, that preserves our empathy comprehensively, through every step of the proceedings. The eponymous bogeyman is played by Radek Jonak, whose portrayal of malevolence is as impressive as the electrifying energy he introduces with each appearance. – Suzy Go See\nStalking the Bogeyman is a gripping story that is both stomach-turning and shocking as it is hard to fathom that this not just a playwright's imagination but is a real story. The work retains the truth and honesty without overacting so that the impact of the work is fully felt, and the weight of the content is clear. It is an incredibly important story that needs to be heard so that people protect the innocent.. – Broadway World\nWhat you get in Stalking the Bogeyman is the raw emotion imparted from the victim… It’s a very moving, very personal and powerful account and Graeme McRae as a wounded but empathetic David holds our attention from that opening line to the very last line. The ensemble cast are uniformly excellent and the whole production, is tight and compelling. This is a difficult story and a confronting production with a subtle approach to trauma and masculinity that I haven’t seen on a Sydney stage before. – Night Writes\nNORTH CAROLINA\nCritical reception for the North Carolina performance was positive and the Citizen-Times praised the play's cast.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* Adapted by/co-conceived play - [http://www.markuspotter.com/ MarkusPotter]\n* Original story by/co-wrote play - [http://www.davidholthouse.com/ David Holthouse]"
