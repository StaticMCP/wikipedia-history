The winner of this election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2037. Voters in each state and the District of Columbia will choose electors to the Electoral College, who will then elect a president and vice president for a term of four years.\nThe presidential election will take place at the same time as elections for the U.S. Senate, House, gubernatorial, and state legislatures.\nElectoral system\nThe president and vice president of the United States are elected through the Electoral College, a group of 538 presidential electors who convene to vote for the president and vice president. The number of electors in the Electoral College is determined through the total number of senators and representatives with an additional three representatives for Washington, D.C.. Electors cast votes for the president and vice president; the winner is elected through a majority of 270 votes. If the election ends in a tie, a contingent election occurs, in which the House of Representatives votes on the president and the Senate votes on the vice president. Forty-eight states use a winner-take-all system in which states award all of their electors to the winner of the popular vote. In Maine and Nebraska, two votes are allocated to the winner of the popular vote, while each of the individual congressional districts have one vote. Electoral votes are certified by state electors in December and by Congress on January 6.\nPresidential candidates are selected in a presidential primary, conducted through primary elections or caucuses. The results of primary elections, ran by state governments, and caucuses, ran by state parties, bind convention delegates to candidates. The Democratic Party mandates a proportional allocation if a candidate receives at least fifteen percent in a given congressional district, while the Republican Party gives state parties the authority to allocate all of the delegates to a candidate within the \"proportionality window\", set by the first two weeks of March. After the window, state parties may set individual rules. A brokered convention occurs when a candidate does not receive a majority of votes on the first round of voting, or when a candidate withdraws.\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years of age, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years.\nElectoral map\n. Swing states are the states in lighter colors.]]\nMost U.S. states are not highly competitive in presidential elections, often voting consistently for the same party due to longstanding demographic differences. In the Electoral College, this results in major-party candidates primarily focusing their campaigns on swing states, which can swing between parties from election to election. These states are critical for a presidential candidate's path to victory. For 2028, the expected swing states likely include the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, as well as the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina, all of which were narrowly won by Donald Trump in 2024. The Minnesota Star Tribune also reported that the close margin in Minnesota would make it specifically a very likely swing state, and WMUR said the same about New Hampshire, which was Trump's closest loss and was \"much more of a swing state\".\nRed states, also known as the red wall or red sea, are states that consistently vote Republican at the national and state level. The red wall has rarely been broken, as these states almost never swing. The last significant breach of the red wall occurred in the 1992 United States presidential election. States formerly considered swing states, such as Florida, Iowa, and Ohio, voted for Trump in all three of his elections, with increasing margins in each election (and have become reliably red in other state and federal elections) which suggests that they are no longer swing states. Blue states are states that consistently vote Democratic at the national and state level. The blue states in 2024 include what is sometimes called the blue wall, as well as Colorado, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Virginia, former swing states that have become reliably blue since 2008 even in Republican national victories. Due to its recent record of voting Democratic even during Republican national wins, Nebraska's 2nd congressional district is also sometimes considered blue.\nCandidates\nPotential candidates\n|title=Potential candidates|align=center|footer=|style=|state=|mode=nolines|height=160|width=160|captionstyle=|File:Amanda_Gorman_2021_(3x4_crop).jpg|}}\nJimmy Donaldson\nOn a podcast in September 2022, Jimmy Donaldson commented that he would consider running for president of the United States \"in like 20 years\", adding that the U.S. is \"due for younger presidents\". On July 6, 2024, during the 2024 presidential election, Donaldson posted on X, \"If we lower the age to run for president I'll jump in the race.\" The first presidential election he will be eligible to run in under Article Two will be the 2036 election.\nAmanda Gorman\nIn 2017, Amanda Gorman said she intends to run for president in 2036, and she has subsequently often repeated this hope. On being selected as one of Glamour magazine's 2018 \"College Women of the Year\", she said: \"Seeing the ways that I as a young black woman can inspire people is something I want to continue in politics. I don't want to just speak works; I want to turn them into realities and actions.\" After she read her poem \"The Hill We Climb\" at President Joe Biden's inauguration in 2021, Hillary Clinton tweeted her support for Gorman's 2036 aspiration.\nTimeline\nOpinion polling\nNotes\nReferences"
