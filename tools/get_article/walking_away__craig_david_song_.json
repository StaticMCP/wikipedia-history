It was written by David and Mark Hill and released as the third single from his debut studio album, Born to Do It (2000), on 20 November 2000. It reached number three in the United Kingdom and number one in New Zealand, where it was the most successful song of 2001 according to the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).\nIn 2008, the track was re-recorded for David's Greatest Hits compilation, released in November 2008 in the United Kingdom. The new versions each feature a different artist: Lynnsha on the French version, Nek on the Italian version, Álex Ubago on the Spanish version and Monrose on the German version. Monrose's vocals were sung in English rather than in German, whereas the other artists sang in their native languages.\nMusic videos\nOriginal version\nThere are two versions of the video. The European music video begins with David with his girlfriend in a car, where she is seen yelling at him. He turns on the radio and the song starts. He then gets out of the car and the landscape continually changes, showing different places. This was directed by Max & Dania.\nThe US version starts with an acapella sample of the Ignorants remix, leading into the actual song. The video shows him \"walking away\" from troubles in his life: a flooded apartment, a fire in his 67 Camaro convertible, electrical problems at the train station, and a tornado at the end of the video. This was directed by Lenny Bass.\nGreatest Hits version\nNew versions of the songs were recorded and shot in 2008, and it features Lynnsha on the French version, Nek on the Italian version, Álex Ubago on the Spanish version and Monrose on the German version. The video was shot in black and white, and the guest artist is seen in some scenes. Sometimes, the two singers are seen together.\nTrack listings\nUK CD1 and Japanese CD single\n# \"Walking Away\"\n# \"Human\"\n# \"7 Days\" (live vibe in Amsterdam)\nUK CD2\n# \"Walking Away\" (radio edit)\n# \"Walking Away\" (Ignorants remix featuring Trell)\n# \"Walking Away\" (DJ Chunky remix featuring MC B-Live)\n# \"Walking Away\" (Treats (Better Day) remix)\nUK cassette single\n# \"Walking Away\"\n# \"Human\"\n# \"Walking Away\" (Ignorants remix featuring Trell)\nEuropean CD single\n# \"Walking Away\" – 3:27\n# \"7 Days\" (live in Stockholm) – 7:00\nAustralian CD single\n# \"Walking Away\" – 3:27\n# \"Human\" – 4:01\n# \"7 Days\" (live in Stockholm) – 7:00\n# \"Walking Away\" (Ignorants remix featuring Trell) – 5:16\n# \"Walking Away\" (DJ Chunky remix featuring MC B-Live) – 5:43\n# \"Walking Away\" (Treats Better Day remix) – 5:22\nUS 7-inch single\n# \"Walking Away\"\n# \"Time to Party\"\nUS 12-inch single\n:A1. \"Walking Away\" (album version) – 3:26\n:A2. \"Walking Away\" (album instrumental) – 3:26\n:A3. \"Walking Away\" (album acapella) – 3:03\n:B1. \"Walking Away\" (Ignorants remix featuring Trell) – 5:18\n:B2. \"Walking Away\" (Ignorants remix instrumental) – 4:43\n:B3. \"Walking Away\" (Ignorants remix acapella) – 3:56\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (2000–2002)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada CHR (Nielsen BDS)\n|11\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Croatia (HRT)\n|5\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|12\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Greece (IFPI)\n|10\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary (Mahasz)\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40)\n|24\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Poland (Music & Media)\n|4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Poland (Polish Airplay Charts)\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Romania (Romanian Top 100)\n|8\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (2000)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Ireland (IRMA)\n|80\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n|72\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (2001)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA)\n|30\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|69\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|France (SNEP)\n|72\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (RIANZ)\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Romania (Romanian Top 100)\n|75\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (2002)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada Radio (Nielsen BDS)\n|59\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard)\n|58\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|20 November 2000\n|CD\n|Wildstar\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Germany\n|28 November 2000\n|Maxi-CD\n|Edel\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japan\n|24 January 2001\n|CD\n|Victor Entertainment\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"|United States\n|25 March 2002\n|Rhythmic contemporary radio\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Atlantic\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|1 April 2002\n|Contemporary hit radio\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|7 May 2002\n|Hot adult contemporary radio\n|align=\"center\"|\n|}\nReferences"
