As a historian, his works primarily include the political history of Liechtenstein.\nLife\nVogt was born on 5 April 1952 in Balzers as the son of Anton Vogt and his mother Magdalena Wille as one of seven children. He had a Matura in 1972 before studying history in Zürich and Berlin.\nSince 1981, Vogt has worked in the Liechtenstein state archives, and has headed the office since 2002. He was a lecturer for history and political science in Vaduz from 1981 to 1993. Other roles have included member of the board for the Lake Constance History Association from 1980 to 1993, President of the Board of Trustees of the Liechtenstein State Museum from 1985 to 1994, and then board member from 1986 to 1995.

He was temporarily a member of the foreign policy commission, the state committee and the judge selection committee. Before the 2003 Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, Vogt was a notable opponent to the changes proposed whereby the Prince of Liechtenstein would be given wider powers, however it was accepted by the electorate.\nOn 19 November 2001, Vogt submitted a same-sex registered partnership initiative to the Landtag. Though it was rejected in 2003, a civil partnership law was introduced to Liechtenstein in 2011.\nVogt married Erika Hofer on 4 February 1988 and they have two children.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.liechtenstein-institut.li/en/people/paul-vogt Paul Vogt's entry at the Liechtenstein Institute]\nReferences"
