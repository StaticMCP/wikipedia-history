It was the last encounter between Captain Welsh and the Moamorias before his recallment. The site of the battle is in present-day Sivasagar town on the road called Dhai Ali. According to the Assamese traditions, Captain Welsh's last encounter with the Moamorias was a severe and decisive one.\nAhom king Gaurinath Singha watched this engagement from Rang Ghar near his palace enclosure. Visheswar Vaidyadhip, the author of Belimarar Buranji described the battle with epical vigor:\nIn this engagement, the Moamorias were finally repulsed from Rangpur.\nSee also\n*Moamoria rebellion\n*Ahom Kingdom\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
