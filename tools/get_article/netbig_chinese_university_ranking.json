The ranking is conducted annually since 1999, and is generally released in July, around the time of college entrance examination. This ranking, however, has ceased to publish newer versions since 2013.\nRanking methods\nThere are seven different ranking systems in Chinese university ranking (Netbig).\nThe first ranking system is \"comprehensive (overall) ranking\", which is based on 2~7th ranking system.\nThe second ranking system is based on \"reputation\".\nThe third ranking system is based on “academic resources”.\nThe fourth ranking system is based on \"academic achievement\".\nThe fifth ranking system is based on \"student ability\".\nThe sixth ranking system is based on \"professor honor\".\nThe seventh ranking system is based on \"reserve fund\".\nCriticism\nAfter its first release Netbig was sued by a Renmin University of China alumnus for committing libel to his Alma mater, by ranking the school 25th when it has the best law school in China. An official from the Chinese Ministry of Education commented on the ranking as being \"baseless\" and \"completely without scientific studies.\" Some also argued that Netbig did not but should have considered employment data in ranking the universities.\nTop 10 Universities\nThe rank started in 1999 and ceased in 2013.\n1999\n1.
