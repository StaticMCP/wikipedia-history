In the , Sladevale had a population of 433 people.\nHistory\nIn 1897, the residents of Campbell's Plains began to lobby for a school, declaring in 1898 that there were more than fifty children in the district. In 1899, the Queensland Government called for tenders to erect the school and teacher's residence. Campbell's Plains State School opened on 13 November 1899 under headmaster James Allen Ferguson. In 1900, the post office at the school was renamed Sladevale because the name Campbell's Plains was too common. In 1903, the school was renamed Sladevale State School. The school closed in 1932 and its teacher's resident relocated to Applethorpe. Local residents tried to have the school re-opened in 1937 without success. In 1944, it was agreed to re-open the school with about 17 students. It closed on 28 April 1967. It was at 12739 Cunningham Highway ().\nCampbells Plains railway station () and Sladevale railway station () were on the former Maryvale railway line.\nDemographics\nIn the , Sladevale had a population of 381 people.\nIn the , Sladevale had a population of 433 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Sladevale.
