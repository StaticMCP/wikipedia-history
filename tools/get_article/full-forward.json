      "text": "# Full-forward\n\nFull-forward is a position in Australian rules football and Gaelic football with a key focus on kicking goals.\nThe Coleman Medal is awarded to the player, often a full-forward, who has kicked the most goals in an Australian Football League season.\nIn modern Australian rules football and Gaelic football, in which players do not strictly stick to a single position, the full-forward is often referred to as a \"Key Forward\" and can often switch positions with the centre half-forward for \"team balance\" reasons.\nThe frequency of players kicking 100 goals in a season has decreased in recent years. According to modern great Leigh Matthews, due to contact penalties protecting intercepting defenders, modern tactics and an endurance style of play, the power forward  or stay at home lead-up role of the 1980s and 1990s that was capable of kicking 100 goals a season is no longer a feature of the game at the elite level. In the AFL Women's with 2 less players on the ground, provides additional space for more traditional full forward to lead into, however the reduced game duration and season lowers the overall number of goals they can kick. In Gaelic Football, goals don’t come too often with an average of 1 goal per game in a single match.\nNotable full-forwards\nPresent key forwards\nkicks for goal from the 50 metre line during the State of Origin for Bushfire Relief Match.]]\n* Charlie Curnow\n* Jeremy Cameron\n* Jack Darling\n* Darcy Fogarty\n* Jesse Hogan\n* Kate Hore\n* Harry McKay\n* Taylor Walker\n* Ashleigh Woodland\n* Jesse Wardlaw\nPast great full-forwards\n, the dominant full-forward of the modern era, attempting a difficult kick for goal from outside the boundary beyond the 50 metre line.
