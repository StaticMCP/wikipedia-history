In 1607, the building burned in a city fire. Three years later, it was rebuilt as a residence for Dean J. Raciborski. In the 18th century, it was home to a theological seminary.  In 1838, the palace's grounds were reduced in favor of the Castle, and in 1844 the building was converted into a tenement house. In 1870–1939, the Deanery  housed offices and Castle employees.\nDuring the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, the building suffered substantial damage. Only small fragments of the ground floor and first floor survived. Almost all of Dziekania (Deanery) Street, including St. John's Cathedral, was destroyed by the explosion of a German Goliath tracked mine.\nIn 1966-68, the Deanery was rebuilt to a design by Stanisław Marzyński, with a somewhat modified appearance relative to its prewar one.\nSince 2016, the Deanery has been home to the Museum of the Archdiocese of Warsaw.\nFile:Ulica Dziekania w Warszawie 3.jpg|Deanery Street, with Deanery at right\nFile:Ulica Dziekania w Warszawie 4.jpg|Façade of Deanery\nFile:Gąsienica czołgu - miny Goliat - Warszawa - Dziekania.JPG|Plaque commemorating explosion of Goliath tracked mine\nReferences"
