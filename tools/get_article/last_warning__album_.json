It was released in 1993 on Relativity Records, marketed by Roadrunner Records, and follows 1992's studio album, One Voice.\nThe first eleven tracks—often consisting of two songs strung together—were recorded live in December 1992 at CBGB in New York City. The remainder of the CD is the band's 1983 7-inch EP, United Blood. It contrasts the later crossover thrash style the band had adopted in later releases with the raw New York hardcore style of their debut release. The album was originally intended to be the band's last release, but they reformed some five years later and released the album ''Something's Gotta Give.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Agnostic Front, except for \"Crucified\" (Iron Cross).\nPersonnel\nTracks 1–11\n;Agnostic Front\n* Roger Miret&nbsp;– vocals\n* Vinnie Stigma&nbsp;– lead guitar\n* Matt Henderson&nbsp;– rhythm guitar\n* Craig Setari&nbsp;– bass\n* Will Shepler&nbsp;– drums\n;Production\n* Recorded live at CBGB, New York, on December 20, 1992\n* Produced by Don Fury\n* Engineered by Rick Roy\n* Mixed at Don Fury Studios by Don Kiddick\nTracks 12–22\n;Agnostic Front\n* Roger Miret&nbsp;– vocals\n* Vinnie Stigma&nbsp;– guitars\n* Adam Moochie&nbsp;– bass\n* Raybeez&nbsp;– drums\n;Production\n* Tracks taken from the United Blood'' 7-inch EP, released in 1983 on Last Warning Records\n* Produced by Agnostic Front and Stephen Elliott\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/19981207003904/http://agnosticfront.com/ Agnostic Front official website]"
