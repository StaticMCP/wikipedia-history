It was released on March 1, 2019, through Century Media Records. It is the third studio album recorded with vocalist Todd La Torre, who additionally performed drum parts on the album due to the absence of drummer Scott Rockenfield, making it the first album since 2009's American Soldier to be recorded as a four-piece band, and the band's last album with rhythm guitarist Parker Lundgren. The record was produced by Chris \"Zeuss\" Harris.\nThe first single from the album, \"Man the Machine\", was released on November 16, 2018. This was followed by the second single, \"Dark Reverie\", on January 11, 2019. Additionally, a music video was made for \"Blood of the Levant\".\nReception\nLouder Sound described the album as '...an improvement on their 2015 album Condition Hüman, it has all of the hallmarks of the band’s early classics – the heavy metal power and prog rock finesse, the majestic twin-guitar harmonies and glass-shattering vocals.'\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nQueensrÿche\n*Todd La Torre – lead vocals, drums\n*Michael Wilton – lead guitar\n*Parker Lundgren – rhythm guitar\n*Eddie Jackson – bass, backing vocals\nProduction\n* Zeuss – production, engineering, mixing, mastering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
