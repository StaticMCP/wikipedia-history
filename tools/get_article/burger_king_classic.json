      "text": "# Burger King Classic\n\nThe Burger King Basketball Classic, formerly known as the '''McDonald's Classic''' from 1983 to 2010, is a four-team boys high school basketball invitational tournament held each year since 1983 in Erie, Pennsylvania.\nSince its inception in 1983, the Burger King Classic has been considered one of the best four-team high school tournaments in the country. Maxpreps.com and Eddie Oliver from Hoops USA called it \"the best\" and ESPN.com has called it one of the most impactful events of MLK weekend. Each year, nationally ranked teams with future NCAA Division-I and NBA  players travel to Erie to battle for the championship and the opportunity to play against other top talent.\nThe Burger King Classic has hosted the nation's top-ranked team eight times, over 25 state champions and nearly two dozen All-Americans and future NBA players. Hosted by Cathedral Preparatory School, the tournament has drawn thousands of basketball fans from across the nation each year. Archbishop Wood (PA) is the defending Classic champions while Rice (NY) and St. Edward (OH) has won the tournament a record four times each.\nThe Classic\nClassic history\nThe Burger King Classic has been played at three locations in its history. The Erie Insurance Arena was used to house the tournament in the 1980s. In 1989, the location was moved to Gannon University's Hammermill Center. In 2016, the tournament was moved to the JoAnn Mullen Gymnasium at the Hagerty Family Events Center.  The Classic is held in mid-January over a Friday and Saturday.\nRon Sertz, former Cathedral Prep Athletic Director and Director of Operations for the Erie Otters, founded the tournament and ran it for its first 25 years of existence. In 1983, after a year as athletic director at Cathedral Prep, he decided to begin a top-level tip-off classic for the community.\nThis tip-off tournament became the McDonald's Classic in 1983 and brought in three strong teams (Beaver Falls of PA, Bishop Loughlin of Brooklyn, NY, and Roman Catholic of Philadelphia, PA). The tournament was considered a success with Bishop Loughlin being crowned as the first Classic Champion, defeating the host Cathedral Prep Ramblers 70–63. Sertz decided to move the tournament into even more prominence and began to work harder and harder on bringing even stronger and more recognized teams every year. During the 25th anniversary of the Classic in 2008, Sertz announced his retirement as classic director. He was replaced by current Cathedral Prep Athletic Director Bill Flanagan.\nIn 2010, Burger King signed a multi-year sponsorship deal with the Classic, taking the event's title away from rival McDonald's, who had held the moniker since 1983.\nEvent schedule\nThe tournament is composed of four teams in a round-robin format. Classic teams usually arrive on the Thursday before the tournament begins. Each team is assigned a host from Cathedral Prep who caters to them for the entire day, makes sure they get to meals, and finds places they wish to visit. Each team is given rooms at the Sheraton Erie Bay front Hotel.\nThursday is usually spent as a time to settle in for each team. On Friday, practices are scheduled by the host for each team to attend. Each practice is held at Cathedral Prep's gymnasium and is usually a shoot-around for the team. The first game normally tips off Friday night at 7:00.\nOn Saturday, teams may schedule a shoot-around at the Prep gymnasium if they wish or they may travel around Erie. The consolation match takes place at 7:00 between the two teams who lost the previous night and then the night is highlighted by the Classic Championship at 8:30. After the championship game, a presentation ceremony takes place and words are said from the winning coach on the tournament. Sunday morning the teams return to their respective schools.\nThe host\nSince its inception in 1983, the Classic has been hosted by Cathedral Prep of Erie, Pennsylvania. Cathedral Prep is a co-educational Roman Catholic high school in Erie, Pennsylvania, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie. Prep, as the school is commonly called in Erie, was established in 1921 by then Bishop John Mark Gannon. Bishop Gannon founded Prep as an all-male Catholic high school.\nThe Cathedral Prep basketball team has won two PIAA Basketball Championships (1980 and 1993) and four PCIAA (Pennsylvania Catholic Interscholastic Athletic Association) in 1953, 1954, 1968 and 1971. Cathedral Prep has turned out a total of 22 Division 1 basketball players in its 100+ years. In its role as the host team, Prep has always played the second, or 8:30, game of the first round. Various members of the school provide meals, direction and other services for the visiting teams as well as help out at the games themselves with things like photography, trophy presentation and security.\nClassic history\n1983\nChampions: Bishop Loughlin, Brooklyn, NY\nBishop Loughlin 93, Beaver Falls 66\nCathedral Prep 54, Roman Catholic 52 (OT)\nConsolation: Roman Catholic 57, Beaver Falls 46\nChampionship: Bishop Loughlin 70, Cathedral Prep 63\nThe first Classic runs as a tip-off tournament as Cathedral Prep stuns Philadelphia Roman Catholic in overtime on opening night.

The Saints would turn in a strong performance for the championship game en route to their second classic title as Jenkins led the charge with 23 points and 17 rebounds, giving him 46 points and 31 rebounds over the two-day event.  Myers also helped out with 22 points, giving him 52 overall for the weekend.  As for Cathedral Prep, they fell to the Saints on opening night before getting swept in their tournament by the Wolverines (who were making their first B.K. Classic appearance since 2012) in the third-place game.\n2025\nChampions: Archbishop Wood, Warminster Township, PA\nArchbishop Wood 56, Richmond Heights 49\nCathedral Prep 54, Aliquippa 46\nConsolation: Richmond Heights 67, Aliquippa 63 (OT)\nChampionship: Archbishop Wood 63, Cathedral Prep 62\nWithin a tournament field mostly consisting of first-time participants and entirely of programs that've all won state championships over the prior decade, the Warminster, Pa.-based Vikings edged the Cleveland-based and defending Ohio-state champion Spartans to kick things off as Brady MacAdams led the way with 22 points while teammate Mike Green helped out with 15 points.  As for the host Ramblers, they took advantage of the defending PIAA-champion Quips' late-game foul & turnover troubles in order to pull away with their opening round win and reach the championship match for the first time since 2020.  Cathedral Prep point guard Nando Mirarchi led the team with 23 points and would even set a B.K. Classic single-game record for free throws made & attempted as he went 17-for-18 at the line. In the consolation game, Richmond Heights would mount a 23-8 fourth-quarter comeback before ultimately claiming third place in overtime as Mehki Ansberry powered the Spartans with 17 points.  DeErick Barber, Jr. and Denarris Winters, Jr. would both contribute with 16 points each while Joe Emory helped the team close things out on a high note with 12 points.  As for the championship game, the Ramblers played Archbishop Wood tough and even held a late lead.  However, the Vikings made a fourth-quarter push before MacAdams (who lead his team with another 22-point performance) sank a game-winning three-point shot in the final seconds to give them the Classic Crown.  Green & Jaydn Jenkins also helped out the cause with 17 & 13 points respectively.  Prep's Mirarchi led all players with 32 points, giving him 55 total points over the two-day event.''\n25th Anniversary \"Best Moments\"\nIn the McDonald's Classic 25th Anniversary game program, director Ron Sertz revealed his favorite memories from the history of the event.\nBest Team\nSt. Anthony (N.J.) from Classic '89 (\"eventual national champions led by Bobby Hurley, Terry DeHere and Jerry Walker\")\nBest Player\nChris Webber, Detroit Country Day (\"best pure combination of raw talent and refined skills\")\nBest Coach\nMarcel Arribi, Cathedral Prep (\"never blessed with national talent, yet led Prep to 6 title game appearances and three titles\")\nBest Game\nBishop Loughlin vs. Cathedral Prep, 1991 Championship (\"Prep's Jim Hamilton won the Classic in a monumental upset with a buzzer-beating 3 pointer\")\nBest Moment\nCathedral Prep's 1987 Title run (\"in the most exciting Classic ever, Prep defeated cross-city archrival McDowell in the opener and upset national #1 Oak Hill Academy in the final 58-48\")\nBiggest Upset\nCathedral Prep over Oak Hill, 1987 (\"no one gave Prep a chance but coach Arribi out coached Oak Hill's Steve Smith and came away with the first of his three titles\")\nWorst Moment\nLenny Cooke shatters a backboard, 2000 (\"a pregame warm up dunk broke the backboard and delayed the title game by an hour\")\nMost Exciting Play\nMelvin Levitt's dunk, 1994 (\"Levitt elevated completed over Prep's Keith Nies' head and threw it down from 6-8 feet from the hoop\")\nParticipants\nSchools from all over America have competed in the Burger King Classic.
