The country was a one-party state at the time, with the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) as the sole legal party. PDG leader and incumbent president Omar Bongo was the only candidate, and was re-elected unopposed. Voter turnout was reported to be 99.9%.\nThese were the last one-party elections in Gabon, as the country returned to multi-party democracy in 1990.\nResults\nReferences"
