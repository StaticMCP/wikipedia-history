The Wuyue cultural area, centered in the Taihu Lake basin, roughly corresponds to present-day southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang Province, and Shanghai. Wuyue culture is commonly categorized into two regional variants: \"Wu culture\" and \"Yue culture.\"\nWuyue culture, which is closely associated with the Wu language, developed during the Zhou Dynasty and later incorporated influences from northern cultures during the Jin Dynasty. During the Tang Dynasty, the Wuyue economy began to surpass that of the north, further expanding its influence. While northern Han culture was transformed by extended periods of conflict and non-Han governance, Wuyue culture preserved numerous elements associated with earlier traditional Chinese culture.\nHistorical records of the Wu and Yue states began to appear in written sources during the Spring and Autumn Period. The location of the original Wu capital is recorded as the time when Zhou Taibo fled to Wu, first residing in Meili and later in Gusu. Both sites lie between Suzhou and Wuxi, within the Taihu Lake region.\nLanguage\nLiterature\nMusic\nArts\nOpera styles\nPhilosophy and religion\nHeritage sites\nCultural items\nCuisine\nOthers\nSee also\n* Culture of Shanghai\n* Zhongyuan culture\n* Culture of Jiangxi\n* Hokkien culture\n* Hakka culture\n* Cantonese culture\n* Chinese culture\nReferences"
