The 140-km track was first sanctioned in 1928 under the British, but stayed on the backburner. The project was revived only in 1993–94 and a budget of Rs 2.84&nbsp;billion approved.\nThe then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao laid the foundation stone. But protests by the Shiv Sena, which opposed the displacement of people, stalled the project for many more years.\nIn September 2008, when President Pratibha Patil inaugurated the New Amravati railway station, it seemed as if the project would be completed soon. Far from it. In November 2009, the Railway Ministry announced the link would be inaugurated in December 2010.\nNarkhed-Amravati line is ready in January 2014. Railways are now available to travel from Narkhed to Bhusaval. Warud Orange City railway station is 3&nbsp;km from the centre of the Warud.\nThe Amravati - Chandur Bazar - Morshi - Warud Orange City - Narkher railway track is electrified. People of Warud can travel by train to cities like Amravati, Akola, Shegaon, Bhusawal, Washim, Hingoli, Nanded, Hyderabad, Narkher, Morshi, Chandur Bazar, Badnera, Indore, Bhopal, Bangalore, Jaipur, Itarsi\nRoadways\nThere is a Warud MSRTC Depot of Maharashtra State Transport (S.T. Bus) in Warud. It has better connectivity with neighbouring towns and districts Amaravati, Akola, Nagpur, Yavatmal and Wardha. Buses for neighbouring state Madhya Pradesh are also available.\nAgriculture\nShendurjana Ghat, Loni, Jarud, Jamgaon, Pusla, Isambri, Bahada, Tembhurkheda and Jamthi are the main exporters of oranges in Warud taluka. That is why it is also known as \"Orange City\" or California of India.
