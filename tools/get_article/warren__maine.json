The population was 4,865 at the 2020 census. It includes the villages of East Warren, Warren and South Warren, the latter home to the Maine State Prison and minimum security Bolduc Correctional Facility.\nHistory\nPart of the Waldo Patent, it was called the Upper Town of St. Georges Plantation. It was first settled by Scots-Irish settlers from Londonderry in 1736 under the auspices of Brigadier-General Samuel Waldo, its proprietor. Development was hindered, however, by the ongoing French and Indian Wars. In 1753, a blockhouse was built and placed under the command of Captain Thomas Kilpatrick, known by terrified Indians as \"Tom-kill-the-devil.\" War raged across Maine between 1754–1758, and local settlers took refuge in the blockhouse or at another in Cushing.[https://archive.org/details/annalstownwarre01eatogoog/page/n125  Cyrus Eaton, Annals of the Town of Warren; Masters, Smith & Company, Hallowell, Maine 1851]\nHostilities ended in 1759 with the Fall of Quebec. On November 7, 1776, Upper Town of St. Georges Plantation was incorporated as a town, named after Joseph Warren, a Revolutionary War hero.\nHay was the principal crop. Shipbuilding was an important industry, and between 1770–1850, 224 vessels were built, varying from 53 to 1,127 tons. Warren had quarries to extract granite and limestone. Falls on the St. George River provided water power, with the first sawmill built in 1785. Woolens were manufactured at the Georges River Mills, and snowshoes at the Warren Shoe Factory. The Knox and Lincoln Railroad opened on November 6, 1871.\nThe General Henry Knox Canal system (named after Henry Knox, who purchased the locks in 1794) was initially built by Charles Barrett in 1793 to connect the tidewaters of the St. George River with St. George Lake in Liberty,  facilitating the shipment of lumber and lime. But the locks fell into decay following Knox's death in 1806. In 1848, the canal was reopened for navigation by the Georges Canal Company at a cost of $80,000. It again fell into disuse following 1877, rendered obsolete by the railroad. The canal banks and one lock may still be seen in Warren, however, uncovered as part of a river beautification project in 1966.\nIn 1853, Warren elected Olive Rose as County Register of Deeds. She was the first woman to hold elected office in the United States. Warren became a part of Knox county when it was partitioned in 1860 from parts of Waldo and Lincoln counties.\nSince 2002, South Warren is home to the Maine State Prison, a 900-bed maximum security facility formerly located in Thomaston since 1824. The prison's gift shop, which sells over 600 inmate-made goods, remains in Thomaston at the site of the old prison.\nPeterborough\nIn South Warren was the site of Peterborough, a black settlement first founded in 1782. Three possible legends try to explain the foundation of this community.\nOne suggests that Amos Peters, a black Revolutionary War veteran from Plymouth, Massachusetts, was working for General Henry Knox. When Peters married another slave named Sarah, Knox gave the couple land to settle on in what later became Peterborough. Following the 1780 Quock Walker court case, Amos and Sarah Peters were freed from slavery. Another story suggests that General Knox, who served in Virginia during the War, built himself a mansion that matched the style of estates he had seen in Virginia. He recruited blacks to serve as staff for the mansion. As space at the estate and servants quarters shrunk, \"Knox sent many of the families to live in the settlement started by Amos and Sarah Peters\". Another story suggests that many of the original settlers of the community were so-called \"limecoasters\", black deckhands who were part of the Lime trade from Thomaston to the Southern US.\nRegardless of the origin, the community grew, having a population of over three hundred people at its peak. In 1823, the population of children in the settlement was enough to warrant its own school. In 1845, the town of Warren provided $75 for the building of a schoolhouse in Peterborough. The school had both black and white teachers, and attendance averaged between twenty-four and thirty students in a given year. The school building also housed church services and social events.\nThe population of the settlement began to decline by the end of the Civil War. The decline of the shipbuilding industry in the area, coupled with the fact that black people were excluded from factory work, are theorized as some of the factors behind this reduction. The area was populated by descendants of the original settlers until 1961, when William, Grace and Woodrow Peters moved from Peterborough to a house along Route 90. Today the area is made up of newer houses with no residents having roots to the original community.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which   is land and  is water. Drained by the Back River, Warren is located at the head of tide on the banks of the St. George River.\nIt is crossed by U.S. Route 1 and state routes 90, 131 and 235. It borders the towns of Union to the north, Rockport to the northeast, Rockland to the east, Thomaston to the southeast, Cushing to the south, Friendship to the southwest, and Waldoboro to the west.\nDemographics\n}}\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 4,751 people, 1,508 households, and 1,086 families residing in the town.
