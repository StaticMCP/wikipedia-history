The ward has existed since the creation of the borough on 1 April 1965 and was first used in the 1964 elections. It returns councillors to Havering London Borough Council. There was a revision of ward boundaries in 1978, 2002 and 2022. The revision in 2022 reduced the number of councillors from three to two.\nThe 1965, 1978 and 2002 versions of the ward covered a large area of southern Hornchurch extending northwards from the River Thames, including the industrialised Hornchurch Marshes area. Since 2022 the ward has corresponded with the South Hornchurch neighbourhood.\nList of councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Term\n! Councillor\n! colspan=2 | Party\n|-\n| 1964–1968\n| C.
