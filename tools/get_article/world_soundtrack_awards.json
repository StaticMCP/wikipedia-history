The WSAcademy is an international community of screen composers and industry professionals that supports the art of film music through cultural, promotional, educational and professional activities. The WSAcademy promotes film music worldwide through the annual presentation of the WSAwards, as well as through the development of other promotional activities. The WSAcademy supports both emerging and established composers for screen.\nThrough the organisation of film music seminars, masterclasses, workshops and other activities at Film Fest Gent, the WSAcademy actively contributes to the education and study of this art form. The WSAcademy engages itself in the preservation of the history of film music through recordings, publications and the development of an archive.\nThe festival is praised as one of the first cultural organizations to turn the spotlight on film music, which gave it the status of a pioneer.
