The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, non-government organizations (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field. An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions. For the succeeding two-year period until a new Watch List is published, these 100 sites can avail grants and funds from the WMF, as well as from other foundations, private donors, and corporations by capitalizing on the publicity and attention gained from the inclusion on the Watch List.\n2020 Watch List\nThe 2020 Watch List call for nomination was announced in January 2019 with the deadline in March 2019. More than 250 nominees were submitted. Twenty five sites were selected to be included in the list.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n!
