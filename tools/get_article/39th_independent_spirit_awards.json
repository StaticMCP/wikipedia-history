It was also revealed that the disruption was coming from one young male who was holding the loudspeaker and standing on the outer part of the Spirits barricade; a group of security guards and Spirits showrunners tried to reason with the protester, who was quite calm and tranquil, but to no success. Another group of Spirits security guards stood by and watched; three police officers, one in fully armed gear, looked on.\nAdditionally, The New York Times pop culture reporter Kyle Buchanan spoke to the protester who refused to give a statement and revealed that he is with the National Alliance Against Racist & Political Repression; the protester elaborated that The New York Times \"is a publication that has been complicit in misinformation and distortion of the facts\".\nFurthermore, film critic Tomris Laffly was able to speak to one of the protesters, Vivian Wiseman, about disrupting awards events to keep a light on the events happening in Palestine; Wiseman told Laffly: \"We want everyone to know that the activists and the people who care are going to disrupt them wherever they go because we believe in love, we believe in peace, and we believe in liberation of the Palestinian people.\"\nAfterward, Josh Welsh, the long-serving president of Film Independent, responded to the scene, saying: \"We embrace the First Amendment and freedom of speech, and this is clearly a moment when people feel passionately about what's happening in the world and want to speak about it. We support that. Of course, we also want to honor the filmmakers here today in their moment being recognized for their beautiful work. But I think today was a beautiful show and people incorporated what was going on into their remarks in really great ways.\"\nThe following day, the Los Angeles Times revealed that filmmaker Merawi Gerima was among the protesters; Gerima previously won the John Cassavetes Award for his film Residue at the 36th Independent Spirit Awards in 2021. A video posted to the Instagram page of the U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN) showed the beginning of the protest, with Gerima speaking into a loudspeaker to announce they are there on behalf of the USPCN and the National Alliance Against Racist & Political Repression. \"We say it is far better to stand with the oppressed people around the world than with the oppressors here in Hollywood,\" Gerima said in the video, before specifically calling out multiple times actor Jeffrey Wright, star of the film American Fiction; the film won two awards, including Best Lead Performance for Wright. \"It's not enough to have a film about racism, Mr. Jeffrey Wright,\" said Gerima. \"It's not enough to have a film about oppression in the United States, Jeffrey Wright. It is far more important to stand against oppression and racism as it exists in the world today in solidarity with the Black and brown people of the planet, particularly Palestinians.\" Gerima stated in another video: \"A whole industry of communicators is absolutely silent in the face of genocide. And so we say no business as usual, not even in Hollywood.\" A request for comment from Gerima was not responded to while Film Independent did not respond to a request for comment on the protest.\nSee also\n* 96th Academy Awards\n* 81st Golden Globe Awards\n* 77th British Academy Film Awards\n* 44th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 30th Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 29th Critics' Choice Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSpl10BIgaI 2024 Film Independent Spirit Awards Hosted by Aidy Bryant] at [https://www.youtube.com/filmindependent Film Independent] on YouTube\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooSjBLYH29A Show Highlights | The 2024 Film Independent Spirit Awards hosted by Aidy Bryant] at [https://www.youtube.com/filmindependent Film Independent] on YouTube"
