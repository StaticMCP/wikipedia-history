Situated at the corner of Wellington Road South and Greek Street, it houses war memorials and exhibition spaces and is designated as a Grade II* listed building.\nDesign\nStockport War Memorial Art Gallery was designed by architect James Theodore Halliday of Halliday, Paterson & Agate in the Neoclassical Greek Revival style, featuring a central tetrastyle Corinthian portico. The building has a modified T-shaped layout with two side galleries, a first-floor picture gallery, and a full-height memorial hall at the rear, which includes a dome and an apsidal end wall.\nThe entrance opens into a marble-paved hall, offering a view of the memorial hall at the rear. On either side, galleries are screened by pairs of marble fluted Greek Doric columns. The walls of the memorial hall are lined with Mazzano marble and feature white marble plaques recording the names of 2,200 World War I casualties. Additional plaques have been added to commemorate those who died in World War II and later conflicts, including the Korean War, Falklands War, and The Troubles. A white marble sculpture by Gilbert Ledward, entitled Britannia and Soldier, is located in an apse.\nHistory\nThe foundation stone for the building was laid on 15 September 1923, in a ceremony attended by Mayor Alderman Charles Royle.\nPrince Henry inaugurated the Stockport War Memorial on 15 October 1925, as a tribute to those who died in World War I.\nOn 11 July 2007, Stockport War Memorial Art Gallery was designated a Grade II* listed building.\nThe gallery spaces host year-round exhibitions featuring both national and international artists, including Helen Clapcott. The gallery also offers a programme that provides emerging artists with opportunities to showcase their work and hosts various events and workshops.\nGallery\nFile:Stockport Art Gallery - geograph.org.uk - 1369136.jpg|Stockport War Memorial Art Gallery viewed from Frances Street, 2009\nFile:Memorial Hall - geograph.org.uk - 7458909.jpg|Memorial hall\nFile:Their Names (1) - geograph.org.uk - 7458924.jpg|Names of Cheshire Regiment servicemen\nFile:Their Names (2) - geograph.org.uk - 7458932.jpg|Names of Cheshire Regiment servicemen\nFile:Their Names (3) - geograph.org.uk - 7458995.jpg|Names of Cheshire Regiment and Manchester Regiment servicemen\nFile:Their Names (4) - geograph.org.uk - 7459001.jpg|Names of servicemen killed since 1945\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed buildings in Greater Manchester\n*Listed buildings in Stockport\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.facebook.com/StockportMuseums Stockport Museums and Galleries official Facebook page]"
