He built hotels under the Spinzar brand in Kunduz, Kabul and other northern cities, employing over 20,000 people including woman working in the porcelain factory.

It was soon found to be a major city of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom and was extensively studied before the outbreak of the Soviet-Afghan War in 1979, during which it was comprehensively looted. Artefacts from the ruins have been exhibited worldwide.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Dupree, Louis: Afghanistan\n*Emadi, Hafizullah: Dynamics of Political Development in Afghanistan.
