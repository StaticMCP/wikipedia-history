After studying at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly, she began studies at the École Normale Supérieure in 1934 but contracted tuberculosis which forced her to drop out. She married another Jewish mathematician, Laurent Schwartz, in 1938, and both soon went into hiding while the Nazis occupied France. After the war, she taught at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne and finished a thesis on generalizations of the Gauss–Bonnet formula in 1953. In 1964, she moved to the University of Lille, from where she retired in 1981.\nRecognition\nA conference was held in her honour in Lille in 1986, and a day of lectures in Paris honoured her 80th birthday in 1993, during which she presented a two-hour talk herself. She continued publishing mathematical research into her late 80s.\nReferences"
