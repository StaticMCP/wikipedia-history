Harding\n| Harding was a 33-year-old member of the Ohio state senate when the Spanish-American War broke out.\n|-\n| Calvin Coolidge\n| Coolidge was 26 years old, practicing as an attorney, and serving as a city council member when the Spanish-American War broke out.\n|-\n| Herbert Hoover\n| Served in a private humanitarian capacity as a civilian in Europe during World War I.

Served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1913 and through World War I; when the U.S. entered the war in 1917 he offered his resignation so that he could apply for a commission in the Navy, but was refused by the president. However he did visit the Western Front in 1918.\n|-\n| Bill Clinton\n| Received a 2-A student draft deferment during the Vietnam War, and later registered for the draft.
