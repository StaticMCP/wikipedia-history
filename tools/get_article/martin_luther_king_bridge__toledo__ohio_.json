The structure opened to traffic in 1914.\nHistory\nIn 2001 the bridge started what was to have been a $31 million USD refurbishment.  This refurbishment widened the bridge's four lanes and added pedestrian walkways.\nThe bridge's original control towers were replaced with new towers, modeled after the originals.\nWhen originally built, the streetcars operated by the Toledo Railways & Light Company shared the bridge with motor vehicles.\nThe technique employed to keep the streetcar's power wire taut when in use, yet allowing the bridge to be raised, was considered innovative and was copied in similar bridges.\nThe bridge's original deck was an open metal mesh.\nThe bridge was designed by Arnold W. Brunner and built by Osborn Engineering.\nThe bridge, including its approaches, is  long.  It is located a mile upstream from the Veterans' Glass City Skyway where Interstate 280 crosses the river.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
