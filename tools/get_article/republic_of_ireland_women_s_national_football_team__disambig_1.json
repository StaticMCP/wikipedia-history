The team played in their first World Cup at the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. It has taken part in invitational tournaments such as the Algarve Cup, the Istria Cup, the Cyprus Cup and Pinatar Cup. It is organised by the Women's Football Association of Ireland.\nHistory\nIn 1973, the Women's Football Association of Ireland was established and in the same year on 13 May the Republic of Ireland made their official international debut, Paula Gorham's hat-trick securing a 3–2 win in an away friendly game against Wales. They made their competitive debut on 19 September 1982 in a 1984 European Competition for Women's Football qualifier against Scotland. This time the Republic of Ireland lost 3–0. On 2 October 1982 the Republic of Ireland gained their first competitive win when they defeated Northern Ireland 2–1 in an away game in the same competition. After losing 10–0 to Sweden in a Euro 1993 qualifier, the FAI did not enter a team in the 1995 competition. This defeat against Sweden remains the team's biggest defeat.\nDuring the 2000s the Republic of Ireland enjoyed some minor successes. In 2000 they won the Celt Cup – a four team tournament that also featured Northern Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. In their 2005 UEFA Women's Euro campaign they also won their second level group, finishing above Romania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Malta. This would have secured promotion to the elite group of nations which competed directly for qualification to major tournaments, had the two level system not been scrapped for the next qualifying campaign. The Republic of Ireland also won their group at the 2013 Cyprus Cup, finishing above South Korea, South Africa and Northern Ireland.\nThe Republic of Ireland has also enjoyed some success at both under-17 and under-19 levels. In 2010, with a team that included Megan Campbell, Ciara Grant, Dora Gorman, Denise O'Sullivan, Siobhán Killeen and Clare Shine, the Republic of Ireland U-17 squad were runners-up in the 2010 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship and quarter-finalists in the 2010 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. In the UEFA championship semi-final the Republic of Ireland defeated Germany 1–0. With a team that included Megan Connolly, Savannah McCarthy and Katie McCabe the Republic of Ireland team won their group at the 2014 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship and qualified for the semi-finals.\nIn April 2017, the squad demanded better treatment from the FAI and threatened to boycott a home match against Slovakia. They wanted a higher match fee, and broken time payment for amateurs missing work. They claimed that they had to share with underage teams the tracksuits they wore travelling to and from away matches, and change out of them in airport toilets. The boycott threat was lifted when agreement on improvements was reached.\nIn November 2021 the team recorded their biggest ever win: 11–0 against Georgia in the qualifiers for 2023 World Cup. The team secured a crucial victory in their World Cup qualifying campaign, defeating Finland 1-0 in a Group A match. The decisive goal was scored in the second half by substitute Lily Agg, allowing the Irish team to claim second place in the group with one game remaining.\nThis achievement was soon surpassed when Ireland won the play-off final 1–0 over Scotland in Glasgow on 11 October 2022 to qualify for the final tournament.\nA crucial first-half penalty save from Courtney Brosnan kept Ireland alive before Donegal native Amber Barrett scored the decisive goal, days after news of an explosion that killed several people in her county. She dedicated the goal to the victims and the community. While celebrating in the Hampden changing rooms, several players sang Celtic Symphony praising the Irish Republican Army, for which manager Vera Pauw and players Áine O'Gorman and Chloe Mustaki apologised; the chanting was condemned by politicians from Northern Ireland. The FAI was fined €20,000 for the chanting.\nThey played their first ever Women's World Cup game on 20 July 2023, losing 1–0 to Australia, one of the co-host nations of the competition, following a penalty. Ireland was then beaten by Canada, the reigning Olympic champion (1–2), after leading 1–0 for much of the first half and was mathematically eliminated after 2 days despite a good performance. The girls in green leave the competition with honors by finishing bottom of group B but with one point, after holding Nigeria (0–0) in check.\nOn September 23, 2023, the Republic of Ireland team played a match at Aviva Stadium in Dublin for the first time in its history. The match was played in front of 35,994 spectators, setting a new attendance record for a women's soccer match in Ireland (the previous record was 7,633 at Tallaght Stadium in July 2023 against France). The match is the first game of the new Women's Nations League, the national team's first game since the World Cup, and the first game since Vera Pauw's departure. The Irish won the match 3–0 against their Northern Irish neighbors.\nAfter six Nations League matches marked by six wins and promotion to Group A, Eileen Gleeson was confirmed in her position on December 18, 2023. Her assistants were confirmed in their positions in February 2024: Emma Byrne, the most capped player in history, and Colin Healy, former coach of Cork City F.C.. The second half of Gleeson's tenure proved to be much more complicated. Placed in an extremely strong Euro 2025 qualifying group with France, England, and Sweden, three major teams in European women's soccer, the Irish finished in last place despite a prestigious victory in Cork against France. Qualifying for the play-offs, the Irish lost in the final qualifying round to Wales. Following this elimination, the FAI announced that Gleeson and her staff would not be reappointed.\nHome stadium\nThroughout their history, the Republic of Ireland have played their home games at various grounds, including Dalymount Park, Tolka Park, Richmond Park and Turners Cross. They have also played the occasional game at Glenmalure Park, Belfield Park, Carlisle Grounds, Ferrycarrig Park, Flancare Park and at Lamberton, Arklow.\nWhile they have played the majority of their home games at Tallaght Stadium since 2013, the national team played their first home game at the Aviva Stadium in September 2023.\nIn 2024, the Republic of Ireland played at Páirc Uí Chaoimh for the first time in a Euro 2025 qualifier match against France.\nResults and fixtures\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n;Legend\n2024\n| score      = 1–1\n| team2      =\n| goals1     =\n* Woodham\n| goals2     =\n* Clark\n| stadium    = Cardiff City Stadium\n| location   = Cardiff, Wales\n| attendance = 16,485\n| referee    = Maria Sole Ferrieri Caputi (Italy)\n| report     = https://www.uefa.com/womenseuropeanqualifiers/match/2041668/\n| result     = D\n}}\n| score      = 1–2\n| aggregatescore = 2–3\n| team2      =\n| goals1     =\n* Patten\n| goals2     =\n* Cain\n* Jones\n| stadium    = Aviva Stadium\n| location   = Dublin, Ireland\n| attendance = 25,832\n| referee    = Marta Huerta De Aza (Spain)\n| report     = https://www.uefa.com/womenseuropeanqualifiers/match/2041675/\n| result     = L\n}}\n2025\n| goals1     =\n* Carusa\n| team2      =\n| goals2     =\n| stadium    = Tallaght Stadium\n| location   = Dublin, Ireland\n| attendance = 8,071\n| referee    = Réka Molnar (Hungary)\n| result     = W\n}}\n| goals1     =\n* Prašnikar\n* Kramžar\n* Kajzba\n| team2      =\n| goals2     =\n| stadium    = Bonifika Stadium\n| location   = Koper, Slovenia\n| attendance = 533\n| referee    = Michalina Diakow (Poland)\n| result     = L\n}}\n| goals1     =\n| team2      =\n| goals2     =\n* Sheva\n* Carusa\n* Stapleton\n* Barrett\n| stadium    = Theodoros Vardinogiannis\n| location   = Heraklion, Greece\n| attendance = 550\n| referee    = Jelena Pejković (Croatia)\n| result     = W\n}}\n| goals1     =\n* Barrett\n* Patten\n| team2      =\n| goals2     =\n* Sarri\n| stadium    = Tallaght Stadium\n| location   = Dublin, Ireland\n| attendance = 5,879\n| referee    = Franziska Wildfeuer (Germany)\n| result     = W\n}}\n| goals1     =\n* Hançar\n| team2      =\n| goals2     =\n* Şeker\n* Murphy\n| stadium    = Esenler Stadium\n| location   = Istanbul, Turkey\n| attendance = 760\n| referee    = Kristina Georgieva (Bulgaria)\n| result     = W\n}}\n| goals1     = Noonan\n| team2      =\n| goals2     =\n| stadium    = Páirc Uí Chaoimh\n| location   = Cork, Ireland\n| attendance = 9,443\n| referee    = Miriama Bočková (Slovakia)\n| result     = W\n}}\n| score      = 4–0\n| report     = https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2025/0626/1520565-girls-in-green-well-beaten-by-classy-usa-in-denver/\n| team2      =\n| goals1     =\n* Patterson\n* Coffey\n* Lavelle\n* Thompson\n| goals2     =\n| stadium    = Dick's Sporting Goods Park\n| location   = Commerce City, United States\n| attendance = 18,504\n| referee    = Vimarest Diaz (Dominican Republic)\n| result     = L\n}}\n| score      = 4–0\n| report     = https://www.fai.ie/latest/report-usa-4-0-wnt-1/\n| team2      =\n| goals1     =\n* Biyendolo\n* Rodriguez\n* Ryan\n* A.
