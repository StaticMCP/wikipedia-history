At the time of recording, Michael Lloyd was not present so the group was reduced to Bob Markley and the Harris brothers, with additional uncredited contributions from Ron Morgan. On the back of original LP release appears 'Breaking Through' and the declaration: \"Every song in this album has been written, arranged, sung and played by the group. No one censored us. We got to say everything we wanted to say, in the way we wanted to say it\".\n\"Smell of Incense\", composed by Markley and Morgan, features a slowed down pulsating bass melody similar to The Beatles' song \"Day Tripper\". The track \"Suppose They Gave a War and No One Comes\" actually copies direct quotes from an address by Franklin Roosevelt on August 14, 1936 at Chautauqua, New York.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Bob Markley and Shaun Harris, except where noted.\n# \"In the Arena\" – 4:10\n# \"Suppose They Give a War and No One Comes\" (Markley, Roger Bryant) – 3:38\n# \"Buddha\" – 2:05\n# \"Smell of Incense\" (Markley, Ron Morgan) – 5:47\n# \"Overture / Wcpaeb Part II\" – 1:28\n# \"Queen Nymphet\" – 2:19\n# \"Unfree Child\" – 3:58\n# \"Carte Blanche\" – 2:42\n# \"Delicate Fawn\" – 2:30\n# \"Tracy Had a Hard Day Sunday\" – 4:35\nSingles\n*\"Suppose They Give a War and No One Comes\" b/w \"Queen Nymphet\"\n*\"Smell of Incense\" b/w \"Unfree Child\"\nPersonnel\nWest Coast Pop Art Experimental Band\n*Bob Markley – vocals\n*Danny Harris – vocals, electric guitar\n*Ron Morgan – electric guitar (uncredited)\n*Shaun Harris – vocals, bass guitar\nAdditional musicians\n*Hal Blaine - drums\n*Jim Gordon - drums\nCovers\n* \"Suppose They Give a War and No One Comes\" covered by T.S.O.L.\n* \"Smell of Incense\" covered by Southwest F.O.B.\n* \"Tracy Had a Hard Day Sunday\" covered by The Clientele\nReferences"
