He was aged 31 and lived at St. Mary's Place, Dublin. He was one of The Forgotten Ten.\nBackground\nDoyle was involved in an arms raid on Collinstown Aerodrome in 1919. Together with Frank Flood, he was involved in planning several attempts to free Kevin Barry from Mountjoy in the days before Barry's own execution in November 1920.  Flood would later be hanged on the same morning as Doyle.\nArrest, detention and execution\nDoyle was a member of 'F' Company, 1st Battalion, Dublin Brigade, Irish Republican Army and was tried on 24 February 1921 by court-martial, charged with high treason and levying war against the King for his part in an attempted ambush at Drumcondra on 21 January that year. The six men were hanged in pairs beginning at 6 in the morning.\nHe was a carpenter and married with four children. His wife gave birth to twins shortly before his death, one of whom died on 12 March. Reportedly, she caught a chill returning from a visit to the prison. Doyle's brother Seán was killed in action at the Custom House six weeks after the execution.\nRe-interment\nHe is one of a group of men hanged in Mountjoy Prison in the period 1920-1921 commonly referred to as The Forgotten Ten. In 2001 he and the other nine, including Kevin Barry and Frank Flood, were exhumed from their graves in the prison and given a full State Funeral. He is now buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.\nReferences"
