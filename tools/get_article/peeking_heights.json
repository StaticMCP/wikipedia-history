It was  tall, had 18 pods, and was manufactured by Fabbri Group. The attraction closed in September 2017 to make way for some new Amur Tiger enclosures in a new themed area called 'Land of the Tiger' which opened in 2018 and is a retheme of the parks 'Mystic East' area, the parks log flume attraction in this area called 'Dragon Falls' was also re-themed and re-named 'Tiger Rock'.\nReferences"
