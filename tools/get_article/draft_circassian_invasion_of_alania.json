This campaign resulted in the formation of Grand Princedom of Kabardia and many central Caucasian peoples retreating into mountain gorges\nand Taulus\n| combatant1        =\n| combatant2        =  Alanians•  Ossetians•  Karachays•  Balkars\n| commander1        =  Kabard Tambiev\n| commander2        = Unknown\n| strength1         = Unknown\n| strength2         = Unknown\n| casualties1       = Unknown\n| casualties2       = Unknown\n| territory         = Formation of the Grand Principality of Great Kabarda\n}}\nBackground\nBy the early 13th century the kingdom of Alania had factually disintegrated into a large number of autonomous clans and villages ruled by infighting chiefs leading several dozen to several hundred retainers. This state of anarchy was described by the Hungarian monk Julian, who in 1236 observed that \"there are as many princes as villages, none of whom owes allegiance to another. The war there is incessant, leader against leader, village against village.\" In 1220, Genghis Khan sent his military leaders Subudei and Jebe on a campaign to reach “eleven countries and peoples”, among which were “Asut” (Alania).\nHistory\nIn the early 15th, Kabardians began to migrate to Central Ciscaucasia, Thus the bulk of the Central Caucasian population, the Alans and Karachay-Balkars retreated into the mountains, resulting in the formation of Kabardia which stretched from between eastern Kuban and Laba rivers to Terek river and the shores of the Sunzha river. By the 16th century, Circassians have established control over many lands including Gorges like Baksan, Chegem, and Cherek. bordering mountainous regions which Karachay-Balkars, Ossetians, and some Nakh peoples have settled to.\nAfter the Circassian expansion into the Central Caucasus, the feudal state of Kabardia or Eastern Circassia emerged. In Russian documents from the 16th century, Kabarda was referred to as \"Pyatigorsk Cherkasy (Circassians)\" or Kabardin Cherkasy\". in 18th and early 19th centuries, Eastern Circassia consisted of six appanage principalities, ruled by the Atazhukins, Misostovs, Bekmurzins, Kaitukins, Talustanovs, and Dzhilyakhstanovs, which ruled different parts of the Princedom of Kabardia\nAftermath\nIn the 16th century, Kabardians have finalized control over various parts of Central Caucasia, with Karachay-Balkars and Ossetians living in mountainous areas under Kabardian and Georgian suzerainty.\nIn 1562, the infamous Kabardian prince Temryuk Idar decided to end the Ossetian rule in southern Kabarda. Thus, in September of 1562, Temryuk launched a military campaign against Ossetian and Ingush societies in the Digor, Kurtatin, and Tagaur regions, as well as the Ksani Eristavate in Central Ossetia. Assisted by a contingent of 500 streltsy and 500 Cossacks from Tsardom of Russia, Temryuk’s forces captured key Ossetian nobles, including Burnat, Aznaur, Burnak, and Dudar, and occupied several settlements.\nReferences"
