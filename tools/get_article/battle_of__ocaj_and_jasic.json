Their objective was to attack the Kosovo Liberation Army forces belonging to the 138th Brigade, commanded by Agim Ramadani and Rrustem Berisha. The KLA forces were stationed at a base near Žar Koliba, or Zharr in Albanian. The VJ monitored the KLA's movements until July 28, 1998, when the KLA confronted them. The KLA managed to effectively counter any Yugoslav attacks. Positioned strategically at Gunovac and Kumarec points, KLA units inflicted significant losses on the VJ. The battle intensified as the KLA successfully cut the supply route for the VJ, thus halting their advance. Goran Ostojić then directed a new reconnaissance group to secure the Gunovac point and facilitate the arrival of the main forces. Around 4:00 pm, the reconnaissance group led by Mile Karanović encountered an attack by the KLA group, which prevented their attempt to capture the Gunovac point. Swiftly intervening, Goran Ostojić pulled the group back, and at 5:00 pm, he ordered the unit to withdraw to the base in groups. During the attempt to reestablish contact with the reconnaissance group, Goran Ostojić, driving an all-terrain vehicle, fell into an KLA ambush and was killed in the encounter.\nIn a final attempt, VJ sought to recover the body of Goran Ostojić, but found itself surrounded by several groups of KLA militants in the Junik mountains, before withdrawing towards the forrests to Junik.\nDuring the battle, three Yugoslav personnel were killed, one other sustained injuries, and two remained missing and are presumed dead. Meanwhile the KLA had three of their soldiers killed and two wounded.\nPersonnel killed in the battle\nYugoslav personnel\n* Goran Ostojić, Lieutenant colonel\n* Dragan Dušanić, Senior Sergeant\n* Srđan Stančetić, Senior Sergeant\n* Radoš Cerović, Soldier\n* Goran Todorović , Soldier, missing\nKLA personnel\n* Avdyl Jasiqi, Soldier\n* Arif Gjoci, Soldier\n* Shkelzen Gacaferi, Soldier\nReferences"
