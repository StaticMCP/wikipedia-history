They published in the journal Fundamenta Mathematicae, founded in 1920—one of the world's first specialist pure-mathematics journals. It was in this journal, in 1933, that Alfred Tarski—whose illustrious career would a few years later take him to the University of California, Berkeley—published his celebrated theorem on the undefinability of the notion of truth.\nNotable members of the Warsaw School of Mathematics have included:\n* Wacław Sierpiński\n* Kazimierz Kuratowski\n* Edward Marczewski\n* Bronisław Knaster\n* Zygmunt Janiszewski\n* Stefan Mazurkiewicz\n* Stanisław Saks\n* Karol Borsuk\n* Roman Sikorski\n* Nachman Aronszajn\n* Samuel Eilenberg\nAdditionally, notable logicians of the Lwów–Warsaw School of Logic, working at Warsaw, have included:\n* Stanisław Leśniewski\n* Adolf Lindenbaum\n* Alfred Tarski\n* Jan Łukasiewicz\n* Andrzej Mostowski\n* Helena Rasiowa\nFourier analysis has been advanced at Warsaw by:\n* Aleksander Rajchman\n* Antoni Zygmund\n* Józef Marcinkiewicz\n* Otton M. Nikodym\n* Jerzy Spława-Neyman\nSee also\n* Polish School of Mathematics\n* Kraków School of Mathematics\n* Lwów School of Mathematics\nReferences"
