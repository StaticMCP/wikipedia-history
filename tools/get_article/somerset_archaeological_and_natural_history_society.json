The society bought Taunton Castle in 1874, and leases it to Somerset County Council to house the Museum of Somerset. A substantial proportion of the items held by the Museum were originally collected by the Society. Since it opened in 2010, the Society's office and library have been located at the Somerset Heritage Centre, alongside the County Council's Heritage Service.\nHistory\nThe society was founded in 1849, by people in Taunton who had an interest in history and archaeology, and by 1851 it had 420 members. It was originally based at the Victoria Rooms in Taunton, until 1874, when the society purchased Taunton Castle for its base of operations. The castle was purchased for £2,850 () and the society funded repairs to the castle, including a new roof for the large 'Somerset Room' in 1884, the refitting of the Great Hall as a museum in 1899, and the creation of a library in 1908.\nThe society was responsible for excavations at Glastonbury Abbey during the early 20th century, but the director of excavations, Frederick Bligh Bond, was dismissed after he claimed he had been helped by ghosts of Glastonbury monks. The present museum at the castle was fitted during mid 20th century, and around the same time the 18th-century staircase from St Mary Redcliffe's vicarage was installed in the Great Hall. Taunton Castle is now leased to Somerset County Council and its museum has become the Museum of Somerset.\nPublications\nThe Society has published an annual journal, the Proceedings, since 1851 which contains scholarly papers on research into the history, archaeology and ecology of Somerset. It also, on a less regular basis, publishes books, such as an edition of ''Edmund Rack's Survey of Somerset (a late 18th-century of the county), a report on the archaeology of Taunton Castle, and three volumes on the maritime history of Somerset.\nNotable members\nProfessor Mick Aston, well-known due to his involvement with the Time Team'' archaeology programmes on Channel 4, was a member and Past President of the Society, and contributed papers to the Society's Proceedings. In his memory the society helped to establish ‘Mick Aston’s Young Archaeologists’ (MAYA), a club for young archaeologists, which is now independent.\nRobin Bush, the archivist and historian, was chairman of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society in 1983–84.\nReferences"
