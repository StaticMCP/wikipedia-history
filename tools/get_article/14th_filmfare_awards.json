It also became the first film to win all 4 major Filmfare Awards – Best Film, Best Director (for Vijay Anand), Best Actor (for Dev Anand) and Best Actress (for Waheeda Rehman).\nThe ceremony also proved to be controversial, as S. D. Burman who was nominated for Best Music Director, and Lata Mangeshkar who was nominated for Best Playback Singer for \"Aaj Phir Jeene Ki Tamanna Hai\", both for Guide, lost their respective awards to Shankar–Jaikishan and Mohammed Rafi (for \"Baharon Phool Barsao\"), both for Suraj, despite being highly-favored to win in their respective categories.\nShashikala received dual nominations for Best Supporting Actress for her performances in Anupama and Phool Aur Patthar, but lost to Simi Garewal who won the award for Do Badan.\nMain awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" colspan=2|Best Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" colspan=2|\n*' Guide – Navketan Films – Dev Anand '\n**Anupama – L.
