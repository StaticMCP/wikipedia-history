One of seven community colleges within the City University of New York (CUNY) system, Queensborough enrolls more than 12,000 attending students and more than 775 instructional faculty.\nQueensborough opened in 1959 as a campus of the State University of New York and in 1965 transferred to CUNY. The college offers more than 50 associate degree programs as well as certificate and continuing education programs. Queensborough is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\nCampus\nThe 37-acre campus was constructed on the site of the former Oakland Golf Club. It comprises ten major buildings used for instruction and extracurricular activities. Among them are the Kupferberg Holocaust Resource Center and Archives, Queensborough Performing Arts Center, the QCC Art Gallery, and an astronomy observatory.\nAcademics\nQueensborough offers the following degrees:\n*Associate in Arts (AA)\n*Associate in Science (AS)\n*Associate in Applied Science (AAS)\nTransfer curricula are designed for students who plan to continue their studies at a four-year college or professional school. These curricula are equivalent to the first two years of study at a senior college.\nCareer curricula combine preparation for a career with a grounding in general education, with many graduates entering jobs in business, health sciences, industry, or government. Although career curricula are not primarily designed to prepare students for transfer to senior institutions, many career graduates decide to continue their studies and earn the baccalaureate.\nCultural institutions\n*The Kupferberg Holocaust Center houses books, documents (including nearly 400 doctoral dissertations on microfilm), and audio-visual materials for use by students, teachers, scholars and any other interested persons.\n*The Queensborough Performing Arts Center (QPAC) was founded in 1963 and seats more than 1,000 people. QPAC underwent an extensive renovation from 2023 to 2024.\n*The QCC Art Gallery was founded in 1966 by the first chairman of Queensborough Department of Art and Photography, Priva B. Gross. In 1981, the Art Gallery opened in its present location - historic 1920s Oakland Building, former club house for the Oakland Country Club and the oldest building on campus. The Art Gallery was renovated again in 2004.\nPublications\n*The campus newspaper Communiqué is published monthly during the fall and spring semesters by the students in Introduction to Journalism.\n*The literary journal Collective is published annually during the spring semester by the students in Creative Writing Club and the English Department; it features original works created by attending students.\nAthletics\nQueensborough Community College teams participate as a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).
