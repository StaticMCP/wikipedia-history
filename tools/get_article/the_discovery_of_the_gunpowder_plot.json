It portrays the moment that the 1605 Gunpowder Plot to blow up the English Houses of Parliament was stopped. One of the plotters, Guy Fawkes, is being arrested by Sir Thomas Knevet and Edmund Doubleday.\nThe painting was displayed at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1823 at Somerset House in London. Today it is in the collection of the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, having been donated by Viscount Ridley in 1908.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Fraser, Antonia.
