The award recognises existing buildings older than 25 years since construction. The average age of the 23 awarded projects to date is 44.5 years (between 2003—2025).\nBackground\nPurpose\nThe award recognises significant, long lasting and innovative architecture with usually more than 25 years passed since the completion of construction. The Enduring Architecture Award recognises achievement for the design of buildings of outstanding merit, which have remained important as high quality works of architecture when considered in contemporary cultural, social, economic and environmental contexts.\nNomination process\nNominations for the award can be made by AIA members, non–members and non–architects, but must provide adequate material and information supporting the nomination for consideration of the jury. The nomination process is open to AIA members and public via a web portal during the awards submission window (between November and February).\nPolitical agenda of Award\nThe Enduring Architecture Award has gained an important role in highlighting conservation efforts for highly valued buildings at risk of significant changes or even demolition. Both the Sirius Building public housing project in The Rocks and the MLC Building in North Sydney had both been at risk of alteration or demolition at the hands of their owners. The AIA has used the awards to raise  public awareness of the plight of culturally significant buildings under threat, assisting in both cases to preserve the building and enhance heritage listing status.\nNational Awards\nRecipients of the state–based award are then eligible for consideration for the National Award for Enduring Architecture presented later in the same year, as part of the Australian National Architecture Awards. Between 2003 and 2023 ten of the 21 National Awards were located in New South Wales.\nAwards by year\n2024 Award\nIn February 2024 it was announced the three person jury would be formed of Caroline Pidcock (Jury Chair), Paulo Macchia (Government Architect NSW) and Leone Lorrimer (GHD). In the run up to the Awards presentation, three buildings were announced as under consideration for the 2024 Award including; St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney by Michael Fox Architects, NSW State Projects, William Wardell and Cyril Wardell; The Glass House, Castlecrag by Bill and Ruth Lucas and St Johns Village, Glebe by Hely, Bell & Horne (winner of the 1964 Sir John Sulman Medal).\nAt the NSW Architecture Awards held on 28 June 2024, The Glass House, Castlecrag was presented with the 2024 Award. The Award was accepted by Peter Lucas, son of Ruth and Bill Lucas, and builder of the recent restoration of the house completed in 2023 with Cracknell & Lonergan Architects.\n2025 Award\nIn January 2025 it was announced the three person jury would be formed of former NSW Premier, the Honorable Bob Carr (Jury Chair) with architects Helen Lochhead  and Peter McGregor (McGregor Westlake Architecture).\nAt the 2025 NSW Architecture Awards, the inner city residential development known as Moore Park Gardens was presented with the award. The project was designed by AJC Architects and completed in 2000 on the former Tooths Brewery site between South Dowling Street and Bourke Streets, Redfern.\nThe jury citation described the project \"...the site’s built form is both articulate and distinctive, with efficient planning and excellent apartment amenity that extends across towers, street edge blocks, maisonettes, and cross-overs. The robust and workmanlike material fabric shows few signs of age 25 years on, and the hundreds of residents that have maintained tenancy over this time demonstrate the ongoing success and relevance of the architecture, and the rich legacy it provides.\"\nRecipients of the Award\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | New South Wales Enduring Architecture Award (reverse order)\n|-\n!
