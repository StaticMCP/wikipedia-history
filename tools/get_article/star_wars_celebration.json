The event is usually held every one to three years in varying locations around the world, and commonly features a host of Star Wars project announcements, panel discussions featuring actors, producers and writers, screenings, exhibits, cosplay and merchandise sales.\nIt began in 1999, when Lucasfilm held the first Star Wars Celebration in Denver, Colorado to celebrate the upcoming release of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.\nHistory\nStar Wars Celebration\nCelebration I\nThe Star Wars Celebration was held from April 30 to May 2, 1999, at the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum in Denver, Colorado, just three weeks before the release of The Phantom Menace.  An event \"for the fans, by the fans,\" the event took place in the hometown of the Official Star Wars Fan Club, headed by Dan Madsen.  \"The Fan Club is based here in Denver,\" says Madsen, \"so we thought it would only be appropriate that the Celebration be held here.\"\nThe first Star Wars convention since 1987, the Celebration held activities including actor panels, THX theater demonstrations, behind the scenes footage from Episode I, and the world premiere of the \"Duel of the Fates\" music video.  The grounds boasted a vendors tent, and the museum hosted an exhibition consisting of props from the official LucasFilm archives, including a full-scale model of Anakin Skywalker's podracer and a life-size X-wing model (a 3/4 scale replica made in 1996 for the Special Edition release, and still residing at Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum).\nCelebration II\nFrom May 3 to 5, 2002, Celebration II was held to celebrate the upcoming release of Attack of the Clones and the 25th anniversary of the first theatrically released Star Wars film.  The convention was moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, to make use of the larger Indiana Convention Center.\nDowntown Indianapolis was invaded by multitudes of Star Wars fans. The initial projection of 15–20,000 people per day based on advance ticket sales was well surpassed and reached critical mass on Saturday. The estimated final tally was a little over 75,000 people for the three-day event.  The two busiest spots were the Fan Club store and the autograph section, specifically for Carrie Fisher. Highlights of the event included the Rick McCallum Spectacular and the Star Wars 25th Anniversary Concert on Saturday night, performed by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Indianapolis.\nCelebration III\nmarch at Celebration III.]]\nThe Star Wars Celebration returned to Indianapolis from April 21 to 24, 2005, to commemorate the release of what was then thought to be the final film in the saga, Revenge of the Sith. With over 34,000 fans in attendance over the course of four days, Celebration III brought actor panels, costume contests, fan films, and diorama building to the Indiana Convention Center. The Lucasfilm archive provided many important props and costumes for display. One of this Celebration's most noteworthy events was the unprecedented Q&A session with Star Wars creator George Lucas, his first such appearance since the Star Wars 10th Anniversary Convention in 1987. With approximately 10,000 fans in attendance (over the course of 3 half-hour sessions), Lucas personally answered several dozen fans' questions about the saga.\nCelebration IV\nguards an Obi-Wan bust at Star Wars Celebration IV.]]\nOn May 26, 2006, StarWars.com announced Star Wars Celebration IV (C4) to be held from May 24 to 28, 2007, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the first Star Wars film.
