They are the most successful team so far, having won five titles.\nHistory\nSuper W announced\nIn 2017, Rugby Australia announced that a national women's rugby competition would commence in March 2018, with the New South Wales Waratahs to have a women's team. The announcement was made on the same day that Rugby Australia outlined its intentions to bid for the 2021 Women's Rugby World Cup.\nInaugural season champions\nThe Waratahs Women were hosted by the Queensland Reds Women at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane for the season's opener. It was a double header with the Super Rugby match between the Queensland Reds and the Bulls.\nOn 20 April 2018, the women's New South Wales Waratahs made history by winning the first season of women's 15-a-side rugby, with captain Ashleigh Hewson kicking the winning penalty goal in the ninety-second minute. New South Wales Waratahs Women's were victorious over the Queensland Reds 16–13 at Stadium Australia.\n2024\nThe Waratahs Women went undefeated throughout the entire season before beating the Fijian Drua in the final to win their fifth Super Rugby title. Desiree Miller (rugby union) scored a hat-trick and Maya Stewart scored a double in their sides first title win since 2021.\nCurrent squad\nOn 29 January 2025, the squad for the 2025 Super Rugby Women's season was announced.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:90%; width:70%\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Waratahs Super W squad\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\nProps\n*  '''Bridie O'Gorman\n*  Emily Robinson\n*   Faliki Pohiva\n*   Georgia Chapple\n*   Seneti Kilisimasi\n*  Suisuiosalafai Volkman\nHookers\n*  Adiana Talakai\n*  Brittany Merlo\n*  Millie Parker\nLocks\n*  Annabelle Codey\n*  Atasi Lafai\n*  Jayjay Taylor\n*  Kaitlan Leaney\n*  Tahlia Morgan\n|\nLoose Forwards\n*  Emily Chancellor\n*  Leilani Nathan\n*  Piper Duck (c)\n*  Ruby Anderson\nScrum-halves\n*   Martha Harvey\n*   Tatum Bird\n*   Tiarne Cavanagh\nFly-halves\n*  Arabella McKenzie\n*  Waiaria Ellis\n|\nCentres\n*  Georgina Friedrichs\n*  Katrina Barker\n*  Jade Sheridan\n*  Nicole Nathan\nOutside Backs\n*   Amelia Whitaker\n*  Caitlyn Halse\n*  Desiree Miller\n*   Jacinta Windsor\n*  Maya Stewart\n*  Sariah Paki\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"height: 10px;\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |(c) Denotes team captain, Bold denotes internationally capped and ST indicated short-term cover.\n|}\nSeason standings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!
