In the , Oakhurst had a population of 1,717 people.\nGeography\nThe Mary River forms part of the eastern boundary.\nThe Maryborough–Biggenden Road (State Route 86) enters the locality from the east (Maryborough West) where it is known as Gayndah Road. It exits the locality to the west (Dunmora/Yengarie).\nThe North Coast railway line enters the locality from the south (Yengarie). Despite the name, the locality is served by the Maryborough West railway station (), which has replaced Maryborough railway station as the main stop serving Maryborough on the North Coast line. The station is the junction where the North Coast railway line splits into two. The new electrified main line exits the locality to the north-east (Aldershot / Maryborough West) bound ultimately for Cairns. The older not-electrified line exits the locality to the east (Maryborough West) bound for Maryborough. This line is still required to transport rolling stock to and from the Walkers Limited workshop (now operated by Downer Rail).\nThe locality is increasingly becoming a suburb of Maryborough with rural residential housing being the major land use. The remaining land is used for grazing on native vegetation and growing sugarcane.\nHistory\nOakhurst was historically served by the Oakhurst railway station (). However, Maryborough West railway station was opened in 1989 as a replacement for Maryborough and Baddow stations, when the latter was bypassed by a new seven kilometre alignment that was built as part of the electrification of the North Coast line.\nOnce, the locality of Oakhurst was split between the Shire of Woocoo and the City of Maryborough. However, on 2 July 2010, it was regazetted as being solely within the Fraser Coast Region.\nDemographics\nIn the , Oakhurst had a population of 1,444 people.\nIn the , Oakhurst had a population of 1,717 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Oakhurst. The nearest government primary  school is Sunbury State School in Maryborough to the east. The nearest government secondary school is Aldridge State High School, also in Maryborough.\nTAFE Queensland delivers vocational education at its Wide Bay campus at 65 Nagel Street ().\nAmenities\nWook-koo Park (formerly Oakhurst Park) is on the south-eastern corner of Loretta Drive and Woocoo Drive (). It offers facilities for sport, picnics and BBQs, and walking tracks. One walk features sculptures of animals.\nFacilities\nOakhurst SES Facility is at 5 Boundary Road ().\nReferences"
