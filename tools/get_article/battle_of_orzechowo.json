The Russian troops were led by Brigadier Suvorov and the Polish troops were led by Casimir Pulaski. The battle was decided by an attack by Sakharov's grenadier company and Rönne's 50 carabiniers (the latter were under the command of Captain Count Castelli). The Confederates lost up to 200 men in the battle, including 40 captured, while Russian losses were \"very small\" despite a significant numerical gap. The affair at Orzechowo put Suvorov in the first row of Russian commanders in Poland and brought him the rank of major general.\nNotes\nRefs\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
