Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nAccording to the 54th Grammy Awards guideline the Best Folk Album category includes authentic folk material in both traditional vocal and instrumental styles, as well as contemporary material by artists who use traditional folk elements, sounds and instrumental techniques as the basis for their recordings. Folk music is primarily but not exclusively acoustic, often using contemporary arrangements with production and sensibilities distinctly different from a pop approach.\nThis award - established in 2012 - combines the previously used categories for Best Contemporary Folk Album and Traditional Folk Album. The Recording Academy decided to create this new category for 2012 upon stating there were \"challenges in distinguishing between... Contemporary and Traditional Folk\".\nLike most album categories, the performing artist (of greater than 50% of playing time on the album) receives a nomination. The actual Grammy is awarded to the performing artist, the producer and the engineer/mixer.\nThe inaugural recipients of the award were The Civil Wars, who won in 2012 for their album Barton Hollow. To date, Chris Thile, Gillian Welch, and David Rawlings have won this award twice each; the latter two act as the current recipients of the award for Woodland at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards.\nRecipients\nare the inaugural winners of the award.]]\nand Abigail Washburn won the award in 2016.]]\n.]]\nand Gillian Welch.]]\n.]]\nwon in 2024 for her live album At Newport.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"7%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Winners\n! width=\"25%\" | Work\n! width=\"35%\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2012\n| The Civil Wars\n* Charlie Peacock (producer)\n* Richie Biggs (engineer/mixer)\n| Barton Hollow\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2013\n| Yo-Yo Ma, Stuart Duncan, Edgar Meyer & Chris Thile\n* Steven Epstein (producer)\n* Richard King (engineer/mixer)\n| The Goat Rodeo Sessions\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2014\n| Guy Clark\n* Shawn Camp, Guy Clark & Chris Latham (producers)\n* Chris Latham (engineer/mixer)\n| My Favorite Picture of You\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2015\n|  Old Crow Medicine Show\n* Ted Hutt (producer)\n* Ted Hutt & Ryan Mall (engineers/mixers)\n| Remedy\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2016\n| Béla Fleck & Abigail Washburn\n* Béla Fleck & Abigail Washburn (producers)\n* Richard Battaglia & Béla Fleck (engineers/mixers)\n| Béla Fleck & Abigail Washburn\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2017\n| Sarah Jarosz\n* Sarah Jarosz & Gary Paczosa (producers)\n* Shani Gandhi & Gary Paczosa (engineers/mixers)\n| Undercurrent\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2018\n| Aimee Mann\n* Paul Bryan (producer)\n* Paul Bryan & Ryan Freeland (engineers/mixers)\n| Mental Illness\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2019\n| Punch Brothers\n* Punch Brothers (producers)\n* Jason Wormer (engineer/mixer)\n| All Ashore\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2020\n| Patty Griffin\n* Patty Griffin & Craig Ross (producers)\n* Mike Pool & Craig Ross (engineers/mixers)\n| Patty Griffin\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2021\n| Gillian Welch & David Rawlings\n* David Rawlings (producer)\n* Matt Andrews & David Rawlings (engineers/mixers)\n| All the Good Times\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022\n| Rhiannon Giddens with Francesco Turrisi\n* Rhiannon Giddens & Turrisi Francesco (producers)\n* Ben Rawlins (engineer/mixer)\n|''They're Calling Me Home\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2023\n| Madison Cunningham\n|Revealer\n|\n* Judy Collins — Spellbound\n* Janis Ian — The Light at the End of the Line''\n* Aoife O'Donovan — Age of Apathy\n* The Punch Brothers — Hell on Church Street\n|\n|-\n!2024\n|Joni Mitchell\n* Joni Mitchell & Brandi Carlile (producers)\n* Brandon Bell & Sean Quackenbush (engineers/mixers)\n|At Newport (Live)\n|\n* Dom Flemons - Traveling Wildfire\n* The Milk Carton Kids - I Only See the Moon\n* Nickel Creek - Celebrants\n* Old Crow Medicine Show - Jubilee\n* Paul Simon - Seven Psalms\n* Rufus Wainwright - Folkocracy\n|\n|-\n!2025\n| Gillian Welch & David Rawlings\n* (producers and engineers/mixers tbd)\n| Woodland\n|\n* American Patchwork Quartet - American Patchwork Quartet\n* Madi Diaz - Weird Faith\n* Adrianne Lenker - Bright Future\n* Aoife O'Donovan - All My Friends\n|\n|-\n!2026\n|Winner TBA on 1 February 2026\n|\n|\n* Rhiannon Giddens & Justin Robinson - What Did The Blackbird Say to The Crow\n* Patty Griffin - Crown of Roses\n* I'm With Her - Wild and Clear and Blue\n* Jason Isbell - Foxes in the Snow\n* Jesse Welles - Under the Powerlines (April 24 - September 24)\n|\n|}\nEach year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.\nArtists with multiple wins\n;2 wins\n;* Chris Thile (one as a member of the Punch Brothers)\n;*Gillian Welch\n;*David Rawlings\nArtists with multiple nominations\n;4 nominations\n;* Rhiannon Giddens (one as a member The Carolina Chocolate Drops)\n3 nominations\n* Sarah Jarosz\n* Chris Thile (one as a member of the Punch Brothers)\n* Gillian Welch\n;2 nominations\n* Judy Collins\n* Madison Cunningham\n* Dom Flemons (one as a member of The Carolina Chocolate Drops)\n* Patty Griffin\n* Laura Marling\n* Aoife O'Donovan\n* Punch Brothers\n* Joy Williams (one as a member of The Civil Wars)\nSee also\n*List of Grammy Award categories\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.grammy.com Official Site of the Grammy Awards]"
