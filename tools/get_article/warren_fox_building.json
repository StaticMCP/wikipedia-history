The four-story brick building was built in 1884 by Warren Fox, and is a good example of commercial Queen Anne architecture.  The building is nine bays wide; brick piers rise surrounding the central bay, where the main entrance is, and rise above the level of the flat roof to form a cornice.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989; it was included in the bounds of the Lowell National Historical Park in 1978.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Lowell, Massachusetts\nReferences"
