The current head of the Presidential Honor Guard is Iván Hernández Dala.\nHistory\nThe Presidential Honor Guard was first created in Santa Cruz de Mompox by Simòn Bolivar. The structure was followed years later due to the need of rulers to maintain the presidency of Venezuela, as well as to safeguard the institutions of Venezuela.
