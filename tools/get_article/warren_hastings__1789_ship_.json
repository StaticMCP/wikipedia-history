However, in 1801, the Register of Shipping shows a change of ownership to W. Lennox in 1801, and no longer lists her in 1802. but gives no year. There is no other evidence to support the report.

Her trade was London—Botany Bay. Under the command of John Hingston, Speke sailed from Falmouth, England, on 18 May 1808 and arrived at Port Jackson on 16 November 1808. She embarked 99 female convicts, two of whom died on the voyage.\nSpeke sailed on 12 January 1809 from Port Jackson to undertake whaling or sealing.\nDuring 1809 she was whale hunting at the Derwent River.\nIn March 1810, half-a-dozen whalers gathered in Bay of Islands and launched a retributionary attack on the Maori after the Boyd massacre. The whalers killed an estimated 16 to 60 Maori and burnt some structures. One sailor was accidentally killed. The vessels involved in the attack were Atalanta, Inspector, , Perseverance, Speke, and Spring Grove.\nSpeke was at the Bay of Islands in February 1810. In March, upon hearing of the story of the Boyd massacre, a party of men from Speke, Inspector, Diana, , and Perseveance'' joined in an attack on Te Pahi's pa on Te Puna island, killing approximately 60 Māori.

She returned with more than 30 tons of sperm oil and 150 tons of black oil.\nThe Register of Shipping for 1820 shows Speke with Quinton, master, J. Short, owner, and trade London−India.

The convicts included the last prisoners from Scotland's Radical War. Spekes passengers included Hongi Hika and Waikato (two Māori chiefs), and the missionary Thomas Kendall, all three of whom were returning to New Zealand.\nBoth ''Lloyd's Register and the Register of Shipping for 1827 show Spekes master as Harrison and her owner as T. Ward or J. Ward. However, Lloyd's Register shows her trade as London transport while the Register of Shipping shows it as London—New South Wales.\nOn her third voyage carrying convicts Speke was under the command of Captain Robert Harrison. She left Sheerness on 8 August 1826 and arrived at Port Jackson on 26 November.
