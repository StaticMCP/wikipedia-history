He is the lead vocalist and sole member of the act, occasionally using a supporting band while on tour and in studio. When asked about the name Radiator King, Silvestri stated that it came from when he \"titled a friend’s painting and it was suggested to him that he use that name for his next band\".\nSilvestri has been recognized for his \"rough, heart-wrenching vocals\" and gritty sound. Established officially in 2011, Radiator King has released three studio albums, Launching Day, Document Untold, and A Hollow Triumph After All.\nRadiator King most recently toured this summer in support of A Hollow Triumph After All. During off days, Silvestri wrote and recorded new songs for a future release.
