These included a peerage, membership of the Order of the Garter, the Order of Saint John and the Order of Merit, along with numerous other British and foreign honours. These included the Order of King Abdulaziz from Saudi Arabia in 1990. She was also honoured in Kuwait in 1991.\nLife peerage\nMargaret Thatcher was given a life peerage on her standing down from the House of Commons at the 1992 general election. This allowed her a seat in the House of Lords. She took the title Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire. She sat with the Conservative Party benches.\nCoat of arms\nAs a member of the House of Lords with a life peerage, Thatcher was entitled to use a personal coat of arms. A second coat of arms was created following her appointment as Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter (LG) in 1995. Despite receiving her own arms, Thatcher sometimes used the Royal Arms instead of her own, contrary to protocol.\n}}\n| other_elements =\n| bannerimage =Garter Banner of Baroness Thatcher.svg\n| banner =The banner of Margaret Thatcher's arms used as knight of the Garter at St George's Chapel.\n| badgeimage =\n| badge =\n| symbolism = The dexter supporter is an Admiral of the Royal Navy, to commemorate the victory of the Falklands War during her premiership. The sinister supporter is Sir Isaac Newton, to recognise her earlier career as a scientist. The key and the two royal lions of England represents her tenure as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury. The tower and portcullis represents her time at the Palace of Westminster as Member of Parliament. She bore this achievement on a lozenge (as is traditional for a woman), surrounded by the circlet of the Order of the Garter (in which she was appointed in 1995); below hangs the ribbon and insignia of the Order of Merit (in which she was appointed in 1990).\n| previous_versions =\n}}\nCommonwealth honours\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+Commonwealth realms\n!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Country !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Date !!  style=\"width:55%;\"| Appointment !!  style=\"width:5%;\"| Post-nominal letters\n|-\n|  || 19708 April 2013 || Member of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council || PC\n|-\n| Commonwealth realms || 7 December 19908 April 2013 || Member of the Order of Merit || OM\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |  || 1 July 19918 April 2013 || Dame of Justice of the Order of St John || DStJ\n|-\n| 25 April 19958 April 2013 || Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter || LG\n|-\n|}\nForeign honours\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+Orders\n!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Country !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Date !!  style=\"width:55%;\"| Appointment !!  style=\"width:5%;\"| Ref.\n|-\n|  || 7 March 1991 || Presidential Medal of Freedom ||\n|-\n|  South Africa || 15 May 1991 || Grand Cross of the Order of Good Hope\n||\n|-\n|  || 24 May 1995 || Grand Cordon of the Order of the Precious Crown ||\n|-\n|  Croatia || 15 September 1998 || Grand Order of King Dimitar Zvonimir ||\n|-\n|  || 28 October 1998 || Ronald Reagan Freedom Award ||\n|-\n|  Czech Republic|| 17 November 1999 ||  Order of the White Lion, First Class ||\n|-\n|  Kazakhstan|| 31 August 2001 ||Order of Friendship, First Class ||\n|-\n|  House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies || 14 November 2003 || Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Francis I Awarded on behalf of the Catholic Church by the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies ||\n|-\n|  Lithuania|| 16 February 2008 || Grand Cross of the Order of Vytautas the Great ||\n|-\n|}\nOther distinctions\nScholastic\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+University degrees\n!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Location !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Date !!  style=\"width:40%;\"| School !! style=\"width:20%;\"| Degree\n|-\n|  || 1947 || Somerville College, Oxford || Second-Class Honours Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Chemistry\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+Chancellor, visitor, governor, rector, and fellowships\n!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Location !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Date !!  style=\"width:40%;\"| School !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Position\n|-\n|  || 19708 April 2013 || Somerville College, Oxford || Honorary Fellow\n|-\n|  || 19932000 || College of William and Mary || Chancellor\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+Honorary degrees\n!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Location !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Date !!  style=\"width:40%;\"| School !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Degree !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Gave Commencement Address\n|-\n|  || 27 February 1981 || Georgetown University|| rowspan=\"2\" | Doctor of Laws (LLD)\n|-\n|  || 1986 || University of Buckingham\n|-\n|  || 17 November 1992 || Weizmann Institute of Science|| Doctorate\n|-\n|  || 5 March 1996 || Brigham Young University|| Doctor of Public Service (DPS)\n|-\n|  || 2000 || College of William and Mary|| Doctor of Laws (LLD)\n|-\n|  || 2008 || Pepperdine University|| Doctorate\n|-25/11/1991 - DPhil University of Kuwait\n|}\nMemberships and fellowships\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Location !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Date !!  style=\"width:40%;\"| Organisation !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Position\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |  || 19758 April 2013  || Carlton Club || Honorary Member\n|-\n| 24 October 197915 May 1980  || Royal Institute of Chemistry|| rowspan=\"2\" | Honorary Fellow (Hon FRIC)\n|-\n| 15 May 19808 April 2013  || Royal Society of Chemistry\n|-\n| 1 July 19838 April 2013  || Royal Society|| Fellow (FRS)\n|-\n|  || 9 November 19838 April 2013  || Gray's Inn|| rowspan=\"2\" | Honorary Bencher\n|-\n|  || 18 June 19888 April 2013  || Law Society of Upper Canada\n|-\n|  || 20068 April 2013  || The Heritage Foundation || Patron\n|-\n|}\nFreedom of the City\n*  6 February 1980: Barnet\n*  10 January 1983: Falkland Islands\n*  26 May 1989: London\n*  12 December 1990: Westminster\n*  16 September 1998: Zagreb\n*  11 November 2000: Gdańsk\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Location !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Date !!  style=\"width:40%;\"| Organisation !!  style=\"width:20%;\"| Award\n|-\n|  || 28 February 1981  || OSS Society || William J.
