The current principal is Keiron Powell, with Tracey Hatton as Head Teacher.\nThe school day runs from 8:40 A.M. to 3:10 P.M. and uses a 5 period structure.\nHistory\nThe school was formed in 1987 by the amalgamation of Appleton Hall County Grammar School and Stockton Heath County High School. Appleton Hall became the new school's Lower Site, while Stockton Heath (known locally as Broomfields after the attached leisure centre) became the Upper Site.\nThe school previously held specialist Arts College status with additional specialisms in Science and Maths. It consistently achieves good GCSE results. The most recent OFSTED inspection judged the school to be Good.\nThe school converted to academy status on 1 December 2014, and is now part of the multi-academy trust TCAT (The Challenge Academy Trust).\nBanding system\nThe pupils are split into two bands, Stockton and Appleton. In years 7, 8 and 9 pupils typically have lessons with other members of their band.\nIn the GCSE years (10 & 11), two additional bands are introduced (independently of the original two), L and K. Pupils are split between the two bands for compulsory lessons (P.E and PSHE), but GCSE lessons are independent of this. In these two years, the original Stockton and Appleton are observed only for assemblies and pastoral periods.\nLinks and exchanges\nIn the past, the school has been linked with Soweto High School which is situated in Johannesburg, South Africa, with an exchange between pupils and teachers taking place.\nThe school continues to take part in pupil exchanges to Martha's Vineyard, and Germany.\nNotable former pupils\n* Rebekah Brooks (nee Wade), journalist and first female editor of the Sun\n* Tim Firth, playwright/screenwriter whose works include Calendar Girls\n* Ruby O'Donnell, actress who plays as Peri Lomax in Hollyoaks\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bridgewaterhigh.com/ Bridgewater High School]"
