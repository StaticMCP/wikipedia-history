Hugh, son of Henry I of France, and his wife Anne of Kiev, was Count of Vermandois, de jure uxoris, due to his marriage to Adelaide of Vermandois. In August 1096, Hugh and his small army left France in prima profectione, the first army of the third wave to leave France, and travelled to Bari, Italy, and then crossed the Adriatic Sea to the Byzantine Empire, in an armada commanded by Arnout II, Count of Aarschot. When Hugh entered Constantinople, he carried a Vexillum sancti Petri, a banner given to him by the pope, Hugh being the last such noble to carry the banner.\nThe known nobles, clergy and knights of Hugh's army include:\n* Eudes of Beaugency, Hugh's Standard-Bearer and Seneschal\n* Robert of Buonalbergo, later Constable and Standard-Bearer for Bohemond of Taranto.
