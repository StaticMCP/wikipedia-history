The Mexican vernacular structure was built in 1830 as a house with an addition in 1860. Among the people who have lived there was prominent rancher Bartolomé García, who was also one of Laredo's mayors, and who is a descendant of the town founder, Tomas Sanchez.\nOnce the Republic of the Rio Grande capitol building, it now showcases memorabilia from the short-lived Republic of the Rio Grande and displays pictures, books, and furniture from the 19th century Laredo area. There are three restored rooms re-creating an authentic 1830 home in Laredo; an office and sitting area, a bedroom, and a kitchen. Because of this Republic, Laredo had flown seven flags instead of the traditional Six flags over Texas.\nThe museum is operated by the Webb County Heritage Foundation, a non-profit 501 (c) (3) organization chartered in 1980 to promote historic preservation, education, and tourism.  The museum offers guided tours for school age children and adults year-round.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Webb County, Texas\n*Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks in Webb County\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://webbheritage.org/museums/republic-of-the-rio-grande-museum/ Republic of the Rio Grande Museum] - Webb County Heritage Foundation"
