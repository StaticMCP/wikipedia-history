There is no video counterpart to the audio recording as none of the concerts has been camera taped. The album was produced by Nick Tauber and the mixing took place at the Marquee Studios in London in August and September 1982.\nThe original double LP release of this album was the only Toyah record to be issued in a gatefold sleeve. It additionally contained an insert with Toyah's biographical discography. The album was released in early November 1982 and subsequently debuted and peaked at number 20 on the UK Albums Chart. It also reached number 1 on the UK Independent Albums Chart.\nWarrior Rock: Toyah on Tour was re-released in CD format in February 2005. In May 2024, the album was re-released by Cherry Red Records. It included the full, unabridged version of the original double album, adding previously unreleased live recordings from other dates of the 1982 tour and rehearsals material.\nTrack listing\nOriginal release\n;Side one\n# \"Good Morning Universe\" (Toyah Willcox, Joel Bogen) – 5:03\n# \"Warrior Rock\" (Willcox, Bogen, Phil Spalding) – 3:55\n# \"Danced\" (Willcox, Bogen, Peter Bush) – 7:18\n# \"Jungles of Jupiter\" (Willcox, Bogen, Spalding) – 6:23\n;Side two\n#\"It's a Mystery\" (Keith Hale) – 5:23\n#\"Castaways\" (Willcox, Bogen) – 5:20\n#\"Angel & Me\" (Willcox, Bogen) – 5:52\n#\"Brave New World\" (Willcox, Bogen) – 6:39\n;Side three\n#\"The Packt\" (Willcox, Bogen) – 7:05\n#\"Thunder in the Mountains\" (Willcox, Adrian Lee, Nigel Glockler) – 4:33\n#\"We Are\" (Willcox, Bogen) – 3:37\n#\"I Want to Be Free\" (Willcox, Bogen) – 6:38\n;Side four\n#\"Dawn Chorus\" (Willcox, Bogen, Spalding) – 5:13\n#\"War Boys\" (Willcox) – 6:04\n#\"Ieya\" (Willcox, Bogen, Bush) – 10:13\n2005 CD edition contains abridged versions of \"War Boys\" and \"Ieya\" to accommodate CD length.
