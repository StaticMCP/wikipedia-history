It sits at the south end of the short Bee Line Railroad and consists of a single residence and a grain elevator operated by the Stewart Grain Company.  The original elevator, built in 1905 and rebuilt in 1910 after a fire, still stands although it was moved 500 feet to a non-working location in 2009 for historical and sentimental reasons.\nGeography\nStewart is located at the intersection of County Road 300 North and the Bee Line Railroad, about two miles directly east of Pence.\nReferences\nWarren County Historical Society.
