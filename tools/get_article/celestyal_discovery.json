The vessel was launched on 14 September 2002 and completed on 3 April 2003.  The vessel cost $350 million. The vessel was christened AIDAaura by International model Heidi Klum on 12 April 2003 at Warnemünde. The vessel made its maiden voyage in April 2003. In 2003, the vessel was built for P&O Cruises, a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation & plc, which took over ownership of the vessel and registered the cruise ship in London, United Kingdom. In 2004, AIDAaura was acquired by Costa Crociere and the registry moved to Genoa, Italy and the operator changed to AIDA Cruises, a subsidiary of the Carnival Corporation.\nOn 8 October 2018, AIDAaura departed from Hamburg on a 117-day round-the-world cruise. The ship visited 41 ports in 20 countries on four continents. AIDAaura, with about 1,200 people on board, was held on 3 March 2020 in the harbor of Haugesund, Norway, while two asymptomatic German passengers were tested who had been in contact with a person who subsequently developed COVID-19; their test results were negative.\nIn January 2023 AIDA Cruises said that the ship would be decommissioned in autumn 2023.
