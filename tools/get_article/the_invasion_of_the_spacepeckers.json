It was released by Break Records on vinyl and tape in December 1984, by Polydor Records in 1985, and unofficially by First Town Records on CD in 1995. The album also contained a large \"Happy Birthday\" calendar, in which children could write birthday wishes to their friends. In 1985, the album was released at the Midem music festival, and went on to sell 1.1 million copies. Video Kids received the RIAA Gold Record Award and Conamus Export Award for their international success with the album.\nTwo music videos for \"Woodpeckers from Space\" and \"Do the Rap\" were produced and released, both of which feature Peter Slaghuis, Bianca Bonelli, and Tico Tac, the band's cartoon mascot.\nOn 22 April 2014, The Invasion of the Spacepeckers was released by MiruMir Music Publishing in Russia. The reissued album included the original \"Happy Birthday\" calendar and Tico Tac: Spacepecker (a promotional comic strip drawn by Bjørn Frank Jensen), and expanded artwork recreated from the original art by Daniel Maslovsky. Maslovsky was also the producer of the album. He did an interview with Aart Mol, which was later published on Zvuki as part of a promotional campaign for the album's release. It also included a comic strip named Tico Tac: The Woodpecker from Space. The album was reissued again in 2024 on Maslovsky's new label Maschina Records in Estonia, on 2CD with rare tracks and unreleased mixes on 29 January 2024, and on different coloured LP records on Bandcamp on 2 February 2024 and in March.\nTrack listing\nOfficial tracks\n;Side A\n#\"Do the Rap\" (4:11)\n#\"Cartooney Tunes\" (incl. \"Happy Birthday\") (4:20)\n#\"La Bamba\" (4:15)\n#\"I'm a Rock n' Roll Pecker\" (2:05)\n#\"Communication Outerspace\" (3:06)\n;Side B\n#\"Woodpeckers from Space\" (5:54)\n#\"Give Me That Banana\" (4:04)\n#\"Do You Like Surfing?\" (3:17)\n#\"Sky Rider\" (3:13)\n;Bonus tracks (2024 reissue)\n#\"Woodpeckers from Space\" (1984 7\" Version)\n# \"Rap and Sing-Along\" (1984 7\" Version)\n# \"Rap and Sing-Along\" (1984 12\" Version)\n# \"Do the Rap\" (1985 7\" Version)\n# \"Do the Rap\" (1985 12\" Version)\n# \"Happy Birthday\" / \"Sky Rider\" (1985)\n# \"Pink Panther's Motion\" (1986, originally released by Magical Ring Records)\n# \"The Man From Santiago\" (1985, originally released on Question Mark's Famous Tunes by Boni Records)\n;Woodpeckers from Space (remixes '86-'01, 2024 reissue)\n#\"Woodpeckers from Space\" (1986 7\" Version) by S.
