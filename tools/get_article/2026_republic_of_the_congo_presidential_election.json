Incumbent president Denis Sassou Nguesso has been in power since 1997, and removed the age limit for the president in 2015. The Rally for Democracy and Development, Movement of Republicans, and the People's Party formed the Alliance for Democratic Alternation in 2026 to contest the election.\nElectoral system\nThe President of the Republic of the Congo is elected for a five-year term, with the possibility of a maximum of two re-elections. In the election, only the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of valid votes is elected. If no candidate reaches that majority, the two candidates with the highest votes face a second round twenty-one days after the results are announced by the Constitutional Court. The age limit of 70 years was removed by a referendum in 2015. A revision of the electoral rolls began in September 2025 and will last until December.\nBackground\nDenis Sassou Nguesso has been president of the Republic of the Congo since 1997, and previously held the position from 1979 to 1992. He won the 2002, 2009, 2016, and 2021 elections.\nThe 2021 election was boycotted by the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS). Freedom House gave the Republic of the Congo a 2/40 for political rights in its 2024 report.\nCandidates\nIn 2023, the Rally for Democracy and Development (RDD), Movement of Republicans (MR), and the People's Party (PAPE) formed a united opposition, the Alliance for Democratic Alternation in 2026 (2AD2026). RDD was the political party of Joachim Yhombi-Opango, who served as president from 1977 to 1979.\nLassy Mbouity, the leader of Les Socialistes Congolais, declared his candidacy for the election. However, he was kidnapped on 11 May 2025.\nNguesso's son Denis-Christel Sassou Nguesso was elected to the National Assembly. It is believed that Nguesso is grooming his son to succeed him.\nReferences"
