The official residence of the president is at Boyana Residence, Sofia. After the completion of the second round of voting, candidate Rumen Radev was elected President of Bulgaria on 13 November 2016.\nIn Bulgaria, the president's role is primarily as a symbolic figure, with the main function being to be the 'arbitrator' of disputes between Bulgaria's different institutions. They are not considered head of government or part of the nation's executive power. However, in the absence of a prime minister, presidents are in charge of appointing an interim administration, giving them considerable influence over the government during such periods (Zhelyu Zhelev in 1994-95; Petar Stoyanov in 1997; Rosen Plevneliev in 2013 and 2014; and Rumen Radev in 2017, 2021, and since 2022). On some occasions, the president has appointed the prime minister as well.  The president is elected for a five-year term and is restricted to two terms, even if they are non-successive. After an individual has served two terms as president, that individual will forever be barred from being elected to the presidency again under the rules set out by Bulgaria's Constitution. The president addresses the nation on national television annually on New Year's Eve, just moments before the start of the new year.\nElection\nEligibility for election\nFor a Bulgarian citizen to be able to run for the office of President of Bulgaria, they must fulfil the following conditions:\n*Must be a Bulgarian citizen by birth\n*Must be at least 40 years old\n*Must have lived in Bulgaria for the five years prior to the candidacy\n*Must fulfil all conditions that would be required for election as a representative to Bulgaria's National Assembly\nElectoral system\nThe president is elected directly by the Bulgarian people in a two-round majoritarian election. If a candidate manages to obtain more than 50% of the vote and the voter turnout was at least 50% in the first round, that candidate is elected. If no candidate manages to obtain more than 50% of the vote or the voter turnout was lower than 50% in the first round, then the two top-performing candidates face off in a second round with first-past-the-post voting, with the candidate receiving the larger number of votes considered elected.\nRestrictions\nThe president is banned from also being a member of the National Assembly, as well taking on any other government, public or private offices for the duration of his term. The president is also constitutionally forbidden from being involved in a leadership position of a political party while in office. In practice, despite the fact that most candidates for president are elected from a political party's list and despite the fact that the Constitution doesn't forbid the president from being an ordinary member of a political party, it is widely expected in Bulgarian society that the president be above politics. For this reason, the president-elect is expected to give up any membership in a political party.\nPowers and privileges\nThe president of Bulgaria has a number of functions and powers that are regulated in Chapter 4 of the 1991 Constitution of Bulgaria. The president is elected directly by a popular vote for a period of five years which is renewable.\nPresidential powers\nThe following powers belong to the president of Bulgaria:\n*The ability to give, restore or revoke Bulgarian citizenship, as well as refugee status.\n*Appoint and dismiss senior government officials\n*Exercise the right to pardon convicted criminals, as well as forgive 'uncollectible' debts owed to the government\n*Rename villages, towns and cities, as well as objects of national importance\n*Act as Supreme commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian Armed Forces\n*Represent Bulgaria at home and abroad\n*Schedule the National and local elections within the intervals designated by law\n*Veto any bill coming from the National Assembly by refusing to sign it after its passage in the assembly.\n*Declares war, martial law or any other state of emergency (This is done with the assistance of the Consultative Council on National Security)\n*Grant and award the orders, decorations, and medals of Bulgaria\nImmunity\nThe president enjoys blanket legal immunity during his tenure and is not held responsible for any act performed while on duty, with the exception of treason or violation of the Bulgarian constitution. His authority may only be stripped via impeachment and may not be removed by any other institution. The president cannot be detained and may not be prosecuted.\nList of presidents of Bulgaria (1990–present)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=text-align:center;\n|+\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Portrait\n! scope=col | Name\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Term\n! scope=col colspan=2 | Party\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Endorsing parties\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Election\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Vice President\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=\"3\" | 1\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" data-sort-value=\"Zhelyu, Zhelev\" | Zhelyu Zhelev\n| rowspan=\"3\" | –\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color:\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" | SDS\n| rowspan=\"3\" | DPS\n| class=nowrap | 1990\n| Atanas Semerdzhiev\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1992\n|Blaga Dimitrova\n|-\n|Vacant:July 6, 1993January 22, 1997\n|-\n! scope=row | 2\n|\n| data-sort-value=\"Petar, Stoyanov\" | Petar Stoyanov\n| –\n| style=\"background-color:\" |\n| SDS\n| DPSBZNSDP(as ODS)\n| 1996\n| Todor Kavaldzhiev\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=\"2\" | 3\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| data-sort-value=\"Georgi, Parvanov\" rowspan=\"2\" | Georgi Parvanov\n| rowspan=\"2\" | –\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:|\n| rowspan=\"2\" | BSP\n| DPS\n| 2001\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Angel Marin\n|-\n|DPSNDSV\n|2006\n|-\n! scope=row| 4\n|\n| data-sort-value=\"Rosen, Plevneliev\" | Rosen Plevneliev\n| –\n| style=\"background-color:\" |\n| GERB\n| -\n| 2011\n| Margarita Popova\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=\"2\" | 5\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| data-sort-value=\"Rumen, Radev\" rowspan=\"2\" | Rumen Radev\n| rowspan=\"2\" | –Incumbent\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Independent\n| BSP\n| 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Iliana Iotova\n|-\n|BSPITNIBG-NIPP\n|2021\n|}\nLiving former presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name!!Mandate!!Date of birth\n|-\n|Petar Stoyanov\n|1997 – 2002\n|\n|-\n|Georgi Parvanov\n|2002 – 2012\n|\n|-\n|Rosen Plevneliev\n|2012 – 2017\n|\n|}\nThe most recent death of a former president was that of Zhelyu Zhelev (1990–1997), who died on January 30, 2015 at the age of 79.\nVice president\nThe president is assisted in these duties by the vice president of Bulgaria. The vice president replaces the president in case of absence. Only upon the death, resignation, removal from office or disability of the president,  the vice president assumes the presidential powers & duties, until elections are held. The Constitution permits the president to delegate to the vice president the powers to appoint and dismiss certain officials, issue pardons and amnesty, provide citizenship and refugee status, but does not allow the president to delegate any of his other powers., enjoys the same privileges of immunity as the president and can only be dismissed from his office under the same procedures as those regarding the president.\nTermination of office\nAccording to the constitution, the mandate of the president is completed if and when:\n*The presidential term expires\n*The president resigns before the Constitutional Court\n*The president is permanently unable to perform his/her duties due to serious illness\n*The president dies while in office\n*The president is impeached\nImpeachment\nImpeachment can only begin if the president has committed treason or has violated the Constitution of Bulgaria. Impeachment starts after at least a quarter of the members of the National Assembly deposit an accusatory act before the assembly. The act must then be approved by a supermajority of 2/3 of all elected representatives in order to be accepted. If accepted, the case is referred to the Constitutional Court of Bulgaria, which must decide within a one-month time span whether or not the president is guilty of the crime he has been accused of by the Assembly. If the constitutional court finds that the president has committed treason or violated the constitution, as per the accusatory act, then the president is considered successfully impeached and is stripped of his authority.\nBulgarian presidential line of succession\n*1.
