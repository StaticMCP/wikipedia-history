Combatants were Jicarilla Apache warriors, and their Ute allies, against the United States Army. The skirmish was fought as result of the pursuit of the Jicarilla after the Battle of Cieneguilla just over a week earlier.\nSee also\n*Navajo Wars\n*Apache Scouts\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Gorenfeld, Will, The Battle of Cieneguilla, Wild West magazine, Feb., 2008\n* Bennett, James A., Forts & Forays: A dragoon in New Mexico, 1850–1856, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1996, p 53"
