It was readopted as the national flag after the rebels' victory.]]\nDuring the early stages of the Libyan Civil War of 2011, the Gaddafi regime was still in power: but there was widespread withdrawal of support for that regime by influential persons and organisations within the country. Among those who no longer supported the regime, the main concern they expressed was about what they regarded as its use of excessive force against peaceful protestors. There were resignations by many ministers of the governing council and other senior officials, diplomats posted abroad, and senior military officers. Islamic clerics, tribal leaders, and members of the former royal family expressed their opposition, while the two leading Libyan oil companies also withdrew support for the regime.\nGovernment resignations\nThis is a list of officials who resigned or refused to take orders from the Gaddafi regime during the 2011 Libyan civil war.\nMinisters\n*Minister for Immigration and Expatriates Ali Errishi, resigned 20 February 2011\n*Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil, resigned 21 February 2011.

He has dismissed talk of a civil war saying \"The Libyan people and the tribes have proven they are united\".\nQuestioned about what shape a new government could take, and whether the 1951 royal constitution could be revived, Senussi said that such questions are \"premature and are issues that are to be decided by the Libyan people,\" adding that for now the priority is to stop the \"killing of innocent people.\" On whether he desires to return to Libya he says \"The Senussi family considers itself as in the service of the Libyan people.\" When asked about reestablishing the monarchy, he stated that he \"is a servant to Libyan people, and they decide what they want\".\nThe White House said it will not specify which individuals and groups it is working and reaching out with, when asked if it supports Senussi's calls for international support.\nIn an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat, he stated that it is too early to answer if the monarchy in Libya could be restored and if he will be active in Libyan politics.

According to one resident, \"The rebels are worse than rats. NATO is the same as Osama bin Laden.\" According to another local woman, \"We lived in democracy under Muammer Gaddafi, he was not a dictator. I lived in freedom, Libyan women had full human rights. It isn't that we need Muammer Gaddafi again, but we want to live just as we did before.\" A local elderly woman stated \"They are killing our children. Why are they doing this? For what? Life was good before!\"\nReferences"
