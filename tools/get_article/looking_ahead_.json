The album features bassist Buell Neidlinger, drummer Denis Charles, and vibraphonist Earl Griffith.\nReception\nThe AllMusic review by Brian Olewnick states: \"Looking Ahead! does just that while still keeping several toes in the tradition. It's an amazing document of a talent fairly straining at the reins, a meteor about to burst onto the jazz scene and render it forever changed... Looking Ahead! is a vital recording from the nascence of one of the towering geniuses of modern music and belongs in any jazz fan's collection\".\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 3½ stars, commenting: \"the most pensive of Taylor's early recordings may be the best place to start in appreciating his music,\" and noting that \"Toll\" \"embarks on a new journey towards his own territory.\"\nTrack listing\n:All compositions by Cecil Tayor except as indicated\n# \"Luyah!
