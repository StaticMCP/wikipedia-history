However, the Hall of Fame does not have him on the rosters of any of the 1949 games. RSSSF also does not list him on the rosters for the 1949 games.[https://www.rsssf.org/tablesu/usa-intres-det69.html USA - Details of International Matches 1885-1969]  To make matters more uncertain, RSSSF and the Hall of Fame do not agree on the U.S. lineups. However, the Hall of Fame historian, Colin Jose, has Whatford starting the game before coming off for Pete Matevich on his personalweb site.\nHe attended SUNY Brockport where he played on the men's soccer team from 1946 to 1949. He was a 1947 first team and a 1948 second team All American.  He was also the co-captain in 1949.  He graduated in 1950 and was inducted into the Brockport Hall of Fame in 1995. He died in 2007.\nReferences"
