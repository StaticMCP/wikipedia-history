It is found in tropical Africa.\nThe shining-blue kingfisher was described of by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850  and given its current binomial name Alcedo quadribrachys. The name Alcedo is the Latin word for a \"kingfisher\". The specific epithet quadribrachys is from the Latin quadri- for \"four\" and brachium meaning \"arms\" or in this case \"toes\".\nThe shining-blue kingfisher is one of seven species in the genus Alcedo and is most closely related to the half-collared kingfisher (Alcedo semitorquata).\nThere are two subspecies:\n* A. q. quadribrachys Bonaparte, 1850 – Senegal and Gambia to west central Nigeria\n* A. q. guentheri Sharpe, 1892 – southern Nigeria to Kenya, northwest Zambia and north Angola\nShining-blue kingfisher (Alcedo quadribrachys quadribrachys) Ankasa 2.jpg|A. q. quadribrachys, Ghana\nShining_blue_kingfisher.jpg|A. q. guentheri, Uganda\n, 1892]]\nReferences"
