He, along with other pioneers, harvested the timber along the Blackall Range. When the timber was harvested, the bark was stripped, making them slippery from the sap and a sharp point was made on one end of the tree. The tree was then pushed over the eastern side of the cliff down \"chutes\" (to be collected at the bottom, and transported to the nearest mills). Landers Shoot (a corruption of Lander's Chute) was the base region where the logs arrived at the base of the cliff.\nLander's Shoot State School opened on 17 February 1914 and closed on 31 December 1944. It was at approx 471 Upper Landershute Road ().\nDemographics\nIn the , Landers Shoot had a population of 252 people.\nIn the , Landers Shoot had a population of 308 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Landers Shoot.
