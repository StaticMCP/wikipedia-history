It is based on a novel of the same title by Maurice Dekobra. It was shot at the Joinville Studios of Pathé in Paris and on location at the Musée Albert-Kahn in Billancourt and in Rochefort-en-Yvelines and Villefranche-sur-Mer. The film's sets were designed by the art directors André Barsacq and Léon Barsacq.\nSynopsis\nThe film is set in the Yoshiwara, the red-light district of Tokyo, in the nineteenth century. It depicts a love triangle between a high-class prostitute, a Russian naval officer and a rickshaw man.\nReception\nThe film was Ophüls' greatest pre-war French financial success. Yoshiwara proved controversial in Japan where the government objected to the depiction of Japanese brothels and banned it. There was a negative reaction against the two Japanese actors who had starred in the film, and they were labelled as traitors.\nCast\n* Pierre Richard-Willm as Lieutenant Serge Polenoff\n* Sessue Hayakawa as Ysamo, Kuli\n* Michiko Tanaka as Kohana\n* Roland Toutain as Pawlik\n* Lucienne Le Marchand as Namo\n* André Gabriello as Pô\n* Camille Bert as Le commandant\n* Foun-Sen as Geisha\n* Philippe Richard as L'attaché russe\n* Ky Duyen as L'agent secret\n* Georges Saillard as Le médecin\nReferences\nBibliography\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\nExternal links\n*"
