He was also involved in establishing the University of Northern British Columbia. He played a prominent role in the Interior University Society, the regional organization whose pressure led to the creation of UNBC, and subsequently served on the Implementation Council and the Interim Governing Council, the predecessor to the Board of Governors.\nJohn was the First Nations representative to the First Ministers Conference on aboriginal constitutional rights from 1983 to 1987. In 1991, along with the late Squamish Chief Joe Matthias, he helped to create the First Nations Summit, the organization representing the British Columbia First Nations involved in treaty negotiations with Canada and British Columbia. This group produced the tripartite Task Force Report that led to the current British Columbia Treaty Process.\nIn June 2016 John was elected to his eleventh term on the Task Group (political executive) of the First Nations Summit, of which he has been a member almost continuously since 1993. His position on the Task Group ended in June 2019 when he chose not to run again. From June through mid-November 2019 he served as an adviser to the First Nations Summit.\nOn November 1, 2000 he was appointed to the provincial cabinet as Minister for Children and Families, serving until the change of government in June 2001.

The alleged criminal acts date to 1974 and involve the same woman, whose identity is protected by court order. The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council issued a statement indicating that as the matter is before the courts it would have no comment. On July 8, 2020 he entered a plea of not guilty. His trial began in provincial court in Prince George on July 25, 2022. On the second day of the trial, the complainant broke down under cross-examination by John's lawyer, who brought out inconsistencies in her testimony and produced a photograph showing that John had long hair at the time, contradicting her testimony that his hair was short. After an extended consultation with the complainant the Crown determined that the prospects for conviction were poor and entered a stay of proceedings, dropping the charges.\nElectoral results\nReferences\nExternal links\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20050403195626/http://www.fns.bc.ca/about/e_john.htm\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20050213112021/http://bcands.bc.ca/patrons/john.html\n*https://www.ydli.org/cultinfo/bios.htm#edjohn\n*https://www.un.org/apps/news/newsmakers.asp?NewsID=66#.UFac0GaqoUM text of UN interview\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS3azPGdPgk video of interview with Rosalba Nattero"
