A Polish insurgent unit clashed with a detachment of the Imperial Russian Army, which was sent there from Krasnystaw. The battle began at 10:30 a.m., and lasted several hours, ending in Polish victory. The insurgents lost 11 men, while Russian losses were 23 killed.\nSources\n* Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe. Warszawa: Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1983. ."
