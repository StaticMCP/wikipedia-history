It is one of nine national research universities (NRU) in Thailand. It is in Bang Mot Sub-district, Thung Khru District, Bangkok. It was founded on 18 April 1960, making it the third oldest engineering school and seventh oldest university in Thailand.\nHistory\nKing Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi can trace its origin to the Thonburi Technical College (TTC) which was established on 4 February 1960, by the Department of Vocational Education, Ministry of Education. TTC had the mission of training technicians, technical instructors, and technologists. By virtue of the Technology Act, enacted 21 April 1971, three technical institutes are under the Department of Vocational Education: Thonburi Technical Institute (TTI), North Bangkok Technical Institute, and Nonthaburi Telecommunication Institute. They were combined to form one degree-granting institution under the name King Mongkut's Institute of Technology (KMIT) spread across three campuses. TTC thus became KMIT Thonburi campus. In 1974, KMIT was transferred from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of University Affairs.\nA new technology act was enacted 19 February 1986: the three campuses of KMIT became three autonomous institutes, each having university status. KMIT Thonburi campus became King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Thonburi (KMITT).\nKMITT purchased  of land to expand the campus.\nSymbol\nThe university's formal seal is the personal seal of King Mongkut, also known as Rama IV. In the middle of the seal is the Great Crown of Victory, the most important of the five royal regailia of Thailand: the great crown of victory; the sword of victory; the royal staff; the royal slippers; and the royal fan and royal fly whisk) It has a white tiered umbrella of kingship bracing both sides. All of the symbols are displayed in a two-layered circle with text both in Thai and English showing the name of the university. This seal is used for announcements and official documents and is included in all of the ceremonies of the university.\nThe flower of King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi is \"Thammaruksa\", a flower that can easily be found on campus. The university color imitates that of the flower.\nFaculties and Schools\nKMUTT has the following Faculties and Schools along with their respective departments and offices:\nFaculty of Engineering (UFO)\nThe Faculty of Engineering consist of 13 departments and 1 office:\n* Office of the Dean\n* Department of Biological Engineering\n* Department of Chemical Engineering\n[1] GNU's Bulletin Mr Wanlop Sanajumnong\n* Department of Civil Engineering\n* Department of Computer Engineering\n* Department of Control System and Instrumentation Engineering\n* Department of Electrical Engineering\n* Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering\n* Department of Environmental Engineering\n* Department of Food Engineering\n* Department of Mechanical Engineering\n* Department of Production Engineering\n* Department of Tool and Materials Engineering\nFaculty of Science (FSci)\nThe Faculty of Science consist of 6 departments and 1 office:\n* Office of the Dean\n* Department of Chemistry\n* Department of Mathematics\n* Department of Microbiology\n* Department of Physics\n* Department of Scientific Instrument Center for Standard and Industry\nFaculty of Industrial Education and Technology (FIET)\nThe Faculty of Industrial Education and Technology consist of 4 departments and 3 offices:\n* Department of Civil Technology Education\n* Department of Electrical Technology Education\n* Mechanical Technology Education\n* Department of Production Technology Education\n* Educational Communication and Technology Department\n* Division of Computer and Information Technology\n* Department of Printing and Packaging Technology\nSchool of Liberal Arts (SoLA)\nSchool of Liberal Arts consist of 2 offices:|QS_W=901-950|QS_W_ref=|QS_W_year=2026}}\nSIT students study in two locations at KMUTT: classroom building 2 on third floor and the SIT building. The classroom building 2 is divided into seven classrooms and two common rooms that have computers, and the SIT building has five training rooms and three labs for relaxation or working. On the second floor, there is a private SIT library with technical books. Most classes have a teacher assistant to help student with lessons.\nPrograms offered here range from undergraduate to PHD. The bachelor's degree is divided into information technology and computer science (which are taught in English).\nIn August 1995, the first Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree was offered. In April–June 2000, the first Computer Science courses (in English) for a bachelor's degree and a master's degree were offered. Later, the Master's and Doctor course in Information Technology was offered. In May 2002, an E-Learning project opened, which provided students with the opportunity to view lessons on DVD and CD. The project was expanded so that students could prepare or repeat lessons, on demand, on the Internet. In June 2004, master's degree courses in Software Engineering were first offered to students.\nSchool of Architecture and Design (SoA+D)\nThe School of Architecture and Design consist of 2 offices:\n* President Office\n* Media Arts and Technology\nSchool of Energy Environment and Materials (SEEM)\nThe School of Energy Environment and Materials consist of 7 offices and 1 laboratory:\n* President Office\n* Energy Technology\n* Energy Management Technology\n* Materials Technology / Integrated Product Design and Manufacturing\n* Environmental Technology\n* Thermal Technology\n* Polymer Processing and Flow Research Group (P-PROF)\n* EnConLab ( Energy Conservation Laboratory)\nSchool of Bioresources and Technology (SBT)\nThe School of Bioresources and Technology consist of 3 offices:\n* President Office\n* Biotechnology\n* Postharvest Technology\nJoin Graduate School of Energy and Environment (JGSEE)\nInstitute of Field Robotics (FIBO)\nThe Institute of Field Robotics consist of 1 office:\n* President Office\nGraduate School of Management and Innovation (GMI)\nThe Graduate School of Management and Innovation consist of 1 office:\n* President Office\nCollege of Multidisciplinary Sciences (DDCT)\nStudent life\nThe sports complex includes, among other facilities, a gymnasium, a basketball court, a football field, a table tennis facility and a tennis court.\nLibrary of King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi is the management Central Office library, and information technology to support the mission of the university to provide education, promote research, development, technical education and service to the society.\nKMUTT residence is an independent, non-profit organization in cooperation with the University administration.\nThere are student activities and sports services, sports equipment borrowing services such as football, volleyball etc., outdoor sports fields and indoor sports field.\nCampuses\nBangmod main campus\nBang Mot is the main campus of KMUTT, in Thonburi on Prachauthit Road.
