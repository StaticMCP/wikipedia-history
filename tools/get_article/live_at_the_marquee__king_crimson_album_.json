It was the first release from the King Crimson Collector's Club, in October 1998, and includes liner notes by the band's guitarist, Robert Fripp.\nThe last track, recorded at Fairfield Halls, Croydon a few months later, is the only known recording of the song \"Trees\", which includes music that would later appear in both \"A Man, A City\"/\"Pictures of a City\" from In the Wake of Poseidon and \"Wishbone Ascension\" from McDonald and Giles. This track is sourced from an even lower quality bootleg than the Marquee recording.\nTrack listing\n#\"21st Century Schizoid Man\" (Fripp, McDonald, Lake, Giles, Sinfield) – 6:22\n#\"Drop In\" (Fripp, McDonald, Lake, Giles) – 5:42\n#\"I Talk to the Wind\" (McDonald, Sinfield) – 5:18\n#\"Epitaph\" (Fripp, McDonald, Lake, Giles, Sinfield) – 3:20\n#\"Mantra\" [not listed] (Fripp, McDonald, Lake, Giles) – 7:33\n#\"Travel Weary Capricorn\" (Fripp, McDonald, Lake, Giles, Sinfield) – 3:33\n#\"Improv\" (Fripp, McDonald, Lake, Giles) – 12:29\n#:including \"Nola\" (Felix Arndt) and \"Étude No 7\" (Matteo Carcassi)\n#\"Mars\" (Gustav Holst, arr. by Fripp, McDonald, Lake, Giles) – 8:30\n#\"Trees\" (Fripp, McDonald, Lake, Giles, Sinfield) – 18:44\nPersonnel\nKing Crimson\n*Robert Fripp – electric guitar\n*Ian McDonald – alto saxophone, flute, Mellotron, vocals\n*Greg Lake – bass guitar, lead vocals\n*Michael Giles – drums, percussion, vocals\n*Peter Sinfield – illumination, live sound mixing\nProduction personnel\n*Alex R.
