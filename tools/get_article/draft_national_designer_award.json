Since its establishment in 2017, the program has recognized talent across various stages of a designer's career, from students to established professionals. A central theme of the awards is the promotion of Indian handloom and artisan crafts.\nHistory and Themes\nThe awards often align with national initiatives. For its sixth season in 2024, the event adopted the theme Vocal for Local to emphasize indigenous textile crafts. Media reports describe the WDF's goal as providing a platform for handloom weavers and artisans within the mainstream fashion industry.\nPast events have drawn participants from across the country. The 2023 awards, for example, included a winner from Ranchi, Nidhi Kumar. Students from institutions like GITAM University have also been recognized, alongside designers from cities such as Indore.\nReferences\n:Category:Indian fashion\n:Category:Awards established in 2017\n:Category:Indian awards\n:Category:Fashion awards"
