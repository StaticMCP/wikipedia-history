The script for the series was written by Reshma Ghatala, who worked as an executive producer in Menon's production house Ondraga Entertainment, while one of Menon's protege Prasath Murugesan was also signed to direct a few episodes. It was produced by Times Studio Originals, a subsidiary production house of The Times Group for web content, along with Gautham Menon's Ondraga Originals.\nWriting\nA source close to the director stated that \"Menon has planned to direct three seasons of the biopic, which covers the life story of Jayalalithaa through thirty episodes. The first season is based on Jayalalithaa's entry to politics, which chronicles her life from 12 to 44 years. Based on the reception of the first season, the consecutive seasons will be planned. So far, many Tamil  were criticized for the below par production values but Gautham clearly told his producers that he will not compromise with the quality. Gautham also got several unknown stories on Jayalalithaa through her close friends and associates.\"\nIn an interview with India Today, Menon stated that the series is a fictional story based on Anita Sivakumaran's novel Queen, which is based on the life of the politician and does not have any resemblance to her life, but instead Menon inspired the characters from the novel. Initially he planned to direct the biopic as a feature film, but due to the restrictions in censor board, Menon preferred to direct it as series. One of the production executives stated about Menon's interest in his foray through digital space, which is one of the reason as Menon, preferred to do a series about the politician.

Lakshmi of The Times of India gave four out of five stars to the series and stated \"There is a beautiful romance, some amazingly showcased tension between principle characters, but there are also those long pauses and overtly philosophical dialogues which would have been okay if we had more flesh to bite into. Some of the characters could have been given more perspective. Each episode is almost an hour-long, and that's clearly enough time to develop some of these characters and situations that are known to all.\" S. Subhakeerthana of The Indian Express gave three-and-a-half out of five and added \"Queen works well as a . The suspense at the end of each episode keeps you invested in the characters. The actors are superb, the detailing is layered and great, and the chemistry so natural that it doesn't hinder the proceedings. The  is largely riveting, and the craft is as unobtrusive as possible.\"\nRanjani Krishnakumar of Firstpost stated \"If you can look past the biased hero-ing of a controversial figure, Queen is exceptional craft. Over eleven episodes, about 50 minutes each, Queen holds the attention of the viewer, in spite of its slow and lingering style.\" Manasa Rao of The News Minute reviewed \"Rather than a factual retelling, much of the show is based on the anecdotal tales that have done the rounds of Tamil Nadu's political and film circles for decades and are now the overpowering ghosts in the biographical narratives about these leaders.\"\nSudhir Srinivasan of The New Indian Express stated \"Queen is a rare-good Tamil , but it would have helped us stop worrying about making inevitable comparisons with Jayalalithaa's life, about viewing the series with knowledge of the highlights of her life.\" Janani K of India Today wrote \"Queen is a must-watch  that is a hit because of its strong writing, brilliant performances and exceptional technicality.\" Prathyush Parasuraman of Film Companion South reviewed \"MX Players’ 11 episode  could have been a dramatic demand for justice. It ends up being reflective, sometimes, agonizingly so.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Date of ceremony\n!Award\n!Category\n!Recipient(s) / nominee(s)\n!Result\n!\n|-\n|8 December 2020\n|Singapore's Asian Academy Creative Awards\n|Best Series\n|Queen\n|\n|\n|}\nControversies\nOn 13 September 2019, Jayalaithaa's nephew Deepak Jayakumar raised objection to the series, as the makers did not approve their consent of the family members to shoot the personal life of the politician. Deepak planned to send a legal notice against the makers. In November 2019, Deepa Jayakumar, the niece of Jayalalithaa, filed a suit to restrain the makers from promoting and releasing the series. She claimed that Jayalalithaa's family were not consulted about the project and that the series would affect the family's privacy. The Madras High Court subsequently called on the makers to respond to the allegations, and a notice was sent to Menon and A. L. Vijay, who planned to direct a biopic based on Jayalalithaa titled Thalaivi. On 3 January 2020, the court dismissed the plea to stall the release of the series, stating that the name of the main character is Sakthi Seshadri and, in the light of disclaimer that it is purely fictional and that any resemblance to real persons is coincidental and not intentional.\nSee also\n* J.
