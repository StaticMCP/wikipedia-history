This marks the 28th occasion on which lower-ranking teams have qualified for the Emperor's Cup through prefectural tournaments. Prior to the 1996 Emperor's Cup, such teams gained entry to the competition via regional qualification rounds. For the 2024 edition, the competition continues to be restricted to Type 1 teams (composed mainly of adults), with Type 2 teams (composed of high school undergraduates) blocked from participating. J1 League and J2 League clubs did not participate in the prefectural tournaments, as those clubs are automatically qualified for the Cup.\nUsually, the format of the Emperor's Cup opens 48 berths for amateur clubs, with all of them being assigned into the first round of the competition. Alongside the 47 prefectural champions, the JFA annually assigns a specially designated club to complete the roster of 48 amateur teams into the round. The specially designated clubs automatically skip the qualification stage and then, does not participate in their respective prefectural tournaments. On 2024, an exception was made due to the exclusion of Urawa Red Diamonds, who would automatically qualify into the second round of the Emperor's Cup. An extra amateur team, Meiji University, was then, given a direct entry as a second specially designated club into the first round, pushing Honda FC to the second round.\nCustomarily, university teams are allowed to participate in each tournament. Some university clubs have two or more affiliated teams participating, with its second-and-beyond teams composed of present and past students in that university. The first-team of each universities uses its formal name to distinguish themselves from its affiliated teams, which is most of the time done by attaching abbreviations (such as \"FC\", \"AFC\" or \"SC\") to the names of their respective universities.\nPrefectural champions\nThe 47 prefectural tournaments champions that qualified for the 2024 Emperor's Cup.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!Prefecture||Team||League||Apps.\n|-\n|Hokkaido||Hokkaido Tokachi Sky Earth ||Hokkaido Soccer League ||2nd\n|-\n|Aomori||Vanraure Hachinohe ||J3 League ||12th\n|-\n|Iwate||Iwate Grulla Morioka ||J3 League ||12th\n|-\n|Miyagi||Sony Sendai ||Japan Football League ||25th\n|-\n|Akita||Saruta Kogyo ||Tohoku Soccer League D2 North ||3rd\n|-\n|Yamagata||Oyama SC ||Tohoku Soccer League D2 South ||3rd\n|-\n|Fukushima||Fukushima United ||J3 League ||12th\n|-\n|Ibaraki||University of Tsukuba ||Kanto University League D1 ||34th\n|-\n|Tochigi||Tochigi City ||Japan Football League ||14th\n|-\n|Gunma||Tonan Maebashi ||Kanto Soccer League D2 ||8th\n|-\n|Saitama||Omiya Ardija ||J3 League ||29th\n|-\n|Chiba||Briobecca Urayasu||Japan Football League ||7th\n|-\n|Tokyo||Yokogawa Musashino ||Japan Football League ||6th\n|-\n|Kanagawa||SC Sagamihara ||J3 League ||3rd\n|-\n|Yamanashi||Yamanashi Gakuin University Pegasus ||Yamanashi Football League ||6th\n|-\n|Nagano||Nagano Parceiro ||J3 League ||12th\n|-\n|Niigata||Japan Soccer College ||Hokushinetsu Football League D1 ||14th\n|-\n|Toyama||Kataller Toyama ||J3 League ||15th\n|-\n|Ishikawa||Zweigen Kanazawa ||J3 League ||20th\n|-\n|Fukui||Fukui United ||Hokushinetsu Football League D1 ||16th\n|-\n|Shizuoka||Azul Claro Numazu ||J3 League ||3rd\n|-\n|Aichi||Chukyo University ||Tokai University League D1 ||8th\n|-\n|Mie||Veertien Mie ||Japan Football League ||4th\n|-\n|Gifu||FC Gifu ||J3 League ||18th\n|-\n|Shiga||Biwako Seikei Sport College ||Kansai University League D1 ||7th\n|-\n|Kyoto||Kyoto Sangyo University ||Kansai University League D1 ||6th\n|-\n|Osaka||Kansai University ||Kansai University League D1 ||19th\n|-\n|Hyogo||Konan University ||Kansai University League D1 ||2nd\n|-\n|Nara||Nara Club ||J3 League ||15th\n|-\n|Wakayama||Arterivo Wakayama ||Kansai Soccer League D1 ||16th\n|-\n|Tottori||Gainare Tottori ||J3 League ||26th\n|-\n|Shimane||Belugarosso Iwami ||Chugoku Soccer League ||3rd\n|-\n|Okayama||Mitsubishi Mizushima ||Chugoku Soccer League ||16th\n|-\n|Hiroshima||Fukuyama City ||Chugoku Soccer League ||4th\n|-\n|Yamaguchi||Baleine Shimonoseki ||Chugoku Soccer League ||4th\n|-\n|Kagawa||Kamatamare Sanuki ||J3 League ||24th\n|-\n|Tokushima||FC Tokushima ||Shikoku Soccer League ||9th\n|-\n|Ehime||Ehime FC ||J3 League ||14th\n|-\n|Kochi||Kochi United ||Japan Football League ||9th\n|-\n|Fukuoka||Giravanz Kitakyushu ||J3 League ||15th\n|-\n|Saga|| ||Kyushu Soccer League ||4th\n|-\n|Nagasaki || ||Nagasaki Football League ||11th\n|-\n|Kumamoto||Tokai University Kumamoto ||Kyushu University League D1 ||5th\n|-\n|Oita||J-Lease FC ||Kyushu Soccer League ||1st\n|-\n|Miyazaki||Tegevajaro Miyazaki ||J3 League ||4th\n|-\n|Kagoshima||NIFS Kanoya ||Kyushu University League D1 ||13th\n|-\n|Okinawa||Okinawa SV ||Japan Football League ||5th\n|-\n|}\nPrefectural tournaments\nTeams playing in higher tiers usually receive a bye from the early stages of each tournament, with some automatically seeded to the prefectural final. This is the case with many J3 League teams, as the only professional clubs eligible to participate. Some prefectures holds qualification to their prefectural tournaments, splitting \"social representatives\" and \"university representatives\" into the qualifiers. This is more prone to occur when two or more clubs from the same prefecture are members of the J3 League and/or Japan Football League, as both leagues' clubs are exempt from being treated as a \"social representative\", a term which describes amateur clubs whose players are, or were affiliated unanimously, with the same university.\nHokkaido\n----\n*Source:\nAomori\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nIwate\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nAkita\n----\n----\n*Source:\nMiyagi\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nYamagata\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nFukushima\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nIbaraki\n----\n----\n*Source:\nTochigi\n----\n*Source:\nGunma\n----\n----\n*Source:\nSaitama\n----\n*Source:\nChiba\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nTokyo\n----\n*Source:\nKanagawa\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nYamanashi\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nNiigata\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nNagano\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nToyama\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nIshikawa\nFukui\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nShizuoka\n*Source:\nAichi\n----\n*Source:\nGifu\n----\n*Source:\nMie\n----\n*Source:\nShiga\n----\n----\n*Source:\nKyoto\n----\n*Source:\nOsaka\n----\n----\n*Source:\nHyogo\n----\n----\n*Source:\nNara\n----\n----\n*Source:\nWakayama\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nTottori\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nShimane\n----\n----\n*Source:\nOkayama\n----\n*Source:\nHiroshima\n----\n----\n*Source:\nYamaguchi\n----\n----\n*Source:\nKagawa\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nTokushima\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nEhime\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nKochi\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nFukuoka\n----\n----\n*Source:\nSaga\n----\n----\n*Source:\nNagasaki\n----\n*Source:\nKumamoto\n----\n*Source:\nOita\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nMiyazaki\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nKagoshima\n----\n----\n*Source:\nOkinawa\n----\n----\n----\n----\n----\n*Source:\nSee also\n*2024 Emperor's Cup\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.jfa.jp/eng/match/emperorscup_2024/ Emperor's Cup 2024], JFA.jp"
