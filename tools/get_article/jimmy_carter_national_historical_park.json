These include his residence, boyhood farm, school, and the town railroad depot, which served as his campaign headquarters during the 1976 election.  The building which used to be Plains High School (opened in 1921 and closed in 1979) serves as the park's museum and visitor center. When Carter lived in Plains, the area surrounding the residence was under the protection of the United States Secret Service. The residence is also the burial site of Carter and his wife, First Lady Rosalynn Carter (1927–2023). While the residence itself is undergoing renovation and is not open to the public, the adjoining Carter gravesite and memorial garden is publicly accessible.\nThe Carters returned to Plains in 1981. The former President and First Lady pursued many of the goals of his administration through the Carter Center in Atlanta, which has programs to alleviate human suffering and to promote human rights and world peace. Carter taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church, which is open to the public.\nIt was established in 1987 by  as Jimmy Carter National Historic Site and renamed as a national historical park in 2021.\nVisitor center and museum\nThe former Plains High School, which both Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter attended, now serves as the park's visitor center and museum.  It features a classroom, principal's office, and auditorium which have been restored to look as they would have when Jimmy Carter attended.  An exact replica of the Resolute desk, which Jimmy Carter brought back to the Oval Office to use as his presidential desk, is exhibited, as is his 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.  Other rooms feature exhibits that explain the lives of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, and a short video focuses on the life of Jimmy Carter according to his friends, neighbors, and family.\nBoyhood home and farm\nThe farm in the nearby unincorporated community of Archery where Jimmy lived from age four in 1928 until he left for college in 1941 has been restored to its appearance before electricity was installed in 1938.\nCampaign headquarters\nThe former Plains Train Depot, where Carter headquartered his presidential campaign, now serves as a museum focusing on the 1976 Presidential Campaign and Election.  It features exhibits which highlight Jimmy Carter's campaign for President. The train depot operated from 1888 until 1951, when all public transportation to and from the area ceased.\nCarter home, burial site and memorial garden\nThe long-time home of the Carters at 209 Woodland Drive, while not open to the public, is a part of the park. The Carters lived in the home from 1961. During his presidency, it was used as his Summer White House. The intent is for the National Park Service (NPS) to turn the house into a museum and open it to the public in the future.\nJimmy and Rosalynn Carter are buried across Woodland Drive from the house. The gravesite and a memorial garden are located near a pond and by a willow tree. After renovations which were begun after Jimmy Carter's death to make the area publicly accessible, the Carters gravesite, memorial garden and Woodland Drive were open to the public in July 2025.\nPhotos\nPlains train depot\nImage:CarterHQ.jpg|Plains train depot, which served as the 1976 Carter campaign headquarters\nImage:Jimmy Carter campaign headquarters, inside, Plains, GA, US.jpg|Interior of the campaign headquarters\nVisitor center and museum\nImage:Jimmy Carter's High School, Plains, GA, US.jpg|Carter's high school, now a museum and visitor center\nImage:16 02 021 carter.jpg|Detail of classroom\nImage:19-06-355-carter.jpg|Auditorium\nImage:21-20-097-marker.jpg|Historical marker\nCarter boyhood farm\nImage:17 02 0166 carter.jpg|Map of farm\nImage:Windmill water pump on Jimmy Carter homesite, Plains, GA, US.jpg|A water pump powered by a windmill\nImage:16 02 167 carter.jpg|Barn and old farm equipment\nImage:17 25 003 carter.jpg|Blacksmith shop\nImage:17 02 181 carter.jpg|Earl and Lillian Carter home\nImage:16 02 046 carter.jpg|Detail of front porch\nImage:16 02 051 carter.jpg|Detail of dining room\nImage:17 02 060 carter.jpg|Detail of bedroom\nImage:16 02 056 carter.jpg|Detail of bedroom\nImage:The Carter family store in the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park.jpg|Carter family country store\nImage:16 02 094 carter.jpg|Detail of country store\nImage:17 02 129 carter.jpg|Rachel and Jack Clark's tenant house\nImage:16 02 155 carter.jpg|Tenant house, main room\nImage:17 25 027 carter.jpg|Tenant house, kitchen\nJimmy and Rosalynn Carter's home, gardens and burial site\nImage:Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter gravesite.jpg|Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter's gravesite\nSee also\n*List of residences of presidents of the United States\n*Presidential memorials in the United States\n* List of burial places of presidents and vice presidents of the United States\nSources\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nps.gov/jica/index.htm Official Park Service site]\n*[https://www.c-span.org/video/?151635-1/life-portrait-jimmy-carter \"Life Portrait of Jimmy Carter\"], from C-SPAN's American Presidents: Life Portraits, broadcast from the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site, December 3, 1999\n*[http://www.sears-homes.com/2014/01/jimmy-carters-boyhood-home.html Jimmy Carter's Boyhood Home]\n*[https://www.c-span.org/program/public-affairs-event/president-jimmy-carter-motorcade-drives-through-plains-georgia/653912 President Jimmy Carter Motorcade drives through Plains, Georgia, January 4, 2025] on C-SPAN\n*"
