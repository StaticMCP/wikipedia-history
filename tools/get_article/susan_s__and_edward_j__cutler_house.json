Cutler House is a historic house in Providence, Rhode Island.  It is an L-shaped -story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof and a single-story porch and vestibule in the crook of the L. The front facade has a rectangular projecting bay, with panels below the windows, and a bracketed hip roof.  The front and side gables both feature Stick style decorative woodwork.  The entry porch roof is bracketed, matching the front bay, and has a jigsawn balustrade.  The interior features late Victorian woodwork, plasterwork and original hardware.  The house was built in 1880, probably from plans in a published pattern book, and was the first to be built in a relatively new subdivision on Providence's north side.  It is a well-preserved example of a \"picturesque cottage\", a style popularized by a number of 19th-century architects.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Providence, Rhode Island\nReferences"
