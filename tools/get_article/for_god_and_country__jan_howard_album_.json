It was released by Decca Records in January 1970 and consisted of 11 tracks. The project was a collection of 11 tracks dedicated to Howard's son who was killed in the Vietnam War. The songs on the album were both patriotic and inspirational music. It was given a positive review by Billboard magazine.\nBackground, recording and content\nThe wife of country songwriter Harlan Howard, Jan Howard was encouraged by her husband to launch her own recording career who believed in her singing ability. He helped her get a recording contract and by 1960 she made the country charts with \"The One You Slip Around With\". However, it was not until signing with Decca Records that she had her peak commercial success. Songs like \"Evil on Your Mind\", \"Count Your Blessings, Woman\" and \"When We Tried\" were charting top 40 country recordings during the 1960s. The label also issued a series of albums by Howard, among them was For God and Country.\nAccording to Howard, she was inspired to record an album of patriotic and inspirational music after finding a poem written by her son, Carter Howard (a member of the US military). The poem told of his experiences serving in the military. She also decided to dedicate the project to her eldest son, Jimmy, who was also a US military soldier and was killed in the Vietnam War. For God and Country was a collection of 11 tracks and was produced by Owen Bradley. Howard recounted in her autobiography that it was \"the most difficult album I'd ever recorded yet one that would always be the closest to my heart\". She also remembered sessions musicians crying during the recording of the album.\nRelease and critical reception\nFor God and Country was released by Decca Records in January 1970 and was Howard's eighth studio album in her career. It was distributed as a vinyl LP and as an 8-track cartridge with five songs on \"side 1\" and six songs on \"side 2\". For God and Country was among eight albums issued by Decca in January 1970 to promote their 8-track cartridges. Billboard magazine reviewed the project in January 1970, finding that Howard was \"striking deep at the very vibes of the soul of the country music fan\". They also concluded that the album \"will reap big rewards\".\nTrack listing\n| length1         = 3:18\n| note1           = background music: \"Onward Christian Soldiers\"\n| title2          = Where No One Stands Alone\n| writer2         = Mosie Lister\n| length2         = 3:06\n| title3          = God Bless America\n| writer3         = Irving Berlin\n| length3         = 1:50\n| title4          = God Bless America Again\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 2:30\n| title5          = I Believe\n| writer5         =\n| length5         = 2:20\n}}\nPersonnel\nAll credits are adapted from the liner notes of For God and Country.\n* Bill Anderson – Liner notes\n* Bobby Bare – Liner notes\n* Owen Bradley – Producer\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Region\n!scope=\"col\"| Date\n!scope=\"col\"| Format\n!scope=\"col\"| Label\n!scope=\"col\"| Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| North America\n| January 1970\n|\n| Decca Records\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
