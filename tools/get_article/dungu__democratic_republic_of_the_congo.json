Dungu's terrain is wooded savannah, and its climate is tropical.\nIt is the principal town in Dungu Territory.  It has a hospital, nursing school, high school, Internet cafe, and a cathedral—as it is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Doruma-Dungu.\nHistory\nColonial history\nIn 1942, the Belgian territorial administrator Schollaert was given the task of building a bridge across the Dungu River. Instead of building a two-lane bridge as ordered, he built a one-lane bridge. With the remaining bricks he built a medieval style castle with 40 rooms between the Dungu and Kibali rivers.\nRecent history and situation\nSince the early 1990s, Sudanese refugees from the Second Sudanese Civil War have settled north of Dungu in two refugee camps, Kaka I and Kaka II, set up by Oxfam Quebec, an implementing partner of UNHCR in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nIn September 2005 Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) entered Dungu Territory from Sudan and set up in Garamba National Park.  Since October 2008, following attacks by the LRA, Médecins Sans Frontières has had a team in Dungu to help with the wounded and the health needs of the displaced, soon followed by other international relief NGOs such as Solidarités, Oxfam Quebec, Cesvi, Coopi, Danish Refugee Council and Medair. In December 2008 the LRA attacked the town of Dungu, resulting in all inhabitants temporarily fleeing.\nAccording to an August 2009 report of Radio Okapi, 100,000 people in Dungu Territory have been displaced by the fighting.\nHumanitarian response to the LRA crisis\nThe LRA crisis has affected the whole of Haut-Uele District, and Dungu is used as the main base of operations for most, if not all, international and local humanitarian organizations, including MONUC and the UN agencies.\nAlthough Medair, Terre Sans Frontières, MSF Suisse and Solidarités were present prior to the beginning of the LRA crisis in mid-September 2008, many non-governmental organizations set up bases and projects in various fields in January 2009. These NGOs are from Switzerland (Medair), Denmark (DRC&nbsp;– Danish Refugee Council), Italy (Cooperazione Internazionale or COOPI and Cesvi), Canada (Oxfam Quebec, Terre Sans Frontières), the United States (Mercy Corps) and the United Kingdom (Oxfam Great Britain); the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), an international sovereign organisation, is also present. Local and national NGOs, such as Caritas DRC (known locally as Caritas Développement Congo) ADSSE and CDJP, are also active in Dungu.\nThe United Nations has a good presence in Dungu, with most of the agencies and MONUC firmly established in the town since March 2009. Two peacekeeping battalions (Moroccan and Indonesian) ensure security as well as road maintenance, while agencies such as OCHA, UNHCR, UNICEF, FAO, WFP and UNDP (through the Pooled Fund program) act as donors and coordinators of the humanitarian response. A detachment of Bangladesh Air Contingent (BANAIR) also operates under MONUSCO with 3 helicopters in Dungu.\nAdministration\nThe town is divided into five main neighbourhoods: Uye (south), Mussa (south center), Ngirimo (center), Bamokandi and R.D.C border Town of Nabiapai to the (north) towards Yambio.\nDemography\nIn 2004 its population was estimated at over 23,000.  The major tribe is the Azande, and the national language used locally is Pazande and Lingala.  Some people speak a dialect of Lingala called Bangala, which contains many words from Zande language, Swahili, and other languages.\nTransport\nDungu is served by Dungu-Uye Airport, which is just southeast of the town.\nGallery\nFile:Dungu.jpg| A Colonial Building\nFile:Dungu_bridge.jpg|The Bridge over Dungu River\nFile:Dungu Bridge.jpg|The Bridge over Dungu River\nFile:Dungu_river.jpg|Dungu River\nFile:Uele river.jpg|Fish traps in the Uele River\nSee also\n*Sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nReferences"
