It features Carlton Barrett on drums, Robbie Shakespeare and Aston Barrett on bass guitar, and Earl \"Chinna\" Smith on guitar. Pablo produced the album and played melodica, piano, organ and clavinet. All sessions with the musicians were recorded at Randy's studio in Kingston, Jamaica, and then Pablo took the tapes to King Tubby for mixing. The album has been released on several different labels, often with slightly different artworks and track lists.\nThe title song is a dub version of the Jacob Miller song \"Baby I Love You So\", also produced by Pablo. It was released as a 45 rpm single in 1974 on the Mango label (MS-2001), with \"Baby I Love You So\" as the B-side. A distinctly different mix of the song with vocals and dub can be found on the Jacob Miller and Augustus Pablo album, Who Say Jah No Dread, released in 1992.\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music\n|rev2score =\n|rev3 = ''All Music Guide: The Experts' Guide (3rd ed., 1997)\n|rev3score =\n|rev4 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n|rev4Score =\n| rev5 = MusicHound World, Craig Harris\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = MusicHound World, David Poole\n| rev6score =\n| rev7 = The New Rolling Stone Record Guide\n| rev7score =\n|rev8 = Rolling Stone\n|rev8score =\n| rev9 = Spin Alternative Record Guide\n| rev9score = 9/10\n}}\nKing Tubbys Meets Rockers Uptown was ranked number 96 by New Musical Express'' on their 1985 critics' list of the greatest albums ever made.
