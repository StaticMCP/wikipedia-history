With the PC industry rising from the 1980s in Taiwan, its NTC thermistor is adapted as the inrush current limiter in switched-mode power supply to suppress the inrush current when power supply turns on, and the varistor protects the circuit from damaged by surge current occasionally occurred in the electricity network. This earns THINKING a role in the supply chain of the switched-mode power supply industry and listed into top 1,000 manufacturers in Taiwan by the press.\nSee also\n* List of companies of Taiwan\n* Switched-mode power supply\n* Inrush current\n* Varistor\n* Thermistor\n* Varistor\n* Temperature sensor\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thinking.com.tw Company Web]\n*[http://english.cw.com.tw/survey.do?action=top&yearCond=2007&industry=A&companyName=Thinking Top One Thousand Enterprises of Taiwan in 2007, surveyed by CommonWealth Magazine]"
