Founded in 1881, the college is one of the oldest arts institutions in Australia, and has been part of Griffith University since 1991. It is co-located with the Queensland Conservatorium, the Griffith Film School, and the Griffith Graduate Centre.\nHistory\nEarly days and name changes\nThe college was founded as Brisbane School of Arts (in a now heritage-listed building) in 1881. Over the years it underwent a series of name changes, including Technical School of Visual Arts; the Art Branch within the Central Technical College; Seven Hills College of Art (1974); before being renamed Queensland College of Art (QCA) in 1983. It has also frequently been referred to by other sources as Queensland College of the Arts.\nMerger with Griffith University\nThe college became part of Griffith University in the early 1990s.\nFilm studies\nIn 2002, it offered courses in animation, screen production, Australian Indigenous art and, from that year, a new bachelor of digital design.  The film school at the college had forged links SBS Independent, leading to the production of five films over seven years. It offered an atelier-style 16 mm film course, separate from the much bigger courses offered by the humanities department of the university, which focused on video and media theory. There was an intake of 30 students per year, and graduates were very successful in finding jobs in the industry afterwards.\nGriffith Film School was established in 2004, and students at QCAD collaborate with students at this school who are studying film and screen media, animation, and games design.\nQCAD (2024)\nFrom 1 January 2024 it was officially renamed Queensland College of Art and Design (QCAD).\nDescription\nThe college is specialist visual arts and design college located within the South Bank parklands, along with the Queensland Conservatorium, the Griffith Film School, and Griffith Graduate Centre.
