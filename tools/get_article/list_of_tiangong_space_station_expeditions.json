      "text": "# List of Tiangong Space Station expeditions\n\nThis is a chronological list of permanent expeditions to the Tiangong space station (TSS), a space station operated by China in low Earth orbit since 2021. An expedition to the TSS refers to the crew that is occupying the space station and using it for research and testing. Expeditions can last up to six months and typically include three crewmembers. Starting with Expedition 3 (Shenzhou 14), expeditions have overlapped so that the station remains continuously inhabited.\nExpeditions are numbered starting from one and sequentially increased with each expedition. TSS commanders are listed in bold. \"Duration\" is the period of time between the crew's arrival and departure from the TSS\nCompleted expeditions\n{| class=\"wikitable sticky-header\"\n!\n!Crew\n!Arrival (UTC)\n!Arrival flight\n!Departure (UTC)\n!Departure flight\n!Duration\n!\n|-\n!1\n|Nie HaishengLiu BomingTang Hongbo\n|17 June 2021, 07:54\n|Shenzhou 12\n|16 September 2021, 00:56\n|Shenzhou 12\n|~\n|\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|station uncrewed: 16 September–15 October 2021\n!\n|-\n!2\n|Zhai ZhigangYe GuangfuWang Yaping\n|15 October 2021, 22:56\n|Shenzhou 13\n|15 April 2022, 16:44\n|Shenzhou 13\n|~\n|\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|station uncrewed: 15 April–15 June 2022\n!\n|-\n!3\n|Chen DongLiu YangCai Xuzhe\n|5 June 2022, 09:42\n|Shenzhou 14\n|4 December 2022, 03:01\n|Shenzhou 14\n|~\n|\n|-\n!4\n|Fei JunlongDeng&nbsp;QingmingZhang Lu\n|29 November 2022, 21:42\n|Shenzhou 15\n|3 June 2023, 13:29\n|Shenzhou 15\n|~\n|\n|-\n!5\n|Jing HaipengZhu YangzhuGui Haichao\n|30 May 2023, 08:29\n|Shenzhou 16\n|30 October 2023, 12:37\n|Shenzhou 16\n|~\n|\n|-\n!6\n|Tang HongboTang ShengjieJiang Xinlin\n|26 October 2023, 09:46\n|Shenzhou 17\n|30 April 2024, 00:43\n|Shenzhou 17\n|~\n|\n|-\n!7\n|\n|25 April 2024, 19:32\n|Shenzhou 18\n|3 November 2024, 08:12\n|Shenzhou 18\n|~\n|\n|-\n!8\n|\n|30 October 2024, 03:00\n|Shenzhou 19\n|29 April 2025, 20:00\n|Shenzhou 19\n|~\n|\n|-\n!9\n|Chen DongChen ZhongruiWang Jie\n|24 April 2025, 15:49\n|Shenzhou 20\n|14 November 2025, 03:14\n|Shenzhou 21\n|~\n|\n|}\nCurrent expedition\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!
