Since its European discovery, Kangaroos have since become an emblem of Australia, appearing in their coat of arms and in many state and city coat of arms, Australian logos such as the Qantas logo, names of Australian sport teams, mascots such as the Boxing Kangaroo and in public art. Kangaroos are also well represented in film, television, songs, toys and souvenirs around the world.\nEuropean first encounters\nThe kangaroo was considered a unique oddity when Captain Cook's HMB Endeavour arrived back in England in 1771 with a specimen on board. Over time it has come to symbolise Australia and Australian values.\nJoseph Banks, the naturalist on the Endeavour voyage, commissioned George Stubbs to paint a portrait of the kangaroo specimen. When the official account of the voyage was published in 1773, it was illustrated with an engraving of Stubbs' kangaroo. From that time on, the kangaroo quickly came to symbolise the Australian continent, appearing in exhibitions, collections, art and printed works across Europe.\nKangaroo status\nIt took a long time for the kangaroo to achieve official recognition in Australia. Despite being a \"declared noxious animal\" because of its reputation for damaging crops and fences and competing with domestic animals for resources, the kangaroo finally achieved official recognition with its inclusion on Australia's coat of arms in 1908. The kangaroo is now popularly regarded as Australia's unofficial animal emblem.\nKangaroo emblems and logos\n]]\nThe kangaroo and emu are bearers on the Australian Coat of Arms. It has been claimed these animals were chosen to signify a country moving 'forward' because of a common belief that neither can move backward.\nTwo red kangaroos serve as bearers to the Coat of Arms of Western Australia.\nAustralia's national airline, Qantas, uses a bounding kangaroo for its logo. The kangaroo has always been part of the Qantas logo, and the airline has previously been known informally as \"The Flying Kangaroo\".\nTourism Australia makes use of the kangaroo in its logo to \"help ensure instant recognition for Australia around the world\".\nThe Australian Grown logo uses a golden kangaroo in a green triangle to show that a product is made or grown in Australia.\nThe Royal Australian Air Force roundel features a bounding red kangaroo.\nWarships of the Royal Australian Navy have red kangaroo symbols (based on the kangaroo on the reverse of the Australian penny) fixed to either side of their superstructure or funnel. This originated during the Korean War: as the destroyer  was repeatedly mistaken for a British warship, her executive officer had a brass 'weathervane' in the shape of a kangaroo made and mounted to the ship's mainmast.\nThe kangaroo is part of the official emblem of the Royal Australian Regiment with a kangaroo in between two Lee–Enfield bolt-action rifles.\nThe Victorian coat of arms includes the upper portion of a kangaroo holding an Imperial Crown in its paws.\nThe red kangaroo is the animal emblem of the Northern Territory.\nThe kangaroo is the official emblem of Northern Territory Police.\nBritish clothing and headwear company Kangol, known for its berets, features a kangaroo in its logo.\nKangaroos and coins\nThe kangaroo has been featured on coins on the pre-decimal Australian pound and decimal coins of the Australian dollar. The kangaroo appears on the pre-decimal penny and half-penny coins. Five kangaroos are featured on the one dollar coin.\nKangaroo mascots in Australia\n]]\nThe boxing kangaroo – mascot for the Australia II team in the 1983 America's Cup.  This rendition of the kangaroo has become a sporting icon, known informally as the green and gold \"Sporting Kangaroo\", and is highly popular with cricket crowds and international sporting events which feature Australian participation.\nMatilda, the mascot at the 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, was represented by both a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070208150816/http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/GamesInfo/PastGames/1982/Mascot.htm cartoon kangaroo]  and a 13-metre high (42 feet 8&nbsp;inches) mechanical kangaroo (which winked at the spectators during the opening and closing ceremonies).  The 'medal', which was worn by both the cartoon and mechanical versions of Matilda, features the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070208150729/http://www.commonwealthgames.org.au/GamesInfo/PastGames/1982/Logo.htm 1982 Commonwealth Games logo] — a stylised representation of a kangaroo bounding (in \"flight\") – similar to the pose of the kangaroo featured on the pre-decimal half-penny coin.\nDuring the First World War, pet kangaroos and toy kangaroos were a popular choice of mascot for Australian servicemen.\n.]]\nArchitectural references\nThe first uses of Kangaroo ornaments as architectural expression appeared during the Victorian era.  This was at first limited to the use of the coat of arms on buildings; however, kangaroos soon became used as decorative motifs on their own in some commercial buildings, particularly in Melbourne.\nIt was the Federation architecture, however, which brought native ornamentation into the mainstream, so that kangaroos began to be mass-produced as ornamentation on domestic houses in the large cities, as part of an Australiana movement and effort to create a uniquely Australian style.  Examples of this decoration include the ornamental terracotta tile capping on residential roofs.  Reproduction products using Kangaroos are still used today.\nPublic art and sculpture\nkangaroo sculptures]]\nKangaroo motifs have been used as a form of public art.\nNotable examples include:\n*Victorian lamp post (1880) in front of the Royal Exhibition Building at the Carlton Gardens in Carlton, Victoria\n*Petrie Tableaux sculpture (1989).
