It commemorates the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940.\nOverview\nOn June 17, 1940 Soviet troops invaded Latvia and occupied bridges, post/telephone, telegraph, and broadcasting offices. On the same day, Andrei Vishinski, Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, introduced himself to President Kārlis Ulmanis as Soviet special envoy; two days later, Vishinski visited Ulmanis again, this time, to deliver the list, pre-approved by Moscow, of the new members of the cabinet of the Latvian government. Soon after, State administrators were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres, in which 34,250 Latvians were deported or killed and Latvia was incorporated into the Soviet Union as The Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nSoviet Occupation Day became an official remembrance day on May 18, 2000.\nMoldova's interim president Mihai Ghimpu instituted in 2010 the Soviet Occupation Day holiday to remember the Soviet occupation on June 28, 1940, but the Constitutional Court cancelled his decree on July 12, 2010. Georgia followed the example and declared February 25 Soviet Occupation Day to recall the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921.\nSee also\n* Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940\n* Occupation of the Baltic states\n* Red Army invasion of Georgia\n* Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.russkiymir.ru/russkiymir/en/news/common/news0525.html  Soviet Occupation Remembered in Riga]\n* Rihards Treijs [https://web.archive.org/web/20101029055301/http://vip.latnet.lv/lpra/treijs.htm \"Par Latvijas okupāciju 1940.gadā\"]\n* Latvijas Avīze [http://www2.la.lv/lat/latvijas_avize/jaunakaja_numura/reportaza/?doc=56571 \"17. jūnijs – Latvijas Republikas okupācijas diena\" (17.06.09.)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110712232556/http://www.mfa.gov.lv/lv/latvia/vesture/okupacijas-aspekti/ \"Latvijas okupācija:vēsturiskie un starptautiski tiesiskie aspekti\"]\n* AllMoldova.md:  [http://www.allmoldova.com/en/moldova-news/1249047541.html \"June 28 declared Day of Soviet Occupation'\"], 24 June 2010\n* RFE/RL: [http://www.rferl.org/content/Soviet_Occupation_Day_Causes_Rift_In_Moldovas_Ruling_Alliance/2083416.html \"'Soviet Occupation Day' Causes Rift In Moldova's Ruling Alliance\"],  3 July 2010"
