It served as the headquarters of the March 23 Movement (M23) rebel militia in 2013 and has been occupied by M23 since 13 June 2022.\nAs of 13 October 2022, the rebels had consolidated their control on the area surrounding the town.  The Congolese border post was operating under rebel control with ongoing commercial exchanges with Uganda.\nUnited States Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Menendez has stated that “Rwandan support for M23 rebels who are attacking civilians, UN peacekeepers, and FARDC in Eastern DRC is unacceptable” and has called for Bureau of African Affairs to “immediately investigate and hold those responsible to account”\nOn 3 April 2023,  AP reported that East African regional forces (EACRF), including a Ugandan contingent, had \"regained\" control of Bunagana. Ugandan contingent spokesman Capt. Kato Ahmad Hassan thanked the M23 rebels, saying “We appreciate the command of the M23 for being cooperative to the contingent, for according us a safe passage and for allowing us to occupy Bunagana.”\nHowever, the M23 continued to co-occupy Bunagana with the EACRF.\nLocation\nThe town is located approximately , by road, northeast of Goma, the provincial capital.\nSee also\n*Bunagana, Uganda\n*Goma\n*North Kivu Province\n*Virunga National Park\n*M23 campaign (2022–present)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps?q=1.3000S,+29.5950E&hl=en&ll=-1.300266,29.607682&spn=0.020208,0.030556&sll=-1.300481,29.624205&sspn=0.040416,0.061111&t=m&z=15&iwloc=near Location of Bunagana, DRC At Google Maps]"
