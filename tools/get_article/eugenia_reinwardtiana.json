Native to tropical forests in Indonesia, the Australian state of Queensland, and many Pacific Islands, its common names include Cedar Bay cherry, beach cherry, Australian beach cherry, mountain stopper, nīoi (Hawaiian), and '''a'abang' (Chamorro). They are typically  in height.\nThe tree is particularly common around the Cedar Bay National Park in northern Australia and the edible fruit was especially popular with the hippies who lived there in the 1970s.\nThe fruits are green at first, then ripen to a bright orange-red colour with a sweet taste and soft flesh.\nUses\nThe tree is cultivated to a limited extent for its edible sweetish fruit that is often eaten out-of-hand, used to flavour drinks and candies, or as a preserve. The fruit is a source of antioxidants.\nThe tree is well-suited to amenity horticulture in the tropics, and is grown in the median strips in Cairns. It is readily propagated from fresh seed.\n}}\nExternal links"
