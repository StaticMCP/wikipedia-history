Edwards House is a historic house on Main Street in Evening Shade, Arkansas.  It is a -story wood-frame structure with a dormered side-gable roof, and a front-facing cross gable with decorative shingling.  A single-story porch extends across much of the front and one side, supported by a sandstone foundation and turned posts.  Built c. 1890, by a prominent local merchant, it is one of the community's few 19th century buildings.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Sharp County, Arkansas\nReferences"
