The dispute was arbitrated by a arbitral tribunal constituted under Annex VII of the 1982 United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea. The Permanent Court of Arbitration was asked on 31 March 2011 to function as registry in the proceedings.\nDisputes over arbiters\nIn 2011, the government of Mauritius challenged Sir Christopher Greenwood's role in the arbitration proceedings on the grounds that his role as a UK Foreign and Commonwealth legal adviser could bias him in favour of the United Kingdom's claims to the Chagos Islands. However, this was rejected by the tribunal on the basis that this \"neither constituted nor continued an already existing relationship.\"\nDispute over jurisdiction\nOn the 15 January 2013, the tribunal released procedural order no. 2. In this order the tribunal rejected a British request that the tribunal should deal with British jurisdictional challenges in a preliminary phase.\nAward of the arbitral tribunal\nOn the 18 March 2015, the arbitral tribunal ruled that the Chagos Marine Protected Area was \"not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention\" and declared unanimously that in establishing the MPA surrounding the Chagos Archipelago the United Kingdom had breached its obligations under Articles 2(3), 56(2), and 194(4) of the Convention.\nSee also\n*United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120729073042/http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1429 Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration (Mauritius v.
