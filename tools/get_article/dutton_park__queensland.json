In the , Dutton Park had a population of 2,134 people.\nGeography\nDutton Park is located about  south of the Brisbane CBD. It is bounded to the north-east by the Beenleigh railway line and the median of Brisbane River to the south-west. Dutton Park lies on a ridge to the east of the Brisbane River, opposite from St Lucia. The site slopes down from Gladstone Road with an average gradient of 0.026.\nAnnerley Road enters the suburb from the north (South Brisbane) and exits to the south (Annerley). Gladstone Road enters the suburb from the north-west and has its junction with Annerley Road within the suburb. The Boggo Road railway station (formerly Park Road railway station) and the Dutton Park railway station are in the suburb on the Beenleigh line. The Cleveland railway line and the Fisherman Islands railway line have their junction with the Beenleigh line in the suburb.\nThe Eleanor Schonnell Bridge is a bridge across the Brisbane River connecting Dutton Park to the University of Queensland's St Lucia campus. It carries a busway, cyclists and pedestrians but not private automobiles.\nAlong the Brisbane River in the suburb, there is a large park (also called Dutton Park) alongside the South Brisbane Cemetery.\nAlong Annerley Road is the former Boggo Road Gaol, part of which remains as a heritage site. The remainder of the jail site was redeveloped as the Ecosciences Precinct, part of the Boggo Road Urban Village development. The precinct is a research facility for the Queensland Government, CSIRO and the University of Queensland through the Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation (QAAFI).\nApart from these major facilities, the suburb is predominantly residential, with some light industrial and commercial areas.\nHistory\nDevelopment in the suburb was slow because of difficult terrain, and the fact that a large part of the area was surveyed for government reserves by H.C. Rawnsley in 1863.\nThe South Brisbane cemetery was reserved in 1866 and is Brisbane's oldest surviving municipal cemetery.\nIn 1884, a park was named after Charles Boydell Dutton, the Queensland Minister for Lands from 1883 to 1887 (and great-great-grandfather of former Australian federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton). This became known as \"Dutton's Park\", a name which was later applied to surrounding estates, a school (originally known as the \"Jail School\") and a railway station before becoming the name of the suburb around 1910.\nOn 2 July 1883, the Boggo Road Gaol opened, firstly serving as a holding place for prisoners who were to be transported to St Helena Island but by 1989 housed over 300 prisoners. In 1903, a separate structure was opened adjacent to the main prison to house the female prisoners. After a Queensland Government inquiry into the living conditions of the inmates the female section of the prison was closed in 1989 with the male section closing in 1992 and later being demolished in 1996.\nIn 1884, the South Coast railway line was built, which included a station at Dutton Park.\nWoolloongabba Mixed State School opened on 1 September 1884. It was split into Woolloongabba Girls and Infants State School and Woolloongabba Boys State School on 5 July 1885. In 1910, the schools were renamed to Dutton Park Girls and Infants State School and Dutton Park Boys State School. In 1935, the two schools were merged to form Dutton Park State School.\nBetween 1901 and 1969 the suburb was served by electric trams. Tram services operated along Gladstone Road and Annerley Road, with a connecting line to the Ipswich Road tram depot along Cornwall Street. J.S. Badger, owner of the Brisbane Tramway Company, developed the Dutton Park recreation reserve in order to increase patronage on the trams. For several years from 1908, open-air movie and variety shows known as 'Continentals' were held at the park, and proved enormously popular, drawing up to 5,000 people a night.\nBetween 1912 and 1927, a tram depot was located in Lang Street (now Tamar Street).\nSt Ita's Regional Primary School opened on 27 January 1919.\nSt Ita's Secondary School opened in 1932. In 1957, it was renamed St Ursula's College. It closed in 1957.\nDutton Park Opportunity School opened on 28 January 1936. In 1979 it was renamed Dutton Park Special School. On 16 December 1994, it ceased to operate as a separate school and became the special education unit of Dutton Park State School.\nOn 17 December 2006, the Eleanor Schonell Bridge was opened, linking the St Lucia campus of the University of Queensland with southern Brisbane.\nThe Ecosciences Precinct in the Boggo Road Urban Village development opened in 2011.\nBrisbane South State Secondary College opened on 1 January 2021 for an initial intake of Year 7 students. During planning, it was known as Inner City South State Secondary College. It was built in Dutton Park to ease pressure on Brisbane State High School in neighbouring South Brisbane.\nDemographics\nIn the , Dutton Park had a population of 2,024 people. The median age of the Dutton Park population was 32 years, six years below the Australian median. Children aged under 15 years made up 14.4% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 12.1% of the population. 58.4% of people were born in Australia. 62.2% of people spoke only English at home.
