It is one of the earliest existing temple of Odisha.\nHistory\nThe temple was constructed in the later half of 6th century CE during the Sailodbhava rule. The Odisha State Archaeology has renovated parts of the temple.\nArchitecture\nThe temple is constructed in the rekha vimana of early Kalingan order architecture style using sandstone. The sandstones are carved with very ancient design by the workers. The entrance is short as it was believed that the devotees should lean down against God. On the basis of architectural scheme and an inscription in the lintel of Laxmanesvara temple, which is adjacent to it, the temple can be assigned to 6th century AD. The temple is triratha on plan and triangabada in elevation  (the outer wall divided into three sections).\nSee also\n* List of temples in Bhubaneswar\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160306022505/http://ignca.nic.in/asp/all.asp?projectid=orkhr0180001 Bharatesvara Temple Phots]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170421102419/http://ignca.nic.in/or_asi_video037.htm Bharatesvara Temple]\nNotes\nReferences\n# Debala Mitra, 1985, Bhubaneswar, New Delhi.\n# T.
