He served with the Army Judge Advocate General Corps. He later served as a Captain in the Army Reserves.\nLegal career\nHe practiced law and served as Town Counsel for Whitman, Massachusetts.\nPolitical career\nFrom 1961 to 1967, Kirby was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. From 1969 to 1977 he was a Plymouth County Commissioner. From 1981 to 1993 he served in the Massachusetts Senate. He was the Third Assistant Minority Leader from 1983 to 1989 and again from 1991 to 1993. He served in all positions as a Republican. He ran in the 2004 State Representative General Election for the 7th Plymouth district but lost to Kathleen M. Teahan. He served on the Whitman Republican Town Committee.
