It lies north of Terschuur and east of Hoevelaken. Like its neighbour Nijkerkerveen, Zwartebroek was founded as a result of the peat extraction in the area.\nIn 1840, it was home to 596 people. In 1850, a church was built in the village.\nEtymology\nThe name Zwartebroek is a combination of the words zwart and broek. Broek is the Dutch term for wet or swampy land. Zwart is the Dutch word for black and might be a reference to the dark color of the land. Broek is also the Dutch word for trousers, but this common translation is incorrect.\nReferences"
