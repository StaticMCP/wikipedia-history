Some give tastes of the skill that won their nomination, while others do not dazzle with such a limited glimpse.\" He feels the novel winner excerpt \"does not reveal much and, because of this, promises inscrutable mysteries and tense, psychological thrills in a surreal landscape.\" Over all, he determines each story \"has immersive characters for the reader to climb inside and abide in for awhile,\" and recommends the book as \"well worth your time.\"\nClay Kallam in the San Jose Mercury News also finds irony in Mercedes Lackey, \"best known for professionally written but seriously lightweight fantasies,\" editing \"fiction that [is] supposed to make you uncomfortable.\" He finds in the book's selections a \"tug-of-war\" between stories \"quite clearly meant to be literature, and others ... more focused on entertainment.\" He cites the Foster piece as an instance of the former, the Kress piece as an example of the latter, and the Vernon as one combining both traits: \"[I]f as a reader you land on one side of the fence or the other, you're bound to be a little disappointed, because half of the book won't make you happy. ... So on the one hand, this is a rather lukewarm recommendation for these books, but on the other, they show the depth and creative power of the genre.\"\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Norman Spinrad in ''Asimov's Science Fiction, v. 40, no. 10/11, Oct./Nov. 2016, and Lynne Bispham in Vector'' 284, summer 2016.\nNotes"
