The battle is considered a prelude to the 30-year old unification war, culminating in the establishment of Saudi Arabia in 1932.\nIn late 1901, following the end of the Second Saudi State, the Al Saud clan was forced to move to Kuwait after Riyadh had fallen to the Al Rashid family. Ibn Saud, the head of the clan, requested supplies and men from the Kuwaiti Emir to retake his hometown. The Kuwaiti prince, who was also involved in several wars with the Rashidis, acceded to Ibn Saud's request and gave him horses and arms.\nAfter he arrived he said. \"Judgment belongs to God and then to Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Al Saud\".\nIn January 1902, Ibn Saud and his men returned to Riyadh and successfully assaulted the castle. He captured and killed Ibn Ajlan (Chief of Riyadh) after morning prayers, and Abdul Aziz held Ibn Ajlan's head and threw it to the people of Riyadh.\nAbdul Aziz's victory marked the start of three decades of fighting that would ultimately see him unite nearly all of central Arabia under his rule. It also marked the beginning of the Third Saudi State, which evolved into present-day Saudi Arabia.\nLegacy\n* In 1999, King Fahd bin Abdulaziz inaugurated the King Abdulaziz Historical Center in Riyadh to commemorate the centenary anniversary of the battle. Simultaneously, the Palm Oasis Park was also opened to the public that featured one-hundred date palm trees, signifying the 100th anniversary of the battle as per the Hijri calendar.\n* In 2013, Al Abtal Gate monument was inaugurated on Highway 40 in southwestern Riyadh. The monument pays tribute to King Abdulaziz ibn Saud and his companions in taking over the walled town of Riyadh.\nSee also\n* History of Saudi Arabia\n* List of wars involving Saudi Arabia\nReferences"
