The Empire League plays a 40-game regular season followed by a five-game post season. The five-team league consists exclusively of teams based in Upstate New York. League offices are in Tampa, Florida.\nHistory\nThe Empire League is a replacement of the North Country Baseball League, which folded after one season (and was itself a last-minute replacement for the East Coast Baseball League, which disbanded before the start of the 2015 season). The league fielded four teams based in the states of New York, New Hampshire and Maine for its inaugural season.\nIt is a low-budget league meant to give players recently graduated from college or with little professional experience an opportunity at staying in shape and providing them the chance at being signed to higher level league contracts with affiliated or independent teams. All league funding comes from advertisement sales, ticket sales and tryout revenue.\nThe league is operated by Eddie Gonzalez, former professional baseball player and NAIA All-American at Webber International University. Gonzalez is also a former NCBL executive.\nThe Sullivan Explorers, despite finishing the regular season with a losing record, won the 2016 league championship over the regular season winner Watertown Bucks.\nPrior to the league's second season, the Watertown Bucks lost the lease to their stadium and were replaced by the Plattsburgh Redbirds. The New Hampshire Wild ceased operations and were replaced by a team from Puerto Rico; however, since a stadium deal in Puerto Rico had not yet been finalized, the team played the 2017 season as a travel team.\nThe league expanded to six teams for the 2018 season with two new franchises selected from four of the nine interested parties visited in 2017. On February 23, 2018, the league announced that one team will be a revival of the New Hampshire Wild, and the sixth team would be the return of the New York Bucks, formerly known as the Watertown Bucks.\nOn May 31, 2018, the league announced the Puerto Rico Islanders will play in Rincon, Puerto Rico, and the Sullivan Explorers would be known as the Aguada Explorers. For 2019, the Explorers would become a traveling team, and the Surge would move to Saranac Lake, New York.\nDue to Covid-19, the 2020 Empire Professional Baseball League was held at Consol Energy Park in Washington, Pennsylvania.\nIn 2021, the Empire Professional Baseball League returned to normal operating procedures with the following teams: the Saranac Lake Surge, the Tupper Lake Riverpigs, the Plattsburgh Thunderbirds and the New Hampshire Wild.\nIn 2022, the New Hampshire Wild were replaced by the Japan Islanders, a traveling team composed of mostly native Japanese players.\nThe 2023 season saw the league expand to five teams with the addition of the Malone Border Hounds.\nThe 2024 season saw the Japan Islanders leave the Empire League, while the Plattsburgh Thunderbirds rebranded to the North County Thunderbirds. Luis Contreras became the first Empire Baseball League alum to be promoted to the major leagues when he was recalled by the Houston Astros June 23, 2024.  Contreras pitched for the Puerto Rico Islands in 2018 recording a 3-1 record with a 1.74 earned-run average in 57 innings.\nIn February of 2025, the league announced that the Los Angeles Bullies would be joining the league. They are a travel team and will not play in Los Angeles.\nTeams\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Team\n!First season\n!City\n!Stadium\n|-\n| Malone Border Hounds\n| 2023\n| Malone, New York\n| American Legion Post 219 Veterans Field\n|-\n| North Country Thunderbirds\n| 2017\n| Fort Covington, New York\n| Salmon River Park\n|-\n| Saranac Lake Surge\n| 2016\n| Saranac Lake, New York\n| Petrova Field\n|-\n| Tupper Lake Riverpigs\n| 2020\n| Tupper Lake, New York\n| Municipal Park\n|-\n|Los Angeles Bullies\n|2025\n|Travel Team\n|Travel Team\n|}\nChampions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Champion\n!Runner-up\n!Result\n|-\n|2016\n|Sullivan Explorers\n|Watertown Bucks\n|2–0 (best-of 3)\n|-\n|2017\n|Plattsburgh Redbirds\n|Old Orchard Beach Surge\n|3–1 (best-of 5)\n|-\n|2018\n|Puerto Rico Islanders\n|New York Bucks\n|2–1 (best-of 3)\n|-\n|2019\n|Plattsburgh Thunderbirds\n|New Hampshire Wild\n|2–0 (best-of 3)\n|-\n|2020\n|Baseball Brilliance Sox\n|Saranac Lake Surge\n|1–0 (single game final)\n|-\n|2021\n| Saranac Lake Surge\n|Plattsburgh Thunderbirds\n|3–0 (best-of 5)\n|-\n|2022\n|Tupper Lake Riverpigs\n|Plattsburgh Thunderbirds\n|3–2 (best-of 5)\n|-\n|2023\n|Malone Border Hounds\n|Plattsburgh Thunderbirds\n|2–0 (best-of 3)\n|-\n|2024\n|Tupper Lake Riverpigs\n|North Country Thunderbirds\n|2–0 (best-of 3)\n|-\n|2025\n|Malone Border Hounds\n|Tupper Lake Riverpigs\n|3–0 (best-of 5)\n|}\nSee also\n* Empire State Greys, a traveling team of EPBL players formed in 2022 to compete in the Frontier League\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
