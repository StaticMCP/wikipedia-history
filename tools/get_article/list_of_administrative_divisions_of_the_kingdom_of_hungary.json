The names are given in the main official language used in the Kingdom at the times in question.\nFor details on the functioning and development of the counties and some other administrative divisions see Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary.\naround 1880]]\nNotes\nThis article does not show all states of administrative divisions that existed throughout the centuries, only the major ones. Especially for the medieval period, various sources often give slightly different divisions. Also, the lists of the individual points of time stem from different sources so that the first-level categorization is not necessarily compatible over time.\n1038\nAround 1074\nAround 1074, the whole Kingdom of Hungary consisted of some 45–50 counties. The existence of many of them is disputed for this time period.\nCounties\nFrontier counties\nThe following castles are assumed to have been seats of frontier counties (marchiae, határispánságok), it is probable that other castles were such seats as well (ordered from the north to the south):\n* in present-day Slovakia: Bratislava (at that time: Bresburc/ Preslawaspurch/Poson), Hlohovec (at that time: Golguc/Golgoc), Trenčín (at that time: Treinchen), Beckov (at that time: Blundus), Nitra (at that time: Nitria), Šintava (at that time: Sempte), Gemer Castle (at that time: Gomur), Zemplin Castle (at that time: Zemněn, Zemlyn)\n* in present-day Ukraine: Uzhhorod (Ungvár), Borsova\n* in present-day Hungary: Moson Castle, Sopron, Novum Castrum (Hungarian at that time: Újvár), Borsod Castle, Vasvár, Karakó (near Jánosháza), Zalavár (called Kolon at that time)\n* present-day Romania: Dobaca (Hungarian: Doboka), Alba Iulia (Hungarian: Gyulafehérvár), Cluj-Napoca (Hungarian: Kolozsvár), Satu Mare (Hungarian: Szatmárnémeti), Timișoara (Hungarian: Temesvár), Turda (Hungarian: Torda)\n* present-day Croatia: Vukovar (Hungarian: Valkóvár)\n* present-day Serbia: Belgrade (Hungarian at that time: Fehérvár), Stara Palanka (Hungarian: Haram (Krassó)), Kovin (Hungarian: Kéve)\n15th century\nIn the late 14th and in the 15th century there were around 70 counties, out of which 7(?) under the voivodship of Transylvania (in present-day Romania), 7 under the banate of Slavonia (mainly in present-day Slavonia and Croatia), and the rest forming Hungary proper (mainly present-day Hungary and Slovakia, with 10 counties entirely and 11 partially in present-day Slovakia.\nCounties\nHungary proper\n----\nTransylvania\nSpecial status\nHungary proper\n*Halasszék (a sedes)\n*Jászság\n*Kolbázszék (a sedes)\n*Kunság\n*Provincia XXIV oppidorum terrae Scepusiensis (in 1412, thirteen of the towns were pawned to Poland and kept a special status)\nTransylvania\n*Aranyensis sedes (Hungarian:Aranyosszék)\n*Csikiensis sedes (Csíkszék)\n*Giergiensis sedes (Gyergyószék)\n*Kászonszék (a sedes; Casin in Romanian)\n*Kesdiensis sedes (Kézdiszék)\n*Marusiensis sedes (Marosszék)\n*Orbai sedes (Orbaiszék)\n*Sepsiensis sedes (Sepsiszék)\n*Udvarhelyensis sedes (Udvarhelyszék)\nFree royal towns and the mining towns (Liberae regiae civitate et civitates montanae)\nTheir number was changing (the mining towns were largely situated in the Upper Lands – present-day Slovakia)\n16th–18th centuries\nIn the 16th century, the Kingdom was so gravely impacted by Ottoman conquest that its territory was reduced to almost a third of its previous size. By 1541, the remaining part was renamed Royal Hungary and ruled by the Habsburgs.\nCaptaincies (1547 – 1699)\n250px\nIn 1547, Royal Hungary was divided for military and partly also administrative purposes in two captaincies-general (Hungarian: főkapitányságok,  Slovak: hlavné kapitanáty):\n*Cisdanubia (largely present-day Slovakia)\n*Transdanubia (the remaining Royal Hungary).\nLater on, these captaincies were further subdivided.\nIn 1553 and 1578, southern and southeastern regions were split off into the Military Frontier and were de facto no longer part of the Kingdom.\nAlso, after 1606 there were the following captaincies-general:\n*Captaincy of Upper Hungary (eastern Slovakia and adjacent northeastern present-day Hungary, part of present-day northern Romania and part of Carpathian Ruthenia, created 1563)\n*Captaincy of Lower Hungary (western and central Slovakia, created 1563)\n*Captaincy of Győr (territories between Lake Balaton and river Danube)\n*Captaincy of Kanizsa (western Hungary)\n*Captaincy of Croatia (western Croatia)\n*Captaincy of Slavonia (northern Croatia)\nCounties (1699 - 1848)\nNote that many of the counties ceased to exist during the Turkish occupation (app. 1541 – 1699/1718). For administrative divisions on the Turkish territory see Ottoman Empire.\nAfter the defeat of the Turks there were some 70 counties in the whole Kingdom of Hungary again. After the final defeat of the Turks in 1718, the three southern counties Temesiensis, Torontaliensis and Krassovinsis created the special administrative district Banatus Temesiensis (Hungarian: Temesi Bánság). This district was dissolved again in 1779, but its southernmost part remained part of the Military Frontier (Confiniaria militaria)  till the late 19th century.\nThe following list does not show Transylvania. The \"districtus\" is only a traditional formal division. Note that some of the previous counties, e. g. the Zarandiensis, were part of Transylvania at this time.\n(a) Districtus Cis-Danubianus (13):\n*Arvensis\n*Bacsensis\n*Barsiensis\n*Honthiensis\n*Lyptoviensis\n*Nitriensis\n*Neogradiensis\n*Pesthiensis\n*Posoniensis\n*Strigoniensis\n*Trenchiniensis\n*Turocziensis\n*Zoliensis\n(b) Districtus Trans-Danubianus (11):\n*Albensis\n*Baranyiensis\n*Castriferrei\n*Comaromiensis\n*Jauriensis\n*Mosoniensis,\n*Simigiensis\n*Soproniensis\n*Tolnensis\n*Vesprimiensis\n*Szaladiensis\n(c) Districtus Cis-Tybiscanus (10):\n*Abaujvariensis\n*Bereghiensis\n*Borsodiensis\n*Gömöriensis\n*Hevesiensis et Szolnok mediocris\n*Sarosiensis\n*Scepusiensis\n*Tornensis\n*Unghvariensis\n*Zempliniensis\n(d) Districtus Trans-Tibiscanus (12):\n*Aradiensis\n*Bekesiensis\n*Bihariensis\n*Csanadiensis\n*Csongradiensis\n*Krassovinsis\n*Maramarosiensis\n*Szabolcsensis\n*Szathmariensis\n*Temesiensis\n*Torontaliensis\n*Ugotgensis\n(e) Counties between the Drava and Sava (after the defeat of the Turks around 1700, they were considered part of Croatia-Slavonia):\n*Poseganus\n*Sirmiensis\n*Verovitiensis/Vukovariensis\nFree districts (Circuli/Districtus liberi)\nThese were privileged territories, which were totally exempt from the county system.\n* Districtus Jazygum et Cumanum ()\n* Oppida sedecim Scepusiensia - since 1772 (First Partition of Poland); before 1772 the towns were pawned to Poland and had another special status\n* Oppida privilegiata Hajdonicalia () – since the 17th century\nFree royal towns and the mining towns (Liberae regiae civitate et civitates montanae)\nTheir number was changing\nAfter the 1848/1849 Revolution\nFor details see Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)\n1849–1860\nin 1850, showing the five military districts]]\nDuring this period, the Kingdom of Croatia (with Međimurje), Kingdom of Slavonia, and the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banatus Temesiensis () were separated from the Kingdom of Hungary and directly subordinated to Vienna (Austria). The remaining territory of the Kingdom of Hungary (which did not include Transylvania at that time) was divided into 5 Districts. These Districts were divided into counties, whose traditional territories were modified in 1850 and 1853; several of the traditional counties were merged or partitioned. The official language during this period was German. The districts and counties were:\n;Pest-Ofen}}\n*Pest-Pilis.

In 1868 Transylvania was definitely reunited with Hungary proper, and the town and district of Fiume (Rijeka) declared autonomous. In 1873 part of the Military Frontier was united with Hungary proper and part with Croatia-Slavonia. Hungary proper, according to ancient usage, was generally divided into four great divisions or circles, and Transylvania up to 1876 was regarded as the fifth.\nIn 1876 a general system of counties was introduced. According to this division Hungary proper was divided into seven statistical regions having no administrative functions, of which Transylvania formed one.\nThe following administrative divisions existed between 1886 and 1920:\nRural counties\nIn the following, the key in the brackets gives the capital towns around 1910 first (note however that the capitals were usually changing throughout the centuries) and then the abbreviation for the country in which the territory is situated today:\nThe Kingdom of Hungary was divided into the following 71 counties:\nHungary proper\n(a) On the left bank of the Danube:\n#Árva County (Alsókubin, SK, PL)\n#Bars County (Aranyosmarót, SK)\n#Esztergom County (Esztergom, SK, HU)\n#Hont County (Ipolyság, SK, HU)\n#Liptó County (Liptószentmiklós, SK)\n#Nógrád County (Balassagyarmat, SK, HU)\n#Nyitra County (Nyitra, SK)\n#Pozsony County (Pozsony, SK, HU)\n#Trencsén County (Trencsén, SK)\n#Turóc County (Turócszentmárton, SK)\n#Zólyom County (Besztercebánya, SK)\n(b) On the right bank of the Danube:\n#Baranya County (Pécs, HU, HR)\n#Fejér County (Székesfehérvár, HU)\n#Győr County (Győr, HU, SK)\n#Komárom County (Komárom, SK, HU)\n#Moson County (Mosonmagyaróvár, HU, AT, SK)\n#Somogy County (Kaposvár, HU)\n#Sopron County (Sopron, HU, AT)\n#Tolna County (Szekszárd, HU)\n#Vas County (Szombathely, HU, AT, SI)\n#Veszprém County (Veszprém, HU)\n#Zala County (Zalaegerszeg, HU, HR, SI)\n(c) Between the Danube and Tisza:\n#Bács-Bodrog County (Zombor, HU, SR)\n#Csongrád County (Szentes, HU, SR)\n#Heves County (Eger, HU)\n#Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok County (Szolnok, HU)\n#Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun County (Budapest, HU)\n(d) On the right bank of the Tisza:\n#Abaúj-Torna County (Kassa, SK, HU) Note: formed in 1881 from the counties of Abaúj County and Torna County.\n#Bereg County (Beregszász, UA, HU)\n#Borsod County (Miskolc, HU)\n#Gömör és Kis-Hont County (Rimaszombat, SK, HU)\n#Sáros County (Eperjes, SK)\n#Szepes County (Lőcse, SK, PL)\n#Ung County (Ungvár, UA, SK, HU)\n#Zemplén County (Sátoraljaújhely, SK, HU)\n(e) On the left bank of the Tisza:\n#Békés County (Gyula, HU)\n#Bihar County (Nagyvárad, RO, HU)\n#Hajdú County (Debrecen, HU)\n#Máramaros County (Máramarossziget, UA, RO)\n#Szabolcs County (Nyíregyháza, HU, UA)\n#Szatmár County (Nagykároly, RO, HU)\n#Szilágy County (Zilah, RO)\n#Ugocsa County (Nagyszőllős, UA, RO)\n(f) Between the Tisza and the Maros:\n#Arad County (Arad, RO, HU)\n#Csanád County (Makó, HU, RO)\n#Krassó-Szörény County (Lugos, RO) Note: formed in 1880 from the counties of Krassó County and Szörény County.\n#Temes County (Temesvár, RO, SR)\n#Torontál County (Nagybecskerek, SR, RO, HU)\n(g) Királyhágón túl (i.e. \"over the royal pass through the mountains\", roughly equal to Transylvania, all in present-day Romania):\n#Alsó-Fehér County (Nagyenyed)\n#Beszterce-Naszód County (Beszterce)\n#Brassó County (Brassó)\n#Csík County (Csíkszereda)\n#Fogaras County (Fogaras)\n#Háromszék County (Sepsiszentgyörgy)\n#Hunyad County (Déva)\n#Kis-Küküllő County (Dicsőszentmárton)\n#Kolozs County (Kolozsvár)\n#Maros-Torda County (Marosvásárhely)\n#Nagy-Küküllő County (Segesvár)\n#Szeben County (Nagyszeben)\n#Szolnok-Doboka County (Dés)\n#Torda-Aranyos County (Torda)\n#Udvarhely County (Székelyudvarhely)\nKingdom of Croatia and Slavonia\nKingdom of Croatia and Slavonia was divided into eight counties (all, except for most of Syrmia, in present-day Croatia):\n#Bjelovar-Križevci (Bjelovar, HR)\n#Lika-Krbava (Gospić, HR)\n#Modruš-Rijeka (Ogulin, HR)\n#Požega (Požega, HR)\n#Syrmia (Vukovar, HR, SR)\n#Varaždin (Varaždin, HR)\n#Virovitica (Osijek, HR)\n#Zagreb (Zagreb, HR)\nTowns with municipal rights\nThe following 30 Hungarian towns had municipal rights:\nHungary proper\nHungary proper had twenty-six urban counties or towns with municipal rights.\nThese were:\n* Arad\n* Baja\n* Debrecen\n* Győr\n* Hódmezővásárhely\n* Kassa (Košice)\n* Kecskemét\n* Kolozsvár (Cluj)\n* Komárom (Komárno)\n* Marosvásárhely (Târgu Mureş)\n* Miskolc (from 1909)\n* Nagyvárad (Oradea)\n* Pancsova (Pančevo)\n* Pécs\n* Pozsony (Bratislava)\n* Selmecbánya and Bélabánya (Banská Štiavnica and Banská Belá) – one urban county\n* Sopron\n* Szabadka (Subotica)\n* Szatmárnémeti (Satu Mare)\n* Szeged\n* Székesfehérvár\n* Temesvár (Timișoara)\n* Újvidék (Novi Sad)\n* Versec (Vršac)\n* Zombor (Sombor)\n* Budapest – the capital of the country.\nCroatia-Slavonia\nIn Croatia-Slavonia there were four urban counties or towns with municipal rights namely:\n* Eszék (Osijek)\n* Varasd (Varaždin)\n* Zágráb (Zagreb)\n* Zimony (Zemun)\nFiume (Rijeka)\nThe town and district of Fiume (Rijeka) formed a separate division.
