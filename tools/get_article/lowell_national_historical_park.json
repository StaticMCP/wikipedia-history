Established in 1978 a few years after Lowell Heritage State Park, it is operated by the National Park Service and comprises a group of different sites in and around the city of Lowell related to the era of textile manufacturing in the city during the Industrial Revolution.  In 2019, the park was included as Massachusetts' representative in the America the Beautiful Quarters series.\nHistory\n:See the History of Lowell, Massachusetts article for a detailed history of the city\nFirst settled by Europeans in the 17th century, East Chelmsford (later renamed Lowell in honor of the founders' deceased business partner) became an important manufacturing center along the Merrimack River in the early 1820s. It was seen as an attractive site for the construction of a planned industrial city, with the Middlesex Canal (completed in 1803) linking the Merrimack to the Charles River, which flows through Boston, and with the powerful 32' Pawtucket Falls.  The already existent Pawtucket Canal, designed for transportation around the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack, became the feeder canal for a 5.6-mile long system of power canals based around the falls. Unlike many other mill towns, however, Lowell's manufacturing facilities were built based on a planned community design. Specifically Lowell was planned as reaction to the mill communities in Great Britain, which were perceived as cramped and inhumane. Some called it the \"Lowell Experiment\", which was an attempt at creating a manufacturing center with a combination of production efficiency with democratic morals and social structure.\nInitially the factories of Lowell were built with ample green space and accompanying clean dormitories, in a style that anticipated such later architectural trends as the City Beautiful movement in the 1890s.  Lowell attracted both immigrants from abroad and migrants from within New England and Quebec (including a large proportion of young women, known as Lowell mill girls) who lived in the dormitories and worked in the mills.\nThe textile industry in New England experienced a sharp decline after World War II and by the 1960s, many of the Lowell's textile mill buildings were abandoned.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, several important forces came together from which emerged the Lowell National Historical Park. Congressman F. Bradford Morse assisted in the city's selection for \"Model Cities\" status; Brendan Fleming, UMass Lowell (UML) Math Department faculty member, after his election to the Lowell City Council proposed the first Historic District \"The Mill and Canal District\" which was approved in 1972; Gordon Marker, executive director of Model Cities and an urban planner, was  instrumental in designing the concept for an Urban Park based on Historic Preservation and Economic Revitalization; Patrick Mogan, Education Administrator and later Superintendent of Schools, was primarily interested in Lowell's children and strongly advocated the preservation and sharing of their cultural experiences; and the Lowell Historical Society which opened the Lowell Museum in 1976.  Together these circles of interest became a collaborating force led by United States Senator and Lowell native Paul Tsongas to enact legislation for a national park.  In 1978, the United States Congress established the Lowell National Historical Park, the Lowell Historic Preservation District, and the Lowell Historic Preservation Commission.\nIn 1990, The Trust for Public Land assisted the National Park Service in acquiring 3 acres for the purpose of housing the headquarters for the Lowell National Historical Park.\nLegislative history of Lowell\nLowell National Historic Park was established by the Lowell Establishment Act in 1978. Lowell National Historical Park was established due to its significant cultural and historical sites and structures. This significance of these cultural and historical sites and structures symbolized aspects of the Industrial Revolution. Lowell is also represented to be the most significant planned industrialized city in the United States, which is a very important historical aspect in United States history. Another factor is that the immigration of different ethnic groups during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was represented in Lowell's neighborhoods. Preserving this area of land would allow for these representations to still be preserved in Lowell's neighborhoods. Even though the city of Lowell had a large budget for cultural and historical preservation, they would still need the assistance of the federal government to ensure that all necessary early buildings and structures were preserved. The extra protection and funding by the federal government will allow for the preservation of these lands. By establishing Lowell as a National Park that is protected by the federal government, the history and significance of the Industrial Revolution, as well as cultural aspects would be preserved and shared with present and future generations.\nIn 2012, The Lowell National Historical Park Land Exchange Act of 2012 was added to the original legislation to allow for land within park boundaries to be exchanged with land owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the city of Lowell, or the University of Massachusetts building authority. Lowell National Historic Park is an originally established park and did not replace a previously established site.\nAdministrative history of Lowell\nChronological order of superintendents:\n* Lewis S.

The visitor center provides a free self-guided tour of the history of Lowell, including display exhibits such as the patent model of a loom by local inventor S. Thomas.\nA footpath along the Merrimack Canal from the visitor center is lined with plaques describing the importance of various existing and former sites along the canal. The Boott Mills along the Merrimack River, on the Eastern Canal, is the most fully restored manufacturing site in the district, and one of the oldest.  The Boott Mill provides a walk-through museum with living recreations of the textile manufacturing process in the 19th century. The walking tour includes a detour to a memorial to local author Jack Kerouac, who described the mid-20th century declined state of Lowell in several of his books. A walkway along the river leads to several additional unrestored mill sites, providing views of restored and unrestored canal raceways once used by the mills.  Additionally, the park includes the Patrick J Mogan Cultural Center, which focuses on the lives of Lowell's many generations of immigrants.  Other exhibits include a working streetcar line, canal boat tours exploring some of the city's gatehouses and locks, and the River Transformed / Suffolk Mill Turbine Exhibit, which shows how water power, the Francis Turbine, ran Lowell's textile factories.\nPhoto gallery\nFile:U.S. President Carter signs creation of Lowell National Historical Park (1978).jpg|U.S. President Jimmy Carter (center) with Ted Kennedy (left) and Paul Tsongas signs the creation of Lowell National Historical Park, 1978\nFile:Boott_cotton_mill_looms.jpg|Authentic Looms in the Boott Cotton Mill and Museum\nFile:Front_of_boott_mill.jpg|The Boott Cotton Mill and Museum and Park Trolley\nFile:Lowell_boat_tour.jpg|The Park offers boat tours of the historic Lowell Canal System\nFile:suffolk mill turbine exhibit.jpg|The River Transformed Exhibit at the Wannalancit Mill\nFile:Lowell Park HQ.jpg|Park Headquarters, Paige Street\nFile:From Turbine to Line Shaft.webm|From turbine to line shaft at Suffolk Mills, part of the River Transformed Exhibit\nFile:From line shaft to power looms.ogv|From line shaft to power looms at Boott Mills\nSee also\n* Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Lowell, Massachusetts\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nps.gov/lowe/index.htm  Official Lowell National Historical Park website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090830202618/http://www.nps.gov/lowe/parkmgmt/upload/Partner%20Report%2009%20spreads%20lo-res.pdf Lowell National Historical Park 2009 Annual Report]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090513214512/http://www.nps.gov/lowe/parkmgmt/upload/Heritage%20Preservation%20and%20Development%20White%20Paper%20A.pdf Heritage Preservation and Development White Paper:  A 30 Year Assessment of Lowell National Historical Park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080828041556/http://nps.gov/lowe/parkmgmt/upload/Presentation%20of%20Lowell%20Stories%20White%20Paper%20A.pdf Presentation of Lowell Stories White Paper:  A 30 Year Assessment of Interpretation and Education at Lowell National Historical Park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070625080841/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/21boott/21boott.htm ''Building America's Industrial Revolution: The Boott Cotton Mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, a National Park Service Teaching with Historic Places (TwHP) lesson plan]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110418053603/http://www.cathystanton.net/lowell-exp.html The Lowell Experiment:  Public History in a Postindustrial City by Cathy Stanton (ethnographic study of the work of Lowell NHP)]\n* [https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442236288/Mill-Power-The-Origin-and-Impact-of-Lowell-National-Historical-Park Mill Power: The Origin and Impact of Lowell National Historical Park'' by Paul Marion 2014]"
