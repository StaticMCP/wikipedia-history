The French forces were defeated and forced to leave the town. In this struggle, died two distinguished Spanish leaders, Salvador de Molina and Colonel Juan Drimgold.\nBackground\nThe Spanish campaign in late 1809 had started with the Battle of Talavera.\nDel Parque led the northern army in a two pronged offensive against Madrid. He enjoyed some success at first, pushing back Marchand and the VI Corps at Tamames. Then the southern army met disaster at the Battle of Ocaña. Historian David Gates wrote,\nMarchand again left Salamanca to the enemy and fell back to the Douro, uniting with Kellermann's colonne mobile - which had hastened to his assistance - at Medina del Campo. After fighting a cursory engagement there, however, Del Parque learnt of the Ocaña débâcle and, realising that Joseph's forces were now free to concentrate against him, went into immediate retreat for the sanctuary of the sierras.\nAftermath\nThe Spanish campaign in late 1809 proceeded with the second Madrid offensive in the Battle of Alba de Tormes, where Kellermann and Marchand caught up with Del Parque on 26 November 1809 and inflicted a stinging defeat on the Spanish army.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
