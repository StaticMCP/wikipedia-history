Prior to the Battle of Arsal in August 2014, the Lebanese Army has tried to keep out of it and the violence has been mostly between various factions within the country and overt Syrian involvement has been limited to airstrikes and occasional accidental incursions.\nEarly incidents\nBab al-Tabbaneh district and the Alawite-predominant Jabal Mohsen district in 2011]]\nIn interfactional clashes in Tripoli between Sunnis and Alawites, seven people were killed and 59 wounded, on 17 June 2011. Clashes erupted following a rally in support of Syrian protesters. Fighting broke out between gunmen positioned in the rival neighborhoods of Jabal Mohsen (mainly Alawites who support the Syrian government) and Bab al-Tabbaneh (mainly Sunnis, supporting the Syrian uprising). Among the dead were a Lebanese army soldier and an official from the Alawite Arab Democratic Party.\nFrom 10 to 11 February 2012, two or three people died in fighting in Tripoli's neighborhoods of Jabal Mohsen and Bab al-Tebbaneh. An intervention by the Lebanese Army resulted in the injury of six soldiers.\nOn 29 April 2012, the Lebanese navy confiscated a large consignment of arms and ammunition on the container ship \"Lutfallah II,\" which was headed for the port of Tripoli in northern Lebanon before it was intercepted. The ship had begun its voyage from Libya and it is generally believed the consignment was destined for the rebels in Syria. Four people were also wounded during a clash between supporters of the Syrian opposition and Sunni supporters of Assad from the Tawheed Movement.\nMay 2012 Bab al-Tabbaneh–Jabal Mohsen clashes\nIn May 2012, Salafists demanded the release of a Sunni Islamist, Shadi Mawlawi, who had been arrested on charges of belonging to a terrorist organization.\nThe arrest of Mawlawi triggered a new round of fighting between Islamists and Alawites in Tripoli. Two to four people were killed when fighting erupted on the night of 12 May 2012. In the evening of 12 May, rocket-propelled grenades were used in an Alawite enclave and surrounding Sunni neighbourhoods in the port city. Hours before the clashes, Lebanese troops exchanged fire with a group of Islamists protesting in Tripoli for the release of a terrorism suspect. The Islamists tried to approach the offices of the pro-Syrian Syrian Social Nationalist Party. In all, three of the dead were reportedly Sunni civilians, while one was an army officer.\nThe fighting continued on 14 May, which resulted in the death of five Alawites and one Sunni. The army then deployed to the area on 15 May, and engaged in gunbattles with residents that left eight wounded, including a soldier.

On 22 May, the Islamist Shadi Mawlawi was released in Tripoli.\nOn 24 May, the Islamist protesters in Tripoli threatened that their demonstrations would spread all over Lebanon if about 180 Islamists arrested and accused of participating in the 2007 Lebanon conflict were not released.\nBeirut clashes\nOn 20 May 2012, the evening following the killing of Sheikh Abdel-Wahid, clashes erupted in Beirut's Tariq Jdideh neighborhood between armed Sunni militants of the Future Movement and Sunnis of the Arab Movement Party, leaving three dead and ten wounded and creating a tense security situation in the capital and the country as a whole.\nOn 6 September 2012, two people were wounded in gunfights between Future Movement members in Beirut, and the army was deployed in the area.\nKidnappings\nIn May 2012, Syrian opposition members kidnapped three pro-Syrian government Lebanese in the village of Zeita near the Syrian border.

The kidnappers said they would release the pilgrims if Lebanon recognised the Syrian opposition. Of 11 hostages being held, one was released on 25 August.\nIn late May, two Lebanese farmers were kidnapped and transported to Syria by pro-Syrian government forces.

The armed branch of the clan threatened more actions if he was not released. Several others who were kidnapped earlier were released as they were not affiliated with the FSA. As a result of the kidnappings and warnings, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and other Gulf Arab countries warned its citizens to leave Lebanon. Hezbollah's Nasrallah said the situation was out of control and, in turn, prompted criticism of Hezbollah by 14 March.\nJune–July Tripoli clashes\nOn 30 May 2012, two people were wounded in clashes between the Bab al-Tabbaneh and Jabal Mohsen neighborhoods.\nOn 2–3 June, 15 people were killed and over 60 wounded in clashes around Tripoli.

Syria has repeatedly called for an intensified crackdown on rebels that it claims are hiding in Lebanese border towns.\nOn 11 October 2012, shells fired by the Syrian military hit Masharih al-Qaa, where previous shelling incidents have caused fatalities. Lebanon's position of ignoring the attacks remained unchanged.\nIn October Hassan Nasrallah denied Hezbollah was fighting alongside the Syrian army, but that Lebanese in Syria were only protecting Lebanese inhabited villages from the Free Syrian Army.\nJune 2012 refugee camp clashes\nOn 16 June 2012, a Palestinian man was killed and eight others were wounded in clashes with the Lebanese Army in Nahr al-Bared refugee camp.

Five of the soldiers were injured by gunfire, and another five after a grenade was lobbed at an army checkpoint.\nOn 22 August, the Lebanese Army deployed troops into the feuding neighborhoods.

However, al-Hassan himself had also been a prime suspect during the Hariri investigation, and had close ties with Saudi intelligence, and was said to have ties to Mossad.\nThe assassination triggered violent unrest throughout the country.
