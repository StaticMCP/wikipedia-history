In some cases  plaques have been recovered and preserved and, in a few cases, re-erected with or without the blessing of those administrating the scheme.\nThe scheme began in 1866. It was initially administered by the Society of Arts which referred to the plaques erected under its auspices as 'Memorial Tablets' (sometimes 'Memorial Tablets of Great Men And Events' or 'Memorial Tablets of Eminent Men'). This arrangement continued until December 1901 when, by agreement and with the encouragement of the Clerk to the Council Laurence Gomme, the scheme was taken over the London County Council which christened it 'Indication of Houses of Historical Interest in London'. The LCC ran the scheme until the County of London was abolished in 1965 when its successor body the Greater London Council (GLC) took charge and expanded the scheme into the newly created outer boroughs. With the abolition of the GLC in 1986, administration of the official London-wide blue plaque scheme passed to English Heritage.\nDuring the first 150 years of the scheme's operation, it was estimated that just over 100 houses bearing plaques had been demolished including 12 destroyed in the 1939-1945 war. The rules for the scheme, established by the Society of Arts in the early years of its operation, adopted and expanded on by the LCC in 1903 and formalised in 1954, require that plaques may generally only be affixed to a surviving building with a close association to the person commemorated. A practice whereby plaques would sometimes be re-erected at rebuilt properties with an explanatory supplementary tablet ceased in 1938. The post-1954 'authenticity rule' was relaxed on occasion by the LCC and GLC, but in the English Heritage era this has not been the case. If, after the loss of a commemorated building and retrieval of the plaque an appropriate alternative London address cannot be identified, the plaque cannot be reaffixed to the new building or remain part of the scheme. Houses bearing plaques to Captain Oates, Edward Lear and Hugh Dowding have been retrieved and placed in storage in recent years, there being no surviving alternative London address for any of these, whereas it has been possible for English Heritage to authentically re-site the plaque to Lilian Lindsay after the house to which it had originally been affixed was knocked down, an alternative residence having been identified.\nIndication of houses of historical interest in London\nDuring the period 1867–1902, the Society of Arts recorded the basic details of the 'memorial tablets' erected under its auspices in the periodical The Journal of the Society of Arts. After taking over the scheme, the London County Council issued a series of booklets detailing the work it was undertaking, each entitled 'Indication of Houses of Historical Interest in London' with a Roman numeral to indicate the order of publication. Each of these recorded the particulars of three or four recently erected plaques and included a short biography of each individual commemorated, details of the connection between person and property, and a simple line drawing of each plaque. Approximately 80 of these were published between 1903 and 1936. The booklets were also compiled and published as six hard bound volumes, issued in 1907, 1909, 1912, 1923, 1930 and 1938 (an expanded second edition of first volume was published in 1915). These were followed by a 'New Series' of 4-page leaflets covering one plaque each; these were entitled 'London Houses of Historical Interest marked by memorial tablets'. covering plaques erected between 1937 and 1940, incorporating photographs or illustrations of the subjects and houses instead of the plaque drawings. Curiously, whilst later sources make reference to eight of these, there are ten in the LCC material held by The London Archives, Nos.1 and 7 being used twice.\nThe material published by the LCC before 1948 seldom made reference to the plaques erected by its predecessor, the Society of Arts. The first and fifth bound volumes included appendices in which plaques erected by 'persons or authorities other than the London County Council' were listed, these containing brief details of the SOA plaques extant at the time of their publication. Only the plaque to Sarah Siddons, erected by the Society in 1876 and re-erected with a supplementary tablet provided by the LCC in 1905, was given its own illustrated 'chapter', a drawing of this plaque appearing in the eighth booklet published, subsequently reproduced in the first of the bound volumes.\nPublication of new 'Indication of houses of historical interest in London' leaflets ceased after the 1939–1945 war; simplified plaque lists were published by the LCC in 1947, 1952 and 1960 ('Commemorative Tablets on Houses of Historical Interest'), and by the GLC ('Blue Plaques on Houses of Historical Interest in London') in 1971. The GLC published an expanded version of the latter featuring a pull-out map indicating the locations of the 365 plaques then in existence in 1976.\nOfficial publications from the English Heritage era include the coffee-table sized Lived In London: blue plaques and the stories behind them by Emily Cole, published in association with English Heritage in 2009, and The English Heritage Guide to Blue Plaques by the scheme's senior historian, Howard Spencer, first published in 2016, a revised and updated second edition appearing in 2019.\nTo date, no definitive list of plaques lost to the official London scheme has been published. Identifying them is a matter of reconciling historic sources to the list of plaques maintained by English Heritage. In many cases, the fate of the building to which a lost plaque was affixed can be determined via the pages of the Survey of London.\nPlaques lost\nThis section records plaques removed from the official London Blue Plaque Scheme after the demolition of the building to which they were affixed. Members of the public with any information about the whereabouts of these memorials are encouraged to email missingplaques@english-heritage.org.uk.\nAdelphi Terrace was demolished in the 1930s. The brothers Adam are among the figures associated with Adelphi Terrace commemorated by an inscription into the stonework of a 1930s pier on the site made by the LCC in November 1951.

The house was demolished in 1963 and a block of flats – William Blake House – erected in its place. A privately erected marker recording the location of Blake's former residence was affixed to a wall in Marshall Street. Blake is commemorated jointly with the painter John Linnell by the scheme with an unusual oval fibreglass plaque at Old Wyldes', North End, Hampstead, this having been erected by the Greater London Council in 1975.\n| installed = 1907\n| removed = 1963\n| image = Lost Plaque LCC William Blake 28 Broad Street 1907.png\n| open_plaques =\n}}\nThe house was demolished in February 1915.

Boswell was subsequently commemorated by the scheme at two other locations - by the London County Council at 122 Great Portland Street, Fitzrovia in 1936 and jointly with Thomas Davies and Dr. Samuel Johnson at  8 Russell Street, Covent Garden by the Greater London Council in 1984.\n| installed = 1905\n| removed = 1915\n| image = Lost Plaque LCC James Boswell 56 Great Queen Street 1905.png\n| open_plaques =\n}}\nThe street was demolished in the late 1970s to make way for Mile End Park and, since no suitable alternative former residence exists, the plaque has not been rehung.\n| installed = 1961\n| removed = 1978\n| image =\n| open_plaques =\n}}\nThis area of London fell into decline in the early 20th century and by the mid-1950s was among the worst slums in London. Warwick Crescent was entirely cleared of properties by the council in the 1960s and new residences, to the design of the GLC's architect Hubert Bennett, constructed in their place. The fortunes of the area subsequently improved; it is now part of the Little Venice ward of the City of Westminster, one of the more affluent areas of the city. 19 Warwick Crescent itself was demolished in 1960. The plaque was retrieved prior to demolition and placed into storage by the London County Council but, in view of its unsuitability for re-use (owing to the dates of residence forming part of the inscription) accepted a request from 'a collector of Browningiana' to procure it in April 1961. The subsequent fate of the plaque has not been determined.

Plaques in the colour blue proved difficult to produce and, after the first four, the majority of the SOAs plaques would be terracotta. 24 Holles Street was lost to demolition in 1889. No evidence supporting Lord Byron's residency at a particular house number in Holles Street has been found and it is likely that neither the SOA plaque nor the three subsequent plaques placed by other organisations on roughly the same site actually marked his birthplace.\n| installed = 1867\n| removed = 1889\n| image =\n| open_plaques =\n}}\nwhere he had taken lodgings in 1813. This was one of a run of seven plaques made for the LCC between 1925 and 1926 by Doulton in the ‘Della Robbia’ style, featuring a colourful raised wreath surround, five of which survive as part of the scheme.

The second, another 'medallion' style bronze, was erected on 14  January 1916 at No.40 Prince's Gardens where Chamberlain had lived for over 30 years. In 1956 the adjacent Imperial College of Science and Technology, needing to expand, acquired Prince's Gardens for redevelopment.

Tennison's school moved to Kennington Oval in 1928; it closed due to falling admissions in 2023. Hogarth's plaque was removed after the former school building suffered bomb damage in the 1939-1945 war.

Park Crescent was damaged during the 1939-1945 war, and the plaque subsequently went missing. When the decision was taken by the Crown Estate to rebuild Park Crescent (with every intention of retaining the original Regency period facades by John Nash) plans for a new plaque were drawn up, but an appeal in The Lancet magazine led to the missing one being recovered; following the completion of the rebuild, Lister's plaque was unveiled for the second time in 1966.  Unfortunately, during further building work in 2018,the plaque disappeared again. It has not been found, and was removed from the English Heritage list in 2019. Lister was immediately shortlisted for a new plaque, though this was not to be installed at 12 Park Crescent, it having transpired that the house was not as authentic as previously believed. The 'original' facade - listed in 1954 and Grade I listed in February 1970 - was in fact not Nash's, but a facsimile dating from the 1960s rebuild  This discovery made the house ineligible for a memorial under the scheme rules.

Macaulay's plaque was removed for the final time in 2003, prior to the Atkins Buildings being demolished; the Tasker House development now occupies the site.

After a replacement was also vandalised, the owner declined the offer of a third. Despite this, it appears in the sixth and final volume of the LCC's 'Indication of houses of historical interest in London' published three years later, with no mention made of the plaque's loss. The area incorporating 41 Maitland Park Road was badly bombed during the 1939-1945 war, and was swept away in the 1950s to make way for the Maitland Park Estate. A brown Camden Borough Council plaque now marks the site.

This is understood to be the last 'memorial tablet' erected under the auspices of the SOA - the London County Council assuming responsibility for the scheme and erecting its first plaque in 1903. The precise fate of Milton's plaque - the only oblong example erected by the SOA, the shape being dictated by the position in which it had to be placed   - is yet to be determined. Having appeared in the appendices of the first volume of \"Indication of houses of historical interest in London\" in 1907,  the plaque is absent from the fifth volume published in 1930 and a plaque at 125 Bunhill Row affixed by the Corporation of London (which had begun its own plaque scheme c. 1925) is recorded instead.

The Survey of London,  recording (in 1937) the date of demolition as 1906, points out that, whilst many writers have stated that Peter the Great lodged at 15 Buckingham Street during his visit to England in 1697-1698, there does not seem to be a shred of contemporary evidence to substantiate the claim,  adding that a likely explanation is that a misreading of 'Norfolk Buildings' (Peter's first London residence being 21 Norfolk Street) as 'York Buildings' (Buckingham Street being part of the York House Estate) led an early researcher to conclude that No.15 best fit written descriptions of the house - No.14 being ruled out on the grounds that this was, at the time, occupied by Samuel Pepys - and so a misstatement arose which was copied by later generations of writers. The new buildings erected on the site of Nos.15 and 16 Buckingham Street in 1906 were destroyed by bombing during the 1939-1945 war.

The house subsequently fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1952. The plaque is listed as extant in the LCC's 'Tablet on Houses of Historical Interest' published 1960 suggesting the gate pier to which it was affixed might have survived for longer. All that survives of Pitt House today is a classical garden arch, now Grade II listed. Pitt would be commemorated by the scheme a second time, jointly with William Ewart Gladstone and Edward Geoffrey Stanley by the LCC at 10 St James's Square, St James's, on 4  October 1910.

The LCC erected a glazed ware plaque to record that Rennie, and the caricaturist John Leech, lived in a house on the site, on 21 March 1929. This too has been lost, the 1923 buildings being demolished in 1971. Construction of a new Waterloo bridge had begun in 1937 to the design of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott but completion was hampered by the 1939-45 war. The new bridge was officially opened in September 1942 but not fully completed until 1945. The memorial incorporating the plaque was dismantled when new buildings for the National Film Theatre were constructed on the site. It was intended to re-erect it when a suitable position could be determined. In the 1972, the Greater London council made detailed plans for a new memorial to John Rennie on the Victoria Embankment, near the northern abutment, and enquiries were made about the whereabouts of the components of the 1951 memorial, which could not be determined.\n| installed = 1951\n| removed = 1957\n| image =\n| open_plaques =\n}}\nhowever the 'date of execution' is recorded as being 1943 - the year after the bridge opened - which, if correct, is too early for it to be a picture of the bronze plaque. The material used appears to be stone or slate rather than bronze and the style of the plaque is quite similar to that of the well documented example erected to Lenin in Holcroft Square which had been put up, controversially, by the LCC in 1942 - during the period 1940-1947 when the plaque scheme was suspended as a wartime economy. What little evidence there is points to this being a different plaque which was replaced with the bronze tablet in 1951, now lost. The completion of the bridge was considered to be of national importance and construction was allowed to continue during the 1939-45 war. The earlier date for this plaque makes sense in the context of the new bridge being opened to traffic in 1942.\n| installed = 1943\n| removed = 1951\n| image =\n| open_plaques =\n}}\nbut lost to demolition six years later.

A surviving plaque to Algernon Swinburne and Theodore Watts-Dunton, erected in March 1926, is of a similar design. Latterly the house became derelict, the gardens being used as allotments during the 1939-1945 war. The 1952 edition of the LCC's 'Commemorative Tablets on Houses of Historical Interest' records the address as 40 North End Crescent. The Grange was demolished in 1958, the Lytton Estate being built on the site. Burne-Jones was commemorated by the London scheme for a second time in 1998, a plaque being erected by English Heritage at 41 Kensington Square, South Kensington - an address suggested to the LCC in 1927, rejected in favour of North End Road.

The land in question was donated by Sloane for use as a burial ground which the Survey of London recorded as 'long disused' and employed as a recreation ground 'for the old men and women of the adjoining workhouse' in 1913.

The plaque - a tablet affixed by brackets to all that remained of the by-now bombed out house - was unveiled by Maisky with the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden in attendance in March 1942 along with a bust of Lenin provided by the Soviet embassy. The unveiling ceremony was featured in a Pathe news reel in March 1942 and the 20 April 1942  edition of Life Magazine in a piece entitled 'England Falls in Love with Russia'. Immediately thereafter a more permanent display for the bust was sought and on the 22nd April 1942 a marble and concrete memorial to the design of Bernard Lubetkin was completed, sited opposite the remains of No. 30. Within a year the bust had to be replaced due to vandalism, and a police guard was mounted, an arrangement which quickly came to an end when Riley lost control of the council in 1946; the bust was subsequently attacked again and it became clear that the borough were no longer willing to keep the unpopular memorial on the site. Holford Square was cleared in 1948, and in 1951 - with the Cold War underway and the Berlin Airlift a recent memory - the tablet and bust were taken to Finsbury Town Hall for safekeeping. Lubetkin's casing was consigned by its designer to the foundations of Bevin Court. The intended final location for the memorial on completion of Bevin Court - which was to have been named Lenin Court before the Anglo-Soviet relationship turned frosty - can still be seen, to the right of the main entrance, together with a viewing aperture designed to allow the building's porter to oversee its wellbeing. The 1942 newsreel commentary states that the tablet would later be shipped to the Soviet Union but the change of political weather made this impractical and the tablet and bust remained at Finsbury Town Hall, then later the strongroom of Islington Town Hall, for almost thirty years. Mrs. Patricia Bradbury, then the newly elected Mayor of Islington, on learning of this when she took office in May 1972, suggested the plaque be gifted to the Soviets as was originally intended. This was duly arranged and the Russian Ambassador at the time, Mikhail Smirnovsky was formally presented with it on 1 January 1973. The bust of Lenin remained at Islington Town Hall until 1996 when it was transferred to Islington Museum.\n| installed = 1942\n| removed = 1946\n| image =\n| open_plaques =\n}}\nIn August of 1968 No.16–18 were demolished to make way for an extension of The Royal Scot Hotel. The plaque - which does not appear to have attracted the unwanted attention of vandals during the six years it was on show to the public - was retrieved by the Greater London Council who, in keeping with the scheme rules having refused consent for it to be rehung on the modern facsimile of a Victorian wall now fronting onto Percy Circus, gifted it to the Mayor of Moscow, Vladimir Promyslov in 1971. An unofficial memorial arranged by Trevor Burfield of Centremoor Ltd, the developer of the site, was erected in 1972, this being unveiled in August of that year - in the face of anti-Soviet demonstrations - by the then-Soviet Ambassador Mikhail Smirnovsky.

The plaque was re-erected for a second time in 1929 following the construction of an enlarged Bourne & Hollingsworth, with a new supplementary tablet, this with the inscription 'Tablet Fixed 1905: Premises rebuilt & tablet refixed 1929'. These moves contributed to the eventual deterioration of the plaque and it was replaced under the aegis of the Greater London Council in 1966 with a standard blue example, which, having been manufactured at the transition between the two bodies, bears the name of the London County Council which had been abolished on 1 April 1965. The 1929 supplementary tablet was removed at the same time - the space it occupied being patched with a stone panel matching the colour of the art deco façade [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge_1772-1834_plaque_Berners_Street.jpg which can still clearly be seen beneath the 1966 plaque].\n| installed = 1905\n| removed = 1966\n| image = Lost Plaque LCC Samuel Taylor Coleridge 71 Berners Street 1905.png\n| open_plaques =\n}}\n- the material used to make the majority of plaques for the scheme having been changed to Doulton glazed ware in 1923.\n| installed = 1985\n| removed = 1987\n| image =\n| open_plaques =\n}}\n| installed = 1956\n| removed = 2002\n| image =\n| open_plaques =\n}}\nwhich had weathered beyond the point of legibility.

The Council, being eager to recognise Green's connection to the East End of London, put up a second tablet of chocolate brown encaustic ware in his memory at St Philip's Vicarage, Newark Street, Whitechapel, on 19th April 1910.

The plaque was one of six made to a new and greatly simplified design introduced in 1939; the colour was described as a 'warm sepia', the lettering cream, and the wreath omitted, giving more space for the inscription. After the first, a thin white border was added. After the war, the LCC seems to have had a change of heart as after erecting the last three brown plaques (meant to be put up in 1940 but delayed by the hostilities) in 1947-8 they reverted to blue.

The drawing for the original plaque survives in the English Heritage archive, being reproduced on page 412 of 'Lived in London'. It was similar to the William Hazlitt plaque at 6 Frith Street, which was erected in 1905. This was also pale green in colour, but has weathered to light blue over time.

The plaque did not weather well - it was found to be damaged when inspected in 1988 and the decision made to replace it. Measurements having been taken, it transpired that a standard blue roundel would fit after all. The new English Heritage plaque - a standard blue ceramic roundel, 495mm (19½ inches) in diameter, was affixed in 1990. Fibreglass was used by the scheme on only one other occasion - a unique oval plaque commemorating William Blake and John Linnell at Old Wyldes', North End, Hampstead, this also being put up in 1975 - in this instance the material being chosen as suitable for attachment to the weatherboarded walls of the seventeenth century farmhouse.\n| installed = 1975\n| removed = 1990\n| image =\n| open_plaques =\n}}\nBadly weathered, it was replaced with a joint plaque to Sir Robert and his son Horace by the Greater London Council in  1976.\n| installed = 1881\n| removed = 1976\n| image =\n| open_plaques =\n}}\nHaving deteriorated, it was replaced with the present standard blue roundel by the LCC in 1951.\n| installed = 1905\n| removed = 1951\n| image = Lost Plaque LCC Thomas Young 48 Welbeck Street 1905.png\n| open_plaques =\n}}\n|}\nPlaques preserved\nThis section records plaques that, though removed from the official London Blue Plaque Scheme, still exist. The 'location' column indicates the original location of the plaque, not its current site. It is not uncommon for recovered plaques to be donated to museums or the plaques original sponsors. A number of plaques that have been rescued, in some cases for possible future reuse, are kept by English Heritage in archives at Wrest Park, Bedfordshire. The archive is not open to the public and the full contents of the collection are not currently available, however some of these 'orphaned' plaques were examined in two short films made by English Heritage about 'lost' plaques, released in April 2024.\nThe house was demolished in 1937.

The LCC erected a bronze 'medallion style' plaque at No.36 in 1914 and for a time, before No.7 was demolished, the two plaques stood on opposite sides of the street, no doubt leading to some confusion. In the 20th century No.36 was used as a hotel, then as a base for several non-profit groups (and was for a time occupied by squatters), but was in dire condition at the end of the century when the freehold was granted to the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House by the UK government. Following structural reinforcement and restoration the house opened as The Benjamin Franklin House Museum on 17 January 2006, the 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth. The SOA plaque from the long-lost No.7, which had been for many years in the possession of the Museum of London, was presented to the museum and is on display in the basement corridor.\n| installed = 1869\n| removed = 1914\n| image = Lived Here.

The plaque was assumed to have been lost or destroyed at this time, until 2015 when remarkably it resurfaced to be sold at auction. Acquired by the Garrick Club, it has been put on display in the reception area of the club at 15 Garrick Street. The London plaque scheme later commemorated Garrick at Garrick's Villa, Hampton Court Road, the GLC erecting a standard blue roundel there in 1970.\n| installed = 1876\n| removed = 1936\n| image = David Garrick Actor.

The plaque is glimpsed in the English Heritage short film 'Orphan Plaques part 1' revealing it to be in store at Wrest Park as of April 2024. The plaque was presented to the Gordon Boys’ School by the GLC. Siedle House and Watling House, part of the Woolwich Common housing estate, now stand on the site.

After Islington council uncovered evidence of an earlier residence - unlike Calshot Street, one occupied by Grimaldi while he was still performing - English Heritage erected a new blue plaque at 56 Exmouth Market, Clerkenwell in 1989. In April 2024 the 1938 plaque was revealed as one of the items in English Heritage's Wrest Park archive, being shown - complete with the damage incurred during a difficult extraction from the wall of the house, a large part of which remains attached to the reverse - in their second short film about the 'orphan' plaques in their collection.\n| installed = 1958\n| removed = 1963\n| image = Lady Hamilton blue plaque at Sankey's 39 Mount Ephraim Tunbridge Wells.jpg\n| open_plaques = 31616\n}}\nThe plaque was removed when that building was demolished in 1961 and subsequently relocated to the first floor of 1 Milbank, at the time the offices of the Church Commissioners but today used by the House of Lords, for display. The building is not open to the general public.

The V&A Catalogue records that the plaque was donated to the now defunct British Theatre Museum, a part of the Victoria & Albert Museum, by the Greater London Council in December 1964. It is not currently on display, nor is it one of the objects available to view at the V&A East storehouse opened in 2025.

Part of the 1967 brutalist rebuild of the hotel now occupies the site. Maurice was commemorated by the London plaque scheme for a second time by the Greater London Council, a standard blue roundel being erected at 2 Brunswick Place, Marylebone in 1977. In April 2024 the 1907 plaque was revealed as one of the items in English Heritage's Wrest Park archive, being glimpsed in their second short film about the 'orphan' plaques in their collection. The plaque was removed from 309 Upper Richmond Road, East Sheen, SW15, prior to its demolition in 1999. The whereabouts of the plaque were unknown for a time though it was thought likely to be in the possession of English Heritage This was revealed to be the case in April 2024 when English Heritage released a short film about the plaques in their Wrest Park archive, in which the Oates plaque can be seen. All the houses in Whitehall Gardens were demolished in 1938 to make way for the construction of the new offices of the Board of Trade and Air Ministry. Peel was commemorated by the scheme again when a plaque recording his residence at 16 Upper Grosvenor Street, Mayfair (jointly with his father, Sir Robert Peel 1750-1830) was placed by English Heritage in 1988. In April 2024 the 1904 plaque was revealed as one of the items in English Heritage's Wrest Park archive, being shown in their short film about the 'orphan' plaques in their collection. The building at 48 Leicester Square, subsequently renamed Communications House, was extensively reconstructed and reconfigured in 2016, neither plaque being disturbed in the process. In April 2024 the 1869 plaque was revealed as one of the oldest items in English Heritage's Wrest Park archive, being shown in their short film about the 'orphan' plaques in their collection. When first erected, the plaque was affixed to a wooden mount similar to that of the earliest surviving plaque in the scheme, to Napoleon III in King Street, St. James's. It is embossed on the reverse with the makers name -  Minton & Co, Stoke upon Trent. The plaque was still listed as in-situ by the LCC in 1960. No.226 Baker Street was demolished in 1965, the plaque was rescued and given to the now defunct Theatre Museum (part of the Victoria and Albert Museum) by the LCC. The plaque remains in the possession of the V&A but is not currently on display, nor is it one of the objects available to view at the V&A East storehouse. The LCC would later - in June 1907 - erect its own memorial to Siddons at 54 Great Marlborough Street, the plaque believed lost when that house was demolished in 1958. Remarkably, the LCC's supplementary tablet from 1905 also survives - now in the possession of English Heritage - being glimpsed briefly in a short film about some of the 'orphaned' plaques in their Wrest Park archive, released in April 2024. The house was later used as the office of the National Association of Local Government Officers. Abingdon Street was bombed during the 1939-45 war and would remain derelict until the early 1960s. Telford's plaque was recovered by the LCC in 1959, and donated to the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) - appropriately, since it had been Telford who founded the institution in 1818, and was its first president. Since 1980, the plaque has been displayed in the reception area of the ICE at 1 Great George Street, being unveiled by HRH The Duke of Gloucester in September of that year. The remaining derelict houses in Abingdon Street were demolished in 1963-4 and a two-storey underground car park subsequently built on the cleared site. College Green public park was created on the roof of the car park.\n| installed = 1935\n| removed = 1959\n| image = THOMAS TELFORD (1757-1834) Engineer Lived here.jpg\n| open_plaques = 72706\n}}\nasking the public to help locate some of the plaques lost in the 150-plus year history of the official London scheme resulted in this memorial to J.M.W. Turner resurfacing in 2024. A curiosity, it is not (unlike the other 35 known plaques put up by the Society of Arts between 1867 and 1901) documented in the Journal of the Society and it seems it was never officially erected. It is believed to have been manufactured at the turn of the twentieth century (just as the SOA were, by mutual agreement, transferring their scheme to the London County Council) and intended for No. 26 Maiden Lane (on the north side). A house on this site until the 1870s was for many years believed to have been Turner's birthplace; it appears that some problem arose - perhaps with the building, perhaps with the Bedford Estate - that prevented the plaque from being fixed there. In April 1980 the plaque was the subject of an article by Al Weil in Turner Society News  which told how Mr Paul Fessler, then managing director of Displaywork Limited, recalled seeing it in the early 1950s in his father's firm's offices at 12/13 Henrietta Street (very close to Maiden Lane) and, how he rescued it from a pile of rubble when it was removed in 1974 during remodelling work. Hopes expressed in the article that the plaque would be affixed to a building never materialised but in 1999 the Turner Society collaborated with Westminster City Council to have one of their green plaques made and erected on the current building that is No. 21, on the site of Turner's birth house.  At some point the SOA plaque found its way into the Westminster Archives. It is not currently on display, but it is hoped that it can be passed on to an organisation - perhaps turnershouse.org - more suited both to conserve and show it.\n| installed = n/a\n| removed = n/a\n| image = JOSEPH M.

New Little Holland House, built in 1875-6, was designed for Watts by Frederick Pepys Cockerell with a gallery extension by George Aitchison added in 1878. The house was demolished in 1964 after failed attempts by the London County Council to place a building preservation order on it. In its place was built a block of flats named Kingfisher House, in 1965. In April 2024 the plaque was revealed as one of the items in English Heritage's Wrest Park archive, being discussed in their second short film about the 'orphan' plaques in their collection.\n| installed = 1977\n| removed = 1980\n| image = RICHARD DADD 1817-1886 Painter lived here.jpg\n| open_plaques = 331\n}}\n| installed = 1952\n| removed = 1962\n| image = William Ewart 1798-1869 reformer lived here.jpg\n| open_plaques = 298\n}}\n| installed = 1961\n| removed = 1965\n| image = CAPTAIN MATTHEW FLINDERS R.N. 1774-1814 EXPLORER AND NAVIGATOR lived here.jpg\n| open_plaques = 484\n}}\n| installed = 1912\n| removed = 1940s\n| image = LCC Plaque Charles James Fox 9 Arlington Road relocated 1950.png\n| open_plaques = 402\n}}\n| installed = 1963\n| removed = 1964\n| image = W.G.

The plaque was rehung by the hospital authorities in the hospital grounds and remained there until 1975 when these buildings were demolished to make way for the expanding Royal Free Hospital, which had opened in 1974. In 1978 the plaque was rehung again on the retaining wall of a car park in the hospital grounds. It was removed again when construction of the Royal Free's Pears Building on that site began in 2018 and rehung for a third time in a public garden space accessible via Rowland Hill Street on 24th February 2022.\n| installed = 1900\n| removed = 1) 19052) 1975 3) 2018\n| image = Sir Rowland Hill KCB Originator of the Penny Post lived here in 1849-1879 Born 1795 Died 1879.jpg\n| open_plaques = 685\n}}\nThe plaque was salvaged and rehung by English Heritage in 2019 at 23 Russell Square, the former headquarters of the British Dental Association and the site of the flat where Lindsay and her husband Robert moved after retiring from dental practice in 1920.\n| installed = 2013\n| removed = 2017\n| image = LILIAN LINDSAY 1871-1960 The First Woman Dentist to Qualify in Britain lived here.jpg\n| open_plaques = 30375\n}}\n| installed = 1953\n| removed = 1962\n| image = TOM MOORE 1779-1852 POET lived here.jpg\n| open_plaques = 9151\n}}\n| installed = 1985\n| removed = 1998\n| image = Mary Seacole 1805-1881 Jamaican nurse heroine of the Crimean War lived here.jpg\n| open_plaques = 604\n}}\n| installed = 1961\n| removed = 1964\n| image = W.

The house was demolished in 1959. In April 2024 the plaque was revealed as one of the items in English Heritage's Wrest Park archive and was discussed in their short film about the 'orphan' plaques in their collection. Recent research had unearthed a number of alternative residences for Tenniel  - one of them in Randolph Avenue - and serious consideration was being given to re-erecting this plaque at one of them This, remarkably, came to pass in November 2025; the restored plaque has re-joined the official London plaque scheme, being re-hung at Tenniel's former Fitz-George Avenue residence on 13 November 2025, sixty five years since it last saw the light of day.\n| installed = 1930\n| removed = 1959\n| image = SIR JOHN TENNIEL (1820–1914), Artist and Cartoonist, Lived here.jpg\n| open_plaques = 78599\n}}\n|}\nNon-scheme plaques\nThis section records plaques which have never formed part of the official London-wide plaque scheme but, bearing the name of one of the custodians of the scheme, are included for the sake of completeness.\nand Becontree was constructed between 1921 and 1935 to cottage estate principles in the parishes of Barking, Dagenham and Ilford, then in Essex. This commemorative plaque on the first house built was installed by the LCC at some point after WWII and before the council's abolition in 1965. As the location was not part of London at the time of its installation, the plaque was never intended to form part of the then-LCC administered official London Plaque scheme. Although boundary changes which occurred at the time of the formation of the Greater London Council in 1965 placed the estate in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, neither the GLC nor English Heritage have chosen to include the plaque in the official list. The plaque design, superficially reminiscent of the small number of other rectangular plaques erected by the LCC in the late 1940s-early 1950s, is uniquely formed of two glazed ceramic panels.\n| year =\n| image = Becontree Estate This block of houses was the first to be erected on this estate and was completed on 7th November 1921.jpg\n| open_plaques = 9800\n}}\nCanaletto never had a studio on this site; the location was an open field during his time in London, and there is no evidence that he had any other London address besides 41 Beak Street, Soho.
