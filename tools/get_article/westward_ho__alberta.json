It is located approximately 50 kilometers northwest of Calgary, just west of the intersections of Highway 22 and Highway 27 between Olds and Sundre. There is a general store with a gas bar also located here.\nAcross the highway is a 300 site campground also called Westward Ho with a hall, washrooms, baseball diamonds, beach, playgrounds and many private sites.\nMuch of Westward Ho (town/campground) is located on the Little Red Deer River.\nSee also\n*List of communities in Alberta"
