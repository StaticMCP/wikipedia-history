This is the first release Rob Halford recorded after his departure from Judas Priest in 1992. He brought with him drummer Scott Travis from the band and recruited three new members. The music is a mixture between the heavy metal sound created by Judas Priest and a groove/thrash metal sound similar to that of Pantera. Halford is also credited with playing guitar but only recorded vocals for the album. Music videos were made for \"Nailed to the Gun\", \"Immortal Sin\" and \"Little Crazy\".\nReception\n| rev2 = ''Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal\n| rev2score = 6/10\n| rev3 = Rock Hard\n| rev3score = 9/10\n}}\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer called War of Words \"a solid album of thrashing mosh-pit rock\".\nIn 2005, War of Words was ranked number 386 in Rock Hard'' magazine's book The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.\nTrack listing\n*\n| length12 = 13:18\n}}\nNote\n\"Reality, a New Beginning\" is a 4:40 song.
