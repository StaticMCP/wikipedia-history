The South Dakota primary was a closed primary, with the state awarding 22 delegates to the 2000 Republican National Convention, of whom all 22 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nTexas governor and presumptive nominee George W. Bush won the primary with roughly 79% of the vote and won 22 delegates, helping him solidify his presumptive nomination over John McCain, who had suspended his campaign three months earlier. McCain garnered 14% of the vote, while Alan Keyes received roughly 8%. Minor candidate James Attia received under 1% of the vote.\nProcedure\nSouth Dakota was one of five states that voted on June 6, 2000, in the Republican primaries, along with Alabama, Montana, New Jersey, and New Mexico.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 8&nbsp;a.m. until 8&nbsp;p.m. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 20% at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 22 pledged delegates to the 2000 Republican National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the primary results. Of these, 1 was allocated to the state's lone congressional district and another 6 were allocated on an at-large basis, in addition to 13 bonus delegates.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
