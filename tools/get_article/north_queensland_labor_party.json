The branch often held events that aimed to support the Russian war effort during World War II. The expelled branch established itself as a separate party. The NQLP held a majority within the Townsville council from 1943 to 1949, having formed a coalition with local Communist councillors such as Fred Paterson until 1946.\nAikens was elected for the Electoral district of Mundingburra in the 1944 Queensland state election and would serve in the state parliament for the next 33 years; in 1960 a redistribution turned his seat into the Electoral district of Townsville South. Although initially contesting a few other seats in northern Queensland the party only ever elected Aikens. He was defeated in the 1977 Queensland state election and the party subsequently folded.\nRather than maintaining a set platform, the party was noted for being \"merely a medium for Aikens’s political career\". Aikens himself was termed the \"perfect provincial populist\" for his shifting views.\nReferences"
