Thus, Carter compiled a series of tracks he had recorded, and announced that his second studio album would be released on February 2, 2011, in Japan. On the week of release, the album sold 9,928 copies, peaking at number 8, before dropping to number 17 the following week, selling 4,103 copies.

The album peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Chart.\nEurope became the next region to receive a release. \"Just One Kiss\" was released on April 29, before the album received a release on June 2.
