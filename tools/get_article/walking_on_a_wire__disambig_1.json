BBC Music and Pitchfork Media both echoed this sentiment, with Pitchfork Media remarking that it was \"the closest thing Thompson's got to the career-spanning greatest-hits album he deserves-- but if you're not already part of his cult, it's more a moat than a drawbridge.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
