He graduated from Canterbury School, New Milford, CT, in 1957 and from Amherst College in 1961. He was a Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford in 1970 and did a master's in private school administration at the University of San Francisco in 1978. He served in the Naval Air Reserve as a sonarman.\nCareer\nAfter brief stints as a bookseller, a history teacher, and a documentary filmmaker, in 1965, Junker began writing for The Nation, Esquire, and Harper’s Bazaar. In the late Sixties, he was a swing writer in the arts sections of Newsweek. He later wrote for Architectural Digest, Art in America, Artforum, Film Quarterly, The New Republic, New York, Playboy, Rolling Stone, The Village Voice, and Vogue.\nIn 1985, Junker founded the literary journal ZYZZYVA: The Last Word—West Coast Writers & Artists. In each issue he included some 30 images of works on paper in black & white and featured writers appearing in print for the first time, some 250 in all before he retired in 2010. He sold some 25 pages of ads, as a source of income and as a community bulletin board.\nKay Ryan appeared in the second issue, Sherman Alexie while he was still in graduate school. First times in fiction included: F.X. Toole, whose stories inspired Million Dollar Baby, Po Bronson, and Chitra Divakaruni. And Haruki Murakami’s first time in English. And Frances Mayes’ notebook that led to Under the Tuscan Sun. And all the West Coast poets who became U.S. Poets Laureate, from Robert Hass to Kay Ryan, Philip Levine, Juan Felipe Herrera, Joy Harjo, with the exception of W.S. Merwin. (Junker's successor as editor, Laura Cogan, published Ada Limón.)\nHe edited five anthologies of works published in ZYZZYVA, including AutoBioDiversity: True Stories (Heyday Books, Berkeley).\nHis 24-volume metamemoir, A Total Junker, includes the oral history, Lord Jeff & The Closet: The Gay Scene, such as it was, circa Amherst, circa 1960 (revised edition, 2023, Mighty Fool Press, Bozeman, MT).\nHis collaboration with artists Paul Kos and Isabelle Sorrell was recently on view at Anglim/Trimble in San Francisco.\nJunker lives in San Francisco with his wife, Rozanne Enerson Junker, author of Renatus’ Kayak.\nSelected bibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.howardjunker.com Howard Junker web site]\n* [http://www.zyzzyva.org/ ZYZZYVA web site]"
