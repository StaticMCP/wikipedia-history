It was primarily used for association football and later motorcycle speedway.\nHistory\nThe site was originally part of the Mokotów Airport from 1910 to 1947 before being developed for sport. From the 1950s, it contained a football and speedway stadium, training pitches, tennis courts and swimming facilities.\nIn 1955, it was handed over to the Gwardia Warsaw sports club, although the land remained in the ownership of the State Treasury.\nThe facility at Racławicka Street hosted important home fixtures for the Gwardia Warsaw football team, although the most significant ones such as the 1955–56 European Cup and 1957–58 European Cup were held at the Polish Army Stadium.\nIn 1971, the site came under management of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\nIn 1993, the 383m long athletics track was removed and in 2000, forty years after the last speedway in Warsaw the Gwardia Warsaw sports club introduced a speedway section and a team by the name of WSŻ Gwardia Warszawa entered the 2000 Polish speedway season in the Polish Speedway Second League, racing at the stadium. The 2002 season resulted in promotion to 1. Liga. but the 2003 1.Liga season was a disaster, WKM Warszawa ending the campaign bottom of the table with just four points and then disbanding.\nMusic concerts of world stars were also organised at the facility, including: Aerosmith (1994), Tina Turner (1996), Sting (1996 and 2001), Metallica (1999), Roger Waters (2002), Carlos Santana, Iron Maiden (2008) and Andrea Bocelli (2009).\nIn 2007, ownership of the site was taken over by the Police. In 2012, the stadium was closed due to its poor condition and since 2019, it has been owned by the Internal Security Agency.\nReferences"
