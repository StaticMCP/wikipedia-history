Mahadji Shinde's men attacked and surrounded the British at Wadgoan as they retreated from their exposed position. The British were forced to surrender and agreed a treaty in February 1779 before being allowed to return to Bombay.\nLegacy\nIn 2003, a group named 'Express Nagrik Vadgaon Vijaystambh Pratishthan' installed a victory pillar to commemorate the victory in the Battle of Wadgaon. The victory at the Battle of Wadgaon is still celebrated in the region every year.\nReferences"
