Conservative groups had accused Lee of being \"a pro-North Korea, anti-U.S. activist\". An anonymous National Human Rights Commission employee quoted by the Hankyoreh objected to the decision and described it as politically motivated.\n#Korean Broadcasting System\n#Judge Advocate General's Corps, Republic of Korea Army\n2009\nIn October 2009, forty-five human rights organisations which had been nominated for the Human Rights Award of Korea issued a statement that they would not participate in the selection process for that year due to concerns over the independence and political bias of newly appointed Human Rights Commission head Hyun Byung-chul. The following month saw broader strife in the HRC; sixty-one HRC advisors also threatened to resign in protest, calling Hyun \"nothing more than a 'yes man'\" for the Lee Myung-bak administration.\n#Yanghee Lee (former chairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the Child)\n#Network for North Korean Democracy and Human Rights\n#Ansan City\n2010\nThe year 2010 saw further boycotts of the Human Rights Award, including several by student writers who had participated in the essay competition. The Human Rights Commission announced on December 10 that the Incheon League for the Abolition of Discrimination against People with Disabilities (인천장애인차별철폐연대), an organisation which had been selected for the award, would not accept it. A spokesperson for the National League for the Abolition of Discrimination Against People with Disabilities stated that there continued to be concerns over the independence and operation of the Human Rights Committee.\n#Tae Wonwoo (Partner of Gyeomin and Member of Human Rights Committee of Korean Bar Association)\n#Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice\n2011\n#Ha Tae-keung (Member of National Assembly and President of Open Radio for North Korea)\n#Korea Association of Social Workers\n#Yeungnam University\n2012\n#Joung Won Oh (Professor and the President of Social Enterprise Research Institute of Sungkonghoe University)\n#Dream Start Center of Ministry of Health and Welfare\n#Human Asia\n2013\n#Peter Park (Former Youth Ombudsman of Korea and Election Commissioner in Melbourne, Overseas Election Commission of Korea)\n#Choi Byeongil, director of Anyang Korea Women's Hotline\n#Coalition for Human Rights of Abductees and North Korean Refugees\n2014\n#John Linton (Professor and the President of International Medical Center, Yonsei University)\n#Center for Military Human Rights, Korea\n#Dongcheon Foundation\n2015\n#Hyejung Oh (Sister, Sisters of Our Lady of Perpetual Help)\n#The Know Your Rights, Victoria, Australia\n2016\n#Eunjoo Lee (Secretary-General, School Equivalent Examinations Support Association)\n#Multicultural Family Service Center\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://humanrights.go.kr National Human Rights Commission of Korea]"
