Azemmour, strategically situated along the coast, attracted the attention of the kings of Fez and Mequinez, who sought to expand their dominion in the region.\nPreparation\nAnticipating the imminent threat, Portuguese leaders in Azemmour and Safim, including João de Meneses, Martim Afonso de Melo Coutinho, and Nuno Fernandes de Ataíde, coordinated their efforts to defend against the impending assault. They gathered their forces and sought support from local allies to bolster their defenses.\nThe Battle\nWhen the kings of Fez and Mequinez dispatched their alcaides with a substantial force of cavalry and infantry to lay siege to Azamor, the Portuguese and their allies launched a preemptive strike. Despite being outnumbered, they fought valiantly, engaging the enemy alcaides in fierce combat.\nAftermath\nThe Portuguese tightened their siege on Marrakesh and the kingdom of Fez. The 16 months that followed the battle of the Alcaides correspond to the period in which Portuguese expansion reached its peak in North Africa and territorial conquest was imminent. Decisive for the victory was the introduction of bodies of Ordenanças, which supported the traditional contingents of royal and seigneurial troops and \"peace moors\".\nSee also\n*Portuguese conquest of Tangier\n*Moroccan-Portuguese conflicts\n*Battle of Azemmour\n*Battle of Mamora (1515)\n*Battle of Tednest\nReferences"
