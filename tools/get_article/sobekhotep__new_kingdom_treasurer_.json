The latter title he was holding before being appointed to become a treasurer. Sobekhotep was the son of the treasurer Min and followed him most likely directly in his office. Sobekhotep is mainly known for his Theban tomb TT63. His wife Meryt was the nurse of the king's daughter Tiaa. Her father is not known for sure, she either was the daughter of the mayor of the Faiyum Kapus or the daughter of another Sobekhotep who was also  mayor of Shedet. His son was called Paser and was also mayor of Shedet. Otherwise, not much is known about him. He appears on a legal document that mentions also the Hathor temple at Gebelein and he is known from a statue.\n]]\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*Wolfram Grajetzki (2001).
