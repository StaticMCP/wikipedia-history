After military service with the Royal Army Service Corps on the Western Front during World War I, he studied at Lincoln College, Oxford, taking a degree in history.  He worked as a teacher and lecturer from 1920 to 1948, when he gave up the profession to concentrate on his work for the Urdd.\nIn 1922, Edwards wrote a letter to the periodical ''Cymru'r Plant, which led to the founding of the Urdd, and the first Urdd recreational camp was held at Llanuwchllyn in 1928, under his direction. The first Urdd local branch was founded in Treuddyn. It was gradually followed by more permanent camps and residential centres.  In partnership with J. Ellis Williams, he made the first Welsh language sound film, The Quarryman.  In 1947 he was knighted in recognition of his youth work, and the Urdd had his portrait painted by Alfred Janes in 1956.  He was a director of Television Wales and the West and encouraged the making of television programmes in Welsh.  His son, Owen Edwards, would become the first chief executive of S4C.\nWorks\n*A catalogue of Star Chamber proceedings relating to Wales (1929) (ed.)\n*Yr Urdd 1922-43 (1943)\n*Clych Atgof'' (1921) (edited version of his father's autobiography)\nSources"
