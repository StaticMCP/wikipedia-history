After Idaea falsely accused Phineus' sons by his first wife, she was sent back to Dardanus, where he condemned her to death.\nThe father of Phineus's wife Idaea, has sometimes been confused with, or considered to be the same as the Dardanus who was the son of Zeus and Electra, and ancestor of the Trojans.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Apollodorus, Apollodorus, The Library, with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes.
