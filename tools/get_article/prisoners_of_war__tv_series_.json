The first season aired on Israel's Channel 2 from March to May 2010, and the second season from October to December 2012. In 2013, Raff stated that a third season was planned, but in 2015 said that a third season did not look likely. In 2010, the series won the Israeli Academy Award for Television for Best Drama Series.\nThe programme was acquired by 20th Century Fox Television before it aired in Israel, and was adapted into the eight-season series Homeland for Showtime in the United States from 2011 to 2020. In India, it was adapted as the 110-episode television series P.O.W. - Bandi Yuddh Ke by Nikhil Advani in 2016 and 2017, with Raff consulting for the series. In Russia, it was adapted into the TV series Rodina in 2015.\nPlot\nThe series, set in 2008, depicts three Israeli soldiers who were captured 17 years previously while on a secret mission with their unit in Lebanon and two of them have returned from their captivity in Syria.\nSeason 1\nThe story begins with the soldiers' return home after years of negotiations for their freedom. Nimrod Klein and Uri Zach return alive, along with the remains of Amiel Ben-Horin.\nThe series explores the reintegration of Nimrod and Uri into a society which has made them national icons, and into an interrupted family life, while working through the trauma of having been held captive and tortured. They must deal with partners who waited or moved on, children who have grown up without them, and parents who have died.\nThey also have to undergo psychiatric evaluations and military debriefings. When a military psychiatrist finds discrepancies in their stories, an investigation is launched to discover what they are hiding.\nSeason 2\nAfter flashbacks to events at a school in Metula in 1990, and to the period shortly after Nimrod and Uri's release, the second season rejoins the story a few days after the events at the end of the first season.\nInitially disagreeing on what to do with their discovery that Amiel may still be alive, Nimrod and Uri take the information to Haim and Iris, who start to pursue their own (unofficial) investigation into what happened to Amiel—with unanticipated consequences.\nAlongside this, the series continues to follow Nimrod and Uri (and the soldiers' families) as they pick up the pieces of their lives post-release. It also depicts Amiel for the first time as a living character—rather than in the visions experienced by Amiel's younger sister, Yael—and follows his new life as Yusuf, a Muslim, in Syria.\nCast and characters\nSeason 1\n*  as Nimrod Klein, a prisoner of war, and a brave, witty and intelligent man.

First season episodes had a budget of $200,000 each.\nThe second season of Hatufim was filmed between May and October 2011. It was originally due to be broadcast in Israel from December 2011 but the premiere was put back to June 2012 and then October 2012 due to the state of the local advertising market.\nThough Gideon Raff had stated, in 2013, that he intended to write a third season of Hatufim, but in 2015 it was announced that the plans for season three had been frozen, with Raff stating that his ongoing work with other projects meant that \"There's no third season in sight\".\nReception\nAt the time of broadcast, the first season of Hatufim was Israel's highest-rated TV drama of all time. It also achieved critical acclaim and was awarded Best Drama Series of 2010 by the Israeli Academy of Film and Television. For their work on the show, Gideon Raff won Best Directing for a Drama Series, Ishai Golan won Best Actor in a Drama Series, and Yael Abecassis won Best Actress in a Drama Series.\nThe series was not without controversy. It was criticized by family members of soldiers held prisoner, including Miriam Groff, mother of one of the men released in the Jibril Agreement. She suggested that the series might encourage the kidnapping of soldiers.\nViewing figures for the second season of Hatufim were even higher than for the first, with an average audience share of 40% (rising to 47.9% for the final episode) making it the highest-rated drama in Israel in 2012. Online viewing reached 3 million.\nAt the 2013 Seoul International Drama Awards, Hatufim (season 2) was awarded the festival's Grand Prize, out of a total of 225 entries from 48 countries. Other series nominated included Homeland (season 2) and House (season 8).\nAt the 2013 Israeli Academy Television Awards, season 2 of Hatufim was nominated in 9 categories, including (for Drama Series) Best Series, Best Directing (Gideon Raff), Best Screenplay (Gideon Raff) and Best Actor (Assi Cohen).\nIn December 2009, three months before Hatufim premiered in Israel, it was reported that the rights to develop an American version of the series had been sold to 20th Century Fox Television. It was sold on the strength of the script alone, before the series had even begun shooting. The result was the series Homeland, developed in cooperation with Raff and broadcast on cable channel Showtime.\nFollowing on from the success of Hatufim in Israel, and the worldwide success of Homeland, Keshet has sold the original series (in Hebrew with subtitles) in a number of territories internationally, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, the United States and several European countries. The rights to produce local versions of the series have been sold in Russia (due to start filming in March 2014), Colombia and Mexico Turkey and South Korea. A version with dubbing of the Hebrew dialogue, but undertitles for the Arabic dialogue, has been produced for the German market and broadcast by ARTE.\nAuthor Stephen King included Hatufim (season 1) at number 8 in his top 10 TV shows of 2012.\nThe New York Times placed Hatufim (season 2) at number 2 in its top 12 TV shows of 2013, and in 2020 ranked it as the best show of the 2010s.\nEpisodes\nSeason 1 (2010)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #948B7A; color: #ffffff;\" | No.\n! style=\"background-color: #948B7A; color: #ffffff;\" | #\n! style=\"background-color: #948B7A; color: #ffffff;\" | Title\n! style=\"background: #948B7A; color: #ffffff;\" |Written & directed by\n! style=\"background-color: #948B7A; color: #ffffff;\" | Original air date\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\nThe Times of Israel|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/prisoners-still-the-ongoing-trauma-of-the-yom-kippur-war-pows/|access-date=10 October 2013|newspaper=The Times of Israel|date=25 September 2012}}\n|WrittenBy=Gideon Raff\n|OriginalAirDate=\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|}\nSeason 2 (2012)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #03B2DD; color: #ffffff;\" | No.\n! style=\"background-color: #03B2DD; color: #ffffff;\" | #\n! style=\"background-color: #03B2DD; color: #ffffff;\" | Title\n! style=\"background: #03B2DD; color: #ffffff;\" |Written & directed by\n! style=\"background-color: #03B2DD; color: #ffffff;\" | Original air date\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|ShortSummary =\n}}\n|}\nSongs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"1\"| Season\n!rowspan=\"1\"| Episode\n!rowspan=\"1\"| Song title\n!rowspan=\"1\"| Written by\n!colspan=\"1\"| Performed by\n!rowspan=\"1\"| Album (year)\n!rowspan=\"1\"| When featured in episode\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 1\n| 210\n| \"I Have Come Home\"()\n| Dana Berger &\n| Dana Berger & Itay Pearl\n| I Have Come Home (2010)\n| Episode 2 – at the start, during Nimrod's early morning run.Episode 10 – during the end credits.(Although the song was released in 2010, it was not written specifically for the series.)\n|-\n| 5\n| \"Keep Your Soul – The Guard Song\"()\n| Nathan Alterman & Sasha Argov\n| Chava Alberstein\n| Let It Be ()(1973)\n| After Amiel's funeral, while Yael's dogs are being walked.\n|-\n| 10\n| \"In A Dream\"()\n| Jaroslav Jakubovic & Michal Vered\n| Anat Atzmon\n| In A Dream (1989)\n| At the start, when Uri is listening to old cassette tapes, and later, in Nurit's kitchen.\n|-\n!rowspan=\"4\"| 2\n| 1\n| \"Goodbye, Sweetie\"()\n|  &\n| Nurit Galron\n| Goodbye, Sweetie (2000)\n| At the end, during the Nurit Galron concert.\n|-\n| 6\n| \"Shores (Are Sometimes)\"()\n| Natan Yonatan & Nachum Heiman\n|\n|\n| Hummed/sung by Abdullah at the end of prayers and while carrying out surveillance, and later by Yusuf (Amiel) in his bathroom.\n|-\n| 12\n| \"The Heart\"()\n|  & Svika Pick\n|\n|\n| \"Ivy\" quotes lyrics from the song (\"it's an autumn night and there are no stars\") while on the radio to \"Bird\".\n|-\n| 14\n| \"The Song of the Land\"()\n| Joshua Sobol & Yoni Rechter\n| Nurit Galron\n| A Gentle Touch ()(1984)\n| Towards the end, on the radio in Yael's living room.\n|}\nBroadcast\nHatufim in its original format (in Hebrew with subtitles) has been sold internationally for broadcast on network and pay television, for download via VOD, and for DVD release.\nSeason 1\nThe first season (10 episodes) aired on Channel 2 in Israel from 6 March to 22 May 2010.\nIn the UK it was shown on Sky Arts from 10 May to 12 July 2012.
