Its formation was announced on 31 March 2017. According to the group, their goals were to defend the social revolution in Rojava in northern Syria, and to spread anarchism. The group announced its dissolution on 24 September 2018, citing a change in \"perspective on strategy of armed struggle\".\nThe IRPGF had been part of the International Freedom Battalion since April 2017. Turkish media have described them as a terrorist organization and part of the network of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party.\nAffiliation\nThe group was a part of the International Freedom Battalion since April 2017, and they are the second anarchist group to join after the Greek unit RUIS. They participate frequently in the campaign activities of the brigade in social networks.\nOn 29 May, the IRPGF issued a statement in tribute to the commander of the United Freedom Forces Mehmet Kurnaz (Ulaş Bayraktaroglu), who was killed in combat on the Raqqa Front while fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. They define him as a true friend of IRPGF. On the 31st of the same month, the IRPGF sent representatives and speakers to the City of Derek (Canton of Cizîrê) at the funeral ceremony to four martyrs of the International Freedom Battalion and the People's Protection Units, Mehmet Kurnaz (Ulaş Bayraktaroglu) commander of the United Freedom Forces, Muzaffer Kandemir (fighter) of the United Freedom Forces, Elî Mihemed Mizil (Şêr Zagros) and Nimet Tûrûg (Baran Cudi) of the People's Protection Units.\nArmed struggle and involvement in the Syrian Civil War\nTheir public presence was confirmed at multiple martyr ceremonies in Rojava over 2017. Having fought along with the three most recent martyrs of the International Freedom Battalion, they were present at the funeral ceremonies for DKP leader and United Freedom Forces (BÖG) commander Ulaş Bayraktaroğlu, Tufan Eroğluer (Hasan Ali) from BÖG and Ayşe Deniz Karacagil (Destan Temmuz) from MLKP.\nThe Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army\nThe Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army (TQILA), a queer anarchist subunit of the IRPGF, formed in July 2017, as a group of foreign militia who came to fight alongside the Kurdish People's Defense Units (YPG). Its formation went viral on social media and was widely reported and celebrated in the Western press.\nCriticism\nAn August 2017 Al Jazeera English report by Syrian-Palestinian blogger Razan Ghazzawi cited two queer Syrian activists, who alleged the IRPGF had a lack of accountability, that its ally the Democratic Union Party had not acted against LGBTQ discrimination, and that its anarchist ideology was opposed to peace and stability. Ghazzawi argued the group contributed to a war on terror narrative that enabled the Assad regime.\nGallery\nTQILA Raqqa 2.png|TQILA in Raqqa\nIRPGF in Raqqa city 1.png|An IRPGF fighter during the Battle of Raqqa in 2017\nIFB members at Destan Temmuz burial in Kobanê.jpg|Fighters from the IRPGF and IFB at the burial of Destan Temmuz, an MLKP fighter.\nNi Una Menos from Raqqa.png|Solidarity with Ni una menos.\nFighters of the International Freedom Battalion.jpg|IFB and IRPGF members posing with their flags\nIRPGF fighters in Tabqa 5.jpg| An IRPGF fighter during the Battle of Tabqa\nIRPGF fighters in Tabqa 4.jpg| IRPGF fighters resting during the Battle of Tabqa\nIRPGF fighters in Tabqa 2.jpg| A column of IRPGF fighters during the Battle of Tabqa\nIRPGF fighters in Tabqa 3.jpg| IRPGF fighters crossing Lake Assad by boat\nIRPGF fighters in Tabqa 1.jpg| An IRPGF fighter firing at enemy positions in Tabqa\n(Heval) Black October - IRPGF.png|A member of the IRPGF\nIRPGF flag.jpg|IRPGF fighters displaying the group's flag\nSee also\n*Anarchism in Syria\n*International Brigades\n*List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War\n*People's Protection Units\n*Peoples' United Revolutionary Movement\n*List of anarchist organizations\n*List of guerrilla movements\n*List of active rebel groups\n*List of armed groups in the Iraqi Civil War\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://rupturacolectiva.com/nace-la-guerrilla-anarquista-irpgf-en-rojava-para-luchar-por-la-revolucion-en-kurdistan-y-mundo/ Nace la guerrilla anarquista “IRPGF” en Rojava para luchar por la revolución en Kurdistán y el mundo – Ruptura Colectiva]\n*[https://twitter.com/IRPGF IRPGF on Twitter]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/IRPGFRojava IRPGF on Facebook]\n*[https://archive.org/details/@irpgf iRPGF on archive.org]"
