The memorial can be reached by taking a footpath opposite the entrance to Montgomery Castle Car Park. The trail continues uphill along a dirt track, eventually leading to a level grassland where the monument can be seen in the distance.\nThe Memorial's initial inscription reads in English: \"To the glorious memory of the brave men of Montgomeryshire who fell in the great war 1914–1919\", with a Welsh translation on another side. Supplemental inscriptions to those who 'gave their lives' in the Second World War were added later.\nIt is a listed building.\nReferences"
