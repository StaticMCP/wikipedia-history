The uprising spread from Vesilahti to Lempäälä and was led by David of Ania''', also called Crazy David of Upper Satakunta, a peasant leader who mobilized resistance in response to increasing tax burdens.\nBackground\nDavid was a wealthy householder of the Heikkilä estate from Ania village in Vesilahti to Ruovesi. He along with other people who were of the peasantry, had become frustrated with the increased tightening of taxation. The anger of the peasantry was only increased by the weakening of the fur trade and the increased land grabbing by the nobility in Finland of important lands such as fishing waters and economically important lands owned or controlled by the peasantry. This anger was often directed at wealthy nobility and tax officials, such as , who was the Chief of Turku Castle. It is also thought by some that David was involved as a political agent who was paid to stir up trouble by Karl Knutsson Bonde.\nRebellion\nThe rebellion began in autumn 1438, and the rebellion's leader was chosen to be David, who was proclaimed the \"peasant king\" (bondekonung) by his fellow rebels. He and his rebels went on to Viikki Manor (located in present-day Nokia) and killed four soldiers (huovi) in service of Jöns Turensson (Odygd), a member of the Folkunga family. The rebels went on to loot other manors in Pirkkala. Along with the rebellion in Upper Satakunta, there was another rebellion in Lammi in anger towards Olav Tavast, who is reported to have thought that David's rebellion was a joke, which is why they reportedly also revolted.\nThe peasant revolt was tamed by Maunu II Tavast, who was the Bishop of Turku and by Hans Kröpelin by inviting the rebels to discuss tax reductions at Lempäälä. Ultimately the peasant rebels were given a lenient punishment of having some of their land such as meadows, handed over to the Folkunga family manor for their misdeeds, and the peasants were pardoned and they were forced to promise to never rise up against the Swedish Crown again, on 9 January. The rebels signed the following document in the Parish of Lempäälä, which was drawn up by Magnus II Tavast:\nDavid and his brethren were forced to flee to Tallinn to avoid a harsh punishment, however David's family was allowed to keep their farm in Ania.\nSee also\n* Cudgel War\nReferences"
