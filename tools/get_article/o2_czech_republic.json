It is now operating more than six million lines, both fixed and mobile, making it one of the Czech Republic's largest providers of fully converged services. O2 Czech Republic operates a fixed and mobile network including a 3rd generation network, CDMA (for data), UMTS and EDGE, enabling voice, data and video transmission. O2 Czech Republic is also a provider of ICT services.\nPreviously two companies, fixed-line operator Český Telecom and mobile operator Eurotel, it was acquired by the Spanish company  in 2005 and merged into a single legal entity and given its present name on 1 July 2006.\nIn 2013 it was announced that  would sell its stake in the company to PPF and the company would continue to use the O2 brand for a maximum of four years.  In August 2017 the brand license agreement was extended to 2022, with a 5 year extension to 2027 available.\nHistory\nThe company was initially known as SPT Telecom  (Správa pošt a telekomunikací, state-owned telecommunications company), and used to have a monopoly for providing fixed-line services. It was reorganized and renamed Český Telecom (Czech Telecom), after the Velvet Divorce saw Czechoslovakia separate into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993.\nIts mobile subsidiary, Eurotel, was founded in 1990 as a joint venture between SPT (51%) and the American joint-venture Atlantic West (between US WEST International, Inc. and Bell Atlantic International Inc.). On launch, it received an exclusive five-year licence to operate a public data network, and a 20-year licence for the 450&nbsp;MHz band to operate an analogue NMT mobile phone network, and automatically also a right to buy a licence to the future GSM network.\nIn 2001, it won a license to the third-generation UMTS network. It paid 1 billion korunas immediately and promised to pay an additional 2.5 billion korunas annually. It also agreed to launch the service commercially, at least in Prague, by 1 January 2005. In 2003, it received a one-year extension in exchange for faster payments. In 2005 it was granted another year-long extension due to the granting of a third licence to Vodafone. In the event, UMTS services launched on 1 November 2005. On 1 May 2006, the company launched HSDPA services on top of UMTS services.\nmodem for O2's CDMA network with manuals]]\nIn 2004 it launched CDMA/1xEV-DO broadband wireless service (data-only) at 450&nbsp;MHz, leveraging its legacy NMT network.\nIn 2012, O2 Czech Republic opened its network to virtual operators.\nOn 1 June 2015, O2 Czech Republic has been separated into two mutually independent companies. O2 is the retail operator with the infrastructure provided by CETIN. The separation includes commercial and managerial leadership and management of both companies, including security, IT and control systems.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|Type of service\n! colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\"|Number of customers (in thousands) at the end of the year\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center\"|2018\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center\"|2017\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center\"|2010\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: center\"|2009\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Fixed lines\n| 554 || 654 || 1,669 || 1,771\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|ADSL\n| 708 || 752 || 806 || 725\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Pay TV – O2 TV\n| 287 || 259 || 129 || 138\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Active mobile users in the Czech Republic\n| 4,992 || 4,903 || 4,839 || 4,945\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| – postpaid\n| 3,504 || 3,366 || 2,864 || 2,814\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| – prepaid\n| 1,488 || 1,537 || 1,975 || 2,130\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Active mobile users in Slovakia\n| 2,000  || 1,903 || 880 || 553\n|}\nControversial business conduct\nThe controversial business conduct of O2 Czech Republic with its retail and business customers, including anti-competitive practices and other questionable activities, has led to concerns due to its aggressive tactics, resulting in several legal disputes. Among those are:\n* In March 2015, Vodafone Czech Republic sued O2 Czech Republic for abusing its dominant position in the fixed high-speed internet market by charging excessively high wholesale prices, which hindered competition, innovation, and customer choice. The lawsuit sought CZK 385 million in damages for 2011-2014.\n* In July 2016, O2 changed its mobile data tariffs, ending slowed internet after data limits without informing customers about their right to terminate contracts. dTest sued O2 for this violation, seeking to revert the changes and protect consumer rights.\n* In December 2016, the Czech Office for the Protection of Competition fined O2 Czech Republic and Vodafone 99 million CZK for anti-competitive agreements.\n* In July 2019, EU antitrust regulators accused mobile operators Czech Republic and T-Mobile CZ of violating EU antitrust rules through a network sharing agreement. This agreement allegedly restricted competition and innovation, potentially harming consumers, especially in densely populated areas.\nSee also\n*List of mobile network operators in Europe\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
