The war took place on June 5–10, 1967.\nIsraeli Defence Forces\nOn full mobilisation, the Israeli Army comprised some 250,000 men of whom almost three-quarters were reservists and one-quarter conscripts. Out of its 25 brigades, nine were armoured, two were fully mechanised, and ten were infantry, some partly mechanised, as well as their paratroop brigades which also acted as elite assault troops. The brigades were assigned to six ugdas, or division-size task forces, whose composition varied according to their assigned mission and geographical area.\nMinister of Defense – General Moshe Dayan\nChief of Staff – Lieutenant General Yitzhak Rabin\nNorthern Command\nBrigadier General David Elazar\n: 1st Golani Infantry Brigade – Colonel Yonah Efrat\n:2nd Infantry Brigade\n:3rd Infantry Brigade\n:37th Armoured Brigade\n:45th Armoured Brigade\nReinforcements:\n: 8th Armoured Brigade – Colonel Avraham Mandler (from Southern Command)\n: 55th Paratroop Brigade – Colonel Mordechai Gur (from June 7 onward)\nCentral Command\nBrigadier General Uzi Narkiss\n:4th Reserve Infantry Brigade\n:5th Reserve Infantry Brigade\n: 16th Etzioni Jerusalem Infantry Brigade\n:Ugda Peled (from Northern Command)\n::9th Reserve Infantry Brigade (Central Command)\n::37th Armoured Brigade\n::45th Armoured Brigade\nAttached:\n: 10th Harel Mechanised Brigade (from GHQ Reserve) – Colonel Uri Ben-Ari\n: 55th Paratroop Brigade – Colonel Mordechai Gur (from Southern Command)\nSouthern Command\nBrigadier General Yeshayahu Gavish\n:84th Armoured Division – Brigadier General Israel Tal\n:: 7th Armoured Brigade – Colonel Shmuel Gonen\n::60th Armoured Brigade – Colonel Menachem Aviram\n::202nd Paratroop Brigade – Colonel Rafael Eitan\n::Recce Task Force – Colonel Uri Baron\n::Granit Task Force – Lieutenant Colonel Yisrael Granit\n::46th Tank Battalion – Lieutenant Uri Baron\n::215th Artillery Regiment\n:31st Armoured Division – Brigadier General Avraham Yoffe\n::200th Armoured Brigade – Colonel Yissacher Shadmi\n::520th Armoured Brigade – Colonel Elhanan Sela\n:38th Armoured Division – Brigadier General Ariel Sharon\n::14th Armoured Brigade – Colonel Mordechai Zippori\n::99th Infantry Brigade – Colonel Yekutiel Adam\n::80th Paratroop Brigade – Colonel Dani Matt\n::214th Artillery Regiment\n::226th Tank Batalion\n: 35th Paratroop Brigade – Colonel Aharon Davidi\n:40th Artillery Battalion\n:11th Infantry Brigade – Colonel Yehuda Reshef\nSyrian Army\nThe Syrian Army numbered 63,000.
