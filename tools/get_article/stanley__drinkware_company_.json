Stanley was established in 1915. Stanley is a very popular beverage container among Generation Z.\nThe Stanley brand has since been produced by several companies and is owned by Pacific Market International (PMI), a subsidiary of the The HAVI Group LP. Stanley is known for its steel thermos flasks, and since 2020, for its Stanley Quencher line of tumblers, also known as Stanley cups.\nHistory\nOrigins and the Stanley thermos (1913–1965)\nOn September 2, 1913, William Stanley Jr. patented the all-steel vacuum flask. The idea came about as a result of his work with transformers, during which he discovered that a welding process he was using could be used to insulate a vacuum bottle with steel instead of glass.\nStanley's new bottle was announced in The Berkshire Courier on July 8, 1915. Soon after, he established the Stanley Insulating Company in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and began mass production of the bottle under the Ferrostat, and later Supervac, labels. He acquired financial backing for the company from his friend William H. Walker, who served as its president, while Stanley served as vice president. Walker would eventually take control of the entire company.\nIn 1916, William Stanley died at the age of 57. Walker died soon after in 1917.\nIn 1921, the company was acquired by Landers, Frary & Clark of New Britain, Connecticut who manufactured Stanley's insulated bottles under its Universal trade name. The company continued to manufacture out of Great Barrington until 1933 when Landers, Frary & Clark consolidated operations with its New Britain factory.\nThe Stanley thermos became known for its durability. It was the only all-steel thermos in production until the mid-1960s. The United States army reportedly tested Stanley thermoses in World War I by dropping them out of airplanes and running them over with heavy equipment. Stanley thermos flasks were carried by bomber pilots during World War II.\nAcquisitions and shift overseas (1965–2020)\nA Stanley shop at the SM North EDSA shopping mall, Quezon City, Philippines, 2025\nIn 1965, the Stanley line was acquired by Aladdin Industries of Nashville, Tennessee. In 1988, Aladdin outsourced the plastic molding assembly of Stanley thermoses to Brazil.\nIn 2002, the Seattle-based Pacific Market International (PMI) acquired the Stanley and Aladdin retail and branding rights. They expanded the brand to include other non-insulated products including barware and flasks. PMI began manufacturing Stanley products in China.\nStanley introduced the Adventure Quencher tumbler in 2016. The Quencher's early sales were not substantial, and the company stopped restocking and marketing it in 2019. After working with the Buy Guide, a women-run blog based in Utah, to sell 5,000 Quenchers, the company resumed production in an increasingly broad array of colors. The product was the primary driver of Stanley's annual sales increasing from $70 million in 2019 to an estimated $750 million in 2023. Since successful influencer marketing campaigns for the Quencher, Stanley has shifted its marketing to sell primarily to women.\nRebranding and the \"Stanley cup\" (2020–present)\nIn 2020, the company hired Terence Reilly, formerly of Crocs, as its president; sales of Quenchers rose 275% between 2020 and 2021. In November 2024, Stanley announced its multi-year partnership with footballer Lionel Messi marking the brand's first collaboration with a professional athlete. The partnership brought multiple new products including The Quencher ProTour Flip Straw Tumbler, High Precision Flow Mate System, Classic Mate Mug and Mate Bombilla.\nProduction\nStanley products are primarily manufactured in China, but also Brazil. When Stanley was owned and produced by Aladdin Industries, most production was based in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2002, Pacific Market International (PMI) acquired the Stanley and Aladdin brands and production was moved to China.\nSafety\nLead content\nIn January 2024, dozens of customers reported the presence of lead in their Stanley products after using at-home lead detection tests, leading to concerns about whether or not Stanley products were safe for use, particularly with children.\nIn a statement responding to these concerns, Stanley acknowledged that lead is used in the manufacturing process deep inside of the product; however, \"once sealed, this area is covered with a durable stainless steel layer, making it inaccessible to consumers\" adding that its product \"meet all US regulatory requirements.\"\nFrom February 2024 onwards, a series of class action lawsuits were directed at PMI (the maker of the Stanley cups) in state and federal courts, by customers who say there was no warning that the vacuum insulation of the products is made with lead.\nStanley has described the use of lead to seal the vacuum insulation in their products as \"industry standard\"; however, a number of rival brands, including Owala, Klean Kanteen, Hydro Flask and Sigg have been reported as not using lead in the manufacture of their drinkware.\nBurn injuries and product recall\nIn December 2024, Stanley initiated a product recall of 2.4 million cups after Stanley received 91 reports worldwide, including 16 in the US, of the travel mugs' lids detaching during use, resulting in 38 burn injuries worldwide, including two burn injuries in the US with 11 consumers worldwide requiring medical attention.\nTrademark infringement\nIn February 2025, the American industrial tools and hardware manufacturer Stanley Black and Decker filed a lawsuit against PMI, the maker of Stanley cups. The lawsuit said that Stanley Black and Decker signed a contract in 1966 with Aladdin Industries who were the previous owners of Stanley cups, limiting the use of the \"Stanley\" name to \"insulated containers adapted to keep their contents hot or cold.\"\nAfter PMI became the owners in 2002, the lawsuit said that a further agreement was signed in 2012 following PMI's \"repeated non-compliance\" with the 1966 contract that required the cup maker to include its full corporate name along with the \"Stanley\" name and forbid the use of \"Stanley\" as a \"company name, division or proper noun.\"\nThe lawsuit claims that PMI has violated the agreement by using \"Stanley\" as a standalone name on products by not using the company name PMI on the products, while rebranding the company as Stanley 1913 on products and in advertising. The lawsuit claims that Stanley Black & Decker has suffered reputational harm from \"several waves of negative press\" about alleged risks of lead poisoning, burn injuries and major product recalls from the sale and use of Stanley cups.\nCriticism\nAlthough reusable water bottles have been praised as a sustainable alternative to single-use plastic bottles, the trend of collecting and showing off collections of Quencher tumblers has raised concerns about whether they are better for the environment when they are used infrequently or collected.\nProducts\nQuencher\ndisplay for Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumbler, March 2024]]\nReleased in 2016, the Stanley Quencher (sometimes Stanley cup) became popular as a result of influencer marketing campaigns on social media, particularly TikTok. The sales started picking up in 2019. In 2020, Terence Reilly joined Stanley as its new president. Reilly engaged with Ashlee LeSueur, co-founder of Buy Guide, who had discovered the Quencher in 2017 at a Bed Bath & Beyond store. Impressed by the product, she became a supporter, giving it to friends and recommending it to her followers, which resulted in increased interest. As a result the company decided to continue production and released the quencher in more colors. In 2020, the Quencher became the brand's top-selling product, a position it has retained ever since. It is Stanley's most popular item among female customers. It has increased Stanley's annual sales from $70 million in 2019 to $750 million in 2023.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://patents.google.com/patent/US1071817A/en Patent referencing William Stanley's Bottle Patent]"
