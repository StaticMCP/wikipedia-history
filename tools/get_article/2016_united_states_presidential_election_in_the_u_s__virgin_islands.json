However, the five non-incorporated territories that send Delegates to the House of Representatives did participate in the presidential primaries.\nIn presidential caucuses, Virgin Islands voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic and Republican parties' respective nominees for president. Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated chose any one primary in which to vote.\nCaucuses\nRepublican caucuses\nThe Republican convention took place on March 10, 2016.\nSix of Virgin Islands' nine Republican delegates were elected during a presidential caucus. Territorial Caucuses met from noon to 6 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time on St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John as a Convention to vote for Presidential Preference and select at-large delegates to the Republican National Convention.\nThree party leaders—the National Committeeman, the National Committeewoman, and the chairman of the Virgin Islands's Republican Party—attended the convention by virtue of their position. On election day all six delegates were voted to be uncommitted to the national convention in Ohio. This means that they will decide who to support at the convention.\nAll 6 delegates were disqualified by the territorial party and were replaced.  Rubio received 2 delegates, 2 delegates were uncommitted, Ted Cruz received 1, and Donald Trump received 1.  This decision is being contested.\nDemocratic caucuses\nSeven of Virgin Islands' 12 Democratic delegates are pledged to presidential contenders based on the results of the voting in the Virgin Islands Territorial Convention. A mandatory 15 percent threshold is required in order for a presidential contender to be pledged National Convention delegates.\nThe At-Large delegates are to be pledged proportionally to presidential contenders based on the Caucus results on each of the three islands: four from St Thomas and St. John jointly, and three from St. Croix.\nThe Democratic Caucus took place on June 4, 2016.\nSee also\n* Democratic Party presidential debates, 2016\n* Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\n* Republican Party presidential debates, 2016\n* Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gop.com/the-official-guide-to-the-2016-republican-nominating-process/ RNC 2016 Republican Nominating Process]\n* [http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/ Green papers for 2016 primaries, caucuses, and conventions]"
