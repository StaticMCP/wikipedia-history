A youth group briefly occupied the Carnegie Library building before its use by the Codington County Historical Society.\nCodington County Historical Society\nThe museum is maintained by the Codington County Historical Society. The group was founded in 1970 and was officially incorporated in 1974. They put out a bi-monthly publication for paid members entitled the Codington County Courier. In the past, the publication was called Wagon Wheels.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Codington County, South Dakota\nExternal links\n* [http://www.cchsmuseum.org/ Official website]\nReferences"
