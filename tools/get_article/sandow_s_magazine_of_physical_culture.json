It was also known as Sandow's magazine of physical culture and British sport''. It closed, due to a decline in interest, in June 1907.\nHoward Spicer was editor. Contributors included the music-hall artist Dan Leno, and several young writers who would subsequently achieve fame: P. G. Wodehouse, H. H. Munro and George Douglas Brown.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://wellcomecollection.org/works/cpfwhryk Holdings list of the Wellcome Collection.]\n* [https://www.madameulalie.org/sandow/SandowMenu.html Brief selection of articles published online.]"
