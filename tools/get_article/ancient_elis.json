It was bounded to the northeast by Achaea, east by Arcadia, south by Messenia, and west by the Ionian Sea. The region is a fertile lowland with extensive plains, watered by the Peneus, Alpheus and other rivers that flow down from the Arcadian highlands. The region's name is probably cognate with the English 'valley'.\nThe Eleans traced their roots back to the mythical Dorian invasion. They united into a single  polis (\"city-state\") centred on the city of Elis in 471 BC. Over the course of the archaic and classical periods, the city gradually gained control of much of the region of Elis, most probably through unequal treaties with other cities; many inhabitants of Elis were Perioeci—autonomous free non-citizens. Elis' main claim to fame was its control over the sanctuary at Olympia and the Olympic games.\nHistory\nEarly history\nThe region was probably not the site of a kingdom during the Mycenean period. According to myth, the original inhabitants of Elis were called Caucones and Paroreatae. The people of the region are mentioned by Homer for the first time in Greek history under the title of Epeians (Epeii), as setting out for the Trojan War, and they are described by him as living in a state of constant hostility with their neighbours the Pylians. In the mythical Dorian invasion of the Peloponnese, Elis was assigned to Oxylus and the Aetolians. The dialect spoken in Elis in historical times was Dorian, which might indicate that there had been an influx of people from northwestern Greece. These people, amalgamating with the Epeians, formed a powerful kingdom in the north of Elis. Three independent groups developed in the region: the Epeians, Minyae and Eleans.\nBefore the end of the 8th century BC, the Eleans had vanquished the Minyans and Epeians. Over the archaic period, they expanded their control of the region through conquest and treaties, reducing many of the surrounding communities to perioeci (non-citizen dependent communities). The Eleans enjoyed the support of Sparta in this process. The sanctuary of Olympia and the Olympic games, which were re-established in 776 BC, were initially controlled by the city of Pisa, but Elis contested this. They gained control of the sanctuary and games around 576 BC and destroyed the city of Pisa in 572 BC.\nClassical period\nAs an ally of Sparta, Elis joined the Peloponnesian League in the 6th century BC. Elis ostensibly supported the Greek side in the Persian Wars, but played no notable role in the conflict. In 472 BC, the literary sources report a revolution at Elis which established a democracy modelled on the Athenian one. This also entailed a synoecism, in which the various communities within the Elean orbit merged into a single political unit, with a capital city at Elis, located on the river Peneus, where it enters the lowland plain. Elis annexed most of Triphylia in the mid-fifth century BC, except for Lepreum in the south. Sometime afterwards, Lepreum was conquered as well.\nWhen the Peloponesian War broke out between Athens and Sparta in 431 BC, Elis sided at first with Sparta. But the city state joined Argos and Athens in an alliance against Sparta in 421 BC due to Spartan support for the independence of Lepreum. The Eleans banned the Spartans from participating in the Olympic Games of 420 BC and defeated them in battle when they tried to participate anyway. The Eleans did not participate in the Battle of Mantinea in 418 BC, at which the Spartans definitively defeated the alliance. After the Peloponnesian War, Elis and Lepreum fought against Sparta in the Spartan-Elean War (402-400 BC), but they were defeated. As a result, in 399 BC, the Spartans forced the Eleans to rejoin the Peloponnesian League and made them give up Triphylia and the peroecic communities in Acroreia.\nThe Eleans attempted to re-establish their authority over these places after Thebes ended the Spartan hegemony at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC. They successfully retook the old peroecic communities in the north, but the newly established Arcadian League came to the assistance of the Triphylians in the south. After an oligarchic revolution in 365 BC, the Eleans launched a war with the Arcadians for the territory, which lasted until 363 BC. In the course of the war, the city of Elis was very nearly sacked by the Arcadians and the Eleans were forced to give up control of Olympia, but the Spartans came to their rescue and forced the Arcadians to withdraw. The territory of Triphylia was ceded to Arcadia.\nDemocracy in Elis\nEric W. Robinson has argued that Elis was a democracy by around 500 BC, on the basis of early inscriptions which suggest that the people (the dāmos) could make and change laws. The literary sources refer to a democratic revolution in 472 BC. The literary sources imply that Elis continued to be democratic until 365, when an oligarchic faction took control. At some point in the mid-fourth century, democracy may have been restored; at least, we hear that a particularly narrow oligarchy was replaced by a new constitution designed by Phormio of Elis, a student of Plato. The classical democracy at Elis seems to have functioned mainly through a popular Assembly and a Council, the two main institutions of most poleis. The Council initially had 500 members, but grew to 600 members by the end of the fifth century. There was also a range of public officials such as the demiourgoi who regularly submitted to public audits.\nHellenistic period\nDuring the Macedonian supremacy in Greece they sided with the victors, but refused to fight against their countrymen. After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC they renounced the Macedonian alliance. At a time when most of their Peloponnesian neighbours were joining together as part of the Achaian League, the Eleans chose to join the rival Aetolian League. In 245 BC, Elis and the Aetolians conquered Triphylia and Lasion, but they lost the territory again in 219 BC when they entered the Social War on the Aetolian side and were invaded by Philip V of Macedon. In 191 BC, Elis was forced to join the Achaian League and it remained a member until the league was disbanded by the Romans in 146 BC at the end of the Achaean War.\nAccording to Polybius, Elis had an unusual agricultural economy for the Peloponnese in this period, which was characterised by large estates. These estates had large numbers of slave labourers and were particularly focussed on animal husbandry. The owners of these estates spent most of their time in residence and rarely visited the city of Elis, as a result of which the Eleans instituted a system of travelling judges to ensure these people had access to justice.\nRoman empire\nElis was freed in 146 BC, following the Roman abolition of the Achaian League. The victorious Roman general Lucius Mummius made gifts to the Eleans at Olympia, but the territory was pillaged by Sulla in the 80s BC, and struggled during the Roman Republican civil wars.\nThe Olympic games declined in popularity in the first century BC, due to the unstable political situation, but in the Imperial period, they were patronised by the Roman emperors and maintained their position as the most prestigious - if not the best attended - of the Panhellenic games. The city was a member of the revived Achaian League, which used Olympia as a centre for displaying its own honorific monuments.\nLike other parts of the Peloponnese, the number of rural settlements declined in the Imperial period, as small farms were consolidated into larger estates. The city of Elis and other surviving urban centres probably increased in size. The social elite remained stable until the third century AD. Many Elean elite families in this period had roots going back to the Hellenistic Period or earlier. From the late first cenutry BC onwards, prominent families began to receive Roman citizenship. They often had connections and citizenship in other cities within the province of Achaia. Many Eleans held important positions in the revived Achaian League. A very few elite Elean individuals entered the overall Imperial elite, becoming equites. But this was rare and no Eleans are known to have risen to the status of senator.\nThe Olympic Games continued in the first stages of the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity, but were finally ended by Theodosius in 394 AD, two years before the utter destruction of the country by the Gothic invasion under Alaric I. According to Hierocles's Synecdemus, Elis was a bishopric in the 6th century AD, subject to the bishop of Corinth. From the 9th century, the region prospered as part of the theme of the Peloponnese, with bishoprics at Olenus and Moreas.\nGeography\nThe region is one of the most agriculturally fertile regions of the Peloponnese. Elis was able to support herds of cattle and the raising of horses to a greater degree than many other regions. The marshes on the coast were home to a unique form of flax which was used to produce the especially fine byssos linen and became a substantial cash crop in the Imperial period. It is likely that there were salt pans on the coast as well, supplying the wider region's need for salt, although there is no direct evidence for this.\nDistricts\nAs described by Strabo, Elis was divided into three districts:\n* Koilē ( \"Hollow\", Latinised Coele), or Lowland Elis\n* Pisâtis (Πισᾶτις \"[territory] of Pisa\")\n* Triphylia (Τριφυλία Triphūlía \"Country of the Three Tribes\").\nKoilē Elis, the largest and most northern of the three, was watered by the river Peneus and its tributary, the Ladon. The district was famous during antiquity for its cattle and horses. Pisatis extended south from Koilē Elis to the right bank of the river Alpheios, and was divided into eight departments named after as many towns. Triphylia stretched south from the Alpheios to the river Neda.\nCity\nThe city of Elis () was the capital of the city state of Elis. It was located at the exit of the river Peneus from the mountains into the plain in the area of today's Ilida Municipality north of Kalyvia. It is said to have been founded in 471 BC by synoecism, however it is unclear what the ancient sources mean by this, the city already existed in the same place before and there were separate communities in the region of Elis before and after.\nThe first excavations in Elis were carried out from 1910 to 1914 by the Austrian Archaeological Institute under the direction of Otto Walter. From 1960 to 1981 the Archaeological Society of Athens carried out further excavations under the direction of Nikolaos Yalouris with Austrian participation. Some of the finds are exhibited in the local archaeological museum founded in 1981, for which a new building was built in 2003.\nNowadays Elis is a small village of 150 citizens located  NE of Amaliada, built over the ruins of the ancient town. It has one of the most well-preserved ancient theaters in Greece. Built in the fourth century BC, the theater had a capacity of 8,000 people; below it, Early Helladic, sub-Mycenaean and Protogeometric graves have been found.\nNotable Eleans\nAthletes\n* Coroebus of Elis, the first victor at the Olympic Games.\n* Troilus of Elis, 4th century BC equestrian\nIn mythology\n* Salmoneus, Aethlius, Pelops mythological kings of Elis\n*Endymion\n* Sons of Endymion:\n** Epeius\n** Aetolus\n** Paeon\n* Augeas, king of Elis related to the Fifth Labour of Heracles\n* Amphimachus, king of Elis and leader of Eleans in the Trojan War\n* Thalpius, leader of Eleans in the Trojan War\n* Oxylus, king of Elis\nIntellectuals\n* Alexinus (–265 BC), philosopher\n* Hippias of Elis, Greek sophist\n* Phaedo of Elis, founder of the Elean School\n* Pyrrho, founder of the Pyrrhonist school of philosophy\nEleans as barbarians\nEleans were labelled as the greatest barbarians barbarotatoi by musician Stratonicus of Athens\nIn Hesychius (s.v. ) and other ancient lexica, Eleans are also listed as barbarophones. Indeed, the North-West Doric dialect of Elis  is, after the Aeolic dialects, one of the most difficult for the modern reader of epigraphic texts.\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051218090605/http://www.culture.gr/2/21/maps/pelop/ilia/ilia.html Map] from the Hellenic Ministry of Culture (archived 18 December 2005)\n* [http://www.greek-thesaurus.gr/Ancient-Elis.html Elis – the city of the Olympic games]\n* [http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/klio.2013.95.issue-2/klio.2013.95.2.315/klio.2013.95.2.315.xml Mait Kõiv, Early History of Elis and Pisa: Invented or Evolving Traditions?]"
