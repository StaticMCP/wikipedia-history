They were one of the parties of the February 2019 peace deal. In September 2019, they lost control of Birao. On 17 February 2020 FPRC fighters tried to recapture Birao by attacking local MINUSCA forces. Their attack was repelled and 12 fighters were killed.\nOn 17 December 2020, an FPRC faction led by Noureddine Adam joined the Coalition of Patriots for Change, while the faction led by Abdoulaye Hissene remained committed to the 2019 peace agreement. Pro-CPC forces of general Mahamat Salleh took control of Bakouma on 31 December 2020 and then Bangassou on 3 January 2021.\nOrganization\nThe FPRC operates a parallel state in the northern part of the Central African Republic named the Republic of Logone. They have their own police, gendarmes, prisons, and military bases. They also collect taxes and levies. They profit from gold and diamond mines in the areas they control, including the Ndassima mine, which they jointly control with the Union for Peace in the Central African Republic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3u3bqx28A Central African Republic: The way of the warlord].
