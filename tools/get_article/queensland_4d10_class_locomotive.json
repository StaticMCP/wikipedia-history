However some materials had already been purchased for proposed new locomotives. In 1884/85 these were put to use to build four 2-4-2T locomotives at North Ipswich Railway Workshops. Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the 4D10 class in 1890, the 4 representing the number of driving wheels, the D that it was a tank locomotive, and the 10 the cylinder diameter in inches. A further four A10 Neilson class were converted to 4D10s.\nClass list\n{|cellpadding=\"2\"\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Works number\n!Southern & WesternRailway number\n!Queensland Railwaysnumber\n!In service\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=center|4\n|align=center|72\n|align=center|72\n|June 1884\n|Written off November 1902\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|73\n|align=center|73\n|July 1884\n|Written off November 1902\n|-\n|align=center|6\n|align=center|74\n|align=center|74\n|February 1885\n|Written off 1900\n|-\n|}\n|}\nReferences"
