In 1938, as head coach of the Chicago Black Hawks, he led the team to a championship, becoming the first U.S.-born coach to win the Stanley Cup. He is an inductee of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nEarly years\nBorn in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Stewart  grew up in Boston, Massachusetts, and competed in baseball, hockey, track, and wrestling in high school.\nSports career\nBaseball player, manager, and scout\nIn 1913, Stewart became a minor league baseball player with Worcester in the New England League, and in 1917 while with Montreal he was the first International League player to enlist for World War I service, joining the United States Navy. In these pre-war seasons, he primarily played as an outfielder.\nAfter the war, Stewart was signed by the Chicago White Sox in December 1918, but he suffered an arm injury falling down a flight of stairs while working as a census taker, and was sent to the minor leagues in May 1919. As he was, apparently, on a major league roster yet never appeared in a major league game, Stewart is an example of a \"phantom ballplayer.\"\nIn the 1920s, Stewart played parts of several seasons in the minor leagues, including three seasons as a pitcher: 1922 in Syracuse, New York, 1927 in Nashua, New Hampshire with the Nashua Millionaires, and 1928 in Waterbury, Connecticut.\nStewart was also a manager during three seasons: 1927 with the Nashua Millionaires, 1928 in Waterbury, and 1931 in Springfield, Massachusetts. He was also a scout for the Boston Red Sox in 1926 and 1927.\nIn 1929, he played summer baseball for Falmouth in the Cape Cod Baseball League. A steady pitcher, he was described as \"making up for his lack of speed with plenty of control and lots of headwork.\"\nIce hockey coach and referee\nDuring baseball offseasons in the 1910s and 1920s, Stewart generally coached Boston-area college and high school hockey teams. From 1925 to 1931 he was the head coach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIn 1928, Stewart became the NHL's first U.S.-born referee, and served in that capacity until 1941, excepting his two seasons as coach of the Chicago Black Hawks; 1937–38 (when the team won the Stanley Cup) and 1938–39.\nCoaching record\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"6\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"1\"|Post season\n|-\n!

He also was the home plate umpire for Johnny Vander Meer's second consecutive no-hitter in , and was the crew chief for the  three-game pennant playoff between the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers.\nDuring the 1948 World Series, Stewart made a controversial call in Game 1, which received significant press coverage. In a scoreless game in the bottom of the eighth inning. Boston Braves' pinch runner Phil Masi was on second base with one out. Cleveland Indians' pitcher Bob Feller attempted to pick off Masi at second base, and shortstop Lou Boudreau appeared to tag Masi out; however, Stewart called Masi safe. Masi subsequently scored the only run of the game, giving the Braves a win in the first game of the series. Stewart's ruling was hotly debated in the media and by fans, especially after Associated Press photographs of the play were published. Despite losing the first game, Cleveland would go on to win the series in six games. Upon his death in 1990, Masi's will revealed that he really was out on the play.\nStewart worked 714 consecutive games from the time he entered the NL until September 1938, when he was stricken with appendicitis. He resigned from the NL umpiring staff in January 1955 after not being promoted to league supervisor, a position he claimed had been promised him by commissioner Ford Frick when he had been NL president; new league president Warren Giles instead announced that the position would not be filled.\nLater years\nAfter retiring as an umpire, Stewart continued to work as a scout for the Cleveland Indians and Washington Senators.\nStewart coached the U.S. men's national hockey team in 1957, posting a 23–3–1 record, but the team was barred by the U.S. State Department from participating in the World Championships following the Soviet invasion of Hungary.\nIn February 1964, Stewart died at the Veterans Administration Hospital near his home in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston, after suffering a stroke two weeks earlier.\nStewart was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1982. His grandson Paul became an NHL player and referee and like his grandfather was elected to the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.ushockeyhall.com/page/show/3003279 Biography at the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame]\n*[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/S/Pstewb901.htm Umpiring record] at Retrosheet"
