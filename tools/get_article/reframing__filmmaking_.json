The term has been more often used in film criticism than in actual cinema.  Critics of the technique include André Bazin among others.\nIn production or post-production, reframing allows filmmakers to change a sequence without having to reshoot. For example, zooming in on an actor to edit out nudity for a movie to be broadcast over the air.\nTypes of reframing can include: pan, tilt, zoom, crane or boom shot, dolly or trucking shot, handheld shot, tracking shot, and steadycam shot.\nNotable films in which reframing is used\n*''A Bug's Life\n*Citizen Kane\n*The Player\n*Pretty Baby''\nReferences"
