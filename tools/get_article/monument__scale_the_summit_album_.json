It was self-released on July 10, 2007, and funded by the band members themselves. Chris Letchford described the songs as \"a lot more up tempo and in my opinion less organized, due to the lack of writing experience,\" and the production process as \"being sub-par in comparison to the band's standards owing to being self-funded.\"\n| rev2 = Brutalism.com\n| rev2score = (mixed)\n| rev3 = Metalreview.com\n| rev3score = (5/6)\n}}\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Scale the Summit\n* Chris Letchford – lead guitar\n* Travis Levrier – rhythm guitar\n* Jordan Eberhardt – bass\n* Pat Skeffington – drums\n;Additional personnel\n* Scale the Summit – production\nReferences"
