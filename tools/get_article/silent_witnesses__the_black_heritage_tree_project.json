The project received support for a collaborative team comprising Alicia Odewale, Justin Dunnavant, Clinton Johnson, Nick Okafor, Kristi Williams, and James Edward Mills. They will work alongside descendant communities, historians, forestry experts, and educators in Oklahoma, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to create a Global Black Heritage Tree Map.
