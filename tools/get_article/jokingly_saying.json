This is also her first album to be released by BMG Pacific as it had just acquired Current Records.  This album was a mixture of locally composed songs and covers of rather well-known American and Japanese songs.  Of the three singles, two were covers and one was an original composition.\nAlso included in this album was the song \"Fate 緣\", which was previously released on the EP of the same title.\nCovers\n* Track 1: \"愛是無涯 (Love Has No Boundaries)\" was a cover of Frances Yip's Cantonese version of Cliff Richard's 1984 single, \"Ocean Deep\".  Liew's version was released as the lead single off this album.\n* Track 3: \"Yesterday Dreamer\" was a cover of J-pop singer Yū Hayami's song of the same title, released in 1988.\n* Track 5: \"你說是甜我說苦 (Your Words Are Sweet, Mine Are Bitter)\" was a cover of \"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\", made famous by Crystal Gayle in 1977.\n* Track 7: \"有人 (Someone)\" was a cover of the Brian Hyland hit from 1962, \"Sealed with a Kiss\".  This song created buzz due to Australian singer Jason Donovan's cover version, which topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in June 1989.  BMG Music quickly secured the rights for this song in Hong Kong for Liew and pushed her to record it.  The arrangement of Liew's version changed the original gentle ballad into a dance song with a pulsating beat.  It was released as the third single of the album.\nTrack listing\nSource:\nReferences"
