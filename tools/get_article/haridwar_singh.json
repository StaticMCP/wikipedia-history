He was director of the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Ministry of Defence, from 1990 to 2004.\nDr. Singh died on 4 November 2017.\nBiography\nSingh was a scientist who researched energetic materials and the development of indigenous technologies for many varieties of solid rocket propellants like DBP (Double Base Propellant), nitramine base, fuel-rich propellants, and propellants based on new oxidizers. He also researched energetic binders and technologies for powerful and thermally stable high explosives as well as pyrotechnic smokes.\nHe found ways to extend the life of propulsion systems of advanced missiles, which resulted in financial savings for his country.\nHis contributions include the development of energetic low vulnerability gun propellants, Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) technology, Fuel Air Explosive (FAE), Thermo-baric explosive technology, and CCCT (Combustible Cartridge Case Technology).\nHe initiated and monitored many research programs in the area of high energy materials, especially propellants and explosives for rockets, missiles and pyrotechnics. Scientific achievements under his leadership include the development and transfer of technologies of high energy propellants for various applications including propellant technology of a class of LOw Vulnerability Ammunition (LOVA) for tank guns, development of explosive reactive armour, Combustible Cartridge Case Technology, High Explosive compositions for different types of warheads, non-smoky RDX-based propellants for booster and sustainer applications etc. He has contributed to Indian research on life extension of propulsion system of missiles.\nSingh was a close scientific advisor to the 11th president of India, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, and several Indian Prime Ministers.\nEducation\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
