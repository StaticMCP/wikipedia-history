It is named in honor of Merle Curti (1897–1996). A committee of 5 members of the Organization of American Historians chooses the winners from published monographs submitted by the author(s). Committee members represent the entire spectrum of American history and serve a one-year term. Beginning with the awards of 2004, the Committee may select 1 book \"winner\" in American intellectual history, 1 book \"winner\" in American social history, and may list other \"finalists\" in each field. \"Winners\" split a $1000 cash award.  Although not explicitly stated, \"American\" refers to the \"United States of America\" alone.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Winner\n! Title\n|-\n|1978\n|Henry F.
