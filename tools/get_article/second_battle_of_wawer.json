      "text": "# Second battle of Wawer\n\nThe second battle of Wawer () was an armed engagement between Polish and Imperial Russian troops. It happened on 31 March 1831 during the November Uprising and was one of the first battles of a successful Polish offensive planned by General Ignacy Prądzyński. On 31 March, during the period of the Polish operational initiative along the Siedlce road, the Polish grouping nominally commanded by General Jan Skrzynecki (15 battalions, 8 squadrons, 14 cannons) fought a victorious battle with the Russian corps of General Fyodor Gejsmar (6 battalions, 6 squadrons, 7 sotnia, 10 cannons). The lack of vigorous pursuit meant that the Russians, despite significant losses, managed to maintain combat value. An earlier clash in the same area occurred on 20 February 1831. The Polish success led to another victorious battle of Dębe Wielkie later that day.\nSee also\n* First battle of Wawer\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Second Battle of Wawer\n\n#REDIRECT Second battle of Wawer\n}}"
