His maternal grandparents were Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford and Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter.\nBooth served as a Member of Parliament for Cheshire in 1678, 1679 and 1679–1681, and was conspicuous for his opposition to Catholics. On 7 July 1670, he married Mary Langham, daughter of Sir James Langham, 2nd Baronet.\nAt a treason trial in the House of Lords in January 1685/6, Delamer was accused of participation in the Monmouth Rebellion, and the presiding judge in the case was Judge Jeffreys, as Lord High Steward, sitting with thirty other peers. The defence secured an acquittal.\nDuring the Revolution of 1688, Booth declared in favour of William of Orange, and raised an army in Cheshire in support of him. After William was installed as William III, he made Booth chancellor of the exchequer in 1689. He wrote a number of political tracts, which were published after his death as The Works of the Right Honourable Henry, Late L. Delamer, and Earl of Warrington. He also authored a tract in vindication of his friend, Lord Russel.  He was created Earl of Warrington on 17 April 1690.
