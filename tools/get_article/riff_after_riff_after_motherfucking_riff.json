(\"Vanilla Radio\" would later appear on the 2003 studio album The Wildhearts Must Be Destroyed.) An expanded version of the compilation called Riff After Riff was released in the US the following year, featuring several more tracks recorded by the band in 2001 and 2002. These additional songs were generally used as B-sides for the other singles from The Wildhearts Must Be Destroyed. All of the songs from both versions of this compilation except for \"Vanilla Radio\" are also found on the 2004 compilation Coupled With.\nJapanese Track listing\nRiff After Riff After Motherfucking Riff\n#\"Stormy in the North, Karma in the South\"\n#\"Putting it On\"\n#\"Looking for the One\"\n#\"Vanilla Radio\"\n#\"O.C.D\"\n#\"Better Than Cable\"\n#\"Let's Go\"\nUS Track listing\nRiff After Riff\n#\"Stormy in the North, Karma in the South\"\n#\"Putting it On\"\n#\"Looking for the One\"\n#\"Lake of Piss\"\n#\"Better Than Cable\"\n#\"If I Decide\"\n#\"Bang!\"\n#\"Action Panzer\"\n#\"The People That Life Forgot\"\n#\"Move On\"\n#\"O.C.D\"\n#\"Return to Zero\"\n#\"Let's Go\"\nReferences"
