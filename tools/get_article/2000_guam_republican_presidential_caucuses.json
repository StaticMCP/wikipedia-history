The contest was alongside primaries in American Samoa and Virgin Islands.\nProcedure\nAlthough Guam will not participate in the 2000 presidential election because it is a U.S. territory and not a state, it can participate in the U.S. presidential primaries and caucuses for both the Democratic and Republican parties, also Guam instead uses the presidential straw poll on Election Day.\nResults\nSee also\n* 2000 United States presidential election\n* 2000 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2000 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* United States presidential straw polls in Guam\n* 2000 Guam Democratic presidential caucuses\n* 2000 Guam presidential caucuses\nReferences"
