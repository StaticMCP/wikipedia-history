In 1971 the Grammy Awards had its first live telecast and therefore had its own sole venue each year for the telecast. From 1963 to 1970 the Academy aired a TV special annually called \"The Best On Record\" which highlighted the awards dinners. Since 2000, the Grammy Awards have been held most years atCrypto.com Arena located in Downtown Los Angeles.\nNon-televised era\nFrom 1959 to 1970, awards dinners were held in the following locations simultaneously on the same day:\n*1959–1961: Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and New York\n*1962–1964: Chicago, Los Angeles and New York\n*1965–1970: Chicago, Los Angeles, Nashville and New York\nTelevised era\nGrammy Award ceremonies have been televised live since 1971. The Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles has hosted the most Grammy Award telecasts, having hosted twenty-two times. The Shrine Auditorium which hosted fifteen times, was surpassed by the Crypto.com Arena as the most frequent Grammy telecast venue in 2017. Los Angeles has held a total of 42 Grammy Award telecasts, with New York having hosted eleven times and Nashville and Las Vegas serving as host one time each.\nBroadcasters\nThe Grammy Awards have aired primarily on CBS (and later including Paramount+) during its televised era. Starting in 2027, the awards will be broadcast on Disney platforms including ABC, Disney+ and Hulu as part of a ten year deal.\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n!
