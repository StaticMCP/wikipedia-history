Although Ireland has a thriving domestic film industry, most feature films are produced in English and are thus ineligible for the award. The Irish Film & Television Academy (IFTA) submits Ireland's entry.\nAs of 2025, twelve Irish films have been submitted, and only one, Colm Bairéad's The Quiet Girl, was nominated.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Ireland for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
