The party also uses the colors and a similar name of Calderón's father's party, the National Republican Party.\nThe Party was created soon after the Calderonistas left PUSC due to unusually harsh clashes among the Calderonista and Liberal factions inside the party during the general election of 2014. Both factions have been historically rivals but generally work together after the primaries. However, after the 2013 presidential primary (in which the Calderonista candidate Dr. Rodolfo Hernández won), internal fighting between Hernández and the Liberal-led National Committee caused Hernández's resignation.\nHernández and Calderón founded the PRSC a few months after the election, and its first election was in the 2016 municipal elections, with the party electing one mayor, one intendant and several aldermen and syndics. Its candidate for the 2018 Costa Rican general election, is Hernández.\nElectoral performance\nPresidential\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Election\n!rowspan=2|Candidate\n!colspan=4|First round\n!colspan=4|Second round\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Position\n!Result\n!Votes\n!%\n!Position\n!Result\n|-\n! 2018\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Rodolfo Hernández\n| 106,444\n| 4.94%\n| 6th\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|-\n! 2022\n| 12,224\n| 0.58%\n|  12th\n|\n| colspan=\"4\"\n|}\nParliamentary\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!
