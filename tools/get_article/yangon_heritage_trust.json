Yangon has Asia's largest collection of colonial-era buildings. The Trust has proposed to designate small zones within the city centre (particularly in Downtown Yangon) as heritage areas and envisions a joint public-private collaboration whereby private investors restore heritage buildings for commercial use while maintaining the character of the areas. The Trust also advocates a conservation plan led by the private sector.\nIn June 2013, Philips announced a partnership with the Trust to install 200 LED-lit blue plaques to highlight key cultural heritage sites in the city.\nThere are around 15,000 buildings in Yangon that the Trust wants preserved, and as of 2020 it has helped with 350 conservation projects.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Yangon\n* Yangon City Heritage List"
