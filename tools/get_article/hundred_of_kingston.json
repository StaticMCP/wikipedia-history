Its area has been mostly absorbed by the growth of London and its name currently refers to both the suburban town of Kingston upon Thames and the larger Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames. Its former area now corresponds to that borough and part of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames in Greater London and part of the borough of Elmbridge in Surrey. It bordered the Hundred of Brixton to the east, the Hundred of Elmbridge to the south, and to the west and north by the River Thames.\nIt contained the following parishes:\n*Chessington (until 1610)\n*Esher (part)\n*Ham with Hatch (created in 1866 from part of Kingston upon Thames)\n*Hook (created in 1866 from part of Kingston upon Thames)\n*Kew\n*Kingston upon Thames\n*Long Ditton\n*Malden\n*Petersham\n*Richmond\n*Thames Ditton (part, from 1769)\nIn Domesday Book it is recorded as containing Kingston, Petersham, Long Ditton, Thames Ditton, and Malden.  In 1871 the hundred is described as containing six parishes and part of another. It was cut into two divisions; the first was  and the second was 3,618.
