There was only one candidate, Hafez al-Assad, with voters asked to approve or reject his candidacy. A reported 99% of voters voted in favour, with a turnout of 95%.\nThese were the first elections to ever take place in Ba'athist Syria, which was established in 1963 following the 1963 coup that brought the Ba'ath Party to power. The elections marked the beginning of the Assad dynasty, who seized power in November 1970; the Ba'ath Party and Assad family would rule Syria for the next six decades until the regime was overthrown by anti-Assad rebels in 2024.\nResults\nReferences"
