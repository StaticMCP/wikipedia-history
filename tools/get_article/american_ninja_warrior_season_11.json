City qualifying and finals competitions were held in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Oklahoma City, Seattle/Tacoma, marking the first time a course was held in the Pacific Northwest, Baltimore, and Cincinnati.\nThe course returns with new twists in the qualifying rounds, including changes to the Mega Wall, and a new reward competition, the Power Tower. Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila returned for their respective tenth and seventh seasons while newcomer Zuri Hall joined the duo as a sideline reporter, replacing Kristine Leahy. Season 7 course finisher and \"Total Victory\" achiever Geoff Britten participated, marking his return to competition in the series but fell in Seattle/Tacoma Qualifying, marking the end of his season.\nDrew Drechsel finished first and apparently became the third person to achieve \"Total Victory\" on American Ninja Warrior. He was arrested almost a year later on August 4, 2020, following accusations of federal child sex-related charges, with NBC and A. Smith & Co. Productions subsequently cutting ties with him the following day. Dreschel pled guilty on June 1, 2023, on one count of attempting to receive and enticement to travel for illicit child sexual conduct. On June 26, 2024, Dreschel was sentenced to 121 months in prison.\nCompetition schedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Qualifier airing\n! Finals airing\n! City\n! Episode taping\n!

In the city qualifiers, the two fastest finalists from each course competed against each other for a \"speed pass\" that immediately advances the recipient to the National Finals. In the city finals courses, the Power Tower offered a \"safety pass\" that allows the recipient a second chance to complete Stage 1 or 2 of the National Finals. Most of the ninjas had to play their Safety Passes from the City Finals with 2 using it on Stage 1 (Drew Drechsel and Flip Rodriguez) and the other 3 using it on Stage 2 (Dave Cavanagh, Mathis 'Kid' Owhadi, and Karson Voiles). The only ninja who didn't play it was Michael Torres because he finished Stage 1 and 2 and it is not allowed to be used on Stage 3. The only ninjas who played it but failed to advance to Stage 3 were Flip Rodriguez, who timed out on the Water Walls after using it on Stage 1 when he fell on the Diving Boards, and Dave Cavanagh, who fell twice on Stage 2, first on Giant Walk the Plank, and then on the Extension Ladder.\nMega Wall changes\nThe Mega Wall, introduced in the tenth season, returns with new rules. Contestants must now choose which version to attempt—the 14.5-foot Warped Wall or the 18-foot Mega Wall—and cannot change once they have attempted one or the other. In addition, contestants are now allowed three attempts at the Mega Wall, and can win cash on any of them: $10,000 for scaling it on the first try, $5,000 on the second, or $2,500 on the third.\nPower Tower\nA new obstacle, the Power Tower, was also introduced.

In the audience was \"The 12s\", Seattle Seahawks fan club, along with the Mariner Moose from the Seattle Mariners. Musician Ryan Phillips from rock band Story of the Year ran the course, making it to the fifth obstacle. Sprint car driver McKenna Haase also competed, getting to the third obstacle. U.S. Olympic decathlete Jeremy Taiwo gave the course a try, but failed on the Lightning Bolts. U.S. Olympic halfpipe skier Alex Ferreira also tried his luck on the course, only making it to the second obstacle. Former baseball player for the Mariners Ryan Rowland-Smith became the first MLB pitcher to compete, getting to the second obstacle. Also, Geoff Britten, who conquered Stage 4 in Season 7, made his return to the course. But his comeback was short-lived as he failed on the Broken Bridge, marking the first time he fell in qualifying.\nPE teacher Sandy Zimmerman, a National Judo Champion, former Gonzaga University basketball player, and mother of three, became the first mom to finish the course in the show's history. She was also the first and oldest woman (age 42) to complete the course this season, soon followed by stuntwoman Jessie Graff who returned to ANW after a year absence.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n!Rank\n!Competitor\n!Time\n!Furthest Obstacle\n|-\n|1\n|Leif Sundberg\n|0:58.75\n|Finished\n|-\n|2\n|Sean Bryan\n|1:14.37\n|Finished\n|-\n|3\n|Jake Murray\n|1:25.37\n|Finished\n|-\n|4\n|Lorin Ball\n|1:39.59\n|Finished\n|-\n|5\n|David Moonen\n|1:46.38\n|Finished\n|-\n|6\n|Ben Martin\n|1:59.60\n|Finished\n|-\n|7\n|Alex Hatch\n|2:15.38\n|Finished\n|-\n|8\n|Jessie Graff\n|2:45.38\n|Finished\n|-\n|9\n|Scott Behrends\n|2:49.06\n|Finished\n|-\n|10\n|Lance Pekus\n|2:57.74\n|Finished (Mega Wall)\n|-\n|11\n|Marquez Green\n|3:03.13\n|Finished\n|-\n|12\n|Justin Gielski\n|3:18.51\n|Finished\n|-\n|13\n|Sandy Zimmerman\n|3:44.18\n|Finished\n|-\n|14\n|Josh Kronberg\n|1:31.63\n|Mega Wall\n|-\n|15\n|Karson Voiles\n|1:45.66\n|Mega Wall\n|-\n|16\n|Reko Rivera\n|2:02.11\n|Mega Wall\n|-\n|17\n|Dan Yager\n|2:07.76\n|Mega Wall\n|-\n|18\n|Bart Copeland\n|2:19.10\n|Mega Wall\n|-\n|19\n|Jackson Meyer\n|0:29.12\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|20\n|Nick Hanson\n|0:45.34\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|21\n|Nate Burkhalter\n|0:49.53\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|22\n|Rainer Jundt\n|0:49.53\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|23\n|Matt Dolce\n|1:00.82\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|24\n|Brandon Varner\n|1:13.29\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|25\n|Jeremy Taiwo\n|1:14.98\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|26\n|Zack Scholes\n|1:17.07\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|27\n|Michael Larlee\n|1:17.21\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|28\n|Gavin Maxwell\n|1:17.62\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|29\n|Glenn Albright\n|1:19.58\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|30\n|Sean Darling-Hammond\n|1:19.84\n|Lightning Bolts\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n!Rank\n!Competitor\n!Time\n!Furthest Obstacle\n|-\n|1\n|Jessie Graff\n|2:45.38\n|Finished\n|-\n|2\n|Sandy Zimmerman\n|3:44.18\n|Finished\n|-\n|3\n|Mady Howard\n|1:25.26\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|4\n|Christi Marie\n|1:37.26\n|Lightning Bolts\n|-\n|5\n|Meagan Martin\n|1:50.19\n|Lightning Bolts\n|}\nFinals\nThe city finals on this course introduced a new obstacle, Northwest Passage.

This was also the first time in history that two city finals courses in one season concluded without any finishers and the fourth time that a city finals course was unfinished.
