It was hosted for the third ceremony in a row by theatre star Jodie Prenger and Tom Read Wilson. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shut-down of UK theatres due to lockdowns, the 2021 edition of the show was cancelled and was replaced by an online event which celebrated twenty one members of the public who had supported the theatre industry during the pandemic, rather than the usual awarding of theatre productions themselves. The 2022 ceremony returns to awarding creative talent involved in West End theatre and is fully voted for by the British theatergoing public, who voted for their winners on WhatsOnStage.com.\nThe stage adaptation of Disney's blockbuster film Frozen received the most nominations with thirteen, equaling the record set by & Juliet at the 2020 ceremony, while The Tragedy of Macbeth was the most nominated play, with five nods. Due to the large volume of eligible productions, the number of nominations in each category was raised from five to six for the first time. The performance categories were changed to be gender-neutral in an effort to be more inclusive.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominees for the 22nd WhatsOnStage Awards were announced on 9 December 2021 by James Graham and Gabrielle Brooks in a livestream from The Other Palace.\nwon Best Performer in a Male Identifying Role in a Play.]]\nwon Best Performer in a Female Identifying Role in a Play.]]\nwon Best Performer in a Male Identifying Role in a Musical.]]\nwon Best Performer in a Female Identifying Role in a Musical.]]\nwon Best Direction for Frozen.]]\nwon Best Sound Design.]]\nwon Best Lighting Design.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
