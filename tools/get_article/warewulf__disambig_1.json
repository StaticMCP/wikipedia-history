It allows a central administration model for all slave nodes and includes the tools needed to build configuration files, monitor, and control the nodes. It is totally customizable and can be adapted to just about any type of cluster. From the software administration perspective it does not make much difference if you are running 2 nodes or 500 nodes. The procedure is still the same, which is why Warewulf is scalable from the admins perspective. Also, because it uses a standard chroot'able file system for every node, it is extremely configurable and lends itself to custom environments very easily.\nWhile Warewulf was designed to be a high-performance computing (HPC) system, it is not an HPC system in itself. Warewulf is more along the lines of a distributed Linux distribution, or more specifically a system for replicating and managing small, lightweight Linux systems from one master. Using Warewulf, HPC packages such as LAM/MPI/MPICH, Sun Grid Engine, PVM, etc. can be easily deployed throughout the cluster.\nWarewulf solves the problem of slave node management rather than being a strict HPC specific system (even though it was designed with HPC in mind). Because of this it is as flexible as a home grown cluster, but administratively scales very well. As a result of this flexibility and ease of customization, Warewulf has been used not only on production HPC implementations, but also development systems like KASY0 (the first system to break the one hundred dollar per GFLOPS barrier), and non HPC systems such as web server cluster farms, intrusion detection clusters, and high-availability clusters.\nSee also\n* oneSIS – another diskless cluster package\n* xCAT – Extreme Cloud Administration Toolkit – offers complete management for HPC clusters, RenderFarms, Grids, WebFarms, Online Gaming Infrastructure, Clouds, Datacenters\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://warewulf.lbl.gov/ Warewulf Project]\n* [https://github.com/warewulf/ Warewulf on Github]\n* [http://moo.nac.uci.edu/~hjm/bduc/warewulf.html Warewulf HOWTO]\n* [http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Warewulf-Cluster-Manager-Master-and-Compute-Nodes/(language)/eng-US Admin Magazine: Warewulf Cluster Manager – Howlingly Great]\n* [http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/warewulf_cluster_manager_completing_the_environment/(language)/eng-US Admin Magazine: Warewulf Cluster Manager – Part 2]\n* [http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Warewulf-Cluster-Manager-Development-and-Run-Time/(language)/eng-US Admin Magazine: Warewulf Cluster Manager – Part 3]\n* [http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Warewulf-Cluster-Manager-Administration-and-Monitoring/(language)/eng-US Admin Magazine: Warewulf Cluster Manager – Part 4]\n* [http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Warewulf-4-Code Admin Magazine: Warewulf Cluster Manager Listings 1-6]\n* [http://moo.nac.uci.edu/~hjm/bduc/warewulf.html WareWulf How-To: SysAdmins]\n* [https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/group/warewulf General Warewulf Discussions]\n* [https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/group/warewulf-devel Warewulf Development Discussions]\n* [http://www.perceus.org/ Perceus]"
