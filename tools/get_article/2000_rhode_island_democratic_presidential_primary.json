The Rhode Island primary was a semi-closed primary, with the state awarding 33 delegates, of whom 22 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nVice president Al Gore won the primary with almost 57% of the vote and 13 delegates, while senator Bill Bradley won only roughly 40% of the vote and secured 9 delegates. The remaining 3% went to one other candidate, Lyndon LaRouche Jr., write-in votes and an uncommitted option. Gore did not cross the necessary majority of 2,171 delegates to officially win the Democratic nomination after Super Tuesday, but Bradley would withdraw three days later, leaving Gore as the presumptive nominee.\nProcedure\nRhode Island was one of 15 states and one territory holding primaries on Super Tuesday.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 7&nbsp;a.m. until 8&nbsp;p.m. In the semi-closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15% at the congressional district or statewide level to be considered viable. The 26 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, 7 each were allocated to both of the state's 2 congressional districts and another 3 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 5 at-large delegates.\nThe delegation also included 9 unpledged PLEO delegates: 7 members of the Democratic National Committee, 3 members of Congress (One senator, Jack Reed, and two representatives, Patrick Kennedy and Robert Weygand), and 1 add-on.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
