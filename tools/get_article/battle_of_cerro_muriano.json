The battle is perhaps most known today for the famous photograph, The Falling Soldier, that Robert Capa took during it.\nLocation\nCerro Muriano is a village in Andalusia currently within the municipal terms of Córdoba and Obejo in the Province of Córdoba.\nHistory\nThe battle followed the August Córdoba offensive and lasted two days, 5 and 6 September 1936. After a 36-hour siege the Regulares and the Spanish Legion troops overran the Republican positions of the Columna Miaja leaving many dead.\nThe battle is famous owing to the picture of a \"falling militiaman\" taken by Robert Capa, a picture that sought to represent the tragic fate of the Spanish Republic.\nSee also\n*The Falling Soldier controversy\n*List of Spanish Republican military equipment of the Spanish Civil War\n*List of Spanish Nationalist military equipment of the Spanish Civil War\nReferences"
