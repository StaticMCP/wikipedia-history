The schools are all located in the city's University Heights neighborhood which borders downtown.\nThe institutions that made up CHEN were organized as an unincorporated association. CHEN was founded  to foster internal cooperation among the four institutions with regard to research and educational opportunities for their respective populations and to contribute to the ongoing revitalization of University Heights, and, more broadly, to the economic development of Newark and the northern New Jersey region in general.\nCitations\nExternal links\n* [http://njms.rutgers.edu/ New Jersey Medical School website]\n* [http://www.njit.edu/ NJIT website]\n* [http://www.newark.rutgers.edu/ Rutgers–Newark website]\n* [http://www.essex.edu/ Essex County College website]"
