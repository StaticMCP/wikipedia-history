It was consecrated on 26 July 1860 by Henry Pepys the Bishop of Worcester. The spire was completed in 1866.\nThe north aisle, organ chamber and vestries were added in 1883 by J. A. Chatwin. The west end was enlarged in 1899 by J. P. Sharp.\nOrgan\nAn organ was presented to the church around 1864 by Mr. Dawes. This was replaced in 1892 by an organ by Flight and Robson from St. John's Church, Blackheath, London.\nIn 1926 and organ by Nicholson and Co was installed. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. This was replaced in 2008 by a Phoenix Digital Organ.\nNotable clergy\n* David Monteith, now Dean of Leicester and Canterbury, served his curacy here from 1993 to 1997.\n* Michael Parker, later Bishop of Bradford, was vicar from 1939 to 1957\nReferences"
