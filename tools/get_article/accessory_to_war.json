      "text": "# Accessory to War\n\nAccessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military is the fifteenth book by American astrophysicist and science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson which he co-wrote with researcher and writer Avis Lang. It was released on September 11, 2018 by W. W. Norton & Company. The book chronicles war and the use of space as a weapon going as far back as before the Ancient Greeks, and includes examples such as Christopher Columbus' use of his knowledge of a lunar eclipse and the use of satellite intelligence by the United States during the Gulf War. While speaking on the book, Tyson told National Geographic that he regards the collaboration between science and the military as a \"two-way street.\"\nMarcelo Gleiser wrote that the book \"rings like a wake-up call, even if an uncomfortable one.\"\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06612-w The long entanglement of war and astrophysics] - Sharon Weinberger, nature.com\n* [https://www.stripes.com/multimedia/podcasts/military_matters/2023-05-02/neil-degrasse-tyson-military-astrophysics-9970334.html Neil deGrasse Tyson on ‘Accessory to War’ and the ‘moon situation’] - Brian McElhiney, stripes.com\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/magazine/neil-degrasse-tyson-war.html Neil deGrasse Tyson on the Surprising Alliance Between Astrophysicists and the Military] - John Ismay, The New York Times"
