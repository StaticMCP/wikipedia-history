The city of Zaragoza was the most important cities in Sharq al-Andalus, as the Almoravids made it the capital of the Upper March (), It was also a base for them to launch campaigns against the Kingdom of Aragon and Catalan Counties.\nExpeditions\nIn 1112, Ibn al-Hajj left from Zaragoza with his forces heading to the lands of Aragon, where he destroyed the Huesca region and the surrounding cities, the Almoravid forces reached the town of Ayera northeast of Huesca, where they captured and sacked it. Its governor Íñigo Sanz de Laves was among the prisoners. The invading forces continued their attacks north, raiding the Cinca River and foothills of the Pyrenees\nBetween 1113 and 1114, the Almoravids, led by Ibn al-Hajj carried out heavy raids on the regions of Huesca and Barbastro, during this campaign, the Almoravids recaptured the towns of Chalamera, Ontiñena, , Sariñena and Velilla de Cinca, the attacks reached Catalonia and the foothills of the Pyrenees. There was no Aragonese or Christian resistance, as Ibn al-Hajj returned to Zaragoza after that.\nAftermath\nThe absence of Alfonso I had a profound impact on the southern borders of his kingdom, which he was then tasked with defending. In late 1114, the governors of Zaragoza and Valencia, Muhammad ibn al-Hajj and Muhammad ibn Aisha, launched a campaign against Catalonia. While returning to Zaragoza, they were ambushed at Martorell by Catalan troops, resulting in the deaths of Muhammad ibn al-Hajj.\nIn 1118, after six years in captivity, Íñigo Sanz de Laves finally paid a ransom of 500 mithqals for himself, his wife, his son and his daughter.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n* [https://books.google.it/books?id=-MgAEQAAQBAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&lpg=PT55&dq=Como%20la%20aceifa%20de%201112%20que%20devast%C3%B3%20el%20distrito%20de%20Barbastro%2C%20la%20planicie%20oscense%20y%20el%20Cinca%3B&hl=it&pg=PT55#v=onepage&q=Como%20la%20aceifa%20de%201112%20que%20devast%C3%B3%20el%20distrito%20de%20Barbastro,%20la%20planicie%20oscense%20y%20el%20Cinca;&f=false]\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
