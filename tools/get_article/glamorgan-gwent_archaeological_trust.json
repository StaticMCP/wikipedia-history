Actions are advised to ensure that proper assessments are carried out and appropriate measures implemented to ensure that Historic Environment interests are protected. As a result of potential conflicts of interest this area of work is separately staffed and funded and governed by a Code of Conduct approved by Cadw.\nThe Trust also provides general advice through its Heritage Management Services to a variety of institutions and organisations including the Forestry Authority, CCW, Statutory Undertakers, the Environment Agency, National Trust, and the Church in Wales. The Trust is also a reporting station for the Portable Antiquities scheme.\nThe Trust through its Projects teams undertakes assessments, evaluations, surveys, watching-briefs, building recording and excavations in South Wales and elsewhere. It has had extensive involvement with many major developments in the area. In addition Projects staff carry out area wide monument assessment and historic landscape characterisation works with the intention of improving the information and evidence base to support enhanced protection of the historic environment. The Trust has an active commercial archaeology team, based in a separate office in Newport. This is the location of one of the archaeological projects undertaken in Wales - the Newport Ship, which was excavated in 2002.\nThe Trust has also contributed to developing research agendas through publication of its work. It promotes knowledge and learning about the past through publication, displays, leaflets, lectures and talks and seeks to involve the community of southeast Wales in its work.\nThe Trust is a Registered Organisation with the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists and requires all employees, whether corporate members of the Institute or not, to adhere to the Institute's Codes and Standards as a condition of employment.\nNotable people\n* Henry Owen-John, Deputy Director of the Trust 1977-1991\n* H.N. Savory, Chair of the Trust 1976-1984\n* Andrew Marvell, Director of the Trust since 2004\nDissolution\nIn September 2023 the four Welsh Archaeological Trusts agreed to merge. As part of this process, in November 2023 the Dyfed Archaeological Trust changed its name to Heneb: the Trust for Welsh Archaeology. In April 2024 the other three Welsh Archaeological Trusts will join Heneb: the Trust for Welsh Archaeology. The resulting organisation will have a pan-Wales overview, whilst maintaining regionally-based operations.\nSee also\n*Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust\n*Dyfed Archaeological Trust\n*Gwynedd Archaeological Trust\n*Cadw\n*Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales\n*Welsh Archaeological Trusts\n*Archaeology of Wales\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ggat.org.uk/ Website of the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust]\n*[http://www.archwilio.org.uk/ Archwilio] website to access the Historic Environment Records (HERs) of Wales (held by the 4 Welsh Archaeological Trusts)"
