The park includes a fleet of historic vessels, a visitor center, a maritime museum, and a library/research facility. Formerly referred to as the San Francisco Maritime Museum, the collections were acquired by the National Park Service in 1978. The San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park was authorized in 1988; the maritime museum is among the park's many cultural resources. The park also incorporates the Aquatic Park Historic District, bounded by Van Ness Avenue, Polk Street, and Hyde Street.\nHistory\nPhilanthropist Alma de Bretteville Spreckels last major project was the construction of the San Francisco Maritime Museum. When it opened in 1951, her collection of model ships that had been on display at the 1939–40 Golden Gate International Exposition was the main exhibit. She had had a feud with museum founding director, Karl Kortum, and as a result, did not receive much recognition for her role in the museum's establishment.\nHistoric vessel fleet\nThe historic fleet of the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park is moored at the park's Hyde Street Pier. The fleet consists of the following major vessels:\n*Balclutha, an 1886 built square rigged sailing ship.\n*C.A. Thayer, an 1895 built schooner.\n*Eureka, an 1890 built steam ferryboat.\n*Alma, an 1891 built scow schooner.\n*Hercules, a 1907 built steam tug.\n*Eppleton Hall, a 1914 built paddlewheel tug.\nImage:Alma (scow schooner, San Francisco) 2.JPG|\nImage:Hercules (steam tug, San Francisco).JPG|\nImage:Balclutha (San Francisco).JPG|\nImage:Eppleton Hall (San Francisco).jpg|\nImage:Eureka (steam ferryboat, San Francisco).JPG|\nImage:C A Thayer.JPG|\nThe fleet also includes over one hundred small craft.\nVisitor center\nThe visitor center is housed in the park's 1909 waterfront warehouse, located at the corner of Hyde and Jefferson streets. The City of San Francisco declared the four-story brick structure a historic landmark in 1974, and the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Inside, exhibits (including a first order Fresnel lighthouse lens and a shipwrecked boat) tell the story of San Francisco's colorful and diverse maritime heritage. The visitor center also contains a theater and an information desk.\nMaritime Museum\nThe maritime museum used to be housed in a Streamline Moderne (late Art Deco) building that is the centerpiece of the Aquatic Park Historic District, a National Historic Landmark at the foot of Polk Street and a minute's walk from the visitor center and Hyde Street Pier. The building was originally built (starting in 1936) by the WPA as a public bathhouse, and its interior is decorated with fantastic and colorful murals, created primarily by artist and color theoretician Hilaire Hiler. The architects were William Mooser Jr. and William Mooser III. It is currently the San Francisco Senior Center.\nMaritime Research Center\nThe Research Center describes itself as \"[t]he premier resource for San Francisco and Pacific Coast maritime history.
