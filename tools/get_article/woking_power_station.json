The power station was operated by the Woking Electric Supply Company Limited until the nationalisation of the British electricity industry in 1948. It was redeveloped after the First World War to meet the increased demand for electricity.\nHistory\nThe Woking Electricity Supply Company obtained a provisional order in 1890 under the Electric Lighting Acts to generate and supply electricity to Borough of Woking. The  was granted by the Board of Trade and was confirmed by Parliament through the Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 5) Act 1890 (54 & 55 Vict. c. cxc). The company built a power station in Board School Road, Woking () which was commissioned in 1890.\nThe Woking Electric Supply Company Limited was formed on 5 December 1895 to acquire the Woking Electricity Supply Company. The company undertook a major upgrade of the plant in 1918–28.\nThe British electricity supply industry was nationalised in 1948 under the provisions of the Electricity Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo. 6. c. 54). The Woking electricity undertaking was abolished, ownership of Woking power station was vested in the British Electricity Authority, and subsequently the Central Electricity Authority and the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). At the same time the electricity distribution and sales responsibilities of the Woking electricity undertaking were transferred to the South Eastern Electricity Board (SEEBOARD).\nWoking power station was closed in 1959–60.\nEquipment specification\nPlant in 1898\nThe generating plant in 1898 comprised Corliss Compound Engines and a Belliss and Parsons steam turbine coupled directly and by belts to Mordey and Parsons dynamos. The plant had a generating capacity of 255&nbsp;kW.\nPlant in 1919\nIn 1919 the generating capacity at Woking power station was 2,100&nbsp;kW, the maximum load on the feeders was 1,192&nbsp;kW, and there was 5,950&nbsp;kW of connections on the circuits.\nPlant in 1923\nBy 1923 the plant comprised boilers delivering 55,000&nbsp;lb/h (6.93&nbsp;kg/s) of steam to:\n* 2 × 150&nbsp;kW reciprocating engines driving alternating current (AC) alternators\n* 2 × 400&nbsp;kW reciprocating engines AC alternators\n* 2 × 1,000&nbsp;kW steam turbo-alternator (AC)\nThese machines had a total generating capacity of 3,100&nbsp;kW.\nElectricity supply to consumers was at 200 V AC.\nPlant in 1954\nBy 1954 the plant comprised:\n* Boilers:\n** 2 × Babcock and Wilcox 25,000&nbsp;lb/h (3.15&nbsp;kg/s) chain grate stoker boilers, steam conditions were 175 psi and 680&nbsp;°F (12.1 bar and 360&nbsp;°C),\n** 1 × Babcock and Wilcox 15,000&nbsp;lb/h (1.9&nbsp;kg/s) chain grate stoker boiler, steam conditions as above, steam was supplied to:\n* Generators:\n** 1 × 2.5 MW Brush-Ljungstrom 2 kV single phase turbo-alternator\n** 1 × 2.0 MW Brush-Ljungstrom 2 kV single phase turbo-alternator\n** 2 × 1.25 MW Brush-Ljungstrom 2 kV single phase turbo-alternators\nThe total generating capacity was 7 MW.\nCondenser water was cooled in a Premier cooling tower with a capacity of 0.24 million gallons per hour (1,091 m3/hour).\nOperations\nOperating data 1898\nThe 1898 generating plant had a capacity of 484&nbsp;kW and a maximum load was 125&nbsp;kW .\nOperating date 1919\nIn 1919 the amount of electricity generated was 2,243 MWh, the total sold was 1,847 MWh to 2,317 customers.\nOperating data 1921–23\nThe electricity supply data for the period 1921–23 was:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Woking power station supply data 1921–23\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Electricity  Use\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Units\n! colspan=\"3\" |Year\n|-\n!1921\n!1922\n!1923\n|-\n|Lighting  and domestic\n|MWh\n|1,412\n|1,469\n|1,603\n|-\n|Public  lighting\n|MWh\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Traction\n|MWh\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Power\n|MWh\n|828\n|659\n|668\n|-\n|Bulk  supply\n|MWh\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Total  use\n|MWh\n|2,240\n|2,128\n|2,271\n|}\nThe electricity Loads on the system were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Year\n|1921\n|1922\n|1923\n|-\n!Maximum  load\n!kW\n|1,337\n|1,526\n|1,395\n|-\n!Total  connections\n!kW\n|5,929\n|6,100\n|7,123\n|-\n!Load  factor\n!Per  cent\n|23.6\n|19.5\n|22.7\n|}\nRevenue from the sale of current (in 1923) was £45,507; the surplus of revenue over expenses was £27,283.\nOperating data 1931–36\nIn 1931 Woking power station generated 9,663 MWh and sold a total of 7,912 MWh. Woking Electric Supply Company Limited supplied electricity to Woking, Chertsey, Bisley, Byfleet, Pyrford, Ockham, Pirbight, Send, Ripley, Wisley, Littleton, Shepperton and Laleham.\nIn 1933 the company sold 9,826 MWh; in 1934 11,512 MWh; and in 1935 13,597 MWh. In 1936 no electricity was generated by Woking, the undertaking purchased its supply which amounted to 18,989 MWh. In that year there was a load of 33,059&nbsp;kW connected to the system. There were 15,764 customers.\nOperating data 1946\nIn 1946 Woking power station supplied 3,527 MWh of electricity; the maximum output load was 5,443&nbsp;kW.\nOperating data 1954–58\nOperating data for the period 1954–58 was:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Woking power station operating data, 1954–58\n!Year\n!Running hours\n!Max output capacity,  MW\n!Electricity supplied, MWh\n!Thermal efficiency per cent\n|-\n|1954\n|307\n|4\n|888\n|6.28\n|-\n|1955\n|166\n|4\n|169\n|2.23\n|-\n|1956\n|196\n|2\n|472\n|9.86\n|-\n|1957\n|80\n|2\n|59\n|3.27\n|-\n|1958\n|73\n|2\n|62\n|5.03\n|}\nThe amount of electricity sold by the Woking Electric Supply Company Limited in MWh was as follows:{\n\"version\": 2,\n\"width\": 500,\n\"height\": 200,\n\"data\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"table\",\n\"values\": [\n{\n\"x\": 1913,\n\"y\": 854\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1919,\n\"y\": 1847\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1921,\n\"y\": 2240\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1922,\n\"y\": 2128\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1923,\n\"y\": 2271\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1931,\n\"y\": 7912\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1933,\n\"y\": 9826\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1934,\n\"y\": 11512\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1935,\n\"y\": 13597\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1936,\n\"y\": 18989\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1946,\n\"y\": 3527\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1954,\n\"y\": 888\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1955,\n\"y\": 169\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1956,\n\"y\": 472\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1957,\n\"y\": 59\n},\n{\n\"x\": 1958,\n\"y\": 62\n}\n]\n}\n],\n\"scales\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"x\",\n\"type\": \"ordinal\",\n\"range\": \"width\",\n\"zero\": false,\n\"domain\": {\n\"data\": \"table\",\n\"field\": \"x\"\n}\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"y\",\n\"type\": \"linear\",\n\"range\": \"height\",\n\"nice\": true,\n\"domain\": {\n\"data\": \"table\",\n\"field\": \"y\"\n}\n}\n],\n\"axes\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"x\",\n\"scale\": \"x\"\n},\n{\n\"type\": \"y\",\n\"scale\": \"y\"\n}\n],\n\"marks\": [\n{\n\"type\": \"rect\",\n\"from\": {\n\"data\": \"table\"\n},\n\"properties\": {\n\"enter\": {\n\"x\": {\n\"scale\": \"x\",\n\"field\": \"x\"\n},\n\"y\": {\n\"scale\": \"y\",\n\"field\": \"y\"\n},\n\"y2\": {\n\"scale\": \"y\",\n\"value\": 0\n},\n\"fill\": {\n\"value\": \"steelblue\"\n},\n\"width\": {\n\"scale\": \"x\",\n\"band\": \"true\",\n\"offset\": -1\n}\n}\n}\n}\n]\n}\nWoking Electricity District\nFollowing nationalisation in 1948 Woking power station became part of the Woking electricity supply district, covering 69 square miles (179&nbsp;km2) with a population of 110,090 in 1958.
