      "text": "# Aryanandi (8th century)\n\nAcharya Aryanandi (fl. 8th century CE) was a Digambar Jain monk and teacher, best known as the spiritual preceptor of Acharya Virasena, the influential commentator on Jain canonical literature. Aryanandi is remembered primarily through the \"pattavali\" (monastic lineage records), where he is credited with transmitting key teachings of the Digambara tradition to the next generation of scholars.\nLife\nAryanandi lived during the early to mid-8th century CE, a formative period in the evolution of Digambara scholarship in South India. Though few biographical details survive, his presence is recorded in Jain monastic genealogies as an important link between earlier acharyas and the flowering of scholastic activity during the Rashtrakuta period.\nInfluence and Disciples\nAryanandi's most important disciple was:\nAcharya Virasena – the principal author of portions of the Dhavala commentary on the Shatkhandagama, a foundational Digambara scripture.\nThrough Virasena, Aryanandi indirectly influenced:\n* Jinasena I – author of the Adi Purana and co-author of the Mahapurana\n* Gunasena (Jinasena II)* – commentator on the Dhavala\n* Gunabhadra – co-author of the Uttarapurana\nWorks\nNo known texts are directly attributed to Aryanandi, which suggests that his teachings may have been transmitted orally. Nevertheless, his role as a teacher and transmitter of scriptural knowledge was critical to the continuation of the Jain doctrinal lineage.\nLegacy\nAryanandi holds a respected place within Digambara tradition as a silent pillar behind the resurgence of Jain philosophy in South India. His mentorship of Virasena ultimately contributed to some of the most significant Jain literary achievements of the 9th and 10th centuries CE.\nSee also\n* Dhavala\n* ⁠Adi Purana\n* ⁠Mahapurana\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n* Dundas, Paul.
