Part of it is a  nature reserve called Bonny Wood, which is owned and managed by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust.\nThese ancient woodlands have been documented since 1251. The canopy is mainly oak, ash and silver birch, and other trees include the rare wild pear. The flora is diverse, including herb paris, ramsons, sanicle and early purple orchid.\nSome areas are private land, but the nature reserve is open to the public, and a public footpath goes through Priestley Wood.\nReferences"
