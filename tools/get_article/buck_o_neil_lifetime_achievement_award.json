      "text": "# Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award\n\nThe '''Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award''' is an award presented by the National Baseball Hall of Fame not more than once every three years to honor an  individual who enhances baseball's positive image on society, who broadens the game's appeal, and whose integrity and dignity are comparable to the namesake of the award, John Jordan \"Buck\" O'Neil. There have been five recipients of the award since its inception in 2008.\nHistory\nIn 2008, the Hall of Fame dedicated a life-size bronze statue of O'Neil near the entrance of its museum. With the statue are a list of recipients of the award and a plaque that summarizes O'Neil's contributions to the game of baseball. A smaller statue is given to each honoree at the induction ceremony during Hall of Fame Weekend.\nAwardees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Year\n!
