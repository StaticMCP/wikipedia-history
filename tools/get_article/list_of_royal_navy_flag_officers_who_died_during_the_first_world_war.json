The three Royal Navy admirals killed in action in the war, Arbuthnot, Cradock, and Hood, are respectively nos. 5, 7, and 8 from the left.|thumb]]\nThe Royal Navy is the maritime arm of the British armed forces and is led by flag officers.  During the First World War these were considered to be officers who held the ranks of rear-admiral, vice-admiral, admiral, or admiral of the fleet. They typically commanded groups of sea-going vessels or held staff positions.\nThis list includes all officers who are listed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) as having died while serving during the First World War.  The list includes ten flag officers who died between Britain's entry into the war, 4 August 1914, and the armistice of 11 November 1918. Listed separately are six who died between the armistice and 31 August 1921 which was defined by an act of British parliament as the formal end of the war. Three flag officers were killed in action; one at the 1914 Battle of Coronel and two at the 1916 Battle of Jutland.\nRanks\nDuring the First World War the Royal Navy senior command consisted of flag officers  In the 1913 King's Regulations only the term \"flag officer\" was used and applied to all officers of the rank of rear admiral and above.|group=Note}} of the ranks (in ascending order of seniority): rear-admiral, vice-admiral, admiral and admiral of the fleet. Ranks could also be held in an honorary capacity, often by foreign royalty. In July 1914 there were 58 serving rear-admirals, 22 vice-admirals, 12 admirals (plus 2 honorary appointments), and 3 admirals of the fleet (plus the monarch George V and 3 honorary appointments).|group=Note}} These units were grouped into regional commands whose commander's rank varied depending on the importance of the region, but was usually a rear-admiral or vice-admiral. More senior officers held command of large sea-going forces such as the Grand Fleet.  Many admirals held staff positions on land rather than sea-going commands. The rank of admiral of the fleet was held for life and was granted to the most senior serving naval officers or as an honorary rank for prior service.\nUntil 1957 the Royal Navy maintained separate branches for its officers, distinguishing the military (executive) roles from others, such as engineering, which were considered \"civil\" roles. The Royal Navy's engineers had previously had unique rank titles but since reforms in 1903 engineer branch officers had held the same ranks as their executive colleagues, though prefaced with \"engineer\".  In July 1914 there was one serving engineer vice-admiral and two engineer rear-admirals.\nFirst World War service\nRoyal Navy admirals served on land and at sea during the war.  Three British admirals were killed in action: Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock at the Battle of Coronel in 1914 and Rear-Admirals Sir Horace Hood and Sir Robert Arbuthnot at the Battle of Jutland in 1916; more died during the war from illness and other causes.\nThe colonial navies (the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Canadian Navy) served in a combat capacity throughout the war, generally under the direction of the British Admiralty. The Royal Indian Marine began the war as a non-combatant force, though during the course of the conflict its vessels were armed and served on patrol and transport duties. The only non-Royal Navy admiral of the British Empire to die during the war was the Royal Australian Navy's director of naval auxiliary services, Rear-Admiral Frederick Tickell.\nPre-armistice\nThis list includes all officers noted by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) as holding flag officer rank who died between the British entry into the war on 4 August 1914 and the armistice of 11 November 1918. A large number of retired naval officers, including many admirals, volunteered for service during the war. Many accepted commissions at lower ranks in the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) and served in yachts and other small craft on coastal patrols. The CWGC list these officers at their full rank, even where they died whilst serving in the lower RNR rank.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|+ Officers who died between 4 August 1914 and 11 November 1918\n!scope=\"col\" |Image\n!scope=\"col\" |Rank\n!scope=\"col\" |Name\n!scope=\"col\" |Command\n!scope=\"col\" |Date of Death\n!scope=\"col\" |Place of Death\n!scope=\"col\" |Cause of Death\n!scope=\"col\" |Ref.\n|-\n|\n|Engineer Rear-Admiral\n! scope=\"row\"|William Thomas Hocken\n|Staff of the Engineer-in-Chief of the Fleet\n|28 August 1914\n|London, United Kingdom\n|Illness\n|\n|-\n|\n|Rear-Admiral\n! scope=\"row\"|Sir Christopher Cradock\n|4th Cruiser Squadron\n|1 November 1914\n|HMS Good Hope, Coronel\n|Killed in action\n|\n|-\n|\n|Rear-Admiral\n! scope=\"row\"|William John Grogan\n|Retired 1910; served from 1915 in the Royal Naval Reserve, captain commanding HMY Sapphire II\n|14 March 1915\n|Portsmouth, United Kingdom\n|Drowned\n|\n|-\n|\n|Rear-Admiral\n! scope=\"row\"|Sir Robert Arbuthnot\n|1st Cruiser Squadron\n|31 May 1916\n|HMS Defence, Jutland\n|Killed in action\n|\n|-\n|\n|Rear-Admiral\n! scope=\"row\"|Sir Horace Hood\n|3rd Battlecruiser Squadron\n|31 May 1916\n|HMS Invincible, Jutland\n|Killed in action\n|\n|-\n|\n|Vice-Admiral\n! scope=\"row\"|Sir George Warrender\n|Formerly Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth\n|8 January 1917\n|London, United Kingdom\n|Illness\n|\n|-\n|\n|Admiral\n! scope=\"row\"|Sir Frederick Hamilton\n|Commander-in-Chief, Rosyth\n|4 October 1917\n|Rosyth, United Kingdom\n|Illness\n|\n|-\n|\n|Vice-Admiral\n! scope=\"row\"|Frank Hannam Henderson\n|Retired 1905; served from 1917 commanding Atlantic convoys\n|26 June 1918\n|Royal Hospital Haslar, United Kingdom\n|Operation\n|\n|-\n|\n|Engineer Rear-Admiral\n! scope=\"row\"|Francis Henry Lister\n|Staff of the Commander-in-Chief, Coast of Ireland\n|20 August 1918\n|Queenstown, United Kingdom\n|Illness\n|\n|-\n|\n|Engineer Rear-Admiral\n! scope=\"row\"|Richard James Tench\n|Retired 1908; served as Engineer Technical Officer, Southampton\n|1 November 1918\n|Waterlooville, United Kingdom\n|\n|\n|}\nPost-armistice\nThe First World War is usually held to have ended with the armistice of 11 November 1918 though the peace treaties officially ending the war took some years to agree and sign. Under the Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act 1918 the end of the war was defined for general purposes by the British parliament as 31 August 1921. This is the same date that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission uses for its casualty records.
