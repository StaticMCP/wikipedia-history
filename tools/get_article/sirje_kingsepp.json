The story was originally published on 23 December 2004.  It was available via Eesti Päevaleht's web archive until December 2008 when she requested its withdrawal on grounds of it containing her personal data, particularly marital status, number of children, and location of birth, education, and residence.  Subsequently,  backed the request; Eesti Päevaleht complied but appealed to Tallinn Administrative Court.  In June 2009, the court upheld the request on grounds that public interest towards Kingsepp's person has ceased since she withdrew from active politics, and that her former party is a \"completely marginal\" organisation. Accordingly, the story was no longer available on Eesti Päevaleht's website. It could still be read in libraries that maintain archives of newspapers. From 19 August 2010 it is again available due to the ruling of the Supreme Court of Estonia.\nFurther reading\n* Eesti Päevaleht 2 January 2009: [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/453861 Andmekaitse: Kingseppa puudutav otsus ei sündinud kergelt], interview with Viljar Peep, director of Estonian Data Protection Inspection\n* Eesti Päevaleht 19 August 2010: [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/582039 Kohus: ajaleht ei pea varem ilmunud artiklit kustutama], about a new court order.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/472326 Kas uudishimu on sõnavabadus?] Eesti Päevaleht. 30 June 2009\n* Eesti Päevaleht 23 December 2004: [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/281322 Feminist ja sotsialist, aga mitte kommunist] by Tuuli Koch"
