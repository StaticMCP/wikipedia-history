This right was often not included in the original suffrage legislation of a state or country, resulting in both men and women campaigning to introduce legislation to enable women to vote. Actions included writing letters to newspapers and legislators, compiling petitions, holding marches and rallies and carrying out acts of violence. Women were on occasion arrested for these actions and held in jail, during which time some went on hunger strikes,  refusing to eat for the duration of their incarceration.\nMonuments and memorials to women's suffrage have been constructed around the world in recognition of the bravery and strength of the women who campaigned for voting rights, and the achievement of having the legislation passed.\nAustralia\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Location\n!Year\n!Notes\n|-\n|Statue of Emma Miller\n|Brisbane\n|1993\n|Commemorates the contribution of a leading suffragist\n|-\n|''Centenary of Western Australian Women's Suffrage Memorial''\n|Perth\n|1998\n|Marks the centenary of women's suffrage in Western Australia\n|-\n|''Centenary of Women's Suffrage mural''\n|Lake Grace\n|1998\n|Marks the centenary of women's suffrage in Western Australia\n|-\n|Centenary of Women's Suffrage Gazebo\n|Kondinin\n|1999\n|Marks the centenary of women's suffrage in Western Australia\n|-\n|''Centenary of Women's Suffrage Commemorative Fountain''\n|Canberra\n|2003\n|Marks the centenary of women's suffrage in Australia\n|-\n|Resilience sculpture\n|Brisbane\n|2007\n|Marks the centenary of women's suffrage in Queensland\n|-\n|Great Petition sculpture\n|Melbourne\n|2008\n|Marks the centenary of women's suffrage in Victoria\n|}\nCanada\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Location\n!Year\n!Notes\n|-\n|\"Women are Persons!\"\n|Ottawa\n|2000\n|Commemorates the five suffragists who filed and won the Persons Case, enabling women to be appointed to the Senate of Canada\n|-\n|Monument to the Suffragettes\n|Quebec City\n|2012\n|Commemorates the three suffragists who campaigned for women's suffrage in Quebec\n|}\nNew Zealand\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Location\n!Year\n!Notes\n|-\n|New Lynn Suffrage Memorial Mural\n|Auckland\n|1993 (later damaged)\n2012 (replacement)\n|Marks the centenary of women's suffrage in New Zealand\n|-\n|Mural at Khartoum Place\n|Auckland\n|1993\n|Commemorates Auckland suffragists\n|-\n|Kate Sheppard National Memorial\n|Christchurch\n|1993\n|Commemorates the lives of New Zealand's leading suffragists\n|-\n|''Puketapapa Women's Suffrage Memorial''\n|Auckland\n|2013\n|Commemorates the local women suffragists of the community\n|}\nUnited Kingdom\nto the left, Mary Blathwayt at centre and Emmeline Pankhurst, with the spade, at Eagle House in 1910]]\n, Victoria Tower Gardens]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Location\n!Year\n!Artist\n!Notes\n|-\n|-\n|Annie's Arboretum\n|Eagle House, Batheaston\n|1909–1913 (destroyed in the 1960s)\n|Emily and Colonel Linley Blathwayt\n|Commemorated c. 60 suffragists and suffragettes\n|-\n|The Suffrage Oak\n|Glasgow\n|1918\n|Scottish suffragists\n|Oak tree planted to mark the passing of the Representation of the People Act 1918.\n|-\n|Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst Memorial\n|London\n|1930\n|Arthur George Walker\n|Commemorates the lives of two leading suffragists\n|-\n|Suffragette Memorial\n|London\n|1970\n|Lorne McKean and Edwin Russell with Paul Paget\n|Commemorates the bravery of the suffragists\n|-\n|The Pankhurst Parlour\n|Manchester\n|1987\n|\n|Historical site and memorial\n|-\n|Sylvia Pankhurst (artwork)\n|London\n|2011\n|\n|Commemorates the contribution of a leading suffragist\n|-\n|Alice Hawkins (statue)\n|Leicester\n|2018\n|Sean Hedges-Quinn\n|Commemorates the life of a leading local suffragist\n|-\n|Millicent Fawcett (statue)\n|London\n|2018\n|Gillian Wearing\n|Commemorates the contribution of a leading suffragist\n|-\n|Emily Wilding Davison (statue)\n|Morpeth\n|2018\n|Ray Lonsdale\n|A welded steel statue portraying the suffragette tipping over a bowl of food, in reference to her hunger strike\n|-\n|Rise up, Women (Emmeline Pankhurst statue)\n|Manchester\n|2018\n|Hazel Reeves\n|Commemorates the suffragettes' leader in the city of her birth\n|-\n|Annie Kenney (statue)\n|Oldham\n|2018\n|Denise Dutton\n|Commemorates the only working-class woman to hold a senior position in the suffragette movement\n|-\n|Bessie Watson (memorial plaque)\n|Edinburgh\n|2019\n|\n|Commemorates the youngest Scottish girl (age 9) in the suffragette movement\n|}\nUnited States\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Location\n!Year\n!Notes\n|-\n|Portrait Monument to Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B.
