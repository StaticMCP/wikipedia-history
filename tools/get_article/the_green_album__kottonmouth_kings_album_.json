AllMusic reviewer David Jeffries wrote that \"If you haven't figured it out from the album's title, the song titles, or even the band's name, The Green Album is a pro-weed album from aging cottage industry insiders known as the Kottonmouth Kings. [...] [The album] finds them a bit more out of touch with what's happening in the rest of the music world\".\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Kottonmouth Kings\n*Brad \"Daddy X\" Xavier – vocals, producer, executive producer, liner notes\n*Dustin \"D-Loc\" Miller – vocals\n*Timothy \"Johnny Richter\" McNutt – vocals\n*Luiz \"Lou Dog\" Gaez – drums\n*Robert \"DJ Bobby B\" Adams – turntables\n*Patrick \"Pakelika\" Cochrun – performer\n;Guest musicians\n*BJ Smith – vocals (tracks: 2, 4, 8, 14, 15)\n*Ryan Fatal – guitar (tracks: 5, 9, 11, 13)\n*Eddie Tatar – guitar & bass (tracks: 12, 17)\n*Joey Tatar – drums (tracks: 12, 17)\n*Sky Blue Xavier – vocals (track 12)\n*Jason \"Brother J\" Hunter – vocals (track 13)\n*Aaron \"Tech N9NE\" Yates – vocals (track 15)\n*David \"The Dirtball\" Alexander – vocals (track 18)\n*Aaron \"El Hefe\" Abeyta – guitar (track 20)\n*Cornelius Van Sprang – keyboards (track 20)\n*P.
