Ron Paul made only a few stops in the state, including Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne a day before the primary.\nResults\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|Key: || align=\"center\" bgcolor=#FFE8E8| Withdrewprior to contest\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:right;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2008 Indiana Republican presidential primary100% of districts reporting\n|-\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Delegates\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | John McCain\n| 320,318\n| 77.62%\n| 27\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFE8E8\"\n| align=\"left\" | Mike Huckabee\n| 41,173\n| 9.98%\n| 0\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Ron Paul\n| 31,612\n| 7.66%\n| 0\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFE8E8\"\n| align=\"left\" | Mitt Romney\n| 19,581\n| 4.74%\n| 0\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" style=\"margin-right:0.5em\"\n| Totals\n| 412,684\n| 100%\n| 27\n|}\nSee also\n* 2008 Indiana Democratic presidential primary\n* 2008 Republican Party presidential primaries\nReferences"
