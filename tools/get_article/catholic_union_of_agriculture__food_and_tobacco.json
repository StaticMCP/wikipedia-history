Like all its predecessors, it affiliated to the Dutch Catholic Trade Union Federation.  In 1976, it formed a federation with the rival Industrial Union of Agriculture and Food (ABVG).\nBy 1980, the union had 18,775 members, of whom, 72% worked in food production, 15% in agriculture, and 13% in catering.  Later in the year, it merged with the ABVG, to form the Food Workers' Union.\nReferences"
