It was designed by W.&nbsp;Roberts, and built in 1867 for J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Rowley.  It is a large house in the Italianate style, constructed of red brick and Alderley Edge stone.  On its front is a tower porch set on the skew.\nThe house serves as the residence of former footballer Ashley Ward and his wife, Dawn Ward, who appeared on The Real Housewives of Cheshire, a reality television series. The Wards have been seeking to develop the property, and they submitted plans in July 2021 to convert some outbuildings into six dwelling units.\nReferences"
