Murrow Awards were presented by the Radio-Television News Directors Association (RTNDA), now renamed the Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) in recognition of what the association terms \"outstanding achievements in electronic journalism.\"  National winners were selected from a pool of regional award winners.  Below are the 1997 national and regional award winners, which recognizes coverage that aired during the previous 1996 calendar year.\nCategories that are not listed either had no entrants or the entries received were not deemed worthy of the award.  For regional awards, it is worth noting the states included in each region have changed through the years.  The lists below indicate which states are included in each region for the 1997 awards. The category currently called Breaking News was called \"Spot News Coverage\" in 1997, so the lists below have been edited to read Breaking/Spot News to avoid any confusion.\nThe information on this page was retrieved using the Archive.org Internet Wayback Machine to access the now defunct website for RTNDA, a domain that was abandoned when the organization was renamed RTDNA.\n1997 National Edward R.
