A language isolate, it is spoken by about 33,000 people primarily in northern Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname. It is notable for its unusual object–subject–verb word order. The 2015 Venezuelan film Gone with the River was spoken in Warao.\nClassification\nWarao appears to be a language isolate, unrelated to any recorded language in the region or elsewhere. Terrence Kaufman (1994) included it in his hypothetical Macro-Paezan family, but the necessary supporting work was never done. Julian Granberry connected many of the grammatical forms, including nominal and verbal suffixes, of Warao to the Timucua language of North Florida, also a language isolate. However, he has also derived Timucua morphemes from Muskogean, Chibchan, Paezan, Arawakan, and other Amazonian languages, suggesting multi-language creolization as a possible explanation for these similarities.\nWaroid hypothesis\nGranberry noted \"Waroid\" vocabulary items in Taíno, such as  or  [nosái]  in the Ciboney dialect (cf. Warao   ) and   in Classic Taíno (cf. Warao  ).\nHe also finds such similarities with Guajiro; from toponymic evidence it seems that the Warao or a related people once occupied Goajiro country. Granberry & Vescelius (2004) note that toponymic evidence suggests that the pre-Taino Macorix language of Hispaniola and the Guanahatabey language of Cuba may have been Waroid languages as well.\nLanguage contact\nJolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Cariban, Arutani, Máku, and Sape language families due to contact within an earlier Guiana Highlands interaction sphere.\nGeographical distribution\nThe language had an estimated 28,100 speakers in Venezuela as of 2007. The Warao people live chiefly in the  Orinoco Delta region of northeastern Venezuela, with smaller communities in southwestern Trinidad (Trinidad and Tobago), western Guyana and Suriname. The language is considered endangered by UNESCO.\nVarieties\nHistorical sources mention ethnic groups in the Orinoco Delta such as Siawani (Chaguanes), Veriotaus (Farautes), and Tiuitiuas (Tibitíbis) that spoke Warao or languages closely related to modern Warao. Other extinct groups include:\n*Aricari and Pirao from Cayenne\n*Guaiqueri from Margarita Island\nLoukotka (1968) lists the following varieties:\n*Guanoco – spoken on the Laguna de Asfalto, state of Monagas (unattested)\n*Chaguan – spoken in the Orinoco Delta on the Manamo branch (unattested)\n*Mariusa – spoken in the same region on the Cocuina and Macareo branches\nMason (1950) lists:\n*Waikeri (Guaiqueri)\n*Chaguan\n*Mariusa\nPhonology\nThe Warao consonant inventory is small, but not quite as small as many other South American inventories.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Labial\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Alveolar\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Palatal\n! colspan=\"2\" |Velar\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Glottal\n|- class=\"small\"\n!plain\n!labialized\n|-\n!Plosive\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Fricative\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Nasal\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Tap\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Approximant\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nThe labial plosive  is usually realized as voiced .  has an allophone  word-initially and  when between  and .\nThere are five oral vowels  and five nasal vowels .
