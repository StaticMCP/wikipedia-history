The Kiribati Court of Appeal ruled that the single day in office constituted a third term, barring him from standing in further elections in accordance with the constitution.\nThe result was a victory for Anote Tong, who defeated his brother Harry Tong by just under 4%.\nResults\nNotes\nReferences"
