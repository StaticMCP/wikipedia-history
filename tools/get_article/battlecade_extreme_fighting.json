Although few events were held, a number of well known fighters competed for the promotion. Battlecade CEO Rick Blume is credited with coining the phrase mixed martial arts and the promotion was the first to implement weight classes in MMA.\nDespite the number of fighters which the promotion was able to attract, Battlecade struggled financially and had trouble with authorities over the sanctioning of MMA bouts. Following the fourth and final Extreme Fighting event, General Media International, Battlecade sponsor and publisher of Penthouse, withdrew their financial support of the promotion. Additionally, cable television providers Tele-Communications Inc. and Request TV refused to air further Extreme Fighting events.\nHistory\nExtreme Fighting 1\nThe first Extreme Fighting event was planned to be held in Brooklyn, New York on November 18, 1995. Pressure from state politicians forced the event to be moved to Wilmington, North Carolina on a single day's notice. This event featured a four-man heavyweight tournament which was won by eventual American Top Team co-founder Marcus Silveira. Silveira defeated Victor Tatarkin of Russia by submission via strikes in the semi-finals of the tournament, moving on to defeat Gary Myers via guillotine choke in the finals. With his victory over Myers, Silveira became the Extreme Fighting Heavyweight Champion.\nThis event also featured a four-man middleweight tournament, showcasing judoka Igor Zinoviev and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner Mario Sperry. Zinoviev defeated his first opponent, Harold German, an accomplished but notably outweighed New York-based boxer, by submission via strikes. Sperry won by the same means against his opponent, UFC 6 competitor Rudyard Moncayo. Zinoviev defeated Sperry in the finals by technical knockout to become Extreme Fighting Middleweight Champion.\nIn addition to the two tournaments held that night, the event featured Ralph Gracie and a bout between Carlson Gracie Jr. and John Lewis which ended in a draw after twenty minutes.\nExtreme Fighting 2\nOn April 26, 1996, a second Extreme Fighting event was held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Marcus Silveira and Igor Zinoviev were victorious in separate bouts. An eighteen-year-old Carlos Newton, who would go on to become a champion in the UFC, made his professional debut that night, fighting eventual K-1 USA Grand Prix '98 competitor, and a man almost twice his size, in Jean Riviere. Newton lost the bout via submission by a small package(when an opponent is on their back with their legs being smashed atop of them).\nRalph Gracie returned to action and was declared Extreme Fighting Lightweight Champion after defeating Steve Nelson via submission in the first round of their bout.\nDespite arrangements made with the Kahnawake tribal council for the event to be held, Montreal authorities arrested a number of the evening's competitors, the referee, announcer, and Battlecade's matchmaker following the event.\nExtreme Fighting 3\nTulsa, Oklahoma hosted the third Extreme Fighting event on the night of October 18, 1996. In one of the most recognized bouts from the short-lived promotion, kickboxer and eventual UFC Heavyweight Champion Maurice Smith defeated Marcus Silveira via technical knockout to become the new Extreme Fighting Heavyweight Champion.\nMatt Hume and Erik Paulson, who both went on to become well known trainers after their fighting careers ended, battled until Paulson suffered a cut in the third round of their bout.\nIgor Zinoviev retained his middleweight championship after fighting to a draw with John Lober. A bout between John Lewis and Vale Tudo fighter Johil de Oliveira also ended in a draw.\nRalph Gracie submitted Ali Mihoubi via armbar to retain his lightweight championship. Eventual Pride competitor Kazunari Murakami defeated Bart Vale via technical knockout, while Anthony Macias submitted to the strikes of Allan Goes. Angolan fighter João Roque - who went on to compete in the UFC, DEEP, and Shooto - defeated Abdelaziz Cherigui via armbar.\nExtreme Fighting 4\nThe final Extreme Fighting event was held in Des Moines, Iowa on March 28, 1997. Kevin Jackson, Olympic gold medalist freestyle wrestler and winner of the UFC 14 middleweight tournament, defeated John Lober via arm triangle choke. In what was his lone professional MMA bout, Kenny Monday, another Olympic gold medalist in freestyle wrestling, defeated John Lewis via technical knockout.\nMatt Hume proved victorious against Miletich Fighting Systems founder Pat Miletich, who suffered a fight-ending broken nose. Allan Goes defeated Todd Bjornethun via triangle choke, while Erik Paulson fought Paul Jones to a draw.\nFinally, Maurice Smith defended his heavyweight title against Kazunari Murakami. Their bout ended decisively, as Smith knocked Murakami out in the first round.\nNeither the middleweight or lightweight titles were defended on the final Extreme Fighting card, as champions Igor Zinoviev and Ralph Gracie did not appear. Zinoviev was unable to compete because of a separated shoulder. Gracie's scheduled opponent, Luta Livre fighter Eugenio Tadeu, was unable to attend the event and Battlecade could not find a replacement in time.\nExtreme Fighting Champions\nHeavyweight Championship\n:Weight limit: Unlimited\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"99%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!width=1%|No.\n!width=19%|Name\n!width=15%|Date\n!width=20%|Location\n!width=45%|Defenses\n|-\n|align=center |1\n|align=\"left\"| Marcus Silveira\n|November 18, 1995\n|Wilmington, North Carolina, US\n|align=\"left\"|\n*\n|-\n|align=center |2\n|align=\"left\"| Maurice Smith\n|October 18, 1996\n|Tulsa, Oklahoma, US\n|align=\"left\"|\n*\n|}\nMiddleweight Championship\n:Weight limit:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"99%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!width=1%|No.\n!width=19%|Name\n!width=15%|Date\n!width=20%|Location\n!width=45%|Defenses\n|-\n|align=center |1\n|align=\"left\"| Igor Zinoviev\n|November 18, 1995\n|Wilmington, North Carolina, US\n|align=\"left\"|\n*\n*\n|}\nLightweight Championship\n:Weight limit:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"99%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!width=1%|No.\n!width=19%|Name\n!width=15%|Date\n!width=20%|Location\n!width=45%|Defenses\n|-\n|align=center |1\n|align=\"left\"| Ralph Gracie\n|April 26, 1996\n|Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n|align=\"left\"|\n*\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Extreme-Fighting-11 Battlecade: Extreme Fighting events listed at Sherdog]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708103959/http://www.budovideos.com/shop/customer/product.php?productid=18027 Extreme Fighting 1-4 DVD set at BudoVideos.com]"
