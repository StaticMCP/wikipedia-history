The awards ceremony was presented by the Canadian Comedy Foundation for Excellence (CCFE), and was held on 6&nbsp;April 2000 at the Masonic Temple in Toronto, Ontario.  The ceremony was hosted by Dave Thomas.  A one-hour version of the ceremony was broadcast late the following night on CTV, and the full program aired on The Comedy Network on 9&nbsp;April at 9&nbsp;pm.\nCanadian Comedy Awards, also known as Beavers, were awarded in 23 categories. Winners were selected by members of ACTRA (Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists), the Canadian Actors' Equity Association, the Writers Guild of Canada, and the Directors Guild of Canada. It was one of the first award presentations to use online voting. The ceremony also marked the creation of the Canadian Comedy Hall of Fame and the induction of its first honourees.\nThe Drowsy Chaperone and the CBC comedy Made in Canada led the way with six nominations each, followed by Double Exposure, Last Night, and This Hour Has 22 Minutes with five.  The big winners were This Hour Has 22 Minutes which won four awards in television, The Drowsy Chaperone which took three awards in live comedy, and Mike Myers who won three in film. Don McKellar won two awards across disciplines: best film director for Last Night and best playwright (together with colleagues Bob Martin, Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison) for The Drowsy Chaperone.\nCeremony\n]]\nThe inaugural Canadian Comedy Awards ceremony was held on 6&nbsp;April 2000 in Toronto, Ontario. The venue was the historic Masonic Temple, home of CTV-affiliate The Comedy Network. The ceremony was hosted by Dave Thomas, a comedic veteran of more than 20 films and 300 sitcom episodes. Thomas is best known for the character Doug McKenzie, a parody of all things Canadian, and the ceremony played on similar humour by serving guests back bacon on a bun and poutine.\nAwards\nThe Beaver was awarded in twenty-three categories recognizing work in live performances, film and television.
