Services on the Nishi-Tawaramoto - Sakurai section ceased in 1944 as a war-time austerity measure, with the section formally closing in 1958. The right-of-way for this section was subsequently converted to a road, as Nara Prefectural Route 14.\nThe Shin-Oji - Nishi-Tawaramoto section was regauged to 1435mm and electrified at 600 VDC in 1948, and the company merged with Kintetsu in 1964. The line voltage was increased to 1500 VDC in 1969.\nStations\n{| class=\"wikitable\" ruls=\"all\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom:solid 2px #;\"\n!No.\n!Station\n!Distance(km)\n!Connections\n!colspan=\"2\"|Location\n|-\n|\n|西田原本\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|0.0\n|  (B36: )\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Tawaramoto, Shiki\n|rowspan=\"8\"|Nara\n|-\n|\n|黒田\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|2.0\n|\n|-\n|\n|但馬\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|3.0\n|\n|Miyake, Shiki\n|-\n|\n|箸尾\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|4.5\n|\n|Kōryō, Kitakatsuragi\n|-\n|\n|池部\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|6.1\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Kawai, Kitakatsuragi\n|-\n|\n|佐味田川\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|7.1\n|\n|-\n|\n|大輪田\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|8.2\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n|\n|新王寺\n|style=\"text-align:right;\"|10.1\n|  (G28: )\n*  (JR-Q31: Ōji)\n*  (Ōji)\n}}\n|Ōji, Kitakatsuragi\n|}"
