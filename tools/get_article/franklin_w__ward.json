His awards included the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Honor (Officer) (France), Croix de Guerre with palm (Belgium), Order of Polonia Restituta (Commander), Order of the Crown of Romania (Grand Officer), and New York State Conspicuous Service Medal.\nEarly life\nFranklin Wilmer Ward was born in Philadelphia on 4 December 1870, a son of Thomas Patrick Ward, a Confederate States Army veteran who later managed hotels in Pennsylvania and New York, and Sarah (Stoy) Ward. Ward was educated in Philadelphia and attended the Horace Binney School. In May 1888, he joined the Pennsylvania National Guard as a private. He steadily advanced through the ranks of his Philadelphia-based unit, and was promoted to corporal in 1889, sergeant in 1892, and first sergeant in 1893.\nIn 1897, Ward moved to Manhattan, where he joined the New York National Guard. In January 1898, he married Mabel Loretta Downs of Manhattan. They were the parents of a son, John Franklin Downs.\nStart of career\nIn August 1898, Ward volunteered for Spanish–American War service and successfully applied for a second lieutenant's commission in the 109th New York Infantry Regiment, a unit that was raised to perform state duties while other National Guard units were mobilized for federal service. In January 1899, he was assigned to the 9th Infantry Regiment, and later that year he received promotion to first lieutenant.\nIn 1901, Ward commanded a company during the National Guard's response to a streetcar worker's strike in Albany. In 1902, Ward was promoted to captain, and in 1907 he received promotion to major. In 1908, the 9th Infantry was transferred to the Coast Artillery Corps; Ward became an authority on Coast Artillery, which resulted in his appointment as a member of the state examining board for Coast Artillery officers.\nIn 1912, Ward was appointed to the staff of the 27th Division and promoted to lieutenant colonel. The division was activated for federal service in 1916 as part of the US response during the Mexican Border War. Ward was sent to Texas in advance of the division's main body, and planned and organized administrative and logistics details including bivouac sites and food and water. During the division's border service, Ward was assigned as assistant chief of staff. One Ward initiative while in Texas was organizing a weekly newspaper, The Rio Grande Rattler, and he became its managing editor. The paper was published in Mission, Texas, and by using professional journalists assigned to the division to produce high-quality stories, the Rattler developed a large subscriber base both in the Lower Rio Grande Valley and in New York state.\nContinued career\nWhen the 27th Division was ordered to federal service for World War I, Ward as assigned as its adjutant and acting chief of staff during organization and training at Camp Wadsworth, South Carolina.

The 27th Division was then withdrawn from the front and assigned to a rear area base for reorganization and re-equipping, and it remained there until the Armistice of November 11, 1918 ended the war. After the war, Ward remained in Europe as part of the Occupation of the Rhineland, and he returned to the United States in April 1919.\nUpon returning to New York, Ward was appointed chief of staff of the New York National Guard. In early 1920, he was designated for assignment as one of the first National Guard officers to serve on the War Department General Staff, where he took part in reorganizing the Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve Corps under the National Defense Act of 1920.
