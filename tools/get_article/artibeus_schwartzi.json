It was previously considered a subspecies of the Jamaican fruit bat, (A. jamaicensis). It has been hypothesized that it arose from hybridization of three Artibeus species: A. jamaicensis, A. planirostris, and an unknown third species.\nTaxonomy and etymology\nA. schwartzi was described as a new subspecies of the Jamaican fruit bat in 1978.\nIn 2007, however, Larsen et al. determined that A. schwartzi should be recognized as a full species based on genetic data.\nThe eponym for the species name \"schwartzi''\" is in honour of American biologist Albert Schwartz.\nBiology and ecology\nIt is likely frugivorous.\nRange and habitat\nIt is endemic to the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean Sea.\nIts range includes Barbados, Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago.\nIt has been documented at elevations up to  above sea level.\nConservation\nAs of 2016, it is assessed as a data deficient species by the IUCN.\nVery little is known about this species, and its population size and trend are unknown.\nReferences"
