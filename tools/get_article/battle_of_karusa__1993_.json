The battle ended in an ARBiH victory.\nBackground\nIn 1992 the VRS captured Doboj, since then the VRS had attempted several times to capture areas of South and East Doboj from the ARBiH. Their main plan was to connect Teslić and Doboj through Tešanj, but the ARBiH showed heavy resistance.\nOffensive\nOn 18 March or 19 March 1993, the VRS began the attack under code-name Operation Last chance. The plan was to capture Karuše, advance into Tešanj and connect with Teslić. They Attacked the ARBiH with dozens of troops, 10 Tanks, 5 transporters and several artillery strikes. On 19 March 1993 the VRS had allegedly used captured civilians as Human shields. They also attacked other places such as Matuzići, Mravići, Kraševo and Lepenica. They attempted to even capture a Hotel called \"Ušće\" but failed. In Karuša the main battle started when the VRS launched several attacks on the 203rd South Doboj brigade of ARBiH. In this place, the ARBiH destroyed most of the VRS tanks and transporters. The Operation ended on 22 March 1993 after the VRS suffered heavy losses.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/-groblje-tenkova-u-doboju-podsjetnik-na-jednu-od-najvecih-tenkovskih-ofanziva/140405035 \"Groblje tenkova\" u Doboju: Podsjetnik na jednu od najvećih tenkovskih ofanziva]\n* [https://miruhbosne.com/bitka-na-karusama-herojska-odbrana-i-groblje-neprijateljskih-tenkova/ Bitka na Karušama: Herojska odbrana i groblje neprijateljskih tenkova]\n* [https://zenicainfo.ba/2025/03/24/ministar-sirovica-o-godisnjici-bitke-na-karusama-svijet-je-mogao-da-vidi-kako-se-srcem-brani-ono-sto-se-voli/ Ministar Sirovica o godišnjici bitke na Karušama: Svijet je mogao da vidi kako se srcem brani ono što se voli]\n* [https://www.bhstring.net/tuzlauslikama/tuzlarije/viewnewnews.php?id=115266 Promocija knjige “Bitka na Karušama, bosanski Bedr mart 1993.”]"
