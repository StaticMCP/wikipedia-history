The couple then moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where they stayed until their return to the West Coast in 2011 to live in Los Angeles. Currently they are based in Amsterdam.\nPeaking Lights' music has been described as psychedelic pop. The band formed in 2008, performing live in order to fund a road trip to Texas, at which point they self-released the CD-R Clearvoiant (later released on cassette via Night People).\nThe couple's son Mikko contributed vocals to their third album, Lucifer. In 2013 their second son Marlon was born.\nThey were among the \"friends\" that contributed in 2013 to The Flaming Lips The Time Has Come To Shoot You Down…What A Sound, a reworking of the Stone Roses' debut album.\nIn 2019 Peaking Lights collaborated with Lee \"Scratch\" Perry on a 12-inch Life of the Plants, released under Perry's name on Stones Throw Records.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n*Imaginary Falcons (2009, Night People)\n*936 (2011, Weird World / Not Not Fun)\n*Lucifer (2012, Mexican Summer / Weird World)\n*Cosmic Logic (2014, Weird World)\n*The Fifth State of Consciousness (2017, Two Flowers)\n*E S C A P E (2020, Dekmantel)\nEPs\n*Space Primitive (2010, Night People)\n*Lucifer in Dub (2012, Weird World / Mexican Summer)\nSingles\n* \"Space Primitive\" (12\", S/Sided, EP, Cle) [2010]\n* \"All The Sun That Shines\" (2011)\n* \"Low Hi\" (2012)\n* \"Beautiful Son\" (2012)\n* \"More High\" (7\", Single, Ltd) [2014]\n* \"Breakdown\" (2014)\n* \"Everyone And Us\" (2014)\n* \"Conga Blue\" (2016)\nReferences"
