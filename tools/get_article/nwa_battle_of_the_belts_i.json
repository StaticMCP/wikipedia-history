He praised the two out of three falls match as \"great\" but recommended to \"find it on a compilation or something rather than sitting through the undercard of this show.\"\nAccording to Arnold Furious, the event \"was not only a sad show to watch but one of the worst shows\". He considered it the worst wrestling show in 1985. He praised the main event between Flair and McDaniel. He praised Flair \"for getting something this decent out of a very long Wahoo match. 45 minutes of gruelling action.\" He recommended it as \"clearly the best match on the show.\" He also had some praise for the AWA World Tag Team Championship match, considering it the best match on the undercard.\nDave Meltzer rated the main event between Flair and McDaniel 3.5 out of 5, while the opening two matches received ratings of 3.25.\nAftermath\nKendall Windham continued his rivalry with Jack Hart over the Florida Heavyweight Championship, leading to a rematch between the two on October 2, where Windham retained the title.\nRick Rude continued his rivalry with Billy Jack Haynes as Rude teamed with different partners like Rip Oliver and Buddy Rose, attempting to win the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship from Haynes and Wahoo McDaniel, but failed in each attempt.

McDaniel eventually won the title by defeating Rude on October 2.\n|stip1=Tag team match\n|match1=Chavo Guerrero and Hector Guerrero defeated Rip Oliver and The Grappler\n|time1=15:40\n|stip2=Singles match\n|match2=Coco Samoa (with Lady Maxine) defeated Rip Rogers (with Miss Brenda)\n|time2=10:49\n|stip3=Singles match for the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship\n|match3=Kendall Windham defeated Jack Hart (c) (with Percy Pringle III)\n|time3=11:16\n|stip4=Singles match for the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship\n|match4=Rick Rude (c) (with Percy Pringle III) defeated Billy Jack Haynes\n|time4=14:16\n|stip5=Tag team match for the AWA World Tag Team Championship\n|match5=The Road Warriors (Animal and Hawk) (c) (with Paul Ellering) vs. Harley Race and Stan Hansen ended in a double count-out\n|time5=9:25\n|stip6=Singles match\n|match6=Nick Bockwinkel defeated Frankie Lane\n|time6=3:54\n|stip7=Two out of three falls match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship\n|match7=Ric Flair (c) defeated Wahoo McDaniel (2-1)\n|time7=44:53\n}}\nSee also\n*1985 in professional wrestling\nReferences"
