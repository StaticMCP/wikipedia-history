The same provision applies to calls for sanctions against Russia. This law effectively criminalizes any public opposition to or independent news reporting about the war against Ukraine and could make it a crime to simply call the war a \"war\" — the Kremlin says it is a \"special military operation\" — on social media or in a news article or broadcast.

There are many videos on social networks in which police officers are seen beating anti-war protesters.\" An audio recording from a protester arrested that weekend who managed to conceal her phone while detained and interrogated by multiple police documented 11 minutes of physical and verbal abuse, with one officer telling her that \"You are the enemies of Russia.

Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, stated that \"now is not the time to be divided. Now is the time to unite, to unite around our president,\" while acknowledging that \"there are heated debates among cultural figures.\" Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of Russian state-controlled news agencies RT and Rossiya Segodnya, stated that \"If you are ashamed of being Russian now, don't worry, you are not Russian.\" In response to Simonyan's statement, Vitalik Buterin, programmer and one of the co-founders of Ethereum, said, \"Go fuck yourself.\" Andrey Turchak, a lawmaker from Putin's United Russia party, condemn Arkady Dvorkovich's anti-war stance as \"nothing but the very national betrayal, the behaviour of the fifth column, which the president [Putin] spoke about...\". Chairman of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin denounced Russians who oppose the war as \"traitors\".\nOn 16 March 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a warning to Russian \"traitors\" who he said the West wanted to use as a \"fifth column\" to destroy Russia. He said that Russians should undergo \"natural and necessary self-cleansing of society\" to rid themselves of \"bastards\" and pro-Western \"traitors.\"\nRussian authorities encouraged Russians to report their friends, colleagues and family members to the police for expressing opposition to the war in Ukraine.\nExodus of Russians\nSince the beginning of the invasion, more than 300,000 Russians have fled the country, particularly citizens who are opposed to the war, in response to increasing repression and rumours of conscription and martial law. Journalist Boris Grozovski published a Facebook post saying that \"We are not tourists, dear citizens of Georgia. We are refugees. Personally, I was wanted by the police in Russia for distributing anti-war petitions... We ran not from bullets, bombs and missiles, but from prison. If I wrote what I write now while in Russia, I would inevitably go to prison for 15–20 years.\" Others have fled the country due to concerns about deteriorating conditions within the country, specifically in economical and political terms, coupled with anti-war sentiments and being targeted for past opposition movements. Bolshoi Theater ballerina Olga Smirnova left Russia to continue her career in the Netherlands in protest of the war.\nBy early April, an estimated 100,000 Russians had fled Russia to Georgia. After three weeks of war, around 14,000 were said to have left for Turkey. Tens of thousands went to Armenia; by 24 May an estimated 108,000 Russian citizens having fled to the country, or Nordic states such as Finland. Thousands are said to have gone to Uzbekistan.\nOpinion polls\nA state-run poll published on 28 February by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center claimed that 68% of Russians supported the \"special military operation\", 22% opposed, and 10% found it difficult to answer.\nLater on, a series of four online polls by Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation claimed to show sentiment rapidly shifting among Moscow residents. Between 25 February and 3 March, those blaming Russia for the war increased from 14% to 36%, with 79% now in favour of stopping the conflict and engaging in peace negotiation. The proportion of respondents who considered Russia an \"aggressor\" increased from 29% to 53%, while the share of those considering Russia a \"peace-maker\" fell by half from 25% to 12%.\nFrom 26 to 28 February 2022, a survey conducted by the independent research group Russian Field found that 58.8% of respondents supported the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. According to the poll, in the group of 18-to-24-year-olds, only 29% supported the \"special military operation\".\nA poll by the independent Levada Center published on 30 March saw Putin's approval rating jump from 71% in February to 83% in March.\nExperts have warned that the figures may not accurately reflect the public mood, as the public tends to rally around leaders during war and some may be hiding their true opinions, especially with enhanced censorship and a new law prohibiting the dissemination of \"fake information\" about the military. A study by researchers affiliated with the London School of Economics found that stated support for the war among Russians dropped from 68% to 53% when asked indirectly about the invasion in polls. Many respondents do not want to answer pollsters' questions for fear of negative consequences. In March 2022, when a Russian opposition politician Maxim Katz and a group of Russian researchers commissioned a poll on Russians' attitudes toward the war in Ukraine, 29,400 of the 31,000 people they called refused to answer after hearing the subject matter in question.\nAnalysis\nStatus of the Russian opposition\nAlvina Hoffmann of King's College London said that the \"seemingly broad anti-war coalition is remarkable, given that the \"Russian political apparatus has been systematically dismantling opposition movements, creating a climate where any form of protest is met with oppression.\" Russian journalist Alexander Bidin, writing for openDemocracy, stated that \"Russian society lacks institutions that are capable of taking up the organisation of protests, especially at short notice\" and that \"for the majority, going out into the streets is a moral duty and a symbolic act, rather than a functional instrument of resistance to the authorities.\" Sasha de Vogel of New York University has argued that anti-war protests \"are more visible to audiences in the West than to the Russian public at large\" and that the protests \"have no coordinating body. Many have been planned through personal networks and social media posts. In some cases, opponents of the war have simply travelled to their nearest city centre in the hope of finding like-minded citizens. Many protests are single-person pickets.\"\nRisks of protesting\nMaria Popova of McGill University stated that \"you're not only taking a risk by showing up to a protest, you're taking a risk of being put on a list and being systematically harassed by authorities for having taken part in a protest,\" further saying that the levels of repression in Russia were \"way worse than they have been at any point since Stalinist time.\" One protester interviewed by NPR stated that the anti-war protests \"seem more dangerous\" than previous protest movements in Russia under Putin and that some protesters \"really did not realize that it is possible to just have a poster that says 'No to war' and end up at the police station. They really did not think that this was possible in our country.\"\nGrigory Durnovo, analyst for Russian NGO OVD-Info, told France 24 that \"we have never seen such a large number of detainees per day,\" with protesters risking fines \"from 2,000 to 300,000 rubles (from €17 to more than €2,500) and risk up to 30 days in detention.\" Durnovo further stated that Russian state media \"sometimes mentions anti-war protests but we can't use them as a source because they don't tell the whole story.\" On 4 March, OVD-Info coordinator Leonid Drabkin told Al Jazeera that \"in over 100 cities, we know that there were detentions\" since the start of the invasion and that \"this topic really touches everyone. Because it's not really about your political views, but many Russians have relatives and friends in Ukraine.\"\nDemographics\nSeveral commentators have noted the significant presence of youth in the anti-war protests in Russia. Cynthia Hooper of the College of the Holy Cross said that protests against the war represented a \"generational struggle\" in Russia, pitting \"those who believe in the stories of state-run television against their own children.\" CNN International's diplomatic editor Nic Robertson stated that \"a generation here has grown up willfully ignorant of state disinformation, weaned instead on social media, so are impervious to the lies that cowed their parents,\" but that they were \"still contained by the massive state security infrastructure that is the real muscle behind state media's messaging.\"\nCommentators have also noted the significant role of women in the protests. Meduza journalist Alexey Kovalyov has stated that \"it's mostly women who are facing real violence and serious prison time.\" Maria Silina of the Université du Québec à Montréal has stated that \"the overwhelming majority of [anti-war protesters] were women, queer or trans — many of whom were rarely visible as political activists in Russia due to homophobic laws against them.\"\nImpact of state media and censorship\nBen Noble of University College London stated that:\"Russian state media continues to portray a very different reality to the coverage in western media. Rather than a full-scale assault, the narrative is of a \"special operation\" to protect ethnic Russians in the so-called \"republics\" of Donetsk and Luhansk from \"genocide\" being carried out by Ukraine's \"neo-Nazi\" government. Words like \"invasion\" and \"war\" are banned in Russian media. Independent outlets have been blocked or shut down. And Russians face the prospect of harsh punishment for challenging the state's line on the conflict.\"\nOne reason many Russians have supported the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine has to do with the propaganda and disinformation being sown by the Kremlin. Some observers noted what they described as a \"generational struggle\" among Russians over perception of the war, with younger Russians more likely opposed to the war and older Russians more likely to accept the narrative presented by state-controlled media in Russia. According to researcher Mikhail Sokolov, \"If you are younger than 30, live in a big city, have a higher education and do not watch television, the probability that you will not support the actions of the Russian army exceeds 80%.\"\nImpact of international sanctions\nThe effect of international sanctions and condemnation of the war at domestic anti-war protests has been debated. Brian Grodsky of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County warned that the weight of sanctions might hurt the Russian opposition more than help it, saying that \"the very sanctions that encourage Russians to attack the regime also narrow their available opportunities to do so.\" Carnegie Moscow Center scholar Andrey Movchan wrote that sanctions aimed at ordinary Russians could be \"exactly what the Kremlin wants – that tens of millions of Russians who oppose the regime will be unable to leave the country and even temporarily find themselves in a world free of Russian propaganda,\" stating that sanctions should instead \"uncompromisingly block the Kremlin's access to its financial and technological resources.\"\nLong-term prognosis\nKremlinologist Lilia Shevtsova stated that \"the 'Crimea effect' is vanishing. The war in Ukraine creates 'our' casualties – this will have an impact. Moreover, in 2008 and 2014, the wars were relatively short and they ended with 'our' victory. At the moment, a lot of Russians accept Putin's 'peace operation.' But they may change their attitude if the operation [is] long and bloody.\"\nErica Chenoweth of the Harvard Kennedy School has stated that \"protests are necessary but insufficient predictors of when elites decide to shift their loyalty\" and that it was \"important not to underestimate that Putin does have a real base that's incredibly loyal to him.\"\nOverall opinion in Russia\nAs of December 2023, support for Putin's war in Ukraine among Russians hit an all-time low.\nSee also\n* 2014 anti-war protests in Russia\n* 2022 protests in Russian-occupied Ukraine\n* Boycott of Russia and Belarus\n* Government and intergovernmental reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War\n* Protests against the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* State Duma initiative for charging Vladimir Putin of high treason\n* White-blue-white flag\n*National liberation struggle of the Ingush people\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n* [https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/11/alternate-reality-how-russian-society-learned-to-stop-worrying-about-the-war?lang=en Carnegie Endowment for International Peace] – Carnegie Moscow Center, 28 November 2023"
