As of August 26, 2021, it had licensed its software to over 3,500 organizations.\nProducts\nRadView WebLOAD is a load testing and analysis tool that combines performance, scalability, and integrity as a single process for the verification of web applications. It scales to hundreds of thousands of virtual users, making it possible to test massive loads and report bottlenecks, constraints, and weak points within an application.\nIn 2021, RadView added RadView TestAutomation to its portfolio of products – an AI-based Test Automation solution through its acquisition of Shield34, an AI-based Test Automation company.\nRadview TestAutomation is an intelligent Selenium-based platform for fast, easy, and reliable testing of web applications. It accelerates test development,  cuts script maintenance work, eliminates redundant test failures, and shortens the time to reproduce and fix failed tests. Radview TestAutomation is fully compatible with Selenium, which allows the execution of any existing Selenium-based scripts immediately with no migration effort.\nHistory\nRadView was founded in 1993 by Ilan Kinreich, former co-founder of Mercury Interactive. In 1996, the company launched WebLOAD to meet the need for testing web and mobile applications under load peak conditions. In August 2000, RadView completed an initial public offering, followed by private financing from Fortissimo Capital, Meitav, and others. In April 2021, RadView acquired an AI-based Test Automation company, adding RadView TestAutomation to its portfolio of products.\nSee also\n*Load testing\n*Test automation\n*Cloud testing\n*Artificial intelligence\n*Software performance testing\n*WebLOAD\n*Soak testing\n*Stress testing\n*Web testing\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://radview.com RadView Homepage]"
