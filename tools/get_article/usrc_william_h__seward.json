Initially ordered to New York for temporary duty, she was then assigned to Wilmington, North Carolina in July 1864. In 1874, she was moved to Key West, Florida and transferred to Galveston, Texas the following year.\nOn 7 April 1880, Seward was assigned to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi where she primarily patrolled from Mobile Bay to Port Eads. She was also ordered to \"cruise to New Orleans occasionally.\" On 30 September 1885, her patrol area was extended into the Mississippi River, as far south as \"Port Eads and the Passes.\" On 13 July 1895 her cruising grounds were \"from Mobile, Alabama to West End, Lake Pontchartrain, with occasional visits into the Mississippi River to the Head of the Passes.\"\nOn 12 June 1897, she was ordered to Ship Island to aid in quarantine duty with the Marine Hospital Service ship MH Surgeon. She was then repaired and fumigated at Pensacola, Florida in September 1897. In February 1898, she was ordered to Mobile for the Mardi Gras Carnival.
