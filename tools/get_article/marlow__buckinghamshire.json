The ancient parish was large, including rural areas north and west of the town. In 1896 the civil parish of Great Marlow was divided into Great Marlow Urban District (the town) and Great Marlow civil parish (the rural areas). In 1897 the urban district was renamed Marlow Urban District, and the town has been known simply as Marlow.\nHistory\nMarlow is recorded in the Domesday Book as Merlaue.\nMagna Britannia includes the following entry for Marlow: \"The manor of Marlow, which had belonged to the Earls of Mercia, was given by William the Conqueror, to his Queen Matilda. Henry the First, bestowed it on his natural son, Robert de Melhent, afterwards Earl of Gloucester, from whom it passed, with that title, to the Clares and Despencers, and from the latter, by female heirs, to the Beauchamps and Nevilles, Earls of Warwick. It continued in the crown from the time of Richard III's marriage with Anne Neville, until Queen Mary granted it to William Lord Paget, in whose family it continued more than a century; after which, it passed, by purchase, to Sir Humphrey Winch, in 1670; to Lord Falkland in 1686; to Sir James Etheridge in 1690; to Sir John Guise in 1718; and to Sir William Clayton in 1736. It is now the property of Sir William Clayton bart. a descendant of the last purchaser\".\nMarlow owed its importance to its location on the River Thames, where the road from Reading to High Wycombe crosses the river. It had its own market by 1227 (hence the name Chipping Marlow), although the market lapsed before 1600. Marlow's status as a regional commercial centre was present even before the first bridge in this area was built in the 13th century due to the settlement acting as an inland port.\nA 14th century hall, known as 'The Old Parsonage' built in Marlow on St Peters Street is currently the oldest inhabited building in Buckinghamshire.\nFrom 1301 to 1307, the town had its own Member of Parliament, and it returned two members from 1624 to 1867.\nThe population of Great Marlow was 4,480 by 1841.\nGeography\nMarlow is adjoined by Marlow Bottom, a mile to the north. Little Marlow is nearby to the east along the A4155 Little Marlow Road and Bourne End is further along the same road. To the south across the Thames are Bisham (home of Bisham Abbey) and Cookham Dean, both in Berkshire.\nLandmarks\nThere has been a Marlow Bridge over the Thames since the reign of King Edward III. The current bridge is a suspension bridge, designed by William Tierney Clark in 1832, and it was constructed by 1835. It was a prototype for and is twinned with the much larger Széchenyi Chain Bridge across the River Danube in Budapest.\nNext to the bridge along the river is All Saints Church, in the centre of the town, at the bottom of the High Street. A church has been part of Marlow since the 11th century. The present building was constructed in the Victorian Era, as the spire of the previous Norman church collapsed in 1831. The new church is built of Bath stone, with a spire reaching . The church was completed in 1835, and was designed by Charles Frederick Inwood. Some stone monuments and statues were saved from the Norman style church.\nA memorial to Charles Frohman is located on The Causeway. The memorial, by the artist Leonard Stanford Merrifield, features a drinking fountain with a sculptured nymph and inscription.\nThe Junior Wing of the Royal Military College, which is now based at Sandhurst, was once based at Remnantz, a large house in West Street, built in the early 18th century.\n, now the Everyman Cinema]]\nMarlow Town Hall was completed in 1807. It was subsequently converted into a hotel, then a shop and now a cinema.\nhas earned 2 Michelin stars]]\nThe Hand & Flowers, the first gastropub to hold two Michelin stars, is located on West Street. It is one of several local pubs serving award-winning beers brewed locally, in Marlow Bottom, by the Rebellion Beer Company.\nMarlow is the location of Marlow Lock, originating from the 14th century.\nhouse from the depths of the lock]]\nTwinning\nMarlow is twinned with\n* Marly-le-Roi, France, since 1980.\n* Budavár, a district of Budapest, Hungary.\nTransport\nThe A4155 road runs through Marlow town centre, with the A404 lying one mile to the east, the M40 motorway further to the north, and the M4 motorway to the south.\nMarlow is served by a railway station which is the terminus of a single-track branch line from Maidenhead. The train service is known as the Marlow Donkey, which was the nickname given to the steam locomotives that once operated on the line. There is also a pub with the same name, located close to the railway station.\nBus services are provided by Arriva Shires & Essex to neighbouring towns, including High Wycombe, Henley-on-Thames and Reading. In July 2024, Carousel Buses took over the bus services, after Arriva closed its High Wycombe depot.\nCycling infrastructure is currently limited to a small number of shared use cycle paths.  However local charity Transition Town Marlow are campaigning to improve this by allowing cyclists to use footpaths as pedestrian priority; improve and increase the amount of shared use paths and install more cycle racks.\nEducation\nEducation is provided by several schools, including:\n*Great Marlow School (11–18)\n*Sir William Borlase's Grammar School (11–18)\n*Burford School (4–11)\n*Danesfield School (4–11)\n*Foxes Piece School (4–11)\n*Holy Trinity Church of England School (7–11)\n*Marlow Church of England Infant School (4–7)\n*Spinfield School (4–11)\n*St Peter's Catholic Primary School (4–11)\nGovernance\nThere are two tiers of local government covering Marlow, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Marlow Town Council, and Buckinghamshire Council.\nMarlow Town Council was established in 1974 as a successor parish to the former Marlow Urban District Council, which had been created in 1896. The urban district council had been based at Court Garden House since 1934, and the town council continues to be based there. Between 1974 and 2020 the town was also included in the Wycombe District, based in High Wycombe. The county and district councils merged in 2020 to become the unitary Buckinghamshire Council.\nMarlow is divided into three wards for electing town councillors: North & West, South and South East. There are a total of twelve Marlow Town Councillors elected from these wards. The wards have seven, two and three seats respectively. Since 2011, the Town Council has been entirely Conservative with several councillors \"double-hatting\" across town and county council. The town forms a single ward with three councillors for electing councillors to Buckinghamshire Council.\nIn the 2021 local elections, a group of independent candidates contested eleven out of the twelve seats. They worked under the banner \"Independents for Marlow\" and were inspired by similar actions in Frome, High Wycombe, and other places, part of the \"flatpack democracy\" movement. None were successful and all twelve seats were held by Conservatives.\nIn the 2025 local elections 7 independent candidates (6 of which were grouped under \"Residents for Marlow\") were elected to the Town Council, with the remaining seats going to 1 Liberal Democrat and 4 Conservatives. For the Buckinghamshire Council elections, the constituency also included Marlow Bottom, with the 3 elected councillors including 1 Liberal Democrat and 2 Conservatives.\nSport\nRowing\nMarlow Rowing Club, founded in 1871, is one of Britain's premier rowing clubs and has produced many Olympic oarsmen including Sir Steve Redgrave.
