German strength is entire strength, not only the Eastern Front. In July 1944 the Germans had over 1,500 tanks in Normandy and several hundred in other theatres such as Italy and the Balkans. Likewise, the Soviet kept about 3,000 tanks in the Far East through much of the war.\"  (2) \"German tank losses here include all fronts; the tank exchange ratio deletes estimated German losses to Anglo-American forces and so reflects only the Soviet-German loss.\"\nTotal material, arms and equipment losses\nGrigori F. Krivosheev concludes: \"Losses during strategic operations accounted for 61.48% of small-arms losses, 65.52% of tank and SP gun losses, 56.89% of gun and mortar losses and 58.6% of combat aircraft losses during the war. On average 11,000 small arms, 68 tanks, and 30 aircraft were lost each day. In such as the Baltic, Beyelorussian, Kiev and Voronezh-Voroshilovgrad defensive operations, 20-30,000 small arms, 90-290 tanks, 200-520 guns and mortars and 30-100 combat aircraft were lost daily. Losses were also high during the Battle of Kursk and Berlin offensive, with 70-90 tanks, 90-210 guns and mortars and 25-40 aircraft lost each day.\"\nSea\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+Table of losses\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: left; width:10%;\" |Country\n! style=\"width:8%;\"  | Carriers, Escort carrier and Seaplane tenders\n! style=\"width:8%;\"  | Battleships and battlecruisers\n! style=\"width:8%;\"  | Cruisers\n! style=\"width:8%;\"  | Destroyers\n! style=\"width:8%;\"  | Escort destroyers, frigates and Sloops\n! style=\"width:8%;\"  | Submarines\n! style=\"width:10%;\" | Other warships\n! style=\"width:8%;\"  | Auxiliary\n! style=\"width:8%;\"  | Total\n!
