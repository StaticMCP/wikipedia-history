It was established in 1969 and first awarded in 1970.\nHistory\nThe Brigadier General Jeremiah P. Holland Award, first issued on 26 September 1970 – the 29th anniversary of the Military Police Corps – is annually awarded to the all-around best Military Police unit of company-size or smaller in the U.S. Army. The award is considered a unit trophy as provided for in Army Regulation 600–8–22. Units are scored against several specific criteria including the unit's Army Physical Fitness Test and weapons qualification averages, unit deployments, and personnel re-enlistment totals.\nThe award was established with a financial endowment from its namesake, Jeremiah Holland, following his retirement from military service. The award criteria and procedures were subsequently created by Major General Karl W. Gustafson, then the Provost Marshal General of the United States. Under them, each Army Command, Army Service Component Command, Direct Reporting unit or Field Operating Agency – as well as the U.S. Army Reserve and the Army National Guard – is allowed to submit two nominations. By custom, the recipients of inferior Military Police unit trophies – including the Eagle Award (awarded to the best MP unit in Forces Command), the Thomas F. Barr Award (awarded to the best MP unit in Army Corrections Command), and others – are nominated for consideration for the Holland Award. It consists of a trophy awarded to the selected unit, and challenge coins to the unit's personnel.\nPrevious winners\n2015 21st MP Company (ABN), Fort Bragg, North Carolina\n2014 HHD, 11th MP Battalion (CID), Fort Hood, Texas\n2013 92D MP Company, Baumholder, Germany\n2012 58TH MP Company, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii\n2011 209TH MP Detachment, Fort Benning, Georgia\n2010 HHC, 705TH MP Battalion, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas\n2009 194TH MP Company, Fort Campbell, Kentucky\n2008 59TH MP Company, Fort Carson, Colorado\n2007 108TH MP Company, Fort Bragg, North Carolina\n2006 194TH MP Company, Fort Campbell, Kentucky\n2005 551ST MP Company, Fort Campbell, Kentucky\n2004 82D MP Company, Fort Bragg, North Carolina\n2003 615TH MP Company, Grafenwoehr, Germany\n2002 549TH MP Company, Fort Stewart, Georgia\n2001 552D MP Company, Pusan, Korea\n2000 92D MP Company, Baumholder, Germany\n1999 230TH MP Company, Kaiserslautern, Germany\n1998 21ST MP Company, Fort Bragg, North Carolina\n1997 1ST MP Company, Wurzburg, Germany 1996 230TH MP Company, Kaiserslautern, Germany\n1995 Fort Myer MP Company, Fort Myer, Virginia\n1994 3D MP Company, Wurzburg, Germany 1993 300TH MP Company, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri\n1992 188TH MP Company, Camp Walker, Korea\n1991 501ST MP Company, Bad Kreuznach, Germany\n1990 65TH MP Company, Fort Bragg, North Carolina\n1989 556TH MP Company, Sieglesbach, Germany\n1988 549TH MP Company, Fort Davis, Panama\n1987 287TH MP Company, Berlin, Germany 1986 552D MP Company, Pusan, Korea\n1985 287TH MP Company, Berlin, Germany 1984 118TH MP Company, Fort Bragg, North Carolina\n1983 300TH MP Company, Stuttgart, Germany\n1982 6TH MP Company, Muenster, Germany 1981 534TH MP Company, Fort Clayton, Panama\n1980 2D MP Company, Camp Casey, Korea  1979 561st MP Company, Fort Myer, Virginia\n1978 984TH MP Company, Fort Carson, Colorado\n1977 284TH MP Company, Frankfurt, Germany\n1976 287TH MP Company, Berlin, Germany 1975 82D MP Company, Fort Bragg, North Carolina\n1974 529TH MP Company, Heidelberg, Germany\n1973 20TH MP Company, Okinawa, Japan 1972 570TH MP Company, Frankfurt, Germany\n1971 118TH MP Company, Fort Bragg, North Carolina\n1970 545TH MP Company, Fort Hood, Texas\nNamesake\nJeremiah P.
