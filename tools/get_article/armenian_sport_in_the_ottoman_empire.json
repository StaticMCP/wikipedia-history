Under the rule of the Sultan, engagement in sports or athletics was strictly forbidden and those who broke this law were punished.\nFirst clubs\nAfter the coup d'état of Young Turks in 1908, the first Armenian athletic clubs and football teams were formed in Constantinople and Smyrna.\nFrom 1911 to 1914, four Pan-Armenian Olympic Games were held in Constantinople. During the Games, records were set and the winners were awarded with silver medals. In 1914, Armenia also held the first \"Cilician Olympic Games\". In the same period, Shavarsh Krissian published the sports magazine Marmnamarz (Armenian: Մարմնամարզ, meaning \"Sport\"). This was the first sports periodical in the Ottoman Empire.\nDuring the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Vahram Papazyan and Mkrtich Mkryan became the first Armenians to represent Ottoman Turkey in the Olympic Games.\nBefore the First World War\nOn the eve of World War I there were about 40 Armenian athletic clubs in Constantinople. Armenian football teams took part in team and international tournaments and several leagues in the capital. The most famous football teams were Balta Liman, Araks, and Torq. The most famous team from Smyrna was Hay Vorsordats Club (\"The Armenian Hunters' club\"). Armenian sport clubs were also established in Nicomedia (İzmit), Karin (Erzurum), Marzvan (Merzifon), Samson, Adana, Van, Caesarea (Kayseri), Dortyol (Dörtyol), Trapizon (Trabzon), and Konya, among others.\nImpact of the Armenian genocide\nFrom 1915 to 1920, many Armenian sportsmen became victims of the Armenian genocide and most Armenian sports clubs were shut down. Among those killed was Shavarsh Krissian. Marmnamarz ceased publication after his death.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/02.09.2008.php THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE MUSEUM-INSTITUTE – Armenian Sport in the Ottoman Empire]\n*[http://www.panorama.am/en/society/2008/09/02/sport/ Panorama.am – The role of Armenian Sport in Ottoman Empire]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110531152953/http://www.armradio.am/news/?part=soc&id=13327 PUBLIC RADIO OF ARMENIA – Display of the history of Armenian sport in Turkey to be held at the Genocide Institute]\n*[http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/13.10.2009.php THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE MUSEUM-INSTITUTE – An illustrated book published by AGMI – “Armenian Sport and Gymnastics in the Ottoman Empire”]"
