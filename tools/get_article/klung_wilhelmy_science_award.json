It is bestowed upon outstanding younger German scientists under the age of 40.\nPrevious award names\n*1973 to 2001 – Otto-Klung Award\n*2001 to 2007 – Otto-Klung-Weberbank Award\n*2007 to 2013 – Klung-Wilhelmy-Weberbank Award\nSelection process\nThe prizewinners are selected by permanent committees at the Institutes of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Department of Physics at the Free University of Berlin, with additional input from professors at other universities. Proposals and nominations by nationally and internationally renowned scientists are also taken into consideration. Self-nominations will not be accepted.\nThe final decision on the selection recommendations is made by the following foundations: the Otto Klung Foundation at the Free University of Berlin and the Dr. Wilhelmy Foundation. The stated aim of these foundations is to strengthen the promotion of outstanding scientific achievements and to reward internationally accredited innovative approaches. Five of the previously chosen prizewinners later received the Nobel Prize.\nThe prize was first awarded in 1973 by the Otto Klung Foundation. Since 2007, the prize has become one of the highest privately funded scientific endowments in Germany. The annual award ceremony, which has been held in November, is open to the public.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50%;\"| Chemistry !! style=\"width:50%;\"| Physics\n|-\n|  2024 : Max Martin Hansmann,\nhonored for pioneering the development of novel organic compound classes and their innovative use as atom-transfer reagents and organic redox systems.\n|| 2023:  Hannes Bernien,\nhonored for ground-breaking contributions to the development of quantum simulation and computing platforms with Rydberg atoms and spins in diamond.\n|-\n|  2022 : Viktoria Däschlein-Gessner,\nhonored for her pioneering research in the field of synthetic and mechanistic inorganic chemistry as well as catalysis.\n|| 2021 : Monika Aidelsburger,\nhonored for her experimental realization of synthetic gauge fields in optical lattices and their application to quantum simulators of topological phases of matter.\n|-\n|  2020 : Franziska Schoenebeck,\nhonored for her pioneering research in the fields of organic synthesis, catalysis, and computer-aided elucidation of reaction mechanisms.\n|| 2019 : Titus Neupert,\nhonored for his contributions to the theoretical prediction of novel \"topological\" phases of matter, in particular fractional Chern insulators and higher-order topological insulators.\n|-\n|  2018 : Philipp Kukura,\nhonored for his pioneering work in the development and application of imaging methods for the visualization and characterization of single biomolecules.\n|| 2017 : ,\nhonored for his pioneering achievements in the area of ultrafast electron microscopy and nonlinear light-matter interaction in nanostructures\n|-\n|  2016 : ,\nhonored for his research on the synthesis of natural product inspired compounds for the fight against pathogenic bacteria and fundamental studies on bacterial virulence.\n|| 2015 : Tobias J.
