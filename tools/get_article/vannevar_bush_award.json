In 1945, at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he wrote a famous essay entitled Science, the Endless Frontier which recommended that a foundation be established by the United States Congress to serve as a focal point for the USA Federal Government's support and encouragement of research and education in science and technology as well as the development of a national science policy. The legislation creating the National Science Foundation was signed by president Harry S. Truman on May 10, 1950.\nList of winners\nSource: National Science Board\nSee also\n* List of general science and technology awards\n* Prizes named after people\n* Enrico Fermi Award\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/awards/bush.jsp Award Home Page]"
