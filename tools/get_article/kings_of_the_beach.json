A version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was produced by Konami (under the Ultra Games label) in 1990.\nGameplay\nalt=\nThe player can play as Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos. The game features three modes of play: practice, match play and tournament. In the latter, the players progress through five beaches (San Diego, Chicago, Waikiki, Rio de Janeiro, and Australia) filled with increasingly challenging opponents. While Smith and Stoklos are joined by Ron Von Hagen, Tim Hovland and Mike Dodd as the only 'real' volleyball players featured in the game, EA spiced up the competition with some characters from other games, including Hard Hat Mack and Lester from Skate or Die and Ski or Die.\nThe gameplay controls for the console version are fairly simple, with the directional pad and two buttons doing all the work. In the PC version, players control three actions: bump, set, and block/spike. Diving for the ball occurs automatically. The only 'advanced' moves in the game are the ability to dink or perform a one-handed Kong block (Stoklos's trademark).\nAnother feature of the game is the ability to 'argue' calls with the referee, which occasionally allows players to get a point overturned, but if players argue too much, the referee may penalize them with a red card and deduct a point.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* GameFAQs provides a fairly complete [https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/587387-kings-of-the-beach overview of the game]"
