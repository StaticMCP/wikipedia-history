The incident took place during a Dhaka Derby in September 1982, when three Abahani players (Kazi Salahuddin, Golam Rabbani Helal, Ashrafuddin Ahmed Chunnu) alongside Anwar were arrested for protesting the referee's decision which later progressed into a fight involving the respective fans. Surprisingly, the court held Anwar and his teammates responsible for conspiring a potential military coup, against military government Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Although Anwar was sentenced to six months in prison, he along with the other four footballers were released after 17 days.\nCoaching career\nAnwar holds an AFC C License and has coached the likes of Wari Club, PWD SC and Eskaton Sabuj Sangha Club.
