Located on 12 acres, the Center provides a variety of services that benefit the community through educational and therapeutic programs for people, and humane care and adoption for animals.\nHistory\nThe Center was established in 1972 as the San Dieguito Animal Care and Education Center with its primary focus on pet adoption and on-site humane education. It was renamed in honor of its founder, Helen Woodward, in 1986. Since its inception, services have grown to include an equine hospital, small animal hospital, boarding facility, animal-assisted therapy outreach, therapeutic horseback riding for the disabled and AniMeals food for pets of the homebound. Education services have expanded to off-site presentations and outreaches.\nThe Center provides three-day workshops and conferences through The Business of Saving Lives International Conference. The conference provides tips and techniques on managing pet adoptions, public relations, fundraising, humane education, accounting, marketing, human resources and volunteers. Participants have attended from 33 states and 17 locations outside the United States including Argentina, Canada, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Ireland, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Mexico and Romania.\nMichael ('Mike') Arms has been CEO and President of Helen Woodward Animal Center since 1999. In October 2007, the Center had to evacuate over 400 animals from their property in the Witch Creek Fire.\nIn 2013, Mike Arms created an international awareness campaign to remember all animals who never found new homes after landing in shelters. The campaign was called Remember Me Thursday and occurs annually on the fourth Thursday of September.\nIn May 2014, the center had to evacuate animals from their center during the Bernardo Fire. In 2017, the center created the Pets Without Walls program to help the pets of homeless community members.

The organization also provided Mike Arms with a home loan amounting to $400,000, as well as paying his membership dues at the University Club in Symphony Towers.\nIn January 2018, the center began construction on a new adoptions building. The new adoptions building opened to the public on July 17, 2019.\nHelen Woodward Animal Center holds an annual fundraising event for surfing dogs and surfing people called the Surf Dog Surf-A-Thon at Dog Beach, in Del Mar, California.
