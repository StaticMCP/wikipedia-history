Having arrived there, they plundered the city Sudak in the spring of 1223. Further advances and campaigns led to the Battle of the Kalka River, in which the Kipchak Turks which had previously fled the battlefield allied with the Russians. The joint army was defeated however. Travelling North, the Mongols eventually received a devastating defeat by the Volga Bulgars, leading to the end of the whole campaign and the return of the army to the Mongol Empire in 1224.\nAlthough the battle ended in a victory for the Mongols, it did not allow them to gain a foothold in the region.\nSee also\n* Mongol invasions of Durdzuketi\n* Battle of the Kalka River\n* Mongol invasions of Georgia\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
