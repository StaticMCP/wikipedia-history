The current one was introduced in 2006 and depicts a leopard head, surrounded by an elephant tusk to the left and a spear to the right. Below are the three words which make up the national motto: Justice, Paix, Travail (Justice, Peace, Work in French). It was adopted on 18 February 2006 by President Joseph Kabila.\nThe arms are described in detail in Section 1, Article 1 of the 2005 constitution.\nThe old emblem, which was introduced in 2003, depicted three interlocked hands surrounded by two laurel branches. At the top is a lion head and at the bottom the motto Démocratie, Justice, Unité (Democracy, Justice, Unity in French).\nThe coat of arms of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1999 consists of a light blue shield. In the middle is a yellow star, above which there are six smaller stars. This coat of arms was introduced along with the flag.\nAn even older arms from 1971 to 1997, when the nation was known as Zaire, depicted a leopard head, below it a pair of crossed spears, around it a branch and an elephant tusk. The words Paix, Justice, Travail are written on a white band under the spears. This device was officially introduced on 1 August 1964.\nGallery\nFile:Coat of arms of Kongo.svg|Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Kongo (1528–1541)\nFile:Coat of arms of the Congo Free State.svg|Coat of arms of theCongo Free State (1885–1908)\nFile:Greater Coat of Arms of the Belgian Congo.svg|Coat of arms of the Belgian Congo (1908–1960)\nFile:Coat of arms of the Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) (1960–1963).svg|Coat of arms of the Congo (1960–1963)\nFile:Coat of arms of Congo-Kinshasa (1963-1971).svg|Coat of arms of the Congo (1963–1971)\nFile:Coat of arms of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1963–1971, variant).svg|Variant coat of arms of the Congo (1963–1971)\nFile:Coat of arms of Zaire (1971–1997).svg|Coat of arms of Zaire (1971–1997)\nFile:Coat of arms of Zaire (1971–1997, variant).svg|Variant coat of arms of Zaire (1971–1997)\nFile:Coat of arms of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1997-1999).svg|Coat of arms of the Congo (1997–1999)\nFile:Greater coat of arms of the Democratic Republic of Congo (1999-2003).svg|Greater coat of arms of the Democratic Republic of Congo (1999-2003)\nFile:Coat of arms of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1999-2003).svg|Coat of arms of the Congo (1999–2003)\nFile:Emblem of the Democratic Republic of Congo (2001 proposal).svg|Proposed coat of arms of the Congo (2001)\nFile:Coat of arms of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2003-2006).svg|Coat of arms of the Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2003–2006)\nUnilaterally declared states\nFile:Coat of arms of Katanga.svg|Coat of arms of the State of Katanga (1960–1963)\nFile:Emblem of South Kasai.svg|Coat of arms of South Kasai (1960–1962)\nFile:Coat of arms of the People's Republic of the Congo (Stanleyville).svg|Coat of arms of the People's Republic of the Congo (1964-1965)\nFile:Coat of arms of New Zaire.svg|Emblem of the New Zaire Government in Exile (2017-present)\nSubnational emblems\nSome of the Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have adopted their own distinctive emblems, others use the national emblem of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nFile: Coat of arms of Kinshasa.svg|Kinshasa\nFile:Emblem of Kongo Central Province.png|Kongo Central\nFile:Emblem of Kwilu Province.png|Kwilu Province\nFile:Emblem of Mai-Ndombe Province.png|Mai-Ndombe Province\nFile:Emblem of Kasai Province.png|Kasaï Province\nFile:Emblem of Kasai Central Province.png|Kasaï-Central\nFile:Emblem of Kasai Oriental Province.png|Kasaï-Oriental\nFile:Flag of Sankuru Province.svg|Sankuru\nFile:Emblem of Maniema Province.png|Maniema\nFile:Emblem of South Kivu Province.png|South Kivu\nFile:Emblem of North Kivu.png|North Kivu\nFile:Emblem of Ituri Province.png|Ituri Province\nFile:Emblem of Haut Uele Province.png|Haut-Uélé\nFile:Emblem of Tshopo Province.png|Tshopo\nFile:Emblem of Bas Uele Province.png|Bas-Uélé\nFile:Emblem of Tshuapa Province.png|Tshuapa\nFile:Emblem of Tanganyika Province.png|Tanganyika Province\nFile:Emblem of Lualaba Province.png|Lualaba Province\nFile:Emblem of Haut Katanga Province.png|Haut-Katanga Province\nSee also\n*Armorial of Africa\n*Flag of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nReferences"
