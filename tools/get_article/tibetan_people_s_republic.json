It was a Tibetan autonomous government under the Chinese Communist Party established by the Chinese Red Army during the Long March to assist the communist coup of the Tibetans in Dawu County, Luhuo County, Yajiang County and Garzê County against its theocracy.\nIts main operations were located in the tusi chiefdom of Derge (now Dêgê County). Key people involved with the republic included Spommdav Rdorje, Bkrashis Dbangphyug, and others. The Republic was dissolved along with the Northwest Soviet Federation following the convening of the Chinese 2nd and 4th Army in Garzê County.\nReferences"
