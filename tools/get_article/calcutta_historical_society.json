Founded in 1907, it is dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the cultural heritage of Calcutta (now Kolkata). The society has contributed to the study and understanding of Indian history, particularly the history of Kolkata, through its publication Bengal, Past & Present. It is the oldest historical association in South Asia. The society is based in Calcutta, West Bengal, India.\nHistory\nThe Calcutta Historical Society is a learned society founded on 27 April 1907 at the Calcutta Town Hall in Calcutta (now Kolkata). Its founders included almost eighty of the leading Englishmen of the city. The society was \"formed to preserve ancient and historical Institutions in Calcutta and its environs\". Its founders focused on preserving historical monuments and buildings, and the ancient institutions of the city. The society's first president was Sir Francis Maclean, the chief justice of the Calcutta High Court.\nIn 1910, society members began a successful search for the grave of Walter Landor Dickens, son of the author Charles Dickens. Dickens's son died in India while serving with the 42nd Highlanders. On June 18, 1911, the Calcutta Historical Society installed a bust of William Makepeace Thackeray, at St. John's Church in Calcutta, where the author was baptized. The society commissioned the bust from London sculptor Leonard Jennings for the centennial of Thackeray's birth in Calcutta. The Royal Academy in London received a replica of the bust. The society held a dinner to celebrate the 218th anniversary of the founding of Calcutta on August 25, 1911.\nThe society's activities ceased by the end of 1911 as its leading members were transferred out of India. The society discussed a merger with the Asiatic Society of Bengal, but decided to close its offices in May 1912. In May 1913, Wilmot Corfield, the society's former treasurer, made a presentation to the East India Association in Westminster, England where he proposed forming the Calcutta Historical Society in London, along with establishing of an Indian Hall and Museum in England to serve as an imperial monument to India. However, the society reformed in Calcutta at the rooms of the Asiatic Society on February 4, 1914, under the leadership of president Lawrence Hugh Jenkins.\nThe Calcutta Historic Society is a nonprofit organization and is the oldest historical association in South Asia. The society is based in Calcutta, West Bengal, India.\nPublications\nThe society established a magazine at its first meeting and began publishing the journal, Bengal, Past & Present, in July 1907. Historian and researcher Walter K. Firminger, was the first editor of Bengal, Past & Present. Firminger defined the journal's early vision and direction of preserving \"the British memory of Calcutta as the seat of the British Empire in India.\" Thus, its articles focused on the institutions and buildings from the era of colonialism. As history emerged as a profession and a discipline in the region's universities, the journal changed into a scholarly journal about Asian history and modern India, edited by professional historians such as Pratul Chandra Gupta and Narendra Krishna Sinha. Peter Gran, professor of history at Temple University, notes that Bengal, Past & Present was a \"high-quality\" journal that contributed to Calcutta's importance in professional history. The journal was published through 2012.\nIn 1925, the society republished The Original Letters from India 1779-1815 by Eliza Fay.\nNotable members\n* Wilmot Corfield, philatelist\n* Evan Cotton, presided over the Indian National Congress, member of Calcutta Municipal Corporation, and lawyer\n* Walter K.
