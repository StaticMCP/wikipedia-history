In the battle lasting over two days the invading Spanish were routed.  It is the largest battle to be fought in Jamaica.\nBackground\nIn 1655, an English force led by Admiral Sir William Penn and General Robert Venables seized the island, and successfully held it against two Spanish attempts to retake it. The former Spanish governor of Jamaica, Don Cristóbal Arnaldo Isasi, attempted to recapture the island with forces from Cuba in mid-1657, but the attack was repulsed at the Battle of Ocho Rios by acting governor Colonel Edward D'Oyley.\nOn 20 May 1658, Isasi attempted another invasion with more men recruited from New Spain; the Tercios Mexicano (known as Mexican Regiment). Isasi also had at his disposal four troop transports and armed ships. In total, the invasion force consisted of 31 captains, 31 ensigns, 28 sergeants and 467 soldiers. While this force anchored for two days near the mouth of Rio Nuevo, three English coast guard vessels chanced upon the Spanish but were chased away by gunfire. The English scouts reported back to D'Oyley, who mustered all available militia and soldiers who were fit to fight. The Spanish in the meantime fortified their camp and were joined by around 50 tattered Spanish guerrillas.\nBattle\nOn 25 June, D'Oyley mustered a total of 700 soldiers and militia and ten ships to transport them. The English troops disembarked near the Rio Nuevo. The English then captured the Spanish transports, sealing off any escape for the invaders. The Spanish, seeing this, attempted to make a stand behind their newly fortified redoubt. The English declined to come to grips and fired on the Spanish position with cannon and muskets for two days. Their superior firepower had a devastating effect, and when the surviving Spanish attempted to break out,  most were killed or captured. What was left of the invasion force fled into the hills and jungle. They had lost over 300 dead and wounded, mostly killed, and 150 prisoners, as well as eleven flags, six guns, and most of their arms and ammunition. English casualties numbered around sixty. Most of the wounded on both sides died of tropical diseases.\nAftermath\nThe victorious English conveyed the Spanish artillery back to 'The Point' and to Fort Cromwell, installing it into their defences. Isasi tried to keep up the struggle until he was defeated in 1660, escaping from what is now the area of the Tower Isle resort and fleeing to Cuba by canoe with his remaining supporters. To dissuade further Spanish attempts to retake Jamaica, the English under Christopher Myngs launched attacks on Spanish ports such as Santa Marta and Tolu, forcing the Spanish on to the defensive. Buccaneers such as Henry Morgan were also invited to base themselves at Port Royal, to help defend against Spanish attacks.\nThe battle of Rio Nuevo was the last Spanish attempt to recapture Jamaica. Spain ceded the island to England in 1670 under the Treaty of Madrid.\nBattlefield today\nThe Rio Nuevo Battle Site Heritage Park and Museum was opened in August 2009.\nSee also\n* History of Jamaica\n* British military history\n* Spanish Empire\nNotes\nReferences\n* V.
