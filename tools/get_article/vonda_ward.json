As a boxer, she competed from 2000 to 2008 and held multiple heavyweight world championships, including the WBC title in 2007. She also challenged Ann Wolfe for the WIBA and IBA female light heavyweight titles in 2004, in which she suffered her only defeat, losing by knockout in the first round.\nEarly life and basketball career\nWard grew up in a sports-oriented family; her father, Larry Ward, is a famous harness racer.\nWard played basketball at Trinity High School in Garfield Heights and was twice named Ohio's \"Ms. Basketball.\" She made \"Parade All American\" teams twice. She was recruited by Division I universities across the United States.\nIn 1991, Ward accepted a basketball scholarship at the University of Tennessee. While a member of Pat Summitt's Lady Vols, Ward played in one NCAA basketball championship game (1995) during her college career at Tennessee, losing to the University of Connecticut. She competed with USA Basketball as a member of the 1993 Jones Cup Team that won the Bronze in Taipei. After her college career ended in 1995, Ward played for a professional basketball club in Germany. She later played for the American Basketball League's Colorado Xplosion. In 2012, she was inducted into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame.\nBoxing career\nAfter a broken leg cut her professional basketball career short, Ward turned her attention to boxing.\nWard's boxing debut occurred on January 15, 2000, when she knocked out Faye Steffen in round one at LaPorte, Indiana. Her first four fights all ended in first-round knockout wins for Ward. On April 27, 2000, she met Genevia Buckwalter in New York. Buckwalter became the first fighter to make it out of the first round against Ward, but Ward still won on a second-round knockout. Ward's next five rivals did not make it past the second round, with two first-round knockouts and three second round wins. At this point of her career, she had a streak of twelve knockout wins in a row.\nOn February 2, 2001, she met prospect Kisha Snow as part of the state fair celebrations in Columbus, Ohio. Snow came into the fight undefeated after six bouts, and she and Ward engaged in a four-round war, but Ward made Snow her thirteenth straight knockout victim one minute into the fourth and final round. Ward then face Carley Pesente, on June 16, at Kansas City, Missouri. Pesente lasted two rounds.\nAfter one more win, Ward challenged for the IBA's world's heavyweight title on August 16, 2002. Ward became the champion, but saw her knockout win streak gone as Monica McGowan lasted ten rounds at Canton, Ohio.\nWard defended her title successfully with an eighth-round knockout of Kathy Rivers on December 6 at the Gund Arena in Cleveland. On March 1, 2003, she and Martha Salazar made their Las Vegas debut, with Ward taking a four-round split decision win in a non-title bout.\nAfter one more win, Ward unified her IBA world Heavyweight title with the WIBA's by defeating Salazar in a rematch, held on July 11 in Canton. Ward won by decision.\nOn May 8, 2004, Ward fought a nationally televised championship bout with Ann Wolfe in Biloxi, Mississippi. At one minute and one seconds of the first round, Wolfe knocked out Ward with a devastating right to the chin, with Ward inadvertently stepping forward into the punch. Ward was unresponsive on the mat for several minutes. Ward sustained a neck injury due to her impact on the canvas and she was hospitalized. Her first-round knockout defeat cost Ward her title and undefeated status.\nOn December 12, 2004, Ward returned to the boxing ring, knocking out Marsha Valley in four rounds in Cleveland. On 10 February 2007, Ward won the inaugural WBC female heavyweight title, defeating Martha Salazar for the third and final time by unanimous decision.\nWard announced her retirement on 2010. She was inducted into the International Women's Boxing Hall of Fame in 2018.\nProfessional boxing record\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|24\n|Win\n|23–1\n|align=left| Carlette Ewell\n|UD\n|10\n|Feb 23, 2008\n|align=left| Chapparells Community Center, Akron, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|23\n|Win\n|22–1\n|align=left| Martha Salazar\n|UD\n|10\n|Feb 10, 2007\n|align=left| Wolstein Center, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|align=left|\n|-\n|22\n|Win\n|21–1\n|align=left| Cassandra Giger\n|UD\n|10\n|Jul 15, 2005\n|align=left| Gund Arena, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|align=left|\n|-\n|21\n|Win\n|20–1\n|align=left| Elizabeth Kerin\n|KO\n|2 (10),\n|Apr 29, 2005\n|align=left| Wolstein Center, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|align=left|\n|-\n|20\n|Win\n|19–1\n|align=left| Marsha Valley\n|TKO\n|4 (10),\n|Dec 10, 2004\n|align=left| Gund Arena, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|19\n|Loss\n|18–1\n|align=left| Ann Wolfe\n|KO\n|1 (10),\n|May 8, 2004\n|align=left| Mississippi Coast Coliseum, Biloxi, Mississippi, U.S.}}\n|align=left|\n|-\n|18\n|Win\n|18–0\n|align=left| Martha Salazar\n|UD\n|10\n|Jul 11, 2003\n|align=left| Civic Center, Canton, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|align=left|\n|-\n|17\n|Win\n|17–0\n|align=left| Jeanine Tracy\n|TKO\n|8 (10),\n|Mar 14, 2003\n|align=left| Avalon Events Center, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|16\n|Win\n|16–0\n|align=left| Martha Salazar\n|\n|4\n|Mar 1, 2003\n|align=left| Thomas & Mack Center, Paradise, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|15\n|Win\n|15–0\n|align=left| Kathy Rivers\n|TKO\n|8 (10),\n|Dec 6, 2002\n|align=left| Gund Arena, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|align=left|\n|-\n|14\n|Win\n|14–0\n|align=left| Monica McGowan\n|\n|10\n|Jul 16, 2002\n|align=left| Civic Center, Canton, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|align=left|\n|-\n|13\n|Win\n|13–0\n|align=left| GiGi Jackson\n|TKO\n|4 (4),\n|Feb 22, 2002\n|align=left| Schottenstein Center, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|12\n|Win\n|12–0\n|align=left| Carley Pesente\n|TKO\n|2 (4),\n|May 16, 2001\n|align=left| Ameristar Casino, Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Win\n|11–0\n|align=left| Kisha Snow\n|TKO\n|4 (4),\n|Feb 2, 2001\n|align=left| Celeste Center, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Win\n|10–0\n|align=left| Katie Courtney\n|TKO\n|1 (4)\n|Dec 28, 2000\n|align=left| Willoughby, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Win\n|9–0\n|align=left| Marjorie Jones\n|KO\n|1 (4),\n|Oct 19, 2000\n|align=left| The Cosmopolitan, Wickliffe, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Win\n|8–0\n|align=left| Sharon Thomas\n|TKO\n|1 (4),\n|Sep 23, 2000\n|align=left| Packard Music Hall, Warren, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Win\n|7–0\n|align=left| Jeanine Tracy\n|TKO\n|2 (4)\n|Aug 24, 2000\n|align=left| Columbus, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Win\n|6–0\n|align=left| Lisa Redding\n|TKO\n|1 (4),\n|Jul 17, 2000\n|align=left| Station Casino, Saint Charles, Missouri, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Win\n|5–0\n|align=left| Genevia Buckhalter\n|TKO\n|2 (4),\n|Apr 27, 2000\n|align=left| Hammerstein Ballroom, New York City, New York, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Win\n|4–0\n|align=left| Lana Jock\n|KO\n|1 (4),\n|Mar 24, 2000\n|align=left| UAW Hall, Parma, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Win\n|3–0\n|align=left| Nicolyn Armstrong\n|KO\n|1 (4),\n|Mar 11, 2000\n|align=left| National Guard Armory, Findlay, Ohio, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Win\n|2–0\n|align=left| Mattie Brumley\n|\n|1 (4),\n|Feb 29, 2000\n|align=left| Pepsi Coliseum, Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|1\n|Win\n|1–0\n|align=left| Faye Steffen\n|\n|1 (4),\n|Jan 15, 2000\n|align=left| Civic Center, La Porte, Indiana, U.S.}}\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.vonda-ward.com/ Vonda Ward's official website]\n*"
