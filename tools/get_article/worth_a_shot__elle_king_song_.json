It was released on June 6, 2022 as the second single from King's third studio album, Come Get Your Wife. Dierks Bentley is featured on the song, marking the second collaboration between the two singers, after King previously featured on Bentley's \"Different for Girls\" from his 2016 album, Black.\nBackground and composition\n\"Worth a Shot\" was written by Shane McAnally, Josh Osborne, and Ross Copperman, and initially cut by Dierks Bentley as a solo track. Bentley offered it to King, who suggested they turn the song into a duet.\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Worth a Shot\" premiered on May 18, 2022, and depicts a Wild West theme, with Bentley portraying a wanted man getting rowdy in a saloon and King playing the part of his wife who dons a male disguise to challenge him to a drinking contest, before the sheriff catches up to Bentley and King has to help him flee. Directed by Stephen Kinigopoulos and Alexa Stone, King developed the concept for the video, and it was shot in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"Worth a Shot\"\n!
