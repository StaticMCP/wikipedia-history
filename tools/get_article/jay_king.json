Jay's father lived in Vallejo so he attended Jr. High School and High School in both Sacramento and Vallejo. He left home when he was 14 years old and was a dancer and entertainer. ''\"I left home when I was 14, I had to be on my own, I didn't want to wait.  I wanted to something great. I had to be prepared.  Being on the streets prepared me for what I'm doing now\"'', King shared in an interview with the LA Times in 1987. He formed the break dance group, Jay King & the Unknowns, who performed at high schools, parties, and on the streets, garnering a large local following in Vallejo and the San Francisco Bay Area.  \"I was famous before I ever had a nickel\", King shared in an interview with Half Time Chat regarding his success as a teen dancer.\nKing joined the Air Force and was honorably discharged.  After leaving the military he decided to remain in Alaska, where he had been stationed.  He formed the dance group, Close Encounters of the Funkiest Kind, which quickly became successful and they opened shows for The Pointer Sisters, Atlanta Rhythm Section, and INXS, among other acts.\nKing returned to Sacramento and decided to pursue a career as a rapper.
