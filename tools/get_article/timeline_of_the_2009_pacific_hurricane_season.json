      "text": "# Timeline of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2009 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15 in the East Pacific Ocean, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; they both ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. No tropical cyclones formed during the month of May, making 2009 the first time that no tropical cyclones formed during May since 1999. The first tropical cyclone of the year, Tropical Depression One-E, formed June 18, and dissipated the following day. The first named storm of the season, Hurricane Andres formed on June 21. The final storm of the season, Neki, dissipaed on October 27.\nThis timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation.For convenience and clarity, in the timeline below, all landfalls are bolded. The timeline will also include information, when it becomes available, which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, have been included.\nThe graphical bar below gives a brief overview of storm activity during the season, and for convenience, the storm's maximum intensity is included as a color bar.\nTimeline of events\nImageSize = width:800 height:215\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58
