He faced a primary challenge from author and 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson. A protest movement was also endorsed by multiple organizations protesting the Gaza war, which encouraged voters to submit blank ballots, which are counted in the state.\nPresident Biden won the primary in a landslide.\nScheduling controversy\nOn February 4, 2023, the Democratic National Committee approved a new 2024 primary calendar, moving Georgia's primary ahead to February 13 on the fourth primary date sanctioned by the DNC. This vote was preceded by a December 2022 vote of the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee, held after a letter from President Biden requesting the change was released.  DNC members who supported this new plan said this would give a better representation of Democratic voters' preference during the early months of the campaign. Members of the Georgia Democratic Party noted that moving their primaries to comply with the new calendar would require changing Georgia state law that mandates the state to hold both the Democratic and Republican primaries on the same day. This was unlikely to happen since the state's legislature was controlled by Republicans. In May 2023, Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger denied the DNC's request for a separate February date and scheduled the Georgia primaries for March 12. The DNC accepted this date, saying the state party showed a \"good faith effort\" to comply with the new calendar. Because state law prevented the earlier date, the DNC granted Georgia a waver and counted its delegates in full.\nOpinion polling\n{| class=\"wikitable tpl-blanktable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!
