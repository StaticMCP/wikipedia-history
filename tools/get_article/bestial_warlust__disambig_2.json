      "text": "# Bestial Warlust__disambig_2\n\nBestial Warlust is an Australian extreme metal band formed in Melbourne in 1990. They achieved underground cult status as a war metal band.\nHistory\nThe band was first formed under the name Corpse Molestation and at the time played black/death metal with five demos and one demo compilation under the name.  Their lyrical themes involved death, war and blasphemy.  The band also used pseudonyms to hide their identities. They were one of the pioneers of Australian black metal and extreme metal, recording two black/death metal albums in the mid-nineties before breaking up. Their style was raw and furious, taking off from the old-school black metal style found in such bands as Bathory, Sarcófago, Beherit, and Blasphemy. Many members of Bestial Warlust went on to form Deströyer 666 and participate in other Australian extreme metal acts.\nIn November 2019, the group announced a show at the Croxton Bandroom in Melbourne. Initially announced for 31 October 2020, it was delayed to an as-yet-to-be-announced date in March 2021, and later to 11 September that year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, before being cancelled.\nBand members\nLine-up\n*Marcus Hellcunt - drums (1993-1997)\n*Joe Logiudice - guitar, vocals (1993-1997)\n*Damon Burr - vocals (1993-1997)\nFormer members\n*Philip Gresik - bass\n*Chris Wild - bass\n*Bradley Chung- drums (1990-1992)\n*Jordy - guitar\n*Keith Bemrose - guitar, vocals (1993-1994)\n*Andrew Gillon - bass (1996)\nDiscography\n* Vengeance War Till Death (1994)\n* Blood & Valour (1995)\n* Promo 1993 [One track] (1993)\n* Promo 1995 (1995)\n* ''Satan's Fist (1998)\n* The Blackend Vol. 1 (Black metal compilation album featuring \"Satanic\", From Vengeance War Till Death\n* The Blackend Vol. 2 (Black metal compilation album featuring \"Orgy Of Souls\" From Blood & Valour\n* Headbangers Against Disco Vol. 1'' (Split album with: Sabbat, Gehennah and Infernö, 1997)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=1225 Bestial Warlust] at Encyclopaedia Metallum\n* [ Bestial Warlust] at Allmusic\n* [https://metallian.com/bestialwarlust.php Bestial Warlust story Biography]"
