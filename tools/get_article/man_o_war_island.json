It is at the mouth of L'etang Harbour.\nThere are aquaculture sites off of Man O War Island, including owned by Kelly Cove Aquaculture.\nAs of 1923, it had two buoys associated with the island.\nIn October 1925, Harry Stone's two-masted schooner Cora Gertie sank with no lives lost, in a gale after being blown into Bliss Harbour and striking Man O War Island. It had been parked 12 miles off the coast to sell smuggled White Horse whiskey which was salvaged from the sunken wreck. Prohibition inspectors found ten gallons of alcohol in a bog on Spruce Island where the crew had reached shore.\nReferences"
