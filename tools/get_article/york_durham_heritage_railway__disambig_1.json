Trips had various travel times depending on the event or festival.\nThe railway ran on the tracks of the former Toronto and Nipissing Railway. Metrolinx owns the tracks to Uxbridge, but operated GO Transit commuter trains no further than Old Elm GO Station, the northern terminal of the Stouffville line.\nYDHR began operations in 1996 as an all-volunteer run Heritage Association. During the late 2010s the organization changed business models to become a mix of volunteer and paid staff, lead by CEO John Perks. In 2022 the railway reported financial difficulties, and as of January 2024 has ceased all operations and filed for bankruptcy protection.\nOperations\nThe Township of Uxbridge owns Uxbridge's heritage railway station but leases the tracks and Uxbridge's railyard from the province through Metrolinx, a provincial agency. The York–Durham Heritage Railway was an incorporated registered charity. The township was the railway's landlord.\nThe York–Durham Heritage Railway operated non-stop from the Uxbridge Station on the Metrolinx Uxbridge Subdivision.\nTrains were usually scheduled on weekends from June through mid-October, and were pulled by an Alco RS-11 diesel locomotive, #3612, which was built for the Duluth, Winnipeg & Pacific Railway in 1956. Coaches included both vintage heavyweights built in the 1910s and 1920s, and lightweight cars from 1954.\nThe railway cars were stored at an open rail yard on Railway Street/King Street West in Uxbridge, Ontario. Several railway sheds are on the yard. The most significant is the Uxbridge Station, built in 1904.\nInitially, YDHR staff consisted entirely of volunteers. In later years, as ridership increased, paid staff increasingly supplemented the volunteers. At the same time, the YDHR board of directors had a decreasing number of members from the local community. As of 2022, the YDHR was operated by nine full-time staff supplemented by 88 part-time and seasonal workers and volunteers of the York–Durham Heritage Railway Association.\nBy 2023, the township identified code and safety problems in YDHR's operations that the township wanted rectified. On January 21, 2024, the YDHR announced that all operations had ceased and the railway had filed for bankruptcy protection. The YDHR's chairperson admitted its business model had not been successful.\nLater in 2024, the township started to prepare an  for a rail operator to restart a heritage train service. However, Metrolinx, as owner of the rail line, convinced the township to abandon the idea due to potential new obligations related to oversight, insurance, and liability as well as the prospect of new fleet acceptance requirements.\nRailway History\nThe Uxbridge Subdivision was built in 1871 as the Toronto and Nipissing Railway, a  narrow-gauge line.  The line was converted to  shortly after being acquired by the Midland Railway in 1882.  Following a series of mergers and acquisitions, the line became part of the Canadian National Railway (CN) in 1923.\nIn the 1980s, CN began to abandon the line.  Tracks north of Uxbridge were lifted, but the line south of Uxbridge was purchased by GO Transit (now Metrolinx) to preserve it for possible Uxbridge - Toronto commuter rail service.  Pending the introduction of such a service, the York-Durham Railway was the sole operator north of Old Elm station.\nRolling stock\nLocomotives\n* 1951 MLW RS-3 #1310\n* 1955 MLW RS-3 #22\n* 1956 ALCO RS-11 #3612\n* 1603 ONR GP-9 #1603 on lease to the YDHR 2023-2024\nPassenger Cars\n* 1919 Pullman Company Colonist sleeper #4960\n* 1930 CCF Solarium/Lounge car #15041, (ex-CNR)\n* 1950s Coaches # 3233, 3209 (ex-CNR)\n* 1955 Budd coaches #101 - #106, converted from Rail Diesel Cars to coaches in 2008.\nNon-passenger cars\n* 1919 National Steel Car boxcar #406308 (ex-CNR)\n* 1950 CCF flatcar #662339 (ex-CNR)\n* 1953 caboose #434908 (ex-CPR)\n* 1957 National Steel Car Baggage car #9636\n* hopper car #165 (ex-Green Bay and Western Railway)\n* 3 track inspection cars\nSee also\n*List of heritage railways in Canada\n* Narrow gauge railways in Ontario\n* List of Ontario railways\n* Rail transport in Ontario\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ydhr.ca/ York-Durham Heritage Railway]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/user/YorkDurhamRail/ YDHR YouTube Page.]\n]"
