Some, of course, more appealing than others.\" She notes that in addition to the Nebula winners it also includes \"several of the runners-up, which succinctly points out what a tight, quality pack these finalists are.\" Highlighted are the pieces by Varley, \"a brilliant tale of computer skulduggery and mystery,\" Robinson, \"really gripping,\" Butler, also gripping, and \"creepy.\" Others \"didn't do much for me,\" especially the pieces by Gibson, \"written a little too coyly: all style and not enough story for my taste,\" and Bishop, \"bits and puppy dogs' tails of stories that never coalesced for me.\" Still, in summation she pronounces \"let it just be said that if you seek the best in quality and diversity: Look no further.\"\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Michael M.
