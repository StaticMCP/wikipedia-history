It depicts the lead-up to the 2016 referendum through the activities of the strategists behind the Vote Leave campaign, that prompted the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, known as Brexit. Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Dominic Cummings, the Campaign Director of the officially designated  Brexit-supporting group, Vote Leave. Rory Kinnear stars as Craig Oliver, one of the leaders of the officially designated Remain-supporting group, Britain Stronger in Europe.\nIt aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on 7 January, and aired on HBO in the United States on 19 January. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its pacing, black comedy, and the depiction of the campaign as a thriller, and with particular praise for Cumberbatch's performance which was likened to his role in the TV series Sherlock.  The film received a nomination at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Television Movie.\nPlot\nThe film opens in 2020, at a future (fictional) public inquiry, where a frustrated Dominic Cummings attempts to explain to the panel that they have no understanding of the way in which technology is reshaping politics and therefore society in the United Kingdom.\nIn 2015, Cummings rejects an offer by UKIP MP Douglas Carswell and political strategist Matthew Elliott to lead the Vote Leave campaign due to his contempt for \"Westminster politics\", but accepts when Carswell promises him full control. Cummings uses \"algorithmic database-driven micro-targeting tools\" delivered via social media/internet, instead of a traditional campaign of posters/phone calls/leaflets delivered by local MPs. Cummings rejects an approach by Nigel Farage and Arron Banks of Leave.EU to merge campaigns, as his data shows Farage is an obstacle to winning a majority. Cummings' technology-driven approach causes friction with Vote Leave MPs and donors. John Mills, chair of Vote Leave, tries to fire Cummings to merge with Leave.EU, but finds himself instead fired.\nCummings and his Remain counterpart, Craig Oliver, lay out their strategies and opinion of each other to their respective teams.  Both identify the one-third of undecided UK voters as the key. Oliver targets \"Jobs and the Economy\", while Cummings feels the \"Loss of Control\" and the possible accession of Turkey to the EU is a greater concern. Cummings invokes a strategy from Sun Tzu's The Art of War and avoids refuting \"Jobs and the Economy\" to instead focus on their own message – \"Take Back Control\" – that positions Remain as the \"historical status quo\" and Vote Leave as the \"change\" option. Cummings meets and hires Canadian Zack Massingham, co-founder of AggregateIQ, who offers to build a database using social media tools of voters who are not on the UK electoral register but are inclined to vote to leave. Arron Banks meets Robert Mercer, who discusses the potential of social media database tools.\nCummings, using the AggregateIQ database, brings MP Douglas Carswell to Jaywick, a part of his constituency he did not know existed, where a couple articulates the destitution of their position.  Oliver, using the traditional focus-groups, realises that his campaign has failed to understand the concerns of many UK voters as one focus-group descends into a mass quarrel with one member breaking down crying: \"I'm sick of feeling like nothing like I have nothing! Like I know nothing. Like I am nothing. I'm sick of it\". Oliver's own staff becomes demoralised and angry.\nIn the final stages of the campaign, high-profile Conservative MPs Michael Gove and Boris Johnson join the Vote Leave campaign emphasising the need to \"Take Back Control\", while Penny Mordaunt raises concerns on BBC over the accession of Turkey. Gove and Johnson have some reticence over specific Vote Leave claims (e.g. £350 million for NHS, and 70 million potential Turkish emigrants) but overcome them. Oliver conducts an emergency Tory-Labour Remain conference call with the prime minister David Cameron and Peter Mandelson, but each side blames the other for the Remain campaign's decline. Following the murder of MP Jo Cox, Cummings and Oliver share a drink and discuss events, with Cummings comparing his campaign as having started a train that cannot be stopped, and Oliver replying: \"Be careful what you wish for. You won't be able to control it either\".\nOn 23 June 2016, Britain narrowly votes to leave the EU. After a victory speech, Cummings quietly leaves the Vote Leave campaign office. Back in the present at the 2020 (fictional) public inquiry, Cummings outlines his disappointment at how the political system reacted post the Vote Leave victory, and walks out in disgust.\nCast\n* Benedict Cumberbatch as Dominic Cummings, main political strategist for Vote Leave\n* Rory Kinnear as Craig Oliver, main political strategist for Britain Stronger in Europe\n* Lee Boardman as Arron Banks, businessman and co-founder of Leave.EU\n* Richard Goulding as Boris Johnson, Conservative MP and Mayor of London (later prime minister) who campaigned for Vote Leave\n* John Heffernan as Matthew Elliott, political strategist for Vote Leave\n* Oliver Maltman as Michael Gove, Conservative MP who campaigned for Vote Leave\n* Simon Paisley Day as Douglas Carswell, UKIP MP who campaigned for Vote Leave\n* Lucy Russell as Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner\n* Paul Ryan as Nigel Farage, UKIP MEP and prominent Leave campaigner\n* Kyle Soller as Zack Massingham, co-founder of AggregateIQ, hired by Cummings\n* Liz White as Mary Wakefield, commissioning editor for The Spectator and wife of Cummings\n* Kate O'Flynn as Victoria Woodcock, operations director for Vote Leave\n* Nicholas Day as John Mills, businessman and chairman of Vote Leave, who is fired by Cummings\n* Tim McMullan as Sir Bernard Jenkin, Conservative MP and board member of Vote Leave\nThe film also includes: Richard Durden as Sir Bill Cash, Conservative MP and board member of Vote Leave; Gavin Spokes as Andrew Cooper, political strategist and polling expert for Britain Stronger in Europe; Aden Gillett as Robert Mercer, US businessman and donor to Leave.EU; Mark Dexter as the voice of David Cameron, the prime minister; Mark Gatiss as the voice of Peter Mandelson, Labour peer and board member of Britain Stronger in Europe.\nIn addition, the focus-group casting includes: Annabelle Dowler as the focus group facilitator; Gabriel Akuwudike as Robin, the \"ardent internationalist\" focus group participant; John Arthur as Roger, the \"EU hostile\" focus group participant; Rakie Ayola as Camilla, the \"comfortable Europhile\" focus group participant; Jay Simpson as Steve, the \"strong skeptic\" focus group participant; Heather Coombs as Sandra, the \"hearts vs heads\" focus group participant; and Kiran Sonia Sawar as Shamara the \"disengaged middle\" focus group participant\nProduction\nScreenplay\nJames Graham, the film's screenwriter, originally wrote a first draft focusing on David Cameron, the UK's prime minister during the vote. However, he then changed it to Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of the official designated Brexit-supporting group, Vote Leave. In a Channel 4 News interview, Graham revealed that the film was based on the books ''All Out War: The Full Story of How Brexit Sank Britain's Political Class by Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman, and Unleashing Demons: The Inside Story of Brexit'' by David Cameron's Downing Street communications director Craig Oliver, and on interviews with the campaign strategists involved, Cummings in particular. Oliver acted as a consultant on the film. In order to better play lead character Dominic Cummings, Benedict Cumberbatch visited him at his family home.\nFilming\nThe film was commissioned in May 2018 by Channel 4 with Benedict Cumberbatch cast to play Dominic Cummings. Filming commenced in June with the supporting cast set, including Rory Kinnear and John Heffernan.\nReception\nCritical response\nCritic reviews were generally positive after the 7 January 2019 broadcast of the film in the UK by Channel 4.

Charles Moore wrote in The Daily Telegraph that the film \"told a story of forgotten people finding their voice\".\nPeople portrayed\nOn 4 January 2019, Matthew Elliott, played in the film by John Heffernan, wrote an article about the film in the Financial Times summarising that \"Whatever happens, the 2016 campaign marked an important moment, and the film captures it well\".
