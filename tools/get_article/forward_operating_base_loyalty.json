Also the location was in East Baghdad. It started with 1st Cav/1st Brigade and 3RD ID came in Dec/January 2005. It also housed the prison for Political Prisoners.\nHistory\nFOB Loyalty was located in what was Saddam Hussein's Directorate of Internal Security. A handful of the hardened concrete buildings were damaged by US forces during the initial invasion of Iraq. The main building took three or four precision-guided bombs, and another precision bomb wiped out the house Saddam used when he visited the base.\nThe base included a roofed pool, with construction started by Saddam's men and completed by Kellogg Brown & Root contractors, allowing U.S. armed forces members to use. No Army and Air Force Exchange Service Facility existed on the FOB, however a small sundry store existed allowing for basic necessities.\nFOB Loyalty was attacked on April 28, 2008 by improvised Rocket-Assisted Mortars, known as lob bombs, killing a number of servicemen on the base. The base sustained repeated mortar attacks throughout 2008 and 2009.\nJoint Security Station Loyalty was again attacked by a lob bomb on 6 June 2011, killing 5 US servicemembers and injuring 12 others; another servicemember died from his wounds four days later.\nJoint Security Station Loyalty was transferred to full Iraqi Government control on August 29, 2011.\nSee also\n* List of United States Military installations in Iraq\nReferences"
