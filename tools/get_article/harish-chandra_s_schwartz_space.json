It is an analogue of the Schwartz space on a real vector space, and is used to define the space of tempered distributions on a semisimple Lie group.\nPrerequisites\nLength functions\nLet G be a topological group. A length on G is a continuous function l: G \\mapsto [0, +\\infty[, such that for all g, g' \\in G, l(gg') \\leq l(g) + l(g'). These functions are used to define spaces with rapidly decreasing functions on locally compact topological groups, since they are used to define polynomial weights  to ensure rapid decay.\nThe  \\sigma  function\nLet G be a semisimple connected Lie group with Lie algebra \\mathfrak{g}, and let K be its maximal compact subgroup. Then, the Cartan decomposition of G allows one to state that the mapping\n(k, X) \\mapsto k \\exp(X)\n,k \\in K and X \\in \\mathfrak{p} is an analytic diffeomorphism of K \\times \\mathfrak{p}  onto  G . Let b be the Killing form of \\mathfrak{g}. Its restriction on \\mathfrak{p} provides an euclidean norm \\| X \\|, K-invariant, and such that \\langle Z, (adZ)^2Y \\rangle = \\langle (ad Z)^2X, Y \\rangle for all X, Y, Z \\in \\mathfrak{p} , where \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle  is the inner product corresponding to \\| \\cdot \\|. The  \\sigma  function of G is then defined as  \\sigma(x) = \\| X \\|  for x = k \\exp(X). It is proved  that \\sigma is a length function. Of course, \\sigma is equal to 0 on K, and for all x \\in G, \\sigma(x^{-1}) = \\sigma(x).\nDefinition\nIn order to define the Harish-Chandra Schwartz space on a semisimple Lie group G, one uses the Harish-Chandra's Ξ function and the \\sigma function of G, defined in the former section.\nThe Schwartz space on G consists roughly of the functions all of whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing compared to&nbsp;Ξ. More precisely, let's suppose G is connected, and let's define \\nu_{r, g_1, g_2}(f) = \\displaystyle \\sup_{g \\in G}{| g_1 \\ast f(g) \\ast g_2 | \\Xi^{-1}(g)(1+\\sigma(g))^r} for all r \\in \\mathbb{R}, where g_1 and g_2 belong to the universal enveloping algebra U \\mathfrak{g} of \\mathfrak{g}, \\ast denotes its action on G as differential operators, and r \\in \\mathbb{R}.\nThe Harish-Chandra Schwartz space is defined as the subspace S(G) of \\mathcal{C}^\\infty(G) such that f \\in S(G) if and only if \\nu_{r, g_1, g_2}(f)  for every g_1, g_2 \\in U \\mathfrak{g}, r \\in \\mathbb{R}. Topologized with the set of such seminorms, it is a Fréchet space. Since G is connected, the set of smooth functions with compact support \\mathcal{C}_c^\\infty(G) on G is dense in S(G).\nReferences"
