It is composed of three round barrows and possibly a long, chambered barrow. The site was excavated in 1931 by George Gray. The name \"Battlegore\" comes from this site being attributed to the location of a Danish raid in 918 AD or 988 AD. At least as early as the 14th century, the site was referred to as \"Bytelgore\", a predecessor of the word \"Battlegore\". Along with three nearby round barrows it has been scheduled as an ancient monument.\nDescription\nThe most northernly of the barrows is around  in diameter and  high. It is partially surrounded by a shallow ditch with a radius of .  east of this barrow is a small mound about  wide and  high. Gray found four other mounds in addition to this small one, but he was unable to find anything that would indicate the importance of these small mounds. A large urn, found  to the east of the center of the barrow, contained the cremated remains of a human.\nJust south of this is another one of the three major round barrows, and it was around  high as of 1969. Between this and the southernmost of the three major barrows is a ring ditch, which might be another barrow. The final, southernmost barrow is around  in diameter and  in height. Unlike the previous barrow, this one has not been ploughed, and as such it is in better condition.\nThe chambered barrow is composed of three stones. The largest is  long,  wide, and  deep; the second-largest is  long,  wide, and  deep; and the smallest is  long,  wide, and  deep. According to legend, the devil and a giant's quarrel caused these stones to be thrown there.\nArtifacts\nNeolithic pottery and flint artifacts have been found at this site. Archaeologists also found bronze items, including a \"knife dagger\", a broken dagger, a rapier, a spearhead, and a winged axe. A field of Mesolithic flint artifacts has been found to the north of Battlegore.\nSee also\n* Bronze Age Britain\n* Neolithic British Isles\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/asb_mapsquare.php?condition=&ambience=&access=&sitetype=6&order=m_stname&co=&sq=ST&op=map&tl=0&tr=0&bl=0&br=0 Battlegore Burial Chamber shown on a map]"
