The attack began on 9 August with heavy artillery fire on the positions of the 27th Chepino Regiment and 9th Plovdiv Regiment. All four attacks that followed on 10, 15, 16 and 18 August were repulsed by the Second Division, and the Allies were forced to retreat to their original positions with heavy casualties.\nOther sources state that the French took Tortoise Hill (Tortue) and Doldzeli, an area of }}, but at a very high cost.
