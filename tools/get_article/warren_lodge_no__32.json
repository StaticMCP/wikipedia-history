The Lodge was named for Revolutionary War hero Joseph Warren (1741-1775).  Warren Lodge was chartered on June 10, 1807 by DeWitt Clinton, Grand Master of Masons in New York and is the oldest existing lodge in Dutchess County.\nIt was first located in Millerton and over its first 50 years met in several locations Dutchess County. In 1864, the lodge settled in Schultzville, where Theodore Schultz had left the lodge land and $2,000 to build a lodge hall. The lodge has the distinction of being the New York's only remaining Full Moon Lodge, whereby its monthly meeting date is the \"Thursday before every full moon\", rather than on a set calendar day. In 2007, the lodge celebrated its bicentennial.\nThe Masonic Hall\nWarren Lodge's Masonic Hall, is an historic two-story wooden-frame building built in 1865 in the Italianate style of architecture with a central hexagonal cupola. The first floor is a social hall while the lodge room is on the second. In the early 1900s a one-story addition was made on the rear of the building. As of 2007, the building was owned by the Town of Clinton Historical Society, which uses it for its social functions and other events and rents it out to other groups. Warren Lodge No. 32 is still able to use the building for its meetings and functions. On June 5, 2007, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \"Warren Masonic Lodge #32\".\nThe building was moved in 2011 to the nearby Town of Clinton office campus. It is located on Centre Road in Schultzville, New York.\nReferences"
