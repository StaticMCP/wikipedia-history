According to Chad's electoral code, the electoral commission must have at least two-thirds of its 31 members to constitute a quorum.\nBoycott\nThe major opposition politicians Kebzabo, Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué of the Union for Renewal and Democracy, and Ngarlejy Yorongar of the Federation, Action for the Republic, announced that they would boycott the \"election circus\" and urged voters to do so too. Their announcement followed demands for electoral reforms including the issue of new voter identification cards. They also claimed unfair conditions led to a loss in the February 2011 parliamentary elections and that the presidential election would be a \"historic fraud.\"\nConduct\nVoting stations were reported to have opened late in N'Djamena because of a delay in the arrival of voting materials and staff.\nResults\nReferences"
