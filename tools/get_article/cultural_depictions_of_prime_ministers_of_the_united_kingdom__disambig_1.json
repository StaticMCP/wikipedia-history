Of course, a lot of us knew, but we'd all forgotten it.

Hogan's science-fiction novel The Proteus Operation.\n*In Harry Turtledove's novel, The Big Switch, Eden appears as a member of a group of disgruntled MPs who are gathered together by Ronald Cartland after Britain allies with Germany in mid-1940.\n*In Harry Turtledove's Worldwar series of alternate history science-fiction novels, Eden first appears as the representative of the United Kingdom at the peace talks with the alien Race in Cairo. As it does not have nuclear weapons at that point in the story, the United Kingdom is not fully recognised by the Race, but is also too powerful for them to fully discount. Eden attempts to secure full recognition of the United Kingdom by the Race, but fails. Atvar, the Race's commander, notes that Eden is highly competent but attempting to negotiate from a position of weakness. In the succeeding series, Colonization, Eden is prime minister in 1962, leading a government which cultivates close relations with the German Reich. When Germany and the Race go to war, Eden refuses to lend British military assistance to the Reich, though formally supports German efforts against the Race.\nMusic\n*Eden is mentioned in a song by The Kinks, \"She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\", from the album Arthur (1969).\nPlays\n*Eden appears as a character in the play Never So Good (2008)—portrayed as a hysterical, pill-addicted wreck, spying on members of his own Cabinet by ordering government chauffeurs to report on their comings and goings. He is shown being overwhelmed by the chaos of the Suez Crisis and eventually forced out of office by his Conservative Party colleagues, at the urging of the American government.\n*Eden appears in Peter Morgan's stage play The Audience (2013); in the premiere, he was played by Michael Elwyn). In the 2015 West End revival version, featuring Kristin Scott Thomas as the Queen, Eden is portrayed by Scottish actor David Robb. His scene in the play is a prediction of Eden's audience with the Queen the day before the invasion of Anglo-French forces in Egypt. The conversation that takes place features Eden attempting to feed selected information to the Queen rather than the whole facts about the Suez crisis and the Queen's reaction to the proposed invasion. In the play's 2015 rewrite, the Queen makes reference to Tony Blair, seen in a flashback, and his proposal to send troops to Iraq, likening it to the conversation she'd had with Eden 50 years previously about Suez.\nTelevision\n*As Secretary of State for War in 1940, Eden authorised the setting-up of the Local Defence Volunteers (soon renamed the Home Guard). In the film of the TV sitcom ''Dad's Army'', the (fictional) Walmington-on-Sea platoon is formed in response to Eden's radio broadcast.

'Even when insulted to his face attending the show,' a biographer notes, 'Macmillan felt it was better to be mocked than ignored.' One of the sketches was revived by Cook for television. Cook would later claim that his impression of Macmillan 'was in fact extremely affectionate.  I was a great Macmillan fan.  He did have this somewhat ludicrous manner, but merely because it was the first time for some years that a living prime minister had been impersonated on the stage, a great deal of weight was attached to it.'\n*Suez 1956 (1979)\n**Richard Vernon stars as Macmillan, with Michael Gough as Eden, in a three-hour-and-ten-minute BBC television play by Ian Curteis.\n*Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981)\n**Macmillan appears as a supporting character, played by Ian Collier, in the miniseries produced by Southern Television for ITV.\n*A Letter of Resignation (1997–98)\n**Set in 1963 during the Profumo scandal, Hugh Whitemore's play A Letter of Resignation, first staged at the Comedy Theatre in October 1997, dramatises the occasion when Macmillan, staying with friends in Scotland, received a political bombshell, the letter of resignation from Profumo, his war minister. Edward Fox portrayed Macmillan with uncanny accuracy, but the play also explores the involvement of MI5 and the troubled relationship between Macmillan and his wife (played by Clare Higgins) who had made no secret of her adultery with the wayward Tory MP, Robert Boothby. The play was directed by Christopher Morahan.\n*''Eden's Empire'' (2006)\n**Macmillan was played by Kevin Quarmby in Gemma Fairlie's production of James Graham's play ''Eden's Empire at the Finborough Theatre, London, in 2006.\n*Never So Good (2008)\n**Never So Good is a four-act play by Howard Brenton, a portrait of Macmillan against a backdrop of fading Empire, two world wars, the Suez crisis, adultery and Tory politics at the Ritz. Brenton paints the portrait of a brilliant, witty but complex man, tragically out of kilter with his times, an Old Etonian who eventually loses his way in a world of shifting values.  The play premiered at the National Theatre in March 2008, directed by Howard Davies with Jeremy Irons as Macmillan.\n*The Crown (2016)\n**Macmillan is portrayed by Anton Lesser in the Netflix series The Crown.\n*Pennyworth (2019)\n**Macmillan is portrayed by Richard Clothier in the Epix series Pennyworth.\n*Nolly (2023)\n**Macmillan is portrayed by Nicholas Gecks in the ITVX miniseries Nolly, dramatising the life of Noele Gordon.\nAlec Douglas-Home\n*The Night They Tried to Kidnap the Prime Minister (2009), played by Tim McInnerny – a BBC Radio 4 drama based on a real-life kidnapping attempt in 1964.\n* The Crown (2016), played by David Annen.\nHarold Wilson\nTelevision\n* The Lavender List'' (2006), played by Kenneth Cranham – a BBC Four fictionalised account by Francis Wheen of the Wilson Government of 1974–1976, with Gina McKee as Marcia Williams and Celia Imrie as Wilson's wife. The play concentrated on Wilson and Williams' relationship and her conflict with the Downing Street Press Secretary Joe Haines.\n* The Plot Against Harold Wilson (2006), played by James Bolam – aired on BBC Two on 16 March 2006. The drama detailed previously unseen evidence that rogue elements of MI5 and the British military plotted to take down the Labour Government, believing Wilson to be a Soviet spy.\n* Longford (2006), played by Robert Pugh – Channel 4 drama on the life of Lord Longford. In one scene, Wilson was seen dismissing Longford from his cabinet in 1968, in part because of the adverse publicity the latter was receiving for his public campaign supporting Myra Hindley, then incarcerated for her involvement in the Moors Murders.\n* In series 3 of The Crown, Harold Wilson is portrayed by Jason Watkins.\n* In Stonehouse, a dramatisation of the career of John Stonehouse, Wilson is portrayed by Kevin McNally.\nFilm\n* The Boat That Rocked (2009), played by Stephen Moore (character not actually addressed or credited by name, only as 'Prime Minister')\n* Made in Dagenham (2010), played by John Sessions\nOther\n* A Viking in the Asterix story Asterix and the Great Crossing (1975) is named Haraldwilssen in the English translation, because the translators felt his physical features resembled Wilson.\n* The Audience (stage play, 2013, played in the premiere production by Richard McCabe)\n* In The Alteration by Kingsley Amis, set in a parallel universe dominated by the papacy, Pope John XXIV is depicted as a Machiavellian Yorkshireman (a thinly veiled portrayal of Wilson) who controls the population of Europe through Malthusian means including the use of bacteriological warfare and war with the Ottoman Empire.\n* He is briefly referenced in the Beatles song \"Taxman\", together with his political opponent Edward Heath.\nEdward Heath\n* Sunday (2002), played by Corin Redgrave\n* The Long Walk to Finchley (2008), played by Samuel West\n* Margaret (2009), played by Nigel Le Vaillant\n* The Iron Lady (2011), played by John Sessions\n* The Crown (2016), played by Michael Maloney\nJames Callaghan\n* The Audience (stage play, 2013, played in the premiere production by David Peart)\nMargaret Thatcher\nJohn Major\nTony Blair\nGordon Brown\nDavid Cameron\nTheresa May\n* Gillian Bevan played Theresa May in the second series of the Channel 4 comedy The Windsors.\n* Jacqueline King played Theresa May in the 2017 docudrama Theresa v Boris: How May Became PM which chronicled the 2016 Conservative leadership election\nBoris Johnson\nReferences"
