This implied that strange classical bodies that would not allow other bodies to reach their surfaces, such as what we know call white holes, could exist.\n* 1784&nbsp;— John Michell discusses classical bodies which have escape velocities greater than the speed of light\n* 1795&nbsp;— Pierre Laplace discusses classical bodies which have escape velocities greater than the speed of light\n* 1798&nbsp;— Henry Cavendish measures the gravitational constant G\n* 1876&nbsp;— William Kingdon Clifford suggests that the motion of matter may be due to changes in the geometry of space\n20th century\nBefore 1960s\n* 1909&nbsp;— Albert Einstein, together with Marcel Grossmann, starts to develop a theory which would bind metric tensor gik, which defines a space geometry, with a source of gravity, that is with mass\n* 1910&nbsp;— Hans Reissner and Gunnar Nordström define Reissner–Nordström singularity, Hermann Weyl solves special case for a point-body source\n*1915&nbsp;— Albert Einstein presents (David Hilbert presented this independently five days earlier in Göttingen) the complete Einstein field equations at the Prussian Academy meeting in Berlin on 25 November 1915\n* 1916&nbsp;— Karl Schwarzschild solves the Einstein vacuum field equations for uncharged spherically symmetric non-rotating systems\n* 1917&nbsp;— Paul Ehrenfest gives conditional principle a three-dimensional space\n* 1918&nbsp;— Hans Reissner and Gunnar Nordström solve the Einstein–Maxwell field equations for charged spherically symmetric non-rotating systems\n* 1918&nbsp;— Friedrich Kottler gets Schwarzschild solution without Einstein vacuum field equations\n* 1923&nbsp;— George David Birkhoff proves that the Schwarzschild spacetime geometry is the unique spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein vacuum field equations\n* 1931&nbsp;— Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar calculates, using special relativity, that a non-rotating body of electron-degenerate matter above a certain limiting mass (at 1.4 solar masses) has no stable solutions\n* 1939&nbsp;— Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder calculate the gravitational collapse of a pressure-free homogeneous fluid sphere into a black hole\n*1939&nbsp;- Using the work of Richard Chace Tolman, Robert Oppenheimer and George Volkoff calculate the upper mass limit of a cold, non-rotating neutron star to be approximately 0.7 solar masses.\n* 1958&nbsp;— David Finkelstein theorises that the Schwarzschild radius is a causality barrier: an event horizon of a black hole\n1960s\n* 1963&nbsp;— Roy Kerr solves the Einstein vacuum field equations for uncharged symmetric rotating systems, deriving the Kerr metric for a rotating black hole\n* 1963&nbsp;— Maarten Schmidt discovers and analyzes the first quasar, 3C 273, as a highly red-shifted active galactic nucleus, a billion light years away\n* 1964&nbsp;— Yakov Zel'dovich and independently Edwin Salpeter propose that accretion discs around supermassive black holes are responsible for the huge amounts of energy radiated by quasars\n* 1964&nbsp;— Hong-Yee Chiu coins the word quasar for a 'quasi-stellar radio source' in his article in Physics Today\n* 1964&nbsp;— The first recorded use of the term \"black hole\" in writing, by journalist Ann Ewing\n* 1965&nbsp;— Roger Penrose proves that an imploding star will necessarily produce a singularity once it has formed an event horizon\n* 1965&nbsp;— Ezra T.
