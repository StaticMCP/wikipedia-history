The campus is primarily dedicated to STEM courses. The campus serves the far north of Colorado Springs and is located off of the North Gate of the United States Air Force Academy.\nThe campus was opened in the fall of 2005 to 5th and 6th grade students. In the fall of 2006, this was expanded to grades PK-7. In 2007, 8th and 9th were opened, and the first graduating class of DCC walked across the stage four years later in May 2011.\nThe school offers the IB Primary Years Program, IB Middle Years Program, IB Career-related Program, and IB Diploma Program. DCC became an International Baccalaureate World School in May 2008.\nThe campus was designed by Antoine Predock.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
