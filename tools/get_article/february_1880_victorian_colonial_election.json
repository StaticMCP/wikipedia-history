All 86 seats in 55 electorates in the Legislative Assembly were up for election, though two seats were uncontested.\nThere were 31 single-member, 20 two-member and 5 three-member electorates.\nThe liberal (or protectionist) government of Graham Berry was narrowly defeated by the Constitutionalist (moderate liberal) opposition led by James Service, who formed a new government on March 5.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-bottom:0\"\n|+ Legislative Assembly (FPTP)\n! style=\"width:10px;\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Swing\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Change\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;background:#CEF2CE\" | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Constitutionalist\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 111,395\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 50.29\n| style=\"width:45px;\"|\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 49\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Liberal (Protectionist)\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 101,146\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 45.66\n| style=\"width:45px;\"|\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 34\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Independent\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 8,984\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 4.06\n| style=\"width:45px;\"|\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 3\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;Totals\n| 221,525\n|\n|\n| 86\n|\n|}\nAftermath\nAlthough James Service won the February 1880 election with a workable majority, he remained Premier for only six months after an unsuccessful attempt to reform the Legislative Council.  The Service Reform Bill provided for a wider Legislative Council franchise and a double dissolution if the Council twice rejected a bill passed by the Assembly in two consecutive sessions (followed by a joint sitting of the Houses). In June 1880 a motion for the second reading of the reform bill in the Legislative Assembly was lost by two votes, after which Service was granted a dissolution in the full confidence he would win the subsequent election.\nSee also\n* Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, 1880–1883\nReferences"
