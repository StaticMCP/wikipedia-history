Known primarily by its shortened name, \"Asso\", it was founded in March 1928. The organization produced posters, placards, and propaganda graphics for Communist organizations.\nHistory\nThe Rote Fahne reported on 19 June 1928 that the Asso had been founded as a \"brother organization\" to the Association of Revolutionary Artists of Russia. In spring 1931, the name was changed from \"Assoziation\" to \"Bund\" (\"Federation\").\nLeft-wing artists had already formed groups, such as the November Group, Dadaist groups, or from 1924 to 1926, the Red Group, with which George Grosz, John Heartfield and Rudolf Schlichter were involved. Heinrich Vogeler had also formed the Arbeitsgemeinschaft kommunistischer Künstler (\"Working Group of Communist Artists\"). Further impetus to form a larger organization came from the \"Central Atelier for Visual Propaganda\", an arm of the KPD offices at the Karl-Liebknecht-Haus in Berlin.\nSeveral groups joined the Asso. The , where artist Gregor Gog was active, joined the Asso in 1931. In 1932, the group \"The Moderns\" (\"Die Zeitgemäßen\"), headed by Oskar Nerlinger and previously called \"The Abstracts\", joined as well. The Asso also embraced Franz Wilhelm Seiwert's group of progressive artists, the Cologne Progressives, and the \"Collective for Socialist Building\".\nThe Asso published a journal called Der Stoßtrupp and its first exhibition was in Berlin in 1929. For many Communist artists, art was a \"weapon\" to be used rallying the masses to the class struggle. Accordingly, the Asso produced placards, posters, propaganda art and banners for the Communist Party, Rote Hilfe and other organizations.\nThe 1932 logo of Antifaschistische Aktion was designed by  and  for the Asso and since the 1980s has been widely used in modified form in Germany and globally by Antifa groups.\nThe organization, with 800 members, was banned after the Nazis seized power in 1933.\nNotable members\n* Karl von Appen, 1932\n* , 1929\n* , 1928 (Berlin)\n* Rudolf Bergander, 1930 (Dresden)\n* , Brotherhood of Vagabonds\n* Erich Arnold Bischof\n* , 1929?
