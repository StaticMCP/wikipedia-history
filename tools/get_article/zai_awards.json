In the early phase, the annual ceremonies were held in association with the local Music Fund (HF) and International Federation of the Phonographic Industry Slovakia (SNS IFPI). For that reason, their follow-up equivalents were frequently renamed; once after the American Gramies (1996–1997).\nFollowing a 1997 protest of the U.S. NARAS management against the Czech music awards, also called likewise, the Slovak organization decided to change the adopted name too, renaming then trophies after the Artmedia Music Academy (1998–2000), also established by ZAI.\nIn 2001, the event was separately rebranded by SNS IFPI for the Aurel Awards (2001–2007), for a change, prior to their hiatus. Restored by the ZAI union in 2011 under their original title, the current awards are presented on a biennial basis, honoring mostly the hosting achievements in the music genre since. As of 2015, twenty annual ceremonies were held, with thirteen credited to ZAI, and seven to now discontinued SNS IFPI.\nHistory\n* 1990–2000: ZAI Awards\n** 1996–1997: As Grammy Awards (Grammy West '96 ▪ Grammy Slovakia '97)\n** 1998–2000: As Artmedia Awards\n* 2001–2007: Aurel Awards held instead\n* 2008–2010: Not held\n* 2011–present: ZAI Awards (held biennially)\nCategories\nCurrent awards\n* Vocal Artist or Ensemble • Held since, excluding 1998–2000 and 2011.\n* New Artist • Held since, excluding 2011.\n* Album • Held since 1991, excluding 2011.\n* Radio Station • Held since 2011.\n* Radio Host • Held since 2011.\n* Music Festival • Held since 2011.\n* Music Club • Held since 2011.\n* Music Presenter • Held since 2011.\n; Special awards\n* Hall of Fame • Lifetime achievement award, formerly known as Grand Prix (1990–2000), given for outstanding contributions to the industry, mainly for performing.\nRetired awards\n* Vocal Ensemble • Held in 1998–2000.\n* Vocal Artist • Held in 1998–1999.\n* Vocal Male Artist • Held in 2000.\n* Vocal Female Artist • Held in 2000.\n* Record\n* Song\n* Producer • Held in 1991–2000.\n* Music Video\n* Writer • Given for lyrics.
