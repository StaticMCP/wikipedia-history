The Rainbow Warriors played their home games at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu. They competed in the West Division of the Mountain West Conference and were led by fourth-year head coach Nick Rolovich, in what was his final season before his abrupt resignation in January 2020.\nThe Rainbow Warriors had their most successful season since 2010. They finished 10–5, 5–3 to finish tied for first in the West Division, claiming the division championship with a 14–11 win over San Diego State. They advanced to the Mountain West Championship, where they lost to Boise State, but won the Hawaii Bowl over BYU, 38–34.\nThis was Hawaii’s first ten-win season since 2010, and just the seventh in program history. Nick Rolovich was also named Mountain West Coach of the Year, the fourth UH coach to receive that honor.\nPreseason\nAward watch lists\nListed in the order that they were released\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Maxwell Award\n|Cole McDonald\n|align=center|QB\n|align=center|JR\n|-\n|Davey O'Brien Award\n|Cole McDonald\n|align=center|QB\n|align=center|JR\n|-\n|Doak Walker Award\n|Dayton Furuta\n|align=center|RB\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Fred Biletnikoff Award\n|Cedric Byrd II\n|align=center|WR\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|JoJo Ward\n|align=center|WR\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|Rimington Trophy\n|Kohl Levao\n|align=center|C\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|Lou Groza Award\n|Ryan Meskell\n|align=center|K\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|Wuerffel Trophy\n|Kaimana Padello\n|align=center|DL\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|rowspan=6|Polynesian College Football Player of the Year\n|Dayton Furuta\n|align=center|RB\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|Kohl Levao\n|align=center|OL\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|Solomon Matautia\n|align=center|LB\n|align=center|SR\n|-\n|Kaimana Padello\n|align=center|DL\n|align=center|JR\n|-\n|Penei Pavihi\n|align=center|LB\n|align=center|JR\n|-\n|Solo Vaipulu\n|align=center|OL\n|align=center|SO\n|-\n|Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award\n|Cole McDonald\n|align=center|QB\n|align=center|JR\n|-\n|Manning Award\n|Cole McDonald\n|align=center|QB\n|align=center|JR\n|-\n|}\nMountain West media days\nThe Mountain West media days were held from July 23–24, 2019 at Green Valley Ranch in Henderson, NV.\nMedia poll\nThe preseason poll was released at the Mountain West media days on July 23, 2019.
