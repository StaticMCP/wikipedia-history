The book provided a history of the Slavic peoples.\nThe historical context of the work is the Long Turkish War and the loss of the position of the southern Slavs in the rule of the Ottoman Empire after the hanging of Michael Kantakouzenos Şeytanoğlu (March 3, 1578) and the assassination of Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (October 11, 1579). The Venetian Republic, through its protégés, Validе Sultanas, succeeded in displacing the Republic of Dubrovnik from its position in the Mediterranean trade by constructing a port in Split.\nAfter Peter the Great declared himself Emperor, his first order was to translate into Russian and publish this book. The book played a huge role in the emergence of pan-Slavism.\nIt is unclear how much truth there is in the book. Historian Solange Bujan argues that Orbini created a false historical document based on contemporary unpublished sources and Benedictine texts, such as excerpts from recently published works by Byzantine historians, intended to lend credibility to the story, and that the real and authentic medieval historical texts are the Dubrovnik chronicle Annales Ragusini Anonymi and the text Regum Dalmatiae et Croatiae gesta by Marko Marulić, which has so far been considered a concise overview of Orbini's The Realm of the Slavs.\nFurther reading\n* \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_J5DwAAQBAJ&dq=%22Kingdom+of+the+Slavs%22+%22Orbini%22&pg=PA217 Indetermi-Nation: Narrative identity and symbolic politics in early modern Illyrism]\" by Zrinka Blažević, in Whose Love of Which Country?: Composite States, National Histories and Patriotic Discourses in Early Modern East Central Europe], Koninklijke Brill (2010)\n* [https://archive.org/details/croatianationfor0000tann/page/44/mode/2up/search/orbini?q=%22kingdom+of+the+slavs%22+orbini Croatia: A Nation Formed in War] by Marcus Tanner, Yale University Press (1997)\n* [https://archive.org/details/1daskalovRTchavdarMEdEntangledHistoriesOfTheBalkans/page/n241/mode/2up/search/orbini?q=%22kingdom+of+the+slavs%22+orbini Entangled Histories Of The Balkans - Volume One] ed. by Roumen Dontchev Daskalov and Tchavdar Marinov, Koninklijke Brill (2013)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=wEF5oN5erE0C&dq=%22kingdom+of+the+slavs%22+orbini&pg=PA226 When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans: A Study of Identity in Pre-Nationalist Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in the Medieval and Early-Modern Periods] by Larry Wolff, Stanford University Press (2002)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=RGRpAAAAMAAJ&q=orbini Our Kingdom Come: The Counter-Reformation, the Republic of Dubrovnik, and the Liberation of the Balkan Slavs] by Zdenko Zlatar, East European Monographs (1992)\nReferences\nSee also\n* Grandfather Ivan\n* Moscow, third Rome"
