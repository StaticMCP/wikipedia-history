The title was more often Envoy extraordinary than ambassador. (The first two on this list, Bulstrode Whitelocke and William Jephson, in fact represented Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth of England which at the time displaced the Monarchy.)\nThe position was not always a continuous or permanent one, and there was sometimes no diplomatic representation between the two countries.\nFor ambassadors from the Court of St. James's to Sweden after the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, see List of ambassadors of Great Britain to Sweden.\nEnvoys Extraordinary of England\n*1653–1654: Bulstrode Whitelocke\n*1657: William Jephson\n*1664–1666: Hon.
