On a polished surface made up of 36 elements, two of which with German and Polish texts on opposite sides, and to be walked on, are positioned in three rows 30 rough-hewn granite blocks. A gravel path is leading to the front side of the sculpture with which it forms a small valley. The stone used is exclusively Polish Strzegom granite. The memorial is dedicated to the 6000 Poles deported from the 1944 Warsaw Uprising to the Nazi concentration camp in Neuengamme and was initiated by the Polish community in Hamburg commemorating at the same time the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II. Polish sculptor Jan de Weryha-Wysoczański created the monument pro bono.\nReferences\nExternal links"
