The Ohio primary was a semi-open primary and awarded 169 delegates towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of which 146 were pledged delegates allocated based on the results of the primary.\nVice president Al Gore won the primary in a landslide with almost 73% of the vote and 109 delegates, while senator Bill Bradley gained just shy of 25% of the vote, secured 37 delegates, and won his first and only congressional district. The remaining 2% went to one other candidate, Lyndon LaRouche Jr. Gore did not cross the necessary majority of 2,171 delegates to officially win the Democratic nomination after Super Tuesday, but Bradley would withdraw three days later, leaving Gore as the presumptive nominee.\nProcedure\nOhio was one of 15 states and one territory holding primaries on Super Tuesday.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 7:30&nbsp;a.m. until 7:30&nbsp;p.m. In the semi-open primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 146 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 4 and 7 were allocated to each of the state's 19 congressional districts and another 19 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 32 at-large delegates.\nDistrict delegates to the national convention were planned to be elected at post-primary caucuses on April 16, 2020; should candidates have received more delegates based on the results of the primary than delegate candidates presented at the time. The state executive committee of the party subsequently would have met on May 9, 2020, to vote on the 32 at-large and 19 pledged PLEO delegates for the Democratic National Convention. The delegation also included 20 unpledged PLEO delegates: 12 members of the Democratic National Committee, 8 members of Congress (Representatives Tony Hall, Ted Strickland, Marcy Kaptur, Dennis Kucinich, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Sherrod Brown, Thomas Sawyer, and James Traficant), and 3 add-ons.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Bill Bradley\n*Lyndon LaRouche Jr.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 Ohio Democratic presidential primary\n!
