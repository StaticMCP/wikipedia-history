In the , Cremorne had a population of 19 people.\nGeography\nCremorne is on the northern bank of the Pioneer River in the centre of Mackay. The Forgan Smith Bridge crosses from central Mackay over the Pioneer River and through Cremorne to North Mackay. The Pioneer River forms the southern boundary of the locality and Barnes Creek forms the northern boundary. Most of the western part of the locality is parkland (largely undeveloped); there is a small number of industrial buildings around the Forgan Smith Bridge.\nHistory\nArriving in 1863, John Greenwood Barnes was the first settler on the northern band of the Pioneer River. He experimented with growing edible tropical plants such as breadfruit, mango, guava, pineapples etc. on behalf of botanist Ferdinand von Mueller, the curator of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens. However his greatest success was with coconut palms which he first planted in 1868 and then expanded to a plantation of 1,200 trees.\nIn 1884, Barnes erected a two-storey hotel with a promenade roof. Working with his father-in-law William Seaward, he developed pleasure gardens called Cremorne Gardens thought to be modelled on the Cremorne Gardens in Melbourne (Barnes had lived in Victoria before moving to Queensland). In January 1898 the hotel was damaged by Cyclone Eline and then demolished by the January 1918 cyclone.\nBarnes Creek is a watercourse (). It was modified on 24/09/1999. Reportedly named after ?? Barnes (    -    ), local selector.\nDemographics\nIn the , Cremorne had a population of 33 people.\nIn the , Cremorne had a population of 19 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Cremorne.
