He is a member of the prominent Schwarzenbach family.\nEarly life and education\nSchwarzenbach was born in 1971 in Zürich, Switzerland, to François Schwarzenbach (b. 1939) and Sybille Schwarzenbach (née Sigg). His father is a businessman and heir to Robert Schwarzenbach & Co, formerly the world's largest silk concern. He has two younger sisters and a brother.\nHe is a great-nephew of Annemarie Schwarzenbach and a great-great-grandson of Renée Schwarzenbach-Wille. Hence he is also of patrilineal descent of Ulrich Wille and Robert Miles Sloman. He is only very distantly related to Urs Schwarzenbach, proprietor of the Dolder Grand Hotel. He has Swiss, German and English ancestry.\nIn 1990, Schwarzenbach completed his Matura, at Freies Gymnasium Zürich and studied Modern History at Balliol College, Oxford completing a Bachelor of Arts in 1994. He received his PhD in 1997 from European University Institute.\nCareer\nBetween 1998 and 2000, Schwarzenbach worked as literary editor at Scalo Publishers, from 2000 to 2004 as Research fellow in Oxford, Rome and Essen. From 2004 to 2009, he engaged in independent work as author and curator. From 2009 to 2011 he was a curator at the Swiss National Museum. In 2012 he became a docent and later professor at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.\nIn 2021, he founded a studio for history, primarily engaging in research and book projects. Notable projects include the curation of the Stehli Silks archives. He is currently also a board member of Robert Schwarzenbach & Co, which today is primarily active in real estate management and he concurrently is vice president of the Zurich Silk Society (which is a union of former and current silk manufacturing and merchant companies).\nLiterature\nAuthor\n* Emil Schulthess: Fotografien 1950–1990.
