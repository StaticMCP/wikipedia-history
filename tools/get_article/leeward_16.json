The company produced it as a kit boat for amateur construction, which the building time estimated at 10–15 hours. The company went out of business in 1987 and the boat is now out of production.\nDesign\nThe Leeward 16 is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig with anodized aluminum spars. The hull features a spooned raked stem, a conventional transom, a rounded, transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable centerboard. It displaces  and has an angular cuddy cabin for stowage.\nThe boat has a draft of  with the centerboard extended and  with it retracted. With the non-folding rudder removed it has a draft of , allowing beaching. Ground transportation on a trailer is facilitated by a hinged tabernacle that permits easy lowering of the mast by easing the forestay.\nA motor mount was a factory option, allowing fitting a small outboard motor of  for docking and maneuvering. Other factory options included sails, trim molding and\nrunning lights for night operation. Foam for hull buoyancy was recommended to make the boat unsinkable.\nFor sailing the design is equipped with mainsail roller reefing around the boom. The jib sheets, mainsheet and the centerboard raising and lowering lines are all controlled from the cockpit. The supplied assembly kit included stainless steel and anodized aluminum fittings.\nThe design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 112.3 and is normally raced with a crew of two sailors.\nOperational history\nIn a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \"Luger Industries buil[t] kit boats [that] rang[e] in length from 8 feet\nto 30 feet. The Leeward 16 is typical.\"\nSailrite describes the design, \"the Luger Leeward 16 has plenty of cockpit space for the family and enough room in the small cuddy cabin for a picnic basket and cooler. With a modest sail plan the Luger Leeward 16 is an excellent boat for those learning to sail.\"\nSee also\n*List of sailing boat types\nSimilar sailboats\n*Balboa 16\n*Catalina 16.5\n*DS-16\n*Laguna 16\n*Martin 16\n*Nordica 16\n*Tanzer 16\nReferences"
