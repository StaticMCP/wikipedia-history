His father, John Santry, was an immigrant from Ireland who worked in Chicago as a stonemason.  His mother, Ellen, was also an Irish immigrant.\nProfessional baseball\nSantry made his debut in Major League Baseball on August 7, 1884, with the Detroit Wolverines.  His major league career lasted less than a week, with his last major league game on August 12, 1884.  Santry compiled a .182 batting average and scored one run in 22 at bats for the Wolverines.\nIn 1886, Santry played minor league baseball for Oshkosh in the Northwestern League and the Memphis Grays of the Southern Association.
