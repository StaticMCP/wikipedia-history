The current chair is Eric Wetzels.\nHistory\nThe VVD chair is the head of the party board and leads several committees. The duties of the chair are typically concerned with the party membership as a whole, and the activities of the party organization, the internal party governance, its finances and the Telders Foundation think tank.\nThe Chair plays an important role in strategies to recruit and retain members, in campaign fundraising.\nDue to a separation of power in the VVD's structure the chair is relatively weak and merely controls the party organization.\nThe leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy is the most senior politician within the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and decides over the party's political course.\nChairs\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!colspan=3|Chair\n!Term of office\n!Age as Chair\n!Position(s) as Chair\n!Further
