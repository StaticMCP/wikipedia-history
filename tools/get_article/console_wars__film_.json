Harris, exploring the 1990s console wars between Nintendo and Sega and Sega's rise and fall in the home console market. Based on Harris's 2014 book Console Wars, it was the first original film for CBS All Access, which became Paramount+.\nPremise\nConsole Wars examines the late 1980s and early 1990s rivalry between gaming giants Sega and Nintendo. The documentary highlights Sega's strategies to challenge Nintendo and its eventual decline by decade's end.\nDevelopment\nIn 2010, Blake J. Harris received a retro Sega Genesis console, sparking nostalgia and curiosity about the console wars. Noting the lack of media attention on the topic, he began researching. In 2012, Harris and his business partner, Jonah Tulis, met with producers and game enthusiasts Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who supported publishing a book and producing a documentary. Producer Scott Rudin secured financing through a book auction with HarperCollins and helped Sony acquire documentary rights.\nThe 2014 Sony Pictures hack, linked to North Korea and possibly triggered by Seth Rogen's film The Interview, leaked Sony's plans, including Spider-Man's integration into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, threatening the documentary's progress. Sony transferred the rights to Legendary studios in 2018, and the documentary premiered on CBS All Access in 2020.\nHarris used a VHD-to-DVD converter to obtain archival footage depicting the Nintendo-Sega rivalry.\nReception\nCritics noted the documentary's late introduction of Nintendo and its heavy focus on Sega, describing it as intriguing but unfocused. Others praised the interviews for capturing the unique spirit of Sega America's employees. The film was described as a nostalgic David and Goliath story.\nSee also\n*\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
