      "text": "# Edward Yum\n\n}}\nEdward Yum Liang-Hsien (; born 1979) is a member of the Hong Kong pro-democracy camp People Power.  He is the son of former Legislative Council member Yum Sin-ling, who once held a pro-Kuomintang party in Hong Kong called the 123 Democratic Alliance.\nCareer\nYum is best known for his participation at the Victoria Park, City Forum.  He is known for shouting at pro-establishment figures, which earned him the nickname \"Big brother of Victoria park\".  He has also been called the Grass Mud Horse.\nControversy\nLicense issue\nQuestions have been raised about Yum being described as a licensed Securities and Futures Commission representative when his permit was expired.  In his weekly column and the website of iMoney magazine and the League of Social Democrats website, he has been described as a representative.\nSex scandal accusations\nIn mid December 2010 a 29-year-old woman in Sha Tin accused Yum of rape and indecent assault.  After the first arrest Yum considered suing a local newspaper and a woman for their comments since this arrest.  On 20 December 2010 a 19-year-old woman in Central filed a police report against Yum for sexual assault. This also came at a time after 30 pan-democrats resigned over the dissatisfaction with a leadership meeting with Beijing.  The group was extremely fragmented with internal political issues.\nBy May 2011, Yum was no longer under investigation by the police due to a complete lack of evidence.\n2018 Legislative By-election\nOn 23 January 2018, Yum declared that he would run in the Hong Kong Island by-election triggered by the disqualification of Demosisto's Nathan Law. Yum received 3580 votes and was not elected.\nSee also\n*Hong Kong Localism Power (2015)\nReferences"
