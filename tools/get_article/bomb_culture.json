      "text": "# Bomb Culture\n\nBomb Culture is a book by Jeff Nuttall about the counter-culture in London, which was first published in 1968.\nSummary\nIt reflected the influence of the threat of nuclear war, while describing the importance of pop music like the Beatles and countercultural figures like the Beat Generation. Nuttall believed in the liberatory power of imagination and \"affect\", which he hoped could bring about social change.\nPublication history\nA new, expanded edition was published by Strange Attractor Press in December 2018. It features a new foreword by Iain Sinclair, a new afterword by Maria Fusco and an introduction by the editors, Jay Jeff Jones and Douglas Field, which includes archival images.\nReception and legacy\nKirkus Reviews called Nuttall \"a powerhouse communicator or overcommunicator with all the sprawling intellectual continuity and splashy effects that is implied\", and suggested that the book was primarily aimed at Nuttall's own generation.\nThe Guardian in 2004 said it \"remains a primary source and manifesto for the post-Hiroshima generation\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://monoskop.org/File:Nuttall_Jeff_Bomb_Culture.jpg Bomb Culture - book cover]\n* [http://hqinfo.blogspot.co.uk/2005/08/jeff-nutall-bomb-culture-and-beyond.html Bomb Culture and Beyond] - extracts from a 1984 interview\n* [http://www.thepeanutsclub.blogspot.com A small part of sixties counter-culture - includes Jeff Nuttall]"
