In the , Hail Creek had a population of 179 people.\nGeography\nThe Hail Creek coal mine is within the locality (). It is operated by Glencore Australia.\nThe Suttor Developmental Road (State Route 11) runs through from the south-east (Nebo) to the south-west (Kemmis).\nThe Hail Creek branch of the Goonyella railway line enters the locality from the south-west (Kemmis) and terminates at the Hail Creek railway station on a balloon loop at the Hail Creek coal mine ().\nThe Hail Creek Mine also has a heliport to the north-west of the railway station ().\nHail Creek Mine is an heliport ().\nThe locality contains the following mountains (from north to south):\n* Bon Hill ()\n* Mount Cona ()\n* Mount Andrew ()\n* Mount Robert ()\n* Mount Cristoe ()\n* The Peak ()\nThe Homevale National Park is in the north-east of the locality extending into neighbouring Mount Britton (). The national park features cliffs and peaks in a vast dry landscape. There are a number of important fossil sites.\nApart from the national park and the coal mine, the land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation with a small amount of crop growing in the east of the locality around Oaky Creek.\nHistory\nHard granite formations were created by a series of volcanic eruptions 30 million years ago which covered older basalt rocks with lava. As the basalt erodes more easily, the remaining formations are visually dramatic. Fossils found in the area have been dated back to the Permian period  between 280-225 million years ago.\nHomevale National Park was previously the Homevale pastoral station where cattle were grazed. Te national park was gazetted in 1995 under the Nature Conservation Act 1992 by regulation, Nature Conservation (Protected Areas) Amendment (No.5) 1995. Its area was extended in 1996, 2009, and 2024. As at 2024, the homestead of the Homevale pastoral station remains within the national park on Homevale Homestead Road () and conservation plans are to be developed for it.\nDemographics\nIn the , Hail Creek had a population of 148 people.\nIn the , Hail Creek had a population of 179 people.\nEconomy\nApart from the mine, the locality has a number of homesteads (from north to south):\n* Exevale ()\n* Carrinyah ()\n* Fort Cooper () with its airstrip ().\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Hail Creek. The nearest government primary schools are Nebo State School in neighbouring Nebo to the south-east, Glenden State School in neighbouring Glenden to the west, and Eungella State School in Eungella to the north. The nearest government secondary school is Glenden State School (to Year 12), but some parts of Hail Creek would be too distant from this school and the alternatives would be distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
