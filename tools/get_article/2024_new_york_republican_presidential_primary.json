He won every county and congressional district in the state, performing best in the Staten Island and Staten Island-based 11th district. Both the county and the district were the only ones in New York City to back him over his Democratic opponent in both 2016 and 2020. He got his worst result in the 12th district. Trump showed his poorest performance in Tompkins County against Nikki Haley.\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-datatable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!
