It is located in Dangkao Section, southwest Phnom Penh. The university is operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.\nHistory\nIn 1964, the Royal University of Agronomy Science (; ) was founded by then Prince Norodom Sihanouk. It was one of the nine royal universities established to improve Cambodian higher education development. It was entirely closed during the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979.\nIn 1980, it was reopened with the new name of Institute of Agricultural Education () to educate government staff to work in fields such as forestry, animal production, veterinary medicine, crop production, and agricultural machinery. In 1984, it became known as Institute of Agricultural Technology (). It offered bachelor's degrees in Agronomy, Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Agricultural Engineering, Forestry and Fishery. Obtaining assistance from abroad, professors were from Soviet Union so all lectures were taught in Russian. In 1990, the support from the Soviet Union ended so the curriculum was converted to Khmer language.\nIn 1994, it officially changed the name to Royal University of Agriculture. After that, other bachelor's degree programs were introduced. In 2002, graduate degree programs in agricultural science-related majors were launched.\nRUA is accredited by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. RUA offers bachelor's, masters and doctorate degrees. It is a leading contributor to Cambodia's human resources in the fields of agriculture and rural development.\nAcademics\nThe Royal University of Agriculture comprises nine faculties, a school, and four research centers:\n* Department of Foundation Year\n* Faculty of Agronomy\n* Faculty of Animal Science\n* Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\n* Faculty of Forestry\n* Faculty of Fisheries\n* Faculty of Agricultural Engineering\n* Faculty of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development\n* Faculty of Agro-Industry\n* Faculty of Land Management and Land Administration\n* Faculty of Rubber Sciences\n* Graduate School\n* Hun Sen Research Center\n* IT Centre\n* Language Centre\n* Center for Sustainable Agriculture\n* Center for Agricultural and Environmental Studies\n* Center for Livestock Development Studies\n* Ecosystem Services and Land Use (ECOLAND) research center\nSee also\n* Agriculture in Cambodia\n* Education in Cambodia\n* Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Cambodia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.rua.edu.kh/ Royal University of Agriculture official site]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121114052844/http://www.maff.gov.kh/en/ Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries]"
