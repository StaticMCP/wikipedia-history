His younger brothers were the eccentric Stephen Tennant and David Tennant, the founder of the Gargoyle Club.\nBorn at Stockton House, Stockton, Wiltshire, which his father had just leased from Major-General A. G. Yeatman-Biggs, Tennant was educated at Winchester College. At the age of seventeen he left school and joined the Grenadier Guards in the early weeks of the World War I.\nTennant was known to friends and family as 'Bim', but the origin of this nickname is unknown. It has been suggested that he was engaged before his death to Nancy Cunard, but a reliable source, Colin Tennant, 3rd Baron Glenconner, responded in a letter to a question on this point and stated that the suggestion was incorrect; Lois Gordon, Nancy Cunard's biographer, in her extensive research, never came across any hint of such an alliance either.\nDeath and memorial\nTennant is buried at Guillemont in France in the Guillemont Road Cemetery, close to the remains of his friend and relative Raymond Asquith (eldest son of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith), who was killed the week before. The inscription on his gravestone reads: KILLED IN ACTION IN HIS TWENTIETH YEAR.\nA memorial to Tennant, sculpted by Allan G. Wyon, was erected in Salisbury Cathedral. There are two inscriptions on the memorial, one above the low-relief portrait of Tennant, and one below.\n]]\nThe upper inscription reads: \"When things were at their worst he would go up and down in the trenches cheering the men, when danger was greatest his smile was loveliest.\"\nThe inscription below the portrait has the following wording:\nWorks\n*Verses by A Child (private printing, 1909)\n*Worple Flit and other poems (printed posthumously, 1916)\nReferences\n*Pamela Glenconner, Edward Wyndham Tennant: a memoir by his mother Pamela Glenconner with portraits in photogravure (1919)\n* Anne Powell, Bim.
