On July 1, 2022, the Royals began a four-year transition from NCAA Division II to Division I as new members of the ASUN Conference. Before then, Queens had competed in the South Atlantic Conference (SAC) for 20 of their varsity sports; the men's and women's swimming and diving teams competed in the Bluegrass Mountain Conference and the men's volleyball team competed in the Independent Volleyball Association, a scheduling alliance among schools that are independents in that sport's National Collegiate division. Queens had been a member of the SAC since 2013, when it moved from Conference Carolinas.\nOn May 7, 2022, Queens announced it had accepted an invitation from the ASUN Conference and would join the league on July 1. The ASUN officially announced this move three days later. The men's volleyball team joined the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association in July 2023 after having played the 2023 season (2022–23 school year) in the Independent Volleyball Association, a loose affiliation of schools not affiliated with an NCAA-recognized men's volleyball conference.\nConference affiliations\nNCAA\n* Conference Carolinas (1995–2013)\n* South Atlantic Conference (2013–2022)\n* ASUN Conference (2022–present)\nVarsity teams\nSports that are not recognized by the NCAA in any form are indicated with a yellow background.
