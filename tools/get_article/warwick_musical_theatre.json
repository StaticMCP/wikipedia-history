Initially, it hosted touring Broadway shows but, by the 1970s, \"big-name\" entertainers became its standard offering.\nIn 1967, the original tent was replaced with a 3,300-seat theater in the round that used a building from the 1964 New York World's Fair. It also hosted yearly summer shows by World Wrestling Entertainment until 1999.\nDemise\nThe theater faced increasing competition from larger venues and the Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos in Connecticut, and it hosted a farewell season in 1999, ending its 54th season with a concert by Vince Gill.\nBuster and Barbara Bonoff did not live long after the theater closed. Buster died in 2000 and Barbara in 2003.\nThe Warwick Musical Theatre was torn down in June 2002, and a Lowe's now occupies the site.\nSince its demise, the theater has been honored by a pair of Rhode Island artists. Frank Galasso included it in his lithographs Remember When... and Icons of Rhode Island Past and present. Duke Marcoccio made a commemorative ornament as a part of his series of \"My  Little Town\" Rhode Island landmarks.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bonoff.net/ Bonoff Foundation for the Warwick Musical Theater]\n* [http://www.frankgalasso.com/ Frank Galasso Official Web Site]\n* [http://www.mylittletown.com/ Duke Marcoccio Official Web Site]"
