      "text": "# Caversham (Reading ward)\n\nCaversham is an electoral ward of the Borough of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. It is to the north of the town centre, in the suburb of Caversham to the north of the River Thames. It is bordered by Caversham Heights, Emmer Green and Thames wards of Reading Borough Council, and by the civil parish of Eye and Dunsden in South Oxfordshire. The whole of the ward lies within the Reading Central parliamentary constituency.\nIn a set of boundary changes in 2022, the boundaries of Caversham ward were significantly changed, gaining area from the former Thames ward in the north, but losing it in the south to the new Thames ward. The two Thames wards have nothing in common other than their name.\nAs with all Reading wards, the ward elects three councillors to Reading Borough Council.  Elections since 2004 are generally held by thirds, with elections in three years out of four, although the 2022 elections were for all councillors due to the boundary changes. The ward councillors are currently Jan Gavin, Jacopo Lanzoni and Matt Yeo, who are all members of the Labour party.\nReferences"
