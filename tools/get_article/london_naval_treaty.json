Seeking to address issues not covered in the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which had created tonnage limits for each nation's surface warships, the new agreement regulated submarine warfare, further controlled cruisers and destroyers, and limited naval shipbuilding.\nRatifications were exchanged in London on 27 October 1930, and the treaty went into effect on the same day, but it was largely ineffective.\nThe treaty was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 6 February 1931.\nConference\nThe signing of the treaty remains inextricably intertwined with the ongoing negotiations, which began before the official start of the London Naval Conference of 1930, evolved throughout the progress of the official conference schedule, and continued for years afterward.\nTerms\nThe treaty was seen as an extension of the conditions agreed in the Washington Naval Treaty, an effort to prevent a naval arms race after World War I.\nThe conference was a revival of the efforts that had gone into the 1927 Geneva Naval Conference at which the various negotiators had been unable to reach agreement because of bad feelings between the British and the American governments. The problem may have initially arisen from discussions held between US President President Herbert Hoover and UK Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald at Rapidan Camp in 1929, but a range of factors affected tensions, which were exacerbated by the other nations at the conference.\nUnder the treaty, the standard displacement of submarines was restricted to 2,000 tons, with each major power being allowed to keep three submarines of up to 2,800 tons except that France was allowed to keep one. The submarine gun caliber was also restricted for the first time to  with one exception, an already-constructed French submarine being allowed to retain   guns. That put an end to the 'big-gun' submarine concept pioneered by the British M class and the French Surcouf.\nPer the terms of the treaty, Britain, the United States, and Japan reduced their number of capital ships, Japan by one, the United States by three, and Britain by five. Some were scrapped and others converted to auxiliary or training ships.  All of these had been launched prior to WWI, and had smaller guns than most of the ships which were retained.\nThe treaty also established a distinction between cruisers armed with guns up to  (\"light cruisers\" in unofficial parlance) from those with guns up to  (\"heavy cruisers\"). The number of heavy cruisers was limited: Britain was permitted 15 with a total tonnage of 147,000, the Americans were permitted 18, totalling 180,000, and the Japanese were permitted 12, totalling 108,000 tons. For light cruisers, no numbers were specified but tonnage limits were 143,500 tons for the Americans, 192,200 tons for the British, and 100,450 tons for the Japanese.\nDestroyer tonnage was also limited, with destroyers being defined as ships of less than 1,850 tons and guns up to . The Americans and the British were permitted up to 150,000 tons and Japan 105,500 tons.\nArticle 22 relating to submarine warfare declared international law applied to them as to surface vessels. Also, merchant vessels that demonstrated \"persistent refusal to stop\" or \"active resistance\" could be sunk without the ship's crew and passengers being first delivered to a \"place of safety\".\nArticle 8 outlined smaller surface combatants. Ships between 600 and 2,000 tons, with guns not exceeding  with a maximum of four gun mounts above  without torpedo armament and up to , were exempt from tonnage limitations. The maximum specifications were designed around the French Bougainville-class avisos, which were in construction at the time.\nWarships under 600 tons were also completely exempt. That led to creative attempts to use the unlimited nature of the exemption with the Italian Spica-class torpedo boats, Japanese Chidori-class torpedo boats, French La Melpomène-class torpedo boats and British Kingfisher-class sloops.\nAftermath\nThe next phase of attempted naval arms control was the Second Geneva Naval Conference in 1932. Active negotiations among the other treaty signatories continued during the following years.\nThat was followed by the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936.\nSee also\n*Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament\n*Washington Naval Treaty\n*Second London Naval Treaty – List of treaties signed in London.\n*Treaty of London – List of treaties signed in London.\n*May 15 Incident – attempted coup in Japan\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n* Dingman, Roger.
