Though the PMS is headed by a Secretary, the Secretaries of the Cabinet, Chief of Staff, and Appointments, support the agency. The PMS, the Office of the Appointments Secretary and the Events Management Cluster are under the supervision of the Special Assistant to the President.\nThe position is currently held by Elaine Masukat, after the resignation of Zenaida Angping on December 2, 2022.\nHistory\nThe Presidential Management Staff can trace its lineage to the Program Implementation Agency (PIA), which was created by President Diosdado Macapagal to serve as his technical staff for the socio-economic projects, which his administration was implementing.  It was created on August 24, 1962, under the leadership of Assistant Executive Secretary Sixto K. Roxas and Armand Fabella, who was appointed Director-General.\nThe PIA reported directly to the President and conducted socio-economic planning, formulate policy recommendations, established priorities, and programmed the utilization of public funds, manpower resources, materials and equipment.  It also ensured that the projects of the Office of the President were completed on-time as planned.\nOn February 1, 1966, President Ferdinand E. Marcos dissolved the PIA and established the Presidential Economic Staff (PES) in its place through Executive Order No. 8.  The PES retained all the functions of the PIA and in addition, it was tasked to establish ties with international financial institutions to help the government and the private sector to tap foreign credit and assistance.  The PES was headed by Placido Mapa and Apolinario Orosa and translated the economic targets of the National Economic Council into actual projects.\nOn July 29, 1970, President Marcos then issued Executive Order No. 250, which created the Development Management Staff (DMS) under the Office of the President.  The DMS was located at the Arlegui Guest House.\nIn 1972, Internal Reorganization Plan was implemented and the PES was absorbed by the National Economic and Development Authority and the DMS was retained as an attached agency of the Office of the President, serving as the principal information and staff resource of Malacañang on matters involving monitoring, coordinating, and controlling development programs at execution.  Executive Secretary Alejandro Melchor was appointed to run the DMS; he then proceeded to hire 50 young men and women, including Colonel Luis M. Mirasol, whom he would appoint as managing director.\nThe DMS held office at the New Executive Office Building (San Miguel Building) and produced regular status reports for 21 priority programs as well as provided staff to various government programs and agencies.  The priority programs included projects related to land reform, housing, education, and rural electrification.  These status reports would then be used for briefings as well as Cabinet meetings.\nOn July 8, 1976, Presidential Decree No. 955 reorganized the Office of the President, renaming the DMS as the Presidential Management Staff.\nOn June 30, 2022, President Bongbong Marcos placed the Presidential Broadcast Staff - Radio Television Malacañang which was previously attached to the Presidential Communications Group under the direct supervision and control of the PMS. Also, the chief of the Presidential Management Staff took over all powers and functions of the Cabinet Secretary after the Office of the Cabinet Secretary was abolished by virtue of Executive Order No. 1, s. 2022.\nMandate\nThe Presidential Management Staff (PMS) shall be the primary government agency directly responsible to the Office of the President for providing staff assistance in the Presidential exercise of overall management of the development process.\nPowers and functions\nTo accomplish its mandate, the PMS shall have the following powers and functions pursuant to Executive Order No. 130, s. 1987:\n(a) Provide technical assistance and advice directly to the President in exercising overall management of the development process;\n(b) Analyze and monitor national programs and projects;\n(c) Formulate and implement development management information systems and programs that will include upgrading and strengthening the Office of the President in terms of computer and communications technology for more effective information management and decision management support;\n(d) Conduct continuing analysis and evaluation of economics, social and political trends;\n(e) Conduct studies on methods for the effective and efficient execution of development programs and projects;\n(f) Conduct, review, analysis and evaluation of proposed and existing policies affecting development;\n(g) Provide centralized feedback mechanism on the implementation of national government projects;\n(h) Identify bottlenecks in project implementation or problem areas and possible sources of delays, and formulate solutions or corrective measures thereto;\n(i) Translate Presidential perspective/insights, policies and plans on development issues into strategic action programs/projects;\n(j) Assist in the coordination function for the President with respect to the implementation of the various development programs of the Government;\n(k) Implement initial action on critical areas such as, but not limited to, the National Reconciliation and Development Program, where the President wishes to lead in piloting development initiatives that can subsequently be turned over and directly managed by the line ministries;\nProvide a direct feedback mechanism to and from the people and the Office of the President;\nExercise direct control and supervision over such organizations, offices, agencies, programs and projects as may be aligned/assigned/transferred to the Office pursuant to the provisions of Administrative Orders Nos. 9 and 10 (January 5, 1987), or as provided in existing or subsequent promulgations, orders and instructions of the President;\nOrganize and supervise such task forces as may be necessary to respond to instructions from the President;\n(o) Formulate, implement, and supervise the government’s policies, plans and programs pertaining to the technical support and development management requirements of the President, in accordance with Presidential directives and administrative orders;\n(p Exercise management supervision and control over all bureaus, agencies, corporations, centers, councils, committees placed under the control of the former Office of Development Management and such other agencies placed under its supervision and control by the Office of the President;\n(q) Establish policies and implement programs for the efficient management and operations of its Office and undertake research and such other management measures of efficiency and economy that will redound to the benefit of the Office and the achievement of its development management objectives;\n(r) Exercise such other functions and powers as may be provided by law;\nStructure\nThe PMS head, with the rank of secretary, exercises direct control and supervision over the operations and resources of the organization.
