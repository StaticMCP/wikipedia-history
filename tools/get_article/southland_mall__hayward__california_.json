The mall is anchored by JCPenney, and Macy's (formerly Liberty House). There is only one vacant anchor left by Sears, Hobby Lobby recently moved into the former Dick's Sporting Goods, which prior to Dick's was Kohl's, and way before Mervyn's. The mall is primarily a single-level structure, with a small lower level beneath JCPenney, a Cinemark movie theater, and free standing restaurants in the outlying parking areas. The center is located off Interstate 880 at Winton Avenue, at the western end of the city.\nOn July 10, 2020, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 28 stores nationwide.\nMost of Southland was developed in the early 1960s. The site incorporated a freestanding Sears location and a few other stores operating as the Palma Ceia Center (Palma Ceia being Portuguese for \"Palm Supper\", a reflection of the ethnic Portuguese heritage of Oakland and its newly developing suburbs) and a $20 million expansion program was announced in the fall of 1963, in which the facility would become an enclosed mall. The Taubman Company was the primary developer (the developer of Chicago's Evergreen Plaza was also a partner) and John Graham (the architect of Seattle's Space Needle) the primary architect.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.southlandmall.com/ Southland Mall website]\n*[http://www.bigmallrat.com/shopping-malls/cities/hayward/southland-mall.html Southland Mall at bigmallrat blog]\n*[http://www.labelscar.com/california/southland-mall Southland Mall at labelscar.com website]"
