It served in the Napoleonic Wars (1st Household Cavalry Brigade), the Anglo-Egyptian War (1st (Heavy) Cavalry Brigade), the Boer War and in the First World War when it was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division.\nPrior to World War I the brigade was based at Aldershot in England and originally consisted of three cavalry regiments, and a Royal Engineers signal troop. After the declaration of war in August 1914, the brigade was deployed to the Western Front in France, where an artillery battery joined the brigade the following September and a Machine Gun Squadron in February 1916.\nOne of the brigade's early battles was the action at Néry on 1 September 1914 when, acting alone, the brigade defeated the German 4th Cavalry Division. As a result of this action three men from the artillery battery &ndash; Captain Edward Bradbury, Sergeant-Major George Dorrell and Sergeant David Nelson &ndash; were awarded the Victoria Cross.\nHistory\nNapoleonic Wars\nFrom June 1809, Wellington organized his cavalry into one, later two, cavalry divisions (1st and 2nd) for the Peninsular War.  These performed a purely administrative, rather than tactical, role; the normal tactical headquarters were provided by brigades commanding two, later usually three, regiments.  The cavalry brigades were named for the commanding officer, rather than numbered.  De Grey's Brigade was broken up 29 January 1812.  On 20 May 1813, Fane took over Slade's Brigade; the second Fane's Brigade was unrelated to the original one although coincidentally, and to add to the potential confusion, the 3rd Dragoon Guards served in both.}}  For the Hundred Days Campaign, he numbered his British cavalry brigades in a single sequence, 1st to 7th.}}  The 1st Cavalry Brigade consisted of:\n*1st Life Guards\n*2nd Life Guards\n*Royal Horse Guards\n*1st King's Dragoon Guards\nAs the majority of the brigade consisted of Household Cavalry regiments, it was known as the 1st (Household) Cavalry Brigade .\nAnglo-Egyptian War\n*Household Cavalry Composite Regiment (1 Squadron each from the 1st Life Guards, 2nd Life Guards and Royal Horse Guards)\n*4th Dragoon Guards\n*7th Dragoon Guards\nSecond Boer War\nThe brigade was reformed for the Second Boer War.  During the Battle of Paardeberg, the brigade commanded:\n*Household Cavalry Composite Regiment\n*10th Royal Hussars\n*12th Royal Lancers\n*Q, T and U Batteries, Royal Horse Artillery\nFollowing the end of the Second Boer War in 1902 the army was restructured, and the 1st Cavalry Brigade was established at Aldershot (South Cavalry Barracks) attached to the 1st Army Corps. Brigadier-General Henry Scobell was appointed in command from 1 April 1903.\nFirst World War\n*2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)\n*5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) Dragoon Guards\n*11th (Prince Albert's Own) Hussars\n*1st Signal Troop, Royal Engineers\n*I Battery, Royal Horse Artillery from 17 September 1914\n*1st Cavalry Brigade Machine Gun Squadron Machine Gun Corps\nCommanders\nThe commanders of the 1st Cavalry Brigade during the First World War were:\n*Brigadier-General C.
