It was built as part of the New Deal project.  The dam is  tall,  long, and  wide at its base. On the east side of the dam is Lake Ogallala and on the south side is the Kingsley Hydroelectricity Plant. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District are also located in this area. Kingsley Dam, the Kingsley Hydroelectricity Plant, the Morning Glory Spillway, and the Outlet Tower – a large structure near the dam used to release water from the lake – are main visual icons of Lake McConaughy.\nExternal links\n*[https://www.cnppid.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/KingsleyDam.pdf Kingsley Dam & Lake McConaughy]\nReferences"
