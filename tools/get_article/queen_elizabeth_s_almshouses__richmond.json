Known originally as the \"lower almshouses\", they were built in Petersham Road, a few hundred yards south of what is now Bridge Street.  By 1767, they were almost derelict. In 1767, William Turner rebuilt the almshouses on land at the top end of his estate in The Vineyard. Funds for the rebuilding were raised by public subscription. The almshouses were rebuilt again in 1857. They were damaged during World War II and replaced with four newly built houses in 1955.\nCurrent status\nThe almshouses are now managed by The Richmond Charities. New residents are accepted from 65 years of age.\nSee also\n*List of almshouses in the United Kingdom\nNotes and references\nExternal links\n*[http://www.richmondcharities.org.uk/ The Richmond Charities]"
