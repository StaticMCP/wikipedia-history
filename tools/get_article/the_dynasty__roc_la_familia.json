It was released on October 31, 2000, by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. Its lead single, \"I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)\", produced by the Neptunes, became one of Jay-Z's most successful singles peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, with 557,789 copies sold in its first week. The album is certified double platinum by the RIAA. The album received positive reviews from critics, and became the 20th highest-selling R&B/Hip-Hop album of the 2000–2010 decade according to Billboard.\nMusic\nThough originally billed as a Roc-A-Fella Records compilation album—showcasing Roc-A-Fella artists such as Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, Amil, and Freeway—The Dynasty was marketed as Jay-Z solo album. The production was handled primarily by Just Blaze, Kanye West, Bink!, and the Neptunes.\nTrack listing\n| extra1   = Just Blaze\n| length1  = 3:10\n| title2   = Change the Game\n| writer2 =\n| note2    = performed by Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek\n| extra2   = Rick Rock\n| length2  = 3:07\n| title3   = I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)\n| writer3 =\n| extra3   = The Neptunes\n| length3  = 3:47\n| title4   = Streets Is Talking\n| note4    = performed by Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel\n| writer4 =\n| extra4   = Just Blaze\n| length4  = 4:44\n| title5   = This Can't Be Life\n| note5    = performed by Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel featuring Scarface\n| writer5 =\n| extra5   = Kanye West\n| length5  = 4:48\n| title6   = Get Your Mind Right Mami\n| note6    = performed by Jay-Z and Memphis Bleek featuring Snoop Dogg\n| writer6 =\n| extra6   = Rick Rock\n| length6  = 4:22\n| title7   = Stick 2 the Script\n| note7    = performed by Jay-Z and Beanie Sigel\n| writer7 =\n| extra7   = Just Blaze\n| length7  = 4:08\n| title8   = You, Me, Him and Her\n| note8    = performed by Dynasty\n| writer8 =\n| extra8   = Bink\n| length8  = 3:44\n| title9   = Guilty Until Proven Innocent\n| note9    = featuring R.
