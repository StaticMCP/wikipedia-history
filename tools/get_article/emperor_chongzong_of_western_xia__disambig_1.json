His reign began at the age of three, when his father Li Bingchang died. He remained under the regency of the Empress Dowager Zhaojian until she was poisoned in 1099 by a Liao envoy.\nLi's reign included further sinification and removed the power of some significant Tangut clans, which had remained a powerful political force—appointing tribal leaders as kings, forcing them under his power and influence. His reign saw incursions by the neighboring Liao and Northern Song dynasties, and a series of military defeats from 1114. He established Confucianist-led administration for several political quarters including civil and military, centralising his power. Buddhism was prevalent during his reign, and the scriptures were translated to the Tangut language.\nFamily\nConsorts and issue:\n* Empress, of the Yelü clan (皇后耶律氏), personal name Nanxian (南仙), Princess Cheng'an (成安公主)\n**Li Ren'ai, Crown Prince (世子 李仁愛) (1108–1125), 1st son\n* Empress, of the Ren clan (皇后任氏)\n* Noble Consort, of the Cao clan (貴妃曹氏)\n**Li Renxiai, Emperor Renzong (西夏仁宗 李仁孝: 1124 – 16 October 1193), 2nd son\n** Li Renyou, Prince of Yue (越王 李仁友; d. 1190), 3rd son\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*"
