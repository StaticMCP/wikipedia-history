A scholar of late medieval and renaissance Italian art, particularly patronage, and a Giotto di Bondone specialist whose expertise has led to a number of scholarships and appointments as visiting professor at various institutions both in Europe and America.\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Dumfries, Scotland to John Vincent and Jessie Lamb (Walker) Gardner and raised in Ebbw Vale, Wales, Julian Gardner read for his undergraduate degree (BA) in history at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1961. He went on to study for a diploma in art history at the Courtauld Institute of Art under the tutelage of many of the great art historians of the time as he described in an interview with Margaret Mullett when he was visiting scholar in Byzantine studies at Dumbarton Oaks in 2014;The Courtauld under its charismatic director Anthony Blunt was an exciting place, and there were many eminent emigré scholars who taught there and at the University of London: George Zarnecki, Nikolaus Pevsner, and, at the Warburg, Hugo Buchthal, Ernst Gombrich, and others. Younger English scholars, such as John Shearman and Michael Baxandall, were also making names for themselves.A Rivoira fellowship in medieval archaeology at the British School at Rome followed in the academic year 1965-6 earning him an MA from the University of Oxford in 1966. He returned to the Courtauld and undertook a PhD; The Influence of Popes’ and Cardinals’ Patronage on the Introduction of the Gothic Style into Rome and the Surrounding Areas, 1254-1305 which Richard Krautheimer has described as ‘the best work in existence on the patronage of Italian art in the Duecento.’\nCareer\nConcurrently with working on his doctoral thesis at the University of London, Julian Gardner taught at the Courtauld and lectured there for 8 years until his appointment as Foundation Professor of the History of Art at Warwick University in 1974; a post he remained in until his retirement in 2008. In 2014 he was appointed an Honorary Professor in the Centre for the Study of the Renaissance.\nJulian Gardner met and came to know the art historian Ernst Kitzinger when the latter retired to Oxford. He was partly responsible for the granting of an honorary degree (D. Litt) to Kitzinger by Warwick University in 1989 to which institute he donated papers on his death. Professor Gardner penned the obituary for Ernst Kitzinger that was published in The Independent in 2003.\nHe was also the author of the obituary for Professor John Shearman in 2013.\nIn a review of his most recent book The Roman Crucible, the author concludes that \"Gardner's book fills an important gap in late medieval patronage studies, and with its historical rigor and measured argumentation it is likely to remain the standard work on the topic for decades to come\".\nScholarships, appointments, and honours\n* Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries elected 3 March 1977\n* Research Professor of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft at the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome 1983-5\n* Andrew Mellon Senior Visiting Fellow at the Centre for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA) at the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC. 1999\n* Distinguished Visiting Professor in Mediaeval Studies at the University of California, Berkeley 2000\n* Visiting Professor, 2005–2006 and Berenson Lecturer, 2009 at Harvard University Centre for Renaissance Studies at Villa I Tatti, Florence\n* Samuel H.
