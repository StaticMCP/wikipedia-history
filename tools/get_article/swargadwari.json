It is said to have been founded by Guru Mahārāj Nārāyaṇa Gautama Khāṭrī, also known as Svāmī Hamsānanda, who spent most of his life in the area, herding and milking thousands of cows.\nSwargadwārī is considered one of Nepal's top pilgrimage sites and is listed in the national inventory of cultural and historic heritage sites.\nAs of 2009, a cable car to the temple complex was under construction. In the aftermath of the 1996-2006 Nepalese Civil War, donations of straw and hay had diminished to the point where resident cattle at Swargadwārī were in danger of starving.\nReferences\nExternal links\nMaps and Imagery\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?center28.12131,82.67405&zoom18&size640x640&maptypesatellite&sensorfalse Satellite Image] of Temple Complex\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?center28.078,82.688&zoom11&size640x480&maptypeterrain&markerscolor:greenlabel:D28.004,82.494&markersicon:http://google-maps-icons.googlecode.com/files/templehindu.png|28.119,82.673&markerscolor:bluelabel:A28.073,82.626&markerscolor:bluelabel:M28.142,82.720|28.024,82.790&markerscolor:bluelabel:J28.0774,82.8199&sensorfalse&pathweight:3|color:green|28.238,82.445|28.214,82.503|28.190,82.512|28.167,82.502|28.153,82.526|28.117,82.533|28.108,82.548|28.090,82.565|28.065,82.568|28.062,82.576|28.047,82.589|28.027,82.593|28.012,82.603|27.998,82.653|28.002,82.715|27.974,82.746|27.981,82.777|27.970,82.788|27.975,82.812 Terrain] Swargadwari (temple icon), Dang Valley (D), Mahabharat Range (green line), Arun Khola (A), Madi Kh.
