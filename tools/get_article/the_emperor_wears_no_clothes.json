      "text": "# The Emperor Wears No Clothes\n\nThe Emperor Wears No Clothes is a non-fiction book written by Jack Herer. Starting in 1973, the story begins when Herer takes the advice of his friend, \"Captain\" Ed Adair, and begins compiling tidbits of information about the cannabis plant and its numerous uses, including as hemp and as a drug. After a dozen years of collecting and compiling historical data, Herer first published his work as The Emperor Wears No Clothes, in 1985. The twelfth edition was published in November 2010, and the book continues to be cited in Cannabis rescheduling and re-legalization efforts.\nSince its release in 1985, the book has sold over 800,000 copies worldwide\nThe book, backed by H.E.M.P. (United States), Hanf Haus (Germany), Sensi Seeds/Hash, Marihuana & Hemp Museum, Amsterdam, (Netherlands), and T.H.C., the Texas Hemp Campaign (United States), offers $100,000 to anyone who can disprove the claims made within.  Quoting from the book's back cover:\nThe title of the book alludes to Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairy tale \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" (1837). Herer uses Andersen's story as an allegory for the prohibition of cannabis in certain places.\nSee also\n* List of books about cannabis\n* Chemurgy\n* The Emperor Wears No Clothes at Wikimedia Commons\nReferences\ncategory:1985 in cannabis"
