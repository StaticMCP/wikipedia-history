The ideology of the Siberian Republic was Siberian regionalism (supporters, who occupied the majority of ministerial posts in the government of the new state)\nHistory of the Republic\nExecutive power belonged to the Provisional Siberian Government, which was located in Omsk, legislative power belonged to the Siberian Regional Duma. The basis of the armed forces was the Siberian Army, which consisted of several tens of thousands of people.\nOn July 4, 1918, in Omsk, the Provisional Siberian Government, headed by Pyotr Vologodsky, adopted the \"Declaration of Independence of Siberia\", canceled on November 3, 1918.\nInside the Siberian Republic, there was a struggle between the liberal wing (Provisional Siberian Government) and the socialist wing of regionalism (Siberian Regional Duma), which ended in the fall of 1918 with the dissolution of the Siberian Regional Duma. The consequences of the conflict were the crisis of Siberian statehood, the collapse of the Cabinet of Ministers, the weakening of civilian and strengthening military power, in a series of uprisings. The liberal movement of the oblasts entered into an alliance with the all-Russian political forces and sacrificed the idea of Siberian separatism in order to consolidate the white forces for an attack on Moscow.\nThe Siberian Republic was self-liquidated after the formation of the white Russian state and the Provisional All-Russian Government on September 23, 1918, got control over Siberia in accordance with the declaration of November 3, 1918.\nLeadership\nHead of state\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Office\n!Start of authority\n!End of authority\n|-\n|Pyotr Vologodsky\n|Chairman of the Provisional Siberian Government\n|June 30, 1918\n|November 3, 1918\n|}\nHeads of government\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Office\n!Start of authority\n!End of authority\n|-\n|Pyotr Derber\n|Chairman of the Council of Ministers\n|January 29, 1918\n|July 21, 1918\n|-\n|Ivan Lavrov\n|Chairman of the Council of Ministers\n|July 21, 1918\n|October 22, 1918\n|}\nReferences\nLiterature\n* , 1921. — [http://www.archive.org/details/sibirsoiuznikiik01guinuoft Том 1], [http://www.archive.org/details/sibirsoiuznikiik02guinuoft Том 2].; [http://istmat.info/node/25476] Москва: Айрис-Пресс, 2008. — ISBN 978-5-8112-3010-5.\n*\n*\n*  — § 4.1.
