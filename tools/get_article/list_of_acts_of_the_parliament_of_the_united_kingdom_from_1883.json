For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003. Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n46 & 47 Vict.\nThe fourth session of the 22nd Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 15 February 1883 until 25 August 1883.\nPublic general acts\n|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  as to the Audience of Solicitors.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n-\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  and 1867. }}\n|  }}\n|  to keep Local Registers of their Members in British Colonies.}}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and to make provision with respect to the support of public sewers and sewage works in mining districts.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  to the case of Public Companies.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Corrupt Practices Act 1883|public|51|25-08-1883|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for the better prevention of Corrupt and Illegal Practices at Parliamentary Elections.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and 1880, and extend the same to Her Majesty's Dominions out of the United Kingdom.|note4= }}\n|  and the Public Health Act, Ireland, 1878. }}\n|\n| or the Agricultural Holdings Act 1883|public|61|25-08-1883|archived=n|An Act for amending the Law relating to Agricultural Holdings in England.}}\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\n|  relating to Burgh Saint Peter Improvements, situate in the parish of Burgh Saint Peter, in the county of Norfolk.|note4=|po1=|po1short=n|}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|\n-\n|  relating to Hamford Water, Hunstanton (le Strange), and Swansea.|po1=Hamford Water Fishery Order 1883|\n|po2=Le Strange Fishery Order 1883|\n|po3=Swansea Fishery Order 1883|}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  relating to the Burgh of Broughty Ferry.|note4= }}\n-\n|  for the completion of the Docks Railways and Works by that Act authorised;
