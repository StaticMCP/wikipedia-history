Voters chose five representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNew Hampshire voted for Federalist candidate and Minister to France Charles Cotesworth Pinckney over the Democratic-Republican candidate and Secretary of State James Madison by a margin of 4.8%, although Pinckney won the state's presidential election. However, Pinckney lost to Madison in the national presidential election, making this the second time New Hampshire voted for a losing candidate in its presidential voting history.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |1808 United States presidential election in New Hampshire\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#EA9978; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Federalist\n|Charles Cotesworth Pinckney\n| align=\"right\" |14,085\n| align=\"right\" |52.40%\n| align=\"right\" |7\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Democratic-Republican\n|James Madison\n| align=\"right\" |12,793\n| align=\"right\" |47.59%\n| align=\"right\" |–\n|-\n!\n|–\n|Other\n|4\n|0.01%\n|–\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |Totals\n| align=\"right\" |26,882\n| align=\"right\" |100.00%\n| align=\"right\" |7\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New Hampshire\nReferences"
