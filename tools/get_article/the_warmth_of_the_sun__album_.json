A companion to 2003's Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys, The Warmth of the Sun is composed of fan favorites and hits that were left off its predecessor. Several songs were remixed in stereo for the first time. These are \"All Summer Long\", \"You're So Good to Me\", \"Then I Kissed Her\", \"Please Let Me Wonder\", and \"Let Him Run Wild\".  The song \"Wendy\" appears as a new stereo remix with its middle eight cough edited out.  This album also features an alternate mix of \"Break Away\" and the single versions of \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\" and \"Cool, Cool Water\".\nThe Warmth of the Sun debuted at number 40 on the Billboard 200, selling 14,000 copies in its first week.\nTrack listing\n| extra1 = All Summer Long, 1964\n| title2 = Catch a Wave\n| note2 =\n| length2 = 2:08\n| writer2 =\n| extra2 = Surfer Girl, 1963\n| title3 = Hawaii\n| note3 =\n| length3 = 2:00\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 = Surfer Girl, 1963\n| title4 = Little Honda\n| length4 = 1:52\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 = All Summer Long, 1964\n| title5 = 409\n| note5 =\n| length5 = 2:00\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 = ''Surfin' Safari'', 1962\n| title6 = It's O.K.\n| length6 = 2:12\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 = 15 Big Ones, 1976\n| title7 = You're So Good to Me\n| note7 = New Stereo Mix\n| length7 = 2:15\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 = Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!), 1965\n| title8 = Then I Kissed Her\n| note8 = New Stereo Mix\n| length8 = 2:16\n| writer8 =\n| extra8 = Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!), 1965\n| title9 = Kiss Me, Baby\n| note9 = 2000 Stereo Mix\n| length9 = 2:43\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 = The Beach Boys Today!, 1965\n| title10 = Please Let Me Wonder\n| note10 = New Stereo Mix\n| length10 = 2:50\n| writer10 =\n| extra10 = The Beach Boys Today!, 1965\n| title11 = Let Him Run Wild\n| note11 = New Stereo Mix\n| length11 = 2:20\n| writer11 =\n| extra11 = Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!), 1965\n| title12 = The Little Girl I Once Knew\n| note12 = Mono\n| length12 = 2:02\n| writer12 =\n| extra12 = non-album single, 1965\n| title13 = Wendy\n| note13 = New Stereo Mix\n| length13 = 2:16\n| writer13 =\n| extra13 = All Summer Long, 1964\n| title14 = Disney Girls (1957)\n| note14 =\n| length14 = 4:07\n| writer14 =\n| extra14 = ''Surf's Up, 1971\n| title15 = Forever\n| note15 =\n| length15 = 2:41\n| writer15 =\n| extra15 = Sunflower, 1970\n| title16 = Friends\n| note16 =\n| length16 = 2:32\n| writer16 =\n| extra16 = Friends, 1968\n| title17 = Break Away\n| note17 = Alternate Stereo Mix\n| length17 = 3:05\n| writer17 =\n| extra17 = non-album single, 1969\n| title18 = Why Do Fools Fall in Love\n| note18 = Mono Single Version\n| length18 = 2:07\n| writer18 =\n| extra18 = Shut Down Volume 2'', 1964\n| title19 = Surf's Up\n| note19 =\n| length19 = 4:12\n| writer19 =\n| extra19 = ''Surf's Up, 1971\n| title20 = Feel Flows\n| note20 =\n| length20 = 4:46\n| writer20 =\n| extra20 = Surf's Up, 1971\n| total_length = 78:41\n| title21 = All This Is That\n| note21 =\n| writer21 =\n| extra21 = Carl and the Passions - \"So Tough\"'', 1972\n| length21 = 3:57\n| title22 = 'Til I Die\n| note22 =\n| writer22 =\n| extra22 = ''Surf's Up, 1971\n| length22 = 2:40\n| title23 = Sail On, Sailor\n| note23 =\n| writer23 =\n| extra23 = Holland, 1973\n| length23 = 3:16\n| title24 = Cool, Cool Water\n| writer24 =\n| extra24 = Sunflower'', 1970\n| length24 = 3:24\n| title25 = Don't Go Near the Water\n| writer25 =\n| extra25 = ''Surf's Up, 1971\n| length25 = 2:39\n| title26 = California Saga (On My Way to Sunny Californ-i-a)\n| note26 = Single Version\n| writer26 =\n| extra26 = Holland'', 1973\n| length26 = 3:22\n| title27 = California Dreamin'\n| note27 =\n| writer27 =\n| extra27 = Made in U.S.A., 1986\n| length27 = 3:24\n| title28 = The Warmth of the Sun\n| note28 = Mono\n| writer28 =\n| extra28 = Shut Down Volume 2, 1964\n| length28 = 2:50\n| extra29 =\n| length29 =\n| note30 =\n| extra30 =\n| length30 =\n| note24 = Single Version\n}}\nReferences"
