The State Board of Agriculture elected him on December 14, 1897, to succeed Mewborne effective January 1, 1898. At the board's next meeting on June 14, a motion was introduced to deem Smith unfit for office and form a committee to ask for his resignation. After heated debate, the motion was tabled.
