      "text": "# Warkop\n\nWarkop (an abbreviation of Warung Kopi, meaning \"coffee stall\") were an Indonesian comedy troupe that enjoyed success in radio, films and television over the 1980s and 1990s. Assembled in Jakarta on 1976 under Prambors Rasisonia management, they initially went by the name Warkop Prambors. They soon burgeoned as the country's top comedy group, surpassing Srimulat and Jakarta Group. After their film debut, they settled on the name Warkop DKI (taken from the initials of the three main members: Dono, Kasino and Indro; and also a play on Jakarta's official name, DKI Jakarta). Besides acting on numerous films, they also made sitcoms on ANteve in 1995–1997 as Warkop (Warung Kopi) DKI and Indosiar during 1997–2001 as Warkop Millennium. They also famous for some of parody songs they composed.\nEarly career\nIn the mid-1970s, Warkop joined Prambors for the Obrolan Santai di Warung Kopi weekly radio comedy program. The program featured Dono as Slamet; Kasino as Mas Bei, Acong and Buyung; Indro as Mastowi and Ubai; Nanu as Tulo; and Rudy as Mr. James and Bang Cholil. An appearance in Terminal Musikal, directed by Mus Mualim, boosted Warkop's reputation as a comedy group.\nPersonnel\nThe members are Wahjoe Sardono (Dono), Kasino Hadiwibowo (Kasino), Indrodjojo Kusumonegoro (Indro), Nanu Moeljono, and Rudy Badil. They are Javanese and university graduates. Dono, Kasino and Nanu were students at University of Indonesia and Indro was a student at Pancasila University. Their student background prompted them to incorporate social criticism into their comedy. The only surviving member of the core trio is Indro, after Kasino died from a brain tumor in 1997 and Dono died from lung cancer in 2001.\nFilmography\nWarkop produced most of their work over 1979–1994, starring in 34 comedy films and 1 docudrama film. In 2021, some of the titles were available on Netflix.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year || Title\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Featured actresses & actors\n|-\n| 1979 || Mana Tahaaan... || Elvy Sukaesih and\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 1980 || ' || Camelia Malik\n|-\n| ' || ,  and\n|-\n| ' || Eva Arnaz, , Dorman Borisman, and\n|-\n| ' || Guruh Soekarnoputra, Achmad Albar, and Chrisye\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 1981 || ' || Eva Arnaz and Dorman Borisman\n|-\n| ' || , Marissa Haque, and\n|-\n| ' ||  and Alicia Djohar\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1982 || ' || Meriam Bellina, , and\n|-\n| Chips || ,  and Chintami Atmanegara\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1983 || ' || Eva Arnaz, Lydia Kandou, and\n|-\n|' || Eva Arnaz, Lydia Kandou, Us Us, and\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1984 || ' || Eva Arnaz, Lydia Kandou, Aminah Cendrakasih,  and Us Us\n|-\n| ' || , , and Aminah Cendrakasih\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1985 || ' || Lydia Kandou, , , and Lia Warokka\n|-\n| ' || Ira Wibowo, Lia Warokka, Chintami Atmanegara, , Wieke Widowati, and Advent Bangun\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1986 || ' || Eva Arnaz and\n|-\n| ' || Ayu Azhari, Nia Zulkarnaen, and Chintami Atmanegara\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 1987 || ' || Eva Arnaz and HIM Damsyik\n|-\n| ' || Meriam Bellina and\n|-\n| ' ||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1988 || ' || , , , Ira Wibowo, and Nia Zulkarnaen\n|-\n| ' || Nurul Arifin and Sherly Malinton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1989 || ' || Liza Patzy,  and\n|-\n| ' ||  and Eva Arnaz\n|-\n| 1990 || ' || Nurul Arifin and\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 1991 || ' || Nurul Arifin and Sally Marcellina\n|-\n| ' || Kiki Fatmala,  and\n|-\n| ' || Eva Arnaz, Fortunella and\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1992 || ' || Kiki Fatmala, Fortunella and Sally Marcellina\n|-\n| ' || Gitty Srinita,  and Fortunella\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1993 || ' || , Gitty Srinita and Diah Permatasari\n|-\n| ' || Kiki Fatmala and\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1994 || ' || Diah Permatasari, Gitty Srinita, and HIM Damsyik\n|-\n|  || Sally Marcellina and Taffana Dewi\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nSee also\n* Indonesian comedy\n* Cinema of Indonesia"
