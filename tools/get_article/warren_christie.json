He also appeared in Batwoman as Bruce Wayne / Batman / Tommy Elliott / Hush.\nBackground\nWarren Christie was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland and spent most of his childhood in London, Ontario.  He left London for the University of Windsor after being recruited to play college football. It was during his years at Windsor that Christie developed an interest in performing and decided to pursue it as a career. This led to a move to Vancouver, where he soon found acting opportunities. He now lives in Vancouver, married to actress Sonya Salomaa.\nCareer\nIn 2007, Christie landed a lead role on the series October Road, playing a cocky construction company owner. In the same year, he was cast as the star of the musical feature film Magic Flute Diaries, based on one of Mozart's operas. In 2008, Christie was involved in an ABC pilot, Prince of Motor City, a gothic family drama in which he stars alongside Aiden Quinn and Piper Perabo.\nChristie has taken on a variety of roles in different genres. He played opposite Heather Graham in the romantic comedy Gray Matters, and then appeared in the psychological thriller Beneath, produced by the group that made Napoleon Dynamite in conjunction with MTV Films/Paramount Classics.\nChristie has also been involved in numerous television shows, including the unsuccessful ABC series The Days, and guest appearances in Supernatural, The L Word and Battlestar Galactica, before gaining more consistent work. He starred as Cameron Hicks on Syfy's  series, Alphas.\nIn May 2020, it was revealed during the season one finale of Batwoman, that Christie had been cast as Bruce Wayne, when he portrayed Tommy Elliot disguised as Wayne.
