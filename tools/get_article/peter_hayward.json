He studied civil engineering at the University of New South Wales, worked as a civil engineer for Shoalhaven City Council for 5 years and then trained for the Anglican ministry at Moore Theological College. He was ordained in 1992 and was a curate at Glenmore Park. He then ministered at Christ the Redeemer Church in Spokane, Washington and Beverly Hills, New South Wales before being ordained to the episcopate in April 2010.\nFollowing the retirement of Glenn Davies as Anglican Archbishop of Sydney on 26 March 2021, Hayward was the administrator of the diocese. Hayward was one of four nominees to replace Glenn Davies as Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, to be decided at a special election Synod in May 2021. He was eliminated in the first round of voting.\nReferences"
