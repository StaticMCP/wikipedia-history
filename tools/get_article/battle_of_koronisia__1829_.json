This again mobilized Mehmet Resit Pasha Kütahı, a general with enormous prestige, now the Sultan's commander-in-chief, who was in Ioannina. He was ordered to quickly drown Roumeli in blood so that he could then take over as head of the Ottoman troops on the Russian-Turkish front.\nCommander-in-Chief George assigned the task of stopping Kütahı to the Souliotes millenary under Athanasios Koutsonikas, with the objective of closing in on the islet of Koronisia (present-day Koronisia, an islet in the Amvrakikos Gulf in the wider area of Arta, opposite Preveza and Vonitsa) in the Ottoman passage and preventing Kütahı, who had been undefeated until then, from crossing into Roumeli. The Turkish troops were led by Kütahı himself. However, he failed. On 10 March 1829, the London Protocol was signed.\nReferences"
