It was released in January 2005 through both Zoë Records and Drowned in Sound.\nBackground\nBloody Mother Fucking Asshole was inspired by Wainwright's father, Loudon Wainwright III. She wrote the track as a response to her father's way of writing songs about his family, rather than tending to them.\nThe EP was released in the UK as a 4 song EP (When The Day Is Short omitted) on the Drowned in Sound label.\n\"Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole\" was used at the end of the second episode in season three of the Netflix original series Orange is the New Black,  and at the end of the fourth episode in season one of the HBO original series Big Little Lies.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = PopMatters\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Robert Christgau\n| rev3Score =\n}}\nThe review in PopMatters calls the EP \"a rebellious introductory stance for an artist looking to provoke or silence potential critics\" and states that Wainwright is \"as different from her brother as her brother is different from their father, but like both men, she's fiercely honest and stubbornly candid\". AllMusic write that \"Wainwright's husky voice has matured into a thing of real beauty, and her ability to sound both majestic and totally wrecked helps to humanize each track\".\nTrack listing\n#\"Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole\" (Wainwright) – 3:12\n#\"I Will Internalize\" (Wainwright) – 3:25\n#\"When the Day Is Short\" (Wainwright) – 3:14\n#\"It's Over\" (Wainwright) – 3:28\n#\"How Soon'\" (Carroll Lucas, Jack Owens) – 4:04\nCovers\nThe title song \"Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole\" has been translated into a Swedish version by Caroline af Ugglas.
