It was bought by Don Lorenzo Hubbell in 1921 and turned into a trading post for goods exchange with Navajo. It was one of about thirty trading posts owned by Hubbell and his family, and one of the two wholesale stores (another one was located in Gallup, New Mexico).\nIn 2002, it was restored and became a western gateway to the Winslow Historic District.\nSee also\n*Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site\n*La Posada Historic District — also in Winslow.\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Navajo County, Arizona\nReferences\nExternal links"
