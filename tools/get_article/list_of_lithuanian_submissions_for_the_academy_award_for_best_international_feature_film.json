      "text": "# List of Lithuanian submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film\n\nLithuania has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film}} since 2006 . The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nAs of 2025, Lithuania has submitted eighteen films for the category, but none of them were nominated.\nSubmissions\nThough they have been invited to submit a film by AMPAS regularly since achieving independence in the early 1990s, Lithuania has only submitted films for Oscar consideration since 2006. In fall of that year, it was announced that they had submitted documentary short Before Flying Back to Earth in 2006. With a 52-minute running time, it is one of the few documentaries and few non-feature-length films ever to be submitted in the category, but it was not nominated.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Lithuania for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
