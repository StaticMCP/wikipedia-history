This state is often characterized by feelings of detachment or increased psychological clarity. The term is most commonly associated with hallucinogens, particularly psychedelics and entactogens. Psychiatrist Walter Pahnke described afterglow as an \"elevated and energetic mood with a relative freedom from concerns of the past and from guilt and anxiety.\"\nThis phenomenon contrasts with hangovers, a condition that follows the use of various substances, including alcohol.\nCommon effects of afterglow are described by many drug users:\n* Increased confidence\n* State of inner peace\n* Feeling \"cleansed\"\n* Insomnia\nMost drugs do not typically cause afterglow, but some (like MDMA) can.\nAfterglow may also occur after the usage of dissociative drugs, such as the NMDA antagonists, DXM, ketamine and PCP.\nAfterglow occurs after the comedown or landing. Afterglow slowly fades, but can last as short as 24-hours, while some positive post-acute phase of psychedelic drug effects (characterized by elevated mood and openness) have been reported to extend between 6 and 8 weeks.\nSee also\n* Psychedelic drug § Psychedelic afterglows\nReferences\ncategory:drug culture\ncategory:effects of psychoactive drugs"
