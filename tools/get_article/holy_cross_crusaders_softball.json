The team participates in the Patriot League (PL). From 1985 until 1990, the team was a member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC). The Crusaders were most recently led by head coach Kimberly Stiles. The team plays its home games at Freshman Field located on the university's campus.\nHistory\nThe Crusaders have found minimal success since becoming a Division I program. The program has won the Patriot League regular season title twice, winning the title outright in 1998 and sharing it in a four way tie in 1999. The team won the conference tournament in 1998 after defeating Lehigh by a score of 4-3, their only championship in program history. Because 1998 was the final year before the expansion of the NCAA tournament, the Crusaders did not automatically qualify for the NCAA tournament.\nHoly Cross has won several individual awards during their time in the Patriot League. Pitcher Genoa Grosch was named Patriot League Pitcher of the Year in 1996, 1998, and 1999. Grosch, as well as catcher Michelle Fagnant, were named to the Patriot League 1990s All-Decade team. Former coaches Fran Dyson, Bob Neville, and Brian Claypool have each been named Patriot League Coach of the Year during their time with the Crusaders, with Dyson winning in 1995, Neville in 1998 and 2001, and Claypool in 2011.\nCoaching history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| 1985 || Sandy Gentile || 6–21 ||\n|-\n| 1986 || Kathy Feen || 5–18 ||\n|-\n| 1987–1990 || Laura McLain || 46–77 ||\n|-\n| 1991–1992 || Pete Royce || 12–61–1 ||\n|-\n| 1993–1997 || Fran Dyson || 62–131–2 ||\n|-\n| 1998–2005 || Bob Neville || 129–219–2 ||\n|-\n| 2006–2007 || Peter Maneggia || 14–74 ||\n|-\n| 2008–2016 || Brian Claypool  || 108–305 ||\n|-\n| 2017–2021 || Jen Lapicki || 49–127 ||\n|-\n| 2022–2024 || Kimberly Stiles || 50–100–1 ||\n|}\nRoster\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=9 style=\"\"| 2024 Holy Cross Crusaders roster\n|-\n|width=\"03\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\nPitchers\n*11 – Maya Gallagher – Freshman\n*27 – Zoey McDonough – Freshman\n*19 – Sophia Roncone – Sophomore\n*10 – Avery Toddings – Freshman\n*9 – Jena Whipple – Junior\n*30 – Megan Yurchick – Senior\nCatchers\n*6 – Emma Fong – Junior\n*4 – Morgan Jensen – Senior\n|width=\"15\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\nOutfielders\n*5 – Jenna Alesandrelli – Sophomore\n*23 – Morgan Kane – Sophomore\n*24 – Ali Sniegocki – Sophomore\nInfielders\n*2 – Bailey Bates – Senior\n*18 – Anna Brait – Sophomore\n*2 – Ava Gambichler – Freshman\n*1 – Abbie Gold – Sophomore\n*20 – Caroline Higgins – Freshman\n*3 – Emma Pietrzak – Freshman\nUtility\n*13 – Jessica Mott – Senior\n*12 – Callie Thibault – Junior\n|width=\"25\"|&nbsp;\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"  style=\"font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"|Reference:\n|}\nSeason by season results\nSeason cut short due to COVID-19 pandemic\n)\n| confrecord =\n| poll       = no\n| polltype   =\n}}\nSee also\n*List of NCAA Division I softball programs\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
