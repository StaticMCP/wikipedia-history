After a surprise casting onto reality television show RuPaul's Drag Race, 47-year old suburban telemarketing manager Ed Popil leaves his job to pursue a full-time entertainment industry career as his drag queen alter ego, 1960s-era housewife Mrs. Kasha Davis. The film premiered at the 2021 Slamdance Film Festival. Workhorse Queen will be released on video on demand and DVD through the film's distributor Breaking Glass Pictures on May 3, 2022, and on TV broadcast and streaming in June, 2022 on STARZ.\nPlot\nThe documentary follows Ed Popil as he escapes from his day job at DialAmerica to perform as drag queen Mrs. Kasha Davis at night. After seven years of sending audition tapes to RuPaul's Drag Race casting calls, Ed Popil was finally cast onto Season 7 of the reality television show in 2015. Workhorse Queen explores how mainstream television has affected queer performance culture. In addition to following Ed's life before and after being cast onto Drag Race, the film focuses on the growing divide between members of the Rochester drag community – those who have been on TV, and those who have not. Throughout the film, audiences watch as Ed navigates the highs and lows of pursuing the fame promised by a reality television platform, including his struggles with alcoholism, declining bookings, and ageism within the industry. The film culminates in Ed returning to his home in Rochester and creating Imagination Station (a new variety show for children), which allows him to become the queer role model for kids that he never had growing up.\nIn addition to highlighting Mrs. Kasha Davis' journey through drag communities and the entertainment industry, the film also features performances, interviews and vérité footage of his husband Steven Levins (aka Mr. Davis) and drag queens Darienne Lake, Pandora Boxx, Bianca Del Rio, Tatianna, Tempest DuJour, Aggy Dune, Wednesday Westwood, Bebe Gunn (Australia), Jemima Handful (Australia), and many others.\nFeatured interviews\nAppearances via archival footage\nReception\nWorkhorse Queen premiered at the 2021 Slamdance Film Festival.
