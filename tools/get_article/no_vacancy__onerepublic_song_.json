It was released as a single via digital download on April 28, 2017. It was written by band members Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Drew Brown, and Zach Filkins, as well as Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen from the Norwegian production and songwriting duo Stargate. The song was co-produced by Stargate and Tedder.\nBackground\nAfter the release of OneRepublic's fourth full-length studio album, Oh My My (2016), the band halted all plans for touring and promoting the album following its release. Ryan Tedder described in a lengthy post on the band's official Facebook page that they suffered from \"crippling anxiety\" due to the band's constant touring, recording, and promoting methods. Tedder revealed that the band was to begin releasing a new song \"monthly, weekly sometimes\", departing from their typical album cycle process. He went on to describe the band's future releases by stating “the songs” will be varied and with collaborations, and may feel bonkers at first. Some will be remixes, others will be just me on piano or guitar. Some will sound super trendy and new, some will sound classic and old school or very OneRepublic.\" In the same post, Tedder confirmed that the band was to release \"new music scheduled 2 weeks\" after \"No Vacancy\". The song is the first of a string of singles to be released by OneRepublic. This song was originally intended for Selena Gomez.\nAs of March 20, 2022, the song's lyric video has reached over 37 million views.\nComposition\n\"No Vacancy\" is a reggae-inspired tropical pop song. It features falsetto vocals from lead vocalist and songwriter Ryan Tedder, ska-inspired guitars, and heavy use of synthesizers. It was written by Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Drew Brown, Zach Filkins, as well as Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen from the Norwegian production and songwriting duo Stargate.
