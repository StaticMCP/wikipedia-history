A courtesy term not enshrined in the Constitution, the spouse's role has never been codified or officially defined, but nevertheless figures prominently in the political and social life of Singapore.\nBy tradition, an official portrait of the spouse of the president of Singapore is prominently displayed in government buildings and public institutions alongside the portrait of the president. Jane Yumiko Ittogi is currently the spouse of the ninth President of Singapore, after her husband Tharman Shanmugaratnam won the 2023 presidential election with 70% of the valid votes.\nHistory\nIn December 1959, Noor Aishah, wife of President Yusof Ishak, became the first person to assume the role at the age of 26. Her biography, ''Puan Noor Aishah: Singapore's First Lady, was published in 2017.\nOn 14 September 2017, Mohammed Abdullah Alhabshee became the first gentleman, after his wife Halimah Yacob won the 2017 presidential election by an uncontested walkover.\nList of spouses of the presidents of Singapore\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#cccccc\"\n!
