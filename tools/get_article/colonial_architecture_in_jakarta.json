The period (and the subsequent style) succeeded the earlier period when Jakarta (known then as Jayakarta/Jacatra), governed by the Sultanate of Banten, were completely eradicated and replaced with a walled city of Batavia. The dominant styles of the colonial period can be divided into three periods: the Dutch Golden Age (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century – 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Dutch colonial architecture in Jakarta is apparent in buildings such as houses or villas, churches, civic buildings, and offices, mostly concentrated in the administrative city of Central Jakarta and West Jakarta.\nBelow is a list of colonial buildings and structures found in Jakarta. The list is sorted alphabetically according to its official (local) name. The list can also be sorted to each category.\nBuildings that were renovated in a manner that significantly changed their appearance are listed separately to distinguish the different architectural form.\nSome notable Chinese-style buildings and Islamic mosques that were built during these period are included in the list for comparison.\nDutch East India Company period – 17th to late 18th century\nThe first type of colonial architecture grew from the early Dutch settlements in the 17th century when settlements were generally within walled defenses to protect them from attack by other European trade rivals and native revolt. Following the siege of Jayakarta (previously known as Sunda Kelapa) and its demolition by the Dutch in 1619, it was decided to build the headquarters of the Dutch East India Company on the site. Simon Stevin was commissioned to design a plan for the future settlement based on his concept of the 'ideal city'. His response was a rectangular, walled town, bisected by the river Ciliwung which was to be channeled into a straight canal (later known as also known as Grote Rivier or Kali Besar or \"Big River\" in this area). This new city is called Batavia (now Jakarta). In accordance with Stevin's model, the fortress of Batavia was the most prominent building in the city, symbolizing the center of power, while townhall, markets, and other public buildings were distributed. This layout of Jakarta can still be clearly recognized today in Jakarta Old Town through the layout of the streets and canals, although most of the original 17th-century structures had been destroyed or replaced with newer early 20th-century structures.\nThe architecture style of this period was the tropical counterparts of 17th-century Dutch architecture. Typical features include the typically Dutch high sash windows with split shutters, gable roofs, and white-coral painted wall (as opposed to exposed brick architecture in the Netherlands). This earlier period of Jakarta had many of the buildings solidly built with relatively enclosed structures, a structure that is not very friendly to tropical climate as compared to the architecture of the next period in Jakarta. The best examples of these types of buildings were located along the Tygersgracht (now Jalan Muka Timur) and all of them were demolished. The best surviving example is Toko Merah.\nSeveral types of Portuguese colonial architecture also exist, usually outside the walled city of Batavia. Tugu Church and Sion Church, with their plain facades and domed windows, are some surviving examples.\nIn 1808, Daendels officially moved the city center to the south because of the deteriorating condition of the inner town as well as the malaria outbreak. As a result, many buildings and structures from this period were left to deteriorate. Because of financial issues, many buildings were demolished in the 19th century and the debris was used to construct newer structure in the south, such as the Palace of Governor-General Daendels (now the Financial Department of Indonesia) from the debris of Batavia Castle, and Batavia Theater (now Gedung Kesenian Jakarta) from the debris of the Spinhuis.\nLater, these empty lots in Jakarta Old Town were filled with newer 20th-century structures. Surviving 17th–18th structures were later converted as Jakarta's cultural heritage, e.g. Toko Merah, Gereja Sion and Jakarta History Museum.\nOther dominant architecture styles from this period were the Chinese merchant houses, many were built during the 18th century. Many of these structures show an eclectic mix of Dutch and Chinese influences.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Last official name\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Former names\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Year\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Architect\n! style=\"width:110px;\"|Location\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Latest image\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Oldest image\n|-\n|18th-century Dutch mansion at Kali Besar Barat(Gedung Singa Kuning)\n|Bank of China, formerly Firma Tels & Co\n|18th century\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Arsip Nasional\n|Reynier de Klerck house\n|1760\n|Reynier de Klerck\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Baijen's Country House and the Outer Hospital (demolished, replaced by Citadel Prins Frederik)\n|Baijen's Country House and the Buiten-hospital\n|before 1669, later a hospital, from 1743 until 1820.\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Amsterdam (demolished)\n|Amsterdam\n|1632–1635\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Buren (demolished)\n|Buren\n|before 1650\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Cuylenburg (partly demolished, on its site stands Menara Syahbandar)\n|Cuylenburg, Cullenburch, Culemborg\n|1645\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Diest and gate (demolished)\n|Diest, Diestpoort\n|1632–1635 (bastion), 1638 (gate), 1657 (gate strengthened with stone)\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Enkhuizen (demolished)\n|Enkhuizen\n|1627–1632\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Friesland (demolished)\n|Friesland\n|1632–1635\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Gelderland (demolished)\n|Gelderland, Punt Gelderland\n|1627–1632\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Grimbergen (demolished)\n|Grimbergen\n|1635–1650\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Groningen (demolished)\n|Groningen\n|1632–1635 (replacing the older Buren fortification)\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Hollandia (demolished)\n|Hollandia\n|1627–1632\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Middelburg (demolished)\n|Middelburg\n|1627–1632\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Nassau (demolished)\n|Nassau\n|1632–1635\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Oranje (demolished)\n|Oranje\n|1627–1632\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Overrijsel (demolished)\n|Overrijsel\n|1632–1635\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Rotterdam (demolished)\n|Rotterdam\n|1627–1632\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Utrecht and portal (demolished)\n|Utrecht Poort\n|1635–1650\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Vierkant (demolished)\n|Vierkant\n|1627–1632\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Zeeburg (partly demolished in 2017)\n|Zeeburch poort\n|1632–1635\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bastion Zeeland (demolished)\n|Zeeland poort\n|1627–1632\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Batavia City Hall (1st) and church (demolished between 1622 and 1627.)\n|Kerk en Stadhuis\n|1619–1622\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Batavia City Hall (2nd) (replaced with Batavia City Hall (3rd))\n|Batavia Stadhuis\n|1627\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Binnenhospital, \"Inner Hospital\" (closed in 1808, demolished in 1910 for De Javasche Bank)\n|Binnenhospital\n|1641\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Chinese hospital and home for the aged (formally closed in 1912, later demolished)\n|Sinees Sieken Huys\n|1646\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|De Middelpunt, \"the middle point\"\n|De Middelpunt\n|1650–1667\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|De  Stadskerk (burned down in 1808)\n|De  Stadskerk, De  Binnenkerk\n|1650–1667, 1669–1672\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fort Ancol (demolished)\n|Fort Zouteland, Schaans Zouteland\n|1656\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fort Angke (demolished)\n|See Fort Anké\n|1657\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fort Jacatra (Nassau and Mauritius) (dismantled between 1627 and 1632)\n|Fort Jacatra\n|before 1619\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fort Jacarta Buiten Batavia (demolished)\n|Fort Jacarta Buiten Batavia\n|\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fort Meester Cornelis (demolished)\n|Fort Meester Cornelis\n|1734\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fort Noordwijk (demolished in 1808)\n|Fort Noordwijk\n|1658\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fort Zevenhoek (demolished)\n|Fort Zevenhoek\n|1657\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fort Rijswijk (abandoned in 1697, demolished in 1729)\n|Fort Rijswijk\n|August 1656\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Galangan VOC Restaurant and Ta San Yen\n|Carpenter's shop of the Dutch East Indies\n|1627–1632 or before 1650 or 1727\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Gedung Candra Naya (1957)\n|Landhuis Kroet / Landhuis Van Majoor der Chinezen Khouw Kim An or \"residence of Chinese Mayor Khouw Kim An\"\n|18th century\n|Khouw Tjoen (first resident)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Gerbang Amsterdam or \"Amsterdam Gate\" (demolished in the 1950s)\n|Amsterdamsepoort, Pinangpoort, Kasteelpoort\n|1744\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Gereja Sion\n|De  Buitenkerk\n|1695\n|E.

From the company's regional headquarters Batavia now evolved into the capital of the colony. In 1808 Daendels moved the old town center to higher ground to the south and urbanized the area known as Weltevreden. During the British interregnum Daendels was replaced by Raffles who governed until 1816.\nAs the Dutch become more securely established in the region, towns grew up beyond the walls of the fort. Batavia, together with Semarang and Ujung Pandang, were the most important urban centers. During this time, Batavia became congested and wealthier merchants and other powerful men began to build their residences on the outskirts of town and in the surrounding countryside.\nThe period shows a gradual adaptation to the tropical climate form on the part of the Dutch colonial architecture. These new form of architecture is called Indische Stijl. Typical style during this period include large roof overhang, high roof and ceiling, and front and rear verandahs that opened on to gardens. Indies style can be described as a mix of Indonesian, Chinese, and European influence. Very often the local Javanese style limasan roof was employed, but with addition of 19th-century European architectural elements such as Tuscan columns, doors, windows, and a flight of three to four steps leading up to a verandah running the full width of the house.\nNeoclassicism was a popular style for buildings in Jakarta during this period, which is considered to be the best representation of the greatness of the empire.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Last official name\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Former names\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Year\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Architect\n! style=\"width:110px;\"|Location\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Latest image\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Oldest image\n|-\n|\n|Aley Cramerus Residence\n|\n|anonymous\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|C.

Numerous trading companies and financial institutions established themselves in Java, most of them settled in Batavia. Jakarta Old Town's deteriorating structures were replaced with offices, typically along the Kali Besar. These private companies owned or managed plantations, oil fields, and mines. Railway stations were designed during this period, with characteristic style of this period.\nArchitecturally, neoclassicism fell out of favor to be replaced by Neogothic and Dutch Rationalism. Apparent architectural style were Nieuwe Kunst (e.g. Bank Tabungan Negara), Art Deco or De Stijl, and Amsterdam School. This architecture styles were also the tropical counterpart of the original style, resulting in a style called New Indies Style.\nTwo dominant architectural bureaus during this period were AIA Bureau (Frans Ghijsels) and AA Fermont and Cuypers Bureau (Eduard Cuypers).\nColonnades are required during this period to provide protection against monsoon rains and tropical sun, which in turn transformed the appearance of buildings in the city centers.\nColonial style in Jakarta lingered some years after the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in 1942, and further after the independence of Indonesia in 1945.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Last official name\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Former names\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Year\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Architect\n! style=\"width:110px;\"|Location\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Latest image\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Oldest image\n|-\n|\n|Bioscoop Manggarai or \"Manggarai Cinema\"\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Binnacle (Schakelhuis)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Frans Consulaat Koningsplein\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Electrification of the State Railway Company at Meester Cornelis (Electrificatie van de Staatsspoor- en Tramwegen (SS en T) bij het spoorwegstation te Meester Cornelis)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Modernist villas of Westerpark\n|1920-1930s\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Van Arcken and Co.
