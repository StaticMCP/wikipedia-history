As retaliation, the Fatimids sent devastating Hilalian invasions into the Maghreb to punish the Zirids and Hammadids. On the way to Ifriqiya, the Hilalians devastated Cyrenica in 1050.\nBattle\nThe Hilalians and Zirids met in Haydaran in modern-day south-east Tunisia, it opposed 3,000 Arab cavalry of the Banu Hilal against the Zirid Emir Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis. The Hilalians, greatly outnumbered, decisively defeated the Sanhaja Zirids, forcing them to retreat, opening the road to Kairouan for the Hilalians, which would eventually be captured in 1057.\nAftermath\nAs a result of the Hilalian victory, the Hilalians would eventually capture Kairouan in 1057, forcing the Zirids to move their capital to Mahdia.\nThe Hilalians would even expel the Zenatas from southern Ifriqiya. By the end of the invasion, the Zirids and Hammadids would lose most of their territory, being limited to a small coastal strip on the coast of Ifriqiya.\nReferences"
