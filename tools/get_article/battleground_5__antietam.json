Terrain hex maps are 3D or 2D with various scales and sizes.\nThe basic platform for the Battleground series involves individual infantry and cavalry regiments, artillery batteries, and commanders. All are rated for strength, firepower, weaponry, morale, and movement. As a unit takes fire, it may become fatigued, disordered, or routed to the rear. Players compete against the computer's artificial intelligence or against another player via modem. Players may try a variety of individual scenarios, or refight the entire battle of Antietam. A Fog of War option enhances playing against the computer, as it hides units that are not in direct view of the enemy.\nThe game features video clips of battle reenactments, as well as Civil War music by folk singer Bobby Horton.\nReception\n| rev1 = CNET Gamecenter\n| rev1Score =\n}}\nThe three Battleground games of 1996—Shiloh, Antietam and Waterloo—collectively won Computer Games Strategy Pluss wargame of the year award for that year.\nWaterloo and Antietam were runners-up for Computer Game Entertainments 1996 \"Best War Game\" prize, which ultimately went to Tigers on the Prowl 2. The magazine's editors called both games \"top-notch\", and summarized Antietam as \"the best iteration yet of TalonSoft's successful Civil War game system.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/battleground5antietam/review.html GameSpot review]\n* [http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/196722.html GameFAQs]\n*"
