There are over 60,000 books on the war, with more appearing each month.\nThere is no complete bibliography to the war; the largest guide to books is over 40 years old and lists over 6,000 titles selected by leading scholars.  Many specialized topics such as Abraham Lincoln, women, and medicine have their own lengthy bibliographies. The books on major campaigns typically contain their own specialized guides to the sources and literature. The most comprehensive guide to the historiography annotates over a thousand titles.\nFor the history of North and South see Union (American Civil War) and Confederate States of America and the many articles linked there.\nFor a guide to the bibliography see:\n* *Woodworth, Steven E.; ed.
