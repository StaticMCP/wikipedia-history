Woodson Book Award is an American literary award created in 1973 by the Racism and Social Justice Committee of the National Council for the Social Studies to promote cultural literacy in children and young adults.\nFirst presented in 1974, the award is named for American historian, author, and journalist Carter G. Woodson. Currently awarded at three levels – elementary, middle, and secondary – middle was added in 2001 after the other two divisions began in 1989.\nIn addition to announcing winners, the award recognizes honor books, referred to from 1980 to 1996 as those having \"outstanding merit\". An accompanying seal, with a likeness of Woodson, was introduced in 1999 with gold seals applied to winning book covers and silver seals on honor books.\n, Brent Ashabranner is the only author whose books have received the award three times, as well as the only to have winning books two years in a row. Don Tate, who first had a book win the Woodson award in 2016, illustrated a second title that also (uniquely) won that year.\nAward recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+General winners (1974–1988)\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Subject\n!class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n|1974 ||  || Rosa Parks ||  ||\n|-\n|1975 ||  || Make a Joyful Noise Unto the Lord: The Life of Mahalia Jackson, Queen of the Gospel Singers ||  ||\n|-\n|1976 ||  || Dragonwings || Chinese Americans ||\n|-\n|1977 ||  || |The Trouble They Seen || African Americans ||\n|-\n|1978 ||  || |The Biography of Daniel Inouye ||  ||\n|-\n|1979 ||  || Native American Testimony: An Anthology of Indian and White Relations || Native Americans ||\n|-\n|1980 ||  || War Cry on a Prayer Feather: Prose and Poetry of the Ute || Ute people ||\n|-\n|1981 ||  || |The Chinese Americans || Chinese Americans ||\n|-\n|1982 ||  and Paula McGuire || Coming to North America from Mexico, Cuba and Puerto Rico || Immigration to the U.S. ||\n|-\n|1983 ||  || Morning Star, Black Sun || Northern Cheyenne tribe ||\n|-\n|1984 ||  || Mexico and the United States || Mexico–U.S. relations ||\n|-\n|1985 ||  || To Live in Two Worlds: American Indian Youth Today || Native Americans ||\n|-\n|1986 ||  || Dark Harvest: Migrant Farmworkers in America || Migrant workers ||\n|-\n|1987 ||  || Happily May I Walk || Native Americans ||\n|-\n|1988 ||  || Black Music in America: A History Through Its People || African-American music ||\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\"\n|+Secondary level winners (grades 7–12, since 1989)\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Subject\n!class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n|1989 ||  || Marian Anderson ||  ||\n|-\n|1990 ||  || Paul Robeson ||  ||\n|-\n|1991 ||  || ''Sorrow's Kitchen: The Life and Folklore of Zora Neale Hurston ||  ||\n|-\n|1992 ||  || Native American Doctor: The Story of Susan LaFlesche Picotte ||  ||\n|-\n|1993 ||  || Mississippi Challenge || African Americans in Mississippi ||\n|-\n|1994 ||  || |The March on Washington || March on Washington ||\n|-\n|1995 ||  || Till Victory is Won: Black Soldiers in the Civil War || African Americans in the Civil War ||\n|-\n|1996 ||  || A Fence Away from Freedom: Japanese Americans and World War II || Internment of Japanese Americans ||\n|-\n|1997 ||  || |The Harlem Renaissance || Harlem Renaissance ||\n|-\n|1998 ||  || Langston Hughes ||  ||\n|-\n|1999 ||  || Edmonia Lewis: Wildfire in Marble ||  ||\n|-\n|2000 ||  || Princess Ka'iulani: Hope of a Nation, Heart of a People || Kaʻiulani ||\n|-\n|2001 ||  || Tatan'ka Iyota'ke: Sitting Bull and His World || Sitting Bull ||\n|-\n|2002 ||  || Multiethnic Teens and Cultural Identity || Multiracial people ||\n|-\n|2003 ||  || |The \"Mississippi Burning\" Civil Rights Murder Conspiracy Trial: a Headline Court Case || Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner ||\n|-\n|2004 ||  || Early Black Reformers || African-American history ||\n|-\n|2005 ||  (editor) || |The Civil Rights Act of 1964 || Civil Rights Act of 1964 ||\n|-\n|2006 ||  || No Easy Answers: Bayard Rustin and the Civil Rights Movement ||  ||\n|-\n|2007 ||  || Dear Miss Breed: True Stories of the Japanese-American Incarceration During World War II and a Librarian Who Made a Difference || Internment of Japanese Americans ||\n|-\n|2008 ||  with Anni Beach || Don't Throw Away Your Stick Till You Cross the River: The Journey of an Ordinary Man || Race and ethnicity in the U.S. ||\n|-\n|2009 ||  || Reaching Out || Immigration to the U.S. ||\n|-\n|2010 ||  || Denied, Detained, Deported: Stories From the Dark Side of American Immigration || Immigration to the U.S. ||\n|-\n|2011 ||  || An Unspeakable Crime: The Prosecution and Persecution of Leo Frank ||  ||\n|-\n|2012 ||  || Black and White: The Confrontation between Reverend Fred L.
