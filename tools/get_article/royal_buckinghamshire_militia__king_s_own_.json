The regiment was raised in 1759 as the Buckinghamshire Militia'''. It was embodied in 1778 and ranked as the 10th Regiment of Militia, remaining active for five years. The regiment was regularly re-ranked through its embodiment, becoming the 40th in 1779, 45th in 1780, 20th in 1781 and 2nd in 1782.\nIt was embodied again in 1793 during the French Revolutionary Wars and ranked as the 38th; in 1794 the regiment was renamed the Royal Buckinghamshire Militia (King's Own). After the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803, it was embodied as the 49th, and posted to Harwich Barracks in Harwich, Essex. It was disembodied with the peace in 1814.\nIn 1833, the regiment was ranked as the 35th, and saw service during the Crimean War, being embodied from 1854 to 1856. As part of the 1881 Childers Reforms, it was amalgamated into the British Army's Oxfordshire Light Infantry as the regiment's third battalion, which was embodied in 1900 during the Second Boer War. As part of the Haldane Reforms in 1908, the battalion was disbanded. Its place as the 3rd Battalion was taken by the former Oxfordshire Militia.\nPublications\n*\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071122063601/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/militia/bucks.htm Buckinghamshire Militia], regiments.org\n*\nReferences"
