He highlighted Ryoichi Ikegami's detailed artwork and restrained tone compared to his more graphic works like Crying Freeman and Offered. Katherine Dacey (The Manga Critic) commended Ikegami's intricate backgrounds and character designs, but criticized the stiff dialogue. She noted the series retained the action and drama of Crying Freeman and Wounded Man without their explicit content.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
