It was declared on 25 March 2015. The group opposed the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Khalifa Haftar, during the Second Libyan Civil War.\nOn 15 December 2015, the LNA launched a military offensive in Ajdabiya despite objections from the city's mayor, initiating clashes with the Shura Council and its allies. The fighting ended with the defeat of the Council on 21 February 2016.\nThe Council denied any ties to the Islamic State, despite using a black flag with inverted colors resembling the flag of ISIS.\nReferences"
