Evan Brooks reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"Sadly, Tank has no infantry; both sides are armor heavy. This could well occur in rare instances, but the absence of infantry is sorely missed in what purports to be a simulation of the contemporary battlefield.\"\nPaul Rigby for The Games Machine said that \"Tank is an enjoyable simulation which benefits from a great deal of detailed research – the operation of the M1 Abrams is well portrayed, while the option of being able to control 16 tanks is exciting (and exhausting!).\"\nSteven Anzovin for Compute! said that \"If you sigh wistfully for the great tank battles that may never be, Tank is definitely your game.\"\nSee also\n*M1 Tank Platoon\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
