Orangism became a political force in the 1860s, when it was embraced by the dominant liberal tendency. It was presented as a national apolitical stance to gather the support of monarchist Protestants and Catholics, but liberal Orangism was in fact an attempt at achieving national unity at the expense of socialist and denominational politics.\nReferences"
