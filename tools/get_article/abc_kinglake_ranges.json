The station was first broadcast on 9 March 2009, initially from a makeshift transmitter on 97.1FM. Coverage extended to the towns of Flowerdale and Hazeldene through the local repeater of the Wodonga-based ABC Goulburn Murray service.\nThe station broadcast a local breakfast program, presented from the studios of 774 ABC Melbourne by Louise Fitzroy. A mornings program was presented from temporary studios in Kinglake by Simon Rogers, with additional community-focused programming and simulcasts of national programming from ABC Local Radio.\nIn July 2009, the service ceased broadcasting after five months on air. Alexandra-based UGFM commenced operation of a permanent community radio station on 94.5FM in Kinglake from 6 September 2009.\nSee also\n* Reactions to the Black Saturday bushfire crisis\n* Community radio\nReferences"
