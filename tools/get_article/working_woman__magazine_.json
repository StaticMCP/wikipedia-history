The magazine was acquired by Lang Communications in 1978. It was published on a monthly basis. The magazine and its sister publication Working Mother were sold to MacDonald led by Jay MacDonald in 1996. The magazine were later published by Delia Passi Smalter. As its name implies, the magazine targeted working women, unlike traditional women's magazines which focused on women's roles as wives and mothers, or on fashion.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.smith.edu/libraries/special-collections/about/sophia-smith-collection-womens-history Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College]\n*[http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss468_main.html Working Woman Magazine letters, 1976-2001],\n*[https://www.stampedwithlove.co.uk/blogs/news/10-gorgeous-handmade-mothers-day-gift-ideads Handmade and Personalised Mother's Day Gift Ideas]"
