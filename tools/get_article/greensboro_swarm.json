The Swarm play their home games at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex. The team became the eleventh Development League team to be owned by an NBA team when it was announced in 2015.\nHistory\nIn May 2015, the Charlotte Hornets announced that they planned to bring an NBA D-League team to the Carolinas in 2016. After considering several cities and arenas, the Hornets settled on Greensboro, North Carolina, with its home to be at the Pavilion at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex. On December 29, the name and logo of the Swarm was unveiled during an intermission between the women's and men's championship games of the 40th anniversary of HAECO Invitational presented by NewBridge Bank at the Greensboro Coliseum Complex Special Events Center and featured Charlotte Hornets players and executives, Hugo the Hornet, the Honey Bees (cheerleading for the Hornets), Swarm Squad, and special guests.\nOn July 25, 2016, the Charlotte Hornets hired Denver Nuggets assistant Noel Gillespie to be the head coach of the Swarm. After two seasons and no appearances in the playoffs, Gillespie's contract was not renewed and he was replaced by Joe Wolf. Hornets assistant coach Jay Hernandez was named the head coach of the Swarm for the abbreviated 2020–21 bubble season in Orlando. Hornets head video coordinator Jordan Surenkamp was then named the head coach for the 2021–22 season.\nOn August 3rd, 2023, Michael Jordan sold the majority stake in Hornets Sports & Entertainment (HSE) to a group led by Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin. HSE ownership includes the Charlotte Hornets and the Greensboro Swarm, as well as Hornets Venom GT (NBA 2K League) and managing/operating Spectrum Center.\nFollowing Jordan Surenkamp's departure, Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach D.J. Bakker was hired as head coach of the Swarm on August 27, 2024.\n2024–25 season\nThe 2024-25 season was the most successful for the Swarm to date. Led by new head coach D.J. Bakker, the team recorded a 20-14 regular season record and finished 5th in the Eastern conference. On April 1, 2025 the Swarm lost to the Indiana Mad Ants in the first round of the playoffs with a final score of 110-120.
