During the 1780s, Baban revolted against influence of both the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Iran, achieving significant progress in the north.\nDue to their successes against the two powers, Baban attempted to assert dominance over the regional Kurdish states, demanding tribute from them. Ardalan was the only state to refuse, prompting Baban to invade. A secondary motivation for the invasion was to weaken Qajar influence in the region, as Ardalan was a Qajar ally.\nDespite receiving military support from Qajar Iran, the Qajar-Ardalani forces were ultimately defeated, forcing them to withdraw to Persia proper. The outcome of the battle prompted the Babani army to reorganize, adopting European firearms and cavalry, which significantly strengthened their position as a regional power.\n----\nBackground\nThe battle occurred during the early Kurdish emirate conflicts and was led by Emir Muhammad Pasha, the leader of the Babans. Baban forces advanced to the outskirts of Qaradagh, where they encountered Ardalan forces allied with Persian troops.\nAfter a fierce clash, the Babans defeated the Ardalan forces, compelling them to retreat to Persia and other parts of Ardalan territory. The engagement reflected the ongoing power struggles among Kurdish emirates and their neighboring empires.\n----\nThe Battle\nBaban forces, primarily composed of armored cavalry, charged the Qajar-Ardalani lines, igniting intense combat. After hours of fighting, the Babans began to falter. Observing this, Emir Muhammad Pasha personally led a charge into the front lines, reinvigorating his troops.\nWith renewed determination, the Babans pushed the Qajar-Ardalani forces back onto the hill of Qaradagh. Facing heavy casualties, the Qajar-Ardalani army ultimately withdrew, marking a decisive victory for Baban.\n----\nLegacy\nThe battle demonstrated the strength of the Babani forces to other Kurdish emirates. Following the engagement, Baban launched several successful campaigns against the Persians and Ottomans, expanding their territory while the larger empires were preoccupied with other conflicts.\nThis victory allowed the Babans to consolidate power, significantly enlarging their influence and establishing themselves as a dominant regional power in the region.\nReferences\n* McDowall, David.
