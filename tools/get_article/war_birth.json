U.S. Bombs' sound wears thin in spots, but you've got to admire a guy who opens his album by declaring 'if there's nothing shakin' by this July, I'm gonna shoot myself up with a speed ball and die.'\"\nTrack listing\n#\"That's Life\" – 2:44\n#\"Orange Crunch\" – 2:38\n#\"Jaks\" – 2:39\n#\"Warstoryville\" – 3:18\n#\"12/25\" – 3:06\n#\"Outta Touch\" – 2:08\n#\"U.S. of Hate\" – 2:42\n#\"War Birth\" – 3:24\n#\"Hand Me the Downs\" – 1:51\n#\"Rocks in Memphis\" – 2:48\n#\"Beetle Boot\" – 3:37\n#\"Her & Me\" – 3:58\n#\"Don't Need You\" – 1:58\n#\"No Company Town\" – 3:20\nReferences"
