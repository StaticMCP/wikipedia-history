A growing number of public institutions have started a transition to free-software solutions. This grants independence and can also address the often-argued need for public access to publicly funded developments. This is the only way that public services can ensure that citizen data is handled in a trustworthy manner since non-free software doesn't allow total control (or even knowledge) over the employed functions of the needed programs.\nSee also : List of Linux adopters and List of BSD adopters\nAsia\nIndia\nAssam\nIn 2009, the Government of Assam state made open source a part of its State IT Policy of 2009.

A new website  provides \"an online collection of tools, best practices, and schemas to help agencies implement this policy\", the policy announcement stated.

As yet unspecified OSS licenses will be added to the code. The US Chief Information Officer Tony Scott, co-author of the policy, blogged \"This is, after all, the People's code. Explore it.
