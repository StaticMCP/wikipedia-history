It involves the strategic exchange of information and resources to create connections that can be mutually beneficial. Business networking can be conducted in person, online, or through a combination of both. Through repeated interactions, companies create deeper connections. This encourages knowledge exchange, mutual adaptation, and a commitment of resources, which can be both financial and social, to one another.\nBusiness networking helps individuals achieve effective networking which can result in career advancement, building mutually beneficial relationships and knowledge sharing. There are two main approaches of networking: in-person events like conferences and online platforms like LinkedIn. Setting clear goals beforehand and following up with connections after the event are two methods used to maximize the value of the interactions. It is estimated that around half of all jobs in the USA are found via networking.\nGoals\nBusiness networking offers a variety of advantages for professionals at all stages of their careers. Some goals individuals can achieve through effective networking include career advancement opportunities, gaining access to valuable knowledge and expertise, and building mutually beneficial relationships.\nNetworks can be a powerful tool for identifying new job openings, particularly positions that are not advertised. Connections can provide valuable recommendations and introductions to hiring managers. Networking allows individuals to showcase their skills and experience to potential employers. By building relationships with potential clients and partners at networking events, one can significantly increase awareness of their brand or business. A strong network can act as a referral source, bringing in new business opportunities through trusted recommendations. These connections can become a source of valuable knowledge and expertise. Through conversations and potential mentorship opportunities with experienced professionals, valuable insights can be gained into industry trends and best practices. Business networking fosters the development of mutually beneficial relationships. By connecting with like-minded professionals, organizations can build long-term, trusted bonds that offer support, advice, and collaboration opportunities.\nMany businesses utilize networking as a key element in their marketing plans. It helps to develop trust between those involved and plays a big part in raising the profile of a company. Suppliers and businesses can be seen as networked businesses, and will tend to source the business and their suppliers through their existing relationships, as well as with the companies they work closely with. Penny Power states that networked businesses tend to be open, random, and supportive, whereas those relying on hierarchical, traditional managed approaches are closed, selective, and controlling.\nHistory\nHistorically, there have been multiple forms of business networks, such as those among religious or ethnic groups, among small businesses, or between large companies and their subcontractors. Business networks have existed between firms as well as between individuals. Guilds, associations of merchants and craftspeople, were the main form of business network in North America and Western Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution. Beginning in the 1700s, chambers of commerce began to be founded. In the early twentieth century, service clubs such as the Rotary Club, Lions Club, and Kiwanis Club were founded as social organizations for business networking.\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, networking was promoted to help business people to build their social capital. Business networking by members of marginalized groups (e.g., women, African Americans, etc.) has been encouraged to identify and address the challenges barring them from professional success. Mainstream business literature subsequently adopted the terms and concepts, and promoted them as pathways to success for all career climbers.\nBefore online business networking, in-person networking was the only option for business people. This was achieved through a number of techniques such as trade show marketing and loyalty programs. Though these techniques have been proven to still be an effective source of making connections and growing a business, many companies now focus more on online marketing due to the ability to track every detail of a campaign and justify the expenditure involved in setting up a campaign.\nTypes\nBusiness networking can be broadly categorized into two main approaches: in-person networking and online networking.\nIn-person networking allows organizations and entrepreneurs to connect with professionals face-to-face. Industry conferences and trade shows are a resource to meet potential clients, partners, and colleagues while also learning about current trends.\nOnline networking provides another resource to connect with professionals virtually. Platforms like LinkedIn are designed specifically for professional networking, allowing individuals to build their network, share their expertise, and participate in industry discussions. Online forums and communities focused on specific industries can be a valuable resource for connecting with like-minded individuals and asking questions about the industry. Industry-specific discussion boards offer another avenue for online networking, where individuals can showcase their knowledge, learn from others, and potentially find new collaborators or clients.\nStrategies\nSuccessful business networking relies on a well-defined strategy implemented before, during, and after networking events. By planning a proactive approach, professionals can maximize the value gained from these interactions and connect to a network that promotes career growth and business development. It is beneficial for organizations to establish clear goals for their interactions and to tailor the approach according to each connection one is trying to form. Researching event attendees beforehand, if possible, is beneficial. Identifying individuals whose work aligns with interests or professional goals allows for unique conversation starters. This demonstrates genuine interest in connecting and establishing rapport which can in turn increase an organization's or individual's reputation. Once the initial connection is made, following up after a networking event with a professional email that shows gratitude for the interaction and knowledge gained can continue the conversation and can begin the foundation for a strong business network connection.\nBenefits\nOne of the most significant advantages is the potential for increased career opportunities. A strong network can provide opportunities such as unadvertised job openings through connections who might be aware of potential fits within their companies. These connections can also provide valuable recommendations and introductions to hiring managers or other individuals who are interested in forming business connections. Additionally, networking events and online platforms offer opportunities to show one's skills or an organization's capabilities and knowledge to a wider audience of potential employers, increasing overall visibility in the job market and business community.\nBeyond career advancement, business networking builds brand awareness. By building strong relationships with potential clients and partners at networking events and through online interactions, organizations can significantly increase awareness of their brand or business. These connections can then develop into paying customers or business connections that can help expand an organization. A strong network acts as a referral source, bringing in new business opportunities through trusted recommendations from one's network members.\nThe larger the network an organization or individual has, the more access to knowledge and experience they have. This type of access proves to be valuable when attempting to expand the business into unknown territory or beginning one's business career. Learning from those who have been in a certain industry for a long time can improve chances of recognition from other brands and businesses who would want to form connections and builds reputation for the organization or individual.\nChallenges\nNetworking can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job market. The skilled networker cultivates personal relationships with prospective employers and selection panelists in the hope that these personal affections will influence future hiring decisions. This form of networking has raised ethical concerns. The objection is that it constitutes an attempt to corrupt formal selection processes. The networker is accused of seeking non-meritocratic advantage over other candidates, advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position.\nFurthermore, research has shown that underrepresented groups are disadvantaged from building professional connections. Given the value of business networks, this may explain persistent differences in labor markets between underrepresented and majority groups or between genders. Specifically, it is estimated that half of all jobs are found through professional networks. Various descriptive studies show that members of underrepresented groups have less valuable connections and profit less from professional networking. For example, McDonald (2011) shows that people that report to predominantly interact with white men in their professional lives receive more job leads and have higher status connections. The study is based on a representative survey of US individuals. Further, a 2025 study provides causal evidence in this regard. In the study, the researchers conduct a large-scale field experiment on LinkedIn in which they vary the race of ficticious LinkedIn profiles via AI-generated profile pictures and sent connection requests to LinkedIn users. They find that Black users receive 13% fewer acceptances than their white counterparts, despite having the same CV. In a second stage of the experiment, the ficticious profiles send messages to the established connections. Here, the researchers show no difference in answers and response rates between Black and white profiles. They interpret this as a foot-in-the-door effect, where Black users initially face discrimination which vanishes once a connection is established. A study on academic networks on Twitter shows similar results with respect to follow-back rates and race. The authors further show that follow-back rates for female fake accounts were higher than for male accounts.\nWhile social media offers a powerful platform for business networking, it still has its downsides. Social media interactions can sometimes feel superficial or inauthentic. Building genuine relationships takes time and effort, which can be difficult in the fast-paced online world. It can be difficult to maintain a balance of showcasing one's expertise and oversharing personal or confidential information and this type of oversharing can cause damage to an organization's reputation. Social media can be overwhelming, since it is filled with a constant stream of content. This can make it difficult for an organization or an individual to stand out and put their name out online. Social media can also be cruel to new content or those who post controversial topics, as these can also damage an organization's reputation.\nSee also\n* Brown Skin Brunchin'\n* Guanxi\n* Personal network\n* Professional network service\nReferences"
