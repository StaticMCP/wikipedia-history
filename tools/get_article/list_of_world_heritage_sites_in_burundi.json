Cultural heritage comprises monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological ones). Natural heritage comprises natural features (such as physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened flora and fauna), and natural sites which are important for scientific research, conservation or natural aesthetic. Burundi accepted the convention on 19 May 1982, making its cultural and natural heritage sites eligible for inclusion on the list. There are no World Heritage Sites in the country, but there are 10 on the tentative list.\nTentative list\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural. In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites for nomination consideration. Nominations for the list are only accepted if the site had been on the tentative list. Burundi has 10 properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" |\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The royal residence of Burundi: the case of Gishora\n|\n|Gitega Province\n|i, iv (cultural)\n|2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The traditional home of Mugumba\n|\n|Bururi Province\n|iv (cultural)\n|2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The sacred natural landscapes of Muramvya, Mpotsa and Nkiko-Mugamba\n|\n|Muramvya, Kayanza, and Mwaro Provinces\n|vi, vii (mixed)\n|2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Gasumo, the southernmost source of the Nile\n|\n|Bururi Province\n|vii (natural)\n|2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Rwihinda, lake of birds\n|\n|Kirundo Province\n| vii, ix (natural)\n|2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lake Tanganyika\n|\n| Bujumbura Mairie, Bujumbura Rural, Bururi, and Makamba Provinces\n|vii, ix (natural)\n|2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Rusizi natural reserve\n|\n|Bubanza and Bujumbura Rural Provinces\n|vii, ix (natural)\n|2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Kibira National Park\n|\n|Muramvya, Kayanza, Cibitoke, and Bubanza Provinces\n|vii, ix (natural)\n|2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ruvubu National Park\n|\n|Karusi, Muyinga, Ruyigi, and Cankuzo Provinces\n|vii, ix (natural)\n|2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Karera Falls and Nyakazu Fault\n|\n|Rutana Province\n|vi, vii (mixed)\n|2007\n|\n|}\nReferences\nSee also\n*List of World Heritage Sites in Africa\n**List of World Heritage Sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n**List of World Heritage Sites in Kenya\n**List of World Heritage Sites in Rwanda\n**List of World Heritage Sites in Tanzania\n**List of World Heritage Sites in Uganda"
