Representatives of Juan Crisóstomo Falcón and José Antonio Páez met behind closed doors and reached an agreement to achieve definitive peace, and convene a National Assembly or Congress, which would be made up of 80 members, of which half would be elected by the Supreme chief of the Republic (Páez) and the other half by the Provisional President of the Federation (Falcón). It was also agreed that Páez should resign as President to facilitate the transition process.\nConsequences\n*The victory of the Liberals and the return of the Liberal Party to power.\n*The definitive peace, that Venezuela needed so much, was achieved.\n*New recruitments were ended, and even forbidden.\n*Reduction of the Central government army.\n*Public order brigades were formed to prevent any outbreak of violence.\n*Despite the long-awaited peace having been achieved, a large part of the Venezuelan population abandoned the countryside for fear of becoming victims of more bloody fighting.\n*Further indebtedness of the country, as it requested a new loan from the English company Matheson & Company.\nReferences"
