The first season was released on Netflix in 2024 and featured one hundred elite chefs divided into two classes: white spoons (veterans) and black spoons (newcomers), competing for the prize of million.  In September 2025, Netflix announced the second season would debut in December 2025.\nJudges\nThe two judges were veteran restaurateur and celebrity chef, Paik Jong-won, and the only Michelin three-star chef in Korea, Anh Sung-jae.  They became full from tasting so much food during the contest but Paik still ate his packed lunch too.\nCare was taken to ensure impartial judging.  In the first black versus white round, the judges were blind-folded so that they would not be influenced by the status of the contestants.  All the food was discarded after judging so that the crew and contestants could not taste it and then challenge or influence the judges' decisions.\nContestants\nThe contestants were divided at the outset into 20 experienced chefs who were classed as White Spoons and competed under their real names, while the remaining 80 contestants were comparative newcomers who were classed as Black Spoons and competed under aliases.\nThe White Spoons were: Ahn You-seong, Bang Ki-su, Cho Eun-ju, Choi Hyun-seok, Choi Ji-hyung, Choi Kang-rok, Edward Lee, Fabrizio Ferrari, Hwang Jin-seon, Jang Ho-joon, Jung Ji-sun, Joseph Lidgerwood, Kim Do-yun, Kim Seung-min, Lee Young-suk, Lu Chinglai, Nam Jeong-seok, Oh Se-deuk, Park Joon-woo, and Seonkyoung Longest.\nOn November 18, 2025, Chefs Lee Joon, Son Jong-won and Hou Deok-juk, and Venerable Sun-jae are announced as White Spoons for the second season.\nFormat and results\nIts format was a cookery contest with different challenges in each round and elimination of contestants until only one remained.\nRound 1: Black Spoon Elimination Challenge\nIn the first round, the 80 Black Spoons were given 100 minutes to cook a personal signature dish. A judge tasted this and then decided to either pass or eliminate the contestant. If the judge was uncertain then the contestant was put on hold for a second opinion by the other judge.  20 Black Spoons were required to pass the first round so, when less than 20 contestants had passed, the judges chose from the deferred contestants to fill the remaining places.  The 20 White Spoons were given a bye and automatically advanced to the second round.\nThe 20 survivors of this round and their signature dishes were as follows.  The final four required a second opinion.\n# Goddess of Chinese Cuisine – Dongpo snowflower dumplings (Judged by Paik Jong Won)\n# Hidden Genius – Spaghetti aglio e olio (Judged by Anh Sung Jae)\n# Genius Restaurateur – Tongyeong-style bibimbap + dried pollock-skin sundae (Judged by Paik Jong Won)\n# Side Dish Chef – mixed-grain rice, seaweed soup with Perilla seed powder, braised Japanese Spanish mackerel, 3 kinds of seasoned vegetables (Judged by Anh Sung Jae)\n# Yeong Chicken – assorted chicken dishes (Judged by Paik Jong Won)\n# God of Seasoning – Golden ratio Mapo tofu (Judged by Paik Jong Won)\n# One Two Three – Bonghwa duck with Korean blackberry (Judged by Anh Sung Jae)\n# Triple Star – Lobster with pepper sauce + Lobster Kinilaw (Judged by Paik Jong Won)\n# Auntie Omakase #1 – Assorted home-cooked meals (Judged by Paik Jong Won)\n# Self-Made Chef – Eight Treasure meatball (Judged by Anh Sung Jae)\n# Comic Book Chef – Dongpo pork from Oishinbo + Crab Spring Roll from Iron Wok Jan (Judged by Paik Jong Won)\n# Meat Master – Galb uignon (Judged by Paik Jong Won)\n# Celebrities' Chef – Vegetarian Sashimi + vegetarian Futomaki (Judged by Anh Sung Jae)\n# Seung-woo's Dad – Sous vide chicken breast + winter watermelon salad (Judged by Paik Jong Won)\n# Yakitori King – Korean chicken yakitori with various cuts (Judged by Paik Jong Won)\n# Kitchen Boss – Braised octopus + lemon cheese pasta (Judged by Anh Sung Jae)\n# Napoli Matfia – Naples fresh pasta with 3 kinds of potato purée (Judged by Anh Sung Jae)\n# Cooking Maniac – Cod milt with curry butter sauce, fried fish  with asparagus, brocoli and saffron veloute sauce (Judged by Anh Sung Jae)\n# Chef Spark – seafood fresh pasta (Judged by Anh Sung Jae)\n# Master of School Meals – Boiled pork and Ssamjang, Gochujang-fried anchovies, Yukgaejang, kimchi, lettuce wraps (Judged by Anh Sung Jae)\nRound 2: Black vs. White 1-on-1 Match\nIn the second round, the White Spoons and Black Spoons competed against each other in 1-on-1 matches. White Spoons were called to the stage and a Black Spoon could join if they would like to challenge them. If a White Spoon received two or more opponents, they could choose whom they would like to compete against. The pair then chose between 20 fridges which contained a random ingredient they must use in any dish of their own devising. Contestants were given 70 minutes to cook their dish, then the two creations were then subject to a blind tasting by the judges who were blindfolded and hand-fed by spoon. The judges voted anonymously and then removed their blindfold if the decision was unanimous. If there was a tie, the contestants were asked to leave so that the judges could deliberate on both dishes and make a final decision. The contestant of the winning dish would then advance while the other was eliminated. At the end of the round, both judges selected one contestant each among those who were eliminated to receive a \"super pass\" and return to the competition.\nColor key\n*  Contestant won their match and advanced to Round 3\n*  Contestant received a \"super pass\" from the judges\n*  Contestant lost their match and was eliminated\n;Key\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 90%; white-space: nowrap\"\n|-\n| ○\n| Judge voted for the White Spoon's dish\n|-\n| ●\n| Judge voted for the Black Spoon's dish\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Black vs. White 1-on-1 Match results\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Main Ingredient\n! rowspan=\"2\" | White Spoon\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Black Spoon\n! colspan=\"2\" | Judges' Vote\n|-\n!

The White Spoon team in one category competed against the respective Black Spoon team. Each team had 200 minutes to prepare and serve their dish to a panel of 100 audience members, including the two judges. In each match the team with the most votes was declared the winner with all contestants in the team advancing to the next round.\nColor key\n*  Winning Team, all members advance to Round 4\n*  Losing Team, all members sent to the Consolation Round\n*  Head Chef\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Black vs. White Team Match results\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Category\n! colspan=\"3\" | White Spoon\n! colspan=\"3\" | Black Spoon\n|-\n!

Contestants had 40 minutes to prepare any dish of their devising using ingredients typically found in a convenience store. The judges tasted each dish in the order that it was finished. After all dishes were sampled, the judges selected three contestants regardless of their class to advance to Round 4.\nColor key\n*  Contestant was selected to advance to Round 4\n*  Contestant was eliminated\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Consolation Round results\n!

The head chefs for each team were predetermined by a survey where contestants voted on three others whom they believe are most likely to win the competition. The first place contestant (with eleven votes) was Black Spoon's Triple Star, followed by White Spoon's Choi Hyun-seok and White Spoon's Edward Lee. After all teams were decided, the restaurant mission was announced. Each team has 24 hours to create their own restaurant from the ground up, including its concept, menu items and pricing, and shopping and preparing the ingredients. After the 24 hours, all restaurants will open simultaneously to customers for 2 hours and 30 minutes. For the restaurant with the most sales, all of their members will advance to the Semifinal, while for the restaurant with the lowest sales, all of their members will be eliminated. Only eight contestants will survive based on restaurant sales and judges' evaluations.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Initial team assignments\n! Team Triple Star\n!

Contestants could also volunteer to dismiss themselves. The three dismissed contestants would form a fourth team that must design a new restaurant to compete against the opposing teams. The dismissed contestants were Black Spoon's Self-Made Chef (from Triple Star's team), White Spoon's Ahn You-seong (from Choi Hyun-seok's team), and Black Spoon's Comic Book Chef (from Edward Lee's team). At the end of the 24 hours, the customers were revealed to be twenty mukbang creators. Each customer was given one million won to order as many dishes as they want during the allotted business hours.\nColor key\n*  First place team, all members advance to the semifinal\n*  Contestant advanced to the semifinal via judges' evaluations\n*  Contestant was eliminated\nNames in bold denote Head Chef.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Black and White Mixed Team Match: Restaurant Mission results\n! colspan=\"2\" | Restaurant\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Contestant\n! colspan=\"2\" | Result\n|-\n!

Only two contestants will advance to the final round.\nCook Your Life\nThe contestants were given 70 minutes to cook a dish representing their life. The judges would evaluate their dish and give a score out of 100 points, then both judges' scores were combined to determine the contestant's total score. The contestant with the most points would automatically advance to the final round.\nColor key\n*  Top Score\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Cook Your Life results\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Order\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Contestant\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Dish\n! colspan=\"2\" | Judges' Score\n! colspan=\"2\" | Result\n|-\n!

The chefs had to keep creating dishes using the same key ingredient: tofu.  Each dish had to be created in just 30 minutes using tofu taken from a large stack. The judges used three criteria: ensuring that tofu was a significant ingredient; the creativity of the dish; and its overall execution and presentation. Dishes were served to the judges in the order of completion and the worst submission each round was eliminated.\nEdward Lee won this stage by creating a varied and novel selection of dishes such as Kentucky-Fried Tofu, which resembled the famous chicken dish and used chicken fat as a sauce to give it an appropriate and savoury taste.\nColor key\n*  Contestant survived the round\n*  Contestant was eliminated in this round\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Infinite Cooking Hell results\n!Contestant\n!Round 1\n!Round 2\n!Round 3\n!Round 4\n!Round 5\n!Round 6\n!Judge's Comment for Elimination\n|-\n|style=\"background:White\" | Edward Lee\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Tofu, Pine Nut and Soy Milk Soup\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Tofu and Scallops\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Jasmine Tea-smoked Tofu with Duck Breast and Egg Yolk Sauce\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Tofu Pasta alla Ruota with Gochujang Sauce\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Kentucky-Fried Tofu\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Tofu Crème Brûlée\n| Winner - Edward Lee had the most innovative uses for tofu and his dishes encompassed a larger variety than the other contestants\n|-\n|style=\"background:Black\" | Triple Star\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Sesame Seed and Tofu Dressing Salad\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Tofu Menbosha\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Rockfish and Tofu Jjigae\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Western-styled Mapo Tofu\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Gamtae Tofu Noodles\n|style=\"background:salmon\" | Mexican-Inspired Tofu\n|Too similar to the dish he prepared in Round 4\n|-\n| style=\"background:Black\" | Cooking Maniac\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Tuna-wrapped Tot and Tofu Salad\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Tofu sheet-wrapped Spring Rolls\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Ugly Caesar Salad\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Tofu Tteok-galbi Sandwich\n|style=\"background:salmon\" | Agedashi Tofu\n| style=\"background:darkgrey\"|\n|Not as creative or as well executed as the others' dishes\n|-\n|style=\"background:White\" | Jang Ho-joon\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Ganmodoki\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Edamame and Tofu Gratin\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Pistachio Tofu Salad\n|style=\"background:salmon\" | Tofu and Brisket Rice Bowl\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:darkgrey\"|\n|Not as creative or as well executed as the others' dishes\n|-\n|style=\"background:Black\" | Auntie Omakase #1\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Tofu, Pyogo Mushroom and Spring Onion Dumplings\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Tofu Jjigae\n|style=\"background:salmon\" | Tofu and Crown Daisy Salad\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:darkgrey\"|\n|Not innovative enough\n|-\n|style=\"background:White\" | Jung Ji-sun\n|style=\"background:#90EE90\" | Fried Tofu with Salted Egg Yolk Sauce\n|style=\"background:salmon\" | Tofu Dim Sum\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:darkgrey\"|\n|Not overly flavourful\n|-\n|style=\"background:White\" | Choi Hyun-seok\n|style=\"background:salmon\" | Lamb \"Milanese\" with Saffron Risotto and Mapo Tofu sauce\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:darkgrey\"|\n|Usage of tofu was arbitrary and did not contribute to the overall dish\n|}\nFinal Round\nThe final round's theme was a \"name on the line\" dish. The two chefs had to prepare any dish of their desire within the span of 80 minutes. Similarly to the second round's 1-on-1 match, the judges had to vote independently from one another, albeit with the caveat that instead of a deliberation period, the chefs would have to create another dish should the judges not unanimously agree on the best dish.
