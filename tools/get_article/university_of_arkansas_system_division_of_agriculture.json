The university was established at Fayetteville under the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862. The original Board of Trustees resolved that:\n... the leading object shall be—without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to Agriculture and Mechanical Arts in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life...(and)...To prosecute experiments for the promotion of agriculture and horticulture.\nThe Agricultural Experiment Station, College of Agriculture and Cooperative Extension Service were established in 1888, 1905 and 1914, respectively, in keeping with the three-part Land-Grant mission of the University of Arkansas. The agricultural research and extension programs were statewide in scope from the beginning. Extension headquarters were in Little Rock, and several branch experiment stations were established.\nIn 1959, the UA Board of Trustees established the Division of Agriculture as a statewide entity of the University System. The organizational structure provides for direct appropriation to the Division of Agriculture by the Arkansas General Assembly of funds for research and extension administered by the Division of Agriculture as an equal partner to the campuses and other units in the University System.\nReferences\nStrausberg, Stephen. 1989.
