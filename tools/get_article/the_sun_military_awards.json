The awards are organised and sponsored by The Sun newspaper. The award trophies are designed and hand-made by British Silversmith and porcelain designer Kerry O'Connor.\nDuring the televised ceremony, awards known as \"Millies\" are given out. The awards and their recipients are chosen by a select panel of ten judges, made up of national figures and military chiefs. Nominees of all but one of the categories are selected by the general public, with the remaining category winner chosen by the judges.\nThe first ceremony aired on Sky1 and was hosted by Tess Daly, but from 2009 until 2014, the awards were televised on ITV and are presented by Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden. It currently airs on Forces TV.\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Year !! Presenter !! Broadcaster !!
