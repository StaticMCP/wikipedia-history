He is best known for the comic books The Vision for Marvel Comics, The Sheriff of Babylon for the DC Comics imprint Vertigo, and Batman, Mister Miracle, and Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow for DC Comics.\nIn 2018, King received the Eisner Award for Best Writer for his work on Batman and Mister Miracle, sharing the award with Marjorie Liu.\nIn January 2023, DC Studios co-chairman and co-CEO James Gunn announced that King would be one of the architects of the new DC Universe media franchise of films and television. In this franchise, King's Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow miniseries is set to be adapted into the film Supergirl (2026), while King serves a co-creator of the HBO series Lanterns.\nEarly life\nKing primarily grew up in Southern California. His mother worked in the film industry ,which inspired his love of storytelling. He interned at both DC and Marvel Comics during the late 1990s. He studied both philosophy and history at Columbia University, graduating in 2000. He identifies as \"half-Jewish, half-American\".\nCareer\n]]\nKing interned both at DC Comics and Marvel Comics, where he was an assistant to X-Men writer Chris Claremont, before joining the CIA counterterrorism unit after 9/11. King spent seven years as a counterterrorism operations officer for the CIA before quitting to write his debut novel, A Once Crowded Sky, after the birth of his first child.\nA Once Crowded Sky, King's debut superhero novel with comics pages illustrated by Tom Fowler, was published on July 10, 2012, by Touchstone, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, to positive reception.\nIn 2014, King was chosen to co-write Grayson for DC Comics, along with Tim Seeley and Mikel Janin on art. After penning Nightwing No. 30, King, Seeley, and Janin launched Grayson in May 2014, featuring Dick Grayson leaving behind his Nightwing persona at age 22 to become Agent 37, a Spyral spy. King and Seeley plotted the series together and traded issues to script separately, with King providing additional authenticity through his background with the CIA.\nA relaunch of classic DC Comics series The Omega Men was published in June 2015 by King and debut artist Barnaby Bagenda, as part of the publisher's relaunch DC You. The series follows a group of rebels fighting an oppressive galactic empire, and feature White Lantern Kyle Rayner. The Omega Men, created in 1981, are DC's cosmic equivalent to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, though significantly more obscure. King's and Bagenda's use of the nine-panel grid, popularized by Alan Moore's and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen, has been praised by reviewers.\nIn San Diego Comic-Con 2015, Vertigo revealed a new creator-owned project written by King with art by Mitch Gerads titled The Sheriff of Baghdad. The project, a crime series in the vein of Vertigo titles like Preacher and Scalped, was set to launch in late 2015, and was inspired by King's time in Iraq as part of the CIA. Initially an eight-issue miniseries, it was later re-titled The Sheriff of Babylon and expanded into an ongoing series. The first issue launched in December 2015 to critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its \"deeply personal\" storytelling and the \"intriguing\" and \"captivating\" personalities of its characters. That same year, DC announced \"Robin War\", a crossover storyline set for December that would run for five weeks through titles Grayson, Detective Comics, We Are Robin, and Robin: Son of Batman; King was set to orchestrate the crossover's story-line and pen two one-shots to open and close the series.\nAs part of Marvel Comics' All-New, All-Different relaunch, King was announced as the writer of The Vision, a new ongoing following the titular character and his newly created family, with artist Gabriel Hernández Walta, colorist Jordie Bellaire, and covers by Mike del Mundo, launching in November 2015. The Vision has been well received by the public, with reviewers calling the series one of Marvel's \"biggest surprises\" and praising the narration, art, and colors.\nIn September 2015, DC cancelled King's The Omega Men, along with four other titles, with the series ending with issue seven. After negative fan response to the cancellation, Jim Lee, DC's co-publisher, announced that they would be bringing back The Omega Men through at least issue 12. Lee described the decision to cancel the series as \"a bit hasty,\" crediting the book's critical acclaim and fan social media reactions as the reason the title would go on for the planned 12-issue run.\nKing penned a Green Lantern one-shot that ties into the \"Darkseid War\" storyline, titled \"Will You Be My God?\", which James Whitbrook of io9 praised as \"one of the best\" Green Lantern stories.\nKing and co-writer Tim Seeley announced they would leave Grayson after issue No. 18, with King clarifying on Twitter that they were working on something \"big and cool\" and needed time. King and Seeley officially left the series in February with issue No. 17, with Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly taking over for its last three issues with issue No. 18 in March.\nDC Comics announced in February 2016 that King had signed an exclusivity deal with the publisher, which would see him writing exclusively for DC and Vertigo. King revealed via his Twitter account that he would stay on The Vision as writer through issue 12, finishing the story arc he had planned from the beginning.\nIn March 2016, it was announced that King would be writing the main bi-weekly Batman series beginning with a new No. 1, replacing long-time writer Scott Snyder, as part of DC's Rebirth relaunch that June. King has stated that his run would be 100 issues total, with the entirety being released twice-monthly, though this was later curtailed to 85 issues and 3 annuals, with a 12 issue followup maxiseries Batman/Catwoman to finish the story.\nIn August 2017, King and regular collaborator Mitch Gerads launched the first issue of their Mister Miracle series, with a planned total run of twelve issues. In June 2018 DC Comics announced King would be writing Heroes in Crisis, a limited series centering around a concept he introduced in Batman.\nIn July 2018, he received the Eisner Award for Best Writer for his work on Batman, Batman Annual #2, Batman/Elmer Fudd Special #1 and Mister Miracle, sharing the award with Marjorie Liu.\nIn May and June 2019, King, Jim Lee, and CW series actresses Nafessa Williams, Candice Patton, and Danielle Panabaker toured five U.S. military bases in Kuwait with the United Service Organizations (USO), where they visited the approximately 12,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in that country as part of DC's 80th anniversary of Batman celebration.\nIn September 2020, DC Comics announced that King would be among the creators of a revived Batman: Black and White anthology series to debut on December 8, 2020. From 2021 to 2022, King was the writer on the eight-issue miniseries Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow with artist Bilquis Evely. David Harth, for CBR, commented that since Omega Men, \"King has mostly stayed away from sci-fi, going for a more psychological take on superheroes instead\". Harth highlighted that Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow \"is very much a sci-fi epic\" and that the series is \"even more imaginative than Omega Men's sci-fi, as it has King flexing his muscles in different ways\".\nIn November 2022, it was announced that King would be writing both Batman: The Brave and the Bold and The Penguin, as a part of the 2023 relaunch Dawn of DC.\nIn January 2023, it was announced that King's Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow miniseries would be adapted into a feature film by DC Studios. It was also announced by DC Studios co-chairman and co-CEO James Gunn that King will serve as one of the architects of the new DC Universe media franchise of feature films and other media that would succeed the DC Extended Universe.\nIn March 2023, it was announced that King would be writing the new Wonder Woman relaunch as a part of Dawn of DC.\nIn July 2023, it was announced that King would work on a new creator-owned series for Boom! Studios, with Peter Gross serving as the illustrator. The series would later be revealed to be Animal Pound, a modern reimagining of George Orwell's Animal Farm set in an animal shelter.\nIn May 2024, it was announced that King would be the writer and the executive producer of the television series Lanterns for DC Studios alongside Damon Lindelof and Chris Mundy.  In June 2024, HBO gave an eight-episode, straight-to-series order to the series. Per the official logline, the series follows “new recruit John Stewart and Lantern legend Hal Jordan, two intergalactic cops drawn into a dark, earth-based mystery as they investigate a murder in the American heartland.”\nIn June 2025, during the Annecy International Animation Film Festival, it was announced that an adult animated series based on King and Gerads’ Mister Miracle maxiseries was greenlit, with King serving as executive producer and showrunner.\nIn August 2025, it was announced that King would pen the screenplay to a film based on Archie Comics for Universal Pictures, with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller serving as producers.\nPersonal life\nAs of 2016, King lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife and three children, Charlie, Claire, and Crosby.\nBibliography\nNovels\n*A Once Crowded Sky (with illustrations by Tom Fowler, 336 pages, Touchstone, 2012, )\nDC Comics\n*Time Warp: \"It's Full of Demons\" (with Tom Fowler, anthology one-shot, Vertigo, 2013)\n*Nightwing:\n**Nightwing vol. 2 #30: \"Setting Son\" (co-written by King and Tim Seeley, art by Javier Garrón, Jorge Lucas and Mikel Janín, 2014)\n***Collected in Nightwing: Setting Son (tpb, 200 pages, 2014, )\n**Grayson #1-17 (co-written with Tim Seeley, art by Mikel Janín, Stephen Mooney (#7, 14, Annual No. 1, Futures End one-shot), Álvaro Martínez (Annual #2), 2014–2016) collected as:\n*** Agents of Spyral (collects #1–4 and the Grayson: Futures End one-shot, hc, 160 pages, 2015, ; tpb, 2016, )\n**** Includes \"The Candidate\" short story (co-written by King and Tim Seeley, art by Stephen Mooney) from Secret Origins vol. 3 No. 8 (anthology, 2015)\n*** We All Die at Dawn (collects #5–8 and Annual No. 1, tpb, 160 pages, 2016, )\n*** Nemesis (collects the DC Sneak Peek: Grayson digital one-shot, #9–12 and Annual No. 2, tpb, 160 pages, 2016, )\n*** A Ghost in the Tomb (collects #13–17, tpb, 184 pages, 2016, )\n*Robin:\n**Robin War (hc, 256 pages, 2016, ; tpb, 2017, ) includes:\n*** \"With the Greatest of Ease\" (with Rob Haynes, Khary Randolph, Mauricet, Jorge Corona and Andres Guinaldo, in No. 1, 2016)\n*** \"The Daring Young Man\" (with Carmine Di Giandomenico, Khary Randolph, Álvaro Martínez, and Scott McDaniel, in No. 2, 2016)\n** Robin: 80th Anniversary 100-Page Super Spectacular: \"The Lesson Plan\" (co-written by King and Tim Seeley, art by Mikel Janín, anthology one-shot, 2020)\n* Batman:\n**Batman vol. 3 (with David Finch, Mikel Janín, Riley Rossmo (#7–8), Mitch Gerads (#14–15, 23, 62, 75 and 81), Jason Fabok (#21–22), Clay Mann (#24, 27, 30, 36–37 and 78–79), Joëlle Jones (#33–35, 39–40 and 44), Travis Moore (#38 and 61), Tony Daniel (#45–47, 55–57 and 75–77), Lee Weeks (#51–53, 67 and Annual #2), Matt Wagner (#54), Jorge Fornés (#60, 66–67, 70–72, 84 and Annual #4), Amanda Conner (#68), Yanick Paquette (#69) and John Romita, Jr. (#80–81); the Rebirth one-shot is co-written by King and Scott Snyder, 2016–2020).\n***Collected in Trade Paperbacks and Hardcovers as:\n**** Batman Vol 1.
