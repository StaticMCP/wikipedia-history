Thirty-two seats were up for election in Wales as the general election occurred after the recently completed boundary review took effect. The Labour Party remained the largest party in Wales, gaining six seats for a total of 27. Both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats made gains, taking them to four seats and one seat respectively. The Conservatives lost all thirteen seats they had held previously, leaving the party without Westminster representation from Wales for the first time since 2005.\nElection\nDate of the election\nOn 22 May 2024, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced 4 July 2024 as the election date.\nNumber of Welsh MPs\nThe Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, as amended by the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020, mandated the number of seats in Wales be reduced from 40 to 32 to more accurately reflect its share of registered voters, including one coterminous with the Isle of Anglesey. The Boundary Commission for Wales was responsible for drawing up proposals for the new constituency boundaries, but it was required to abide by this total.\nThe 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies began in 2020 and concluded in 2023. Initial proposals were published in September 2021. The revised proposals were published on 19 October 2022 followed by a four-week consultation period. On 28 June 2023, the Boundary Commission for Wales published its final recommendations for the new Welsh constituencies. These changes were approved at a meeting of the Privy Council on 15 November. and came into force on 29 November.\nConstituencies\nMembers not standing for re-election\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | MP\n! scope=\"col\" | Consti&shy;tuency\n! scope=\"col\" | First elected\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" | Date announced\n|-\n|\n|Caerphilly\n|2001\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Labour\n|\n|-\n|\n|Arfon\n|2001\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Plaid Cymru\n|\n|-\n|\n|Cynon Valley\n|2019\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Labour\n|\n|-\n|\n|Clwyd West\n|2005\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Conservative\n|\n|-\n|\n|Bridgend\n|2019\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Conservative\n|\n|-\n|\n|Neath\n|2015\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Labour\n|\n|-\n|\n|Cardiff West\n|2001\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Labour\n|\n|-\n|\n|Swansea West\n|1997\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Labour\n|\n|-\n|\n|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr\n|2010\n|style=\"color:inherit;background:\" |\n|Plaid Cymru\n|\n|}\nCandidates\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Affiliation\n!

In addition to defending all of their seats in the south including around Cardiff and Swansea, Labour reversed many of the Conservative gains in 2019, gaining seats such as Bangor Aberconwy, Clwyd East, Clwyd North, Monmouthshire and Wrexham. Labour also won in Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr, which covers Montgomeryshire, the only area in Wales which had, until 2024, never elected a Labour MP. Of the Labour MPs elected, 2 of them are also members of the Co-operative Party. They are designated as Labour-Co-op, but generally just counted in Labour's total.\nPlaid Cymru won four seats, the same as in 2019, however given boundary changes and the reduction in seats this should be counted as two gains. Plaid Cymru defended Dwyfor Meirionnydd and Ceredigion Preseli with significant majorities, gaining the new seat of Caerfyrddin which had been nominally Conservative in 2019, and gained Ynys Môn from the Conservatives. This was the first time Plaid Cymru had won in Ynys Môn since 2001; it was the most marginal seat in Wales with a majority of 637 votes between Plaid and Conservatives, with Labour in close third place. By the share of the vote (14.8 per cent), Plaid Cymru achieved their best ever result in UK general election.\nThe Liberal Democrats gained one seat in Wales, Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe. Outside of briefly holding the predecessor seat following the 2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, the Liberal Democrats have not had a seat in Wales since losing Ceredigion in 2017.\nThe Conservative Party lost every seat in Wales, having won fourteen seats in 2019, the first time since 2001 that Wales had no Conservative MPs. This was despite the Conservatives taking 18.2% of the overall vote and outpolling both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats in terms of votes.\nReform UK was the third largest party in terms of votes with 16.9%, nearly as many votes as the Conservatives and more than both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats; it was also a higher vote share than in England. Reform was the runner-up in thirteen constituencies, coming closest to winning in Llanelli. The Green Party was runner-up in one constituency, Cardiff South and Penarth.\nSee also\n* 2024 United Kingdom general election in England\n* 2024 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland\n* 2024 United Kingdom general election in Scotland\n* Next Senedd election\n* List of MPs for constituencies in Wales (2024–present)\n* List of marginal seats before the 2024 United Kingdom general election\nNotes\nReferences"
