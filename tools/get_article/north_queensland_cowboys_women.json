They compete in Australia's premier women's rugby league competition, the NRL Women's Premiership (NRLW).\nHistory\nIn April 2019, the North Queensland Cowboys announced a program to support grassroots women's rugby league in the region with the hope of gaining entry into the NRL Women's Premiership. The program featured sponsorship and support for that year's Queensland Rugby League (QRL) Northern Region Women's Championship, as well as sponsorship of the Townsville, Cairns and Mackay women's rugby league competitions. Prior to 2019, the Cowboys hosted the 2015 Women's Interstate Challenge between Queensland and New South Wales at their home venue, Willows Sports Complex, as a curtain raiser to their Round 16 NRL fixture against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. Several Jillaroos and Queensland representatives grew up or spent time playing in the North Queensland region, including Brittany Breayley-Nati, Renae Kunst (Mackay), Heather Ballinger, Steph Mooka and Jenni-Sue Hoepper (Cairns).\nOn 10 September 2019, the club announced the opening of their Women's Academy, providing a pathway to elite rugby league for females in north Queensland. The first four Academy members announced were Romy Teitzel, Riutoto Te Hiko, Shanaye Watson and Jasmine Peters. Teiztel's father, Craig, played 12 games for the Cowboys in 1995.\nOn 17 December 2019, the Cowboys announced their first women's team, the North Queensland Gold Stars, who competed in the QRL Women's Premiership. The Gold Stars were a collaborative effort between the Cowboys and their three feeder clubs, the Mackay Cutters, Northern Pride and Townsville Blackhawks. On 14 March 2020, the Gold Stars successfully played their first game, defeating Brothers Ipswich 24–10 at Blue Ribbon Motors Field in Ipswich. Emma Manzelmann and Jasmine Peters, who would be the club's first two NRLW signings in 2023, played in the match.  The season was cancelled two weeks later due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 17 October 2020, Teitzel became the first Academy graduate to play in the NRLW when she debuted for the Brisbane Broncos. On 13 November 2020, Shaniah Power became the first Academy graduate to represent Queensland.\nOn 15 March 2022, the Cowboys formally applied to enter the NRLW. On 4 June 2022, the Gold Stars won the QRL Women's Premiership Grand Final, defeating the Central Queensland Capras 14–12, with the side featuring six of the Cowboys' future NRLW squad members.\nOn 15 June 2022, the Cowboys were admitted to the NRLW for the 2023 season. Following the announcement, the Gold Stars folded and were replaced in the QRL Women's Premiership by a Mackay Cutters women's side.\nOn 24 November 2022, Ben Jeffries was announced as the club's inaugural NRLW head coach, with Anita Creenaune appointed as Head of Women's Elite Programs. On 4 April 2023, Mackay's Emma Manzelmann became the club's inaugural signing.\nSeasons\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|Season\n!colspan=\"8\" scope=\"col\"|Regular Season\n!colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|Finals\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|P\n!scope=\"col\"|W\n!scope=\"col\"|D\n!scope=\"col\"|L\n!scope=\"col\"|F\n!scope=\"col\"|A\n!scope=\"col\"|Pts\n!scope=\"col\"|Pos\n!Top\n!Placing\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2023\n|9||2||0||7||133||266||4\n|\n| 4\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2024\n|9||4||0||5||137||218||8\n|\n| 4\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2025\n|11||7||0||4||186||176||14\n|\n| 6\n|\n|}\n2026 Draw\nThe draw for the 2026 season was announced on 14 November 2025.\n{| class=\"wikitable col3center col4right col5right col6center\"\n!
