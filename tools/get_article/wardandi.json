One informant suggested it reflected a word for \"crow\" (wardan), a theory that sits poorly with early word lists that state that the Wardandi word for that bird is kwa:kum. A second view argues for the sense of \"seacoast people\"; one source in support of this cites a word variously given as waatu or waatern with the meaning \"the ocean\". A third hypothesis has it that the name is derived from the word for \"no\".\nCountry\nWadandi traditional country covers an estimated .
