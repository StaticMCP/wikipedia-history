As the fifth and final installment in The Scorpion King series, it represents the culmination of the original series and a sequel to The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power. The film stars Zach McGowan as Mathayus, along with Pearl Thusi, Mayling Ng, and Peter Mensah in supporting roles. Directed by Don Michael Paul and written by David Alton Hedges.\nPlot\nIn ancient Egypt, King Memtep forges a powerful sword known as the Fang of Anubis after striking a deal with the god of the underworld. The blade gains its strength by capturing the souls of those it slays, with their names inscribed in the mystical Book of Souls.\nCenturies later, the evil warlord Nebserek unearths the Fang and begins a campaign of conquest. Meanwhile, a Nubian warrior named Tala seeks the legendary Scorpion King to help defeat Nebserek. She rescues a blacksmith named Mathayus, believed to be the Scorpion King, and enlists him on a quest to stop the dark power rising in Egypt.\nTogether, they face numerous challenges, including battles with mercenaries, a warrior tribe known as the Black Arrows, and a golem named Enkidu who protects Amina—the human embodiment of the Book of Souls. With Amina's help, they uncover the secret to destroying the Fang: it can only be neutralized by sacrificing the Book itself.\nAs Nebserek closes in, a climactic battle erupts. Enkidu dies protecting Amina, Tala ascends as Queen of Nubia, and Mathayus embraces his role as the Scorpion King. In a final act of sacrifice, Amina willingly perishes to break the curse of the sword, releasing the trapped souls. Mathayus departs alone, presumably to begin his campaign to conquer the known world.\nCast\nProduction\nThe film was produced by Universal 1440 Entertainment and shot primarily in South Africa. Don Michael Paul, known for helming sequels such as Tremors 5: Bloodlines and Death Race: Beyond Anarchy, returned to direct. Principal photography featured on-location shooting in arid, desert-like environments to simulate ancient Egypt and Nubia. Zach McGowan was cast as the new Scorpion King, taking over the role previously played by actors like Dwayne Johnson and Victor Webster. The film marked the fifth and final entry in The Scorpion King franchise.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
