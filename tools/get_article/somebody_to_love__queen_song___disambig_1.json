It debuted on the band's 1976 album A Day at the Races and also appears on their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits.\nThe song has similarities to Queen's earlier hit \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" with its complex harmonies and guitar solos; however, instead of mimicking an English choir, the band turned to a gospel choir. It reached &nbsp;2 in the UK and No.&nbsp;13 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song demonstrated that \"Queen could swing as hard as it could rock, by channeling the spirit of gospel music\".\nWritten by Mercury at the piano, \"Somebody to Love\" is a soul-searching piece that questions life without love. Through voice layering techniques, Queen was able to create the soulful sound of a 100-voice choir from three singers: Freddie Mercury, Brian May, and Roger Taylor. Mercury's fascination and admiration for Aretha Franklin was a major influence for the creation of this song.\nQueen played \"Somebody to Love\" live from 1977 to 1985, and a live performance of the song is featured on the albums Queen Rock Montreal and Queen on Fire – Live at the Bowl. In addition to these live performances, there were collaboration tributes to \"Somebody to Love\" after Mercury's death in 1991. The song was performed live on 20 April 1992 during the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, with George Michael on lead vocals.\nComposition and lyrics\nLike \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the major hit from Queen's previous album A Night at the Opera (1975), \"Somebody to Love\" has a complex melody and deep layering of vocal tracks. But while \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was based on English choir styles, \"Somebody to Love\" was based on a gospel choir arrangement, with Mercury, May and Taylor multitracking their voices to create the impression of a 100-voices. Written in the key of A major, the glam rock and gospel song features dramatic intervalic contrasts, ranging from F2 in the harmonies on the line \"Can anybody find me?\" to A2 to a C5 in full voice up to an A5 in falsetto in the lead vocals, all sung by Mercury.\nThe lyrics, especially combined with the gospel influence, create a song about faith, desperation and soul-searching; the singer questions both the lack of love experienced in his life, and the role and existence of God.|author=Roger Taylor}}\nRelease\n\"Somebody to Love\" went to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100. A promotional video was made combining a staged recording session at Sarm Studios (where the A Day at the Races album was recorded) and film footage of the band's record breaking performance at Hyde Park that September. Peter Hince, the head of Queen's road crew, recalled to Mojo magazine: \"Aesthetically, you had to have all four around the microphone, but John (Deacon) didn't sing on the records. By his own admission, he didn't have the voice. He did sing on-stage but the crew always knew to keep the fader very low.\" The song was included on their first Greatest Hits, released in 1981.\nCritical reception\nBillboard stated that the song grabs attention with gimmicks such as changes in volume and tempo and the use of classical music elements. Cash Box said that \"sounding like the Harvard Chorale on the opening and backing up Freddie Mercury might be their idea of a logical progression from A Night at the Opera\", and that \"there's a grand finale, with handclapping and thundering percussion.\" Record World said that \"the group continues to stretch the limitations of the commercial single\" by incorporating \"operatic overtures\" along the lines of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn said that \"its gospel-tinged urgency maintain's the English band's knack for arrangements that are at once off-beat, yet well within the broad rock mainstream.\n\"Somebody To Love\" was named one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\nLive performances\nThe song was a staple of the A Day at the Races and News of the World tours in 1977&ndash;78. For the Jazz and Live Killer tours, it was also played consistently. During the Game Tour, it was only performed rarely early in the tour, being practically absent in the first three legs, but would return as a staple to the set by early March in South America. It was also played for South America Bites the Dust, Live at the Bowl and Queen Rock Montreal. Later during the Works Tour, a shortened version was played as a medley preceding \"Killer Queen\". A live version from the 1984/85 tour was recorded and filmed on the concert film, Final Live in Japan 1985.\nWhen performed live, Mercury would often alter the melodies of the song, but would generally hit the sustained A4 notes throughout the song. The A4 at the peak of the building line \"can anybody find \" on the studio version was not part of Mercury's original melody, but the other band members felt that it worked better than his. Live, Mercury sang his original take on this line.\nThis was also one of few tracks where Deacon sang backing vocals when performed live. His voice was clearly heard on bootlegs from the band's performance at Earls Court in June 1977 and at the Houston Summit in December 1977.\nEven after Mercury's death in 1991, renditions of \"Somebody to Love\" have been performed live with the remaining band members, May and Taylor, and a number of different lead singers. At the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert held at Wembley Stadium, the song was performed by George Michael. Michael's performance of \"Somebody to Love\" has been hailed as \"one of the best performances of the tribute concert\". The song was later re-released in 1993 as the lead track of an EP called Five Live, which reached No. 1 in the UK. This version is also available on Greatest Hits III, released in 1999.\nThe song was performed on the setlists of their Queen + Adam Lambert tours in 2012, 2014–2015 and 2016 featuring Adam Lambert and at the iHeartRadio Festival 2013 as Queen + Fun.\nPersonnel\n*Freddie Mercury – lead and backing vocals, piano\n*Brian May – guitars, backing vocals\n*Roger Taylor – drums, backing vocals\n*John Deacon – bass\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1976–1977)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| 15\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Finland (Suomen Virallinen)\n| 21\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy (Musica e Dischi)\n| 10\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Africa (Springbok)\n| 7\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100\n| 13\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Cash Box Top 100\n| 9\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018–2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 47\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada (Hot Canadian Digital Songs)\n| 20\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI)\n| 58\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1977)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| 100\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)\n| 27\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada Top Singles (RPM)\n| 63\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)\n| 38\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Single Top 100)\n| 46\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100\n| 88\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Rock Songs (Billboard)\n| 20\n|}\nCertifications\nOther versions\nGeorge Michael and Queen version\n| recorded      = 20 April 1992\n| studio        =\n| venue         = Wembley Stadium (London)\n| genre         =\n| length        = 5:17\n| label         = Parlophone\n| writer        = Freddie Mercury\n| producer      = * Queen\n* George Michael\n| chronology    = George Michael\n| prev_title    = Too Funky\n| prev_year     = 1992\n| next_title    = Killer\n| next_title2   = Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\n| next_year     = 1993\n| misc          = }}\n}}\nEnglish singer-songwriter George Michael performed the song with Queen's remaining members at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in April 1992. It was included as the first track on the 1993 EP Five Live, credited to George Michael and Queen with Lisa Stansfield. As part of the EP, the cover reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 29\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Europe (European Hit Radio)\n| 1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40)\n| 2\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy (Musica e dischi)\n| 9\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Airplay (Music Week)\n| 7\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Cash Box Top 100\n| 32\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop)\n| 59\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM)\n| 88\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40)\n| 51\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Single Top 100)\n| 68\n|}\nCertifications\nTroye Sivan version\n| recorded      = 2018\n| studio        =\n| venue         =\n| genre         =\n| length        = 2:25\n| label         =\n| writer        = Freddie Mercury\n| producer      = Leland\n| prev_title    = Revelation\n| prev_year     = 2018\n| next_title    = I'm So Tired...\n| next_year     = 2019\n}}\nIn November 2018, Australian singer Troye Sivan released a version of the song. The song was released to coincide with the release of the film Bohemian Rhapsody. Universal Music Group released three tracks by different artists channeling their inner Freddie Mercury; this is the third and final installment, following Shawn Mendes' \"Under Pressure\" and 5 Seconds of Summer's \"Killer Queen\" released in October 2018. Similarly to the aforementioned tracks, proceeds from the single benefit the Mercury Phoenix Trust.\nIn a statement, Sivan said, \"I'm so beyond honored to have been asked to cover 'Somebody to Love' by Queen, a masterful song by the most legendary band.\"\nReception\nQueen's manager Jim Beach said Sivan's version \"is both moving and totally original\". Luke Schatz of Consequence of Sound said, \"While Mercury's version soared with choir-like vocals and dramatic instrumentation, Sivan employs a more mellow, minimalist approach. Here, his calming voice is accompanied by little more than bass and keys.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://queenpedia.com/index.php?title=Somebody_To_Love_%28single%29 Queenpedia] – detailed worldwide release information\n*"
