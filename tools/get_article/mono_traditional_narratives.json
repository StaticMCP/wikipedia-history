The eastern group, the Owens Valley Paiute, have narratives that most closely match those of their Great Basin kinsmen, the Northern Paiute, Shoshone, Southern Paiute, and Kawaiisu. The traditions of the western group, the Monache, are more similar to those of such central Californians as the Yokuts and Valley and Sierra Miwok.\nSee also\n*Traditional narratives (Native California)\n*Owens Valley\nOnline examples of Mono narratives\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311020240/http://curtis.library.northwestern.edu/viewPage.cgi?volume=15&page=v The North American Indian] by Edward S.
