As the Ottoman force neared the city of Akhaltsikhe, the Turks were met by a Georgian-Russian detachment commanded by Prince Andronnikov.\nDespite the numerical superiority of the Turkish forces led by Selim Pasha, Prince Andronnikov divided his cavalry into two columns and attacked. One of the Russian columns attacked the Turks head-on while the second column rode to the side and attacked their enemy in the left flank. After a fierce struggle, the Turks were beaten and retreated to Kars. The Russian force lost 361 men while the Turkish casualties amounted to 3,500 men killed, wounded, and captured.\nThe Battle of Akhaltsikhe was the first major Russian success in the Caucasian theater of operations during the Crimean War. After this victory, the Turkish ended their offensive actions in the Trans-Caucasus.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\nGeneral references"
