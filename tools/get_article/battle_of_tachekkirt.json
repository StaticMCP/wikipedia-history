Shortly after the appearance of Lalla Fatma N'Soumer and her reinforcements, composed of Kabyle warriors, they assumed strategic positions and lookouts were placed.\nThe battle took place on 18 July, and the Algerian tribes were victorious over the French army led by Marshal Randon. The French casualties were 800 dead, included 56 officers, and 371 injured. Marshall Randon was almost captured during this battle but managed to escape.\nAfter the battle, Algerian commander Sherif Boubaghla was killed, most likely by the betrayal of his own allies, N'Soumer would take command of the remaining resistance.\nReferences"
