He has published more than 200 scholarly articles and several books and is internationally known for his contribution to global economic modelling.\nEducation\nHe initially studied at the University of New South Wales, where he received a bachelor's degree with First Class Honours in both economics and econometrics and was awarded the University Medal in 1980. McKibbin then studied under Jeffrey Sachs at Harvard University and was awarded a PhD in economics in 1986.\nRoles\nHe was founding director of the ANU Research School of Economics until stepping down in mid-2012. He moved to the Crawford School of Public Policy at ANU in August 2012. He is also an adjunct professor of the Australian Centre for Economic Research on Health. He formed the ANU Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis (CAMA) in 2003 and was the inaugural director of CAMA.\nMcKibbin is a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, DC. He was the professorial fellow of the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney  and a non-resident senior fellow at The Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, where he co-directed the climate change program.\nMcKibbin is CEO and Founder on McKibbin Software Group Pty Ltd.\nHe was a former member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia after being appointed by the Howard Government in July 2001 until the end of his term at the end of July 2011. McKibbin was also a member of the Australian Prime Minister's Science Engineering and Innovation Council under the Howard Government (2005–2007).\nHe was made a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences at the age of 40  and in 2001 was awarded the Centenary Medal For service to Australian society through economic policy and tertiary education.\nCollaborations\nThe McKibbin-Sachs Global Model is a global economic model developed originally in 1984 jointly with Jeffrey Sachs and is a widely used intertemporal general equilibrium model of the world economy.\nThe G-Cubed Model is a global economic model developed in 1991 jointly with Peter Wilcoxen and is a widely used multi-sector intertemporal general equilibrium model of the world economy.\nThe Henderson McKibbin Taylor Rule for Monetary Policy was first proposed by Dale W. Henderson and Warwick McKibbin in 1993 and simultaneously by John B. Taylor.\nThe McKibbin-Wilcoxen Blueprint also known as the McKibbin Wilcoxen Hybrid. McKibbin (Australian National University) and Peter Wilcoxen (Syracuse University) outline various approaches to climate change policy. They argue that the issue of taking action against climate change should be separated from the issue of whether Australia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Once the Kyoto Protocol is set aside it is clear that there are better options available.\nThey argue that Kyoto Protocol-based carbon-trading systems are too inflexible/brittle to attract developing countries (particularly China & India). A better system would need to be flexible enough to refine outcomes over time (as new data become available).\nHonours and awards\nMcKibbin was awarded the Order of Australia in 2016 \"For Distinguished Service to Education as an Economist, Particularly in the Area of Global Climate Policy, and to Financial Institutions and International Organisations\"  and the Centenary medal in 2001 \"For Service to Australian Society through Economic Policy and Tertiary Education\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sensiblepolicy.com/ Warwick McKibbin's Home Page]\n* [https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/warwick-mckibbin Warwick McKibbin - Australian National University]\n* [https://crawford.anu.edu.au/cama Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis]\n* [https://www.piie.com/experts/senior-research-staff/warwick-j-mckibbin Warwick McKibbin - Peterson Institute for International Economics]\n*[https://www.afr.com/by/warwick-mckibbin-p4yvje Warwick McKibbin - Australian Financial Review]\n* [https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/credible-foundation-long-term-international-cooperation-climate-change McKibbin-Wilcoxen Blueprint article on http://www.lowyinstitute.org/]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0JZCPLhci4 Video: Warwick McKibbin interview on the economics of climate change mitigation] with Age environment reporter Adam Morton\n*[https://theconversation.com/politics-with-michelle-grattan-warwick-mckibbin-on-trying-to-model-economic-certainty-in-uncertain-times-254591 Audio: Warwick McKibbin on trying to model economic certainty in uncertain times] Politics with Michelle Grattan, 16 April 2025\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JreEddPslOk Video: Warwick McKibbin interview - Interest rates could be higher despite tariff uncertainty] ABC News - the Business, July 2025\n*[https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/advance-article/doi/10.1093/oxrep/graf023/8242696?login=false Modelling structural change in global macroeconomic models] Oxford Review of Economic Policy, August 2025"
