Henry undertook an extensive Grand Tour between June 1801 and August 1803, his travels taking him to Copenhagen, Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Switzerland and throughout Italy. In March 1803 he joined Sir William Drummond and George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, on Captain Sir John Gore's ship HMS Medusa to bring Drummond to Constantinople. Henry undertook another tour to Italy during the late 1820s, where he purchased a set of Pietra Dure tables from the Grimanni Palace in Venice, a set which were sold by Merlin Entertainments at Sotheby's in 2015.\nHe entered Parliament as one of two representatives for Warwick in 1802, a seat he held until he succeeded his father in the earldom in 1816. He served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1841 to 1846 in the second Tory administration of Sir Robert Peel. Warwick was also a Recorder of Warwick between 1816 and 1813, Lord-Lieutenant of Warwickshire between 1822 and 1853 and a Lord of the Bedchamber between 1828 and 1830. In 1827 he was made a Knight of the Thistle.\nIn 1803 his father, as lord-lieutenant, had commissioned him as Colonel of the Warwickshire Militia, which served in home defence. He remained in command after the regiment was disembodied at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and continued through the following Long Peace until his death.\nHe was also an amateur artist. His print Landscape with Old Trees by Water—one of the first lithographs made in Britain—was published in the portfolio Specimens of Polyautography in 1803.\nLord Warwick married Lady Sarah Elizabeth, daughter of John Savile, 2nd Earl of Mexborough, and widow of John Monson, 3rd Baron Monson, in 1816. She died in January 1851, aged 64. Warwick survived her by two years and died in August 1853, aged 74. He was succeeded in the earldom by his son George.\nSee also\n*Earl of Warwick\n*List of owners of Warwick Castle\nNotes\nReferences\n*Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).
