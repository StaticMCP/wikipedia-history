From 1848 to 1851 he was a partner in the business, and when his father retired, Moore inherited the business.\nCareer\nMoore entered an exclusive contract with Tiffany & Co. under which he would work exclusively for Tiffany's as an independent, outside craftsman.  In 1868 he  joined the firm, working as the firm's chief silver designer until his death 1891.  Moore  made many improvements in manufacturing processes, adding flatware to Tiffany's silver catalog in 1869.\nHe won a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle in 1867 for his exhibit of silverware, another medal at the Centennial Exposition in 1876, and a special gold medal in 1878 in Paris. In 1889 he was awarded the Legion of Honor.\nArt collection\nMoore amassed a collection of art, with a focus on art from Japan, the Islamic world and ancient Greece and Rome.\nHis collection contains somewhere between 1,600 and 1,700 pieces. He first began to study objects to help inform his designs, and subsequently began to collect them. At one time he devoted his attention to Japanese and Chinese porcelains, and later old Persian wares. Over time he became interested in old glass and lusterware porcelains which now form an especially rich part of the collection. His collection includes antique Roman, Cyprian, Etruscan, Merovingian, Venetian, Persian, Arab, German, and Spanish glass; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hispano-Moresque, Rhodian, Damascus, and Persian ceramics; Persian, Turkish, and Indian metalwork, including Saracenic metal work of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as well as Chinese and Japanese bronzes, swords and sword-guards; Japanese inro, netsuke, lacquer ware, and wood and ivory carvings; and Oriental jewelry, Persian lacquer, antique French and Venetian inlaid straw work, and a fine collection of Tanagra figurines.\nHe bequeathed many objects from his collection to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted an exhibition of Moore's work in 2020, describing Moore as \"the creative force who led Tiffany & Co. to unparalleled originality and success during the second half of the nineteenth century.\" In 2024, the Museum exhibited Collecting Inspiration: Edward C. Moore at Tiffany & Co., an exhibit that paired works designed under his direction with those of his collection.  The exhibit was accompanied by a catalog by Medill Higgins Harvey ()\nHe died in his summer house at Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-1701287 \"Moore, Edward Chandler\"], American National Biography.\n* [http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~silversmiths/genealogy/makers/silversmiths/238717.htm \"Edward Chandler Moore\"], American Silversmiths.\n* \"The Edward C.
