Grace Episcopal Church, a national historic site, where the tune of America the Beautiful was written, is within the area.  The larger-than-life bust Justice, a statue of George Floyd and another of Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson are in the district.\nGovernment Center is just south of the Four Corners Historic District and the Prudential Center and north of Newark Symphony Hall. Federal Square had once been called Vroom Alley, but was later renamed. To the east along Mulberry Street is the area that at one time was Newark's Chinatown.\nWhile Government Center is the concentration of federal and municipal buildings, Newark is also the county seat of  in Essex County. County government buildings are located at the Essex County Government Complex, the heart of which is the historic Essex County Courthouse, home of the New Jersey Superior Court.\nGovernment buildings\nUS.PostOffice&Courthouse.Newark.jpg|US Post Office and Courthouse\nRodino Federal Building Newark.JPG|Rodino Federal Building\nNewark City Hall (13637624473).jpg|City Hall\nNewark Police HQ jeh.jpg|Villani  Building (former police headquarters)\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n|Building||Image||Street address||Organization||Dates of use||Notes||References\n|-\n| Frank R.
