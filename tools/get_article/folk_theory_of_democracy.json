The idea is extracted from the 2016 book, Democracy for Realists;\nwhere Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels argue that \"the idea that citizens make coherent and intelligible policy decisions, on which governments then act, bears no relationship to how democracy actually works—or could ever work\".\nReferences"
