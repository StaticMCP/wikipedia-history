MAGNET replaces the Joint Maritime Information Element (JMIE) Support System (JSS).\nMAGNET provides awareness to the field as well as to strategic planners by aggregating data from existing sources internal and external to the Coast Guard or the Department of Homeland Security.  MAGNET correlates data and provides the medium to display information such as ship registry, current ship position, crew background, passenger lists, port history, cargo, known criminal vessels, and suspect lists. MAGNET processes personally identifiable information (PII).\nCoast Guard Intelligence serves as MAGNET's executive agent and shares appropriate aggregated data on a need to know basis with other law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\nMAGNET provides access to the database via workstations located throughout the world. The system will be accessible on multiple networks at different classification levels. The workstations are equipped to access the appropriate networks with current browser technology.\nSee also\n*U.S. Coast Guard Legal Division\n*U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service\n*Coast Guard Intelligence\nReferences"
