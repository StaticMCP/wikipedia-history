      "text": "# Draft:Szymon Madej (16th century councillor and scholar)\n\nSzymon Madej (c. 1538 – 1601) was a minor Polish councillor and scholar active during the mid-to-late 16th century in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Though not widely documented, he is believed to have served as a legal advisor to local nobility in the Lesser Poland region, primarily Kraków, and contributed modestly to early legal humanism in the region.\nMadej is occasionally referenced in footnotes of 19th-century Polish historiography, most notably in relation to his marginal commentary on the Statutes of Piotrków, where he proposed a synthesis of customary law and emerging civic codes influenced by Italian jurisprudence. He also corresponded with lesser-known academic circles in Vilnius and was reportedly affiliated with the short-lived Collegium Civicum, a non-official salon of scholars interested in ethics, law, and theology.\nLittle else is known about his life. Most primary records related to Madej were believed lost during the partitions of Poland. However, a single surviving treatise, De Ordinibus Humanae Civitatis (“On the Orders of Human Society”), exists in partial manuscript form in the Jagiellonian Library archives, and has attracted niche interest from legal historians and conspiracy theorists alike due to its cryptic tone and unexplained references to “the seventh lens of governance”\nReferences"
