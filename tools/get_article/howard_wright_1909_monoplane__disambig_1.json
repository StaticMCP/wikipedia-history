A variant, the Lascelles Ornis, was displayed at the 1910 Aero Show at Olympia in London.\nDevelopment\nIn October 1909 Wright and Manning started work on a new tractor monoplane design. Unlike earlier aircraft, which had used steel tubing, the fuselage was constructed from wire-braced ash wood, but was otherwise similar, being a square-section box-girder tapering to a vertical knife-edge at the back.  The tail-mounted control surfaces were similar to those of the Howard Wright Cooke Monoplane, consisting of a triangular rudder mounted on the sternpost and a rectangular horizontal stabiliser with tip-mounted elevators mounted below the lower longerons. The undercarriage was also similar to the Cooke aircraft, with a pair of mainwheels on sprung trailing arms and a large tailwheel.  Wing warping was used for lateral control: this was controlled by a lever which also operated the elevator on one side of the cockpit, the rudder being operated by a lever on the other side. A 35&nbsp;hp Lascelles 5-cylinder semi-radial air-cooled engine was probably fitted to the examples built, although any suitable engine could be installed.\nWork was started on at least three airframes in an early effort to reduce costs by some measure of standardisation of design, and Wright claimed that he could deliver an aircraft within fourteen days of receiving an order. Although only a few of the type were built, it was quickly followed by a number of very similar aircraft.\nThe Lascelles Ornis, built for the Lascelles company and exhibited on their stand at the 1910 Aero Show at Olympia, differed in having a 2&nbsp;ft (0.6 m) longer fuselage, a  rectangular balanced rudder, and different control arrangements. It was fitted with a propeller made by José Weiss.\nAfter the Olympia show the Ornis was bought by A.G. Power, who flew it at Brooklands during 1910.\nSpecifications (Lascelles Ornis)\n|prime units?=imp\n|genhide=\n|crew=1\n|capacity=\n|length m=\n|length ft=30\n|length in=\n|length note=\n|span m=\n|span ft=28\n|span in=\n|span note=\n|mid span m=\n|mid span ft=\n|mid span in=\n|mid span note=\n|dia note=\n|width m=\n|width ft=\n|width in=\n|width note=\n|height m=\n|height ft=\n|height in=\n|height note=\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=154\n|wing area note=\n|volume note=\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=600\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|lift kg=\n|lift lb=\n|lift note=\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Lascelles\n|eng1 type=5-cylinder air-cooled semi-radial\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=35\n|eng1 kn=\n|eng1 lbf=\n|eng1 note=\n|power original=\n|thrust original=\n|eng1 kn-ab=\n|eng1 lbf-ab=\n|eng2 number=\n|eng2 name=\n|eng2 type=\n|eng2 kw=\n|eng2 hp=\n|eng2 kn=\n|eng2 lbf=\n|eng2 note=\n|eng2 kn-ab=\n|eng2 lbf-ab=\n|prop blade number=\n|prop name=\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=35\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|minimum control speed kmh=\n|minimum control speed mph=\n|minimum control speed kts=\n|minimum control speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=\n|ceiling note=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\n*Penrose, Harald British Aviation: The Pioneer Years.
