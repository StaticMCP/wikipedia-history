He was the eldest son of Liu Shan, the second and last ruler of Shu. His mother was Consort Wang (王貴人), a former servant of Liu Shan's first wife Empress Jing'ai; Lady Wang later became one of Liu Shan's concubines. Liu Xuan became crown prince in February 238. After the fall of Shu to the rival state of Wei, Liu Xuan and his surviving brothers returned to the capital, Chengdu. In March 264, Liu Xuan was killed in Chengdu by rebelling soldiers during Zhong Hui's rebellion.\nSee also\n* Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms\n* Shu Han family trees\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
