The hijackers killed two of the six crew members and wounded a third before the aircraft was forced to land in Singapore. The pilot diverted to U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand for refueling. The flight continued to Singapore were it landed at 21:00 (GMT+07:30) at Seletar Air Base. The hijackers surrendered after negotiating with Singapore officials for five hours. Two days later, Vietnam sent an aircraft to Singapore to bring the DC-3, its crew, and the passengers back to the country.\nThis hijacking marks the first aircraft hijacking on a Vietnam Airlines's aircraft, and also the first aircraft hijacking after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.\nThe aircraft involved in the incident is currently on display near the warehouse at Tan Son Nhat International Airport, next to a Vietnam Airlines's Tupolev Tu-134 with registration number VN-A132.\nIn popular culture\nThe incident also inspired the film Hijacked by director Ham Tran, released in 2025. The plane itself which the incident occurred was also used as a setting for the movie.\nReferences"
