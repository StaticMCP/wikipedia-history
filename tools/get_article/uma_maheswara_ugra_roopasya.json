They run the digital photography Bhavana Studio in the Prakash region of Araku in Andhra Pradesh. Next to the studio is a bone-setting shop owned by Mahesh's good friend, Babji. His assistant is Korra Suhas, who came to Babji, to learn about the study of traditional bone-setting. Mahesh is in a relationship with Swati, his high-school sweetheart.\nBabji becomes involved in a trivial argument with a loafer in the centre of the village. The dispute escalates, but passersby calm them down. However, Suhas appears and attacks the man who had argued with Babji. The man, joined by Joginath, jumps on Suhas in retaliation. Noticing the commotion, Mahesh tries to calm everyone down but Jogi, furious at Mahesh's authoritative stance, beats him up. Manohar breaks up the fight. Embarrassed, Mahesh vows to get back at Jogi and pledges that he will wear slippers only after he has avenged his humiliation.\nSwati is forced to end her relationship with Mahesh and marry a nurse residing in Canada. He learns about Jogi's whereabouts from Suhas and visits the garage where he apparently works as a welder. Its owner tells him that Jogi left for a better job in Dubai. Despite Babji's advice that he should forget the incident, Mahesh resolves to wait for Jogi's return; several weeks later, he enrolls in a kung fu course.\nJyothi, a young college student, goes to Bhavana Studio. She tells Mahesh that she wants to participate in a women's magazine's cover competition and asks him to make her look as good as possible. Perplexed at the unusual request, Mahesh conducts the photo shoot. Jyothi's photograph turns out to be dull and unimpressive, and her irritation makes Mahesh question his skill as a photographer. Upset, he turns to his father for advice. Manohar explains photography as an art to his son. Mahesh goes through his father's photograph collection, finally understanding their angles and lighting, and gets an idea.\nInstead of his familiar still photography, Mahesh photographs Jyothi in motion and sends the best photo to the magazine. Shortly afterward, Jyothi goes to Mahesh's house with the magazine containing her photo. Although she rebukes him for photographing her without permission, she also praises the photo. They become interested in each other, and soon fall in love. Jyothi realises this first, and calls Mahesh to talk about their future. She tells him that she is Jogi's younger sister, but his agitation is overshadowed by love and he decides to continue their relationship.\nSeveral weeks later, Jogi is fired from his job for slapping his manager and is deported back to India. The following day, Mahesh and Babji challenge him to a hand-to-hand combat. After a few minutes of fighting, Mahesh pins down Jogi and Babji declares him the winner. The movie ends with Mahesh visits Jogi in a hospital on the next day and introduces himself to his mother in front of Jyothi.

It is these beautiful details (that might miss a non-native’s understanding) and the feel-good moments it’s dotted with that make this film worth watching.\"\nSangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu reviewed as \"UMUR is a welcome addition to new-age Telugu cinema, offering plenty of humour and moments to savour.\" 123Telugu gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and stated \"Uma Maheswara Ugra Roopasya is an earthy village drama that has some amazing performances.\" Haricharan Pudipeddi of Hindustan Times gave the verdict \"Uma Maheswara Ugra Roopasya is built on the of masculinity and rage. It questions the need for virility and the extent men can go to flaunt.\" Writing for the Film Companion, Baradwaj Rangan stated \"Uma Maheswara Ugra Roopasya isn’t as perfect as his earlier film, but it’s perhaps a better indicator of his sensibilities. To take someone else’s property and still show some kind of authorial signature means you’re holding on to who you essentially are. This is the rare remake with soul.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\"| South Indian International Movie Awards\n| rowspan=\"5\"| 1112 September 2021\n| Best Film – Telugu\n| Arka Media Works, Mahayana Motion Pictures\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"5\"|\n|-\n| Best Director – Telugu\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Actor – Telugu\n| Satyadev\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor – Telugu\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Female Debut – Telugu\n| Roopa Koduvayur\n|\n|-\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
