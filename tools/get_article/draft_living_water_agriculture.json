Operating under the brand name WeSaveSoil.com, the company develops and leases automated microbial bioreactors designed to infuse beneficial soil microbes directly into irrigation systems. The system is intended to reduce fertilizer dependence, improve nutrient cycling, and increase long-term farm profitability.\nHistory\nLiving Water Agriculture was founded in 2024 by MJ Hall and a team of agribusiness professionals with backgrounds in soil science, irrigation systems, and sustainable farming. The company launched with pilot programs across Texas, Idaho, and California before expanding throughout the Midwest and Southwest. Its core technology was developed in response to growing demand for scalable, low-labor soil regeneration tools.\nTechnology\nThe company’s flagship product is a patent-pending, automated microbial bioreactor system that connects to standard 275-gallon totes. It integrates directly into pivot or drip irrigation systems using a programmable injection pump, enabling farmers to dose microbial solutions continuously during watering cycles. This method aims to restore microbial diversity, reduce soil sodium levels, and improve organic matter.\nThe primary product, marketed as SoilPHIX, is a proprietary microbial blend developed to support plant health and nutrient uptake. The system operates on a subscription basis, with regular recharge packs sent to farmers throughout the growing season.\nBusiness Model\nLiving Water Agriculture operates on a subscription-based model. Farmers lease the bioreactor for the growing season and subscribe to regular microbial recharge deliveries. The model is designed to reduce input costs for growers, with bioreactor leasing priced significantly below the per-acre cost of traditional soil amendments.\nField Testing and Adoption\nDuring its 2024 proof-of-concept year, the company deployed its system across several U.S. states and recorded improvements in soil organic carbon, nutrient availability, and water retention. According to internal results and early adopter feedback, participating farms reported improved crop vigor and a reduction in chemical fertilizer use.\nMarket Position\nThe company positions itself within the growing biological input and regenerative agriculture markets, competing with conventional fertilizer producers and newer biotech entrants. Its primary appeal lies in offering farmers a low-maintenance, automated solution to enhance soil health without requiring major changes to their irrigation or nutrient management systems.\nSee also\n* Sustainable agriculture\n* Soil microbiome\n* Biological fertilizer\n* Precision agriculture\nExternal links\n* [https://wesavesoil.com Official website]\nReferences"
