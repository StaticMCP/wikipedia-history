      "text": "# Draft:Aqtala culture\n\nThe Aqtala culture was an early Iron Age culture that flourished around 1000 BCE in the Tarim Basin, possibly as an early wave of Iranian speakers. Its archaeological remains are characterized by gray ceramics and are geographically well-suited to the area where later Khotanese and Tumshuqese languages developed. The Aqtala culture is significant because it may be ancestral to the speakers of these languages, although a direct, solid link to later kingdoms is not yet established."
