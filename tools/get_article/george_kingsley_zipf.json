He worked with Chinese and demographics, and much of his effort can explain properties of the Internet, distribution of income within nations, and many other collections of data.\nZipf's law\nHe is the eponym of Zipf's law, which states that while only a few words are used very often, many or most are used rarely,\n:P_n \\sim 1/n^a\nwhere Pn is the frequency of a word ranked nth and the exponent a is almost 1.  This means that the second item occurs approximately 1/2 as often as the first, and the third item 1/3 as often as the first, and so on. Zipf's discovery of this law in 1935 was one of the first academic studies of word frequency.\nAlthough he originally intended it as a model for linguistics, Zipf later generalized his law to other disciplines. In particular, he observed that the rank vs. frequency distribution of individual incomes in a unified nation approximates this law, and in his 1941 book National Unity and Disunity, he theorized that breaks in this \"normal curve of income distribution\" portend social pressure for change or revolution.\nSee also\n* Zipf–Mandelbrot law\nBibliography\n* Zipf, George Kingsley (1932): Selected Studies of the Principle of Relative Frequency in Language.
