It did not have a regional title, but was composed primarily of recruits from the Midlands, London, and the south of England. Most of its original units had been raised by local communities, and bore the names of their towns or sponsors. After training and home service, it deployed to the Western Front in early 1916 and saw action at the Somme, at Ypres and against the German spring offensive of 1918. Following near-destruction at the Battle of the Lys, the division was reduced to a cadre, which spent the remainder of the war training newly arrived units of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). It was disbanded in July 1919 after the end of the war.\nRecruitment and training\n's recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army.]]\nOn 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The newly-appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'. The K2, K3 and K4 battalions, brigades and divisions followed soon afterwards. But the flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the Army to absorb them, and by the time the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised, many of its constituent units were being organised as 'Pals battalions' under the auspices of mayors and corporations of towns up and down the country. On 10 December 1914 the War Office (WO) authorised the formation of another six divisions and their brigades to command these K5 units, including 39th Division consisting of 116th, 117th and 118th Brigades.\nHowever, on 10 April 1915 the WO decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units. The K4 divisions and brigades were broken up and the K5 formations took over their numbers, so that 39th Division became 32nd Division. A new 39th Division was authorised on 27 April and authorisation for three new infantry brigades – 116th, 117th and 118th – was issued on 12 July 1915, but in practice 116th Bde was created by renumbering 121st Bde from the original 40th Division, and only 117th and 118th were newly-formed.\nThe new 39th Division began to assemble around Winchester in Hampshire early in August 1915, but when it moved to Aldershot at the end of September it still consisted of little more than 117th Bde Headquarters (HQ) and three of its battalions. In November the division moved to Witley Camp in Surrey, where the remaining units joined and it completed its training. Mobilisation orders were received during February 1916, but it was considered that the Pals battalions of 118th Bde were not yet ready for active service. They were left behind and 118th Bde Headquarters (HQ) went to Le Havre in France on 23 February to take over command of five experienced Territorial Force battalions that had been sent as reinforcements to various formations on the Western Front earlier in the war. After some delays the rest of the division began entrainment for Southampton Docks on 2 March. Disembarkation at Le Havre was completed on 8 March and the division concentrated round  Blaringhem in First Army's area by 11 March.\nService\nThe Division took part in the following actions:\n1916\n* Battle of the Somme:\n** Fighting on the Ancre 3 September\n** Battle of Thiepval Ridge 26–28 September\n** Battle of the Ancre Heights 5 October–11 November\n*** Capture of Schwaben Redoubt 14 October\n*** Capture of Stuff Trench 21 October\n** Battle of the Ancre 13–14 November\n1917\n* Third Battle of Ypres:\n** Battle of Pilckem Ridge 31 July–2 August\n** Battle of Langemarck 16–18 August\n** Battle of the Menin Road Ridge 20–25 September\n** Battle of Polygon Wood 26 September\n** Second Battle of Passchendaele 29 October–10 November\n1918\n* German spring offensive:\n** Battle of St Quentin 22–23 March\n** Actions at the Somme Crossings 24–25 March\n** Battle of Bapaume 24–25 March\n** Battle of Rosières 26–27 March\nThe General Officer Commanding, Major-General Edward Feetham, was killed in action on 29 March 1918.\nAfter its heavy casualties, including the loss of its commander, 39th Divisional HQ was withdrawn, but its infantry brigades were combined into a single composite brigade. This brigade as well as the divisional artillery, continued fighting:\n39th Division Composite Brigade:\n* Battle of the Lys:\n** Fighting on Wytschaete Ridge 16 April\n** First Battle of Kemmel Ridge17–19 April)\n** Second Battle of Kemmel Ridge 25–26 April\n** Battle of the Scherpenberg 29 April\n39th Divisional Artillery:\n* Battle of the Avre 4 April\n* Second Battles of Arras:\n** Battle of the Scarpe 26–30 August\n** Battle of the Drocourt-Quéant Line 2–3 September\n* Battles of the Hindenburg Line:\n** Battle of the Canal du Nord 27 September–1 October\n** Battle of Cambrai 8–9 October\n** Pursuit to the Selle 9–12 October\n* Battle of Valenciennes 1–2 November\nduring training under the 39th Battalion, MGC, of British 39th Division, near Moulle, France, 22 May 1918.]]\nOn 6 May 1918 the remnants of the composite brigade rejoined divisional HQ at Eperlecques, near Saint-Omer where the infantry battalions were reduced to Training Cadres (TCs). A TC generally comprised 10 officers and 45 ORs and their surplus personnel were drafted as reinforcements to other units. A large number of TCs from other formations were also transferred into 39th Division, and on 7 May they began preparing the 77th US Division for front-line service. On 7 June 39th Divisional HQ moved to Wolphus, also near Saint-Omer, and over the next two months its TCs trained the 30th, 78th and 80th US Divisions in turn. In mid-August 39th Division moved to the French coast. On 1 November the division. was ordered to demobilise its remaining TCs, and this was completed before hostilities ended when the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November. 117th and 118th Bdes were disbanded on 18 November and 4 December respectively, but 197th Bde joined on 18 November from Line of communication duties and the division took over No 2 Line of Communication Reception Camp (for malarial convalescents) at Martin-Église, was redesignated 117th Bde on 19 November. In December 116th Bde HQ went to Le Havre to form the staff of the embarkation camp, while in January 1919 197th Bde moved to the General Base Reinforcement Depot at No 8 Camp, Le Havre. The transport was disbanded on 29 January, except 287th Company, which became Fifth Army Horse Transport Vehicle Reception Park until it disbanded on 25 April. 39th Divisional HQ moved to Rouen on 5 March and in June its remaining units were gradually disbanded. Divisional HQ closed down on 10 July 1919.\nOrder of battle\nThe following formations and units served with the division:\n116th Brigade\n''Originally numbered 121st Bde intended for the 40th Division of the Fifth New Army; renumbered 12 July 1915.
