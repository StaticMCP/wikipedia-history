The song was used by Chrysler in their \"PacifiKids\" 2016 Christmas commercial. A remix by Seeb was released on November 18, 2016.\nComposition\nThe song has been described as having a pop rhythm with an \"electro\" tinge. Ryan Tedder, the lead vocalist of OneRepublic, told Entertainment Weekly that \"the song was inspired by the sweeping, 80s-style synthpop of acts like M83\".\nThe song is written in the key of D major with a common time tempo of 100 beats per minute. The vocals span from E3 to F#5 in the song.\nMusic video\nThe official music video was released on August 25, 2016, through Vevo. It was directed by Hal Kirkland and produced by Here Be Dragons. The video featured the band members (except Drew Brown) in Mexico City. Views of the Angel of Independence, Soumaya Museum, Palace of Fine Arts, and the Monument to the Revolution were seen in the video. It follows the story of a young couple meeting and attending a OneRepublic concert in an outdoor alleyway. A virtual reality version of the music video, created with the Nokia OZO, was also produced. The music video has currently received more than 84 million views.\nTrack listing\n| title1 = Kids\n| note1 = acoustic\n| length1 = 3:40\n}}\n| title1 = Kids\n| length1 = 4:00\n| title2 = Wherever I Go\n| note2 = Danny Dove radio edit\n| length2 = 3:08\n}}\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016–2017)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 63\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP)\n| 153\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI)\n| 70\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (Recorded Music NZ)\n| 1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Slovenia (SloTop50)\n| 32\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan)\n| 63\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|UK  Cross Rhythms Annual Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|15\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease date\n{|class=wikitable\n!
