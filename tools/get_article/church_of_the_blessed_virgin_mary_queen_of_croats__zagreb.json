It is located in the neighbourhood Remetinec, which is characterized by predominantly low-rise residential construction. The church does not dominate the urban space with its architecture and is not a visual landmark in the wider urban context. The sacral complex includes the church and the rectory, which are spatially connected. Their arrangement on the plot forms a spacious access square, which has a pronounced public character, while its private function is less pronounced. The square is oriented towards the main road and is conceived as an extension of the public city space.\nThe dimensions of the church are 20×18 meters. The church area is 360 m2, and the choir is 97 m2. The church building also includes a rectory with a sacristy, a parish office, a religious education hall, and living quarters for the pastor and other staff. The church is square in shape with a square apse at the end. The apse contains a statue of the Mother of God, as well as space for priests and altar boys. To the right of the altar is the tabernacle and a statue of St. Joseph. The altar, baptistery, and ambo are made of stone, straight-lined and unadorned. Below the choir, to the left of the entrance door, is the baptistery. To the right of the entrance door is the confessional and an altar with a statue of St. Anthony.\nGallery\nFile:Župna crkva Blažene Djevice Marije Kraljice Hrvata u Zagrebu 02.jpg|Entrance and facade\nFile:Župna crkva Blažene Djevice Marije Kraljice Hrvata u Zagrebu 03.jpg|Side facade, view from the street\nFile:Župna crkva Blažene Djevice Marije Kraljice Hrvata u Zagrebu 01.jpg|Interior of the church\nReferences\nExternal links"
