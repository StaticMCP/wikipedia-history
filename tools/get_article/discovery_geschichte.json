The channel launched on 31 March 2005, on the Premiere platform.\nOverview\nThe service was discontinued as a full 24-hour channel on 16 May 2009, after Premiere had signed a new contract with Discovery Networks Deutschland in preparation for Premiere's relaunch as Sky Deutschland in July. On Premiere, Discovery Geschichte was replaced by National Geographic Channel Germany the following day. Discovery Geschichte continues as a programming block on DMAX.\nReferences\nExternal links"
