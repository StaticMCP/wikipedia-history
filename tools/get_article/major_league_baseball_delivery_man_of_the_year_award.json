It was initially part of a sponsorship agreement between MLB and package delivery company DHL Express; DHL's sponsorship ran from 2005 to 2010. There was also a Delivery Man of the Month Award. From its inception in 2005 through 2008, the award was given to a single reliever who was selected online by fans from a group of 10 finalists chosen by an MLB panel. The panel took sole responsibility to select the annual winner starting in 2009.\nMariano Rivera was the only pitcher to win the annual award more than once, receiving it in 2005, 2006, and 2009. The award was discontinued after 2013, replaced by the Reliever of the Year Awards.\nList of annual winners\nwon the Delivery Man of the Year Award in 2007.|alt=A man prepares to deliver a baseball pitch, holding the ball behind his body with his right hand.
