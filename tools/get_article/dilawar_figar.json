He was known as  Shehansha-e-Zarafat (King of humor) and Akbar-e-Sani (Akbar the Second, after the late poet Akbar Allahabadi) for his satire and humour.\nEarly life and career\nDilawar Figar was born as Dilawar Hussain on July 8, 1929 in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh, British India. He received his early education in his hometown, and later joined Agra University where he received his M.A. degree in (Urdu). He also did his M.A. in (English) and M.A. in (Economics). He associated himself with the teaching profession.\nHe migrated to Pakistan from India in 1968 and settled in Karachi. He joined Abdullah Haroon College as a teacher, where the renowned poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz was the principal at that time. Figar taught Urdu literature there.

During a literary gathering on 31 January 1993 at Karachi Arts Council, he himself once described his imaginary death and how he left for the heavens and was refused entry into paradise by the guard angels because he had arrived before his scheduled time. The guard angels asked him to come back after five years and sent him back to earth. The audience laughed it off at that time but he proved to be approximately right about his actual time of death &ndash; nearly 5 years later.\nContribution to Urdu literature\nFigar started writing in 1942 at the age of fourteen and soon got help of fellow writers, Maulvi Jam Nawai Badayuni, Maulana Jami Badayuni.
