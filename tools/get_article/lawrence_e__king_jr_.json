He was the manager and treasurer of the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union (FCFCU) and the Vice Chairman for Finance of the National Black Republican Council. He was arrested and given a 15-year prison sentence in 1991 for financial fraud, after the FCFCU collapsed in 1988. King was also the target of conspiracy theories, accusing him of being involved in sex trafficking and the sexual abuse of children, though all related charges were dropped.\nCareer\nHe earned a business degree from the University of Nebraska Omaha in 1972, and in 1970 became the manager and treasurer of the newly founded Franklin Community Federal Credit Union (FCFCU) in Omaha's predominantly African-American community, supporting low income households. Under King's leadership, Franklin was promoted as a model community-based credit union. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, King was active in Omaha's civic life – serving on boards of local charities (such as the Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCA, Campfire Girls, Head Start, the Salvation Army, the Omaha Ballet, and many more) and church organizations – and earned a reputation as an ambitious, charismatic figure in the city. King was also known for his love of music and often performed as a singer. King also owned several bars and restaurants in Omaha.\nRise in Republican politics\nBy the early 1980s, Larry King Jr. had become a rising star in the Republican Party, both in Nebraska and nationally. An African-American Republican, King helped revitalize the Nebraska Black Republican Council and became its state chairman in 1982. His success drew attention from national GOP leaders: he was appointed Vice Chairman for Finance of the National Black Republican Council (an affiliate of the Republican National Committee) and served on the advisory committee for President Ronald Reagan's second inauguration in January 1985. King was even a featured performer at high-profile GOP events – notably singing the American national anthem at the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas. By the mid-1980s, his political connections extended \"all the way to the White House\", as one account later noted.\nFranklin Credit Union collapse\nKing's success came to an abrupt end in 1988 when federal regulators uncovered widespread financial malfeasance at the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union. On November 4, 1988, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) raided and shut down Franklin after finding evidence that tens of millions of dollars were missing. Investigators discovered that King had been running a massive embezzlement scheme: he kept a secret set of books and sold fraudulent certificates of deposit to inflate the credit union's assets. According to lawsuits filed by the NCUA, about $34–40 million in funds were unaccounted for – one of the largest credit-union failures in US history.\nReports at the time detailed King's lavish lifestyle, which stood in stark contrast to the credit union's community mission. On a modest official salary, King lived \"in affluence\" – using chartered private jets and limousines and maintaining a $5,000-per-month home in Washington, D.C., along Embassy Row. He drove a new Mercedes-Benz and spent freely on luxury clothing, jewelry, and entertainment, expenses allegedly paid for with Franklin's money. In late 1988, a federal judge froze King's assets and appointed a receiver after concluding that the missing funds were at risk of being hidden or dissipated. King denied any wrongdoing, insisting that he had financed his extravagant lifestyle with legitimate income, but he refused media interviews.\nTrial and conviction\nFederal grand juries and FBI investigators soon began probing Franklin's collapse. In 1989, King and several associates were indicted for financial crimes related to the credit union's failure. Faced with overwhelming evidence, King eventually pleaded guilty in 1991 to embezzling approximately $39 million from Franklin accounts. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for fraud. NCUA officials ultimately tallied the credit union's losses at nearly $40 million, reflecting the scope of King's long-running fraud.\nChild prostitution ring allegations\nEven as the financial investigation was underway, a far more explosive scandal began to envelop Larry King Jr. in late 1988: allegations of a child prostitution ring centered on King and other prominent figures. Shortly after the credit union's collapse, rumors emerged that some of the missing Franklin money had been used to finance child sexual exploitation. In November–December 1988, Nebraska's Foster Care Review Board turned over to state lawmakers a dossier of reports alleging that children in foster care had been abused at parties attended by elites. These allegations, made by alleged victims, accused King of procuring and abusing children and hosting wild late-night \"sex parties\" at which minors were flown to various U.S. cities, \"auctioned off\" as sexual slaves, given drugs, and forced into illegal sex acts. By early 1989, dozens of prominent Nebraskans – businessmen, media personalities, police, clergy – and even national political figures – were being whispered about as possible co-conspirators, with King depicted as a central ringleader.\nKing categorically denied the accusations, dismissing them as \"garbage\" and claiming he was being framed. Nevertheless, the sensational reports gained traction. In response, the Nebraska Legislature in January 1989 established an investigative panel (the \"Franklin Committee\") to examine both the credit union's financial failure and the emerging child abuse allegations. State Senator Loran Schmit chaired the committee (with Senator Ernie Chambers as vice-chair), and it hired a private investigator, Gary Caradori, to dig into the claims. Law enforcement at multiple levels – local Omaha police, the Nebraska State Patrol, the FBI, and federal prosecutors – also opened inquiries into the alleged \"Franklin child prostitution ring\", as the case came to be known.\nDuring 1989, Caradori and the Franklin Committee interviewed purported victims and witnesses. At least half a dozen young adults (most of them former wards of the state or ex-students of the Boys Town home) told stories of abuse at the hands of King and others. They claimed that as minors in the early-to-mid 1980s, they had attended lavish parties in Omaha and elsewhere where children were molested by older men, prominent officials, and businessmen. Some allegations went beyond abuse and included claims of ritual satanic abuse, drug trafficking, and even CIA-linked arms deals associated with the supposed sex ring. Media coverage of the Franklin case intensified in 1989 and 1990: local news outlets ran headlines about the \"explosive\" allegations, and in April 1990 The Washington Post dubbed the affair \"''Omaha's Hurricane of Scandal''\".\nThe Franklin Committee's investigation took a tragic turn in July 1990, when lead investigator Gary Caradori and his 8-year-old son were killed in a small-plane crash. Caradori's plane mysteriously broke apart in mid-air over Illinois as he was returning from a trip to collect evidence (he had reportedly obtained photographs said to implicate King). The wreck sparked immediate suspicion – Caradori's briefcase, allegedly full of new evidence, went missing from the crash site – and fueled theories that he had been murdered to suppress the investigation. Caradori's death, combined with anonymous threats on accusers, led several key witnesses to recant their stories in 1990. Both the FBI and Nebraska authorities came to view the allegations as potentially fabricated, and they warned witnesses that making false reports could lead to perjury charges.\nTrial\nIn mid-1990, after hearing months of testimony, a Nebraska state grand jury (in Douglas County) concluded in July 1990 that the widely publicized tales of a child sex ring were unfounded. In a sharply worded report, the grand jury declared the affair a \"carefully crafted hoax\". A federal grand jury convened soon after and reached the same conclusion – in September 1990, it also found the abuse allegations to be baseless and agreed there was no organized child prostitution ring in Omaha. The grand jurors did not specify who they believed engineered the false stories, but they took the remarkable step of indicting two of the accusers for perjury. One of those indicted was Alisha Owen, a 21-year-old former foster child who had been one of the chief accusers claiming King sexually abused her. The other indictment remained sealed but was widely reported to be against Paul Bonacci, a young man who had also described being victimized. Owen was ultimately convicted of perjury in 1991 and sentenced to 9 to 15 years in prison. Her sentence was notably harsh for a perjury case, reflecting the court's view that the Franklin accusations had caused enormous harm to reputations. (Owen served over four years in prison before being paroled in the mid-1990s.) Paul Bonacci, the other main accuser, was indicted but never convicted of perjury; prosecutors dropped his case, possibly in exchange for his testimony.\nConspiracy theories\nIn 1992, former Nebraska state senator John DeCamp published a book, The Franklin Cover-Up, which fiercely criticized the official investigations and claimed that a political cover-up had hidden the truth of King's child exploitation ring. DeCamp's book (and later works by other authors) alleged that King's crimes went far beyond financial fraud, painting him as the linchpin of a nationwide child-trafficking network with links to Washington power brokers. These claims – which included lurid details of satanic ritual abuse and even murder – were never substantiated by any court or law enforcement agency, but they kept conspiracy theories about the Franklin case alive in some circles. A 1993 British television documentary (Conspiracy of Silence) that investigated the Franklin allegations was produced but never aired, which conspiracy proponents interpreted as further evidence of a suppression of truth. Meanwhile, mainstream journalists and scholars have frequently pointed to the Franklin case as an example of the \"satanic panic\" of the late 1980s – a period when sensational claims of ritual abuse and sex trafficking emerged in several communities, only to be debunked.\nLater life\nHe served about 10 years of his 15-year sentence in federal prison (under parole guidelines of the time) and was released in the early 2000s. Upon release, King kept a very low profile, avoiding all publicity. He did not grant interviews about the Franklin matters, nor did he attempt to return to political or public life. In 1999, while King was still incarcerated, Paul Bonacci (one of his accusers) filed a civil lawsuit against him in federal court, seeking damages for alleged sexual abuse. King did not respond or appear in the case, and in default the judge awarded Bonacci a $1 million judgment in 1999, although this money was never paid. John DeCamp touted the outcome as a validation of the abuse claims, though it was a default judgment not tested at trial. A 2023 CNN report on the enduring mysteries of the Franklin scandal noted that King declined to respond to inquiries sent to him.\nReferences"
