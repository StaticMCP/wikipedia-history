The Vikings compete as members of the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference for all 14 varsity sports. The Vikings joined the NSIC from the North Central Conference, which folded in 2008.\nProject 2030\nIn December 2018, as part of a plan called \"Project 2030\", Augustana announced its intentions to transition to NCAA Division I by 2030 at the latest, with hopes to receive a bid to join a Division I conference by 2020. Multiple regional media reports in 2018 indicated that Augustana's likeliest Division I destination was the Sioux Falls-based Summit League. Many of the school's boosters are tied to Sanford Health, a hospital company also based in Sioux Falls that has long been a major sponsor of the Summit League. Additionally, the conference moved its headquarters in 2018 to an office complex owned by Sanford.\nOn May 22, 2020, the Summit League commissioner, Tom Douple, informed Augustana president Stephanie Herseth Sandlin that the conference would not be adding the Vikings. Despite the snub from the Summit League, Augustana launched a Division I men's ice hockey program in 2023, marking their first Division I sport. As of 2024, plans for a transition to Division I in sports outside hockey have effectively ended. Summit League commissioner Josh Fenton stated in an interview that they have not had discussions about adding Augustana anymore, partially due to the school's pivot towards Division I hockey, a sport the Summit League does not sponsor. Additionally, the university stated they are no longer actively pursuing any Division I all-sports conferences, instead opting to focus on their Division I hockey program.\nVarsity sports\n{| class= wikitable\n! width= 150px style=\"\"| Men's sports\n! width= 150px style=\"\"| Women's sports\n|-\n| Baseball || Acrobatics and tumbling\n|-\n| Basketball || Basketball\n|-\n| Cross Country || Cross Country\n|-\n| Football|| Golf\n|-\n| Golf || Soccer\n|-\n| Ice Hockey || Softball\n|-\n| Swimming and diving || Swimming and diving\n|-\n| Tennis || Tennis\n|-\n| Track & Field || Track & Field\n|-\n| Wrestling || Volleyball\n|}\nNational championships\nNCAA\n* 1991 – Softball\n* 2011 – Women's Cross Country\n* 2016 – Men's Basketball\n* 2018 – Baseball\n* 2019 – Softball\nIndividual programs\nFootball\n, seats over 6,500 fans]]\nOn September 26, 2007, it was officially announced that Bob and Kari Hall were making a $7.1 million donation for an on-campus football stadium.
