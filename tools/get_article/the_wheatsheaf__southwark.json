Established in the 18th century, it has become a prominent landmark and a popular drinking establishment in the area, known for its rich history and traditional pub atmosphere.\nLocation\nThe Wheatsheaf is situated in the heart of Southwark, an area known for its vibrant history and close proximity to the River Thames. It is located near significant London landmarks such as the Shard, Borough Market, and Southwark Cathedral, making it a frequented spot by both locals and tourists.\nArchitecture and features\nIt was rebuilt in 1840. The building was Grade II listed in 1998, it being noted that the interior was well preserved.\nThe pub closed for four years beginning in 2009, during which the top storey was removed to make way for the Thameslink Programme viaduct. A competing Red Car Pubs venue opened nearby, but now uses the name \"Sheaf\".\nThe 2017 London Bridge attack also took place in the surrounding area, with people stabbed in the Wheatsheaf and other nearby pubs and restaurants, and with all three attackers, wearing what turned out to be fake explosive vests shot dead outside the Wheatsheaf by police marksmen at 10:16pm on Friday 3 June.\nThe Wheatsheaf exhibits classic British pub architecture with a distinctive façade that features period elements reflective of its long history. Inside, the pub retains much of its traditional charm with wooden beams, a cozy fireplace, and decor that echoes its historic past. The interior is designed to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere, characteristic of classic British pubs.\nCultural significance\nThe Wheatsheaf is not only a place for drinking and dining but also serves as a cultural hub in Southwark. It has been mentioned in various literary works and local histories, reflecting its status as an integral part of the community. The pub often hosts live music events, pub quizzes, and other community gatherings, making it a central social spot in the area.\nMenu and offerings\nThe Wheatsheaf offers a range of traditional British pub fare alongside a selection of beers, ales, and spirits. The menu features classic dishes such as fish and chips, bangers and mash, and Sunday roasts. The drink selection includes local and regional ales, providing patrons with a taste of British brewing tradition.\nReferences"
