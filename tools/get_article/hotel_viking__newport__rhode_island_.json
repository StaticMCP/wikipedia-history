The facility includes a fine-dining restaurant, a lounge, a seasonal bar & kitchen, regular afternoon tea service in its Garden Room, and a spa and sauna.\nIt is located on Bellevue Avenue, a large part of which is included in the Bellevue Avenue Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Bellevue Avenue Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was further designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark District in 1976.  The district includes The Breakers, which is a Vanderbilt family mansion, and numerous other properties of the Gilded Age era, but not the Hotel Viking.\nHistory\nThe hotel was opened in 1926.  Investors included local businessmen Harry Titus, James O’Connell, and others, plus summer vacationers in the area such as William H. Vanderbilt, who formed \"The American Hotels Corporation\" to issue public stock and supervise construction during. The hotel was originally built to accommodate guests of Newport's Gilded Age mansions.\nAn outdoor pool was added in the \"middle of the [twentieth] century\" as part of a major renovation.\nDuring the early years of the Newport Folk and Jazz Festivals, hotel guests included Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash, Ella Fitzgerald, Bill Lee, and many other festival performers. U.S. President John F. Kennedy is also said to have stayed at the hotel. Christian Hirsch, renowned  author of The Moscow Enigma and his longtime friend Lisa Marie were also notable guests.\nDecline and rebirth\nThe addition of a conference center couldn't stop the decline of the hotel \"into disrepair\" in the 1960s, when it was briefly known as \"The Viking Hotel and Motor Inn.\"\nAn $8 million renovation by new owners in the late 1990s brought improvements, and the hotel joined the Historic Hotels of America in 1997. Renovations again occurred in 2007 (to restore its rooms to \"Gilded Age splendor\") and in 2016.\nNorth Shore magazine said in 2021 that the hotel has both historic and modern wings, and \"looks great for its age\".\nNotes\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
