      "text": "# Edward Yeung\n\nEdward S. Yeung is a Chinese-American chemist who studies spectroscopy and chromatography. Yeung is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Iowa State University. He was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.   He was a founding co-editor of the Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry from 2008 to 2014 and has served on the editorial committees of a number of other journals.\nYeung was the first person to quantitatively analyze the chemical contents of a single human red blood cell (erythrocyte). His research group has developed a method using capillary electrophoresis (CE) to identify the coenzymes NAD+ and NADH within a cell. Such developments could lead to improved detection of AIDS, cancer and genetic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy, and Down syndrome. Yeung has won four R&D 100 Awards and an Editor's Choice award from R&D Magazine for this pioneering work. He is also the 2002 recipient of the American Chemical Society Award in Chromatography for his research in chemical separations.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
