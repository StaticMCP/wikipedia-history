His father, John Naylor, was organist of York Minster. He won a choral scholarship to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he gained a BA in 1887. From 1888 to 1892 he studied at the Royal College of Music. After spending eight years as organist of London churches St. Michael's Church, Chester Square (1889) and St. Mary's Church, Kilburn (1896), Naylor returned to Cambridge in 1898, where he became an assistant master at The Leys School and organist of Emmanuel College. Naylor lived in Cambridge until his death in 1934.\nHis most important compositions were for voices; his composition The Angelus, won the Ricordi prize for an English opera. His church music blends elements of 16th to 20th century music. Naylor was considered an authority on Shakespeare and music, and was an early exponent of greater musical authenticity.\nHis son, Bernard James Naylor (1907–1986) was the first composer (1948) living in Canada to employ post-tonal writing in choral music, and was one of the pioneers of a truly contemporary (post-tonal) English (Anglican) cathedral music in the mid-twentieth century.\nIncomplete list of musical works\nChamber music\n* Quintet\n* Piano Trio in D Minor.\nChorus and Orchestra\n* Merlin and the Glen – A scena, performed at the Royal College of Music when he was a student.\n* Requiem, Pax Dei, influenced by Giuseppe Verdi and Charles Villiers Stanford, performed in Cambridge in 1913.\n* Arthur the King – a cantata aired at Harrogate in 1902.\nOpera\n* The Angelus – \"A romantic opera in a Prologue and four Acts\", performed at Covent Garden in 1909, revived by the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1921.
