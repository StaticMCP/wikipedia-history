According to the scholar and sociologist Hratch Tchilingirian, \"this kind of re-writing of \"history\" is based solely on sources produced by Azerbaijani authors, notably prominent academician and national figure Ziya Buniyatov, whom President Heydar Aliyev described as \"the constructor of our identity and self-consciousness\". This constructed narrative is echoed in the political discourse of President Aliyev and is woven into state policies, diplomacy, public relations, identity construction and, critically, in the construction of extreme anti-Armenianism in Azerbaijan.\"\nSee also\n*Cabinet of Azerbaijan\n*Tourism in Azerbaijan\n*Culture of Azerbaijan\n*Architecture of Azerbaijan\nReferences"
