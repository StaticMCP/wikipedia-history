The category was established at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2022, and is a sister category to the Children's and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's or Family Viewing Series and the Children's and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Preschool Series, which target shows aimed at younger audiences.\nThe current holder of the award is the Disney+ fantasy Percy Jackson and the Olympians, which won at the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards. Programming aimed towards children and young adults was honored from 1974 to 2021 with the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Series, which was presented under various names across its lifespan, and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program, which was presented from 1950 to 2020. Following the establishment of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards, both categories were discontinued.\nWinners and nominations\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"10%\" | Series\n! width=\"30%\" | Producers\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n! width=\"3%\" | Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2022(1st)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n|'Heartstopper(Season 1)\n| Iain Canning, Hakan Kousetta, Jamie Laurenson, Euros Lyn, Alice Oseman, Emile Sherman, Patrick Walters (executive producers); Simon Gillis (co-executive producer); Zorana Piggott (producer); Dylan Rees (line producer)'\n| Netflix\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| Doogie Kameāloha, M.D.\n| Jesse Bochco, Dayna Bochco, Kourtney Kang, Jake Kasdan, Matt Kuhn, Melvin Mar, Justin McEwen, Erin O’Malley (executive producers); Alison Bennett, Steve Joe (co-executive producers); Megan Mascena, Sasha Stroman (producers)\n| Disney+\n|-\n| First Day\n| Libby Doherty (executive producer); Kate Butler, Kirsty Stark (producers); Julie Kalceff (co-producer)\n| Hulu\n|-\n| High School Musical: The Musical: The Series\n| Tim Federle (executive producer); Emilia Serrano (co-executive producer); Kimberly McCullough, Zach Dodes (supervising producers); Greg Hampson, Mary Pantelidis, Carrie Rosen (producers)\n| rowspan=2| Disney+\n|-\n|The Mysterious Benedict Society\n| James Bobin, David Ellender, Phil Hay, Matt Loze, Matt Manfredi, Deepak Nayar, Karen Kehela Sherwood, Todd Slavkin, Darren Swimmer, Jamie Tarses (executive producers); Greg Beeman, Grace Gilroy, Chelsey Lora (co-executive producers); Tony Hale (producer)\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2023(2nd)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| The Crossover\n| Kwame Alexander, Maverick Carter, Daveed Diggs, Kimberly Ann Harrison, Todd Harthan, Jamal Henderson, Lebron James, Damani Johnson, Jay Marcus, Erin O’Malley, Robert Prinz, Bob Teitel, George Tillman Jr., Lezlie Wills (executive producers); Valerie C.
