The area is used for farming with some rural residential development. In the , Foreshores had a population of 142 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded to the north by the Coral Sea. It includes both a mainland component to the south and Hummock Hill Island to the north (), which are separated by the Colosseum Inlet (). There are wetlands on both sides of the inlet. The crossing between the mainland and the island is sufficiently shallow that sheep can cross at low tide.\nHummock Hill Island is . As the name suggests, the island's main feature is Hummock Hill (), rising  above sea level.\nThe Bruce Highway and the North Coast railway line pass through the south-western part of the locality from Bororen to Iveragh.\nAll parts of the sea within the locality are within the Great Barrier Reef Coast Marine Park. The south-western corner of the locality is within the Castle Tower National Park.\nThe land along Intrepid Drive is used rural residential purposes. Otherwise the predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation with a small area of plantation timber. As at 2025, there is no land use on Hummock Island.\nHistory\nThe origin of the locality is not recorded, but presumably relate to its coastal location.\nIn March 1880, there was a sale of pastoral leases on Hummock Hill Island, which sold for  per square mile,  over the upset price.\nIn 1916, Thomas Farmer was successfully raising sheep on the island.\nIn 1921, John James Athelstane Murray (1859-1936), son of John Murray, purchased Hummock Hill Island and lived there until his death in 1936.\nDemographics\nIn the , Foreshores had a population of 135 people.\nIn the , Foreshores had a population of 142 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Foreshores. The nearest government primary schools are in Bororen State School in neighbouring Bororen to the south and Benaraby State School in Benaraby to the west. The nearest government secondary school is Tannum Sands State High School in Tannum Sands to the north-west.\nProposed development\nIn 2019, the Queensland Government conditionally approved a residential and tourist development on Hummock Hill Island. The development will consist of 2,500 residences with 770 of them intended for permanent housing, along with an airstrip, shops and a golf course and is expected to cost $1.2 billion. It includes a bridge from the mainland to the island. The Gladstone Regional Council has opposed the development.\nReferences"
