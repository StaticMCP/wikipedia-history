It was released on November 13, 2012, under Roadrunner Records. It is the final release to include bassist Adam Duce who left the band in early 2013. The album was recorded at Central, Manchester on December 6, 2011 (except Locust & Halo recorded at SECC, Glasgow on December 5, 2011).\nFrontman Robb Flynn said, \"The Head Cases [Machine Head's nickname for their fans] have been so intense on this tour cycle that we had to start capturing the shows, especially with technology making it so much easier to record\". \"We culled some of the best nights where the band and crowd were on fire and made a badass, nearly two-hour, double live album, which is a great documentation of where the band is at, 18 years deep.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Machine Head\n*Robb Flynn – lead vocals,  rhythm guitar\n*Phil Demmel – lead guitar, backing vocals\n*Adam Duce – bass, backing vocals\n*Dave McClain – drums\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2001)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (ARIA)\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria)\n|align=\"center\"|56\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders)\n|align=\"center\"|110\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)\n|align=\"center\"|124\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|French Albums (SNEP)\n|align=\"center\"|115\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)\n|align=\"center\"|62\n|}\nReferences"
