It was shown in the Wonders of Life pavilion at Walt Disney World Resort's Epcot when the pavilion was open. After closing in 2007, through 2018, the theater remained open during the International Food & Wine Festival; however, the film being shown was about food.\nDescription\nMartin Short tells the story about how we are born, by explaining how his parents met during the course of their lives - at a high school dance, getting married, on their honeymoon, and having their first child.\nThe film also explains the process of fertilization between sperm and egg cells in an animated segment that lasts about 1 minute and 30 seconds, as well as fetal development by using imagery taken by Lennart Nilsson (previously appeared in Nova's \"Miracle of Life\".)\nThe attraction closed along with the rest of the pavilion on January 1, 2007.  During the 2007 Epcot Food & Wine Festival, the marquee located outside the theater was covered by a curtain. During 2008, it was once again visible, but the film did not show.\nFrom 2008 through 2018, the theater had been used to screen \"Seasons of the Vine\", a film previously shown at Disney California Adventure, during the Food and Wine Festival. During the Flower and Garden Festival, the theater was called The Garden Theatre.\nBackground\nAccording to producers, the film was \"...somewhat a departure for a Disney attraction\", and mentions that the film \"may elicit controversy\" in regards to the issue of abortion, the intent was \"to not walk into the teeth of the (abortion) issue.\"\nGiven that birth and conception is considered a sensitive issue among families, an advisory sign was placed near the entrance to the theater, in order to advise parents to decide whether the film is suitable for their children.\nSee also\n* Epcot attraction and entertainment history\n* Wonders of Life\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
