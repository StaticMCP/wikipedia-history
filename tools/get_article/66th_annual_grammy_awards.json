In its 21st year at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, the ceremony was broadcast on CBS and available to stream on Paramount+, and was hosted by Trevor Noah for the fourth time.\nThe nominations were announced on November 10, 2023; SZA received the most nominations with nine, followed by Victoria Monét, Phoebe Bridgers (solo and as part of boygenius), and Serban Ghenea with seven each. Monét's 2-year-old daughter, Hazel, became the youngest nominee in Grammy Awards history; she was a featured artist on her mother's song \"Hollywood\", which was nominated for Best Traditional R&B Performance.\nBridgers was the night's biggest winner, receiving four awards: Three as part of Boygenius (Best Rock Song, Best Rock Performance, and Best Alternative Music Album), and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance alongside SZA. SZA, Monét, and Killer Mike received three awards each. Taylor Swift made history as the first singer to win Album of the Year four times, and Swift announced the release of her album The Tortured Poets Department while accepting the award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Engineer Serban Ghenea extended his record with a fifth award in the category as well. South African singer Tyla was the winner of the inaugural Best African Performance award.\nIn the big four categories, Swift's Midnights won the aforementioned Album of the Year prize; Miley Cyrus's \"Flowers\" won Record of the Year; Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas won Song of the Year for \"What Was I Made For?\" (from the soundtrack of Barbie); and Victoria Monét took home Best New Artist.\nBackground\nFor the 2024 ceremony, the academy announced several changes for different categories, the introduction of new categories, and updates on eligibility rules:\nCategory changes\n*Three new categories – Best African Music Performance, Best Alternative Jazz Album and Best Pop Dance Recording – were added. There are 94 categories total.\n*Two categories, Producer of the Year, Non-Classical and Songwriter of the Year, Non-Classical, were moved to the General Field and can now be voted on by the entire Grammy voting membership.\n*The number of nominees in the \"Big Four\" General Field categories (Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist) was reduced again from ten to eight.\n*In order to qualify as a nominee on a project nominated for Album of the Year, the credited [lead] artists, featured artists, songwriters, producers, engineers, mixers and mastering engineers must play on a total of 20% of an album's playing time. There had previously been no minimum level of involvement required at the preceding two Grammy Awards.\n*The requirement that a project must include at least 51% performance-based material has been removed from the Best Music Film category.\n*Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano) has been renamed Best Música Mexicana Album (including Tejano).\n*Best Improvised Jazz Solo has been renamed Best Jazz Solo Performance.\nField changes\nThe Grammy ballot was reduced from 26 fields to 11, not including the General Field. The Recording Academy stated that this was done to ensure that all voting members were able to exercise all 10 of their allocated votes, as this was prevented when some fields only contained one category. In addition to their votes in the General Field, voters are encouraged to cast up to ten genre category votes spread across a maximum of three fields. As of the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, the fields are listed as follows:\nArtificial intelligence ineligibility\nOn June 16, 2023, in response to the rapidly developing field of artificial intelligence (AI), the Recording Academy declared that \"only human creators are eligible to be submitted for consideration for, nominated for, or win a Grammy Award. A work that contains no human authorship is not eligible in any categories.\" The organization further specified that works featuring AI-generated material are eligible for an award only if a human contributed to the work meaningfully in the creation process and that contributors of only AI-generated material are not eligible for an award. This controversy was cleared up when the song \"Heart on My Sleeve\" by ghostwriter977, which uses AI voice cloning to mimic the vocals of Drake and The Weeknd, was submitted for Grammy consideration. While the song was written by a human, it was deemed ineligible due to its AI vocals, illegal usage of those vocals without clearance by either artists' record labels, and lack of commercial availability.\nPerformers\nThe first three performers for the ceremony, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, and Olivia Rodrigo, were announced on January 15, 2024. The second batch of performers, consisting of Travis Scott, Luke Combs and Burna Boy, were announced on January 21. Billy Joel, who performed on the Grammys for the first time in 22 years, was announced on January 25, the same day that the performers for the Premiere ceremony were revealed to be J. Ivy, Jordin Sparks, Larkin Poe, Pentatonix, Sheila E, Laufey and more. U2 joined the lineup on January 27, with a performance from their U2:UV residency at Sphere in Las Vegas. Joni Mitchell, who made her debut performance at the ceremony, was announced on January 28. SZA joined the lineup on January 29. Performers for the In Memoriam segment were announced on February 2, with Miley Cyrus confirmed to perform in the ceremony on the same day. Playboi Carti also performed with Travis Scott.\nPremiere ceremony\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+List of performers at the premiere ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" |Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Song(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | J.
