Dan Einav of The Financial Times states, \"Unlike Oppenheimer, the series looks beyond those who actively shaped seismic events to those helplessly caught in history.\" Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph calls it, \"a nine-part documentary series about the Cold War uses Christopher Nolan’s Oscar-winning film as a convenient springboard.\"\nIn an aberrant review excluded from Rotten Tomatoes, Noah Rothman of the conservative American magazine National Review, dubs it, \"The Worst Cold War Documentary Ever Made\".\nSee also\n* Turning Point: 9/11 and the War on Terror\n* Turning Point: The Vietnam War\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
