The band consisted of Tom Conrad, Sean Van Vleet, Max Steger, and Mike Robinson.\nBackground\nIn early 2008, Empires was formed when longtime friends guitarist Tom Conrad approached singer Sean Van Vleet about writing music together. Conrad and Van Vleet spent the year writing music together, and the induction of the other band members soon followed, Max Steger, Ryan Luciani and Al Smith.  The band's name, \"Empires\", was thought of by Tom Conrad and Sean Van Vleet at the same time, albeit on opposite sides of Chicago (Tom was on the 'L' Train at the time, while Sean was at their shared apartment).\nThe band has consistently mentioned having a very DIY ethic when it comes to recording and releasing music with Max Steger as their producer / engineer, Tom Conrad as a designer and Sean Van Vleet as a writer.  In 2014, the band's third full-length studio album, Orphan, was produced by John Congleton and released on Island Records / Chop Shop Records.\nEmpires made their national television debut on David Letterman on June 17, 2014.\nEmpires would have their song How good does it feel Featured on the NHL 15 Soundtrack in 2014.\nLead singer Sean Van Vleet confirmed in an Instagram comment on August 23, 2017, that the band was no longer making music.\nDiscography\n*HOWL (2008)\n*BANG EP (2010)\n*Garage Hymns (2012)\n*How Good Does It Feel EP (2014)\n*Orphan (2014)\nTour history\nEmpires has performed and toured alongside such artists: Geographer, Alkaline Trio, Kaiser Chiefs, The Whigs, Augustines, Deerhunter, Saint Motel, A Silent Film, Death Cab for Cutie, The Temper Trap, Margot & the Nuclear So and So's, Black Francis, and Chain Gang of 1974.\n*Austin City Limits Music Festival (2014)\n*Bunbury Music Festival (2013)\n*Big Guava Music Festival (2015)\n*Bonnaroo Music Festival (2014)\n*BottleRock Napa Valley (2014)\n*Hangout Music Festival (2014)\n*Forecastle Festival (2015)\n*Lollapalooza (2012)\n*LouFest (2014)\n*South by Southwest (2014)\nReferences"
