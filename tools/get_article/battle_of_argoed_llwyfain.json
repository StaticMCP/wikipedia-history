Supposedly on one Saturday, Fflamddwyn had surrounded the seat of power within Rheged and demanded that King Urien submit and provide hostages. Urien's son Owain used the memory of his ancestor Ceneu son of Coel and denied giving hostages. Urien then stirred his men and fighting began. In the ensuing combat Fflamddwyn was slain, temporarily freeing Rheged from Anglian domination.\nSee also\n*Battle of Alclud Ford\n*Taliesin\n*Rheged\n*Bernicia\n*Owain mab Urien\n*Urien\n*Theodric of Bernicia\n*Ida of Bernicia\nReferences"
