The attack was supported by the partisan artillery and mortars.\nThe Kočevje mine, student hostel, school and some other important buildings in the city were captured by the partisans. The remnants of the German-Home Guard garrison retreated into the Gotschee Castle where it remained protected by its thick walls until two German relief columns under the command of Oskar von Niedermayer came from Ljubljana and broke the partisan encirclement, rescuing the besieged German garrison on 12&nbsp;December 1943.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Stefano di Giusto (2002) Panzer in the OZAK 1943-1945.
