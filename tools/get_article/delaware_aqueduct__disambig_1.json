It takes water from the Rondout, Cannonsville, Neversink, and Pepacton reservoirs on the west bank of the Hudson River through the Chelsea Pump Station near Beacon, New York, then into the West Branch, Kensico, and Hillview reservoirs on the east bank, ending at Hillview in Yonkers, New York.\nBuilt between 1939 and 1945, the Delaware Aqueduct carries about half of New York City's water supply of  per day. At  wide and  long, it is the world's longest tunnel.\nReservoirs and watersheds\n]]\nThe Delaware Aqueduct carries water from the ,  watershed using the Rondout, Cannonsville, Neversink and Pepacton reservoirs with the Delaware and Neversink tunnels. (The latter three reservoirs are within the Delaware River watershed. The water from the Rondout Reservoir is collected as part of the Delaware system, though the Rondout Creek is part of the Hudson River watershed.)\nCombined, the four reservoirs account for  of watershed and  of capacity,  of which goes to the city — half of daily demand. All this water is fed from the Rondout to West Branch Reservoir in Putnam County (part of the Croton River watershed, which includes the flow of the upstream Boyds Corner Reservoir), then to the Kensico, and Hillview reservoirs in southern Westchester County, before continuing on to distribution within New York City.\nLeak problems\nLeaks were first discovered in the Delaware Aqueduct in 1988, with water losses up to  per day. The city took many years to analyze the leak problem and devise a solution. In 2010 it announced a plan for a major repair project.\nRepairs\nThe NYCDEP is building a  Rondout-West Branch Bypass Tunnel beneath the Hudson River, which will allow it to bypass the leak. Construction began in November 2013. \"The number's going to be $1.5 billion to do the entire program to make the fix,\" said Paul Rush, Deputy Commissioner of the NYCDEP. \"About two-thirds of it, $1 billion, will actually go into constructing a bypass tunnel around the location with the most significant leakage in Roseton, and to do additional concrete grouting in the Wawarsing section.\"\nThe new bypass tunnel is the largest construction project in NYCDEP's history. Construction of the tunnel,  under the Hudson, was completed in 2019. The project involved digging two shafts measuring  deep. To complete the repairs, the aqueduct was supposed to shut down temporarily in 2022, but this was postponed. The northern section of the tunnel was shut down in September 2024. The repair project was paused in November 2024 due to drought conditions. As of mid-2025, NYCDEP estimates that the final stage of the repair project will be complete in 2027.\nSee also\n* Catskill Aqueduct\n* Croton Aqueduct\n* Delaware River Basin Commission\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=79oDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA214 \"Giant Tube To Supply Water For Ten Millions\"], Popular Mechanics, August 1937—detailed article with drawings and maps on proposed Delaware Aqueduct"
