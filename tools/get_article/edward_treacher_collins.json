He is best known for describing the Treacher Collins syndrome.\n]]\nBiography\nHe was the son of Dr. William Job Collins and Miss Treacher. Treacher Collins used his mother's maiden name and his father's surname without a hyphen, according to the custom of the time.\nHe entered University College London. In 1879 he began studies at Middlesex Hospital; he received his medical degree in 1883. Influenced by his older brother Sir William Collins, he decided to specialize in ophthalmology. For his internship, he went to the Moorfields Eye Hospital, where he remained as a faculty member for the next 48 years. His work culminated in the publication Researches into the Anatomy and Pathology of the Eye (1896), which earned him worldwide recognition.\nHe died on 13 December 1932 and is buried in a family grave on the west side of Highgate Cemetery.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1393.html Edward Treacher Collins at whonamedit.com]"
