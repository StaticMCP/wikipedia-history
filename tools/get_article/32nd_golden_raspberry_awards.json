Razzies co-founder John J. B. Wilson has stated that the intent of the awards is \"to be funny.\" The nominations were announced on February 25, 2012. Taking a break from Razzie tradition of announcing both the nominees and winners before the Academy Awards functions by one day, it was decided in January 2012 to delay both the Razzie nomination announcements and ceremony by several weeks in order for the actual Razzie ceremony to be held on April Fools' Day. The actual nominations however, still had some connection to the Oscars ceremony, as they were announced the night before the Academy Awards were held.\nAdam Sandler received a Razzie record six nominations as an individual and a total of twenty-three nominations for films he was involved with.\nVoting for Worst Screen Ensemble was not just determined by members of the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation. Voting for the award was opened up to the general public online and conducted by the website Rotten Tomatoes. A grand total of 35,117 votes were cast.\nJack and Jill was nominated for twelve awards (including twice each in Worst Supporting Actor and Worst Supporting Actress) and won in every category. This was the first time in the history of the Razzies that one film won every award. The film also holds the record for most Razzie wins (beating Battlefield Earth) and most wins in a single year (beating I Know Who Killed Me). The only other film to win was another Happy Madison film Just Go with It, with only two Razzies earned for Worst Director and Worst Actor.\nWinners and nominees\n, Worst Actor and Worst Actress winner; Worst Screen Couple and Worst Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actor winner and Worst Screen Couple co-winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Worst Screen Couple co-winner]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
