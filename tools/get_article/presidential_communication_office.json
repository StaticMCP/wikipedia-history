The office later returned to Joko Widodo.\nOn 15 August 2024, Joko Widodo signed the Presidential Decree No. 82/2024, forming the formalized agency to organize state spokespersons. This agency actually was result of Prabowo's deal with Joko Widodo administration, making this agency was one of two Prabowo's incoming administration that activated earlier before his administration started.\nOn 19 August 2024, Hasan Nasbi appointed as Chief of the Presidential Communication Office. He was Prabowo-Gibran campaign spokesperson. He expected that in the future, when the office fully functional during Prabowo's tenure, the office will employ 5 to 6 presidential spokespersons. As the seed of the office, Deputy IV (Information and Political Communication) of the Executive Office of the President of the Republic of Indonesia (KSP) was taken out from the KSP.\nThe agency disbanded on 17 September 2025 in favor of the Government Communications Agency. This is due to the need of better political communication between the central government to the regional governments.\nStructure\nBased on Presidential Decree No. 82/2024, the office consisted of:\n* Office of the Chief of the Presidential Communication Office\n* Deputy for Communication and Information Material\n* Deputy for Dissemination and Information Media\n* Deputy for Information Coordination and Communication Evaluation\n* Presidential Spokespersons\nReferences"
