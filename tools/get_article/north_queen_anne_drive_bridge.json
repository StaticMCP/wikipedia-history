The  long steel and concrete structure was built in 1936 to replace the previous wood-constructed crossing. It serves as a connection between the Queen Anne neighborhood and the George Washington Memorial Bridge that carries State Route 99. The arch is unusually high and uses a minimal number of supporting members. It was designated a city landmark on December 28, 1981, because of its unique engineering style.\nAn expansion joint suffered cracking and spalling during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.  The bridge has been retrofitted to make it more earthquake-resistant.\nReferences"
