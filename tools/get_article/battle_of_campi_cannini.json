Taking advantage of the confusion after the defeat of Emperor Avitus at Placentia on 16 October 456, an Alemannic army crossed the Rhaetian Alps through Switzerland into Italy, reaching Lake Maggiore. At nearby Campi Cannini, the Alemanni were defeated by the Roman officer Burco, in the name of the  Majorian.\nAftermath\nFrom there on, Majorian would be able to consolidate his control over Rome after deposing Avitus, establishing Ricimer as his right-hand man until his execution in 461.\nSources\n*"
