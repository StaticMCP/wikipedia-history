In the , Mount Lofty had a population of 3,825 people.\nGeography\nJubilee Park, a large parkland and bushland area with numerous riding trails, forms the eastern part of the suburb. At the end of North Street is the peak of Mount Lofty, which features a garden and rainforest, a lookout, and the transmission tower for WIN Television. Nearby is Toowoomba State High School (Mount Lofty Campus) and a rifle range used by Toowoomba Rifle Club, that is no longer in use.\nHistory\nMount Lofty was formerly known as Tick Hill.\nThere was a two-storey house called Longview on its crest, which was relocated from the Toowoomba CBD by Charles Cocks. The house was built for Cocks in the 1860s on the corner of Ruthven Street and Bridge Street. In 1904, Cocks had the house dismantled and rebuilt on the eastern end of North Street on a  site, where it overlooked Toowoomba. After Cocks's death in 1916, the house was occupied by his daughter Eleanor Sophia (Polly) Cocks who operated it as a boarding house (advertising it as having the health benefit of \"flu cured two days\"). After her death in 1956, the house was demolished. A reservoir occupies the site today at 13 North Street ().\nToowoomba State High School and Technical College opened on 12 May 1919, after the Department of Public Instruction took over the Toowoomba Technical College. In January 1962, it became Toowoomba State High School.\nOn Saturday 14 August 1926, the Reverend William Goyen officially opened a Presbyterian Sunday School hall in Geoffrey Street, as an outreach of St Stephen's Presbyterian Church in Neil Street in the Toowoomba CBD. By 1927, it was being used for church services on a monthly basis and was known as the Geoffrey Street Presbyterian Church. In 1939, the hall was moved to a block on the south-east corner of Mary Street and Alford Street. On 12 November 1949, the foundation stone for the current church was laid by the Right Reverend William Frederick Mackenzie, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Queensland. On Saturday 26 July 1952, the new church was officially opened as St David's Presbyterian Church by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Queensland, the Right Reverend Malcolm McDermant. The old church remains on the site and is used as a hall.\nDemographics\nIn the , Mount Lofty had a population of 3,775 people.\nIn the , Mount Lofty had a population of 3,825 people.\nHeritage listings\nMount Lofty has one heritage-listed site:\n* 6 Range Street (): Boyce Gardens\nEducation\nToowoomba State High School is a government secondary (7-12) school for boys and girls at Stuart Street ().
