It is currently under construction starting from March 2010, and will become the largest single medical building in Asia. The hospital is located in the Zhongguancun Life Science Park. The investment was made by Beijing International Hospital Group. Qide Han, the vice chairperson of the National People's Congress (NPC) of the People's Republic of China, Chief Office of Beijing University Health Science Center, will serve as the Honorary Chairman of the board.\nOverview\nThe hospital positions itself as a general hospital centering on several dominant disciplines, based on the subject specialties of Peking University. 36 medical centers and 49 medical disciplines are determined. As an affiliated hospital of Peking University, it is inherited from the strong disciplines of the university, as well as evolves many of its subjects. The disciplines to be focused on are: cardiovascular department, neoplasms/blood department, ophthalmology department, women and children's department, neuroscience department, urology department and renal disease department.\nScope of service\nClinical services:\n* Cardiovascular\n* Neoplasms/Blood\n* Ophthalmology\n* Women and children's care\n* Neuroscience\n* Urology\n* Renal disease\nHospital building design\nThrough a design competition, Peking University International Hospital sought a design for a satellite facility in the growing suburbs. Perkins Eastman proposed a , 12-story hospital for the  parcel of land located about  northwest of central Beijing.\nTo bring organization to a large site, the design team chose a circle inscribed inside a square as the overall design element. The landscaped square gives the site a defined border, and the circular ambulatory care and cancer center building harmoniously organize different large-scale program elements. The design reflects the three-part organization of the medical zone: patient care towers, outpatient ambulatory care wing, and medical technology space; and gives each portion a distinct and appropriate appearance. Patient bed towers are carefully sited to comply with requirements for direct exposure to the south to provide light and views.\nThe two-phase plan calls for 2,000 hospital beds, an ambulatory care center to serve 10,000 outpatients daily, and a large emergency department with adult and pediatric areas. Specialized services encompass centers for cardiovascular services, oncology, women’s and children’s services, and a conference center.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100925095516/http://www.pkucare.com/cn/ Official website mainly Chinese]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110715090918/http://www.pkucare.com/en/ Official website mainly English, only English frame, no content]"
