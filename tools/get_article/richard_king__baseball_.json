He played with the Cincinnati/Indianapolis Clowns in 1943, 1945, and 1948.\nKing was known more for performing pantomime comedy acts than his playing ability. He often worked alongside dwarf Spec Bebop, where the two performed a rowboat routine. King was also known for his oversized first baseman's mitt. He eventually transitioned away from playing altogether, but remained associated with the Clowns until his retirement in 1959.\nReferences\nExternal links\nand [https://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=king-01ric Seamheads]"
