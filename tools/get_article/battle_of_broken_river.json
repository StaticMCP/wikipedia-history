According to Judith Bassett, some 20 Indigenous Australians attacked and at least one Koori and eight Europeans died. This was long known locally as the Faithfull Massacre.\nThere are conflicting accounts of the reason for the attack: one account suggests that it was retribution for Faithfull’s men shooting at the Aboriginal men on the Ovens River a week prior while another suggests that it was “revenge for the illicit use of Aboriginal women by the same party several weeks before”. While the incident has been referred to as a \"massacre\", the historian Chris Clark argues that \"there is no reason to view this incident as anything other than a battle which the Aborigines won\".\nThe settlers may have been camping on a ground reserved for hunting or ceremonies.\nThe site of the incident was re-discovered in 1907.\nA son's account of the incident\nA 1906 newspaper account (\"particulars of which [were] obtained from a son of one of the number of the party\") is as follows:\nReprisal killings\nAround one hundred Aboriginal people were murdered in reprisal killings, which stretched on for many years.\nReprisals occurred at Wangaratta on the Ovens River, at Murchison (led by the native police under Henry Dana, with the young Edward Curr, who later said that he took issue with the official reports), Mitchelton and Toolamba. The colonial government decided to \"open up\" the lands south of Yass, New South Wales after the Faithfull Massacre and bring them under British rule, with one of the aims ostensibly to help protect the Aboriginal people from reprisal attacks.\nSee also\n*List of massacres of Indigenous Australians\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140306165135/http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/conflict/indigenous/display/30333-faithfull-massacre-site-memorial Faithful Massacre Site Memorial] (archived version)"
