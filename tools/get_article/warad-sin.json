There are indications that his father Kudur-Mabuk was co-regent or at very least the power behind the throne. His sister En-ane-du was high priestess of the moon god in Ur.\nAnnals survive for his complete 12-year reign.  He recorded that in his second year as king, he destroyed the walls of Kazallu, and defeated the army of Mutibal that had occupied Larsa.\nHe was succeeded as king of Larsa by his brother Rim-Sin I.\nGallery\nFile:Foundation figurine of Warad-Sin for Inanna at Zabalam.jpg|Foundation figurine of Warad-Sin for Inanna at Zabalam\nFile:Clay cylinder.
