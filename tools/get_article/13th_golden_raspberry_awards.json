Shining Through and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot each won three Razzies, though the latter wasn't nominated for Worst Picture. Tom Selleck did not attend the ceremony and later accepted his award on The Chevy Chase Show.\nAlan Menken, who wrote the music for the Razzie-winning song \"High Times, Hard Times\" from Newsies, also received the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"A Whole New World\" from Aladdin in 1993, making him the first person to receive a Razzie and Oscar in the same year, a feat not repeated until screenwriter Brian Helgeland in 1998.\nAwards and nominations\nFile:Seltzer, David (2007) crop.jpg|David Seltzer, Worst Director winner.\nFile:Sylvester Stallone 2012.jpg|Sylvester Stallone, Worst Actor winner.\nFile:Life Ball 2013 - magenta carpet Melanie Griffith 02.jpg|Melanie Griffith, Worst Actress winner.\nFile:Tom Selleck 2010.jpg|Tom Selleck, Worst Supporting Actor winner.\nFile:EstelleGetty2.jpg|Estelle Getty, Worst Supporting Actress winner.\nFile:Pauly Shore is Dead Red Carpet.jpg|Pauly Shore, Worst New Star winner.\nFile:Alan Menken 2013 (cropped).jpg|Alan Menken, Worst Original Song co-winner.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" align=\"centre\"\n|-\n!
