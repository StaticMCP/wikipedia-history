The country was a one-party state at the time, with the National Revolutionary Movement for Development (MRND) the sole legal party. Its leader, incumbent President Juvénal Habyarimana, who had taken power in the 1973 coup d'état, was the only candidate. The results showed 99.98% of votes in favour of his candidacy, up from 99.97% in the 1983 elections.  The elections were the last presidential contest in Rwanda until 2003.\nResults\nReferences"
