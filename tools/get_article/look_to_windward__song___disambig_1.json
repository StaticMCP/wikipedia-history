NME reviewer Rishi Shah said the song \"could be an entire album in itself\", setting the tone for the rest of the album \"with its unbearable, cinematic tension, which is then annihilated by a heaviness that chops through it like an executioner's axe\". Mackenzie Cummings-Grady of Billboard ranked the song as the second best from the album, describing it as \"a transmuting whirl of an opener. [...] It's a harrowing first impression that pushes back against any expectations one might have when entering Vessel's world\".\nPersonnel\nAdapted from Tidal:\n* Carl Brown - production, engineering, mixing\n* Jim Pinder - engineering\n* Adam \"Nolly\" Getgood - additional production\n* Sebastian Sendon - additional engineering, drum editing\n* Ste Kerry - mastering\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Chart (2025)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada (Canadian Hot 100)\n|84\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Global 200 (Billboard)\n|137\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n|38\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Rock & Metal (OCC)\n|4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n|66\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Hot Rock & Alternative Songs (Billboard)\n|4\n|}\nReferences"
