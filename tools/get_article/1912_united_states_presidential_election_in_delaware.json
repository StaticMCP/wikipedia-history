State voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nDelaware was won by Princeton University President and governor of New Jersey Woodrow Wilson (D–Virginia), running with governor of Indiana Thomas R. Marshall, with 46.48% of the popular vote, against the 27th president of the United States William Howard Taft (R–Ohio), running with Columbia University President Nicholas Murray Butler, with 32.85% of the popular vote and the 26th president of the United States Theodore Roosevelt (P–New York), running with governor of California Hiram Johnson, with 18.25% of the popular vote.\nDelaware was the only state where the Prohibition Party received fourth place with 1.28% of the popular vote which was ahead of the Socialist Eugene V. Debs who only received 1.14% of the vote. Woodrow Wilson became the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry Delaware since Grover Cleveland in 1892, and the last until Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.\nResults\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Delaware\nReferences"
