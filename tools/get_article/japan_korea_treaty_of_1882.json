The Japanese diplomats were forced to flee the country.  When order was restored, the Japanese government demanded damages and other concessions form the Korean government.\nThe negotiations were concluded in August 1882.\nArticle V of the \"convention\" permitted the Japanese to protect the Japanese legation and the Japanese community in Korea.\nIn 1884, the Japanese forgave the ¥400,000 indemnity which had been mandated by the treaty.\nSee also\n* Unequal treaties\nNotes\nReferences\n* Duus, Peter.
