The election followed the enactment of the Electoral Districts Act 1958, which increased the Assembly from 75 to 78 seats and modified the zonal system first established by Labor ahead of the 1950 election.\nThe major parties contesting the election were the Country Party led by Premier Frank Nicklin, the Liberal Party led by Kenneth Morris, the Labor Party led by Jack Duggan and the Queensland Labor Party led by Vince Gair. The Country and Liberal parties had formed a coalition.\nThe Country–Liberal coalition won a second term in office at the election, although the Labor Party recovered five seats and 11% of its vote from the 1957 election. Still, it was the first time since 1912 that a non-Labor government had been re-elected in Queensland.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n!
