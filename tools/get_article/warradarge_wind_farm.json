Construction commenced in 2019 and the first of its planned 51 turbines was completed on 21 January 2020. The wind farm has been operational since August 2020.\nIt is owned by Bright Energy Investments, a joint venture between the Dutch fund manager DIF Capital Partners (40.05%), Australian industry superannuation fund Cbus (40.05%), and the Western Australian government's electricity generator and retailer Synergy (19.9%). The construction and maintenance contracts are with Danish company Vestas.\nOriginally proposed in 2012 for up to 100 turbines generating 250 MW of electricity, the wind farm was completed in 2020 with 51 turbines, capable of generating up to 180 MW for the South West Interconnected System, the electricity grid in southern Western Australia, equivalent to providing power for 144,000 homes.\nThe wind turbines are manufactured by Vestas with 66 metre blades and a tip height of 152 metres above the ground. Western Power constructed a  transmission line from the wind farm to the existing 330 kV transmission network near Eneabba.\nIn 2023 funding was announced for a potential expansion of the wind farm.\nOperations\nOperations began in August 2020. The generation table uses [https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/wholesale-electricity-market-wem/data-wem/market-data-wa AEMO Facility SCADA] to obtain generation values for each month.  Warradarge's code is WARRADARGE_WF1. A SUMIF operation is used on the data published by AEMO to get the total (shown in the table below). Each month's values start 8 hours into the respective month and extend 8 hours into the next month, in line with the trading day defined in the Wholesale Energy Market Rules.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Warradarge Wind Farm Generation (MWh)\n!Year\n!Total\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n|-\n|2020\n|197,134\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|7,131\n|31,244\n|37,146\n|54,546\n|67,067\n|-\n|2021\n|604,089\n|63,260\n|68,094\n|55,782\n|23,891\n|45,563\n|44,096\n|51,823\n|45,202\n|45,636\n|46,432\n|48,168\n|66,141\n|}\nReferences"
