Gen. Nadeem Ahmed. However, after the IAF strike and Indian advancement in the region, the Pakistan Air Force and the Navy deployed and issued orders to their combat forces. Their missions were to conduct surveillance and air patrolling; no other combat units of PAF and Navy participated in the combat. The inter-services order of battle is mentioned in the table. According to the Pakistan news channels reports and military declassified information, the Kargil infiltration was comprehensively planned by the joint officers at the Joint staff Headquarters, a joint office secretariat which then-served under General Pervez Musharraf.\nFrom the start of the conflict, there were numerous inter-services meetings coordinated by the chairman joint chiefs, to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The controversy still surrounds in the military science circle of the Pakistan armed forces, with chief of naval staff and chief of air staff including key theatre commanders of army combatant corps, bringing up the accusations that the Kargil front was launched without their knowledge or confidence.\nPakistan Army\n* 5th Battalion, Northern Light Infantry Regiment\n* 6th Battalion, Northern Light Infantry Regiment\n* 12th Battalion, Northern Light Infantry Regiment\n* 13th Battalion, Northern Light Infantry Regiment\n* 24th Battalion, Sindh Regiment\n* 27th Battalion, Sindh Regiment\nPakistan Air Force\n* Note: No PAF F-16s took active participation in the conflict. All PAF missions were to conduct combat air patrols in the area.\n**No. 38 Multirole Group\n**No. 9 Squadron Griffins and No. 11 Squadron Arrows.\n****The F-16s belonging to Griffins Arrows were deployed in the region. No F-16s took active participation in the conflict.\nPakistan Navy\n*Note: No Navy units took active participation. The Navy was on high-alert but strictly ordered by Admiral Bokhari not to escalate the crises into sea. Although, Navy had its own significance in the Kargil theatre, but no crucial operations and efforts were applied or undertaken by Navy to support the army. According to the chief of naval staff, General Pervez Musharraf, as chairman joint chiefs, had failed to take navy into confidence prior to the start of the conflict.\n**Pakistan Navy Commander Karachi\n**Pakistan Naval Air Arm\n***The Pakistan Navy, in a defensive mood, directed all its units to keep clear of Indian naval ships. As the exercise shifted closer to the Makaran Coast, Pakistan moved all its major combatants out of Karachi. The Navy remained on high-alert, although orders were not to escalate the crises to sea. The Navy launched surveillance operations; Karachi port remained on high-alert.\nReferences\n27 Sind\nSources\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704044414/http://www.ordersofbattle.darkscape.net/site/history/index.html Indian Army – Kargil War 1999 v.2.0 8 March 2006] Mandeep S.
