The awards were hosted by actress/comedian Helga Braga Jónsdóttir and TV presenter Kristján Kristjánsson.\nFor the first time only one award was given for Best Actor and Actress as well as the Supporting Actor and Actress.\nAs in previous years the public was able to cast their votes online. The Icelandic Film and Television Academy had 70% say in the results and the public 30%. Except for the Best Television Personality where the public had 100% say in the results.\nThe film Kaldaljós, directed by Hilmar Oddson, was the winner of the evening taking five awards and receiving eight nominations. The Best Documentary category was interesting this year since two of the nominated films, Án Titils and Faux - í þessu máli, were about a high profile fraud case, where a great deal of paintings from Icelandic artists had been faked and sold. The goal was to make the court system change the laws on fraud of that kind since the laws were outdated and unclear.\nIngvar E. Sigurðsson and Ómar Ragnarsson both won their third Eddas on the night. Sigurðsson his third Best Actor award and Ragnarsson the award for Best Television Personality. He had previously won an award for Best News Anchor in 2001 and 2003.\nReturning categories\n* Edda Award for Best Television Program (staged)\nDiscontinued categories\n* Edda Award For Best News Anchor\nNew Categories\n* Edda Award for Best Entertainment in Television\nResults\nThe nominees and winners were: (Winners highlighted in bold)\nBest Film\n* Dís, directed by Silja Hauksdóttir\n* Kaldaljós, directed by Hilmar Oddsson\n* Næsland, directed by eftir Friðrik Þór Friðriksson\nBest Director\n* Erla B.
