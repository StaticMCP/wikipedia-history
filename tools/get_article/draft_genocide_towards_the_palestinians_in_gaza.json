UN), scolars, and Human Rights Organisations - Israel is committing a Genocide towards the palestinians.\nThere is agreement on, that this comes on-top of a several-decade long structured and well-planned & -organized ethnic-cleansing.\nThe only ones, that contradicts this, are zionists and top-politicians and other bribed officials.\n(plus corporate media, that are either paid-for, in the pockets of, or themselves zionists).\nThe genocide is shown to everybody, on a daily basis - through social-media - and zionist IDF-soldiers, have been showing & even bragging about, how they have destroyed civil property.\nOn top of that, a lot of scenes, have shown the barbarism - fx. stripping palestinian civilians of their clothes, and having them do different things.\nRape, Torture, etc - are also methods - besides the structural murdering of civilians.\nSome of the most grotesque & sadistic examples is the \"Daddy is home\" practice.\nIn this, the IDF is waiting for a dad to return home to his family, and then the bomb the house, and are killing as many of the family as possible.\nDocumentation includes the UN Reporteor on the palestinian occupied territories - Francesca Albaneze.\n- she has so-far (october-2025) released at least 3 reports regarding the above.\n- the last being the Companies' Role, profiting and Complicity in the ongoing Genocide.\nOne of the most interesting factores, is that Israel is allowed by the collective west, especially EU & USA, to carry out attacks, that are normally considered actions of a rogue state, and that normally are condemned, and leads to sanctions.\n- but, that has NOT been the case, so far, when israle does this.\n- fx. when Israel carried out the \"Pager-Attack\" in 2024 (that targeted & killed thousands of Lebaneze Civilians).\n- and when Israel attacked Iran (in a so-called \"Blitz-Krieg\").\nEverything is being denied and met with \"that people fx. are Anti-Semitic\".\n..\nAnd a sentence, has emerged, dur to this:\nThat \"every accusation, is a confession\".\nExamples of wild accusations (that have been debunked & rolled back):\n- 40 Beheaded Babies.  Turned out to be 1 child, caught in cross-fire.\n- Hamas Cutting out a unborn-baby from a pregnant woman's stomach.  Extremely dangerous claim.\nThe above, has been used by Israel (fx. I's prem.min. Netan.) repeatedly, to justify Israels blatant atrocities.\nSo far - we are 2 year in - or nearly 80 year in (if we count-in the Nakba, the ethnic-cleansing of appr. 750.000 Natives (Palestinians) in 1948.\n- 2 years into something, that the israeli zionists & their partners stubbornly claims is \"a War\".\n- something, that by definition IS a Genocide!\n- but, Israel has got the \"luxury\" of impunity, according to fx. Officials within the UN.\nComplicit Governments include:\n- UK (provides Military Surveillance) - documented by Declassified-UK.\n- Germany (provides Military Hardware & hardcore support) - documented by numerous human-rights organizations, journalists & activists.\n- USA (is Israels Partner in the Genocide) - provides all kinds of support (military equipment, including 2000 pounds bombs, that are used on civilian infrastructure, hospitals, etc. - and diplomatic cover).\nIn October 2025, yet another Fredom Flotilla (named \"Sumud\": meaning Steadfastness & Perseverence) is heading for Gaza - to provide Humanitarian Aid (because Israel & its allies are blocking aid).\n- here in october, the flotilla comprises appr. 50 boats/ships.\n- at earlier attempts, the flotilla have consisted of 1 boat/ship.\n- and, Israel have taken illegal measures every time - using piracy-methods (capturing the crews & ships in international water).\n- Israel have in 2010 killed 10 unarmed activists, on a boat.\nIt all adds-up - and all non-complicits in the world - including a majority of the populations in most world-countries - are not in doubt:\n- Israel is committing gross atrocities - including ethnic-cleansings, forced displacements, and now a Genocide.\n- and the UN have ruled several times - which israel and its allies, have overheard or smeared (including threatening and sanctioning UN-members, judges, etc).\nReferences\nhttps://www.un.org/unispal/document/genocide-as-colonial-erasure-report-francesca-albanese-01oct24/\nhttps://unipd-centrodirittiumani.it/en/news/united-nations-anatomy-of-a-genocide-report-of-the-special-rapporteur-on-the-situation-of-human-rights-in-the-palestinian-territories-occupied-since-1967-francesca-albanese-2024\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/1/un-report-lists-companies-complicit-in-israels-genocide-who-are-they"
