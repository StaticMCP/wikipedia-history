The Revolution started on June 5, 1895 and ultimately resulted in the overthrow of the conservative government, which had ruled Ecuador for several decades, by the Radical Liberals, led by Eloy Alfaro. After the revolution, the new government legalized divorce, allowed religious freedom, and weakened the authority of the Church, which lost the land it held.\nThe Revolution is often seen as marking the birth of modern Ecuador, with a new power structure that favored the Liberal Party, and new infrastructure projects such as the construction of a railway line between Quito and Guayaquil.\nCitations\nReferences\n*Handelsman, Michael.
