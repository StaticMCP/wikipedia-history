The album was recorded after Slick rejoined Jefferson Starship after temporarily leaving the band in the late 1970s. After working on this album with her, Slick's collaborator Peter Wolf would go on to contribute to Jefferson Starship's 1984 album Nuclear Furniture. A music video was made for the single \"All the Machines\".\nSoftware has been described as Slick's attempt to assimilate with the synth-pop sound of the period. Guitar use is largely replaced by synthesizers and electronic drums. Slick's trademark wailing vocals and improvising is replaced by more short, precise bursts.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Robert Christgau\n| rev2score = C−\n}}\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that Slick \"jumps on the synthesizer bandwagon, putting every ping, pip and pow electro-pop has to offer into another batch of inimitably banal songs.\" The Wall Street Journal determined that Slick \"really sings, with intelligence and control... The only problem is that the lyrics she's written for herself aren't up to Mr. Wolf's well-crafted music.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n*Grace Slick – lead vocals, background vocals\n*Peter Wolf – keyboards, Linn programming, synth bass\n*Peter Maunu – guitars on all tracks except \"Rearrange My Face\"\n*Brian MacLeod – Simmons drums\n*Bret Bloomfield – Fender bass on \"Me and Me\"\n*Michael Spiro – percussion on \"Me and Me\", \"Fox Face\", \"Rearrange My Face\" and \"Bikini Atoll\"\n*Dale Strumpel – sound effects on \"All the Machines\" and \"Bikini Atoll\"\n*Sean Hopper, Paul Kantner – background vocals on \"All the Machines\" and \"It Just Won't Stop\"\n*John Colla, Mickey Thomas – background vocals on \"Call It Right Call It Wrong\", \"Me and Me\", \"All the Machines\", \"Through the Window\", \"It Just Won't Stop\" and \"Rearrange My Face\"\n*Ron Nevison – background vocals on \"Me and Me\"\n*Ina Wolf – background vocals\nProduction\n*Ron Nevison – producer, engineer, arrangements\n*Rick Sanchez – assistant engineer\n*Dee Dee Miller – production assistant\n*Peter Wolf – arrangements\n*Michael Pangrazio – album cover illustrator\n*Paykos Phior – album cover design\n*Andrea Hein – album cover coordination, back cover concept\n*Grace Slick – front cover concept\nReferences"
