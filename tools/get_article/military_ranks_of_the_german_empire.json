It inherited the various traditions and military ranks of its constituent states.\nRanks of the Imperial German Army\nOfficer corps\nCritics long believed that the Army's officer corps was heavily dominated by Junker aristocrats, so that commoners were shunted into low-prestige branches, such as the heavy artillery or supply. However, by the 1890s, the top ranks were opened to highly talented commoners.\n; The rank insignia of commissioned officers.\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| Epaulette\n|\n|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=3|\n|colspan=3|\n|-\n| Shoulder board\n|\n|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=3|\n| colspan=3|\n|-\n|\n|\n| }}\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=3|\n| colspan=3|\n|}\nWarrant officers and officer cadets\n* Cadet (, ranking between Sergeant and Vizefeldwebel) – served as cadets in the various military academies and schools.

Other unit-specific enlisted ranks were: Fusilier ('), Grenadier ('), Huntsman otherwise Light-Infantryman ('), Dragoon ('), Hussar ('), Cuirassier ('), Uhlan ('), Fusilier Guard ('), Grenadier Guard (), Wehrmann (Landwehr), etc.\n* Lance Corporal ('); up until 1918 the only rank (with exception of ' in the foot artillery) to which a conscripted soldier could be promoted. The rank was a deputy rank to the Corporal (')\", in German.}} rank.\n* Senior Lance Corporal ('); established in the Prussian Army from 1846 to 1853, reestablished in 1859, then in foot artillery only, replacing the artillery Bombardier rank that had been introduced in 1730.\nAdditionally, the following voluntary enlistees were distinguished:\n* One-Year Volunteer Enlistee (): despite the name, one-year volunteers were actually conscripts who served a short-term form of active military service, open for enlistees up to the age of 25. Such enlisted soldiers were usually high school graduates (), who would opt to serve a one-year term rather than the regular two or three-year conscription term, with free selection of their chosen military service branch and unit, but throughout were obligated to equip and subsist themselves at entirely their own cost. In today's monetary value, this could at bare minimum cost some 10,000 euro, which purposely reserved this path open to sons from mostly affluent social class families wishing to pursue the Reserve-Officer path; it was the specific intention of Wilhelm II that such Reserve-Officer career path should only be open to members of so-called \"officer-material\" social classes. On absolving their primary recruit training, those aspiring to become Reserve-Officers would have to qualify and achieve suitability for promotion to the ' rank and then would continue to receive further specialized instruction until the end of their one-year term, usually attaining and leaving as surplus Corporals (') (Reservists), with the opportunity to advance further as reservists. Enlistees who did not aspire to officer grade would leave at the end of their one-year term as ' (Ordinary soldier) enlisted rank (for example ' or ) and a six-year reserve duty obligation. Eligibility for this specific one-year path of military service was a privilege approved upon examining the enlistee's suitability and academic qualifications.\n* Long-Term Volunteer Enlistee \"Capitulant\" (): enlisted soldiers who had already absolved their regular two or three-year military conscription term and had now volunteered to continue serving for further terms, minimum was 4 years, generally up to 12 years.\nNote: ' and ' were not ranks as such during this specific period of use, but voluntary military enlistee designations. They, however, wore a specific uniform distinction (twisted wool piping along their shoulder epaulette edging for ', the ' a narrow band across their lower shoulder epaulette) in the colours of their respective nation state. This distinction was never removed throughout their military service nor during any rank grade advancements.\nNaval ranks and ratings\nThe Imperial German Navy's rank and rating system combined that of Prussia's with the navies of other northern states.\nCommissioned officer ranks\nThe rank insignia of commissioned officers.\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| Epaulette\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2 rowspan=3|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=3|\n| colspan=3|\n|-\n| rowspan=2| Sleeve insignia\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=3|\n| colspan=3|\n|-\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=2|\n| colspan=3|\n| colspan=3|\n|}\nRank flags\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
