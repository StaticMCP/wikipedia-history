It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nEven though Greenland is only a autonomous territory of Denmark, thus not a independent country, AMPAS granted the territory autonomy to submit films for the category, following the same rules granted to Hong Kong.\nAs of 2025, Greenland has submitted three films, but none of them were nominated.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956.
