The national headquarters is Dumbarton House in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.\nHistory\nThe organization was founded in 1891, shortly after the founding of a similar society, the Colonial Dames of America (CDA), which was created to have a centrally organized structure under the control of the parent Society in New York City.\nThe NSCDA was intended as a federation of State Societies in which each unit had a degree of autonomy.  Another society formed around the same time was the Daughters of the American Revolution. Organized following the United States Centennial of 1876 and a Centennial of the US Constitution in New York in 1889, the NSCDA has worked in historic preservation, restoration and the interpretation of historic sites since its New York Society first undertook the preservation of the Van Cortlandt House in 1897.\nThe organization includes 43 corporate societies. Its headquarters is located at Dumbarton House,  in Washington, D.C. In addition to its activities in museum work, the Society sponsors scholarship programs and other historic preservation, patriotic service and educational projects.
