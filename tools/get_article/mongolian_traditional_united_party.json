For the 1996 Mongolian legislative election, the party nominated 16 candidates, but only Ochirbatyn Dashbalbar was elected to State Great Khural. As parliamentary party, it nominated former Chairperson of People's Great Khural Jambyn Gombojav in the 1997 Mongolian presidential election, but he won only 6.6% of the vote, coming in third place. After Dashbalbar's death in 1999, poet Ürjingiin Khurelbaatar became the party's chairperson. In 2006 he was replaced by general secretary Batdelgeriin Batbold.\nOur coalition\nIn March 2020, the party, alongside the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Civil Will–Green Party, formed Our Coalition to run in the 2020 Mongolian legislative election.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!Election\n!Party candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Result\n|-\n|1997\n|Jambyn Gombojav\n|65,201\n|6.64%\n|Lost\n|}\nState Great Khural elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Party leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n|-\n|1996\n|Ochirbatyn Dashbalbar\n|18,135\n|1.71%\n|}}\n|-\n|2000\n|Ürjingiin Khürelbaatar\n|6,725\n|0.65%\n|}}\n|-\n|2004\n|Ürjingiin Khürelbaatar\n|3,306\n|0.31%\n|}}\n|-\n|2008\n|Batdelgeriin Batbold\n|12,081\n|1.02%\n|}}\n|-\n|2012\n|Batdelgeriin Batbold\n|6,507\n|0.58%\n|}}\n|-\n|2016\n|Batdelgeriin Batbold\n|3,283\n|0.23%\n|}}\n|}\nReferences"
