In 1989, it became autonomous under presidential order.\nIn 2009, the Library received a $14,880 initiative from the Model United Nations of the University of Chicago and UNESCO to modernize facilities, train staff members and purchase new technology and materials. Although the library contains over seven thousand historical photographs of the political and cultural history of the country, only 25% have been scanned due to a lack of resources.\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
