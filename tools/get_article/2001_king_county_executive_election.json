Incumbent Democratic County Executive Ron Sims ran for re-election to a second term. Though several prominent Republicans, including County Councilman Rob McKenna, considered running against Sims, he faced relatively little-known challengers. He was challenged by Kirkland City Councilman Santos Contreras, civil engineer Alan Lobdell. In the blanket primary, Sims received 59 percent of the vote. Contreras defeated Lobdell to win the Republican nomination, 26–12 percent, and advanced to the general election, along with Libertarian businessman David Fries. Sims ultimately won a second term in a landslide, receiving 61 percent of the vote to Contreras's 35 percent.\nFollowing the invalidation of Washington's partisan blanket primary by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, this was the last election for King County Executive to take place with the blanket primary.\nPrimary election\nCandidates\n* Ron Sims, incumbent County Executive (Democratic)\n* Santos Contreras, Kirkland City Councilmember (Republican)\n* Alan Lobdell, civil engineer (Republican)\n* David Fries, businessman (Libertarian)\n}}\nGeneral election\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
