The 21st Cartoon Art Trust Awards were held on 12 October 2017 at the Mall Galleries in London.\nHistory\nThe Cartoon Art Trust was formed in 1988 by a group of cartoonists and collectors, including the cartoonist Mel Calman, whose aim was to found a museum dedicated to \"collecting, exhibiting, promoting and preserving the best of British cartoon art\". In February 2006 the Cartoon Museum opened to the public at its current home in central London, close to the British Museum.\nThe museum declares it is \"dedicated to preserving the best of British cartoons, caricatures, comics and animation, and to establishing a museum with a gallery, archives and innovative exhibitions to make the creativity of cartoon art past and present, accessible to all for the purposes of education, research and enjoyment.\"\nAnnual ceremony\nThe ceremony takes place annually in October in London. The 21st CAT Awards were held at the Mall Galleries in London on 12 October 2017. The awards are sponsored by a number of newspapers including The Daily Mail, Private Eye and The Daily Telegraph. Among the cartoonists whose work has been recognised is Matt Pritchett who has won Best Pocket Cartoonist three times.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Event\n!
