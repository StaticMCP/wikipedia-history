The winner is determined by a voice vote of the audience or the band who brings the most people to support them. Traditionally, battles of bands are held at live music events and forums. Popular examples include the yearly Live and Unsigned contest in the United Kingdom and the annual SoundWave Music Competition.\nFormat\nA battle of the bands is a contest in which many bands, usually rock or metal bands, but often musical acts from a range of different styles, compete for the title of \"best band\". Its history though goes back to earlier times, at least the 1930s swing era, when big band battles between famous band leaders like Chick Webb, the Casa Loma Orchestra, Benny Goodman, and Count Basie were regularly organised in big dancehalls, like the Savoy Ballroom. The winner is determined by a panel of judges, the general response of the audience, or a combination. The winning band usually receives a prize in addition to bragging rights. Prizes usually include cash, free recording time in a local recording studio, support or main slot at a local or large gig, a piece of new equipment, or a gift certificate. For instance, the band Phish won a battle of the bands competition in 1989 in their hometown of Burlington, Vermont, and won recording time at a local studio, which they used to record their second album Lawn Boy.\nBattles of bands are sometimes held as part of a live music event; they are also commonly held at high schools and universities. The term \"Battle of the Bands\" is a trademark in Canada, held since 1998 by the Toronto promotions company Supernova Interactive.\nHistorical events\nIn the United States one of the oldest rows of a battle of the bands talent show has been hosted by the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, the first time in 1959. The annual contest was meant to showcase teenage musicians and singers, the participants were either independent or associated with high schools and competed in several divisions like school band, vocal group, vocalist and combo. Auditions were being held early in the year, preliminary contests in spring and the finals in the Bowl in the summer. Two later famous musicians that have performed at the Hollywood Bowl Battle were Karen and Richard Carpenter in 1966 (winner in combo and sweepstake).\nOne of the best-known battle of the bands competitions in the United States was the Rock 'n' Roll Rumble, held by the Boston rock radio station WBCN. The competition was held by the station from 1979 until its closure in 2009, and was then subsequently operated by an independent group. Several winners and participants became nationally popular after appearing in the competition, including Mission of Burma (1979 participant), 'Til Tuesday (1983 winner), The Lemonheads (1988 participant), Letters to Cleo, Morphine, Powerman 5000 (all 1992 participants), The Amazing Royal Crowns (1997 winner) and The Dresden Dolls (2003 winner).\nThe simultaneous release of albums and singles in 1995 sparked a media-fuelled \"Battle of Britpop\" between northern England's working-class Oasis and southern England's middle-class Blur. Also in the United Kingdom, the largest annual music contest in a battle of the bands format is Live and Unsigned, which has been operating since 2007. The contest regularly draws 10,000 participants, with the grand prize of a £50,000 recording deal.\nIn popular culture\nA battle of the bands event forms the climax of a number of films, including Up in Smoke (1978), Cotton Candy (1978), Freaky Friday (2003), School of Rock (2003), Metal Lords  (2022), Bandslam (2009), ''Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991) and Blues Brothers 2000 (1998).
