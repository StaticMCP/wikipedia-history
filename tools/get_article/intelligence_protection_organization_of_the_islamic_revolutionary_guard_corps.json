In 1991, the agency was restructured as an independent organization reporting to the Supreme Leader of Iran, mainly tasked with IRGC personnel surveillance and combating espionage inside the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nThe Intelligence Protection Organization has three subsidiary units: the Supreme Leader’s Protection Corps (Sazman-e Sepah-e Vali-e Amr); the Ansar-al-Mahdi Protection Unit; and the Aviation Protection Organization (or Airlines' Protection Unit) (Sepah-e Hefazat-e Havapeimaei).\nChairmen\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!  !!
