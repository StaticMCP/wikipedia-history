She did not remain in service long.\nService history\nFew facts exist concerning Susan Ann Howard, a center-board schooner purchased by the Union Navy from the New York City Prize Court on 19 May 1863. Usually referred to as Susan A. Howard, the ship was listed on 5 June 1864 as one of a group of schooners serving on the sounds of North Carolina, presumably at New Bern, North Carolina, as ordnance and store vessels. On 7 July, she was at New Bern serving as an ordnance boat. On 7 September, she was listed as a hulk and serving as a coal schooner. On 30 August, the schooner was ordered to Washington, D.C.; and Susan Ann Howard was sold at the Washington Navy Yard on 15 September to H. F. Hammil.\nSee also\n* Blockade runners of the American Civil War\n* Blockade mail of the Confederacy\nReferences"
