A log cabin was built onsite during this time which survived until 2001. In 1703, Richard Warfield granted 150 acres of Warfield's Range including the cabin to his daughter Rachel Warfield Yates. In 1765, 240 acres of the range were inherited by Benjamin Warfield's son Joshua Warfield. In 1845 Thomas Chew Worthington updated the log cabin interior with random width wood floors.\nAfter Peter Gorman completed his railroad contract, he purchased the 500-acre estate Fairview in North Laurel from Dr. Charles Griffith Worthington. The property was part of Warfiled's Range, containing the 1696 log cabin that survived until an arson fire in 2001 when relocated to accommodate the Warfield's Range development.\nSee also\n* List of Howard County properties in the Maryland Historical Trust\n* Christ Church Guilford\n* John T.
