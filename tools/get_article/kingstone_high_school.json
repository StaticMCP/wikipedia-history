It continues to co-ordinate with Herefordshire Council for admissions and mainly serves the areas of South Hereford and the Golden Valley.\nKingstone High School offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils. The main school building was built in the 1960s, with other buildings added later.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
