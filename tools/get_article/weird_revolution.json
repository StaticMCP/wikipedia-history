It is in large part a rerecorded version of an earlier album, tentatively entitled After the Astronaut, that was abandoned in 1998.\nThe initial release of this album featured a lenticular cover and jewel case that shows the baby's limbs moving and shooting a beam at other aircraft on the cover. The song \"They Came In\" was featured on the soundtrack to Mission: Impossible 2. The song \"The Shame of Life\" was featured in the trailer for Phone Booth. The song \"Dracula From Houston\" was featured in an episode of the NBC comedy series Scrubs and was featured in the surfing documentary Step into Liquid, a film by Dana Brown.\nAs of 2025, Weird Revolution remains the band's last album to date.\nReception\n|rev1 = AllMusic\n|rev1score =\n| rev2 = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev2Score = C+\n|rev4 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n|rev4score =\n|rev3 = Pitchfork Media\n|rev3score = 0.4/10\n| rev5 = Spin\n| rev5Score = 6/10\n}}\nThe album was met with mixed-to-negative reviews. Pitchfork Media was particularly negative about it, saying \"The thin music seems to emanate from a TV you can't turn off. Each song putters on a weak beat that jangles and blips as if they dumped the ambient sounds of a Midway arcade over some Black Grape outtakes.\"\nTrack listing\n}}\nNotes\nSingles\n\"The Shame of Life\"\n# \"The Shame of Life\"\n# \"The Shame of Life\" (A Cappella)\n# \"The Shame of Life\" (DJ Z-Trip Remix)\n# \"The Shame of Life\" (Bonus Beats)\n\"Dracula from Houston\"\n# \"Dracula from Houston (The Bike Song) (Radio Edit)\"\n# \"They Came In\"\n# \"Call Out Hook\"\nPersonnel\nButthole Surfers\n*Gibby Haynes – vocals\n*Paul Leary – guitars\n*King Coffey – drums\nAdditional personnel\n*Paul Leary – production, mixing (Track 11)\n*Rob Cavallo – production (Tracks 2, 3, 5, 7, 8), A&R\n*Michael Bradford – engineering (Tracks 1, 2, & 7), additional production (Track 2)\n*Stuart Sullivan – engineering (Tracks 1, 4–7, & 9–12), mixing (Track 11)\n*Allen Sides – engineering (Tracks 2, 3, & 8)\n*Chris Lord-Alge – mixing (Tracks 1–10 & 12)\n*Brian Gardner – mastering\n*Nathan Calhoun – bass\n*Chris Vrenna – additional drum programming (Track 9)\n*Cheryl Jenets – A&R coordination\n*Dave Kaplan – management\n*Actionfigure – art direction, design\nReferences"
