(\"Here it's right!\")]]\nUnder the German Empire (from 1871 to 1918) and Weimar Germany (from 1918 to 1933), transgender people enjoyed freedoms and rights unprecedented in Europe at the time. Berlin in particular was known as a hotspot for LGBTQ life, and saw a flourishing of transgender culture while leaps were also made in transgender medicine through the Institute for Sexual Science, located in the city. While laws such as Paragraph 183 existed which were sometimes inconsistently used to prosecute transgender individuals, thanks to the advocacy of Magnus Hirschfeld, in 1908, Germany instituted the ability for transgender people to obtain transvestite passes, which shielded them from legal consequences for being publicly transgender.\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, Germany's LGBTQ movement began to experience pushback from socially conservative movements. Hirschfeld was beaten and later exiled, and with the rise of Adolf Hitler in 1933, the Weimar period came to an end. Transgender people under Nazi rule would be heavily persecuted, and eventually many were killed in the Holocaust.\nOverview\nIn the Weimar Republic, the government which ruled Germany from the end of World War I in 1918 until Adolf Hitler seized power in 1933, transgender people gained rights and freedoms unprecedented in Europe at the time, and much early progress was made in transgender medicine. The key figure in these advancements was Jewish-German physician and sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, who founded both the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee in 1897—the main organization devoted to the decriminalization of homosexuality—and the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sexual Science) in 1919. Other notable transgender rights activists of the period include Friedrich Radszuweit, a publisher and author who founded the Bund für Menschenrecht (Federation for Human Rights) to advocate for gay and transgender rights in 1920, and Max Spohr, a publisher among the first to print LGBT media.\nPolitical status\nSocial life\nissued to Gerd Katter by the Berlin Police in 1928]]\nUnder the German Empire before World War I, there was no law which explicitly outlawed being transgender, unlike how Paragraph 175 explicitly outlawed male-male homosexuality. Paragraph 183 outlawed public crossdressing, which along with Paragraph 360 (a public nuisance law) was sometimes used against transgender people; however, these laws could only be applied if a public nuisance was determined to have occurred. Additionally, in practice these laws could not be applied to transgender people who were able to pass as their preferred gender. These qualities often led to uneven enforcement of the laws, and openly transgender or gender-queer people in Germany lived under constant threat of legal charges at the whim of individual police officers. In 1908, Hirschfeld discussed the matter with the Berlin Police, and convinced them to allow transgender people to obtain transvestite passes to avoid legal consequences for cross-dressing, one of the earliest known examples of legal recognition for transgender people.\nIn large part due to the less restrictive laws and LGBT-friendly culture of 1920s Berlin, known as the 'Golden Years', transgender culture began to flourish in the city, and Berlin became known as the queer capital of the world. In 1930, the world's first transgender magazine, Das 3. Geschlecht (The Third Gender), was published by Friedrich Radszuweit's publishing company in Berlin, as was Die Freundin (The Girlfriend), a lesbian magazine which would often publish articles for transgender women. In response to the advocacy of Hirschfeld and others of the first homosexual movement, the Weimar Republic even went so far as to permit legal name changes for transgender people.\nBerlin was also notable in this period for its queer nightlife and transvestite cabaret clubs, the most recognized of which were the Eldorado clubs, but less famous venues such as the Mikado were also popular places to watch transgender performers. Eldorado was the name of at least five known clubs in Berlin which featured transgender performers, and were a popular gathering spot for Berlin's LGBT community, though heterosexual patrons were also welcome and common. The first of these clubs was opened in March 1924 by Ludwig Konjetschni, who went on to own three locations under the Eldorado name, at least two of which are known to have catered to gay audiences specifically. The Eldorado clubs were noted worldwide and drew international tourism to the city. Though the clubs were heavily concentrated in Berlin, other similar clubs featuring transgender performers are known to have existed in most major German cities during this period, including Hannover,,Cologne, and Hamburg.\nMedical advancement\n, Magnus Hirschfeld, and Li Shiu Tong in Berlin (early 1930s)]]\nIn addition to more widespread cultural acceptance, Berlin also became a hotbed for research into transgender medicine. The Institute for Sexual Science, located in Berlin, performed some of the first academic studies of transgender medicine, and is credited with performing some of the first gender affirming care, including hormone replacement therapy. Ludwig Levy-Lenz, Erwin Gohrbandt and other surgeons associated with the Institute performed  gender affirming surgery, including early versions of facial feminization surgery and  sex reassignment surgery on trans women, as well as facial masculinization surgery, chest masculinization surgery, and hysterectomy and oophorectomy on trans men. Dora Richter, the first transgender woman known to have received sex reassignment surgery, received it through the Institute, as did Lili Elbe, Toni Ebel, Gerd Katter and many other notable transgender people of this period. Levy-Lenz is quoted as saying of his time at the Institute, \"Never have I operated upon more grateful patients.\"\nThe Institute collected extensive data on the transgender condition through interviews, surveys and clinical studies, and its research was some of the first to differentiate gender identity from sexual orientation. In his research for the Institute, Hirschfeld referred to transgender people as \"total transvestites\" or \"extreme transvestites\" as early as the 1920s, notably differentiating them from crossdressers, as well as stating his belief that there naturally existed people who had \"characteristics that did not fit into heterosexual or binary categories\". The Institute was also one of the only employers who would hire openly transgender people, and would often hire transgender people in need of work as receptionists or maids; both Toni Ebel and Dora Richter found employment with the Institute in this way.\nEarly pushback\nThe homosexual movement and Institute for Sexual Science were frequent targets of conservatives such as the Nazi Party and both Catholic and Protestant churches, which accused the movements of \"degeneracy\", going against family values and promoting \"un-German\" ideas. A particular target of conservative ire were LGBT publications and magazines, which were grouped with pornographic magazines as \"filth literature\". Laws such as the 1926 Harmful Publications Act were pushed through by conservative movements to attempt to limit or regulate the contents of these publications.\nRise of Nazism\nLegacy\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\nBooks\n*\n*\nArticles\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nPress\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*  }}"
