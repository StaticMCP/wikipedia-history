Saga was a scholar of the Chinese classics. He was also renowned as a skillful calligrapher. Chinese calligraphic influence was weakened during the [[Heian period; this text was an example of the different way it was evolving in Japan.]]\nwas the 52nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Saga's reign lasted from 809 to 823.\nTraditional narrative\nSaga was the second son of Emperor Kanmu and Fujiwara no Otomuro. His personal name was . Saga was an \"accomplished calligrapher\" able to compose in Chinese who held the first imperial poetry competitions (). According to legend, he was the first Japanese emperor to drink tea.\nSaga is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Ukyō-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Saga's mausoleum.\nEvents of Saga's life\n* 806 Saga became the crown prince at age 21.\n* June 17, 809 (): In the 4th year of Emperor Heizei's reign, he fell ill and abdicated; and the succession (senso) was received by Kanmu's second son Saga, the eldest son having become a Buddhist priest.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Saga is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).\nSoon after his enthronement, Saga himself took ill. At the time the retired Heizei had quarreled with his brother over the ideal location of the court, the latter preferring the Heian capital, while the former was convinced that a shift back to the Nara plain was necessary, and Heizei, exploiting Saga's weakened health, seized the opportunity to foment a rebellion, known historically as the Kusuko Incident; however, forces loyal to Emperor Saga, led by taishōgun Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, quickly defeated the Heizei rebels which thus limited the adverse consequences which would have followed any broader conflict.  This same Tamuramaro is remembered in Aomori's annual Nebuta Matsuri which feature a number of gigantic, specially-constructed, illuminated paper floats.  These great lantern-structures are colorfully painted with mythical figures; and teams of men carry them through the streets as crowds shout encouragement.  This early ninth century military leader is commemorated in this way because he is said to have ordered huge illuminated lanterns to be placed at the top of hills; and when the curious Emishi approached these bright lights to investigate, they were captured and subdued by Tamuramaro's men.\n* August 24, 842 (): Saga died at the age of 57.\nEras of Saga's reign\nThe years of Saga's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (nengō).\n* Daidō             (806–810)\n* Kōnin (810–824)\nLegacy\nIn ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the Gempeitōkitsu (源平藤橘).  One of these clans, the Minamoto clan are also known as Genji (源氏), and of these, the Saga Genji (嵯峨源氏) are descended from 52nd emperor Saga.  Saga's son, Minamoto no Tōru, is thought to be an inspiration for the protagonist of the novel The Tale of Genji.\nEmperor Saga played an important role as a stalwart supporter of the Buddhist monk Kūkai.  The emperor helped Kūkai to establish the Shingon School of Buddhism by granting him Tō-ji Temple in the capital Heian-kyō (present-day Kyoto).\nDaikaku-ji\nis a Shingon Buddhist temple in Ukyō-ku in Kyoto. The site was originally a residence of the emperor, and later various emperor conducted their cloistered rule from here. The artificial lake of the temple, Ōsawa Pond, is one of the oldest Japanese garden ponds to survive from the Heian period.\nThe Saga Go-ryū school of ikebana has its headquarters in the temple and is named in his honour.\nKugyō\nis a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Saga's reign (809–823), this kugyō included:\n* Sadaijin\n* Udaijin, Fujiwara no Uchimaro (藤原内麿), 806–812.\n* Udaijin, Fujiwara no Sonohito (藤原園人), 812–818.\n* Udaijin, Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu (藤原冬嗣), 821–825.\n* Udaijin, Tachibana no Ujikimi.\n* Naidaijin\n* Dainagon\nConsorts and children\nSaga had 49 children with at least 30 different women. Many of the children received the surname Minamoto, thereby removing them from royal succession.\n*Empress: Tachibana no Kachiko (橘嘉智子), also known as , Tachibana no Kiyotomo's daughter.\n**Second Son: Imperial Prince Masara (正良親王) later Emperor Ninmyō\n**Imperial Princess Seishi (正子内親王; 810–879), married to Emperor Junna\n**Imperial Princess Hideko (秀子内親王; d. 850)\n**Imperial Prince Hidera (秀良親王; 817–895)\n**Imperial Princess Toshiko (俊子内親王; d. 826)\n**Fifth Daughter: Imperial Princess Yoshiko (芳子内親王; d. 836)\n**Imperial Princess Shigeko (繁子内親王; d. 865)\n*Hi (deposed): Imperial Princess Takatsu (高津内親王; d. 841), Emperor Kanmu’s daughter\n**Second Prince: Imperial Prince Nariyoshi (業良親王; d. 868)\n**Imperial Princess Nariko (業子内親王; d. 815)\n*Hi: Tajihi no Takako (多治比高子; 787–825), Tajihi no Ujimori's daughter\n*Bunin: Fujiwara no Onatsu (藤原緒夏; d. 855), Fujiwara no Uchimaro's daughter\n*Court lady (Naishi-no-kami): Kudara no Kyomyō (百済王慶命; d. 849), Kudara no Kyōshun's daughter\n**Minamoto no Yoshihime (源善姫; b. 814)\n**Minamoto no Sadamu (源定; 815–863)\n**Minamoto no Wakahime (源若姫)\n**Minamoto no Shizumu (源鎮; 824–881)\n*Nyōgo: Kudara no Kimyō (百済貴命; d. 851), Kudara no Shuntetsu's daughter\n**Imperial Prince Motora (基良親王; d. 831)\n**Fourth Son: Imperial Prince Tadara (忠良親王; 819–876)\n**Imperial Princess Motoko (基子内親王; d. 831)\n*Nyōgo: Ōhara no Kiyoko (大原浄子; d. 841), Ōhara no Ietsugu's daughter\n**Tenth Daughter: Imperial Princess Ninshi (仁子内親王; d. 889), 15th Saiō in Ise Shrine 809–823\n*Koui: Iidaka no Yakatoji (飯高宅刀自), Iidaka Gakuashi\n**Minamoto no Tokiwa (源常; 812–854)\n**Minamoto no Akira (源明; 814–852/853)\n*Koui: Akishino no Koko (秋篠高子/康子), Akishino no Yasuhito's daughter\n**Minamoto no Kiyoshi (源清)\n*Koui: Yamada no Chikako (山田近子)\n**Minamoto no Hiraku(?)
