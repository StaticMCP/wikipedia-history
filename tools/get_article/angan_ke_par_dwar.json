The book received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1964.\nContent\nThe poems of the book were written during the period 1959 to 1961.\nThe poems of the book is divided into three parts; Antah Salila, Chakrant Shila and Asadhya Vina (The Unmastered Lute). Antah Salila contains 18 poems. Chakrant Shila has 27 poems, majorly written with neo-mystical theme. The last part, Asadhya Vina, contains a long poem by the same title.\nAgyeya heavily used Tadbhava words (words adopted from Sanskrit), avoiding Tatsama words (words borrowed from Sanskrit with modified phonology). Angan Ke Par Dwar played decisive role in bringing to the light the creative possibilities of the Tadbhava vocabulary.\nReception\nAngan Ke Par Dwar received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1964. It was translated into Gujarati by Bholabhai Patel as Anganani Par Dwar (2002). The critic Nand Kishore Acharya calls Asadhya Vina a 'culmination' of Agyeya's poetics and philosophy of life.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
