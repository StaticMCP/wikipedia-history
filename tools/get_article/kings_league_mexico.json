It is based on Spain's Kings League, launched by Gerard Piqué in late 2022.\nBackground\nAfter the Kings League began play in early 2023, league CEO Oriol Querol stated that they had a goal to bring the format to multiple countries, with talks for a version in Brazil and another one across Hispanic America ongoing at the time. The Hispanic American league was formally announced on 14 July 2023, with a statement saying that it would begin play in 2024 in Mexico City. Two weeks later, during the Kings and Queens Finals event held at the Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, Mexican footballer Javier Hernández was the first team chairman to be announced.\nA launch event for the league was held on 24 October 2023, with the reveal of all the competing teams and chairpersons, where it was also announced that former Mexico national team player Miguel Layún would be serving as chairman of the league, with Marc Crosas appointed as the league's sporting director.\nThe league includes a team styled after the eponymous football club from the Mexican comedy-drama Netflix series Club de Cuervos. Luis Gerardo Méndez and Mariana Treviño reprised their roles from the show as Chava and Isabel Iglesias respectively for a club announcement trailer featuring Piqué that was aired during the league's launch.\nTeam organisation\nThe initial teams and their chairpersons were announced during the league's launch event on 24 October 2023. The only change so far is Kunisports (renamed to KRÜ FC) and Aniquiladores FC entering from Kings League Spain, replacing Muchachos FC and Real Titán after the 2024-25 season.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n!
