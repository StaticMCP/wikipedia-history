On October 11th, 2024, the commander of the 405th battalion (a lieutenant-colonel), as well as a captain, a lance corporal, and a private got drunk in Mepali village and severely beat 8 villagers without reason and left them at the village hospital. One of the villagers died of his injuries the day after. The lieutenant-colonel also threatened to rape two women.\nBattle\nBeginning on the first week of January, the coalition of resistance forces would encircle the Mepali Strategic Camp and attack it with mortar fire and probing infantry actions. SAC forces stationed in Kyaikto Township fired heavy artillery and launched air strikes against the rebel positions. Still, these proved ineffective to dislodge the rebel forces. However, the usage of heavy weapons did cause the displacement of 3,000 civilians from Mepali and Ahsuchaung village tracts. On February 1 at 11 AM, the various groups of the coalition began their assault into the base. The perimeter fence of the camp was breached and the rebels quickly ran into the camp's trenches to engage in close-quarters fighting with the junta soldiers. Once the rebels took control of the camp and all its trenches, they continued firing into the treeline around the camp until the remnants of the force stationed there surrendered and were taken into custody by the resistance factions. 40 Myanmar Army soldiers were killed during the fighting. About 29 prisoners of war were taken immediately after the battle.\nAftermath and importance\nAfter the rebel forces took control of the Mepali Strategic Camp, they seized a 122mm howitzer, various mortars, rifles, and ammunition. Among the captured POWs were various officers of different ranks. Some soldiers and officers stationed at the Mepali Camp were able to escape during the fighting, including a battalion commander. On February 9th, an officer from the People's Defense Force Southern Military Command stated that 25 soldiers who fled the fighting had been arrested, raising the total amount of POWs to 52.\nThe victory coincided with the anniversary of the 2021 coup d'état in Myanmar.\nReferences"
