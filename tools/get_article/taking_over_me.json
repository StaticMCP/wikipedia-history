The single was released in the United Kingdom on 5 August 2012, as the second single from their debut studio album, Chapman Square, and reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, becoming their highest charting single to date along with \"Juliet\".\nMusic video\nA music video to accompany the release of \"Taking Over Me\" premiered on YouTube on 6 July 2012, at a total length of three minutes and ten seconds. Directed by Josh Forbes, the video features the four boys performing in a desert town, visiting places such as restaurants and clubs. The video paired each of the boys with a different on-screen girlfriend – Andy's on-screen girlfriend was played by Chelsea Turnbo, Ryan's by Melissa Jones, Joel's by Kat McCleary and Adam's by Lexi Johnston.\nCritical reception\nLewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating:\n\"I can stop the world, with only just your kiss,\" frontman Andy Brown gushes on Lawson's latest single. It's a far cry from his heart-shattering ode to a past love on debut smash 'When She Was Mine', though given the song's chart success, the band certainly have a lot to be happy about at the moment. But while the four-piece return with a more positive outlook, their ear for a guitar-pop stadium filler remains second to none. \"You're taking over me/ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh/ I'm in ecstasy,\" they croon on a chorus befitting such elation; and with another stellar track under their worn, brown leather belts, we suspect they won't be coming down any time soon. .\nTrack listing\n* Digital download - EP\n# \"Taking Over Me\" - 3:10\n# \"Still Hurts\" - 3:40 (Written By: Andy Brown, Carl Falk, Chris Braide)\n# \"Let Go\" - 3:41 (Written By: Andy Brown)\n# \"Taking Over Me\" [Acoustic] - 3:16\n* Digital download - Remixes\n# \"Taking Over Me\" [The Wideboys Radio Edit] - 3:32\n# \"Taking Over Me\" [The Wideboys Club Mix] - 6:34\n# \"Taking Over Me\" [The Alias Radio Edit] - 3:49\n# \"Taking Over Me\" [The Alias Club Mix] - 5:51\n* CD single\n# \"Taking Over Me\" - 3:10\n# \"Still Hurts\" - 3:40\n* 7\" vinyl\n# \"Taking Over Me\" - 3:10\n# \"Taking Over Me\" (Wideboys Remix Radio Edit) - 3:32\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (2012)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (2012)\n!Position\n|-\n|UK Singles (Official Charts Company)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|194\n|}\nRelease history\n{|class=wikitable\n!Region\n!Date\n!Format\n!Label\n|-\n| United Kingdom\n| 5 August 2012\n| Digital download, CD single\n| Polydor Records, Global Talent Records\n|-\n| Malaysia\n| 12 August 2012\n| Digital download\n| Universal, Geffen Records\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
