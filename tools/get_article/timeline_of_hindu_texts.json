The Vedas are classified under śruti.\nThe following list provides a somewhat common set of reconstructed dates for the terminus ante quem of Hindu texts, by title and genre. It is notable that Hinduism largely followed an oral tradition to pass on knowledge, for which there is no record of historical dates. All dates here given ought to be regarded as roughly approximate, subject to further revision, and generally as relying for their validity on highly inferential methods and standards of evidence.\nSamhita, Brahmana layers of the Vedas\n*Rigveda, 1500 – 1100 BCE\n*Samaveda, 1200 – 800 BCE\n*Yajurveda, 1100 – 800 BCE\n*Atharvaveda, 1000 – 800 BCE\nThe early Upanishads were composed over 900 – 300 BCE.\nOthers\n*Mahabharata, 4 BCE (Origins likely in the 8th or 9th century BCE)\n*Bhagavad Gita, 400 BCE\n*Ramayana, 400 BCE\n*Samkhya Sutra\n*Mimamsa Sutra, 300 – 200 BCE\n*Arthashastra, 400 BCE – 200 CETrautmann 1971:185 \"If the Kautilīya Arthaśāstra in its present form is not so old as it pretends, the śāstra itself is certainly old, predating the dharma smritis.\"Mabbett 1964 \"The content of the text is consistent with authorship in about the third century, C.E., and raises some questions which must be answered if it is to be assigned to the fourth B.C.E. Against this must be set the verses naming and characterising Kautilya, and the references in later literature. What emerges is that there is no necessary incompatibility between the essential claims that Chanakya was responsible for the doctrines of the Arthaśāstra, and that the text we know is a product of the later time. These do not conflict. The work could have been written late on the basis of earlier teachings and writings. Sanskrit literature being so full of derivative, traditional and stratified material, this possibility is a priori strong. Those who favour the early date usually admit the probability of interpolations....Those who favour a later date usually admit the probability that the work draws on traditional material. The controversy is therefore spurious. It is entirely possible that the  wrote an arthaśāstra and that a later editor rewrote his work, or compressed it, or compiled a text from the teachings of his school.\"\n*Nyāya Sūtras, 2nd century BCE\n*Vaiśeṣika Sūtra, 2nd century BCE\n*Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, 100 BCE – 500 BCE\n*Brahma Sutra, 500  BCE\n*Puranas, 250 – 1000 CE\n*Shiva Sutras, 120 BCE\n*Abhinavabharati, 950 – 1020 CE\n*Yoga Vasistha, 750 CE\nSee also\n*List of historic Indian texts\n*Sangam literature\n*Manusmriti\nReferences"
