The comomission was tasked to investigate unresolved cases of murders and enforced disappearances from 1 January 2012 to 17 November 2018. The commission investigated 27 cases such as the disappaearance and murder of Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla, murder of Yameen Rasheed, Afrasheem Ali, and Raudha Athif.\nInvestigations and reports\nIn total, the commission investigated 27 cases, with some international help from the FBI and the Western Australia Police Force. Some of the cases DDCom investigated have lacked investigation and have alleged corruption in the investigation, which made the general public and the families of the victims believe that the real perpretrators are free.\nDDCom later in November 2019 finished it's report on the murder of Afrasheem Ali and Raudha Athif, they forwarded the report to president Solih, the Maldives Police Service, and more. Later on, they released the Afrasheem's report to the public.\nAhmed Rilwan's murder report was finished in 2022 and confirmed Rilwan was killed and the suspects fled to Syria to join the Syrian civil war.\nAn achievement made by this commission was the implemenation of a witness protection program.\nDissolution\nAlthough DDCom was supposed to be dissolved in May 2024, it was extended at the request of the victim's families by president Mohamed Muizzu. DDCom was officially dissolved by Muizzu in June 2024.\nControversies\nDDCom has been under many controversies surrounding its lack of transparency and corruption within the investigations of cases.\nDDCom has claimed that the President's office ordered the commission to only share the findings with the office and not to the general public, which caused public backlash. Many civil society organizations such as the Maldives Journalists Association, Human Rights Watch, Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, International Federation of Journalists and more called on DDCom to publicly disclose the findings.\nMembers\nThese are the members of DDCom:\n* Husnu Al Suood - Chairperson\n* Ahmed Nashid\n* Adam Ibrahim\n* Fareesha Abdulla\n* Misbaah Abbas\nFormer members\n* Abdulla Munaz\nReferences"
