Its chancery is located on Merrion Road in the Ballsbridge area of the city. The current British Ambassador to Ireland is Paul Johnston.\nHistory\nAlthough the Irish Free State was established in 1922, the United Kingdom did not have a diplomatic mission of its own. The only British representation in the State was that of the Trade Commissioner, first appointed in 1929.\nBy contrast, the Irish High Commission (now the Embassy of Ireland) in London was established as early as 1923.\nIt was not until 1939 that a separate mission, known as the British Representative's Office, was finally established. Following the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act by the Oireachtas in 1948, under which Ireland withdrew from the Commonwealth the following year, the mission was renamed the British Embassy, with its head restyled Ambassador.\nUntil 1972, the embassy was located at 39 Merrion Square, on the southside of Dublin city center. On 2 February of that year, it was burnt to the ground with petrol bombs during demonstrations by large crowds of people. This occurred following the Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry on 30 January, where the British Army's Parachute Regiment shot and killed fourteen unarmed Catholic civilians during a civil rights demonstration.\nIn 1981, protesters tried to storm the British Embassy in response to the IRA hunger strikes of that year.\nThe current embassy building on Merrion Road was built in 1995 and designed by Allies and Morrison. It is built around a central courtyard, a cloister-like space.\nFollowing the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022, the President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins, accompanied by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, attended the British Embassy in Dublin to sign their condolences.\nAmbassador's residence\n]]\nThe British Ambassador's official residence in Dublin is Glencairn House, located on Murphystown Road. Glencairn House has been the official residence of successive British Ambassadors to Ireland since the 1950s.\nSee also\n*Burning of British Embassy\n*Ireland–United Kingdom relations\n*List of diplomatic missions in Ireland\n*List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Ireland\nReferences"
