The awards were first given in 2013, following the restructuring of the Big East Conference. The awards existed in the same format in the Big East from 1991 to 2012.\nThe five awards include Offensive Player of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, Special Teams Player of the Year, Rookie of the Year, and Coach of the Year. Recipients are selected by the votes of the conference's head coaches.\nOffensive Player of the Year\nThe Offensive Player of the Year is awarded to the player voted most outstanding at an offensive position.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD; width:3em;\" |*\n|Unanimous selection\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#CFECEC; width:3em;\" |†\n|Co-Player of the Year\n|-\n|\n|Denotes the number of times the player has been selected\n|}\n{|class=wikitable\n!colspan=8|Positions key\n|-\n| QB || Quarterback\n| RB || Running back\n| TE || Tight end\n| WR || Wide receiver\n|-\n!colspan=8|Class key\n|-\n|Fr || Freshman\n|So || Sophomore\n|Jr || Junior\n|Sr || Senior\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Player\n!School\n!Position\n!Class\n|- align=center\n| 2013 ||  || UCF || QB ||\n|- align=center\n| 2014 ||  || East Carolina || QB ||\n|- align=center\n| 2015 ||  || Navy || QB ||\n|- align=center\n| 2016 ||  || USF || QB ||\n|- align=center\n| 2017 ||  || UCF || QB ||\n|- align=center\n| 2018 ||  (2) || UCF || QB ||\n|- align=center\n| 2019 ||   || Navy || QB ||\n|- align=center\n| 2020 ||   || Cincinnati || QB ||\n|- align=center\n| 2021 ||  (2) || Cincinnati || QB ||\n|-align=center\n| 2022 ||  || Tulane || RB ||\n|-align=center\n| 2023 || || Tulane || QB ||\n|-align=center\n| 2024|| || Army|| QB ||\n|}\nWinners by school\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!School (Seasons) !!
