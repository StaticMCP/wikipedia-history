The Creek were given authority by the United States to operate \"houses of entertainment\" along the route. A tavern was established at \"Warrior Stand\", a stagecoach stop owned by Big Warrior, a prominent Creek Chief.  When Marquis de Lafayette visited the United States in 1824–1825, his party stayed one night at the tavern.\nThe community had a Methodist Episcopalian Church, as well as a Masonic Grand Lodge (#115).\nDemographics\n}}\nWarrior Stand was listed on the 1880 and 1890 U.S. Censuses. It did not appear on any others after.\nToday\nThe Warrior Stand Volunteer Fire Department has been recognized for its exceptional work providing rural fire safety education.  The baseball diamond at the South Macon Recreation Center in Warrior Stand is used for local competitions.\nNotable people\n* George Wylie Henderson, author.\n* William D. Jelks, Governor of Alabama from 1901–1907.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.facebook.com/TheRidgeMaconCountyArchaeologyProject The Ridge Macon County Archaeology Project]\n* [http://nebula.wsimg.com/77b030bc0b75c5a207adb6c1f83bdc2f?AccessKeyId=6D431B73602E8C014FA2&disposition=0&alloworigin=1 Site investigation]"
