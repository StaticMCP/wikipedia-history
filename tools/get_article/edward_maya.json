He is known for his 2009 smash hit single \"Stereo Love\".\nCareer\nIn and around 2006,  Maya worked with many other Romanian artists such as Akcent and Vika Jigulina. He also worked on the song Tornerò, which was performed by Mihai Trăistariu in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. He added in an interview on Beat-Town.com that this song \"was the beginning of my career\"\nIn the summer of 2009, Maya launched his first song as an artist, \"Stereo Love\", reaching No. 2 on the Romanian singles chart. Later that year, \"Stereo Love\" became an international hit in clubs. While this success was followed by concerts worldwide, the song entered the top-5 singles charts in Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK.\nOn 13 May 2010, Maya released his second single \"This Is My Life\". To help maintain control of his career and provide opportunities for other artists, Maya has formed his own record label, Mayavin Records.\nMaya released the song and video for his third single \"Desert Rain\" on Christmas night worldwide. In an interview, Maya talked about his Desert Rain tour, where he mentioned he would begin in India and later Europe, the US, South Africa and Pakistan. His fourth single \"Mono in Love\" was released on 29 November 2012 also featuring Vika Jigulina.\nHe graduated from George Enescu Music High School in Bucharest and is currently a final year student at the Bucharest Conservatory.\nMaya was chosen to dub Grug's voice in the animated movie Onward.\nCopyright controversy\nIn the autumn of 2009, during his stay in Greece, Azerbaijani composer Eldar Mansurov heard the song \"Stereo Love\" and contacted the Romanian Police, claiming the melody in the chorus was taken from his popular 1989 composition \"Bayatılar\". In the music video, the composer of \"Stereo Love\" was only listed as anonymous. The office confirmed with Edward Maya that he had in fact copied Mansurov's work. He admitted to have been fascinated by an accordion version of \"Bayatılar\" which he had come across online in early 2009 and claimed to have tried to contact the author but had been unable to due to his busy schedule. On 19 January 2010, Edward Maya signed an agreement with Eldar Mansurov in Baku, Azerbaijan, confirming their co-authorship of \"Stereo Love\".\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums\n! scope=\"col\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The Stereo Love Show\n|\n* Released: 3 December 2013\n* Label: Mayavin Records\n* Formats: Digital download\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Angels\n|\n* Released: 4 November 2014\n* Label: Mayavin Records\n* Formats: Digital download\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of singles, with selected chart positions and certifications, showing year released and album name\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"11\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Certifications\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| BEL\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| CAN\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| FRA\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| IRE\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| NLD\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| POR\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| SPA\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| SWE\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| SWI\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| UK\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| US\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Stereo Love\" (with Vika Jigulina or Mia Martina)\n| 2009\n| 2 || 10 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 2 || 4 || 16\n|\n* BEA: Gold\n* MC: 2× Platinum\n* BVMI: 2× Platinum\n* PROMUSICAE: 2× Platinum\n* GLF: 7× Platinum\n* IFPI SWI: Platinum\n* BPI: 2× Platinum\n* RIAA: 2× Platinum\n| rowspan=\"2\"| The Stereo Love Show /Devotion\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"This Is My Life\" (featuring Vika Jigulina)\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2010\n| 12 || — || 2 || — || 42 || 7 || — || 58 || 43 || — || —\n|\n* GLF: Platinum\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Desert Rain\" (featuring Vika Jigulina)\n| — || — || — || — || — || 9 || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Mono in Love\" (featuring Vika Jigulina)\n| 2012\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n| The Stereo Love Show\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Feeling\"\n| 2013\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n| rowspan=\"16\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Colombian Girl\"\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2014\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Love of My Life\" (with Vika Jigulina)\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Historia de Amor\"\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Universal Love\" (featuring Andrea and Costi Ioniţă)\n| 2015\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Harem\" (featuring Emilia and Costi Ioniţă)\n| 2018\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Sunny Days\" (featuring United People)\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2019\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Holding On\" (featuring Sleeping Muse and Violet Light)\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Be Free\" (featuring Vika Jigulina)\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Simply the Best\" (featuring Violet Light)\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2020\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| }}(featuring Violet Light)\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Live Alive\" (with Avalok and Violet Light)\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2021\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Feel Your Love\" (with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and Timmy Trumpet)\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"In My Dreams\" (featuring Violet Light)\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2022\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I'm in Love\" (featuring Eliza and Avalok)\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Found You\" (featuring Eliza and Avalok)\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Be Your Friend\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2025\n| — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || — || —\n|\n| Future Renaissance\n|-\n!\"Life\"\n(with Syn Cole)\n|_\n|_\n|_\n|_\n|_\n|_\n|_\n|_\n|_\n|_\n|_\n|\n|Non-album Single\n|-\n| colspan=\"15\" style=\"font-size:90%\"| \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n|}\nSee also\n* List of music released by Romanian artists that has charted in major music markets\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.mayavinrecords.com/ Mayavin Records website]"
