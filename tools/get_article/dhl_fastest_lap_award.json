First awarded in  by DHL, the trophy's official naming patron, it is presented to the driver with the highest number of fastest laps over the course of the season, with one point awarded to the fastest lap holder of a Grand Prix. In the event of a tie, there is a countback and the driver with the highest number of second-fastest laps earns the award. If this is also tied, third-fastest laps are considered, and so on, until a winner is found. The trophy is presented to the winning driver at the final round of the season.\nThe inaugural winner was the Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen with six fastest laps in 2007. The award has been decided on a tiebreaker on four occasions. Räikkönen and his teammate Felipe Massa tied with six fastest laps and two-second-quickest laps in 2007 with the former winning by having more third-fastest laps than the latter. In , Red Bull Racing's Sebastian Vettel and his teammate Mark Webber had three fastest laps at the end of the season but Vettel won with two more second-fastest laps than the latter. Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso and McLaren's Lewis Hamilton each had five fastest laps in  with Alonso finishing ahead with a higher number of second-best laps. In , both Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen set six fastest laps with Hamilton declared the winner for recording more second-fastest laps than Verstappen.\nBritish drivers have won the award seven times, German drivers four times, and Finnish racers three times. Mercedes have won on seven occasions to Red Bull Racing's six and Ferrari's three. The  recipient was Lando Norris of the McLaren team with six fastest laps, the first time he and his team won the award.\nWinners\n(pictured in 2016) has won the award six times, more than any other driver]]\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Key\n|-\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center\" | *\n| Indicates driver won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship that season\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+style=\"line-height:180%;\"|DHL Fastest Lap Award winners\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Winner\n! scope=\"col\" | Nationality\n! scope=\"col\" | Constructor\n! scope=\"col\"  class=\"unsortable\" | Car\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Fastest laps\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Ferrari\n|Ferrari F2007\n|17\n|6\n|Race 17 of 17\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n|Ferrari\n|Ferrari F2008\n|18\n| 10\n|Race 13 of 18\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n|Red Bull Racing\n|Red Bull RB5\n|17\n|3\n|Race 17 of 17\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n|Ferrari\n|Ferrari F10\n|19\n|5\n|Race 19 of 19\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n|Red Bull Racing\n|Red Bull RB7\n|19\n|7\n|Race 18 of 19\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Red Bull Racing\n|Red Bull RB8\n|20\n|6\n|Race 18 of 20\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Red Bull Racing\n|Red Bull RB9\n|19\n| 7\n|Race 17 of 19\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Mercedes\n|Mercedes F1 W05 Hybrid\n|19\n|7\n|Race 18 of 19\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Mercedes\n|Mercedes F1 W06 Hybrid\n|19\n|8\n|Race 18 of 19\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Mercedes\n|Mercedes F1 W07 Hybrid\n|21\n|6\n|Race 20 of 21\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Mercedes\n|Mercedes AMG F1 W08 EQ Power+\n|20\n|7\n|Race 19 of 20\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n|Mercedes\n|Mercedes AMG F1 W09 EQ Power+\n|21\n|7\n|Race 20 of 21\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Mercedes\n|Mercedes AMG F1 W10 EQ Power+\n|21\n|6\n|Race 20 of 21\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Mercedes\n|Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ Performance\n|17\n|6\n|Race 14 of 17\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n|Mercedes\n|Mercedes-AMG F1 W12 E Performance\n|22\n|6\n|Race 21 of 22\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Red Bull Racing\n|Red Bull Racing RB18\n|22\n|5\n|Race 21 of 22\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |*\n|\n|Red Bull Racing\n|Red Bull Racing RB19\n|22\n|9\n|Race 19 of 22\n|\n|-\n|\n! scope=row |\n|\n|McLaren-Mercedes\n|McLaren MCL38\n|24\n|6\n|Race 23 of 24\n|\n|}\nStatistics\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Multiple winners\n|-\n! scope=col | Wins\n! scope=col | Driver\n! scope=col | Years\n|-\n! 6\n|\n| 2014, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021\n|-\n! 3\n|\n| 2009, 2012, 2013\n|-\n! 2\n|\n| 2007, 2008\n|-\n! 2\n|\n| 2022, 2023\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Winners by nationality\n|-\n! scope=col | Country\n! scope=col data-sort-type=number | Wins\n! scope=col data-sort-type=number | Drivers\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 7\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 4\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 3\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 2\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=row |\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Winners by constructor\n|-\n! scope=col | Constructor\n! scope=col data-sort-type=number | Wins\n! scope=col data-sort-type=number | Drivers\n|-\n! scope=row | Mercedes\n| 8\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=row | Red Bull Racing\n| 6\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=row | Ferrari\n| 3\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=row | McLaren\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* DHL Fastest Pit Stop Award\n* List of Formula One drivers who set a fastest lap\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
