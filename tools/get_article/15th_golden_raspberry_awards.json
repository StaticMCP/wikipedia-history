Erotic thriller Color of Night became the first (and so far only) Golden Raspberry Worst Picture \"winner\" to not receive a single other Razzie (out of eight other nominations). Thumbelina became the first animated film to be nominated for and win a Razzie, which it received for Worst Original Song. The Specialist, Wyatt Earp, The Flintstones and Naked Gun 33 : The Final Insult'' each took home two awards, even though the latter two were not nominated for Worst Picture.\nAwards and nominations\nFile:Steven Seagal by Gage Skidmore.jpg|Steven Seagal, Worst Director winner.\nFile:Kevin Costner 2016.jpg|Kevin Costner, Worst Actor winner.\nFile:Sharon Stone by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|Sharon Stone, Worst Actress winner and Worst Screen Couple co-winner.\nFile:O.J.
