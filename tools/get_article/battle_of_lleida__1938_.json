As soon as Franco's troops entered Catalonia, the president of the Catalonia, Lluís Companys, gave a speech in Catalan announcing that \"foreign armies are at the gates of our house.\" He called on the Catalans \"to fight, to work and to resist, because to resist is to triumph and because we could not live without freedom. If the enemy wins, our language would be persecuted, our institutions mocked, our people subjugated, our customs mocked.\"\nBattle\nThe Republicans deployed 46th Division in the city with the mission of defending Lleida. It was supported by troops from the Republican 16th and  Divisions. Republican units were deployed in the surrounding orchards in order to establish a defensive perimeter.\nAftermath\nRepublican forces suffered heavy casualties during the battle. The Republican 46th Division suffered a 40% casualty rate while the Nationalist 13th Division suffered a 10% casualty rate by comparison.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
