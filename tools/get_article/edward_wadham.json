He kept detailed diaries throughout his adult life, now in the possession of the Cumbria Archive Service, many of which cover the growth and development of the town of Barrow-in-Furness, then in Lancashire now in Cumbria, England.\nTogether with Sir James Ramsden, Henry Schneider and Josiah T. Smith, and as three-times Mayor of Barrow-in-Furness, he did much to open up the iron and steel industries in Barrow, which grew from a tiny nineteenth century hamlet into the biggest iron and steel centre in the world, and a major ship-building force in just forty years.\nEarly life\nEdward Wadham was born in 1828 at Frenchay Manor House, near Bristol, the fifth son of ten children of Thomas and Elizabeth Wadham.\nHis father Thomas Wadham (1796-1849) attended Wadham College, Oxford, from 1817 to 1819, and was High Sheriff of Bristol in 1843, the same year Isambard Kingdom Brunel completed construction of the SS Great Britain in Bristol Harbour.\nHis grandfather, John Wadham (1762-1843) of Frenchay Manor House and Bristol Parade, had been from 1789 a director and co-owner with Henry Rickett of the Phoenix Glassworks at Temple Meads in Bristol, known as Wadham Ricketts & Co, which manufactured Bristol blue glass, and in 1820 was a director of the Bristol Floating Harbour Company.\nEdward Wadham trained as a civil and mining engineer.\nHis siblings were:\n* Thomas Wadham, born 1820 - 1855   Buried at Sighthill Cemetery, Glasgow.\n* Rev.

His first action was to install weighing machines at Dalton-in-Furness railway sidings and Ulverston Canal.  The move was not popular with the carters of iron ore.\nA significant conversation occurred on 5 April when he asked Mr Cranke, land agent to the Duke, for an advance on his salary.  Cranke offered him an easy mining job, which he was unable to accept for fear of Mr Lumley, the Duke's chief steward.  Cranke advised him to write for permission, and on 17 April he wrote to Mr Lumley thanking him for his permission to take up any small engineering job that might come his way.\nHe was soon engaged as mineral agent to William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale and surveying the line of tramways for Harrison Ainslie & Co.  Mr Cranke was also consulted about his moving into Lindal Mount with William George Ainslie, son of Montague Ainslie of Grizedale New Hall, grandfather to Jack Ainslie, Liberal MP.  They shared a house and rented stables together for some years, and Edward Wadham later married William's sister Mary Elizabeth Ainslie.\nWadham remained at Lindal Mount until he moved into Millwood Manor, built for him by the Duke of Buccleuch, in 1862. As a Director of the Furness Railway he later had his own railway siding extended to the bottom of his garden at Millwood Manor. He was elected Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 6 December 1853, and Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 17 December 1866, and was connected with the Institution for sixty of his eighty-five years.\nIn February 1872, following a bad attack of rheumatism, Wadham was certified as unfit to work underground, and the work of surveying the pits passed to his employees.\nPositions held:\n* Proprietor of the firm of surveyors known at different times as Wadham & Turner, Wadham, Turner & Strongitharm and Wadham & Son.\n* Mineral agent from 1851 to 1911 to Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch (1806-1884), and William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch (1831-1914).\n* Surveyor to William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire at Holker Hall.\n* Surveyor to George Wyndham, 1st Baron Leconfield of Cockermouth Castle.\n* Mineral agent to the William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale (1787-1872).\n* Mineral agent to Josslyn Pennington, 5th Baron Muncaster (1834-1917).\n* Director of Furness Railway from 1885 to 1911\n* Director of Richard Thomas & Co and the Lydney Tinplate Co.\n* Director of Walney Exploration Co and Vivian Diamond Boring Co and Barrow Salt Co\n* Director of Gillfoot Mining Co\n* Director of Barrow Steam Cornmill Co until it was wound up in 1884\n* Manager of Longlands Mines\n* Chairman of North Lonsdale Iron & Steel Co until he resigned in 1899\n* Director of Barrow Hematite Steel Company\nPolitics\nWadham was a staunch member of the Conservative and Unionist party.

On 26 April 1904, Wadham was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Lancashire.\nWife and children\nHe married Mary Elizabeth Ainslie, daughter of Montague Ainslie on 20 September 1860, and at one point owned a steamship called the 'Mary Elizabeth Wadham'.
