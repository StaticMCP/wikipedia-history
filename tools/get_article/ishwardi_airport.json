Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated regular flights from here to Dhaka until 1996. On 18 November 2013, United Airways resumed flights to Dhaka, thus commercial services resumed after 17 years, but flights to the airport were suspended in mid-2014.\n]]\nHistory\nDuring World War II, the airport was known as the Hijli Base Area, and was used by the Twentieth Air Force. It hosted the United States Army Air Force XX Bomber Command 58th Bombardment Wing between 8–24 February 1945, prior to its deployment to the Mariana Islands.\nAirlines and destinations\nAs of August 2014, no airlines serve Ishwardi Airport. United Airways was the last airline to operate there; they stopped services in mid -2014.\nLocation dispute\nA persistent dispute has raged between residents of Natore and Pabna, each asserting that Ishwardi Airport is situated within their respective districts. In reality, the administrative building of the airport geographically falls under Lalpur Upazila of Natore District. But due to historical and socio-economic reasons, the airport area is considered to be a specialized administrative area of Ishwardi Upazila of Pabna District. According to official documents from Bangladesh's Civil Aviation Authority, the airport's location is documented as being within Pabna District.\nSee also\n* Operation Matterhorn\n* List of airports in Bangladesh\nReferences"
