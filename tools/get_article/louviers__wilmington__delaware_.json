Additions were made in 1833, 1837, after 1837, and after 1901. The second addition included a third floor and a facade with a Greek Revival style porch.\nFrom 1837 to 1865, it was the home of Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont, a member of the prominent Du Pont family. Also located on the property are contributing gate houses, and an iron bridge (1877) that joined Louviers to the powder yards.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The house has since been demolished, and its site incorporated into the DuPont Country Club. However, the gate houses along Rockland Road and the iron bridge over the Brandywine remain.\nSee also\n*Lower Louviers and Chicken Alley\nReferences"
