Hawksmoor later designed Castle Howard, assisted by John Vanbrugh, and Vanbrugh designed his second obelisk, for the site where the approach road makes a right-hand turn. The structure was completed in 1714, and is about  tall. Vanbrugh later erected smaller obelisks elsewhere on the estate.\nThe obelisk was grade I listed in 1954. It was restored in 2004. It is built of stone and has a square plan. It stands on a massive square base with a pulvinated cornice, and on the east and west sides are inscriptions. The latter is now illegible, but it was a verse stating the intentions of Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle, who commissioned the work on the estate:\nGallery\nFile:Approach Road to the Castle Howard Obelisk - geograph.org.uk - 1655511.jpg|Long view from the north\nSee also\n*Grade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\n*Listed buildings in Henderskelfe\nReferences"
