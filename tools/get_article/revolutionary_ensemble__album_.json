On this live 1977 date, each of the members doubles or triples up on other instruments so there is a variety of textures and timbres to be heard here, including kalimba, flute, and piano. Mostly it's Jenkin's fluent, fugal violin improvisations that predominate, however. At their most successful, these jams sound like a loosely strung Bach \"Chaconne\" accompanied by bass and drums\".\nBob Blumenthal, writing for The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide, commented: \"Their... instrumentation is perfectly balanced and allows for maximum exploration without unnecessary assault. All three are demonic players, though each... knew the value of restraint, and all three wrote intriguing material...The album captures much of the range, intensity and complementary spirit that made the Revolutionary Ensemble special.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"Clear Spring\" (Sirone) – 10:31\n# \"March 4-1\" (Jerome Cooper) – 11:48\n# \"Chicago\" (Leroy Jenkins) – 5:55\n# \"Revolutionary Ensemble\" (Jenkins, Sirone, Cooper) – 14:56\nPersonnel\n*Leroy Jenkins – violin, kalimba, voice, flute\n*Sirone − bass, flute\n*Jerome Cooper – drums, piano, balafon, chirimia, flute\nReferences"
