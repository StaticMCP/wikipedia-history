This small building survives to this day as part of the Early Settlers Museum operated by the Woocoo Historical Society.\nElizabeth Mary Thomas née Eaton, formerly Mrs B J Nichols, donated land from the property Clifton for a church and cemetery. Subscription towards the building fund were made on the understanding that the church was dedicated in the name of St Mary to the memory of Woocoo Shire soldiers killed in action in World War I. Opening services of the St Mary's Anglican Church were held on 26 October 1919.  The church was built by Matthew Edmund Rooney of Maryborough. There is a group of three stained glass windows behind the altar.

It is now known as the Brooweena War Memorial.\nA timber mill was established in 1924, ensuring the continuing existence of the town by being its major employer. The mill was destroyed in a fire in 1988 and was rebuilt by local people.
