It comprises both sides of East Howard Street along the four blocks between 1st and 5th Avenues.  It was the new business district designed and built for Hibbing by the Oliver Iron Mining Company from 1920 to 1921, when the company arranged to move the city a mile south to expand the Hull–Rust–Mahoning Open Pit Iron Mine.  The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 for its local significance in the theme of community planning and development.  It was nominated as a key portion of Hibbing that represents the efforts of the Oliver Iron Mining Company to relocate the entire town, and the economic importance of iron mining on the Mesabi Range.\nThe historic district consists of 34 contributing properties.  Two, the Androy Hotel and the Delvic Building, are also listed individually on the National Register.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in St. Louis County, Minnesota\nReferences"
