The Federal style building was later owned by John Lander (1798–1889), founder of the Warren Foundry & Machine Company, one of the town's largest employers. An octagonal tower was added around 1885 during a renovation, which added Italianate features. The three-story brick townhouse at 102 South Main Street, the Lander–Stewart Mansion, was built around 1880 by Jacob S. Stewart, son-in-law of Lander. It features a brownstone facade and Italianate/Neo-Grec architecture.\nGallery\nFile:Lander-Stewart Mansion, Phillipsburg, NJ - information plaque.jpg|Lander–Stewart Mansion plaque\nFile:Stites Building, Phillipsburg, NJ - information plaque.jpg|Stites Building plaque\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Warren County, New Jersey\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
