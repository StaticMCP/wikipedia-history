His pulp-fiction writings on cavalry and Indians were published in paperbacks or serialized in the Saturday Evening Post.\nBellah was the author of 19 novels, including The Valiant Virginian (the inspiration for the 1961 NBC television series The Americans), and Blood River. Some of his short stories were turned into films by John Ford, including Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and Rio Grande.  With Willis Goldbeck he wrote the screenplays for Sergeant Rutledge (1960) and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962).\nBiography\nBellah earned his B.A. from Columbia University and M.A. in history from Georgetown University.\nIn World War I, Bellah enlisted in the Canadian Army, and served as a pilot in the 117th Squadron of Great Britain's Royal Flying Corps.  These experiences formed the basis of his 1928 novel Gods of Yesterday.\nFor several years after the war, he was a writer for advertising firms and instructor in English at Columbia. In the 1930s he worked as a journalist for the New York Post.\nDuring World War II, Bellah served in the United States Army, starting as a lieutenant in the 16th Infantry, was detailed to the General Staff Corps before Pearl Harbor, and was later assigned to Headquarters 1st Infantry Division, later with the 80th Infantry Division.  Later he served on the staff of Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten in Southeast Asia.  He was attached to General Wingate's Chindits in combat in Burma, and to General Stillwell and to Colonel Cochran's 1st Air Commando Group.  He left the service with the rank of Colonel.\nHe was a member of the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of California beginning in 1952.\nHis short story \"Spanish Man's Grave\" is considered by some to be one of the finest American Western stories ever written.  His last script was A Thunder of Drums.  Bellah's depiction of the Apache is protested by some and lauded as realistic by others.\nIn the early stages of his career, Elmore Leonard modelled his style closely after Bellah's writing.\nHe died of a heart attack in Los Angeles during a visit to his friend James Francis, Cardinal McIntyre, Archbishop of Los Angeles. His manuscripts are stored at Columbia University and Boston University.\nPresident Ronald Reagan was a fan of Bellah's books and said ″He was called the Kipling of America for writing of that great era in American history.″\nNovels\n* These Frantic Years, New York: D.

In particular Sergeant Rutledge (1960) is considered pioneering in its story of a black cavalry soldier. Nancy Schoenberger interviewed Bellah's son, James Bellah Jr., for her book. He said of his father that \"His politics were just a little right of Attila. He was a fascist, a racist, and a world-class bigot.\"\nExternal links\n*"
