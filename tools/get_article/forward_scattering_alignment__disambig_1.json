The FSA is most commonly used in optics, specifically when working with Jones Calculus because the electromagnetic wave is typically followed through a series of optical components that represent separate scattering events. It is also considered in the content of remote sensing and radar.\nFSA gives rise to regular eigenvalue equations. The general alternative coordinate system in electromagnetic scattering is the Back Scattering Alignment (BSA) which is primarily used in radar. Both coordinate systems contain essentially the same information and meaning, and thus a scattering matrix can be transformed from one to the other by use of the matrix,\n: S_{FSA} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} S_{BSA}\nReferences\nSee also\n*Forward scatter"
