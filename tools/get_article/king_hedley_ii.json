Set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1985, it tells the story of an ex-con in Pittsburgh trying to rebuild his life. The play has been described as one of Wilson's darkest, telling the tale of a man trying to save $10,000 by selling stolen refrigerators so that he can buy a video store, as well as revisiting stories of other characters initially presented in Seven Guitars. The play is set in The Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nHedley’s wish, now that he has returned to Pittsburgh from prison, is to support himself by selling refrigerators and to start a family. Set during the Reagan Administration, the play comments critically on the supply-side economics theories of the day, examining whether their stated aim of providing trickle-down benefits to all Americans truly improved the lot of urban African Americans.\n;Characters\n* King Hedley II\n* Tonya, King Hedley II's wife\n* Ruby, King Hedley II's mother\n* Elmore, a southern hustler (and former boyfriend of Ruby)\n* Mister, friend\n* Stool Pigeon, a wise man and a prophet\nNotes on characters\nKing Hedley II draws \"on characters established in Seven Guitars, King Hedley II shows the shadows of the past reaching into the present.\" Some of the characters presented earlier include King Hedley II, \"the spiritual son of King Hedley from Seven Guitars and Stool Pigeon, a \"sixty-five year old harmonica player...now a newspaper-collecting history carrier\".
