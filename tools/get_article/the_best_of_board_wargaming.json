The reviews, however, are far too short, and not properly conceived for the mission in hand. If space is short you cannot afford to waste it on 'humourous' anecdotes about the game. Frequently you get too little of the game's structure or its ambience.\"\nIn Issue 39 of The Space Gamer, Steve Jackson commented \"This one belongs in the library of the game club, collector, or serious designer. As a reference work for the average gamer, fantasy/SF or otherwise, I couldn't recommend it. Consumer Guide's Complete Book of Wargames [...] is bigger, better, and half the price.\"\nReferences"
