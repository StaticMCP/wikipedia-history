The signatories were Louis Adolphe Bonard (France), Carlos Palanca Gutiérrez (Spain) and Phan Thanh Giản (Vietnam). Based on the terms of the accord, Tự Đức ceded Saigon, the island of Poulo Condor and three southern provinces of what was to become known as Cochinchina (Bien Hoa, Gia Dinh, and Dinh Tuong) to the French. The treaty was confirmed by the Treaty of Huế signed on 14 April 1863.\nSee also\n* French conquest of Vietnam\n* Western imperialism in Asia\nReferences\n*\n*[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-14606.html The Encyclopedia of the Nations – Country Data – Vietnam]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050404054723/http://oferriere.free.fr/Jours/jours06/jours0605.htm C'est arrivé un jour – 5 Juin]"
