The  statue was commissioned by Richard McBride in 1912, and completed in 1914. World War I delayed the sculpture's unveiling until 1921. The statue was vandalized in 2021 regarding the controversial meaning connected to residential schools.\nSee also\n* Cultural depictions of Queen Victoria\n* List of statues of Queen Victoria\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
