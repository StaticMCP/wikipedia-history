The recipient is selected by a jury based on the accepted abstracts for oral contributions to the ANGEL conference. The jury includes the conference chairs, program committee members, and international advisory board members.\nThe first laureate was honored in 2018.\nLaureates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year !!
