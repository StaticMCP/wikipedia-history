He specializes in Canadian Aboriginal law and is the author of Aboriginal Law in Canada, a leading publication on the subject.\nWoodward has represented numerous First Nations groups in landmark cases including Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia, the first successful Aboriginal title claim in Canada.\nWoodward has practiced law since 1979, primarily in the areas of Aboriginal law and environmental law. He has represented more than a hundred First Nations groups and organizations in a wide variety of legal actions including the landmark case, ''Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia, the first successful Aboriginal title claim in Canada.\nWoodward wrote the first draft of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which provides constitutional protection to the indigenous and treaty rights of indigenous peoples in Canada. Ian Waddell, in his book Take the Torch: A Political Memoir, states that Woodward drafted the clause in January 1981, during negotiations in Ottawa with Minister of Justice Jean Chrétien. This is also referred to in the book Box of Treasures or Empty Box? Twenty Years of Section 35'' on page 18.\nWoodward established the legal firm Woodward and Company in Victoria, B.C. He was also an adjunct professor of law at the University of Victoria for nineteen years, where he was instrumental in creating the university's first course in Aboriginal law.\nIn December 2011 Woodward was instated as a Queen's Counsel for the Canadian province of British Columbia.\nPublications\nAboriginal Law\nAboriginal Law is a comprehensive collection of all the laws in Canada relating specifically to Aboriginal people. International law, constitutional law, statute, common law and custom are all covered, with updates six times per year and frequent revisions to whole chapters and sections in this rapidly-evolving field. Native Law was reviewed by the Alberta Law Review Society which described the text as, \"a valuable aid for legal researchers who wish to establish a background in the subject area as well as for practitioners who need to know what law applies to specific issues before them.\"\nConsolidated Aboriginal Law Statutes, Regulations and Treaties\nUnder the editorial direction of Jack Woodward, this work continues to bring together a timely consolidation of the significant statutes, regulations, and treaties that have an impact on the area of native law. Additionally, this text contains helpful finding tools that simplify research, including a detailed master table of contents, a table of contents for each statute, and a comprehensive key word index.\nBullen & Leake & Jacob's Canadian Precedents of Pleadings\nBullen & Leake & Jacob’s Precedents of Pleadings is widely regarded as the essential guide to drafting statements of case. It offers the advocate a stock of authoritative, structured precedents of statements of case complete with guiding commentary across both mainstream and specialist areas of practice. Woodward wrote part 1 which covers critical underlying principles through discussion and application within some of the more challenging areas of Aboriginal Law.\nNotable legal cases\nMacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v Mullin, 1985\nSource:\nMacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v Mullin, 1985. In 1984, Woodward represented Tla-o-qui-aht and Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation First Nations in legal proceedings to defend Aboriginal rights to Meares Island; [20] the case resulted in the island being designated as a tribal park.\nTsilhqot’in Nation v. BC, 2014\nSource:\nTsilhqot’in Nation v. British Columbia is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of Canada and the first case to successfully establish a declaration of Aboriginal title over land that a nation had historically occupied. The underlying circumstances that established the reasoning behind that case begin in 1983 when the province issued licence to Carrier Lumber to begin logging in the remote areas of central British Columbia which was claimed by the Xeni Gwet'in band of the Tsilhqot'in Nation. The Xeni Gwet'in filed suit seeking a court declaration that would prohibit Carrier Lumber's commercial logging operations in this area, and establish their claim for Aboriginal title to the land. After five years at trial, both the federal and provincial governments opposed the title claim which resulted to a final appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Beverly McLachlin, unanimously allowed the appeal. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Tsilhqot'in people were entitled to a declaration of Aboriginal title to the 1,750 square kilometre region they had historically occupied.\nFort McKay First Nation v Prosper Petroleum Ltd, 2020\nSource:\nOn 24 April 2020, the Alberta Court of Appeal released a decision in Fort McKay First Nation v Prosper Petroleum Ltd, allowing Fort McKay First Nation's (FMFN) challenge to the Alberta Energy Regulator's (AER) decision to approve Prosper Petroleum's oil sands project. In granting its approval of the project, the AER did not consider the negotiations between the Alberta government and FMFN over land management and the impacts of future oil sands development on FMFN’s Treaty 9 rights. The Alberta Court of Appeal determined that the failure to consider these negotiations in the AER decision was not in keeping with the honour of the Crown. The court vacated the project approval and directed the Alberta Energy Regulator to reconsider whether the project is in the public’s best interest after considering FMFN's Treaty 8 rights.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
