Haskell Home for Nurses, also known as the New England Baptist Hospital Training School For Nurses, is a historic academic complex in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.  Its original building, a 1-1/2 to -story brick-faced wood-frame building, was designed by Edward Sears Read in the Jacobethan style and built in 1922.  This building originally housed a dormitory and classrooms.  In 1931 a large wing gave the building an L shape, and another series of additions in 1940 gave the complex its present appearance, surrounding a courtyard atop Parker Hill.  The complex was converted into an assisted-living facility in 2002.\nThe property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in southern Boston, Massachusetts\nReferences"
