Some sections remain in use for bauxite and aluminium freight while the section from Montego Bay to the Appleton Estate remained open for a while as a tourist attraction.\nGradients and curvature\nFrom Kingston the line ran west along the coastal plain, within  of sea level, for about  before starting a gentle climb over  from Bodles to  near Lancaster Halt. From here there was a plateau for about  to the Milk River and the start of the  climb through Scotts Pass and Porus to  just north of Kendal.\nBetween Kendal and Mile Gully the line reaches its summit at around ; in this section the ruling curvature was  and the ruling gradient was 1 in 30 (3.33%).\nFrom Mile Gully there was a gentle descent over  to  near Raheen. From here the line ran on the level across the Appleton Plain to Maggotty and the start of a climb to  near Stonehenge. From here to Catadupa the line ran on the level then descended to  at Seven River. Another level section brought it to Long Hill Tunnel and the final descent into Montego Bay.\nStations and halts\nThere were 22 stations and 17 halts:\n{|\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|\n*Kingston (Terminus)\n*Greenwich Town Halt\n*Marcus Garvey Drive Halt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n*Hunts Bay Halt\n*Gregory Park Station\n*Grange Lane Station\n*Spanish Town Station\n*Horizon Park Halt\n*Hartlands Halt\n*Bushy Park Halt\n*Old Harbour Station\n*May Pen Station\n*Jacob’s Hut\n*Four Paths Station\n*Rock Halt\n*Clarendon Park Station\n*Scott’s Pass Halt\n*Porus Station\n*Williamsfield Station\n*Kendal Station\n*Grove Place Halt\n*Greenvale Station\n*Comfort Hall Halt\n*Duck Pond Halt\n*Oxford Halt\n*Balaclava Station\n*Siloah Halt\n*Appleton Station\n*Appleton Tourist Halt\n*Maggotty Station\n*Ipswich Station\n*Breadnut Walk Halt\n*Stonehenge Station\n*Catadupa Station\n*Cambridge Station\n*Montpelier Station\n*Anchovy Station\n*Ailford’s Halt\n*Gordon’s Halt\n*Montego Bay (Terminus)\n|\n|}\nTunnels\nThere are 13 tunnels on the line:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!rowspan=2| No. !!rowspan=2| Name !!colspan=2| Distance from Kingston !!rowspan=2| Parish !!colspan=2| Length\n|-\n! miles !! km !! feet !! metres\n|-\n| 1 || Scotts Pass ||  || 71.2 ||rowspan=2| Clarendon || 70 || 21.3\n|-\n| 2 || Scotts Pass ||  || 71.6 || 170 || 51.8\n|-\n| 3 || Comfort Hall ||  || 105.4 ||rowspan=5| St. Elizabeth || 688 || 209.1\n|-\n| 4 || Balaclava || 70 || 112.6 || 348 || 106.1\n|-\n| 5 || Highworth || 84 || 135.2 || 182 || 55.5\n|-\n| 6 || Y S ||  || 136.0 || 218 || 66.4\n|-\n| 7 || Ipswich ||  || 138.8 || 855 || 260.6\n|-\n| 8 ||  ||  || 141.2 ||rowspan=6| St. James || 555 || 164.6\n|-\n| 9 || Merrywood ||  || 142.4 || 362 || 115.8\n|-\n| 10 || Anchovy ||  || 168.2 || 102 || 31.1\n|-\n| 11 || Ramble || 108 || 173.8 || 182 || 55.5\n|-\n| 12 || Bogue Hill ||  || 174.6 || 1,276 || 388.9\n|-\n| 13 || Bogue Hill ||  || 175.0 || 458 || 139.6\n|}\nBridges\nThere were 51 significant bridges and one viaduct on the line\n* Trench Town Gully\n* Shoemakers Gully\n* Cockfight Bridge (gully)\n* Salt River\n* Rio Cobre\n* Irrigation canal east\n* Irrigation canal west\n* Creek Town Gully\n* Track (rail over)\n* Irrigation canal\n* Cut Throat Gully\n* Spring Garden River\n* Irrigation canal east\n* Irrigation canal west\n* Coleburns Gully\n* Church Pen Gully east\n* Church Pen Gully west\n* Stony Gully\n* Fraser's Gully\n* Old Harbour(?)
