He graduated from the University of Queensland with a medical degree (MB BS) in 1965.\nPolitical career\nEdwards entered the Queensland Legislative Assembly as the Liberal member for Ipswich in 1972. He was the Minister for Health between 1974–1978 and then held the position of Liberal Party leader, Deputy Premier and Treasurer until 1983 when he retired from the Queensland Parliament to take on the role of chairman and chief executive of World Expo '88, held in Brisbane in 1988.\nLater activities\nEdwards was Chair and CEO of the 1988 World Exposition, Brisbane's World Expo '88.\nIn 1993, he was elected the twelfth Chancellor of the University of Queensland, holding the office until 9 February 2009.
