As such, local pro-Polish population organized a force of 2 000 soldiers, led by Ramsz Krzykowski, to be sent to Kneiphof, to help in the battle. On their way there, they besieged the Teutonic castle in the nearby town of the town of Eylau (now Iława, Poland. The besieging forces were commanded by Ramsz Krzykowski. In the morning of 25 May 1455, the rebel forces were attacked by the Teutonic cavalry, that consisted of 550 cavalrymen, that was led by Ludwig von Helfenstein, and John von Blanckenstein. The forces came from near by Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Utilizing the element of surprise, they managed to defeat Polish rebels, inflicting major casualties on Polish side. In the battle, on Polish side, died between 800 and 1000 people, and 300 were taken captive. Krzyszkowski, together with around 250 soldiers, retreated to Bartoszyce.\nCitations\nNotes\nReferences"
