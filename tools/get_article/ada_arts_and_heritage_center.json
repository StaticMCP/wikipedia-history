The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Ada Public Library in 1989.  The building was built in 1939 to serve as the public library of Ada.  In 1981, having outgrown this original building, the Ada Public Library moved to its\ncurrent location at 12th and Rennie.\nDesigned by architect Albert S. Ross, it was built by the Chapman Construction Co. during 1938–39. It was funded by a Public Works Administration grant and by a local bond issue.\nThe building was deemed \"architecturally significant because its Y-shaped plan is unique in Oklahoma and because its designer, Albert S. Ross, is one of Oklahoma's foremost architects....the Ada building is generally considered 'to be Ross's finest achievement. The building is virtually pristine, retaining almost one hundred percent of its original materials and also retaining its integrity of workmanship, design, feeling, and association.\"\nThe building is now known as the Ada Arts and Heritage Center and serves as a museum with changing art displays and a collection of historic photographs.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160822073032/http://www.adaartsheritage.com/ Ada Arts and Heritage Center] - official site\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160822073032/http://www.adaartsheritage.com/#!our-history/csn3 Building's history] - Ada Arts and Heritage Center\n* [http://www.lasr.net/travel/city.php?Ada+Arts+and+Heritage+Center&TravelTo=OK0510001&Attraction_ID=OK0510001a002&VA=Y Visiting information]\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192455/http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Ada_Public_Library\n* [https://npgallery.nps.gov/nrhp/AssetDetail?assetID=4c5a49ba-e7ec-481b-9c7f-0d406a8c4632 National Register of Historic Places] - record on this location"
