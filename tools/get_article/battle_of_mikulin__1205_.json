The allied armies encountered Halych and Volynian troops supporting the Romanovichi. After day-long fighting, Daniel's forces retreated to Halych. The support of Hungarian troops, which King Andrew II of Hungary sent to the aid of the Romanovichi, proved decisive. Thanks to this, Halych was successfully defended and the army of Rurik and the Olgovichi abandoned the siege. Hungarian assistance not only strengthened the city's defences, but also prevented the Halych boyars, opposed to the Romanovichi rule, from cooperating with the invaders.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
