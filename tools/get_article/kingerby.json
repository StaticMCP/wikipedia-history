It is situated  north west from the town of Market Rasen. The hamlet of Bishop Bridge lies about  to the south-west. In 1931 the parish had a population of 75. On 1 April 1936 the parish was abolished to form Osgodby.\nThe parish church is dedicated to Saint Peter and is a Grade I listed building cared for by The Churches Conservation Trust; it became redundant in 1981.\nIt dates from the early 11th century and is built of Ironstone.\nThere are three monuments in the church to 13th- and 14th-century knights.  There are also several marble tablets to the Young family\nof Kingerby Hall. To the north and east of the church are scheduled  earthworks of an ecclesiastical enclosure in which Elsham Priory was located.\nKingerby Hall, or Manor, is a Grade II listed building dating from 1812. It is situated on the scheduled site of a motte and bailey castle and a later moated manor house. The castle was built sometime prior to 1216, in which year it burnt down. In the 12th and 13th centuries a village grew up around the castle, but in the 17th century the village population declined.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
