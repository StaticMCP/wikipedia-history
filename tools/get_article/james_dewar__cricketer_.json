He was educated in England at Winchester College. After leaving Winchester, Dewar purchased a commission as an ensign in the 49th Regiment of Foot in 1846. He purchased the rank of lieutenant in April 1850, with Dewar marrying Kate Jane Dayrell in November of the same year. He served in the British Army in the Crimean War, during which he was present for the Battle of the Alma, the Battle of Inkerman and the Siege of Sevastopol. In the second year of the war, he was promoted to the rank of captain. Following the end of his first marriage, he married Benares Anna de Stieger in November 1855. Dewar made a single appearance in first-class cricket for the Gentlemen of England against the Gentlemen of Surrey and Sussex at Lord's in July 1856. Batting once in the match, Dewar was dismissed without scoring in the Gentlemen of England first-innings by Frederick Oliver, while with the ball he bowled 23 wicketless overs, conceding 44 runs. He was decorated by the Ottoman Empire with the Order of the Medjidie, 5th Class in August 1856, while the following year he was decorated by France with the Legion of Honour. He was promoted to the rank of major from brevet major in March 1858. He died in July 1861 at Middleton Stoney, Oxfordshire.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
