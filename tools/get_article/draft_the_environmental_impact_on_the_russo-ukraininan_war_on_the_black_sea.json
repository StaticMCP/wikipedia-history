This impact has been characterized by extensive pollution, loss of marine biodiversity and direct life, habitat degradation, and ecological disruptions. As the Black Sea is an ongoing theater of war, naval warfare such as underwater explosions and sabotage of infrastructure in the Black Sea have exacerbated the vulnerability of this body of water and has triggered significant environmental crises.\nMajor Environmental Incidents and Impacts\nOil Pollution\nSevere oil spills have resulted as a consequence of the conflict.  Two Russian tankers in the Federations so-called “shadow fleet” of cargo ships, whose sale of oil fund the conflict, collided near the Kerch strait in December 2024. These tankers subsequently sunk and released approximately 6,300 tons of mazut oil into the Black Sea. The spill resulted in extensive coastal and oceanic contamination, with Russian President Vladimir Putin addressing the spill directing, noting it was “one of the most severe environmental challenges (Russia has faced) in years.” The ongoing nature of the conflict in affected coastlines has made rescue and clean-up efforts challenging, with other organizations having their work limited by the Russian government, who labels some environmental groups foreign agents.\nKakhovka Dam Disaster\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in June 2023 had several consequences in black sea due to the spilling 14.4 cubic meters of water tainted by debris, pollutants and sediments into the coastal environment of Odessa. Contaminants recorded by researchers in the Black Sea included high concentrations of copper, zinc, arsenic, oil products, and chlorine. Toxic algal blooms began in the Black Sea days after the dam breach, fed by the presence of ammonium and sewage from livestock farms and cesspools. Environmental organizations noted that the algal blooms killed over 70% of the mollusks along the Black Sea coast near Odessa, additionally threatening fishing communities that rely on healthy marine life. Due to the impact from the disaster, The European Parliament declared Russia’s explosion of the dam to be an “ecocide,” an intentional and orchestrated attempt at killing off wildlife and impacting nature.\nImpact on Marine Mammals\nThe ongoing nature of the conflict has made it difficult for researchers to fully assess the impact the war has had on marine life. This is because aerial assessments are limited by the active theater of war. In 2022, more than 900 cases of bottlenose dolphin, white-sided dolphin, and harbor porpoise deaths were recorded in the Black Sea region, with researchers noting this likely represents a fraction of the cetaceans killed in that year. Despite the challenges in accurately documenting the impact of war on whales and dolphins, biologists from the Royal Society estimate that the strandings of cetaceans have increased by nearly 14 times since pre-war levels, with deaths linked to military sonar, underwater explosions, and pollution.\nMarine Habitat Damage\nBecause the Black Sea is semi-enclosed in nature, marine life and ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to pollution and habitat loss. Romanian fisherman have noted the presence of heavy metals on coastlines, linked to military equipment. Detritus from exploded boats continues to wash up on Romanian shores, as do both drifting mines.\nRussia has used the Opuksy Nature Reserve as a military training group, destroying areas of coastal wetlands and marine environments formerly protected by Ukraine.  In total, researchers estimate that all marine nature reserves along the Ukrainian coasts have been affected by warfare, impacting all possible forms of marine life in the region.\nCriticism of Current Response\nUkrainian researchers and international environmental organizations have criticized the Ukrainian government for lack of adequate funding of research that studies the environmental impact of war on the Black Sea, as well as the embezzlement of research funds meant to study the topic. Criticisms have also included an over-reliance on volunteer-driven initiatives to both mitigate and clean up environmental impacts on the Black Sea, when specialist attention is necessary. Without immediate attention for ecosystem revitalization , experts warn that the Russo-Ukrainian war will irreversibly damage the Black Sea, essentially cripping its fishing industries, coastal economic livelihoods, and marine life.\nProposed Efforts\nGiven the ongoing environmental crisis in the Black Sea, researchers and policymakers have recommended enhanced restoration and mitigation efforts.\nMultilateral Environmental Initiatives\nThe Carnegie Endowment recommended the establishment of a multilateral environmental initiative helmed by Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania and Türkiye, following the Bucharest Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea Against Pollution. Such an initiative would require financial and political support from the European Union and Black Sea litoral states.\nEnhanced Minesweeping Operations and Oil Spill Clearance\nBulgaria, Romania and Turkey have committed to increasing both coastal and naval minesweeping operations, aimed at mitigating the impact of mines on coastal communities, commercial shipping, and fishing activities. Environmental groups have called for this coordination to be applied to emergency response capabilities for managing chemical and oil spills in the Sea.\nProsecution of Ecocide\nEuropean policymakers have called for Russia to be held accountable for the environmental damage it has caused to both Ukrainian and littoral waters. While environmental crimes exist in the Ukrainian Criminal Code, no such legal instrument exists at the international level.  Elevating ecocide to a “core crime” of the Rome Statute would allow for the International Criminal Court to investigate, and subsequently prosecute states who commit acts with the knowledge that they will damage the environment.\nIncreased Monitoring\nMarine biologists and environmental advocacy groups have the suggested the expansion of marine protected areas (MPAs) that are off-limits for use in the theater of war. These areas would be subject to enhanced monitoring and detection from scientists who would therefore be able to warn of environmental hazards, without being threatened by the proximity of ongoing armed conflict.\nReferences"
