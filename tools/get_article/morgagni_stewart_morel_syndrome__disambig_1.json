Other signs and symptoms include headaches, vertigo, hirsutism, menstrual disorder, galactorrhoea, obesity, depression, and seizures.  It is characterized by a thickening of the inner table of the frontal part of the skull, a usually benign condition known as  hyperostosis frontalis interna.  The syndrome was first described in 1765. It is named after the Italian anatomist and pathologist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the British neurologist Roy Mackenzie Stewart, and the Swiss psychiatrist Ferdinand Morel.\nCause\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of Morgagni–Stewart–Morel is based upon a radiological finding of hyperostosis frontalis interna. Diagnosis considers a combination of clinical features including obesity, virilism, and mental disturbances.\nTreatment\nTreatment is based upon the symptoms, and generally includes medication, diet and lifestyle modification for weight control. Seizures and headaches associated with hyperostosis frontalis interna (HFI) are treated with standard medications.\nReferences\nExternal links"
