She first gained prominence skating with Alexander König.  The duo captured a bronze medal at the 1988 European Figure Skating Championships and then won gold at the German Figure Skating Championships in 1992.  They also competed in the Winter Olympics three times, finishing 7th in 1988, 1992, and again in 1994.\nSchwarz took a break from skating and gave birth to a son, Michel, in 1995.  The following year, she joined forces with Mirko Müller.  The pair went on to win three gold medals at the German nationals from 1998 to 2000.  After competing in the 1998 Winter Olympics, they captured the bronze medal at the World Figure Skating Championships that year.  Schwarz retired from skating in 2000.\nPrograms\nWith Müller\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n! Season\n! Short program\n! Free skating\n!
