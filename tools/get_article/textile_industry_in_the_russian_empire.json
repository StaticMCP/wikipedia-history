It played a significant role in the Industrialization in the Russian Empire.\nIn 1840 the Manchester-based company De Jersey & Co. appointed Franz Holzhauer as their agent in Moscow with Ludwig Knoop as his assistant. At the time Manchester was known as Cottonopolis, and De Jersey and Co. played a major role in developing the cotton industry in the Russian Empire.\nThe first large scale cotton printing and dye works was established in 1753 by two English business men, William Chamberlain and Richard Cozzens with the aid of state subsidies.\nIn 1895 the Russian Technical Society criticized Knoop for holding back the Russian textile industry by exclusively importing English textile machinery.\nReferences"
