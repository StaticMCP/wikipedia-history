It was repackaged as part of The Essential series in 2010, with a three-disc set containing eight additional songs also being released as The Essential 3.0.\nBackground\nThe Queen in Waiting highlights Franklin's jazz and big-band recordings with Columbia before she became famous after she moved to Atlantic Records. Not knowing how to best utilize Franklin's talent, her producers had her record a mixture of jazz, blues, gospel, pop, and soul, and Columbia was criticized for mismanaging Franklin during her tenure with them. Collections such as this one and the more comprehensive Take a Look: Aretha Franklin Complete on Columbia are attempts to bring exposure to Franklin's catalog of early recordings.\nTrack listing\nDisc one\nDisc two\nLimited edition 3.0\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
