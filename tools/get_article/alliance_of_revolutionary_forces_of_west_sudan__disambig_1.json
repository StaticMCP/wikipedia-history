This union will strengthen the solidarity, cohesion and unity of the people of Sudan in general and that of the west in particular. It will further strengthen the position of the armed movements in (peace) negotiations\" currently under way in Abuja in Nigeria.\"\nJEM president and doctor Ibrahim Khalil told reporters, \"We have set up this union in the interests of the people of Darfur. To lose time without uniting our efforts means extending the days of the (Khartoum) regime which has become a factor in the disintegration of the regime.\"\nThe press statement was also signed by SLM leader Minni Arcua Minnawi.\nARFWS and the Government of Chad were united in opposition to Sudan heading the African Union at the summit on 23 January 2006.\nNotes\nSee also\n:Sudanese rebel groups\n*Sudan Liberation Movement\n*Justice and Equality Movement\n*National Movement for Reform and Development\n*Eastern Front (Sudan)\n*Sudan People's Liberation Movement (northern sector)\nExternal links\n*[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/751BE55E-F767-4A11-9405-9ADC2FE63401.htm \"Darfur rebels unite as single group\"] (Reuters) accessed January 20"
