More recently in 1987 and 2003, dating of the same strata has revised and corroborated these dates.\n*30,000 BP – Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity occurred in and around the Sydney basin, as evidenced by an archaeological dig in Parramatta, in Western Sydney. The finds show that the Aboriginal Australians in that region used charcoal, stone tools and possible ancient campfires.\n*21,100–17,800 BP – Stone artifact assemblages dating to this time period discovered in Shaws Creek (near Hawkesbury River) and in Blue Mountains. A rock shelter with flakes dating to this period discovered near Nepean River.\n*5,000–7000 BP – The Sydney rock engravings, a form of Australian Aboriginal rock art consisting of carefully drawn images of people, animals, or symbols, date to this time period.\n*4,000–2,000 BC – The first backed stone artifacts developed, such as blades and spears. The stones would drill, scrape, cut and grind material. They were also associated with woodworking.\n*1,000–500 BC – Bone and shell usage dating to this period discovered. They would've been attached to fishing spear prongs, which would mean that multi-pronged fishing spears occurred at this time. The evidence of spear-throwing is suggested by an excavated shell in Balmoral Beach.\n*c 500 CE – Likely large tsunami.\n18th–19th centuries\n1770s–1790s\n* 1770 – Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook, in command of HMS&nbsp;Endeavour, sights the east coast of Australia and lands at Kurnell.\n* 1779 – Joseph Banks gives evidence supporting a colony in Botany Bay.\n* 1783 – James Matra proposes colony in New South Wales.\n* 1786 – British government decides to found convict settlement in Botany Bay.\n* 1787 – First Fleet of eleven vessels under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip leaves Portsmouth.\n* 1788\n** Phillip arrives in Botany Bay but moves site of settlement to Sydney Cove.\n** French vessels under the command of Lapérouse land in Botany Bay.\n** Parramatta founded.\n** Convict Henry Kable successfully sues ship's master for stealing his goods on voyage.\n** Punitive expedition after killing of two convicts by aboriginal people fails to find any culprits.\n* 1789\n** Smallpox epidemic kills many of indigenous population.\n** Rose Hill Packet built for service on Parramatta River.\n** Six marines hanged for theft from government stores.\n** Farquhar's comedy 'The Recruiting Officer' performed by convicts.\n* 1790\n** Phillip speared by Willemering at Manly Cove.\n** Second Fleet arrives with many deaths and convicts in poor condition.\n** William Dawes creates word-list of Dharug language with the help of Patyegarang.\n** Glebe granted as endowment to Church of England.\n* 1791\n** Successful convict farmer James Ruse granted land at Rosehill.\n** Convict station established at Old Toongabbie.\n** Mary Bryant and other convicts escape by open boat to Timor.\n** Third Fleet arrives with provisions.\n** Third Fleet ship Britannia leaves for whaling expedition in the South Seas.\n** First convicts arrive from Ireland in the Queen.\n, Port Jackson, 1792]]\n* 1792\n** Burial Ground established.\n** Visit of first trading vessels, the Philadelphia and Hope from America.\n** Phillip returns to England, accompanied by Bennelong and Yemmerrawanne.\n* 1793\n** John and Elizabeth Macarthur begin building Elizabeth Farm at Rosehill.\n** Visit of Malaspina's Spanish exploratory expedition.\n** First free settlers arrive on the Bellona.\n** First church built.\n** Watkin Tench's Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson published in London.\n* 1794 – Maurice Margarot and four other radical political prisoners arrive.\n* 1795\n** Bennelong returns from visit to England.\n** Descendants of cattle that had escaped in 1788 found at Cowpastures (Camden).\n** First printing press used to print government orders.\n** Complex legal case Boston v Laycock over shooting of pig by soldier.\n** Initiation ceremony of 15 indigenous youths at Farm Cove.\n* 1796\n** White population: 4,000.\n** Political prisoner Thomas Muir escapes on American ship.\n** Bushranger \"Black Caesar\" shot and killed.\n** First theatre opens.\n* 1797\n** Prospect, a western Sydney suburb, became the boundary between colonists and indigenous Australians.
