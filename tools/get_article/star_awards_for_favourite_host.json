The award was introduced after the discontinuation of the Favourite Onscreen Partners (Variety) award. It was given in honour of a MediaCorp host that is deemed the most popular among the television audience. The nominees were determined by a team of judges employed by MediaCorp; winners were selected by a majority vote from the public via online voting.\nSince its inception, the award was given to only one host. Bryan Wong is the most recent and final winner in this category, for his performance in S.N.A.P. Pornsak and Wong have been nominated on two occasions, more than any other host. Pornsak also holds the record for the most nominations without a win.\nThe award was discontinued from 2014 onwards as the popularity element of the award is already represented in the Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes and Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes awards.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
