Overall, the Conservative Party won 330 seats in the House of Commons while Labour won 288 seats.\nThis was the first general election to be held after the passage of the Representation of the People Act, thereby enabling citizens gain the eligibility to vote from the age of 18 (previously, it was 21).\nResult Table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Party\n!Seats won\n!Net change in seats\n!Total votes\n!Voteshare\n!Change in voteshare\n|-\n|Conservative\n|292\n|73\n|11,282,524\n|48.3%\n|5.6%\n|-\n|Labour\n|216\n|69\n|10,131,555\n|43.4%\n|4.6%\n|-\n|Liberal\n|2\n|4\n|1,853,616\n|7.9%\n|1.1%\n|}\n|57.14}}\n|42.27}}\n|0.39}}}}\nReferences\n# Pilling, Sam; Cracknell, Richard (18 August 2021). \"UK Election Statistics: 1918-2021: A Century of Elections\" (PDF).
