The battle ended with the defeat of the Babylonians.\nBackground\nWhen the Assyrian capital Nineveh was overrun by the Medes, Scythians, Babylonians and their allies in 612 BC, the Assyrians moved their capital to Harran. When Harran was captured by the alliance in 609 BC, ending the Assyrian Empire, remnants of the Assyrian army joined Carchemish, a city under Egyptian rule, on the Euphrates river. Egypt, then under the rule of Necho II, was allied with the Assyrian king Ashur-uballit II, and marched in 609 BC to his aid against the Babylonians.\nBattle\nThe Egyptian army moved in the spring of 606 BC to besiege and occupy Kimuhu. “Nebulaser did not help his besieged army in Kimoho, perhaps for fear that the Babylonian army would perish because of the risk it would take in crossing the Euphrates River and meeting the Egyptian army west of the river.” The city of Kimuhu fell into the hands of the Egyptians after being besieged for a period of four months. In response to this, the Babylonian army encamped in the city of Quramati and in September 606 BC Babylonian forces crossed the river and took control of the city of Chondari, located to the west of the river, but the Egyptian response came quickly with a counterattack, as the Egyptian army crossed the river and occupied the city of Quramati east of the river. The Babylonian army withdrew from the west of the Euphrates fearing that the Egyptian army would besiege them and eliminate them completely.\nReferences"
