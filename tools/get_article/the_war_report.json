The album features the singles \"L.A., L.A.\", \"T.O.N.Y.\", \"Illegal Life\" and \"Closer\". Tragedy Khadafi appears on more than half of the album's songs and served roles as both producer and executive producer. The success of the album managed the group to make a sequel titled The War Report 2: Report the War. The album was originally scheduled to be released on June 15, 2010, almost exactly 13 years after the original, but it was pushed back a month later to July 13, 2010. In 2022, Rolling Stone placed it at number 187 on their list of the 200 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time.\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|#\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Title\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Producer(s)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Featured Artist(s)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Length\n|-\n|1\n|\"Intro\"\n|Charlemagne\n|\n|1:32\n|-\n|2\n|\"Bloody Money\"\n|EZ Elpee\n|\n|4:33\n|-\n|3\n|\"Driver's Seat\"\n|\n|\n|3:40\n|-\n|4\n|\"Stick You\"\n|Naughty Shorts\n|Tragedy Khadafi\n|4:43\n|-\n|5\n|\"Parole Violators\"\n|Havoc\n|\n|2:30\n|-\n|6\n|\"Iraq (See the World)\"\n|EZ Elpee\n|\n|5:33\n|-\n|7\n|\"Live On, Live Long\"\n|Naughty Shorts\n|\n|4:50\n|-\n|8\n|\"Neva Die Alone\"\n|Buckwild\n|Tragedy Khadafi\n|3:23\n|-\n|9\n|\"T.O.N.Y.

He only appears on the last 20 seconds of the song, ad-libbing over the hook.\nThe songs \"Stick You,\" \"Parole Violators,\" \"Halfway Thugs,\" and \"L.A., L.A (Kuwait Mix)\" are partially edited, even though the album was released with an explicit-lyrics sticker.\nSample-clearance issues caused two tracks, \"Married to Marijuana\" and \"Calm Down (Feat. Nas & Tragedy Khadafi),\" to be cut from the retail version of the album. Both songs were originally on the promo version sent out for reviews but were omitted from the retail album when it hit stores. Both became popular mixtape and underground radio tracks and were released as white label 12-inch singles.\nSamples\n*\"Bloody Money\"\n**\"Impeach the President\" by the Honey Drippers\n**\"Philadelphia Morning\" by Bill Conti\n*\"Capone Bone\"\n**\"Step into Our Life\" by Roy Ayers\n**\"Cruisin'\" by D'Angelo\n*\"L.A., L.A.
