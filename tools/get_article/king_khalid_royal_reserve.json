It was a private farm owned by King Khalid and was partially turned into a public park after its nationalization by the Saudi government under King Fahd in 1983 following the former's death in 1982. It was renamed as the King Khalid Royal Reserve in October 2019 after its recognition as a protected area through a royal decree by King Salman.\nHistory\nPrior to its nationalization by the Saudi government in 1983, the park was a private farm owned by the late King Khalid. Following his death in 1982, the newly crowned monarch of Saudi Arabia, King Fahd issued a royal decree for nationalization of the property. The then governor of Riyadh Prince Salman tasked the High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh to transform the farm into a public park. Around 1992, both the Al Thumamah Wildlife Park and the Thumamah National Park projects were merged under the responsibility of High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh. In October 2019, King Salman issued a royal decree which officially declared the area as a natural reserve and was renamed as the King Khalid Royal Reserve.\nSee also\n* Geography of Saudi Arabia\n* Red Sand (Riyadh)\n* Thumamah Airport\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yug_pcxe65I Red Sand Dune – Riyadh, Saudi Arabia] on YouTube"
