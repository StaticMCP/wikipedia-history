It was fought between elements of the South Korean 6th Infantry Division and elements of the Chinese 63rd Corps between May 26 and 30, 1951. The claims of the Korean and U.S. military are different from those of the Chinese military. Paro Lake is a name that arose after this battle. It is said that after the battle, the South Korean army threw numerous corpses of Chinese soldiers into the river.\nBackground\nReferences"
