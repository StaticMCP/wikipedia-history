This meant that only three daytime dramas qualified to earn nominations: Days of Our Lives, General Hospital, and The Young and the Restless. The newest daytime drama, Beyond the Gates, was also disqualified because it premiered on February 24, 2025, after the December 31, 2024, eligibility window deadline.\nCategory changes\n* A new category, Outstanding Emerging Talent in a Daytime Drama Series, honors performers who are in their first two years on their first daytime drama series. Unlike the retired Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series and its gender-specific predecessors, there would be no maximum age limit. However, one who wins it once would be disqualified from winning it a second time.\n* Outstanding Culinary Program was divided into two specific categories: Outstanding Culinary Instructional Series honoring those shows more instructive in food preparation and cooking, and Outstanding Culinary Cultural Series honoring those shows focused more on the cultural aspects of food.\n* Outstanding Travel, Adventure and Nature Program was divided into two specific categories: Outstanding Travel and Adventure Program honoring those shows focused more on travel, and Outstanding Nature and Science Program honoring those shows focused more on the science of the natural world.\n\"In Memoriam\"\nThe annual \"In Memoriam\" segment, was presented by host Lopez. The following individuals were honored during the tribute:\n* Denise Alexander\n* John Aprea\n* Anne Burrell\n* John Capodice\n* Frank Caprio\n* Leslie Charleson\n* Thom Christopher\n* Patricia Crowley\n* Mark Dobies\n* Phil Donahue\n* Bruce French\n* Eileen Fulton\n* Helen Gallagher\n* Ron Hale\n* Wings Hauser\n* Alice Hirson\n* Drake Hogestyn\n* Jim Houghton\n* André Landzaat\n* Ananda Lewis\n* Valerie Mahaffey\n* Peter Marshall\n* Wink Martindale\n* Julian McMahon\n* Joe Marinelli\n* Wayne Northrop\n* Pamela Peters\n* Nicholas Pryor\n* Chris Robinson\n* Tristan Rogers\n* Francisco San Martín\n* Doug Sheehan\n* Richard Simmons\n* Esta TerBlanche\n* Michelle Trachtenberg\n* Chuck Woolery\nNotes\nReferences"
