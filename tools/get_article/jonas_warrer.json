At the 2008 Summer Olympics, they stood to win the gold medal before the final round, but their mast broke shortly before start. The Croatian team lent the Danes their boat, and the Danes went on to finish seventh in the round, which would win them the gold medal.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n| years = (with Sara Petersen)Tokyo 2020\n| after = Incumbent\n}}"
