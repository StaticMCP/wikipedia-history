      "text": "# List of Burger King products\n\nWhen the predecessor of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1953, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, Burger King began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper. The company did not add another permanent hamburger to its menu until the introduction of the Big King sandwich in 1996 in response to McDonald's Big Mac sandwich. The company began experimenting with premium hamburgers, made from higher quality ingredients, in 1978 with the introduction of its Specialty Sandwich product line. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. However, it was not until 2002 when the company began to work on a premium burger in earnest. On the value side, Burger King first started offering sliders to its menu in the mid-1980s and offered them off and on for the next twenty years.\nThe company's first major chicken product, its Original Chicken Sandwich, was also part of the company's 1978 Specialty Sandwich line. Burger King's Chicken Tenders made their debut in a menu revision and expansion in 1985 to address the absence of a chicken fingers product akin to McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. The company began offering the first, nationally available grilled chicken sandwich product when it added the BK Broiler in the early 1990s. That sandwich would go on to be reformulated and renamed several times before settling on the current Grilled sandwich. The chain added a second chicken finger product with the introduction of its BK Chicken Fries product in the mid-2000s. Burger King's Chicken Fries would also be removed and re-added to its menu in response to ownership changes and customer demand.\nThe company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu was another addition that came in with the company's in a 1978 menu expansion. Initially a clone of McDonald's breakfast line, the company began to differentiate itself with the introduction of the Croissan'wich breakfast sandwich in 1982.\nBurgers\nWhopper\nThe Whopper sandwich is a hamburger sold by Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's. Introduced in 1957, it has undergone several reformulations including resizing and bread changes. The name is used in the Home of the Whopper advertising as well as the name of the BK Whopper Bar. The Whopper has prompted Burger King's competitors, mainly McDonald's with at least six different products and Wendy's with its Big Classic, to develop similar products designed to compete with it.\nThe company markets several variants of the burger, such as the Whopper Jr., as well as variants based on regional tastes or customs, such as the teriyaki Whopper in Japan or the LTO Canadian Whopper. With the company's expansion into India, the chain introduced two new variants on the Whopper while reintroducing the chicken version of the sandwich. To accommodate practitioners of Islam and Hinduism, who make up the majority of the Indian population, the chain has eliminated beef and pork from its menu. In their place, a combination of chicken, vegetarian patties and mutton are used in place of beef.\nTo promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time offerings (\"LTO\") on the Whopper such as the \"Windows 7 Whopper\" in Japan as a product tie-in with Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system. The hamburger contained seven stacked beef patties and measured  high, weighed almost , and had more than . It was originally planned to be available for only seven days starting on 22 October 2009. Due to its success in selling 6,000 sandwiches within the first four days, Burger King decided to extend the promotion period an extra nine days, ending on 6 November.\nAs the signature product of the company, it is often at the center of advertising promotions, product tie-ins, and even corporate practical jokes and hoaxes such as its 1998 April Fool's Day prank where Burger King took out a full page advertisement in several national publications, such as USA Today, promoting a new version of the sandwich called the \"Left-Handed Whopper\". The advertisement claimed that the condiments were all rotated 180° to accommodate southpaws. Some of the early twenty-first century advertising programs, particularly in Europe, have drawn criticism for cultural insensitivity or misogyny. One such example was The Texican Whopper, an LTO version of the Whopper sold in Europe and was advertised with an ad that featured a pair of actors dressed as a cowboy and a lucha libre wrestler. The problem arose when the Mexican Ambassador to Spain complained that the commercial featured demeaning stereotypes of Mexicans. Additionally, the print version of the advertisement featured the wrestler wearing a cape that appeared to be a Mexican flag, a violation of Mexican laws governing the usage of its national banner.\nBig King\nThe Big King sandwich is one of Burger King's major hamburger products and has been part of its menu for more than twenty years. During its testing phase in 1996–1997, it was originally called the Double Supreme and was configured similarly to the McDonald's Big Macincluding a three piece roll. It was later reformulated as a more standard double burger during the latter part of product testing in 1997. It was given its current name when the product was formally introduced in September 1997, but maintained the more conventional double cheeseburger format. Its introduction capped a period of sales success for Burger King, where the company successfully took on its rival McDonald's. The product was renamed King Supreme in 2001 when it was slightly reformulated as part of a menu restructuring during a period of corporate decline for the company in which its corporate parent, Diageo, was trying to sell the company. When a TPG Capital-led team of investors took over the company in 2002, the new management team again restructured the menu, eliminating the King Supreme in favor of its new BK Stacker line of sandwiches. The sandwiches were part of a line of controversial sandwiches high in fat and calories which several groups protested. A limited time offering (LTO) sandwich line known as BK Toppers accompanied the Stacker line briefly in 2012, including one sandwich known as the Deluxe topper  a virtual clone of the Big King in its formulation. The Stacker and Topper lines were discontinued in the United States shortly after, and the Big King returned to said market in November 2013 as a permanent product after the company was again sold, this time to 3G Capital of Brazil.\nDespite being off the menu in the United States for several years, the product continued to be sold internationally under several names. The BK XXL line was sold in European markets and was the center of controversy over product health standards and advertising in Spain when first introduced. There is also a chicken variant of the sandwich in the United States and Canada.\nPremium burgers\nAs far back as the 1970s, international fast food restaurant chain Burger King has attempted to introduce a premium line of burgers. These sandwiches are part of a system which eventually became known as the barbell strategy; a plan designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult-oriented fare along with products that are more value-oriented. This program is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent adult audience who will be willing to spend more on the better quality products on one side while maintaining a lower cost value menu dedicated to a more cost-conscious audience on the other. The hope is that the customers would be drawn in initially for the lower prices of the value-menu and upgrade to the more expensive products, upping overall sales.\nThe chain's first major attempt was part of their Specialty Sandwich line that was introduced in 1979 was the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. After the failure of the Specialty Sandwich line, Burger King went on to introduce several other premium burgers made from a variety of meats. One major example introduced in 2002 was the BK Back Porch Griller sandwich line. The sandwich, introduced in May 2002 was a pronounced failure, and pulled in September of that year. The next product Burger King introduced was its Angus Steakburger which it began selling in 2004; it too had lack-luster sales due in part to the patty being par cooked. The sandwich was later reformulated as the Steakhouse Burger which used a thinner, flatter, fresh cooked patty. The Steakhouse Burger sandwich was eventually replaced with the Steakhouse XT/Angus XT burger, which used a new, thicker round patty among several other changes. This newer sandwich was made possible with the introduction of the company's new broiler systems which allowed varying cooking times and temperatures which in turn gave the company the ability to utilize fresh cooked, thicker patties in its sandwiches. Only variations of the sandwich that explicitly state \"Angus\" in the title are manufactured from meat from Angus cattle. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the '''Chef's Choice burger'''. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1. Ultimate Cheeseburger in North America.\nInternationally, the chain has introduced several lines of premium sandwiches. In New Zealand, the chain first introduced the BK Crown Jewels  line which was based upon the Whopper, TenderGrill, and TenderCrisp sandwiches. The line was eventually replaced with the '''BK King's Collection menu of Angus-based sandwiches. It also sold Angus-burgers in Australia, Great Britain and Ireland. In East Asia, the chains sells the Angus XT sandwich which is a variant of the Steakhouse XT. In Great Britain, the chain has also introduced a burger based on lamb and another based on Wagyu beef, while back in the United States it sold a turkey burger sandwich – all of which were limited time offerings (LTOs).\nSliders\nInternational fast-food restaurant chain Burger King has sold a variety of sliders, or mini-sandwiches, since the 1980s. Burger Bundles was the first iteration, a set of three small hamburgers or cheeseburgers. These sandwiches were eventually replaced with a reformulated product called Burger Buddies that was sold in pairs. After a change in management in 2004, Burger Buddies were re-released as BK Burger Shots. The company has also sold several chicken and breakfast sandwich versions of these products.\nBK Stackers\nThe BK Stacker''' sandwiches are a discontinued family of hamburgers featuring the same toppings that targets the late-teen–to–young-adult and male-oriented demographic groups. It is a cheeseburger consisting of anywhere from one to four  grilled beef patties, American cheese, bacon and Stacker sauce served on a sesame seed bun.\nHistory\nThe BK Stacker was first introduced in the summer of 2006. The chain garnered media attention due to the size of the sandwiches, particularly the Quad, and the large amount of calories and fat that the sandwich had (see the Enormous Omelet Sandwich breakfast sandwich.) In a November 2006 menu revision, the Double BK Stacker became a numbered Value meal item in North America, with the number varying by market area.\nThe Stacker line was updated in 2011. The stacker line was moved to the value menu with a reformulated ingredient list by deleting the top layer of cheese. The changed pricing structure created a situation where the distribution of ingredients does not scale at the same rate as increasing numbers of burger patties. Two single Stackers at one dollar included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for two dollars. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker.\nProduct description\nThe BK Stackers are a family of hamburgers, consisting of one to four  hamburger patties, bacon, American cheese and the King Sauce used on the Big King served on a sesame-seed bun.\nAdvertising\nThe BK Stacker was introduced using commercials that employed groups of little people in the roles of members of the \"Stackers Union\". The characters were \"Vin,\" played by Danny Woodburn, \"the new guy,\" and various members of the \"Stackers Union\" construction team that work in a BK kitchen assembling the sandwiches. The tag line was \"Meat, Cheese and Bacon- Stacked High\". As exemplified in the advertising campaign, part of the sandwich's concept revolves around not having vegetables like lettuce, onions, or tomatoes.\nBK Toppers\n| fat = 27 g\n| satfat = 9 g\n| transfat = 1 g\n| opt2n = Cholesterol\n| opt2v = 55 mg\n| sodium_mg = 850\n| carbs = 27 g\n| sugars = 4 g\n| protein = 16 g\n| fibre = 1 g\n| source = [https://web.archive.org/web/20101226220824/http://www.bk.com/cms/en/us/cms_out/digital_assets/files/pages/NutritionInformation.pdf www.BK.com (PDF)]\n| note = May vary outside US market.\n}}\nThe BK Toppers line was a line of cheeseburgers introduced in October 2011 as limited time offer. The sandwiches featured a new  chopped beef patty that features a coarser grind than the company's  hamburger patty. The four sandwiches in the line were the Cheeseburger Deluxe, Mushroom and Swiss, Bacon and Cheddar, and Western BBQ. The sandwiches were a part of the new ownership's plans to expand its customer base beyond the 18- to 34-year-old demographic which it had been targeting over the previous several years. The product resurrected a previous name from the BK Hot Toppers line of sandwiches from the 1980s. They were removed from the menu in July 2012.\nAdvertising\nThe company used its advertising firm of McGarryBowen and a food-centric campaign to introduce the products. The ads feature the tag line of More beef, more value, with the television commercials utilizing images of the ingredients of the sandwiches as they are being prepared.\nRodeo sandwiches\n{|style=\"float:left; padding-right:1em;\"\n|-\n|\n| fat = 19 g\n| satfat = 8 g\n| transfat = 1.5 g\n| opt2n = Cholesterol\n| opt2v = 30 mg\n| sodium_mg = 630\n| carbs = 40 g\n| fiber = 2 g\n| sugars = 9 g\n| protein = 17 g\n| vitA_ug = 35\n| vitC_mg = 0\n| vitE_mg =\n| iron_mg = 1.9\n| source = [https://web.archive.org/web/20101226220824/http://www.bk.com/cms/en/us/cms_out/digital_assets/files/pages/NutritionInformation.pdf www.BK.com (PDF)]\n| note =\n}}\n|-\n|}\nThe Rodeo sandwiches are a line of similarly topped sandwiches targeting the value conscious demographic. They are topped with three onion rings and barbecue sauce served on a small sesame-seed bun, and can be made as a hamburger, cheeseburger or chicken sandwich.\nHistory\nThe Rodeo Cheeseburger was created to coincide with the release of the film Small Soldiers in 1998. It originally was available as just a cheeseburger topped with Bull's Eye brand barbecue sauce and onion rings.\nThe Rodeo Cheeseburger was nationally discontinued in the U.S., but it was regionally available in some locations as part of Burger King's value menu. In 2007, BK switched its barbecue sauce from Bulls-Eye to Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce.\nIn 2013, the Rodeo Burger was reintroduced in the U.S. as a new line of value sandwiches with a US$1.00 price. The new base level sandwich removed the cheese from the burger and introduced chicken version of the sandwich. The cheeseburger version was still available, but with an additional cost of up to 50¢.\nProduct description\nThe Rodeo burger is a hamburger, consisting of a  beef patty, barbecue sauce and onion rings on a sesame-seed bun. A cheeseburger variant adds a slice of American cheese, while the chicken variant swaps the beef patty out with a  fried chicken patty and extra serving of barbecue sauce.\nAdvertising\nThe Rodeo cheeseburger was advertised using a parody of the Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson film A Few Good Men. In the commercial, Chip Hazard quoted Jack Nicholson's line \"you can't handle the truth\" as \"you can't handle the Rodeo Burger.\"\nPoultry and fish\nSpecialty Sandwiches\nThe Burger King Specialty Sandwiches are a line of sandwiches developed by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in 1978 and introduced in 1979 as part of a new product line designed to expand Burger King's menu with more sophisticated, adult oriented fare beyond hamburgers. Additionally, the new line was intended to differentiate the company from other fast food hamburger restaurants at the time. Since the line's introduction, the other sandwiches have been discontinued, leaving the chicken offering, the Original Chicken Sandwich (abbreviated as OCS), as the primary product left. Additionally, other sandwiches that utilize the same roll as the chicken sandwich have been introduced to the company's menu both domestically and internationally since the original product line was introduced.\nBurger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several different names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken and Chicken Royale in the international markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork.\nGrilled chicken sandwiches\nBurger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have introduced a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches to its products portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, and was one of the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24-36 adult males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.\nThe company sells slightly different versions of the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others.\nThe Chicken Baguette line was intended as a new health conscious oriented product that got its taste from ingredients instead of fat. The sandwiches failed to catch on in the American market, and as a result they were discontinued as part of a menu reorganization. In 2005, they were replaced by the TenderGrill sandwich. While the TenderGrill is the standard offering in its home market, some of its international markets still utilize the older Chicken Whopper name for the product. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced  by its former ownership group as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24-36 adult males.-->\nFish Sandwiches\nBurger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of fish sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1975. The Whaler sandwich was the first iteration, designed to compete with rival burger-chain McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich. In the U.S. the Whaler was first offered years earlier in some U.S. markets: Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania in 1969, and Indiana in 1970. With the addition of the company's Specialty Sandwich line in 1978, the sandwich was reformulated as the Long Fish sandwich. With the discontinuation of the Specialty Sandwich line, the sandwich was returned to its original recipe and name. With the introduction of the company's BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990, the fish sandwich became tied to the development cycle of the broiled chicken sandwich and was again reformulated and renamed as the Ocean Catch Fish fillet. When the broiled chicken sandwich underwent another reformulation in 2002, the fish sandwich was also redone and renamed as the BK Big Fish sandwich. By 2015, the sandwich had undergone several more modifications and went through a series of names including the BK Fish and Premium Alaskan fish sandwich. It is currently sold as the BK Big Fish sandwich in the United States and Canada. Internationally the fish sandwich is also known as the BK Fish, '''BK Fish'n Crisp burger and Fish Royale''' in those markets.\nThe company markets very few variants of the fish sandwiches, but it does offer localized versions that are specifically tailored to meet taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. Usually during the Christian religious period known as Lent, Burger King releases limited-time (LTO) variants on the sandwich that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. While the sandwich itself never has never been at the center of controversy, the sourcing of fish from Icelandic suppliers led to a call for a boycott of Burger King because of Iceland's participation in whaling – despite a 1982 international moratorium on the practice.\nBK Chicken Fries\nBK Chicken Fries are a fried chicken product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. At the time of their introduction in 2005, the company had intended Chicken Fries to be one of their larger, adult oriented products made with higher quality ingredients than their standard menu items. Additionally, the product further targeted the snacking and convenience food markets with a specific packaging design that was intended to be easier to handle and fit into automotive cup holders. The product was part of a series of product introductions designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old adult males. Along with this series of larger, more complex group of menu products, the company intended to attract a larger, more affluent adult audience who would be willing to spend more on the better quality products. They were discontinued in the United States in 2012, but continued to be sold in some markets, such as Italy. In August 2014, they were reintroduced for a limited time offering (LTO) in North America, leading to their permanent re-addition to the menu in March 2015 in over 30 countries globally.\nAs one of the company's major offerings, the chicken fries are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the Nu Metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product been a prominent part of the menu for the better part of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product – its first one being released in the summer of 2015. A kids' meal option was available one time in the United States which has included a six-piece order. The 2014 reissue is only available for a nine-piece order.\nChicken Tenders\nThe Burger King chicken nuggets were introduced in 1985 to compete with McDonald's Chicken McNuggets.  Originally made with sliced fillets of chicken, the product was replaced with a formed, chopped-chicken product several years later.\nTurkey burger\n| fat = 26 g\n| satfat = 5 g\n| transfat = 0 g\n| opt2n = Cholesterol\n| opt2v = 90 mg\n| sodium_mg = 1210\n| carbs = 46 g\n| fiber = 2 g\n| sugars = 11 g\n| protein = 27 g\n| vitA_ug =\n| vitC_mg =\n| vitE_mg =\n| iron_mg =\n| source = [http://www.bk.com/cms/en/us/cms_out/digital_assets/files/pages/NutritionInformation.pdf www.BK.com (PDF)]\n| note =\n}}\nThe turkey burger was introduced in 2013 as part of a spring-time limited time offering promotion called Festival of Burgers. The new sandwich was part of a series of new, updated or modified sandwiches and along with a revamped veggie burger, as a newer more healthier offering than its beef-based burgers. With the introduction of the sandwich, the chain became the largest restaurant chain to offer a turkey burger as part of its menu. Despite being declared a healthier option, the sandwich still weighed in at  and 25% of a person's daily nutritional intake by the USDA standards. Despite its size, the sandwich was one of the chain's more healthful options, approximately 50 calories more than its TenderGrill chicken sandwich giving the chain three lower-calorie non-burger options.\nThe new burger was part of a second wave of menu restructuring that included a stuffed bacon and cheddar burger, variations on the Whopper and a new coffee line that was co-branded with Seattle's Best Coffee.\nThe chain also moved its advertising account from McGarryBowen to new agency of record Mother in February. The agency, who had already been working with the chain for several months as a secondary ad firm, introduced a new \"people-centric\" advertising program for the new sandwich line-up.\nChicken burger\n| fat          = 26 g\n| satfat       = 5 g\n| transfat     = 0 g\n| opt2n        = Cholesterol\n| opt2v        = 90 mg\n| sodium_mg    = 1210\n| carbs        = 46 g\n| fiber        = 2 g\n| sugars       = 11 g\n| protein      = 27 g\n| source = [http://www.bk.com/cms/en/us/cms_out/digital_assets/files/pages/NutritionInformation.pdf www.BK.com (PDF)]\n| note =\n}}\nThe Chicken Burger was introduced in 2016 in the United States and Canada, and is Burger King's second foray into a non-beef hamburger in North America.\nChicken Jr.\n{|style=\"float:left; padding-right:.5em;\"\n|-\n|\n|-\n|}\nThe Chicken Jr. is a small fried chicken sandwich that consists of a chicken patty, lettuce and mayonnaise served on a sesame seed bun. It is one of the company's value oriented products. Originally introduced in the late 1990s as the '''Chick'n Crisp''' sandwich, the name was changed in 2013. The company has released several variants on the original sandwich.\nHistory\nThe sandwich was introduced in 1998 as part of a menu expansion that added a value menu which the company dubbed the Great Tastes Menu. Originally the sandwich was made with a  chicken patty, mayonnaise, pickle on a sesame-seed roll. A parmigiana style sandwich with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce called the Italian Crispy chicken sandwich was added later. The sandwich was eliminated in the US in 2000 but revived in 2007 as the Spicy Chick'n Crisp sandwich. In March 2012 the company reformulated the sandwich to the original patty and changed the spicy version to include a spicy mayo instead. The name was changed in 2013 to the Crispy Chicken Jr. and a new version called the Rodeo Crispy Chicken was added 2014.\nVegetarian\nBK Veggie\nThe BK Veggie is a vegetarian meatless sandwich that is served at Burger King restaurants. The sandwich is not vegan, as it has dairy components, and is one of BK's health conscious oriented menu items. The BK Veggie is made with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and onions, and is served on a sesame-seed bun. The patty is supplied by Morningstar Farms. In Canada, the sandwich is prepared without mayo, while the patty is flame-broiled instead of being microwaved.\nHistory\nThe product was first introduced in 1995, shortly before the company's acquisition by TPG Capital, as part of a menu expansion that included a revamped King Supreme and other products designed to better compete with a similar planned menu expansion at McDonald's early the next year. It was originally prepared in the same manner as a Whopper, a flame-broiled veggie patty with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion and ketchup served on a sesame-seed roll. However, unlike the Whopper, which features regular mayonnaise, a separate low-fat mayonnaise was utilized. Currently, the BK Veggie is prepared with regular mayonnaise. At the time the sandwich was vegan if the customer asked to have it cooked in a microwave oven, otherwise it was not considered vegan because it was cooked on the same equipment as the burgers and chicken. At the time of its introduction, the sandwich was hailed by many as a way to not only give vegetarians more options, but as a healthy alternative that gave all consumers more choices in meal options. The Center for Science in the Public Interest lauded the sandwich's low fat content, but derided the company's other menu items introduced at the time  as being unhealthy. In 2005, CSPI observed, \"too bad you can’t order it with less than 930 mg of sodium,\" which, while an increase from the 760 or 730&nbsp;mg in the sandwich in 2002, was still less than the 1100&nbsp;mg in the sandwich today [June 2010].\nIn late 2004, BK (US) entered into a partnership with Kellogg's Morningstar Farms division to offer a soy-based meatless patty. The sandwich was reformulated not to include pickles and onions, and in order to address concerns raised by vegetarian groups, the cooking method was also changed to microwaving to prevent cross-contamination with meat products. The Impossible Whopper was introduced in 2019; this one may have cross-contamination if the customer does not request for it to be cooked separately from other burgers.\nClassification\nIn UK outlets of Burger King, the BK Veggie was approved by the Vegetarian Society. Subsequently, on the menu boards, a 'Vege society approved' logo was shown next to the item name. The UK burger is also vegan when ordered without mayonnaise or cheese. In the US the sandwich was approved by PETA, who not only welcomed the BK Veggie as a way to give vegetarians more choice, but also hailed the company's recent agreement with the group to seek out suppliers that employ humane treatment methods in raising their animal stock.\nHowever, Burger King in the US publishes a disclaimer which states: \"Burger King Corporation makes no claim that the BK Veggie Burger or any other of its products meets the requirements of a vegan or vegetarian diet. The patty is cooked in the microwave.\"\nAdvertising\nThe use of a corporate cross-promotion helped drive sales by giving the Morningstar Farms brand increased exposure and sales opportunities, while Burger King promotes an existing, trusted brand name which aids marketing efforts and encourages consumers to try the BK Veggie.\nSpicy bean burger\n{|style=\"float:left; padding-right:.5em;\"\n|-\n|\n|-\n|}\nThe Spicy Bean Burger is a fried sandwich sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King in parts of the European and Asian markets. It does not contain any meat but may be fried in the same oil as the fish products.\nProduct description\nThe Spicy Bean Burger consists of a deep-fried, breaded bean-based patty, with ketchup, tomato, and American cheese on a 7-inch (20&nbsp;cm) long sesame seed bun.\nImpossible Whopper\nThe Impossible Whopper is a 100% vegetarian burger with a patty manufactured by Impossible Foods of Oakland, California. Burger King began test marketing the Impossible Whopper in April 2019 at locations in and around St. Louis, Missouri. It was accompanied with an April Fools-themed promotional video on April 1, 2019. Later that month, the company announced plans to roll out Impossible Whoppers nationwide before the end of the year. In August, it was made available nationwide.\nRebel Whopper and Plant-Based Whopper\nOutside the United States, Burger King has other veggie variants of the Whopper including the Rebel Whopper, the Plant-Based Whopper, the Veggie Whopper and the Vegetal Whopper.\nMac n' Cheetos\nThe '''Mac n' Cheetos''' is a deep-fried cheese-flavored, puffed cornmeal and macaroni and cheese product sold by the international fast food chain store Burger King. Mac n' Cheetos is the combination of both macaroni and cheese and the Frito Lay snack Cheetos. Mac n' Cheetos was first introduced June 27, 2016.\nOther\nBreakfast sandwiches\nInternational fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have had a variety of breakfast sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1978. The '''Croissan'wich''' was the first major breakfast sandwich product introduced by the company.\nThe company sells slightly different versions of breakfast sandwich between international markets, using local breakfast traditions and tastes to cater to those regions.\nYumbo\nYumbo is a ham and cheese sandwich originally introduced by Burger King in 1968 and continued on the menu until 1974. In December 2014, it was announced that the sandwich would return to the menu for a limited time starting December 2 with 1970s themed advertising. The Yumbo is a hot ham and cheese  made with Black Forest ham, American cheese, mayonnaise and lettuce on the sub roll used for the Original Chicken Sandwich. This differs from the original sandwich that was served on a hamburger roll with no toppings.\nHot dogs\nIn February 2016, Burger King introduced hot dogs in the US. The hot dogs were marketed under the name \"Grilled Dogs\", were made from 100% beef and came in two varieties— Chili Cheese Dogs and Classic. They were originally permanent, full time menu items when introduced but were discontinued in 2017 due to poor sales and negative feedback.\nThe training videos for the product quickly became an Internet meme  when it was revealed that they were hosted by Snoop Dogg and Charo. The videos were quickly leaked to YouTube, and received media attention.\nHot dogs were also sold in Canada as well.\nSummer 2010 Ribs LTO\nIn the summer of 2010, Burger King took the unusual step of adding St. Louis-style pork ribs to its summer-time menu. The ribs, 3\" long, bone-in ribs, sold for about $8 order and were extremely successful. The company were sold out of the ribs just over eight weeks into the ten-week run. The company began running out of its packaging halfway into the promotion.\nThe company's new broiling units were one of the key pieces in the success of the product; the new flexible batch broilers were able to be cook the ribs in a relatively short period.\nThe advertising campaign was produced by Crispin, Porter + Boguski and featured flying pigs convincing customers that a fast food restaurant could in fact produce good barbecue ribs at a reasonable price.\nSummer BBQ LTO programs\nThe summer of 2012 saw the introduction of series of limited-time, summer-oriented products. Included in the new menu were a pulled pork sandwich and variations on its Whopper and TenderCrisp chicken sandwiches; each of these new products are based on regional barbecue styles from Tennessee, the Carolinas and Texas. Rounding out the products are an ice cream sundae topped with bacon, sweet potato fries, and frozen lemonade. The products are part of Burger King's ownership group plans to reverse sagging sales and diminished market share. Additionally, the new products were designed to ward off increased competition across the fast food burger restaurant industry from chains such as Five Guys and Smashburger.\nThe Summertime BBQ menu returned in 2013, with the pulled pork sandwich, the Carolina BBQ sandwiches variants be continued. In place of the Texas BBQ sandwich variants  and bacon sundae was a new BBQ rib sandwich and a series of desserts and milkshakes based on Oreo cookie products from Mondelēz International.\nCheetos Chicken Fries\nOn September 14, 2016, Burger King Cheetos Chicken Fries became available at participating restaurants.\nWhopperito\nThe Whopperito is a discontinued Burger King menu item that was introduced in 2016. It consists of most of the ingredients of the Whopper  wrapped inside a tortilla. Instead of the ketchup, mayonnaise, or mustard, the Whopperito contains queso sauce. Burger King originally introduced it only at several of their Pennsylvania locations in June; on August 15, they began selling it nationwide. Leslie Patton of Bloomberg News speculated that the Whopperito represented an attempt by Burger King to compete with Chipotle Mexican Grill.\nSalads\nBurger King first carried salads as early as 2003.\nThey are available in Europe, the United States, Canada, and Malaysia.\nKids' meals\nFirst introduced in 1988, these are kids meals that come with toys from licenses such as Nintendo, Pokémon, Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Disney, Nickelodeon, among others.\nThey were advertised at first with Burger King Kingdom characters since their introduction in 1976, but were phased out in 1989.\nIn 2024, these were renamed as King Jr. meals.\nSee also\n* List of McDonald's products\n* Burger King products\nReferences"
