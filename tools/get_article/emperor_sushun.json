He was the twelfth son of Emperor Kinmei. His mother was , a daughter of Soga no Iname, who was the chief, or Ōomi, of the Soga clan.\nHe succeeded his half-brother, Emperor Yōmei in 587, and lived in the Kurahashi Palace (Kurahashi no Miya) in Yamato.\n* 587:  In the , the Emperor died, and despite a dispute over who should follow him as sovereign, the succession was received by another son of Emperor Kinmei, one of Yōmei's younger brothers.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Sushun is said to have acceded to the throne.\nSushun's contemporary title would not have been tennō, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". Alternatively, Sushun might have been referred to as  or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\nHe came to the throne with the support of the Soga clan and Empress Suiko, his half sister and the widow of Emperor Bidatsu. Initially, the Mononobe clan, a rival clan of the Sogas, allied with , another son of Kimmei, and attempted to have him installed as Emperor. At the Battle of Shigisan, Soga no Umako, who succeeded his father as Ōomi of the Soga clan, eventually killed Mononobe no Moriya, the head of the Mononobe clan, which led to its decline. Umako then installed Emperor Sushun on the throne.\nAs time went on, Sushun eventually became resentful of Umako's power, and wanted him deposed. It is said that one day, he killed a wild boar and stated, \"As I have slain this boar, so would I slay the one I despise\". This angered Soga no Umako and, perhaps out of fear of being struck first, Umako hired  to assassinate Sushun in 592.\nEmperor Sushun's reign lasted for five years before his death at the age of 72.\nThe actual site of Sushun's grave is known. The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Yōmei's mausoleum. It is formally named Kurahashi no oka no e no misasagi.\nGenealogy\nSushun had two consorts and three Imperial children.\n*Consort (Hi) : , Otomo-no-Nukateko's daughter\n**Third Son:\n**\n*Beauty (Hin) : |河上娘|extra=575-618}}, Soga no Umako's daughter\n*Mother Unknown\n**, older brother of Prince Hachiko, Nakahara clan's ancestor\n*Concubine: , Mononobe no Moriya's younger sister\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\nNotes\nReferences\n* Aston, William George.
