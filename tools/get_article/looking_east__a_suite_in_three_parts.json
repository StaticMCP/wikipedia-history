The album documents a concert performance organized by the Boston Creative Music Alliance in 1999.\nReception\n| rev2 = The Penguin Guide to Jazz\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nIn his review for AllMusic, Eugene Chadbourne states \"Trumpeter Malik leads his quartet through an extended composition in a half-dozen sections, exhibiting superb timing, a sense of drama, and impeccable taste in his associates.\"\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz notes \"Malik is in top form, but Mateen tends to go off at half-cock, and very abrasive half-cock at that, which just encourages Moffet to go mad.\"\nThe All About Jazz review by John Sharpe says \"Malik is a powerful player with a bright brassy sound deployed in darting, fizzing lines and heraldic fanfares.\"\nIn his review for JazzTimes Aaron Steinberg notes \"Malik leaves the greatest print on the music. His brash, wide-stroke trumpet sound is highlighter-tip thick compared to most ball-point trumpet blurts, and his contributions range from fluttering strings of high notes to swaggering low notes, or fragments of boppish lines delivered with confidence and kick.\"\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Raphe Malik.\nDisc One\n# \"Zero Grade\" – 11:18\n# \"Fractals\" – 11:54\n# \"The Old Your Majesty\" – 13:56\n# \"The New Majesty\" – 21:11\nDisc Two\n# \"Reversal\" – 13:38\n# \"Smooth Moffetting\" – 18:58\n# \"Cosmic G\" – 14:12\nPersonnel\n*Raphe Malik – trumpet\n*Sabir Mateen – tenor sax, alto sax, flute, b-flat clarinet, alto clarinet\n*Larry Roland – bass\n*Codaryl \"Cody\" Moffett - drums\nReferences"
