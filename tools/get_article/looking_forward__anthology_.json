The anthology was particularly poorly received, and carried the unusually high cover price, for its day, of $5.00. Its contents include one of the few uncollected and otherwise unanthologized stories by Walter M. Miller, Jr.\nContents\n* \"Science Fiction Comes of Age\", Milton Lesser\n* \"The Man from Outside\", Jack Williamson (Astounding 1951)\n* \"We Kill People\", Lewis Padgett (Astounding 1946)\n* \"Win the World\", Chad Oliver (Startling Stories 1952)\n* \"The Little Creeps\", Walter M.

Francis McComas described the volume as \"exorbitantly priced,\" found Lesser's introduction \"irritating\" and \"meaningless,\" noted that the stories were either already available (\"in better books\") or among their authors' \"feebler works,\" and concluded that Looking Forward was a book \"whose over-all merit is dubious indeed.\" Hartford Courant reviewer R. W. Wallace declared that most of the stories \"run to boiled beef rather than grilled tenderloin. . . . not what you'd pick if you wanted to tempt the appetite of a guest.\" P. Schuyler Miller more charitably noted the volume's price and declared it was \"not bad.\"\nReferences"
