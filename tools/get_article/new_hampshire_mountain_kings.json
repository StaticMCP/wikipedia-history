The Mountain Kings play their home games in the Tri-Town Ice Arena in Hooksett, New Hampshire.\nHistory\nIn 2023, after a group of local investors purchased the Tri-Town Ice Arena, the NAHL announced that they had accepted the New Hampshire Mountain Kings as a new expansion franchise. About a month later, the team selected Cam Robichaud to be their first head coach. The new bench boss quickly set about putting a team together and getting them ready for the inaugural game on September 13, 2023.\nThe Mountain Kings also have an affiliate team that plays in the NA3HL (Tier-III) called the New Hampshire Jr. Mountain Kings.\nSeason-by-season records\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
