He is the author of Scorched Earth, a hardcover collection of his artwork. He has been featured in a number of galleries on the East and West coast including Art At Large in New York City. Recently, his work won a page spread in Direct Art Magazine.\nStyle\nThe Pyropainter gets his name from his method of creating art. First, he starts a controlled fire and takes pictures of the blaze, exploring the complex formations and capturing the natural movements of the flames on his digital camera. Next, he manipulates these images into a rough composition; making use of the organic essence of the fire to create a visually compelling foundation for the painting. After the base is completed, he brings the rough images to life by creating details with acrylics. His influences include H.R.Giger, Salvador Dalí, Francis Bacon, and Syd Mead.\nCareer\n*Halloween Exhibit, Los Angeles, CA [https://web.archive.org/web/20110423193845/http://www.barsinister.net/home.php Bar Sinister]\n*Day of the Dead Art shows in Santa Ana, CA [http://www.nightgalleryceramics.com/ Night Gallery]\n*Art At Large, New York, NY, Summer 2006\n*Revelations, Las Vegas, NV, Summer 2007\n*“Migraine” - Poster deal with Starmakers Rising, sold in [http://www.spencersonline.com/ Spencer’s] in the U.S and Canada\n*Scorched Earth - self-published collection of illustrations\n*Wild fire animated movie pre-production\n*pyro painter canvas wall art available through Art 2013\nBiography\nMichael Stewart was born on May 2, 1979, at Albert Einstein Hospital in Philadelphia.\nIn 2001 Michael moved to Hollywood with the hope of obtaining a record deal.\nHe studied under Maya Gohill, who helped him expand his use of different mediums and break free from traditional techniques. At the same time, he became the Front Page Designer at Valley Press. In 2002, his garage band, control freak, signed a record deal with No Exit Records. Michael was ultimately dissatisfied by the one album they put out, which prompted him to focus his attention back on painting.\nWith a revived curiosity in the artistic quality of fire, Michael created digital compositions from the photos of the bonfires and forest fires and then painted over top of the prints to give more definition and depth to the print. He then took these paintings to Bar Sinister who agreed to display them on Halloween night of 2004. This was the springboard for Michael’s artwork being showcased around the L.A. area. Soon his art was in Night Gallery in Santa Anna; a gallery famous for Gothic work, which also\nfeatured successful artists like  Toxic Tunes and Jhonen Vasquez. Being featured at Night Gallery started a chain reaction of a number of art shows in California. He was then invited to H.R. Gigers’ official New York gallery Art at Large, a prestigious underground NYC show in June 2006. Here he met Pat Sylvia and Leslie Barany among many others. After a three-year\nwhirlwind of bar room exhibits, Michael was beginning to crave a change of scenery.\nThe Sin City Invasion\nLas Vegas, Nevada.
