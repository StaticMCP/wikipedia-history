This was also the first battle fought by Guru Gobind Singh.\nBackground and Battle\nBhim Chand, the ruler of Kahlur did not like the large Sikh gatherings and war-like activities near his capital. He also did not like how Guru Gobind had done many ceremonies which were symbols of sovereignty. The raja objected to this practice. The Guru ignored this and continued his activities. This led to the Battle of Anandpur in 1682. Bhim Chand demanded elephants and tents as a loan and with the obvious intention of not repaying the loan. The Guru knowing his intention declined to give the loan. This caused Bhim Chand to lead an attack on Anandpur. Guru Gobind Rai was only 16 years of age at the time. Bhim Chand and his men were defeated by the Sikhs.\nAftermath\nRelations between the Guru and Bhim Chand of Kahlur remained tense. Frequent skirmishes occurred after the Battle. Therefore, he planned with the Rajas of Kangra and Guler to launch another campaign against the Guru. They attacked Anandpur in the early 1685 but were repulsed.\nSee also\n* Nihang\n* Martyrdom and Sikhism\nReferences"
