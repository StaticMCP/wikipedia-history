Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nAlthough traditionally a Republican state, 1996 would mark the second presidential election in a row that New Hampshire was won by Democrat Bill Clinton, by then the incumbent president. Clinton took 49.32% of the popular vote over Republican challenger Bob Dole, who took 39.37%, a victory margin of 9.95%. Reform Party candidate Ross Perot finished in third, with 9.69% of the popular vote.\nClinton's nearly 10-point victory in New Hampshire was much more convincing than his previous win in the state in 1992; that year he had only eked out a narrow plurality of 39% over George H. W. Bush's 38%, with Ross Perot taking nearly 23% of the vote. For a state that had voted over 60% Republican as recently as 1988, Clinton's victories represented a dramatic shift toward the Democratic Party in New Hampshire. Since then the state has voted Democratic in every presidential election, except in 2000, when George W. Bush eked out a narrow plurality win over Al Gore.\nPrimaries\nThe New Hampshire Secretary of State set the primary for February 20, 1996, in accordance with state law requiring the primary to be held at least one week before another state's primary. However, Delaware held its primary in February 24, but New Hampshire declined to alter its date. Most of the major Republican presidential candidates and President Bill Clinton did not appear on the Delaware ballot.\nSteve Forbes spent $3 million in New Hampshire.\n74% of registered Republicans and 45% of registered Democrats participated in the primaries. 45 candidates filed to appear on the primary ballot.\nPat Buchanan and Clinton won the Republican and Democratic presidential primaries. Harry Browne won the Libertarian presidential primary against Irwin Schiff and write-in candidates.\nColin Powell, who was not a candidate, won the Republican vice-presidential primary as a write-in. Al Gore won the Democratic vice-presidential primary. Schiff won the vice-presidential primary as a write-in.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1996 United States presidential election in New Hampshire\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Bill Clinton (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 246,214\n| align=\"right\" | 49.32%\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| Bob Dole\n| align=\"right\" | 196,532\n| align=\"right\" | 39.37%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#53868B; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Reform\n| Ross Perot\n| align=\"right\" | 48,390\n| align=\"right\" | 9.69%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FFD700; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Libertarian\n| Harry Browne\n| align=\"right\" | 4,237\n| align=\"right\" | 0.85%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | N/A\n| Write-ins\n| align=\"right\" | 2,456\n| align=\"right\" | 0.49%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#D2B48C; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | NH Taxpayer\n| Howard Phillips (write-in)\n| align=\"right\" | 1,346\n| align=\"right\" | 0.27%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 499,175\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|}\nResults by county\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |Bill ClintonDemocratic\n! colspan=\"2\" |Bob DoleRepublican\n! colspan=\"2\" |Ross PerotReform\n! colspan=\"2\" |Harry BrowneLibertarian\n! colspan=\"2\" |Various candidatesOther parties\n! colspan=\"2\" |Margin\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total votes cast\n|- bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| #\n! data-sort-type=\"number\"| %\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Belknap\n|  | 10,345\n|  | 43.81%\n| | 10,685\n| | 45.24%\n| |2,297\n| |9.73%\n|  | 153\n|  | 0.65%\n| |136\n| |0.58%\n| | -340\n| | -1.43%\n| | 23,616\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Carroll\n|  | 8,881\n|  | 42.77%\n| | 9,168\n| | 44.16%\n| |2,445\n| |11.78%\n|  | 131\n|  | 0.63%\n| |138\n| |0.66%\n| | -287\n| | -1.39%\n| | 20,763\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Cheshire\n|  | 16,159\n|  | 54.41%\n| | 10,252\n| | 34.52%\n| |2,777\n| |9.35%\n|  | 199\n|  | 0.67%\n| |314\n| |1.06%\n| | 5,907\n| | 19.89%\n| | 29,701\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Coös\n|  | 7,191\n|  | 50.87%\n| | 4,703\n| | 33.27%\n| |2,085\n| |14.75%\n|  | 83\n|  | 0.59%\n| |75\n| |0.53%\n| | 2,488\n| | 17.60%\n| | 14,137\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Grafton\n|  | 19,496\n|  | 52.99%\n| | 13,543\n| | 36.81%\n| |3,237\n| |8.80%\n|  | 244\n|  | 0.66%\n| |272\n| |0.74%\n| | 5,953\n| | 16.18%\n| | 36,792\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Hillsborough\n|  | 71,282\n|  | 48.61%\n| | 59,441\n| | 40.54%\n| |13,411\n| |9.15%\n|  | 1,374\n|  | 0.94%\n| |1,127\n| |0.77%\n| | 11,841\n| | 8.07%\n| | 146,635\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Merrimack\n|  | 29,381\n|  | 52.28%\n| | 21,231\n| | 37.78%\n| |4,814\n| |8.57%\n|  | 428\n|  | 0.76%\n| |346\n| |0.62%\n| | 8,150\n| | 14.50%\n| | 56,200\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Rockingham\n|  | 53,644\n|  | 47.37%\n| | 46,201\n| | 40.80%\n| |11,433\n| |10.10%\n|  | 1,121\n|  | 0.99%\n| |849\n| |0.75%\n| | 7,443\n| | 6.57%\n| | 113,248\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Strafford\n|  | 23,475\n|  | 54.79%\n| | 14,484\n| | 33.81%\n| |4,088\n| |9.54%\n|  | 397\n|  | 0.93%\n| |399\n| |0.93%\n| | 8,991\n| | 20.98%\n| | 42,843\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| | Sullivan\n|  | 8,380\n|  | 48.55%\n| | 6,824\n| | 39.54%\n| |1,803\n| |10.45%\n|  | 107\n|  | 0.62%\n| |146\n| |0.85%\n| | 1,556\n| | 9.01%\n| | 17,260\n|-\n!Totals!!246,214!!49.32%!!196,532!!39.37%!!48,390!!9.69%!!4,237!!0.85%!!3,802!!0.76%!!49,682!!9.95%!!499,175\n|}\nCounties flipped from Republican to Democratic\n* Hillsborough\n* Rockingham\nSee also\n* Presidency of Bill Clinton\n* United States presidential elections in New Hampshire\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*"
