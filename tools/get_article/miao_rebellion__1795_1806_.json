It was catalyzed by tensions between local populations and Han Chinese immigrants. Bloodily suppressed, it served as the antecedent to the much larger uprising of Miao Rebellion (1854–73).\nThe term \"Miao\", as the anthropologist Norma Diamond explains, does not mean only the antecedents of today's Miao national minority; it is a term, which had been used by the Chinese to describe various indigenous, mountain tribes of Guizhou and other south-western provinces of China, which shared similar cultural traits. They consisted of 40–60% population of the province.\nBackground and causes\nThe Qing dynasty used tyranny rather than forced assimilation towards their non-Chinese inhabitants. In the south-west, since the 15th century, the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi and Sichuan were ruled through semi-independent local chieftains, called tusi, upon whom the emperor bestowed titles, demanding only taxes and peace in their territories.\nHowever, Han Chinese immigration was forcing the original inhabitants out of the best lands; Guizhou's territory, although sparsely populated, consists mainly of high mountains, which offer little arable land. The Chinese state \"followed\" the immigrants, establishing its structures, first military, then civil, and displacing semi-independent tusi with regular administration over time. This practice, called gaitu guiliu (改土归流), led to conflicts.\nThe uprising was one of the long series dating back to Ming dynasty's conquest of the area. Whenever tensions reached a critical point, the people rose in revolt. Each rebellion, bloodily put down, left simmering hatred, and problems which were rather suppressed than solved. Basic questions of misrule, official abuse, extortion, over-taxation and land-grab remained. Mass Chinese immigration put a strain on scarce resources, but officials preyed on rather than administered the population. The quality of the officialdom in Guizhou and neighbouring areas remained very low. Great uprisings took place in Ming times, and during Qing dynasty in 1735–36, 1796–1806, and last and the largest in 1854–1873.\nThe uprising and its aftermath\nThe previous rebellion of 1736 had been met with harsh measures, with the effect of the second half of the 18th century being relatively calm, i.e. the numerous local incidents were not enough to challenge governmental authority. However, the officials were unnerved by heterodox sects spreading their teachings among both Han and Miao. In 1795 the tensions reached the point of explosion and the Miaos, led by Shi Liudeng and Shi Sanbao, rose again.\nHunan was the main area of fighting, with some taking place in Guizhou. The Qing dynasty sent banner troops, Green Standard battalions and mobilized local militias and self-defence units. The lands of rebellious Miao were confiscated, to punish them and to increase the power of state; this action, however, provoked further conflicts, because new Han landowners ruthlessly exploited their Miao tenants. On the pacified territories forts and military colonies were set up, and Miao and Chinese territories were separated by the wall with watchtowers. Still, it took eleven years to finally quell the rebellion. Relocating Green Standard troops from Hubei to Hunan in 1795, to deal with the Miao, facilitated the White Lotus Rebellion, because of the diminished control in the northern province.\nMilitary action was followed by the policy of forced assimilation: traditional dress was forbidden and an ethnic segregation policy enforced. Nevertheless, the deep causes of unrest remained unchanged and the tensions grew again, until in 1854 they exploded in the largest of Miao uprisings. Relatively few of Hunan Miao, \"pacified\" in 1795–1806, participated in the rebellions of the 1850s.\nGallery\nFile:Raising an army.jpg\nFile:Reinforcements Arriving at the Battle against the Miao at Xiushan.jpg\nFile:The Victorious Battle of Baomushan.jpg\nFile:Lifting the Siege at Songtao.jpg\nFile:The Siege of Yongsui City.jpg\nFile:The Victorious Battle at Lancaoping.jpg\nFile:The Victorious Battle over the Bandits at Huanghua.jpg\nFile:The Battle of Simazhai.jpg\nFile:The Attack on Rebel Hideouts at Chaitou, Liutao etc..jpg\nFile:Battle of the Fortifications at Kaotou, culminating in the Beheading of Wu Pansheng.jpg\nFile:The Victorious Battle at Liaojiazhong, culminating in the Beheading of Shishanbao.jpg\nFile:The Battle to retake Qianzhou.jpg\nFile:The Victorious Battle to Overcome Huxiao.jpg\nFile:The Victorious Battle over the Rebel Den at Pinglong.jpg\nFile:The Campaign at Jielai.jpg\nFile:The Victorious Battle at Shilong.jpg\nFile:Attack on the Chong-Miao.jpg\nFile:Attack on the rebel nest Dongxi and Dangzhang.jpg\nFile:Defeating the Chong-Miao and other rebels.jpg\nFile:Attack on the rebel nest Beiqing and Balin.jpg\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\nSee also\n* White Lotus Rebellion\n* Miao Rebellion (1854–73)\n*Miao Rebellion (1735–36)\n*Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty)\n*Dungan revolt (1895–1896)\n*Dungan revolt (1862–1877)\n*Nian rebellion"
