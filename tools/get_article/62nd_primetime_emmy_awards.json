Comedian and then-Late Night host Jimmy Fallon hosted the ceremony for the first time.\nThe ceremony honored the best in prime time television programming from June 1, 2009, until May 31, 2010. The HBO miniseries The Pacific won eight awards, the most for any program this year, including Outstanding Miniseries. ABC's freshman series Modern Family was the most honored comedy series of the year with six awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series. Modern Family would go on to win again the top prize for four more years (2010–2014) to reach a record five Outstanding Comedy Series wins. AMC's period piece drama Mad Men won four awards, including Outstanding Drama Series, its third consecutive victory in that category. The HBO film Temple Grandin won five major awards, tying the record for most major wins by a television film, set by Promise in 1987.\nThe ceremony was telecast live coast-to-coast in the United States by NBC, the first such broadcast since ABC did so for the 34th ceremony held in 1976. The ceremony was held before its usual mid-September date to avoid a conflict with NBC Sunday Night Football.\nOn August 21, 2010, the Creative Arts Emmy Awards were presented at the same venue. E! aired clips from the ceremony on August 28, the evening preceding the night of the primetime telecast.\nThe ceremony was received well by critics, with much praise going to the quality of the production, the voting trends and the entertainment factor. Jimmy Fallon received unanimous acclaim for his performance as the host, with some critics citing him as one of the greatest Emmy hosts in recent times.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold:\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Modern Family (ABC)'\n** 30 Rock (NBC)\n** Curb Your Enthusiasm (HBO)\n** Glee (Fox)\n** Nurse Jackie (Showtime)\n** The Office (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Mad Men (AMC)'\n** Breaking Bad (AMC)\n** Dexter (Showtime)\n** The Good Wife (CBS)\n** Lost (ABC)\n** True Blood (HBO)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Temple Grandin (HBO)'\n** Endgame (PBS)\n** ''Georgia O'Keeffe (Lifetime)\n** Moonshot (History)\n** The Special Relationship (HBO)\n** You Don't Know Jack (HBO)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Pacific (HBO)'\n** Return to Cranford (PBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Comedy Central)'\n** The Colbert Report (Comedy Central)\n** Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO)\n** Saturday Night Live (NBC)\n** The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Top Chef (Bravo)'\n** The Amazing Race (CBS)\n** American Idol (Fox)\n** Dancing with the Stars (ABC)\n** Project Runway (Lifetime)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Jim Parsons – The Big Bang Theory as Dr. Sheldon Cooper (CBS)'\n** Alec Baldwin – 30 Rock as Jack Donaghy (NBC)\n** Steve Carell – The Office as Michael Scott (NBC)\n** Larry David – Curb Your Enthusiasm as himself (HBO)\n** Matthew Morrison – Glee as Will Schuester (Fox)\n** Tony Shalhoub – Monk as Adrian Monk (USA)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Edie Falco – Nurse Jackie as Jackie Peyton, RN (Showtime)'\n** Toni Collette – United States of Tara as Tara Gregson (Showtime)\n** Tina Fey – 30 Rock as Liz Lemon (NBC)\n** Julia Louis-Dreyfus – The New Adventures of Old Christine as Christine Campbell (CBS)\n** Lea Michele – Glee as Rachel Berry (Fox)\n** Amy Poehler – Parks and Recreation as Leslie Knope (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Bryan Cranston – Breaking Bad as Walter White (AMC)'\n** Kyle Chandler – Friday Night Lights as Eric Taylor (DirecTV)\n** Matthew Fox – Lost as Dr. Jack Shephard (ABC)\n** Michael C.
