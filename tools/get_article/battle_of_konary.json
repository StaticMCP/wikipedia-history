The battle started on 16 May, when the Russian 4th Army started its counter-offensive against the Central Powers in the Kingdom of Poland. The offensive was directed against the wing of the Austrian 25th Infantry Division in the area of Opatów and Klimontów. The Polish 1st Brigade was used as a stop-gap measure and held out until 23 June, when the Russian offensive was finally repelled. Both sides suffered heavy losses.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of konary\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Konary"
