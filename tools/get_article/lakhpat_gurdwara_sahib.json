Guru Nanak on his way to Mecca stayed over in the town during his second (1506-1513) and fourth (1519-1521) missionary journey called Udasis. It is believed that he had visited the site during his fourth journey. The descendants of the host established Gurdwara here in early 19th century. This Gurdwara have his relics like wooden footwear and palkhi (cradle) as well as manuscripts and markings of two important heads of Udasi sect. The site is worshiped by the Udasi sect and initially it was maintained by them. Now it is maintained by local Sikh community and Gurdwara Shri Guru Nanak Singh Sabha of Gandhidham.
