With over four decades of experience, Master Ward is one of only 13 people in the world qualified to represent the teachings of Grandmaster Ip Chun in Hong Kong, through his online facility wingchun.online and at his full-time school and headquarters in Leeds, UK.\nMaster Ward started studying different styles in 1976 but settled early on in Ip Man Wing Chun. It was at a Wing Chun seminar in 1987 when Grandmaster Ip Chun took a real interest in Colin's skill and progress, leading to the growth of a friendship between Colin and his Sifu. In 1990, he was invited to study Wing Chun in Hong Kong under Grandmaster Ip Chun's direct guidance, starting again from scratch to fully understand every part of every technique. Since then, Master Colin Ward has been a regular visitor to Hong Kong, giving seminars and lectures at the Hong Kong University, and continuing his own studies with Grandmaster Ip Chun.\nGrandmaster Ip Chun is the eldest son of the late Great Grandmaster Ip Man, who is widely accepted to be the founder of the modern-day Wing Chun Kung Fu system. As tradition dictates, after learning his father's skills, Grandmaster Ip Chun decided to pass this skill down to his select students, including Master Colin Ward, who is now passing on this skill to his students, including Sifu Sean Mann and many others.\nMaster Colin Ward has committed his entire life to preserving Ip Man Wing Chun, helping thousands of people develop this skill worldwide. Today, he still teaches classes in Leeds, North East UK, develops the online Wing Chun platform, and continues to travel to China to train with his Sifu. He also travels worldwide to train and teach his students and grand students at seminars and other events.\nWithout Master Ward's commitment, and others like him, the well-preserved and complete Wing Chun Kung Fu system would not exist today. All the Northern Wing Chun Kung Fu Association's students and grand students are internally grateful for his contributions, and they would like to take this opportunity to thank their Sifu and Sigong for everything they have done, are doing, and will do long into the future.\nThose in the UK can find more information about Master Colin Ward's school in Leeds or lineage schools under him nationwide and attend a local class. However, the online training platform, certified by Grandmaster Ip Chun himself, is available worldwide, with a complete Ip Man Wing Chun system and grading available to help develop Wing Chun skills from a trusted source.
