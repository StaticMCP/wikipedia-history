In 1939, the bandy club IK Ymer was established in Nybro and later transitioned to ice hockey. Ymer played its first official ice hockey season in 1946, which is considered the founding year of the current club by Nybro Vikings.\nIn 1955, IK Ymer became the ice hockey section of Nybro IF, following the appointment of Ymer’s chairman Evald Carlsson as chairman of Nybro IF. The ice hockey section operated under the name Nybro IF until 1998, when it became independent as Nybro IF Hockey. In 2002, the club adopted its current name, Nybro Vikings IF. Evald Carlsson, who chaired both IK Ymer and later Nybro IF, played a central role in the club's development and was instrumental in the construction of Victoriahallen in 1963.\nAmong many seasons in Sweden’s second division, the club also played two seasons in the top-tier league during 1968–69 and 1969–70.\nNotable players\nFredrik Olausson, a member of the 2002 Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings, started his career with Nybro.\nBjörn \"Böna\" Johansson, who played for Nybro IF from 1968 to 1971, played 112 games for the Swedish national team between 1972 and 1976. During his national career he played in 5 IIHF World Championships and 1 Canada Cup.
