Stewart earned 17 caps, 15 with Canada and 2 for South Africa. Jan was named after Jan Van Rebieck, was born in Canada and left for South Africa as an infant (father South African). He was not talented enough to play for the Springbok team, so Jan left for a short period to play for Canada (all Canada's rugby players were amateurs and held regular jobs). He was eventually given an opportunity (on three occasions) to play for the Springboks.\nCareer\nStewart matriculated at Woodridge College in the Eastern Cape and in 1987 he enrolled at the University of Stellenbosch. He made his senior provincial debut for  in 1987 as a fullback and in 1988 he was selected at centre for Western Province, forming a very successful partnership with Faffa Knoetze. In 1989 he joined Villagers, within the Western Province club system. At the end of his career with Western Province in 1998, he played 136 games for the province and scored 31 tries.\nHaving dual nationality, Stewart represented Canada in two rugby world cups in 1991 and in 1995 when he was not eligible for selection for the Springboks of South Africa. He played four world cup matches in 1991 and three in 1995.\nIn 1998 when Christian was finally available to represent the Springboks of South Africa he was selected and played 3 test matches. Unfortunately, in his 3rd and final test (the now famous test where South Africa needed to beat England at Twickenham to break the New Zealand All Blacks world record of 17 consecutive wins), he suffered a serious neck injury which ended his rugby playing career at the age of 33. After the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Christian Stewart was named in the all time Dream Team chosen by the rugby press.\nStewart also played for the Stormers in South Africa, Rovigo in Italy and rugby league for the Sydney Bulldogs in Australia.\nTest history\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!colspan=7|\n|-\n!
