It is housed in the city's Ottoman-era bedesten (Μπεζεστένι) a fifteenth-century building in Eleftherias Square.\nBuilding\nThe bedesten is an enclosed and covered market. The Serres bedesten was built by Çandarlı Ibrahim Pasha the Younger around 1493/94.\nAccording to the historian of Ottoman art Semavi Eyice, the Serres bedesten is among the most remarkable specimens of the building type for its excellent construction technique and its striking exterior. It is a rectangular single-storey structure with dimensions , divided into six sections by arches, each section topped by a dome, covered by tiles instead of lead.\nExhibits\nThe building now functions as an archaeological museum. More specifically, there are prehistoric exhibits from the excavations at Promachonas and Kryoneri, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic and Roman exhibits (mainly ceramics, statues, and inscriptions) from Argilos, Vergi, Terpni, Neos Skopos, Gazoros, ancient Tragilos, and Serres. Particularly important are the Early Christian and Byzantine exhibits from the town of Serres, most notably a marble icon of Christ and a twelfth-century mosaic of St Andrew the Apostle, both from the Old Cathedral.\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-22-Arx_Serrvn-107.jpg|Andrew the Apostle\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-22-Arx_Serrvn-108.jpg|Exhibits from Bisaltia region\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-22-Arx_Serrvn-109.jpg|Marble icon of Christ\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-22-Arx_Serrvn-110.jpg|Statue of a woman\nReferences"
