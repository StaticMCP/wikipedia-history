WM reference 25898]]\nThe War Memorials Register (WMR), formerly the UK National Inventory of War Memorials, was founded in 1989 to build a comprehensive record of every war memorial in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.\nBased at the Imperial War Museums (IWM) in London, the database has so far recorded over 68,000 war memorials. These records are available in an online database available on the IWM website. It is a volunteer-led project, with a group of volunteers based at the IWM and fieldworkers from around the country working to record and update war memorial information.\nThe key information recorded includes: location, description, category, inscription, names recorded and photographs.\nWar memorials are defined as any tangible object which has been erected or dedicated to commemorate war, conflict, victory or peace; or casualties who served in, were affected by or killed as a result of war, conflict or peacekeeping; or those who died as a result of accident or disease whilst engaged in military service. This includes memorials to civilian casualties and animals. While most memorials commemorate the First and Second World Wars, all conflicts are covered, from the Roman conquest of Britain to current-day actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe WMR is working to compile a comprehensive online record of all war memorials in the UK, together with the names of the individuals whom they commemorate.\nSee also\n*Commonwealth War Graves Commission\n*The War Graves Photographic Project\n*Scottish War Memorials\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk/corporate/projects-and-partnerships/war-memorials-register War Memorials Register]\n*[https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/about-us/london-assembly/london-assembly-publications/not-forgotten-review-london%E2%80%99s-war-memorials Not forgotten: A review of London’s war memorials | London City Hall]"
