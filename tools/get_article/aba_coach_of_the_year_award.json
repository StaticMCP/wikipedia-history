It was awarded to nine people in total, with two instances of co-Coach of the Year Awards being given out. Larry Brown was the only coach to win it more than once, winning it three times. Only the first two winners of the award ended up winning the ABA Finals that same season.\n{| class=\"table sortable\" border=1 cellpadding=4 width=\"100%\" border-color=\"#bbbbbb\" style=\"border:1px solid #bbbbbb;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!style=\"background:#e1e1e1;\"|Season\n!style=\"background:#e1e1e1;\"|Coach\n!style=\"background:#e1e1e1;\"|Team\n!style=\"background:#e1e1e1;\"|Record\n!style=\"background:#e1e1e1;\"|winning%\n!style=\"background:#e1e1e1;\"|place in Division\n!style=\"background:#e1e1e1;\"|place in the ABA\n!style=\"background:#e1e1e1;\"|playoff finish\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1967–68|| Vince Cazzetta|| Pittsburgh Pipers|| 54-24|| .692|| 1st|| 1st|| ABA Champions (4–3) over the Buccaneers\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1968-69-|| Alex Hannum|| Oakland Oaks|| 60-18|| .769|| 1st|| 1st|| ABA Champions (4–1) over the Pacers\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1969–70 Tie|| Bill Sharman|| Los Angeles Stars|| 43-41|| .512|| 4th|| 6th|| Lost (4–2) in the Finals to Pacers\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1969–70 Tie|| Joe Belmont|| Denver Rockets|| 42-14|| .750|| 1st|| 2nd|| Lost (4–1) in the Western Division Semifinals to the Stars\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1970–71|| Al Bianchi|| Virginia Squires|| 55-29|| .655|| 1st|| 3rd|| Lost (4–2) in the Eastern Division Finals to the Colonels\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1971–72|| Tom Nissalke|| Dallas Chaparrals|| 42-42|| .500|| 3rd|| 6th|| Lost (4–0) in the Western Division Semifinals to the Stars\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1972–73|| Larry Brown|| Carolina Cougars|| 57-27|| .679|| 1st|| 1st|| Lost (4–3) in the Eastern Division Finals to the Colonels\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1973–74 Tie|| Babe McCarthy|| Kentucky Colonels|| 53-31|| .631|| 2nd|| 2nd|| Lost (4–0) in the Eastern Division Finals to the Nets\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1973–74 Tie|| Joe Mullaney|| Utah Stars|| 51-33|| .607|| 1st|| 3rd|| Lost (4–1) in the Finals to the Nets\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1974–75|| Larry Brown|| Denver Nuggets|| 65-19|| .774|| 1st|| 1st|| Lost (4–3) in the Western Division Finals to Pacers\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|1975–76|| Larry Brown|| Denver Nuggets|| 60-24|| .714|| no divisions|| 1st|| Lost (4–2) in the Finals to the Nets\n|-style=\"background-color:#f1f1f1;vertical-align:top;\"\n|}\nReferences"
