      "text": "# Treaty of Faizabad\n\nThe Treaty of Faizabad or the Second Treaty of Banaras was a significant agreement signed in 1775 between the East India Company and Asaf-ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Awadh, following the death of his father, Nawab Shuja-ud-Daulah. The treaty marked a pivotal moment in the expansion of British influence in northern India by transferring sovereignty over the state of Banaras to the Company, thereby making Maharaja Chait Singh, the ruler of Banaras, a vassal of the British. The treaty also set the terms for financial tribute and non-interference in Banaras, terms that were later violated, leading to the Banaras Uprising of 1781.\nBackground\nDuring the mid-18th century, the East India Company was consolidating its power in India following victories in the Battle of Plassey (1757) and the Battle of Buxar (1764). The latter conflict resulted in the Treaty of Allahabad (1765), which granted the Company significant territorial and financial concessions from the Mughal Emperor and the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daulah. The region of Banaras, ruled by Maharaja Chait Singh, was a feudatory under Awadh's nominal authority but enjoyed considerable autonomy.\nUpon Shuja-ud-Daulah's death in 1775, his son Asaf-ud-Daulah ascended to the throne. The East India Company, under the leadership of Governor-General Warren Hastings, sought to renegotiate its relationship with Awadh as a precondition for recognizing Asaf-ud-Daulah's succession. This led to the signing of the Treaty of Faizabad in 1775.\nTerms of the Treaty\nThe Treaty of Faizabad, signed in the city of Faizabad (then-capital of Awadh) in 1775, included several far-reaching provisions. Under this treaty, the sovereignty of Banaras was transferred by Asaf-ud-Daulah to the East India Company, further expanding British influence in the region. The agreement also stipulated the deployment and subsidization of British troops at key strategic locations, such as Faizabad, Lucknow, and Chunar, with funding sourced largely from Nawabi revenues. Additionally, the treaty included terms that placed financial pressure on Raja Chait Singh of Banaras to provide an annual tribute of 22 lakh rupees to the Company. Beyond this, the Company also sought an additional annual grant of 5 lakh rupees, purportedly to finance military expenses, including the cost of the French wars and the maintenance of two Company regiments. A non-interference clause explicitly stipulated that no demands beyond the agreed tribute would be made on Chait Singh, nor would any person be allowed to interfere with his authority or disturb the peace of his territory. However, the treaty marked the initiation of direct Company interference in the internal administration and financial affairs of Banaras, setting a precedent for increased British intervention in the region’s governance and military affairs.\nThese terms were intended to ensure a stable relationship between the Company and Banaras while securing financial and military resources for the British administration.\nAftermath and Violations\nDespite the clear terms of the Treaty of Faizabad, financial pressures on the East India Company led to repeated violations of the non-interference and tribute clauses. Governor-General Warren Hastings, facing the costs of ongoing conflicts such as the First Anglo-Maratha War, demanded additional contributions from Chait Singh. In 1778, Hastings imposed a war levy of 5 lakh rupees, a demand repeated in 1779 and 1780, in direct contravention of the treaty.\nChait Singh attempted to comply partially, offering 2 lakh rupees in 1780 along with an apologetic letter, but resisted full payment, viewing the demands as unjust. This tension escalated when Hastings personally traveled to Banaras in 1781 to enforce compliance. Despite Chait Singh's submissive gestures, Hastings placed him under arrest, triggering the Banaras Uprising. Chait Singh's soldiers and subjects rebelled against the British, forcing Hastings to flee under military protection. Subsequently, Chait Singh was deposed and replaced by his nephew, Mahip Narayan Singh, under stricter British control. The rebellion had repercussions beyond Banaras, influencing regional dynamics in areas like Bihar, where local discontent with British policies was exacerbated by the events.\nThe violation of the Treaty of Faizabad became a focal point during Warren Hastings' impeachment trial (1787–1795) in Britain, where he was accused of oppression and extortion in his dealings with Chait Singh. Though acquitted, the episode damaged Hastings' reputation and highlighted the exploitative nature of British colonial policies.\nHistorical Significance\nThe Treaty of Faizabad represents a critical step in the East India Company's expansion into northern India, marking the formal subordination of Banaras to British authority. However, the subsequent disregard for its terms by the Company exemplified the unequal power dynamics between British administrators and Indian rulers, fueling resentment among local populations. The events following the treaty contributed to broader resistance against Company rule and underscored the challenges of maintaining autonomy under colonial oversight.\nThe Banaras Uprising of 1781 remains a notable example of early resistance to British overreach, with effects felt in neighboring regions.\nSee also\n* List of treaties\nReferences"
