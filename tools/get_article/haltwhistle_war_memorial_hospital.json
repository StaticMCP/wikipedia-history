It is managed by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. The war memorial itself, which stands in front of the hospital, is a Grade II listed structure.\nHistory\nThe original facility was built as a private home known as Greencroft House in the 18th century. It was remodeled in the early 19th century and then converted into a hospital, as a lasting memorial to soldiers who died in the First World War, in August 1922. A  maternity wing was added in 1939 and it joined the National Health Service in 1948. It was completely rebuilt to modern standards at a cost of £5.5 million in 2014.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.northumbria.nhs.uk Official site]"
