He was educated at Chichester High School For Boys and read English Literature at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. In 1964 he was awarded the Chancellor's Gold Medal for Poetry. While at Cambridge he wrote a play, Ladder of Fools which was performed at the ADC Theatre as a double bill with Hello-Goodbye Sebastian by John Grillo in April 1965, and at the Oxford Playhouse in June of that year. It was described by Eric Shorter of The Daily Telegraph as \"Actable, gripping, murky and moody: how often can you say that of the average new play tried out in London, let alone of an undergraduate's work...\" Brenton's one-act play, ''It's My Criminal, was performed at the Royal Court Theatre (1966).\nCareer\nIn 1968 he joined the Brighton Combination as a writer and actor, and in 1969 joined Portable Theatre (founded by David Hare and Tony Bicat), for whom he wrote Christie in Love'', staged in the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs (1969) and Fruit (1970). He is also the author of Winter, Daddykins (1966), Revenge for the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs; and the triple-bill Heads, Gum & Goo and The Education of Skinny Spew (1969). These were followed by Wesley (1970); Scott of the Antarctic and A Sky-blue Life (1971); Hitler Dances, How Beautiful With Badges, and an adaptation of Measure for Measure (1972).\nIn 1973 Brenton and David Hare were jointly commissioned by Richard Eyre to write a \"big\" play for Nottingham Playhouse. \"The result was Brassneck, which offered an exhilaratingly panoramic satire on England from 1945 to the present, depicting the meteoric ups and downs of a self-seeking Midlands family...from singing the Red Flag in 1945 to acting as a conduit for the Oriental drug market in the decadent Seventies.\" – Michael Billington (2007).  Brassneck was followed a year later by Brenton's The Churchill Play, again staged by Richard Eyre at the Nottingham Playhouse (1974), another 'state of the nation play' about the growing conflict between security and liberty, opening with the image of a dead Winston Churchill rising from his catafalque in Westminster Hall. Brenton's play \"offered an imaginative vision of a future in which basic human freedoms would be curtailed by the state. As so often, a dramatist saw things that others did not\".\nBrenton's next major success was Weapons of Happiness, about a strike in a south London factory, commissioned by the National Theatre for its new Lyttelton Theatre and the first commissioned play to be performed at its South Bank home. Staged by Hare in July 1976, it won the Evening Standard award for Best Play.\nHe gained notoriety for his play The Romans in Britain, first staged at the National Theatre in October 1980, which drew parallels between the Roman invasion of Britain in 54BC and the British military presence in Northern Ireland.  But the politics of his play were ignored. Instead a display of moral outrage focused on a scene of attempted anal rape of a Druid priest (played by Greg Hicks), caught bathing by a Roman centurion (Peter Sproule). This resulted in a private prosecution by Mary Whitehouse against the play's director Michael Bogdanov. Whitehouse's prosecution was withdrawn by her own legal team when it became obvious that it would not succeed.\nThe theme of Brenton's 1985 political comedy Pravda, a collaboration with David Hare who also directed, was described by Michael Billington in The Guardian of 3 May 1985 as \"the rapacious absorption of chunks of the British press by a tough South African entrepreneur, Lambert Le Roux...superbly embodied by Anthony Hopkins who utters every sentence with precise Afrikaans over-articulation as if the rest of the world are idiots.\" The target of the satire was generally accepted to be the Australian international newspaper proprietor Rupert Murdoch and his News International empire, but the play's main question mark was about the dangers for society and the state of monopolistic media ownership.\nBrenton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2017.\nPersonal life\nHe married Jane Margaret Fry in 1970. They have two sons.\nWorks\nPlays\n* Ladder of Fools, Cambridge University Actors, ADC Theatre, Cambridge (1965)\n* Winter, Daddykins, Lantern Theatre, Dublin (1965)\n* ''It's My Criminal, Royal Court Theatre (1965)\n* Christie in Love, Portable Theatre, Royal Court Theatre Upstairs (1969)\n* Gum and Goo, Brighton Combination (1969); RSC at the Open Space Theatre (1971)\n* Revenge, Royal Court Theatre Upstairs (1969)\n* Heads, University of Bradford Drama Group (1969); Inter-Action at the Ambience-in-Exile Lunch Hour Theatre Club (1970)\n* The Education of Skinny Spew, University of Bradford Drama Group (1969); Inter-Action at the Ambience-in-Exile Lunch Hour Theatre Club (1970)\n* Fruit (1970)\n* Wesley, Bradford Festival (1970)\n* Scott of the Antarctic, Bradford Festival (1971)\n* Hitler Dances, Traverse Theatre Workshop (1972)\n* Measure for Measure (adaptation), Northcott Theatre (1972)\n* Magnificence, Royal Court (1973)\n* Brassneck, written with David Hare, Nottingham Playhouse (1973)\n* The Churchill Play, Nottingham Playhouse (1974); revived by the RSC 1978 and 1988\n* The Screens'', an abridgement of Jean Genet's Les Paravents, Bristol Old Vic studio (1973)\n* The Saliva Milkshake, Soho Poly Lunchtime Theatre (1975)\n* Weapons of Happiness, National Theatre, Lyttelton (1976); winner of the Evening Standard award 1976; revived by the Finborough Theatre, 2008\n* Epsom Downs, Joint Stock Theatre Company (1977)\n* Deeds, written with Trevor Griffiths, Ken Campbell, and David Hare, Nottingham Playhouse (1978)\n* Sore Throats, RSC Donmar Warehouse (1978)\n* The Life of Galileo, translation from Bertolt Brecht, National Theatre, Olivier (August 1980)\n* The Romans in Britain, National Theatre, Olivier (October 1980)\n* A Short Sharp Shock, written with Tony Howard, Royal Court at the Theatre Royal Stratford East (1980)\n* Thirteenth Night, RSC Donmar Warehouse (1981)\n* ''Danton's Death, translation from Georg Büchner, National Theatre, Olivier (July 1982)\n* Conversations in Exile, adapted from Brecht, Foco Novo (1982)\n* The Genius, Royal Court (1983)\n* Sleeping Policemen, written with Tunde Ikoli, Foco Novo, Hemel Hempstead then Royal Court (1983)\n* Bloody Poetry, Foco Novo, Hampstead Theatre (1984); Royal Court (1987)\n* Pravda, written with David Hare, National Theatre, Olivier (1985); winner of the Evening Standard Award 1985\n* Greenland, Royal Court (1988)\n* H.I.D.
