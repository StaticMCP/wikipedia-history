The absences of popular artist such as 2NE1, Big Bang, IU, and T-ara, with none of them receiving any awards despite their successes during the year led to criticisms over fairness. The ceremony was broadcast through JTBC's Lunar New Year special instead of being broadcast live, which drew accusations of the awards being a \"JTBC promotional concert\" in an attempt to boost the channel's ratings. The ceremony also drew small controversy for being held abroad, with observers commenting that they did not see how Japan was relevant to the awards when sales figures were calculated from South Korea only. Others pointed out that although the Mnet Asian Music Awards is also a South Korean ceremony that have been held abroad, it had various participants from multiple countries around the world unlike the Golden Disc Awards, where only Korean artists participated.\nReferences"
