From 2008 until 2022, he served as the director of the Museum of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka, having previously been a curator at the  in Nishinomiya.\nEducation and career\nAfter studying quantum physics and mechanics, he earned a bachelor's and master's degree in Art and Fine Arts from Osaka University's School of Letters. He subsequently worked as curator for the Ōtani Memorial Museum in Nishinomiya, Japan, and, in 1987, joined the Museum of Oriental Ceramics, Osaka, becoming Director in 2008.\nContributions and awards\nIn 2011, he was awarded the 32nd Koyama Fujio Memorial Prize, an award in the field of ceramics studies commemorating Koyama Fujio.\nIn 2017, he was instrumental in establishing a sister-museum partnership between the Museum of Oriental Ceramics in Osaka with Taiwan's National Palace Museum. The partnership was established after an Edo-period Imari plate from the Osaka Museum of Oriental Ceramics was found broken, during a loan to the National Palace Museum’s Southern Branch in Taiwan. Both museums concluded that the damage was not caused by mishandling and agreed on restoration in Taiwan using the traditional kintsugi technique. Shortly after the plate was restored, then-Director Tetsurō Degawa and NPM Director Lin Jeng-yi signed a memorandum of cooperation to strengthen institutional ties.\nIn 2025, Degawa gave a lecture on the life and work of Lucie Rie at the National Crafts Museum in Kanazawa, held in conjunction with a major retrospective of her work. Recalling his involvement in an exhibition of Rie's work in 1989, a time when she was still rather unknown in Japan, he emphasized Rie’s role in drawing new and younger audiences to ceramics in Japan.\nPublications\n* Celadon of Yue Ware (1994), a museum catalogue with essays in Japanese and English.\n* 明末清初の民窯 [Export porcelain in late Ming to early Qing], Vol. 10 in 中国の陶磁 10 [Chinese Ceramics] (1997), co-authored with Nishida Hiroko, Heibonsha Publishing.\n* Hokusō Joyō seiji: Kōko hakkutsu seika ten / Northern Song Ru Ware.
