He capitalized on the fact that most of the attention of the Spanish armada was put in escorting the Habsburg emperor Charles V to Genoa. Aydin was joined by four Barbary fustas, who alerted him that , captain of the galley squad of Granada, had returned from Genoa and was waiting for him with eight galleys after hearing about his sackings in Ibiza.\nPrevious movements\nAydin headed quickly for Algiers, with his fleet unprepared to give battle due to its load of passengers, slaves and goods, but found no favorable wind, so he tried to hide in the coast of Formentera. When he saw Portuondo's fleet arrive nonetheless, the Ottoman abandoned the cargo and non-combatants in Formentera and ordered to flee.\nBattle\nPortuondo chased Aydin abandoning all prudence, but his slave galleys, most of them recent French prisoners from the Italian War of 1521–1526, proved unreliable to keep the pace. The Spanish ships became thus increasingly separated, to the point Portuondo's flagship was practically alone at the head of the convoy. When Aydin saw his chance, he turned back and assaulted the ship with three of his own, capturing it quickly, with Portuondo dying in a desperate defense. Aydin then attacked the same way the stunned rest of the fleet, one by one at time, with the help of his advantage in numbers. At the end, all but one of the eight Spanish galleys were taken.\nAftermath\nThe prisoners were taken as slaves to the recently conquered city of Algiers, while 1000 Muslim galley slaves were liberated. Portuondo was succeeded by Álvaro de Bazán the Elder at the head of the squad of Granada.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n* Garnier, Edith ''L'Alliance Impie'' Editions du Felin, 2008, Paris  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090818015845/http://www.neopodia.mobi/20090519-histoire-renaissance-alliance-impie-francois-1er-ier-ottoman-soliman-suleyman-charles-quint-forces-en-presence Interview]"
