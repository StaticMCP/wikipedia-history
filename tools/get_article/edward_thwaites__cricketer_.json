He played in 25 first-class matches, including for the Players in 1827.\nThwaites was born at Staplehurst in Kent in 1801, the son of Stephen and Mary (née Simmons) Thwaites. He was a member of Hawkhurst Cricket Club and made his first-class debut for a Kent side against one from Sussex, playing in a pair of matches organised by the club in 1825, one at Brighton and the other at Hawkhurst Moor. He played a single match for an England XI later in the year.}}\nThe following year Thwaites played for an England XI before playing for Sussex in July and then for Kent in a repeat of the pair of matches against Sussex in August. Thwaites played regularly for Sussex between 1827 and 1829, making nine appearances for the side, including playing in all three roundarm trial matches in 1827. He was chosen to play for the Players in the 1827 Gentlemen v Players match and played in other matches for East Sussex sides, but was not selected for the county side after 1829 until 1836 when he played for Sussex against MCC at Lord's.\nThwaites made a further six first-class appearances for the side between 1835 and 1837, his final first-class match coming in August 1837 against MCC at Brighton. A total of 19 of his 25 first-class matches were for Sussex sides. In first-class cricket he scored 397 runs with a highest score of 37 not out, made for Sussex against an England XI at Sheffield in 1827.\nThwaites worked as a tallow chandler in Hastings. He married Mary Standen in the town in 1833; the couple had eight children. Thwaites died at Hastings in 1872. He was aged 70.\nNotes\nReferences"
