It was released on April 6, 2018, through Atlantic Records. The album is primarily hip-hop, but also includes elements of trap, Latin trap and R&B. It features production from 30 Roc, Andrew Watt, Benny Blanco, Boi-1da, Craig Kallman, Cubeatz, DJ Mustard, Frank Dukes, J. White Did It, Keyz, Murda Beatz, Needlz, Tainy, and Vinylz, among others. The album features guest appearances by Migos, Chance the Rapper, Kehlani, SZA, 21 Savage, J Balvin, Bad Bunny, and YG.\nThe album debuted atop the US Billboard 200 earning 255,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, with 103,000 coming from pure album sales. It earned the second biggest first-week sales of 2018 at the time, while Cardi B became the first female artist to chart thirteen songs simultaneously on the Billboard Hot 100. The album set multiple streaming records upon release, including the largest female rap album streaming week of all time, with 202.6 million on-demand streams in its first week. It was supported by five singles–\"Bodak Yellow\", \"Bartier Cardi\" (featuring 21 Savage), \"Be Careful\", \"I Like It\" (with Bad Bunny and J Balvin), and \"Ring\" (featuring Kehlani). Both Diamond-certified singles \"Bodak Yellow\" and \"I Like It\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making Cardi B the first female rapper to top the chart more than once, and making the album the female rap album with the most Hot 100 number-one songs—a record later tied by her own second album, Am I The Drama?, in 2025 (two each).\nWith over seven million units sold in the US to date, Invasion of Privacy is best-selling female rap album of the 21st century, according to Luminate. It broke the record for longest-charting album by a female rapper on the Billboard 200, surpassing The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, and has spent three full years on the chart. In December 2019, it became the most-streamed female rap album on Spotify and Apple Music, and the most-viewed female rap album on YouTube. It has been certified 6× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), becoming the highest-certified female rap album of the 21st century, while further becoming the first album in music history to have all its tracks certified platinum or higher by the RIAA.\nInvasion of Privacy was met with critical acclaim. A number of music publications included it among their lists of best albums of the year, with Rolling Stone and Time listing it at number one. Several publications ranked it among the best albums of the 2010s as well, with Rolling Stone placing it at number thirty-four. Among its accolades, it won Best Rap Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, with Cardi B becoming the first female rapper to win the award as a solo artist. It also became the first female rap album in fifteen years to be nominated for Album of the Year, with \"I Like It\" being nominated for Record of the Year and \"Be Careful\" for Best Rap Performance. \"Bodak Yellow\" was nominated for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance at the previous ceremony. At the 2019 BET Awards, Invasion of Privacy won the BET Award for Album of the Year.\nThe album was made available for streaming on April 5, 2018, but was not available on any physical format upon its initial release. It would later be released for digital download worldwide, a day later, on April 6. The album was eventually released on vinyl on December 7, 2018, and on CD on February 22, 2019. A deluxe edition was intended to be released on January 25, 2019 and include \"Money\", \"Press\", and potentially three other tracks, but was scrapped for unknown reasons.\nBackground\nPrior to the release of the album, \"Bodak Yellow\" reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, while several collaborations also reached the top 10. Those singles set multiple chart records, including making her the first female rapper to land her first three entries in the top 10 of the Hot 100, and the first female artist to achieve the same on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

In March 2018, Cardi announced at the iHeartRadio Music Awards that the album will be released in April. She announced the release date and the title posting the album artwork in her social media pages on March 27, 2018.\nRecording and production\nInvasion of Privacy was recorded from 2017 until early 2018, in The Cutting Room, based in New York City, based in New York.

Numerous notable artists collaborated with Cardi B on the project, including the Migos (whose member Offset married Cardi B in 2017), Chance the Rapper, Bad Bunny, J Balvin, Kehlani, 21 Savage, YG, and SZA.\nMusic and lyrics\nPrimarily a hip hop album, Invasion of Privacy also comprises trap, Latin music and R&B, while its lyrical themes include fame, success, wealth, sex, and feminism, as well as Cardi B's past. The album opens with \"Get Up 10\", which speaks about Cardi B's rise to fame. It is followed by a trap song \"Drip\", which features a guest appearance by Migos, and speaks about jewelry, wealth, and Cardi B and Migos' status. The third track \"Bickenhead\" has a feminist theme; its title refers to women who work hard for money.\nA hip hop and trap song \"Bodak Yellow\" follows, on which Cardi B confronts her enemies and makes statements such as \"I don't dance now, I make money moves\", referring to her past, as she used to work as a stripper before rising to fame. On the fifth track \"Be Careful\", Cardi B performs the hook using a softly sung vocal style over a \"laidback\" beat. The song also comprises \"flickering\" hi-hats and \"slick\" synths. Lyrically, \"Be Careful\" is a song about infidelity, where the protagonist warns her cheating partner and asks him to treat her better. During an interview, Cardi B stated that she drew inspiration from past relationships, while denying that the song was directed at her fiancé Offset.\nThe sixth track \"Best Life\" features a guest appearance by Chance the Rapper; the lyrics discuss the power of God and positive thinking. It's followed by \"I Like It\", a bilingual (English and Spanish) latin trap song featuring Bad Bunny and J Balvin. Invasion of Privacy also contains two R&B mid-tempo songs–\"Ring\" (featuring Kehlani) and \"Thru Your Phone\"–which both lyrically show Cardi B's emotional vulnerability.\n\"Ring\" is followed by three hip hop and trap songs: \"Money Bag\", \"Bartier Cardi\" (featuring 21 Savage), and \"She Bad\" (with YG). On \"Bartier Cardi\", Cardi B raps about her attraction to diamonds, sports cars and sex, while 21 Savage raps about a similar theme from a male perspective.\nRelease and promotion\nPrior to the release of Invasion of Privacy, Cardi B promoted its lead single \"Bodak Yellow\" in several live performances, including at the BET Awards 2017 afterparty on June 25, 2017, during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards pre-show on August 27, at the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 6, and on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on October 18.\nWhile accepting her iHeartRadio Music Award for Best New Artist at the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards on March 11, 2018, Cardi B revealed that Invasion of Privacy would be released in April 2018.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 24 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian gave Invasion of Privacy four out of five stars, and called it \"a magnificent debut that fuses vulnerability, sexual voraciousness, paranoia, and party music\" and wrote that the album \"shows the rapper is capable of far more than punchy put-downs\". For Exclaim!, Erin Lowers scored the album a 9 out of 10, noting that her softer singles add \"a new dimension\" to her artistry, and adding that the release \"feels like her 'Lemonade' moment, one that magnifies her insecurities for public consumption.\"\nMaeve McDermott of USA Today gave the album another positive review, stating that \"at 13 tracks, Invasion of Privacy isn't overstuffed with endless filler tracks like many releases by Cardi's rap peers. Leave it to Cardi, marketing queen, to know that fans get exhausted when performers overstay their welcome in attempts to rack up streaming numbers. The hip hop star likely doesn't have to worry about that, considering her album seems destined for charts success, if \"Bodak Yellow\"'s record-breaking last year was any indication.\" Jem Aswad of Variety called it \"one of the most powerful debuts of this millennium\" and praised its opening number \"Get Up 10\" as an \"empowering opening autobiographical testimonial,\" though he also felt \"in a couple of cases the featured artists run off with the song so completely that it feels like Cardi is a guest on her own album.\" Eleanor Halls of GQ wrote: \"Invasion of Privacy proves \"Bodak Yellow\" was far from a summer one-hit wonder. These money moves are played for the long game.\"\nRob Sheffield of Rolling Stone described the album as \"lavishly emotional, intimately personal, wildly funny,\" and concluded \"Invasion proves she's here to stay.\" For Pitchfork, Sheldon Pearce awarded the album \"Best New Music\", writing that \"Cardi B's remarkable debut places her, without a doubt, in the pantheon of great rappers. It is both brazen and vulnerable, filled with wild amounts of personality, style, and craft\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted, \"she is more versatile than most rappers or pop stars of any stripe,\" adding, \"[it] is also, notably, a hip-hop album that doesn't sound like any of its temporal peers.\"\nChris Richards of The Washington Post commented: \"She seems to be telling one long story here — about self-empowerment, beating the odds, transcendence — but the force of Cardi's narrative resides in the sound of her voice as much as it does in her words. You can hear it during the album's grand finale, \"I Do,\" when she asks, \"My little 15 minutes lasted long as hell, huh?\" What a victory speech. Close your eyes and you might feel the confetti falling on your shoulders, too.\" Carrie Battan of The New Yorker complimented Invasion of Privacy by saying \"[it] is as studious as it is bombastic.\"\nTime magazine named Invasion of Privacy the best album of 2018, stating, \"Cardi's debut doesn't just earn her a seat at hip-hop's table—it marks her as a singular voice.\"\nAccolades\nA number of music publications included Invasion of Privacy among their top 10 albums of the year lists, with Rolling Stone and Time listing it at number one. In 2019, Rolling Stone and Pitchfork listed the album as one of the greatest albums of the decade, placing it at number 34 and 73, respectively. In 2022, Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 20 on its list of \"100 Best Debut Albums of All Time\".\nAll genres (2018)\n* 1st&nbsp;– Capital XTRA\n* 1st&nbsp;– Entertainment Tonight\n* 1st&nbsp;– The Ringer\n* 1st&nbsp;– Rob Sheffield, Rolling Stone\n* 1st&nbsp;– Staff, Rolling Stone\n* 1st&nbsp;– Time\n* 2nd&nbsp;– Billboard\n* 2nd&nbsp;– Entertainment Weekly\n* 2nd&nbsp;– Esquire\n* 3rd&nbsp;– A.Side\n* 3rd&nbsp;– Dagbladet\n* 3rd&nbsp;– Highsnobiety\n* 3rd&nbsp;– Metro Times\n* 3rd&nbsp;– The New Zealand Herald\n* 3rd&nbsp;– Okayplayer\n* 3rd&nbsp;– Paper\n* 3rd&nbsp;– Refinery29\n* 3rd&nbsp;– Thrillist\n* 3rd&nbsp;– Staff, Yahoo!\n* 4th&nbsp;– El Periódico de Catalunya\n* 4th&nbsp;– The Guardian\n* 4th&nbsp;– The Nation\n* 4th&nbsp;– Stereogum\n* 4th&nbsp;– Vibe\n* 5th&nbsp;– The Daily Beast\n* 5th&nbsp;– Rhian Daly, DIY\n* 6th&nbsp;– BrooklynVegan\n* 6th&nbsp;– Karl Smith, Kerrang!\n* 6th&nbsp;– The Line of Best Fit\n* 6th&nbsp;– The Mercury News\n* 6th&nbsp;– The Music\n* 6th&nbsp;– NPR Music\n* 6th&nbsp;– Slant\n* 7th&nbsp;– Omaha World-Herald\n* 8th&nbsp;– Consequence of Sound\n* 8th&nbsp;– Jon Caramanica, The New York Times\n* 8th&nbsp;– NME\n* 8th&nbsp;– Uproxx\n* 9th&nbsp;– Marianne Eloise, Kerrang!\n* 10th&nbsp;– Complex\n* 10th&nbsp;– Erik Leijon, Cult MTL\n* 10th&nbsp;– NBC News\n* 10th&nbsp;– The Sunday Times\n* Top 10 (unordered list)&nbsp;– El Universal\n* Top 10 (unordered list)&nbsp;– G1\n* Top 10 (unordered list)&nbsp;– The Georgia Straight\n* Top 10 (unordered list)&nbsp;– Out\n* Top 10 (unordered list)&nbsp;– People\n* 11th&nbsp;– Crack Magazine\n* 13th&nbsp;– Dazed\n* 13th&nbsp;– Noisey\n* 13th&nbsp;– Jem Aswad, Variety\n* 14th&nbsp;– Clash\n* 14th&nbsp;– Gaffa (Denmark)\n* 16th&nbsp;– Esquire (UK)\n* Top 16 (unordered list)&nbsp;– Marie Claire\n* 19th&nbsp;– Newsday\n* 19th&nbsp;– Pitchfork\n* 20th&nbsp;– Fact\n* 20th&nbsp;– The Independent\n* Top 20 (unordered list)&nbsp;– Junkee\n* 21st&nbsp;– Flood Magazine\n* 21st&nbsp;– Spin\n* 23rd&nbsp;– The Triangle\n* 37th&nbsp;– John Meagher, Irish Independent\n* 42nd&nbsp;– PopMatters\n* 54th&nbsp;– The Quietus\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– Buzznet\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– Chicago Sun-Times\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– Evening Standard\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– Gothamist\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– GQ\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– La Vanguardia\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– New York Post\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– The Philadelphia Inquirer\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– San Diego CityBeat\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– Slate\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– USA Today\nHip-hop and rap (2018)\n* 1st&nbsp;– Rolling Stone\n* 1st&nbsp;– BrooklynVegan\n* 1st&nbsp;– Exclaim!\n* 1st&nbsp;– Stereogum\n* 2nd&nbsp;– Billboard\n* 3rd&nbsp;– NPR Music\n* 4th&nbsp;– Salon\n* 5th&nbsp;– Paste\n* 6th&nbsp;– The Austin Chronicle\n* 7th&nbsp;– Revolt TV\n* 9th&nbsp;– PopMatters\n* 10th&nbsp;– HipHopDX\n* Top 10 (unordered list)&nbsp;– Yardbarker\n* Top 50 (unordered list)&nbsp;– XXL\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– AllMusic\n* Best of 2018 (unordered list)&nbsp;– The A.V.

And Cardi will remain front-and-center.\" The magazine further added that Invasion of Privacy is an \"invitation into [her] world of blood, sweat, and tears... it's a rebuke to much of what passes for chart-focused rap, where the artist's persona is crafted for maximum exposure. Instead, Cardi B recognized that artists of color no longer need to pander or soften themselves in order to become household names.\" In 2019, Consequence of Sound editors wrote \"her authenticity and charisma are constants that reinforce her standing as one of the most formidable hip-hop artists of the decade,\" and NME stated that the album secured \"her crown as the new Queen of Rap.\" In a book excerpt published in Jezebel of The Motherlode (2021) by Clover Hope, the author wrote that Invasion of Privacy was \"the best rap debut in years and belongs in the canon along with Lil' Kim's Hard Core and Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\" and stated that the album \"jump-started a new era for women rappers in which success felt much more tangible\" as Cardi B \"multiplied the wealth of talent and resurrected the idea that numerous women who controlled their own stories could dominate rap at once... Never again would there only be one.\"\nTrack listing\nCredits adapted from Tidal.\n| extra1 =\n| length1 = 3:51\n| title2 = Drip\n| note2 = featuring Migos\n| writer2 =\n| extra2 =\n| length2 = 4:23\n| title3 = Bickenhead\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 =\n| length3 = 3:01\n| title4 = Bodak Yellow\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 = }}\n| length4 = 3:43\n| title5 = Be Careful\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 =\n| length5 = 3:30\n| title6 = Best Life\n| note6 = featuring Chance the Rapper\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 =\n| length6 = 4:44\n| title7 = I Like It\n| note7 = with Bad Bunny and J Balvin\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 = |Nick Seeley}}\n| length7 = 4:13\n| title8 = Ring\n| note8 = featuring Kehlani\n| writer8 =\n| extra8 =\n| length8 = 2:57\n| title9 = Money Bag\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 = }}\n| length9 = 3:49\n| title10 = Bartier Cardi\n| note10 = featuring 21 Savage\n| writer10 =\n| extra10 =\n| length10 = 3:44\n| title11 = She Bad\n| note11 = with YG\n| writer11 =\n| extra11 =\n| length11 = 3:50\n| title12 = Thru Your Phone\n| writer12 =\n| extra12 = }}\n| length12 = 3:08\n| title13 = I Do\n| note13 = featuring SZA\n| writer13 =\n| extra13 =\n| length13 = 3:20\n}}\nNotes\n* }} signifies a co-producer\n* }} signifies an additional producer\n* \"I Like It\" features additional background vocals by Andrew Tinker, Holly Seeley, Michael Romero, Nick Seeley and Sarah Sellers\n* \"Thru Your Phone\" features background vocals by Andrew Watt and uncredited vocals by Ali Tamposi\nSample credits\n* \"Get Up 10\" contains an interpolation of \"Dreams and Nightmares\", performed by Meek Mill and written by Maurice Jordan, Jermaine Preyan, Robert Williams and Anthony Tucker.\n* \"Bickenhead\" contains a sample of \"Chickenhead\", written by Jordan Houston, Paul Beauregard and Todd Shaw, performed by Project Pat.\n* \"Bodak Yellow\" contains an interpolation of \"No Flockin\", performed by Kodak Black.\n* \"Be Careful\" contains an interpolation of \"Ex-Factor\", written and performed by Lauryn Hill.\n* \"I Like It\" contains a sample of \"I Like It Like That\", written by Tony Pabon and Manny Rodriguez, and performed by Pete Rodriguez.\nPersonnel\nPerformance\n* Cardi B – primary artist\n* Migos – featured artist\n* Chance the Rapper – featured artist\n* Bad Bunny – artist\n* J Balvin – artist\n* Kehlani – featured artist\n* 21 Savage – featured artist\n* YG – artist\n* SZA – featured artist\n* Ali Tamposi – uncredited vocals\n* Holly Seeley – background vocals\n* Nick Seeley – background vocals\n* Michael Romero – background vocals\n* Andrew Tinker – background vocals\n* Sarah Sellers – background vocals\n* Andrew Watt – background vocals\nInstrumentation\n* Juan Chavez – trumpets\n* Andrew Watt – guitar\n* Benny Blanco – keyboards\nProduction\n* Darrale Jones – executive production\n* Brooklyn Johnny – executive production\n* Craig Kallman – executive production\n* Avery Earls – production coordinator\n* Carlyn Calder – production coordinator\n* Donnie Meadows – production coordinator\n* Andrew Luftman – production coordinator\n* Sarah Shelton – production coordinator\n* Sofia Yen – production coordinator\n* Zvi Edelman – production coordinator\nTechnical\n* DJ SwanQo – programming , additional recording , editing\n* Matt Allen – programming\n* Cassius Jay – programming\n* Max Lord – recording\n* Nonstop Da Hitman – programming\n* Ayo & Keys – programming\n* NES – programming\n* J.
