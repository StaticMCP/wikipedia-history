The most serious form of homicide, first-degree murder, constitutes the intentional killing of a person without legal justification or an unintentional killing during the commission of a felony (the felony murder rule). Additionally, Delaware is one of the only states where intentionally causing someone to commit suicide under duress is punishable as first-degree murder. The crime of first-degree murder is punishable for those over the age of 18 only by life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The state previously punished first-degree murder by either life-without-parole or the death penalty, but Delaware's death penalty statute was ruled unconstitutional in 2016, and the statute was fully repealed in 2024. In 2013, Delaware passed legislation eliminating life-without-parole sentences for first-degree murders committed while the perpetrator was under the age of 18. For juveniles, the sentence is a minimum of 25 years in prison and a maximum of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.\nSecond-degree murder\nSecond-degree murder under Delaware law is the killing of a victim when the perpetrator recklessly causes the death of another person under circumstances which manifest a cruel, wicked, and depraved indifference to human life. It is punishable by a minimum of 15 years in prison and a maximum of life imprisonment without parole.\nFelony murder rule\nLike most states, Delaware employs the standard of the felony murder rule. A murder where a victim dies during or shortly after the commission (or attempted commission) of any felony due to the offender's reckless conduct is punishable as first-degree murder. If it is during negligent conduct, it is punishable as second-degree murder.\nMurder by abuse or neglect\nTwo other forms of murder in Delaware law are first- and second-degree murder by abuse or neglect of a minor. First-degree murder by abuse or neglect constitutes when a perpetrator recklessly causes the death of a child through an act of abuse and/or neglect of the child or when the perpetrator has engaged in a previous pattern of abuse and/or neglect of the child. It is punishable by 15 years to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the same as second-degree murder. Second-degree murder by abuse or neglect constitutes when a perpetrator causes the death of a child through criminal negligence. It is punishable by 2 to 25 years in prison, the same as manslaughter.\nPenalties\nThe sentences for homicide offenses in Delaware are listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Offense\n!Mandatory sentence\n|-\n|Criminally negligent homicide\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Up to 8 years in prison\n|-\n|Second-degree vehicular homicide\n|-\n|First-degree vehicular homicide\n|Up to 15 years in prison\n|-\n|Manslaughter\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2 to 25 years in prison\n|-\n|Second-degree murder by abuse or neglect\n|-\n|Second-degree murder\n| rowspan=\"3\" |15 years to life in prison without parole\n|-\n|Official misconduct causing death\n|-\n|First-degree murder by abuse or neglect\n|-\n|First-degree murder\n|For adults: Life imprisonment without the possibility of paroleFor juveniles: 25 years in prison to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 15 years\n|}\nReferences"
