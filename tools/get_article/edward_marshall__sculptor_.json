He served as King's Master Mason from 1660 to 1666.\nLife\n]]\nHe was born in Nottinghamshire in 1598 but moved to London with his family and trained as a mason under Nicholas Stone from around 1612. He became a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Masons in 1626 and served twice as the Master of the company. He was further appointed Master Mason to King Charles II in 1660 and as such worked on several Royal palaces.\nHe had premises on Fetter Lane but lived in middle life (until 1659) at Barn Elms on the River Thames in Surrey. In his role as Master Mason to the Crown he worked on the Tower of London and several royal palaces and was paid a shilling a day. He stood down as King's Master Mason around 1666 probably due to age and the role passed to his son. No work is recorded in his name after 1666, the Great Fire of London. This is probably due to a number of factors: his stoneyard in London was within the heart of the fire; and his age (68).\nHe died in London on 10 December 1675. He was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West.\nWorks\n*Monument to Richard Braham in Windsor Parish Church (1618)\n*Monument to William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire at All Saints Church in Derby (1628)\n*Monument to the Earl of Totnes at Stratford-upon-Avon (1629)\n*Monument to Lady Anne Cutts of Horham Hall at Swavesey (1631)\n*Monument to Michael Drayton in Westminster Abbey (1631)\n*Monument to William Peck and his wife at Spixworth (1635)\n*Monument to Henry Saunders in St Mary Magdalen Church in Canterbury (1637)\n*Monument to Henry Curwen in Amersham (1638)\n*Monument to Lady Elizabeth Colepeper at Hollingbourne (1638)\n*Memorial brass in church floor to Sir Edward Filmer and Lady Filmer at East Sutton (1638)\n*Monument to Francis Williamson at Walkeringham (1639)\n*Monument to Lady Dorothy Selby at Ightham (1641)\n*Monument to Sir Robert Barkham and Lady Barkham in Tottenham Parish Church (1644)\n*Rebuilding of Aynhoe Park following damage in the English Civil War (c. 1647 – 1649)\n*Monument to the Howe family at St Michael's Church in Withington (1651)\n*Monument to Sir Robert Cotton at Connington (1655)\n*Main Portico and fireplaces at The Vyne (1656)\n*Monument to Bridget Gore (widow of the Lord Mayor of London) at Gilston (1657)\n*Monument to Sir Thomas Playters at Sotterley (1658)\n*Monument to Lady Frances Playters at Dickleburgh (1659)\n*Monument to Mrs Pagett at Windsor Parish Church (1666)\nFamily\nHe was married to Anne (d. 1673).
