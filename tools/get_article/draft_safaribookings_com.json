The website serves as a marketplace for safari tour operators, allowing travelers to compare and get in contact with safari tour operators across 18 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nHeadquartered in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands, SafariBookings was launched in 2013 by Dutch entrepreneur Wouter Vergeer, after he noticed a lack of good online resources for booking a safari. His aim was to create a website that would simplify the process of researching and booking safaris across the African continent.\nIn September 2014, the company surveyed 500 safari tour operators about the effects of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The study revealed that nearly half of the respondents experienced a drop in bookings ranging from 20% to 70%, despite the fact that most safari destinations were located far from the affected region.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, SafariBookings conducted a 27-month survey (March 2020 to May 2022) to assess the impact of the pandemic on African safari tourism and operations. The study involved 443 tour operators across the continent, and found that 90% of tour operators had experienced a minimum 75% drop in new bookings over the period.\nIn 2023, Botswana was ranked as Africa’s best safari country, according to a comprehensive study of over 4,000 reviews conducted by SafariBookings.\nIn 2024, in the platform's annual rankings of safari destinations, Serengeti National Park in Tanzania was ranked as the best safari park in Africa, based on an analysis of over 2,000 reviews.\nReferences"
