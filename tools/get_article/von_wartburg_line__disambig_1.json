This line enables a distinction between the northern and southern varieties of Gallo-Romance languages in the 9th century. It was identified for the first time by Jakob Jud.\n:1 Current limits of the Occitan language2 Old limits of the Occitan language3 Current limits of Franco-Provençal4 Old limits of Francoprovencal5 Southern limits of the French language in the 8th century (von Wartburg line)6 Southern limits of the French language in the 13th century7 Limits of Breton in the 19th century8 Limits of Breton in the 9th century9 Current limits of Germanic languages in France10 Historical extent of Oïl languages11 Historical extent of Germanic languages in France]]\nAccording to Walther von Wartburg, this linguistic border is the result of Frankish settlement \"north of the Loire River\" and corresponds to the political and ethnic border that took form around the year 500 between the Frankish kingdom of Neustria in the north, and Aquitaine and Burgundy in the south. For other linguists, the Vulgar Latin spoken in northern Gaul was already different before the Franks' arrival.\nWith time, this line moved south until becoming the current border of Oïl languages, and Occitan and Franco-Provençal.\nGeographical distribution\nThe von Wartburg starts from the mouth of the Loire, follows the river until the Sologne, before following the Loire again around Cosne-Cours-sur-Loire. From there, it continues north of the Morvan, leaving to the south a significant part of Burgundy and all of Franche-Comté before reaching the south of the Vosges.\nSee also\n* Gallo-Romance languages\n* Langues d'oïl\n* Franco-Provençal\nFurther reading\n* Walther von Wartburg, Die Entstehung der romanischen Völker, Max Niemeyer Verlag, 1939\n* Jean-René Trochet, Aux origines de la France rurale : outils, pays et paysages, CNRS éditions, Paris, 1993\nReferences"
