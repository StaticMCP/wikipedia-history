The 2010 season was the 6th in franchise history.\nThe Swarm didn't have a strong start to the 2010 season, losing four of their first five games. But after winning four of their next five to even their record at 5-5, they lost their last six games of the season, three of them in overtime, to finish with a 5-11 record. Despite the .313 winning percentage, the Swarm made the playoffs ahead of the 4-12 Colorado Mammoth. But in the playoffs, their losing streak continued, as the eventual champion Washington Stealth eliminated them with a 14-10 victory.\nRegular season\nConference standings\nGame log\nReference:\nPlayoffs\nGame log\nReference:\nTransactions\nNew players\n* Brock Boyle - acquired in trade\n* Ryan Benesch - acquired in trade\n* Ryan Hoff - acquired in trade\n* Richard Morgan - acquired in trade\n* Scott Self - acquired in trade\n* Sean Thompson - acquired in trade\n* Jay Thorimbert - acquired in trade\n* Alex Turner - acquired in trade\nPlayers not returning\n* Ian Rubel - traded\n* Ryan Ward - traded\nTrades\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" bordercolor=\"#DFDFDF\"  cellpadding=\"5\"\n| October 14, 2009\n| valign=\"top\"| To Minnesota Swarm Ryan HoffSecond round pick, 2011 entry draft\n| valign=\"top\"| To Rochester KnighthawksAaron BoldIan RubelCody Johnson\n|-\n| September 24, 2009\n| valign=\"top\"| To Minnesota SwarmSean Thomson\n| valign=\"top\"| To Philadelphia Wings Kevin ColleluoriThird round pick, 2010 entry draft\n|-\n| September 3, 2009\n| valign=\"top\"| To Minnesota SwarmRichard Morgan\n| valign=\"top\"| To Edmonton Rush First round pick, 2009 entry draft\n|-\n| September 3, 2009\n| valign=\"top\"| To Minnesota SwarmAlex TurnerAaron Bold\n| valign=\"top\"| To Washington Stealth Two first round picks, 2009 entry draft\n|-\n| August 13, 2009\n| valign=\"top\"| To Minnesota SwarmJay Thorimbert\n| valign=\"top\"| To Boston Blazers Second round pick, 2011 entry draft\n|-\n| July 7, 2009\n| valign=\"top\"| To Minnesota SwarmRyan BeneschScott SelfFirst round pick, 2009 entry draft\n| valign=\"top\"| To Edmonton Rush Ryan WardJustin NorbratenScott StewartRichard Morgan\n|}\nEntry draft\nThe 2009 NLL Entry Draft took place on September 9, 2009.
