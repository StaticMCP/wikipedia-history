It houses a little more than 2,000 students.  It is the only high school in the Newark City Schools district.\nAn additional 150 students attend the Career and Technical Education Center (C-TEC) associated with the school. Newark High School was built in 1959 and opened in 1961. The school underwent a massive construction project beginning in the Summer of 2010 and completed in the Spring of 2013 to convert the school into one building with 6 classroom wings, a student commons, a gymnasium, an auditorium, and the facility in which the entire district's lunches are produced. Newark plays division I athletics in the Ohio Division of the Ohio Capital Conference. Major athletics rivalries are with Lancaster High School and Zanesville High School.\nThe school's C-TEC satellite program includes a broadcasting department, which enables students to participate in activities such as operating a closed-circuit television station.\nThe school's Latin Club functions as a local chapter of both the Ohio Junior Classical League (OJCL) and National Junior Classical League (NJCL).\nNewark High School's Auditorium\nThe Lawrence E. Griffin Performing Arts Center was built in 1970. James Swearingen wrote the piece \"Proud Spirit\" for Lawence E. Griffin and was first performed by the Pride of Newark at the dedication of the auditorium. The NHS auditorium seats 1047 people. The first recording made there was of the NHS Choirs on April 28 and May 1, 1970.\nNotable alumni\n*Gary A.
