She was a daughter of King  of Navarre and Queen Jimena Fernández. Her brother was Sancho the Great, king of Navarre from 1004 until 1035. She and her husband were both the grandchildren of Urraca Fernández.\nWhen  first wife, Elvira Menéndez, died on 2 December 1022, Sancho immediately began planning the marriage of his sister to the widowed 28-year-old king. As Sancho was well acquainted with church reforms north of the Pyrenees and the new emphasis on non-consanguineous marriage, the proposed marriage presented difficulties. He sought the opinion of Bishop Oliba of Vic, to whom he sent two envoys, a nobleman named García and Abbot  of Sant Serni de Tavèrnoles, to stress the benefits of a marriage alliance between the two kingdoms. The response from Oliba, dated 11 May 1023, condemns the proposed union unequivocally. Nevertheless, the marriage went ahead. Urraca and Alfonso were married by 13 November.\nUrraca took over the raising of her stepchildren, Sancha and the future . She and Alfonso had only daughters. When Alfonso died in battle on 7 August 1028, she took on the regency for her eleven-year-old stepson. In documents, she is always called Queen Urraca and sometimes described as Vermudo's  or  (paternal aunt), which has been the source of some confusion. She is also described as  (Christ's handmaiden), indicating that she became a nun in widowhood. Her mother soon joined her in León. She was faced with several rebellions in different parts of the kingdom by Ero Salídiz, Oveco Rudesíndiz, Ecta Rapinátiz and Rodrigo Romániz. She responded to these challenges to her authority with force, bring Oveco to heel before the end of the year.\nSancho took advantage of his sister's regency to expand his influence in León. By 1029, he had taken control of the County of Castile in the name of his wife. According to the 12th-century Chronica Naierensis, the Castilians accepted his rule only because of Urraca. It was probably through her influence that by 1030 Sancho was able to extend Castile westward to the Cea. By 1032, documents from León itself and Astorga were recognizing Sancho as reigning.  Vermudo attained his majority between 10 May and 24 August 1032 and Urraca's regency came to an end.\nUrraca was still alive on 1 June 1035. Her date of death is unknown.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
