A committee approached the university's athletic council in early 1969 to gain approval for the university to begin sanctioning women's intercollegiate sports. Women's basketball, field hockey, and swimming were approved on an experimental two-year basis. Delaware played a six game season, finishing with a 1–5 record.\nRoster\nSchedule\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n| time         = 4:15 pm\n| nonconf      = yes\n| homecoming   =\n| away         =\n| neutral      =\n| rank         =\n| opponent     = Glassboro State College\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Hartshorn Gymnasium\n| site_cityst  = Newark, DE\n| gamename     =\n| attend       =\n| tv           =\n| score        = 37–67\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 0–1\n}}\n| time         = 7:15 pm\n| nonconf      = yes\n| homecoming   =\n| away         =\n| neutral      =\n| rank         =\n| opponent     = Wesley College\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Hartshorn Gymnasium\n| site_cityst  = Newark, DE\n| gamename     =\n| attend       =\n| tv           =\n| score        = 56–23\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 1–1\n}}\n| time         = 7:15 pm\n| nonconf      = yes\n| homecoming   =\n| away         = yes\n| neutral      =\n| rank         =\n| opponent     = Salisbury State College\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst  = Salisbury, MD\n| gamename     =\n| attend       =\n| tv           =\n| score        = 17–44\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 1–2\n}}\n| time         =\n| nonconf      = yes\n| homecoming   =\n| away         =\n| neutral      =\n| rank         =\n| opponent     = Catonsville Community College\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Hartshorn Gymnasium\n| site_cityst  = Newark, DE\n| gamename     =\n| attend       =\n| tv           =\n| score        = 54–69\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 1–3\n}}\n| time         =\n| nonconf      = yes\n| homecoming   =\n| away         = yes\n| neutral      =\n| rank         =\n| opponent     = West Chester State College\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst  = West Chester, PA\n| gamename     =\n| attend       =\n| tv           =\n| score        = 36–38\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 1–4\n}}\n| time         =\n| nonconf      = yes\n| homecoming   =\n| away         = yes\n| neutral      =\n| rank         =\n| opponent     = Millersville State College\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst  = Millersville, PA\n| gamename     =\n| attend       =\n| tv           =\n| score        = 43–54\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 1–5\n}}\nReferences"
