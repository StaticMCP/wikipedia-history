The franchise is owned by Javed Afridi, CEO of Haier Pakistan.\nPeshawar Zalmi won their first Pakistan Super League title in the 2017 season, defeating Quetta Gladiators in the final. Since then, the team has consistently remained one of the league’s strongest performers, qualifying for the playoffs in nearly every edition and reaching the final three times (2017, 2018, and 2021).\nThe team's home ground is the Arbab Niaz Stadium in Peshawar, which is currently undergoing redevelopment, while most home fixtures are played at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.

Following this, against Islamabad United, the Zalmis lost a hard-fought game that went down to the last ball.

In their final game of the Sharjah leg, the Zalmis continued their losing streak after being beaten by Karachi Kings in a thrilling contest. Setting up a target of 175 runs, the Kings had the Zalmis reduced to 69–6 before Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy combined in a 70-runs partnership that almost won the game for the Zalmis. However, they couldn't see the game through as the Zalmis fell short by 9 runs.\nWith the tournament shifting back to Dubai, the Zalmis registered consecutive wins against Lahore Qalandars and Quetta Gladiators respectively.

In reply Zalmi had a poor start losing 2 early wickets for less than 10 runs, then came Mohammad Hafeez who started hitting Gladiators all over the stadium he with Dawid Malan put up a 100+ runs partnership. After Hafeez got out Shahid Afridi came looking in best six hitting form scoring 34 off just 17 balls shifting match in Zalmi's favour, but got out at wrong time and as a result Zalmi collapsed in the last over of the match. Left arm spinner for Quetta, Muhammad Nawaz was the bowler who didn't let Zalmi score 2 runs off last 3 balls hence, Gladiators progressed into the final and Zalmi into the qualifier 2 where they defeated Karachi Kings by 24 runs.

Only Dwayne Smith's unbeaten innings of 71 runs got them to a respectable total of 131 runs.
