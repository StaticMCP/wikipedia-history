In the , Garfield had a population of 37 people.\nOn 22 November 2019, the Queensland Government decided to amalgamate the localities in the Barcaldine Region, resulting in five expanded localities based on the larger towns: Alpha, Aramac, Barcaldine, Jericho and Muttaburra. Garfield was mostly incorporated into Jericho, except for the western corner which was incorporated into Aramac.\nGeography\nThe Capricorn Highway and, immediately south, the Central Western railway line form the southern boundary of the locality.\nThe Great Dividing Range passes through the north-east of the locality.\nThe Alice River flows through the locality entering from the north-east (Dunrobin) and exiting to the south-west (Grant). It is part of the Lake Eyre drainage basin.\nThe principal land use in grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe town and the parish take their name from a pastoral run named by Thomas Behan in 1886 after the American President James Abram Garfield.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Garfield. The nearest primary school is in neighbouring Jericho and the nearest secondary schools are in Alpha (to Year 10 only) and Barcaldine (to Year 12). However, due to travelling times, boarding schools and distance education are other options.\nReferences"
