These sites have been declared subsequent to the implementation of the new legislation on 1 April 2000 and unlike those in the SAHRA portion of the list are not former national monuments declared by the former National Monuments Council, the predecessor of both SAHRA and Heritage Western Cape.  In the instance of these sites the \"identifier\" code used is that of Heritage Western Cape rather than SAHRA.\n| image =\n}}\n| image = Sexton's House.JPG\n|commonscat=Sexton's House, Strand Street\n}}\n|}\nReferences"
