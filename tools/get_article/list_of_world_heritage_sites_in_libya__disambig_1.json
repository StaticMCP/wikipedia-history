Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Libya accepted the convention on 13 October 1978. There are five World Heritage Sites in Libya, with a further three on the tentative list.\nThe first three sites in Libya were added to the list in 1982 and the most recent one in 1986. All five sites are listed due to their cultural significance. In 2016, all five sites were listed as endangered because of the instability due to the Libyan civil war. In 2025, Ghadames was removed from this list due to extensive restoration efforts by local authorities and several partners.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\nIn danger|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (district)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"|Archaeological Site of Leptis Magna\n|\n| Murqub\n| 1982\n| 183; iii, v vi (cultural)\n| Leptis Magna was founded as a Phoenician settlement LPQ and came under the Romans in 46 BCE. It was the birthplace of the Septimius Severus. After becoming the Emperor in 193, he rebuilt and enlarged the city and made it one of the most beautiful cities of the Roman world. It is one of the best examples of Roman urban planning. It was pillaged in the 4th century, reconquered by the Byzantines, and was finally abandoned following the Arab invasion. The ruins of the Roman theater are pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"|Archaeological Site of Sabratha\n|\n| Zawiya\n| 1982\n| 184; iii (cultural)\n| Founded as a Phoenician trading post and then part of the Numidian Kingdom of Massinissa, Sabratha got absorbed in the Roman province of Africa in 46 BCE. It was prospering in the 2nd and 3rd centuries when numerous monuments were constructed, including a theatre with three orders of columns (pictured). Its fortunes turned in the 4th century with the decline in trade. In 455, the city was conquered by the Vandals. It later saw another stable period under the Byzantines until it was ultimately abandoned after the Arab invasions between the 7th and 11th centuries.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"|Archaeological Site of Cyrene\n|\n| Jabal al Akhdar\n| 1982\n| 190; ii, iii, vi (cultural)\n| Cyrene was founded as a Greek colony of Thera in 631 BCE. It was a major city of the Hellenistic and later Roman world. It was heavily damaged during the Jewish revolt in 116 and rebuilt under Hadrian. Its decline began with the massive 365 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the city. Monuments in the city include the Greek temples of the 7th and 6th centuries, Roman baths, a Greek theatre converted into a Roman one, and a Roman forum. The Temple of Zeus is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"|Rock-Art Sites of Tadrart Acacus\n|\n| Ghat\n| 1985\n| 287; v (cultural)\n| The rock paintings and engravings in the Acacus Mountains were created over thousands of years, from 12,000 BCE to 100 CE. They can be divided into very distinct phases with different motifs and artistic styles that reflect the changes of the local climate, flora, fauna, and the way of life of the locals during and after the African humid period. The oldest paintings depict large mammals of savanna, such as giraffes and elephants, while later paintings focus on herds of cattle, horses, and finally on dromedary camels of a desert climate.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Old Town of Ghadamès\n|\n| Nalut\n| 1986\n| 362; v (cultural)\n| The oasis town of Ghadamès is one of the oldest and most important cities of the Sahara. It has been occupied since at least the late 1st millennium BCE and was serving as a hub of the trans-Saharan trade network. The town has developed its unique architecture, adjusted to the harsh desert climate. A typical feature are multi-storey houses where the ground floor is for storage, first floor is for families, and the open terraces are for the use of women. Ghadamès has the nickname \"the Pearl of the Desert\" by Arab sources. Listed as endangered in 2016 due to the conflict in the country at that time, wildfires and torrential rain, it was removed from the list in danger in 2025 due to extensive restoration efforts by local authorities and several partners.\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Libya maintains three properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (district)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Archaeological site of Ghirza\n|\n| Misrata\n| 2020\n| ii, iii (cultural)\n| The settlement of Ghirza was a part of the southern border of the Roman Empire, the Limes Tripolitanus, as organized by the Emperor Septimius Severus . The remains of the settlement have been well preserved, with civil buildings and numerous monuments. It illustrates the adaptation of Roman engineering approaches to the local environment, with aspects such as water management. The findings in the two extensive necropolises demonstrate a dynamic interchange between the Romans and the local populations.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Archaeological Site of Ptolemais\n|\n| Marj\n| 2020\n| ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n| Ptolemais was founded as a Greek colony in the 7th century BCE. It was one of the five important cities that formed the Pentapolis of Cyrenaica. It flourished during the Hellenistic and later Roman periods and in the 4th century surpassed Cyrene that was damaged by earthquakes. It was also an important Early Christian diocese. It continued to be inhabited until the 14th century. The remains of the city illustrate the cohabitation of different faiths and cultures. Monuments from different time periods have been preserved, including a unique type of a mausoleum.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Haua Fteah Cave\n|\n| Derna\n| 2020\n| ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n| The cave is an archaeological site with a  deep record spanning over 150,000 years. It includes traces of occupation by anatomically modern humans, stone flake tools of from the Middle Paleolithic, stone blades from the Upper Paleolithic, and the beginning of farming 10,000-7000 years ago. It also provides a record of the climate in the region, including the humid periods (\"green Sahara\") which allowed people to cross what is today a desert.\n|}\nReferences"
