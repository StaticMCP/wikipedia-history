Produced by Lou Adler, it was released on February 10, 1971, by Ode Records. The album's lead single, \"It's Too Late\" / \"I Feel the Earth Move\", spent five weeks at number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts.\nThe album has received critical acclaim since its release and is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of all time. It won four Grammy Awards at the 14th Annual Grammys in 1972, including Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. Tapestry has been certified 14× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. In 2000, it ranked 74th in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums, and in 2020, it ranked 25th on Rolling Stones list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 1998, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\nProduction\nCarole King wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the album. Two songs were co-written with Toni Stern: \"It's Too Late\" and \"Where You Lead\"; King wrote the music and Stern the lyrics. King's ex-husband Gerry Goffin co-wrote the lyrics for three of the songs, two of which had already been hits for other artists: Aretha Franklin's \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" (in 1967), and The Shirelles' \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" (in 1960).\nJames Taylor, who encouraged King to sing her own songs and who also played on Tapestry, had a number one hit with \"You've Got a Friend\" later in 1971.\nThe album was recorded at A&M Recording Studios' Studio B in January 1971 with the support of Taylor, Joni Mitchell, and various experienced session musicians. Several of the musicians worked simultaneously on Taylor's album Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon.\nA&M staff photographer Jim McCrary took the cover photograph in the living room of King's home at 8815 Appian Way, Laurel Canyon, California. It shows her sitting barefoot on a cushion on a bench beside a window, holding a tapestry that she hand-stitched herself, with her cat Telemachus, named after the mythological son of Odysseus, near her foot.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = ''Christgau's Record Guide\n| rev2Score = A−\n| rev3 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev3Score =\n| rev4 = The Great Rock Discography\n| rev4Score = 8/10\n| rev5 = Music Story\n| rev5Score =\n| rev6 = MusicHound Rock\n| rev6Score =\n| rev7 = Pitchfork\n| rev7score = 10/10\n| rev8 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev8Score =\n| rev9 = Uncut\n| rev9Score =\n}}\nThe album was met with widespread critical acclaim; Village Voice critic Robert Christgau felt that her voice, free of \"technical decorum\", would liberate female singers; Jon Landau of Rolling Stone wrote that King was one of the most creative pop music figures and had created an album of \"surpassing personal-intimacy and musical accomplishment\".\nAwards\nAlong with being selected Album of the Year, Tapestry'' received Grammys for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, Record of the Year (\"It's Too Late\"), and Song of the Year (\"You've Got a Friend\") at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards, making King the first solo female artist to win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Song of the Year.\nThe album remained on the Billboard charts for 313 weeks (second only to Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon's 724 weeks).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Grammy Awards nominations for Tapestry\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Year\n!align=\"left\"|Winner\n!align=\"left\"|Category\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" align=\"left\" |1972\n|align=\"left\"|Tapestry\n|align=\"left\"|Album of the Year\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"It's Too Late\"\n|align=\"left\"|Record of the Year\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|\"You've Got a Friend\"\n|align=\"left\"|Song of the Year\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Tapestry\n|align=\"left\"|Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female\n|}\nCommercial performance\n|width=23%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\nTapestry was a huge commercial success. It spent 15 consecutive weeks at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. It still holds the record for most consecutive weeks at number one by a female solo artist. The album also spent more than six years on the Billboard 200 chart (318 weeks), including 302 consecutive weeks. For more than 40 years, it held the record for the longest-charting album by a female solo artist in the U.S., until Adele's 21 broke the record in 2017. As of 2021, Tapestry was certified 14 times platinum in the U.S. and had sold around 25 million copies worldwide.\nIn Canada, Tapestry spent nine weeks at number one beginning July 3, 1971. It was on the Top 100 chart from April 14, 1971, to January 20, 1973, and again from September 22, 1973, to February 16, 1974. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 32 on UK Albums Chart and eventually rose to number four, spending 136 weeks in the Top 100.\nCultural impact\n| width = 25%\n}}\nKing had been writing hit songs for a decade, but Tapestry was her first project to win her international acclaim as a singer. Several songs from the album were recorded by other artists and became hits while the album was still on the charts: James Taylor's 1971 recording of \"You've Got a Friend\" from Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon hit number one in the U.S. and number four in the U.K., and Barbra Streisand's 1971 studio recording of \"Where You Lead\" from her album Barbra Joan Streisand reached number 40, while a live recording of a medley in which Streisand paired the song with the Sweet Inspirations hit \"Sweet Inspiration\" from her album Live Concert at the Forum reached number 37 the following year.\nVarious artists have combined to rerecord more than one tribute album. The first, released in 1995 and titled Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King, was certified gold. The second, in 2003, was titled A New Tapestry – Carole King Tribute. In 2010, Australian recording artist Marcia Hines recorded a tribute album, Marcia Sings Tapestry.\n:\"My mum loved Carole King's Tapestry. That was always in the house.\" —Amy Winehouse\n\"Her songs are like stories or sonic movies\", Tori Amos said. \"You want to walk into them. With 'I Feel the Earth Move' or 'It's Too Late', you're right there.\"\nTapestry has appeared on critics' lists of the best albums. In 2003, it ranked 36th on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining that rating in a 2012 revised list and moving up to 25th in a 2020 revision. The album was also listed 39th by VH1 on its list of 100 Greatest Albums, and was one of 50 recordings chosen to be added to the National Recording Registry. Recordings added to the National Recording Registry are picked to be preserved in the Library of Congress, as they are \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important.\"\nIn 2015, for its sixth and final season, American TV series Glee paid tribute to this album, alongside Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill, in its episode \"Jagged Little Tapestry\". Five songs from Tapestry are performed by various artists. Two of them, \"It's Too Late\" and \"So Far Away\", are performed on their own, while the other three are used in a mashup with a song from Jagged Little Pill. \"I Feel the Earth Move\" is mashed up with \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\" with \"Head Over Feet\", and \"You've Got a Friend\" with \"You Learn\". The episode was watched by 1.98 million viewers and received a 0.7/2 in the adult 18-49 demographic.\nIn March 2016, it was announced that King would perform the album live in its entirety for the first time at the British Summer Time Festival in Hyde Park, London, on July 3, 2016. The performance was released the following year as Tapestry: Live at Hyde Park.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Carole King except where noted.\n| title1        = You've Got a Friend\n| length1       = 5:09\n| title2        = Where You Lead\n| length2       = 3:20\n| writer2       = Stern, King\n| title3        = Will You Love Me Tomorrow\n| writer3       = Gerry Goffin, King\n| title4        = Smackwater Jack\n| length4       = 3:42\n| writer4       = Goffin, King\n| title5        = Tapestry\n| length5       = 3:15\n| title6        = (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\n| length6       = 3:59\n| writer6       = Goffin, King, Jerry Wexler\n}}\n2008 \"Legacy Edition\"\nIn 2008, Sony/BMG, Epic, and Ode released a two-disc \"Legacy Edition\".
