Contralesa helped to form the anti-apartheid front in the homelands, and continues to advocate greater rights for traditional leaders in the country in the post-apartheid era.\nIt also participates in both national and provincial traditional leaders' gatherings to garner support for legislation from non-Contralesa members.\nLGBT issues\nContralesa has frequently taken a stance against the recognition of LGBT rights.\nStatements by King Goodwill Zwelethini\nContralesa members criticised LGBT rights advocate groups for criticising Zulu traditional king Goodwill Zwelethini kaBhekuzulu, and contended that the translation by the journalist recording the statements was inaccurate.\nProposal to amend Section 9 of the Constitution\nIn 2012, Contralesa, through the NHTL, filed a draft document calling for the removal of LGBT rights from the Constitution of South Africa. The group submitted a proposal to the Constitutional Review Committee of the National Assembly to amend section 9 of the Constitution; the committee, at the time, was chaired by Sango Patekile Holomisa MP, who is also president of Contralesa. Holomisa made comments pursuant to Contralesa's attempt.\nContralesa and Holomisa's comments were criticized by the Democratic Alliance and constitutional law scholar Pierre de Vos.\nSee also\n*National House of Traditional Leaders\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://contralesa.org/ Contralesa]"
