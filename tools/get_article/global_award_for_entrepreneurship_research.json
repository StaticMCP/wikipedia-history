Established in 1996, it aims to promote the advancement of knowledge in entrepreneurship and to encourage research efforts in the field.\nThe Prize\nThe recipient of the Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research is awarded a prize sum of 100,000 Euros.  Recipients also receive a reproduction of Swedish Sculptor Carl Milles' The Hand of God.\nThe History of the Award\nDuring the Internal Conference for Small Business's World Conference in 1996, a proposal was made to create an award to recognize excellence in research in the field of entrepreneurship and small business. The award aimed to emphasize the importance of entrepreneurship research, stimulate and promote further research in the field, and disseminate state-of-the-art research among scholars, practitioners, and small business developers. The International Award for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research was established in that same year in 1996.  In 2008 the award was renamed the Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research, and the monetary prize was increased in value to €100,000.\nAward Process and Selection\nThe Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research has been considered the premier prize in its field. The award is presented annually with a ceremony typically held in Stockholm with the award being presented by the Minister of Sweden's Ministry of Enterprise and Education.  The current awardee presents a prize lecture after receiving the award.\nThe Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the field of entrepreneurship and small business development. The primary criterion for receiving the award is exceptional scientific achievement in entrepreneurship theory, methodology, and/or empirical research. The evaluation considers the following aspects:\n# The originality and innovativeness of the research.\n# The impact of the research on the scientific community and the advancement of entrepreneurship as a field of study.\n# The practical relevance of the research for policymakers, educators, and practitioners in the field of entrepreneurship.\nEach year, leading entrepreneurship scholars worldwide are invited to nominate candidates. A Prize Committee, consisting of six to eight members who are full professors at Swedish universities working on small business and entrepreneurship issues, selects the winner.\nAward Founders\nThe award was founded two non-profit research organizations, the Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum  and the Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN) Vinnova, the Swedish governmental agency responsible for promoting innovation was added later as an award sponsor.\nList of Global Award for Entrepreneurship recipients\nSource:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Award Recipient\n!Affiliation (when awarded)\n|-\n|2024\n|Michael Frese & Robert Baron\n|Asia School of Business & Oklahoma State University\n|-\n|2023\n|Per Davidsson\n|Queensland University of Technology\n|-\n|2022\n|Saras Sarasvathy\n|University of Virginia Darden School of Business\n|-\n|2021\n|Cancelled\n|N/A\n|-\n|2020\n|John Haltiwanger\n|University of Maryland, College Park\n|-\n|2019\n|Boyan Jovanovic\n|New York University\n|-\n|2018\n|Olav Sorenson\n|Yale University\n|-\n|2017\n|Hernando de Soto\n|Institute for Liberty and Democracy\n|-\n|2016\n|Philippe Aghion\n|Collège de France\n|-\n|2015\n|Sidney G.
