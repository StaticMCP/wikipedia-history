The BWAA votes on the best fight of each year regardless of the weight class or nationality of the fighters.\nThe award was originally named for Harry Markson, a boxing promoter and publicist who served for five years as the president of boxing operations at Madison Square Garden. In 2009, the award was renamed the Ali–Frazier Award in honor of Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, and their epic fight trilogy including the Fight of the Century. The award is presented with other honors given by the BWAA at an annual awards dinner.\nPast recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Date\n!Location\n!Winner\n!Loser\n!Result\n!Weight
