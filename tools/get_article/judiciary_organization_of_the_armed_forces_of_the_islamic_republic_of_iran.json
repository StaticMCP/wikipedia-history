Provided that there is enough evidence to certify the offence, the case, after the issuance of an indictment, is sent to the court-martial where after a trial an appropriate verdict is issued.\nHearing in courts-martial is carried out according to the criminal procedure and the accused ones can enjoy having lawyers during the entire trial procedure.
