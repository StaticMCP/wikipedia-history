Lilly Sr., the son of Eli Lilly. He proposed the memorial in 1931.\nCarillon\nThe carillon was originally constructed by J. C. Deagan, Inc. for the spire of the Florida exhibit building at the 1939 World's Fair. It had 75 bells, weighed 25 tons, and was the largest carillon in the world (by number of bells). It was a gift of Florida's Stephen Foster Memorial Association, who intended to place it at a new Foster memorial building in White Springs after the fair.\nThe installation in at the Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park didn't occur until the summer of 1958; by which the bell count had increased to 97. More than a year was required by Deagan craftsmen to build the huge set of bells, perhaps the greatest single manufacturing project in the firm’s 78-year history.\nThe carillon plays Foster's songs throughout the day. A second museum area inside the tower also features exhibits about Stephen Foster and the carillon. The carillon was damaged by an electrical storm in 2017, repairs have begun to restore the bells.\nGallery\nFile:Stephen Foster FCCSP Suwannee01.jpg|Suwannee River\nFile:Stephen Foster FCCSP museum01.jpg|Stephen Foster Museum\nFile:White Springs FL spring house04.jpg|Spring House, from the historic health resort\nSee also\n* List of music museums\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/stephen-foster-folk-culture-center-state-park Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park] at [https://www.floridastateparks.org Florida State Parks]\n* [http://www.floridaparks.com/floridastateparks/north_east/stephen_foster_state_folk_culture_center_photos1.html Photos of Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park] at [http://www.floridaparks.com Florida Parks]\n* [http://www.abfla.com/parks/StephenFoster/stephenfoster.html Stephen Foster State Folk Culture Center] at [http://www.abfla.com Absolutely Florida]\n* [http://areas.wildernet.com/pages/area.cfm?areaID=FLSPSC&CU_ID=1 Stephen Foster State Folk Culture Center] at [http://www.wildernet.com Wildernet]\n*[http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/stephenfoster Explore Southern History - Information on Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park]"
