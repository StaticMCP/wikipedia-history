It began on November 15, 2007, and ended on April 30, 2008, with the exception for Mauritius and the Seychelles, which ended May 15. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of 90°E and south of the Equator. Tropical cyclones in this basin are monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Réunion.\nThis timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipations in the basin.\n__TOC__\nTimeline\nOctober\n;October 11\n:1200 UTC&nbsp;- The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Mauritius begins issuing advisories on a tropical disturbance while located 785&nbsp;km (490&nbsp;mi) southeast of the Seychelles.\n;October 12\n:0600 UTC&nbsp;- Météo-France designates the disturbance as Tropical Disturbance 01-20072008.\n;October 13\n:1200 UTC -
