That includes actual law reforms as well as other formal changes, such as reforms through new interpretations of laws by precedents.\nFormal changes and reforms regarding women's right to vote are exempted from this timeline: for that right, see ''Timeline of women's suffrage.

Article 303-304: \"If the mother who gave birth to a premature or dead infant used prior to that, knowingly, alone or with someone else, internal or external means, [means that] can cause a premature delivery or the death of the fetus in the mother's abdomen, she is punished with imprisonment. The same penalty is imposed on the midwives or pharmacists or others in the medical service who cause abortion with the consent of the pregnant woman or by recommending or by providing the means for performing such a felony.\" These sentences carried a maximum punishment of ten years for both the pregnant woman committing the act herself, as well as for any third party assistants.

The Penal Code of 1886 transposed, with little change, the abortion law of 1852.\n* Austria: For more than a century, the Austrian abortion policy was largely governed by the 1852 legislation that criminalized abortion. Both the woman willingly attempting to end her pregnancy and the individual conducting the abortion faced up to five years in jail. However, there were a few legal exceptions.

Half of the states passed similar anti-obscenity statutes that also banned possession and sale of obscene materials, including contraceptives.\n: The law was named after its chief proponent, Anthony Comstock.

The case is also notable for being an early 14th Amendment challenge to sex discrimination in the United States.
