The plenary power to grant a pardon or a reprieve is granted to the president by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution; the only limits mentioned in the Constitution are that pardons are limited to federal offenses, and that they cannot affect an impeachment process: \"The president shall ... have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\".\nThough pardons have been challenged in the courts, and the power to grant them challenged by Congress, the courts have consistently declined to put limits on the president's discretion. The president can issue a full pardon, reversing a criminal conviction (along with its legal effects) as if it never happened. A pardon can also be offered for a period of time to cover any crimes that may have taken place or stop any charges from ever being filed during that period. A pardon can be issued from the time an offense is committed, and can even be issued after the full sentence has been served. The president can issue a reprieve, commuting a criminal sentence, lessening its severity, its duration, or both while leaving a record of the conviction in place. Additionally, the president can make a pardon conditional, or vacate a conviction while leaving parts of the sentence in place, like the payment of fines or restitution. After George W. Bush attempted to rescind his pardon of Isaac Robert Toussie, the Department of Justice concluded that the pardon was not yet effective, since it had never been officially delivered to Toussie. Under this legal interpretation, posthumous presidential pardons appear to be merely ceremonial and have no effect, since they were never delivered to the recipient.\nPardons granted by presidents from George Washington until Grover Cleveland's first term (1885–89) were handwritten by the president; thereafter, pardons were prepared for the president by administrative staff requiring only that the president sign it. The records of these presidential acts were openly available for public inspection until 1934. In 1981, the Office of the Pardon Attorney was created and records from President George H. W. Bush forward are listed.\nSummary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=20% | President\n!width=20% | Tenure\n!Pardons or clemency\n!class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Washington, George\" | George Washington || 1789–1797 || 16 ||\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Adams, John\" | John Adams || 1797–1801 || 20 ||\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Jefferson, Thomas\" |Thomas Jefferson || 1801–1809 || 119 ||\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Madison, James\" |James Madison || 1809–1817 || 196 ||\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Monroe, James\" |James Monroe || 1817–1825 || 414 ||\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Adams, John Quincy\" |John Quincy Adams || 1825–1829 || 183 ||\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Jackson, Andrew\"|Andrew Jackson || 1829–1837 || 386 ||\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Van Buren, Martin\"|Martin Van Buren || 1837–1841 || 168 ||\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Harrison, William Henry\"|William Henry Harrison || 1841 || 0 ||\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Tyler, John\"|John Tyler || 1841–1845 || 209 ||\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"Polk, James K.\"|James K.
