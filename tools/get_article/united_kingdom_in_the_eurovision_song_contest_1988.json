The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.\nBefore Eurovision\nA Song for Europe 1988\nSubmissions and selection\nA total of 182 songs were submitted and at no time during the judging phase were the names of either the composers, authors or publishers divulged.\nOn the first listening phase, seven sessions at 26 songs per session were heard. Every song entered was played for 150 seconds each and voted upon. Eight judges consisting of music publishers' professional staff and members of the record buying public represented by staff of PRS and MCPS. When adding the votes, the MPA office checked whether any member of the panel had any interest in the songs and if found that an interest existed, that member's vote was replaced by an average mark. The twelve songs from each session with the highest points were put forward to the Second Listening.\nThe Second Listening consisted of four sessions with 21 songs per session. All songs reaching this stage were mixed and re-numbered so that they were not played in the same order as first listening. Songs were then played again for 150 seconds each and voted upon. Eight judges consisting of similar representatives as the first session but individuals called at different times so that they did not appear with the same people as previous voting. When adding these votes, the MPA office checked whether any member of the panel had any interest in the songs and if found that an interest existed, that member's vote was replaced by an average mark. Eleven songs from each session with the highest points went forward to Third Listening.\nWith the third listening, this consisted of one session divided into four sections at 11 songs per section, making a total of 44 songs. All songs reaching this stage were again mixed and re-numbered so that they were not played in the same order as previous listenings. The songs were played for two minutes each and voted upon. Fifteen judges consisting of similar representatives as previous sessions but also invited were special guests which included successful songwriters and record producers. No member serving on this panel had any interest in any of the songs. Top 3 from each session automatically put through to the final 20. Bottom 4 from each section were eliminated.\nMiddle 4 from each session put forward for Fourth listening.\nOn the Fourth Listening was one session of 16 songs. All songs reaching this stage were again mixed and re-numbered so that they were not played in the same order as previous hearings. Songs were played for 2 minutes each and voted upon. Continuation of third session and therefore the same judges were in attendance. The 8 songs with the highest score went forward to Fifth and final listening.\nThe Fifth Listening was consisted of one session of 20 songs to be reduced to 8 songs for the A Song for Europe broadcast. The listening was held at a meeting at the BBC Television Centre under the auspices of James Moir, Head of Variety. Judges consisting of Radio 2 and Television producers, representatives of the Music Publishers Association (MPA), British Phonographic Industry and British Academy of Songwriters Composers and Authors.\nThe final 8 competing entries were previewed on both Wogan and on BBC Radio 2.\nFormat\nThe 1987 contest was something of an experiment when compared to other contests of the era, with studio set was much larger, 10 songs were used instead of 8, and the songs were picked by the Music Publisher's Association, and the record industry, in order to have a selection of songs that were more contemporary pop, instead of just songs that could win the Eurovision Song Contest. All of this changed in 1988 as the 8 song format returned, the songs were screened by just the MPA, and as such the songs were less contemporary than in the previous contest. Also gone was the regional jury voting to decide the winner.\nFor the first time since 1975, the public voted on the songs, although this time it was by telephone voting instead of postcards. Also introduced was a celebrity panel, to comment on the songs. They had no role in the selection of the winner, merely to pass comment. The panel were Mike Batt who discussed songs 2 and 6, Bruce Welch who had been runner-up in the contest with The Shadows talked about songs 4 and 8, Gloria Hunniford who passed comment on songs 3 and 7 and George Martin who talked about songs 1 and 5.\nAdditionally for the first time, the phone numbers to call appeared on screen and prior to the end of part one, a reprise of all the competing songs was played. A total of 337,557 telephone votes were cast.\nFinal\nThe BBC held the final on 25 March 1988 at Studio 1 of the BBC Television Centre in London. It was hosted by Terry Wogan. The theme music and title sequence were the same the one used in the previous year, a revamped Te Deum. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all the songs, but despite performing live, the orchestra were off-screen, behind the set. The contest was broadcast on Radio 2 and BBC1.\nThe winner was chosen by televoting, which was \"Go\" performed by Scott Fitzgerald.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\"\n|+ A Song for Europe 198825 March 1988\n|-\n!
