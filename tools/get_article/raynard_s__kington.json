He received a Bachelor of Science degree at age 19 and a Doctor of Medicine degree at age 21. He completed a residency in internal medicine at Michael Reese Medical Center in Chicago. He was then appointed as a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. While at the University of Pennsylvania, he received a Master of Business Administration degree and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in health policy and economics from the Wharton School.\nCareer\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nFollowing appointments on the UCLA medical school faculty and as a senior scientist at RAND, Kington was director of the Division of Health Examination Statistics at the National Center for Health Statistics of the CDC where he also served as director of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1998 to 2000.\nNational Institutes of Health\nKington served in several leadership positions at the National Institutes of Health beginning in 2000, including principal deputy from 2003 to 2008. He led the agency as acting director from October 2008 until August 2009, when Francis Collins was appointed director. He continued to serve as principal deputy director until August 2010. Speaking of Kington's tenure at the agency, Senator Tom Harkin praised his leadership for judiciously allocating $10 billion in congressionally-approved funds, implementing then president Obama's Executive Order on human embryonic stem cell research, and strengthening conflict of interest regulations. As Deputy Director, he co-authored a study which found that Black scientists were less likely than White scientists to win approval of research grants, exposing racial discrimination in academia.\nGrinnell College\nOn February 17, 2010, the Board of Trustees of Grinnell College announced that Kington had been appointed as the incoming 13th president of Grinnell College, effective August 1, 2010.\nKington led an effort to invest $140 million in renewing the campus. During his presidency, he created a $300,000 annual prize to honor three persons throughout the world who have advanced the cause of social justice; the Grinnell College Innovator for Social Justice Prize has attracted substantial interest since its inception in 2010, and it has been cited as being the largest award of its kind by The Nation. In addition, Kington established a fund to spur innovation, oversaw the allocation of $140 million for campus buildings, and promoted ties to the city of Grinnell through investment programs. He faced criticism for his handling of an effort to expand the Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, there were no cases at Grinnell, but Kington and the administration asked students to go home and continue their learning online, as a general safety precaution.\nKington officially ended his presidency at Grinnell College on June 30, 2020.\nPhillips Academy Andover\nIn December 2019, Kington was appointed by the Board of Trustees as the 16th Head of School of Phillips Academy in Andover. He took over the role on July 1, 2020, succeeding John Palfrey. Kington is the first African-American and openly gay head of school since the academy was founded in 1778.\nKington has served on the governing council of the National Academy of Medicine and on the boards of the American Council on Education and the Des Moines Arts Center. He currently serves on the boards of RAND, Beth Israel Lahey Health, The Pew Charitable Trusts, and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.\nPersonal life\nKington is married to Peter T. Daniolos, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Iowa. They have two sons.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwI-Fm71ePE Raynard Kington's address to the Grinnell College community, February 17, 2010]\nReferences"
