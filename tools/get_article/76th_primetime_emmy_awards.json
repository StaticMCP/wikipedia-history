It was the second Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony held in 2024 due to the 75th ceremony, originally slated to broadcast on September 18, 2023, taking place four months later on January 15, 2024, as a result of the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. ABC broadcast the gala as part of a four-year rotation deal among the \"Big Four\" broadcast networks signed in 2018. The broadcast was made available for streaming on Hulu for the week following the ceremony.\nThe ceremony was produced by Jesse Collins Entertainment (Jesse Collins, Dionne Harmon, and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay) for the second consecutive year. Actor Eugene Levy and his son Dan were announced as co-hosts on August 16. It was the first time a father-and-son duo co-hosted an Emmy ceremony. According to Disney Entertainment chairperson Dana Walden, producers and network executives had asked comedian Jimmy Kimmel – who emceed the previous three ABC telecasts – to host the ceremony. However, Kimmel declined the offer saying he wanted to take a break after hosting the previous Academy Awards. Alex Rudzinski and Rickey Minor served as director and musical director for the ceremony, respectively. Two days before the ceremony, ABC aired a special episode of 20/20 entitled The 76th Emmys: A Night of Firsts. Hosted by Good Morning America co-anchor Robin Roberts, the special featured interviews with Eugene and Dan Levy and several of the ceremony's nominees. Roberts also co-hosted the network's red carpet arrivals special preceding the main telecast with ABC News journalist Will Reeve.\nBuilding from the previous year, producers Collins, Harmon, and Rouzan-Clay announced during a press conference that several of the awards would be presented by actors grouped by \"character archetypes\", such as TV moms, dads, and villains. Collins also revealed that the telecast would feature reunions in tribute to the 50th anniversaries of NBC variety/sketch program Saturday Night Live and ABC comedy series Happy Days, and the 25th anniversary of NBC drama series The West Wing. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Eugene Levy echoed the producers' decision to focus on history and nostalgia, saying, \"And [it's] also just paying tribute to television, certainly the nominees, but to the medium that gave us both our starts.\"\nCategories to be shown during the main broadcast were set in July 2024, with Outstanding Variety Special (Live) returning to the Creative Arts ceremony; as part of a rotation agreement with the Writers Guild of America, Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special also replaced Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series at the main ceremony.\nCritical reviews and viewership\nThe broadcast generally received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Allison Herman of Variety compared the ceremony to the previous one noting, \"the 76th Emmys were a far less dynamic and more stilted watch than the January show.\" She also criticized production elements such as the music director's choices for presenters' walk on music, recurring sound technical issues, and the grouping of presenters based on character archetypes. Ben Travers of IndieWire found Eugene and Dan Levy's performances as hosts underwhelming, which was not helped by their reminder to the audience that \"they weren't stand up comedians, but actors acting like hosts.\" He reserved praise for several presenters such as Candice Bergen, Billy Crystal, and the cast of Only Murders in the Building, but he ultimately found the ceremony to be \"another awards show resigned to its diminishing fate.\"  Lili Loofbourow, writing for The Washington Post, found the hosts to be \"pleasant but forgettable\" and that the onslaught of repeat winners bogged down the ceremony.\nIn a more positive review, Judy Berman of Time complimented the Levys and said, \"The emcees imbued what is always a long night—and was, this time around, full of predictable wins—with many moments of lighthearted fun, without trying too hard to roast their fellow actors or land headline-making zingers.\" Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter called the ceremony \"an above-average show\", noting that surprise winners kept \"audiences on their toes\" and that they often gave the best speeches. However, he criticized the reunion tributes noting that the presenters' dialogue felt bland and poor written in comparison to the prior ceremony's tributes. He also called the choice of Jelly Roll's performance of \"I Am Not Okay\" \"tonally questionable\" and wrote that Jimmy Kimmel's tribute to comedian Bob Newhart \"absolutely warped the mood in a room that wasn't sure if this was the time to laugh about how often Jon Stewart wins Emmys.\" Robert Lloyd wrote in the Los Angeles Times that the telecast was a \"sweet, positive show that at the same time avoided the air of self-congratulation\". He noted the Levys' \"father-and-son dynamic\", with Dan's role as \"the hipper son\" and Eugene as the \"befuddled dad\", was at the heart of their shared time together.\nCompeting with a Sunday Night Football game on NBC, the ceremony was viewed by 6.9&nbsp;million people in the United States, making it the most-viewed Emmys in three years, representing a 54% increase over the previous year's ceremony. It also achieved a 1.03 rating among adults ages 18–49.\nIn Memoriam\nThe In Memoriam tribute, which featured singer Jelly Roll performing his song \"I Am Not Okay\", paid tribute to the following individuals:\n* Martin Mull – performer\n* Joyce Randolph – performer\n* Dan Wilcox – writer\n* Robert Butler – director\n* Jerry Foley – director\n* Jamie Kellner – executive\n* Stephanie Leifer – executive\n* Eric Gilliland – writer\n* Bob Ellison – writer\n* Piper Laurie – performer\n* E.
