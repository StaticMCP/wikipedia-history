The Punishment Due\" (also known as \"Holy Wars\") is a song by American thrash metal band Megadeth. Released in 1990, it is the opening track off the band's fourth studio album Rust in Peace (1990).\nMusic and lyrics\nThe song has an unusual structure: it opens with a fast thrash section, shifting at 2:26 after an acoustic bridge by Marty Friedman to a different, slower and heavier section called \"The Punishment Due\", interspersed by two guitar solos played by Friedman, before speeding up again with a third and final solo played during this segment by Dave Mustaine.\nThe lyrics deal with global religious conflict, particularly in Israel and Northern Ireland. In an interview with the UK magazine Guitarist, Dave Mustaine said that he was inspired to write the song in Northern Ireland, when he discovered bootlegged Megadeth T-shirts were on sale and was warned not to interfere, as they were part of fundraising activities for \"The Cause\" (i.e. the Provisional Irish Republican Army). \"The Punishment Due\" is based on the popular Marvel comic book character, the Punisher.\nLegacy\n\"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" is widely considered one of Megadeth's greatest songs and one of the greatest songs in metal. In 2012, Loudwire ranked the song number one on their list of the 10 greatest Megadeth songs, and in 2018, Billboard ranked the song number two on their list of the 15 greatest Megadeth songs. In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked the song number twenty-eight on their list of the 100 greatest heavy metal songs.\nA cover version of the song is playable in the band simulation game Rock Revolution. The master recording is purchasable as part of the Rust in Peace album pack on the Rock Band band simulation platform, is playable in the Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock game, where it appears in the story mode as part of the final boss medley alongside \"This Day We Fight!\" and \"Sudden Death\", and is available as DLC for Rocksmith 2014. The music video for \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" was filmed in August 1990 (around the time of the Gulf War in 1990). It depicts news footage of various armed conflicts, mainly from the Middle East interspliced with footage of the band playing and Mustaine engaging in a skydive.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Publication\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n! scope=\"col\"| Accolade\n! scope=\"col\"| Rank\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2022\n| Louder Sound\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | United States\n| The Top 20 Best Megadeth Songs Ranked\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2018\n| Billboard\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | United Kingdom\n| The 15 Best Megadeth Songs: Critic’s Picks\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2023\n| Rolling Stone\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | United States\n| The 100 Greatest Metal Songs\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 28\n|}\nTrack listing\n7-inch edition\n#\"Holy Wars...
