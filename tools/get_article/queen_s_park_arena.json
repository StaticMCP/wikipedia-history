In its time, the Queen's Park Arena hosted the New Westminster Bruins of the Western Hockey League and British Columbia Junior Hockey League teams the New Westminster Royals and the Royal City Outlaws. It hosted the New Westminster Lacrosse teams for more than 75 years, including the multi-Mann Cup champion New Westminster Salmonbellies of the Western Lacrosse Association.\nThe arena was also home to the professional New Westminster Royals, which played in the Pacific Coast Hockey League from 1945 to 1952 and the Western Hockey League from 1952 to 1959. In 1949, team director Doug Grimston insisted on the continuation of a smoking ban at the arena, and stated that he would take financial responsibility for lost attendance.\nIn 1967, the arena was used to hold a session of the British Columbia Legislative Assembly, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Mainland and Vancouver Island colonies uniting.\nReferences"
