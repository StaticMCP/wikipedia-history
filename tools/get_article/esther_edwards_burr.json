Esther Burr's journal is considered an important source in studies of American history and literature for its insight into a woman's daily life in the final years of the Thirteen Colonies, although it was not until 1984 that her journal was published in its entirety to the public. She was also the mother of third U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr Jr. and the wife of Princeton University President Aaron Burr Sr. whom she married in 1752, one year after she moved to Stockbridge in western Massachusetts.\nEarly life and family\nEsther Edwards was born in Northampton, Province of Massachusetts Bay, the third of the eleven children of Sarah (Pierpont) Edwards and the famed preacher of the Great Awakening, Jonathan Edwards. Esther was named after Edwards' mother and grandmother who came before her.  She initially grew up in the town of Northampton, but Jonathan Edwards had a falling out with the church in Northampton, the First Church of Northampton was unwilling for Jonathan Edwards to change his position on the Lord's table. This led to the Edwards family moving to the frontier settlement Stockbridge, Massachusetts in 1751, where she met Aaron Burr Sr. whom she married on June 29, 1752. Though the Edwards children were encouraged to read the Bible and engage in piety at all times, they were not kept in the dark about all forms of contemporary, non-religious culture. For instance, they were allowed to read novels, if their parents approved of their content, but Jonathan Edwards was still a rather strict father.\nEsther Edwards was never given a proper formal education, but she did receive quite an education at home. Both her parents were as interested in her writing ability. These writing abilities carried over to her adult life, evident in her journal, consisting of letters sent to her friend.\n.]]\nEsther was a member of the church at Stockbridge and Northampton, and later the church in Newark.\nIn May 1752, Esther received her first and only marriage proposal from Aaron Burr Sr., the president of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). They were married on June 29 that year. Their first child, a daughter named Sarah (nicknamed Sally) was born in 1754. Their son Aaron was born in 1756. The marriage seems to have been a happy one. However, Esther desperately missed her friends and close-knit family. Her new husband's duties frequently kept him away from home, and Esther found her own responsibilities as the wife of a university president and prominent minister. Esther managed the affairs of the household and hosted many of the scholars of the school at her home, which she thoroughly enjoyed due to being able to listen on the conversations between her husband and their guests about topics of religion. These continuous daily duties were so draining for her, that sometimes she didn't even have the strength to write a single line of a letter to a friend. Esther kept to a plain style, proudly asserting that she was a \"busy housewife.\"\nEsther Burr's daughter, Sarah, married Tapping Reeve, the founder of America's first law school Litchfield Law School and previously Aaron Jr. and Sarah's school tutor. Esther's son, Aaron, became the third vice president of the United States (1801–05) and is best known for fatally wounding American politician Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804.\nHer journal\nLike the earlier journal of Sarah Kemble Knight in 1704–1705, Esther Burr's Journal provides insight into a woman's daily life in the late colonial period of the United States.  Esther Burr's Journal might be called an epistolary diary, since, rather than being a traditional diary written as a private record for oneself, Esther Burr's Journal consists of daily letters exchanged with her childhood friend Sarah Prince in Boston from 1754 to 1757. In the Journal, Sarah Prince is referred to as Fidelia while Sarah refers to Esther as Burrissa most likely a reference to her last name after she married Aaron Burr Sr. Esther wrote about ordinary things that happened around her, but she also sometimes expressed original thoughts about serious topics in passing such as the dominant themes of loneliness and hardship of everyday existence as well as slavery.\nThat there exist multiple editions of Esther Burr's Journal can be somewhat confusing. In 1901, the president of Howard University, Jeremiah Rankin, published a book which, despite being entitled ''Esther Burr's Journal'' is actually a fictionalized account of Esther's life. It was not until 1984 that Esther Burr's Journal was published in its entirety by Carol F. Karlsen and Laurie Crumpacker, but this book is no longer in print and it is quite hard to find a copy in good condition.\nDeath\nIn September 1757, Aaron Burr Sr. died of a fever in Princeton. Esther's father, Jonathan Edwards, came to Princeton to be Burr's successor as president of the college, but died on March 22, 1758, due to complication following a smallpox inoculation). Barely a fortnight after the sudden death of her father, Esther also fell ill and died on April 7, 1758, after \"a few days illness\". She was seized with a fever, apparently not linked to her recent smallpox inoculation, which produced a violent headache and then delirium.  Her sister Sarah believed it was not unlike the sudden fever from which her sister Jerusha had died.  Esther's death left her two children, Aaron and Sarah Burr, as orphans. Aaron and his sister went to live with their wealthy maternal uncle Timothy Edwards in a cramped, crowded environment. Sarah Edwards, Esther's mother, died soon after in October 1758. Esther, along with the rest of the Edwards family, were buried together at the Bridge Street Cemetery in Northampton.\nSarah Prince was nearly inconsolable by Esther's death. In her personal book of meditations, she wrote, \"My whole dependance for Comfort in this World [is] gone...\", and \"[Esther] was dear to me as the Apple of my Eye- she knew and felt all my griefs...\"\nIn popular culture\nTheatre and film\nas Esther's son Aaron Burr in Hamilton.]]\nAaron Burr Jr. is a feature character in the hit Broadway musical \"Hamilton\", played by Leslie Odom Jr. Aaron mentions his mother twice in the first half of the musical. Esther is personified by a female ensemble member during the song \"Wait For It\"  when Aaron sings the lines \"My mother was a genius\" and \"when they [Esther Edwards Burr and Aaron Burr Sr.] died they left no instructions, just a legacy to protect\". Esther is also briefly mentioned in the song \"Aaron Burr, Sir\", when Aaron says it was his parents' dying wish for him to attend Princeton University.\nReferences"
