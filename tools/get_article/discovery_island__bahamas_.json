The western portion of the Island is Balmoral Island, a shore excursion for Royal Caribbean cruise lines.  The eastern portion is Sandals Island and is owned by the Sandals Royal Bahamian Resort.\nIt has an estimated surface area of 11 hectares (equivalent to 0.11 square kilometres) with an interior lagoon and 2 nearby islets. Discovery Island features a flat geography, typical of Bahamian cays, with white sandy beaches, coastal vegetation, and shallow turquoise waters. Its proximity to Nassau makes it a popular destination for day trips, water activities, and luxury tourism. Although it lacks significant elevations or rivers, its marine surroundings are rich in coral reefs and underwater life.\nThe island is just a few minutes away by boat from the coast of New Providence, making it easily accessible from resorts and tourist ports. It is surrounded by smaller islands and cays, forming part of the coastal ecosystem that defines the Bahamas. Its geography reflects the environmental fragility of the archipelago, which is vulnerable to rising sea levels and tropical weather events.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.sandals.com/royal-bahamian/private-island/ Sandals offshore island official site]"
