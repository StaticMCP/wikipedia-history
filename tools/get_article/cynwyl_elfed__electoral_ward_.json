The total population was 2,985, of whom 66.0% were born in Wales. The 2011 census indicated that 54.3% of the population were able to speak Welsh.\nA 2019 boundary review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales recommended the Newchurch and Merthyr community be removed from Cynwyl Elfed and added to the neighbouring Trelech ward. The change was to take effect from the May 2022 local elections.\nCurrent Representation\nCynwyl Elfed is a single-member ward for the purposes of Carmarthenshire County Council elections. Since 2012 it has been represented by Independent councillor Irfon Jones.\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
