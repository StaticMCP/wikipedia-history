Kaidu's great-grandson was Khabul Khan (died 1149), great-grandfather of Genghis Khan (1162–1227).  His other great-grandson Khadjuli (died 12th century) was great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather of Timur (1330s–1405). Kaidu was succeeded by his son Bashinkhor Dogshin.\nLife\nKaidu is mentioned in the Secret History of the Mongols, the History of Yuan shi, and the Jami al-Tawarikh. He was born circa. 1025 as the youngest of the eight sons of Queen Monolun, the widowed wife of Khachi Khulug, son of Menen Dutum. At this time, the Liao Dynasty (907-1125) of the Mongolic Khitan had control over Mongolia, although the northernmost regions were difficult to keep under control. In the 1050s, the Khitans of the Liao Dynasty attacked the Jalair, a Darligin Mongol tribe living along the Kerulen River in the far-eastern region of Mongolia. The Jalair fled to the Borjigin Mongols led by Queen Monolun (Nomulun in the Secret History), the mother of Khaidu. They killed Monolun and all her sons except Kaidu who was hidden by his uncle Nachin. Khaidu later conquered the Jalair and made them his subjects.\nRashid Al-Din says in the Jami Al-Tawarikh:\nReferences\n;Further reading\n*\n* Groisset, René. \"The empire of steppes\""
