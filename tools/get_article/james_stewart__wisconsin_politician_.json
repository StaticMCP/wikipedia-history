He served one term in the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing Wisconsin's 32nd Assembly district during the 1983&ndash;1984 term.  He also served over 40 years on the Whitewater School Board.\nEarly life and military career\nJames Stewart was born in Kilmarnock, Scotland, in 1936.  His childhood was largely influenced by witnessing the effects of World War II in Scotland.  After the war, he emigrated to the United States with his parents and sister, settling in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1950.  Stewart graduated from Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart, a private Catholic school in Madison, and went on to earn his bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1959.\nWhile in college, Stewart enrolled in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, and he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Transportation Corps immediately after graduation.  He spent the next 20 years as a career Army officer.  During his service, his family often accompanied him to different bases, but he went unaccompanied for a tour in South Korea and two tours in Vietnam, where he earned a Bronze Star Medal with a \"V\" device.\nAfter his service in Vietnam, he was assigned to the Military Science program at University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, where he obtained an M.A. degree in 1975 and a M.S. degree in 1979.  In 1979, he retired from military service with the rank of lieutenant colonel.\nHe settled down permanently in Whitewater, Wisconsin.  He was hired as assistant registrar at the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, where he worked until his retirement in 2001.\nPolitical career\nIn 1981, he won his first public office when he was elected to the Whitewater School Board.  The following year, after a dramatic redistricting of the state legislature, he resided in an Assembly district which had no incumbent state representative living within its boundaries.  He declared his candidacy for the 32nd state Assembly district seat in 1982.  He faced no opposition in the Republican Party primary, and went on to a narrow win in the general election, receiving 50.8% of the vote over Democrat Joy Warfield.\nThe legislature went through another redistricting in 1983, and Stewart chose not to run for another term in the new district.  Stewart remained active in local politics and was a member of the Whitewater school board until his death, serving more than 40 years.\nPersonal life and family\nJames Stewart was one of two children born to William Stewart and his wife Agnes (' Manson).\nJames Stewart married Claire Hunold on August 29, 1959, at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in Madison.
