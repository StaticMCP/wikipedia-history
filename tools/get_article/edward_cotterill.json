George Cotterill, who became Canon of Christchurch. He was educated at Christ's College from 1865 to 1873.\nCotterill was a right-handed batsman. When he made his highest score of 75 not out in Canterbury's victory over Otago in 1885–86, it was the highest score of the short New Zealand first-class season. He captained Canterbury against Otago in 1888–89, scoring 45 in an innings victory. At this point in his career, after five first-class matches, he had scored 202 runs at an average of 50.50.\nCotterill also played football, representing Canterbury as a goalkeeper. He spent his working life with the Union Bank, mostly in Christchurch but with a period in Auckland. He died in Christchurch on 26 April 1904, and was buried at the Barbadoes Street Cemetery.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
