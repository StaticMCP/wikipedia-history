The band has described their sound as \"Blue Collar Thrash Metal\". They released four albums through Metal Blade Records and toured extensively before announcing a hiatus in 2022.\nHistory\nThe band was founded in 2003 by childhood best friends and neighbors Tony Asta and Hiran Deraniyagala in Canton, MI while attending Salem High School. In 2006, vocalist Marshall Wood was hired, bringing a new level of aggression which altered the vocal direction of the band. In 2007, drummer Mike Kreger was hired. In 2008, bassist Don Slater joined the band. Together, they played local shows around Detroit and in the Midwest and opened for such acts as Dying Fetus, GWAR, DevilDriver, The Absence, Vital Remains, and The Faceless.\nPursuit of Honor (2011)\nIn 2010, Battlecross self-released their debut album Push Pull Destroy. In late 2010, the band caught the eye of Metal Blade Records while members were replacing vocalist Marshall Wood, who left for family reasons. The band tapped Kyle \"Gumby\" Gunther of the Flint, MI-area band and management roster mate, I Decay, to front the band. Gunther stepped in to re-record the album and rewrote the track Aiden, renaming it Kaleb after his newborn son. The re-recorded album, Pursuit of Honor, was released in August 2011 by Metal Blade Records and was recorded at Random Awesome Recording Studio in Bay City, Michigan and produced by Josh Schroeder.\nPursuit of Honor produced three singles: \"Push Pull Destroy\", \"Man of Stone\" and \"Breaking You\", which combined spent 50 weeks on SiriusXM Liquid Metal 'Devil's Dozen' list of most requested songs, with 'Push Pull Destroy' at the #1 spot for five weeks in Spring 2012. The accompanying video received more than 1.8 million views on YouTube and was the break-out track for the band.\nValkyrian Music described it as \"perhaps one of the best albums on the modern thrash metal scene\" and claimed they could easily replace the Big Four of thrash metal if they kept making albums like Pursuit of Honor. The band and the debut also drew comparisons to metal groove metal bands such as Pantera and Lamb of God, with Metal Assault naming the record \"one of the most 'complete' heavy metal albums in recent times\" and \"bristling with fist-pumping, face-melting heavy metal at its finest.\" Blabbermouth reviewed the album as \"easily one of the better metal debuts of 2011\", stating that \"Pursuit of Honor will leave you breathless, maybe even skinless\" and giving the album an '8' rating. The website described the album as \"traditional thrash metal, but not in a retro wannabe sense, and is delivered in a package that is modern, yet avoids being too cookie-cutter; melodic, yet not 'pretty' or cleanly sung. Death metal heaviness with compositional skill, 'Pursuit of Honor' is above all else inanely energized.\"\nWar of Will (2013)\nIn early 2013, the band announced that they would enter the studio in March to record their follow-up to Pursuit of Honor. The band would begin tracking immediately after the \"Another Year, Another Tour\" with In Flames, Demon Hunter and All Shall Perish for 27 North American dates. Eyal Levi was to handle engineering duties on the record and Armored Saint’s Joey Vera, who mastered the band's cover version of Pantera’s \"Fucking Hostile\", would master.\nLewis, responsible for the production and/or engineering for bands such as The Black Dahlia Murder, Trivium, DevilDriver and Deicide, said: \"I can't wait to be a part of BATTLECROSS' next record. From the moment I heard the band I knew I wanted to be a part of their development. Hearing the new music has only solidified that feeling. Working with our good friends at Metal Blade and bringing great new music to the masses is what it's all about.\"\nAccording to statements made in the press, Metal Blade records President Michael Faley stated that the record would be released in time for the band's appearance on the Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival in July 2013.\nIn April 2013, the band's label issued a press release announcing that drummer Shannon Lucas, formerly of All That Remains and The Black Dahlia Murder, served as the session drummer on the newest Battlecross album, to be released in summer of 2013.\nThe new album's first single \"Force Fed Lies\" was released and made available for digital download on May 29, 2013.\nDrummer changes and 2014\n]]\nIn 2013, it was reported that drummer Michael Kreger had left the band to attend to personal business. Kevin Talley of Six Feet Under was announced as the touring drummer for the band for their New England Metal and Hardcore Festival and Orion Music + More appearances.\nTalley, who has also played with Dååth, Chimaira, Misery Index, Nothnegal and Dying Fetus, said: \"I'm stoked to play these shows with such an energetic and impressive band like BATTLECROSS. I had a chance to see them play on Trespass America and at the Scion A/V Metal Blade anniversary show and was blown away! New England Metal and Hardcore Festival and Orion Music + More are huge opportunities for the band and I'm honored to fill in behind the kit; they are definitely one of my favorite new bands!\"\nFollowing the departure of Michael Kreger, the band has gone through a cycle of touring drummers. Kevin Talley, formerly of Chimaira, filled in for the 2013 Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival. Following the tour and a show at GWARBQ 2014, Talley stepped down. When the band joined Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, and The Acacia Strain for a fall 2013 tour, drummer Adam Pierce of All Shall Perish stepped in as drummer for the band.\nIn 2014, Adam stepped down as the band's drummer, replaced by Shannon Lucas, session drummer from \"War of Will\". Lucas, already familiar with the material, stuck with the band up until summer 2014.\nDuring 2014, Battlecross saw a rise in popularity, hitting many tours along the way, including 2 tours in Europe, including a slot on the renown Download Festival held in Donington Park. While in Europe, the band hit many smaller venues with fellow Mayhem Festival tour mates Huntress. Following a return to the States, Battlecross continued to tour across America in direct support of Protest the Hero. During the tour, the band got an exposure increase from being on a bill with such a different style of metal. This spike in popularity led to a small headlining tour over the summer. Lucas withdrew from the band after the Protest the Hero tour, replaced by Alex Bent. Bent completed the headlining tour, which was Battlecross' first headline tour, with support from Ikillya. Canadian metal band Crimson Shadows were also supposed to be on the tour, but encountered problems getting access to the States. The tour also included a stop at Dirt Fest 2014.\nOn August 20, Battlecross performed in Mexico City, their first concert in the country, in support of Black Label Society. Following the show, they set off on a small South American tour in support of Killswitch Engage and Memphis May Fire. They then returned to the States for a fall tour opening for Machine Head, Children of Bodom, and Epica. The tour also included a stop at Fillmageddon in Silver Spring, MD.\nThe band also looked to close 2014 by entering the studio to start the recording of their third studio album.\nRise to Power, departure of Alex Bent, and indefinite hiatus (2015–2022)\nOn May 27, 2015, the band released a new single entitled \"Not Your Slave\", and revealed the title of their upcoming studio album as Rise to Power.\nAlex Bent left the band in 2015 and was replaced with Brian Zink.\nIn April 2016, the ensemble toured with Soulfly, Abnormality, Suffocation and Lody Kong.\nFrom October to November 2016, Battlecross went on tour with Soilwork and Unearth and announced a headlining tour with Allegaeon in support.\nIn January 2019, the ensemble indicated that they were working on new material.\nIn 2022, the band announced their annual “Battle Christmas” show would take place on December 9. They revealed the show would be their last \"for the foreseeable future\" and the band would then go on indefinite hiatus.\nTouring\nMembers\nFinal lineup\n* Tony Asta – lead guitar (2003–2022)\n* Hiran Deraniyagala – rhythm guitar (2003–2022)\n* Don Slater – bass (2008–2022)\n* Kyle \"Gumby\" Gunther – vocals (2010–2022)\n* Brian Zink – drums (2015–2022)\nFormer\n* Jay Saling – vocals, bass (2003–2006)\n* Jason Leone – drums (2003–2007)\n* Marshall Wood – vocals (2006–2010)\n* Mike Kreger – drums (2007–2013)\n* Mike Heugel – bass (2007–2008)\n* Shannon Lucas – drums (2013–2014)\n* Alex Bent – drums (2014–2015)\nLive\n* Josean Orta – drums (2012)\n* Adam Pierce – drums (2013)\n* Kevin Talley – drums (2013)\n* Joe Cady – lead guitar (2015)\nTimeline\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\" | Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | Heatseekers Albums\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | Billboard 200\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Push Pull Destroy\n|\n* Released:\n* Label: (Self-released)\n* Formats: CD, digital download\n| — || —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Pursuit of Honor\n|\n* Released:\n* Label: Metal Blade Records\n* Formats: CD, digital download\n| — || —\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | War of Will\n|\n* Released:\n* Label: Metal Blade Records\n* Formats: CD, digital download\n| 2 || 134\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Rise to Power\n|\n* Released:\n* Label: Metal Blade Records\n* Formats: CD, digital download\n| 4 || 137\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:90%\" | \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n|}\nDemos\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of extended plays\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18em;\" | EP details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Demo\n|\n* Released: 2005\n* Label: (Self-released)\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of singles, showing year released and album name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18em;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Album\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Hostile\"\n| 2012\n| Released through iTunes only\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Force Fed Lies\"\n| 2013\n| War of Will\n|}\nVideos\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of videos, showing year released\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18em;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Push Pull Destroy\"\n| rowspan=2 | 2011\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Kaleb\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Flesh & Bone\"\n| rowspan=2 | 2013\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Never Coming Back\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"My Vaccine\"\n| 2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Absence\"\n| 2015\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.metalblade.com/battlecross/ Battlecross on Metal Blade Records]\n*"
