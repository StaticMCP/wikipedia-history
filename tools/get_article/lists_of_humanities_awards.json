Typically these lists give the country of the sponsoring organization, the award name, sponsor name and a description of the award criteria. Some of the awards have broad scope, or cover the intersection of different disciplines, so an award may appear in more than one list. A list of general awards in the humanities is followed by the lists of more specific awards.\nGeneral list\n* List of general awards in the humanities\nSpecific lists\n* List of anthropology awards\n* List of archaeology awards\n* List of awards for contributions to culture\n* List of history awards\n* List of language-related awards\n* List of legal awards\n* List of literary awards\n**List of literary awards honoring women\n** List of poetry awards\n** List of writing awards\n* List of performing arts awards\n** Lists of acting awards\n** List of dance awards\n** List of music awards\n** List of theatre awards\n* List of philosophy awards\n* List of politics awards\n* List of religion-related awards\n** List of ecclesiastical decorations\n* Lists of art awards\nSee also\n* Lists of awards\n* List of media awards\n* List of social sciences awards\nReferences"
