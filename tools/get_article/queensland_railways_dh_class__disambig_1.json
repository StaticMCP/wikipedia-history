This was later purchased and by 1974, the 73 DH class locomotives had taken over shunting duties in most Queensland yards. They were also used on short-distance freight services. With the closure of many freight yards and the move to longer trains, withdrawals started in the 1980s. Many were sold for further use on Queensland sugar cane railways.\n*29 were rebuilt to  gauge for use at sugar mills around Queensland.\n*4 were rebuilt to  gauge for use on the Yallourn 900mm Railway in Victoria, and subsequently converted to  gauge for use at sugar mills in Queensland.\n*13 were exported to Vietnam and 2 to Malaysia as large diesel shunters for use on  gauge.\nPreservation\nDH2 is retained by the Queensland Rail Heritage division. Privately owned DH71 is also on site.\nDH14 was used at Old Ghan Heritage Railway and Museum, near Alice Springs, Northern Territory. Is stored due to trains not running. In preservation, it was painted in a variant of Australian National green and gold.\nIn 1995, DH59 was purchased by the Puffing Billy Railway, which operates in Victoria. It was re-gauged to , reclassified as Dh31 (stylised DH31), and is used as a replacement for steam locomotives on days of total fire ban. It has since been joined by DH5. DH59 initially ran in its original QR livery (albeit debranded), however has since been repainted into Victorian Railways blue and gold.\nAs of 2017, Dh31 is currently re-numbered back to its original DH59.\nIn 2010, the Walhalla Goldfields Railway in Victoria purchased DH37. The locomotive is stored on a section of  track in the Walhalla yard, awaiting re-gauging to the Walhalla Railway's  gauge. In June 2012, the Walhalla Goldfields Railway also bought DH72, which will also be stored until funds are available to re-gauge it to .\nDH38 spent the majority of its working life in the Northern part of the state, especially around the Mackay area. Following a major failure – notably a large hole blown in the engine block following a crankcase explosion – the locomotive was withdrawn on 5 July 1991. After purchase by the ARHS Qld, DH38 underwent a major restoration involving rebuilding the engine and electrical system as well as having all axles and wheels replaced due to cracks.\nDH41 was purchased by DownsSteam Toowoomba from Bundaberg Sugar in 2024 and is currently under restoration to mainline condition.\nDH45 was purchased by the Southern Downs Steam Railway in 2019 & is used as a backup for SDSR's C17 steam locomotive.\nDH71 has been purchased by DownsSteam Toowoomba as an addition to their diesel fleet. It currently resides undercover at the Ipswich Railway Workshops, awaiting transportation to their Drayton restoration base.\nDH73 has been acquired by DownerEDi Marybrough to be used as a shunting locomotive. It is named Hugh Boge.\nStatus table of preserved locomotives\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Number\n!Name\n!In service\n!Withdrawn\n!Notes\n|-\n|DH2\n|\n|1968-07-27\n|1991-04-03\n|Stored, Queensland Rail Heritage Division, dismantled, awaiting restoration at Workshops Rail Museum, North Ipswich\n|-\n|DH5\n|\n|1968-08-27\n|1992-07-07\n|Operational, Re-gauged to , at Puffing Billy Railway, Victoria\n|-\n|DH14\n|Roger Vale\n|1968-11-18\n|1993-03-23\n|Stored, in good condition, at Old Ghan Heritage Railway and Museum, near Alice Springs, Northern Territory\n|-\n|DH37\n|\n|1969-06-27\n|1994-02-14\n(Moved into Departmental service as MMY037)\n|Stored, Awaiting re-gauging to , at Walhalla Goldfields Railway, Victoria\n|-\n|DH38\n|\n|1969-07-07\n|1991-07-05\n|Operational at Kunkala, Rosewood Railway Museum\n|-\n|DH41\n|\n|1969-08-XX\n|\n|Under restoration by DownsSteam Tourist Railway & Museum at Drayton on the Darling Downs in Queensland.
