Coptic Christians launched an unsuccessful court case against 2004 submission I Love Cinema while dozens of Egyptian parliamentarians and a number of Muslim clerics similarly tried to ban The Yacoubian Building'' for depicting its depictions of Islamic fundamentalism and particularly homosexuality. 2002's Secret of the Young Girl a drama about teenage pregnancy, and 2003's Sleepless Nights, an examination of sex, divorce and relationships inside and outside of marriage also courted controversy among conservatives in Egypt.\nIn 2022, Egypt's Oscar Selection Committee announced a shortlist of five films: The Crime by Sherif Arafa, Full Moon by Hadi El Bagoury, Kira & El Gin by Marwan Hamed, 2 Talaat Harb by Magdy Ahmed Ali and Villa 19-B by Ahmad Abdalla. although Ahmed Ali withdrew his film prior to the vote. On 29 September, it was announced that a majority of the selection committee voted not to enter any of the shortlisted films.\nSee also\n*List of Academy Award winners and nominees for Best International Feature Film\n*List of Academy Award-winning foreign language films\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080707023727/http://www.oscars.org/awardsdatabase/ The Official Academy Awards Database]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080622050250/http://www.oscars.org/impc_site2/index.html The Motion Picture Credits Database]\n*[https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/ IMDb Academy Awards Page]"
