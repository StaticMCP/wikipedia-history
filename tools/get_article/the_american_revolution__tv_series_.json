Schmidt. The series is a six-part, twelve-hour documentary. It premiered on PBS on November 16, 2025.\nProduction\nThe filmmakers wrote in The Atlantic that the series filmed for 165 days at more than 150 locations, with weather often dictating logistics; they chased the solar eclipse of April 8, 2024 to the Adirondacks and rapidly staged winter shoots in Providence, Rhode Island, Charlestown, New Hampshire, Tivoli, New York, and Philadelphia over the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend. They also reported extensive collaboration with reenactors, including the Jersey Greys, who drilled at night in a snowstorm and built what the team believes is the largest redoubt in North America for the production.\nAccording to the filmmakers, the absence of photography of the period led them to emphasize first-person testimony, period imagery, landscape cinematography, and limited-face reenactments to convey the \"uncertainty\" of the era. The team said it had created over 100 new maps under geographer Charles E. Frye, aligning scanned 18th-century cartography to modern satellite imagery and correcting for altered rivers, coastal infill, and missing colonial borders; Native nations and towns are prominently marked alongside settler sites.\nRelease\nThe release of the series was preceded by a half-hour preview entitled The American Revolution: An Inside Look. The preview aired on PBS from August 2025 on an on-going basis to introduce the series. The series was promoted by PBS with a nationwide tour and site-specific screenings at Revolutionary War locations.\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! No.\n! Title\n!

Hoffman also notes the film's \"stately pace\" and attention to Loyalists and lesser known participants in the events.\nWriting for The New York Times, Jennifer Schuessler described The American Revolution as a documentary that \"aim[s] to strip away the barnacles of sentimentality and nostalgia\" surrounding the founding of the United States. Schuessler noted that the series arrives \"in the middle of a culture war,\" pointing to its \"frank discussions of slavery and Native American dispossession\" and its depiction of the Revolution as a \"hyper-violent civil war that divided families and communities.\" She observed that the film \"doesn't demonize Loyalists\" and that its presentation of Native Americans as \"members of powerful nations faced with complex choices\" may be \"the most eye-opening part of the documentary.\" The article also reported that Burns's \"insistence on both inspiration and complexity has played well with audiences, including those well outside the PBS orbit.\"\nIn The Hollywood Reporter, Daniel Fienberg described The American Revolution as \"smart, thorough, [and] sincere in intent,\" calling it \"rousing, if repetitive.\" He wrote that the series is \"patriotic, pragmatic and familiar,\" noting that it \"fits snugly into the unprecedented tapestry that Burns has been weaving since Brooklyn Bridge.\" Fienberg praised its attention to \"the internal conflicts and hypocrisies of the American Revolution,\" particularly its treatment of \"the celebrations of equality that excluded Blacks and Native Americans,\" while also remarking that the production \"relies heavily on familiar Burnsian tracking shots and zooms\" and can feel \"dry and a little languid.\" He concluded that despite its flaws, the series conveys \"the optimism that we sometimes forget as we squirm through the latest evolution or devolution of the American experiment.\"\nWriting for Politico, Nathaniel Moore reported that Burns frames the series as a unifying civic project grounded in a \"shared past,\" and described the cut he saw as heavy on factual narration while inclusive of voices often omitted from Revolutionary histories; he concluded that the film was \"entertaining enough\" to draw multigenerational audiences together at public screenings.\nCast\nVoices\n* Domhnall Gleeson (voice of Loftus Cliffe, Roger Lamb, John MacPherson, John Bowater, and William Barton)\n* Amanda Gorman (voice of Phillis Wheatley)\n* Michael Greyeyes (voice of Joseph Brant and Uhhaunauwaunmut)\n* Jonathan Groff (voice of Erkuries Beatty)\n* Charlotte Hacke (voice Friederike Riedesel, Hannah Davis, Lucy Knox, Martha Reeves)\n* Tom Hanks (voice of Andrew Eliot, Josiah Bartlett, Isaac Banks, Reverend David Griffith, Justice Thomas Jones, Ezra Tilden, Dr. Albigence Waldo, Ebenezer Denny)\n* Ethan Hawke (voice of General Anthony Wayne and John Andrews)\n* Maya Hawke (voice of Betsy Ambler)\n* Lucas Hedges (voice of Ebenezer Fletcher, John Laurens and Garrett Watts)\n* Josh Hutcherson (voice of James Potter Collins, Thomas Mellen and Jabez Campfield)\n* LaTanya Richardson Jackson (voice of Elizabeth Freeman and Judith Jackson)\n* Samuel L.
