International host Bob Geldof was assisted by presenters to distribute 24 awards. There were live performances but the awards were not televised and the ceremony was noted for its three-hours plus length with Gary Morris, manager of Midnight Oil providing a 20-minute acceptance speech.\nIn addition to previous categories, \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" was created and first awarded posthumously to record producer and Albert Productions label owner, Ted Albert (who died in November 1990); an \"Outstanding Achievement Award\" was presented to Midnight Oil. The ARIA Hall of Fame inducted four artists: Don Burrows, Peter Dawson, Glenn Shorrock and Billy Thorpe.\nCeremony details\nHost Bob Geldof found the three-hour plus ceremony to be interminable and threatened to walk out. Midnight Oil's manager Gary Morris provided the longest acceptance speech of the night at 20&nbsp;minutes. According to music journalist, Anthony O'Grady, \"[he] covered a gambit of topics including the downfall of Western Civilization.\" Morris later stated that as the ceremony was not televised he decided to speak his mind. Billy Thorpe's speech on his Hall of Fame induction, \"travelled almost as long ... [he] remembered friends and supporters throughout a 30-year career.\" According to ARIA spokesperson, Peter Rix, \"It was my worst ARIA nightmare come true.\" Music commentator, Molly Meldrum, disapproved of Morris' speech length—they had already had a fracas at the ARIAs in 1988—Meldrum provided an even longer acceptance speech in 1993.\nPresenters and performers\nThe ARIA Awards ceremony was hosted by Bob Geldof.
