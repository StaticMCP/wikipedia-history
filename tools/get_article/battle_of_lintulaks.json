At 2:00 PM it started raining and as the battle slowly started to die out, Fieandt commenced an all out bayonet attack. The first Russian lines withdrew before the Swedish onslaught but were soon caught by the reserve, which threw the Swedes back and forced them to retreat towards Perho. A Swedish detachment managed to halt the Russians by some stream, which saved them from a total disaster. The Swedes had lost 141 men in the fighting, of which 24 killed, while the Russians had lost 143, including 19 captured.\nAftermath\nAs the Swedish field-marshal, Wilhelm Mauritz Klingspor, received news of the defeat, he immediately dispatched two battalions from the Åbo and Nyland Infantry Regiments to Fieandt, along with 2 guns and 20 dragoons — increasing his force to 1,200 men — to stop the Russians from going north, towards Kokkola, which would cut off the Swedish lines of operation. Fieandt took a renewed position behind kokonsaari mosse, 4 km northwest of Perho Church. The Russians had likewise received reinforcements and counted at least 3,100 men under Generalmajor Jankovitj; he advanced on the Swedes and the two sides met once again at the Battle of Kokonsaari, on 11 July.\nNotes, citations and sources\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*"
