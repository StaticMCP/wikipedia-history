Choudhury has spent much of his life working intimately with the British Bangladeshi community, cementing himself as a respected figure through his many public appearances and charitable work.\nEarly life\nChoudhury was born on 15 June 1959, to a Bengali Muslim family in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).
