Built overlooking the Atlantic Ocean in the Ouakam suburb, the statue was designed by the Senegalese architect Pierre Goudiaby after an idea presented by President Abdoulaye Wade, and built by Mansudae Overseas Projects, a monument construction company from North Korea.\nSite preparation atop the  hill began in 2006, and construction of the bronze statue began in 2008. Originally scheduled for completion in December 2009, delays stretched into early 2010, and the formal dedication occurred on 4 April 2010, Senegal's \"National Day\", commemorating the 50th anniversary of the country's independence from France. It is the tallest statue in Africa.\nConstruction\nThe project was launched by then Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade, who considered it part of Senegal's prestige projects, aimed at providing monuments to herald a new era of African Renaissance. It shows a family drawn up towards the sky, the man carrying his child on his biceps and holding his wife by the waist, \"an Africa emerging from the bowels of the earth, leaving obscurantism to go towards the light\". The monument indeed represents an African family resolutely turned towards the North-West. The project, which represents African rebirth and moving forward, was inspired by Senegal's first president Léopold Sédar Senghor vision for the future of the country.\nThe project of the monument was entrusted to the Senegalese architect Pierre Goudiaby Atepa, author \"in particular\" of the Door of the Third Millennium, which overhangs the road of the Corniche. The work was \"drawn\" by President Wade, who owns 35% of the copyright, but the work was initiated by the Senegalese artist Ousmane Sow, who withdrew from the project following a disagreement with Abdoulaye Wade.\nUnveiling\nOn 3 April 2010, the African Renaissance Monument was unveiled in Dakar in front of 19 African heads of state, including President of Malawi and the African Union, Bingu wa Mutharika, Jean Ping of the African Union Commission, and the Presidents of Benin, Cape Verde, Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, The Gambia, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania and Zimbabwe, as well as representatives from North Korea, and Jesse Jackson and musician Akon, both from the United States, all of whom were given a tour.\nPresident Wade said, \"It brings to life our common destiny. Africa has arrived in the 21st century standing tall and more ready than ever to take its destiny into its hands.\" President Bingu said, \"This monument does not belong to Senegal. It belongs to the African people wherever we are.\"\nControversies\nExpense\nThousands of people protested against \"all the failures of President Wade's regime, the least of which is this horrible statue\" on the city's streets beforehand, with riot police deployed to maintain control. Deputy leader of the opposition Ndeye Fatou Toure described the monument as an \"economic monster and a financial scandal in the context of the current [economic] crisis\".\nThe colossal statue has been criticized for its cost at US$ 27 million (£16.6m). The payment was made in kind, with 30 to 40 hectares of land that has variously been reported as sponsored  by a Senegalese businessman or state-owned land.\nStyle\nThe statue was built by Mansudae Overseas Projects, a North Korean sculpting company famous for various projects and large statues throughout Africa since the 1970s.\nThe statue was poorly received by art critics around the world after its much-delayed unveiling in 2010 and was compared by some to the (once-abandoned) Christopher Columbus statue project that was unveiled in Arecibo, Puerto Rico in 2016. Local imams argued that a statue depicting a human figure is idolatrous and objected to the perceived immodesty of the semi-nude male and female figures.\nRevenue\nThe project has also attracted controversy due to Wade's claim to the intellectual property rights of the statue, and insisting that he is entitled to 35 percent of the profits raised. Opposition figures have sharply criticised Wade's plan to claim intellectual property rights, insisting that the president cannot claim copyright over ideas conceived as a function of his public office.\nLocal artists\nOusmane Sow, a world-renowned Senegalese sculptor, also objected to the use of foreign builders, saying it was anything but a symbol of African Renaissance and nothing to do with art.\nGallery of images\nFile:Dakars Mamelles (5824544243).jpg|Monument as seen from afar, 12 June 2011\nFile:African Renaissance Monument (5502494604).jpg|Buildings in the immediate vicinity of the monument, 6 March 2011\nFile:20130503-IMG 2242 (8745313420).jpg|Plaques at the base of the statue\nFile:African Renaissance Monument woman.jpg|Adjacent to the central figure of the monument is a woman standing beside the man\nFile:African Renaissance Monument central figure.jpg|The central figure of the monument depicts a muscular man holding a child aloft with one hand while stretching the other arm outward\nFile:African Renaissance Monument child.jpg|The child, held aloft by the central male figure of the African Renaissance Monument, faces outward with arms raised upward\nFile:Monument de la renaissance du Sénégal.jpg|View from base of stairs\nFile:African Renaissance Monument - From Above.jpg|Monument seen from above\nFile:Renaissance Monument.jpg|View from monument base\nFile:Monument de la renaissance africaine 1.JPG|Looking up from below\nFile:SN-dakar-renaiss-monum-01.jpg|Sign at monument base\nFile:SN-dakar-renaiss-monum-2.jpg|Tourists ascending stairs\nFile:African Renaissance Monument Dakar 2025.jpg|Seen from street below in 2025 during the rainy season\nSee also\n*African Renaissance\n*Mansudae Overseas Projects\n*List of tallest statues\n*Sungbo's Eredo\nReferences"
