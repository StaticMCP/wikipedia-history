Rantzau received the news that a Swedish army of superior strength led by Jacob Henriksson Hästesko was approaching from the east, forcing him to move his forces toward Falkenberg. Rantzau had decided to commit to combat since the Swedish force had just arrived from its march and hadn't rearranged into a militarily cohesive unit.\nAftermath\nThe Danes won as a consequence of their superior cavalry tactic and Rantzau became a renowned general after the battle and throughout the war. Despite the victory and the capture of the Swedish artillery, the Danish had suffered great losses and stayed near the battlefield for a week, while large portions of the Swedish army were intact.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060719215917/http://www.falkenberg.se/2.da906710286e85a4a800050.html The Axtorna project]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100813035631/http://www.arkeologiuv.se/cms/arkeologiuv/aktuellt_uv/slagfaltsarkeologi/axtorna_1565/striden_begynner.html arkeologiuv.se]"
