The Gulflander passenger train operates once a week along the railway line.\nTwo of Australia's big things are in Normanton: the \"Big Barramundi\" and \"Krys, the Savannah King\" (a saltwater crocodile). There are also many heritage-listed sites, reflecting Normanton's history.\nIn the , the locality of Normanton had a population of 1,391 people.\nGeography\nNormanton is in the Gulf Country region of northwest Queensland, just south of the Gulf of Carpentaria, on the Norman River in Queensland. It is a small cattle town and coastal locality, and administrative centre of the Shire of Carpentaria.\nThe main street is Landsborough Street.\nAn unusual feature  southwest of Normanton is Bang Bang Jump Up, one of the few hills located in the middle of an expansive, flat grassland.\nHistory\nThe town sits in the traditional lands of the Gkuthaarn (Kareldi) and Kukatj people.\nThe town takes its name from the Norman River, which was named in honour of William Henry Norman of the Victorian Naval Forces, who commanded the sloop HMCS Victoria in the search for the explorers Burke and Wills and also conducted hydrographic surveys of the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Torres Strait to identify reefs and other marine hazards.\nAn expedition to explore the Norman River and Bynoe River leading to the identification of a new town site on the Norman River in May 1867. The new town of Norman was surveyed by George Phillips in December 1867 and was officially gazetted on 8 August 1868. It was seen as an alternative to Burketown which had issues with fever and flooding. On 11 October 1868 the first land sale of 167 town lots of  was held at the Norman Police Office.\nNorman River Post Office opened on 13 June 1868 and was renamed Normanton by 1872.\nNormanton State School opened in September 1882. In January 1976 a secondary department was added to the school.  The school celebrated its centenary in 1982.\nThe Burns Philp store, a general mercantile store and agency office, was opened in 1884. It is the oldest intact Burns Philp store in Queensland.\nNormanton grew slowly until the discovery of gold at Croydon in 1885 provided a major boost, attracting people from a variety of cultures, including Chinese people drawn to the gold fields. Like other towns in the Gulf country Chinese men often supplied local vegetables from their market gardens. Some married locally to either white or indigenous women and many families were the result. Although Normanton appears to have had some \"Chinese gardens\" very early in its history with reference in 1873 to the \"Chinese gardens, their houses, and live stock, have been swept away.\" According to historian Sandi Robb there were 6 families of mixed heritage in Normanton.\nThe town prosperity was assisted by the  completion of the Normanton – Croydon railway in 1889 which saw Normanton becoming the acknowledged gateway to north-western Queensland. The new link was to bring both people and wealth to the area.\nThe population reached 1,251 by 1891. The gold boom at Croydon was short-lived and the completion of the Townsville – Cloncurry railway in 1908, reduced Normanton's relative importance as a centre. After the gold ran out and the mining industry grew to a halt in the early 1900s, pastoralism became the main industry of the region.\nSome Aboriginal groups in the region were moved on to cattle stations to provide labour, while other groups were more or less extinguished. Many were moved to missions on Mornington Island and Doomadgee. Aboriginal camps were set up on the outskirts of the town, and the first Aboriginal reserve was gazetted in 1935; both were still in existence until at least 1976.\nBy 1947 the town's population had declined to 234.\nIn the 1960s there was a resurgence in Normanton's population as a gateway to the Gulf of Carpentaria with major industrial development taking place in the prawn fishing industry at nearby Karumba at the mouth of the Norman River.\nIn 1965, the Carpentaria Shire Council erected a war memorial in the centre of Landsborough Street opposite the National Hotel (). It commemorates those who served in all conflicts.\nGulf Christian College was established on 24 January 1990 by the Normanton Assembly of God Church.\nThe Normanton library was opened in 2004.\nThe Normanton Anzac Roll of Honour was unveiled on Tuesday 13 June 2017, as part of the First World War centenary commemorations.

It is located on Landsborough Street opposite the war memorial ().\nNative title\nAfter seeking rights since 1996, in November 2012 the traditional owners, the Gkuthaarn and Kukatj people, lodged a claim for native title over an area around Normanton stretching . On 2 July 2020 an Indigenous land use agreement was signed, and they were granted rights to fish, hunt and perform their ceremonies on the land. Pastoralists are still able to run cattle on the cattle stations in the area, and the Aboriginal people assist with management of the land (such as pest and weed control) and cultural heritage sites. They are already monitoring and counting of migratory seabirds, with many participating as Indigenous rangers in the Normanton Land and Sea Ranger Group. Some land in the southern part of the claimed area has been determined as \"native title extinguished\".\nDemographics\nIn the , the town of Normanton had a population of 1,100 people, of whom 60% identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people.\nIn the , the locality of Normanton had a population of 1,257 people, of whom 750 (60%) identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, while the town of Normanton had a population of 1,210 people, of whom 743 (62%) identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people.\nIn the , the locality of Normanton had a population of 1,391 people, of whom 774 (55.6%) identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people.
