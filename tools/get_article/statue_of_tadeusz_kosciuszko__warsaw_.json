The investment was financed by the Citi Bank Handlowy and the Warsaw City Council. The bronze elements of the monument were moulded by the Technical Appliance Works at Gliwice. The copying of the Washington monument was executed by Kraków sculptors Anna and Wojciech Siek.\nThe monument was unveiled on 16 November 2010.\nThe monument shows the figure of Tadeusz Kościuszko in the uniform of an American general, holding drawings of the West Point garrison defenses in his hand.
