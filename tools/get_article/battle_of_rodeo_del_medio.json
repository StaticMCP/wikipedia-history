The consequences of the Federalist victory would last for a decade.\nBackground\nIn 1840 the Northern Coalition had formed an alliance of almost all the northern provinces against the governor of Buenos Aires Province, Juan Manuel de Rosas, and his allies.\nGeneral Juan Lavalle had spent more than a year fighting Rosas in Entre Ríos and Corrientes, when he had invaded Buenos Aires Province.\nBut he failed in the invasion, retreating to Córdoba Province, where he was defeated at the Battle of Quebracho Herrado.\nLavalle joined forces with Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid, and together they retreated to Tucumán Province.\nFrom there, Lamadrid marched towards the Cuyo provinces to open a new war front, thinking José Félix Aldao only had 800-1000 troops from Mendoza at the time, as Lavalle believed.\nLavalle entrenched in Tucuman with 1,500 militiamen.\nYet, at that time reinforcements under Manuel Oribe began arriving adding up to 9,000 troops, but only 6,000 ended up part of the final push as the rest remained defending the Cuyo region.\nLamadrid's vanguard led by Mariano Acha had 900 to 1,000 soldiers and two cannons.}}\nAcha faced the Federalist armies of José Félix Aldao and Nazario Benavídez, governors of the provinces of Mendoza and San Juan, in the Battle of Angaco,\none of the bloodiest of the Argentine civil wars.\nAfter Acha had won, he occupied the city of San Juan, but two days later was defeated by Benavídez in the Battle of La Chacarilla, and was shot by order of Aldao.\nLamadrid reoccupied San Juan with 1,500 troops,}}\nand from there went to Mendoza, entering the city on 3 September 1841, where he was elected governor.\nDevelopment\nThree weeks later general Ángel Pacheco came to Mendoza accompanied by Aldao, with 2,000 men, 1,500 horses and corresponding artillery.\nLamadrid went out to meet him in Rodeo del Medio, near the city, on the morning of 24 September.\nThe Federalists had 3,000 men and the Unitarians only 1,600.\nThe armies were separated by a flooded area that could only be passed by a bridge.\nFrom the beginning, Lamadrid failed to prevent Pacheco from seizing the bridge.\nHis left wing, led by Ángel Vicente Peñaloza, was prevented from moving by a counter-order.\nWhen he finally did move, he was quickly repelled by the infantry.\nThe defeat of the Unitarians was evident from the start, and soon all were fleeing to the mountains.\nIt was a very bloody battle, with hundreds of deaths on each side, followed by a terrible persecution of the vanquished, led by the \"monk\" Aldao, causing many hundreds of additional deaths. Aldao ordered 1,000 men to follow up to Catamarca to the north, while the rest remained in La Rioja to prevent an attempt by Lavalle to advance to Cuyo.\nAftermath\nThe defeated crossed the Andes, long before the thaw would allow a safe crossing, and more than a hundred men died.\nIt is said that a few of the losers hid in a village near Mendoza, then called Coquimbito.\nThe losers did not yet know, but five days before, General Lavalle had been defeated in the Battle of Famaillá in Tucumán,\nand would be dead within days from an accident in San Salvador de Jujuy.\nPacheco ordered Aldao to pursue Lavalle north with 1,500 men, and subsequently Oribe provided the troops of Mariano Maza in support.\nAldao's troops totaled over 2,700 soldiers with two howitzers directed by Maza, Nazario Benavídez, Pablo Lucero and Pablo Alemán.\nThese two battles were the end of the Northern Coalition, and guaranteed Rosas almost unchallenged rule over the country for another ten years, until the Battle of Caseros in 1852.\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*|url=http://www.portalplanetasedna.com.ar/batallas_argentinas.htm\n|title=Breve Descripción de Batallas Argentinas}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* |url=http://www.legionunitaria.granaderos.com.ar/articulos/art-batallarodeodelmedio.htm\n|title=La batalla del Rodeo del Medio|work=Granaderos}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n* Aráoz de Lamadrid, Gregorio, Memorias, Bs.
