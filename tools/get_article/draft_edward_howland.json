      "text": "# Draft:Edward Howland\n\nEdward Howland (1832-1890) was a Harvard-educated writer and editor, born in Charleston, South Carolina, the son of a wealthy cotton trader. In 1858, he provided significant financing to The New York Saturday Press, America’s first Bohemian journal, for which he contributed writing and editing.  Soon after, he met Marie Howland, then, Marie Stevens Case, while the two lived at Stephen Pearl Andrews's co-operative Unity House at 17 Stuyvesant St., NYC. Consistent with Marie and her husband Lyman Case's Free-Love-Leaguer philosophy, Lyman noticed the \"Passional Attraction\" between Marie and Edward, and offered Marie a divorce so the two could be free to love.  And so they divorced and Marie and Edward were married.\nHowland went on to write on history subjects, while Marie and Edward took part in a variety of utopian living communities, such as the American socialistic colony at Topolobampo, Mexico.\nReferences\nReferences"
