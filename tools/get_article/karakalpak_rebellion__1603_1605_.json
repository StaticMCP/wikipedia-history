He chose not to continue the war and agreed to peace, which the representatives of the Bukharan Khan had persistently sought. As a result of the negotiations, Pir-Muhammad ceded Tashkent, Sayram, and Turkestan to Yeshim but retained the ancient capital of Mawarannahr—Samarkand.\nUprising\nAmong the political rivals of Yeshim Khan, sources particularly highlight two sultans — the impostor Abd al-Ghaffar and Tursun-Muhammad. The story of the first is described in the work Musakhkhir al-bilad'' by Muhammad-Yar ibn Arab Katagan. The events he describes took place after the death of Shibanid Abdullah and his successor Abd al-Mumin, during the reign of Janid Baki-Muhammad in Mawarannahr and Yeshim Khan in Kazakhstan.\nIn the autumn of 1603, corresponding to the Year of the Leopard, the Karakalpaks in Turkestan enthroned a man, proclaiming him Abd al-Ghaffar Sultan—allegedly the son of Shibanid Baba Sultan. In response, Yeshim Khan, Bahadur Sultan, and other Kazakh sultans gathered an army and marched from Tashkent and Sayram to confront the impostor. The battle lasted twelve days, but on the thirteenth day, the Kazakh army suffered defeat. As a result, the impostor Abd al-Ghaffar Sultan seized Turkestan, Sayram, Tashkent, Ahsikent, and Andijan, making Tashkent his capital.\nBattle of Karakamysh\nIn the spring of 1605, the Year of the Hare, he left Tashkent and set up camp in the clearing of Kara-Kamysh, about three to four kilometers from the city gates. At the same time, Yeshim and Bahadur, who had marched with their army from Ala-Tag to fight the impostor Abd al-Ghaffar, approached the outskirts of Tashkent. They captured a prisoner who revealed important information.\nLearning about the situation of the impostor Abd al-Ghaffar, Yeshim and Bahadur launched a sudden attack on the camp in Kara-Kamysh at dawn. The impostor was still asleep. Awakened by the sound of galloping horses, he ran out of his tent in fear. At that moment, Yeshim Khan appeared and pierced his stomach with a massive saber. Yeshim Khan defeated Abd al-Ghaffar, after which the Kazakhs regained control over the Syr Darya cities, Tashkent, and Fergana.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nRecommendation of literature\n*"
