In the , Springwood had a population of 9,710 people.\nGeography\nat Springwood, 2007]]\nThe size of Springwood is approximately 6&nbsp;km². It has 17 parks covering nearly 9% of the total area.  The population of Springwood in 1996 was 9,738 people.  By 2001 the population was 9,084 showing a population decline of 7% in the area during that time. A high proportion of people in Springwood are in the baby boomers generation compared to population proportions in the surrounding local government area.\nSpringwood is a significant activity centre in the region, with a major bus station, two hotels, a 24-hour McDonald's, two state primary schools, a state high school, a campus of Calvary Christian College, a public library, three shopping malls, ambulance, fire and police stations and many places of worship (including Church of Christ, Uniting and Seventh-day Adventist churches).\nMost commercial activity in Springwood is centred on the \"town centre\" in the north-west of the suburb along the Pacific Motorway. An increasing amount of commercial development is also occurring in the south-eastern parts of Springwood, an area unofficially known as Chatswood Hills. The remainder of the suburb is primarily middle-class residential areas.\nHistory\nSpringwood is situated in the Yugarabul traditional Aboriginal country of the Brisbane and surrounding regions. Indigenous Australian people from the Yugambeh and Jaggera language groups inhabited the local area.\nSpringwood was laid out as a development when the South East Freeway to Brisbane was planned, at one end of the proposed Freeway. This was expected to be finished in 1972, but was not finished until 1985. The development was named after the name of the property owned by Brigader Sam Langford in 1932.\nSpringwood State High School opened on 24 January 1977.\nDennis Road State School opened on 24 January 1977, but just after the official opening, it was renamed Springwood Central State School.\nChatswood Hills State School opened on 24 January 1983.\nCalvary Christian College opened on 23 January 1984.\nUntil September 2006, Springwood was home to an IKEA store, before moving to a new location in Slacks Creek, directly across the Pacific Motorway from Chatswood Hills.\nFrom the 2000s, both the Queensland government and Logan City Council proposed that Springwood be redeveloped as a Principal Activity Centre (PAC). This was initially noted by the Queensland government in a 2005 paper, South East Queensland Regional Plan. The paper, in addition to its follow-up paper in 2009, cites multiple reasons for developing a PAC in Springwood: the area's close proximity to the Pacific Motorway, its strategic location between Brisbane City and the Gold Coast, existing urban infrastructure and availability of affordable housing. The aim of the proposal is to reduce growth pressures in established PACs whilst encouraging more employment opportunities and economic growth in South East Queensland.\nIn October 2009, Logan City Council partnered with GHD to create a master plan for redeveloping Springwood as a PAC. This plan was made after consultations with key stakeholders and residents in the local area. Using the South East Queensland Regional Plan as a foundation, the master plan envisions a future for Springwood in the year 2031 and beyond. The plan proposes a significant change in form and function of the suburb compared to its current state. As a suburb with a significant presence in automotive retail showrooms, the plan encourages these showrooms to consolidate around Compton Road and the Logan Mega Centre. The plan proposes new low-rise office spaces, residential apartments, recreational spaces, retail and commercial spaces to be developed within close distance to Springwood bus station. Moreover, the plan outlines two new town squares, a new road intersecting Dennis Road and Carol Avenue, a theatre, an art gallery, rehabilitation of Slacks Creek and an upgrade to public transport facilities. These proposals offer a framework for future planning scheme amendments made by Logan City Council.\nSpringwood Summit was held in October 2016 to jumpstart further public interest and discussion of the suburb. The summit had the tagline: \"The start of SEQ's next CBD\". More than 200 delegates from around the world attended the summit.\nLogan City Council's Local Government Infrastructure Plan (LGIP) planned for land acquisition of two local state schools for new parks and town square between 2019 and 2021.\nDemographics\nIn the , there were 9,148 people in Springwood.

Located in a former quarry site, after a community campaign, Logan City Council became its trustee and it was gazetted as an environmental park in 1990, before designating it a conservation park in 1994. The park became park of the Koala Bushland Coordinated Conservation Area (KBCCA) in 1996, an important 1500 hectare regional conservation area for the koala. Koalas have been listed as endangered since the Queensland's Nature Conservation Act (1992) due mainly to habitat loss. In addition to helping protect it, the park helps protects several endangered tree species on which they feed as well as other locally vulnerable animals including the Short-beaked echidna and rainbow bee-eater. The Gorge Discovery Circuit is a popular walking and running track. Springwood Stairs escalate the escarpment and are known locally as the \"stairs of death\".\nNotable people\n* Huan Fraser, politician\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
