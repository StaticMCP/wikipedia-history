Named after Dora Mavor Moore, who helped establish Canadian professional theatre, the awards program was established on December 13, 1978, with the first awards held in 1980. Each winner receives a bronze statue made from the original by John Romano.\nAwards\nAwards are given in major divisions: General Theatre (Drama/Comedy/Play, budget over $100,000 and over 150 seats), Musical Theatre (Musical/Revue/Cabaret), Independent Theatre (budget under $100,000 and/or under 150 seats), Dance, Opera, Theatre for Young Audiences, and Touring. Each of these major categories is further sub-divided in an assorted number of awards. In 2018, the awards announced that beginning with the 2019 awards, it would discontinue gender-based performance categories, replacing its previous performance categories for men and women with \"Outstanding Performance\" categories.\nGeneral Theatre\n*Production\n*Original Play\n*Leading Performer\n*Supporting Performer\n*Direction\n*Scenic/Projection Design\n*Costume Design\n*Lighting Design\n*Sound Design/Composition\n*Leading Actor (retired)\n*Leading Actress (retired)\n*Supporting Actor (retired)\n*Supporting Actress (retired)\n*Ensemble (retired)\n*Choreography (retired)\nMusical Theatre\n*Production\n*Original Musical\n*Leading Performer\n*Supporting Performer\n*Direction\n*Musical Direction\n*Choreography\n*Design\n*Leading Actor (retired)\n*Leading Actress (retired)\n*Supporting Actor (retired)\n*Supporting Actress (retired)\n*Ensemble (retired)\n*Scenic Design (retired)\n*Costume Design (retired)\n*Lighting Design (retired)\n*Original Score (retired)\nIndependent theatre\n*Production\n*Original Play\n*Direction\n*Performer\n*Ensemble\n*Scenic/Projection Design\n*Costume Design\n*Lighting Design\n*Sound Design/Composition\n*Leading Actor (retired)\n*Leading Actress (retired)\n*Supporting Performer/Ensemble (retired)\nDance\n*Production\n*Performer\n*Ensemble\n*Choreography\n*Design\n*Sound Design/Composition\n*Actor (retired)\n*Actress (retired)\nOpera\n*Production\n*Original Opera\n*Performer\n*Ensemble\n*Direction\n*Musical Direction\n*Design\n*Actor (retired)\n*Actress (retired)\nTheatre for Young Audiences\n*Production\n*Original Play\n*Performer\n*Ensemble\n*Direction\n*Design\nTouring\n*Production\nAncillary awards\nIn association with the Dora Awards, several ancillary awards are also administered and presented by TAPA.\nAlthough the Doras were cancelled in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada shutting down theatre production in the 2020-21 season, ancillary awards were still presented that year as they are presented for the recipient's overall body of work rather than for specific shows within an eligibility period.\nPauline McGibbon Award\nThis award was established in 1981 in honour of former Lieutenant Governor of Ontario Pauline McGibbon.
