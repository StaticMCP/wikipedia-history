      "text": "# List of Satavahana kings\n\nThe Satavahanas were the rulers of the ancient Indian Satavahana Empire.\nThey ruled over regions of Deccan (core region), central and southern India between c. mid 3rd century BCE to mid 3rd century CE. Gautamiputra Satakarni (r. c. 106–130 CE) is considered the greatest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty. He is known as the \"Lord of the West\". His mother's Nashik Prashasti inscription praises him for his military victories. Originally the Satavahanas were the followers of Hindu religion.\nThe Satavahana Empire declined for a number of reasons, after Yajnashri Satakarni, the last powerful ruler, the Satavahanas were succeeded by weak rulers who were unable to manage the vast empire. The loss of centralized power led to the rise of feudatories, finally it led to the division of the empire. The Satavahanas' greatest competitors were the Sakas, who had established power in Western India.\nList of rulers\nMultiple Puranas contain chronology of Satavahana kings. However, there are inconsistencies among the various Puranas over the number of kings in the dynasty, the names of the kings, and the length of their rule. In addition, some of the kings listed in the Puranas are not attested via archaeological and numismatic evidence. Similarly, there are some kings known from coins and inscriptions, whose names are not found in the Puranic lists.\nThe reconstructions of the Satavahana kings by historians fall into two categories:\n* According to the first one, 30 Satavahana kings ruled for around 450 years, starting from Simuka's rule immediately after the fall of the Mauryan empire. This view relies heavily on the Puranas, and is now largely discredited.\n* According to the second (and more widely accepted) category of reconstructions, the Satavahana rule started in around first century BCE. The chronologies in this category contain a smaller number of kings, and combine Puranic records with archaeological, numismatic and textual evidence.\nBecause of uncertainty regarding the establishment date of the Satavahana kingdom, it is difficult to give absolute dates for the reigns of the Satavahana kings. Therefore, many modern scholars do not assign absolute dates to the reigns of the historically attested Satavahana kings, and those who do vary greatly with each other.\nList based on Archeology\nHimanshu Prabha Ray provides the following chronology, based on archaeological and numismatic evidence:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Satavahana dynasty rulers\n!Serial.

The Matsya Purana states that 30 Satavahana kings ruled for 460 years, but some of its manuscripts name only 19 kings whose reigns add up to 448.5 years. The Vayu Purana also mentions that there were 30 Satavahana kings, but its various manuscripts name only 17, 18, and 19 kings respectively; the reigns add up to 272.5, 300, and 411 years respectively. Many of these kings are not attested by historical evidence. On the other hand, some Satavahana kings attested by numismatic evidence (such as Rudra Satakarni) are not mentioned in the Puranas at all.\nDifferent scholars have explained these anomalies in different ways. Scholars such as R. G. Bhandarkar, D. C. Sircar and H. C. Raychaudhuri theorised that the Vayu Purana mentions only the main imperial branch of the dynasty, while the Matsya Purana puts together princes of all its branches.\nThe names of the Satavahana kings (in IAST), as mentioned in the various Puranas, are given below. These names vary across different manuscripts of the same Puranas, and some names are missing in some of the manuscripts. The list given below for each Purana contains the most exhaustive version. In the Puranas, Krishna (IAST: Kṛṣṇa) is described as brother of the first king, who overthrew the Kanva king Susharman.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 70%; width: 100%;\"\n|+ Puranic genealogy of Satavahana dynasty\n! #\n!

Regarding Siri Satakani and his wife Naganika, Bhandhare considers their rule to have been somewhere around 110 +/- 20 BCE.\nList by Shailendra Bhandare\nBhandare also suggests the following sequence of reigns, based on his analysis of Satavahana coinage:\n* Gautamiputa Satakani (ca. 60–85 CE)\n* Vasithiputa Siri Pulumayi (ca. 85–125 CE)\n* Vasithiputa Siri Satakani (ca. 125–152 CE)\n* Vasithiputa Siva Siri Pulumayi (ca. 152–160 CE)\n* Vasithiputa Siri Khada Satakani (ca. 160–165 CE)\n* Vasithiputa Vijaya Satakani (ca. 165–170 CE)\n* Siri Yaña Satakani (ca. 170–200 CE)\n* Gotamiputa Siri Cada (ca. 200–215 CE)\n* Gotamiputa Siri Vijaya Satakani (ca. 215–225 CE)\nShailendra Bhandare's edited list by Andrew Ollett\nOn the other hand, based to a large degree on Shailendra Bhandare's work, with slight corrections, Andrew Ollett (2017) mentions the following reigns for the whole Satavahana dynasty:\n* Vasisthiputra Sri Chimuka Satavahana (ca. 120–96 BCE)\n* Krsna (ca. 96–88 BCE)\n* Sri Satakarni (ca. 88–42 BCE)\n* Sakti\n* Mantalaka\n* Sundara\n* Gautamiputra Siva Satakarni (?–60 CE)\n* Gautamiputra Sri Satakarni (ca. 60–84 CE)\n* Vasisthiputra Sri Pulumavi (ca. 84–119 CE)\n* Vasisthiputra Sri Satakarni (ca. 119–148 CE)\n* Vasisthiputra Sivasri Pulumavi (ca. 148–156 CE)\n* Vasisthiputra Sriskanda Satakarni (ca. 156–170 CE)\n* Gautamiputra Sriyajña Satakarni (ca. 171–199 CE)\n* Gautamiputra Srivijaya Satakarni (ca. 200–205 CE)\n* Vasisthiputra Sricanda Satakarni (ca. 206–220 CE)\n* Mathariputra Sri Pulumavi (ca. 220–230 CE)\nSee also\n* Middle kingdoms of India\n* History of India\n* History of Maharashtra\n* History of Hinduism\n* List of Indian monarchs\n* List of wars involving India\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
