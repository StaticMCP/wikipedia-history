At the 2021 census, it had a population of 1,190.  Dawlish Warren consists almost entirely of holiday accommodation and facilities for holidaymakers, especially on caravan sites.\nLocation\nDawlish Warren is located at the mouth of the Exe Estuary opposite Exmouth and has a beach, a National Nature Reserve spanning 506 acres (2&nbsp;km2) and a golf course, which is classified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).\npond at the Dawlish Warren National Nature Reserve]]\nThe renowned sand spit at Dawlish Warren is the location of both the golf course and the nature reserve which was declared a National Nature Reserve in 2000.  This spit has reduced in size within the past century due to erosion partly caused by the installation of a breakwater at Langstone Rock to the south-west which traps sand from the local sandstone cliffs and interrupts the natural sediment flow of the area.\nThe resort is popular with holidaymakers and although a death occurred from E. coli poisoning in 1999, allegedly caused by a nearby sewage outflow, a new sewage treatment plant has since been built resulting in both Dawlish Warren and Dawlish beaches now winning the Blue Flag for the quality of the bathing waters.\nTourism\nAlong with neighbouring Dawlish, this corner of south Devon has a favourable climate, which draws thousands of visitors to the area in summer.  Because of this, the Dawlish Warren economy relies heavily on tourism, and in particular on the many caravan and camping parks in the village which add over 15,000 to the local population during the summer months. There are several holiday parks which attract visitors from all over the UK, but in particular the West Midlands and South Wales.  The major holiday parks are Welcome, Hazelwood, Cofton, Golden Sands, Dawlish Sands, Peppermint Park, Lady's Mile and Oakcliff.  In 2008 Peppermint Park and Golden Sands joined Dawlish Sands as part of Park Holidays UK Caravan Parks.  The name 'Peppermint Park' has gone and the site has been rebranded 'Golden Sands'.\nAmenities\nDawlish Warren has a doctor's surgery, a pharmacy and an independent supermarket, along with several gift shops which cater for tourist traffic.\nThere are a number of restaurants and takeaway eateries. There are many bars and pubs such as the Warren Bridge Inn and the Mount Pleasant Inn, which dates from before the 1750s and is located just outside the resort.\nTransport\nThe resort is served by Dawlish Warren railway station, situated a few minutes from the beach. It lies between the stations of  and  on the\nRiviera Line, a section of the Great Western Main Line between London Paddington and  in Cornwall. Stopping services are operated by Great Western Railway, on a route between Exmouth, Exeter and Paignton.\nDawlish can be reached by a  walk south-west along the South Devon Railway sea wall.\nLocal bus services are operated predominantly by Stagecoach South West; key routes that serve the town include:\n* 22: Dawlish Warren to South Devon College in Paignton\n* 187: Dawlish Warren to Dawlish\nReligion\nAlthough Dawlish Warren is within the civil parish of Dawlish, it lies in the ecclesiastical parish of Cofton. There is no actual church in Dawlish Warren, but St Mary's Church Hall (St Mary's Church is in Cofton) is located near the resort's railway station. It is used for services and community activities.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dawlishwarren.co.uk/ Dawlish Warren Nature Reserve]"
