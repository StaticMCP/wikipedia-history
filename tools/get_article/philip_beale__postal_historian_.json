Whilst at Cambridge University he met his future wife, Barbara, to whom he was married for almost 70 years ( 1951 - 2020 ). Barbara accompanied him to The Gambia where she taught at the High School, of which Beale was the Principal, from 1961 to 1966. Beale and his wife had a strong and enduring Christian Faith and were regular attendees at their local Methodist Church wherever they lived during their marriage.\nCareer\nIn 1961, Beale travelled to The Gambia where he was principal of The Gambia High School until 1966. While there he jointly organised an archaeological expedition to examine the Senegambian stone circles, the records of which are in the Royal Anthropological Institute as MS 465. He later lectured on the running of secondary schools.\nPhilately\nBeale joined the Royal Philatelic Society London in 1968, subsequently becoming a fellow of the society. He is a specialist in the postal history of West Africa and has written a number of books relating to that area and the history of the British postal system. His The Postal Service of Sierra Leone: Its history, stamps and stationery until 1961, published by the Royal society in 1988, was described as a \"work of distinguished historical scholarship\". His History of the Post in England (1998) was reprinted in a new edition as ''England's Mail in 2005. In 2011 he collaborated with Adrian Almond and Mike Scott-Archer to produce The Corsini Letters, an authoritative account of the cache of around 3,600 letters sent to two Italian merchants in London between 1567 and 1602 that provides insights into postal arrangements at that time.\nPersonal Life and Death\nPhilip Beale was a committed Christian and Methodist Lay Preacher and was happily married to his wife, Barbara from 1951 until her death, in January 2019. Beale survived his wife by five years and died, peacefully, at the age of 98 in a Care Home in Eastbourne, UK on 16 April 2024.   Beale and his wife did not have children of their own and he is survived by his sister in law, his niece and his nephew, along with their families.\nSelected publications\n* The agents of the General Post Office in Fernando Po, Lagos, Madeira, Teneriffe, St. Vincent (Cape Verde Isles) and Freetown during the nineteenth century.
