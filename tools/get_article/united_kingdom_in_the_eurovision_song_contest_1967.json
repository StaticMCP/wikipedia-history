The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final titled A Song for Europe 1967, after having previously selected the performer internally. The entry eventually won the Eurovision Song Contest.\nBefore Eurovision\nA Song for Europe 1967\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held a national pre-selection to choose the song that would go to the Eurovision Song Contest 1967. It was held on 25 February 1967 and presented by Rolf Harris. Harris's weekly show had been the showcase for the five songs in the competition, which had been performed in successive weeks prior to the final.\nThe internal BBC selection of Sandie Shaw as the singer was something of a departure; in recognition of changing trends in the contest, she was arguably the first real \"pop\" star to be chosen as the British representative. Shaw and her manager Eve Taylor were permitted to select one of the finalists, submitting \"Had a Dream Last Night\", written by her regular songwriter and producer Chris Andrews, who had previously had a song in the , \"One Day\", performed by Kathy Kirby. Shaw had recorded a version of that track herself. Viewers voted on postcards via mail to decide the winner and the chosen song was \"Puppet on a String\".\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|+ A Song for Europe 1967\n|-\n! Draw\n! Song\n!

Some estimates make this the biggest selling single globally by a British female artist. In Germany it sold in excess of 1,000,000 copies and was the biggest selling single of the year. Shaw also released an extended play maxi single featuring four of the five finalists, excluding the winner. This EP titled Tell The Boys, reached No.4 in the EP chart top 10. Shaw later recorded all five songs in Spanish, Italian, French and German. Eventually, all the various recordings of all five songs became available on various CD compilations.\nAt Eurovision\nAfter placing second five times, the United Kingdom finally won Eurovision ten years after its first entry in 1957. Harris himself would be the BBC's commentator for the final in Vienna. The show was seen by over 22 million viewers.\nVoting\nEvery participating broadcaster assembled a jury panel of ten people. Every jury member could give one point to his or her favourite song.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded to the United Kingdom\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=20% | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 7 points\n| ||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 5 points\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 points\n| |||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 points\n| ||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 point\n| ||}}\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded by the United Kingdom\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=20% | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 points\n| ||}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 point\n| |||}}\n|}\nReferences"
