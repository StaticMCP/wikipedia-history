The Southern Secondary runs from an interchange with Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CSAO) in Red Bank south to Lakewood. The Freehold Secondary runs from an interchange with CSAO in Jamesburg southeast to Farmingdale, New Jersey. The Delaware and Raritan River Railroad is a subsidiary of Chesapeake and Delaware, LLC.\nIn 2022, Chesapeake and Delaware, LLC filed to take over rail service from CSAO on the Southern Secondary and Freehold Secondary, portions of which are owned by CSAO and NJ Transit. The Delaware and Raritan River Railroad began operations on July 1, 2022. As a result of this new operation & its aggressive management plans to increase traffic, the five-mile stretch of previously dormant track between Freehold and Farmingdale was completely replaced with over 25,000 feet of new rail, 12,500 ties (8,500 of which are made from sustainable steel) and 7 road crossings between January 16, 2023, and September 15, 2023 (the work came in well ahead of time estimates and under budget).  A test train ran on the restored line September 15, and following a last spike-driven ceremony in Farmingdale on October 13, 2023, the line was officially opened for freight train service.\nThis effort allows train service to efficiently run from Jamesburg to Lakewood directly, the current end of active service. The D&RR has publicly stated they eventually plan on running as far south of Lakewood as Lakehurst, but this will need both additional track restoration & the customers to support it. A final, but important project on the line was activated with a ceremony on January&nbsp;8, 2024 in Farmingdale.\nA wye was constructed with a railroad crossing on Preventorium Road, installed the week of December&nbsp;4, 2023. This last puzzle piece, connecting track from Southard Avenue in Farmingdale to Preventoriam Road (approx. ), allows direct service from Jamesburg to Lakewood in the south without the need to reverse the train upon arrival in Farmingdale.  The result of this track segment construction is to enable one train to serve the entire line, rather than two trains on two separate routes. Also, the track's northernmost customers (currently Laird & Co. and Extech Building Products) allow for exempt track to currently remain in place from the Brick Recycling siding location in Howell (Collingswood) to Red Bank. Additionally, NJ Transit no longer needs to co-ordinate the D&RR freight trains around their busy North Jersey Coast Line commuter operations from New York City to Bay Head, New Jersey.\nLines\n*Southern Secondary\n*Freehold Secondary\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.cadrailroads.com/ Official website]"
