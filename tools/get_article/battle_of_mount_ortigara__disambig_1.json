On 25 June, the 11 Italian battalions guarding the summit were attacked by Austro-Hungarian shock troops which retook it, the strenuous Italian resistance notwithstanding.\nThe 52nd Division alone suffered about half the Italian casualties. General Ettore Mambretti, commander of the Sixth Army, was considered responsible for the heavy casualties and removed from command.\nA letter from a young soldier, written on the eve of the battle, is part of the museum of the Asiago War Memorial. Adolfo Ferrero wrote this letter to his family shortly before dying in combat, and the letter was later discovered in the personal effects of his page, whose body was exhumed from Mount Ortigara in the 1950s.\nFile:WWI - Monte Ortigara - Italian Alpini before the Battle for Monte Ortigara June 1917.jpg|Alpini before the Battle\nFile:WWI - Monte Ortigara - Heavy Italian artillery fires.jpg|Heavy Italian artillery at work\nFile:WWI - Monte Ortigara - Alpini observation post on Cima Levante.jpg|Italian officers at an observation post on Cima Levante\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.worldwar1.com/itafront/ortnew.htm The Battle of Ortigara]"
