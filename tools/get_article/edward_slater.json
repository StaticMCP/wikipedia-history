He received a training in biochemistry at the Ormond College of the University of Melbourne. In 1946, he moved to Cambridge, where he earned his PhD under the supervision of David Keilin.\nCareer\nIn 1955, Slater joined the medical faculty of the University of Amsterdam, where he remained until retiring in 1985. He is recognised for his contributions to the development of Dutch biochemistry.\nSlater managed the journal Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, turning it into one of the most influential publications in the field. He wrote a history of the journal, Biochimica et biophysica acta: the story of a biochemical journal, which was published in 1986.\nHe served as the president of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from 1988 until 1991.\nResearch\nSlater made contributions to the identification and understanding of the physiological role of the components of the respiratory chain, especially of the various cytochrome b complexes, iron–sulfur proteins and other iron-containing substances. He showed that the binding of certain inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation acting at different sites (antimycin on electron transport, oligomycin on the coupling between electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, and aurovertin in the ATP-synthesising enzyme) can be positively cooperative, and that the degree of cooperativity depends on the state of the mitochondrial membrane. He also demonstrated negative cooperative binding of a ligand to an enzyme (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase), which has implications for the mechanisms of cooperative binding generally.\nAwards and honours\nIn 1964, Slater became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1975.\nIn 1984, he was appointed a Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion, and in 1985 he was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science.\nHe was awarded honorary degrees by the University of Southampton (1993) and the University of Bari (1998).\nReferences"
