The awards, which recognized outstanding films and individuals from the magazine's inaugural year in 1995, officially launched in February 1996.\nThe first three awards ceremonies selected films from the preceding year in the early part of the following year. For the first two years (1st and 2nd editions), selections were made by regular readers, rather than by a panel of experts like critics and journalists. Beginning with the 3rd edition, to enhance professionalism, the selection method was changed, with Cine21's editorial staff serving as the selection committee.\nFrom the 4th edition onward, the editorial staff continued as the selection committee, but the awards ceremony itself, held for the first three editions, was discontinued. Instead, Cine21 began announcing \"Film of the Year\" and \"Filmmaker of the Year\" in its year-end issue. This method remains in practice today.\nPast Major Award Winners (Award Ceremony)\n1st Cine21 Film Awards\nThe 1st Cine21 Film Awards, honoring the 1995 Film Grand Prize Award, was held on February 6, 1996, at 5 PM.
