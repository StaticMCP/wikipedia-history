The winners of the contest, which usually comprises three or four titles, including Miss Grand England, Miss Grand Wales, Miss Grand Scotland, and Miss Grand Northern Ireland, represent their countries in the international parent contest, Miss Grand International. However, as the former licensee was unable to send the elected delegates to compete in the 2019 international contest in Venezuela, the competition license was transferred to Megan Darlington in 2020, and subsequently to Kathryn Fanshawe in mid-2022.\nSince its first participation in 2013, the United Kingdom has not won the Miss Grand International pageant but has placed among the top 20 finalists four times: in 2014, 2016, 2020, and 2022; and also won the best evening gown and best national costume awards in 2016 and 2022, respectively.\nHistory\nThe United Kingdom has been participating in the Miss Grand International since 2013. For the first two competitions in Thailand, its representatives were designated to join the contest, of which, Georgia Smith – Miss Grand United Kingdom 2014, became the first UK delegate placed at the contest.\nIn 2015, after Holly Louise – the director of the UK Power Pageant, acquired the licenses for England, Scotland, and Wales, she subsequently held the first contest of Miss Grand United Kingdom at Oxford Town Hall in the city of Oxford on 5 September. The contest consisted of 20 national finalists, in which Elizabeth Greenham, Taylor Stringfellow, and Danielle Latimer were announced Miss Grand England, Scotland, and Wales, respectively. During 2016&nbsp;-&nbsp;2019, Miss Grand UK winners were determined through the UK Power Pageant, which was also organized to select the country representatives for Miss International and . After Holly Louise was unable to send representatives for the Miss Grand International 2019 pageant in Venezuela due to safety concerns,  she lost the franchise to Megan Darlington in 2020, who later conducted the pageant for Miss Grand International separately in 2021, and then lost the license to Kathryn Fanshawe the following year.\nIn 2017, Ashleigh Coyle a 21-year-old Derry-based model and the runner-up Big Brother UK Series 15, was elected Miss Grand Northern Ireland 2017, however, she did not participate in the international stage in Vietnam with unknown reasons.\nEditions\nThe following list is the edition detail of the Miss Grand United Kingdom contest, since its inception in 2015.\nDate and venue\n{| class=\"wikitable defaultcenter col3left col4left\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n!
