Therefore, the countries exchange high commissioners, rather than ambassadors.\nUntil 2019, the UK had been represented in Eswatini in a non-resident fashion by its high commissioner to South Africa, but in 2018, it was announced that the UK would return to having a resident high commissioner.\nNon-resident high commissioners to Eswatini\n: as high commissioners to South Africa\n* 2013–2017: Dame Judith Macgregor\n* 2017–2019: Nigel Casey\nHigh commissioners to Eswatini\n* 2019–2020: John Lindfield MBE\n* 2020–2024: Simon Boyden\n* From August 2024: Colin Wells\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/world/zambia UK and Zambia], gov.uk\nReferences"
