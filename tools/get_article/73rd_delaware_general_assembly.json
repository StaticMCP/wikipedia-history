Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening January 3, 1865, two weeks before the beginning of the third and fourth year of the administration of Governor William Cannon. He died March 1, 1865, and nearly all the time was covered by Gove Saulsbury.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not affect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Democratic majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Gove Saulsbury, Kent County\n*William Hitch, Sussex County\nHouse of Representatives\n*Shephard P.
