The system is used for creating, approving, and storing contracts in digital form. Its clients include companies in sectors such as banking, education, retail, and services across Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Brazil.\nHistory\nThe company was founded in 2012 in Santiago by José Manuel Jiménez.\nIn the following years, Webdox expanded its operations to several Latin American markets. In 2021 it raised a US$7.3 million Series A investment round to strengthen its regional presence.  Two years later, in 2023, it signed a cooperation agreement with Deloitte Legal to promote the use of digital contract management in Latin America.  According to ACIS, in 2025 the company became the first CLM provider in Latin America to receive the ISO/IEC 42001 certification for artificial intelligence governance.\nTechnology\nWebdox CLM is a cloud-based platform that includes modules for contract drafting, approval, and electronic signature, following local legal standards such as Mexico’s NOM-151 and Chile’s Law 19.799.
