They included mathematical systems operated by William F. Boand, Frank G. Dickinson, and Dick Dunkel.\nChampions (by ranking)\nAll major rankings (both contemporary and retroactive) have identified the University of Southern California as the season's champions, with exception of Parke H. Davis's retroactive ranking for ''Spalding's Official Foot Ball Guide, which identified Pittsburgh and Purdue as co-champions.\n*Berryman QPRS: USC\n*Billingsley Report: USC\n*Boand System: USC\n*College Football Researchers Association: USC\n*Parke H.

All others were given retroactively''\nBoand System\nThe Boand System was a mathematical ranking system developed by William F. Boand and sometimes billed as the \"Azzi Ratem\" (as I rate 'em) system. Boand's final rating, issued in January 1933, ranked the teams as follows:\n1. USC - 166 points\n2. Michigan - 158 points\n3. Purdue - 151 points\n4. Pittsburgh - 150 points\n5. TCU - 143.4 points\n6. Tennessee - 142.4 points\n7. Notre Dame - 138.8 points\n8. Colgate - 136.1 points\n9. Auburn - 134.1 points\n10. Centenary - 133.7 points\nDickinson System\nThe Dickinson System was a mathematical rating system devised by University of Illinois economics professor Frank G. Dickinson.\n1. Michigan - 28.47 points\n2. USC - 26.81 points\n3. Pittsburgh - 26.40 points\n4. Purdue - 26.33 points\n5. Colgate - 25.00 points\n6. Ohio State - 23.60\n7. Notre Dame - 20.44 points\n8.
