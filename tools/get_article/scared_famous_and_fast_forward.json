      "text": "# Scared Famous and Fast Forward\n\nScared Famous and Fast Forward are the third and fourth albums by American recording artist Ariel Pink (credited as \"Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti\"). They were originally released on cassette as a double album by Ariel in 2001. A compilation album of the material from both albums was subsequently released by Human Ear Music in 2007. It consisted of only 17 tracks selected from the original cassettes.\nSome of the tracks from the original Scared Famous / Fast Forward release later appeared on the 2008 compilation Odditties Sodomies Vol.&nbsp;1, and select tracks from were rerecorded for Pink's later albums; \"Beverly Kills\" on Before Today (2010) and \"I Wanna Be Young\" on Dedicated to Bobby Jameson (2017).\nIn 2021, the albums were reissued by Mexican Summer as one unified release with improved sound quality.\nCritical reception\nReviewing the 2007 Scared Famous compilation, Pitchfork contributor  Andrew Gaerig wrote that it combined \"random brilliance with sonic bullshit.\" He concluded, \"The willfully negligent production and arrangement [from The Doldrums] remains, but viewed as a transition between his very early work and the slight improvements he'd made by House Arrest, they're nearly permissible.\"\nTrack listing\nOriginal release\n2007 – Human Ear Music reissue\n2021 – Mexican Summer reissue\nCredits\nScared Famous\n* Ariel Pink – all vocals and instruments, except:\n* R.
