And yet, the monument erected by the Meiji government upon request of surviving Shōgitai families, clearly and honestly mentions 1,500 Shōgitai versus around 10,000 imperial troops, hence the monument to their warrior spirit and loyalty (reference: Tomb of Shogi-Tai Warriors, Ueno Park, Taito City Board of Education, Oct. 2024). You can also refer to the painting for a visual depiction.\nBattle\nused by troops of the Saga Domain at the Battle of Ueno against the Shogunate's Shōgitai ]]\nThe Shōgitai took up positions around Kan'ei-ji , an important Tokugawa family temple, and the nearby Nezu Shrine . When the battle began, the forces of Satsuma, led by Saigō Takamori, attacked head-on at the gate, but were stopped by the Shōgitai forces, which were superior in number. The Satsuma forces suffered heavy casualties until the forces of Choshu managed to make a second attack from the rear, which unblocked the tactical stalemate. While the Shōgitai put up stiff resistance, the Tosa troops also used Armstrong cannons and Snider guns to devastating effect, thus ending the last center of resistance in Edo. According to Saigō Takamori:\nRinnōji no Miya escaped, reached Enomoto Takeaki's warship Chogei-maru and was dropped off further north, on the Pacific coast. Harada Sanosuke of the Shinsengumi is said to have joined the Shōgitai and died soon after this battle. About 300 Shōgitai are said to have died in the battle, and a thousand houses were burnt in collateral damage.\n]]\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Kikuchi Akira. Shinsengumi Hyakuichi no Nazo.
