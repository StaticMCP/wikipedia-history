The division was formed in November 1914 as the \"Division Posen 1\", part of the Posen Corps (Korps Posen), and became the 83rd Infantry Division in June 1915.  It was initially formed from the garrison infantry regiments of Fortress Posen (Festung Posen).  The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\nCombat chronicle\nDivision Posen 1 initially served on the Eastern Front, fighting in Poland, including at the 1914 Battle of Łódź, and then spent most of the period until mid-1915 fighting along the Rawka and Bzura Rivers. On June 2, 1915, it became the 83rd Infantry Division.  It fought on the Narew River in July and August 1915 and participated in the capture of Białystok on August 26, 1915, and the subsequent conquest of Grodno.  Until April 1917, it occupied the line along the Berezina River and was then along the Servech and Shchara Rivers for several months.  It remained in the Bukovina region until the armistice on the Eastern Front.  In March 1918, the division was sent to the Western Front, where it initially occupied the line in Lorraine and then moved to Flanders.  It went to the Somme region in August and returned to Lorraine in September, where it was for the remainder of the war.  Allied intelligence rated the division as fourth class.\nOrder of battle on formation\nThe 83rd Infantry Division was formed as a square division.
