It merged with Taunton Deane to form Somerset West and Taunton on 1 April 2019. The council covered a largely rural area, with a population of 35,075 in an area of .\nAccording to figures released by the Office for National Statistics in 2009, the population of West Somerset had the oldest average age in the United Kingdom at 52.\nThe largest centres of population were the coastal towns of Minehead (population 10,000) and Watchet (4,400).\nA scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \"schedule\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \"monument\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War.\nThere are 201 scheduled monuments in West Somerset. Some of the oldest, particularly on Exmoor and the Quantock Hills are Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age including hillforts, cairns, bowl barrows and other tumulis. More recent sites include several motte-and-bailey castles and church or village crosses which date from the Middle Ages. The geography with large numbers of streams is reflected by the number of packhorse and other bridges included in the list. The mining history of the area is also represented by several sections of the West Somerset Mineral Railway and associated ruins of mine buildings which are now scheduled. The most recent monuments are World War II pillboxes. The monuments are listed below using the titles given in the English Heritage data sheets.\nMonuments\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 16 October 2002\n| grid_ref = SS 90477 47370\n| lat = 51.2150\n| lon = -3.5695\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = A medieval holy well formed from stone slabs.\n| uid = 1020827\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Agnes Fountain - geograph.org.uk - 531910.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = SS 83680 42326\n| lat = 51.1683\n| lon = -3.6651\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = A bowl barrow  in diameter.\n| uid = 1006203\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Aldermans Barrow (geograph 3359553).jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat = Alderman's Barrow\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref =SS 89989 46655\n| lat = 51.2085\n| lon = -3.5762\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = A medieval stone bridge which was largely rebuilt in 1630 and again in 1866 over Horner Water.\n| uid = 1006197\n| show_img = yes\n| image =\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = SS 90512 46923\n| lat = 51.2161\n| lon = -3.5691\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Built as a crossing over the River Aller, it is thought to be medieval in origin.

There is an additional rampart  to the west, with a deep ditch. The rampart is revetted with drystone walling. In the late 1130s, a civil war, known as the Anarchy, broke out in England between the supporters of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda. A motte and bailey castle was built on the Bury Castle side, probably by William de Say. In 1198 Richard I confirmed that Brompton should be part of the inheritance of Matilda. The motte measures  and was placed on the southern tip of the promontory, with the bailey beyond around  across.\n| uid = 1006170\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Geograph 3319707 Site of Bury Castle, Iron Age Fort.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat = Bury Castle, Somerset\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q5001077\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 4 April 1949\n| grid_ref = SS 91744 47171\n| lat = 51.2134\n| lon = -3.5513\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = An enclosure covering  surrounded by a bank and ditch.\n| uid = 1008808\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Geograph 3319707 Site of Bury Castle, Iron Age Fort.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =\n}}\n| grid_ref = SS9881243873\n| lat = 51.185099\n| lon = -3.449189\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes= The Butter Cross has an octagonal base and polygonal shaft which probably date from the 15th century.

The inscription, in Latin, can be translated as \"grandson or immediate descendant of Caratacus\", has led to the general opinion that the stone was probably erected as a memorial to a person who claimed the first-century British chieftain Caratacus as an ancestor. The first mention of the stone was in 1219, when it was described in a perambulation of the Royal Forest of Exmoor as \"the Langeston\". In 1890 the letter  (which is reversed) was missing from the inscription, but by 1919 the missing piece had been found and was cemented back in place. In 1906 a shelter was erected over the stone, and an excavation in 1937 revealed that the stone was not associated with a burial site.\n| uid = 1021228\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Caratacus Stone full view.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat = Caratacus Stone\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q1035420\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 14 January 2005\n| grid_ref = ST 02057 34260\n| lat = 51.0993\n| lon = -3.4002\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = The remains of the Carnarvon New Pit iron mine and a section of the West Somerset Mineral Railway which served it.

The abbey was founded in the late twelfth century as a house for monks of the austere Cistercian order. In 1536 Cleeve was closed by Henry VIII in the course of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the abbey was converted into a country house. Subsequently, the status of the site declined and the abbey was used as farm buildings until the latter half of the nineteenth century when steps were taken to conserve the remains. In the twentieth century Cleeve was taken into state care; the abbey is now looked after by English Heritage and is open to the public. While the church is no longer standing, the conventual buildings are still roofed and habitable and contain many features of particular interest including the 'angel' roof in the refectory and the wall paintings in the painted chamber.\n| uid = 1014824\n| show_img = yes\n| image = CleeveAbbeyDormitoryC.jpg\n| commonscat = Cleeve Abbey\n| upload_desc = Cleeve Abbey\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q775473\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = SS 79437 37350\n| lat = 51.12270\n| lon = -3.7241\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Cow Castle is an Iron Age Hillfort which occupies an isolated hilltop and has a single rampart and ditch, enclosing .

The fort is situated on an east-west cliff about  above the sea, on a tapering spur of land bounded by the Washford River. The ramparts of the fort would have formed a semicircle backing on to the sheer cliffs, but coastal erosion has reduced the size of the enclosure, and later destruction by farming, limekilns, and the B3191 road, have left only about  of ramparts visible today. The fort may be of Iron Age origin, but was (re)built and fortified as a burh by King Alfred, as part of his defence against Viking raids from the Bristol Channel around 878 AD. It would have been one of a chain of forts and coastal lookout posts, connected by the Herepath, or military road, which allowed Alfred to move his army along the coast, covering Viking movements at sea.\n| uid = 1020882\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Daws Castle Somerset Map.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q5242247\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = SS 94045 47920\n| lat = 51.2206\n| lon = -3.5186\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Earthworks of a medieval farmhouse  by .

There are five hundred and forty nest-holes. In the 18th century the floor level and door were raised among several major alterations. The lower tiers of nest holes were blocked to protect against Brown Rats which had arrived in the Britain in 1720 and reached Somerset by 1760. A revolving ladder, known as a \"potence\", was installed to allow the pigeon keeper to search the nest holes more easily. In the 19th century two feeding platforms were added to the axis of the revolving ladder.\n| uid = 1020408\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Dunster Dovecote.JPG\n| upload_desc = Dovecote\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n|commonscat=Dunster Priory Dovecote\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q5315734\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = SS 92475 45284\n| lat = 51.1967\n| lon = -3.5403\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = The Dovecot At Blackford Farm was built in the 11th century.
