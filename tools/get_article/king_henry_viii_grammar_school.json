In this case, a school that had been associated with the local Priory Church was administered by the (now Protestant) state instead.\nThe school provided free education to boys in the local area who passed an entrance examination. The school motto was \"Ut Prosim\" (\"That I may be of service\") and the school colours were red and blue. The school was divided into two houses, Oppidan and Rustican, from the Latin for Town and Country.\nThe school was merged with the local Girls' High School in 1963 and later became a comprehensive school when selection at 11 was abolished. The school is now operating as King Henry VIII School Abergavenny.\nA former pupil of the school, David Lewis, was the first Principal of Jesus College, Oxford. Amongst other distinguished pupils, well-known writer and critic Raymond Williams gave a fictionalised account of his time there in the novel \"Border Country\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.formerpupils.co.uk/khs/history/ Timeline] – Former Pupils Association\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160325122852/http://www.walesher1974.org/her/groups/GGAT/media/ReportPDF/ King Henry VIII School, Abergavenny] – archaeological desk-based assessment\n*\n* [https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/300016470-the-drama-centre-former-king-henry-viii-grammar-school-abergavenny Former King Henry VIII Grammar School, Abergavenny] on BritishListedBuildings.co.uk\n* [https://www.british-history.ac.uk/topographical-dict/england/pp1-5#h3-0022 British History Online: Topographical Dictionary, Lewis, 1845: Abergavenny]\n* [https://www.abergavennychronicle.com/article.cfm?id=106623&headline=Multi-million%20pound%20rebuild%20of%20King%20Henry%20VIII%20confirmed%20by%20Monmouthshire%20County%20Council&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2017 Abergavenny Chronicle: Multi-million pound rebuild of King Henry VIII confirmed by Monmouthshire County Council].
