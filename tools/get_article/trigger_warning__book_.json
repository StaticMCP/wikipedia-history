      "text": "# Trigger Warning (book)\n\nTrigger Warning is a collection of short fiction and verse by Neil Gaiman. It was first published in the United States in 2015 by William Morrow. The title is a reference to the concept of trigger warnings, originally intended to warn victims of sexual abuse or other trauma about potentially graphic content, and its recent prominence in contemporary discourse. In his introduction to the book, Neil Gaiman considers the question of whether stories should be considered \"safe spaces\", and, concluding that they should not, warns readers that the stories in this collection may disturb them.\nMost of the stories in the book are reprints from other sources, such as magazines and anthologies, but \"Black Dog\", a new short story sequel to American Gods featuring its main character, Shadow, was purpose-written for this collection.\nThe book won the Locus Award for Best Collection in 2016.\nContents\n# Introduction\n# Making a Chair\n# A Lunar Labyrinth\n# The Thing About Cassandra\n# Down to a Sunless Sea\n# \"The Truth Is a Cave in the Black Mountains\"\n# My Last Landlady\n# Adventure Story\n# Orange\n# A Calendar of Tales\n# The Case of Death and Honey\n# The Man Who Forgot Ray Bradbury\n# Jerusalem\n# Click-Clack the Rattlebag\n# An Invocation of Incuriosity\n# \"And Weep, Like Alexander\"\n# Nothing O'Clock\n# Diamonds and Pearls: A Fairy Tale\n# The Return of the Thin White Duke\n# Feminine Endings\n# Observing the Formalities\n# The Sleeper and the Spindle\n# Witch Work\n# In Relig Odhråin\n# Black Dog\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*"
