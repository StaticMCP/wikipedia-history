Trump's win was partially attributed to independent voters or voters unregistered with the Republican party or the Democratic party. Donald Trump carried a majority of twelve of the nineteen possible delegates, while John Kasich carried five and Ted Cruz carried two. Marco Rubio, the worst performing candidate, who had dropped out but still had ballot access, received no delegates.\nAftermath\nThe following primary would be Indiana, and resulted in another landslide in favor of Donald Trump. Following Indiana, Florida would hold its own primary, Marco Rubio's home state, and would vote for Donald Trump in an unexpected turn. Following the results, John Kasich would suspend his trailing campaign along with Ted Cruz.\nResults\nDonald Trump won the contest with 63.7% of the popular vote, with John Kasich ending second with 24.3%, and Ted Cruz ending in third place with 10.4%. Trump carried a majority of 12 possible delegates, while John Kasich carried 5 and Ted Cruz carried 2. Marco Rubio, who had dropped out but still had ballot access, received no delegates.\nReferences"
