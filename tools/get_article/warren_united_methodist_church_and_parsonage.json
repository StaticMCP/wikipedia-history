The church was started in 1789 under the Rev. Daniel Smith and was the first Methodist congregation in Rhode Island, and the second in all New England.  The building is a Greek Revival structure with a full temple front built in 1844 by Fall River, Massachusetts architect Perez Mason. The parsonage is a two-story Italianate structure built by the congregation in 1858. It was designed by the Warren firm of Hoar & Drown and built by the related firm of Hoar & Martin.\nThe two buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Bristol County, Rhode Island\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://umcwarrenbristol.org/index.htm Church website]"
