Two Egyptian motor torpedo boats were sunk in the action for no Israeli losses.\nBackground\nFollowing Israel's victory in the Six-Day War, Israel's coastline was significantly enlarged and now included the Sinai Peninsula coast. The Israeli Navy now sought to enforce Israeli sovereignty over this large area and began regular patrols of the Sinai coastline up to the approaches of Port Said.\nBattle\nOn July 9, , an ex-British Royal Navy Z-class destroyer commanded by Yitzhak Shushan, proceeded due west toward the Sinai coast. INS Eilat subsequently rendezvoused with ex-French motor torpedo boats Aya and Daya of the Torpedo fleet. The flotilla patrolled northwest of the Sinai coast, under orders to stop vessels crossing the demarcation line toward the Sinai coast.\nOn July 11, at approximately 21:45 pm, the signals intelligence intercept operator in Eilat reported two Egyptian missile boats were about to sortie. The Israeli torpedo boats picked up a target on radar shortly thereafter. The Egyptians were about 15 miles from the MTBs and 12 miles from Eilat, moving east at . The Israelis marked a course to intercept. Eilat closed from the north, Aya and Daya from the east.  The Egyptian vessels, later identified as P 6-class torpedo boats, discovered the Israeli MTBs approaching at full speed and commenced fire. The Israelis returned fire with Bofors and Oerlikons. The initial run scored no hits but the Egyptian MTBs dispersed. The separation enabled Eilat to close one and the two MTBs the other. Twenty minutes later, both P 6s were ablaze. The fire caused their torpedoes to explode. There were no Israeli losses and no known Egyptian survivors.\nGallery\nFile:Mapromani67.jpg|Map of naval battle fought on July 11, 1967 off Sinai coast, written in Hebrew.\nFile:INSEilat.jpg|INS Eilat, ex-Royal Navy Z-class destroyer.\nFile:TBP183.jpg|Soviet-built Egyptian MTB, similar to the ones used by the Egyptians at Rumani.\nFile:Tsqd914.jpg|Israeli MTBs.
