It is estimated that over five million people participated in over 2,000 events nationwide in the largest coordinated protests since the start of the second Trump administration.\nBackground\nThe No Kings protests were aimed at opposing the policies and actions of the Donald Trump administration. Due to the parade coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday, anti-Trump activists have interpreted the event as an example of Trump using the US Armed Forces to conduct an authoritarian or king-like celebration of himself. The protests followed several days of demonstrations against ICE raids across the US,}} including in Los Angeles, where Trump deployed both the California National Guard and the US Marine Corps. The American Federation of Teachers and Communications Workers of America, organized the protests. The No Kings theme was created by the 50501 movement, and derives its name from the perceived authoritarian or tyrannical behavior of Trump and his administration. Critics and activists have compared Trump to an absolute monarch due to his defiance of court orders, extralegal deportations, and perceived disregard for civil rights. Democrats Abroad organized solidarity protests internationally with the term of \"No Tyrants\", as many countries have monarchs as heads of state. Its message was, \"We reject authoritarianism. We reject fear. We reject tyrants.\"\nTrump publicly opposed the demonstrations and stated that protestors interfering with the parade itself would be \"met with heavy force\".\nList of Locations\nProtests by U.S. State\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!State\n!Protest\n!Estimated attendance\n!Notes\n!Photo\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|Mobile\n|~2,000\n|; In Mobile, organizers reported receiving threats ahead of the rally;\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|Montgomery\n|400+\n|across from the State Capitol.\n|-\n|Tuscaloosa\n|100+\n|Several hundred attended the No Kings rally in Tuscaloosa outside the Richard Shelby Federal Building and Courthouse.\n|-\n|Other\n|\n|Six cities in North Alabama hosted demonstrations: Huntsville, Florence, Scottsboro, Fort Payne, Guntersville, and Athens.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\n|Anchorage\n|1,000+\n|Thousands attended the No Kings demonstration in downtown Anchorage.\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|Fairbanks\n|~2,000\n|Approximately 2,000 people rallied outside Pioneer Park in Fairbanks.\n|-\n|Homer\n|~600\n|Demonstrations drew approximately 600 people in Homer\n|-\n|Sitka\n|~300\n|300 people in Sitka.\n|-\n|Other\n|\n|There were also 14 other demonstrations elsewhere in Alaska.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|Phoenix\n|~20,000\n|~20,000 people rallied at the Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza outside the State Capitol in Phoenix despite extreme heat\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|Tuscon\n|1,000+\n|Thousands rallied in Tuscon\n|-\n|Flagstaff\n|3,000+\n|3,000+ people attended rallies in Flagstaff\n|-\n|Other\n|\n|Thousands of people protested at more than 40 events in Arizona\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|Fayetteville\n|~5,000\n|~5,000 participated in Fayetteville\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|Little Rock\n|8,000+\n|8,000+ gathered in Little Rock.\n|-\n|Other\n|\n|Multiple other protests were planned in Arkansas.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|San Francisco\n|~50,000\n|~50,000 people protested in San Francisco\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|San Diego\n|~60,000\n|~60,000 people protested in San Diego demonstration\n|-\n|Los Angeles City Hall\n|~200,000\n|~200,000 protested outside of Los Angeles City Hall\n|-\n|Other\n|\n|Other rallies occurred in Fresno, Los Angeles, Pasadena, Santa Barbara, Sacramento, Santa Monica, Monterey, Berkeley, and Oakland.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|Colorado Springs\n|1000\n|Thousands rallied in downtown Colorado Springs, with crowds lining the sidewalk for nearly a mile from City Hall to Colorado College.\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|Denver\n|1000\n|Thousands attended the rally in Denver.\n|-\n|Other\n|\n|Dozens of events occurred in Colorado, in locations ranging from large cities to small towns.\nSome of the largest Colorado rallies outside of Denver occurred in Boulder and Fort Collins, with thousands attending in each city.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|Hartford\n|9,000+\n|9,000–10,000 in Hartford.\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Other\n|\n|Approximately 30 events were planned in Connecticut.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|Dover\n|100\n|Hundreds of people gathered in Dover, Delaware.\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Other\n|\n|There was also a protest which gathered several thousands in Wilmington.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"14\" |\n|Tallahassee\n|~1,000\n|In North Florida, an estimated 1,000 people protested in Tallahassee\n| rowspan=\"14\" |\n|-\n|Jacksonville\n|more than 1\n|In Jacksonville, residents protested on Beach Boulevard  and downtown at the Duval County Courthouse\n|-\n|Cocoa and Palm Bay\n|2,000+\n|2,000+ people protested in Cocoa and Palm Bay\n|-\n|Vero Beach\n|~2,000\n|About 2,000 people gathered in Vero Beach\n|-\n|St. Petersburg\n|1,000+\n|1,000+ people attended the St. Petersburg protest\n|-\n|Sarasota\n|~7,000\n|7,000 people attending a protest at J.D.
