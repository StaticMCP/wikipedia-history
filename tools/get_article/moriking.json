Aside from the horn on his head and wings on his back, he looks perfectly human but maintains his beetle traits, like walking on walls and flying. As an Insect King, which are said to be born once every one hundred million years, Moriking announces that he is destined to be  and rule over all insects. To prove their worth would-be kings must leave their homes and survive in the world beyond, this is how Moriking came into Shota's possession and becomes a member of the Aikawa family. However, he is but one of five insects competing to become King of the Forest.\nPublication\nWritten and illustrated by Tomohiro Hasegawa, Moriking was serialized in Shueisha's  manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from April 13, 2020, to January 18, 2021.

Beveridge said that despite having many of the familiar 1980s manga trappings, Moriking uses them in a different way. He wrote that while the series is not high-art, it is a fun title that is easy to pickup and keep up with because of its quirkiness. Beveridge felt that Hasegawa was able to end the series on his own terms. He reflected that the manga unfolded in a way that reminded him of Rumiko Takahashi's early works, and despite turning into a tournament series, was still spaced out in a way that kept the character material fun. He ended by calling Moriking \"a fun and enjoyable romp with good artwork, [some] nice twists and details to it, and enjoyable humor.\"\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
