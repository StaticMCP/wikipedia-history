Terrorism is defined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, civilian population, or any segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives. This timeline includes incidents committed by both domestic and international actors, covering a wide range of ideologies and motivations.\nThe deadliest terrorist attack in United States history was the September 11 attacks, in which 2,977 victims were killed when al-Qaeda operatives hijacked four commercial airliners in 2001. Other large-scale attacks include the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people; the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre, in which 120 - 140 people were killed; and the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, which resulted in 50 deaths. These remain the 4 most severe acts of terrorism in the country.\nPatterns of terrorism in the United States have shifted significantly over time. Early incidents included anarchist bombings and politically motivated assassinations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as violence linked to racial conflict, civil rights struggles, Puerto Rican nationalist movements, and opposition to the Vietnam War. Since the late 20th century, major themes include anti-government extremism, jihadist-inspired attacks, and white nationalism.\nBetween 2010 and 2021, at least 231 terrorist incidents or plots were documented in the United States, resulting in approximately 145 deaths and more than 370 injuries. In 2021 alone, there were 73 recorded plots or attacks, compared with 29 in 2015.\nAttacks by date\n1750–99\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!#\n!Date\n!Type\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" | Dead\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" | Injured\n!Location\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Details\n!Perpetrator\n|-\n|1\n|March 8, 1782\n|Massacre\n|96\n|2\n| Gnadenhutten, Ohio (then part of the Indian reserve / Ohio Country)\n|Gnadenhutten massacre – Pennsylvania militia round up and execute 96 unarmed pacifist Christian Delaware (Lenape) Indians, including 69 women and children, as revenge for raids against settlers (carried out by other Indians) as well as in expression of general animosity towards all Native Americans.

The intent of this hijacking was to use the ship as a blockade runner for the Confederacy under belief that they had an official Confederate letter of marque. The perpetrators had planned to re-coal at Saint John, New Brunswick, and head south to Wilmington, North Carolina.  Instead, the captors had difficulties at Saint John; so they sailed further east and re-coaled in Halifax, Nova Scotia. U.S. forces responded to the attack by trying to arrest the captors in Nova Scotian waters. All of the Chesapeake hijackers were able to escape extradition through the assistance of William Johnston Almon, a prominent Nova Scotian and Confederate sympathizer.\n|Pro-Confederate British subjects\n|-\n|23\n|October 19, 1864\n|Robbery/Murder/Hostage-taking/Attempted arson\n|1\n|2\n| St. Albans, Vermont\n|On October 19, 1864, non-properly uniformed Confederate soldiers led by Bennett H.

Booth succeeded in assassinating Lincoln at Ford's Theatre, Seward suffered numerous stab wounds by Powell who stabbed others as he was chased out of Seward's home, and Atzerodt failed to carry out the planned murder of Johnson. Booth was killed by soldiers when he failed to surrender. Eight conspirators were tried and convicted for their role in the conspiracy by a military tribunal, including Powell and Atzerodt. Four defendants were executed for their roles including Powell, Azterodt and Mary Surratt, whom many historians conclude was probably innocent. Surratt was the first woman ever to be executed by the U.S. government.\n|John Wilkes Booth, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt and co-conspirators\n|-\n|25\n|March 1871\n|Mob violence\n|~30\n|unknown\n| Meridian, Mississippi\n|Meridian Race Riot of 1871 – A highly contentious trial regarding the persecution of Black freedmen by the Ku Klux Klan and subsequent retaliation by the freedmen led to a gunfight in the courtroom and the death of the presiding judge.

As a delusional newspaper man, he found himself unable to influence policy in Washington or Chicago and ultimately took it upon himself to change the course of history by assassinating the powerful mayor. He felt that his inevitable acquittal would establish a precedent wherein Christian law would be established throughout the city. Prendergast was convicted, held to be sane by a jury (allowing for him to be executed), and ultimately hanged on July 14, 1894.\n|Patrick Eugene Prendergast\n|}\n1900–59\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!#\n!Date\n!Type\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" | Dead\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" | Injured\n!Location(s)\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Details\n!Perpetrator\n|-\n|30\n|September 6, 1901\n|Assassination, shooting\n|1\n|0\n| Buffalo, New York\n|Assassination of William McKinley – President William McKinley is assassinated by Michigan-born anarchist Leon Czolgosz, in Buffalo, New York.\n|Leon Czolgosz\n|-\n|31\n|December 30, 1905\n|Assassination, bombing\n|1\n|0\n| Caldwell, Idaho\n|Former Idaho governor Frank Steunenberg is killed by a bomb in front of his Caldwell, Idaho home.

In the explosion 36 school children and two teachers were killed. As rescuers arrived to help, Kehoe drove up in his truck and detonated another cache of dynamite stored there, which killed himself, the school superintendent, and several others, while injuring bystanders as well. Afterward, 500 more pounds of dynamite with a timing device were found in the south wing which Kehoe apparently set to go off at the same time but failed, and would have succeeded in destroying the entire school. Prior to the bombings, Kehoe murdered his wife and also destroyed his farm buildings with dynamite. The worst mass murder at a school in US history, it may also be the first suicide truck bombing.
