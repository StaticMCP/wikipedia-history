The expedition failed and was Spain's first attempt to seize the Malukus.\nBackground\nIn 1582, the Spanish governor of Philippines, Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa, was ordered by the Spanish king, Philip II, to seize the Maluku Islands and other Portuguese areas and establish the Spanish authority there. An expedition was launched with a force of 300 Spaniards and 1,500 Filipinos. The command was given to the governor's nephew, Sebastian Ronquillo.\nBattle\nThe expedition left Manilla and first sailed to Borneo then Ternate. Sebastian took Pablo de Lima, who was married to the niece of the King of Tidor, and appointed him to be the governor of Ternate. The Spaniards proceeded to Ternate, where the Ternateans were determined to resist the Spanish landing, but their resistance was short as they were forced to retreat to their fort. The Spaniards began erecting artillery and bombarded the walls but to no avail. The Spaniards then laid a regular siege. However, a Beri-Beri epidemic broke out in the camp which wiped out two-thirds of the men, forcing Sebastian to raise the blockade and sail to Manilla.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
