The SSRB replaced the Belarusian People's Republic, and consisted of the governorates of Smolensk, Vitebsk, Mogilev, Minsk, Grodno, and Vilna.\nIt was considered by Bolsheviks to be a buffer republic. In a month it was disbanded. The Smolensk, Vitebsk and Mogilev provinces were included in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), and the remainder formed another buffer republic, the Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Litbel).\nSecond establishment\nThe republic was re-established under the same name on 31 July 1920. However, in traditional Soviet historiography it has been referred to as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR), its name after the incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1922.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.belarus.by/ru/belarus/history/6/4/ First establishment of SSRB]\n*[http://www.belarus.by/ru/belarus/history/6/6/index.php Second establishment of SSRB]\n*[http://icpo-vad.tripod.com/const-ssrb.html The 1920 SSRB Constitution]"
