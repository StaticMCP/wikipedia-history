It uses a mix of acted scenes, archive footage, and animation. All episodes were directed by , series authors were Jan Peter and Yury Winterberg. In a dramatic advisory capacity, Dutch producer and screenwriter Maarten van der Duin and BBC-author Andrew Bampfield worked on the film's development. The series is based on an idea by Gunnar Dedio, producer at the film company LOOKSfilm and Ulrike Dotzer, the Head of Department ARTE at Norddeutscher Rundfunk.\nSynopsis\nThe individual episodes of the series tell the story of the First World War, not from the perspective of politicians and the military; but from the perspective of soldiers, housewives, factory workers, nurses and children. In total there are 14 main characters. Meaningful scenes from their lives are re-enacted and intertwined. The result is not only a political or military history of the First World War, but a story that poignantly captures the feelings and moods of the people.\nEpisodes\n| ShortSummary    = In the records of the young Cossack Marina Yurlova, the Austrian farmer Karl Kasser and the children Yves Congar and Elfriede Kuhr, who are experiencing the outbreak of war at home, there is little room for jubilant patriotism. The episode describes how everyday life collapsed with the beginning of the war, together with the inflammatory speeches of a teacher and the heroic portrayals of the first days of the war.\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n}}\n}}\nCast and characters\n* Sarah Broom Macnaughtan (portrayed by Celia Bannerman) was born on 26 October 1864 in Partick, Scotland.

Le Monde ascribes to the series \"a never before seen virtuosity\", while Direct Matin calls it \"of exceptional quality.\" The Dutch version of the series was described as follows by NRC Handelsblad: \"Phantastic Television Making...
