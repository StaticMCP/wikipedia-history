Built in 1890, by the plans of the German architect Kaverau, to keep the findings of the excavations, and after two years (1892) was extended under the plans of the Greek architect J. Mousis.\nHistory\nThe city of Elefsina and the Eleusinian Mysteries are the two main themes of the museum's displays. There is a collection of objects dating from the 5th century BC, when the reputation of the temple was panhellenic, and the number of believers who moved there in order to attend the ceremonies of the Eleusinian Mysteries had increased significantly.\nMany of the findings are associated with these ceremonies. The Votive piglet reminds the sacrifice of these animals for the purgation of the believers at Phaleron, which took place in some of the preparatory stages of the ceremonies, and the kernos, a ceremonial vessel which was used at the sacrifices and at the offerings made to the altars and the temples, during the return of the sacred symbols through the Holy Road from the Ancient Agora back again to the Sanctuary for the final initiation.\nAmong the most important exhibits of the museum are included: the monumental protoattic amphora  from the middle of the 7th century BC, with the depiction of Medusa's beheading by\nPerseus, the famous \"fleeing kore\"   from the archaic period, that probably comes from the\narchitectural design of the Sacred House, the large headless statue of the goddess Demeter, probably the work of Agorakrito's school - a student of Pheidias-, and the\nCaryatid from the roof of the small Propylaea, bringing on her head the ciste, the\ncontainer holding the sacred articles of the ceremony, with a relief appearance of the symbols of the Eleusinian cult, which are: the ear of grain, the poppies, the rozetes and the kernos.\nMarble sarcophagus in Eleusis Museum\nThe two most important findings of Eleusis have been transferred to the National Archaeological Museum of Athens and at the Museum of Eleusis exist only their copies. The\nfirst is the relief of the 5th century BC, height 2.20 m, showing Demeter, the Kore and\nthe King of Eleusis Triptolemos, who is preparing to teach agriculture to the world,\naccording to the instructions of the goddess. The second is the clay table known as the Ninnion Tablet with a gable,\ndedicated by Ninnion, from the 4th century BC, with scenes from the ceremonies at the\ntemple of Demeter, which its significance consists in the information that provides on\nthe strict secret rituals of the Eleusinian mysteries.\nIn addition, the museum houses a full collection of pottery, dating from Middle Helladic\nEra (2000 or 1950-1580 BC) to the early Christian times, written tables, metal items, inscriptions and reliefs, including the important votive relief of Rheitoi, with Demeter, the Kore, Athena and an Eleusinian man, which at the\nbottom has instructions for bridging the lake of Rheitoi (Koumoundourou lake).\nIn 2023 February, the Museum has reopened to the public following the conclusion of restoration works.\nGallery\nFemale figurine, marble, Neolithic, AM Eleusis, Elem512.jpg\nFemale figurines, Mycenaean Bird Goddesses, AM Eleusus, Elem513.jpg\nRoom I, AM Eleusis, 081143.jpg\nFunerary Proto-Attic Amphora with a depiction of the blinding of Polyphemus by Odysseus and his companions, 670-660 BCE, Eleusis Museum (15421822644).jpg|Blinding of Polyphemus\nGorgons, Proto-Attic neck amphora, ca 650 BC, AM Eleusis, Elem03.jpg\nBlack-figure pottery, Midas, Hermes, Silenos, 500 BC, AM Eleusis, 081188.jpg\nDemeter and Kore, marble relief, 500-475 BC, AM Eleusis, 081135.jpg|Demeter and Kore\nRelief, Triptolemus on dragon chariot, AM Eleusis, Elem65.jpg|Triptolemus on chariot\nLarge relief, marble, torso, Hades and Persephone, 100-90 BC, AM Eleusis, 081147.jpg|The Lacrateides Relief\nLarge relief, marble, torso, Hades and Persephone, 100-90 BC, AM Eleusis, 081149.jpg|Hades and Persephone relief (detail)\nKore, Hellenistic, torso, archaizing, AM Eleusis, 081155.jpg\nThe upper part of one of the caryatids that flanked the Lesser Propylaea of Eleusis, made in Attica in about 50 BC, Eleusis Museum (16172984501).jpg|Caryatid from Demeter's sanctuary\nAthena in flower, Roman Age statue, AM Eleusis, 081162.jpg|Athena in a flower\nDionysos, Roman Age smaller statue, AM Eleusis, 081158.jpg|Dionysus statuette\nAntinous, life-size marble statue, 130-135 AD, AM Eleusis, 081167.jpg|Antinous as Asclepius\nSee also\n*List of museums in Greece\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160316221037/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh151.jsp?obj_id=3429 Archaeological Museum of Eleusis - Hellenic Ministry of Culture]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130411014918/http://www.latsis-foundation.org/megazine/publish/ebook.php?book=37&preloader=1 Archaeological Museum of Eleusis - Ebook by Latsis Foundation]"
