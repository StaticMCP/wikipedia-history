Chalai was the final Sea Tiger base held by the LTTE during the Northern Theatre of Eelam War IV. Fighting lasted for five days, following which the 55 Division took control of the area. During the engagement, one soldier was wounded when a bomb carried by a child between 13 and 16 years of age exploded. The Sri Lankan Army indicates this suicide bomber was sent by the LTTE. Witnesses describe the boy behaving as though he had been \"drugged or severely harassed before the mission.\"\nSee also\n*List of Sri Lankan Civil War battles\nReferences"
