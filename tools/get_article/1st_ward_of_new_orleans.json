It is geographically one of the smaller wards of the city. Roughly triangular in shape, the boundaries are Thalia Street (below which is the city's 2nd Ward), Felicity Street (above which is the 10th Ward), and the Mississippi River. The majority of this is in the historic Lower Garden District.\nHistory\nHouse on Coliseum Square\nThis was an area of Uptown New Orleans urbanized in the early decades of the 19th century. Despite the \"First\" designation, this was neither the oldest section of the city nor its seat of government. The current \"1st  Ward\" was a result of a redrawing of divisions within the city in 1852, prior to which the city had been governed for a generation as 3 separate municipalities, each with its own wards. The First Ward of the newly unified city was designated as identical to the boundaries of the First Ward of the old 2nd Municipality as designated in 1847.\nReferences"
