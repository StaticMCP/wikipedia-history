The founding rebbe (hereditary rabbinical dynastic leader) was Meir Rosenbaum, a son of Mordechai, rebbe of Nadvorna. His sons and successors included Eliezer Zev in Kretshnif and Sighit, and Issamar of Nadvorna (d. 1973) in Chernowitz. The descendant rabbis of this dynasty are mainly in Israel, New York City, England, and Canada.\nDynasty\n*Grand Rabbi Meir Rosenbaum of Nadvorna-Kretshniff (d. 1908), son of Rabbi Mordechai Leifer
