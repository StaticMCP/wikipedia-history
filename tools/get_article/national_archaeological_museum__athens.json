It is considered one of the greatest museums in the world and contains the richest collection of Greek Antiquity artifacts worldwide. It is situated in the Exarcheia area in central Athens between Epirus Street, Bouboulinas Street and Tositsas Street while its entrance is on the Patission Street, adjacent to the historical building of the National Technical University of Athens.\nHistory\nThe first national archaeological museum in Greece was established by the governor of Greece, Ioannis Kapodistrias, in Aigina in 1829. Subsequently, the archaeological collection was relocated to a number of exhibition places until 1858, when an international architectural competition was announced for the location and the architectural design of the new museum.\nThe current location was proposed and the construction of the museum's building began in 1866 and was completed in 1889, using funds from the Greek Government, the Greek Archaeological Society and the society of Mycenae. Major benefactors were Eleni Tositsa who donated the land for the building of the museum, and Demetrios and Nikolaos Vernardakis from Saint Petersburg, who donated a large amount for the completion of the museum.\nThe initial name for the museum was The Central Museum. It was renamed to its current name in 1881 by the Prime Minister of Greece, Charilaos Trikoupis. In 1887, the important archaeologist Valerios Stais became the museum's curator.\nDuring World War II, the museum was closed and the antiquities were sealed in special protective boxes and buried, in order to avoid their destruction and looting. In 1945, exhibits were again displayed under the direction of Christos Karouzos and Semni Karouzou. The south wing of the museum houses the Epigraphical Museum with the richest collection of inscriptions in the world. The inscriptions museum expanded between 1953 and 1960, with the architectural designs of Patroklos Karantinos.\nThe building\nThe museum has an imposing neo-classical design which was very popular in Europe at the time and is in accordance with the classical style artifacts that it houses. The initial plan was conceived by the architect Ludwig Lange and it was later modified by Panagis Kalkos who was the main architect, Armodios Vlachos and Ernst Ziller. At the front of the museum there is a large neo-classic design garden which is decorated with sculptures.\nExpansions and renovations\n]]\nThe building has undergone many expansions. Most important were the construction of a new east wing in the early 20th century, based on the plans of Anastasios Metaxas and the construction of a two-storeyed building, designed by George Nomikos, during 1932–1939. These expansions were necessary to accommodate the rapidly growing collection of artifacts. The most recent refurbishment of the museum took more than 1.5&nbsp;years to complete, during which the museum remained completely closed. It reopened in July 2004, in time for the Athens Olympics and it included an aesthetic and technical upgrade of the building, installation of a modern air-conditioning system, reorganisation of the museum's collection and repair of the damage caused by the 1999 earthquake. The Minoan frescoes rooms opened to the public in 2005.[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/news/content.asp?aid=57554 ekathimerini.com | National Archaeological Museum]  In May 2008, the Culture Minister, Mihalis Liapis, inaugurated the much anticipated collection of Egyptian antiquities and the collection of Eleni and Antonis Stathatos.\nIn 2020, there was renewed discussion regarding the need to further expand the museum to adjacent areas. A new plan was made for a subterranean expansion at the front of the museum.\nIn 2023, the Greek government approved plans for a 20,000 square metre underground extension to the museum. The extension is expected to be completed by 2028 and will also feature a rooftop garden.\nCollections\nThe museum's collections are organised in sections:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"3\" | Collections\n|-\n!

Some objects from Heinrich Schliemann excavations in Troy are also on display.\nKey highlights of the collections include:\nFile:Gold treasure from Poliochni NAMA.jpg|Gold treasure from Polichni\nFile:Clay vase with polychrome decoration, Dimini, Magnesia, Late or Final Neolithic (5300-3300 BC).jpg|Clay vase with polychrome decoration\nFile:Larger terracotta Thinker Neolithic 5894 080709.jpg|Larger terracotta figurine \"The Thinker\", Neolithic Period, 4500-3300 BC, Karditsa, Thessaly\nCycladic art collection\nThe Cycladic collection features the famous marble figurines from the Aegean Islands of Delos and Keros, including the Lutist. These mysterious human representations, which resemble modern art and inspired many artists, such as Henry Moore, came from the 3rd millennium BC old cemeteries of Aegean islands along with bronze tools and containers.\nFile:Art des Cyclades (musée national d'archéologie, Athènes) (30146370354).jpg|Harpist figurine from Keros\nFile:Cycladic frying pan, boat, fish, 2800-2300 BC, NAMA, 4974, 191437.jpg|Cycladic frying pan from Syros\nFile:Flying fish from Phylakopi, Wall painting, 16th or 17th century BC, NAMA 5844, 190952.jpg|Flying-fish wall painting fragment from Phylakopi Melos\nMycenean art collection\nMycenean civilization is represented by stone, bronze and ceramic pots, figurines, ivory, glass and faience objects, golden seals and rings from the vaulted tombs in Mycenae and other locations in the Peloponnese (Tiryns and Dendra in Argolis, Pylos in Messinia and Vaphio in Lakonia). Of great interest are the two golden cups from Vafeio showing a scene of the capture of a bull.\nHeinrich Schliemann finds\nMycenean collection includes also the magnificent 19th-century finds of Heinrich Schliemann in Mycenae from the Grave Circle A and the earlier Grave Circle B. Most notable are the golden funerary masks which covered the faces of deceased Mycenean nobles. Among them, the most famous is the one that was named erroneously as the mask of Agamemnon. There are also finds from the citadel of Mycenae including relief stelae, golden containers, glass, alabaster and amber tools and jewels. Other features include an ivory carving of two goddesses with a child, a painted limestone head of a goddess and the famous warrior's vase dating from the 12th century.\nEgyptian art collection\nThe Egyptian collection dates back to the last twenty years of the 19th century. Notable is the donation of the Egyptian government which in 1893 offered nine mummies of the era of the Pharaohs from Bab el-Gasus. However, the Egyptian collection is mainly by two donors, Ioannis Dimitriou (in 1880) and of Alexandros Rostovic (in 1904). In total, the collection includes more than 6000 artefacts, 1100 of which are available presently for the public. The collection is considered to be one of the best collections of Egyptian art in the world.\nThe exhibition features rare statues, tools, jewels, mummies, a wooden body tag for a mummy, a bronze statue of a princess, intact bird eggs and a 3000-year-old loaf of bread with a bite-sized chunk missing. The exhibition centrepiece is a bronze statue of the princess-priestess Takushit, dating to around 670 BC. Standing 70 cm high and wearing a gown covered in hieroglyphs, the statue was found south of Alexandria in 1880.\nStathatos collection\nThe Stathatos collection is named for the donors and major Greek benefactors Antonis and Eleni Stathatos. The collection features about 1000 objects, mainly jewels as well as metal objects, vases, and pottery from the Middle Bronze Age to post-Byzantine era. Features of special note are the Hellenistic period golden jewels from Karpenissi and Thessaly.\nArtists and artifacts\nSome of the ancient artists whose work is presented in the museum are Myron, Scopas, Euthymides, Lydos, Agoracritus, Agasias, Pan Painter, Wedding Painter, Meleager Painter, Cimon of Cleonae, Nessos Painter, Damophon, Aison, Analatos Painter, Polygnotos, and Hermonax.\nCollections include sculpture work, Loutrophoros, amphora, Hydria, Skyphos, Krater, Pelike, and lekythos vessels, stele, frescoes, jewellery, weapons, tools, coins, toys and other ancient items.\nArtifacts derive from archaeological excavations in Santorini, Mycenae, Tiryns, Dodona, Vaphio, Rhamnous, Lycosura, Aegean islands, Delos, the Temple of Aphaea in Aegina, the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia in Sparta, Pylos, Thebes, Athens, Vari Cave, the Antikythera wreck and from various other places in Greece.\nThe museum houses the archaic terracota statuette daidala that inspired the designers of the 2004 Athens Olympics mascots, Athena and Phevos.\nNew exhibits\nTwo of the newest exhibits of the museum include a 4th-century BC golden funerary wreath and a 6th-century BC marble statue of a woman, which were returned as stolen artifacts to Greece in 2007 by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, after a 10-year-long legal dispute between the Getty Center and the Greek Government.\nOne year earlier, the foundation agreed to return a 4th-century BC tombstone from near Greek Thebes and a 6th-century BC votive relief from the island of Thassos.\nMuseum highlights\n* Antikythera Ephebe\n* Antikythera mechanism\n* Aphrodite of Syracuse\n* Apollo Omphalos\n* Armed Aphrodite\n* Artemision Bronze\n* Atalante Hermes\n* Bronze statuettes of athletic Spartan girls\n* Bust of Antinous\n* Capitoline Venus\n* Daidala\n* Diadumenos\n* Dipylon inscription\n* Funerary naiskos of Aristonautes\n* Funerary Stela of Demokleides\n* Great Eleusinian Relief\n* Group of Aphrodite, Pan and Eros\n* Heracles of Antikythera\n* Hermes Criophorus\n* Hermes of Aegium\n* Jockey of Artemision\n* Kouroi and Korai:\n** Kroisos Kouros\n** Merenda Kouros\n** Phrasikleia Kore\n** Sounion Kouros\n* Lemnos stela\n* Lenormant Athena\n* Lycosoura Artemis\n* Lycosoura Demeter\n* Mantineia Base\n* Marathon Boy\n* Mask of Agamemnon\n* Mycenean Warrior Vase\n* Nestor's Cup\n* Nike of Epidaurus\n* Nike of Megara\n* Ninnion Tablet\n* Pitsa panels\n* Poseidon of Melos\n* Rhyton in the shape of a bull head\n* Theseus Ring\n* Varvakeion Athena\n* Wall frescoes from Tiryns and Santorini\nLibrary of archaeology\nThe museum houses a 118-year-old library of archeology with rare ancient art, science and philosophy books and publications. The library has some 20,000 volumes, including rare editions dating to the 17th century. The bibliography covers archaeology, history, arts, ancient Greek religion and ancient Greek philosophy, as well as Ancient Greek and Latin literature. Of particular value are the diaries of various excavations including those of Heinrich Schliemann. The collection of archaeology books is the richest of its kind in Greece. The Library has been recently renovated with funds from the Alexander S. Onassis Foundation. Its renovation was completed on 26 May 2008 and is now named after Alexander Onassis.\nMuseum activities\n*Conservation laboratories\n*Photographic archive and chemistry laboratories\n*Organises temporary exhibitions in the museum and abroad\n*Hosts a large number of archaeology related lectures in its lecture-hall annually\nAccess\nThe museum is accessible by the Athens Metro.
