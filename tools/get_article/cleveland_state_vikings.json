The university is a member of the Horizon League (1994–present), the Mid-American Conference (2019–present) for wrestling, and the Northeast Conference (2024–present) for men's lacrosse. Cleveland State was formerly in the Mid-Continent Conference (1982–1994) and North Star Conference (1989–1992). Cleveland State previously fielded baseball, men's cross country as well as men and women's track and field. As Fenn College they fielded men's ice hockey and rifle.

This marks a major advancement for the university's esports program, which previously operated off-campus at the Cavs Legion Lair. The creation of the dedicated lab was a collaborative effort, with significant contributions from Dr. Susan Carver and Dr. Richard Schoephoerster. Their support, along with efforts from the FAST and IS&T staff, ensured the lab was ready for use by student-athletes in August. PJ Farrell, Director of Esports, expressed enthusiasm for the new space, emphasizing its role in strengthening the program and creating opportunities for growth. The lab also supports CSU's involvement in major esports events, such as high school playoffs and collegiate tournaments. Cleveland State's esports teams compete in the GLEC and NACE Premier Conferences across  titles including Rocket League, League of Legends, Valorant, and Overwatch.\nMen's fencing\nRecord by year\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
