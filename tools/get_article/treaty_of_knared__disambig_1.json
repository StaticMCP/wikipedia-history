The peace negotiations came about under an English initiative. The peace was guaranteed by King James I of England and VI of Scotland.\nThe treaty was named after the village of Knäred in Halland, where it was signed at a border bridge in what was then the Danish Halland. The peace meant that the kingdoms restored the conquests made during the war. Under the terms of the treaty, Sweden would give back Jemtland and Herjedalen to Norway.\nDenmark-Norway would give back Borgholm, Kalmar and Öland.\nAs a result, Sweden also had to pay the Älvsborg Ransom of one million Rixdollars for the return of the fortress of Älvsborg. The ransom was paid by 1619.\nA memorial stone over the site was erected between Knäred and Markaryd in 1925 by the Halland Art Museum (Hallands konstmuseum).\nSee also\n* Dominium maris baltici\n* List of Danish wars\n* List of Swedish wars\n* List of treaties\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.hallandskonstmuseum.se/ Hallands Konstmuseum website]"
