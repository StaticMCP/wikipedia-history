He was selected by Washington in the fourth round of the 1979 NFL draft and retired from playing following the 1992 season. After initially spending time working at Centreville High School as an assistant football and baseball coach, he later returned to the Redskins as a pro scout under former head coach Joe Gibbs. He later served as a pro scout for the Carolina Panthers from 2010 to 2019 before following head coach Ron Rivera back to Washington, spending the 2020–2021 seasons as a senior pro scout for the Washington Commanders before retiring from scouting.\nHigh school and college career\nWarren was born in Bellingham, Washington and raised in California.

Known as an excellent blocker, Warren was an original member of \"The Hogs\", a nickname given to the Redskins offensive line in the 1980s.\nAfter retiring following the 1992 season, Warren spent several years as baseball and football coach for Centreville High School in Virginia.
