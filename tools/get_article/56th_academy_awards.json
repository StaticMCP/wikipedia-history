Allen explained the decision to hire Carson, saying, \"In past years, Johnny has been a vital element in the ever-increasing success and popularity of the Oscar presentations. We are extremely pleased that we will be able to draw once again on his wit and charisma to host this special entertainment event.\"\nSeveral other people were involved with the production of the ceremony. Musician Quincy Jones served as musical director for the ceremony, where he conducted an overture performed by the orchestra at the beginning of the show. Former child actress Shirley Temple made a special appearance at the beginning of the telecast to discuss her memories of the 7th ceremony in 1935, where she received the Academy Juvenile Award. Singers Sammy Davis Jr. and Liza Minnelli performed \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" at the conclusion of the telecast. Marty Pasetta served as director for the telecast. Notably, this was the first Oscars ceremony where the voting rules were announced at the end of the telecast as opposed to the beginning.\nBox office performance of Best Picture nominees\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 16, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $151 million. Terms of Endearment was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees, with $72.9&nbsp;million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by The Big Chill ($52.5&nbsp;million), The Right Stuff ($15.7&nbsp;million), Tender Mercies ($8.44&nbsp;million), and The Dresser ($562,623).\nCritical reviews\nColumnist Jerry Coffey from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram wrote, \"Nothing that goes on during an Oscarcast is worth the tedium dumbly endured by the ever-gullible audience for moviedom's annual spasm of gross self-indulgence.\" Austin American-Statesman film critic Patrick Taggart commented, \"By now after a week after the fact, it is a matter of record that Monday's Academy Awards show was without the dullest ever.\" He added, \"The Oscar went to the predictable choice in every case, and not only were there no surprises among the awards, there weren't even any of those deliciously embarrassing moments that make live television what it is.\" Television critic Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times noted, \"Be honest. This was not one of your more electrifying Academy Awards telecasts. The three hours and 40 minutes passed as swiftly as Barry Lyndon.\" He also said, \"And the tradition of squeezing nearly all of the major, most glamorous awards into the last half hour again proved mistaken, ill conceived, and just plain dumb.\"\nOther media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Television columnist John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote, \"The tone of the proceedings was set and maintained by a spiritedly genial Mr. Carson.\" He also added that Carson was able to \"provide with eternally boyish grace his typical comedy mix.\" The Baltimore Sun film critic Stephen Hunter quipped, \"The show, one of the crispest and most swiftly-paced in recent years, enjoyed its greatest asset in the return of Johnny Carson to the role of master of ceremonies. Mr. Carson was in top form.\" Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press wrote, \"Johnny Carson, once again the invaluable host, added some much needed spice with well-timed zingers. And I especially enjoyed Jack Nicholson's impersonation of a Blues Brother behind those black be-bopper shades.\"\nRatings and reception\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 42.1&nbsp;million people over the length of the entire ceremony, which was a 21% decrease from the previous year's ceremony. Moreover, the show drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony, with 30.3% of households watching with a 50% share. Nevertheless, the ceremony presentation received four nominations at the 36th Primetime Emmy Awards in August 1984. The following month, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety Program (Roy Christopher).\nSee also\n* List of submissions to the 56th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n;Official websites\n* [http://www.oscar.com/ Academy Awards official website]\n* [http://www.oscars.org/ The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences official website]\n;Analysis\n* [http://www.filmsite.org/aa83.html 1983 Academy Awards Winners and History]  at Filmsite\n* [https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000003/1984 Academy Awards, USA: 1984]  at IMDb\n;Other resources\n*"
