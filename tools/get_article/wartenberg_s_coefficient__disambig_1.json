This coefficient is a multivariate extension of spatial autocorrelation that aims to account for spatial dependence of data while studying their covariance. A modified version of this statistic is available in the R package adespatial''.\nFor data x_i measured at N spatial sites Moran's I is a measure of the spatial  autocorrelation of the data. By standardizing the observations z_i = (x_i - \\bar{x})/s by subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance as well as normalising the spatial weight matrix such that \\sum_{ij} w_{ij} = 1 we can write Moran's I as\n:I = \\sum_{ij} w_{ij} z_i z_j\nWartenberg generalized this by letting z_i be a vector of M observations at i and defining where:\n:I = Z^T W Z\n* W is the N \\times N spatial weight matrix\n* Z is the N \\times M standardized data matrix\n* Z^T is the transpose of Z\n* I is the M \\times M spatial correlation matrix.\nFor two variables x and y the bivariate correlation is\n:I_{xy} = \\frac{ \\sum_{ij} w_{ij} (x_i - \\bar{x}) (y_j - \\bar{y})}{ \\sqrt{ \\sum_i (x_i -\\bar{x})^2} \\sqrt{ \\sum_i (y_i -\\bar{y})^2}  }\nFor M=1 this reduces to Moran's I. For larger values of M the diagonals of I are the Moran indices for each of the variables and the off-diagonals give the corresponding Wartenberg correlation coefficients. I is an example of a Mantel statistic and so its significance can be evaluated using the Mantel test.\nCriticisms\nLee points out some problems with this coefficient namely:\n* There is only one factor of W in the numerator, so the comparison is between the raw x data and the spatially averaged y data.\n* I_{xy} \\neq I_{yx} for non-symmetric spatial weight matrices.\nHe suggests an alternative coefficient which has two factors of W in the numerator and is symmetric for any weight matrix.\nSee also\n* Tjøstheim's Coefficient\nReferences"
