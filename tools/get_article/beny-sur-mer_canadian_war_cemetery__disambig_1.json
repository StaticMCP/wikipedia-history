It is located in, and named after, Bény-sur-Mer, in the Calvados department, near Caen, in lower Normandy. As is typical of war cemeteries in France, the grounds are landscaped and kept. Contained within the cemetery is a cross of sacrifice, a monument typical of memorials designed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\nCanadian soldiers killed later, in the Battle of Normandy, are buried south-east of Caen, in the Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, located in Cintheaux.\nHistory\nBény-sur-Mer was created as a permanent resting place for Canadian soldiers who had been temporarily interred in smaller plots close to where they fell. As is usual for war cemeteries or monuments, France granted Canada a perpetual concession to the land occupied by the cemetery.\nThe graves contain soldiers from the 3rd Canadian Division and 15 airmen killed during the Battle of Normandy, as well as three British graves and one French grave, for a total of 2,048 markers. The French grave belongs to a French resistance soldier named R. Guenard, who fought and died alongside the Canadians and who had no known relatives. His marker is inscribed \"Mort pour la France – 19-7-1944\".\nBecause of confusion during the movement of remains from temporary cemeteries, the remains of one Canadian soldier were misplaced; his tombstone is set apart from the others and bears an inscription stating that it is known that his remains are in the Bény-sur-Mer cemetery. Bény-sur-Mer contains the remains of nine sets of brothers.\nA large number of dead in the cemetery were killed in early July 1944, in the Battle for Caen. The cemetery also contains soldiers who fell during the initial D-Day assault of Juno Beach. Some of the Canadian prisoners of war illegally executed at Ardenne Abbey are interred here. It also contains the grave of the Reverend (Honorary Captain) Walter Leslie Brown, chaplain to the 27th Armoured Regiment (Sherbrooke Fusiliers) and the only chaplain killed in cold blood during the Second World War. Brown was murdered on the night of June 6 to 7, by members of III/25th S.S. Panzer Grenedier Regiment, Galmanche; but, his body was not found until July, 1944. Canadians killed later in the campaign were interred in the Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery.\nThe site was featured in the seventh leg of The Amazing Race Canadas second season, wherein contestants arrived at the cemetery and paid their respects before retrieving their clue along with a \"LEST WE FORGET\" card.\nLocation\nThe cemetery is about one kilometre east of the village of Reviers, in the Calvados department, on the Creully-Tailleville-Ouistreham road. It is located 15 kilometres northwest of Caen, 18 kilometres east of Bayeux, and three and a half kilometres south of Courseulles-sur-Mer. The village of Bény-sur-Mer is some two kilometres south-east of the cemetery. The cemetery can be accessed any time.\nAdditional images\nCimetière canadien Bény-sur-Mer 2018-oct - 1.jpg|Graves aligned.\nCimetière canadien Bény-sur-Mer 2018-oct - 4.jpg|Graves aligned.\nCimetière canadien Bény-sur-Mer 2018-oct - 2.jpg|Graves aligned.\nCimetière canadien Bény-sur-Mer 2018-oct - 5.jpg|Detail on a grave.\nRguenard.jpg|Grave of Mr. R.
