One piece is a dome-shaped hard cap or kulla, generally embroidered with golden thread.  The other is called lungi which consists of a long and narrow piece of cotton cloth (not to be confused with a waist cloth wrapped in some regions). It has a fan-shaped turra (crest) and a tail termed shamla.\nSubhas Chandra Bose had used a Peshawari turban to disguise himself as a Pashtun in 1941 to flee from the British territory.\nDuring the British rule a similar turban was part of the dress for some government peons.\nGandhara turban gallery from major museums (1st-3rd century CE)\nFile:Gandhara,grande_partenza_di_buddha,_100-300.JPG| The Great Departure of Buddha, Victoria and Albert Museum click on image for detail\nFile:Gandhara,_testa_di_bodhisattva_da_hadda,_IV-V_secolo_dc..JPG| Hadda\nFile:Gandhara,_testa_di_bodhisattva,_periodo_kushan,_150-300.JPG|  Victoria and Albert Museum\nFile:Stucco_Gandhara_figure_02.jpg| Victoria and Albert Museum\nFile:Arte_del_gandhara,_bodhisattva_pensoso,_III_sec.JPG|  Los Angeles County Museum of Art\nFile:Bodhisattva_Maitreya,_Gandhara,_2nd-3rd_century_AD,_schist_with_pigment_and_gold_-_Arthur_M._Sackler_Gallery_-_DSC06052.JPG| Bodhisattva Maitreya,  Arthur M.
