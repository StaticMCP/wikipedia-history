A Grade II listed structure, it stands in a small garden in the southwestern corner of a junction known as Four Lane Ends.\nDesigned by Albert Toft and sculpted by W. L. Cookson, the memorial consists of a bronze statue depicting a soldier standing with a rifle.  The statue is on a square granite shaft, on a tapered plinth, on a base of two steps.  On the shaft is an inscription and the names of those lost in the First World War.  In front and at the sides of the memorial are three granite tablets in the form of open books with the names of those lost in the Second World War.  Colonel Hugh Jeudwine was present at the memorial's unveiling on 11 November 1923.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/570 Memorial, Thornton Cleveleys] – Imperial War Museums\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121011232112/http://www.btinternet.com/~stephen.yarwood/thornton_2.htm A photo of the memorial shortly after its completion in 1923]"
