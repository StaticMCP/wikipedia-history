The bridge was opened in 1889, and consists of five wrought iron plate girder spans. It is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The bridge was constructed by contractor David Munro and replaced a timber bridge built in 1860.\nThe bridge is a very flat arch, and has five spans constructed of wrought iron plate girders. The bridge rests on iron cylinders in groups of eight, filled with concrete, with arched bracing between. It connects Market Street and William Street on the north bank to Queensbridge Street to the south. Trams on route 58 also cross the bridge.\nIn 1910, Houdini leapt from the bridge while shackled, and escaped in less than a minute.\nYarra Falls\nQueens Bridge is situated at the location of the Yarra Falls, a waterfall that had existed on the Yarra River. The Aboriginal clans of Woiwurrung and Boon wurrung called the falls \"Yarro Yarro,\" which means \"it flows\" or \"ever-flowing\" and used it as a crossing point between their lands.\nIn June 1835, John Batman arrived at Yarra Falls and recognised the surrounding land as a good site to build a village. The site became the landing spot for ships in Melbourne, because the falls had prevented ships from travelling further upstream, which influenced the overall design of Melbourne.\nIn 1839, a dam was built on the falls, using convict labour, in order to secure the fresh water supply for the growing city. However, it did not last long, nor did its replacement. In 1845, a bridge was built at the site by a private company, but that was replaced by a government-funded Prince's Bridge in 1850, which stood until the removal of the Falls.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
