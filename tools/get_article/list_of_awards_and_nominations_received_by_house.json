The show centers around Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), a drug-addicted, unconventional, misanthropic medical genius who leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional hospital in New Jersey. Throughout its run, the show has been widely popular with audiences,  and has been well received by the critics community.\nAs a result, by the end of its run, the show had been nominated 169 times for awards presented by American organizations, including at least ten times each for the Primetime Emmy Awards, Teen Choice Awards, People's Choice Awards, NAACP Image Awards, and Prism Awards. It won the awards a total of 56 times, which included multiple wins also at the Golden Globe Awards, Young Artist Awards, BMI Film & TV Awards, Satellite Awards, Golden Reel Awards, TCA Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards, Humanitas Prizes, and WGA Awards.\nThe show has been very successful internationally also, being aired in 2008 in a total of 66 countries, and with audience of over 81.8 million worldwide, it was the most watched television show on the globe that year. As a result, it received ten nominations for international awards, including once for a BAFTA TV Award (U.K.) and for a Golden Nymph (won, Monaco).\nHugh Laurie, who portrays the title character, has been nominated for an award 38 times, winning 14 of them. Omar Epps has been nominated eight times, winning three awards, while Olivia Wilde has been nominated five times for an award. Besides the show's cast members, the writers and producers of the show have also been nominated for various awards; writer, show-runner, executive producer and director David Shore, has received ten nominations for his work on the show, winning three times.\nEmmy Awards\nThe Emmy Awards have been awarded annually since 1949 by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to honor excellence in television.[http://www.emmys.tv/awards Awards | Television Academy] They are considered to be one of the four major awards in America for the performing arts — together with the Academy Awards (film), Tony Awards (theatre) and Grammy Awards (music).  House has been nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards, which are given to honor excellence in acting and writing in primetime television, as well as Creative Arts Emmys, which are presented in recognition of technical and other related areas in American television programming.\nAfter its first season run in 2005, House received five Emmy Award nominations, of which three were for Creative Arts Emmys. It failed to gain a nomination for Outstanding Drama Series but did, however, win the award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series.  The show did get nominated for Outstanding Drama Series in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, but did not manage to win the award in either of these four nominations. In 2006 House was nominated for four Emmys, but failed to win. Next year, the show received four nominations, and won a Creative Arts Emmy for make-up. The following year, at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards, the show, again, received four nominations but only received one Primetime Emmy Award, for director Greg Yaitanes for Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series. House received another three nominations in 2009 and in 2010, and two more nominations in 2011. However, it only won two Creative Arts Emmy Awards for sound mixing in 2009 and 2011, and failed to win any nominations altogether in 2012 for its final season.\nHugh Laurie, who portrays the title character has been nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for every season except the second and the last one. Despite the six nominations, Laurie has never won the award, which has been regarded by some critics in the entertainment industry as among the biggest snubs in the award's history.\nPrimetime Emmy Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\"| Category\n!scope=\"col\"| Nominee(s)\n!scope=\"col\"| Episode\n!scope=\"col\"| Result\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2005\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\n| Hugh Laurie\n|\"Detox\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series\n| David Shore\n| \"Three Stories\"\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n! scope=\"row\"|Outstanding Drama Series\n|\n|N/A\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2007\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Drama Series\n|\n| \"Half-Wit\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\n| Hugh Laurie\n| }}\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series\n| David Morse\n| }}\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2008\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Drama Series\n|\n| \"Frozen\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\n| Hugh Laurie\n| \"House's Head\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series\n| Greg Yaitanes\n| \"House's Head\"\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2009\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Drama Series\n|\n|N/A\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\n| Hugh Laurie\n|\"Under My Skin\"\n|\n|-\n|2010\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\n| Hugh Laurie\n| \"Broken\"\n|\n|-\n|2011\n! scope=\"row\"| Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\n| Hugh Laurie\n| \"After Hours\"\n|\n|}\n: Katie Jacobs, David Shore, Bryan Singer, Thomas L.
