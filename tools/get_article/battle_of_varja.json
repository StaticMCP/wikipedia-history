The Russians were caught completely off guard and subsequently took cover within the houses to avoid the Swedish onslaught, these were however, soon put on fire by the Swedes, an action resulting in 1,500 Russians killed, wounded or captured to about 200 Swedes with only 500 Russians who managed to escape. Later during the day, as the Swedes were looting the Russian supplies, a larger force of 3,000 men under Sheremetev himself, arrived and in turn surprised the Swedes who were driven off with a loss of 80 menand among them, the Swedish commander Georg Reinhold Patkul  was captured during the retreat. Other sources claim the Russian's suffered 40 killed and 70 wounded.\nAftermath\nThe Russians here received important information about the approach of the Swedish main army under Charles, who arrived at the two villages about two weeks later. Sheremetev later faced the Swedish vanguard at Pühhajoggi; however after initial skirmishes he was soon driven off, leading to the Battle of Narva, where the Russian main army saw itself decisively defeated by the Swedish army.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*"
