The plant opened in 1897 and closed in 1968. The plant included several buildings, including a remarkable red brick administrative building, and a large, tall wall which surrounded the facility. It was located on the South Omaha Terminal Railway, and next to the Omaha Stockyards, making Armour one of the \"Big Four\" packing companies in Omaha.\nHistory\n]]\nThe Union Stock Yards Company gave Armour $600,000 in land and approximately $750,000 in stock in the Omaha Stockyards to build a packing house. This deal raised the ire of stockholders in the stockyards company, as well as competitors in the meat-packing industry.\nThe contractors selected to build the plant were Rocheford & Gould, and the first brick was laid on 17 November 1897.\nThere were a number of large riots and civil unrest that originated or included events at the Armour Packing Plant.\nSee also\n* History of Omaha, Nebraska\n* Economy of Omaha, Nebraska\nExternal links\n* [http://www.nebraskamemories.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/opl&CISOPTR=2995&CISOBOX=1&REC=19 Historic image]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720093439/http://contentdm.unl.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2Fnebraskastu&CISOPTR=20724&CISOBOX=1&REC=13 Strikers in a picket hut at the Armour plant]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720093558/http://contentdm.unl.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2Fnebraskastu&CISOPTR=20868&CISOBOX=1&REC=15 Historic image]\nReferences"
