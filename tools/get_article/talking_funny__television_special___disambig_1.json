They also compliment each other on specific bits they do. Seinfeld praised C.K.'s describing him as a comedian who \"tap danced over six laser beams\". C.K. described Seinfeld as a \"singular comedian\". He also reminisced about when he was a young comic opening for Seinfeld.

Ben Wicks of BBC wrote, \"Imagine Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, Don Rickles, and George Carlin all gathered in a room, circa 1979, musing wittily on the secrets of their success. This is the closest approximation to such a summit we’re gonna get\".\nCritic Kevin Jagernauth from IndieWire gave a mixed review stating, \"Neither as deep or delightful as it wants to be, “Talking Funny” shows us four guys having a great time hanging out with each other and makes us wish we were having as much fun watching it as they did making it.\"\nAnnie Barrett from Entertainment Weekly praised the show for its \"intellectual discussion\", and that she wished \"this were a weekly series instead of a one-time special. Even a podcast would work.\" She elaborated saying, \"My favorite thing about the special was that these four guys have very different approaches to comedy.\"\nVariety critic Brian Lowry, criticized the special for its loose nature, saying \"[Talking Funny] isn't perceptive enough to stick in your head\", however he praised the chemistry between the four comedians, saying \"the special is interesting enough that again watching these four guys (or perhaps another assorted quartet) sit around bullshitting isn't an unattractive thought.\"\nReferences"
