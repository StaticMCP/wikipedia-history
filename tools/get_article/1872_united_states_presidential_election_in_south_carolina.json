All contemporary 37 states were part of the 1872 United States presidential election. The state voters chose 7 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nSouth Carolina was won by the Republican nominees, incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant of Illinois and his running mate Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts. Grant and Wilson defeated the Liberal Republican and Democratic nominees, former Congressman Horace Greeley of New York and his running mate former Senator and Governor Benjamin Gratz Brown of Missouri by a margin of 51.95%.\nWith 75.73% of the popular vote, South Carolina would be Grant's second strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote after Vermont. This election would also prove to be the high water mark for any Republican presidential candidate in the state as of 2025.\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
