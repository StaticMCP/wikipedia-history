The Clash covered \"Revolution Rock\" for their 1979 album London Calling.\nCritics have described the Clash’s arrangement as reggae-driven with prominent staccato horn refrains and a \"call-and-response\" effect fashioned by Joe Strummer’s vocal phrasing alongside the track’s instrumentation. It was originally going to close London Calling, but \"Train in Vain\" was added at the last minute. There was another reggae song of the same title released in 1973 by roots reggae mic chanter and toaster, Big Youth and ska singer, Prince Buster. According to Ray, \"The lyrics come from going to the clubs and seeing what was going on, you know?\"\nThe song features a staccato horn refrain and \"sinuous\" guitar stylings. According to Sean Egan, \"Strummer uses his voice almost as an instrument in the way he cleverly manufactures the illusion of call and response with already recorded instruments.\" An instrumental version of the song was featured on the Rude Boy film. \"Revolution Rock\" was a staple in live shows from the end of 1979 to 1981. According to Billboard, \"With the help of sidemen the Irish Horns, the Clash get downright giddy.\"\nThe horn section on London Calling—credited as the Irish Horns—comprised trombonist Chris Gower, trumpeter Dick Hanson, and saxophonists John Earle and Ray Beavis.\nThe last verse (El Clash combo / Paid fifteen dollars a day / Weddings, parties, anything / And Bongo Jazz a speciality) inspired the naming of the Australian group Weddings Parties Anything.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
