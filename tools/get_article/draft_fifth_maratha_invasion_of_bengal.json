Alivardi led expedition against the Afghan rebels in Bihar. Taking the opportunity a body of Maratha troops under Janoji left Midnapore and invaded Burdwan.\nTo press Alivardi Khan, the Marathas allied with Afghan rebels, temporarily halted plundering in western Bengal, and redirected their forces toward Bihar to chase the Bengal army. Mir Habib led the advance troops of 5,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry through the Santal Paraganas and entered Bihar. Janoji and Mir Habib joined the Afghans in Patna. Alivardi Khan defeated the allied Maratha and Afghan army at the Battle of Rani Sarai on 16 April 1748. After staying at Patna for six months, on 6 November he began his return to Murshidabad and reached on 30 November 1748.\nSiege of Odisha\nIn March 1749, Alivardi Khan began his campaign to reconquer Odisha from Marathas. Mir Habib who was stationed at Midnapore was reinforced by Raghuji's younger son Sabaji Bhonsle. Mir Habib sent detachments to plunder different parts of Odisha. Few months prior Alivardi Khan dispatched Haider Ali Khan with 8,000 soldiers detachment to Burdwan to block the Marathas. Alivardi reached Midnapore and ordered Haider Ali Khan to join him. The troops mutinied, refusing to march until their pay arrears were cleared. Negotiations failed, and an enraged Alivardi disbanded the entire unit. He pressed on to Midnapore with a much weaker force of only 5,000–6,000 cavalry and no artillery. Mir Habib upon hearing Alivardi's march fled to the South. Alivardi crossed Midnapore where the Bengal army under Dost Muhammad Khan, Mir Kazim Khan and others defeated the Marathas. Alivardi Khan pursued the Marathas to Balasore. Janoji and Mir Habib escaped to the jungle of Cuttack. Marching from Bara, Alivardi  led an army of 2,000 soldiers which was reduced to 300 and arrived to Cuttack on 17 May 1749. On 18 May, Sayyid Nur, Dharmadas Hazari and Sarandaz Khan who were incharge of the fort visited the Nawab in his camp. Sayyid Nur and Dharmadas Hazari were imprisoned while Sarandaz Khan who resisted was slain. The garrison defended the fort for 15 days before surrendering it to Alivardi. Thus Alivardi successfully recovered Odisha from Marathas. Alivardi appointed Shah Abdus Subhan Khan as the deputy governor of Odisha. Within a week of Alivardi's departure from Odisha, 7,000–8,000 Marathas hiding in the neighbouring Jungle attacked and wounded Abdus Subhan Khan despite his valiant resistance. Abdus Subhan Khan was imprisoned. Alivardi's fatigued army was in terrible condition to recover Odisha. Due to severe illness Alivardi returned to Murshidabad in early July 1749.\nLater conflicts\nTreaty\nSee aso\n* First Maratha invasion of Bengal\n* Second Maratha invasion of Bengal\n* Third Maratha invasion of Bengal\n* Afghan insurrections in Bengal Subah\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n:Category:Wars involving the Bengal Subah\n:Category:Wars involving the Maratha Empire\n:Category:1740s in India\n:Category:1750s in India\n:Category:1740s conflicts\n:Category:1750s conflicts"
