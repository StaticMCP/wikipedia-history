In addition to the cash prizes, two winners get published by a university press.\nThe Crab Orchard Review, a biannual journal of creative works published by the Department of English of Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, and Southern Illinois University Press organize the competition, which gives out $3,500 to two winners. Winners must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States.\nPrior to 2009, the Crab Orchard Series in Poetry Open Competition Awards awarded a first place and a second place. These winners received different prize amounts, but all winning manuscripts were published by Southern Illinois University Press.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 98%;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|Year  ||Co-Winner            || Co-Winner || Judge\n|-\n| 2013 || Dan Albergotti Millennial Teeth || TJ Jarrett ZION || Rodney Jones\n|-\n| 2012 || Jeffrey Skinner Glaciology || Jason Sommer The Laughter of Adam and Eve || Cynthia Huntington\n|-\n| 2011 || Jacob Shores-Arguello In the Absence of Clocks || Wally Swist Huang Po and the Dimensions of Love || Yusef Komunyakaa\n|-\n| 2010 || Brian Barker The Black Ocean || Camille Dungy Smith Blue || Michael Waters\n|-\n|2009 ||Todd Hearon Strange Land || Jennifer Richter Threshold || Natasha Trethewey\n|-\n|-\n|Year  ||First Place            || Second Place || Judge\n|-\n|2008 ||Alison Townsend Persephone in America || Jesse Lee Kercheval Cinema Muto ||David Wojahn\n|-\n|2007 ||Ciaran Berry The Sphere of Birds || Jake Adam York A Murmuration of Starlings || Cathy Song\n|-\n|2006 ||Moira Linehan If No Moon || Honorée Fanonne Jeffers Red Clay Suite||Dorianne Laux\n|-\n|2005 || David Hernandez Always Danger ||Susan B.A. Somers-Willett Roam||Leslie Adrienne Miller\n|-\n|2004 ||Victoria Chang Circle || Greg Pape American Flamingo||Richard Cecil\n|-\n|2003 ||Jon Pineda Birthmark || Lee Ann Roripaugh Year of the Snake||Ralph Burns\n|-\n|2002 ||Elton Glaser Pelican Tracks || Patricia Jabbeh Wesley Becoming Ebony||Tim Seibles\n|-\n|2001 ||Joy Katz Fabulae||Susan Aizenberg Muse||Maura Stanton\n|-\n|2000 ||J.
