He had held the seat for less than two years, having been elected at the 1906 general election after the retirement from the Commons of his father Charles Henry Wilson, who had held the seat since 1885.\nCandidates\nThree candidates contested the seat.\nThe Liberal candidate Guy Wilson was a former officer in the British Army, and a director of the family shipping company Thomas Wilson Sons & Co.\nThe Conservative Party candidate was Sir George Trout Bartley, a cockney who had been the founder of the National Penny bank and was MP for Islington North from 1885 until his defeat in 1906.\nThe Labour Party nominated a candidate for the first time: James Holmes, who had been an unsuccessful candidate in Birmingham East at the 1906 general election.\nResult\nAftermath\nBartley did not stand for Parliament again. Wilson held the seat (with much increased majorities) until the constituency was abolished in 1918. He then rejected the coalition coupon which he had been given, and was heavily defeated at the 1918 general election.\nThe Labour Party did not contest Kingston upon Hull West again in either of the 1910 elections. Holmes stood again only one more time, at the Crewe by-election in July 1912, but came a poor third.\nReferences\nSee also\n*"
