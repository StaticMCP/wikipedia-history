      "text": "# 1852 French Second Empire referendum\n\nA referendum on re-establishing the Empire was held in France on 21 and 22 November 1852. Voters were asked whether they approved of the re-establishment of the Empire in the person of Louis Napoléon Bonaparte and his family. It was approved by 97% of voters with an 80% turnout. After the plebiscite, Louis Napoléon assumed the style \"Napoleon III, Emperor of the French.\" As with all other plebiscites under Napoleon III (and Napoleon I before him), the results were blatantly rigged and only served to use the façade of democracy to legitimize their rule.\nSuffrage\nAll French men over the age of 21 were entitled to vote in a commune in which they had resided for six months. Algerians and Kanaks had no right to vote.\nResults\nThe vote was secret with the exception of those serving in the military. However, the authorities only printed yes ballots - voters had to supply their own ballots with no.\nReferences"
