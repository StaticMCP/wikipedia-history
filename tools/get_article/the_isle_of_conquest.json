The film is now considered lost.\nPlot\nBased upon a short review in a film magazine, a young woman (Talmadge) marries a wealthy scoundrel so that her mother can live in luxury. While vacationing on his yacht, she becomes shipwrecked and is cast on a desert island with a stoker (Standing) for her companion.
