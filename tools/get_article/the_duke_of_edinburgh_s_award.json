The awards recognise adolescents and young adults for completing a series of self-improvement exercises modelled on Kurt Hahn's solutions to his \"Six Declines of Modern Youth\".\nHistory\nIn February 1955, The Duke of Edinburgh's Award was first announced. It was at first \"for boys aged 15 to 18\". It was first administered, and largely designed, by John Hunt, who had led the first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, and had retired from the army to run The Duke of Edinburgh's Award.\nIt was designed to attract boys who had not been interested in joining one of the main British youth movements, such as the Scout Association. In the first 12 months, 7,000 boys had enrolled for the scheme. The programme borrowed from the Moray Badge, instituted at Gordonstoun School by its headmaster, Kurt Hahn, in 1936, and the County Badge adopted in Moray in 1941.\nIn November 1957, it was announced that girls would be invited to participate. On 19 June 1958, the programme was extended to girls, with the first girls allowed to join from 1 September 1958. The programme for girls was not the same as that for boys, and was for ages 14 to 20. The first girls received their Gold Awards on 3 November 1959 at Buckingham Palace. From January 1965, the Gold Award for boys and girls was made more similar.\nThe first Gold Awards were achieved in 1958, and the charity was established in 1959. A single programme for young people aged 14 to 21 was launched in 1969, and extended to those up to 25 years of age in 1980. In 2013, the Duke presented Awards at St James's Palace which included his 500th Gold Award Presentation.\nUnited Kingdom\nThe first Duke of Edinburgh's Award ceremony was held in the United Kingdom in 1956. Participation in DofE programmes and the number of awards achieved has grown every year since 1956. Young people take part in Duke of Edinburgh's Award programmes run in designated DofE centres – including schools, youth clubs, Air cadets, Army Cadets and businesses – throughout the country. Over 6 million people have taken part in the DofE since 1956 (8 million worldwide). The Duke of Edinburgh's Award is a member of the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS). In 2009, the old system of keeping track of progress through paper Record Books was replaced by the introduction of a major new online system – eDofE. Participants use this system to track their progress, while Leaders use it to oversee participants' progress.\nAward programmes\nThe Duke of Edinburgh's Award programmes take between one and four years to complete, and they must be completed by the participant's 25th-birthday. The programmes are at three progressive levels which, if successfully completed, lead to a Bronze, Silver, or Gold Duke of Edinburgh's Award. With assistance from adult Leaders, participants select and set objectives in each of the following areas:\n*Volunteering: undertaking service to individuals or the community.\n*Physical: improving in an area of sport, dance or fitness activities.\n*Skills: developing practical and social skills and personal interests.\n*Expedition: planning, training for, and completion of an adventurous journey nationally or abroad.\n*At Gold level, participants must do an additional fifth Residential section, which involves staying and working away from home for five days, doing a shared activity.\nTo achieve an award, the participant must work on each section for a minimum period of time, and must be monitored and assessed by someone with knowledge of the chosen activities. Each progressive level demands more time and commitment from participants: Bronze 3–6 months; Silver: 6–9 months; Gold: 12–18 months. Participants are required to show regular activity and commitment to the award for the duration of their DofE programme, which is usually at least one hour per week.\nJoint Award Initiative\nIn Northern Ireland, participants completing The Duke of Edinburgh's Award can choose to accept a certificate from the Gaisce or an International Award Certificate instead of a Duke of Edinburgh certificate.\nOther nations\nAwards modelled on The Duke of Edinburgh's Award are presented by sponsoring organisations affiliated with the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Association in 144 nations: 29 located in the Americas; 36 in Africa; 32 in Asian Pacific countries; and 47 in Europe, around the Mediterranean, and in Arab countries. The prestige, scope and awareness of these awards vary from country to country and often – unlike awards programmes in Ireland and the United Kingdom – there is no connection to the head of state and awards are simply issued by private youth charities. In the United States, for instance, only about 7,000 of the estimated 47 million eligible persons age 14 to 24 annually participate in the programme.\nAustralia\nThe Award was established in Australia in 1959 on the initiative of Sir Adrien Curlewis (son of Herbert Curlewis) in 1958. By 1962 the award was available in all state and territories and today over 30,000 young Australians commence a Bronze, Silver or Gold Award each year. The Duke of Ed in Australia is a widely recognised organising and accrediting framework of non-formal education and learning. Over 775,000 young Australians have now completed their award and approximately 45,000 are actively participating in the award programme each year, supported by a network of 60,000 volunteers acting as award leaders, supervisors and assessors.\nThe Duke of Edinburgh's International Award can be found in over 1,200 locations and institutions across Australia including cities, rural and remote areas, through Government and independent schools, universities, indigenous communities, refugee support programmes, detention centres, community organisations, disability groups and other youth programmes. The National Chairman is currently Gary Nairn, and the National CEO is Peter Kaye. The Hon Larry Anthony is the chair of The Friends of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award in Australia and Andrew Murray AM is the deputy chair.\nBangladesh\nIn Bangladesh, the award is offered through The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Foundation Bangladesh, which has been based in Dhaka since 2008.

By 2011, approximately 500,000 Canadians had received the award over the programme's 57-year history. In 2013, the Royal Bank of Canada announced a $1 million grant to help fund marketing and publicity efforts to increase awareness for the programme.\nCyprus\nParticipation in the Award has been available for many years.\nEswatini\n\"The Prince Makhosini Award\" had 3,000&nbsp;young people participating in the programme in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) as of 2013.\nGhana\nThe scheme in Ghana is named the Head of State Award.

More than 600 different user units, including schools, universities, uniform group youth organisations and community centres, are running the Award Scheme.\nIndia\nIndia awards the \"International Award for Young People\" to youth who complete a self-improvement programme based on the Duke of Edinburgh's award model. The programme was first introduced to India in 1962 and was originally operated by the Indian Public Schools Conference. In 1989 the Award Programme Foundation, a registered charity, was established to oversee management of the award. According to the Award Programme Foundation, implementation of awards are undertaken by 154 local institutions, including governments, NGOs and universities. Despite the long history of the programme in India, only about 19,000 youth annually participate. As in many other nations, awards in India are granted in three levels – Gold, Silver and Bronze – based on the complexity and time commitment of the projects undertaken by the individual award participant.\nIreland\n\"Gaisce – The President's Award\" () was established by a trust deed under the patronage of the President of Ireland on 28 March 1985. It joined the Duke of Edinburgh's International Awards Association in 1988. There are three awards: bronze, silver and gold. The profile of the award was raised substantially during the term of Mary Robinson.\nKorea\nThe award was established in Korea in 2008 by Korea Youth Services Centre.

The President's Award has a full licence to operate the Award in South Africa, from the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Foundation.

Various schools and some Scout councils participate.\nZambia\n\"The Duke of Edinburgh International Award\", \"The International Youth Award\", or simply \"The International Award\" was founded in Zambia in 1989. Although the concept was introduced in September 1981, it was only in 1989 when the Zambian government decided to integrate it into the President's Youth Award of Zambia. In 1990, a National Youth Award Committee was elected and operated under the National Youth Development Council (NYDC). In May 1991, a pilot project started with 50 young individuals and by December the same year 30 had qualified for the Bronze Award level. In the mid-1990s, the Award got a new lease of life when private schools began to adopt the Award, reporting directly to the International Secretariat in London in the absence of a National Award Authority. At this point, slight name variations arose in different private schools depending on organisers; however, the integrity of the award is still maintained.\nSee also\n* Outward Bound\n* Hong Kong Award for Young People, known formerly as Duke of Edinburgh's Award\n* The President's Challenge\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://edofe.org/ eDofE website]\n*[http://www.dukeofed.org.au Information on the International Award Programme in Australia]\n*[http://www.dukeofed.org Information on the International Award Programme in Canada]\n*[http://www.dofehillary.org.nz/ Information on the International Award Programme] in New Zealand\n*[http://www.dofeshopping.org/expedition-kit Official Expedition Kit List United Kingdom]\n*[http://www.theawardinedinburgh.org Information on the DofE] in Edinburgh\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126033945/http://www.nyaa.org/ Information on the  International Award Programme in Singapore]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008215853/http://www.dofecroydon.co.uk/ Information on the DofE] in Croydon\n*[http://www.award.nl Information on the  International Award Programme] in Netherlands\n*[http://www.gaisce.ie Gaisce – The President's Award]\n*[http://www.usaward.org USA Duke of Edinburgh's Award]\n*"
