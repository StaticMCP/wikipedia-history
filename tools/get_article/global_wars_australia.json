It was the 18th Global Wars event and took place on February 15, 2025, at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The special event, which was taped the same night as AEW's Grand Slam Australia, aired on tape delay on February 17, 2025, on Honor Club. This was the first Global Wars event since 2019 as well as ROH's debut in Australia.\nProduction\nBackground\nGlobal Wars is a professional wrestling event held sporadically by the American promotion Ring of Honor (ROH) since 2012. Originally named \"Border Wars\" and co-produced with the Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling Noah, the event was renamed Global Wars in 2014 after ROH announced a partnership with New Japan Pro-Wrestling.\nUnder the new name, the event became a supershow co-produced by the two promotions. In 2019, ROH announced a three-event tour with the Mexican promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre as the new partner for the series, renamed \"Global Wars Espectacular\". The Global Wars Espectacular tour marked the last Global Wars event held by ROH under the ownership of Sinclair Broadcast Group.\nOn March 2, 2022, it was announced that Tony Khan, the principal owner of All Elite Wrestling (AEW), had purchased ROH. The two promotions operate as sister companies while under Khan's ownership; on January 5, 2025, ROH and AEW held their first co-promoted event, Wrestle Dynasty in the Tokyo Dome.\nOn February 12, 2025, ROH announced that it would revive the \"Global Wars\" name for a co-promoted event with AEW, held at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia on February 15. The event, which was held on the same night and in the same venue as AEW's Grand Slam Australia, marked ROH's debut in Australia. The show aired on tape delay on February 17 on Honor Club.\nStorylines\nGlobal Wars Australia featured five professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines.
