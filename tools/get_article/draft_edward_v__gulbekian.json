He came to London with his mother in 1935 and after a dispute with the Gulbenkian family adopted a form of surname without the medial n.\nHe earned an M.S.C. Degree in Chemistry from the University of London and contributed articles to the Ararat Quarterly, The Armenian Review, Le Muséon, Handes Amsorya, Bazmavēp and RAFT: A Journal of Armenian Poetry and Criticism.\nWhen an Armenian preacher asked his congregation to pray for those Armenians fallen in the war in Nagorno-Karabagh, Gulbekian demanded to know why the same thought was given to fallen Azerbaijanis.\nWorks\nAritcles\n* \"Avarayr in Historical Perspective\".
