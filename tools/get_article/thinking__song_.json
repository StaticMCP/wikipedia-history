The song was originally released on Daltrey's debut solo studio album, Daltrey and released as a single in 1973.\nCashbox said it was as powerful as \"Giving It All Away.\"\nThe non-album B-side, \"There Is Love\", featured Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin on guitar. The song was left off the album because \"It didn't fit in with the final context of the album\", explained Daltrey \"so we had to leave it out\". The song was included on the Sanctuary remaster.\nReferences"
