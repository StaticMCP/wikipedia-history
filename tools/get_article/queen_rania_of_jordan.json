She has stated that an essential aspect of education is to equip young people with the necessary skills to perform well in the workplace. She has said that education is a tool for individuals to empower themselves, allows the poor to improve their lives, and is an investment Jordan makes to protect its people from being exploited and falling victim to  extremist ideology.\nIn July 2005 in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the King and Queen launched an annual teachers' award, the Queen Rania Award for Excellence in Education.\nThe Queen is chairperson of Jordan's first interactive children's museum, which opened in May 2007.

This led to the launch, in 1998, of JRF's Child Safety Program, which addresses the immediate needs of children at risk from abuse and initiated a long-term campaign to increase public awareness about violence against children. The deaths of two children in Amman as a result of child abuse in early 2009 led Rania to call for an emergency meeting of government and non-government (including JRF) stakeholders to discuss where the system was failing.\nIn 2009, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of her husband's accession to the throne, Rania launched a community champion award (Ahel Al Himmeh) to highlight the accomplishments of groups and individuals who have helped their local communities.
