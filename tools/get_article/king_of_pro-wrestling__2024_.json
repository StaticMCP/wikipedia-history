After the match Sabre declared that he would challenge for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship at King of Pro-Wrestling instead; usually the winner of the G1 Climax would receive an IWGP World Heavyweight Championship match at Wrestle Kingdom. Zack will face Tetsuya Naito for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship after Naito successfully defended his title against Great-O-Khan at Destruction in Kobe.\nEvent\nThe event started with the singles confrontation between Consejo Mundial De Lucha Libre (CMLL)'s Místico and Hiromu Takahashi, solded with the victory of the latter.
