He is known for his public positions on various religious and social issues.\nEarly life and education\nUmashankar Pandey was born on 15 August 1969 in Brahmanpur village, Pratapgarh district, Uttar Pradesh, to Anara Devi and Pandit Ramsumer Pandey. He received his primary education in his village. According to local news sources, he is reported to have undergone preliminary religious initiation at the age of eight.\nPandey later moved to Varanasi under the guidance of Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati. He continued his Sanskrit studies at Bajoria Sanskrit College and Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, where he obtained an Acharya degree in Navya Vyakarana (New Logic Grammar). During his time in Varanasi, he also assisted Swami Karpatri Maharaj during his final days, participating in daily rituals.\nDuring his university years, he was involved in student politics, and was elected as Vice President of the Student Union as an independent candidate, and later as President of the Student Council.\nHe has an elder brother, Girija Shankar Pandey, and six sisters. Two of his sisters have taken sanyas (monastic vows).\nSpiritual career\nIn 2000, Umashankar Pandey received initiation (diksha) into sanyasa (monastic life) from Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati, becoming Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati. He spent many years under Swaroopanand Saraswati's tutelage, studying Vedanta and other Hindu scriptures, and assisting in the administration of the Jyotir Math.\nFollowing the death of Swaroopanand Saraswati in September 2022, Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati was formally appointed as the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math. However, the Supreme Court temporarily halted his coronation ceremony after it had heard an application allegedly saying that Saraswati falsely claimed to be the successor of the late Saraswati.\nPublic positions and controversies\nAvimukteshwaranand Saraswati participated in the movement to purify the Ganges River, culminating in the government declaring it a national river in 2008.\nIn 2018, he opposed the demolition of ancient temples during the construction of the Kashi Corridor, holding protests and padyatras.\nHe has advocated for a nationwide ban on cow slaughter and the declaration of the cow as \"Rashtra Mata.\" He has also urged political parties to pledge against cow slaughter ahead of elections.\nHe has been involved in the ongoing dispute regarding the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi, advocating for Hindu rights to pray at the site. In 2022, he announced plans for a puja at the Gyanvapi Mosque site, leading to police intervention and a hunger strike.\nHe filed a defamation suit against Govindanand Saraswati for calling him a \"fake baba\".\nIn February 2025, a 10-year-old video of him being pursued by the police in Varanasi was falsely shared on social media as a recent incident.\nSee also\n*Advaita Vedanta\n*Adi Shankara\n*Nischalananda Saraswati\nReferences"
