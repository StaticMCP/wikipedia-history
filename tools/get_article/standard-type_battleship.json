These were considered super-dreadnoughts, with the ships of the final two classes incorporating many lessons from the Battle of Jutland.\nEach vessel was produced with a series of progressive innovations, which contributed to the pre–World War I arms race. The twelve vessels commissioned constituted the US Navy's main battle line in the interwar period, while many of the ten earlier dreadnoughts were scrapped or relegated to secondary duties. Restrictions under the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty limited total numbers and size of battleships and had required some under construction to be cancelled,  so it was not until the onset of World War II that new battleships were constructed. On 7 December 1941, eight were at Pearl Harbor, one at Bremerton, Washington, and three were assigned to the Atlantic Fleet.\nDoctrine\nThe Standard type, by specifying common tactical operational characteristics between classes, allowed battleships of different classes to operate together as a tactical unit (BatDiv) against enemy battleships. By contrast, other navies had fast and slow battleship classes that could not operate together unless limited to the performance of the ship with slowest speed and widest turning circle. Otherwise the battle line would be split into separate \"fast\" and \"slow\" wings. The Standard type was optimized for the battleship-centric naval strategy of the era of their design.\nThe next US battleship classes, beginning with the  designed in the late 1930s and commissioned in 1941, marked a departure from the Standard type, introducing the fast battleships needed to escort the aircraft carriers that came to dominate naval strategy.\nList of Standard-type battleships\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Ship name\n!Class\n!Hull No.\n!Builder\n!Laid down\n!Launched\n!Commissioned\n!Decommissioned\n!Fate\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2|\n|BB-36\n|Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts\n|4 November 1912\n|11 July 1914\n|11 March 1916\n|29 August 1946\n|Struck 12 August 1948; sunk as a target, 31 July 1948\n|-\n|\n|BB-37\n|New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey\n|26 October 1912\n|23 March 1914\n|2 May 1916\n|1 September 1944\n|Struck 1 September 1944; hulk sank while under tow, 17 May 1947\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2|\n|BB-38\n|Newport News Shipbuilding Company, Newport News, Virginia\n|27 October 1913\n|16 March 1915\n|12 June 1916\n|29 August 1946\n|Target ship, Operation Crossroads; scuttled, 10 February 1948\n|-\n|\n|BB-39\n|New York Naval Shipyard\n|16 March 1914\n|19 June 1915\n|17 October 1916\n|29 December 1941\n|Sunk during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=3|\n|BB-40\n|Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York City\n|14 October 1915\n|13 April 1917\n|20 May 1918\n|19 July 1946\n|Struck 25 February 1947; broken up at Newark, 1947\n|-\n|\n|BB-41\n|Newport News Shipbuilding, Newport News\n|5 April 1915\n|25 January 1917\n|18 December 1917\n|17 September 1956\n|Struck 17 September 1956; broken up at Baltimore, 1956\n|-\n|\n|BB-42\n|New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden\n|20 January 1915\n|30 June 1917\n|24 March 1919\n|3 July 1946\n|Broken up at Newark, 1947\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2|\n|BB-43\n|New York Naval Shipyard\n|14 May 1917\n|30 April 1919\n|3 June 1920\n|14 February 1947\n|Struck 1 March 1959; sold for scrap, 10 July 1959\n|-\n|\n|BB-44\n|Mare Island Naval Shipyard\n|25 October 1916\n|20 November 1919\n|10 August 1921\n|14 February 1947\n|Struck 1 March 1959; sold for scrap, 10 July 1959\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=4|\n|BB-45\n|New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey\n|29 May 1919\n|22 March 1921\n|30 August 1923\n|7 January 1947\n|Struck 1 March 1959; sold for scrap, 23 July 1959\n|-\n|\n|BB-46\n|Newport News Shipbuilding Company, Newport News, Virginia\n|24 April 1917\n|20 March 1920\n|21 July 1921\n|3 April 1947\n|Struck 1 March 1959; sold for scrap, 8 July 1959\n|-\n|\n|BB-47\n|New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey\n|30 June 1919\n|1 September 1921\n|colspan=2\n|Cancelled after signing of Washington Naval Treaty; sunk as target, 25 November 1924\n|-\n|\n|BB-48\n|Newport News Shipbuilding Company, Newport News, Virginia\n|12 April 1920\n|17 November 1921\n|1 December 1923\n|9 January 1947\n|Struck 1 March 1959; sold for scrap, 24 August 1959\n|}\nCharacteristics\nCharacteristics of the Standard type included:\n* all-or-nothing armor scheme\n* All main guns on the centerline in fore and aft turrets with no amidships guns\n* designed range of about  at economical cruising speed\n* top speed of\n* tactical turn radius of 700 yards\nThe , the first US battleships to mount  guns, represented the endpoint of the gradual evolution of the \"Standard Type\" battleships. The Colorado-class battleships were  long, displaced 32,600 tons, had a top speed of , and carried a main battery of eight  guns.\nThe next planned class of Standard battleships, the never-completed s, represented a significant increase in size and armament over the Colorados. They would have been  long, displaced 43,200 tons, had a top speed of , and carried 12  guns. Nonetheless, the design characteristics of the South Dakotas closely followed the Standard-type battleship, albeit at a greater scale. Like the Tennessees and Colorados, they were designed with the same bridges, lattice masts and turbo-electric propulsion system and they used the same torpedo protection system as the latter class. Naval historian Norman Friedman described the South Dakotas as the ultimate development of the series of U.S. battleships that began with the , despite the increase in size, speed and intermediate armament from the standard type that characterized the Nevada through Colorado classes.\nService history\nWorld War I\nAll the Standard-types were oil-burning. Since oil was scarce in the British Isles, only Nevada and Oklahoma actively participated in World War I by escorting convoys across the Atlantic Ocean between the United States and Britain.\nInterwar years\nAll the Standard types were modernized during the 1920s and 1930s. The cage masts of all but the Tennessee and Colorado classes were replaced with tripod masts topped with fire-control directors, torpedo tubes were removed and anti-aircraft guns were upgraded. Main battery elevation in the older ships was increased to 30 degrees for greater range. Most of the Standards received anti-torpedo bulges. Each ship received one or two catapults and recovery cranes for operating floatplanes for scouting and gunnery spotting.\nWorld War II\nOn 7 December 1941, Colorado was undergoing a refit to install new torpedo bulges at Puget Sound Navy Yard, while the three ships of the New Mexico class were assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. The remaining eight Standard type battleships were at Pearl Harbor, Pennsylvania in drydock at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and the other seven forming Battleship Row.\nDuring the Pearl Harbor attack, Arizona forward magazine exploded from a bomb hit  and Oklahoma capsized after multiple torpedo strikes, both with significant losses of life. West Virginia and California were also sunk, while Nevada managed to get underway and was beached shortly afterward. Tennessee and Maryland each received two bomb hits.\nArizona and Oklahoma were considered permanent losses, but the other damaged and sunk battleships were salvaged and sent to the West Coast for repairs and reconstruction. Nevada and Pennsylvania received entirely new superstructures with revised secondary armaments of 5\"/38 DP guns in twin mounts, as well as numerous new 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm AA guns. Tennessee, California and West Virginia were even more thoroughly rebuilt, incorporating not just changes similar to Nevada but increased deck armor, torpedo bulges and improved subdivision and a modern radar and electronics suite, though their widened beam exceeded the Panama Canal restrictions which limited their operations to the Pacific. Maryland, Colorado, and the three New Mexico–class ships were too urgently needed in 1942 to undergo similar rebuilds. Most changes to these ships focused on updating their radar suites and expanding their light AA armaments, though Idaho would receive an updated secondary battery of 5\"/38 guns in late 1944 and Maryland received a partial rebuild that was completed in August 1945 just as Japan surrendered.\nThe ten surviving Standard type battleships served throughout World War II primarily as fire support for amphibious landings. Their low speed relegated them to second line duties as they were too slow to accompany the fleet carriers that had become the dominant combatant. Six of them participated in the last battleship versus battleship engagement in naval history, the Battle of Surigao Strait, where none of them were hit.\nFates\nArizona and Oklahoma were sunk during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Their sister ships Pennsylvania and Nevada were used as targets in the Operation Crossroads atomic tests in 1946; Pennsylvania was not fully repaired after being severely damaged by an air-launched torpedo in the closing days of the Pacific War. In 1946 Mississippi was converted to a test vessel for new gun and missile systems and served until 1956. Most other Standard-type battleships were decommissioned in 1946 or 1947 and placed in the reserve fleet; ultimately all were scrapped by 1961.\nFootnotes\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n* }}\n* Barber, G.
