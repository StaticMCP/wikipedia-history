It had a yellow five-towered Angkor Wat silhouette in the center like the first. In some versions the Angkor Wat of the State of Cambodia flag displayed the architectural details of the Angkorian structure outlined in black.\nAlthough the flags of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, and later the flag of the State of Cambodia, became the official flags within Cambodia after the ousting of the Khmer Rouge government of Democratic Kampuchea, the flag of Democratic Kampuchea would still be used by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and in the United Nations. As the PRK failed to gain widespread international recognition most states kept diplomatic ties with the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.\nSymbolism\nRed symbolizes blood and revolution. The five-towered Angkor Wat silhouette refers to the unity of soldiers, traders, workers, peasants and intellectuals of Kampuchea. The symbolism are fundamentally the same to the five-pointed star on the Flag of Vietnam.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve1Dw0dF-zc People's Republic of Kampuchea (1979–1989)]"
