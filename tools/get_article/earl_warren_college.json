It is named for former California governor and chief justice Earl Warren. Warren College was founded in 1974 in as Fourth College, and later moved to its present location, which is located near the canyon, with nearby Hopkins Parking Structure to the west on the other side of the canyon. Voigt Drive runs through the Warren College campus and connects to Hopkins Drive on the other side of the canyon, to the west. Since fall 2020, Warren College is the only college not located on Ridge Walk, which overlooks the coastline, when Sixth College moved for second time from its former location in Pepper Canyon (now partially demolished and the site of transfer student housing) to its new home in the North Torrey Pines Living and Learning Neighborhood (NTPLLN) on Ridge Walk built on former Muir Parkings Lots (P207 and P208) directly north of Muir College.\nResidence halls and apartments\nResidence halls in Warren College\nEach of the residence halls within Warren College is named after justices that sat on the U.S. Supreme Court along with Chief Justice Warren. Residence halls are located near the ecological reserve, a canyon filled with eucalyptus trees and hiking trails.\nResidence Halls:\n*Stewart\n*Frankfurter\n*Harlan\nApartments (for both first and second year students):\n*Black\n*Brennan\n*Douglas\n*Goldberg\nGraduate student apartments are also available on the Warren College Campus.\nAcademic and Other Facilities\nWarren College hosts a variety of academic buildings, lecture halls, departmental buildings (which include classrooms, labs, offices, etc.), and other facilities, particularly for engineering and some STEM-focused departments.\nThe Canyon Vista Marketplace and dining hall, operated by UC San Diego's Housing Dining Hospitality (HDH), serves the Warren College area and is likely named as such due to its own location overlooking the canyon as well as the fact that Warren's location as a whole is near the canyon. Canyon Vista consists of a dining-operated market, as well as food service stations including a grill called Fusion Grill, Three-Sixty, Fresh, and a coffee bar named Earl's Coffeehouse, and according to the HDH website, mobile ordering app, as well as signage and promotional materials located in the dining hall, is the only dining hall on the UC San Diego campus that is certified for and serves halal food, such as halal chicken, on campus.\nThe Warren College campus is also home to an enormous rock sculpture in the shape of a bear, officially named Bear by Tim Hawkinson, which was completed in 2005 and is more commonly and unofficially known as \"Bearl,\" which is wordplay combining he words \"Bear\" and \"Earl,\" located on the engineering quad, and is part of the Stuart Collection. Warren is also home to another Stuart Collection art piece, Fallen Star (completed 2012), a slanted house on top of a building, designed by Do Ho Suh, a Korean immigrant describing the immigrant experience which is oftentimes disorienting, located on the roof of the Engineering Building also known as Jacobs Hall and is accessible from the 8th and top floor, facing in the direction of Warren Mall.\nStudent life and involvement\nWarren College has various student committees, including Warren College Student Council (WCSC), Warren College Events Board (E-Board), Warren Transfer and Commuter Commission (WTCC), Commission on Warren Spirit (COWS), Frosh Small Group, Provost's Student Advisory Council (PSAC), Warren College Honors Council, Warren Initiative for Student Health (WISH), and Warren Association of Volunteer Enthusiasts (WAVE).\nAcademic Programs and Requirements\nPrograms of Concentration\nAll courses are organized into three disciplines, (1) math/physical sciences, (2) social sciences, and (3) the humanities. Warren College allows students to pursue a major of their choice in any discipline while requiring the completion of two Programs of Concentration (PofCs) in the other two disciplines. Each Program of Concentration is composed of six courses, of 4-units, (e.g., a history major could take six classes in political science and six classes in biology as well).\nEngineering students\nStudent looking towards an engineering, B.S. degree, however, are required to complete two area studies (A/S), each comprising three courses of 4 units, at least two of which must be upper-division courses. Similar to PofCs, area studies must be non-contiguous to the student's major and to each other.\nPanorama of Warren Mall, containing the major engineering buildings at UC San Diego.\nWarren College is home to a large number of engineering students because its general education requirements are more flexible for students pursuing an undergraduate degree in engineering. Additionally, many engineering departments have facilities located in or near Warren College. However, regardless, as students can choose to major in any program or department, provided they are eligible (e.g. a non-capped major or qualifies for a capped major), regardless of their college of registration, despite students' college choice rankings and preferences on their applications, it is not guaranteed that engineering students will be automatically assigned to Warren.\nIn 2006, the college has added a new building dedicated to the study of Information Technology, called Calit2, known as Qualcomm Institute (QI) at its UC San Diego branch.\nWriting program\nWarren Collège's writing program, conspicuity known as Warren College Writing Program (WCWP) (or unofficially, simply \"Warren Writing\" or \"Warren Writing Program\" for short), consists of a two-quarter sequence for students who entered as a first-year and a one-quarter course for transfer students (who, in most cases, have already taken their English language requirements at their previous institutions as a UC application requirement), based on the model of argumentation developed by British philosopher Stephen Toulmin.\nNaming Controversy\nDuring a Warren College Student Council meeting in 2023, the then-assistant dean of Warren College, Katy Brecht, noted that the use of the Warren College name may need to be used in moderation and with sensitivity at times and for the promotion of certain events as namesake of the college, Earl Warren, may be controversial due to his actions during his time as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the resulting implications it had on Asian Americans, particularly those of Japanese descent.\nFrequent controversies when creating namesakes after people may have resulted in UC San Diego campus administration and leadership to have a shift in attitude that is more reluctant towards naming other, more recently opened colleges currently still using a numbered system, especially after people, which is particularly notable as Sixth College, originally opened in September 2001, is still yet to be named more than two decades later as of April 2025. Additionally, the reluctance to name new and future buildings after people, as is tradition in the past, which is also noticeable in the naming of the NTPLLN buildings hosting Sixth College, has been officially confirmed during a naming committee meeting of the Pepper Canyon West (PCW) buildings (built on the site of the former, demolished Camp Snoopy) intended to house additional transfer students, then under construction, in summer 2023, when the naming criteria was shared among attendees (including one student member, who served as the Warren College Student Council (WCSC) Transfer At-Large Representative during the preceding (2022-2023) and succeeding (2023-2024) school years and confirmed the information regarding the naming guidelines), which stated that, among others, the buildings should not be named after people at all, but rather use positive, abstract or conceptual themes, which is also visible in and similar to other newer developments around campus. As such, the two towers of the PCW development were named Rya (North Tower) and Vela (South Tower). The reasons given for this guidance and policy during the naming meeting was due to the controversies that often arises from naming after people, since people are complex, multifaceted, and imperfect by nature.\nReferences"
