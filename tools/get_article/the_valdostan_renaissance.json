In the 2020 Valdostan regional election the party won 5.0% of the vote and no seats.\nIn May 2022 the party held its first congress, during which it changed its name to The Valdostan Renaissance.\nIn the 2022 general election Girardini ran for the Chamber of Deputies, winning 11.9% of the vote.\nIn May 2024 the party's assembly confirmed Girardini as president. Later that year, LRV, Edelweiss, the Valdostan Rally, For Autonomy and minor groups started negotiations for a \"centrist, liberal-democratic and reformist\" coalition, but, finally, LRV opted to join the regional centre-right coalition instead.\nIn the 2025 Valdostan regional election the party ran in a joint list with Forza Italia (FI), obtaining 10.0% of the vote and four regional councillors, including LRV's Eleonora Baccini. In the concurring 2025 muncipal election in Aosta Girardini ran again for mayor, with the support of the entire centre-right coalition, being narrowly defeated in the run-off. After the elections, FI joined the new regional government led by Renzo Testolin of the Valdostan Union (UV), while LRV did not. After that, LRV formed a separate group in the Council of the Valley.\nElection results\nRegional elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Election\n! Votes\n! %\n!
