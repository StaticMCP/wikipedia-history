      "text": "# Pro Lombardy Independence\n\nPro Lombardy Independence (Pro Lombardia Indipendenza) was an independentist party active in Lombardy, Italy.\nThe party, which was launched in 2011, was led by Alfredo Gatta; the spokesman is Alessandro Ceresoli.\nThe first objective of the party was the independence of the present-day Lombardy region, but it hopes for a unification of the 'Historical Lombardy', which in its eyes includes Emilia (part of the Emilia-Romagna region), the provinces of Novara and Verbano-Cusio-Ossola and the commune of Tortona (all three part of the Piedmont Region), and the 'Swiss Lombardia' (the Canton of Ticino and parts of the Canton of Graubünden).\nAccording to its former president Giovanni Roversi, 'We don't want independence to build walls nor in opposition to other peoples: for us, a Sicilian is a European brother as is a citizen from Bavaria or from Galicia. We have an inclusive speech”.\nThe party was a member of the European Free Alliance.\nLeadership\n*President: Alberto Reboldi (2011–2013), Giovanni Roversi (2013–2019), Alfredo Gatta (2019-present)\n*Spokesperson: Giacomo Consalez (2013–2015), Giovanni Roversi (2011–2013), Juri Orsi (2015–2019), Alessandro Ceresoli (2019–present)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
