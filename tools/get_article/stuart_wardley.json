His debut came on 7 August 1999 when he was a late substitute, for Jermaine Darlington in Rangers' 3–1 win at home to Huddersfield Town.\nIn January 2002, Wardley joined Rushden & Diamonds on loan, signing on a free transfer in April 2002. He missed most of the 2003–04 season due to a serious knee injury. He played pre-season for Bishop Stortford and in August 2004 joined Torquay United on a one-month contract. He signed a three-month contract extension in September 2004, but left in October 2004 to join Leyton Orient. He moved to Cambridge United on non-contract terms in January 2005, playing just three times before being released after a month. He had a trial with Rushden in February 2005, but was not offered a contract.\nHe played for Saffron Walden Town before signing for Bedford Town in March 2005. He left Bedford at the end of the season.\nIn 2008, he was appointed as joint-manager of Bishops Stortford Swifts.\nIn September 2008, he was playing for Debden, and from the start of the 2009 season he has played for Haverhill Rovers, scoring on his debut for the club in a 1–1 draw with Dereham Town. In 2012, he re-signed for Saffron Walden as a player-coach. He was appointed joint manager of the club alongside Colin Wallington in 2013, and became sole manager of the club in 2014. In September 2018 he left the club.\nOn 6 February 2019, Wardley was announced as the new manager of Haverhill Rovers. However, he resigned from the role in May.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
