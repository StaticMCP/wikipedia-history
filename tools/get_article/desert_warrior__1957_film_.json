Some scenes were shot on location in Cairo, but this coincided with the outbreak of the Suez Crisis. The film's sets were designed by the art directors Sigfrido Burmann and Mario Garbuglia.\nPlot\nIbrahim is a despot with ambitions – he wants to bring peace to the kingdom of Kamal, even if it is by assassinating all his opponents. With the help of his less than trustworthy subordinate Selim, he manages to ensure that nobody even dares to utter any objections; nor the rightful ruler, Sultan Omar, or his son Prince Said. However, the latter plans a plot against Ibrahim. In order to raise the necessary money, Said and his men raid caravans. During one such raid, he meets Princess Amina, the despot's daughter, who pretends to be a dancer. Amina falls in love with him, which poses problems for her father, who has promised her in marriage to Selim. Said and his people succeed in ousting Ibrahim from the throne and happily ends with Amina.\nCast\n* Carmen Sevilla as Princess Amina\n* Ricardo Montalbán as Prince Said\n* Gino Cervi as Ibrahim\n* José Guardiola as Kamal\n* Franca Bettoia as Suleika\n* Samia Gamal\n* Manuel Alcón\n* Mariangela Giordano\n* Manuel Guitián\n* Domingo Rivas\n* Joaquín Bergía\n* Félix Briones\n* Pilar Gómez Ferrer\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n*"
