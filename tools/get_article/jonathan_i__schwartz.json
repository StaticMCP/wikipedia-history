Schwartz\n\n|birth_place   = California, U.S.\n|nationality   = American\n|education     = Wesleyan University\n}}\nJonathan Ian Schwartz (born October 20, 1965) is an American businessman. He is president and CEO of CareZone, a firm intending to lower the price of prescription drugs for people with chronic illness.\nBefore founding CareZone, Schwartz had a nearly 15-year tenure with Sun Microsystems, culminating in being its CEO just prior to and during the company's battle for survival during the 2008 financial crisis, and its subsequent acquisition by Oracle.\nHe was also the founder and chief executive officer of Lighthouse Design, Ltd., a software company focused on the NeXTSTEP platform. Lighthouse was acquired by Sun in 1996.\nBackground\nSchwartz was born in Southern California, and spent much of his childhood moving between the West Coast and Washington, D.C., graduating in 1983 from Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in Bethesda, Maryland. With aspirations of becoming an architect, in 1983 he entered college at Carnegie Mellon University, and subsequently transferred to Wesleyan University in 1984. At Wesleyan, he ran short of funds and was preparing to drop out, when a friend suggested he apply for a scholarship, the Gilbert Clee Scholarship. He was awarded the scholarship, which funded the remainder of his university expenses. He received dual degrees in mathematics and economics.\nIn 1987, Schwartz was nearly killed while riding on the Amtrak Colonial train that crashed in Chase, Maryland. He is cited in interviews as saying the incident had a profound impact on his life.\nCareer\nSchwartz started his career in 1987 at McKinsey & Company in New York City. In 1989, Schwartz left McKinsey and moved to Chevy Chase, Maryland, where he was a co-founder of Lighthouse Design, a company focused on building software for NeXT Computer, Inc. In the early 1990s, Lighthouse Design moved to San Mateo, California. Eventually, Schwartz became chief executive officer of Lighthouse.\nIn 1996, with NeXT failing in the marketplace and the internet beginning to explode globally, Lighthouse was acquired by Sun Microsystems.\nHe began his career at Sun working for Eric Schmidt, then the head of Sun Labs. After Schmidt's departure for Novell, Schwartz became the director of product marketing for JavaSoft in 1997 and then transitioned through a series of vice president positions. In 2004, Schwartz was promoted to president and chief operating officer of Sun. He eventually succeeded Scott McNealy as CEO in April 2006.\nAs CEO of Sun\nAs CEO of Sun, he changed Sun's historically poor embrace of open source and freely distributed software, attempting to drive adoption, in particular, of Sun's operating system, Solaris. Sun's decision to abandon Solaris on Intel compatible x86 computers, he stated in subsequent interviews and blog postings, had undermined the hardware platforms on which Sun depended for revenue – hardware systems that ran only Sun's Solaris.\nSun's stock reached a high of $26.25 in 2007, a point just prior to which private equity investors KKR invested $750 million in a convertible debt financing. With nearly a third of its revenue derived from financial services companies, the 2008 financial crisis affected Sun especially hard. With large customers going bankrupt across the world, Schwartz began looking for a buyer for Sun.\nSchwartz ultimately finalized an acquisition, signing an agreement for the sale of the company to Oracle Corporation on April 20, 2009. Oracle had been Sun's largest ISV, and the price of its database was typically a multiple of the price of the Sun hardware on which it ran. Thus, Oracle had the ability, by modifying its pricing, to determine which hardware vendors were chosen. After the acquisition, Oracle dropped the pricing of its database software on Sun hardware, in an attempt to boost its sales performance.\nAs CEO of Sun, Schwartz was known as one of the few Fortune 500 CEOs to use a blog for public communications. He also managed a public exchange with SEC Chairman Christopher Cox about the use of websites and blogs for the dissemination of financial information to meet Regulation Fair Disclosure.\nPost-Sun\nOn February 4, 2010, Schwartz resigned from his post as CEO of Sun. His resignation was a haiku on Twitter that read as follows: \"Financial crisis/Stalled too many customers/CEO no more.\"\nOn August 12, 2010, Schwartz was named to Taleo Corporation's board of directors. On September 9, 2010, he announced that he was founding a new company, Picture of Health, which later became CareZone.\nCareZone\nSan Francisco-based CareZone officially launched February 15, 2012. CareZone enables users to create a password-protected, centralized repository of information related to the care of children, parents or other family and friends. Users can author journals, organize personal information, store documents, and share access to a controlled group of individuals. Schwartz said he started CareZone for people like himself who must simultaneously care for children and parents but find social networking sites to be inappropriate (owing to lax privacy or business models predicated on selling private information), and insufficiently targeted toward the act of caring for family members. Schwartz developed CareZone with Apple and Microsoft veteran Walter Smith.\nIdeology\nSchwartz has been outspoken about technology as a social utility that creates an opportunity to drive economic, political and societal progress.\nReferences\nArticles\n* [https://www.ft.com/content/5eb9e272-82c7-11dd-a019-000077b07658 Markets set free by open source] – Financial Times.com September 16, 2008 – Article discusses how the internet and open source allow people to participate directly in broadening economic opportunity, speeding social progress and driving market efficiency.\n* [https://archive.today/20120731040251/http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Suns-OpenDoor-Policy/ Sun's 'Open'-Door Policy] – eWeek March 15, 2008 – Article discusses how the company is leveraging open source to make new enterprise inroads.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003514/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2007/tc2007104_507418.htm The 'Warrior' Within Jonathan Schwartz] – Article discusses Schwartz' personal history and rise, accessed January 22, 2008\n* [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/15/BUGPDMQ1T956.DTL Sun CEO Emerges From McNealy's Shadow.] – San Francisco Chronicle.
