He was often referred to as Syc and later Old Syc.\nEarly life\nSycamore was born in on 24 August 1855 at Duke Street, Chelmsford, the first son of John Sycamore and Eliza Moss. John was a maltster and came from East Doneyland (Rowhedge) on the river Colne.  Eliza's family were farmers from St Lawrence on the south bank of the Blackwater.\nWhen Sycamore was twelve he joined the crew of a fishing boat.  After several seasons fishing, he moved to yachting in 1875, working initially for the Marquis of Ailsa aboard the Lady Evelyn. Her voyages included trips to the West Indies and Mediterranean. In 1879 he went to work for H Atkins of Warrenpoint in the 20 ton cutter Louise.  His first command was the Amberwitch in 1884.  Following early successes in the Babe, he rose rapidly to the top of his profession, and remained there until his death on 9 April 1930.\nHe married Elizabeth Rosetta Paine, daughter of a licensed victualler, on 2 November 1881.  The family moved to Brightlingsea in 1884 living at 34 Nelson Street and then from 1913 White Lodge.\nYachts commanded\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

On 9 April 1930, he died at his home in Brightlingsea, at the age of 74.\nBibliography\n* The Field 1875\n* Lloyds Yacht Register 1878\n* Yachting Volumes 1 and 2.  Badminton Library 1894\n* Yachting World Selected editions from 1895\n* Leslie's.
