It includes three lakes with camping and recreation areas, and a riverside trail that runs along the banks of the North Platte River.  There are also over 30 garden spots.\nDecember 16, 2017 two brother grizzly bears went on exhibit. In the spring of 2017 their mother was illegally killed in Wyoming.  State and Federal wildlife officials hoped the two orphaned cubs would survive in the wild without their mother.   After several months on their own in the wild, the two cubs became increasingly habituated to humans for food.  State and Federal wildlife officials were concerned about public safety and the well-being of the grizzly cubs.  When it was evident the cubs were not going to survive in the wild on their own, State and Federal wildlife officials made the decision to capture the two cubs and try to find them a home.  Riverside Discovery Center offered to assist in the rescue of the two cubs and to provide a new home for these two grizzly bear cubs.\nRiverside Discovery Center was directly in the path of the August 21, 2017 total eclipse.\nRiverside discovery center was not re-accredited by the AZA in September 2023.\nAnimals\nThe Riverside Discovery Center has a collection of over 125 animals representing 50+ different species, in various exhibits.\nNorth American Grasslands\nContains animals once common in the grasslands of North America:\n* American bison (Bison bison)\nGarden Walk\n* Box turtle\n* Greek tortoise\n* African spurred tortoise\n* Blue-and-yellow macaw\nSlither Inn\nmostly education animals behind the scenes\n* Bearded dragon\n* Boa constrictor\n* Borneo python\n* Grammostola pulchripes\n* Mexican black kingsnake\n* Uromastyx lizard\n* Chinese water dragon\nRaptor Row\nContains a collection of various raptors:\n* Bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)\n* Turkey vulture (Cathartes aura)\n* Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni)\n*Red Tailed Hawk\n*Rough-legged Buzzard\nRainforest Discovery Center\nAn area dedicated to some of the smaller animals of the rainforest\n* Waldrapp ibis (Geronticus eremita)\n*Mission golden-eyed tree frog\n*Squirrel Monkey\n*Emerald Tree Boa\nChimpanzee Building\nHome of the areas chimpanzee and other unique creatures:\n*Chimpanzee\n*Ball python\n*Uromastyx\n*Leopard Gecko\nCat Complex\nHome to various big cats:\n*Hyena\n*Bobcat( Lynx rufus )\nPrimate Building\nContains a small collection of primates:\n*Colombian spider monkey\n*Chinchilla\n*Red ruffed lemur\nZebra Circle\n* Zebra\n* Swift Fox\n*Muntjac\nChildren's Zoo\n*Donkey (Equus asinus)\n*Pot-bellied pig\n*Highland Cattle\n*Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo)\nPond\n*Trumpeter Swan\nMiscellaneous exhibits\nThere are other animals that are not included in any of the aforementioned exhibits:\n*Grizzly Bear\n*Marbled Fox\n*Porcupine\nConservation\nThe Riverside Discovery Center is actively involved in the Survival Species Program for various species of imperiled wildlife on display.\nThe zoo and park is located a half mile west of Nebraska Highway 71.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
