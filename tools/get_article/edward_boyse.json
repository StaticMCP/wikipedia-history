Boyse FRS, AAAS, NAS(August 11, 1923 &ndash; July 14, 2007) was a British-born, American physician and biologist best known for his research on the immune system and pheromones.\nLife\nBoyse was born in Worthing, England, and studied medicine at the University of London.\nBoyse joined the staff of Sloan-Kettering in New York City in 1962 following an appointment at New York University. He was a professor of biology at Cornell University Medical College between 1969 and 1989 and a professor at the University of Arizona between 1989 and 1994.\nBoyse and others were among the earlier researchers to look at how the immune system responded to antigens using mice focussing on the role of white blood cells. In 1975, he won the Cancer Research Institute William B. Coley Award for distinguished research in immunology. in 1976 he won the Isaac Adler prize awarded jointly by Harvard and Rockefeller Universities. He later studied how animals can communicate through odors.
