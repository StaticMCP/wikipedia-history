His scientific research contributed to the understanding of the large-scale structure of the northern Appalachian mountains of Atlantic Canada. Neale used his enthusiasm for geology to inform students and the general public about discoveries in his field through television, radio, pamphlets, booklets, news magazines, and the popular press.\nNeale worked with the Geological Survey of Canada and Memorial University of Newfoundland. He, along with John Rodgers of Yale University, were the first to recognize the transported oceanic sedimentary rocks that overlie ancient shelf deposits in western Newfoundland.\nEarly life\nNeale was born in Beaconsfield, Québec in July 1923. He served in the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War between 1943 and 1945. After the war he went to study at McGill University, Montreal. He completed his BSc in 1949. In 1950, Ward married Roxie and they moved to New Haven, Connecticut so Ward could attend Yale University. There he obtained his MSc. (1951) and PhD (1952).\nCareer\nNeale worked briefly as an assistant professor at the University of Rochester, New York, between 1952 and 1954. After that he went on to work for the Geological Survey of Canada. His first position was as to head the Appalachian Geology Section. Between 1963 and 1965, Neale served as the Commonwealth Geology Liaison Officer. When he returned he was given the responsibility to head the Precambrian Geology Section.\nIn 1968, Neale left the Survey to become Professor and head of the Geology Department at Memorial University of Newfoundland. In 1972, he organized a Montreal-based symposium for the International Geological Congress on Geoscience Aid to developing Countries. This symposium led to the creation of the Association of Geoscientists for International Development.\nIn 1976, Neale moved to Calgary as Head of the Geological Information Subdivision of the Institute of Sedimentary and Petroleum Geology. He retained his ties to academia whilst in Calgary by holding an adjunct position at the University of Calgary and acting on the University Senate.\nIn 1982, Neale returned to Newfoundland to accept the position of Vice-President Academic of Memorial University. He held that position until retiring in 1987. After retirement, Ward and his wife moved to Calgary, Alberta.\nOther positions held\n*1972-1973, President of the Geological Association of Canada\n*1973-1978, Director of the Canadian Geological Foundation\n*1974-1980, Editor of the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences\n*1976, President of the Canadian Geoscience Council\n*Chaired the Royal Society of Canada's Committee on Public Awareness of Science\n*co-Founder of the Calgary Science Network\n*1989, Chair of the Calgary Science Network\nHonours and awards\n* was a Fellow of the Geological Society of America for over 50 years\n* was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada\n* 1975, awarded the Bancroft Award by the Royal Society of Canada\n* 1977, awarded an honorary degree from the University of Calgary\n* 1977, awarded a Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal\n* 1977, awarded the R.
