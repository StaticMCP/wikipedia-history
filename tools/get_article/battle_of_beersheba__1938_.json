This operation was conducted in secrecy and surprise as the British thought Beersheba would not be attacked due to its isolation and lack of Zionist settlers. Al-Jolani commanded a group of insurgents to be stationed on the Jerusalem-Hebron route, and another group to guard south of Hebron and block off the Gaza-Hebron road. This operation was initiated at midday on 9 September, after encircling the town.\nThe rebels seized 100 old rifles, a large number of helmets and clothes, and a rapid-fire machine gun, along with two bags of spare parts for it. The rebels later used it to shoot down two British planes in the battle of Jourat Bahlas. The rebels also released prisoners.\nThe rebels did not set up any form of government in the city, as Beersheba was mainly seen as a revolutionary stronghold and the British had limited sway there. Authority over Beersheba was completely regained only in November.\nThe locals greeted the rebels with ululation and rose water.\nReferences"
