They claim that 'the obstacle now to a lasting and durable settlement… is the continuing terrorist and criminal activity of the IRA'. We reject this. It also belies the fact that a possible agreement last December was squandered by both governments pandering to rejectionist unionism instead of upholding their own commitments and honouring their own obligations.\" The statement concluded with two points: \"We are taking all our proposals off the table\" and \"It is our intention to closely monitor ongoing developments and to protect to the best of our ability the rights of republicans and our support base\".\n*3 February 2005: Following statements from the British and Irish governments, claiming that the new IRA statement was no cause for alarm, the IRA issues a second two-sentence statement: \"The two governments are trying to play down the importance of our statement because they are making a mess of the peace process.

Gardaí later found Quinn, barely conscious, and he was taken to hospital in Drogheda where he died.
