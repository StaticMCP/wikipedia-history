The chamber has 200 seats and deputies are elected for four-year terms using the party-list proportional representation system with the Imperiali and Hagenbach-Bischoff quotas. Since 2002, there have been 14constituencies, matching the Czech regions, with district size varying from 8 to 26 representatives. A Cabinet is answerable to the Chamber of Deputies and the Prime Minister stays in office only as long as they retain the support of a majority of its members. The quorum is set by law to one third (67) of elected deputies. Any changes to the constitutional laws must be approved by at least 60 percent of the Chamber of Deputies. The seat of the Chamber of Deputies is the Thun Palace in Malá Strana, Prague.\nElectability and mandate\nEvery citizen of the Czech Republic over 21 years old with the right to vote is eligible to be elected. The Deputy may not hold the office of Senator, President of the Czech Republic or judge, which also applies to certain positions specified by law. The office of the Deputy expires once:\n* a Deputy-elect refuses to take the oath or takes it with reservation\n* a Deputy's tenure expires\n* a Deputy resigns from the office\n* a Deputy loses eligibility to be elected\n* a Deputy takes up an office incompatible with serving as a Deputy.\n* the Chamber of Deputies is dissolved\nDissolution\nAfter a dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, new elections must be held within two months, and the Chamber of Deputies may not be dissolved less than three months before the end of its electoral term. The Chamber of Deputies can only be dissolved by the president under conditions specified by the constitution. The Chamber of Deputies is most commonly dissolved following two votes of no confidence in the cabinet. During a dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate has the authority to take legal measures in its place if necessary.\nSeat of the Chamber of Deputies\nThe Chamber of Deputies resides in three building complexes in Malá Strana, Prague. The main building with the plenary chamber is the Thun Palace, built at the end of the 17th century. It was rebuilt at the start of the 19th century to house the Bohemian Diet. The current plenary chamber was built in 1861 for the reinstated Bohemian Diet after it was dissolved by the Austrian-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1849. The second building was the seat of the Governors of the Kingdom of Bohemia appointed by the emperor, located on Malá Strana Square. The last building complex includes the Smiřický Palace and Šternberk Palace at the opposite side of the square.\nPast Chamber of Deputies election results\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:left;font-size:95%\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 3–4 October 2025 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| || ANO || ODSKDU-ČSLTOP 09 || STAN || Piráti || SPD || AUTO || colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\" style=text-align:center | &nbsp;\n|-\n| }} 34.51%8 (+6.72%) || }} 23.36%19 (-3.76%) || }} 11.23%11 || }} 8.97%14  || }} 7.78%5 (-1.78%) || }} 6.77%(new)\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 8–9 October 2021 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| Fiala || ANO || ODSKDU-ČSLTOP 09(government) || PirátiSTAN(coalition) || SPD || colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\" style=text-align:center | &nbsp;\n|-\n| }} 27.12%6 (-2.52%) || }} 27.79%29 (+5.36%) || }} 15.62%9 (-0.35%) || }} 9.56%2 (-1.08%)\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 20–21 October 2017 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| Babiš I Babiš II || ANO(government) || ODS || Piráti || SPD || KSČM || ČSSD(coalition) || KDU-ČSL || TOP 09 || STAN\n|-\n| }} 29.64%31 (+10.98%) || }} 11.32%9 (+3.59%) || }} 10.79%(new) || }} 10.64%(new) || }} 7.76%18 (−7.15%) || }} 7.27%35 (−13.09%) || }} 5.80%4 (−0.98%) || }} 5.31%19 (−6.69%) || }} 5.18%(new)\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 25–26 October 2013 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| Sobotka || ČSSD(government) || ANO(coalition) || KSČM || TOP 09 || ODS || Úsvit || KDU-ČSL(coalition) || colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=text-align:center | &nbsp;\n|-\n| }} 20.46%6 (−1.62%) || }} 18.66%(new) || }} 14.91%7 (+3.64%) || }} 12.00%15 (−4.70%) || }} 7.73%37 (−12.50%) || }} 6.89%(new) || }} 6.78%(returning)\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 28–29 May 2010 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| NečasRusnok || ČSSD || ODS(government) || TOP 09(coalition) || KSČM || VV(coalition) || colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\" style=text-align:center | &nbsp;\n|-\n| }} 22.08%18 (−10.24%) || }} 20.22%28 (−15.16%) || }} 16.70%(new) || }} 11.27%0 (−1.54%) || }} 10.88%(new)\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 2–3 June 2006 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| Topolánek ITopolánek IIFischer || ODS(government) || ČSSD || KSČM || KDU-ČSL(coalition) || SZ(coalition) || colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\" style=text-align:center | &nbsp;\n|-\n| }} 35.38%23 (+10.91%) || }} 32.32%4 (+2.12%) || }} 12.81%15 (−5.7%) || }} 7.23%9 (−7.04%) || }} 6.29%(new)\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 14–15 June 2002 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| ŠpidlaGrossParoubek || ČSSD(government) || ODS || KSČM || KDU-ČSLUS-DEU(coalition) || colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\" style=text-align:center | &nbsp;\n|-\n| }} 30.20%4 (−2.11%) || }} 24.47%5 (−3.27%) || }} 18.51%17 (+7.48%) || }} 14.27%11 (+5.28%)\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 19–20 June 1998 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| Zeman || ČSSD(government) || ODS || KSČM || KDU-ČSL || US-DEU  || colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\" style=text-align:center | &nbsp;\n|-\n| }} 32.31%13 (+5.87%) || }} 27.74%5 (−1.88%) || }} 11.03%2 (+0.7%) || }} 8.99%2 (+0.91%) ||  8.60%(new)\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 31 Mayand1 June 1996 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| Klaus IITošovský || ODS(government) || ČSSD || KSČM || KDU-ČSL(coalition) || SPR-RSČ || ODA(coalition) || colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" style=text-align:center | &nbsp;\n|-\n| }} 29.62%8 (−0.11%) || }} 26.44%45 (+19.91%) || }} 10.33%13 (−3.72%) || }} 8.08%3 (1.8%) ||  8.01%4 (+2.03%) ||  6.36%1 (+0.43%)\n|}\nAs part of the democratic Czechoslovakia\nDuring this time the Chamber of Deputies was called the National Council.\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:left\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 5–6 June 1992 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| Klaus&nbsp;I || ODS–KDS(government) || KSČM || ČSSD || LSU || KDU–ČSL(coalition) || SPR–RSČ || ODA(coalition) || HSD-SMS\n|-\n| }} 29.73%(new) || }} 14.05%2 (+0.81%) || }} 6.53%(new) ||  6.52%(new) || }} 6.28%5 (−2.14%) ||  5.98%(new) ||  5.93%(new) ||  5.87%9\n|-\n! rowspan=2| 8–9 June 1990 || rowspan=2| 200 seats || rowspan=2| Pithart || OF(government) || KSČ || HSD-SMS(coalition) || KDU(coalition) || colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\" style=text-align:center | &nbsp;\n|-\n| }} 49.50% || }} 13.24% ||  10.03% || }} 8.42%\n|}\nSee also\n* List of presidents of the Chamber of Deputies (Czech Republic)\n* List of MPs elected in the 2025 Czech legislative election\n* List of MPs elected in the 2021 Czech legislative election\n* List of MPs elected in the 2017 Czech legislative election\n* List of MPs elected in the 2013 Czech legislative election\n* List of MPs elected in the 2010 Czech legislative election\n* List of MPs elected in the 2006 Czech legislative election\n* List of MPs elected in the 2002 Czech legislative election\n* List of MPs elected in the 1998 Czech legislative election\n* List of MPs elected in the 1996 Czech legislative election\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Kolář, Petr, and Petr Valenta.
