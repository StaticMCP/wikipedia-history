The division was formed on the mobilization of the German Army in August 1914. The division was disbanded during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division began the war as part of the central reserve of Fortress Thorn (Hauptreserve/Festung Thorn). Although designated a reserve division, initially, it was primarily composed of Landwehr units. In 1916, it was completely reorganized, receiving new brigade headquarters and newly formed regiments.\nCombat chronicle\nThe 35th Reserve Division began the war on the Eastern Front. It fought in the Battle of Tannenberg and the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes. In 1915, it was transferred from Poland to Hungary and saw action in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive. Thereafter, it remained in White Russia until the armistice on the Eastern Front, when it went to Ukraine, where it remained until March 1919. Allied intelligence rated the division as fourth class.\nOrder of battle on mobilization\nThe order of battle of the 35th Reserve Division on mobilization was as follows:\n*5.Landwehr-Infanterie-Brigade\n**Landwehr-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 2\n**Landwehr-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 9\n*20.Landwehr-Infanterie-Brigade\n**Landwehr-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 19\n**Kgl.
