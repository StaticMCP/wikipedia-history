They have been presented annually in London by the Ivors Academy, formerly called the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors, since 1956.\nAwards\nThe awards are presented at two annual ceremonies known as The Ivors and The Ivors Composer Awards.\n*The Ivors take place each May and, as of 2020, are sponsored by Apple Music.
