Native to Colombia, it is grown in more temperate climates as a greenhouse specimen or houseplant for its ornamental foliage.\nDescription\nAnthurium warocqueanum is a member species within Cardiolonchium—the so-called “velvet-leaved” Anthuriums, as they have a covering of tiny, flattened short “hairs” with a texture similar to that of velvet. Fellow velvet-leaf species include some of the most popular and famous plants today, such as A. crystallinum, A. regale, and A. magnificum.\nQueen Anthuriums grow as epiphytic creepers in the rainforests of Colombia, between  in elevation. The leaves range from light-green to very dark greenish-black, and can mature to 3-4 feet long and 15 inches wide. It has a green spathe and spadix, and produces red berries.\nHistory and horticulture\nNamed for the Belgian industrialist and horticulturalist Arthur Warocqué (1835-1880), the queen Anthurium was first collected from Colombia in 1874 by Gustav Wallis (along with Anthurium veitchii) during his time working for Veitch Nurseries. Long sought after for its stunning foliage, Anthurium warocqueanum is well known for being difficult to care for, requiring high humidity, indirect light, and well-draining soil.\nReferences\nExternal links"
