They help to promote and uphold cultural values, facilitate development and resolving of disputes in their communities. The institution of traditional leadership is regulated and monitored within the parameters of the Constitution of Zimbabwe. These leaders are put in position by the government of Zimbabwe to work with the people. A chief is not elected into office by popular vote, but through lineage, and is thus in office for life.\nSee also\n*Zimbabwe Council of Chiefs\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Alexander, Jocelyn, McGregor, JoAnn and Ranger, Terence, (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Oku8QgAACAAJ Violence and Memory: One Hundred Years in the ‘Dark Forests’ of Matabeleland], Oxford: James Currey, 2000\n* Beach, David (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hJrsnQEACAAJ The Shona: 900–1850], Gweru: Mambo Press, 1980\n* Bhebe, N and T.
