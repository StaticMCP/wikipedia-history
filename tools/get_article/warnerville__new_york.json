Located along State Route 7 between Cobleskill and Richmondville, it is the municipality containing the majority of the sites of the Battle of Cobleskill.\nOn June 10, 1778, after receiving reliable reports of May's Cobleskill Massacre, the Board of War of the Continental Congress concluded that a major Indian war was in the offing. This would result in the funding from the Continental Congress and orders of General George Washington that launched the  punitive 1779 Sullivan Expedition, which burned at least 40 Amerindian towns and villages whilst capturing or destroying great stores of foods.\nWarnerville is today the site of the Cobleskill/Richmondville High School and has a post office with the ZIP Code of 12187.\nNotable person\n* Solomon Warner (1811–1899), Mississippi River boatman, California pioneer, first American merchant in Tucson, Arizona\nExternal links\n* [http://www.crcs.k12.ny.us/HighSchool/index.htm/ Cobleskill/Richmondville High School Official Site]"
