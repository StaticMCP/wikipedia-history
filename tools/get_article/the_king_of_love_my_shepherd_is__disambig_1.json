It first appeared in the 1868 appendix to Hymns Ancient and Modern. In 1997 this version was sung at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n# The traditional Irish tune \"St. Columba\". The tune, first transcribed by George Petri in the mid nineteenth century, was paired with the text by Ralph Vaughan Williams in The English Hymnal (1906), in an existing harmonisation by Charles Villiers Stanford.\n# \"Remsen\", by Rees Thomas, which first appeared in Daniel Prothero's Welsh 1918 hymnbook Cân a Mawl, for the Calvanistic Methodists of North America.\n# \"Ich dank' dir schon\", composed by Michael Praetorius in 1610, as published in The Lutheran Hymnal, No. 431 (1941).\nOther choral settings of the text include those by Edward Bairstow (1931), Charles Gounod (1899), Harry Rowe Shelley (1886) and Arthur Somervell (1903). There are many other settings of texts derived from Psalm 23.\nHenry Baker's last words were reportedly lyrics from this hymn.\nLyrics\nReferences"
