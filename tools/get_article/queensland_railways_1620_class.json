They operated in Central and North Queensland as well as hauling commuter trains in Brisbane. The class was withdrawn in the mid 1990s with some sold to John Holland and exported to Malaysia and The Philippines.\n1647 has been recently noted to still be in use with Lafarge cement at Padang Jawa, near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\nSix have been preserved:\n*1620 retained as part of the Queensland Rail Heritage Fleet at the Workshops Rail Museum, North Ipswich, restored for main line operation\n*1632 leased to the Mary Valley Rattler, Gympie.\n*1639 leased to the Mary Valley Rattler, Gympie.\n*1649 leased to the Mary Valley Rattler, Gympie.\n*1650 by the Australian Railway Historical Society, stored at Redbank Railway Workshops\n*1651 at Redbank Workshops\nStatus table of preserved locomotives\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Number\n!In service\n!Withdrawn\n!Owner\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|1620\n|01/1967\n|1991\n|QR Heritage\n|Ipswich Workshops\n|Stored pending complete rewiring of electrical systems.
