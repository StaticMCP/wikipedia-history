      "text": "# Warbound (album)\n\nWarbound is the second album by Christian death metal band Broken Flesh.\nCritical reception\n}}\nThe Metal Resource writes, \"As a band, the performances on this album are great. Many bands in this genre end up with all their songs sounding the same by the time everything is put together, but that is not the case here, which makes this a good listen. Guitar riffs are fast and show good variety; the drumming shows great speed as one would expect in the genre, but also some great variety fills, tempo changes, and double bass work; vocals are not simply all guttural death metal style and are delivered with a sense of strength; and even the bass guitar that is often largely absent from the mix in this genre contributes to the overall sound.\"}}\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Broken Flesh\n* Jacob Mathes – vocals\n* Josh Mathes – bass, vocals\n* Steve Giddens – guitar\n* Kevin Tubby – guitar, vocals\n* Brandon Lopez – drums\n;Production\n* Provo Provenzano – producer, mastering, engineer, mixing\n* Jon Zig – artwork\nReferences"
