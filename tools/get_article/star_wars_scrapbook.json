      "text": "# Star Wars Scrapbook\n\nStar Wars Scrapbook is a book with pull-out reproductions of Star Wars merchandise/artifacts, in a similar fashion to the books Greetings From E Street: The Story of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band and Tupac Shakur Legacy.\nWritten by Stephen J. Sansweet, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal, it contains pictures of Star Wars merchandise as well as a copy of an invitation to a San Francisco press screening of Return of the Jedi, a reprint of the first newsletter of the Official Star Wars Fan Club, and a C-3PO cut out mask. Also included were Movie posters, a punch out X-wing glider and backstage passes to the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. Daly from Entertainment Weekly graded the book as a B and wrote \"It’s charming but creepy, and if Jedi Knights existed, they’d probably rank it alongside winking-Jesus 3-D postcards in the annals of misguided relics of adoration.\"\nReferences"
