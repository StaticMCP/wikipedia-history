Some historians have referred to the battle as \"history's worst friendly fire incident\".\nEvents\nDifferent portions of the Austrian army, which were scouting for forces of the Ottoman Empire, fired on one another by mistake, causing self-inflicted casualties and severely disrupting the Austrian baggage train, during the night of 21–22 September 1788. The Ottomans took advantage and captured the city of Karánsebes (now Caransebeș, Romania):\nHistorical uncertainty\nOther sources include one from 1843, 60 years after the battle. This has made it difficult for some scholars to draw reliable sources and evidence for the detailed account of the battle.\nAt a minimum, the mere fact of the Ottoman capture of the strategic location, without engaging the Austrians, and with Austrian losses reported in contemporary reports, does suggest some significant friendly fire incident by the Austrian forces.\nThe paucity of records on the incident, in turn, might reflect an attempt by the Austrians to hide embarrassing details, or at least a lack of eagerness to share them.\nTraditional narrative\nThe traditional narrative of the battle likely contains some exaggerations and embellishments to fill in the gaps in the history.\nThe army of Austria, approximately 100,000 strong, was setting up camp around the town. The army's vanguard, a contingent of hussars, crossed the Timiș River to scout for the presence of the Ottoman army. There was no sign of the Ottoman forces, but the hussars came across a group of Romani people, who offered to sell schnapps to the weary soldiers.\nSoon afterwards, some infantry crossed the river. When they saw the party going on, the infantrymen demanded alcohol for themselves. The hussars refused to give them any of the schnapps and, still drunk, set up makeshift fortifications around the barrels. A heated argument ensued, and one soldier fired a shot.\nImmediately, the hussars and infantry engaged in combat with one another. During the conflict, some Romanian infantry began shouting, \"Turcii! Turcii!\" (\"Turks! Turks!\"). The hussars fled the scene, thinking that the Ottoman army's attack was imminent. Most of the infantry also ran away; the army comprised Austrians, Romanians, Serbs from the military frontier, Croats, and Italians from Lombardy, as well as other minorities, many of whom could not understand one another. While it is not clear which one of these groups did so, they gave the false warning without telling the others, who promptly fled. The situation was made worse when officers, in an attempt to restore order, shouted, \"Halt! Halt!\" which was misheard by soldiers with no knowledge of German as \"Allah! Allah!\".\nAs the hussars fled through the camps, a corps commander, General of Artillery Colloredo, thought that it was a cavalry charge by the Ottoman army and ordered artillery fire. Meanwhile, the entire camp awoke to the sound of battle. The panic caused by the incident demoralised the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II to the point that he ordered the army to withdraw.\nTwo days later, the Ottoman army arrived. They discovered dead and wounded soldiers and easily took Karánsebes.\nLosses\nIn determining losses, accounts of this incident do not distinguish between losses that were caused by friendly fire, those that were caused by the Turks, and those that resulted from pillaging by the Austrians or by the local Wallachians. One account states that the Austrian rear guard suffered 150 casualties. Another account states that in the days following the incident, 1,000 wounded men were taken to the fortress at Arad,  north of Timișoara. Another source claims that 538 men, 24 jäger, and one officer went missing after the incident, but most returned to duty. Also lost were 3 cannons and the chest containing the army's payroll. However, secondary sources give much larger estimates as to the losses of the Austrians.\nIn his account of the incident, Paul Bernard, author of a 1968 biography of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, made an uncited claim that the friendly fire incident caused 10,000 casualties. Although Bernard's account of the war has been dismissed as inaccurate by some sources, they do not specifically touch upon the reliability of the figure of 10,000. Nevertheless, Bernard's claim of 10,000 casualties has been repeated by some historians, such as Geoffrey Regan and Micheal Clodfelter.\nAlthough tens of thousands of casualties occurred within the Austrians' ranks during the course of the 1788 campaign against the Turks, official Austrian reports state that the vast majority of the casualties were the result of disease, particularly malaria and dysentery.In [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015062372241;view=1up;seq=9 \"Geschichte des Feldzugs 1788 der k.k.
