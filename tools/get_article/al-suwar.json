In 2004, there were 5297 inhabitants.\nHistory\nIn the past, most scholars identified al-Suwar with Suru (Su-ú-ru), the capital city of Aramean state Bit-Halupe at the time of Tukulti-Ninurta II; however, Suru is now generally identified with nearby Tell Fiden instead. Edward Lipinski instead identified al-Suwar with the town of *Ṣūriḫ or *Ṣuwariḫ (Ṣú-ú-ri-iḫ), the first town mentioned  by the king Adad-nirari II in the province of Laqe on the Khabur river.\nCivil war\nDuring the Syrian Civil War, the town fell under ISIL occupation until it was liberated by U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces during an offensive in September 2017.\nReferences"
