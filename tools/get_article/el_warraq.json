The institute employs elite researchers, including doctors, biologists, pharmacists, and chemists. It includes departments for liver diseases, endoscopy, urology surgery, intensive care, radiology, and outpatient clinics. The German government contributed to its equipment. The laboratories and outpatient clinics were inaugurated in 1976, and the hospital fully opened in 1983.\nAl-Warraq also features the new Al-Warraq Central Hospital. The outpatient clinic was inaugurated in a ceremony attended by the Governor and the Minister of Health. It cost 4.5 million Egyptian pounds. The district includes several health units, such as the Advanced Health Unit in Waraq al-Hadar (recently equipped with advanced radiology and a complete dental unit), the Health Unit in Waraq al-Arab (equipped with a sonar device), the Health Unit on Warraq Island, and the one in Geziret Mohamed. The district is also home to the Environmental Research Center under the Ministry of Health, the Waraq al-Hadar Comprehensive Medical Center, and dozens of clinics and private hospitals like Al-Nile Specialist Hospital, Al-Rahma Hospital, Al-Fayrouz Hospital, Al-Hekma Hospital, Tabarak Children’s Hospital, Dr. Moqbel Maternity Hospital, Malik Al-Salam Surgical Hospital, Al-Noor Al-Mohammadi Hospital, and Abu Nabil Surgical Hospital.\nJust 2 km from Al-Warraq are other major medical institutions such as Imbaba Fever Hospital, Tahrir General Hospital, Imbaba General Hospital, the National Heart Institute, the Hearing and Speech Institute, Imbaba Eye Hospital, the Institute of Chest and Allergy Research, and the Institute of Neurology and Motor Disorders. Al-Warraq also has branches of Egypt’s top diagnostic labs such as Al-Borg and Saridar, and more than 100 pharmacies.\nOther key landmarks include the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources and the Egyptian Natural Gas Company (GASCO), which supplies gas to Cairo and Giza. All homes in Al-Warraq have been connected to natural gas. Also located in Al-Warraq is the massive Al-Warraq Water Plant, which produces 1.2 million cubic meters of water per day, supplying all of Giza up to Remaya Square in the south and Awsim in the north. Water network renovations are ongoing throughout Al-Warraq.\nThe district houses the headquarters of the Holding Company for Water and Wastewater in Giza and a major sewage treatment plant, part of a modern sewage network built in 1990 under the supervision of American experts, serving all northern Giza regions. Recently, the Minister of Transport inaugurated the Tannash land port in Al-Warraq, used for transporting goods between Cairo and Alexandria.\nThe industrial area of Tannash in Al-Warraq hosts several major factories, including Nasr Castings Factory, Barzi Factory, Mostafa Ali Factory, Olympic Factory, Nasr Pipes Company, Karnak Tile Factory, and Trex Paints Factory, as well as the former Chair Factory.\nAl-Warraq has a police station, a public high school, and an experimental language school (Al-Olaya School), ten primary schools, five preparatory schools, and several under construction, including Nour Al-Maaref Primary School near Marjan School, Al-Shorouk Secondary School, and Al-Sadat Primary School near the Sidi Abdel Aziz School Complex.

The district also has international schools, including the French school \"École Terre Verte\" and the English school \"Nile Kangaroo School,\" as well as a hospitality and computing school, the Orman Hotel and Computer School.\nAl-Warraq has more than 100 mosques and prayer halls. Historically, it is said that the origin of the Waraq al-Arab neighborhood traces back to a group of the Prophet Muhammad’s companions who came to Egypt in 21 AH (circa 642 CE) with Amr ibn al-As. Some of them settled in the area due to its fertile land on the Nile’s bank, leading to the numerous religious shrines in Waraq al-Arab.\nAl-Warraq takes pride in being the birthplace of Sheikh Muhammad Abu al-Fadl al-Gizawi, who served as Grand Imam of Al-Azhar from 1917 to 1927.\nWarraq Island\nGeography\nWarraq Island is an island of area , located in the Giza Governorate. About 3% of the area is government owned.\nPopulation\nIn 2017, the population of Warraq Island was about  to .\n2017 Warraq Island protests\nAccording to Yahia el-Mahgraby, who was head of the local council of Warraq Island for 17 years, conflict between Warraq islanders and Egyptian national authorities date back to 1998 during the Atef Ebeid prime ministership, when Ebeid issued a decree declaring Warraq and other Nile islands as nature reserves, and in 2001 issued decree 542 declaring Warraq and another island, Dahab, to be expropriated for public use. Ebeid's cabinet claimed that Warraq and Dahab did not exist prior to the construction of the Aswan Dam. The islanders protested against the 2001 decree and took legal action against the government, winning their case in 2002.\nIn May 2017, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced a campaign for the state to recover state-owned land that was illegally occupied. In July, a rumour circulated that residents' houses on Warraq Island would be demolished and replaced by investment projects. Member of Parliament (MP) for Warraq Island Ahmed Youssef stated that 700 \"enroachments\" and 160 squatted homes were to be removed. Another Warraq Island MP, Mahmoud el-Saeedy, stated that insufficient communication between residents and security forces occurred. On 16 July 2017, security forces and construction equipment appeared on Warraq Island. Security forces and residents fought, with the death of a 23-year old, 24 injuries and 9 arrests. Warraq Island resident Mohamed Arafa stated that during the conflict on 16 July, \"furnished houses were demolished and some residents were kicked out of their homes.\nDuring the 16 July demolition, resident Heba Nagaa Otmorsi's house was demolished without warning while she was at work on the mainland. The demolition crews and security forces arrived early in the morning when \"most families\" were asleep. As a result of the protests by the islanders, only 9 buildings were demolished.\nThe Guardian reported on a 2010 plan to transform Warraq Island into \"'Horus Island', complete with glossy towers, wide boulevards and a marina\" and a 2013 proposal that included \"a glass skyscraper, a glistening glass pyramid, and manicured riverside walkways\" for restructuring the island. The plans retained in 2017 included the construction of a bridge, which The Guardian suggested was the first step in a similar plan for a major transformation of the whole island.\nWarraq Island residents continued to protest during the week following the demolition.\n}}"
