It is situated near the Dwarka ISBT to the west and the Bijwasan railway station of the Indian Railways network to the east.\nHistory\nThis station, along with Dwarka Sector 8, was constructed as an extension to bolster connectivity provisions for Dwarka residents and facilitate interchange with the Delhi Airport Express Line. Designed by Absolute Architecture, it was inaugurated on October 30, 2010, following successful trials and approval from the railway inspector.\nPassenger facilities\nThis station has the platform screen doors on the Airport Express line.\nIn addition to functioning as a major interchange station for the Delhi Metro, the upper levels of the building have been rented out and converted into a mall, known as Pacific D21 Mall. The building comprises the station on the underground levels, while the ground floor and the two upper levels house commercial activities, with portions rented out to the mall. Notably, it is the first Delhi Metro station to include hotel rooms within its complex.\nAs of August 2014, Dwarka Sector 21 Metro station hosted the largest rooftop solar plant in the city, with an installed capacity of 500 kW, generating sufficient power to meet all its operational needs.\nStation Layout\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\"\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"30\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\" |G\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"85\" style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Street level\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"500\" style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Exit/Entrance\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |L1\n| valign=\"top\" |Mezzanine\n| valign=\"top\" |Fare control, station agent, Metro Card vending machines, crossover\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" valign=\"top\" width=\"30\" style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |L2\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" |Side platform\n|-\n| width=\"85\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Platform 2Eastbound\n| width=\"500\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Towards → Noida Electronic City / VaishaliNext Station: Dwarka Sector 8\n|-\n|Platform 1Westbound\n|Towards ← Train Terminates Here\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" |Island platformP1 & P3 doors will open on the left\n|-\n| width=\"85\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Platform 3Southbound\n| width=\"500\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Towards → New DelhiNext Station: IGI Airport\n|-\n|Platform 4Northbound\n|Towards ← Yashobhoomi Dwarka Sector - 25\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" |Side platform\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"30\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |L2\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"85\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |\n| width=\"500\" style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |\n|}\nConnectivity\nThe Dwarka Interstate Bus Terminus, spanning 27 acres opposite Dwarka Sector 21 Metro station, began construction in 2022. Designed to handle 150,000 passengers daily, it will feature air-conditioned waiting halls, washrooms, airport-style lounges, a five-star hotel, multilevel parking, and a designated taxi zone. Serving buses from Punjab and Haryana, it aims to decongest the Kashmere Gate and Sarai Kale Khan ISBTs.\nBijwasan railway station has been upgraded to serve as a major railway hub for the Indira Gandhi International Airport in its vicinity.\nSee also\n* Transport in Delhi\nReferences"
