Street, a classical contemporary saxophonist. She is a former member of Juno-nominated reggae group Souljah Fyah. She picked the name King of Foxes because she liked that foxes are \"both the hunter and the hunted. That's the image that stuck with me, something that's both fierce and fragile.\" King of Foxes’ music has been described as indie rock, and as \"rock and roll with a side of pop.\"\nDiscography\n* 2016 – Golden Armour (Self Released)\n* 2019 – Salt & Honey (Self Released)\n* 2022 – Twilight of the Empire (Crystal Baby Music)\nMembers\nCurrent members\n* Olivia Street – vocals, guitar (2013–present)\nAssociated members/performers\n* Stew Kirkwood\n* Brandon Baker\n* Tony Bao\n* Greg Kolodychuk\n* Alexis Alchorn\n* Reid Thiel\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
