He was educated at Milton Abbey and Trinity College, Oxford, where he graduated BA. He became an insurance broker before succeeding his father in the marquessate and its subsidiary titles, and also as Hereditary Chamberlain of Dunfermline.\nHe rarely spoke in the House of Lords, but achieved fleeting prominence during the Bosnian War debate on 28 October 1996 and in a subsequent letter to The Times on the subject.\nTweeddale died unmarried on 1 February 2005, aged 57, and was succeeded by his younger twin brother Lord Charles Hay, thus becoming one of the few British peers to be succeeded by a younger twin. The next heir is their youngest brother Lord Alistair Hay, styled Master of Tweeddale as heir presumptive.\nSince none of the three brothers, the sons of the 12th Marquess's first marriage, married, the next in succession are their two half-brothers, sons of the 12th Marquess's second marriage. The two half-brothers are also twins, but the older of the two, Lord Andrew Arthur George Hay, is the only one to be married with children.\nTwin brothers succeeding as peers\nThe 13th Marquess is remembered chiefly for being one of the few British peers to be succeeded by a younger twin brother. Others include\n* the third (1855–1928) and fourth Earls of Durham (1855–1929);\n* the second (1855–1931) and third (1855–1935) Viscounts Knutsford.\nAlthough the 3rd Marquess of Linlithgow and the 1st Baron Glendevon (formerly Lord John Hope) were twins, both were succeeded by their sons.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo961028/text/61028-10.htm Lord Tweeddale spoke on the Bosnian war] in the House of Lords debate."
