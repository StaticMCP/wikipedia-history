It features American singer Gwen Stefani, marking their first collaboration. The song is the second single released from the soundtrack, after Eminem's \"Phenomenal\" which was released a month earlier. \"Kings Never Die\" also marks Stefani's first featured single since 2005's \"Can I Have It Like That\" with Pharrell Williams. The song was co-written and produced by the New Royales.\nBackground and release\nShady Records and Eminem were approached by Kurt Sutter and asked to executively produce a soundtrack for the 2015 film, Southpaw.

The song was officially released on July 10, when the audio track was uploaded to YouTube. On July 29, the lyric video was uploaded to YouTube. This song talks about him (Eminem) being a king of rap and many people urging him to retire. Eminem says that he won't retire and will stay a king.\nCritical reception\nOn July 3, 2015, the full song leaked onto the internet, followed by a positive response from critics. Lars Brandle from Billboard Magazine stated that the song \"is a muscular effort with a classic angry vibe, [but] it's hardly a knockout [and] absolutely worth a spin.\" Rap-Up Magazine thought that the song was a \"triumphant rap-rock hybrid with rapid-fire rhymes.\nCommercial performance\n\"Kings Never Die\" was the highest-ranking debut for the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated August 1, 2015, entering the chart at number 80. Its chart debut was supported by first-week digital download sales of 35,000 copies, along with 1.2 million domestic streams.\nTrack listing\n;Digital download\n| extra1        = }}}} Gwen Stefani's vocal produced and engineered by Mischke\n| length1       =\n}}\n;Notes\n*}} signifies an additional producer.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance for \"Kings Never Die\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 62\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia Urban Singles (ARIA)\n| 9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada (Canadian Hot 100)\n| 51\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Korean International Downloads (Gaon)\n| 30\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard)\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Rap Songs (Billboard)\n| 19\n|}\nCertifications\n}}\nReferences"
