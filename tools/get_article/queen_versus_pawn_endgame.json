However, if the pawn has advanced to its seventh rank it has possibilities of reaching a draw, and there are some drawn positions with the pawn on the sixth rank. This endgame arises most often from a race of pawns to promote.\nThe side with the queen is the attacker and the side with the pawn the defender. Assume that the attacker has the move.\nIf the pawn is not beyond its sixth rank, the attacker (to move) usually wins easily, but there are a few exceptions. The winning process is to either get the queen on a square in front of the pawn and moving the king over to help win the pawn or to check the defending king until it is forced in front of the pawn and using that tempo to bring the attacking king closer, until it can assist in winning the pawn. After the pawn is won, the attacker has an elementary checkmate.\nQueen versus a pawn on the sixth rank\nThe queen usually wins easily if the pawn is on the sixth rank. In the first position, Black is to move, but White wins.\n: 1... Kg2\n: 2. Qg4+ Kf2\n: 3. Kb7 Ke3\nIf Black plays 3...Ke2, White replies 4.Qe4+, forcing Black's king back in front of the pawn, and then advances his own king.\n: 4. Kc6 f2\n: 5. Qd1 Kf4\n: 6. Qf1 and White wins.\nExceptions\nExceptions can occur when the king blocks the queen on a file or diagonal, as in this position.\n: 1. Qh1+ Kb2!\nWhite needs to pin the pawn by 2. Qh8, but the king blocks the pin.\n:2. Qb7+\nThis was White's only check which prevents the pawn from advancing, and Black responds\n:2... Kc1!\nrepeating the position. If the white king is anywhere else (other than g7 and h8), the queen can pin the pawn and allow for the queen and then the king to approach.\nExample\nThe biggest problem for a queen versus a pawn on the sixth rank is when its own king gets in the way. In this position, the white king prevents the queen from getting on the a1 to h8 diagonal, to pin the pawn to prevent it from advancing. White actually wins by:\n:1. Qh6!!\nNow if\n: 1... c2\nthen\n:2. Qc1+\nwins. If Black does not advance the pawn then the white queen can maneuver to pin the pawn along the diagonal, and wins easily.\nIf instead, White tries what may seem to be correct:\n:1. Qh1+?\na draw results with correct play (but there are many chances for losing moves).\n:1... Kb2! (1...Ka2 loses quickly to Qc1.)\n:2. Qb7+ (otherwise 2...c2 draws.)\n:2... Kc1!\n:3. Kf6! (White tries his best chance.)\n:3... c2\n:4. Ke5 Kd2\n:5. Qd5+!\nBlack has five replies. Four of them lose, but\n:5... Ke1! draws.\n:6. Qa5+ Kd1 (6...Ke2 loses to 7.Qa2.)\n:7. Qa4 Kd2 (7...Kc1 loses to 8.Qa2.)\n:8. Qa2 Kc3!!\nand White can make no progress.\nExample from game\nQ\n}}\nIn this 1937 game between Vladimir Alatortsev and Vitaly Chekhover, White wins:\n:71... Ke3\n:72. Qd5 Kf2\nIf 72...Ke2 then 73.Qe4+ Kf2 forces the Black king in front of the pawn.\n:73. Kd7 Kg3\n:74. Ke6 f2\n:75. Qh1! 1–0\nQueen versus a pawn on the seventh rank\nIn order for the defending side to have a chance at a draw (with the other side to move), the pawn must be on its seventh rank and the king must be nearby (plus a few drawing positions with the pawn on the sixth rank, as above). Except for unusual cases, the attacking side wins if the pawn is a knight pawn (b- or g-files) or a central pawn (d- or e-files). For bishop pawns and rook pawns, the result also depends on the location of the attacking king. If the attacking king is close enough to the pawn, it wins; otherwise a draw results.\nFirst note that the attacker may win easily, depending on the location of the kings. In this position, White wins by 1. Qg5! followed by 2. Qc1, and then the white king is brought nearer to win the pawn. If the black king is on any other square around the pawn, the position is a draw, see below (position modified slightly).\nCentral pawn or knight pawn\nIf the pawn is a central pawn or knight pawn (i.e. on the b, d, e, or g-file), the queen wins easily, except for a few unusual positions. In the position on the right, White wins. It takes several moves, but it is not difficult.\n: 1... Ke3\nBlack threatens to queen the pawn. White prevents this by forcing the black king in front of the pawn.\n: 2. Qh4 Kd2 3. Qd4+ Kc2 4. Qe3 Kd1 5. Qd3+ Ke1\nWithout the immediate threat of promotion, White has gained a tempo that can be used to bring his king closer. This process is repeated.\n: 6. Kc6 Kf2 7. Qd2 Kf1 8. Qf4+ Kg1 9. Qe3+ Kf1 10. Qf3+ Ke1\nAnd now White can again bring his king closer.\n: 11. Kd5 Kd2 12. Qf2 Kd1 13. Qd4+ Kc2 14. Qe3 Kd1 15. Qd3+ Ke1 16. Ke4! Kf2 17. Qf3+ Ke1 18. Kd3\nand White wins the pawn and then checkmates. The winning process with a knight pawn is the same.\nIn some cases, the attacking king can block its own queen, as in the second diagram. If the white king is on d5, d6 or d7, the queen cannot approach the pawn, and the result is a draw.\nRook pawn\nThe process above does not work against a rook pawn. The reason is that when the king was forced in front of his pawn in other locations, he could move out the other side on the next move. With a rook pawn, this file is not available, and there can be a stalemate.\nIn the first position, if the procedure above is tried,\n: 1. Qd4+ Kb1\n: 2. Qb4+ Kc2\n: 3. Qa3 Kb1\n: 4. Qb3+ Ka1!\nand now the position is a stalemate unless White lets the black king back to the b-file. White can make no progress.\nWhite can win similar positions if his king is close enough to the pawn. In the second position, White's king is close enough to win – by allowing the pawn to promote but then checkmating the king. White wins if the king is close enough to move to one of the squares marked with dots in two moves.\n: 1. Qf6+ Kb1 (if 1...Kc2 then 2.Qa1 wins)\n: 2. Qf1+ Kb2\n: 3. Qe2+ Kb1 (3...Kb3 allows 4.Qe5 followed by 5.Qa1)\n: 4. Kc4! a1=Q\n: 5. Kb3\nand White checkmates.\nIf the white king was on e3, the win is simple:\n: 1. Qd2+ Kb1\n: 2. Kd3 a1=Q\n: 3. Qc2#\nBishop pawn\nA bishop pawn may also draw, but for a different reason (a different stalemate position).\n:1. Qb6+ Ka1!\n:2. Qd4+ Kb1\n:3. Qb4+ Ka1\n:4. Qc3+ Kb1\n:5. Qb3+ Ka1!\nand White cannot capture the pawn because stalemate would result. The rule is that White wins if their king is close enough to reach b3 or d2 in one move, because it can assist in checkmate.\nIf the defending king is not on the side of the pawn near the corner and the attacking king is close enough, the game can still be won – often by letting the pawn promote and then checkmating.\nThe second position is a 1763 endgame study by Giambattista Lolli. The black king must be prevented from getting to the other side of his pawn, otherwise he can employ the stalemate defense.\n: 1. Qb3! Kd2\n: 2. Qb2 Kd1\n: 3. Kf3! Kd2 (3...c1=Q 4.Qe2#, or 3...c1=N and White checkmates in three moves: 4.Ke3 Nb3 5.Qc3, and checkmate on the next move.)\n: 4. Kf2 Kd1\n: 5. Qd4+ Kc1\n: 6. Qb4! Black is in zugzwang\n: 6... Kd1\n: 7. Qe1#\nThe third position shows another win for the attacker, since their king is close and the defending king is not (yet) near the corner.\n: 1. Qc4+ Ke1\n: 2. Qe4+ Kf1\n: 3. Kf4 Kg1 (the black king gets to the corner, but White has moved their king close enough to checkmate.)\n: 4. Qd4 Kh1\n: 5. Kg3 (of course not 5. Qxf2 stalemate)\n: 5... f1=Q\n: 6. Qh8+\nand White checkmates in two more moves. Note that it is possible to win against a bishop pawn on the seventh rank and the king in the corner if the attacking king and queen are in the proper position. White wins if the king is close enough to move to one of the squares marked with dots in two moves.\nExample from game\nThis position from a 1996 game between Loek van Wely and Peter Leko was drawn because of the bishop pawn.\nPetrosian versus Fischer\n{| align=\"left\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|+ Petrosian vs. Fischer, 1958\n|\n|\n|}\nThe first position is from the end of a 1958 game between future World Champions Tigran Petrosian and Bobby Fischer. The players agreed to a draw because of the stalemate defense (above). The game could continue 67...Rxg6+ 68.Kxg6 Kb1 69.f8=Q c2 to the second position, which is a draw.\nTraps\nThere are some traps arising in the endgame with the bishop pawn when the attacking king is not quite close enough to force a win. In this position play could go:\n:1. Qb3+ Ka1! 2. Qe3 Kb1 3. Qe4 Kb2\n3...Ka1 also draws.\n:4. Qe2\nSetting the trap, and now\n:4... Ka1!\nis the only move to draw. The alternative move 4...Kb1?? is a typical mistake, allowing 5.Kc4!! c1=Q+ 6.Kb3, winning. If instead 4...Kc3??, then 5.Qe5+!, forcing the black king to the wrong side of the pawn and then the white king will be close enough to assist.\nThe same trick can be tried with the king on the other side of the pawn. The white king is not close enough to force a win in this position, but the defense is difficult.\n:1. Qb2 Kd1 2. Qb3 Kd2 3. Qa2!?\nSetting the trap.\n:3... Kc3!\nThe only move to draw.\n:4. Qa1+ Kd2, draw\nIf instead 3...Kd1??, then 4.Kd4! c1=Q 5.Kd3 wins. If 3...Kd3??, then 4.Qb2 and Black has to allow a pin to avoid 5.Qc1. After 4...Kd2 the white king gets close enough to win with 5.Ke4.\nExtra pawn for the defense\nAn extra pawn for the defense may be a disadvantage because it deprives the defender of the stalemate defense. In this position, White wins:\n:1. Qg4+ Kh2\n:2. Qf3! Kg1\n:3. Qg3+! Kf1\n3...Kh1 loses after 4.Qxf2. If black did not have the extra pawn, this would be stalemate instead.\n:4. Kc4\nand White wins.\nSee also\n* Chess endgame\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEypLNcdjOY On Youtube, video from \"Chessnetwork\", Explanation + Quiz, 48 min]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipR0Rn9S_-k On Youtube, video by Jonathan Schrantz from Saint Louis Chess Club's Channel, 52 min]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji8NjJknEjY On Youtube, video by \"Hanging Pawns\", 17 min]"
