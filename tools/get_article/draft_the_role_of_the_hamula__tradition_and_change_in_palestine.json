These kinship groups were structured around systems of loyalty, honor, and lineage, regulating aspects of life such as marriage, inheritance, and conflict resolution. Leadership within the hamula was typically vested in elders or sheikhs, who mediated disputes and represented the group in interactions with tribal authorities, village councils, or colonial administrations.\nThe traditional hamula system experienced significant disruption following the 1948 Nakba, during which over 700,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homes. The destruction or depopulation of entire villages led to the collapse of localized communal structures that had supported hamula authority. Displaced populations were often relocated to urban areas or refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and neighboring Arab states, where traditional kinship ties weakened or transformed. . In these new environments, alternative social networks emerged, often organized around shared geographic origin, professional association, neighborhood cohesion, or political affiliation. National movements such as Fatah, Hamas, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) became key frameworks for identity and organization.\nThe processes of globalization, labor migration, and modernization introduced further shifts in Palestinian family dynamics. Migration to regions such as the Americas, Europe, and the Gulf reduced dependence on traditional family structures. Urbanization, expanded access to higher education, and exposure to global media challenged patriarchal norms and contributed to changing gender roles. The increasing participation of women in the workforce and public life, along with younger generations’ pursuit of personal autonomy, further diversified social organization.\nDespite these changes, the hamula system has persisted in various forms. In rural areas and smaller towns, it continues to exert influence over marriage practices, local elections, and tribal mediation, particularly through the sulha, a traditional reconciliation process. Even among dispersed or displaced communities, hamula affiliation remains a source of social capital, identity, and communal support. Although the structure and function of Palestinian kinship networks have been significantly transformed, they have not disappeared; rather, they have adapted to the demands of contemporary political, social, and economic realities.\nReferences\n1.
