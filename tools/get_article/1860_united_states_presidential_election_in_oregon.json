Oregon voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nOregon voted in its first ever presidential election, having become the 33rd state on February 14, 1859. The state was won by the Republican nominee, Illinois Representative Abraham Lincoln and his running mate Senator Hannibal Hamlin of Maine. They defeated the Southern Democratic nominee 14th Vice President of the United States John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky and his running mate Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon as well as Democratic nominee Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and his running mate 41st Governor of Georgia Herschel V. Johnson. Lincoln won the state by a narrow margin of 1.83%.\nOregon was the only state where the first and second-place finishers matched the first and second place national finishers in the electoral college (Lincoln first, then Breckinridge in second). The large amount of counties voting for Breckenridge can be attributed to Southern sympathies.\nResults\n}}\nResults By County\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+1860 United States Presidential Election in Oregon (By County)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |Abraham Lincoln\nRepublican\n! colspan=\"2\" |John C.
