It opened on April 26, 2019, along with the rest of the G Line, three years after its initially planned October 2016 opening.\nThe station is located in Wheat Ridge, Colorado, United States, on the south side of West 50th Place between Ward Road and Tabor Street. It includes bus bays and a 290-stall park and ride on the north side of West 50th Place. Public art at the station includes \"Anchored by Place\", a steel-and-bronze sculpture by Michael Clapper.\nThe station is the only stop within the city of Wheat Ridge, and is being prepared by the city for transit-oriented development. In 2016, voters in Wheat Ridge approved a $12 million sales tax to improve roadways and other infrastructure around the area to lure development. A  lot northeast of the station is slated to be developed into 230 apartments and 80 townhomes.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.ci.wheatridge.co.us/DocumentCenter/View/26641/Wheat-Ridge-Ward-Station-Vision-Plan Wheat Ridge TOD Vision]"
