It was produced by Content.23 Media, DIGA Studios, and Vox Productions. The nominations were announced live on the official HCA YouTube channel on December 7, 2023.\nThe fantasy comedy Barbie led the nominations with ten, followed by The Holdovers with seven, and Oppenheimer and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse with six each. Barbie ultimately won the most awards with five wins, including Best Picture and Best Actress (Margot Robbie).\nThe live-streamed event was broadcast globally, beginning at 6:30 p.m. PDT/9:30 p.m. EDT; Jimmy O. Yang was originally slated to serve as host, but was replaced by Rick Glassman. The organization also announced a new partnership with ABS-CBN, who served as the global broadcast partner for the HCA Astra Film Awards and HCA Astra TV Awards. Both ceremonies aired in 247 countries and territories in addition to the live-stream on HCA's YouTube channel and KNEKT.tv.\nAdditionally, the Astra Film Creative Arts Awards winners were announced on the same day; the ceremony took place on February 26, 2024, at City Market Social House in Los Angeles.\nCeremony information\nThis year, several months after the Hollywood Critics Association rebranded itself as the Hollywood Creative Alliance (HCA), the organization had given its signature awards shows a new title: \"The Astra Awards\". The decision to rename the awards ceremonies was put to a vote by the HCA's advisory committee on November 17, 2023.\n\"As the Hollywood Creative Alliance expands to include creatives and other industry professionals, we wanted an award name that would be reflective of the newly relaunched organization,\" said HCA CEO Scott Menzel in a statement. \"The name 'Astra' is a perfect award show title evoking celestial brilliance and creative mastery. It encapsulates the collaborative spirit, symbolizing individual stars and elegantly embodies the industry's aspiration, innovation, and distinction. This new name symbolizes unity amongst the diverse and inclusive membership of the Hollywood Creative Alliance.\"\nFurthermore, the HCA announced its collaboration with producer and editor David Sandeep Robert, filmmaker Jason Strickland, and executive producer Leonard Shapiro to drive change and ensure that the work of stunt performers and international actors are acknowledged and celebrated on a global scale. In addition to advocating for stunt performers, the Hollywood Creative Alliance had also announced that it will add three new International categories to the upcoming ceremony: Best International Actor, Best International Actress, and Best International Filmmaker. \"International Cinema is important to so many of us within the HCA, and we have decided to add additional categories that will allow International titles and performers to get more exposure,\" adds HCA Vice Chair Yong Chavez. \"The HCA has always been an organization that has shown great pride in uplifting marginalized voices, and so many International actors are overlooked by awards organizations here in the US.\"\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted with boldface.\n, Best Director winner]]\n, Best Actor winner]]\n, Best Actress co-winner]]\n, Best Actress co-winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actor winner and Best Original Song co-winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Best Original Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Best International Actor winner]]\n, Best International Actress winner]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* 'Barbie (Warner Bros.
