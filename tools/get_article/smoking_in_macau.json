In April 2009 the government announced proposed legislation that sought to raise the tobacco sales tax by 300%. Casinos and gambling are a major aspect of tourism in Macau. Smoking is banned on the main floors of casinos, but is permitted in closed-off ventilated smoking areas, which are located on the casino floors. A majority of Macau residents support a total ban on smoking in public places, but lawmakers in closed session on 20 April 2010 were unable to reach a consensus regarding a total ban inside casinos. The increasing number of smokers is a cause for concern.\nIn 2018 a ban on the sale, advertisement and import of e-cigarettes was implemented in Macau. January 1, 2019 saw the introduction of Macau’s New Tobacco Control Act which extends non-smoking areas across the city including a ban on smoking in the VIP areas of casinos, with smoking now only allowed inside specially ventilated smoking rooms.\nThe overall smoking rate among the Macao population aged 15 years and above decreased from 33.7% in 2011 (upon the implementation of the smoking ban) to 11.2% in 2020.\nSee also\n* Healthcare in Macau\nReferences"
