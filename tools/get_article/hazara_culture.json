The Hazarajat region has an ancient history and was, at different periods, home to the Greco-Buddhists, Ghorids, and Ghaznavids civilizations, later the Mongols and the Timurids. Each of these civilizations left visible imprints on the region's local culture.\nThe Hazaras speak Dari and Hazaragi dialects and varieties of Persian, which is spoken mostly in Afghanistan. The Hazara were traditionally pastoral farmers active in herding in the central and southeastern highlands of Afghanistan. They primarily practice Islam, denominations of Shia with significance of Sunni and some Isma'ili.\nClothing\nHazara clothing plays an important and special role in supporting the traditional, cultural and social identity of Hazaras. Hazara clothes are sewn in most parts of the country, especially in the central provinces of the country.\nCuisine\nHazara cuisine is strongly influenced by the Central Asian, South Asian, and Persian cuisines.\nMusic\nDambura\nMany Hazara musicians are highly skilled in playing the dambura, a local oud instrument found in other Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. Some of the musicians and dambura players are, such as Sarwar Sarkhosh, Dawood Sarkhosh, Safdar Tawakoli, Sayed Anwar Azad, and others.\nSport\nBuzkashi\nBuzkashi is a Central Asian sport in which horse-mounted players attempt to place a goat or calf carcass in a goal.\nIt is the national sport in Afghanistan and is one of the main cultural sports of the Hazara people.\nPehlwani\nGames\n* Tirandazi\nGallery\nFile:The Hazara people of Daykundi in September 20, 2009.jpg|Hazara scouncil in Sept 2009, Daikundi, Afghanistan\nFile:Schoolgirls in Ghazni, Afghanistan in March 8, 2011.jpg|Hazara girls (right) wearing red traditional dress sitting next to Tajik and Pashtun girls in Ghazni, Afghanistan\nFile:Hazara girl.jpg|A Hazara girl in traditional Hazara clothing\nFile:Hazara girl (1).jpg|A Hazara girl in traditional Hazara clothing\nSee also\n* Culture of Afghanistan\nReferences"
