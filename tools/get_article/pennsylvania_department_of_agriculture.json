The lending library, hosted by a town library, allowed gardeners to \"check out\" a package of open-pollinated seed, and \"return\" seeds kept from the crop grown from those seeds. The Department of Agriculture said that this activity raises the possibility of \"agro-terrorism\", and that a Seed Act of 2004 requires the library staff to test each seed packet for germination rate and whether the seed was true to type. In 2016 the department reversed this decision, and clarified that seed libraries and non-commercial seed exchanges are not subject to the requirements of the Seed Act.\nSee also\n* List of Pennsylvania state agencies\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.agriculture.state.pa.us/ Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture]"
