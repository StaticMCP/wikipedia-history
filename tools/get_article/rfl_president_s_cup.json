It was previously known as the ''RFL Association's Cup.\nHistory\nThe RFL Associations Cup'' was founded in 2014 following the previous year's Rugby League Festival Of World Cups (the series of Rugby League World Cups for women, wheelchair, police, armed forces and students) with a view to better preparing each of the competing British entries ahead of their inclusion in future World Cups.\nSpeaking at the launch of the competition, David Gent, the RFL's Director of Participation stated \"This competition is about a regular fixed competition for these associations, but it is vital we support these squads in their attempts to win their respective World Cups.\"\nAdditional benefits for the women's team would be to give  selectors the opportunity to scout players from all sections of the women's game, to create higher intensity fixtures than the domestic competition at the time provided and to select players to the national women's squad.\nThe first season saw the men's competition involving Great Britain Students, Great Britain Armed Forces, Great Britain Teachers and Great Britain Police and the women's competition featuring England Students, Great Britain Armed Forces, Great Britain Teachers and The Lionesses - a team made up of players from the women's domestic league who were not eligible for any of the other three teams.\nIn 2015 England Universities replaced Great Britain Students in the men's competition following the movement of the Student Rugby League Four Nations Competition from the Easter period to a summer slot.\nNo men's or women's competition took place in 2017 owing to teams participating in the Festival of World Cups in Australia. During this year, Great Britain Armed Forces re-branded to become UK Armed Forces.\nFor the 2018 season, the competition was renamed ''RFL President's Cup.''  The women's competition was discontinued following the RFL revamping the international player pathway process and introducing a National Performance Programme with a focus on talent identification, player skill development, physical competences and the creation of a performance coaching environment in advance of the RFL opening a National Rugby League Centre in Manchester which will provide facilities for the England Women's team to train at. An Origin Game was also introduced to recreate international competition to develop the elite players.\nThe 2020 and 2021 seasons were cancelled as a result of the Covid-19 global pandemic, but the competition returned in 2022 which also saw the return of a women's competition, this time for only 3 teams; England Students, Great Britain Teachers and UK Armed Forces.\nFormat\nEach team plays each other once in a single round-robin competition, with the team finishing at the top of the league table being crowned champions.\nCompetition points are scored as follows:\n* Win: 2 points\n* Draw: 1 point\n* Loss: 0 points\n* Default on game: 0 points (with 24-0 score-line awarded to the opposition).\nWhere teams are tied on competition points, points difference (the cumulative number of points scored in all games minus the cumulative number of points conceded in all games) is used to determine league positions.\nThe Pankhurst Trophy, previously played for annually and awarded to the winner of the England Students v UK Armed Forces women's game, continues to be awarded to the winner of the fixture.\nMen's Competition\n2022 season\nThe fixtures for the 2022 season are:\n{| style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" border=\"1\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#C1D8FF\"\n!
