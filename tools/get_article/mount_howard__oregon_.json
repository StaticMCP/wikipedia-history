Mount Howard was named for Civil War general Oliver O. Howard.\nThe  Mount Howard-East Peak area was designated as a National Natural Landmark in June 2016, in recognition of its botanically diverse montane grassland habitats and populations of endemic and rare plant species.\nSee also\n*List of National Natural Landmarks in Oregon\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/regions/Pacific_Northwest/MtHoward/index.shtml US Forest Service: Mt.
