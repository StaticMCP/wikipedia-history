However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, though some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nSecond Air Force\n* Corvallis AAF, Corvallis\n: II Fighter Command\n: Also known as MAAS Corvallis / MCAAF Corvalis (temp transfer to US Navy/US Marine Corps)\n: Now: Corvallis Municipal Airport\n* Portland AAB, Portland\n: 44th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Portland International Airport and  Portland Air National Guard Base\n: Joint use AAF/Navy/Civil Airport\n* Redmond AAF, Redmond\n: Sub-base of Portland AAF\n: Now: Roberts Field Airport\n::: Also several auxiliary fields (Aurora Flight Strip, Eugene Municipal Airport)\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Madras AAF, Madras\n: Now: Madras Municipal Airport (was City-County Airport)\n* Medford AAF, Medford\n: Joint use with US Navy\n: Now: Medford Jackson County Airport\n* Pendleton Field AAF, Pendleton\n: Spokane Air Service Command\n: 470th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Joint use with US Navy\n: Now: Pendleton Regional Airport\n* Salem AAF, Salem\n: Now: McNary Field Airport\nSee also\n* Lists of Oregon-related topics\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
