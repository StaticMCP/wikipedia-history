All the songs dealt mostly with epic stories, immortal warriors, and personal experiences. Both members were later expelled from Avalanch, due to be working on a project behind the band's back. They decided create a band as they already had an \"open path\". The album was produced by themselves; recorded, mixed, and edited in Jaus Records, with cover and graphic design by Ricardo Menéndez (represented by Rick-Art). García handled lead vocal duties, primary lyricist, main songwriter, bassist, rhythm guitarist, and keyboardist, but received the collaboration of Pablo García and Fernando Mon on the guitar solos, who later became full-time members, along with bassist Alvaro Jardón. Jardón didn't work on the album as it had already been recorded. In search of a keyboardist, the band conducted auditions from June 22 to August 12, 2002, recruiting Manuel Ramil. WarCry kept working in a new album before giving a tour, in order to have enough songs to choose from.\nJapanese rock magazine Karma catalogued WarCry as \"a Spanish album that boosts true metal!\". Kerrang! said it was a \"very good debut from a very good band that has pleasantly surprised everyone\". Rock magazine HeavyRock stated that WarCry was \"giving Avalanch a hard time\". Spanish music critic Rafa Basa said \"WarCry is national [Spain] heavy metal, powerful, direct, and convincing!\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n*Víctor García – vocals, bass, guitars, keyboards\n*Alberto Ardines – drums\n*Fernando Mon – guitar solos\n*Pablo García – guitar solos\nProduction\n* David de la Torre – mastering\n* Ricardo Menéndez – design\n* Romi – photos\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.warcry.as WarCry] – official website\n* [http://www.myspace.com/warcrymetal WarCry] at MySpace"
