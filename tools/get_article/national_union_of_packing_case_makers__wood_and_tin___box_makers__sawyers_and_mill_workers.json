It initially focused on providing benefits for members who were out of work, and attempting to negotiate minimum wage rates for the industry.  Its membership remained small for many years, peaking at 521 in 1890, but dropping to only 192 in 1910.  That decade, it broadened its remit, adopting its final name, and membership began increasing, reaching 5,038 in 1948.\nBy the 1960s, membership of the union was again falling, dropping to 3,408 in 1964.  The following year, it decided to merge into the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers.\nGeneral Secretaries\n: E. Hammond\n:1923: R. James\n:1927: A. Sawyer\n:1934: R. James\n:1952: S. G.
