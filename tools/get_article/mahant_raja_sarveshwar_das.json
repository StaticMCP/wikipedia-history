He succeeded to the throne of Nandgaon State in 1927 after the death of Mahant Raja Rajendra Das.\nIt was a convoluted succession. Mahant Raja Balram Das had died childless, at which time his widow, queen Suryamukhi, adopted Rajendra Das as her son and the next ruler of Nandgaon. The adoptee died soon after and Shyamcharan, father of Sarveshwar Das, was selected to be the next ruler of Nandgaon by family members and disciples. But he was so old that he was not able to govern and Sarveshwar Das became de facto ruler.\nPersonal life\nHe married Jayanti Devi, princess of Mayurbhanj State, in 1932. He  died on 18 September 1940.\nReferences"
