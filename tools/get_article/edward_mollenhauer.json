He studied under Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst and Louis Spohr, and had become famous in Germany and at Saint Petersburg before he was twenty-five years old. To escape conscription, he went to England, where he met conductor Louis-Antoine Jullien, and accompanied him to New York City in 1853. He settled there and became a founder in America of the Conservatory method of teaching the violin. Mollenhauer's best-known compositions for the violin are his quartets. He also wrote the operas, The Corsican Bride (1861), Love among the Breakers (also known as Down among the Breakers; 1878), and The Masked Ball (also known as The Wager; 1879).  He soloed with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for six years. He also created 2 pieces for violin with piano accompaniment, \"The Boy Paganini\" and \"The Infant Paganini\" both are still played worldwide. Among those he taught were African-American soloist and orchestra director, Walter F. Craig.\nSee also\n*List of string quartet composers\nReferences\nAttribution\n*"
