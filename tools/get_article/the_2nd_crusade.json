      "text": "# The 2nd Crusade\n\nThe 2nd Crusade is a studio album by The Crusaders, released in 1972 on Blue Thumb Records. The album peaked at No. 1 on the US Billboard Top Jazz LPs and No. 4 on the US Billboard Top Soul LPs chart and No. 45 on the US Billboard Top LPs and Tape.\nCritical reception\n}}\nAllMusic's Thom Jurek, in a 4.5/5 star review, exclaimed \"Given the critical and commercial success of 1 and their rebirth as the \"Crusaders,\" the band decided to follow up the previous LP's double length with another one! There are 13 tunes here, all extrapolating the band's previously held notions of soul-jazz and hard bop as they emerged into the new funky '70s...or the most part, the tunes are shorter here and rely far more heavily on groove aesthetics rather than jazz syncopations... But make no mistake: this is a jazz record with greasy funk at its core, not a jazzy funk record.\"\nAccolades\nThe 2nd Crusade earned a Grammy nomination in the category of Best R&B Instrumental Performance.\nTrack listing\nAdapted from album's text.\nCredits\n*Engineer – Rik Pekkonen\n*Guitar – Arthur Adams, David T.
