Bush on 12 March 2003, through Executive Order 13289. The medal recognizes those military service members who have deployed overseas in direct service to the war on terror from 11 September 2001 to a date to be determined. Prior to 30 April 2005, the medal was awarded for service within Iraq and Afghanistan, but has been replaced with the Iraq Campaign Medal and Afghanistan Campaign Medal and serves primarily as recognition for personnel who have deployed in support of the war on terror to locations beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. In a similar fashion the Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal is issued for service in the fight against ISIS, with eligibility retroactive to 15 June 2014.\nThe War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal was designed by John Sproston of the Army's Institute of Heraldry.\nOperations and devices\nThe following are the approved operations and respective dates for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (retroactive to 11 September 2001)\nNote: Enduring Freedom name is still in operational use today for deployments to the Middle East, OEF encompasses Operation JUNIPER SHIELD, OCTAVE SHIELD and SPARTAN SHIELD.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Operation\n!From\n!To\n|-\n| Enduring Freedom (OEF)\n| 11 September 2001\n| TBD\n|-\n| Iraqi Freedom (OIF)\n| 19 March 2003\n| 31 August 2010\n|-\n| Nomad Shadow (ONS)\n| 5 November 2007\n| TBD\n|-\n| New Dawn (OND)\n| 1 September 2010\n| 31 December 2011\n|-\n| Observant Compass (OOC)\n| 1 October 2011\n| 30 September 2017\n|-\n| Counterterrorism EXORD - AFRICOM (USAFRICOM CT EXORD)\n| 6 September 2012\n| TBD\n|-\n| Inherent Resolve (OIR)\n| 15 June 2014\n| TBD\n|-\n| Freedom's Sentinel (OFS)\n| 1 January 2015\n| 31 August 2021\n|-\n| Odyssey Lightning (OOL)\n| 1 August 2016\n| 17 January 2017\n|-\n| Operation Pacific Eagle (OPE-P)\n| 5 October 2017\n| TBD\n|-\n| Operation Enduring Sentinel (OES)\n| 1 September 2021\n| TBD\n|-\n| Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG)\n| 18 December 2023\n| TBD\n|-\n| Operation Poseidon Archer (OPA)\n| 18 January 2024\n| TBD\n|-\n| Operation Pandora Throttle (OPT)\n| 13 May 2024\n| TBD\n|}\nExamples of campaign stars worn on the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal service ribbon:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|  || Any one of the nine operations\n|-\n|  || Two of the nine operations\n|-\n|  || Three of the nine operations\n|-\n|  || Four of the nine operations\n|-\n|  || Five of the nine operations\n|-\n|  || Six of the nine operations\n|-\n|  || Seven of the nine operations\n|-\n|  || Eight of the nine operations\n|-\n|  || All nine operations\n|}\nThe following ribbon devices are authorized for wear on the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal:\n*  Campaign stars (all branches)\n*  Arrowhead device (Army, Air Force, and Space Force)\n*  Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia (Navy personnel assigned to a Marine Corps unit in combat)\nCriteria\nTo be awarded the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal a military service member must perform duty in a deployed status and must participate in designated anti-terrorism operation for a period of either 30 consecutive or 60 non-consecutive days of duty. For those who were engaged in combat, killed, or wounded in the line of duty, the time requirement is waived. The term \"deployed status\" indicates either temporary or permanent orders to a duty station outside the borders of the United States of America with such duty being in direct support of anti-terrorism operations. For a service member to receive the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the deployment must also have taken place in a nation which is currently recognized as a base for anti-terrorism operations by the United States Department of Defense.\nOn 30 April 2005, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal was discontinued for service within Iraq and Afghanistan, with such service recognized with the Iraq Campaign Medal or Afghanistan Campaign Medal.  Personnel who received the GWOT-EM for previous service in these two regions may elect to exchange the GWOT-EM or retain the original award.\nOn 9 February 2015, the Defense Department authorized service stars to be worn on the GWOT-EM to represent different operations the recipient participated in.\nThe GWOT-EM is a Defense Department expeditionary medal. Award of this medal does not prevent award of other types of recognition (such as decorations) normally associated with deployment. This medal may be awarded posthumously.\nThe Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal may be awarded for approved operations performed in any of the following geographical areas:\nDiscontinued for service in Iraq as of 1 January 2012. Resumed for Operation Inherent Resolve.\n*Israel\n*Italy\n*Jordan\n*Kazakhstan\n*Kenya\n*Kosovo (only specified GWOT operations)\n*Kuwait\n*Kyrgyzstan\n*Lebanon\n*Mali\n*Mauritania\n*Morocco\n*Niger\n*Nigeria\n*Oman\n*Pakistan\n*Philippines\n*Qatar\n*Romania (Constanţa)\n*Rwanda\n*Saudi Arabia\n*Senegal\n*Seychelles\n*Sierra Leone\n*Somalia\n*South Sudan\n*Spain\n*Sudan\n*Syria\n*Tajikistan\n*Tanzania\n*Tunisia\n*Turkey (East of 35 degrees E Longitude)\n*Turkmenistan\n*United Arab Emirates\n*Uzbekistan\n*Yemen}}\nThe following bodies of water are also approved qualifying areas:\n*That portion of the Arabian Sea north of 10 degrees north latitude, and west of 68 degrees east longitude\n*Bab-el-Mandeb\n*Gulf of Aden\n*Gulf of Aqaba\n*Gulf of Oman\n*Gulf of Suez\n*A portion of the Mediterranean Sea (\"boarding and searching operations\") (East of 28 degrees E longitude)\n*Persian Gulf\n*Red Sea\n*Strait of Hormuz\n*Suez Canal\nDevices\nThe Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal may be awarded with the devices:\n* Arrowhead device - For qualified Army and Air Force service members.\n* Service stars - effective 9 February 2015, to recognize individual participation in each of the approved operations that a service member participates in, a  inch bronze service star is worn on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal, with a  inch silver star being worn in lieu of five bronze stars.\n* Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia - for qualified Navy service members such as hospital corpsmen assigned to Marine Corps units that participate in combat during the assignment.\nExpeditionary Medal and Service Medal\nA similar medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (GWOT-SM), was created under the same Presidential Order that authorized the GWOT Expeditionary Medal. The primary difference between the two awards is that the service medal is intended for those who performed support duty within the United States, while the expeditionary medal recognizes those who were deployed to foreign countries. For those participating in multiple operations, both the GWOT Service and GWOT Expeditionary Medal may be authorized, but both medals can no longer be bestowed for the same qualifying period of service. The only exception is for service personnel who served in Iraq or Afghanistan prior to 30 April 2005. These personnel were awarded both the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.\nNotable recipients\n*Phyllis J.
