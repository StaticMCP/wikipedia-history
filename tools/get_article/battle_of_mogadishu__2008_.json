During the fighting for Huriwa the ENDF carried out the Al-Hidaya Mosque Masscare.\nTimeline\nOn 19 April, Somali insurgents ambushed a group of Ethiopian soldiers, who entered an area of Mogadishu on foot, sparking heavy battles. The intense clashes spread out across three districts in the northern quarter of the capital Mogadishu, with Ethiopian troops expanding into insurgent strongholds for the first time in weeks. The initial fighting lasted more than an hour, ending with Ethiopian troops retreating back to their main bases at Mogadishu Stadium and the ex-pasta factory.\nAbdi Rahim Isa Adow, a spokesman for the Islamic insurgents, confirmed that seven militants had been killed but said that \"a large number of Ethiopian soldiers\" had also been killed.
