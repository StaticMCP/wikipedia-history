He had been introduced to mountain climbing at the home in the Alps of his grandfather, Alfred Wills, a well-known mountaineer and president of the Alpine Club (1863–1865).\nMountaineering\nNorton's experience led to his taking part in the British 1922 Everest and 1924 Everest expeditions, reaching high elevations both years. His height of —reached in 1924 without using oxygen on the Great Couloir route—was a world altitude record which stood for nearly 30&nbsp;years, only being surpassed during the unsuccessful Swiss expedition of 1952.\nIn 1924, he took over leadership of the expedition when General Charles Granville Bruce fell ill, and Norton was praised for handling affairs in the aftermath of the disappearance of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine.\nMilitary career\nNorton served at Staff Colleges in India and England, and commanded the Royal Artillery and later the Madras District in the 1930s. He relinquished his appointment of BGS Aldershot Command, and his temporary brigadier's rank, in April 1938.\nFrom 1940 to 1941, he was acting governor and then Commander-in-Chief of Hong Kong.\nHe retired in 1942, after a near fatal riding accident.\nLater years\nFrom 1952 until 1953, he advised John Hunt that previous Everest assault camps had been too low, and in 1953 it should be on or very close under the Southern Summit.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
