LKP's student and professional publishing became an imprint of Quercus and LKP's children's publishing became part of Hachette Children's Group.\nPublications\nLaurence King Publishing has published a number of popular titles, including a monograph on the American designer Saul Bass; a book by illustrator Marion Deuchars, ''Let's Make Some Great Art; the art history text A World History of Art'' by Hugh Honour and John Fleming; and a series of adult coloring books by Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford.\nLKP has also been publishing playing cards, games, and jigsaw puzzles themed after animals and myths.
