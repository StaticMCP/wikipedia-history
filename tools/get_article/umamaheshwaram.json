It is located in the Nallamala Forest around 100&nbsp;km from Hyderabad on the Hyderabad-Srisailam highway (NH7), and 4&nbsp;km from the village of Rangapur, Achampet, Nagarkurnool district.\nUmamaheshwaram is the northern gateway of Srisailam &mdash; one of the jyotirlingas, on a hill surrounded by high trees. Nearby hills shield the temple and the 500-metre stretch to PapaNasanam from sunlight for most of the day, maintaining a lower temperature than the surroundings throughout the year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.umamaheshwaram.com/ Umamaheshrum - Tourism Photo Gallery]"
