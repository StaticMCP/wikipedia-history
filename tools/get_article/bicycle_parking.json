Parking facilities for bicycles include racks, lockers, parking stations, and covered areas. Bicycle parking infrastructure, in addition to cyclists' equipment such bicycle locks, offers a degree of security and may prevent bicycle theft. Ad hoc bicycle parking alongside railings, signs, and other street furniture is a common practice and may be recognized through formal legal arrangements.\nBicycle parking is an important consideration for the cyclability of a locality. Secure bicycle parking is a factor that influences people's decision to cycle. Bicycle parking at mass transit stations facilitates mixed-mode commuting. The role of bicycle parking in urban planning is studied through the discipline of bicycle transportation planning and engineering. Provisions for bicycle parking may be included in municipal policies and regulations.\nOverview\nBicycle parking is an important part of a municipality's cycling infrastructure and as such is studied in the discipline of bicycle transportation engineering. When bicycle parking facilities are scarce or inadequate, nearby trees or parking meters are often used instead.\nSections of existing car parks can often be retrofitted as cycle parking, offering advantages of location, cover, security, and parking for more people.\nIn addition to car parking, town planning policies and regulations increasingly require provisions for bicycle parking in new developments. Many mass transit stations include bicycle parking in the form of bike racks or purpose-built bicycle parking stations to facilitate mixed-mode commuting.\nSecure bicycle parking is arguably a key factor that influences the decision to cycle. To be considered secure, parking facilities must be of a suitable design; allowing the bicycle to be locked via the frame (see bicycle parking rack). A readily observable location can also permit so-called passive security from passers-by. Weather protection is also desirable. As a rule, where cycling is encouraged as an alternative to motoring, efforts should be made to make bicycle parking more convenient and attractive to use than nearby car parking arrangements. This usually means providing a wide distribution of visible, clearly designated parking spots, close to the entrances of destinations being served.\nStorage rooms or bicycle lockers may also be provided. In some cases, large concentrations of bike parking may be more appropriate, sometimes being supervised and sometimes fee-based. Examples include bicycle parking stations at public transport interchanges such as railway, subway, tram, bus stations or ferry ports where they may be useful in mixed-mode commuting.\nConversely, where cycling is seen as an unwelcome or inappropriate activity, or there is a lack of knowledge about best practices, bicycle parking may simply not be provided or else placed at awkward, distant, and out-of-sight locations. Cyclists may be expressly forbidden from parking their bicycles at the most convenient locations. In April 2007, the authorities at the University of California's Santa Barbara campus started confiscating bicycles parked at other than official bike racks. Some property owners or municipal authorities display signage on fencing to discourage bicyclists from locking their bicycles.\nTypes and equipment\n*Bicycle parking rack - also known as bicycle stand\n*Bicycle parking station\n*Bicycle lock\n*Bicycle locker\n*Cyclability\n*Sucker pole (not recommended for bicycle parking due to high incidents of theft)\nGallery\n;Urban planning\nBicycle parking lot.jpg|Multi-storey parking facility\nFisketorvet - Bicycle Parking (15915777652).jpg|Bike parking house at the shopping mall\nBicycle on S-train.jpg|Integrating bicycles with other modes of transportation\nBicycle-holders in S-train.jpg|Bike racks on trains\nHalf-Arc-by-Bike-Arc.jpg|Bike parking shelters\nBiceberg.jpg|Automated underground bicycle storage system (Biceberg in Zaragoza, Spain)\nParking-meter.jpg|Car parking meter with integrated bicycle lock ring (Montreal, Canada)\nBicycle parking at Valby.jpg|Multi-level bike racks and storage facilities\nFile:On-street bicycle parking corral on Flinders lane near Russell Street, Melbourne.jpg|Bicycle parking corral replacing a kerbside car parking space in Melbourne, Australia.\nFile:Třeboň, autobusové nádraží, přístřešky na kola.jpg|Bicycle parking in the Czech Republic\nFile:Gyártelep HÉV station, bicycle shelter, 2019 Szigetszentmiklós.jpg|A bicycle shelter in Hungary\n;Bike racks\nGöteborg Plads 05.JPG|Bike racks with a decorative value\nCykelstativ i beton.JPG|Temporary, moveable bike rack in heavy concrete\nJesus Bike by Richard Symonds 02.jpg|Fastened steel poles\nBikeparking (Aarhus) 2.JPG|Up-side down parking saves space\n2018 04 Fahrradboxen IMG 0830.jpg|Bicycle shelters with locks\nTachovské náměstí, pumpa a kolo.jpg|Opportunistic parking\nSt Catherine's College bike store.JPG|Grade I listed bicycle store at St Catherine's College, Oxford, England\nDukuh Atas MRT bike rack 20240715 134038.jpg|Bike racks located in front of the MRT stop entrance\nSee also\n* Outline of cycling\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm85.htm Victoria Transportation Policy Institute TDM Encyclopedia - Bike parking]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110426151435/http://www.bicycleparkingonline.org/ Bicycles at Rest] Non-commercial bike parking resource."
