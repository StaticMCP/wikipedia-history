It is the most heavily used park in the district. The park is adjacent to McConaghy Park, which contains McConaghy House, a historic property, built in 1886, and managed as a house museum by HARD and the Hayward Area Historical Society. McConaghy House features Stick/Eastlake architecture. It lies within San Lorenzo. In 2013, plans to renovate the park and combine the park and house into a Victorian-style venue were proposed.\nPark features\nKennedy Park contains a merry-go-round, a petting zoo, a pony ride, and a  narrow gauge railroad with a train pulled by a Chance Rides C.P. Huntington locomotive.  There are also picnic and activity areas, as well as a snack bar. The park is open every day during the summer and on the weekends during the rest of the year, weather permitting.\nReferences\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=mE-Zx4SFOhIC&dq=%22mcconaghy+house%22+hayward+area+recreation+and+park+district&pg=PA21]\n*Directory of Historic House Museums in the United States, Patricia Chambers Walker, Thomas Graham, Walnut Creek, California:AltaMira Press.
