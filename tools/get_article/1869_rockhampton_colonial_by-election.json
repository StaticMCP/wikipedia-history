Henry Milford won the resulting by-election on 6 December 1869, but did not take his seat in parliament.\nEventually this triggered another by-election in June 1870; although Milford contested this by-election, he was defeated  by Alexander Fyfe.\nSee also\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1868–1870\nReferences"
