It was first created in 1952, carved out of Vancouver South riding. In 1987, the riding was divided between Burnaby—Kingsway, Vancouver East, Vancouver Quadra and Vancouver South ridings. In 1996, a new Vancouver Kingsway was created out of these same four ridings.\nThis riding has been held by the NDP and its precursor CCF for most of its history. The NDP (along with the CCF) has won 15 of the 21 elections held since the riding was formed in 1953, the Liberals have won five, and the Conservatives, one. The two candidates who topped the poll in the 2008 election ran again in 2011. The incumbent member of Parliament, Vancouver lawyer Don Davies, represented the NDP, and Vancouver businesswoman Wendy Yuan represented the Liberal Party again. Davies won by approximately 3,000 votes in 2008. In 2011, Davies quintupled that margin, topping the Liberal candidate by over 15,000 votes, the Conservative candidate by over 10,000 votes, and winning over 50 percent of the votes cast.\nThe 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Vancouver Kingsway should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name was created. The redefined Vancouver Kingsway lost its territory west of Main Street to the new district of Vancouver Granville, as well as a small area in its extreme southeast to Vancouver South. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 2015 election.\nHistorical boundaries\nDavid Emerson controversy\nDavid Emerson was first elected in 2004, for the Liberal Party of Canada, and served in the Cabinet led by Prime Minister Paul Martin as the Minister of Industry.\nEmerson was re-elected as a Liberal in the 2006 election, but crossed the floor two weeks later on February 6, 2006, to become the new Minister of International Trade in Stephen Harper's Conservative government.\nEmerson's floor-crossing was highly controversial. Then Prime Minister-designate Stephen Harper dispatched campaign co-chair John Douglas Reynolds, on the day after the election, to offer Emerson a cabinet post in a Conservative government. Emerson's acceptance of that offer made Canadian history, marking the first time a member of parliament, let alone a cabinet minister, had crossed the floor before a new government was even sworn in.\nAs a result of the controversy, a number of groups formed to fight for Emerson's resignation. Some groups also seek legislation that would prevent floor crossing altogether or restrict a member of parliament if they abandon their party's caucus. Groups that fought against Emerson's defection included the Recall David Emerson campaign, which was aligned with the New Democratic Party, and the De-Elect Emerson campaign, which began under Liberal alignment but which eventually outgrew the influence of that party and became entirely citizen-powered.\nEmerson chose not to seek re-election in 2008.\nMembers of Parliament\nThis riding has elected the following members of Parliament:\nElection results\n1997–present\n| caption=Graph of election results in Vancouver Kingsway (since 1997, minor parties that never received 2% or more of the vote or that did not run candidates consistently are omitted)\n| align=center\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2021 federal election redistributed results\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | %\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| New Democratic ||align=right| 21,868 ||align=right| 50.40\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Liberal ||align=right| 12,591 ||align=right| 29.02\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Conservative ||align=right| 6,136 ||align=right| 14.14\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Green ||align=right| 1,575 ||align=right| 3.63\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| People's ||align=right| 956 ||align=right| 2.20\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Others ||align=right| 261 ||align=right| 0.60\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2011 federal election redistributed results\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | %\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| New Democratic ||align=\"right\"| 18,752 ||align=\"right\"| 51.27\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Conservative ||align=\"right\"| 10,177 ||align=\"right\"| 27.82\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Liberal ||align=\"right\"| 5,916 ||align=\"right\"| 16.17\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Green ||align=\"right\"| 1,292 ||align=\"right\"| 3.53\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Others ||align=\"right\"| 441 ||align=\"right\"| 1.21\n|}\n1953–1988\n| caption=Graph of election results in Vancouver Kingsway (1953-1984, minor parties that never got 2% of the vote or didn't run consistently are omitted)\n| align=center\n}}\nSee also\n* List of Canadian electoral districts\n* Historical federal electoral districts of Canada\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n* [http://www.elections.ca/scripts/webpep/fin/select_election.aspx?entity=1&lang=e Expenditures&nbsp;– 2004]\n* [http://www.elections.ca/scripts/ecCandidates2/Default.asp?L=E&Page=SearchByEdResult&DB=AsSubmitted&EL=226&ST=ED&ID=59029 Expenditures&nbsp;– 2000]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060929195238/http://www.elections.ca/eccandidates/district.asp?ran=2008.092&objectType=district&action=provinces&ul=1&ElectionID=191 Expenditures&nbsp;– 1997]\nExternal links\n* Website of the [https://www.parl.ca/ Parliament of Canada]"
