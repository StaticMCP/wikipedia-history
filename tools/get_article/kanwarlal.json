Hanumantha Rao under the Padmalaya Studios banner, presented by Krishna and directed by S. S. Ravichandra. It stars Jeetendra, Raj Babbar, Sujata Mehta in lead roles and music composed by Bappi Lahiri. The film is a remake of the Malayalam film Rajavinte Makan (1986). The name of the title character was based on the character name from Jeetendra's 1981 movie Meri Aawaz Suno.\nPlot\nThe film begins with an election campaign in which Surya Prakash, a young wily, contests and wins with the highest majority. Then, he feints his beau, Sandhya, a law student, as a scapegoat for his gain. Thus, Sandhya loathes and discards him despite pregnancy. After a few years, Surya Prakash fets up into minister. Besides, Kanwarlal is a daredevil businessman, justice-seeking hoodlum, and deity to the destitute. Surya Prakash antagonizes him to climb forward, so the rivalry erupts. Surya Prakash exposes Kanwarlal's illegal activities and files the case. He also suborns public prosecutor Chathursen, who accumulates the pieces of evidence. However, Kanwarlal is acquitted by heisting the file from Chathursen's junior Sandhya with guile. Accordingly, Sandhya is accused and arrested. Knowing it, Kanwarlal provides bail and tries to support her, but she denies it. Next, Surya Prakash also denounces Sandhya but, fearless, faces the consequences and starts practicing. Once, a lawbreaker, John Johnny Janardhan, approaches her, and she surrenders him to the Police. So, to avenge, he abducts her child when Surya Prakash omits to aid her. Hence, she seeks Kanwarlal, who will safely recoup the child. Moreover, he appoints Sandhya as his lawyer, and she successfully pulls ahead, whereby he loves her, and she also adores him. Parallelly, the battle between Kanwarlal & Surya Prakash ignites who moves the pawns and checkmates. Now, Surya Prakash is despised, which leads to his resignation. So, he plots to become Chief Minister through treason and slaughters Kanwarlal's men. Here, Kanwarlal explodes and demolishes the vicious political forces. On the verge of killing Surya Prakash, he backs, knowing him as the father of Sandhya's child. Tragically, Surya Prakash backstabs Kanwarlal, who mocks him. At last, Kanwarlal virtuously knocks him down at his feet. Finally, the movie ends with Kanwarlal leaving his breath on Sandhya's lap.\nCast\n* Jeetendra as Kanwarlal\n* Raj Babbar as Minister Suraj Prakash\n* Sujata Mehta as Advocate Sandhya\n* Amjad Khan as John Jani Janardhan\n* Arjun as Jagan\n* Tiku Talsania as Advocate Uttamlal\n* Birbal as Havaldar\n* Jankidas as Trivedi\n* Om Shivpuri as Public Prosecutor\n* Pinchoo Kapoor as Chief Minister\n* Viju Khote as Ram Prasad\n* Manmohan Krishna as Shastriji\n* Tej Sapru as Jangha\n* Rajan Haksar as IGP\nSoundtrack\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
