Written by historian Hua-ling Hu and published in 2000, the book recounts how Vautrin saved thousands of lives of women and children during the Nanjing Massacre.  A notable source for the book were the diaries that Vautrin kept during the massacre; these were discovered by author Iris Chang during the research for her book The Rape of Nanking.\nSee also\n* Finding Iris Chang\n* The Good Man of Nanking\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20020826201217/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/DH24Ad01.html An American hero in Nanking], Asia Times\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090917195758/http://www.library.yale.edu/div/Nanking/Vautrin.html Diaries of Vautrin], The Nanking Massacre Project, Yale Divinity School Library\n\n---\n\n## American goddess at the rape of nanking\n\n#REDIRECT American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking"
