      "text": "# Under Armour Undeniable Performance ESPY Award\n\nThe Under Armour Undeniable Performance ESPY Award was only awarded once, in 2006, on the player, irrespective of gender or nationality, adjudged to have made, in a given calendar year, the most significant, remarkable, and undeniable performance in a single regular season or playoff game contested professionally under the auspices of one of the four major North American leagues or collegiately under the auspices of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.  The award was one of two corporate-sponsored ESPYs; the titular sponsor designates criteria for selection consistent with its advertising campaigns.\nBalloting for the award was conducted over the Internet by fans from amongst between three and five choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.  At the time, the ESPY Awards ceremony was conducted in June (it is now held in July) and awards conferred reflect performance and achievement over the twelve months preceding presentation.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year of award\n!Date\n!Game or event\n!Venue\n!Competition, governing body, or league\n!Competing teams\n!Sport\n!Player and performance\n|-\n|2006\n|22 January 2006\n|2005-06 regular season game\n|Staples Center\n----\nLos Angeles, California, United States\n|National Basketball Association\n|Los Angeles Lakers\n----\nToronto Raptors\n|Basketball\n|In his side's 122-104 victory, Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant converts 21 of 33 two-point field goals, 7 of 13 three-point field goals, and 18 of 20 free throws attempted to score 81 points, more in a single game than any player save Wilt Chamberlain (100 in the 1961-62 season)\n|}\nSee also\n*Best Moment ESPY Award\n*Best Play ESPY Award\n*Best Record-Breaking Performance ESPY Award\nExternal links\n*[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223000325/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/espyawrd.shtml#undperf Enumeration of past winners from HickokSports.com]"
