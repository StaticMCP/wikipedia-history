It was not until 1960 that the Kafia Kingi area was transferred north of that line and added to Darfur. Sudan controls all or most of this area today, though at times independent South Sudan forces have briefly controlled large portions.\nAlmost all of Kafia Kingi (except a southern portion south of the Umblasha River) is within the borders of the Sudanese Radom National Park, a biosphere reserve, of which two-thirds are also within the borders of Kafia Kingi, while another one-third of the National Park is within the Sudanese region of South Darfur.\nThe Kafia Kingi region is a known haven for ivory smugglers. Congolese ivory is frequently held in Kafia Kingi before being taken north into Darfur.\nmap showing in detail the north–south line's location until 1960 on the northwest border of Kafia Kingi]]\nmap showing in detail the north–south line's location until 1960 on the north and northeast border of Kafia Kingi]]\nReferences"
