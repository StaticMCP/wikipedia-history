She was the consort of Emperor En'yū of Japan.\nBiography\nShe was the daughter of regent Fujiwara no Yoritada.  She was placed in the harem of the Emperor to benefit her father in his rivalry with his cousin Fujiwara no Kaneie, who also placed his daughter Fujiwara no Senshi for the same reason, that she would give birth to a Crown Prince and became Empress: Fujiwara no Junshi did become Empress, but it was  Fujiwara no Senshi who gave birth to a Crown Prince, while Junshi had no children.\nShe ordained as a Buddhist nun in 997.\nNotes"
