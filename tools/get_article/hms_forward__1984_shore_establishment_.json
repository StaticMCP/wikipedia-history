The unit once again moved in April 1999, this time to a new purpose-built building. Once again the official opening was performed by The Princess Royal. The ship acquired its name from the motto of the City of Birmingham - Forward. The unit is affiliated with , a Type 45 destroyer currently in service with the Royal Navy.\nAwards and noted events\nIn 2000, the ship won the Richards Trophy, a national seamanship competition, at .\nIn 2004, the ship was granted the Freedom of the City of Birmingham, from John Alden, Lord Mayor of Birmingham.\nIn 2007, a team from the ship, led by new recruit Jules Morgan, rescued a man with hypothermia from Snowdon in driving hail.\nThe ship became more famous in recent years when it produced a winner of The Sun Military Awards, Able Seaman Grandison, who won the national award for 'Best Reservist'.
