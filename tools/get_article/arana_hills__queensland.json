In the , Arana Hills had a population of 6,971 people.\nGeography\n, 2013]]\nArana Hills is located  north-west of Brisbane, the capital city of Queensland. It adjoins the Bunyaville Forest Reserve. Informally it is part of the Hills District.\nArana Hills lies within the northern part of the Kedron Brook catchment, although the waterway itself does not flow through the suburb.\nHistory\nUntil the 1950s the area still known informally as the Hills District was scattered with forest and small farms. In 1878, Frederick and Elizabeth Patrick purchased the first land in the area now known as Arana Hills. Today’s suburban landscape did not begin to emerge until the area was subdivided in 1937.\nIn 1956, the first modern suburban subdivision in the Shire of Pine Rivers was established in Arana Hills by Willmore and Randell. Marketed as Camden Park, land sales were phenomenal as the price was not exorbitant.\nAs there were several places named Camden Park, a public meeting was called in March 1962, with suggestions for adopting a new name. In June 1962 the name Arana Hills, from an Aboriginal name that it was assumed meant welcome, was submitted to council by the Camden Park Progress Association. The Queensland Place Names Board gave its approval and the new name was gazetted in December 1962. Later it was discovered that Arana was an Aboriginal word referring to the moon.\nPine Community School opened in Arana Hills on 24 January 1983.\nArana Hills remained part of the Pine Rivers shire until 2008, when it amalgamated with councils further north and east to form the Moreton Bay Region, now known as the City of Moreton Bay.\nIn 2008, Arana Hills was affected by severe thunderstorms that also affected many properties in northern Brisbane, causing millions of dollars of damage. Many volunteers and SES crews were needed to help clean up the damage. The area has now returned to its original state, but with the loss of some trees.\nDemographics\nIn the , Arana Hills recorded a population of 6,313 people, 51% female and 49% male.
