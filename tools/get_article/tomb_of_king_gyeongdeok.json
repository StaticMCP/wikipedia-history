On January 21, 1963, it was designated Historic Site of South Korea No. 23. It is a tumulus tomb encircled by a stone fence and carvings of the twelve animals of the zodiac.\nGyeongdeok's burial is mentioned in the historical texts Samguk sagi and Samguk yusa. There is some scholarly debate about whom exactly the tomb belongs to. Some argue that the carvings around the tomb are more characteristic of tombs from later than Gyeongdeok's era.\nReferences"
