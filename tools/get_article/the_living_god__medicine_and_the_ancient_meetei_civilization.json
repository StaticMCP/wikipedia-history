It is based on the medicine and the ancient Meitei civilization (ancient Kangleipak).\nThis documentary film was produced by a resourceless staff who were deeply conscious and appreciated of ancient forgotten human values for the revival. It initiates the information about unknown things and unsuspected resources of ancient civilizations and the hugely deep and materialistic modern times casting their shadow upon them. It shows the undiscovered knowledge as well as the unending ways and resources of the universe known to man only through deeply spiritual and considering great forces.\nBackground\nMeetei Civilization (Ancient Kangleipak), in the present day Northeast India bordering Myanmar (Burma), is a civilization still unknown to most of the world. Meitei script, its ancient script is the representation of the well developed nature of its civilization. The form, structure and phonology of the ancient Meitei writing system show the understanding of human physiology. The ancient Puyas record their ancient knowledge on many subjects including astrology, astronomy, genetics, human physiology, medicine, oracles (predictions), abiogenesis (origin of life), cosmogony (study of the origin of the universe), and the secrets of life and death. The ancient Meitei writings also deal with the relationship between Lai (Meitei term for God) and human beings. Even in present-day times, the mixed relationship between the two entities are celebrated in the Lai Haraoba (festivals of Gods). Standing against the burning of Puyas (Puya Mei Thaba), many of these ancient writings still survive even today. The medicine of this ancient civilization is considered as an inheritance from the Lai (Meitei term for God). The descendent people of the ancient civilization still continue to cure as well as treat many modern diseases and illnesses with the healing power of the ancient medicine.\nPrakas Aheibam, the director of the movie, has interests of antiques, artifacts and folktales since his childhood. Like many people of his age, he grew up hearing about the historic golden era of Meitei culture. So, he wished for studying for the then unknown world of Meetei Civilization (Ancient Kangleipak). In the year 2006, he saw a miraculous healing effect of the ancient Meitei medical science. It was when his father was suffering from a disease. So, he got more curious to learn about ancient Meitei culture and society. At the same time, one of his friends introduced him to the illustrated human physiology that formed the structure and phonology of revived ancient Meitei script. For almost a decade, Prakas Aheibam dedicated to study for the different aspects of the ancient Meetei Civilization (Ancient Kangleipak).\nInternational receptions\nThe movie received official entries in many international film festivals across the world.
