Michael Gear.\nPlot introduction\nSet in a future where an advanced humanity has forgotten their origins on Earth, the novel describes the political equations and power struggle between the emperor, a quasi-religious group, a pre-sentient computer named the Mag Comm and the Lord Commander.\nPlot summary\nHumanity is trapped in a \"gravity well\", the so-called Forbidden Borders.  Two remaining human empires - the Regan Empire and the Divine Sassa - are poised to fight one last war for domination of Free Space. The Lord Commander, Staffa Kar Therma a.k.a. The Star Butcher, is a mercenary who leads an elite group of soldiers (the Companions).  He has aligned himself to The Seddi Order, a former quasi-religious group in an effort to stop humanity from making itself extinct.\nThe Regan Emperor has been assassinated, and Internal Security Minister Ily Takka has now taken control of the Regan Empire. She plots darkly, and has ordered little respected, but brilliant, Division First (Commander) Sinklar Fist to return to Rega and become the leader of her military.\nCharacters\n*The Others: The (supposedly alien and superintelligent) beings who confined humanity inside the Forbidden Borders.
