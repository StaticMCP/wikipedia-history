The men were held prisoner for over a year before making their escape; after overpowering their captors they repossessed their aircraft, flying it to freedom towards Russia.\nBackground\nIn 1995, Afghanistan was in a state of civil war. In late 1994, the Taliban movement sprang out of Kandahar and by early 1995 had taken control of most of the country south of Kabul, forcing other Afghan groups to abandon territory.  In August 1995 the Russian crew of the Ilyushin Il-76 was working for Tatarstan-based Airstan, which was in turn leasing their plane to Rus Trans Avia Export, a Russian company based in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. On board the plane were Russian nationals: Captain Vladimir Sharpatov, First Officer Gazinur Khairullin, Navigator Alexander Zdor, and 4 crew members not in the cockpit: Askhad Abbyazov, Yuri Vshivtsev, Sergei Butuzov and Viktor Ryazanov. They were transporting 30 tons of weapons from Albania to the besieged Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani.\nCapture and captivity\nOn 3 August 1995, a Taliban air force MiG-21 aircraft forced the Russian aircraft to land at Kandahar. Negotiations between the Russian government and the Taliban to free the men stalled for over a year and efforts by U.S. senator Hank Brown to mediate between the two parties broke down over a prisoner exchange. The Taliban stated that they would free the airmen if the Russians released Afghans held by the Russian government. However the Russians denied holding any Afghan citizens. Brown was able to get the Taliban to agree that the Russian crew should be allowed to maintain their aircraft. This request paved the way for their escape.\nEscape\nThe Russians had been planning their escape for over a year. After Hank Brown secured visits to their aircraft for the whole crew they not only did routine maintenance but secretly prepared it for flight. On each trip, the crew would be guarded by six Taliban guards but on 16 August 1996, half of the guards left the crew for afternoon prayers. Seizing the opportunity, the Russians overpowered the remaining guards and the pilot was able to start one engine from the auxiliary power unit (itself started with a battery). With one engine running, the remaining three could easily be started. The aircraft, with all seven of the crew aboard, quickly taxied down the runway. The Taliban tried to block the runway with a fire truck but the aircraft was able to take to the air, thus avoiding the obstacle. The escapees were able to quickly exit Taliban controlled airspace and charted a course to the United Arab Emirates. The crew's escape was greeted with excitement and relief by the Russians and Russian President Boris Yeltsin telephoned the crewmen to congratulate them as they flew to Russia on a Russian government aircraft.\nIn popular culture\n*In 2001 the men released a book about their ordeal, called Escape from Kandahar.\n*Kandahar, a 2010 Russian film by Andrei Kavun details the Russian crew's ordeal in captivity and their escape.\n*The story of this is included in Operation Man Hunt () by Damien Lewis\nBibliography\n;Notes\n;References\n*\n*\n*\n* - Total pages: 308\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://englishrussia.com/index.php/2010/02/19/kandahar-captives/ Pictures of the crew's captivity]\n*[http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?regsearch=RA-76842 www.airliners.net – pictures of RA-76842]\n*"
