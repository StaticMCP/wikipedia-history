And then the whole press machine kicks up and doing press for the record.\" Caleb Followill added, \"We enjoy this part of the process. Obviously there's a lot of work that goes into it and it can get stressful at times, but we're all in a good place and we're having fun with it and we're all excited to do something new.\" The album was recorded at Henson Studios in Los Angeles, with Caleb saying the band was looking for inspiration: \"We might just try to get a little change of scenery. Our first two albums we recorded in L.A., so we're going to try to go back and see if it inspires us,\" he said. \"If it doesn't, we always have a studio at home, so we can always come back.\"\nIn August, the band announced that album title would be We Are Like Love Songs (aka WALLS), and that it would be released on October 14, 2016.\nPromotion\nOn September 10, 2016, Kings of Leon headlined at the Saturday evening Lollapalooza Europe music festival, in Berlin, Germany, which featured songs from all their albums, plus the new \"Waste a Moment\".

Dave Simpson of The Guardian said that with the album, the band returned to its sound from eight years ago.
