The Neapolitans were being pursued by an Austrian corps under the command of Adam Albert von Neipperg. During the evening of the 23 April, while a Neapolitan garrison of 3,000 men were stationed in the town, a small force of 600 Austrians hussars and jägers rushed the single stone bridge into the town. In the ensuing fighting, the Austrians brought out 200 prisoners with only minor casualties while inflicting moderate casualties on the garrison.\nThe following day, the rest of the Austrian advanced guard arrived at the town to find the Neapolitans had already left during the night.\nCitations\nReferences\n*\nFurther reading\n*Capt.
