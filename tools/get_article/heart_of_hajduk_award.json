      "text": "# Heart of Hajduk Award\n\nHeart of Hajduk () is an annual football award established in 1994 and officially awarded by the Hajduk Split supporters' association Torcida Split to the Hajduk player of the year.\nThe inaugural winner of the award was the midfielder Ante Miše, a key player in the squad which won the Croatian championship in the 1993–94 season. Two players have won the award twice, the striker Nenad Pralija in 1995 and 1996, and the goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa in 2000 and 2002. Up to 2012, only three foreign players had received the award (Josip Skoko in 1998, Mirko Hrgović in 2007 and Senijad Ibričić in 2010), although they all hold Croatian citizenship.\nIn 2006, the title was not awarded because, according to supporters' judgment, none of the players deserved it following a string of bad results in both domestic competitions which saw Hajduk, widely considered a powerhouse in Croatian football, finishing fifth in the national championship and exiting the 2005–06 Croatian Cup in the semi-finals.\nIn 2009, the club had initially struggled to find its form, but improved later in the season and eventually finished second in the championship and runners-up in the 2008–09 Croatian Cup (after coming back from a 3–0 defeat to their biggest rivals Dinamo Zagreb in the first leg and then losing the final in a penalty shootout). The supporters' frustration with yet another trophyless season was further increased when Hajduk went through much turmoil related to the transformation of the debt-ridden club into a public limited company in summer 2009. In addition, the team experienced a series of humiliating results at the beginning of the 2009–10 season, and this all led to the cancellation of the award for the second time. On 11 August 2011, the award was posthumously awarded to the legendary Hajduk manager Tomislav Ivić, who died in June 2011. In August 2012, Heart of Hajduk was awarded to the youth academy.\nWinners\nNenad Pralija, the only player to have won the award in consecutive years (1995 and 1996)\nThe 2009 winner, Drago Gabrić, pictured here posing with a [[Trabzonspor shirt after being transferred out from Hajduk in August 2009.]]\n:Names in bold indicate multiple winners.International caps correct as of 18 August 2022.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! width=80|Season\n! width=120|Name\n! width=90|Position\n! width=90|Nationality\n! width=60|Int. caps\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=40|Ref\n|-\n|1993–94\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|7\n|\n|-\n|1994–95\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|11\n|\n|-\n|1995–96\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|11\n|\n|-\n|1996–97\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Goalkeeper\n|\n|9\n|\n|-\n|1997–98\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|51\n|\n|-\n|1998–99 HNK Hajduk Split season|1998–99\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Defender\n|\n|1\n|\n|-\n|1999–2000\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Goalkeeper\n|\n|114\n|\n|-\n|2000–01\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Forward\n|\n|14\n|\n|-\n|2001–02\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Goalkeeper\n|\n|114\n|\n|-\n|2002–03\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|134\n|\n|-\n|2003–04\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|2\n|\n|-\n|2004–05\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Goalkeeper\n|\n|0\n|\n|-\n|2005–06\n| colspan=4 align=center|Heart of Hajduk was not awarded.\n|\n|-\n|2006–07\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|29\n|\n|-\n|2007–08\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|5\n|\n|-\n|2008–09\n| colspan=4 align=center|Heart of Hajduk was not awarded.\n|\n|-\n|2009–10\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|43\n|\n|-\n|2010–11\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Coach\n|\n|0\n|\n|-\n|2011–12\n|align=left|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2012–13\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Defender\n|\n|0\n|\n|-\n|2013–14\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|40\n|-\n|2014–15\n| colspan=4 align=center|Heart of Hajduk was not awarded.\n|-\n|2015–16\n| colspan=4 align=center|Heart of Hajduk was not awarded.\n|-\n|2016–17\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Midfielder\n|\n|0\n||\n|\n|-\n|2017–18\n| colspan=4 align=center|Heart of Hajduk was not awarded.\n|-\n|-\n|2018–19\n| colspan=4 align=center|Heart of Hajduk was not awarded.\n|-\n|-\n|2019–20\n| colspan=4 align=center|Heart of Hajduk was not awarded.\n|-\n|-\n|2020–21\n| colspan=4 align=center|Heart of Hajduk was not awarded.\n|-\n|-\n|2021–22\n|align=left|\n|align=left|Forward\n|\n|13\n||\n|-\n|2022–23\n|align=left|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2023–24\n| colspan=4 align=center|Heart of Hajduk was not awarded.\n|}\nSee also\n*Hajduk Split\n*Torcida Split\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.hajduk.hr/ Hajduk Split] official website\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100507210437/http://torcida.org/site/ Torcida Split] official website\n*[http://torcidakup.com/hajducko-srce/ Heart of Hajduk] at torcidakup.com"
