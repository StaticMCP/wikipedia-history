It was an open primary.  Puerto Rico initially planned to hold caucuses, as was done in 2000 and 2004, on June 7, 2008.  In December 2007, an error in the plan was discovered; the caucus date should have read June 1, 2008.  Puerto Rico also decided to conduct a primary, rather than caucuses.  Puerto Rico sent 55 pledged delegates to the 2008 Democratic National Convention.  These delegates were allotted on a proportional basis.  The territory's delegation also included eight unpledged \"superdelegates\".  Puerto Rico also selected one unpledged add-on delegate.  Selection of the unpledged add-on delegate occurred at the Assembly of the Democratic Party of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on June 21, 2008, in San Juan. Polls were open from 8:00 am to 3:00 pm, prevailing local time, Atlantic Standard Time (AST) (UTC-4, same as Eastern Daylight Time).[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P08/PR-D.phtml Puerto Rico Democratic Delegation 2008] Hillary Clinton won the primary.\nThe primary was the subject of a book published in 2010.\nPolls\nIn a poll conducted from March 31&ndash;April 5, 2008, Clinton led Obama by 13%, holding 50% to his 37%, with 13% undecided and a margin of error of ± 4.4%.\nIn a poll conducted from May 8&ndash;May 20, 2008, Clinton led Obama by 13%, holding 51% to his 38%, with 11% undecided and a margin of error of ± 3.4%.[http://www.slate.com/id/2175496/ Clinton holds the lead in a new Puerto Rico poll. - By Tony Romm - Slate Magazine]\nSuperdelegate endorsements\nPuerto Rico's superdelegates endorsed candidates before the election.
