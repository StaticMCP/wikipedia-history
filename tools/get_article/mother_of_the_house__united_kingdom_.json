In setting out the new tradition, Theresa May announced she was \"breaking with tradition\" by congratulating Harriet Harman as Mother of the House. The Centre on Constitutional Change attributes the normalisation and mainstreaming of the term to Harman, especially due to her prominence and leadership in the campaign to change the Standing Orders to allow female MPs taking maternity leave to vote in the House of Commons by proxy.\nThe term was used to refer to Harman for the remainder of her Parliamentary career, after which time Abbott became Mother of the House following her re-election as an MP on 4 July 2024.\nHistorically, the term was also used by MP Noel Billing in 1920 in reference to Nancy Astor who had been elected as the first female MP to take up her seat the previous year. Astor also used the term to refer to herself in 1945.\nRole\nSimilar to the titles of Father of the House and Baby of the House, the Mother of the House is not established by Standing Order but rather by convention. However, the role of Mother of the House gives the post holder great authority and legitimacy when speaking in debates.\nThe title is bestowed on the female parliamentarian with the longest uninterrupted service as MP calculated by the date of the election. When two MPs have served for the same duration, it is calculated depending on the date and time on which they took the Oath of Allegiance.\nThere is yet to be a female Member of Parliament who has sat longer than her male counterpart, making the Father of the House more senior.\nSince 2024, the Mother of the House has sworn or affirmed their allegiance at the start of a new Parliament after the Speaker of the House and the Father of the House but before the Prime Minister and any other MPs.\nList\nSo far, no woman has been the longest-serving member of the House of Commons. The following is a chronological sequence of longest-serving female MPs via the seniority criteria used to determine the Mother of the House.\nWhilst the term \"Mother of the House\" was first used in 1920 in reference to Nancy Astor, it did not have an official role or widespread use until 2017 when it was popularized in reference to Harriet Harman.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ List of longest-serving female MPs\n|-\n!|Name\n!|Portrait\n!Entered Parliament\n!width=100pt|Became longest-serving female MP\n!Left the House\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Constituency\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|\n|1919\n|1919\n|1945\n|\n|Plymouth Sutton\n|CH.
