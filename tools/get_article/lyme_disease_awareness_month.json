In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control reported that Lyme disease was the fifth most common of a list of nationally notifiable diseases in the United States. Both public awareness campaigns and healthcare provider campaigns exist that aim to reduce the incidence of Lyme disease.\nLyme disease observances\nLyme Disease Awareness Month is observed during May in Canada and the United States, and also in other countries where Lyme disease is common. Lyme Disease Awareness Day is also observed on May 1 every year.
