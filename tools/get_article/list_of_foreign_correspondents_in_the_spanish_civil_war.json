It only includes those who were specifically accredited as such, as opposed to writers who later wrote of their experiences, including Gustav Regler, George Orwell, and so on.\nForeign press coverage of the war was extensive, with around a thousand foreign newspaper correspondents working from Spain.\nSome journalists wrote for more than one newspaper and several papers had more than one journalist in Spain at the same time or at different times. In some cases, they were already seasoned war correspondents when they went to Spain. A few of them, such as Jay Allen, were already living in Spain when war broke out, and some of them, again like Allen, who wrote at various times for the Chicago Daily Tribune, News Chronicle, and The New York Times, wrote for more than one paper.\nWhile some correspondents supported the rebel cause, most notably William Carney, Edward Knoblaugh]and H. R. Knickerbocker, according to the Hispanist Paul Preston, \"The bulk of the reporters became so committed to the Republic, partly because of the horrible things they saw such as the bombing of civilians, but even more so because they felt that what was going on in Spain was everybody's fight.\"\nA case in point was that of Louis Delaprée, a Catholic correspondent sent to cover the rebel zone for Paris-Soir, who was killed as a result of his plane being shot down on his way back to Paris, furious at his newspaper not publishing his articles, as it clearly considered the \"massacre of a hundred Spanish children is less interesting than a sigh from Mrs Simpson.\"\nAnother, even more Catholic, correspondent was Noel Monks, an Australian journalist for the Daily Express, who had initially been sympathetic to Franco, wrote critically of the \"so-called British experts\" who would later visit Guernica and \"deliver pompous judgements: 'Guernica was set on fire by the Reds,' My answer to them is unprintable... If the 'Reds' had destroyed Guernica, I for one could have blown the whole story... And how I would have blown it had it been true!\"\nJournalists\nA\n*James Abbe\n*Barbro Alving (Bang) – Dagens Nyheter\n*Jay Allen – the Chicago Tribune and News Chronicle\nB\n*Sam Baron – Socialist Call\n*Vernon Bartlett – News Chronicle\n*Georges Berniard – Le Petit Gironde\n*Daniel Berthet\n* Burnett Bolloten – Associated Press or United Press\n*Franz Borkenau – London Daily Express, Austrian journalist who went on to write The Spanish Cockpit\n*Georges Botto – Havas Agency\n*Rene Brut\n*Henry Buckley – Daily Telegraph and the Observer\n*M.

While Philby suffered only a minor head wound, Johnson was killed outright, and Neil and Sheepshanks soon died of their wounds.\nReferences"
