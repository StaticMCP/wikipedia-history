This award was seen as a substitute for the ACM awards for New Male Vocalist, New Female Vocalist, and New Vocal Duo or Group. This award was first awarded in 2004 to Dierks Bentley, when this award was known as the Top New Artist of the Year.\nFrom 2004 to 2010, the award was known as the Top New Artist of the Year.\nAnd from 2011 to 2015, the award was known as the New Artist of the Year.\nThis award is given to the new artist who has gained initial fame or significantly greater recognition during the promotion of a debut or sophomore album within the eligibility period. The artist must have released a single that reached the Top 40 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs or the Mediabase Country charts. Any albums self-released through an independent label the artist owns and operates may not be counted as a debut or sophomore album, unless it produces a Top 40 single reported by Billboard’s Hot Country Songs or Mediabase Country charts.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Artists are eligible based on their work of the previous calendar year.
