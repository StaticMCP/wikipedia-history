It was an early maneuver of the Korean War.\nThe Korean People's Army (KPA) 12th Infantry Division attempted to advance through Andong on its way south to Pusan, but was opposed by the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) 8th and Capital Division. The ensuing battle destroyed much of both the ROK 8th and KPA 12th Divisions, but the 12th suffered the heaviest damage; air attacks killed 600 from the division, 11 of the division's 30 T34-85 tanks were destroyed, and the division commander had been killed. The 12th Division, exhausted, had to cease its advance.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
