It follows the interactions between Vendetta, a villainous tomboy that regularly makes terrible creatures called \"fiends\", and Charlotte, a cheerful and gullible girly-girl who thinks that Vendetta is her best friend. Charlotte unintentionally irritates and annoys Vendetta. As a result, Vendetta attempts to assassinate her with fiends, but she always fails due to Charlotte's luck.\nThe site was first put up on June 3, 2003, and the series debuted with its first episode on July 14, 2003. In 2004, the series was licensed by Nickelodeon, and eventually the episodes were broadcast on TurboNick. The series would later be uploaded to Amy Winfrey's YouTube page in 2012 in remastered HD quality. A 30-minute animated horror comedy cartoon television series was greenlit in 2008 on Nicktoons, which aired only 6 episodes each before being cancelled. Nickelodeon Animation Studio, Cyber Chicken Animation Studio and DQ Entertainment Limited all televised the TV show.\nCharacters\n*Vendetta: (Voiced by Aglaia Mortcheva) Vendetta is a sociopathic, narcissistic and histrionic young tomboy with the power to create \"fiends\" with a book of recipes. She is moss green and wears pigtails that tend to fly up when she yells. She constantly squints her eyes for emphasis. She spends her time reading magazines and tormenting the other children in her school with her monstrous creations. She uses her dangerous fiends to get what she wants, such as her constant assistant Grudge who helps her give out physical punishment. She develops a one-sided rivalry with Charlotte, and often attempts to kill her. Vendetta almost always uses fiends for her attempts, but she has also done methods like tricking Charlotte into wearing concrete shoes and walking off the edge of a pier. She despises music, to the point of being hurt by it. Her diet consists of almost entirely beef jerky, clams, and grape punch. She speaks in a thick Bulgarian accent and has somewhat broken English. Vendetta appeared in every episode except for episode 14.\n*Charlotte: (Voiced by Amy Winfrey) A light-blue, optimistic girly-girl from Vermont. She has curly hair and wears a hairbow. Charlotte believes that all creatures are cute and harmless, and everybody is a potential friend. She tries to find the best in any person or situation, and ignores anything she finds strange. She is convinced that Vendetta is her new best friend, much to Vendetta's chagrin. Charlotte's naivete and oblivious invulnerability results in many of Vendetta's plans for torment to backfire. Vendetta seeks to kill Charlotte, but is never successful. A running gag is that Charlotte sees projectiles thrown at her as gifts. Almost every episode includes her singing a song that she makes up on the spot. Charlotte has the uncanny ability to hold her breath for nine hours. She has a pet hamster named Buttons. Charlotte is the only character present in every web episode.\n*Grudge: (Voiced by Peter Merryman) Vendetta's giant hamster fiend, mistaken for a bear by Charlotte and a dog by Mrs. Minty. Grudge does not speak, but rather grunts and growls, and is Vendetta's constant sidekick. He assists Vendetta in making fiends and giving threats to those who defy her. Vendetta almost never refers to him by name, simply calling him \"hamster\". Unlike most other fiends, he seems to actually care for Vendetta and her safety, despite her harsh treatment of him. Like Rubella and the cat fiend, he is also capable of eating inedible objects. In episode 18, Grudge is replaced by Rubella. In episode 20, Vendetta takes Grudge back after he protects her from rogue fiends.\n*Mr. Milk: (Voiced by Peter Merryman) The teacher of Charlotte's and Vendetta's class. He is a beige, nearly bald man with a tie and glasses whose few remaining hairs stick up when he is scared or surprised. He speaks in a nervous, disjointed monotone due to Vendetta's domination, and is forced to do Vendetta's bidding out of fear of her. He is also afraid of the fanged red bird fiend that is constantly glaring at him. Mr. Milk is probably inspired by Caspar Milquetoast, a comic book character remarkably similar to him. He also physically resembles the South Park character Herbert Garrison, notable because Amy Winfrey worked on the first few episodes of South Park. He has a tenor singing voice.\n*Marion: (Voiced by Amy Winfrey) A pale blue, overweight girl who sits next to Charlotte and speaks in a nasal whisper. She has a collection of glass animals, and has many allergies. A cowardly girl, she was the first student to talk to Charlotte and warn her about Vendetta. She appears to be friends with Malachi, and her DVD commentary implies that she has a crush on Marvin.\n*Malachi: (Voiced by Peter Merryman) A grey boy who follows Charlotte around school, giving her dire cautions about Vendetta and her fiends, which Charlotte does not understand and ignores. He is Marion's friend. He is a Puritan; he speaks in complicated, archaic English and refuses to sing because it is blasphemous.\n*Marvin: (Voiced by Peter Merryman) A taller, dark green boy who almost always starts his sentences with \"my\", usually because his belongings are always stolen from him, but also as a verbal tic. Once an episode, he will exclaim \"My [possession]!\". He is very unlucky, slow and weak. According to Marion's commentary, he brought a banana to show and tell because his father works at the banana factory.\n*Maggie: (Voiced by Amy Winfrey) A grey girl who sits next to Marvin and doesn't speak until \"Wonderful Wintry Day\", when she cogently remarks, \"Charlotte's dumb\". In the background, she is seen writing.\n*Rubella: (Voiced by Elissa Calfin) Vendetta's replacement fiend sidekick. She is a giant doll who resembles Frankenstein's monster. She eats non-edible food (like wood, glass and plaster) and talks in one- and two-word sentences. She is named after the disease Rubella. She thinks of Vendetta as her friend rather than boss, and gave her a musical toy bear, which angered Vendetta and let her to abandonment.\n*Giant Kitty: (Voiced by Amy Winfrey) Also called \"Hellcat\". A giant red cat fiend, and the first fiend to appear in the web cartoon. He often attacks the students when they're outside, and has an immense appetite, able to eat anything that will fit in his stomach. He is temporarily tamed by Charlotte, where Charlotte brushes and cares for him, although he gets angry again when Charlotte says he needs a bath.\n*Buttons: Charlotte's pet hamster, her \"favorite hamster in the whole world\", first seen in episode 2. He is known for making a high-pitched noise at the sign of any danger.\n*Scissor Fiend: A fiend Vendetta made for Charlotte that resembles a bird and can cut things with its scissorlike beak. Charlotte thinks it's a puppy, and it ends up being her friend instead of killing her. It has a talent for making Valentines gifts. It tries to rescue Charlotte even in the most dangerous situations. In the TV series, Charlotte names it Buttons 2.\n*Mrs. Minty: (Voiced by Peter Merryman) A substitute teacher. She is an elderly woman who, true to her name, is mint green. She refers to the classmates as \"buttercups\", \"ducklings\", and other diminutive terms of endearment. She seems to be unaware of Vendetta's reputation and abilities, not unlike Charlotte. Her main debut is in episode 9, and she is also seen in episodes 20 and 21, but does not talk.\n*Mort: A blue boy with glasses that was seen in episode 19, being picked up by an ice cream fiend. He is added as another student in Mr. Milk's classroom in the TV series.\nOther recurring characters include the Mrs. Millet the lunch lady, and her pet red frog-like fiend on the lunch counter that controls her. There are also other grey, unnamed students, a girl with clips in her hair that is often seen screaming and waving her arms in the episode \"Vegetables\", and a boy with a baseball cap, both of which are in the classroom next to Vendetta's.\nSeries overview\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! style=\"padding:0 px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Episodes\n! style=\"padding:0 px;\" colspan=\"2\"| Originally aired\n|-\n!

In the episode, Vendetta and Charlotte have their roles reversed; Vendetta wants to be Charlotte's friend, while Charlotte makes fiends and tries to kill Vendetta.

On April Fool's Day, the main menu had a bite taken out of it, and the fiend was there to explain that he got hungry and ate some episodes, but fixed them. As a result, the episodes 4, 6, 11, 18, 19, and 20 were replaced with their alternate DVD versions as an April Fool's joke.\nBroadcast on TurboNick\nNickelodeon bought the series and did a successful test run of Making Fiends on its web-based TurboNick. Few restrictions were made by the network execs when they made the deal, they told Amy Winfrey, \"Just don't mention Hitler, and don't hit people on the head\".\nWinfrey conceded to a few small changes. For example, a classroom poster that read \"A is for Alimony\" had to be changed. She was stumped for a while on what A should be for. Aglaia would pop into Winfrey's office and suggest things, such as Alcoholism. They settled on \"A is for Abomination\".\nSee also\n* Amy Winfrey\n* Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl\n* Salad Fingers\n* TV series\n* List of characters\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.makingfiends.com/ Making Fiends]\n*[http://www.muffinfilms.com/ Muffin Films (another series by Amy Winfrey)]\n*[http://www.big-bunny.com/ Big Bunny (also by Amy Winfrey)]\n*"
