They set up the Transcaucasian Commissariat, a coalition government of Azerbaijani Musavats, Armenian Dashkans and Georgian Social-Democrats. This body was initially designed as a temporary measure until the legitimate government would be restored, viewing the region as an integral part of Russia, although it later decided to break away from Russia in April 1918 and the sovereign Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was proclaimed.\nThe Transcaucasian Commissariat inherited the Caucasian Front of the First World War. Russian Caucasian Army was exhausted, its servicemen were won over by Bolsheviks, and it was self-demobilizing.\nAs the threat of Turkish invasion grew under such conditions, the Transcaucasian government decided to authorize the creation of the national armed forces from the remnants of the Russian army to occupy the deserted posts. The respective national councils of the Transcaucasian nations and their military commissariats were tasked with this mission. However, the process was undermined by a lack of weaponry and ammunition, political lobbyism over professionalism, Bolshevik sympathies among soldiers and weak military morale and discipline.\nThe Georgian Army Corps was formed from the Georgian personnel of the Russian army on the Caucasus Front on 5 November 1917. The Transcaucasian Commissariat and the Army Command believed that the national corps would be better at defending their land against the Ottomans unlike other units on this front which were revolutionary-minded and no longer wanted to engage in military conflict, which resulted in massive desertions. However, the national units, including Georgian, also suffered from the same problem, and were not combat-capable. In reality, the Georgian Corps united only 10,300 men, thus being less than the size of a single full division. In February 1918, the Georgian regiments organized mutinies in Gori, Telavi and Kutaisi but were put down by the Red Guard.\nThe Red Guard was a paramilitary organization of the Social Democratic Party of Georgia established in 1917 as the major political parties began to form their own armed forces amidst the revolutions. It was initially called the Workers' Red Guard. Its first operation involved seizing a district gun-depot of Tiflis on 12 December 1917 from the pro-Bolshevik guards, thus preventing the Bolshevik coup in Georgia. The Red Guard was subordinated to the Tiflis Council of Workers' and Soldiers', a body dominated by Georgian Social Democrats. The Guard mainly consisted of volunteers, with there being no officer ranks in its command.\nEstablishment (1918)\nAfter the Georgian declaration of independence, the discussions on the creation of the Georgian army on the basis of Georgian Army Corps began in full swing. The ruling Social Democratic Party of Georgia, based on their Marxist views, preferred a Swiss-style armed militia, and considered the Red Guard as its prototype, although they also acknowledged the necessity of a strong regular army because of the complicated political situation in the region. The Social Democrats thought that the Guard and the regular army would ultimately merge into the militia system. The military elite, on the other hand, supported the creation of a strong regular army, compromising on the existence of the separate Guard only if it was to be in a close coordination with the army. They were supported by the German military circle, which the Social-Democrats met with discontent. The opposition National Democratic Party and one of its leaders Davit Vachnadze also argued in favor of a single army under a single commander which would unite all social classes.\nThe Social Democrats feared the manifestation of Bonapartism within the army and the scenario of Kornilov affair. They also feared a possible alliance between the opposition National Democrats and the German Empire to engineer a coup against the government. Another reason for their position was that the army was infiltrated by the Bolsheviks who often staged mutinies, while the volunteer-based Guard was more credible and suppressed the Bolshevik uprisings. The continued existence of the Red Guard was justified by Social Democrats through pointing out its role in dealing with the internal threats.\nUltimately Georgia ended up with both the army and the Red Guard. The latter was renamed into the People's Guard and was tasked with dealing with the internal issues exclusively, while in war time it would dissolve and the guardsmen would join the army through their respective enlistment offices. The People's Guard was formalized as the state entity with the new law passed in July 1918. The Guard was not within the jurisdiction of the Defence Ministry during peace time unlike the army and was subordinated to the Guard's General Headquarters. During the war, both the army and the People's Guard were to be subordinated to the Commander in Chief. The service in the People's Guard did not exempt the guardsmen from serving in the regular army and thus during the mobilization of the army the guardsmen were to be scattered within the regular army units. The Guard was subordinated directly to the chairman of the government and had its own district headquarters. The district headquarters were elected by the local guardsmen and were confirmed by the General Headquarters.\nIn June 1918, the government passed the first decree on the regular army, establishing its temporary organization structures. The regular army was subordinated to the Defence Ministry and the deputy minister served as the chief in command. The army had the general and field staffs, the latter being responsible for training and supplies, while the former for war planning, the mobilization schemes, topography, legislative work etc. The Georgian Army Corps was transformed into the Georgian Regular Army and the commander of the corps was replaced by the Commander in Chief. The General Army was to be recruited through the mandatory conscription. The conscripts would serve two years in the army, then be transferred to the reserve for 18 years and then 8 years to the militia. The Guard was volunteer-based.\nThe relations between the Regular Army and the People's Guard were marked by antagonism. The existence of parallel structures within the armed forces undermined the coordination. Moreover, there were some armed incidents between the guardsmen and the regular army soldiers. In general, the People's Guard was treated as the privileged structure. Despite being obliged to subordinate to the Commander in Chief during war time with the guardsmen joining the regular army units, in reality the guardsmen continued to fight within the People's Guard units and often did not follow the instructions of the Commander in Chief.\nThe regular army had its high priest, with Anton Totibadze serving on this position.\nIn August 1918, the new laws were passed on the structure of the regular army. According to the staff structure adopted in 1918, the army was to consist of two infantry divisions, a separate artillery brigade, a cavalry brigade, an engineering-technical force, and a coastal (border) army (41,260 men in total).\nThe army units were to include following detachments:\n1. Infantry division: division headquarters, three infantry regiments, an artillery brigade, a separate cavalry squadron, a sapper company (11,178 men, 45/54 cannons, 1,680 horses).\n2. Artillery brigade: brigade headquarters, light artillery divizion (three 4-gun batteries), two field heavy Howitzer divizions (three 4-Howitzer batteries in each divizion, 2 cannons in a battery in peace time). Personnel and equipment number - 2,146 men, 30/48 cannons, 870 horses.\n3. Cavalry brigade: brigade headquarters, three cavalry regiments (in each regiment: the regiment headquarters, three cavalry squadrons, cavalry machine gun squadron, communications group, cavalry sapper company, training group, repair group, bugler group), reserve squadron, cavalry artillery battery — 3,437 men, 4 cannons, 3,173 horses).\n4. Engineering-technical Force: Sapper Battalion, Technical Battalion, Special Motor Company, Armored Vehicle Company, Aviation Squadron (2,656 men, 6 armored vehicles, 11 cars, 35 trucks, 6 car-trucks, 3 car workshops, 8 motorcycles, 7 bicycles, unspecified number of planes).\n5. Coastal Guard: three detachments, training detachment (4,859 men, 1,146 horses).\nAccording to the August 1918 law, the National Council was the supreme body of the army and it exercised its powers through the government and the ministry of the military. The Commander in Chief was to be appointed by the government during wartime with full operational freedom. The General Headquarters of the Regular Army were organized within the ministry of the military, with the field staff to be created during the war time.\nAlthough Georgia's manpower was around 164,000 men, which was expected to be fully mobilized during the war, the regular army struggled to recruit troops due to lack of equipment, economic difficulties, logistical complications, lack of experience and diligence among officers and morale among soldiers and other factors and was only able to recruit up to 9,000-12,000 men in peace time and 20,000-30,000 men in war time through mobilization. Moreover, constant mobilization and demobilization due to constant wars hindered conscription and proper training of the troops. As of late September 1918, the regular army consisted of: 1st Division (2,333 men), 2nd Division (3,032 men), Army Artillery Brigade (600 men), Cavalry Brigade (993 men), Coastal Army (1,181 men), and Engineer-Technical Forces (769 men). All were severely understrengthened and the entire army was not even a size of a single division. As of October, the army lacked 60% of the personnel and 80% of the horses.\nThe failure of the conscription in 1918 showed that the country was unable to maintain the large regular army. Moreover, Georgia was relying on German Empire, which was interested in the existence of a strong Georgian military, but its defeat in the First World War in November 1918 further complicated Georgia's situation. This spurred a move to reorganize the staff of the permanent regular army.\n1919–1921\nIn 1919, the discussions began on reorganization of the army. The deputy minister of the military Aleksandre Gedevanishvili supported using the People's Guard as the basis for the armed forces and uniting the headquarters of both bodies into a single body, the military collegium, for the better coordination, with the possible transition into the militia system only in the future. He did not oppose the retention of both the Regular Army and the People's Guard as separate bodies. The People's Guard formation department head Voronovich presented the plan to abolish the regular army altogether and establish the mandatory conscription into the People's Guard. General Kvinitadze, who was also asked to present his project, supported the abolition of People's Guard to create a strong regular army, with a military figure being appointed as the Minister of Military and the mobilization being conducted based on territorial principle. Ultimately, both armed formations were retained and a commission including both the regular army and the People's Guard representatives was established.\nIn July 1919, the army was reorganized and retained only 16,950 personnel. It moved to the cadre system. In peace time, the army had three infantry brigades, army artillery divizion, cavalry regiment, coastal (border) detachment, engineering-technical forces and military school. In war time, three infantry brigades were to be organized into three divisions. The size of the military was to be upgraded to 45,820 men, with this being a classified information. The structure of the army in peace time was as follows:\n1. Infantry brigade - brigade headquarters, four infantry battalions, artillery divizion (three batteries). Personnel and equipment - 3,330 men with 12 cannons.\n2. Army Artillery Divizion - Divizion Headquarters, Mountain Battery, Light Howitzer Battery, Heavy Field Artillery Battery (565 men, 12 cannons)\n3. Cavalry Regiment: Regiment headquarters, three squadrons, cavalry machine gun squadron, communications company, cavalry sapper squadron, training company, non-commissioned company (633 men).\n4. Coastal Guard: Coastal Guard Squad, Poti, Akhaltsikhe, Sokhumi, Dariali, Sighnaghi and Borchalo detachments, Tbilisi Guards Battalion, flotilla (3,116 men).\n5. Engineering-Technical Forces: Engineering-Technical Forces Headquarters, Battalion of Demolition Workers, Separate Motor Team, Aviation Team, Aviation School, Radio-Telegraph Team. Number of personnel - 1240. Equipment - 69 cars (4 of them armored), 16 motorcycles. The number of aircraft was unspecified.\nThe 1919 project was drawn up by Colonel Aleksandre Zakariadze.\nIn 1919, the process of building up Georgian army was underway with the involvement of Georgian generals and officers who had experience in Russian Imperial Army. Colonel Valerian Tevzadze translated the military terms into Georgian from Russian statues, which was then distributed to troops.\nOn 30 May 1919, Georgia established the Military Council for the purpose of inspecting the armed forces and supplying them. The goal was to resolve the conflicts between the People's Guard and the regular army on these issues.\nAmong other reforms, the new laws established the military school to prepare officers and lieutenants of all ranks. The Muslims and Doukhobors were exempted from the military conscription. In November 1919 Abkhazians were also exempted from the conscription.\nIn April 1920, amidst the Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan, Georgia established the Defense Council of the Republic responsible for the strengthening of the armed forces and war planning. The Council existed until August and was then resurrected in November, continuing to function until the country lost its independence. The Council had no authority to intervene into the operational activities of the Commander-in-Chief.\nThe military service was reduced to one year and four months, with a subsequent transfer to the reserve for one year and eight months. The service in the People's Guard was now equated to the service in the regular army. However, in practice the People's Guard was never filled with conscripts. The People's Guard continued to be independent in war time and this was somewhat formalized in law too. In November 1920, the Defence Council passed a decree allowing the Main Headquarters of the People's Guard to create the Field Staffs which would work with the front commanders as the units of the People's Guard would be subordinated to the fronts. The units of People's Guards in reality were following the directives of these Field Staffs.\nOn 25 June 1920, the number of personnel slightly increased to 19,360 men. The Georgian-Muslim Cavalry Division, the Georgian-Muslim Infantry Battalion, the Georgian Legion and the Borchalo Azerbaijani Cavalry Company were added to the army. The Georgian-Muslim units were created by the political leadership to fight the separatist rebels from January to April 1919 as Georgia faced separatist revolts in Akhaltsikhe and Ardahan districts supported by the South-Western Caucasian Republic. The cavalry division was actually the size of a battalion and consisted of cavalry and infantry squadrons and MO platoon, with 276 troops.\nThe Minister of Military in 1921 estimated the number of recruitable population to be 151,180 men, although the army continued to suffer from a lack of troops.\nStructure\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Location\n|-\n|1st Army Infantry Brigade\n|Kutaisi\n|-\n|2nd Army Infantry Brigade\n|Tbilisi\n|-\n|3rd Army Infantry Brigade\n|Gori\n|-\n|Army Artillery Brigade\n|Tbilisi\n|-\n|Army Cavalry Divizion\n|Tetritskaro\n|-\n|Sapper Battalion\n|Tbilisi\n|-\n|Coastal Guard detachments\n|PotiAkhaltsikheSokhumiDarial GorgeSighnaghiShulaveri\n|-\n|Tbilisi Guards Battalion\n|Tbilisi\n|-\n| colspan=2| Source:\n|}\nCombat composition\n*1st Army Infantry Brigade (Headquarters: Kutaisi)\n**1st Infantry Battalion (Kutaisi)\n**2nd Infantry Battalion (Sokhumi)\n**3rd Infantry Battalion (Poti)\n**4th Infantry Battalion (Ozurgeti)\n**1st Artillery Divizion (Kutaisi)\n*2nd Army Infantry Brigade (Headquarters: Tbilisi)\n**5th Infantry Battalion (Tbilisi)\n**6th Infantry Battalion (Telavi)\n**7th Infantry Battalion (Tbilisi)\n**8th Infantry Battalion (Dedoplistskaro)\n**2nd Artillery Divizion (Mukhrovan-Gombori)\n*3rd Army Infantry Brigade (Headquarters: Gori)\n**9th Infantry Battalion (Akhaltsikhe)\n**10th Infantry Battalion (Gori)\n**11th Infantry Battalion (Akhalkalaki)\n**12th Infantry Battalion (Manglisi)\n**3rd Artillery Divizion (Gori)\n*Tbilisi Guards Battalion (Tbilisi)\n*Army Artillery Brigade (Tbilisi)\n*Army Cavalry Divizion (Tetritskaro)\n*Sapper Battalion (Tbilisi)\nEquipment\nThe Mosin–Nagant was the primary rifle of the Georgian infantry. In addition, Georgia had other rifles of different origins, calibers and ranges: Lebel, Grasse, Berdan, Mannlicher, Arisaka, three-line Winchester; Mauser and various modifications of the Krag–Jørgensen and Martini–Henry rifles. The officers bore Nagant M1895 revolvers, as well as Frontier Bulldog, pistol Luger, M1911 and Mauser C96. PM M1910 and Lewis gun were the primary machine guns of the Georgian army.\nGeorgia inherited a small number of weaponry from the Russian Caucasian Army stockpiles. As of July 1918, the Georgian regular army had in its arsenal 4,796 rifles and carbines, 223 machine guns and more than 24 million cartridges: 2,812 Mosin–Nagant rifles (7,62mm) and its 2,037,880 cartridges, 147 Japanese Arisaka rifles (6,5mm) and its 3,686,900 cartridges, 218 Berdan rifles (10,75&nbsp;mm) and 7,881,819 cartridges, 190 Swiss-Italian Vetterli rifles (10,35&nbsp;mm) and 857,520 cartridges, 1,322,698 catriges of French Lebel rifles (8mm) and 7,464,041 cartridges of French Chauchat machine guns (8mm). As Georgia had no Chauchat machine  guns, the army was able to use its cartridges for Lebed rifles, although not for the main rifle of Georgian army — Mosin rifle. Along with rifles, Georgia had in its arsenal 222 Luis machine guns and 203,768 cartridges, and one Colt machine gun with 8,000 cartridges. It is unknown how many rifles were in use in army before the independence. As of July 1918, it is estimated that the Georgian army had 9,045 Mosin rifles in use. Although it's unknown how much cartridges were in use in army in July 1918, it can be estimated that the army suffered a serious lack of cartridges, a lack of rifles for war time period and also a lesser lack of machine guns.\nThe stockpiles of Georgian army were filled through various means, including purchase of weapons, disarming population, and seizure of weaponry. When the Imperial German Army withdrew from the Caucasus, it handed heavy machine guns, mortars and vehicles to Georgia. Also, Germany sold 20,000 rifles with four million cartridges captured from the Imperial Russian Army to Georgia, although as of 1919 Georgia was being unable to pay the price. The number of Luis and Maxim guns in stockpiles increased to 472, the stockpiles of Mosin rifles to 22,812 and its cartridges to 6,037,880. From May 1918 to May 1919, 25,000 out of 30,000 rifles of various type in Georgian stockpiles were handed to the Georgian army and the rest were handed to the Guard. In overall, it is estimated that the Georgian army had app. 40,000 Mosin rifles, and much fewer other rifles and carabines.\nCoupled with the German handovers, the Georgian army had 472 machine guns in stockpiles and an unknown number was in use in the military in 1918. 400 machine guns from stockpiles were handed to the Georgian army in 1919.\nIn July 1920, according to Soviet Russian military attache to Georgia Pavel Satin, Georgia disarmed the White Army units which fled from the Red Army to Georgia. The Georgian army seized all artillery pieces, two tanks, 1,600 horses, three armored and transport vehicles, two hundred cartloads, 40 machine guns, two light automobiles and up to 20,000 rifles. According to the French military attache though, Georgia seized only 7,000 rifles, 150 machine guns, 10 Howitzers, two tanks, 21 trucks, 6 automobiles, 13 motorcycles, one radiotelegraph, hundreds of cartloads and up to 3,000 horses.\nIn contrast to the lack of rifles, Georgia had a relative large stockpile of grenades, estimated from 57,584 to 200,000. However, only 3,000 were used in 1918 because of lack of knowledge on its use.\nIn terms of artillery, Georgia had 3-inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) field cannons of 1900 and 1902 models, 3-inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) mountain cannons of 1904 and 1909 models, 48-line (122&nbsp;mm) howitzers of 1904, 1905 and 1909 models, and 45 Linear (114 mm) British howitzers. As of July 1918, the stockpiles consisted of 156 artillery pieces: 115 3-inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) mountain cannons of 1909 model, 12 3-inch field cannons, six 48-line (122&nbsp;mm) and two 45-line (114&nbsp;mm) howitzers. Georgia had 112,492 shells, although not all shells were used as Georgia lacked some types of artillery pieces. 42,029 shells were reserved for 3-inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) mountain cannons of 1909 model (365 shells for one cannon). In 1919, the stockpiles were reduced to 33,023 shells for mountain cannons (287 shells for one cannon). 123 shells were reserved for each 48-line Howitzer. The deficit was less noticeable for 3-inch field cannon as 1,389 shells were reserved for each one as of July 1918, although the number was reduced to 865 shells by March 1919. As for 45-line Howitzers, there were 4,000 shells for each in stockpile.\nIn addition, the stockpiles also contained 99 pieces of 9&nbsp;mm grenade launchers with 94,906 shells and eight mortars with 230 shells. In 1920, Georgia also received two 6-line field and two mountain Howitzers, which were still not enough for war time composition of units.\nThe Georgian armed forces had seven armored vehicles: one Garford-Putilov armoured car, four Austin armoured cars; one Pierce-Arrow car, and one homemade armored Napier car. In addition, the People's Guard seized and utilized two depreciated Mark V tanks from the Russian White Army. In 1918, the Armored Vehicle Company of the Regular Army was assigned six armored vehicles. In 1919 it was reorganized into Separate Vehicle Team and assigned four armored vehicles, with the number increasing to six vehicles in war time. In addition, the People's Guard also had its own Armored Vehicle Team. However, these staff figures did not match the real number of the armored vehicles in armed forces. The Regular Army actually had only two armored vehicles. The armored vehicles of the regular army were called \"Homeland\" (Austin) and \"Georgia\" (the latter being Napier seized from Red Army in 1919), while those of the People's Guard were \"Guardsman\", \"Proletarian\", \"International\", \"Peasant\", and \"Struggle\". These armored vehicles were actually transferred to the Georgian armed forces by the German Empire.\nThe People's Guard had four armored trains. They were the most fierce weapons of Georgian armed forces, each equipped with 3-4 mountain cannons and 14 to 25 machine guns. The Georgian armored trains were: \"Republican\", \"Worker\", \"Victory or Death\" and \"Freedom Fortress\". The armored trains were inherited from the First Caucasian Separate Railway Brigade of the Russian Railway Troops. Three out of four of them were lost during the Armeno-Georgian War. Subsequently, a one armored train was commissioned in March 1919. The third one with two mountain cannons and 10 machine guns was constructed in early 1920. The construction of the fourth one began in December 1920 under the leadership of Valodia Goguadze, the commander of the Armored Train Squad of the People's Guard.\nGeorgia inherited mostly obsolete and exhausted planes from the First World War. In 1920, the White Army handed over four Sopwith Camel F.1 fighters to Georgia while escaping the Red Army. In the summer, Georgia purchased ten SVA.10s from the Ansaldo plant in Italy. The Georgian air force suffered from fuel and oil shortages.\nAs for Georgian navy, it had only several small Greenport boats and sometimes used civilian boats for military purposes.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
