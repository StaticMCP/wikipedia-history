Service began in 1896, and ran until around 1917, when service from the Worcester, Brookfield and Spencer Street Railway Company came to town. Other factors contributing to its closure included wartime shortages of coal and a car barn fire, the damage of which was estimated to be around $75,000.\nReferences"
