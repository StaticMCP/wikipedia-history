Incumbent president Zoran Milanović was eligible for a second term, and was re-elected with a record 75% of the vote.\nBackground\nVoters in Croatia had also voted for the Croatian Parliament in April and European Parliament in June.\nThe first round was planned for December 2024 but on 15 March 2024 incumbent president Zoran Milanović announced he would run as a candidate of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP) for the position of prime minister. During this press conference, he also revealed he would tend his resignation as the president only in case of a parliamentary election victory on 17 April 2024. Had Milanović become prime minister, the constitution required that a preliminary presidential election taking place no later than 16 June 2024. However, the SDP-led Rivers of Justice coalition won only 42 seats in the election and the HDZ won a vote of confidence after securing the backing of minority representatives and several MPs from the Homeland Movement, with Milanović continuing as president.\nOn 20 November 2024, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković announced that the presidential election would be held on 29 December, which was approved by the Croatian Parliament on 21 November.\nThe leadup to the election was marred by several controversies, including the November arrest and subsequent dismissal of Minister of Health Vili Beroš on various corruption-related charges. This caused a standoff between Croatian law enforcement agency USKOK and the European Public Prosecutor's Office, one of whose investigations was blown by the arrest. Attorney General of Croatia Ivan Turudić ruled that USKOK would continue the investigation using the evidence collected by EPPO. Milanović criticised this decision. Another controversy happened around the same time when Milanović vetoed the government's proposal to involve Croatia in a NATO operation training Ukrainian soldiers. The parliament did not attempt to overrule his veto.\nElectoral system\nThe president of Croatia is directly elected by secret ballot to a term of five years using the two-round system, with presidents limited to two full terms in office. The constitution requires that a presidential election be held no sooner than 60 days and no later than 30 days before the expiration of the incumbent president's term. An absolute majority (50% + 1 vote) of all votes cast (including invalid, blank and uncast ballots) is required to win in the first round. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, a second-round is to be held fourteen days later, with the two candidates with the highest number of votes in the first round taking part. The candidate who receives the highest number of votes in the second round (a majority of valid votes cast) is declared the winner. If one of the candidates who has qualified for the second round were to withdraw their candidacy or die, the candidate with the next highest number of votes in the first round takes their place in the second round.\nIn order for a potential candidate to be allowed to contest the elections and have their name placed on the ballot, they must gather at least 10,000 signatures from eligible voters, with every signatory being permitted to give their signature to only one potential candidate. The timeframe for collecting the said number of signatures is set at twelve days, and after the expiry of this period potential candidates must submit them to the State Electoral Commission for verification.\nCandidates\nOn 11 December, the State Electoral Commission published a list of eight candidates.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Candidate\n!

He said that his key values are \"the rule of law, right to equality, personal freedoms and rights of minorities\". On foreign policy, Milanović said he would \"keep Croatia outside global conflicts,\" and that the country must \"retain the right to independent decisions about its national interests\". Milanović said he would not slow former Yugoslav countries' accession to the EU.\nDragan Primorac ran on a campaign of co-operation with the HDZ government. He said he would \"return civility ... particularly to political and public spheres of life\" and that \"the military is always above politics\", and he offered \"unconditional adherence\" to \"Western values\" and the NATO alliance. Primorac's campaign was conservative on regional issues. He promised to \"offer special attention to the rights\" of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and prevent Serbia from joining the EU unless it provided Croatia with access to archives containing information about mass graves from the Croatian War of Independence (1991&ndash;1995).\nNeither Primorac nor Milanović led an active campaign. Milanović attended only a single debate, on 23 December, during the first round of the elections, but his ratings remained high due to the popularity of his presidency. According to political analysts, both Milanović and Primorac expected to enter the second round regardless of their campaigns.\nMarija Selak Raspudić campaigned on a platform that included economic problems, population decline and corruption. Ivana Kekin campaigned against Dragan Primorac and the HDZ, accusing them of corruption in the healthcare sector. On 7 December a group of Croatian veterans from Imotski held a peaceful protest at the Vinjani Donji–Gorica border crossing against what they claimed was a \"media blockade of candidate Tomislav Jonjić\".\nIn the first round Primorac trailed Milanović by 30 percentage points. In the only debate of the second round debate, on 7 January, both candidates turned to insults. Milanović accused Primorac of being \"totally illiterate\", while Primorac called Milanović a \"pro-Russian puppet\" who \"divided\" Croatia. On the same day, the Jutarnji list newspaper prematurely ended an online election poll after receiving 25,000 votes tipping the scale to Primorac in a short timespan from US-based internet addresses. In the wake of the debate, the Centre for Information Resilience, a UK-based organisation, published a report alleging that \"pro-Russian, anti-EU, and anti-NATO bot networks\" promoting Milanović on several social media networks were attempting to influence elections. However, the Večernji list national newspaper managed to contact the owner of one of the Facebook accounts singled out in the report. The account turned out to belong to a real person, a Facebook activist from Dugo Selo near Zagreb. Social media networks X and TikTok both denied the allegations; TikTok reported removing a different bot network promoting Primorac.\nOpinion polls\nFirst round\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;

however, Milanović likely attracted a number of HDZ voters. The results of the second round were taken as a sign of a small loyal voter base for the HDZ, since the large point difference in the first round likely demotivated voters. Some blamed Primorac's low vote count on a poor choice of candidate by the HDZ or the choice to initially campaign as an independent candidate before the formal HDZ endorsement. Primorac and Prime Minister Andrej Plenković caused a minor controversy by not congratulating Milanović in their election night speeches; though former president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović and Archbishop of Zagreb Dražen Kutleša both congratulated him afterward.\n|votes1=797938|votes1_2=1122859\n|cand2=Dragan Primorac|party2=Independent (Croatian Democratic Union) HSU, HDS, DP, HSLS and HNS}}|votes2=314663|votes2_2=380752\n|cand3=Marija Selak Raspudić |party3=Independent |votes3=150435\n|cand4=Ivana Kekin|party4=We can!|votes4=144533\n|cand5=Tomislav Jonjić|party5=Independent (Croatian Party of Rights)|votes5=82787\n|cand6=Miro Bulj|party6=The Bridge|votes6=62127\n|cand7=Branka Lozo|party7=Home and National Rally|votes7=39321\n|cand8=Niko Tokić Kartelo|party8=Independent|votes8=14409\n|invalid=18786 |invalid2=57209\n|electorate=3531622 |electorate2=3533441\n|source=[https://www.izbori.hr/pre2024/rezultati/1/ izbori.hr], [https://www.izbori.hr/pre2024/rezultati/2/ izbori.hr]\n}}\nThe State Election Commission announced that the total cost of holding the elections was 14.285 million euros.\nSee also\n*2024 elections in the European Union\n*2024 European Parliament election in Croatia\n*2024 Croatian parliamentary election\nNotes\nReferences"
