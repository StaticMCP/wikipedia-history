The term folk music can not be easily defined in a precise manner; it is used with widely varying definitions depending on the author, intended audience and context within a work.  Similarly, the term traditions in this context does not connote any strictly defined criteria.  Music scholars, journalists, audiences, record industry individuals, politicians, nationalists and demagogues may often have occasion to address which fields of folk music are distinct traditions based along racial, geographic, linguistic, religious, tribal or ethnic lines, and all such peoples will likely use different criteria to decide what constitutes a \"folk music tradition\".  This list uses the same general categories used by mainstream, primarily English-language, scholarly sources, as determined by relevant statements of fact and the internal structure of works.\nThese traditions may coincide entirely, partially or not at all with geographic, political, linguistic or cultural boundaries.  Very few, if any, music scholars would claim that there are any folk music traditions that can be considered specific to a distinct group of people and with characteristics undiluted by contact with the music of other peoples; thus, the folk music traditions described herein overlap in varying degrees with each other.\n|Styles           = ballad - folk hymn - protest song - sea shanty - shape note - singing\n|Dance            = barn dance - Country-western two-step - longways - jig - reel - square dance\n|Instrumentation  = fiddle - flute - guitar - harpsichord - violin\n|Other            = Caller - Shakers\n}}\n; Burk, Cassie, Wirginia Meierhoffer and Claude Anderson Phillips, pp. 30, 44.\n|Styles           = collegia musica - cornet band - Moravian funereal music - trombone choir\n|Dance            =\n|Instrumentation  = hautboy - kettle drum - trumpet - viol\n|Other            = Ephrata Cloister - liederkranz - Singstunde\n}}\n|Styles           = folk hymn - lining out - Old Way of Singing - psalmody - shape note\n|Dance            = barn dance\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\n|Styles           = ballad - brass band - Delta blues - blues-harp - fife and drum band - folk hymn - jug band - Sacred Harp - shape note - Southern gospel - white spiritual\n|Dance            = barn dance - chicken in the breadtray - clogging - fisher's hornpipe - Highland fling - jig - lancer - pigeonwing - polka - quadrille - reel - square dance - waltz\n|Instrumentation  = banjo - dulcimer - fiddle - guitar - harmonica - mandolin\n|Other            = singing\n}}\n|Styles           =\n|Dance            = Danza del Venado\n|Instrumentation  =\n|Other            =\n}}\nSee also\n*American folk music\n*Folk music\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nNotes"
