They were a bitter contest between Juan Luis Sanfuentes – a Coalition candidate of the Liberal Party and Conservative Party – and Javier Ángel Figueroa – supported by the Liberal Alliance parties. Sanfuentes beat Figueroa by a single vote in the electoral vote, with numerous allegations of fraud and electoral intervention. Due to the controversy, the National Congress made a contingent vote, which Sanfuentes won by 77 votes to 41.\nResults\nReferences"
