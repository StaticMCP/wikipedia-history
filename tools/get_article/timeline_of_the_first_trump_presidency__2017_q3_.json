This was due to an increase in consumer spending, private inventory investment, non-residential fixed investment, increased exports, decreased imports, and increased federal government spending. This gain was offset by residential fixed investment and local government spending.\nPublic opinion\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight, President Trump concluded this quarter with an approval rating of 38.6%, representing a quarterly decline of 1%, and a decline of 6.9% since his inauguration.\nTimeline\nJuly 2017\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
