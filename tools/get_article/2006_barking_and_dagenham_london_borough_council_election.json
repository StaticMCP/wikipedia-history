The whole council was up for election. Barking and Dagenham is split up into 17 wards, each electing 3 councillors, so a total of 51 seats were up for election.\nThe Labour Party retained control of the council winning 38 seats and 41% of the popular vote. The British National Party won 12 seats in a rare electoral breakthrough for a far-right party, and formed the official opposition winning 17% of the popular vote. The Conservatives won 1 seat.\nBackground\nIn the lead up and aftermath of the election, Barking and Dagenham underwent significant demographic change causing a massive rise in support for the British National Party. In the 2001 census, the white British and Irish percent of the borough's population was 82%.\nFrom 2000 to 2011, Barking and Dagenham underwent one of the biggest demographic change in London's history, the proportion of White British residents decreased from 82% to 49%, the largest decrease of White British residents in any unitary authority across Britain, and the second largest proportional decrease, just behind neighboring Newham. A significant amount of White British residents, mainly who were displeased with the massive surge of immigration to the borough, moved out to the home counties, particularly neighbouring Essex, for instance, Cavney Island, a town in Essex, became a hotspot for those moving out of nor only Barking and Dagenham, but also East London boroughs. This trend started in the 80s, mainly in the inner East London boroughs (Tower Hamlets,) Newham and Hackney, with Barking and Dagenham and neigbhbouring Havering acutally being a source of destination for many moving, this trend rapidly accelerated in the 2000s and a significant amount of Essex's population can trace their family links to East London.\nThe proportion of foreign born residences soared by 205%, the black population increased from 6% to 20%, the Asian population went from 4% to 15% and other white went from 3% to 9%. In 2006 estimates placed the White British percent of the borough at around 65-70%. This rapid demographic change caused a surge in support for the BNP, a far right political party whose main focus was on immigration and demographic change. Many White British residents, most who had lived in the borough for generations, found themselves drawn to the BNP solely by the concern of immigration and demographic change.\nWhilst the White British population only comprised 57% of their 2001 share, their numerical population declined by arround 30% down from\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!\n!2001\n!2011\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n!White\nBritish:\n!139,667\n!108,386\n!\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!% of population\n!82.03%\n!49.46%\n!\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|132,566\n|\n|}\nAs quoted by the Labour MP for Barking at the time, Margaret Hodge, she said \"8 out of 10 of my (White British) constituents were considering or plan to vote for the BNP. Between 2001-2011 she tried to balance the new realities facing the borough and the growing resentment of many long term residents. However, her stance was wildly criticized by both sides, both who saw her trying to appeal excessively to the other side. In the run up to the election, numerous other political figures within the borough accused her of \"giving\" the BNP votes.\n115 candidates were nominated in total. Labour again ran a full slate (51) and was the only party to do so. By contrast the Conservative Party ran only 23 candidates, whilst the Liberal Democrats ran 4 and the BNP ran 13.\nElection results\nWard results\nin red and British National Party in dark blue.]]\nAbbey\nAlibon\nBecontree\nChadwell Heath\nEastbrook\nEastbury\nGascoigne\nGoresbrook\nHeath\nLongbridge\nMayesbrook\nParsloes\nRiver\nThames\nValence\nVillage\nWhalebone\nBy-elections between 2006 and 2010\nChadwell Heath\n}}\nThe by-election was called following the resignation of Cllr.
