The album was recorded and released posthumously, as the group broke up prior after touring troubles and made the album as they were obliged to do so by contract. Hydra Head Records issued the vinyl edition of the album, and in 2008 Relapse released a remastered version of the album under the title 012:2. The album was included in Decibel Magazines \"Hall of Fame\" in 2008.\nWriting and recording\nPrior to the album's creation, the band was in the middle of a two-legged tour across the United States. The first leg in the East Coast, the second in the West Coast. One of the destinations for the West Coast leg of the tour was in Idaho, and by the time the group reached that state, the van broke down. This ultimately resulted in their disbandment.\nBecause the group already received an advancement check from Relapse, they decided to record one last album to let the label issue. Guitarist Jes Steineger wrote all his parts in the span of three days on an acoustic guitar. The album was produced within a weekend, and Relapse originally sold it as an EP due to its short length.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nBand\n* Sean Ingram&nbsp;– Vocals, Art direction, Design\n* James Dewees&nbsp;– Drums\n* Jes Steineger&nbsp;– Guitar\n* Nathan Ellis&nbsp;– Bass\nProduction\n* Ed Rose&nbsp;– Producer, Mixing\n* Matthew F.
