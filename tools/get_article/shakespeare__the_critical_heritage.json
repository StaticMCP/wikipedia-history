      "text": "# Shakespeare: The Critical Heritage\n\nShakespeare: The Critical Heritage also known as William Shakespeare: The Critical Heritage  is a six-volume work edited by Brian Vickers. Volumes 1 through 3 were published in 1974 and 1975 by Routledge & Kegan Paul.  Vickers' \"Critical Heritage\" is described as a \"...more or less complete collection of criticisms of Shakespeare's works.\" Additionally, this set was expected to span three centuries by the time Volume 3 was available. Vickers as the editor, wrote digestible introductions to each volume and easy to read headnotes throughout. Volume 6 covers the years of 1774 to 1801, and was published in 1981. The complete set covers viewpoints on Shakespeare's work \"from 1623 through to 1801.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
