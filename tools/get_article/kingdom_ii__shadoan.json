      "text": "# Kingdom II: Shadoan\n\nKingdom II: Shadoan is a 1996 video game from Philips Interactive Media, Inc. The game is a sequel to Kingdom: The Far Reaches.\nGameplay\nIn Shadoan, players take on the role of Lathan, the last of the Argent Kings, on a quest to recover two ancient relics scattered across the Five Kingdoms. The game unfolds through animated sequences, with interactivity triggered at key moments when the player must quickly select the correct item to avoid peril—signaled by a falling hourglass. Navigation is handled via mouse, using tools like the Scrying Glass, Farsight Window, and Map of Journey, while the interface itself is complete with animated item selections and detailed graphics. The game does require some specific item acquisition—such as needing the Dagger of Arnes before pursuing the Crown of Malric. Magical scrolls from Daelon's Portal must be collected across multiple visits. Players manage inventory through the Scrying Glass, with items in the Pouch only usable once they appear in this interface. Supplementary tools like Lathan's Journal and the Book of History offer lore and note-taking, as well as the whimsical Shadoanomicon. The game also features unlimited healing and save options.\nDevelopment\nThe game's budget exceeded $3 million.\nReception\n|rev2=GameSpot\n|rev2Score=7.3/10\n|rev3=PC Gamer\n|rev3Score=35%\n|rev4=PC Joker\n|rev4Score=39%\n|rev5=PC Player\n|rev5Score=2/5\n|rev6=Power Play\n|rev6Score=32%\n|rev7=PC Gameworld\n|rev7Score=35%\n}}\nAll Game Guide said \"Shadoan is a wonderful game that will afford many hours of interesting play for gamers.
