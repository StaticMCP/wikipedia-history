He had a prolific career that spanned six decades across stage and screen, with several award-winning portrayals and defining interpretations. His parents were musicians, who encouraged him to pursue music. However, he felt compelled to pursue acting instead, and acquired a scholarship to the RADA in London. Among his fellow aspiring thespians were Peter O'Toole and Albert Finney—each of whom, along with Bates, would be Oscar-nominated by the end of the 1960s.\nBates made his stage debut in Coventry, in a play called You and Your Wife. After joining the Royal Court Theatre's repertoire for several Off West End plays, he soon made his West End debut in one of the quintessential \"kitchen sink realism\" dramas, John Osborne's Look Back in Anger—a role which he reprised on television. His portrayal of younger son, Edmund Tyrone, in Eugene O'Neill's classic ''Long Day's Journey into Night garnered him notice from the Clarence Derwent Awards. After some further TV work, he landed his (verified) film debut in The Entertainer (1960), starring Laurence Olivier, and co-starring, among others, Finney and the future Mrs. Olivier, Joan Plowright. It was the film debuts of the latter two as well. He succeeded this with breakthrough performances in Whistle Down the Wind (1961) and A Kind of Loving, the latter of which brought him his first BAFTA Film Award nomination.\nWhat followed in the 1960s was a very bountiful decade of well-received performances in an eclectic array of films: reprising his role from the Harold Pinter play, The Caretaker (1963,  The Guest); The Running Man (1963); Nothing but the Best (1964); and King of Hearts (1966). In between these were two of his most successful films thus far: Zorba the Greek (1964) and Georgy Girl (1966). The former obtained numerous accolades, including three Academy Awards out of seven nominations. The latter garnered four nominations from the Oscars; and six from the Golden Globes, including two for Bates: one for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical Film and the other for Most Promising Male Newcomer. The following year, he earned yet another Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Drama Film for Far from the Madding Crowd (1967).\n(1968).]]\nCome 1968, he would receive his highest set of recognition yet for The Fixer. He earned another Golden Globe (Best Drama Actor) nomination, coupled with his only Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, for his role as Yakov S. Bok (based on the real-life case of Menahem Mendel Beilis), a Russian Jew who was falsely accused of a blood libel murder. One year later, in Women in Love (1969), Bates and Oliver Reed achieved notoriety for an infamous homoerotic fireplace-lit wrestling scene, containing full-frontal nudity of both actors—which was groundbreaking for that taboo at that time. Bates earned his second BAFTA nom for that performance.\nWithin the next decade, the 1970s, Bates continued tackling a plethora of complex roles. One such role was in playwright Simon Gray's Butley (1974). Prior to its aforementioned film adaptation, the original 1971 play won Bates an Evening Standard Theatre Award in London that same year. Afterwards, it was swiftly rendered onto the Broadway stage—for which he won a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Play, plus an equivalent Drama Desk Award and Drama League Award as well, in 1973. Other films of his from this era included The Go-Between (1971); A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (1972); In Celebration (1975), from David Storey—another in which he originated on stage; Royal Flash (1975); The Shout (1978), An Unmarried Woman (1978); and The Rose (1979). He was also involved with Lord Laurence Olivier's production of Three Sisters at The Old Vic, including the subsequent 1970 film adaptation, re-released as part of the American Film Theatre series (alongside Butley and In Celebration).\nHe also returned to television, including frequent anthology series guest roles such as in Play for Today (episodes: \"Plaintiffs and Defendants\" and \"Two Sundays\", for which he jointly earned a BAFTA TV Award nomination) and Great Performances (the Laurence Olivier Presents rendition of Pinter's The Collection); and the miniseries, The Mayor of Casterbridge (1978). Bates has described the latter as his personal favourite role. Meanwhile, from their success from Butley, the Bates/Gray collaborative duo cultivated their working friendship and relationship into continued creative output. Gray began writing plays with Bates specifically in mind, starting next with Otherwise Engaged (1975). This was another successful venture for Bates, whose performance was once again praised and earned him his first Variety Club Award in the UK.\n.]]\nDuring the 1980s, his output tapered down. But his roles continued to bring him recognition. On television, he starred in a remake of Separate Tables (1983), as well as An Englishman Abroad (1983), Pack of Lies (1987), and The Dog It Was That Died (1989). \"Abroad\" would become his most decorated screen performance, including his only BAFTA (TV) win. His film work this decade included such films as Nijinsky (1980), The Return of the Soldier (1982), a cameo appearance in Britannia Hospital (1982), Duet for One (1986); and We Think the World of You (1988), in which he and Gary Oldman played lovers who were separated when Oldman was sent to prison, leaving Bates in charge of their German Shepherd. And in theatre, he reunited with Osborne, whose play, A Patriot for Me (1983) earned Bates his only Olivier Award nomination and a second Variety award win.\nSudden tragedy struck in 1990 when one of his twin sons, Tristan, died from a sudden asthma attack at age 19. Bates persevered, although his 1990s film output featured far less critical acclaim than in the previous decades. However, he still did receive another BAFTA Film nomination for Hamlet (1990) and another BAFTA TV nom for Unnatural Pursuits (1992). Other efforts include the television movie ''Nicholas's Gift (1999), based on the true story of Nicholas Green; the TV mini-film biopic on Marcel Proust, 102 Boulevard Haussmann (1991) (via the weekly anthology series Screen Two); the miniseries Oliver's Travels (1995); and the films, Mister Frost (1990) and The Cherry Orchard (1999).\nHe instead devoted more of his time to the stage. He and his surviving twin son, Benedick Bates, established the Tristan Bates Theatre. (Now known as the Seven Dials Playhouse.) His array of roles from Gray plays included Stage Struck (1979), Melon (1987), Life Support (1997)—and Simply Disconnected (1996), which was a sequel to Otherwise Engaged. Other theatrical ventures included fringe theatre at the Stratford Festival in Ontario of Richard III (1967); thrust stage performances at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre of The Taming of the Shrew (1973) as Petruchio; a one-man show entitled A Muse of Fire (1989); Poor Richard (1964); The Dance of Death (1985); Ivanov (1989) by Anton Chekhov (performed concurrently with Much Ado About Nothing'', as his son's namesake, Benedick); Stages (1992) by Storey; The Showman (1993); The Master Builder (1995) by Henrik Ibsen; and Pinter's 1984 double-bill: One for the Road/Victoria Station.\nin Poor Richard (1964).]]\nPrior to his death, Bates was working continuously. He was part of the vast ensemble of Gosford Park (2001), which earned seven Oscar nominations. It acquired many accolades as an ensemble cast, garnering him a number of prizes as a result, including a win at the Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Ensemble Motion Picture Cast. On television, he appeared in the miniseries Love in a Cold Climate, earning his seventh and final BAFTA nomination. He also received another Drama Desk Award nomination and was a Lucille Lortel Awards winner as lead actor, for the Off-Broadway play The Unexpected Man (2001).\nThe stage brought him one final triumph, with the play ''Fortune's Fool (2002). He took home a hat-trick of awards, winning the Outer Critics Circle Award in addition to both the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play and the equivalent Tony Award, each of the latter for the second time. His final few films included Evelyn (2002); The Sum of All Fears (2002); The Mothman Prophecies (2002); and his final theatrical film, The Statement (2003), which was critically lambasted. His final work, a two-parter titled Spartacus (2004), was released posthumously. Just one year prior to his death, Bates was officially knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:020px;\" | Year\n! style=\"width:250px;\" | Title\n! style=\"width:190px;\" | Role\n! style=\"width:540px;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1960\n| The Entertainer\n| Frank Rice\n| Film debut.\n|-\n| 1961\n| Whistle Down the Wind\n| The Man (Arthur Blakey)\n|\n|-\n| 1962\n| A Kind of Loving\n| Victor Arthur \"Vic\" Brown\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1963\n| The Caretaker\n| Mick\n|  The Guest; Originated role on stage.\n|-\n| The Running Man\n| Stephen Maddox\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1964\n| Nothing but the Best\n| James \"Jimmy\" Brewster\n|\n|-\n| Zorba the Greek\n| Basil\n|\n|-\n| 1965\n| Once Upon a Tractor\n| Joe Turrel\n| Short film.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1966\n| Georgy Girl\n| Jos Jones\n|\n|-\n| King of Hearts\n| Sig.
