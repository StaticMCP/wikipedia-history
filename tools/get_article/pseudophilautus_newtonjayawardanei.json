It is one of the 8 species of rhacophorids that were discovered from Adam's Peak in 2013. It has been observed between 1800 and 2000 m above sea level. In those areas, people have seen it sitting on leaves 8 m above the ground.\nIt is threatened by habitat loss, which scientists attribute to increased urbanization, agriculture, grazing, and logging.\nEtymology\nThe frog was named after Dr. Newton Jayawardane, a surgeon and a wildlife conservationist.\nAppearance\nThe adult female frog measures 38.4&nbsp;mm in snout-vent length.  The skin of the dorsum is bronze in color. There is a white stripe in the middle of the back. There are dark brown stripes sideways from the eyes to the groin. There are small bronze marks on the snout and face. The flanks are lighter in color green, brown, and white spots. There are brown marks on the legs. The ends of the toes are almost white in color. The webbed skin is also off-white. This frog has a dark brown cross band between eyes.\nOriginal description\n*\nReferences"
