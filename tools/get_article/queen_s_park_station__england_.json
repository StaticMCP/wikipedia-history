It is on the Bakerloo line of the London Underground and the Lioness line of the London Overground. On the Bakerloo line, the station is between Kensal Green and Kilburn Park stations. On the Lioness line, it is between Kensal Green and  stations.\nThe station lies at the southern end of Salusbury Road, near the south-east corner of the public park from which the area now known as Queen's Park has taken its modern name. It is located in London fare zone 2.\nHistory\nThe station was first opened by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 2 June 1879, on the main line from London to Birmingham.\nServices on the Bakerloo line were extended from Kilburn Park to Queen's Park on 11 February 1915. On 10 May 1915, Bakerloo services began to operate north of Queen's Park as far as  over the recently built Watford DC line tracks shared with the LNWR.\nLondon Midland previously made three operational calls daily, which were not found in public timetables. As of the December 2013 timetable these stops no longer exist, with no main line services calling at the station.\nStation layout\nof the Bakerloo and Lioness lines at Queen's Park station.]]\nAll platforms at Queen's Park station are on the surface, the station being covered by a glazed roof. The slow main line platforms (platforms 5 and 6) are reserved for use during engineering work or partial line closures. The Bakerloo line tunnel portals are about  to the east of the station. The two inner station tracks, platforms 3 (westbound) and 2 (eastbound), split into four tracks in a carriage shed to the west of the station. Bakerloo line services starting or ending at Queen's Park normally do so in the two centre tracks of the four-track carriage shed. Bakerloo line trains joining or leaving the Watford DC line tracks (also used by the Lioness line) do so by passing through the carriage shed on one of the two outer tracks, which merge into the Watford DC line, the latter of which becomes the station's outer tracks. Around a third of Bakerloo line trains terminate at Queen's Park with others continuing onward to .\nAll platforms are accessed by stairs and although there is local pressure for step-free access there are no firm plans for lifts or escalators to be installed. The stairs are all behind the ticket barriers.\nServices\nQueen's Park is served by the Bakerloo line of the London Underground and the Lioness line of the London Overground. The current off-peak service is:\nLondon Underground (Bakerloo line)\n* 16 tph to\n* 4 tph to\n* 4 tph to\n8 tph from Elephant & Castle terminate at Queen's Park.\nLondon Overground (Lioness line)\n* 4 tph to\n* 4 tph to\n}}\nConnections\nLondon Buses routes 6, 36, 187, 206, and 316 serve the station.\nFuture improvements\nGreat North Western Railway was given permission to run six trains per day from London to  stopping at Queen's Park from 2018, but these plans have yet to come to fruition.\nQueen's Park may be the service's terminus, as stopping patterns including permission to run the service beyond Queen's Park to  are dependent upon future infrastructural work to the West Coast Main Line.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/collections-online/photographs London Transport Museum Photographic Archive]\n**\n**"
