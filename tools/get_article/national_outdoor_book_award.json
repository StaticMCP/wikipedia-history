It is housed at Idaho State University and chaired by Ron Watters. It is sponsored by the National Outdoor Book Awards Foundation, Idaho State University and the Association of Outdoor Recreation and Education. As of 2021, awards have been presented in 13 categories, although not all categories are awarded in any given year.\nThe award is announced in early November of each year. Winning books are promoted nationally and are entitled to display the National Outdoor Book Award gold medallion.\nWinners and honorable mentions (Silver Medals)\n*Small date (2010 vs 2010 ) = Honorable Mention or Silver Medal (Starting in 2021, \"Silver medals\" replaced honorable mentions.
