      "text": "# Goin' to Rockingham__disambig_1\n\n'Goin' To Rockingham' is the fifth album released by surf music band The Surfin' Lungs, released in 2002 on the Spanish label No Tomorrow. This was the most productive longplayer released by the band yet as it contained 17 tracks, three of which were covers: \"The Godfather\", written by Nino Rota for the film of the same name; \"Surfin' Hearse\" had originally been a Jan & Dean song, which had been included on their 1963 album Drag City; \"In The Sun\" was a Blondie song. Rockingham also featured the first lead vocal from Clive Gilling, \"Go Mr Gasser (Go! Go! Go!)\". Overall the album was very similar in style to previous longplayer ''Hang Loose with The Surfin' Lungs'', again epitomising the group's focus on sun, surfing, cars and girls to great effect.\nTrack listing\n# Goin' To Rockingham (Pearce) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# She'd Rather Be With The Sea (Dean) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# Their Car Club (Dean) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# The Godfather (Rota) – Instrumental\n# Where Young Men Go To Cry (Pearce) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# Long Live Summer (Webb, Pearce, Dean) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# Cathy's Little Coupe (Pearce) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# Flashpoint (Dean) – Instrumental\n# There's Something Under the Pier (Pearce, Dean) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# Summertime Radio (Dean) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# Surfin' Hearse (Berry, Christian) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# Never Goin' Back (Dean) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# Lonely Surfer Boy (Dean) – Lead vocals: Chris Pearce\n# Fajitas (Dean) – Instrumental\n# Go Mr Gasser (Go!
