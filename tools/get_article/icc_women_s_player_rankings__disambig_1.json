The rankings include the top 10 WODI and WT20I batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders based on the rating of the each player.\nRanking calculations\nFor the ICC player ranking, the same methods are used for both men and women. The player rankings are a points methods of all player's performance. with recent matches performance effect player's rank. Each match performance is given a rating out of 1000. But 1000 rating was rare achievement. This means that the maximum possible overall rating per person only rating 1000, and a player gaining a rating of 900 is seen as an exceptional achievement. Separate lists are maintained for batting and bowling and an all-rounder rating is also published, which is obtained by multiplying a player's batting and bowling rating together and dividing by 1000. For batting, the performance rating is based on a combination of runs scored, the rating of the opposition bowlers, match result and comparison to the overall scores in the match. A bowler gains points based on wickets taken, runs conceded and match result, with more points gained for dismissing highly rated batsmen. A damping-factor is applied to a player's rating at the start of their career.\nODI rankings\nTop 10 WODI batters\nTop 10 WODI bowlers\nTop 10 WODI all-rounders\nT20I rankings\nTop 10 WT20I Batters\nTop 10 WT20I Bowlers\nTop 10 WT20I All-Rounders\nSee also\n*International cricket\n*ICC Men's Player Rankings\n*Women's cricket\n*Women's One Day International\n*Women's Twenty20 International\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/womens/overview ICC Official site]"
