The series continued as the Trojans moved to the FCS, with the Gamecocks moving to the FCS soon after. The series came to a halt when Troy moved to what is now the FBS. However, with Jacksonville State moving to the FBS and Conference USA in 2023, the rivalry may be renewed again in the near future. The idea for a school bell trophy stemmed from the two schools' common origins as teachers' colleges.\nHistory\nThe two teams first met in 1924 in Jacksonville, Alabama.  The last game was played in 2001. Jacksonville State leads the series 32–29–2.  Troy has won the last seven games of the series, while also going 12–3 since 1983 against the Gamecocks.\nGame results\n| team2 = Troy / Troy State\n| team2style =\n| format = compact | series_summary
