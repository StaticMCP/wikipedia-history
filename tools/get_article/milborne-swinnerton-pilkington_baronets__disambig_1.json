The fifth Baronet was High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1740–41 and sat as member of parliament for Horsham.\nThe eighth Baronet married Mary, daughter and co-heir of Thomas Swinnerton, of Butterton Hall, Staffordshire, by his wife Mary, daughter and heir of Charles Milborne, of Wonastow Court, Monmouthshire. His second son William changed his name to Milborne-Swinnerton by act of Parliament (6 & 7 Will. 4. c. 52), but later resumed the use of the surname of Pilkington in addition to Milborne-Swinnerton by another act of Parliament,which partially revoked the first act (17 & 18 Vict. c. 1).\nSimilarly, Sir William Pilkington's youngest son Lionel, the eleventh Baronet, assumed in 1856 by Royal licence the surname of Milborne-Swinnerton, but later resumed the surname of Pilkington in addition to those of Milborne-Swinnerton by private Act of Parliament (19 & 20 Vict. c. 5).
