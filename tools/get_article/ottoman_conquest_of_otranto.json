This was their first outpost in Italy. According to a traditional account, more than 800 inhabitants were beheaded after the city had been captured.  The Martyrs of Otranto are still celebrated in Italy. A year later, the Ottoman garrison surrendered the city after a siege by Christian forces, bolstered by the intervention of papal forces that were led by Paolo Fregoso of Genoa, and amid uncertainty upon the death of sultan Mehmed II.\nBackground and motive\nIn 1479, the Ottomans proposed an alliance to Venice. The Signoria declined the request. However from Venetian sources, it can be inferred that the Signoria, through Battista Gritti, its new bailo in Istanbul, gave the sultan to understand that it would be his rights in seizing Brindisi, Taranto, and Otranto. While it is impossible to say what extent such declarations contributed to Mehmed's decision to carry out his long-standing plan for a landing in Italy, he acted quickly and resolutely.\nEarly in the summer of 1480, kapudan-i derya Gedik Ahmed Pasha received orders from Mehmed to cross the Strait of Otranto.\nSiege and capture\nOn 28 July, an Ottoman fleet of 128 ships, including 28 galleys, arrived near the Neapolitan city of Otranto. Many of the troops had come from the 1480 Siege of Rhodes. The garrison and the citizens of Otranto retreated to the city's castle. On 11 August, after a 15-day siege, Gedik Ahmed ordered the final assault. When the walls were breached, the Ottomans methodically passed to house to house and sacked, looted and set it on fire. Upon reaching the cathedral, \"they found Archbishop Stefano Agricolo, fully vested and crucifix in hand\" to be awaiting them with Count Francesco Largo, the garrison commander, and Bishop Stefano Pendinelli, who distributed the Eucharist and sat with the women and children of Otranto while a Dominican friar led the faithful in prayer. A total of 12,000 were killed and 5,000 were enslaved, including victims from the territories of the Salentine Peninsula around the city, and the cathedral was turned into a mosque.\nStalled advance\nIn August, 70 ships of the fleet attacked Vieste. On 12 September, the Monastero di San Nicholas di Casole, which had accommodated one of the richer libraries of Europe, was destroyed. By October, attacks had been conducted against the coastal cities of Lecce, Taranto and Brindisi.\nHowever, the lack of supplies made the Ottoman commander, Gedik Ahmed Pasha, unable to consolidate his force's advance. Instead, he returned with most of his troops to Albania and left a garrison of 800 infantry and 500 sipahi behind to defend Otranto. It was assumed that he would return with his army after the winter.\nCatholic response\nSince only 27 years had passed since the Fall of Constantinople, there was some fear that Rome would suffer the same fate. Plans were made for the Pope and the citizens to evacuate the city. Pope Sixtus IV repeated his 1471 call for a crusade. Several Italian city-states, along with Hungary and France, responded positively. The Republic of Venice did not do so, as it had signed an expensive peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1479.\nIn April 1481, Sixtus IV called for an Italian crusade to liberate the city, and Christian forces besieged Otranto in May. An army was raised by King Ferdinand I of Naples, to be led by his son Alfonso, Duke of Calabria. A contingent of troops was provided by King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary.\nRecapture\nBetween August and September, King Ferdinand of Naples, with the help of his cousin Ferdinand the Catholic and the Kingdom of Sicily, attempted to recapture Otranto. The Christian forces besieged the city on 1 May 1481. Mehmed II was preparing for a new campaign in Italy, but died on 3 May. The succession issues prevented the Ottomans from sending reinforcements to Otranto. After negotiation with the Christian forces, the Ottomans surrendered in August, leaving Otranto in September 1481.\nAftermath\nThe number of citizens, which is said to have been nearly 20,000, had decreased to 8,000 by the end of the century.\nThe Ottomans also briefly held Otranto once more after they conquered it in 1537.\nSee also\n* History of Islam in southern Italy\n* Martyrs of Otranto\n* ''Da Vinci's Demons (fictional work, part of which portrays the invasion)\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Hubert Houben, ed.
