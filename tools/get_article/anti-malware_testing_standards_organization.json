Subsequently, a major infrastructural change took place, introducing an executive team with a CEO, CTO, CFO and VPs of Marketing and Strategy in addition to the already existing Board.\nBoard of Directors\nAs of 2023 the Board of Directors constitutes 50% vendor, 50% tester membership and comprises the following:\n* Co-Chair: Luis Corrons (Vendor: Gen)\n* Co-Chair: Simon Edwards (Tester: [https://selabs.uk/ SE Labs])\n* David Ellis (Tester: [https://secureiqlab.com/ SecureIQLab])\n* Vladislav Iliushin (Vendor: [https://ellio.tech/ ELLIO Technology])\n* Jesse Song (Tester: [https://www.skdlabs.com/ SKD Labs])\n* Alexander Vukcevic (Vendor: Gen)\n* Jeffrey Wu (Tester: [https://www.testingground.io/ Testing Ground Labs])\n* Glaucia Young (Vendor: Microsoft)\nMembership\nSource:\nWhile it grew out of discussions between security vendors and security product testing organizations, membership of AMTSO is also open to academics, reviewers, publications, and does include some individual members. However, the high cost of full membership generally discourages individual members and small organizations from joining, and in early 2011, the organization offered a much cheaper subscription rate that didn't, however, offer full voting rights. AMTSO currently offers a two-tier membership model: entity members get full benefits of membership, while individual members get the same benefits apart from the right to vote.\nSecurity tester members have included:\n* AV-Comparatives*\n* AV-Test*\n* Dennis Technology Labs (no longer operating)\n* ICSA Labs* (no longer operating)\n* MRG Effitas\n* NSS Labs (no longer operating)\n* SDK Labs*\n* SE Labs*\n* SecureIQLab\n* Testing Ground Labs\n* Virus Bulletin*\n* West Coast Labs* (no longer operating)\nEach of these labs is accepted by Microsoft as an \"industry standard organization\" for the purposes of independent certification.\nMembership controversy\nSome members of the wider security community and even testers have raised issue with the organization's membership, which includes a preponderance of security vendors. This has led to some tester members leaving and then sometimes rejoining the organization.\nTester member NSS Labs sued AMTSO, as well as CrowdStrike, ESET and Symantec, in an anti-trust case that was later dismissed. Shortly thereafter NSS Labs ceased operation.\nWork\nThe organization has created some potentially useful resources for testers, including a page that flags relevant papers and other resources outside AMTSO, and a repository of guidelines documents for the benefit of aspiring testers on a wide range of topics. Another popular freely available resource is the Security Features Check, which attempts to download a faux malicious file to a desktop or Android device. This is a simple test to ensure that basic anti-malware standards are implemented on the test device.\nIt also organizes workshops three times a year: discussion and generation of guidelines documents are a major by-product of these sessions.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.amtso.org/ AMTSO main site]\n* [https://twitter.com/AMTSO Twitter account]\n* [http://www.facebook.com/?ref=logo#!/pages/Anti-Malware-Testing-Standards-Organization/229454111861 Facebook page]"
