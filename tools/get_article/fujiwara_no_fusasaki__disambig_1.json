He served as Sangi (Associate Counselor) in the Imperial Court.\nCareer\nFusasaki was a Sangi (associate counselor) in the Daijō-kan.\nHe founded the temple of Sugimoto-dera in Kamakura in 734 with the priest Gyōki (668–749). The temple's legend holds that Empress Komyo (701–760) in the Nara Period (710–794) instructed Fusasaki, the then high-ranking minister, and a famous priest named Gyoki (668–749) to build the temple enshrining a statue of Eleven-Headed Kan'non, or Ekādaśamukha in Sanskrit, as the main object of worship. Priest Gyoki fashioned the statue himself because he was also a great sculptor.\nFusasaki and his three brothers died during a major smallpox epidemic in 737.\nFamily\n*Father: Fujiwara no Fuhito (藤原不比等, 659–720)\n*Mother: Soga no Shōshi (蘇我娼子, ?–?), daughter of Soga no Murajiko (蘇我連子)\n*'Main-wife (seishitsu): Muro no O-Okimi (牟漏女王, ?–746), daughter of Minu-Ō (美努王)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white\"\n|-\n!Order!!Name!!Japanese!!Lifetime\n|-\n|2nd son||Fujiwara no Nagate||藤原永手||714–771\n|-\n|3rd son||Fujiwara no Matate||藤原真楯||715–766\n|-\n|6th son||Fujiwara no Mitate||藤原御楯|| ? –764\n|-\n|daughter||wife of Emperor Shōmu||北殿|| ? –760\n|}\n*Wife: Daughter of Kusagunokura no Oyu (春日倉老)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white\"\n|-\n!Order!!Name!!Japanese!!Lifetime\n|-\n|1st son||Fujiwara no Torikai||藤原鳥養|| ? – ?\n|}\n*Wife: Daughter of Katano no Ason (片野朝臣)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white\"\n|-\n!Order!!Name!!Japanese!!Lifetime\n|-\n|4th son||Fujiwara no Kiyokawa||藤原清河|| 706–778\n|-\n|5th son||Fujiwara no Uona||藤原魚名||721–783\n|}\n*Wife: Daughter of (阿波采)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white\"\n|-\n!Order!!Name!!Japanese!!Lifetime\n|-\n|7th son||Fujiwara no Kaedemaro||藤原楓麻呂||723–776\n|}\n*Children with unknown mother:'\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white\"\n|-\n!Order!!Name!!Japanese!!Lifetime\n|-\n|daughter||wife of Fujiwara no Toyonari||藤原豊成室|| ? – ?\n|-\n|daughter||Fujiwara no Ohirako||藤原宇比良古|| ? – 762\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\n* Brinkley, Frank and Dairoku Kikuchi.
