Examining colonial morphology is the first step in the identification of an unknown microbe. The systematic assessment of the colonies' appearance, focusing on aspects like size, shape, colour, opacity, and consistency, provides clues to the identity of the organism, allowing microbiologists to select appropriate tests to provide a definitive identification.\nProcedure\nWhen a specimen arrives in the microbiology laboratory, it is inoculated  into an agar plate and placed in an incubator to encourage microbial growth. Because the appearance of microbial colonies changes as they grow, colonial morphology is examined at a specific time after the plate is inoculated. Usually, the plate is read at 18–24 hours post-inoculation, but times may differ for slower-growing organisms like fungi. The microbiologist examines the appearance of the colony, noting specific features such as size, colour, shape, consistency, and opacity. A hand lens or magnifying glass may be used to view colonies in greater detail.\nThe opacity of a microbial colony can be described as transparent, translucent, or opaque. Staphylococci are usually opaque, while many Streptococcus species are translucent. The overall shape of the colony may be characterized as circular, irregular, or punctiform (like pinpoints). The vertical growth or elevation of the colony, another identifying characteristic, is assessed by tilting the agar plate to the side and is denoted as flat, raised, convex, pulvinate (very convex), umbilicate (having a depression in the centre) or umbonate (having a bump in the centre). The edge of the colony may be separately described using terms like smooth, rough, irregular and filamentous. Bacillus anthracis is notable for its filamentous appearance, which is sometimes described as resembling Medusa's head.\nConsistency is examined by physically manipulating the colony with a sterile instrument. It is described using terms like brittle, creamy, sticky and dry. Staphylococci are considered to have a creamy consistency, while some Neisseria species are sticky, and colonies of diphtheroid bacteria and beta-hemolytic streptococci are typically dry. Bacteria that produce capsules often have a slimy (mucoid) consistency.\nWhen certain microorganisms are grown on blood agar, they may digest the blood in the medium, causing visible hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) on the agar plate. In colonial morphology, hemolysis is classified into three types: alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolysis. In alpha-hemolysis, the blood is partially digested, causing the area around the colony to turn green. In beta-hemolysis, the organism digests the blood completely, leaving a clear area around each colony. Organisms that do not produce hemolysis are referred to as gamma-hemolytic. Clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene, is noteworthy for producing a \"double zone\" of both complete and  incomplete hemolysis.\nThe odour of a culture is sometimes considered part of colonial morphology. While intentionally smelling microbial cultures is not advised, some organisms produce distinctive odours that can be detected during routine examination of the culture. Among these are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has a grape-like scent; Staphylococcus aureus, which is said to smell like old socks; and Proteus mirabilis, whose scent is alternately described as putrid or like chocolate cake.\nOther distinctive features of colonial morphology include motility and the production of pigments. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces the pigments pyocyanin and pyoverdin, which give the colonies a greenish sheen. Some specimens of Serratia marcescens produce an orange-red pigment called prodigiosin.  Organisms with swarming motility, like Proteus species, exhibit concentric waves of growth extending from the inoculation point.\n| File:Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield Group A) on Columbia Horse Blood Agar.jpg\n| alt2=\n| Streptococcus pyogenes: small translucent colonies displaying beta-hemolysis on blood agar\n| File:S._pneumoniae.jpg\n| alt3=\n| Streptococcus pneumoniae: small colonies with raised edges displaying alpha-hemolysis on blood agar\n| File:Proteus swarming on blood agar.jpg\n| alt4=\n| Proteus sp.: swarming behaviour on blood agar\n|File:Serratia marcescens pigment cropped and balanced.jpg\n|alt5=\n|Serratia marcescens: red pigmentation: although considered characteristic of the species, only about 10% of specimens produce this pigment\n|File:Bacillus cereus Columbia-Blutagar 074.jpg\n|alt6=\n|Bacillus cereus:  colonies displaying beta-hemolysis on blood agar\n| File:Aspergillus niger 2.jpg\n| alt7=\n| Aspergillus niger: granular colonies with a white edge and central black pigmentation\n}}\nInterpretation\nColonial morphology serves as the first step in the identification of microbial species from clinical samples.\n}}\nSee also\n*Bacterial cellular morphologies—the microscopic appearance of bacterial cells\nExternal links\n*[https://asm.org/Image-Gallery/Colony-Morphology Colony Morphology Image Gallery] at the American Society for Microbiology"
