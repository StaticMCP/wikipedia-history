Bakht Khan a former shubedar in the company's army with the Bareilly brigade which had mutinied and murdered its officers had joined the rebellion consisted of 4 infantry regiments and one cavalry regiment, a horse battery, and two post guns, which marched from Bareilly and crossed Yamuna to enter Delhi. He arrived at Delhi in late June. Khan presented himself to the Emperor, and assumed the command of all rebel forces inside the Fort of Delhi.\nBattle\nOn 3 July, during the night, the British infantry and artillery was reverse sloped beyond the ridge, the cavalry was positioned in front to prevent any future reliefs in the city. Noticing this opportunity, Bakht Khan planned an attack on the cavalry, he sent his sepoys during the night at the British Cavalry posts. He sent his contingent to strike on the camps near the fortress. The only force in those camps were 450 men from the 9th lancers under Colonel Hope Grant,an irregular force of mounted infantry under William Hodson (not more than 50 men), and a handful of cavaliers from the Guides Cavalry of Punjab. After hearing the attack on the first camps, the British were alerted and picked their arms and raced against time to stop the rebels from capturing other posts. Once the alarm spread to the ridge, infantry regiments (the 60th Rifles and Gurkhas) were sent forward to support the cavalry. With infantry and artillery reinforcement, the British pushed the rebels back across the Yamuna. Heavy losses were inflicted on the retreating Bareilly force.\nAftermath\nAfter the alarm the British were able to control the strike and repel it, and forced the rebels to retreat. It was a morale victory for the mutineers while they suffered heavy losses, about 500 mutineers were wounded and killed. The British lost 8-10 tents which would not be more than 80 men. It was the first major offensive engagement since the siege had begun.\nReferences"
