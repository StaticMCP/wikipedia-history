Originally named after Charles Chree, the British physicist and former President of the Physical Society of London, it was renamed in 2008 to commemorate Edward Victor Appleton, winner of the Nobel Prize for proving the existence of the ionosphere.\nHistory\nThe prize was established in 1941 by Chree's sister, Jessie, after his death, and it was originally awarded biennially. It was first awarded to Sydney Chapman. From 2001 it was awarded annually. After the 2008 renaming the prize was awarded in even-dated years until 2016, then as and when required.\nThe cash prize part of the award has risen in value since its inception, reported at £150 in 1985 and £300 in 1987, to its present-day value of £1000.\nWinners\nRecipients of the Appleton medal and prize\n*2024 Nicolas Bellouin\n*2021 Philip Stier\n*2020 Adam Scaife\n*2019 Cathryn Mitchell\n*2016 Giles Harrison\n*2014 David Marshall\n*2012 Colin O'Dowd\n*2010 Myles Allen\n*2008 Ann Wintle\nRecipients of the Chree medal and prize\n*2007      Michele Dougherty\n*2006      David Gubbins\n*2005      Barbara Maher\n*2004      Joanna Dorothy Haigh\n*2003      Michael Lockwood\n*2002\n*2001      Joseph Charles Farman, Brian Gerard Gardiner and Jonathan David Shanklin\n*1999       and\n*1997      John Michael David Coey\n*1995\n*1993      Alan Hugh Cook\n*1991      Lance Thomas\n*1989      John Nye\n*1987      Brian John Hoskins\n*1985      Adrian Edmund Gill\n*1983      William John Granville Beynon\n*1981      Keith Anthony Browning\n*1979      John Theodore Houghton\n*1977      Drummond Hoyle Matthews and Frederick John Vine\n*1975      Raymond Hide\n*1973      David Robert Bates\n*1971      Desmond George King-Hele\n*1969      Stanley Keith Runcorn\n*1967      John Herbert Chapman\n*1965      Basil John Mason\n*1963      Maurice Neville Hill\n*1961      Scott Ellsworth Forbush\n*1959      Reginald Cockcroft Sutcliffe\n*1957      Edward C Bullard\n*1955      David Forbes Martyn\n*1953      Julius Bartels\n*1951      George C Simpson\n*1949      Gordon Miller Bourne Dobson\n*1947      Edward V Appleton\n*1945      John Adam Fleming\n*1943      Basil Ferdinand Jamieson Schonland\n*1941      Sydney Chapman\n}}\nSee also\n* Institute of Physics Awards\n* List of physics awards\n* List of awards named after people\nReferences"
