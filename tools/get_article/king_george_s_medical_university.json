The medical school was raised to a university by an act passed by the government of Uttar Pradesh on 16 September 2002. It is the only government medical institution to have been awarded the NAAC A++ grade in the state of Uttar Pradesh.\nThe university has about 1250 undergraduate students (including 280 dental students) and 450 postgraduate students.\nAbout 250 students a year are admitted to the four-and-a-half-year course of study for the degree of M.B.B.S.\nHistory\nKing George's Medical College (University) was founded on the initiative of His Highness Raja Sir Tassaduq Rasul Khan, , of Jahangirabad Raj, United Provinces.  to commemorate the 1905 visit to India of King George V. The foundation stone was laid by King George V in 1906; the first session started in October 1911, and the hospital's construction was completed in 1913 at a total cost of ₹30 lakhs. The first batch of students qualified as doctors in 1916, and the college remained affiliated with Allahabad University until 1921, after which it was attached to Lucknow University, Government of the United Provinces.\nIn 2002 the Government of Uttar Pradesh, led by Mayawati of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), granted university status the college and renamed it Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (CSMMU), under the Uttar Pradesh Chhatrapati Shahuji Medical University Act, 2002. In August 2003 Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP) replaced Mayawati and became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Two months later, in October 2003, the name of the university was changed to King George's Medical University (KGMU) by the Uttar Pradesh Chhartrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (Second Amendment) Act, 2003.\nName-changing continued. In 2007, after the BSP won the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election and Mayawati returned to office, the name of the institution reverted to CSMMU. When control returned to the SP in the 2012 election, Akhilesh Yadav's government returned the name of the university the current \"King George Medical University\".\nSimilar changes occurred for the dental faculty. The faculty was established in 1949 as a section of the ENT department; raised to a separate department in 1950, it moved to a new building in 1952. When the university was established in 2002, the dental department became the Dental College, a constituent college of the university. Two years later, under the Uttar Pradesh King George's University of Dental Science Act, 2004, the Dental College was raised to the status of a state university named the \"U.P. King George’s University of Dental Science\". In 2007, the government reverted this decision and the U.P. King George's University of Dental Science again became simply a Faculty of Dental Sciences, as it was at the establishment of the university.\nAfter getting university status, it also worked as an affiliating university for some colleges till academic year 2021-2022 when colleges affiliated to the university were taken over by newly established Atal Bihari Vajpayee Medical University.\nFaculties and institutes\n* Faculty of Medical Sciences\n* Faculty of Dental Sciences\n* Institute of Paramedical Sciences\n* Institute of Nursing\nUndergraduate courses\nThe college offers the four-and-a-half-year M.B.B.S. course with a one-year compulsory rotating internship.
