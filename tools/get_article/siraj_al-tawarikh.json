The author was an Afghan court chronicler and secretary in the court of Amir Habibullah Khan from 1901 to 1919.\nThe book was written on the idea of Amir's commission. The first was a history of Afghanistan entitled Toḥfat al-ḥabīb (Ḥabīb’s gift) in honor of the amir, but Ḥabīb-Allāh Khan deemed the finished work unacceptable and ordered Fayż Moḥammad to start over. The revised version is the three-volume history of Afghanistan entitled Serāj al-tawārī (Lamp of Histories), an allusion to the amir’s honorific “Lamp of the Nation and Religion” (Serāj al-mella wal-dīn). There were also problems in publishing it, the third volume never being completely printed.\nBook link\n*[http://afghanistandl.nyu.edu/pdf/adl0009/ADL0009_Siraj_translation_vol2_complete.pdfa The second volume of Siraj Al Tawarikh]\n*[http://afghanistandl.nyu.edu/pdf/adl0009/ADL0009_Siraj_translation_vol3_378-572_complete.pdfa The third volume of Siraj Al Tawarikh]\nReferences"
