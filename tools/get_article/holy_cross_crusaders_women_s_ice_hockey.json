The Crusaders are the newest member of the Hockey East Association (HEA). They play at the Hart Center in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nHistory\nHoly Cross women's ice hockey became a varsity sport in 1999, after ten years as a club sport and two years as semi-varsity team.   They joined the ECAC East conference, which later became the New England Hockey Conference (NEHC).\nJane Ford, former director of telecommunications for Holy Cross, served as head coach for the inaugural season. Then Peter VanBuskirk took over as head coach in the 2000–01 season, after having coached the Holy Cross men's ice hockey team for ten years. He was head coach for the women's team for nineteen years.\nHoly Cross finished first in their conference in the 2008–09 season, with a 24-2-1 record, and won the ECAC Open Championship against Sacred Heart by a score of 4-2. They had six post-season titles while playing in the ECAC East/NEHC: 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016.\nAfter two years of discussions with the Hockey East Association, Holy Cross joined the conference for the 2018–19 season. They were the 10th team to join the conference.\nHoly Cross earned their first Hockey East win on November 30, 2018, in a 5–3 victory against the powerhouse Northeastern Huskies. Jada Brenon, the team's freshman goalie, made 34 saves in the win, which was played at home at the Hart Center.\nIn 2019, VanBuskirk retired as head coach. After nineteen seasons with the women's team, he finished with a record of 295-178-35. He was elected as an honorary member of the Holy Cross Athletic Hall of Fame in 2020.\nKatie Lachapelle stepped in as head coach in 2019–20, after serving as the associate head coach for two years. Prior to coming to Holy Cross, she had been assistant coach at Boston University for nine seasons. She has also been an assistant coach at Ohio State, Niagara, and Union. Lachapelle graduated from Providence College, where she played for the Friars. She was captain in her senior year and was on the ECAC All Star Team in 1997. In May 2020, Lachapelle was named as the head coach for the United States women's national under-18 ice hockey team.  The IIHF subsequently canceled the 2021 U-18 Women's World Championships that had been scheduled to take place in January 2021.\nMeredith Roth joined the coaching staff as associate coach for the Crusaders in 2019, after serving as the head coach for the Green Knights women's ice hockey program at St. Norbert's College, in Division III NCAA ice hockey. Devan Taylor joined the coaching staff as assistant coach in 2020.\nIn the 2019–2020 season, the Crusaders recorded their first Hockey East series sweep, against the Merrimack Warriors. They finished the season in 9th place, with a 5-23-5 overall record.\nThe start of the 2020–21 season was delayed due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  A modified schedule was released by the Hockey East Association in early November 2020, based on discussions by the Hockey East's Return to Play Task Force. Hockey East women's ice hockey teams, including Holy Cross, are scheduled to play 18 games that will count towards the final league standings. The Crusaders played their first series of the new season against the Maine Black Bears, on home ice, from November 20–21. Holy Cross lost the first match-up by a score of 2-1 but won the second game by a score of 3-2.\nThe team's co-captains for the 2020–2021 season are Carlie Magier, Antonia Matzuka, and Julia Pelletier.\nSeason-by-season results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|bgcolor=\"#FFF3BF\"|National Champions\n|bgcolor=\"#d0e7ff\"|Conference Champions\n|bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"|Lost Championship\n|bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\"|League Leader\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\" | style=\";\"\n| Season || Coach || W || L || T || Conference || Conf.
