He attended Washington State College at Pullman. In 1910, D'Ewart moved to Wilsall, Montana, where he settled in Park County. Before entering politics, D'Ewart worked in ranching and for the Forest Service.\nPolitical career\nThroughout his career, D’Ewart was a staunch member of the Republican Party. In 1936, D’Ewart was elected to the Montana House of Representatives. He served there for three years, then was elected to the Montana Senate in 1940. D’Ewart served in the Senate from 1941 to 1945.\nWhen United States Congressman James F. O'Connor, who represented Montana's 2nd congressional district died on January 15, 1945, a special election was held to replace him, which D'Ewart won. He was re-elected in 1946 against Democratic nominee John J. Holmes by a wide margin, and in 1948, he defeated Willard E. Fraser to narrowly win re-election. D'Ewart was re-elected in 1950 and 1952 against John J. Holmes.\nRather than seek re-election, D'Ewart ran for the United States Senate against incumbent Democratic Senator James E. Murray in 1954. Following a close and contentious election, Murray narrowly defeated D'Ewart to win his final term in the Senate.\nD'Ewart served as an assistant to the United States Secretary of Agriculture from January 1955 to September 1955. He was in charge of lands and reclamation. He was Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior from October 1955 to July 1956.  From August 1956 to October 1958 he was a special representative for the Secretary of Agriculture.\nWhen incumbent Governor J. Hugo Aronson declined to seek reelection as Governor of Montana in 1960, D'Ewart ran to succeed him, and lost to former State Senator Donald Grant Nutter in the Republican primary by fewer than five hundred votes. (Nutter went on to win the general election.)\nPublications\n* D'Ewart, Wesley Abner. Promoting the interests of the Fort Fall Indian irrigation project, Idaho.
