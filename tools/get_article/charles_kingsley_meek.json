He wrote about the northern and southern tribes of Nigeria and studied the Jukun people. Meek took photographs during some of his field work.\nBiography\nMeek was born in Ballyloran, Larne, on 24 June 1885.  He was educated at Bedford School and at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he studied theology. In 1912 he joined the colonial administrative service and was posted in northern Nigeria in 1912, where he became a District Officer and anthropologist. He was made Government Anthropologist under governor-general Frederick Lugard who sought to extend his policy of indirect rule south and wanted to know more about local practice. Meek attained the rank of Resident and transferred to the southern provinces of Nigeria in 1929 before resigning due to health issues in 1933.\nIn 1925, he published The Northern Tribes of Nigeria, which became a classic of African anthropology. His Sudanese Kingdom (1931), a study of the Jukun people and divine kingship, is a significant work of ethnography. In his book Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe published in 1937, Meek offers an anthropological study on the social organization of the Ibo tribe of Southern Nigeria.\nHe did scholarly research with R. R. Marett and C. G. Seligman. He was a fellow in the Royal Geographical Society and Royal Anthropological Institute which awarded him its Wellcome Medal.\nIn 1943, Meek was elected as a senior research fellow at Brasenose College, Oxford. He retired in 1950 and died in Eastbourne on 27 March 1965.\nWorks\n* The Northern Tribes of Nigeria.
