As with other Alfonso Brescia productions of the time, it reuses scenes from other 1960s peplum films. According to screenwriter Vittorio Vighi,  the Terence Hill and Bud Spencer duo was the inspiration for the characters played by Don Backy and Peter Landers.\nRelease\nThe film was released in Italian cinemas on 21 November 1972.\nReception\nItalian film critic Marco Giusti described it as funny and better than expected. According to Derek Elley, it is a film that \"with its floating morality, picaresque leads, arena scenes, convenient baptism and final miracle, satirises the popular aspects of the [epic] genre\". Paolo Mereghetti described it as \"a failed attempt to mix a parody of the sword-and-sandal genre, the spaghetti western fistfights, and a bit of sexy comedy\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
