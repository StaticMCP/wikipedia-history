The chain started in 1956, in Brockton, Massachusetts.  They expanded to 187 stores (three stores operated in the Buffalo, New York area). In 1978, they purchased the bankrupt Mammoth Mart chain. Because of the economic downturn and the debt from the Mammoth purchase, they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1982.  In 1984 Ames Department Stores purchased the chain and converted most of them into Ames stores.  Ames went out of business in 2002.\nRetail chains acquired by King's\n*Barker's Discount Department Stores (1980)\n*Mammoth Mart (1977)\n*Miracle Mart (1968) United States based chain, not to be confused with the Canadian chain by the same name\n* Sandy's Discount Stores (1966)\n* Welles (1973)\nReferences"
