(), is Bosnia and Herzegovina commission (agency) which declares and registers national heritage monuments/sites, including natural/urban/architectural assembles, immovable and movable heritage of historical and cultural importance to Bosnia and Herzegovina, as an institution at state level.\nThe sites of exclusively natural heritage are not subject of Annex 8 and the KONS.\nBackground and history\nIn the period from the end of World War II to the declaration of independance of Bosnia and Herzegovina form former Yugoslavia in 1992, protected cultural and natural assets were declared based on following legal acts:\n* the Law on the Protection of Cultural Monuments and Natural Rarities (''Official Gazette of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina No. 19/1947),\n* the Law on Nature Protection (Official Gazette of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina No. 4/1965),\n* the Law on the Protection and Use of Cultural, Historical and Natural Heritage (Official Gazette of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina No. 20/1985 and 12/1987).\nDecisions on the protection of cultural assets and natural areas were made by the State Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments and Natural Rarities from Sarajevo (Državni zavod za zaštitu spomenika kulture i prirodnih rijetkosti, Sarajevo), later renamed as the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Zavod za zaštitu spomenika kulture Bosne i Hercegovine). The laws on the declaration of Sutjeska and Kozara as national parks, NP Sutjeska and NP Kozara, were passed by the Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nOn 23 July 1945, immediately after the World War II, the Law on the Protection of Cultural Monuments and Natural Rarities was passed, which was amended and supplemented the following year (published in the Official Gazette of the FNRJ on 8 October 1946) as the General Law on the Protection of Cultural Monuments and Natural Rarities. Within the framework of this general law, the Law on the Protection of Cultural Monuments and Natural Rarities of Bosnia and Herzegovina was also passed (published in the Official Gazette of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina No. 18/1947'' of 30 April 1947). In accordance with the Law of 23 July 1945, by decision of the Ministry of Education of the Peoples' Government of BiH No. 4977 of 19 September 1945, the Land's Institute for the Protection and Scientific Study of Cultural Monuments and Natural Rarities of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established at the Land's Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo. By a later decision of the same Ministry, number 3115 of 26 February 1946, two separate bodies were established at the National Museum, namely the National Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the National Institute for the Protection of Nature of the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nEstablishment and legal scope\nIn accordance with Annex 8 of Dayton Agreement and Act concerning the Commission to Preserve National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina passed by Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina on December 21, 2001, KONS is an institution at state level which declares and registers national heritage monuments/sites, including natural/urban/architectural assembles, immovable and movable heritage of historical and cultural importance to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
