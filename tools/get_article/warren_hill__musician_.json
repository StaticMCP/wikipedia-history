Record producer Russ Titelman, who was in the audience, invited him to record on an album by Chaka Khan. After moving to Los Angeles, he signed with RCA in 1989 and recorded his debut album, Kiss Under the Moon. He supported Natalie Cole on tour for her album Unforgettable and had a hit in 1993 with the song \"The Passion Theme\" from the movie Body of Evidence.\nIn the smooth jazz format his number one hits include \"Our First Dance\", \"Do You Feel What I'm Feeling\", \"Mambo 2000\", \"Tamara\", \"Still in Love\", La Dolce Vita\", \"Promises\", \"Take Out Dreams\", \"Tears in Heaven\", \"Another Goodbye\", \"Tell Me All Your Secrets\", \"You Are the One\", and \"Turn Out the Lights\". Warren and his wife Tamara VanCleef-Hill wrote and produced the song \"Shelter from the Storm\". He was featured on the song  \"Tell Me What You Dream\" by Restless Heart and \"Baby I Love Your Way\" by Big Mountain. He appeared on the television show Top of the Pops on the BBC in England. Hill founded a smooth jazz cruise in 2004. He is also the host and owner of the Cancun Jazz Festival, has established his brand of instruments, and co-founded the label, Songbird Records.\nHis album Devotion came out in 1993 and Truth a year later. By 1997, he had switched to Discovery, which released Shelter (1997) and Life Thru Rose Colored Glasses (1998). Love Life (2000) was released by Narada, followed by Love Songs and A Warren Hill Christmas in 2002 and PopJazz in 2005. In 2008, he signed with Koch, which issued La Dolce Vita in June that year.\nInstruments\nOn the alto saxophone he uses Blue Jumbo Java mouthpiece from Vandoren which sounds sharp and dry. Since Vandoren stopped producing Blue Jumbo Java mouthpieces, the price of them second-hand has risen sharply.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Title\n! colspan=\"2\"|Chart\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"35\"| US Jazz\n! width=\"35\"| US Con.
