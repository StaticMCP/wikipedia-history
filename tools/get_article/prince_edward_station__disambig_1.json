It is located under the intersection of Nathan Road and Prince Edward Road West, after which it is named.\nHistory\nPrince Edward was primarily designed as a cross-platform interchange between the Kwun Tong and s. While the Kwun Tong line tracks had already been built in 1979, the station was not used until the opening of the Tsuen Wan line on 10 May 1982. During the first week of operation, the station served only as an interchange with no exits to the concourse or street level. On 17 May 1982, all the station's exits were opened.\nPrince Edward station attack\nOn the evening of 31 August 2019, amid the anti-extradition bill protests, the Hong Kong Police stormed Prince Edward station and were filmed beating passengers and firing pepper spray inside railway carriages. The MTR closed the station during the incident, while the police refused to let medics enter. The station subsequently became a flashpoint for continued discord, with protesters petitioning MTR to release CCTV footage from the evening of 31 August. The incident at Prince Edward, as well as MTR's perceived support of Beijing (by closing stations near protests in the aftermath of criticism by Chinese state media for remaining operational), led to vandalism of other MTR stations. MTR condemned the vandalism and responded that the relevant CCTV footage would be kept for three years.\nLocation\nPrince Edward station and Mong Kok station are the two closest stations in Hong Kong. They are only  apart, trains take less than one minute to travel from one station to the other.\nStation layout\n{|border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;width:50px;vertical-align:top;\"|G\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:100px;vertical-align:top;\"|Ground level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:500px;vertical-align:top;\"|Exits\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=3|L1\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=3|Concourse\n|Customer Service, MTRshops\n|-\n|Vending machines, Automatic teller machines\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Octopus Promotion Machine\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=3|L2Platform\n|Platform\n|  towards  () →\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform, doors will open on the right\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Platform\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|←  towards  ()\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=4|L3Platform\n|Platform\n|←  Tsuen Wan line towards  (Mong Kok)\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform, doors will open on the left\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Platform\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|  Kwun Tong line towards  () →\n|}\nPrince Edward is an opposite-directional cross-platform interchange station for the southbound Kwun Tong line passengers going towards  and the southbound Tsuen Wan line passengers going towards . Mong Kok serves as the cross-platform interchange station for passengers travelling in the same direction.\nLivery\nThe station's colour is light purple because of its association as a regal colour.\nEntrances and exits\nAll exits are within one block of Nathan Road, stretching from Prince Edward Road in the south to Playing Field Road in the north.
