They inflicted another defeat on the Ghaznavids in 1037 at Merv and Herat.\nThe Seljuk Turks crossed the Oxus river and occupied most of Khorasan. In 1038 the Seljuks decisively defeated the Ghazanvids who were led by Mesud, son of Mahmud, at Nishapur.\nThe victories of the Seljuks against the Ghaznavids continued at Sarakhs and Dandanaqan. Members of the Seljuk family conducted additional aggressive campaigns in order to collect booty and check their rivals.\nReferences"
