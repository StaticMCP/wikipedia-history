A Nogai named Devey, who arrived in Crimea, stated that: }}\nThe defeat of the Altyuly Horde of the Nogais in the Aral region by the troops of Khakk-Nazar Khan indicates significant changes in the region. Apparently, the Horde lost its former rulers, who were forced to leave these lands. Some of the eastern Nogais likely became part of the Kazakh Khanate. Based on this data, it can be assumed that the defeat of the Altyuly Horde took place in the summer of 1570, although it is possible that the event occurred earlier and news of it reached contemporaries with the typical delay of that time.\nIn 1570, Khakk-Nazar Khan defeated the Altyuly, after which some of them migrated to the Nogais on the Yaik River. Ak-Murza admitted that he had been expelled from his \"ancestral yurt\".\nReferences"
