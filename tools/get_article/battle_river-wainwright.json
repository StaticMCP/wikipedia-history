      "text": "# Battle River-Wainwright\n\nBattle River-Wainwright was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first-past-the-post method of voting from 2004 to 2019.\nHistory\nThe electoral district was created in the 2003 electoral boundary re-distribution primarily out of the old electoral district of Wainwright which had been in existence since the 1913 boundary redistribution.\nThe 2010 electoral boundary re-distribution saw significant changes to the district with Paintearth County being moved into Drumheller-Stettler. The district also lost land to Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville that was south of Tofield, Alberta within Beaver County. However land was gained from three other electoral divisions that resided within Camrose County.\nPrior to the 2019 election this district was disbanded to make the Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright district.\nBoundary history\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n!colspan=4|47 Battle River-Wainwright 2003 boundaries\n|-\n!colspan=4|Bordering districts\n|-\n!North\n!East\n!West\n!South\n|-\n|Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville, Leduc-Beaumont-Devon and Vermilion-Lloydminster\n|Saskatchewan boundary\n|Drumheller-Stettler, Lacombe-Ponoka and Wetaskiwin-Camrose\n|Drumheller-Stettler\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=center|riding map goes here\n|colspan=2 align=center|\n|-\n!colspan=4|Legal description from\n|-\n|colspan=4|Starting at the east boundary of Rge. 19 W4 (Highway 834) with the north boundary of Twp. 47;

Since 1971 Progressive Conservative candidates had been returned to office here with large majorities.\nThe current incumbent and only representative so far is Doug Griffiths who was first elected in a 2002 by-election. He won the new district and his second term with a landslide majority which he also increased in the next election. In 2011 Griffiths was appointed to the cabinet in the government of Premier Allison Redford.\nLegislative election results\n2004\n2008\n2012\n2015\nSenate nominee election results\n2004\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"5\" align=center|2004 Senate nominee election results: Battle River-Wainwright\n| colspan=\"2\"|Turnout 48.33%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\"| Affiliation\n|Candidate\n|Votes\n|% votes\n|% ballots\n|Rank\n|Independent\n|Link Byfield\n|2,632\n|9.83%\n|31.62%\n|4\n|Michael Roth\n|2,374\n|8.86%\n|28.52%\n|7\n|Gary Horan\n|2,049\n|7.65%\n|24.61%\n|10\n|Vance Gough\n|2,044\n|7.63%\n|24.55%\n|8\n|Independent\n|Tom Sindlinger\n|1,208\n|4.50%\n|14.51%\n|9\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Total votes\n|26,790\n|colspan=\"3\"|100%\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Total ballots\n|8,325\n|colspan=\"3\"|3.22 votes per ballot\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Rejected, spoiled and declined\n|colspan=\"4\"|1,608\n|}\nVoters had the option of selecting four candidates on the ballot\nStudent vote results\n2004\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=right\n!Participating schools\n|-\n|Autumn Leaf School\n|-\n|Central High Sedgewick Public School\n|-\n|Coronation School\n|-\n|Daysland School\n|-\n|Dr. Folkins Community School\n|-\n|Edgerton Public School\n|-\n|Forestburg School\n|-\n|Lougheed School\n|-\n|Provost Public school\n|-\n|Saint Thomas Aquinas School\n|}\nOn November 19, 2004, a student vote was conducted at participating Alberta schools to parallel the 2004 Alberta general election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"|2004 Alberta student vote results\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"| Affiliation\n|Candidate\n|Votes\n|%\n|Liberal\n|Gordon Rogers\n|68\n|8.38%\n|Social Credit\n|Robin Skitteral\n|22\n|2.71%\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align =\"right\"|Total\n|811\n|100%\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Rejected, spoiled and declined\n|colspan=\"2\"|38\n|}\n2012\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|colspan=\"5\" align=center|2012 Alberta student vote results\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"| Affiliation\n|Candidate\n|Votes\n|%\n|Liberal\n|Amber Greenleese\n|\n|%\n|NDP\n|\n|\n|%\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Total\n|\n|100%\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Alberta provincial electoral districts\n* Canadian provincial electoral districts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.electionsalberta.ab.ca/ Elections Alberta]\n*[http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ The Legislative Assembly of Alberta]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150506055103/http://battleriver-wainwright.wildrose.ca/wes_taylor Website of Wes Taylor Wildrose MLA for Battle River-Wainwright]"
