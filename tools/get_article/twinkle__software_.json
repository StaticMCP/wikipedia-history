For call signaling it employs the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). It also features direct IP-to-IP calls. Media streams are transmitted via the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) which may be encrypted with the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) and the ZRTP security protocols.\nSince version 1.3.2 (September 2008), Twinkle supports message exchange and a buddy-list feature for presence notification, showing the online-status of predefined communications partners (provider-support needed).\nSupported audio formats\n* G.711 A-law: 64&nbsp;kbit/s payload, 8&nbsp;kHz sampling rate\n* G.711 μ-law: 64&nbsp;kbit/s payload, 8&nbsp;kHz sampling rate\n* G.726: 16, 24, 32 or 40&nbsp;kbit/s payload, 8&nbsp;kHz sampling rate\n* GSM: 13&nbsp;kbit/s payload, 8&nbsp;kHz sampling rate\n* G.729: 8&nbsp;kbit/s payload, 8&nbsp;kHz sampling rate\n* iLBC: 13.3 or 15.2&nbsp;kbit/s payload, 8&nbsp;kHz sampling rate\n* Speex narrow band: 15.2&nbsp;kbit/s payload, 8&nbsp;kHz sampling rate\n* Speex wide band: 28&nbsp;kbit/s payload, 16&nbsp;kHz sampling rate\n* Speex ultra wide band: 36&nbsp;kbit/s payload, 32&nbsp;kHz sampling rate\nSee also\n* Comparison of VoIP software\n* List of SIP software\n*List of free and open-source software packages\n* Opportunistic encryption\nReferences"
