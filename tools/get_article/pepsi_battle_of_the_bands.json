Maheen Sabeeh of The News said, \"Whether the show manages to accomplish its mission statement to the letter remains to be seen but, having spoken to almost all major players in the production, it can be said with certainty that it has just the right motivation behind it and that matters more than we care to admit.\" The Nation wrote, \"With such an eclectic mix of sounds and energies, right from the get go - we are rooted to our televisions, waiting with bated breath till the second episode of the inevitably and justifiably iconic, biggest music battle in the country; Pepsi Battle of the Bands.\" Vafa Batool of Pakistan Today wrote \"The first episode showed how the judges focused on grossly distinct aspects of the performances. Fawad Khan preferred to acknowledge the raw live energy on stage while Meesha Shafi's focus remained largely on vocal quality. Farooq Ahmed offered technical help to the bands as a well-nuanced musician who was more concerned about improving the sounds further.\" Dawn wrote \"Looks like we're in for a great show\"\nHowever, the second season has been criticized by some as well. Pakistani music, fashion critic and Season 1 judge Fifi Haroon on her Twitter called it \"bland, listless\". Speaking to Gulf News journalist Usman Ghafoor, Pakistani culture critic Nadeem Farooq Paracha said, \"Pepsi is 10 years too late. When the last season went on air, the reality was quite different; we still had underground and mainstream music happening at the time. From mid-2000s on, the bands started to whittle away for all sorts of reasons — political, social, and security. Besides, today, we are talking about a different generation — not even the millennials but generation Z, the kids who were born in early 2000s or late 1990s. The dynamics of understanding and listening to music have changed all around the world. No one listens to albums or CDs now; they listen to singles and stream videos. BOTB, in my opinion, has failed to capture the imagination of this new generation.\"\nSome critics even compared the show with Coke Studio though the comparison has been rejected by those involved with the show. Pakistani actor Shaan Shahid criticized the format of the show and said on his Facebook that Pepsi should stick to critic as Coke Studio owns the music scene. His comments received a lot of criticism.\nThe decision to not include some bands in the top eight particularly the band Khamaaj was criticized.\nSeason 3\nSeason 3 started in 2018 and Xarb and Bayaan fought for the title with the latter going to clinch the title.\nSeason 4\nSeason 4 started in 2019 and Aarish and  Auj fought for the title with the latter going to clinch the title.\nSee also\n*Coke Studio\n*Nescafé Basement\n*Uth Records\n*Pakistan Idol\n*Pakistan Sangeet Icon\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
