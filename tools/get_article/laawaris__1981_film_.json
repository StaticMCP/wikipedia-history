The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Zeenat Aman, and Amjad Khan in lead roles. It follows the story of an orphan who embarks on a journey to uncover the truth about his parents.\nThe film gained notable recognition for its song \"Mere Angene Mein Tumhara Kya Kaam Hai\" (roughly translated as: \"In my courtyard, what is your purpose?\"). The song was rendered twice: first by a young Alka Yagnik, earning her a Filmfare nomination for Best Female Playback Singer, and later by Amitabh Bachchan.

It ranked as the fourth-highest-grossing Hindi film of 1981.
