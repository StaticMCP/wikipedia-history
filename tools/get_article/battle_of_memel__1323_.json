They also set fire to three neighboring castles, probably Žardė (now the southern outskirts of Klaipėda), Poyso (on the left bank of the upstream Dangė River, east of Klaipėda), and Eketė (at the confluence of the Dangė and Eketė Rivers).\nAfter the battle, in 1328, the Livonian Order transferred the city and the surrounding area to the Prussian branch of the Teutonic Knights. In 1392, the Bishop of Courland also transferred his holding in Memel to the Teutonic Knights.\nReferences"
