It was chartered in 1869 to build a new train line across Delaware but used in 1878 as a way to organize a successor to the Maryland and Delaware Rail Road Company (M&D) which had been foreclosed on late 1877.\nThe line it operated, sometimes called the Oxford Brach continued to operate, at least in part, under an assortment of owners and operators until 1996 when the last train ran. The state of Maryland, which purchased it in 1977, abandoned it in 2006 and railbanked it. Since then, localities have built several small trails on it and more have been proposed.\nHistory\nThe D&CR was chartered by the state of Delaware in 1869 to build a railroad from Port Penn, Delaware on the Delaware River to  the Maryland state line near Warwick, Maryland, passing through Odessa and Middletown and crossing the Delaware Railroad (DRC) where necessary, but the bondholders never built any rail along that route. Instead the charter and name were used to reorganize the M&D railroad in 1878.\nBetween 1854 and 1871, the M&D built a line from Clayton, where it connected to the Delaware Railroad (DRC), to Oxford, Maryland. The Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&B) operated the line. The M&D struggled to pay its debts and. in 1877, bondholders foreclosed on the M&D. It was sold in two lots on December 20 of that year and reorganized as the D&CR on July 31, 1878.\nIn 1881, the PW&B was purchased by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), which was at the time the nation's largest railroad, and in 1882 the PW&B purchased the DCR.\nIn 1890, the Baltimore & Eastern Shore Railroad built a line that crossed and connected with the D&CR at Easton, MD.\nOn January 23, 1899, D&CR was one of several Eastern Shore railroads that were merged into the DRC under agreement of December 31, 1898. It remained a separate entity with its own office in Easton, MD.\nIn 1902, the PW&B merged with the Baltimore and Potomac to form the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad (PB&W) of which the DRC became the PB&W's Delaware Division. At the same time the D&CR was transferred to the DRC and became that line's Oxford Branch. At that time it ceased to exist as a separate entity.\nRemnants\nThe Ridgeley, MD train station, which was built in 1892, was preserved in 2013 and now serves as a museum. It closed to passenger service in 1949 but continued to be used for freight until 1976. It was then used by several businesses, and even served as town hall in the 1990s.\nAll of the other remnants of the line were built prior to, or after, the D&CR was the owner.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.facebook.com/BaltimoreNRHS/photos/pcb.1755316011157866/1755308781158589/?type=3 NRHS Baltimore Chapter (Facebook Page)]\n*[http://www.railsandtrails.com/TC/PRR/Chesapeake/PRR_TC%20Chesapeake%20Reg%20Delmarva%20District%20ML%20&%20Branches%2019XX%20part07%2009-10%20DE-MD%20BA-Wi150c.jpg Oxford and Smyrna Branches; Pennsylvania Railroad Chesapeake Region (Rails and Trails)]"
