Cannon Valley State School was at 1-11 Abell Road (north-east corner of Shute Harbour, ). Although the school's original location was outside of Cannonvale in 1969, that location is now within the present-day boundary of Cannonvale due to the growth of Cannonvale.\nWindermere State School opened on 21 March 1922.
