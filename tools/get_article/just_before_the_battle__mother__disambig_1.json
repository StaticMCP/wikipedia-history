      "text": "# Just Before the Battle, Mother__disambig_1\n\nCover of the 1864 sheet music for \"Just Before the Battle, Mother\"\n\"Just before the Battle, Mother\" was a popular song during the American Civil War, particularly among troops in the Union Army. It was written and published by Chicago-based George F. Root. It was also a popular song with adherents of the Primrose League in England, and was a central part of Victoria Day celebrations in Canada during the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries.\nLyrics\nJust before the battle, mother,\nI am thinking most of you,\nWhile upon the field we're watching\nWith the enemy in view.\nComrades brave are 'round me lying,\nFilled with thoughts of home and God\nFor well they know that on the morrow,\nSome will sleep beneath the sod.\nCHORUS:\nFarewell, mother, you may never\nPress me to your heart again,\nBut, oh, you'll not forget me, mother,\nIf I'm numbered with the slain.\nOh, I long to see you, mother,\nAnd the loving ones at home,\nBut I'll never leave our banner,\nTill in honor I can come.\nTell the traitors all around you\nThat their cruel words we know,\nIn every battle kill our soldiers\nBy the help they give the foe.\nCHORUS:\nFarewell, mother, you may never\nPress me to your heart again,\nBut, oh, you'll not forget me, mother,\nIf I'm numbered with the slain.\nHark! I hear the bugles sounding,\n'Tis the signal for the fight,\nNow, may God protect us, mother,\nAs He ever does the right.\nHear the \"Battle-Cry of Freedom,\"\nHow it swells upon the air,\nOh, yes, we'll rally 'round the standard,\nOr we'll perish nobly there.\nCHORUS:\nFarewell, mother, you may never\nPress me to your heart again,\nBut, oh, you'll not forget me, mother,\nIf I'm numbered with the slain.\nLyrics are in the public domain.\nAlternative versions\nDuring the American Civil War, Union troops parodied the song due to its unrealistic depiction of the horrors of war. The first verse of the Song of the Coward, as it was known, can be dated to 1864 after several calamitous defeats at the hands of the Confederate army. Years after the Civil War, other verses were added by historical re-enactors.\nJust before the battle mother\nI was drinking mountain dew\nWhen I heard the sound of gunfire\nTo the rear I quickly flew\nWhere the stragglers were all gathered\nThinking of their home and wives\nTwas not the Rebs we feared dear mother\nBut our own dear precious lives\nCHORUS:\nFarewell, mother, you may never\nCount my name among the slain\nFor if I only could skedaddle\nDear mother I'll come home again\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.library.ucsb.edu/OBJID/Cylinder4069 \"Just Before the Battle, Mother\"], Stanley & Burr (Indestructible Record 1460, 1911).&mdash;[http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/index.php Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project].\n*[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21566/21566-h/21566-h.htm#JUST_BEFORE_THE_BATTLE_MOTHER Lyrics and midi] from Project Gutenberg\n*[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21566/21566-h/images/just.pdf Sheet music] from Project Gutenberg\n*[https://archive.today/20121212221652/http://dc.lib.unc.edu/u?/sheetmusic,23145 Sheet Music] from the library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"
