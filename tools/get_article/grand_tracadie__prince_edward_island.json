It was incorporated in 1984. The village itself was located in the central portion of Prince Edward Island. On September 28, 2018, it was merged with the municipality of North Shore.  Grand Tracadie finds itself partly in a National Park of Canada.  It is close to Charlottetown, the cultural hub of P.E.I.\nHotel Acadia and Acadia Spring\nThe Hotel Acadia was a popular beach and wellness resort that operated for 12 seasons. The hotel opened its doors in the spring of 1894.  This establishment gave Tracadie Beach the enviable reputation of being a health resort for those \"run down\" by overwork and nervous strain, and has undoubtedly resorted to robust health and renewed mental vigor many whose physical and mental depression was a great anxiety to their friends.\nThe hotel burned down on August 6, 1906.\nThe Hotel was acknowledged for its excellent Acadian cuisine.  This popular cuisine consisted of many fresh fish including: mackerel, codfish, haddock, lobster, clams, salmon, trout and other sea and harbour fish. The use of local meats, fruits and vegetables helped drive the admiration for this excellent cuisine. This food laid the ground work for what was to become known as folk food.\nSee also\n*List of communities in Prince Edward Island\nReferences"
