The topic has picked up interest as an internet meme, even as claimants have stated that they do not seriously believe it. In a February 2016 survey of Florida voters done by Public Policy Polling, 10% of respondents stated that they believed Cruz was the killer, while 28% felt that the possibility could not be ruled out. Cruz was born in 1970, the year after the last confirmed Zodiac-related murder was committed. One columnist observed that the rumor campaign's persistence, despite its complete implausibility, is \"a matter of style over substance\".  Several people involved with the meme acknowledged to National Public Radio that they were well aware that Cruz could not possibly be the killer, and added, \"... it's all about a feeling they have about Cruz: they think he's creepy.\"  Cruz himself has acknowledged the meme, tweeting a photo of one of the killer's coded messages in October 2017. In 2020, following the decryption of a previously undecipherable letter from the Zodiac Killer, Cruz once again acknowledged the meme.\nReferences"
