It is located in the Khuzdar District of Balochistan, Pakistan, approximately  northwest of Karachi. The site lies on the right bank of the Kud River, a tributary of the Porali River. Excavations at Nindowari indicate that the area was initially inhabited by the Harappans, with subsequent occupation by the Kulli civilisation. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Kulli culture may have developed as a regional variant or offshoot of the Harappan civilisation, reflecting cultural continuity and interaction between these prehistoric societies.\nHistory\nand terracotta figurines with drawings of bulls (similar to the seals above) showed that  Nindowari was once occupied by the Harappans]]\nNindowari is a site of the prehistoric Kulli culture of Balochistan with links to the Harappan Civilization.\nThe site, spread over an area of 124 acres and  high, is the largest Kulli complex site discovered so far. The settlement was built on a flat schist bed with a central quadrangular platform which was surrounded by buildings on one side. Mounds of various heights were located in the area. The central mound near the platform rose to a height of  and consisted of large stones and boulders. The summit of the mound was accessed via a staircase from the platform showing this mound was considered a monument. Another mound, called Kulliki-an Damb (Mound of Potteries), was located  south of the main mound. The site offers evidence that Kulli culture might be strongly associated with the Harappan Civilization if not directly derived from it. Artifacts excavated from the site show that the two cultures had close interaction.\nThe site was probably abandoned due to a major uplift which resulted in cutting off of the water source from the Kud River.\nExcavations\nThe site was discovered by Beatrice De Cardi in 1957. French Archaeological Mission, led by Jean-Marie Casal, and Department of Archaeology, Pakistan later carried out the Nindowari excavations from 1962 till 1965, uncovering traces of a Kulli settlement dating back to the third millennium BC. These excavations unearthed Kulli-Harappan pottery and vases with animal figures, mostly bulls and birds. Terracotta figurines of women adorned with jewelry with elaborate details were also discovered. Nal ware (old pottery from Indus Civilization) excavated from the site suggested a pre-Kulli occupation and that the Harrapans were settled in the area in early periods (3200 - 2500 BC).\nStatus\nNindowari is one of the 27 notified Archaeological Sites and Monuments in Balochistan and protected by the Federal Government under the Federal Antiquities Act.\nReferences"
