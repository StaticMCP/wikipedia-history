In addition to predicate adjectives and predicate nouns, English allows for predicate prepositional phrases as well: John is behind the cocktail cabinet.\nThe following sentences include linking verbs.\n*Roses are red.\n*The detective felt sick.\n*The soup tasted weird.\n*Frankenstein's monster resembles a zombie.\n*He quickly grew tired.\n*You are becoming a nuisance.\nSee also\n* List of English copulae\nReferences"
