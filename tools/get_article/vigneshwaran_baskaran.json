Throughout his youth, while he displayed natural athletic abilities across various sports at district level, his specific passion for football emerged during his tenth standard of schooling.\nHis first significant achievement came when he led his team to victory in the Inter-district Championship at Avadi—a historic win that marked the district's first triumph in the competition in 50 years. This foundational period of his career was significantly influenced by his mentor, the late Coach Kanagaraj, who introduced him to the fundamentals of goalkeeping through both technical training and stories of legendary goalkeepers. This early guidance proved instrumental in shaping Vigneshwaran's career trajectory.\nDuring his college years, this initial success catalyzed a series of achievements at both district and state levels, establishing him as a promising talent in Tamil Nadu's football circuit.

His ability to blend technical expertise with a science-driven approach has made him a fan favorite.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Club\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=3|League\n!colspan=2|Cup\n!colspan=2|Continental\n!colspan=2|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=1|Chennai City\n|2017–18\n|I-League||1||0||—||—||—||—||1||0\n|-\n|rowspan=1|Churchill Brothers\n|2018–19\n|I-League||6||0||—||—||—||—||6||0\n|-\n|rowspan=4|Gokulam Kerala\n|2019–20\n|rowspan=3|I-League||2||0||—||—||—||—||2||0\n|-\n|2020–21\n||1||0||—||—||—||—||1||0\n|-\n|2021–22\n||0||0||—||—||—||—||0||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!3||0||0||0||0||0||3||0\n|-\n|rowspan=1|Delhi FC\n|2022–23\n|I-League 2||1||0||—||—||—||—||1||0\n|-\n!colspan=3|Career total\n!11||0||0||0||0||0||11||\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.the-aiff.com/players/profile/62704?type=club Profile] at the All India Football Federation"
