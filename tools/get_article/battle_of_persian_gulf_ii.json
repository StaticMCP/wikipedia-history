The content of the animation is focused on a visionary prospective war between U.S. Navy and Iranian Revolutionary Guard in Persian Gulf.\nThe lead of the film, Commander Qasem, is a reference to Qasem Soleimani, according to Farhad Azima. Farhad Azima has declared in an interview that the animation can be a response to the recent elected president of United States, Donald Trump: \"I hope that the film shows Trump how American soldiers will face a humiliating defeat if they attack Iran,\" Azima said. \"They all sink and the film ends as the American ships have turned into an aquarium for fishes at the bottom of the sea.\" This animation is released shortly after Trump put Iran \"on notice\".\nAccording to the director Azima, it took more than four years to make the animation and the total production cost was 10 billion rials ($308,000).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
