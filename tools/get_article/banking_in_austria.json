The Austrian banking system is characterized by a three-tier structure, consisting of joint-stock banks, savings banks (Sparkassen), and cooperative banks (Raiffeisenbanken and Volksbanken).\nThe central bank, Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB), is responsible for the country's monetary policy and the supervision of the banking sector. The Financial Market Authority (FMA) is the primary regulatory body for the Austrian financial market, including banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.\nBanking system\nRegulations\nSince the introduction of the Kreditwesensgesetz (KWG) in 1979, the boundaries between the various types of credit institutions have gradually become blurred. Many banks have developed into universal banks offering a comprehensive range of banking services. Prior to the 1979 KWG, the Austrian banking system was still governed by the Kreditwesengesetz, which had been in force since October 1, 1938 in Nazi Germany and the associated Austria. The 1979 KWG was created as a result of the increasing liberalization of the banking system and the general trend towards universal banks. The rapid growth and increased activity of Austrian banks abroad made it necessary to adapt to international standards, which was regulated in the 1986 amendment to the law. On January 1, 1994, the KWG was replaced by the new Banking Act (Bankwesensgesetz- BWG), which was drafted in view of EU conformity and also contains improved provisions for creditor and consumer protection. In 2002, the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) was founded, which supervises the Austrian banking sector. Due to the economic interest in a stable financial sector, financial market participants, the financial market infrastructure (stock exchange, securities depository) and securities trading are subject to state supervision.\nOesterreichische Nationalbank and Oesterreichische Kontrollbank\nThe central bank of Austria, Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB), is responsible for the country's monetary policy, the issuance of banknotes, and the supervision of the banking sector. Established in 1816, the OeNB operates as an independent institution within the framework of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the Eurosystem, both of which were established in 1998.\nThe OeNB's primary objective is to maintain price stability and contribute to the stability of the Austrian financial system. In addition to its monetary policy function, the OeNB is also responsible for ensuring the smooth functioning of payment systems, managing foreign exchange reserves, and compiling financial statistics.\nGreat importance is attached in Austria to the Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OeKB). It is Austria's central financial and information service provider for the export industry and the capital market. Its services are available to companies and financial institutions as well as institutions of the Republic of Austria. The services of OeKB include Export Services, Capital Market Services for stock exchanges, issuers, financial service providers and investors as well as Energy Market Services for the electricity and gas market. Furthermore, OeKB is a sought-after issuer on the international bond market.\nFinancial Market Authority\nThe Financial Market Authority (FMA) is the primary regulatory body for the Austrian financial market, responsible for supervising banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and other financial institutions. Established in 2002, the FMA aims to ensure the stability, transparency, and integrity of the Austrian financial market. The FMA operates as an independent, integrated authority, working closely with the OeNB to maintain a stable and reliable financial system.\nLargest banks in Austria\nThe largest Austrian credit institutions by balance sheet total in [https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/288090/umfrage/banken-in-oesterreich-nach-ihrer-bilanzsumme/ 2018]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

From the mid-19th century to the beginning of World War I, it was the main capital market of middle and eastern Europe, and from 1918 to 1938, it had continuous international importance as an equity market for the newly founded nations originating from the former monarchy. The exchange also deals in five Austrian and seven foreign investment certificates.
