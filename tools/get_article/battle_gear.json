      "text": "# Battle Gear\n\n, previously known as , is a series of racing video games developed and published by Taito, first released in arcades with Side by Side in 1996. The series was later released for various home consoles, such as the PlayStation and PlayStation 2.\nHistory\nThe Side by Side games allows the player to select import sports cars from major Japanese automakers, namely Toyota, Nissan, Honda, and Mazda, with Mitsubishi and Subaru added in Side by Side 2. Tracks generally resemble Japanese mountain passes, known as touge. The first Side by Side (1996) proved to be a hit in Japan.\nWhile the first two Battle Gear games retain the same gameplay as Side by Side games, starting from Battle Gear 3, online features such as online leaderboards (previously present in the Japanese PlayStation 2 version of  Battle Gear 2) and vehicle customization are included through the NESYS network in both arcade and home versions; in the arcade versions, devices resembling an actual car key is used instead of save cards used by competitor titles such as Initial D Arcade Stage and Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune, in which the player turns the ignition key after inserting a coin to play with their saved data. Battle Gear 4 saw the inclusion of European and American makers for the first and only time, namely Renault, Peugeot, Citroën, Mini, Volkswagen and Ford, with additional Japanese manufacturer Suzuki also included in Battle Gear 4 Tuned. All NESYS servers for the games have since been shut down, the latest being that of Battle Gear 4 Tuned on March 31, 2019.\nThe PlayStation 2 version of Battle Gear 2 was licensed by Midas Interactive and released as a budget game named Tokyo Road Race by various distributors in PAL territories. Online leaderboards, accessed using a dial-up modem in the Japanese release, were removed in the Tokyo Road Race version. North American arcade versions of Side by Side 2 and the first Battle Gear also had Honda cars removed due to licensing issues with American Honda Motor Company, but they are featured in the North American version of Battle Gear 3.\nBetween Side by Side 2 to Battle Gear 3, the series features cars resembling those used by Initial D characters, usually as secret cars. In Battle Gear 4 Tuned, these (previously removed in the original Battle Gear 4) were replaced by a pair of real-life D1 Grand Prix cars. Certain Battle Gear 4 Tuned cabinets, branded with Professional suffix, feature a six-speed gear shifter and a clutch pedal for immersive simulation-style gameplay, similar to those present in F355 Challenge.\nSeries timeline\n*Side by Side (Taito JC System Type-C)\n:Released in August 1996 in Japan.\n*Side by Side 2 Evoluzione (Taito JC System Type-C)\n:Released in June 1997 in Japan.
