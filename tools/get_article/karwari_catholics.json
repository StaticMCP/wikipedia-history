Colloquially called \"Karwar district\", this area falls under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Karwar. At the turn of the new century, the diocese had about 50,000 Catholics, comprising 3% of the total population of the district. They are Konkani people and speak the Karwari dialect of the Konkani language. Karwari Catholics share ancestry with Goan Christians and other Christians of the Konkan region and the Konknni language.\nCitations\nExternal links\n* UCAN"
