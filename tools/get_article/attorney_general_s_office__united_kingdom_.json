It supports the Attorney General and their deputy, the Solicitor General (together, the Law officers of the Crown in England and Wales). It is sometimes referred to as the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers'''.\nThe administration and expenditure of the Attorney General's Office are scrutinised by the Justice Select Committee.\nOrganisation\nThe AGO is one of the smallest UK government departments, with around 60 staff. It is one of \"the Law Officers’ Departments\" along with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI), the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the Government Legal Department.
