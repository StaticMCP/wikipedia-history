The 640-page book seeks to provide new insights into the spread and decline of large languages, especially exploring certain lingua francas around the world.\nContents\nThe book charts the history of spoken language, in its myriad forms, across the world.\nThe book also explores the various lingua francas that have since seen decline.\nReception\nPublishers Weekly called it \"ambitious and accessible\", and \"stimulating\".\nThe Independent noted that the book's \"chief pleasure [...] lies in its detail, and in its hieroglyphs, ideograms and scripts plus translations.\"\nKirkus Reviews found it to be \"dense but enlightening\" and \"always challenging, always instructive—at times, even startling or revolutionary\", but expressed concern that its \"sometimes turgid text\" and sheer scope could \"overwhelm general readers\", and thereby prevent it from receiving the attention it deserves.\nReferences"
