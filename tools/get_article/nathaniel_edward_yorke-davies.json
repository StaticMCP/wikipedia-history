His most famous patient was US President William Howard Taft.\nEarly life and education\nYorke-Davies, whose father was headmaster at Llanrwst Grammar School, was educated at Cheltenham College and other schools before entering St Bartholomew's Hospital. He qualified L.S.A. in 1865, L.M. Dub. in 1865, M.R.C.S. Eng. in 1866, and L.R.C.P Lond. in 1871.\nCareer\nAfter a brief period of service in the Egyptian navy, he became a specialist in dietetics; he gained an international reputation in that speciality as an author of several books and numerous articles in medical and popular journals.\nHis 1889 book Foods for the Fat: A Treatise on Corpulency urged overweight people to a consult a physician, who would provide psychological support and an individualised plan for diet and exercise. His book criticised Banting's dietary plan for its extreme severity and Ebstein's dietary plan for recommending too much fat.
