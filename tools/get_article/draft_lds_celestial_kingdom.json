It is believed to be the dwelling place of God the Father and Jesus Christ, and is the goal for all who seek exaltation and eternal life.\nDoctrinal overview\nThe concept of the Celestial Kingdom originates in a vision recorded by Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon in Doctrine and Covenants Section 76. According to this revelation, there are three heavenly kingdoms: the Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial—with the Celestial being the highest and most glorious.\nLatter-day Saints believe that only those who accept the gospel of Jesus Christ, receive the necessary ordinances, and live faithfully will inherit the Celestial Kingdom.\nRequirements for entry\nAccording to LDS doctrine, to inherit the Celestial Kingdom, individuals must:\n* Accept and follow Jesus Christ\n* Receive the essential ordinances (such as baptism, confirmation, endowment, and celestial marriage)\n* Live a faithful and righteous life\n* Repent of sins and endure to the end\nAdditionally, those who die without a knowledge of the gospel but would have accepted it may also be heirs of this kingdom through proxy ordinances performed in LDS temples.\nStructure within the kingdom\nLDS teachings suggest that there are multiple levels or degrees within the Celestial Kingdom. Those who attain the **highest degree** are those who have entered into the **new and everlasting covenant of marriage** (celestial marriage) and are thus eligible for **exaltation**—becoming like God and living eternally in families.\nDescription\nThe Celestial Kingdom is described as having glory comparable to that of the sun. It is the realm where God the Father dwells, and where those who inherit it will live in His presence forever. These individuals will receive “all that the Father hath,” including eternal increase and divine inheritance.\nRelation to other kingdoms\n* The Terrestrial Kingdom is for honorable people who rejected the fullness of the gospel in mortality but accepted it in the spirit world.\n* The Telestial Kingdom is for the wicked who did not repent, but who will eventually be redeemed after suffering for their sins.\n* Only those in the Celestial Kingdom dwell in the presence of God the Father; others receive the presence of the Son or the Holy Spirit but not the Father.\nSee also\n* Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)\n* Degrees of glory\n* Exaltation (Mormonism)\n* Heaven in Christianity\n* Afterlife (Latter Day Saints)\nReferences"
