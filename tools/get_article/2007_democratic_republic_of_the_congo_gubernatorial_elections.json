      "text": "# 2007 Democratic Republic of the Congo gubernatorial elections\n\nGubernatorial elections were held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 27 January 2007 (with 30 January planned as a possible date for a second round, if necessary), though they were originally scheduled for 16 January and 19 January. The governors and vice-governors were chosen through indirect election by the members of the provincial assemblies; the delay was a result of the difficulties in choosing traditional chiefs to fill the places reserved for them in the provincial assemblies. The second round of voting would only have been necessary in those cases where no candidate had received an absolute majority in the first round, which was not the case anywhere. However, voting was rescheduled in Kasai-Occidental and Kasai-Oriental on 10 February to 15 February, because the Union of the Nation candidates were disqualified because they held dual citizenship.\nGovernors elected\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Alliance\n!Party\n!Seats\n!Provinces\n|-\n|align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| Alliance of the Presidential Majority (AMP)\n|align=\"left\"| People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD)\n|align=\"right\"| 7\n|align=\"left\"| Bandundu, Kasai-Occidental, Katanga, Kinshasa, Maniema, Orientale, Sud-Kivu\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| Independents\n|align=\"right\"| 2\n|align=\"left\"| Bas-Congo, Nord-Kivu\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| Forces for Renewal (FR)\n|align=\"right\"| 1\n|align=\"left\"| Kasai-Oriental\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| Union for the Nation (UN)\n|align=\"left\"| Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC)\n|align=\"right\"| 1\n|align=\"left\"| Équateur\n|-\n|align=\"left\" colspan=\"2\"| Total\n|align=\"right\"|11\n|align=\"right\"|[http://allafrica.com/stories/200701300327.html (source1)], [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200702190123.html (source2)]\n|}\nBoth of the independents and the RCD governor are allied with Kabila, which means that the opposition managed to attain the post of governor in only one province.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!Province !!Governor !!Vice-Governor !!Party !!List of governors\n|-\n| Bandundu || Richard Ndambu Wolang || Vicky Mboso Muteba-Dialunda || PPRD (AMP) || List\n|-\n| Bas-Congo || Simon Mbaki Batshia || Deo Gratias Nkusu Kunzi-Bikawa || Independent (AMP) || List\n|-\n| Équateur || José Makila Sumanda || Ronsard Baende Iyetsi || MLC (UN) || List\n|-\n| Kasai-Occidental || Trésor Kapuku Ngoy || Hubert Mbingo N'Vula || PPRD (AMP) || List\n|-\n| Kasai-Oriental || Alphonse Ngoyi Kasanji || Bruno Kazadi Bukasa || Independent (AMP) || List\n|-\n| Katanga || Moïse Katumbi Chapwe || Guilbert-Paul Yav Tshibal || PPRD (AMP) || List\n|-\n| Kinshasa || André Kimbuta Yango || Clément Bafiba Zomba || PPRD (AMP) || List\n|-\n| Maniema || Didier Manara Linga || Mendes Pierre Masudi || PPRD (AMP) || List\n|-\n| North Kivu || Julien Paluku Kahongya || Feller Lutaichirwa Mulwahale || RCD-K-ML (AMP) || List\n|-\n| Orientale || Médard Autsai Asenga || Joseph Bangakya Angaze || PPRD (AMP) || List\n|-\n| South Kivu || Célestin Cibalonza Byaterana || Léon Mumate Nyamatomwa || PPRD (AMP) || List\n|-\n| Ituri Interim Administration || Emmanuel Leku Apuobo{Administrator) || Petronille Vaweka(Chair of the Ituri Interim Assembly) ||  ||\n|-\n| || || [http://www.congovision.com/nouvelles/gouverneurs1.html (source)]\n|}\nProtests in Bas-Congo\nIn the province of Bas-Congo, the pro-government independent candidate, Simon Mbatshi, won 15 votes against the opposition MLC candidate, Fuka Unzola, who obtained 14 votes. Opposition activists held protests alleging vote-buying and chanting \"''Congo can't be rebuilt on corruption''\". Clashes between the police and Bundu dia Kongo, an opposition secessionist religious group, lead to 134 deaths. The results were annulled on 8 February by an appeals court, but its findings were then overturned by the Constitutional Court of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 17 February 2007.\nSee also\n*List of Provincial Governors of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nReferences"
