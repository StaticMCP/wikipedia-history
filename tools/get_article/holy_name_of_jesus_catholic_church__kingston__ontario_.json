During the winter period, residents would walk across the Rideau Canal from the Aragon Road to help in the celebration of the holy mass. On June 26, 1886, Edward and Jane Braden donated a land for the construction of the church building and rectory.\nDesigned by architect Joseph Connolly, the foundation stone of the building was laid by Bishop J.V. Cleary in June 1887 as well as blessed a donated bell on August 15, 1892. It became a parish in 1896 with the appointment of Reverend J.P Kehoe as the first pastor. Reverend W.T. Kingsley, who succeeded him in 1907, was transferred in 1924, and D.A Casey became the pastor. Casey retired in 1953 due to health ailments, hence Reverend T.J Raby became the pastor in September 1953.\nFather Raby brought the Sisters of Saint Martha to teach at Holy Name School in 1957, and built a convent for them between the church and the school building.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*  | access-date=September 21, 2024}}"
