They are found on most main streets and most churches in Scotland. Many commemorate the sacrifice of the First World War but there are many others to wars before and since 1914–1918.\nHistory of Scottish war memorials\nThe history of Scotland has often been bloody and there is a martial tradition which is strong in Scotland. Scots have fought in many battles and served in armed forces in many parts of the world. This service has been part of Scots armies; as mercenaries, and in the British Armed Forces. The service of the martial Scots are commemorated with war memorials across Scotland and around the world.\nScottish war memorials commemorate the sacrifices made as early as 1263 up to the recent war in Iraq and the conflict in Afghanistan\nThe earliest memorials record the battles fought against Viking and English invaders. Later ones recall Scottish civil wars. Sometimes these civil wars are related to religious intolerance, sometimes over the succession of royalty.\nMost of these early memorials have the same thing in common. They were not erected until the 19th century, sometimes hundreds of years after the actual battle had taken place. Another thing they have in common is that they do not list individual names.\nBy the late 19th century after several small Colonial wars the infantry and cavalry regiments of Scotland had started to erect memorials in churches and garrison towns in Scotland. These memorials would now include lists of names. Sometimes just Officers, but sometimes non-commissioned officers and enlisted men\nThe first recorded civic war memorial in Scotland where local men who died overseas in war and were named on a stone is in the local churchyard at Balmaclellan, Dumfries and Galloway and was erected after the Crimean War. It was not until fifty years later after the Second Boer War that other civic war memorials were erected in Scotland.\nBy 1914 a precedent had been set for local communities for erecting war memorials when they had lost their sons in war time. By the time the First World War had finished in 1918 nearly every community in Scotland decided to erect a memorial to their own war dead.\nAt the same time a proposal for a national war memorial led to the creation of the magnificent shrine at Edinburgh Castle. The Scottish National War Memorial. This memorial continues to commemorate Scots who have died in wars since 1914 and currently commemorates 206,779 men and women who have died serving in UK and Commonwealth Forces.\nAt the same time as the civic and national memorials were being erected factories, banks, golf clubs, boys' clubs, schools, universities churches, railways, police, post offices and even a prison erected war memorials to those men and women who had gone to war.\nBecause of the size of military formations during the First World War there were not only regimental memorials erected but Scottish Brigade and Scottish Divisional memorials too.\nin the Scottish Highlands was unveiled in 1952, dedicated to the World War II British Commandos that trained at Achnacarry Castle.]]\nAfter the Second World War many communities had the sad task of adding names to their existing war memorial. Aberlady, East Lothian used the same memorial they had erected for the Boer War and used again for the First World War to list their Second World War Dead. Other communities chose to erect new memorials for the Second World War Dead rather than change the First World War Memorial.\nEven today communities are still erecting war memorials to men and women who died in the First and Second World Wars.\nRecent unveilings of Scottish war memorials include.\n* The civic war memorials at Waterloo, Lanarkshire and Cowie, Stirling.\n* The Air Forces Memorial at Grangemouth\n* The Black Watch memorial at Balhousie Castle, Perth\n* \"Buckhaven’s Secret\", Fife\n* 'Bamse' Memorial to the Norwegian Navy dog at Montrose\n* WW1 Nurses' Memorial at Central Library, Edinburgh, unveiled on 11 November 2015\n* French merchant ship SS Longwy crew memorial in Doune Cemetery, Girvan, commemorating crew lost in 1917 torpedoing, unveiled on 12 October 2024.\nTypes of Scottish war memorials\nThere is no typical Scottish war memorial. Five of the most common types are\nCeltic cross, obelisk, cairn, mercat cross, and statue but they can also take the form of plaques or tablets of bronze, brass, marble, granite or wood; memorial gardens; fountains; rolls of honour; Crosses of Sacrifice;clock towers; lychgates; parks; halls; hospitals; bandstands; stained glass windows; altars; baptismal fonts; sporting cups and medals.\nScottish artists and architects including Sir Robert Lorimer, Alexander Carrick, Charles Pilkington Jackson, Thomas John Clapperton and William Birnie Rhind and others created some memorable monuments across the county.\nAfter the First World War there was a difference of opinion in some communities as to whether a memorial to a community's sacrifice should be a practical memorial which would benefit the living or a stone memorial to the dead. This led to some memorials being District Nurses, hospital beds, holiday cottages for war widows and orphans. Reorganisations of health care since the formation of the National Health Service has meant that the care of these memorials was taken out of local control and many of these memorials no longer exist. With the disappearance of the memorial the sacrifice is forgotten.\nCare of memorials\n, North Ayrshire]]\nOnce the memorials were erected and unveiled the committee who raised them then passed them into the care of another organisation. In the case of the civic memorials they were passed on to the local Municipal Corporation or County Council who still maintain them to this day (as Unitary Authorities) through the local community council. Often the local branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland or other local volunteers help with the maintenance and upkeep of the civic memorials. The Royal British Legion Scotland also run an annual campaign called the \"Best Kept War Memorial\".\nNon-civic memorials are often in the care of churches, or clubs or private companies. When these organisations leave a building, refurbish it or close then the future of the war memorials in their care is not always assured.\nSince the 1960s church mergers and closures have sometimes meant that memorials integral to the buildings have been lost when the building has been demolished. Sometimes a new memorial is created to replace the old one such as at St George's Church in Edinburgh. Sometimes photographs of the memorials are all that is left. Greenside Church in Edinburgh have photographs of the memorial windows of St James's which were demolished along with the building in 1975.\nThe roll of honour from St Mungo's Church is in private hands after it was left for salvage when the Lockhart Memorial Church in Edinburgh dissolved in 1984.\nOther private memorials are at risk too. A roll of honour in Livingston was recovered from a rubbish skip after the Social Club it was in was refurbished in 2008 and the memorial was thrown away.\nInterest in Scottish war memorials\nThere are three organisations with a national interest in Scottish war memorials.\n*UK National Inventory of War Memorials is based in the Imperial War Museum in London and is recording basic information of all the UK's war memorials. Also known as the UKNIWM\n*War Memorials Trust has been set up to help local organisations with information on maintenance, conservation, listing and cleaning of war memorials. In Scotland it works with Historic Scotland in running a small grants scheme for conservation and repair of war memorials including restoring the legibility of inscriptions. (note that routine maintenance is specifically excluded)\n*The Scottish War Memorials Project has been set up to record Scotland's war memorials (see below)\nThe Scottish War Memorials Project\nRunning since December 2006 as a voluntary project to photograph and record all of Scotland's war memorials and make them online for free. The [http://warmemscot.s4.bizhat.com Scottish War Memorials Project]  has over 4,900 war memorials recorded to date including nearly all the c.1,400 civic memorials in the cities, towns and villages across Scotland.\nUsing photograph hosting websites the project is internet forum based. It has no running costs and is entirely voluntary.\nExamples of Scottish war memorials\nBased on the UKNIWM's approximate total of 100,000 war memorials in the whole of the UK then an assumption of a total of Scottish war memorials of up to 10,000 is not an unreasonable estimate. It would be impossible to list them all here so the following lists are based on examples already listed on Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons.\nOban War Memorial\nPre-First World War\n*Battle of Drumclog Memorial\n*Battle of Culloden Memorial\n*Balmaclellan Crimean War Memorial\nFirst World War\nThere are over 1,000 civic war memorials remembering the First World War in Scotland.
