The office consists of several offices and agencies, such as the White House Office (the staff working closest with the president, including West Wing staff), the National Security Council, Homeland Security Council, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, and others.  The Eisenhower Executive Office Building houses most staff.\nThe office is also referred to as a \"permanent government\", since many policy programs, and the people who are charged with implementing them, continue between presidential administrations.\nThe civil servants who work in the Executive Office of the President are regarded as nonpartisan and politically neutral, so they are capable of providing objective and impartial advice.\nWith the increase in technological and global advancement, the size of the White House staff has increased to include an array of policy experts responsible with managing various federal governmental functions and policy areas. As of 2015, it included approximately 1,800 positions, most of which did not require confirmation from the U.S. Senate.\nThe office is overseen by the White House chief of staff. Since January 20, 2025, that position has been held by Susie Wiles, who was appointed by President Donald Trump. She is the first woman to hold the title.\nHistory\nThe Eisenhower Executive Office Building at night\nIn 1937, the Brownlow Committee, which was a presidentially commissioned panel of political science and public administration experts, recommended sweeping changes to the executive branch of the U.S. federal government, including the creation of the Executive Office of the President. Based on these recommendations, President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939 lobbied Congress to approve the Reorganization Act of 1939. The Act led to Reorganization Plan No. 1, which created the office, which reported directly to the president.\nThe office encompassed two subunits at its outset, the White House Office (WHO) and the Bureau of the Budget, the predecessor to today's Office of Management and Budget, which was created in 1921 and originally located in the Treasury Department. It absorbed most of the functions of the National Emergency Council. Initially, the new staff system appeared more ambitious on paper than in practice; the increase in the size of the staff was quite modest at the start. However, it laid the groundwork for the large and organizationally complex White House staff that emerged during the presidencies of Roosevelt's successors.\nRoosevelt's efforts are also notable in contrast to those of his predecessors in office. During the 19th century, presidents had few staff resources. Thomas Jefferson had one messenger and one secretary at his disposal, both of whose salaries were paid by the president personally. It was not until 1857 that Congress appropriated money ($2,500) for the hiring of one clerk.\nBy Ulysses S. Grant's presidency (1869–1877), the staff had grown to three. By 1900, the White House staff included one \"secretary to the president\" (then the title of the president's chief aide), two assistant secretaries, two executive clerks, a stenographer, and seven other office personnel. Under Warren G. Harding, there were thirty-one staff, although most were in clerical positions.\nDuring Herbert Hoover's presidency, two additional secretaries to the president were added by Congress, one of whom Hoover designated as his press secretary. From 1933 to 1939, as he greatly expanded the scope of the federal government's policies and powers in response to the Great Depression, Roosevelt relied on his \"brain trust\" of top advisers, who were often appointed to vacant positions in agencies and departments, from which they drew their salaries since the White House lacked statutory or budgetary authority to create new staff positions.\nAfter World War II, in particular, during the Eisenhower presidency, the staff was expanded and reorganized. Eisenhower, a former U.S. Army general, had been Supreme Allied Commander during the war and reorganized the Executive Office to suit his leadership style.\nAs of 2009, the staff is much bigger. Estimates indicate some 3,000 to 4,000 persons serve in office staff positions with policy-making responsibilities, with a budget of $300 to $400 million (George W. Bush's budget request for Fiscal Year 2005 was for $341 million in support of 1,850 personnel).\nSome observers have noted a problem of control for the president due to the increase in staff and departments, making coordination and cooperation between the various departments of the Executive Office more difficult.\nOrganization\nThe president had the power to reorganize the Executive Office due to the 1949 Reorganization Act which gave the president considerable discretion, until 1983 when it was renewed due to President Reagan's administration allegedly encountering \"disloyalty and obstruction\".\nThe chief of staff is the head of the Executive Office and can therefore ultimately decide what the president needs to deal with personally and what can be dealt with by other staff.\nSenior staff within the Executive Office of the President have the title Assistant to the President, second-level staff have the title Deputy Assistant to the President, and third-level staff have the title Special Assistant to the President.\nThe core White House staff appointments, and most Executive Office officials generally, are not required to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, although there are a handful of exceptions (e.g., the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the United States Trade Representative).\nThe information in the following table is current as of January 20, 2025.

Some of this authority stems from its appropriation powers given by the Constitution, such as the \"power of the purse\", which affects the Office of Management and Budget and the funding of the rest of federal departments and agencies. Congress also has the right to investigate the operation of the Executive Office, normally holding hearings bringing forward individual personnel to testify before a congressional committee.\nThe Executive Office often helps with legislation by filling in specific points understood and written by experts, as Congressional legislation sometimes starts in broad terms.\nBudget history\nThis table specifies the budget of the Executive Office for the years 2008–2017, and the actual outlays for the years 1993–2007.\n{| class=wikitable\n!Year\n!Budget\n|-\n|2017\n|$714 million\n|-\n|2016\n|$692&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2015\n|$676&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2014\n|$624&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2013\n|$650&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2012\n|$640&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2011\n|$708&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2010\n|$772&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2009\n|$728&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2008\n|$682&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2007\n|$2956&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2006\n|$5379&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2005\n|$7686&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2004\n|$3349&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2003\n|$386&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2002\n|$451&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2001\n|$246&nbsp;million\n|-\n|2000\n|$283&nbsp;million\n|-\n|1999\n|$417&nbsp;million\n|-\n|1998\n|$237&nbsp;million\n|-\n|1997\n|$221&nbsp;million\n|-\n|1996\n|$202&nbsp;million\n|-\n|1995\n|$215&nbsp;million\n|-\n|1994\n|$231&nbsp;million\n|-\n|1993\n|$194&nbsp;million\n|}\nSee also\n* Title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations\n* Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations\n* White House Records Office\n* President's Room\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-executive-branch/ Executive Office of the President]\n* [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40856.pdf The Debate Over Selected Presidential Assistants and Advisors: Appointment, Accountability, and Congressional Oversight] Congressional Research Service\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111008182342/http://openregs.com/agencies/view/179/executive_office_of_the_president Proposed and finalized federal regulations from the Executive Office of the President of the United States]\n*\n*"
