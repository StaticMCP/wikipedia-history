He studied at Trinity College School in Port Hope and Trinity University, receiving a LLB in 1896. He was called to the Ontario bar in 1897 and set up practice in Sarnia.\nMarriage/Relocation\nIn 1900, he married Eva Florence Watson. McCarthy moved to Calgary, then part of the Northwest Territories, in 1903. He was admitted to the bar and set up practice in Calgary with William L. Walsh.\nPolitics\nMaitland was elected Calgary's first direct member of the House of Commons of Canada after the redistribution prior to the 1904 federal election gave Calgary its first direct seat. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1908 Canadian federal election.\nMaitland was offered leadership of the provincial Conservative Party prior to the 1909 Alberta general election, but declined the offer of leadership as he would have to resign his federal seat which he won in a controversial election in 1908, and felt the resignation would be seen as an admission of guilt.\nElectoral record\nPost-politics\nAfter leaving politics, he returned to the practice of law. McCarthy was named King's Counsel in 1913 and, in 1914, he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Alberta. In 1926, he retired from the bench due to health problems.\nDeath\nMcCarthy died while on vacation in Montreal in 1930, aged 58.\nReferences\n;Works cited\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
