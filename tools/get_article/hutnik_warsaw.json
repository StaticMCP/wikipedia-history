It was founded on 21 April 1957 as Hutniczy Klub Sportowy (''Steelworkers' Sports Club) and renamed Bielański Klub Sportowy (Bielany Sports Club) in 2001.\nHistory\nHutnik has never played in the top division, and the highest position it has achieved in the second-tier was a sixth-place finish in the 1992–93 season. The successes in the Polish Cup include reaching the quarterfinal in 1991, as well as winning the Cup on a regional level on 4 June 2008, after defeating Legia Warsaw II 1–0 in the final.\nDespite not being the most successful of clubs in terms of trophy-winning, Hutnik has always been particularly active in developing young, mostly local, players; several former Hutnik players even went on to play for the Poland national team. Michał Żewłakow, previous captain of the national team, is a former Hutnik player.\nHutnik was traditionally sponsored by the nearby steel mill (Huta Warszawa'') and the privatisation of that steelworks&nbsp;– and thus the ending of the sponsorship&nbsp;– marked the beginning of the club's steady decline. In the summer of 2012 Hutnik's disastrous financial condition finally resulted in dissolution of the club but the club was re-formed starting from the bottom of the league pyramid (8th level, known as B-Klasa).\nManagers\n*Hubert Musiał (1959–61)\n*Bolesław Popiołek (1961–62, 1967)\n*Krzysztof Skrzypczak (1962–64)\n*Czesław Wiśniewski (1964)\n*Andrzej Strejlau (1964–65)\n*Edward Brzozowski (1965–66, 1972–73)\n*Stanisław Woźniak (1966–67)\n*Longin Janeczek (1971)\n*Józef Bartkowski\n*Mikołaj Korzuń\n*Andrzej Czyżowski\n*R.
